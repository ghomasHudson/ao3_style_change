The response didn’t come for seven whole minutes, during which John stared stupidly at the photo and imagined all the ways he could make a mess of that man, if Sherlock would still let him.
But now it was more than unwelcoming; it felt hostile. A giant mouth, lying in wait as he padded across its tongue and tiptoed over its teeth, biding its time until it crushed him in its jaws and swallowed him deep.
In the meantime, Sherlock researched the history of various marriage traditions and pondered his own name.
“Da,” said Rosie. A plush rattle-y bunny poised halfway to her mouth, she was staring warily at Sherlock, whose voice had gradually risen to a near shout.
“Anything on the website?” John asks. He’s curled on his side on the sofa: a failed attempt to keep the come from leaking out his arse and all over the cushion. It dribbles out anyway, joining the long-dried streaks on his thighs.
John nipping Sherlock’s lips, hard but playful, saying ‘Going to just lie there and let me, are you? I’ve got a fake cock right here to use however I need, why would I want yours instead?’
The talk came later, at home over tea. I pushed a biscuit around on my plate as I half-listened to all the reasons I needed to learn to control my anger and the dire consequences if I didn’t.
He sees hesitation, arousal. It's the dilated pupils that invite him to lean down and pull slowly on the jacket that’s clutched like a shield between them, a soft, useless barrier.
John bends his knees to match the pattern of Sherlock’s legs, the dip in the bed tilting him toward Sherlock. Just a small roll forward would slot their bodies together, spoon cradling spoon.
Cold air still clinging to their shoulders, they trudged up the stairs, too tired to talk. John pushed open the door and took a few steps in, then stopped suddenly, causing Sherlock to bump into him.
“Right, I'll be there soon as I can.” He ended the call and stood up. “Liv, turn that off and get your coat.”
Far from the house, surrounded by the ring of hives in the sunlit meadow, they faced each other where they had kissed for the first time.
He shudders, aftershocks of orgasm leaving him splayed on the bed. He’s barely aware of John stretching out next to him, kissing his shoulder. He closes his eyes, savoring these moments of bliss, the low hum of John’s presence next to him.
His mother shuffled some papers on her desk, clearly working up to announcing something. “I just wanted to say that you've made quite a change for the better since you first arrived. I must commend you on your progress.”
He massaged his forehead. Maybe Anthea had Sherlock's number… No, that would be too pathetic to ask. Maybe Sherlock was back at the hotel, and he could catch him before he left. But that would be awkward. What would he even say?
“I don’t know. Until it’s safe to go back to London. Could be days or weeks…” he doesn’t want to think about leaving. “Can you —?” He doesn’t know how to phrase the question, but John has anticipated it.
In the upstairs hallway, Sherlock pauses by the door to one of the bedrooms. “I suppose any of these will do,” he says, his hand on the doorknob.
Music thrummed through the floorboards and a woman’s laughter floated up from the courtyard below. Sherlock tugged gently on the chain, pulling John closer.
He walked around the house at a distance, carefully sticking to the shadows wherever possible. He didn’t know where Sherlock’s bedroom was, so he scanned the upper windows, looking for a clue. He was losing hope when he finally saw a faint glow from a partially open window on the south side of the manor.
With sure fingers, John freed each button from the placket of Sherlock's fitted shirt, his efforts rewarded with the revelation of pale skin beneath black fabric. A metal disc on a chain -- his missing dog tag -- rested in the coarse hair of Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock let John drive the Vauxhall, enjoying John's obvious delight as he slipped the engine into high gear along the empty road. When they reached the lake, John's prediction that it would be deserted proved correct, not a bike or car or boat in sight when they rolled to a stop.
I left the flat and walked blindly until I found a coffee shop. It was a stupid choice for such warm day, but I ordered a latte anyway. I slid into a seat in the corner and nursed my drink.
John gazed at Sherlock, knowing Sherlock was analyzing him, observing how John's eyes slid to his mouth, to his neck, to where the robe sat slightly askew on his left shoulder, the silk threatening to skim off his skin. He could reach out so easily, slip it off.
When the lavish attention ceased, Sherlock hazily opened his eyes. John was standing, hastily stripping off the rest of his clothes, turning away to fuss with something on the dresser behind him. Sherlock heard the tell-tale sounds of a wrapper being torn open, could see John's arms bent at waist-level.
John turned back to his drink. Relationships rarely went smoothly in this pressure cooker environment. Besides, everyone had to be a little off kilter to willingly put themselves in a place like this in the first place. No surprise then when things got heated. But sometimes that intense heat could lead to a good thing…
“It's so smooth,” John commented, surprise in his voice. “Nothing like my dad's old rattletrap. How fast can she go?”
It was as if they’d pulled a magic thread that was unraveling all of their defenses and hesitations and misunderstandings, exposing a new and fresh beginning, full of promise. It made John want to take things slowly, even though his body was primed to race ahead. He didn’t want to ruin this by rushing into anything.
John’s brows drew together, and Sherlock extended his forearm, revealing a nicotine patch. “I used to smoke. Still do, some days. Long before that, I used to get high. We’re all just recovering from one thing or another.”
“I wonder when the water will be warm enough for a swim,” Molly mused idly. They both watched the sun sparkle on the lake. “It's okay,” she added softly, “to like to be alone.”
They exchange one more lingering glance before letting Mrs. Hudson bustle them into her kitchen, their intriguing conversation unfinished.
They came almost simultaneously, John pressing his arse against Sherlock's hips, aching to take Sherlock’s cock even deeper. John's legs quaked, the strong arm looped around his chest holding him up as they rode out the last waves of their release.
“I can't. I've gotta --” John paused, his eyes drawn down the sweeping outline of the Belstaff coat. He stared, surprised. “Um… you're not wearing trousers.”
John shook his head in amusement, then climbed into the white carriage with a black canopy and plush red seat. The dappled horse sported a red plume of feathers between his ears.
“Probably broadcast, with a face like that,” John muttered, bothered that he couldn't place the man.
“Mary died nearly two years ago. Pneumonia,” he forced himself to say. “She's buried in Lahore.” He kept his eyes on the floor, not wanting to see Sherlock's reaction. Pity. Sympathy. Or maybe more contempt.
After paying the bill, they lingered over the last of the wine, falling silent. John moved his leg closer to Sherlock's, then placed a hand over his knee.
“I saw something -- over there, it moved. And I heard it, her dress, and the roses -- then the bottle fell over --” he stops, realizing how unhinged he must sound.
John met his eyes, knowing Sherlock was describing their own acrimonious relationship. But now the schism between them was shifting and changing, narrowing. ‘Types like us,’ Sherlock had said. Thrillseekers forced to channel their impulses into safer avenues. They were more alike than he’d ever imagined.
“Mrs Watson, I would have asked you if I’d had the time but John was bleeding out and wouldn’t have survived my leaving him on the table long enough to ask permission.”
“Afraid not. I’ll keep my blood on the inside,” Sherlock replied, unimpressed. “You’re not trying very hard to remain hidden. What brings us to this coffee shop in the middle of the night?”
“Well, we couldn’t give you what was given to Doctor Watson. Not a drug addict. He went right to sleep. This is something that the Mistress mixed up just for you so that you could get some much needed rest,” Becca said as she pulled a pair of sealed surgical gloves out of her pocket.
“I think I’ll call him ‘Johnny.’ What do you think, Seb? You’re always so good with these nicknames.” Moriarty asked, briefly removing the tubing from between his lips. Jim had been casually sipping from the IV connected to John’s Port for over an hour now and Seb was beginning to worry about John’s survival. At the rate that Jim was drinking, John likely wouldn’t last for much longer.
“Just ignore him Gregory. You know he’s only doing that to bait you,” said a tall, slender man with faintly ginger hair.
The spare bedroom in the flat will be ready for Doctor Watson’s use within the next two hours. He doesn’t seem the fashion plate type so the lack of closet space won’t bother him.
“His number. It’s a little disconcerting that he puts his name at the end of his texts. I really don’t want to get in the middle of a family squabble.”
“I saw no reason to disturb Molly at this hour and took all of the samples myself. You can check the vials on the workbench if it will make you feel better.”
Sherlock had been insulted and had flounced off to his bedroom in a huff, slamming the door so hard that a picture had fallen off of the wall, glass shattering on impact. He didn’t even open his door to see what had happened and he certainly didn’t clean it up. John took care of it, as he did with all of the things that Sherlock felt was beneath him which was pretty much everything.
“Good. We’re done here. Hopefully Doctor Watson has learned not to frequent street corners looking for…comfort, one assumes.” Sherlock stood up and hurriedly exited the pub.
“I don’t want to do anything against your will, Sherlock. Are you willing?” John said, stroking Sherlock’s cock.
John thought that funny given how many times Sherlock had already repeated himself tonight but dutifully said nothing.
“You think that I won’t kick your arse? If you’ve read about me, you’ll have already learned that I was only challenged once or twice when I first started in the army but it only took a couple of times for people to realize that it wasn’t a good idea to test their strength against mine. So. Where. Did. You. Get. That. Information.
John’s chest hurt. His heart hurt. He didn’t know what had happened or where he was, just that he couldn’t move, his chest hurt, and he felt like he’d lost time somehow.
“What are you going to do? Have the Yard arrest me? I leave no evidence - unless I choose to, as you already know, and even if I did, Scotland Yard would be so confused that nothing would come of it,” Moriarty laughed. “Why, I could probably murder Watson right in front of their building and get away with it. Wouldn’t that be fun!”
“What? No. Just exhausted.” John shoved his jeans down without unzipping taking his pants with it. With a shrug, he pulled off his vest, fell face down on the bed and lay there without moving.
Why hadn’t Sherlock said anything else. That was suspicious. For something so important, he’d been awfully accepting about being put off. He’d never accepted John not bring at his beck and call before so what was different about tonight?
“Ok Neely. I’ve got some bad news for you…” Becca stopped reading a minute to wiggle her bottom closer into the chair, brought her feet up and rested the book on her knees.
“OH! I know!” John smooth the palm of one hand across Sherlock’s hip and upon reaching his lovely backside, gave it a firm squeeze.
“Chemistry? We’re Mated! Our relationship is biologically determined. You can’t just walk away from that.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied following that up with some whispered words that John couldn’t quite make out.
“Have a seat Sherlock. I wouldn’t leave just yet were I you,” Moriarty said with an artificial calmness that was belied by the blackness of his eyes.
“It’s always something. Slight miscalculation. I didn’t add in Anderson’s penchant for having the last, insulting word.”
“I have work to do anyway,” Anderson said, turning to leave. He’d made it about five meters away then turned back, pointed at Sherlock and said, “We’ll finish this later.”
“I love you THIS much!” Jim said, opening his arms so wide that he practically fell out of bed causing Sebastian to rushing back to his side.
Mind your own business and get off of my phone Mycroft before I tell mummy to expect you this weekend for a long mother/son visit.
“Nope but here come medical services, on time as usual. Good thing their patient has already expired. I’ll get some gloves from them and be right back,” Lestrade said walking towards the ambulance currently pulling up to the curb.
“So, what? This really is my life now? My freedom is gone and that’s it? I wish I’d never met Sherlock Holmes!”
Sherlock took a minute to look down and admire John’s sleeping form. He’d kicked off the covers at some point and they were barely hanging onto his hip. He’d gone to bed naked and Sherlock ran a hand gently along the crest of said hip enjoying the smoothness. He then reached up and ran his fingers through John’s hair. It was soft and fell back into place as soon as Sherlock removed his hand.
It’s been that way since I first met him. I’m drawn to him. I want to be with him, even on his worst, stroppiest days.
This house is getting to him, the strange occurrences and coincidences. He’s running out of theories to adequately explain everything, and he doesn’t like it.
John had to step around her, his heart hammering in anticipation as he tentatively glanced into the booth. Sherlock was absorbed in the wine menu, running a thoughtful finger over his bottom lip.
Now awake, John replayed the night in his head, quietly wondering what would happen next. He barely knew Sherlock, and yet they'd shared what was easily the most sensual experience of his life.
John pressed his lips together, heat prickling his neck from Sherlock's unwelcome observation. “You could be jailed.”
John led the way down the stairs and into the black car sent courtesy of Mycroft. They settled into the back seat, perfectly dignified.
John wiped his mouth, a nervous habit, determined to resist his wandering thoughts. “Right… So are we heading back to London tomorrow, then?”
“Oh… Sherlock…” John breathes his name out, amazed, relieved, utterly gobsmacked, besotted. “Sherlock… I —” John can’t form a proper sentence so he plunges toward Sherlock’s mouth instead, mashing noses and knocking teeth, his thumbs digging into Sherlock’s knees, kissing him back with a resounding
John scoffed and rolled onto his back. “I suppose you read all those scandal sheets and crime stories.”
Dad looked at me strangely, then smoothed his hand over the tabletop, sweeping away tiny crumbs. “Those days are over.”
This is too bizarre, too revealing of a dream. And yet he’s tempted to follow it, to let it unfold, to allow that strangely familiar palm to slide between his pliant legs, to cup his balls and half-hard cock, to stroke and coax him to a sleepy, sensual climax.
Sherlock tries each doorknob along the hall, some doors easily swinging open. He glances in, sniffs the air, assesses, then moves on. A few doors are locked, resisting the twist of Sherlock's wrist with a stubborn rattle. John scribbles a few notes about the locked rooms, lags behind, reluctant.
“Very good,” Sherlock praised John when they completed several rotations around the rug. “Try to relax. Not so stiff this time.”
About a half hour in, his phone pings with a text. He looks up from the microscope and glances at the screen. It’s from Molly.
Sherlock waits, the hiss of the shower and sharp scent of lavender soap filling the small space. Then he feels it, hands on his hips, the brush of a heavy cock against his own. Fingertips trace his cheekbone, over his lips, down his throat, mapping their way to his chest.
He replayed the conversation with his mother in his head, wincing at the long list of his transgressions. He never intended to stir up trouble; it just sort of followed him. Always had. His sharp tongue, fast wit, recklessness, and impatience often landed him in difficult situations that required him to flatter, fight, or flee his way out of.
Sherlock stretches an arm into the wire cage filled with wildly curling green leaves, his long fingers gently sinking around the red globe of a plump late summer tomato.
In August, Sherlock joined his parents at the villa for a month before returning to his graduate studies. At breakfast one morning, Sherlock’s father casually mentioned that John would be at a writer’s conference in London in the autumn.
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John throws his hands up in anger. “After what I just told you -- don't you get it?”
Hours later, Sherlock could still feel that kiss, his bottom lip bruised, a secret comfort that he held on to throughout the endless day and night. In the morning, he numbly went through the motions of bidding his parents farewell at the train station, finally boarding and collapsing into a corner seat in an empty compartment.
John had been in enough demonstrations to know when to move to the edge of the crowd and avoid the worst of the melee. He'd found a relatively safe vantage point crouched on a balcony, shooting frame after frame of the clash.
John returned the third kiss, wanting more, forgetting everything but the immediacy of desire. He groaned, pressing his mouth harder against Sherlock’s, his hands tightening their hold, Sherlock's fingers gripping into his skull.
“Well, I had a little sense of…” John pauses, stroking his chin thoughtfully, “…Call Me By Your Name action.”
Sherlock looked down, his thumb circling uncertainly over the rim of the bottle. John saw the hesitation and gently withdrew his leg. He pushed back from the table, trying not to feel disappointed.
“No,” John grits out. “I just don’t want to be trapped in a musty old storage room all night with two skeletons and a light bulb that’s about to burn out.”
Without thinking, John began stroking his fingers through Sherlock's hair, indulging in the silent intimacy. He felt Sherlock gradually relax, his body going limp, his eyes drifting shut.
Sherlock resettles the laptop on his legs, trying to find a comfortable typing position while stretching out on the sofa in the library. The safe house is old and drafty with ancient plumbing, gloomy furniture, and worn rugs, the WiFi apparently the only modern feature. The British government clearly had no budget to upgrade the decor.
Sherlock suddenly can’t wait to get home. He rushes to put everything away and lifts his coat from the hook, slipping his arms into the sleeves, the tails swirling as he sweeps out the door.
“We've come full circle,” John said, glancing away, trying to smile but failing. His fingers gripped and ungripped the handlebars. “I hate saying goodbye.”
He lay awake in the late hours, listening for John’s soft footsteps, imagining where he might have been, who he had been with, what they had done, masturbating to images of John with women, with men, a confusion of lust and jealousy and desire.
John inserts the key into the lock. It’s a bit tricky to open, the mechanism worn or rusty. He gives it a few rattles and twists, the latch scraping free after a minor struggle.
In addition to cooking and cleaning, these are the useful and not necessarily legal skills my father had taught me by the age of 18:
They are alone, the lights are off in Sherlock's bedroom. This is the first time they’ve undressed completely, allowing for an unrushed and thorough exploration of each other's bodies.
He barely notices when Hannah leaves, his focus on the floor. Suddenly it dawns on him. That board she stepped on never used to squeak. He stands up and presses his foot on the same spot, giving it a little bounce. It creaks in protest. In fact, it feels a bit loose.
Sherlock continues to put things away, determining the best way to ensure that John won’t slip away. The man’s a soldier and a doctor, clearly an adrenaline junkie. He lifts his eyes, his voice low, half teasing, half daring. “Are you worried that I might be dangerous?”
John turned back to the stove, his feet in faded black socks quiet against the kitchen floor. He added a knob of butter to a deep pan, let it melt, then stirred in the arborio. He cracked in some fresh pepper, added a pinch of an herb. Thyme, maybe.
Mycroft clears his throat, stalling. “You’ll be staying at a safe house. We still don’t know who did this. Until we catch him or her, you need to be kept out of sight.”
John wanders the streets, oblivious to the Christmas lights and feathery flakes of snow falling. He considers stopping at a pub to get blind drunk, but he doesn’t feel like being near people. He’s not even sure he has enough money to get drunk.
He's finds himself saying the next words without really meaning to. “I saw my parents at Christmas,” he starts.
John’s fingers circle around the start of his erection, toying with him, working him to a hard handful. John takes him in his mouth, and Sherlock inhales sharply at the sensation. Christ, there’s nothing else like it, tongue and heat, lips wrapping, pulling up slowly, the wet release, the maddening descent and ascent repeated again and again.
John smirked. Clearly, Mrs. Holmes was as commanding as ever. Several more minutes went by, Sherlock repeatedly glancing at his watch.
Sherlock now opens the last door in the hallway and peers into the room. Bed neatly made, a cool stillness in the air. Nothing unusual.
The blood drained from Sherlock’s face. He'd never told John the unsavory details about that part of his near expulsion.
He finally rolled out of bed and stumbled downstairs, lured by the smell of breakfast. He dove into the plate of sausages, poached eggs, and toast his mother had prepared. With the amount of physical labor he was doing, his appetite was relentless.
Sherlock steps forward, intrigued by the burnished patina of the bones. “They’re quite old,” he remarks.
“Oh, I quite like it,” Sherlock grins, deciding that John has suffered enough. “Moving on.” He consults the phone again. His eyes widen. “Do you have any tattoos?”
This time, John didn’t lower his arm, keeping his phone aimed. It would be easier to correct his aim if he wasn’t starting again each time. Dimly, he heard someone behind him snicker.
“[giggling] Suppose it’s good you didn’t try to make a woman instead. I imagine that would’ve been—”
It’s been cleaned since Sherlock was here earlier. Not only does the plastic smell overwhelmingly of cleaning product, but everything’s been rearranged and sealed in plastic storage bags. On a whim, Sherlock peeks into the crisper and finds it empty, although he knows this morning it contained at least one tomato and part of a head of lettuce.
—her hips rocking ceaselessly, trying to shove herself back and forth on Sherlock’s fingers with a rhythm so frantic and erratic that Sherlock couldn’t keep up.
So John lifted the computer as carefully as she could one-handed—it tested her wrist strength a bit, but fortunately that was more than up to speed—and balanced it on the chair arm while she considered how to respond.
There was indeed a two-day delay before John received an email from PayPal that Sherlock had sent him £1000, along with a short message.
When John left later that morning, after a shower and breakfast, Sherlock plopped himself in the leather armchair in the living room—wearing nothing but a burgundy dressing gown, which hung open, revealing a tantalising length of bare skin from his throat to his soft prick—and plumped his bottom lip into a pout.
His eyes are open, his head tipped back, so he can stare up at Sherlock. Sherlock can see his dilated pupils, how John’s eyelids droop when Sherlock’s prick sinks deep enough that John’s oesophagus struggles to accommodate its girth. Sherlock can see that as well, the column of John’s throat expanding, and he could feel it too if he wanted, but he’s content enough to simply watch.
“I’m quitting the surgery,” John said. “Or at least I will do. I typed up my resignation letter this morning.”
They really do just want you to be all right in the end, no matter how badly they go about it and how much of an arsehole it makes them.
John jerked and found a moment of clarity. Saw the human stumbling backwards, a full blood bag in his hand, fear in his eyes. He looked familiar. Why did he look familiar?
“There bloody wasn’t. You were… testing me. Or something.” John shouldn’t have—how much time had he spent performing silly tasks for Sherlock? how many times had he made an ass of himself in public to perform them?—but he found himself laughing. “I rode the London Eye
“Did you do something to all my clothes?” John asks that evening, standing in the doorway to Sherlock’s bedroom while Sherlock undresses for bed. His tone says he knows the answer to his question but for some reason wants to hear Sherlock verbalise it.
Sherlock stares into his tea. It’s still steaming, the sides of the delicate china cup nearly burning his fingers where he is gripping it. He grinds his teeth, and doesn’t answer.
“I am touching you,” John teases. “Or do you mean you want me to fuck my fist on your cock?” Even before he’s finished asking, he’s already obliging. His hand moves faster until he’s pumping expertly at Sherlock’s prick. “You’re lucky I thought to fetch the lube first, you know. You dirty, impatient thing.”
The corner of John’s lips twitched and then quirked into a smirk. “That one’s a little easier. The way you’ll get an idea in your stupidly brilliant brain and just throw yourself into it without giving a single thought about anyone else.”
“Friend of a friend,” he said aloud with a shrug. “When I mentioned I was coming, someone told me I might see him here, that’s all.”
, John thought, but no, not the time for another panic. Certainly not in front of Sherlock. He said, “I was… hungry. Actually hungry.”
“Apologies, Rosie,” Sherlock said, standing up with the toy still in hand, “but I think that your daddy might appreciate some tea.”
So Sherlock gives in and ruts against it until he’s sweating and panting, his legs going so tense that his muscles spasm and threaten to cramp. In a matter of minutes, he’s close, so close that he’s shuddering with it and straining against John’s grip, trying in vain to duck his head and muffle his moans in the pillow while he fucks it.
“Get your cock in me,” John said. He was panting now, his shoulder blades heaving. Lube had begun to leak from his arsehole, dribbling over Sherlock’s knuckles and staining his shirtsleeves. “Now.”
He’d not received a single text from SH in the time he’d been at the pub. Every time that John had been to the loo and checked Harry’s old phone, he’d been surprised, but now that the night was more or less over, he was completely baffled. The entire afternoon John had been bombarded with text messages from SH—‘Sigerson,’ he thought with a snigger—and now he was finally being left alone?
Those sound more like regrets to Sherlock than concerns. But he can see from the way John licks his lips, staring off over Sherlock’s shoulder, that he has more to say, so Sherlock remains quiet. Waits.
Even stranger was that the thought of water, ice-cold and clean, made his stomach turn and the thought of blood, warm and thick, made him dizzy with desire.
Afterwards, Angelo saw them out with a grin (and an exaggerated wink at John), and on the pavement outside Sherlock hailed them a cab—disgustingly easily, John had never seen a taxi stop so fast—and insisted on holding the door open for John and then clambering in after him.
“Yes. Kenny’s profile indicated a general uncertainty about his specific preferences but an overall curiosity about submission. Robert’s expressed an interest in being urinated on by a younger man.”
He was meant to be doing the work. Right. He drew his own hips back, gasping at the sensation of his prick sliding free (John’s muscles clutching at him, loath to be empty), before he drove forwards again, stuffing John full of his cock.
“But, you know,” John had continued, clamping down on the urge to smile, “people’s porn preferences don’t always correspond to their sexual preferences, so… you shouldn’t always go jumping to conclusions, yeah?”
“Didn’t think to bring my kit with me. Stupidly.” Sherlock flipped it over and poked at the battery compartment, then set it back down.
Sherlock considers leaving a comment. Something flirtatious, perhaps, something pertaining to the four love bites Sherlock left on John’s skin or how unfortunate it is that Sherlock’s own are fading or whether John has any interest in finding out if, for instance, Sherlock’s arse bruises as well as his neck.
Which was complete bollocks. John hadn’t been worrying about this for the last day and a half just to be brushed off now. “That’s what
He stood, rested his middle and forefinger on the still-tender area on John’s forehead, and pushed until it smarted. John hissed and leaned away until Sherlock dropped his hand.
And with a small, pleased whimper, Sherlock obeys. He remains utterly still, helpless, shaking, until he finally makes a mess of the floor, sending a series of whining “Oh, oh, oh”s towards the ceiling.
“Easy,” John said. There was a waver in his voice, followed by a guttural groan as he reached and touched where Sherlock was stretched wide around him. His fingers brushed the sore, sensitive rim of Sherlock’s hole. “Take it, uhn. Take it slow.”
Oh yes, John was interested. Aside from the parcel arriving, which he wasn’t keen to consider any longer, his day had been utterly dull.
It’s more than acceptable, in fact. It’s exquisite. If John can be convinced to scratch hard enough, perhaps deeply enough to draw blood…. Sherlock’s blood under John’s nails. The healing wounds cracking open the following day, staining Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock moving stiffly, being asked if he’s all right, complete strangers noticing his discomfort—
Sherlock wakes one morning at half three, rolls onto his side, and sees a strip of very faint light under his closed bedroom door.
Sherlock didn’t care. How could he when John was single-handedly ruining what was meant to be a brilliant evening? “Why not? I am, directly or indirectly, the cause of your objectionable behaviour. Surely your supervisor can see that as well as I. Asking you to correct your behaviour is as good as asking you to choose between your job and me.”
Is it the stereotype of the average video game player or some aspect of my emails themselves that makes you assume I’m younger than you? Not that your assumption was incorrect. I am younger than you, but not by what I would consider ‘much’: approximately five years and two months. Hopefully that isn’t an insurmountable age difference?
That shut Sherlock up sufficiently. His jaw snapped closed, and a small quiver went through his lower lip.
He’s cheered when John grants him a soft smile and an even softer “No, not really. Although this is a bit different than telling a client to stop being boring. But….”
He finds Lestrade a short distance away, standing with his hands on his hips and a hunted expression on his face. Sherlock strides towards him, and when Lestrade spots him, he blinks and—ah, yes,
When that had been sent, John closed his internet browser—resolutely shoving away the part of him that wanted to see if SH would respond to this message just as quickly as the last, the part of him that wanted to know what odd answer SH would have to this question—and shut off his computer for the night.
This time you are, sure. Maybe next time just show a little survival instinct and bring someone along.
“At least it was cold,” said Mrs Hudson, who’d rushed upstairs at the sound of John’s mug crashing to pieces on the floor.
Instead, Sherlock would have to content himself with a single fleeting encounter before the sun had even properly risen.
When Sherlock drew back, his eyes were dark and hooded. They did another thorough sweep of John’s body before, finally, lingering on his cock. John decided to give him a little show. It wasn’t the most comfortable position, lying on his side facing Sherlock with his top leg bent and his arm wound around his back, fucking himself from behind. But it was the one Sherlock liked most; he liked lying beside John, his chin propped up on one arm, and watching. So John stretched and twisted uncomfortably so that he could push his fingers deeper, curling them, until his half-hard cock gave a little twitch.
John raised an eyebrow, at first wondering if he’d misheard, but when Sherlock blanched, looking as though he might sick up all over his heavenly bedsheets, John realised he hadn’t.
John caught him by the biceps, smiling up at him like he was the light of John’s life, the brightest star in John’s vast galaxy.
But then, instead of taking out his prick and letting go, as Sherlock fully expected, John took up the ball again and waggled it in front of Sherlock’s nose until he had Sherlock’s attention. “Do you want it?” he said with exaggerated enthusiasm.
Sherlock took a thin sliver of skin at the centre of the burst between her teeth and bit down. She kept the pressure light, more of a nip than a proper bite. When she let go and drew back, there was a white oval-shaped outline in John’s tanned skin that faded in seconds.
He was, coincidentally or by design—always hard to tell, even though Sherlock always claimed it was the latter—on his lunch break when the flurry of texts started arriving.
But then Mrs Hudson was rushing out, announcing that they weren’t, and the moment—Sherlock’s hungry stare—was broken. They moved on.)
Sherlock reached behind and spread his cheeks, so that John’s next smack landed on the base of the tail directly. He could
Sherlock sent it and set his phone on the pillow beside his head. While he waited, he mapped the cracks on the ceiling (all of them small, barely visible, but still very much there despite Mrs Hudson’s vehement protests the last time Sherlock had brought them up) and trailed his fingertips up and down his sternum. He’d already removed his dressing gown—obviously, since kittens didn’t wear clothing—but now he began to wish he hadn’t. Let John see it hanging off his shoulders in the photos and wish he’d stayed home today so he could have helped Sherlock take it off.
John jolted, whimpering. “That’s it.” She gripped Sherlock’s hip loosely as though trying to ground herself. Her voice was high and tight. “Bite me. Feels good.”
“Speaking of. For god’s sake, John.” Sherlock removed the ring from the box and put it on his finger. “Look at this.”
Somewhere in the corridor, a door opened and a pair of feet padded across the floor. The only sign of life aside from the quiet sounds of John’s breath.
“Nicotine patches. Helps me think.” Sherlock lifted his right hand, revealing three round patches stuck to his left arm.
“Confirmation of your preferences,” Sherlock answered. “I could deduce them, of course. How often and how quickly your nipples harden during the day, your gait and body language when your sexual interest is aroused, common themes in your choice of pornography…. But I admit I’m not confident in my accuracy. Human sexuality is notoriously difficult to pin down.”
It was the BlackBerry. Buzzing incessantly against the wood of his desk, the screen lit up (albeit facedown, muting the glow considerably).
And Sherlock knew John Watson well enough that he hopped immediately to his feet and followed John out the door.
“Not like yours, you knob. As a doctor and a fellow human, I can safely say that yours are very striking.”
“You gave me your address,” said Sherlock. His lips crooked into a smirk. “That’s how I knew where you lived.”
And with that, he rang off. John set the BlackBerry on his desk with a bewildered sigh that became a pained grimace as his leg abruptly began to ache.
John could feel Sherlock’s feeble laugh against his back. “It’ll pass. In 50 or so years, you won’t need or want to feed so often.”
Mycroft rocked back on his heels, looking amused. “No more so than you are by your father’s alcoholism, I’d wager. It was traumatic, of course, and you still bear the mental scars… but it was never him you thought of when you would stare down the barrel of your gun, was it?”
Later, after John has come down Sherlock’s throat, John rolls to his side, boneless and drowsy with contentment, and nuzzles senselessly into the pillow while Sherlock curls around his back and measures the space between each of John’s ribs with his fingers.
A little soppier than John meant it to be, but it was honest, so he supposed it would do. He posted it and then got up to make himself a cup of tea.
Sighing, John pushed his dinner tray away. The only thing on it was a plastic cup of blood with a little bendy straw, and the reek of it was making him nauseated. Knowing that it would eventually smell appetising made him even more so.
“I see the problem,” he admits softly. “Failing to admit my ‘concerns’ is lying by omission. John would find it reprehensible. Perhaps not as reprehensible as Mary’s actions, but nevertheless—”
All of it jerking John in one direction, then another, then another, but he didn’t feel overwhelmed. He felt sharp and alert, practical and useful:
Christ. John clenched his jaw, holding in a sigh, and shifted in his chair. What did he mean? He meant that his life was so uninteresting that making a public record of it seemed absurd. After all, the brightest part of his day was receiving a text from Sherlock, a man he hardly knew and who was so clearly keen on him that it made him a bit uncomfortable—how pathetic was that?
, he thought, and couldn’t help but clench around the toy. The hard metal budged and wiggled as his muscles tightened around it, and his prick jerked upwards, pushing into his belly. It ached even more strongly now. The pillow moulded around it, cradled the length in fabric and feather down. Sherlock thought of John plastered against his back, reaching around and cupping Sherlock’s cock like it was a treasure, saying
And if there are other stipulations, Sherlock will surely learn about them in due time, from John’s comments on other couples or his comments on their own burgeoning relationship.
Mrs Hudson tittered in amusement but said nothing as John carried on up the staircase. When he reached the top, the door to Sherlock’s flat was thrown abruptly open, and there Sherlock stood, wearing the same burgundy-coloured dressing gown that John had last seen him in, although this time he wore a white t-shirt and checked pyjama bottoms beneath it. His eyes were wide as an owl’s, and he sucked in a breath so sharp that his shoulders heaved.
John remained where he was, although he did give another nuzzle, a bit lower this time: nudging one of the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt with his nose. On a whim, he closed his teeth around it, being sure not to catch his fangs (which were peeking only slightly out from his gums) on the fabric, and tugged gently.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and levelled a look at John that he couldn’t quite interpret. “Charming. It must be his delightful personality that’s made you so keen on my brother.”
This time, the skin wasn’t just white, it also bore the clear impression of Sherlock’s front teeth: both incisors and cuspids on the top row, and all the way to her premolars on the bottom. The top row faded in seconds, although the bottom one remained.

John doesn’t move, and Sherlock assumes he is thinking, pondering Rosie or his own situation, until a soft, familiar snort tells Sherlock that he’s fallen asleep. Rosie, too, seems to be dozing now, albeit with the nipple still in her mouth. Not wanting to bother either of them, Sherlock simply sinks into his own mind to pass the time.
“Yes, thank you,” said Sherlock, speaking quickly. “Good of you to pop by, but as I said: very busy, important plans, must run.”
“You’re a whore,” Sherlock said, gritting her teeth as the pleasure rocked through her and tried to rattle her thoughts entirely. “Look at you. I don’t even have to move. You’re doing all the work, fucking yourself on my cock like a good little whore.”
“You realise,” Sherlock said, sounding far more awake than John had expected, “you’ve just slept the entire night in my bed without a nightmare.”
“In the last week, you’ve added three new videos to your collection of pornography. All of them feature pale, dark-haired women with disproportionately large breasts. My skin is pale, my hair is dark, but I don’t have breasts. Will this be a problem?”
John glanced down at himself. He was leaning back into the sofa, his knees apart. He felt calm, not threatened in the slightest.
John didn’t want to, in fact had every intention of staying right where he was, but then Sherlock added, “Turn over and you can drink from my throat.”
“Shh, hey,” John said, kneeling down. “It’s all right. You didn’t know. You need to be trained so you’ll learn what I expect of you. But we can work on that later, can’t we?”
This time, John didn’t feel much like obliging. He stayed where he was, even sliding his feet farther apart so he was slouched shorter than usual, until Sherlock gave in with a long, needy whine and stooped as much as necessary to kiss the centre of John’s scarred shoulder and then take John’s left nipple between his lips.
Then there was Aunt Harry, who now talked about everything that she used to hide. She was a few years older than my dad, and a few inches taller, which she never let him forget. I learned that for years, she and Dad had barely spoken to each other. She didn't even go to his wedding.
A familiar warmth bloomed in Sherlock's belly as John's hand glided over his skin. He marveled that he could want John again so quickly, his cock rising half mast in anticipation.
He clenched the lighter in his hand as he spoke. “The fact is, I hurt your father deeply all those years ago. He’s kept me at a safe distance -- for his sake and yours -- and I understand that. I would do anything for him, and if it means having him for only a few hours at a time, I accept that.”
There could have been more. They could have gone on. But John had been sensible, slowing their urgency. They had time. They had the summer ahead of them.
John repeats the words to himself, clenches his fists, then forces his hands to relax. He squares his shoulders and continues to follow Sherlock down the dim hallway, a well-worn rug muffling their footsteps.
He thought they would argue, that she would accuse him of treachery or deceit. He almost relished the thought of a true fight, of finally seeing Mary lose control, her throat flushed, furious. He wanted to strip down their relationship past niceties to the raw bones, to see what they were really made of.
Sherlock’s almost forgotten about his own scar until John takes in a sharp breath. “My God, what happened?” John’s fingertips lay atop the bullet wound, shock written on his face.
“So,” John begins, picking up his wine glass and toying with it, “will you be looking for a tenant for Mrs. Hudson’s flat?”
“I don’t ever do this — have anyone here —” Sherlock cautions John, wanting him to know. “It’s been… a long time.”
Sherlock froze, unsure how much to read into Mycroft's comment. But then it struck home. Mycroft knew about John. Of course he did. He had the same uncanny ability to observe and deduce, and he could easily read every undercurrent of their slow waltz in the middle of the afternoon.
Taking a deep breath, he threw the stone in a graceful arc, the point of contact confirmed with a satisfying tonk. He quickly stepped back into the shadows and waited again. Nothing. Cursing under his breath, he dug out another stone, stepped forward, and launched it up at the glass. Tonk!
“There must be mirrors, projectors, some sort of elaborate set up,” Sherlock had mused on the long drive to the manor, his fingers drumming the steering wheel.
Sherlock ran his palms down John's chest, his hands lingering, feeling the heartbeat. Always steady, reassuring, a constant he relied on. He then slid them to the warmth of John's stomach, lower to his hips.
Sherlock watched him, his eyes heavy lidded. John took a steadying breath, then lowered himself between Sherlock’s legs. He pressed slowly forward, the head of his cock sliding in. He almost gasped, the ring of muscle so tight around him, slick and firm yet giving enough to press deeper.
I’d usually lose myself in a book or listen to music and play games on my phone while they chatted, since adult conversations were generally pretty dull. I’d occasionally catch intriguing snippets about “motive” or “time of death,” but remained slumped on the sofa nibbling on biscuits or an apple.
Mycroft hesitates but doesn’t argue. “I suppose I could do with some proper sleep.” He slowly gathers his coat, patting his pockets for his phone. “I’ll be back tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah, over a hundred years old, I’d say. You don’t often see real ones anymore. Must have willed their bodies to the hospital for science.”
Mike looked sheepish. “Um, yeah. I was hoping there would be space for him down the hall, but, you know…”
“Look, about earlier today,” John flexed his hands on the lower part of the steering wheel. “I'm sorry if I offended you. I asked a personal question. It's none of my business.”
Sherlock repeats to himself. Such a simple, solid name. “And what about our family? Did anyone serve with him?”
It was the week before Christmas, the breakfast table a feast of fruit and eggs and pastries, fresh squeezed juice and strong coffee, friends and neighbors who dropped by to greet them persuaded to stay for a bite to eat.
“Never really learned,” he shrugged. “My family wasn't particularly good at having fun.” He meant it to come out jokingly, but he could feel both Molly and Sherlock's eyes on him.
I slid into the passenger seat, already bored thinking about the drive home. I sighed, still waiting for Dad. How bloody long did it take to say good bye?
“I can't remember either.” Sherlock stared down the street, then suddenly grasped John's arm. “Let's be tourists. Come on.”
Okay, take a deep breath. Now look at the tag that says "angst with a happy ending." I promise it will happen! For now, I'll pass you a few tissues and a nice, soothing cup of herbal tea.
“Hell, yes,” Sherlock affirms sleepily. A few moments later he opens one eye. “What about you?” He glances down at John's lower half.
“Good then, fine.” Sherlock stumbled over his words, quickly rising to his feet. “I’ll let Mrs. Hudson know you’ll take the room, and I’ll ask Mycroft to send a car around for your things at the end of the week. Will that suffice?”
He doubted Sherlock would ever reveal his inner thoughts. He was an enigma, shimmering quicksilver that constantly slipped through John’s fingers.
“You think she --” John starts, then stops. It doesn't matter how they ended up in this ridiculously romantic bed, only that they did.
He stepped back into his room and slumped against the door, feeling like he'd been punched in the gut. Sherlock had simply left without a word.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock answered, his mood suddenly calm. He tucked the paper into his jacket pocket. “Small change of plans. Seems there’s been some water damage at the hotel. Broken pipe. Mycroft’s made other arrangements on our behalf.”
I thought about the relationship talk with Aunt Harry quite a bit, trying to imagine what kind of partner would suit her or my dad. I was probably about nine years old then, and wondering why Dad didn’t date anyone.
Sherlock ached with confusion, not knowing what to feel. For so long, he had avoided putting a name to the thoughts and memories that occasionally surfaced, burying them with work and syringes and violin music.
Over the next weeks and months I stealthily watched them, tallying up a list of gazes and touches, fingertip brushes along shoulders and arms, shins grazing under tables, hips nearly in contact as they spoke in low tones in stairwells and hallways.
Mrs. Watson pulled another sheet of paper from her apron pocket and pushed it toward him. “Harry wrote. She has a job in London as a secretary.”
He turns his head toward Sherlock, finding his mouth, his palm covering Sherlock’s cock. It doesn’t take long — a few firm strokes — and Sherlock comes in John’s hand, moaning a kiss into his mouth.
John was frequently absent from lunches and dinners. Whether he was working, resting, or meeting someone, Sherlock did not know. When John did grace their table, women smiled at him and tossed their hair, looking at him from under their lashes. John accepted the attention with good humor, sometimes responding with flirtatiousness. Women touched his arm as they laughed, men clasped his shoulder as they told him stories. He was golden, glorious, the type of man women wanted to take to bed, the type men wanted to be in bed.
He disappeared to sit in his smoking spot by the glasshouse, distracting himself by watching a butterfly flit from flower to flower.
Sherlock takes the laptop, perplexed. “I don’t understand. I didn’t go upstairs at all this afternoon,” he trails after Hannah as she returns to the kitchen.
Sherlock wordlessly pulled John close, pressing their hips together, capturing his mouth in a passionate kiss.
“On Halloween?” John stares at him incredulously, then shakes his head. “Oh my God, you’re turning into Mycroft.”
I slipped into the dark bathroom and stood by the curtain that years ago I’d insisted be hung up to block the embarrassingly semi-transparent door that led into Sherlock’s bedroom.
Sherlock says nothing, but slowly draws the jacket toward his chest, pulling John a few inches closer.
“Simple observation, really. There's an anatomy text lying under that tree over there, along with a rather poorly hidden silver flask. And I assume the woman wearing black who just peered out the window is your recently widowed mother. The bit about your father was an educated guess. After all, here you are, spending a dull summer pulling weeds for your auntie… Trying to make up for past disappointments, perhaps? And the medical profession tends to run in families, so…” Sherlock lifted one shoulder in a shrug.
Sherlock was moving his game piece into the ballroom where the revolver lay. I was curious about something.
They ate, talking about the day, John telling a story about a difficult patient with an embarrassing itch, the conversation soon descending into juvenile jokes and snorts of laughter about patients’ humiliating health problems. A second round of beer was popped open, Sherlock divulging the salacious details of a family dispute that involved old money, multiple affairs, an impending ugly divorce, and a handsome gardener.
“No, it's Mike Stamford.” Sherlock made no move to take off his coat. He scrutinized John. “You knew him at university, I gather.”
John felt a shiver at the base of his spine. He wanted to live dangerously, didn't he? Visiting a murder scene at night with a man he desperately wanted to kiss again certainly qualified as reckless. In fact, it was mad. He looked back at Sherlock. “Wouldn't miss it for the world.”
He bent his neck slowly, his mouth drawn toward John's, sensitive nerves responding to the warmth radiating from skin, mere seconds stretching into endless anticipation, a frisson of fear, the tightly wound tension of pent up desire shimmering in the small space separating their lips.
They entered the warm glasshouse, condensation clinging halfway up the window panes. The fragrance of exotic blooms wound around them, the flowers’ bright colors muted in the dim light.
He hated him. Worried about him. Wanted to forgive him. Wished he'd never come back. Wanted him to stay. He sifted through a thousand different shades of emotion, none of them indifference.
No reply comes and he walks on, his hands shoved in his pockets. He's too old for this, full of worry and heartsick. He'd avoided all these complications for years, and now drifting in his 40s he’s as moody as a teenager. Pathetic.
“What? And leave you here alone? Absolutely not.” She straightens her shoulders. “I’m staying. I’m not leaving my patient. Do you hear that, Captain Watson?”
After a twinge of irritation, John decided to go. His neck was a little tight, his back a bit stiff after sitting so long. He made his way to the spa in the lower level of the resort and was whisked off to a changing room that contained a fluffy white dressing gown.
But there were no interesting cases at the moment, which made him restless. Sherlock glanced at his watch. John was still at work.
Smiles played on their lips, the fence a barrier between them, the possibility of eyes on them restraining their exchange.
“Of course I did! You know what they say,” John’s eyes gleam devilishly. “Revenge is a dish best served cold.” He curls frozen fingers around Sherlock’s cock, making him jump and shrivel.
“I think you do.” John leaned up, placing his hands lightly on Sherlock’s waist, and let his lips touch Sherlock’s, warm and soft. Sherlock inhaled shakily and John kissed him again, moving his fingertips to cradle Sherlock’s neck. He could feel Sherlock’s pulse racing, feel his hesitancy fading, his hands sliding up his shoulders, drawing him closer.
Sherlock smiled again, his eyes moving down John’s torso, resting noticeably on his crotch as if seeing through his trousers.
“You can show me the best museums and book shops. We’ll go out, eat like kings, get drunk.” He caressed Sherlock's thigh. “Fuck all night.”
I don’t remember a thing about her. Dad will only say that she was not the person he thought he’d married. It’s scary to think that even adults make big mistakes.
“Another era comes to an end,” Sherlock says quietly, fingering the ring of keys in his hand. He now owns the entire building, having come to an agreement with Mrs. Hudson on the price. It had been her idea to sell it to him, and he'd gradually warmed to the idea. It’s probably the first sound investment he's ever made in his life.
John cleared his throat. “This summer…” he started, “was not what I thought it was going to be.” He looked at Sherlock. “It was so much more than I could have hoped for. I’ll never forget it.”
It was a late Sunday afternoon and cold winter rain lashed at the windows. John had the day off and hadn't seen Sherlock since that morning when he'd left the flat.
“So tomorrow,” John begins, pulling on his jacket, “I could bring Rosie ‘round with me after work. If that's alright with you.”
He now reclined in the lounge chair by the pool, waiting, sunglasses on, shirt off, listless, the cicadas droning. John was late.
They walk quickly back to the flat, not talking. Sherlock unlocks the front door, hesitating just a beat in the dark entryway, noticing the absence of light glowing from Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen. He shakes it off and flicks on the switch to illuminate the stairs.
Sherlock turns away from the window and goes to the kitchen to make a cup of tea. He carries the mug into his bedroom and opens the wardrobe doors, lifting a box from the top shelf.
He finally cools, cleans himself up, and rolls back into his pillow, half asleep. Tomorrow he’ll borrow John’s laptop, copy that photo, search the files for any other material of interest. John can’t know about this, his military fetish. It’s far too intimate.
“I could use a glass of water,” John said, his voice low. He glanced toward the house. “Want a drink?”
Sherlock gnawed on the last sentence, intrigued. Who would want to murder a hiker, and if they had, how was it done? If he died of natural causes, why would the police find it suspicious?
“Please, call me Irene.” She smiled graciously. “I like detective stories.” She flicked her eyes at Sherlock. “And detectives.”
John trailed his fingers down Sherlock's arm, a melancholy in his voice. “Only two more weeks until I go back to New York.”
John tries to convey everything through his eyes — so much that he can’t say yet, all that he wants and hopes for — choosing the simplest question. “Will you watch a movie with me?”
“She's in one of her deep thinking phases,” Mr. Holmes had explained to John apologetically. “A lovely big brain filled with mathematics.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Molly, noting the way her cheeks flushed. “He's recently divorced, you know. You might stand a chance.”
He glanced over at John, about to say he'd trade places and drive back. John was staring at him, a strange look in his eyes. It was fleeting, but Sherlock caught a sense of inner conflict, as if he was holding himself back from doing or saying something he knew he shouldn't.
Sherlock leans forward, somber when he speaks. “Is this really what you want, John? A few hours or days here and there? Is this enough for you?”
John grinned, and they settled into trading the latest rumors about the president, the opposition, and the likely timing of another coup attempt. The last uprising had been three years ago, with alliances and power switching hands faster than outside analysts could keep up with.
“There are a number of conscription records with the surname Holmes,” Mycroft says. “But I found something else rather interesting. Had to use my special clearance to access sealed files.”
This was it. This was the opening I’d been waiting for. I could spill out all my suspicions and evidence and share this burden of knowing too much. But I couldn’t do it.
As they continued to talk, John began to warm toward Sarah. She was smart and funny, and, if he wasn’t wrong again, she was flirting with him, smoothing her hair and occasionally touching his arm or shoulder as they spoke. Her attention was a balm on his bruised ego, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to pursue her interest in return. But in the meantime, he was more than happy to enjoy her company.
His fingers relayed to him a profound sadness, a loneliness that was like a deep ache. He paused, Sherlock's shallow breath and rapid pulse offering a flutter of restrained hope, the beating wings of desire and fear.
“Sorry the office isn’t exactly luxurious,” Mike apologized. “You think they’d treat visiting scholars a little better. I tried to get you space over in the new building, but you know how it goes. Politics.”
“The young man of the house way back in the early 1900s. Story is,” she leans forward like a confidante, “he trained as an army surgeon and was shipped overseas during World War I. He survived two years of action, then caught a bullet in the desert somewhere. They patched him up and sent him home, but he never recovered. His wound never healed properly and he bled to death on the floor of that bedroom upstairs. They say he died from a curse. Or was it a broken heart?” She tilts her head, trying to remember. “Whatever it was, it was an unhappy ending, so the poor sod still haunts this house.”
John didn’t know why Harriet didn’t like him. At first he’d tried to do anything to make her smile, make her love him like she loved Lawrence but no, she was all lightness and joy with Lawrence while John was miserable and alone.
“All done. Do you know that Doctor Watson had a copy of Valley of the Dolls hidden in the back of the bookcase?”
‘Hah! Found you, you clever bastard!’ Sherlock was slid under their bed and had just discovered the cigarettes stuffed between the wooden frame of the bed and the boxspring. He just needed to slide under a little further, further, further…”AH HAH!” He exclaimed aloud as his fingers finally touched the glorious pack of smokes. Pulling them out didn’t work; they were firmly wedged in there. Sherlock wiggled the pack from side to side until the pack popped free landing in his waiting hand. Then he heard Mrs Hudson come in. He couldn’t let her know that he’d found them! She’d tell John as soon as he got home. No. She wouldn’t wait. She’d probably call him! ‘Can’t a man have one vice?’ Sherlock thought to himself, completely unaware of the irony of Sherlock thinking that he only had one vice.
He slipped off his shoes and quietly hung his coat on the rack making no sudden movements. Sherlock seemed perfectly engrossed in whatever he was looking at so John thought that his chances were slightly higher than usual that he’d be able to make it to their bedroom without attracting his attention. With any luck, Sherlock was visiting his Mind Palace and wouldn’t notice anything.
Sherlock stood so abruptly and faced Becca that he flung her backwards which didn’t seem to affect her sangfroid in the the least.
Although the man hadn’t believed in love at first sight, he changed his mind when he met the genius. Light filtered through his hair creating a halo effect around his head and in that moment, the man knew that he was lost.
“I feel the same way. I’ve always considered love at first sight to be a myth but one look at you and I knew I had to have you.
Lifting John’s legs, he helped to slowly lay them down, followed by maneuvering his upper body gently onto the table. John groaned in pain.
Another shot rang out, this one even closer than the last. Suddenly, the sound of helicopter blades could be heard and with the exception of Private Sturges, all five excitedly but carefully waved them in.
“Maybe someone who was raped?” Elizabeth said gently. She knew Bob’s opinion on the matter but she’d always believed her daughter and thought she understood how she felt. Harriet would come around, eventually, she hoped.
“About a month ago, I was masturbating and thought ‘I wonder if I could discipline myself to come without touching myself’ and the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to try. My mind, as you know, John, functions at a much higher level than the majority of people so I knew that I would be successful. I just needed to find a catalyst.
“Look who’s a good boy!” John said loudly, dropping the box that he was carrying, with a crash next to the bed.
“I don’t like this story. I'm tired. I’m going to go to sleep now. I love you, John.” Sherlock sighed, his body relaxing into sleep.
“Not at all, sir. I’ll prep a syringe and have it ready and waiting for you if I’m gone too long and you get peckish waiting for me.” Moran said, trying to placate his boss.
“Do you think he’s really alright, John? I don’t know what’s wrong but I was just having fun with him. He must really hate the word ‘pila’.”
"Uh. Well. This is...unexpected." Lestrade said, frozen in the entrance of John and Sherlock's flat.
“Haven’t you had enough whiskey to dull the pain yet? You’re clearly not drunk so you’re used to drinking but you’re also holding your glass with your left hand now so you’re obviously feeling better. Come with me to look at the body. It’ll be fun.”
“I happened to them. I drank their blood until I heard their heartbeat begin to stutter, then I drank the rest until their hearts finally gave out. I couldn’t leave teeth marks on the bodies so I tore their necks apart to ensure that Scotland Yard wouldn’t be able to find me by dental x-rays. No one believe in vampires anyhow so it was easy.
He felt like he should be embarrassed by this but…it seemed unimportant at the moment and the words seemed to pour out of their own accord.
John had delayed leaving the lab for as long as possible, dreading that he might find Sherlock out there waiting for him, despite having been warned off. If John knew that Sherlock had considered himself as being patient until now, there would never have been a question of moving into Baker Street. The answer would have been an immediate and emphatic ‘NO!’
“Great. Now I’m involved in cloak and dagger shit. That’s just perfect. When did that car get here?” John asked, not having noticed the car following them. No wonder Sherlock was worried about him being picked off by Moriarty. He needed to pay more attention to his surroundings.
“Yeah. That’s what we’re doing right now, in fact. Hey. Thanks for listening. Sorry to dump all of this on you. I don’t usually do this sort of thing.” John apologized.
The man finished his meal dabbing daintily at the corners of his mouth with a fine linen handkerchief. His initials were embroidered onto it: JM
“Oh, I mean it. Some man raped me and I wound up pregnant. I wanted an abortion but my parents wouldn’t give permission because I’m only 16. I just want it out. Throw it in the trash for all I care. Just know this; I won’t be leaving here with that bastard.”
John decided to just ignore the entire…seduction conversation and move on to the thing that he was most interested in; how did Sherlock know so much about him after only having just met him.
“Well, when you’re not expecting anything, getting coffee, even vending machine coffee, is a well appreciated distraction from work.”
“No. Not an aviary an ‘apiary.’ There’s a small beehive in production on the roof surrounded by a well tended garden. It’s amazing! Come on, John. You have to see it!” Sherlock smiled, slapped the door frame twice, and took the steps two at a time back upstairs.
“Come live with me and find out.” Sherlock leaned forward, took John’s hand and looked him in the eye.
“Drugged? What are you talking about? I gave him my coffee by mistake and he decided just to drink it since it was similar to mine. Wait! It had been meant for me! Someone was trying to drug me?! Is someone after me?” Moran asked nervously. God, he was having a good time. He had to admit that this was some of his finest acting.
"Oh. We play this all the time and Sherlock always loses, don't you, Sherlock," John said, smirking.
“Ok, fine. You’re no fun. I don’t even know why I like you. Oh, yes I do! It’s that marvelous brain of yours. You’re a challenge and I haven’t met one of those in such a long time - if ever. Just imagine if we joined forces. We could rule the world!” Moriarty exclaimed, seeming overly excited by the idea.
“You’re a scientist. You usually try to learn everything about a subject you’re involved in. I’d call it research but we both know that you just dive in with both feet…” Sherlock suddenly looked even more nervous.
John began kissing his way down Sherlock’s body stopping for a suckle of his nipple. Sherlock entire body tensing.
Walking back to his desk, he felt the world spinning a bit and tripped - when he checked what he’d tripped over - nothing. Reaching his chair he placed his hand onto the back of it, slowly easing himself into his chair. He felt like his heart was trying to burst through his chest. He was NEVER drinking espresso again!
“Yes. We told him about the miscarriage and the hysterectomy. He actually handled that better than the idea of visitors for some reason.” The doctor said, giving Mrs Watson a knowing look.
“It’s your deepest self. What makes you you. Your Soul goes on long after the body has ceased to be,” John finished.
“Honestly John. Do you really think that I’d perform surgery on you just to kill you? Besides, Sherlock wouldn’t like it if we killed you, I know that the boss definitely wouldn’t be happy, so just behave and hopefully you’ll get out of this alive.”
He was distinctly uncomfortable with the details of Doctor Watson’s…skill. Not that he was a prude really, but he didn’t want to think about cock sucking while on a case or any time really. He’d merely asked out of curiosity. He was married to his work and his cock was basically dormant at this point in his life and he wanted to keep it that way.
“Ok. I might be a little gay. You just, you just smelled so good and suddenly I had to have you. You were irresistible. Is it always like this?”
Once Sherlock had put himself into the requested position, John lay behind him and rocked his cock against Sherlock’s arse once, twice, three times then slid his cock down until the head was just at Sherlock’s hole.
“Because this is all a glamor. The feelings are real but you never would have acted on them so quickly, if at all, if I hadn’t forced you too.”
"I'll be sure to mark that on the calendar. 'Mycroft agreed with me.'" Sherlock replied sarcastically.
Irene’s business was discrete; hidden behind the facade of an image consulting firm catering to men in the upper echelons of London. And while the occasional woman utilized Mistress Adler’s services, all brothel workers were men. There were women on the staff but they handled the business side of things. Finances, scheduling, and medical.
Sherlock pulled Moriarty close to his face and whispered, “I’m serious, don’t touch him.” Sherlock let go of his lapels and shoved him back in his chair.
Sebastian looked at the clock on the wall and said; “It’s 12pm. Isn’t that when your shift normally ends?”
“Stop. Just stop right there. My work is important too. Actually, I’d say that it was often more important than yours seeing as most of my patients usually start out alive and I tend to keep them that way.”
Not that Sherlock couldn’t figure out if someone entered the flat without a sound. John swore that he could sense a shift in air as soon as it had been displaced. Normally, that was very impressive and had saved their arses on more than one occasion. When he was this tired, though? Not so much.
“This person wants me to abuse and rape you. To treat you like you were my property,” John finished awkwardly.
“What? No. Of course not. You have leaping and jumping capabilities at great distances but I don’t recommend throwing yourself off of a building.”
Returning his attention to Sherlock’s cock, John gripped it in his right hand and rubbed the tip against his lips interspersed with gentle butterfly kisses. Looking up and meeting Sherlock’s eyes, he began licking his cock slowly as if it was the most delicious ice cream he’d ever had then began sucking on the head.
“I’m sure it’s awful. I just want to check one more thing,” John said and began checking each finger individually, pulling one gently and pushing it back before moving on and repeating the action with the next finger.
One day he came home from school to find that Harriet had run away. Mummy was a little upset but other than that, no one in the family, other than Lawrence and his mum, who had had to quit her job to take care of them both, seemed to care why she’d left or where she’d gone. Especially John. Now he only had Lawrence to deal with although his aunt wasn’t much nicer and also had a temper just like daddy’s. She yelled at John a LOT but he never knew what he’d done wrong so he didn’t know how to fix it.
“Thanks. It’s not every day that your entire world is upended and everything that you thought you knew about yourself was a lie,” John replied, pouring two fingers of scotch into his empty tumbler.
“Get up and stretch your legs. Try to get some feeling back into your arms. Then I want you in your bedroom, completely naked, face down on the bed.”
Attempting to brush the dirty floor from Jim’s clothes, Sebastian finally gave up and dragged Jim into a seated postion, leaned him against the wall and went back to check on John.
“Well, you do now. Let’s step over here and discuss this further,” John said, gesturing to a nearby alley.
Sherlock and John stood there, open mouthed, watching Lestrade and Anderson leave. They turned to each other.
Standing slowly and taking an aggressive stance, John said, “No. I don’t think I’ll be doing that. You’re at a crime scene. My crime scene which, as you seem to be a civilian, do not belong. Take yourself off before I do it for you,” John said, equally seriously and just as deadly.
“Ah! The lovely Dahlia. This particular one has the show name of Bishop of Llandaff. Dahlias can represent a lot of different things but commitment is what's termed as its general meaning.”
“I wouldn’t want you too anyhow. I do wish that we’d quit getting caught by the cops with our pants down all the time though.”
I would love nothing more than spending time with you getting to know you better. I will meet you at the coffee shop at 2pm sharp. I look forward to seeing you again.
Spreading Sherlock’s cheeks, John gave a kiss to each one on either side, he traced his way to Sherlock’s hole with his tongue. Upon reaching his destination, he began placing butterfly kisses directly on his hole interspersed with lightly sucking at the edges.
John legged it from one end of the alley to the other. He checked for possible hiding places and then finished by walking several steps onto the walkways outside of the alley just to make sure that no one had hidden in a doorway.
“Oh, well past your anus, Sherlock,” John gave a satisfied smile. It wasn’t often that one could catch Sherlock unawares. He’d been nervous about this before but now he was enjoying himself.
“Yeah. That’s great. That helps how? Who will want to bond with a sterile Omega?” John put his head down so that the doctor couldn’t see the tears in his eyes.
It was true. Although there didn’t seem to be any blood visible, John’s arm dangled from his injured shoulder. He was breathing shallowly when he finally reached their side.
“Both Harriet and your grandfather assumed that you were their child. He’d raped Harriet often enough to make that a reasonable assumption. I’m sure you’ve wondered why your “sister” hates you. You represented the result of a rape by a stranger, at best, or your grandfather at worst. And as it turned out, they were both wrong.”
“I know that you’re a kind man with strong morals. You’re a doctor and very caring individual. I know that you were a surgeon in the army but were invalided out after being shot in your shoulder. I’m not quite sure where you served though. Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“I’m glad to hear it. Here, let me help you with cleanup. Turn around.” Placing a hand on Sherlock’s arse for support, John slowly rose to his feet, joints cracking, back aching. Picking up his coat, he separated the lining and finding an unused section, began cleaning Sherlock with the silky material.
“Still, it seems to be more than that. Although you were often on the frontline repairing soldiers as soon as they were injured - with an almost preternatural success rate - your work up said that you were calm under pressure and could take anything thrown at you so I seriously doubt that your fear of being approached unexpectedly from behind is related to your time in the service. It seems fairly ingrained. Rough childhood, eh?” Sherlock finished.
“So that means your contributions are worthless? You looked out for me. You tried to warn me but I wouldn’t listen. Hell, Mycroft didn’t even listen…”
“That’s convenient. Tell me where he is and I’ll beat the answers out of him myself.” Sherlock said angrily.
John, having already taken care of himself, returned from the loo with one very warm - bordering on hot - flannel and began to gently wipe the residue of their love making from Sherlock’s body.
John slid into the seat across from Mycroft in the limo while the driver shut the door. He looked angrily at his feet.
Smiling down at John, a sudden intense possessiveness fell over Sherlock: He’d kill anyone who dared lay a hand on his Mate, he vowed. Then he slowly fell asleep, happily wrapped in each others arms, both dreaming. John of their next kiss, and Sherlock of keeping John safe from all harm.
Seeing John immediately head home, Sherlock was embarrassingly caught off guard and had to shuffle to get out in time to keep an eye on John.
“What? Right here? We haven’t any lube here,” Sherlock protested with a quick glance over his shoulder at John.
John kicked off his shoes, pealed off his socks, and had his trousers removed completely all in under 60 seconds.
He’d known the other two scents instantly - certainly morphine was a no brainer - but he had no idea what the lidocaine had used been for. Sherlock dropped everything back into the bin and picked up a piece of blood soaked gauze and sniffed. Definitely John’s blood. A lot of John’s blood. Had he been injured trying to escape?
"Well, my cock seems to have a mind of its own and you've already seen its interest in you. Why fake it?
They heard the wheels in the hallway stop in front of the room and then Harriet was brought in looking decidedly pale and exhausted from giving birth.
“Ok. That’s enough. I can’t take it anymore. Hook up an IV and get some fluids into him so that we can flush that god awful sedative out as quickly as possible,” Moriarty handed the tube to Moran.
“No one in their right mind wants to be left alone with Sally. Other than Anderson which makes perfect sense.”
The Doctor was now standing only an arms length away. He must have been too engrossed in his thoughts. That’s why he hadn’t noticed Watson move, he assured himself. It still left him with a slight feeling of unease.
Pulling back John’s shirt collar, Sebastian opened the small packet in his hand and used the slip of gauze saturated in alcohol to wipe a spot on John’s shoulder with it.
With a crook of his finger, John made a casual pass over Sherlock’s prostate. Never lingering long enough to do more than frustrate Sherlock and cause his cock to harden.
Irene looked up from viewing an accounting report on her iPad and saw Sherlock Holmes standing by the counter, waiting for an escort to his latest…what? Victim? Test case? He had a very specific request and although she had a large male staff on hand, he’d been through a third of them already. It was becoming more and more difficult each visit to take him as a client. They’d seen the bruises, blackened eyes, and sprained wrists that a session with Sherlock Holmes could cost them both physically and financially and determined that it was too costly ton continue. The majority had come to the conclusion that it wasn’t worth the money to try and satisfy the insatiable, and it was a lot of money. However, she never forced anyone to take a client. Irene felt that your work should be pleasurable, otherwise why bother?
Although in a awkward position, they soon set of a mutually pleasing rhythm consisting of frantic thrusts and withdrawals.
Mrs Watson held her hand out to John and helped him sit on the bed where she sat down next to him and took his hand in hers.
Without taking his attention away from what he was doing, John slid his hand up and grabbed the lube that he’d placed within reach earlier.
“Well, a high percentage of dead bodies in the morgue are male. Maybe you’ve been comparing yourself to a corpse but I don’t think that’s an appropriate gauge for penis size.”
“And there it is. Probably should head over to the A & E and have them put that shoulder back into the socket for you. Now, if you’re done…” John turned to leave.
He could hear Sebastian rummaging through lab containers until he found what he was looking for: a body bag. John’s eyes widened.
Sod it. John knew without a doubt that he was free of STIs. If either of them was in danger of contracting something from the other, it was John, and it was fine. He knew the risks; he accepted them.
Now, however, John Watson crawls into bed after him, presses his chest against Sherlock’s back, and tugs gently at the hair at Sherlock’s nape until Sherlock’s neck is bent back, his head resting against John’s shoulder—and suddenly sex has a very, very strong allure indeed.
John took a sip of his coffee—although it was still too hot by far and burned the tip of his tongue—before he answered. “I beg your pardon?”
Oh, yes. Her clit was swollen, a warm little knob nestled between her labia, peeking from its hood. Putting her finger directly over it made her thigh muscles twitch unpleasantly.
Yes, that’s precisely what I mean by ‘play style’. And rest assured you’ve not wasted your time. Knowing the distribution of your skill points does mean something to me, thank you. :)
It feels as though Sherlock’s heart swells in his chest. Larger than his lungs, larger than his whole body even. He curls himself even tighter around John, cradling John’s head against him, his fingers mapping all the bones of John’s skull: frontal, parietal. Oh, the parietal. The shape of it moulds perfectly to Sherlock’s palm.
, she thought, but didn’t say. John didn’t approve of overt signs of possessiveness, but there was nothing to stop Sherlock from displaying them in the safety of her own mind. Nothing to stop her from watching the silver base of the dildo grow shiny with John’s wetness and thinking,
John laughs, the sort of laugh that Sherlock typically enjoys—it means that Sherlock has succeeded in bringing a beam of light to his thoughts, as John often does for him—but this time the sound only puzzles him.
The bedroom was almost, but not quite, as he’d left it. Dark aside from the single lamp he’d left lit, empty aside from Rosie who hadn’t moved in her cot. The door was wide open, though, and the air was cold and smelt faintly but distinctly of Claire de la Lune. John breathed it in and stared at Rosie’s tiny, sleeping body as he steeled himself, lifting his chin.
The new resident arrived one clear afternoon, the heat tempered by a breeze from the sea. Sherlock learned out an upper window when he heard the car crunching on the gravel drive, watching dispassionately as a young man stepped out to oversee the unloading of his belongings.
It shamed him to admit that her calmness grated on his nerves at times. She rarely had strong opinions. She never raised her voice. Not even when she found the photos and bundle of letters from Sherlock while cleaning one day. She simply left them on their bed, the ribbon tied neatly around the stack of envelopes.
Sherlock slumped against the desk, spent, as John licked him clean. He rose to his feet, finding Sherlock's mouth. “Still jealous?”
They walked down the carpeted hallway and back toward the spa, every nerve in John’s body heightened. They turned into another hallway where the changing rooms were located, the area now dim and deserted. John watched Sherlock turn the knob on one of the doors, then disappear into the small cubicle. He followed, his heart pounding, the door clicking shut behind him.
They turned and began the walk home in an uncomfortable silence, John with an angry frown on his face.
The doctor felt truly sorry for Mrs Watson. She had no control over her own household but she loved her son and should be able to see him.
“I know.” Sherlock replied smugly, looking at the clock. Sixty seconds to spare. ‘No longer a young man. Eh?’
“This is one experiment that I’d be more than happy to assist in as many times as you deem necessary. Almost forgot. How were you able to come untouched? That’s the unknown variable for me here.”
“I don’t have agents in St Bart’s. It’s unnecessary. A code is required to enter the lab which is the only way to gain access to the morgue. And the door from the morgue to the hallway opposite is exit only - no one’s getting in that way either. You’re mating instinct is making you emotional and overprotective, Sherlock. Pull yourself together; you’re making a fool of yourself.”
“Ok. Well. You know that Moriarty has John. Of course you do! That’s why I’m here. Well, Jim might have sipped a teensy, tiny bit more than he ought to, of John’s blood.” Becca let a little more of the drug flow.
“Without lube, Sherlock. Without anything. Spit, petroleum jelly, lotion, nothing. I can’t do that to you.”
“Well, to be honest, by the time I got to the part where I fucked you on the floor, I was too distracted by my hard on to finish reading it. Where is it?” John asked, making a minimal effort to lift his head up and look around.
“Would you mind letting Harriet know that we’ll be waiting for her and the baby, please?” Elizabeth said as she tried to hand the baby back to the nurse.
“He’s fine and he quite likes that word, actually. I’d best catch up. Let us know what you find out. Ta,” John said, turning on his heel to catch up with Sherlock. He wasn’t done with him yet. Not by a long shot.
Sherlock groaned in relief but didn’t do anything other than let his arms relax. He wasn’t sure if he was allowed to get up now.
“Not as much to do tonight for some reason. Reckon it’s due to the long weekend coming up,” Sebastian said, handing John his coffee.
“I’m slightly above average in looks, John. My brain is my true gift,” Sherlock said matter of factly.
“I read your file. Is this about your inability to have children? I’m not asking for a commitment right now. I don’t even want children.”
