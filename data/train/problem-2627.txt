John made a surprised sound. “You got… promoted?”
“…Okay, okay. Please, if you need anything, tell me. I will come, I promise.”
“Don’t put words in my mouth! Since when do I treat you like an omega? Your second gender has nothing to do with this argument! I ask a very simple thing! Don’t. Leave. Me. Behind!”
Mummy was mostly angry, Father seemed to be the only one who was worried for Sherlock's safety. So, no surprises there.
Playing with Sherlock’s hair, he felt he needed to be sure his feelings came through to the detective. For a genius he could be so oblivious sometimes…
“Leave your coat here. Can't have the beeper with us. And hide your face behind your hair.” He pulled the tie from her hair. Moments later, they walked down the hallways of the A&E, the only people they met on their way patients Sarah didn't know and a nurse that hurried past them. Sarah didn't dare to look at them.
A tap on the door.
NO BETA
“Moriarty is trying to do just that. He wants to destroy our reputation and he wants us to give in to the pressure of the public criticising our lives. How could a funny little thing like love stand against the prejudice of a nation?”
Guess what number one on Sherlock's list is :D
Sherlock threw a sofa cushion against the wall in frustration, because all he could think about now was that child growing inside of Sarah instead of his sexy boyfriend sleeping just two rooms away. He got to his feet. They would worry about this enough once John called Sarah back and Sherlock wanted at least a cuddle before that.
“JOHN! Just… Fuck! …Uh, just get naked for fuck sake! I want to touch you! Why do you have so many layers!”
“IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, SHERLOCK.” John covered his face with his right hand. “If you do that people will blame me. They will say I tried to force you into something, or that relationships between Alphas led to suicide because they are unnatural. They'll destroy me, take Leanna from me and in the end, everything will be worse. Objectively.”
Leanna didn’t let go of him for the rest of the day and he was happy to cuddle her for hours.
Pregnant…He hadn’t thought about this possibility…Should have, really…He was a doctor, he knew the chance to make a baby, especially in a provoked heat where chances were higher than in any other intercourse… Pregnant…
“Your little sister.” Sherlock smiled at Leanna.
“Sherlock!” John was whining but he was too desperate to care.
“Yes, more than okay. Perfect!”
“John, will you please tell me what’s the problem? I had a call telling me you were not your usual calm self. You had several fight with your colleagues and your patients! So yes, I am asking again, what happened?”
Leanna ran towards him and he picked her up. He had been convinced he would never see her again and now that he could bury his face in her neck, take in her familiar scent, he shed a tear that was joy and grief at the same time.
They went into the house where a little boy, about 11 months was crying in his father’s arms. “I don’t understand why he keeps crying like that, as soon as I calm him, he starts again”. John did a brief examination on him but didn’t find anything physically wrong. Sherlock came over and whispered, “I think he is afraid because he doesn’t recognize his father’s scent. Look at his nose, the idiot father must have eaten curry, its components interact with the chemical in the scenting gland. He should give him the old sweatshirt from his car, it contains his smell.”
John was not as anxious as Christmas day about giving his presents to Sherlock. He was quite proud of himself to be honest. He worked part-time at the A&E to give him more time with Sherlock and his cases. John love investigating with Sherlock and witnessing the brilliance of his brain was not something he was willing to pass up. To be honest, he also wanted to be there to assure the detective’s protection, Sherlock tended to be reckless and not always conscious of the risks he took when he was in case mode. And now that Leanna regularly went to her Nanny Molly, John had had time to make his gifts more or less secretly…
John went back to his bedroom and fell asleep quickly. His last thoughts were that he should trust his instinct more. Sherlock was a very interesting person, for the first time since his return; he thought someone could easily become his friend, a very good friend. Sarah had won that with perseverance and time but Sherlock… John would give it to him without question. Life still had some surprises for him after all.
This though made John paused.
“No.”
“Violet, please.” Siger stepped closer to his wife, laying a calming hand to her shoulder. She brushed it off and he turned away again like a beaten dog.
“What is it? A
Sherlock woke up to the feeling of their mattress moving and the sounds of giggles. He remembered John getting up earlier, first bringing Malo to their bed as the little one had woken up around five and then Matilda an hour later. The twins had their own rooms at Sarah’s and Molly’s flat, but they stayed over at least once a week, which was easy now as their cribs fit into their bedroom. Once they were older Leanna had offered to let them sleep in her room once in a while.
She opened the door. “God, Jim said I should text you, that coming here in person would be too risky. But I just had to see your face. Poor, little , heartbroken genius. Can't wait to toture you with my presence for the rest of my life.”
The man, a beta if he trusted the lack of scents, looked at him, no, not just looked, scanned him.
The heavy morning sickness was normal, the hormonal imbalance and heavy changes her body was going through would be difficult as Sarah was not bonded and not living with the alpha.
“You WHAT ????” John shouted, “How could you… Sherlock… He won’t buy it!”
“Yes, yes, John!”
“He will be alright. Your son will be alright.”
“We shared a heat but it was an accident. John has another partner and I am single. I want to keep the baby and John will be there to help me as much as possible. As a friend and future dad. We won’t bond but he and his partner will help me raising the child.” Sarah said frankly and succinctly. But John could see that if she appeared calmed and self-assured, her hands were shaking on her lap.
When John climbed the stairs, he found a chaotic living room, they were cartoons everywhere. What the hell!
“Left her with Mrs Hudson before coming up, I hoped you would want some… privacy…”
no beta on this one. English is a second language for both of us, so bear with us please
Deliberately, Sherlock cupped John's face and he kiss was soft, reassuring, calming. For a moment, they just held each other, like they had in the living room (just with less clothes). John was the first to move, stepping out of his pants and socks and Sherlock fell to his knees to kiss and lick his stiff cock. The taste of it was so well known to him by now and he couldn’t get enough. Carefully, he manhandled John into lying in the middle of their bed. He continued sucking him, bobbing his head in a slow rhythm.
“I do. The Alpha part in me doesn't want anything more than to pin you to the mattress and fuck you, hard. But do you know what I want, more than anything?”
“You always compliment me, my beautiful John. My strong Alpha. Lift your hips for me, please?”
“I want my husband back! I want my life back!”
“I love you. God, Sherlock, I love you so much. I wish I could...”
Much more than force and rage fulfil.
Now betaed by Justbecause ^^
“Yes, you. I am lucky to have your heart Sherlock. I want to keep it. Better even, I want to deserve it. I want… I want you to know how vital you are to me. I can’t imagine living without you Sherlock. I love you. So much.”
“Violet, her name is Violet… I will explain everything to you later Sarah, don’t worry, she will be taken care of. Now, now you need to focus on you. Breath Sarah, slowly. I promise to explain, but just breath for now. I am coming with you to the hospital.”
“Wait, Sherlock. It's four in the morning. Give me a minute.” There were the sounds of rustling sheets and the DI yawned. “Do you need this for a case?”
“That’s impossible! I saw myself you going to the omega’s flat while she was in heat! I made sure her heat’s suppressants were inactive! You’re lying! So fuck off and let me have my life and project back!”
“You’re in the medical sector?” John asked.
“Mycroft?”
“I asked Sherlock to come. He refused, preferred to go to Bart. An experiment.”
“You, You Sherlock! I need you!” John exhaled while Sherlock began to suck his neck. “You're marking me.” John stated, his hand going to caress where he had left his own bit mark on Sherlock's neck the day before.
Slowly, Sherlock got up, kissing her forehead. “I will talk to him, my clever girl. Sleep well, love.”
“John” the deep voice seemed to reverberate inside him, making him feel weak.
“Hospitals can be a scary place. I’m not sure we should go there, little lioness. Not yet.“
The women giggled, as he led his wife to the kitchen. All smiles were gone, as soon as the door closed behind them.
His hand wandered down without him making the conscious decision to do so and he wrapped his fingers around his cock, stroking it slowly.
Sarah was long gone when John left and went back to Baker Street. The walk would help to organise what he wanted to say. He may had some questioning about himself to seriously do. He was possessive and he didn’t like not knowing where Sherlock was. And the way he had ordered Sherlock to not leave for a case without him… Perhaps a bit not good… He could ask Sherlock to meet him, Leanna wasn’t home, perfect moment. He would apologise… Ask Sherlock what exactly he was doing that was overbearing… If he made compromises, the detective may do some too, they would find a new ground, a more equal one…
“Papa and Daddy always find the bad guys.”
“Objectively, it is the best option. There would be no problem without me.”
John saw that some of the people had their phones, filming what happened… It was the end. He would never be able to work as a doctor ever again. He could be prosecuted for that… What of Sherlock and Leanna?
Leanna was more and more talkative, she had thrived during the 6 months she lived with him at Baker Street. John felt proud of his little elf, she had insisted about the costume this morning,
There. This was... John. Sherlock breathed in, a mixture of gun powder and tea and alpha that went straight to Sherlock's groin. This was perfect. He had done it.
“…Why? What happened? I thought you liked your job?” John finally asked, still under shock. “Why you didn’t tell me! No more secret, that’s what we said!”
(See the end of the chapter for
And that had been the end of the discussion.
“Oh I wouldn’t count on the great Sherlock Holmes to save you. We broke him, he won’t even think about searching for you here.” Henry gloated.
John got up and took the baby from her, putting him into his crib.
“How did Moriarty know?”
“Yes, I am in love with her, John, really in love. And for once, it’s just wonderful. She is an alpha, I had some prejudiced about it, I can admit that now. But she is a very patient and loving person, John. She helped me with my…problem with the alcohol. I have been sober since 5 months. And we talk, you know, really talk.”
While they walked to Sarah’s flat, John thought about what Sherlock had told him. They hadn’t talked about his place in Leanna’s life exactly, didn’t give it a label. But it seemed Sherlock already considered him as a role model. John felt himself blush at the thought.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, we should, oooh, do that again! Hmm, we, …we should calm down…”
Lifting his head, Sherlock pressed a kiss to the corner of John's mouth, as Leanna started, well, attempted to braid his hair. “I have no doubt that you will be a more than adequate father and I am sure Leanna agrees with me. The love you have for a child that is not yours, a child that you have known for six months, imagine how much you will love your own.”
He smiled around John's prick as the doctor reached for the night stand, fumbling for the lube. He almost threw it at Sherlock and the detective hurried to open the bottle. Licking at the head, teasing the frenulum, he slowly traced his boyfriend's perineum until his index finger lightly pressed against his hole.
“Nothing. I am serious John, I am just telling you because, well, you’re technically the father. But I don’t want you to do anything.”
Sarah had been very… stunned by the news. Like him. They just hadn’t thought of it… Hearing two fast beating hearts. Dr Mirakian had been reassuring, they were doing fine, a little tiny but nothing alarming. Sarah was now at a very critical part of her pregnancy, she needed to be stress free, eat well, stay well rested… Not easy to do when you are a doctor in a stressful environment. Luckily, Sarah had some vacation to take and she had promised she would try and negotiate less hours works to make time for the foetus to grow a little more. A healthy mother and environment were primordial to assure good health for the babies. She will have to avoid at all cost any unbonded alphas in order to not disrupted her pregnancy, so she already only took betas and omegas as patients. Better safe than sorry.
“I will be there; I want to meet the girl who makes you happy and helped to bring back my sister!”
“Sure.”
“Oh, no need to worry, love. We aren't going to hurt you. And if you promise you won't make a sound, I can even take that nasty thing out of your mouth.”
Sherlock took a deep breath again.
They spent most of their days in Baker Street, but there were a few moments Sherlock would always remember of their first months together. Moments he saved in a special place in his mind palace, he considered the happiest in his life so far.
She hugged the nurses goodbye. They had been a huge support during the hardest time in her life, but she had to admit she wouldn’t miss seeing them every day.
“Confession? Oh.” And the detective flushed red at the realisation, making John laugh even more.
This is the edited and beta read version. Thank you to justbecause.
“Sherlock, love. Let me take Leanna to Mrs Hudson, and we will talk.”
Molly smiled, as she wiped her tears away and Leanna reached out for her. Her Nanny took the girl into her arms and as they talked, Sherlock spotted John coming from one of the rooms. Bag and flowers fell to the floor and within seconds Sherlock was in front of him. John’s arms came around him and Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck, his scent comforting.
John hugged him and for the first time in which felt like weeks they kissed again. The adrenaline from a solved case made Sherlock greedy, but the ting of the phone interrupted them.
Covering Sherlock's arms with his own, John snuggled closer, his body sleep warm and pliant.
“Stop. Rambling. Maybe I am. Maybe you just are an alpha who needs to stick his cock in someone to be satisfied.”
Had he stopped moving again?
The omega looked close to a panic attack and John hugged her.
John's hand found its way to his shoulder, a comforting weight.
He was recognized immediately, what felt like a hundred cameras going off as he walked towards the entrance. Reporters shoving microphones to his face.
The phone call ended, but a few minutes later Sherlock was alone again, as John went on a walk. And he had been the one to send him away, feelings made him do absurd things. He should have made him stay; beg him to not leave him. Sherlock wanted to shoot the wall again, but decided otherwise for Leanna's and Mrs. Hudson's sake.
“Well… To be fair you should thank Leanna too… She was my accomplice in organising the whole day! And she was an expert at keeping you occupied when I needed to do some research alone.”
“Leanna? Because you think I will let you have her? She is the Holmes’s heir, she will never be yours!” Suddenly, Janine paused and calmly continued, “Okay, you win. You can have Sherlock, for what I care! But give me the girl, you won’t have to bother with her, she will have everything in the Holmes manor, never lack anything she wants. I'm her mother after all. She should stay with me. And you can do whatever you want with my husband, I won’t interfere. Deal?”
“What? Are you mad, why are you speaking so loudly! Are you trying to give me a coronary?”
“Git.”
Sherlock took more cases and ignored his mother's complaints about it. He concentrated on his brain, as he had always done until Leanna's birth, because he felt his heart had shrunk in his chest.
Sherlock wasted no time and put on gloves, so he could have a look at the vehicle. He ignored the victim's wife for now. She had to be the wife, as she was currently being interviewed by Sally Donovan.
John's POV
It took a while, before Sherlock could add another finger and even longer, before the third, but he didn't become impatient with John for a second. He knew how difficult this was, especially for an Alpha.
Wet, tight heat engulfed the head of his cock and Sherlock groaned, holding back from moving too fast, from hurting John.
“John.” Sherlock took him in his arms in a powerful hug. Obviously, it was something that had worried Sherlock, John could feel him relax against him.
“John…” Sarah’s small voice, the desperation and need from it called to John. Something broke in his heart to leave Sherlock alone. But Mycroft was there too… And Sarah and the babies needed him to be able to heal. He had to go.
“…Of course I will stay. As long as you don’t bond with Sarah. I won’t be your…mistress. I am a selfish man, John, I want you all to myself.”
“Papapa,” Matilda squealed and he leaned over to kiss her too. “And happy birthday to you as well, little lady.”
“You know why we are here.”
Now, in his bed in Baker Street Sherlock loved his birthday, because under the duvet John Watson was bobbing his head in a slow rhythm and all was hotwetperfect. John had set the alarm clock to 5am just for this, just so he could wake Sherlock with a blow job.
“No.”
“Sherlock, I'm not patronizing you. I'm telling you the truth. Harry will NOT hate you. I already talk about you with her. She knows you are a genius, that you can deduce people and sometimes be a prick about it. But most of all, she knows you are very important to me.”
John was happy. He felt positively glowing. He had been happy before, but since they had made up and cleared some misunderstanding between them, John felt more free to let himself go with Sherlock.
They went through all the questionings and exams to assure the pregnancy and health of the carrier. John, seeing Dr Mirakian didn’t say anything derogative about them, no snide remarks, began to relax as did Sarah. The doctor predicted the delivery date between ends of July to early August, but as the pregnancy would be difficult, the chance of early deliverance was important.
“Harry you look beautiful! Here, a little gift for your better half” John gave her their present. Leanna had painted the wrapping paper herself.
“Really?” John’s reaction seemed to throw him off.
Sherlock looked out of the window.
He had played through so many scenarios about sex with John in his mind palace before while masturbating. And that had included anal penetration. Sherlock didn't care for his second gender enough to be hurt in his alpha pride if he was the one to bottom. To be honest, he rather liked the thought of John inside of him, owning him. God, he shouldn't think about that, not here, not now.
She followed her Papa. She had chosen to wear her red dress with glitter and fluffy tulle.
“I'm calm, because I need to be. My brain is my greatest asset and I need to think about a way to solve this. Our case. So I can't just let my emotions overrule my brain. Not even with our daughter in the middle of all of this.“
Sherlock kissed him and god, he loved kissing John every time a little more. Before John he had thought that kissing was ridiculous and tedious and that he would tire of it if he ever tried. No, kissing was his favourite thing next to murder.
John did and Sherlock fucked his face and the sound John made deep in his throat, God. Sherlock didn't hear himself cursing or the bed creaking, only the gurgling wet sounds of his cock in John's mouth.
“A chemistry set!!!” She squeaked, “Like Papa!”
“Shut up! It has nothing to do with second gender! You are a horrendous caregiver for Leanna. You haven’t even tried to know if she is fine! And what you did to me and Sarah, forcing us to share a heat we didn’t want! That’s rape, you bitch!”
“Sarah… How are you?”
Sherlock couldn't resist pressing kisses to her beautiful face, whispering facts about hands to her, as she slept.
“John. Are you alright?“
How do you guys like the advent calender so far?
“John.”
“What do you mean they don’t want to.”  John growled. Anger was his default emotion when he felt under duress… And it was too much… He had been under pressure too long for him to be able to control his temper anymore.
John's fist hit the wall, bruising his knuckles. “She would have a devastated father not being able to raise her, no matter how hard I'd try. I love her, but I'm not doing any of this alone. But if you want the objective view: If you kill yourself...
Shit.
“Oh my god, Sherlock, I think you just sucked all my brain cells!” John finally said panting.
A shiver took hold of her body and she covered her belly in and instinct to protect the twins. They didn't even have names yet and there was a chance they would die here in a room with floral wall paper and old, musty furniture.
“Oh my god. Sherlock, I am just so angry! This worm stole my pack once and he is trying to do it again. I want to kill him slowly, make him regret ever going against me!”
“Jacket.”
“Next, you will need to be careful with your body, and I mean it” Dr Mirakian insisted looking intensely at Sarah, “to keep this foetus, you must stay away from too much stress and tiring shift. But most important of all, you must stay away from unbonded alphas. Your body is already going through many changes and it will be perturbed by any unbonded alpha’s scent if you stay in their presence too long. Your body could be triggered by the pheromone and provoke a miscarriage to make your womb available to a new potential mate.”
“John.” He kissed his cheek. “Is everything alright?”
“It’s a good theory, but she is already asleep by the time you want me to come to bed.”
https://arianedevere.livejournal.com/46716.html
Sherlock pressed his mouth to John's, trying to emphasize he had already forgiven him. This wasn't John's fault.
“I think... I think something happened to her.”
“Of course what? You are doing it on purpose?”
“If you need me, I’m just next door.” Matilda told him before running to her friends. She was always so full of energy, never shy and quite outgoing. Malo envied his sister’s easiness to make new friends… He had often heard his aunt Harry saying Matilda was exactly like their father John when he was a kid himself. She had the same blondish hair too. Malo was red haired and even if his parents, his mothers in particular seemed to love the colour, he had learned that it was one more thing that made him stand out in school besides being unable to speak.
“Oh, John, are we dropping you off?” Molly asked.
“We should.”
Sherlock quickly left the bed, but not fast enough to avoid the cushion flying. John was a sniper, his aim was always accurate, “Git!”
He heard steps from the bedroom and looked up.
John’s heart broke. He could almost feel it in his body, the heavy sob and trembling body in his arms were like arrow piercing him through and through. All he could do was holding Sherlock against him, embracing him.
“Yes, go with Doctor Sweetie, Papa. Not hotel,” Leanna beamed, tapping her hand against Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock had reached the part of the book where the little bee met the little ant, when he heard Leanna's breaths had evened out and she was asleep, snoring lightly.
They spend the next minutes looking at their new family member as she looked back at them. Suddenly, Leanna jumped up.
He felt his heart Fall when he saw Sherlock accepting the offer.
“There you are, my favourite humans in the entire world.”
“Did I break you? So many compliments!” John joked.
“What?”
John frowned. “That is... 221C. Sarah and I were thinking she might move there with the twins, but it's in a horrible shape.”
John held his mate more tightly while he felt more guilt assaulting him. How could he have let the situation go out of hand so much, let Sherlock  feel insecure in addition to feeling the pressure of the responsibility in finding Sarah. How could he have doubted Sherlock’s feelings! He should have been able to see that he wasn’t so calm, that it was an act…
“Of course I will marry you!”
Into battle, maybe he could try making Sherlock change his mind about leaving him…the flat.
Sherlock had even taken him in his hot mouth while in the loo of NSY two days ago. That had been so exciting and the most brilliant thing he had ever been lucky enough to experience. Sherlock on his knees, swallowing him whole. John still didn’t know how he did it. He was, without bragging, quite big. Sherlock liked to touch and be in control while on case and John was oh, so happy to comply. And he had a very pliant and eager partner after the high of a successful case.
So, in the early afternoon, John accompanied them to King's Cross. Sherlock had wanted to avoid getting all emotional in front of hundreds of strangers and had said his goodbyes in the living room, holding Leanna close to his chest. He knew it was only two days and that his daughter would have a lot of fun and that she would be safe, but for almost six months he had spent every minute of every day with her. He would never be able to go back to seeing her once in a while as when he was with Janine.
Sarah and Molly were doing a great job, but were still grateful for the two (well, three) extra pairs of arms to rock the little ones to sleep or for John to take Malo to the doctor’s appointments. The chances Malo’s vocal cards could be restored were minimal, they just hadn’t developed due to the influence of the two unbonded Alpha’s. They all knew it, but somehow still held onto hope. Malo was still perfect, no questions asked.
“I want to be a doctor,” Leanna stated to Mrs. Hudson. “I can help people.”
“Sebastian Moran. I would recognize this scent anywhere. The bastard left it, marked this man with it for me! I am going to kill him!” He screamed.
“She's amazing,” John whispered, pressing a kiss to the detective's lips in a kiss that turned into more than the peck it had been intended. Slowly, they parted, foreheads pressed together.
As he walked over, she turned her face away. He smelled horrible, of current jam, gasoline and chlorine. His hands were soft as he turned her face towards him.
Sherlock texted Molly.
Harry looked at him with sadness and shook her head “No, I should go home. But call me, soon, okay? I want to know more about your life, and… I have things to tell you too.”
He hurried to her side, not bothering to turn on the lights.
They stood there in an awkward silence.
She turned to him, surprised.
John felt himself, as he progressed to Sherlock, turning from loving to more predatory. All this alabaster skin, not quite visible yet, hidden under the duvet. The detective must have fallen asleep while waiting for his return because he had adorable bed-head and the pillow had left some wrinkles on his beautiful face.
“You don't get it, do you? You will come back to the manor, for Leanna. Because if you leave, she won't see Mrs. Hudson or Molly or Mycroft ever again. Are you really doing that to her? Do you really think you are good enough to raise her on your own?”
“Sherlock! What did you do to the place! I’m warning you, young man, I’m adding the price of the furniture onto your rent !”
Sherlock smiled sadly. “Braveness. Is this me flattering myself? Telling me that this...” he gestures in the direction of Jim Moriarty... is being brave? Sacrificing myself is not brave. I don't want to die. I'm afraid, but I need you to have your children, to be a father to them and Leanna.”
Sherlock hugged him, which was difficult with two children between them. He wiped away a tear on John’s cheek, which was part yoy, part anxiety.
“Yes!!! Santa is the best! Do you like your gift too Papa?”
He had to do something, his instincts were screaming at him. But Sherlock was right, he couldn’t let fury and rage win over. His better chance to find Sarah in one piece was Sherlock and his extraordinary mind. John wasn’t stupid but he was not a detective, he couldn’t outsmart Moriarty. But Sherlock could. And he could help Sherlock. He could make sure the detective eat and sleep enough. Yes. He wasn’t passive. He could protect Sherlock even if it was unnerving to see him so cold. Sherlock needed to be detached. He wouldn’t pry.
After a little more 2 days of heat and hormonal frenzy… John could finally think again and stop reacting to Sarah’s pheromones… He was naked in a nest of sheets on the floor. Gradually, everything came back to his memory, Sherlock and their kiss, Sarah, then the heat’s starting, the door hermetically closed, no way to flee, and…
“Oh, it’s my cousin Bryan…” Kyle said.
“John... John, I'm sorry....,” he whispered, touching his own lips with his fingers, as if to keep the heat of John's mouth from fading away. It was all he would have from now on. The memory on an awkward kiss.
“Oh, yes. Sorry. Mr. Scott. How have you been?”
John kisses were slow and deep and oh so delicious, John a warm weight on top of him, small, strong hands in his hair and on his cheeks. Their legs were interlocked and Sherlock could feel John's erection against his hip, as his own pressed into the doctor's thigh. Still, they kissed without hurry, exploring the other's lips and mouth and tongue, Sherlock's arousal growing with every light touch, every suck and nibble.
The picture showed a car, the licence plate obviously visible.
“Chew before speaking and don’t run in the stairs!” John yelled after the little whirlwind!
Sherlock nodded. They would be just fine. Hopefully.
Another stab to the heart.
Biting her lip, she tried to grasp her beeper from her coat pocket, but there was something cold and metallic pressing against her back. A gun. She had never felt this before, but she still knew.
“Is it about Sherlock?” she tried.
Three chapters next week :D
Trust Sherlock to use long words even when he was in shock! Wait… What?
John came closer and Sherlock could sense he was annoyed. He didn't care right now. The annoyance got even more obvious when John retrieved the phone with more force than necessary.
Janine never told him he was forbidden to spent time with her, but she made clear that she was the omega and with that responsible for Leanna. She started excluding him from their daughter’s life and by the time the little one was three months old, Sherlock only ever saw her with his parents around or in the rare moments when Janine was in their flat at the same time as he was.
Sherlock sat down next to John and for a while the little girl managed to captivate the attention of two grown men (one of which is a genius) with the little things she was capable of.
“What more can I do?” Sherlock cried while punching the wall behind John. “In a sense it is indeed my fault. I am the target. Not you. Not Sarah. I am responsible, am I not? You will leave. You are already starting to hate me, blaming me. But I am trying. I promise you, I am trying the best I can to find them, to save them. I am trying to make it alright again… I…”
So now, Moriarty refused on a compromise with the ex-soldier. They would use the same technic as he had already done. Find a way to make him leave Sherlock; remove him forcedly from the equation. And it would be such a sweet revenge for her!
“…Not good?”
They took a cab to the café and sat down in the corner furthest from the windows. He ordered tea for himself and a hot chocolate for Leanna, who had already gotten her colouring book out of her backpack. The little one loved colouring and spent half of her time doing it. Right now she was working on a book with forest animals, giving a hedgehog a pink, purple and blue spine.
John had laughed until his belly hurt.
“Would you…do you want to dance? With me? I am not a good dancer though…”
“Hum, well war stuff… I don’t really like talking about it” He paused a moment and finally continued “Is there something particular you want to know?”
“I let you be in charge in bed John, but I won’t let you do it out of it! I let you fuck me, but I won't let you rule over me.“
They kissed clumsily and without any finesse, sharing hot breath and swallowing the other's moans.
John turned around to go and open the door and Sherlock, having a bad feeling, went upstairs with Leanna. She knew her Papa well enough to know that some things were only for adults and he was so grateful for her understanding.
“What do you mean exactly?” John felt the anger building inside him. He had to control himself, Janine hadn’t say anything yet about the heat’s suppressant…
Sherlock smiled, making his way to the living room.
“Mostly”, Sarah chuckled, “I am still in contact with my father and a cousin. But, just…How could you deduce about my ex-husband, how could you know about that?”
“Really? Again? You dog!”
“He’s not my father, he is My John” Leanna responded very seriously, before John took her in his arms and snuggled against him. “I am sorry, I just wanted to see the big candy.”
“Mummy?“ Sherlock forces the question out.
Harry and John were smiling fondly looking at them, having an intense conversation about bees.
“He's staying with us. We are a family. Sarah and the baby will be an addition and to be honest, I don't exactly know how we are going to manage that, but we will not lose Daddy.”
Sherlock had just gone to the loo and walked back to their table when he stopped. There they were sitting, his whole family, laughing and telling stories and it almost looked a little cliche, like one of those christmas ads on the tely. They weren’t always peaceful. Matilda and John often budded heads and Malo had refused to speak with Sarah for a while when he was sixteen, but they loved each other deeply, even more so because some people still thought they were weird.
Sherlock exited the car without a word, making his way inside the apartment building. Sarah was home, his brother's agents still standing guard at her door. The police had already questioned her, but Sherlock was confident to find clues on James Moriarty. Those idiots had suspected John at first, which the most obvious scenario if the alpha weren't John Watson. They had even interrogated the doctor, but Sarah had given her statement and they hadn't even taken John to the police station.
“Of course you are,” John said, “I think I also hit my head when I fell.”
“I don't know ...they’re just a pair of ...Trainers.”
“I would love to…but I think Leanna will wake up soon… Later?”
“Yes. Sherlock gave me a spray with your alpha’s scent and pheromones to help with the pregnancy. He gave me Molly’s number. Advised that I could talk to her to help me prepare for the future babies…” Sarah explained.
Sherlock wanted to lick every part of John's skin to get rid of every single molecule of Sarah's scent and replace it with his own.
“Cleaning, Leanna. Yes, we will put everything back.”
Ten minutes later, John was running outside the building, one shoulder dislocated but a small price to pay to break free from his ropes. He was after all in better shape than Henry, actually unconscious on the floor. The man would be in need of medical attention but it really wasn’t his priority.
“You can't take this away from her, Mycroft.” The detective folded his hands under his chin, watching his brother intensely.
“Papa?”
John and Molly looked at each other. The Alpha turned the shoe in his hand. “that’s it, how did we do?”, John asked.
The cry from Molly made John hurry back to the room… where he found Molly holding a paper with trembling hands.
A door opened and closed and steps were coming closer.
“Hi. You are Sherlock, right? John told me to bring this little one over, while they are still working on number two. She’s all healthy and just needs a cuddle.”
Sherlock opened his eyes at his little speech, “You don’t have to apologise for being human and having emotions John.”
“Oh Sherlock.”, Jim walked across the roof, always moving, never standing still. “Always so grumpy. I thought the little doctor was the grumpy one. Never mind. This has been fun. I always loved games and with you, I found someone worth playing with. It wasn't my intention from the beginning, because your omega failed to tell me about how clever you really were. You enjoyed the games too , didn't you?”
But just when John had found a new ground, Moriarty found the way to make him fall one more time. Seeing Sarah’s photo, John was seeing red. The omega was obviously distressed, she was abnormally pale, her arms protectively around her belly.
John was flabbergasted, he didn’t expect that. Maybe he was prejudiced too after all and while watching Karin go back to her job, he did feel a little better. Maybe, he wouldn’t become a complete outcast.
“I called Malo,Thilda and Mama. I made a reservation for tonight, Angelo’s. I thought we should celebrate.”
Sherlock entered 221B three hours after he had left. A faint of Janine's lavender smell in the living room made him stop abruptly. He should have expected it, but it was a reminder that Janine had just walked into their home again, without any hesitation.
“Mycroft, how convenient of you to come now!” Papa sneered, “Here, I save for you the biggest piece!”
“Oh you marvel! You absolute genius!” John then went to inform the worried father.
“No, Clara has a lot of knowledge about bees. I am impressed! But she is gone now and I am already bored…”
“Unintentional confession it seems! But Sherlock, you were wrong.”
“His arm?” God, how had Lestrade made it to DI of New Scotland Yard? This was so obvious.
Sherlock took a deep breath, trying to calm down. “Alive?”
“John, excuse me, I am not mocking you! It’s just…Well, I thought it would be more serious than that, excuse me.”
“Thank you,“ John whispered. “I love you. Can’t wait to see you.”
Eighteen rounds of sex, below average for an Alpha/Omega couple during heat. Sexual satisfaction on both sides. Most of the encounters had taken place in the bed, except for the last two or three, John's shoulder ached from it.
Sherlock pushed the small button and the back of the watch opened to reveal a little compass. But there was a second pointer besides the indication to the North that was pointing to Sherlock.
“Papa, there is a baby who don’t stop crying. Maybe you can help?” asked Leanna.
A Wonderful fic by my online best friend, Ember88. Thank you :D
“How about you eat a little bit,” he gestured at the plate on her night stand, “and I go and pack a few more things.”
John frown reading it. Shopping? With Leanna? The detective hated shopping and only did it willingly if John came… and he would still complain… John had surprised Sherlock and Leanna whispering between them, they were definitely plotting something together, it was cute. He had no idea what it could be… But well, he was free to do whatever he wanted this morning, he was going to enjoy the calm!
Sherlock tried his best not to get angry, he really did. He should be used to her ignorance of anyone that wasn't her. She had planned a party, invited almost a hundred people and forgotten the cause, had forgotten about the day she had given birth to her child three years ago.
John hadn’t really thought about marriage before. Why would he torture himself with something he couldn’t have? Now however… It would be great to reaffirm his love and commitment to Sherlock. The detective was always a bit insecure, John had never completely succeeded at eradicating his doubts and insecurity in Sherlock’s mind. A bond mark would never be possible although they did mark each other with love bite and bruise as leftovers of their love making
“I still have my beta persona when outside Baker Street, and the risk is minimal while she doesn’t go to preschool.”
“John”, Sherlock’s voice was dark and heavy from arousal, “John, can I?” Sherlock’s hand had migrated to John’s bottom and was shyly asking, probing at his vulnerable entrance.
“I thought it would be fitting. Botulinum toxin. It will be fast, faster than you deserve. Sarah will be free the moment of your last breath, your last heartbeat.”
“Stop John. Even if we had talked after Leanna went back with Molly, you would have received this text and you would have gone to see what Sarah needed because you’re a good friend and a good alpha. It’s the past. Don’t beat yourself. Neither Sarah nor I do it. So don’t. We love each other, that’s all I need.”
The army paid for his arm re-education and therapy, courtesy of the Queen for good service. But now that the physical aspects of re-education were over, those visits to Ella were more and more difficult. And honestly, he didn’t feel particularly better after… A small voice in his head said it would maybe be more effective if he told her all his feelings and not just some of them but he quickly silenced it. No more self-pity! He had a move to prepare for, not that he had a lot of stuff but it still had to be done and would be a nicer thing to think about…
“Daddy?” Leanna whispered “Malo is asleep now.”
“Ah, yes, sure.” Sherlock hurried to open the first four buttons and the nurse placed the baby against his chest.
After resetting his shoulder, Sherlock was still obviously distressed. John would never had thought such emotionalism laid hidden beyond the cold mask he wore most of the time. Watching the man’s emotions about his death awoke a hope John had believed buried.
There were lists on the internet on the signs of sexual attraction. Racing heart, need to touch them and yourself, being 'hot and bothered'. Sherlock put those in a list and he would choose a scale from one to five. He hoped John would generate a lot of fives. God, he was way too biased; this wasn't even close to being a scientifically correct experiment.
The end of the afternoon was spent without anything worth mentioning. John talked to his parents for a while and reassured them about his return to civilian life. They were impressed with Sherlock and there was this knowing light in his mother’s eye when she spoke about the dashing man. She seemed, like Harry, quite sure about where this would end. If only John could share their optimism…
“No, mother. I was in a hurry and didn't have time for a shower after I shagged my alpha boyfriend.”
Molly looked stressed and Sherlock could see worry on her face. John's instinct seemed to have been right. This was more than just horrible traffic.
They had pancakes for breakfast and after the ever patient Molly got Matilda and Malo to put on clothes. John and Sherlock went over to their own flat for a while to get ready for the day and then their whole pack made a trip to the London zoo.
John had begun to write a blog about their adventures like his parents had suggested. But if there had been some good comments and supports, there had been several hateful ones too that he had censured. John knew he wasn’t handling the whole judgement and disapproval vibes they were subject to as well as Sherlock. He craved acceptance, to be considered as someone good for the society… It had been one of his motivations to enlist in the army. To protect… Sherlock didn’t believe in heros, he didn’t seek to be one and wasn’t even conscious he was one nonetheless. John had been a war hero, soldier and saviour… Before the scandal he had finally found a new identity that he liked, a good doctor and a warrior at Sherlock’s side when they went on cases together. The duality of his personality was thriving. But it had all stopped with their unwanted coming out. He lost his job as doctor as well as the cases with Sherlock. He had no ground to hold him anymore.
“Odysseus!”
“What a clever woman. Almost as clever as my little girl. How about you have your bath now, you've got dough in your hair. And I will talk to John later and ask if we can stay longer, okay?”
Janine always wore her good omega persona, but now that her husband had threatened her plan, she wasn’t afraid to drop the act where Sherlock was involved…
“That's wonderful, love. Good afternoon, Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock smiled at her, picking up the book they were currently reading. He knew the conversation about this wasn't over yet, he could see that in Leanna's eyes, but he was grateful she had dropped it for now.
Before John could reply anything, Sherlock went and took all the phones that had been filming.
Matter enough is here your faith to move.
“I’m so proud of you. So proud.”
At the insult, John growled and violently hit the other alpha, breaking his nose and probably cracked one or two teeth.
“Don't you dare call me romantic!”
“John.” Sherlock looked shocked, hurrying to his side. “You’re bleeding. That wasn’t part of the plan.”
“Hu… John,” Sherlock exhaled, “Yes, please…please!”
“Of course, Harry, I forgive you. You’re not the only one to blame you know, I, too, let things fester until I didn’t know how to speak to you anymore. I miss you too, Harry. I want to try.”
The man smiled. He was attractive, with broad shoulders and short, dark blond hair.
That you found them fascinating. I admit… I was a little surprised that I had no idea you loved the stars so much. So… I made some plans. We will be able to see several shows in the planetarium that Leanna should appreciate too. If she gets bored, they have child care and we will be able to visit the astronomy centre. I did some research about the solar system, I think I will be able to tell you some…”
“What do you mean?”
“Sherlock!” he moaned, “Leanna is just next door” he tried to faintly protest.
He called Mrs. Hudson and she told him Sherlock had been there only half an hour before.
The suddenness of his arousal made Sherlock dizzy and when they came to a halt in front of the bed, he had to take a few deep breaths. John would be warm and tight and no one had ever been there and Sherlock would be his first. Sherlock wanted to mark him again, make him his.
He opened one of the doors to his left, where the sound seemed to come from. shock made his breath leave his throat in a strangled sound.
“I don’t see your cane, your leg is better?” Harry noticed when he came back from the cashier.
John’s gentle hand on Sherlock’s cheek put a stop to this monologue. John’s anger was gone, only sorrow and guilt remained. Sherlock was suffering, probably more than himself and his anger had kept him from noticing.
“Oh, love. Jimmy wants to get to Sherlock Holmes. I wanted John Watson dead years ago. You are a key to both of them. So, little key, what we are going to do is walk up to the side entrance. Pretty little car waiting there for us. You are not going to scream or signal to anyone that you are getting... kidnapped is such a hash word, but yeah, that's what we're doing here... If you do, I'll shoot you in the belly. Kill your Babies. I don't care if I'm going to jail for it. So, it's being cooperative or a dead bastards. Understood?”
“I wouldn't ever, love. You are the least romantic person in the world.”
“Hmm, yes…ahem, yes, I like him.” John cleared his throat. He was beginning to be very wary of where this conversation was going.
The doctor exchanged a look with Sherlock, it was time.
It was one of the french children songs Siger had taught Sherlock when he was little. The detective smiled at the thought that it was now being handed on to the next generation.
“What do you mean?”
Violet seemed close to exploding, not a trace of the worried mother she was pretending to be to the journalists in her.
Malo liked school, most of the time. He learned new things everyday and Matilda was there to smooth things with the other children.
Her painted was progressing well, she had drawn Daddy and Papa and herself in Baker Street, the three of them standing aorund a big tree.
The doctor laughed, “Extraordinary! You are a Marvel ! But you haven’t answered me, Sherlock Holmes, would you please accept to marry me and make me luckiest bastard in the world?”
They ate in a comfortable silence, their hands intertwined on the table. The curry was already cold, it had taken Sherlock longer than expected to come home, but that was okay. They had each other now and Sherlock would have been okay with just eating plain toast if it meant spending time with John.
“You're back.” John mumbled.
John was furious. He was seething while going back to Sarah to accompany her to the second echography with her doctor.
“And you look good as well. I mean...Healthier. Happy. John must be a good man.”
“Violet, please, Sherlock isn’t responsible for my mistakes”
“John, you should be angry. Why are you not angry?”
“Papa is a detective!” Leanna little voice claimed.
“That was... strange. Is that how you... worked before we met?”
John’s cheeks were hurting from smiling so much. He was happy to spend some time with his detective, “Sounds perfect!”
“Yes, yes, Leanna and you are welcome here!” Now that all his worries were finally addressed, John couldn’t help teasing Sherlock a little.
He really didn’t want to let Sarah alone with having to explain their particular situation. Some doctors were prejudiced against some unconventional pairing, but the doctor didn’t need to know about Sherlock real 2nd gender. They were seeing doctor Mirakian, he had good reputation, but you never knew how people will react…
Sherlock looked at his older brother for the first time. Mycroft looked tired, emotionally drained.
He hugged his mother, then his dad. He hadn't seen them in forever, they travelled the world in their attempt to improve Omega rights. His mother told him about their stay in California, while Leanna was running around the venue again. She returned after a few minutes.
Sherlock wasn't able to sort through his feelings right now, pain searing through him in burning waves. John was with Sarah, having sex with Sarah, bounding her to him.
“Oh dear, John. What have you done? I told you not do dance on the kitchen table.”
Sherlock kissed him, wholly, without reserve. And John felt himself go, it was good to release everything to Sherlock, let him own his mouth, his tongue… He felt loved. Feeling Sherlock’s desire and possessiveness, John suddenly remembered what the detective had tell him about their sex life…
“Hmm. I'm gonna clean up and then we'll sleep a little longer. I promised Leanna she could be the one to wake you up with breakfast in bed.”
“Is it true the omega population in Afghanistan is very important? I heard almost all the girls are omegas and really respectful of Alpha authorities! You must have had a good time!” Roger was laughing so hard, his whole body was shaking and too occupied ogling the barmaid to see the dark look Sarah and some other people were giving him.
“I need my child.”
He had observed the pair of them while they were discussing with his sister. Maybe they could become good friends. He found it reassuring that all the people around Leanna learnt to appreciate each other. They all were his pack now. That they could be all friends would be the icing on the cake!
“Daddy's sad. A little bit angry, but sad. I don't like Daddy sad.”
“What?” John yelled spitting his tea.
“With you? A teenager! You’re better than any fountain of youth!” John was feeling high on feelings and love for this wonderful, perfect man that he was so lucky to be able to claim as his.
The pear fell to the floor, rolling underneath John's chair. Leanna jumped off the chair she had been kneeling on to retrieve it. She was the one to do that because he had stopped moving again.
Making John happy was intoxicating.
“She told me. I visited her after work and she told me.”
“Are you really giving me ways to spy on you?”
“Yes, yes, anything, John”
Sherlock kissed her curls. “They are, little lioness. We will find a flat as soon as you are better, okay?”
For a second Sherlock thought it might be Sarah. Maybe her phone was dead after all and she had made a spontaneous trip to her father's. Sherlock had never wished to be wrong so much in his life. But he knew deep down it was wishful thinking. He knew Sarah. She would never disappear without saying anything. In the few months he has gotten to know her she had presented herself as a well organised, caring and funny person and he liked her, acknowledged her courage to be a single omega mother. She would never leave, not so late in her pregnancy and not without telling her girlfriend. She would contact John if there was something wrong with the babies and she had to go to the hospital.
Clara was really charming, she made John feel like he had known her for a long time even though this was the first time they had met her. She had a PhD in advanced biochemistry and had written an article about
After a few agonizing seconds, Sherlock finally made eye contact. But his eyes were hardened and cold, “John. We have to stay calm and collected. We need to be able to think if we want to beat them and save Sarah. There is nothing to forgive. I know it was not really you talking.”
“We will need lube. It will make anal penetration easier. I have already done research on preparation. It will take some time for me to adjust, but I am willing to try.”
“…No, why?”
“Don’t stop!” The alarmed tone at the prospect of John stopping was very good for the soldier’s ego, so John began to place some small kisses to the sensitive area.
A few second later, John came back to his senses to watch Sherlock licked him clean. The sight could almost made him hard again. “Sherlock, come here” and kissed him tenderly, tasting himself on those lips, “Do you want me to…return the favour?” he tried seductively.
“Clara, you seem to like her very much…”
“John. I don’t care… Sorry, I mean… It doesn’t change my willingness to be there and part of their life… if you want me to…” Sherlock was hesitant now, not an expression John liked to see.
“Of course I am.”
Sherlock laughed, “You have made progress at observing. Hum… Here, there is a secret compartment I asked the clockmaker to add.”
Wandering deeper, Sherlock pressed his tongue to John's hole, softly and without the intention of entering him.
John intertwined their fingers. “I will, once I can stop thinking about … you know.”
Two hours later, with Mycroft and Anthea were sitting on the sofa like they didn't belong there at all and Sherlock was pacing from the fireplace to the coffee table and back.
“Really John? Pinkie promise?”
“Nineteen eighty-nine, a young kid – champion swimmer – came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament; drowned in the pool. Tragic accident. You wouldn’t remember it.”
“Why is John a tiger, Papa?”
He had only one secret left, Sherlock 2nd gender, but he felt it wasn’t something he should reveal just yet. With Janine's trial came the media frenzie, the less people knew, better were their chances to keep it a secret longer. He didn’t want to risk anyone making the link between Sherlock Holmes alpha and Sherlock Scott beta, living with Dr Watson. Sarah’s and John’s names had been kept secret from the Media, but who knew if there would be no leak in the future.
Sherlock grinned, kissing John one more time before he went into the kitchen to say hello to the girls.
If John hadn’t been so excited and drowning in his own lust, he would have chuckled hearing Sherlock’s commanding voice back again. But his mate was tensing with desire this time and John would never deny him.
His John.
“And I, you.”
He hadn't known before asking, but it was exactly what he needed, what he wanted right now.
“Not a very good threat John!”
“I'm sleepwalking,” Sherlock whispered and John's chuckle vibrated through him. Strong hands wandered down the detective’s chest and belly, parting the fabric of the robe, the only thing Sherlock had dressed in before sitting down to work.
Sherlock's birthday present: http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/112192741243-0-1/s-l1000.jpg
Thank you for all the lovely comments on the last Chapter.
He was just happy.
“Oh. John. You know how he is, probably thought he shouldn’t garner unwanted attention now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Leanna loved the aquarium and Sherlock had promised her they would go weeks ago. John would join them later on. Today was the first scan and John had been nervous all day, even Leanna had noticed and she had been... difficult. She had refused to eat breakfast and thrown a tantrum because she didn't want to wear a jacket, even though it was below zero outside.
“Good morning little Elf, come with me, we will find a place to put it. Papa is cooking, we shouldn’t disturb him. Cooking is a science from what I have heard!”
“Hmm”
Not John.
“Yeah, silly idea, I know. Wanted to be romantic.”
“Well… Today we learnt that it will be twins.”
“I know, love, I understand now. I knew but you were so … apparently detached… I doubt… I am sorry Sherlock. I won’t let Moriarty manipulate me. But we will have to learn to  communicate better.”
“Sooo, you said first that the three of us benefit from living together. You spoke about me and Leanna, what about you?”
Jim kicked the closest rubbish bin. “Listen, little shit. I got you out of Afghanistan before Mycroft Holmes could get to you. I will call you sweetheart whenever I want.”
“Home… Yes” Sherlock was returning the embrace when he heard Mrs Hudson and Leanna stomping up the stairs and quickly disengaged, feeling embarrassed, he wasn’t sure why. Friends hug each other.
Sherlock felt empty, the world seemed to have been swallowed by fog, which cushioned all the sounds. He heard himself trying to comfort his mother, but he couldn’t remember his own words afterwards.
“A bath?” But Sherlock had already moved to the bedroom. John was smiling so much it almost hurt.
Sherlock kissed her hair and his heart felt like it could burst with pain at any moment. “I don't want you to go, my love. I love you and I promised we would never be apart again. I mean that, Leanna, I do. But we need to help Sarah and the babies.”
“Well, I heard it is common to congratulate one's only brother for... getting older. As if that was your achievement.”
Violet exited the room in a fashion so similar to her youngest son's. Deep inside, Violet knew she had become bitter. But she had been this way for too long. She didn’t know how to be different. She was a Holmes before anything else all her life, she couldn’t be any different.
Right now, Mycroft cared for them. And Sherlock was more than grateful.
“It's... beautiful, thank you.” Rubbing his nose against John's neck as they sat on the floor, Sherlock took in his scent.
Suddenly, on the nightstand, John’s mobile phone began to vibrate; Sarah’s name appeared on the screen. Sherlock felt himself turn pale. What reason Sarah could possibly have to reach out to John at this time of the day? Time stopped for a minute, his overreacting brain went through all scenarios until just one could make sense. This was Sarah's private number, so it couldn't have something to do with work, else she would call from the clinic. John had avoided contact with Sarah, out of respect for her and because he didn't want to make Sherlock jealous. So why would she call now, three weeks after the heat?
“…Fine, considering… John, do you know what happened? I am, I am taking my pills, John, I swear to you! I wouldn’t have done that to you… and to me! I am not that desperate!”
“We still love you, Dad. Even if your not a genius.” Leanna reached into her purse and handed John a folded piece of paper. The doctor raised an eyebrow.
“Lady? Whose lady?” John saw first sign of Sherlock’s jealousy in his tone. It was more endearing than upsetting for him.
Leanna thought hard about what her Sherlock told her and finally said, “Hmm, like Papa, but different?”
“Your Mummy told me that and it makes me really upset.”
Snippets of a conversation taking place next to him, piercing the fog around him.
They were grinning like lunatics, and it was wonderful. John felt that if they could smile now, everything would be okay. They will be okay.
“Mmm?” John leaned over his shoulder to look at the shoes.
“Not me, he tried to, but Harry had my back then. So no, not me, but I saw the bruises on his little sister and he was always mean when there wasn’t adults around. His name is Hamish and he is the reason why I hate my middle name. Hamish, a traditional family name… And stop worrying about me being angry when you are deducing. I know you don’t have a filter then, and frankly, it’s refreshing. It’s one of the things I like about you! When I tell you to be careful about what you say it’s when other people are concerned, they don’t know you the way I do. But I can help with that, you’ll see!”
“Maybe, but it’s still not your fault Sherlock. Don’t excuse yourself, please. Love, you weren’t wrong. Come, you need to sleep, we both need to sleep, all of this is exhausting to all of us” John coaxed the tall man to their bedroom.
“Surprise birthday boy! Do you trust me with your body tonight?”
“Yes Molly. Moriarty doesn’t seem interested in hurting Sarah. He is a sick bastard who wants to make Sherlock’s deduction dance for him.” John was aware of the bitterness in his voice, but he couldn’t help it. It was so unfair.
“No. I have no problem. Can’t say the same about you though…”
John saw the Good Samaritan relax in front of the obvious ease of Leanna with the alpha, “Have a good day mister.”
Sherlock closed his eyes, thinking of three of the most important moments of his life.
“Let's just eat, love. I don't want to think about them anymore.”
And, as a proof on how desperate he was, he invited Mycroft for tea. Of course, he told his older brother he only wanted to know how the family was doing and he even listened when Mycroft told him. His parents concealed him going missing with quite a clever story. They told people that he was hiding from a powerful criminal, whose path he had crossed during a case and that he had taken his daughter with him to keep her safe.
John tasted blood before he felt the pain.
John chuckled and it was the most wonderful sound, so soft and without pain.
“John do you want to come out with us for drinks?” Sarah asked him.
“Thank you, love, they are beautiful! You made them?” He asked.
Now, he was using a new sample of John's scent which he had extracted from John's sweat, taken from his partner's temple as soon as he had fallen asleep. Sherlock hadn't told him about the experiment in fear of failing. This was important to him, would be important to them.
John got up from the floor, pointing to the sports bag on the sofa. “I thought we could do something relaxing. I could go watch the little one and you could get a massage.”
“What do you mean THE John Watson.”
John cut off the monologue to kiss him and who could blame him for the kiss getting a little bit too heated.

“Don't drag Leanna into this, Janine. Please. Torture me, if that makes you happy. But leave her alone. She suffered enough.”
“I wanted to give you something you lost because of the ambush in Afghanistan, I know it’s not exactly the same, but…”
Yesterday, John had asked Sherlock about going to the appointment with them, but it was something Sherlock felt the two of them had to do by themselves. They were the biological parents and three people were one too many in a gynaecologist’s office. Maybe later, Leanna could go with them.
“Sherlock! You’re cooking!” John just couldn’t believe the scene he was seeing.
It may had been easier if one of them were an omega, or even a beta. The instinct would be less overbearing or the dynamic would be easier…
“Of course you are. Snuggle in and listen.”
“Shh, John… It’s not your fault either! And maybe…” Sherlock tried to comfort…
“Thank you, love. This is wonderful.”
Second, his flatmate didn’t really respect any personal space with him anymore. John assumed that Sherlock thought, as they were two alphas, it wasn’t necessary anymore to be careful about personal space. It was a new torment. John didn’t dare say anything; what could he say exactly to make Sherlock understand he was torturing him without telling him he had unusual and unacceptable feelings…
Leanne looked up at him with big blue eyes, questioning, but at the same time she seemed to be excited about going on an adventure.
“How…Love, how do you want…” John tried to ask, the lust and sexual tension from his own alpha’s instinct beginning to be strained thin.
“I…Shit, there is no easy way to say it, so… I am pregnant.”
“Sorry. I'm sorry, Sherlock. I thought I was... ready, but I... it hurt and I... God, I'm sorry. I thought I was ready.”
John got close to them, one arms around Leanna while the other came protectively around Sherlock’s back. “It’s our little secret.” They stayed like this hugging each other a few minute before Leanna began to fell asleep in her father's arms.
They went to the stores and picked up groceries for once and because Mrs Turner’s family was over for a visit, Sherlock let Leanna play with the kids.
Sherlock cried some more, silently, as not to wake Leanna and in the morning he was grateful for Mrs Hudson, who had made breakfast for them.
There was Dr Harris' voice, giving orders as he cared for a man bleeding from a chest wound. He was the second best after John. John. She could see him in front of her inner eye, had watched him before, covered in blood, concentration on his face. His eyes would be squinted from concentration and nothing would keep him from doing his very best to save his patient.
“Mummy. I haven’t made Sherlock do anything since he was 4 years old” the older brother said, seemingly bored.
“Yes,” he forced himself to say. “She's almost three. And she loves stories.”
Once he was nearly all inside, John managed to stop himself. Heavy breathing, eyes closed, legs firmly, almost painfully locked around John’s waist, Sherlock was obviously dealing with pain or rebellious instinct or both…John had to know…
Sherlock had recognized John in the corner of his eye.
Leanna squeaked and for the first time, jumped into John’s arms. John felt a delicious warm feeling settling in his heart when the little girl squeezed him as fiercely as she could. He felt her shake, the uncertainty she had felt about her home must had been more unsettling than they had thought. He felt guilty not saying something earlier.
“I love her, Leanna. She's an angel. Can't believe she's related to you.” Sherlock felt John's smile against his forehead.
“Yes! I want to play doctor!” Leanna was very enthusiastic, Molly was always very good at playing pretend-
“Amazing. God, you should see yourself. So gorgeous, Sherlock.”
Christmas had interrupted his current experiment and, with a child free flat and a sleeping John, now was the perfect time. He took the spray he used to cover his alpha scent with and fused it with John's own scent. The process had been complicated and many times John had complained about the smell in the flat, especially in the hours before their party.
He had had another meaningful conversation with his sister much later in the evening, while Sherlock was occupied to tease his brother and Clara was in a deep conversation with Sarah and Molly.
“Sherlock, I won’t… be able to last….” John tried to warn him. But John desperately wanted to bring Sherlock off first. He took the long and broad cock in his hand and made a quick and efficient rhythm.
“Sherlock! I want you to meet my sister! We live together, you are my pack, I can’t go there without you! Please. I promise I won’t let you face the others alone and you will be able to deduce whoever you want. I'm sure you can come up with an experiment to conduct.”
“Psst, Leanna.” He leaned close to her and she watched him with big eyes. “There's a really handsome Alpha behind you.”
The phone tinged in his pocket and it took Sherlock a second to realize it was the pink one. There was a text message with a picture attached.
“Yes…Thank you John”
He tried seductive poses in front of the bathroom mirror. He tried walking with swaying hips, because when he asked her, Mrs. Hudson told him his arse was his most appealing body part. He went to buy new clothes that would accentuate his chest, hips and arse.
“John! Do you want to take me?”
“Maybe.” John smirked and Sherlock suddenly couldn't wait a second more. Left arm on the headboard the grabbed the base of his cock and guided it to John's mouth, pressing the tip to soft lips that slowly opened to let him in. There it was again, the perfect heat of John Watson's oral cavity and it was his to do with as he pleased. Biting his lips, he fought back his inner alpha, who wanted to take, to fuck deep and relentlessly and it was difficult with John looking up at him with those blue eyes that said: take what you want.
He put the instrument on the desk, picking her up and kissing her nose.
“Sherlock Holmes, you bastard,” she said, voice calm as her eyes wandered across the room, scanning every inch of his home, contaminating it, “so this is where you ended up.”
John's mouth was wet and warm on his, the kiss feather light but without hesitation. Soon, it deepened and John's hands were on his hips and Sherlock's were around his shoulders and back.
Sherlock smiled at him. “I'm your personal pastry chef, not your housekeeper.”
“You want to play with me, Leanna? While your daddy speaks with his sister?” Molly proposed, seeing Sherlock and Harry animated discussion.
When John finally got closer, he could see that Sherlock had curled up, head against his knees, hands in his hair, pulling hard.
“Mummy,” Sherlock said, voice lacking the fondness connected to the endearment.
Alone in the flat for the first time in what seemed to be forever, Sherlock solved a few cases via eMail and played a piece on his violin. He almost missed the call. Almost.
Harry and Sherlock were arguing, when John had gotten to them. It was surprising, they had a cordial relationship at Clara’s birthday party. “What’s the problem”, he asked.
With that he just walked away, John following with a worried look on his face. He caught up when Sherlock reached the cab that had been waiting for them.
“Sarah, you won’t! There will be Mrs Hudson, my sister and her partner, Molly, Leanna’s nanny, very sweet and nice, I am sure you will like her. And, we are going to be a family. An unconventional one, but a family nonetheless.” John was grateful for Sarah thoughtfulness of his and Sherlock’s intimacy, but he wanted her to know she wouldn’t ever be a stranger at Baker Street.
“John, you’re back earlier than I expected…” Sherlock grave tone resonated inside the doctor. He didn’t want to talk, sometime action was better than words, and following his own advice, he took forcefully those plump lips.
“Mrs Monkford?”
“Sherlock. Stop it. I don’t feel threatened at all by your modifications. I like it, you taking ownership here. I don’t feel less alpha, I know you’re not taking my place. If one day I feel threatened, I promise I will tell you, we will talk and we will find a solution so we can thrive the both of us in this relationship. Okay? You will have to tell me too.”
A few second later, he felt a similar pain in his own neck. Sherlock was biting him too and he felt a shot of new lust, the last push to make him come.
“Can I record that?” he said, teasing.
Anthea shook her head. “Your brother said he was on the case.”
“Oh, I should have recorded it, Sherlock Holmes admitting that I can be right!” John teased, “Is that my Christmas’s present?”
“Sorry, love, the traffic was horrible, I... oh love, you...” John stopped next to the desk, coat still in hand.
Now edited by Justbecause, thanks again!
“Really?” The light in Harry’s eye was mischievous and John began to worry, “Sooo… you find…Sherlock…cute then?”
It wasn’t a surprise to see an alpha lose his patience and become aggressive, especially against another alpha. But it wasn’t what John wanted to be defined by. This alpha’s unpredictable aggressiveness. His colleagues were wary of him because experience told them to be cautious with short tempered alphas. Most of them probably didn’t even understand why an alpha would become aggressive just because someone insulted omegas. In their eyes he had to be a little unstable, and potentially dangerous. He was lucky Sarah was his boss and she had put some effort into getting to know him. Anyone else and he would have been jobless the moment he touched Roger.
“Okay, let me finish up the paperwork, text me the address of the pub and I will catch you up there.” John finally caved. And well, he did promise Ella and himself he would try going out more. Sarah was a friend, and the others were not terrible. He had needed to be part of a group, a pack once more; it was a necessity for his inner alpha well-being.
“With Ducky.”
“Hello, love.”
He walked up to his brother. Mycroft was standing next to the window, leaning on his umbrella. “You will keep Leanna safe. You will die to keep her safe. She is more important than anyone else.”
“Good. Mostly. Overwhelmed but that’s normal, we hadn’t thought of that possibility, with her being on suppressants for so long… Sherlock, are you okay with it? I mean, two babies… So much more…”
Siger tried one more time to calm her by putting his hand on her shoulder. But she couldn’t allow it. He had betrayed her before, she had learnt the hard way that being an alpha/omega couple wasn’t a guarantee of happiness and blissful married life. She had been naïve once. But she had hardened. Her reputation was the only thing she had been able to preserve; she would do everything to keep it that way. Sherlock should have followed her lead. Accept what was expected and make the best of it.
An experimental light suck caused John to curse and move his hips up, another inch of John's erection sliding into Sherlock's mouth.
“Oh. That’s all you heard? Nothing… mean?”
“Oh, John, you’re already here. I see you went to see your sister, you’re breathless, why did you hurry back? Something happen?”
“There's another surprise?”
“Yes! I have reservation at a very good Italian restaurant. I know the owner, a story I am sure you will like…”
Little by little, he could feel Sherlock relax around him. John began to kiss this sweet, long neck. As Sherlock became less tense against him, he let his hands roam again against Sherlock’s side until he found the neglected cock. With tender but firm caresses, Sherlock’s penis soon came back fully erected while John murmured sweet love confessions in his ears.
The present was beautifully wrapped and John felt the solemnity of this instant.
“John” He could feel the grave sound reverberate in his neck, oh what he would do to the man… Some more small kisses and rubbing…
Leanna squealed, when she saw the man in their sitting room, running up to him, hugging his knees. The older Holmes brother picked her up and she buried her face in his chest. “Uncle My.”
Being a father…Was it something he could do? An unbonded father, living with another alpha and his daughter. What a strange pack, indeed…But could he be a good father? Did he want to be one? If Sarah kept the baby, would he want to be part of its life?
John sighted for the hundredth time. It was not what he had planned for their Christmas holiday… He had wanted to try test the waters with Sherlock and feelings, maybe trying… well… John didn’t exactly know what he had hoped. Obviously he wasn’t very high on the detective’s list of priorities.
Pregnant. Sarah was pregnant with John's child. He should have thought about that before, reproduction was what heats were for and John hadn't had the chance to even think about protection. John leaving him for Sarah. John bonding Sarah and them raising a happy little family. Stupid thoughts, but they still crossed his mind.
“NO! I… Just a lot… So much information…but don’t stop, just… just give me a moment…” Sherlock panted.
Sherlock straightened, looking at Jim. There were so many things to deduce about him and at the same time none of them made sense or were relevant. He had let too many lives, gotten too good at lying to everyone, lies made up his second skin.
Step by step, John slide from trying to lead to nestling against Sherlock’s waist his face buried in his long neck, feeling protected by those strong arms around him. God, he never wanted to leave! Song after song, they stayed glued together, slowly moving, didn’t really take the music rhythm into consideration. Happy. After a while, John hadn’t a clue how long they had been more or less dancing when Sherlock bend and took his mouth.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John, which was uncomfortable but he needed to see, see John. His doctor looked up at him, eyes bright and Sherlock came at the sight of him. In the distance he could hear John whisper his name against his belly as waves of pleasure crashed down on him.
“It’s virtually undetectable. Nobody would have been looking for it. Bring me the pink phone, I need to text Moriarty.”
Can't believe we're already at chapter 12 :O Part II is already in the making and sooo much thank you for all your lovely comments, they keep us going :*
John shut his eyes. And quickly rolled over to free Sherlock still under him. “Yes, love, you should go look at them, we are… coming soon!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am sorry” Leanna contrite face was as lethal as big eye’s kitten. Sherlock and John quickly cuddle her and after repeating her the rules, let her play with all the new purchases.
Sarah was more than happy to finally leave the hospital after so many weeks of always being unsure, of being in worried for her children. The twins were over a week old and Malo was now healthy enough to come home. She was looking forward to her old flat, they would need some time to get the new one in Baker Street ready.
John sighed and read it out loud. “We were unable to trace the phone the messages came from.”
“You think James Moriarty is the one behind Sarah’s disappearance…”
However, 'twas the lion's lot,
They had reached the city and traffic wasn't as bad as Sherlock had calculated, but the policeman was still incompetent.
“Good.” She could hear him smile. “I put the knife in rather deeply. 'd be a pity the poor guy'd die. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.”
“You’re a beta like me! You know that Clara will go berserk when she finds out. John, what would you do if you knew that someone was… being mean and insulted Sherlock, telling him he was nothing more than a slut, tempting a good alpha, someone who didn’t know his place, just a whore for…” Harry was brutally interrupted by John growled.
He whirled around to find John at the door to the roof, the gun in his hand pointed at Moriarty, who seemed to be amused.
“I knew!!! I am telling Nanna And she disappeared quickly downstairs, yelling.
Leanna moved in her sleep and Sherlock kissed her forehead.
“Leanna, love. How about you talk to your uncle for a while. I have to talk to Papa, okay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He had been in a bad mood lately, snapped several times at Sherlock for no good reason. And when he wasn’t angry, he felt sad at being unable to protect and love his pack better. He hoped he could hide it from Leanna but he was probably deluding himself there…
“Leanna, you remember Harry? My sister? We went to Clara’s birthday party last summer, she's Harry's mate. Clara will join us later, after she's finished with work.”
He wasn't sure John would want Sherlock to fuck him, he was too much of an alpha. The dominant one. And for now, in their honeymoon phase, Sherlock was totally okay with that.
They had danced at Clara's party almost four months ago. Sherlock always looked back to that moment fondly. It was the first time John had held him, pressed his body to the detective's and Sherlock had wished they had been alone back then, because it had felt so intimate, so.... private, just meant for them and not the random guests at the party.
John paused… “Preparation? For me? What are you talking about, Sherlock?”
John woke up first. Leanna, his little mouse was curled against him, her face so peaceful. He would give almost everything to keep her this way. But next to her laid Sherlock, and if his heart filled with warm love looking at the little girl, it almost jumped out of its cage when looking at her father. Asleep, he and Leanna were very much alike. To be awake before the detective was a rare treat, John was determined to take this opportunity to look and memorise and…
“Of course, love, it is a wonderful and meaningful gift. Perfect for me. Just like you. Thank you.”
As the door to Leanna's room closed behind him, Sherlock took a deep breath. They would need to be strong, as strong as their daughter was.
“Molly. So much to tell. We live with John now. John is really nice and Papa likes him. I love John. We live with Mrs. Hudson but she says I can call her Nana and she makes yummy cakes,” Leanna babbled, as Molly put her on the floor again, sitting down next to Sherlock.
“John, can I have an apple?”
Damn! How was he supposed to resist romantic Sherlock? John always felt a wave of desire when the detective made those declarations of love.
“Hmmm.” John's breath on his jaw and neck. “You are gorgeous, my beautiful Sherlock. I could kiss you all day.”
“They are dating, John, obviously.”
As John swell further in his hands as he orgasmed, Sherlock reached his own climax.
The next day, the medical staff were beginning to ask for names but John and Sarah just couldn’t find a common ground.
“You smell amazing. You taste even better.”
John got to his feet, files in a neat pile and only briefly damaged by the tea. “You amazing creature. I wish I could…”
“Oh John, are you truly an idiot? I should have been able to deduce there was something wrong with that footage. I let emotion blind me! I can already hear Mycroft, Caring is not an advantage, it’s found on the losing side! John, I let my feelings for you control me and I let you down. I didn’t save you. You could have died. Really died! And it would have been my fault!”
Sherlock nodded, John's lips twitching against his neck.
Merry Christmas!
“Well… It is a reminder that we really have to put our mind to find names for real!” Sarah observed.
“Yeah, yeah Sherlock, sorry, just… I haven't heard Harry laugh like this for a very very long time, and I thought I would never hear it again. And, I don’t know, it will pass, see, no tears anymore. I am happy, for her.” John was a little embarrassed, but very grateful for Sherlock attention.
“Yes or I would tell you. Wouldn’t be able to hide it very long from you anyway. And that’s why you will tell me too if you feel bothered by something I do. Because I know how alphas feel about their possessions too.”
John almost jumped from the fright. How could he not have sensed Sherlock presence in the living room?
4. Loving
John busted in from the living room at the first words in hours.
John smiled at the petulance in Sherlock voice, “You are the one indexing your socks, I wouldn’t know! So… you love to dance? I didn’t know.”
“Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that? It’s a bit suspicious, isn’t it?”
Soon, Sherlock was ushering John and Leanna into a cab.
“Well, you will have to wait for your turn about that… Sarah…What…What do we do about… us?”
“Please! Just… What do you think? I need to know…”
“Me?” John would have believed the man was fishing for compliment if not for the look of genuine surprise on his face.
“It should begin with an M” Leanna said very seriously.
“Yes, Papa. We are going swimming today.”
Sherlock took off his coat and shoes, sitting down in his arm chair.
“You are not angry about me rearranging everything that is yours? I am not sure it would be the same for me…”
“My grandmother on my father’s side of the family was called Matilda. I loved her when I was a toddler, she was a very clever and strong woman. She was gentle too…”
Mycroft briefly called and so did John.
“You haven't moved in almost half a minute. I'm just asking.”
“What do you want?” She hated her voice for being so shaky.
He opened the door. “By the way, the address is 221B Baker Street.” He winked.
Love.
“Hello, little lioness. Do you have a runny nose?”
The reality had been worse than his worst fear. There hadn’t been direct confrontations first, his colleagues were avoiding him, their eyes became shifty, it was so humiliating! No consideration, just clear avoidance. Karen, the omega nurse that had become something of a friend since Sherlock’s first appearance at the A&E was looking at him. She was the first. But it wasn’t the kind eyes he was used to, they had grown so big John wondered if they would pop out of her face. He tried a little smile in her direction but she quickly made herself seem very occupied with a phone that hadn’t rung.
“Why would they hide if they love? Love is good. It’s hating that is a bad thing!”
“John… This sound awfully like a proposal. And you are rambling.” Sherlock was finally looking at John again, and a timid smile was coming back.
“Okay, Sherlock. I'm only doing this for you, because you helped so much over the last months and I consider you a friend. I can't do anything from here. It'll take me half an hour to get to Scotland yard and I'll text you as soon as I know something, okay.”
“Okay”, the gynaecologist finally said, after 20 minutes, “now we will talk about what you will need to do because of your unusual situation. First, you will the scent of the alpha father. Dr Watson, I advise you let some of your clothes and scents to Dr Sawyer. It will soon be absolutely necessary. The alpha’s pheromones present in the scent will help the omega body to make the proper changes to accommodate the baby growth. It will be the only think that will help as you won’t have intercourse and exchange of bodyly fluids.”
“And John, Sherlock is looking at you with the same light in his eyes I see in Clara when she looks at me. And after you took care of Hamish, you didn’t notice but there were several omegas who were admiring you. If looks could kill, they would have all dropped dead. Now go get your man, tiger!”
“Perfect! John, this photo is…perfect…I love it! Thank you!” And Sherlock enthusiastically kissed him before retreating and looking at his gift again.
His mother was particularly infuriating when she was right...
“You know, technically he is still married…” John finally argued with his sister.
Afterwards, they watched their Friday evening movie, Peter Pan, which the two Holmes enjoyed particularly because of the pirates.
“As long as you are the one to hire a new nanny,” was the only thing he said.
Hugging Leanna close, Sherlock kissed her hair. “Thank you so much, little lioness.”
“You have 10 minutes to dress up, I will wait for you in the living room.” And like a star of some drama show, Sherlock exited the room a big and satisfied smile on his lips.
“John…I am happy you like it.”
“I love you Sherlock. That doesn’t change. I will walk, maybe for hour or so and be back, I have my phone, if needs must. Leanna will soon wake up; will you be okay?”
“John, not that I am complaining, really, but Leanna will very soon wake up and come to our room, and well…we are quite…too much…worked up…for a little girl right now.”
“Hey! You’re not the only one embarrassed here! But she’s three, she doesn’t know what she saw exactly…right?”
Blood.
“Our mother has not yet contacted me, but she will know of this any minute now. She will be enraged.”
“Doctor Watson!” Karin, the new omega nurse called out to him, “I wanted to tell you, I appreciate that you told Roger his behaviour was inappropriate and discriminatory. It’s not the first time he insinuated that omegas should just listen to alphas and be…pleasant with them.”
Sorry not beta read yet.
“I waited for 2 hours! My daughter can’t wait any longer, it’s scandalous to make her wait so long!” the man began to rant.
“Yes, are you happy little lioness?” Sherlock asked, kneeling in front of his daughter and look at what she was showing.
“Daddy, look what I made!”
“Now, we can’t tell there is a Watson type!” Harry declared, smirking.
How are you guys?
Sherlock’s birthday present:
She let her Nanny pick her up and threw her arms around Molly's neck.
“What do you want?”
Sherlock took Leanna in his arms to hide his embarrassment. John finally came with a sweetie.
“John, stop. We both were stupid. And I left first. For that I am really sorry.”
“Wow…I … I didn’t expect so much…John really wasn’t exaggerating about you…I thought he was smitten and a little over excited…but, …very impressive… And thank you Sherlock…”
The early morning air was chilly but successful in clearing John’s mind. Sarah was pregnant. It wasn’t the end of the world. And before overthinking, he should wait for Sarah’s decisions, what she wanted to do. He would help her, whatever her decision about keeping the baby or not would be, he could be here for her, with Sherlock. God Sherlock, what was he thinking right now? He had to go home right now, tell him again nothing would change.
Sarah sat up, fixing her hair before she opened the door to her treatment room. The man outside had just been about to knock. He was wearing dark jeans and a grey jumper that had a tear on the left arm.
Sherlock eyes were two black pearls, “You… You would be… willing to…for me? Let me have you all?”
Mycroft Holmes was not a patient man. For exactly this reason the best agents worked for him, and they worked fast. Now that his little brother was involved, he had sent three of them to Afghanistan to look for Sebastian Moran, while the rest of the team was on the lookout for James Moriarty. Sure, Sherlock was convinced he could find the man, but compared to Mycroft he had always been... slow. The slow little brother, affected by his second gender and the temperament that came with it. Meeting John Watson had brought sentiment into the mixture and Mycroft feared for both Sherlock's and Leanna's safety. Sure, the doctor had positive impact on the younger Holmes, made him happy, but Mycroft feared everything would get more complicated for the two of them.
“Sherlock’s family? But why? You don’t make any sense!”
“How can you say something like that!” Sarah exploded.
“Yes... I shouldn't be teasing you. It means...”
“Mistletoe, John, can’t ignore tradition, it’s bad luck Mrs Hudson said.” Sherlock had disconnected the mistletoe next to the tree and was now holding it just above them.
In the evening, the fever went up to 40° and Leanna wouldn't stop crying. Sherlock had to force himself not to panic. He googled the nearest hospital and went to the A&E, where they told him to wait again. He really wanted to punch someone!
The detective didn’t know what to say. It was overwhelming and heart wreaking at the same time. All he could do was to take his mate in his arms as tightly as possible, “I am sorry John, so so sorry it happened… I never wanted this for you…” he murmured.
“I… I know… Sarah needs you more. I’m home. With Leanna. I will be alright.”
“John…” Oh, how John loved to hear his name from Sherlock’s mouth. He had a particular way of saying it, felt like his boring and common name became extraordinary and unique when Sherlock said it.
“I shall go and search the flat, if that is okay with you.”
Chapter 11 will be uploaded on June 15th, because it's my birthday. So there'll be 3 chapters this week. yaay ~ Vany aka Strange_Johnlock
She made way for him to signal he was allowed to enter her apartment.
John abruptly came out of his deep thoughts when he felt the ghost of kiss on his neck, quickly followed by others, more intense and absolutely not timid.
Sherlock could see the joy in Leanna's eyes, when she talked to John or their landlady. She smiled a lot more, confirming to her father that he had made the right decision by leaving Janine and the manor behind. Sure, Leanna was still a quiet, almost shy child and John probably didn't really notice the changes in her, but Sherlock did and it made him happy.
“How?”
His wannabe kidnappers the Garrideb brothers were not masterminds by any means - he was being kept in the closet of their fucking office. He had been there just this morning with Sherlock.
He could see the doctor's face soften from out of the corner of his eyes.
“Chocolate, Nanna!” Leanna who had been a little put out was now very excited.
“With sprinkles, Papa. John can eat when he come home from work.”
“We have been great. How about you?” Sherlock added.
So he soldiered on. And each time Sherlock took his mobile phone in his jacket, he inhaled his musky scent so much stronger now that he didn’t care about masking his smell in the flat anymore. All the other people around them were betas who didn’t perceive any difference. The first time it happened, John had been struck by the powerful smell, so many more subtleties that he hadn't smelt before. He hadn’t been able to move until Sherlock had asked him what was wrong. He didn’t remember what he had come up with but now, he stopped breathing when Sherlock came too close…
“No. Even if Sherlock believes me dead, he will seek to find and destroy you even more!”
If some of you want to help and beta read for us, please let us know!
“Yes. You’re right. But sometimes adults are not as wise as children.”
She got of the sofa, almost falling over her coat.
John tried to explain that he didn’t consider Sarah his omega, it was just Karen petty scolding that went to his head, but Sherlock didn’t let him. John could see that he had closed off and put his detective persona on. He would have to wait and try again to apologise and get through to him. And well, the man was a genius, he probably knew better than himself what was on his mind. It would wait, Sarah was the priority.
That man was mad but very talented at spying on people, good enough to hide even from Sherlock. Sherlock had found another alpha who allowed them to hide at his flat, wasn’t that pathetic! And the really freaky thing? Sherlock was apparently in love with that alpha. Janine hadn’t believed Moriarty first, it was Sherlock, unfeeling and asexual Sherlock they were talking about. But he had shown her proof and it was quite convincing she had to admit. There had been weird text messages and intrnet search histories on his laptop about how to know if he loves you. Janine had laughed, of course her freak of husband would find a freak love! An alpha, really?!
By the time Lestrade called he was on the verge of shooting the wall again. He hated not being able to do something.
Heart throbbing, hands shaking, he didn't even notice when Mrs. Hudson helped him up and onto the sofa hours after Janine had left. He didn't hear her pitiful words or realized that she took his phone to call Mycroft.
“It’s a sweet name… John? Do you agree?”
After breakfast, they got ready and Sherlock packed a bag for John, so he could stay at the hospital for at least a week.
While his fingers were occupied invading Sherlock’s body, making him moan and curse, his mouth mapped Sherlock’s waist, kissing and sucking and progressing to the south. Who would have thought that hearing posh Sherlock swearing could be so arousing!
Sherlock could hear the doubt in his voice. “But ...?” he asked.
John surprised himself. He hadn't planned to say that at all. “Forget it. Finish your experiment, Sherlock. I didn't mean to distract you, I don't know why I said that...”
“John. I shouldn’t have been so angry with you… It’s just… I felt I didn’t make a bad decision, it was an accident with no serious consequences… I felt like you threatened my right to decide for myself. But I was vicious with you… I am sorry, I am used to verbally defending myself and I tend to be…violent. You didn’t deserve it...”
That’s how a few hour later you could see all the unusual family members of their strange pack gathered around the babies cribs brainstorming enthusiastically for names. Somehow it had transformed in a battle for the most unusual name they could think of.
“Papa, don't cry. Always can call Leanna, like Leanna call Papa when Papa has a case.” Sherlock had felt her lips against his forehead. He had pressed her closer for a second, taking in her scent, before releasing her.
Sherlock was terrifying in his calm fury. John found himself in awe of this incredible man who had been able to control his temper and protect him.
Smiling again, Leanna got off the bench and made the four steps to the glass, pressing her nose against it.
“I… I don’t know if I can leave Leanna. She’s… clingy these days. but i want to support you in this. I…”
Sherlock didn't answer, nose buried in John's neck, taking in his scent. This was perfect. He wanted this and nothing else and he hated Janine for trying to take it from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fifteen minutes,” he murmured, grabbing his violin.
“Hum, Sherlock? It’s starting to freaking me out here, can you say something?”
Sarah was asked to open the door to the new flat she had bought for herself and the twins. She hadn’t had the time to move in before the abduction and now with the babies it was unlikely that would happen soon.
Sherlock had to admit he hadn’t been to keen on Leanna working for the Met. Not because most of the people there were idiots, but because it was dangerous (He liked danger, but he wanted his little girl to be safe, thank you very much) and because it was still hard for omegas to achieve something in certain jobs. Now she had outdone herself and become a DI at only thirty-seven. And she loved her job.
He showed him the photo of a bare room with old and blue and green wallpaper that is already peeling off.
It was frightening but when Papa had asked this morning if he agreed with the teacher’s decision he had said he could do it, he could be brave alone.
They finally slept, holding tightly to each other, both needing the reassurance.
Just when he was about to leave, he heard a deep voice yelling in the A&E’s corridor, demanding to see a doctor immediately because he refused to wait one more minute. John saw the man with the nurse at the reception. He had a little girl in his arms, she seemed asleep… John came closer…No she was sweating… a lot… definitely not peacefully sleeping.
“Hmm. Can't decide which one of you I love to cuddle more.”
He took his phone and sent a text to Mycroft.
Sherlock was beautiful, his hair in disarray and obviously having difficulties to keep standing up. John felt a new wave of adrenaline course through his body and took the man in his arms.
“Love you, Papa”, the little girl whispered.
The detective forced a smile on his face in an attempt to calm him down. “There is another puzzle. I need to get to Lestrade as soon as possible. I wanted to give you the option of joining me.”
“Could we talk for a moment, darling?” He pressed out the endearment.
“Oh, I know”, Leanna suddenly exclaimed, “You are Santa’s spy and you're in disguise! Right Papa?”
Sherlock had put him in one of the cubicles and hadn’t wasted any time before engulfing him. The detective had experimented on him and now knew how to quickly make him come, but John wanted more than a quick orgasm, he wanted the whole experience of Sherlock. He had made the tall man stand up in order to be kissed and enveloped.
“Fuck.” He spit out, and between blood and partially chewed dessert, he saw something shimmery.
“So Moran is Moriarty acolyte… It’s clever… Is it clever?”
“Maybe. I don't know. But I don't think John wants to kiss me, love.”
He needed to unwind, let go of his frustration at the world and stop making his family, his loved one pay for his insecurities… Maybe he should try to surrender more to Sherlock. Let go.
And I want to say thank you to Ambre, my amazing and lovely co-author, who first didn't even want to be my co-author but who was forced into it by me :D Writing with you was soooooooo much fun and you are not only very creative, but a really nice person I enjoy working with you a lot. To many more fan fictions :D
He ignored the police man's offended sound and Molly's giggles in favour of his daughter's greeting.
“Definitely. Sorry you are 30 years old, a very old man indeed!” Sherlock teased.
Sherlock sat down next to her on the bed, pressing kisses to her warm cheeks and forehead.
He avoided Roger and his day went as smoothly as could be expected. Essentially he saw sprains, a little allergic reaction and one broken arm. Nothing extraordinary but a better day than he thought it would be.
The man dared to laugh, “Excuse me, Dr Watson if I don’t find you very frightening. And to answer your question about Mr Holmes, we killed you.”
The Alpha seemed confused himself. “No, I wanted to come to the flat with you. I don’t know what…”
So here he was in a shop full of sparkles and glitter to buy what he needed to make their flat the new branch of Santa‘s workshop. John kept Leanna’s hand but with all the things to see, he let her go for one minute to choose between two big stocking.
“So John, there is more about this incident, I can tell.” Sherlock began, eyes piercing.
Sherlock nodded, afraid he might say something that would make John change his mind. He wasn't good with people.
“What…?” John tried to ask, when the old landlady promptly came into the room.
“Sherlock, it’s me. I promise it’s me, John. Please.”
I love you.
John's groan as he orgasmed went straight to Sherlock's groin and he felt awkward for just standing there. He couldn't just go in there and tell John he was aroused now and wanted an orgasm too.
Leanna concentrated on squeezing vinegar again, her eyes lighting up.
The more he thought about it, more the idea appealed to him… and be able to truly surprised Sherlock would be the icing on the cake! He would be indebted with Mycroft for this!
“Oh, love… Yes, it’s quite beautiful, isn’t it.” John pulled Sherlock against him and put his head on the man’s shoulder and looked at the photo with him.
Leanna carefully reached out for her. “She’s as pretty as Sarah.” Leanna touched the baby’s and and than her cheek. “What’s her name?”
He opened his eyes and look down at John to find the sadness gone, replaced by a trust Sherlock probably didn't deserve.
Gently, Sherlock lifted her into his arms. He kissed her hair as she grunted in her sleep and brought her upstairs to her room. Returning downstairs, he changed into his pyjamas and robe and arranged himself on the sofa, head on John's chest, legs entangled with his flatmate's.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock kissed her, then Sarah’s cheek, before picking up Matilda. The baby had already had her nap and was making faces, her cute mouth opening and closing and it shouldn’t be fascinating, but it was. “Hello, Matilda. Have all your parents been behaving or did you have to send them into time out again?”
“Go see her and explained what happened and why you made this choice. She won’t be mad, I promise.” Sherlock said with his most assured voice. It seemed to work because Harry went to Clara, kissed her and took her to the kitchen for a private conversation.
“Then I will tell you. I like you. You are my friend. And you and Leanna are welcome, more than welcome to stay here as long as you want. It’s your home too.”
“Don’t be ridiculous! Of course I want you! I can’t accept a reality where you’re not beside me; look what I have done to the place I think about as home!” Sherlock said, interrupting John’s silent self-doubt. “It’s not home anymore if you’re not here! You! You are the one who should be thinking, are you sure John? I am me. I am dangerous to be around”
There was a picture attached. Sarah looked pale and scared, but otherwise unharmed. Sherlock could hear John growling next to him.
Yep, Captain Watson was angry. But this time Sherlock didn’t feel like appeasing the alpha. He hadn’t done anything wrong! He was fine! And he knew exactly what he was doing!
