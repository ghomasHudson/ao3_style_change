"is it not obvious? I have liked you for quite some time."
"God, better than I could have imagined. I could spend the rest of the night between your thighs" —and to prove his point, Dean ducks down again, trailing open-mouthed kisses just above Castiel's left knee and continues to move upward. A laugh bubbles from Cas's throat.
Another long one! Hope you enjoy.
Dean quirks a smile, since he’s had that Ozzy song running through his head every since Gabe told them about the car. “Crowley then. Good to meet you. Hope she’s everything you wanted.”  He tugs the keys out of his pocket and hands them over.
As soon as they decided Dean immediately knew where he wanted to take Cas, so he kept a close eye on the weather reports. When the day dawned much warmer than typical for early March, Dean figured it was a good sign.
Sam and Jess are the just the first of the guests. By one o’clock, Garth and his fiancé, Bess, have arrived, as well as John, Benny, Andrea, and their children. Dean makes introductions and by the time lunch is over and the kids are splashing in the pool, it’s as if Cas has known them all for years. He never imagined he could feel so welcomed by a group of people. Not a single person even alluded to the recent problems between Dean and Cas, proving Dean’s point. He’s nice enough not to gloat.
Cas quirks the side of his mouth and narrows his eyes before answering. “Candace is certainly appreciative of your company.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean swears, cramming the phone into his pocket. He looks around for the waitress to ask for the bill, but Benny waves him out of the booth.
Dean grips the phone tighter.
There’s an ache in Dean’s chest that will never fade when he thinks of his mother, her long blond hair glowing in the sunlight coming through the kitchen window. He remembers his father coming home from a day at the garage and sweeping her into his arms, twirling her around the kitchen while she laughed and beat him on the back with her dish towel. “Maybe it’s time for you to let go of the past too, dad. You don’t have to be alone forever. Mom wouldn’t want that for you.”
“Yeah, sorry, I got ‘em,” he calls, gathering up the drinks and heading into the dining room with a smile.
Aaron’s face falls. “Ah, shoot. It was sold this morning. Don’t think we have any more on the lot.”
“I think that was pretty obvious,” Cas retorts dryly. He remembers the way Ash played them, first flirting with Cas, then giving Dean the guitar. The sick feeling in his stomach increases when he thinks about the way Dean responded to Ash’s every touch.
A gush of tears spill over and Dean kisses them away. He stays like that, lips lingering on the warm, fragile skin just below Cas’ eyes, the salt from his tears burning Dean’s lips. His body trembles and Dean slides his hands around to the back of Cas’ head, pulling him in so he can bury his face in Dean’s neck. Dean holds him, murmuring over and over a litany of “I love you. I love you so fucking much. We’re okay. I love you, Cas.”
John studies him for a few moments before he nods. “There’s a list on the desk. Knock yourself out.”
Dean heaves a sigh and runs one hand down over his face. “Yeah, you’re right.” But it doesn’t alleviate his guilt any.
“Dean,” Castiel cuts in before Dean can say something he doesn’t mean. He lays his hand on Dean’s arm to get his attention, ignoring the wide eyes Dean turns on him. Dean’s gaze flickers between his hand on Dean’s arm and his face a few times, before settling on his face. “Would you mind if I tried?”
Dean is quiet for a long moment and Castiel can hear the weariness in his voice when he finally answers. “I can’t believe you had to ask that.”
There’s a long pause and Castiel isn’t sure Ben is going to answer. He can tell that Meg wants to jump in and give Castiel the details, but waits. Castiel counts to ten, and then to fifteen, and finally a watery, “It wasn’t my fault,” escapes.
“Installing an intercom might make him feel better.”
“No, you listen,” she snaps, cutting him off. “Castiel was under the impression that you and he were forming a connection beyond friendship. Despite the way you encourage him with your disgusting flirting, this is clearly not the case. He has been through too much to waste his time on an immature, insensitive cad, which you clearly are. If there is the slightest bit of decency in you, which I severely doubt, you will walk away and let him be. He doesn’t need you playing with his emotions. We are leaving now. You should come say your goodbyes.”
Castiel finally successfully pulls out an aluminum package and a small plastic bottle. He lowers his backpack and leans it against the foot of one of the chairs, putting everything else aside.
Encouraging himself, Dean gives it to him. Every quick movement of his hips shakes Castiel's body on the table, and Dean has to hold him in place, fucking him faster, harder, harder. It takes all his concentration not to come in that moment, especially with how hot and tight Castiel's insides are, how he jerks in his hands every time Dean's thighs bang against his skin. And that fucking choker. It looks even darker against Castiel's skin in the gloom, seeing the beads of sweat trapped under the librarian's collarbone.
Because Dean also liked to frequent the library because of a particular librarian. They call him Castiel, he works shifts on the second floor and is also a sophomore.
"I-I'm coming, Dean," Castiel gasps against his ear, her voice close to a sob. "I-I'm so close yeah yeah Dean, Dean"
"I think you just need to wrap the music around the chorus to complement the lyrics. But I think it's perfect, ”he murmurs at the end, handing the headphones back to him. "Most of your compositions are ..."
"Shh ..." he hisses, looking around to make sure said librarian was out of earshot. It's apparently nowhere in sight, which is more than fine. His best friend's perverted comments shouldn't even be around him. Charlie leans back in her chair and pouts, crossing her arms.
"What do you want?" Dean asks, he doesn't want to ruin it again and do something that Castiel might not want.
"Sammy always keeps me awake," Dean explains. "Plus my dorm is across campus and I'm too lazy to go."
"I can't imagine how you can sleep on those uncomfortable tables."
They kiss again, and it's sweet, but after a moment Dean moves, pulling the sweater up so fast that Castiel has to half lean back and lean on the table, showing the full extent of skin on his torso.
"Yeah, let me know if you feel the same in the morning." Finally Dean pulls away, letting Castiel spread out on the table for a few more moments as he removes the condom and ties it up, tossing it into a nearby trash can. "Let me get you something to clean you up, wait."
He really should give up his supposed bad boy image.
"So ... how do you want to do this?"
"Hey, thanks," he murmurs, too lost in the sight to even think about moving, still holding the headphones in the narrow space between them.
"I wanted to apologize, for what happened last night…" Castiel says. stopping at the end of one of the shelves, leaning on it. 'Because of how I left and ..."
"A lot huh?" He repeats, letting a tentative smile play on his lips. "Enough to let me kiss you again?"
"God, you sound like Charlie” Dean complains, bending down slightly to wrap his arms under Castiel's legs, prompting him to wrap his legs around Dean's waist.
Castiel bites his lip and blinks.
"You," he murmurs in response, tugging at the edge of Dean's sweatshirt, giving him a small smile. "Preferably with less clothes on."
"You really don't seem like the type to party," is what Dean chooses to say, all the while rummaging through his brain trying to remember which party he might have seen Castiel at. His comment earns a momentary laugh in return and Dean's heart races at the sound.
"That was… really embarrassing." The student leans down and begins to pick up the books, inwardly wishing he could disappear and then fling himself down the second-floor staircase. You don't have to help, the books were in author order and you would have to review them.
So as long as there was an empty table and no one was causing a fuss, the library was a good place to try to get some sleep. The only downside was maybe that his brother and his best friend frequented the library too, but it was that, or having to walk to their damn dorm room on the other side of campus. Fortunately, today is Tuesday and it means that they both have classes, so he will finally have a few hours to sleep without interruptions.
Castiel wants to be closer and is tempted to just slip his leg over Dean's hip and sit on his lap to continue the kiss, wrap his arms around his neck and let go, but he's already out of breath and stuff. it would certainly be a bit strange. So, he breaks contact.
Castiel almost screams the moment Dean's cock hits that spot inside of him and his hand curls tighter into Dean's hair, his body arches and his breathing quickens. The table sways slightly next to them and Castiel's other arm grabs onto one of Dean's shoulders, pulling him closer. The rhythm is lost for a second as they readjust their position, Castiel with his arms wrapping around Dean's shoulders and his legs wrapping tightly around his waist.
Right, Charlie at her best. The girl is typically friendly to everyone in college, and while her and Sam both preferred to go unnoticed, it was thanks to their outgoing friend that almost everyone on campus was at least somewhat familiar with the Winchester brothers.
"Where is Cas?" She murmurs, nudging Dean's head with one finger until he curses and pushes on Charlie's arm. Slightly offended, Charlie snorts and walks away from him, deciding to annoy Sam instead.
Castiel settles back on the table with a persistent smile, but obeys, moving closer to the edge of the table so Dean can catch up with him.
"Beautiful," Dean breathes, tracing the indentation of Castiel's sternum with his mouth. "You are amazing."
"You still want help with that composition piece?"
"Cheer up, Dean. Your boyfriend is here today."
"Yeah…" Dean stands between Cas's spread legs, slowly slipping his fingers under the soft fabric. "The sweater too."
Castiel sighs and raises his hand to put on the glasses that were previously on his head, running his fingers through his hair carelessly, and arranging the glasses on the bridge of his nose so that they are not crooked afterwards.
Sometimes Castiel is not there, but most of the time, Dean sleeps until the last student disappears, and has a habit of waiting for Castiel while he closes the library, then walks with him down the street until they separate and each one goes to their respective bedrooms.
Castiel shrugs and continues to place the books on the shelf. He knows he's blushing and he doesn't want Dean to see him. He had made a fool of himself a moment ago and prefers to show the somewhat insecure side with which he is a little familiar.
Castiel is about to take a sip of his latte when he is enthusiastically handed the headphones and almost spits out his drink, laughing as Dean snatches it from his hands and places the headphones on his head. The song flows better now that the issue is resolved and Castiel nods in approval, before removing the headphones, smiling at Dean.
"A walk on your back would be nice. If you could take me."
Sam ponders this for a long moment, his eyes locked on Castiel's, as if he's looking at his soul.
Castiel's fingers grip the edges of the table and he squeezes Dean inside out of inertia. It takes him a few seconds to relax, but when he finally shuffles, rocking his hips under Dean, Dean takes it as a cue to start moving. He retreats slowly, his eyes fixed on where his cock opens Castiel astonishingly, letting out a slow sigh at the needy noises the boy makes below him.
Castiel feels a blush spread across his cheeks and he looks away from the other quickly, exhaling a sigh.
"It's nothing." Dean definitely didn't feel his heart skip a beat.
"Sorry to delay you. I wasn't going to sleep that long."
"Shit, Cas…" Dean gasps against his collarbone, preparing to give the other what he wants. The sound of their bodies coming together is far too audible as Dean pulls out completely only to thrust into Castiel as hard as he can, keeping his hips at an angle to hit that spot that had Castiel shaking with pleasure.
They don't take long to settle in, and as soon as Dean sees Castiel with a cart of books next to one of the shelves in the hallway, he wastes no time getting up, heading towards him.
"I guess we'll find out," and with his index finger he gently pulls the fabric, until Castiel's face leans slightly upward, facing him. The young man's pulse flutters under his date and he hears him moan softly from the back of his throat. Castiel doesn't respond, he doesn't know how to do it, so he just leaves a chaste kiss on Dean's chin in return.
Another shake.
Cas tried to sit. Every nerve in his body howled in protest, the world spun, and he remembered that he was full of holes and lacking in blood. Dean's hand pressed down on Cas to keep him flat on the… cot? Ground? It was hard and cold. Probably the dirt floor. A few blinks later, Cas focused on their surroundings.
“Man up,” he ordered himself. “Don’t be a pussy.”
Dean tightened his grip on Cas’s arm and focused on the heat of the other man’s skin and how good it felt to touch him. The angel made a noise of confusion and pain, and Dean relaxed his grip for fear of summoning Castiel back to consciousness too soon.
If it hadn't been used to gouge crescent moons deep into his thighs, he might have loved this knife. The handle fit his grip as if it were custom-designed to do so. It was heavy for a smaller blade and shone as if polished, which was strange as his blood should have been all over the thing.
Doc turned to Castiel. “This is going to be very painful.”
Dean marched forward several steps. Cas was heavy, and there was no physical way Dean should have had the ability to carry him on his injured leg and his starving body. But Cas had been tortured and nearly killed because of Dean. The man needed carrying and damn it, Dean was the one who would hold him—not these strangers.
“Makes you think about joinin’ all those fools out West, huh?”
However, snapping the bone out of socket would take more force than just pulling on his thumb. He would have to yank upward with his left hand while he pulled down with his right. He’d have to mean it, and with all the strength he could muster. Otherwise, he’d get only pain and no reward.
Castiel shook. So did Dean. The doctor placed himself between the two of them, and Dean let go of the angel’s hand.
Cas asked fake Dean about the succubus, completely unaware that it wasn’t Dean in the room with him. Dean would kill the bitch for using his likeness to hurt Cas. Overt torture was kind in comparison to her twisted games. Physical wounds healed faster than psychological ones. The demoness was denying Cas water but under the guise of negligence. It was as if she didn’t care about enough Cas to keep him thirsty. She just didn’t care about him at all. And Cas accepted her treatment as if he deserved it. As if Dean would ever—ever—be so cruel.
An odd mixture of emotions hit Castiel but he was too exhausted to identify them. “He’s not my boyfriend.”
“But…” Sam thought about how to say this. “Cas’ wings… He can’t move them to the etheric plane or farther away from the physical plane in order to heal them? If they’re not really physical wings with feathers?”
“Okay, I think you’re good on calming techniques. The next thing we need to do is pick a target memory. They say to pick ‘the worst or the first,’ meaning either the worst trauma or the earliest one you can remember. But I’m not sure if that applies to a gazillion-year-old being.”
care, Gabriel. About you. Never thought I’d say that, but… And I think you do too. I think that’s why you tried to get me to see that I could survive something happening to Dean. Because you care.”
at a convention, though not as a debut author, he’d brought pencil topper erasers shaped like anatomical hearts on pencils inscribed with the title. Of course, that was Bela’s idea too, and it was a good one: both the book room and Amazon sold out of his books.
“But you just said—” the man argued.
Dean watched the lights of Lebanon pass them on the right before Sam took a left onto what should have been the road that led to the bunker. “Dude… Where’s the power plant?”
“Maybe. But we still need to bring our A-game. How long will it take you and Gabriel to recharge?”
“I hope you’re all planning my reunion party with my son,” Lucifer called out. “Because I’d hate to have to kill all of you.” He frowned at Cas, Sam, and Gabriel. “Some of you
“You’re angry,” Michael observed.
“We work as a team,” Castiel insisted, an odd feeling of confidence filling his chest. “Equals. Each of us. No one is a tool. No one is valued only for what they can do. The four of us—we bring a lot of experience, both good and bad—to the table. We talk about it. Honestly. No lies or omissions of truth.” He glanced at Dean, who had what appeared to be a look of awe on his face. “We discuss it like adults. We leave our egos out of it.”
“It’s Jamie,” answered the young man as he shut the door. He smiled down at the sight of Castiel on the bench and exclaimed, “You’re lookin’ plum good there, Cas!”
He liked the man’s voice. Liked the way the hunter could command a room, apply pressure with his words, smooth-talk his way into secret places. But now the burden of communication fell on Cas’s shoulders—and he only had one good one.
“You were calling for me,” Cas said. His voice was raw from screaming, and his chest ached from how hard it was to speak. With the fresh blood loss, Cas was the weakest he’d been in days.
Cas’s brows sank even lower on his forehead. Either he didn’t want to reply or he was attempting to do so through their mental link.
Cas glanced sideways at the unconscious Dean. One of the men from the road was pulling Dean’s body upright while the other stranger was returning with a tin cup of presumably water.
Dean secured the rope, lashing Cas's hands together with a series of loops and knots. "Tying you up," he answered.
That fucking BITCH!
Purgatory.
Dean glanced at Cas, and for the first time in days, the two maintained eye contact. Cas felt like he shouldn’t look. He remembered how fiercely Dean had yelled that he didn’t want to see the color of Castiel’s eyes. But right now, Dean seemed to be begging Cas to stay present, to not look away and leave him alone again. So Cas trusted this moment and held his gaze.
The backs of Dean’s thighs pressed against the cold metal chair as he humped the air in millimeter thrusts. What would it be like inside of Cas? Hot. Tight. Heavenly.
Dean shifted the quilt over his lap. He tried again to speak to Cas through their mental link but was met with nothing. The ex-angel’s focus seemed to be more on the conversation coming from the kitchen, anyway. He was closer to the doorway. Perhaps he could hear what they were saying. Dean stared and savored each tiny shift in the angel’s expression, entranced. Then Castiel’s brows furrowed, and his gaze snapped to Dean with concern.
"Don't leave," Dean said. "And don't die on me."
The she-demon slapped Cas’s face.
“So you’re going to stay there?”
It was a familiar voice, but entirely out of place here. Dean had to be imagining it. Or he'd died and gone to some weird version of hell.
Dean kept his gaze locked on Castiel, both wanting to look away because the guilt was too painful and wanting to stare at Cas until he knew he was going to be okay. The ex-angel’s skin remained pale, but no longer held the pallor of someone moments from death. Blood no longer marred his hair, face, or hands. With his jaw set and his long, dark lashes tipped downward like the corners of his mouth, the man looked carved from marble and absolutely kissable. Dean let out a shaky breath and hated the way his heart ached for something so close and yet so impossible.
She smirked full, pouty lips. "I don't think you do, baby," she said.
Doc interrupted his thoughts. “I need to patch up Cas’s shoulder. Can you help me with that?”
“I can’t baby you anymore, Cas,” Dean said, and the tortured angel felt a comforting warmth from hearing his nick-name. The warmth turned to ice when Dean added, “Take your clothes off.”
“That rash flaring up again, is it?”
Before Dean had passed out moments ago, and his eyes met Castiel’s, the ex-angel had wanted to cry with relief. Words had sprung to his mouth—words like, “I’m so glad you’re here; I thought I’d lost you; I don’t know how I’d live without you.” But Cas had shut them down and averted his eyes like Dean had asked.
“Hold him!” Doc shouted.
Cas hesitated. The words sounded bad. It was as if his request amused Dean. Maybe the depths of Castiel’s weakness did amuse him. The ex-angel nodded and kept his eyes downturned.
Dean nodded. The thought of a doctor and medicine gave him another push of energy. He would crash hard—monstrously hard—when they had made it to safety, but hopefully not before then.
The pain was manageable. An egg-sized knot on the back of his head was the oldest of his injuries. The next recent ones were the bruises on his face and ribs from various blunt objects. But the most problematic wounds were the cuts from day three.
“Here we go.”
“I’m sure you do,” replied the she-demon. “But I don’t have time. Not now that I have this new information to play with.” She waved Dean off with a flippant toss of her hand.
She tilted her head and smiled. Her body transformed, hazy at first, like a mirage, and finally all at once. Her clothes were the same, but her hair had turned from red and curly to straight and black. Eyes that had been big and blue moments before were now deep brown and almond-shaped. She looked like one of the Busty Asian Beauty girls.
He rolled his head to the left. There was only forest floor as far as he could see—not that he had much of a straightaway to study. The horizon tilted upward into a gray cloud. He turned his head the other direction and saw nothing as his vision darkened. This was the side of his shoulder impalement, and it screamed at him. More than that, it wept. The ground beneath him grew damp.
She and the doctor were in conference in the kitchen, their voices too low to be heard—at least from where Dean sat in the living room. He was wrapped in quilts and seated in a wooden chair while Cas lay stretched out on the wooden bench across the room. What the doctor had against cushions, Dean couldn’t guess, but not a surface in the man’s home was comfortable. Not a surface except Cas’s lips, of course. And his body. His warmth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Miss Rose let out a breathless, “Excellent idea.”
The next time Dean opened his eyes, it was to behold the beautiful face of a woman with blue eyes and flaming red hair. He balked and jerked away. Something crashed, but the edges of his vision were too black to see anything besides the shock on the young woman’s face. He screamed at her to get away from him, but besides the tightness in his chest, nothing happened. No sound came forth from between his bared teeth.
Second: Was it safe?
“Where are we going?” Sam shouted at Gabriel but could barely hear himself over the furious screeching of the succubus—or whatever the hell monster she was. Never in all his years of hunting had Sam seen a creature with eyes like molten pools of lava or a mouth that opened all the way to its ears. Maybe there was something in the lore, somewhere, but he didn’t think so.
The doctor’s voice came from the living room after he slammed the front door.
Doc looked appalled. “Six hours?”
Doc Emmerson stood and poured a glass of water. He looked over his shoulder at the ex-angel to ask. “Animals?”
“That’s better, right?” asked Jamie.
But now, Cas was halfway in the grave, and he knew it. The ex-angel was resigned to that fact.
Dean upped his pace to a trot. Balance wobbly at best, nonexistent in reality, Dean couldn’t form a straight line, but he kept to the road as well as he could. The distance between footprints remained short, and every fifteen yards or so, that body-smudge presented itself.
If there was one weakness Dean would admit to having, it would not be about fighting, weapons, or physical strength. He was tougher than nails and hard as shit to break. He'd been killed a number of times and it never stuck for long.
“Hey, we’re not done here!” Dean cried out as the succubus retrieved the pitchfork. He leaned as far forward as his bonds would allow. “I’m talking to you, you stupid, hideous bitch!”
Release after five days of pent-up desire was dizzying, to put it in very mild terms. His vision went red and black and white. His ears rang with his heartbeat. It was exquisite and painful. The orgasm lasted an eternity and nearly made him pass out.
"I thought," Cas said and took a breath to speak, "You needed me."
"Get away from my bother!" he shouted, wielding an angel blade and a murderous scowl.
"Sam!" he shouted. "SAM!"
Television.
but the doppelganger situation was a bomb to disarm later. Right now, Dean was conscious and unattended. It was time to think.
If Castiel were embarrassed or disgusted, every inch of his face would show it, and Dean would be forced to accept Cas’s distaste of the hand-holding moment. But right now, Dean didn’t have to look. He didn’t have to see if Cas hated how Dean had grabbed for him, if he despised the contact or felt disappointed in Dean. So the hunter kept his eyes closed and held on, both to Castiel’s hand and the fantasy that Cas might need to feel Dean's hand just as badly.
Doc studied the young man with a sympathetic gaze.
“It’s… hard to explain,” replied Cas.
Dean stood and moved toward the door. He grabbed a four-pronged pitchfork off a rack on the wall and held it tight in his right hand. He looked back over his shoulder, but not directly at Cas.
was nothing compared to the sharp, stabbing agony of sometime before—when the wounds were fresher and his motivation driving and all he could think was
Dean gave no indication that he could. He went to work untying Cas’s bonds and helped him sit up when they were free. Moving was excruciating, but being upright was a small victory. By the time Cas had caught his breath and the room stopped spinning, he had worked out a theory.
A hand pressed down on Castiel’s forehead, the weight and heat burning him. He tried to flee from the sensation but was too weak to move.
“I’m going to fetch miss Rose, and you are not going to get up.”
Both men laughed. Dean snuck into the tree line and hid himself in the dark shadows. He could see the others, now. Two men, both in good shape, average height, wearing grimy work clothes. On the ground between them lay a third man, unmoving. He faced away, but the shape of his shoulders, the curve of his waist, the way his hair lay on the back of his head—Dean knew without question that huddled, half-naked heap of man was Castiel.
"What?" Doc asked.
That was not encouraging.
“Well, we’re in a tight spot, fellas,” Doc announced. “Dean, how about you try sitting up? Go slow.”
Cas fought not to look up. Often, Dean’s eyes spoke truths that his words did not or could not. Maybe the mystery command would be solved if he could see the emotion behind the man’s green gaze. But without that context, Cas was forced to ask, “What?”
The doctor leaned forward with his elbows on his knees.
As hard as he tried, Cas couldn’t maintain eye contact as he admitted, “That I wanted to kiss you.”
Doc blinked. Dean forgot how.
“I am sorry.”
"Have something to say?" she asked as she tilted her head. She used the curved blade to lift his chin. "Speak up, Dean."
In moments, the hunter was tied to the table wearing nothing but his underwear. Doc donned his spectacles, had a bottle of clear liquor uncorked in one hand and a hooked needle and black thread in the other. Jamie was stationed at Dean’s feet to help hold his legs still, and Cas was instructed to use his body weight to keep Dean’s arms and torso pinned.
“It’s just a dream,” Cas urged, voice breaking. He held Dean’s face with both hands. “Dean, please.”
Dean’s vision doubled. At the top of the hill, he came upon a cobbled footpath. It was filthy, covered in a thick layer of black grime, but there were fresh footprints. Two sets of men’s shoes, it looked like. Dean blinked and forced his eyes to focus.
Castiel began by clearing his throat. Then he said, “We were tortured.”
"Next time," she began as she bent low to speak and ran the knife along his face. "I'll make sure you can't interrupt our fun."
“Dean.” The doctor’s voice was rough and low. Dean lifted his head and squinted through bleary eyes until the old man’s frowning face came into focus. Doc Emmerson wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his arm, needle and thread still in one hand and bloody rag in the other.
“Do you know how long Dean had been in her hands before you showed up?”
Dean’s heart rose to his throat. Tension closed his airway and stung the backs of his eyes but he would not cry. Cas needed him to be strong. The feel of the man in his arms, even through the veil of the quilted blanket, was more comfort than he’d had in months. Castiel’s hair smelled crisp like fall leaves. His broken, choked breaths on Dean’s skin caused such inexplicable yearning. It crossed Dean’s mind to sit on Castiel’s lap, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything so feminine, so he knelt before the man and looked up into his eyes. Castiel bit his lip and turned his head away. Dean gripped Cas’s hands, and Cas tentatively glanced at Dean.
Dean took several sharp breaths, bracing himself. His grip tightened. In a few seconds, he would break his thumb. But then he heard the lock on the steel door slide back, and he stopped, his heart in his throat.
“No shit,” Sam shouted. “What’s your plan now?”
Dean shook. The air was too thin to breathe. He couldn't speak. Had the demon literally stolen his voice? It sounded like it. Felt like it. She took Cas away, and the door slammed closed and locked behind them.
A hand squeezed his shoulder, and a soft voice said, “You’re gonna be okay.”
"Don't look at me," Dean said.
“Bye, Sam.”
Jamie nodded, his gaze fixed upon the ground. “I understand, just thought I’d mention it.”
Jamie addressed the red-headed woman. “I’ll be back before you know it, miss.”
"I don't know," he answered then grunted, "Not demons."
Dean kicked the leaves and went tumbling backward. He struck his head on a tree root, and the impact brought tears to his eyes. But it was frustrated despair that kept them there.
The angel lifted his chin.
Gabriel hissed a curse under his breath. The angel kept shoving Sam forward while looking back from where they came. “Oh, she is
But Sam never needed to hear Dean's voice to know what he wanted. He also never listened.
Dean shook his head.
“I’m not leaving you behind,” Dean growled. “We’ve been over this already.”
The demoness muttered something dark and ancient under her breath. Her irises glowed purple as the rims turned pitch black.
“Now, talk to me, Mr. Cas. Those miners who found you are good men, but they’ve got big mouths and wild imaginations. Half the town’s gonna know about you and your friend by now, and everyone’s going to be worried about what’s lurking out there.”
He grabbed the thumb of his left hand with the finger and thumb of his right. His grip grew so tight that the cuffs seemed to shrink around his wrist. Several seconds passed with mounting dread. He thought through every moment that was about to happen, and he pined for step one of his plan, wishing he could repeat it for step two and three and...
The demoness dropped to her knees and placed herself between Dean’s legs. He spluttered a curse, but she gripped his inner thighs and buried her face between his legs. She licked the wet spot on his jeans like a cat lapping up milk.
He was beginning to think he'd never leave this place, so Dean's first order wouldn't be hard to follow. The second one, however, was becoming troublesome with each passing moment.
Having to eat regularly was an annoyance. The human body hungered and demanded food. It needed water to survive. Angels had no such weaknesses. They didn't eat, sleep, or require any of a hundred other "human" peculiarities. But these pangs of thirst and hunger in Cas's being, coupled with the howling pain of his bodily injuries was a cruel reminder of how far he had fallen from grace. As if he needed any more of those.
, it said in the tone of Dean’s characteristic growl. The Winchesters had long ago taught Cas that secrecy was crucial to safety and success; and you couldn’t trust anyone. But all Castiel’s instincts told him to confess the truth. He wanted to tell the old man everything and believed it would be fine, but the thought of how disappointed Dean would be sent the truth flying back into a locked box inside Cas’s mind.
Dean whispered in his own voice from his own body, “I’d never treat you like that, Cas.” But a guilty part of him knew that he had been cruel in the past, too. It hurt to see his friend behaving as if anything that demon did as Dean was normal. But it killed him to think that his own words and actions had made it seem real enough to Cas that he didn’t even question her cruelty.
Cas rasped, “I’m sorry I couldn’t rescue you,” and the guilt-ridden self-loathing that burdened his friend’s voice made Dean’s chest ache. Then Cas added a barely audible, “I tried.”
"How about you put that mouth to good use, hm?" she teased.
"That's how long Dean has been waking up, bound and in pain."
Dean’s mouth moved in the shape of a weak laugh—a common and sarcastic, ‘no shit’ laugh that had once hurt Cas but now felt so normal it was almost a relief.
Dean was good at hiding most things.
"I was so close to seducing that angel," she growled. "Do you have any idea the power that would have given me? You are going to pay for your interruption, Hunter."
Doc’s voice matched. “Then you’re the luckiest sons of bitches I ever met. Now, how did you clean the wound? How did you stop the bleeding?”
Cas looked downward then, toward his feet. His heart hammered in his chest, reminding him of every wound along his body that still leaked blood. He was making himself bleed out faster. If he lost consciousness, that would mean Dean would have to carry him to safety. They'd be caught.
As Sam staggered uphill toward the road, he clutched the glowing vial of Gabriel’s grace and prayed they would all survive.
“That's bull, and you know it!” he shouted. “You’ll bleed out, or the succubus will find and torture you before killing you. I won’t have your death on my conscience. I refuse.”
Gabriel touched Dean’s forehead, and it was like a bolt of lightning went through his whole body. Dean couldn’t scream, couldn’t move, couldn’t think, and he hoped to God he wasn’t pissing his pants. The angel injected Dean so full of whatever the hell was coursing through his atoms that every hair on Dean’s body stood up straight and he feared he might explode like a burrito heated up too long in the microwave.

“He won’t wake up,” said the fearful voice of their youngest rescuer. “I was comin’ to see if Doc needed any more help on my way to work and I found Dean on the ground, and I keep tryin’, but he won’t wake up.”
"Dean, I'm sorry. I was trying to--"
Dean’s maudlin guilt was burned out by raging flames of hatred.
Unwanted, his mind recalled the first glimpse of the basement; Dean with his head rolled back, his mouth slack, pants undone. The succubus straddling Dean’s lap with a knife in her hand. Her rolling laughter as she dragged the blade down Dean’s erection, drawing blood.
Dean stopped his soundless swearing. He gritted his jaw. His eyes shut tight, probably because the needle was piercing his skin again, but they opened moments later and searched for Cas.
“No monsters,” Cas replied. “Just a vengeful woman with sharp blades and heavy chains.”
he cried out.
Jamie reached behind himself for the door handle. “Miss Rose, do you need an escort home?”
"What are you doing?" Cas asked.
“Don’t ring no bell,” groused the man. “Good luck.”
A wave of nausea rose, and Dean pushed it down.
Dean’s heart picked up speed as Doc Emmerson hurried to the doorway.
“The water,” Cas croaked with his eyes stuck on every wasted drop that spilled to the dirt.
Sam seemed caught off-guard. The angel blade slipped and pointed at the floor. His eyes softened and glanced down the woman's body. He furrowed his brows, confused.
is you, at least. It’s like you hung the moon. No wonder he put up with what I did to him. He worships you.”
Holy—and with great emphasis—shit.
Dean wanted to say a million things, but all he could do was shake his head. Then the door opened, and the old man with the wire glasses entered the house with his hands full of brown paper bags. He glanced at Cas and Dean before greeting Miss Rose, who Dean had forgotten was there.
Castiel breathed a little easier and said, “Yes.”
court—that is, if Miss Rose was of a mind to—”
The doctor was inspecting Castiel’s wounds with such gentle hands that Cas hadn’t even been aware of his touch or attention. But now that Cas looked, he saw the deep worry lines etched into the old man’s face and deepening every second.
He was alone. And… and…
“Do you think you can walk?” Dean asked.
Cas nodded, panting. Dean ripped open Cas’s shirt, sending buttons skidding along the dirt floor. When calloused, heavy hands landed on the frayed edges of Castiel’s shirt, bracing themselves against his chest, Cas gasped out, “Wait.”
The more Sam thought through various scenarios, the more he realized the overwhelming likelihood of Gabriel’s aim having been off. The angel was weakened after running from the succubus and giving Sam his grace. And on top of being exhausted, Gabriel had looked scared. Distracted. It’s possible he had tried and failed to place everyone in the same safe location. Maybe he had missed by miles, but hopefully nothing more. It was likely this would be a different kind of hunt than usual. One not for monsters, but for brothers: his and Gabriel’s.
He stowed the vial of angel grace into the inside pocket of his jacket. Its warmth radiated through Sam’s chest as he continued up the hill, racing the sunrise to get to the top of the craggy peak. Finally, he heard the first signs of life and saw the stirrings of man-made light—an orange glow through the dingy haze. Then a mechanical whistle pierced the air, almost as loud and as horrible as the angry howls of the succubus had been. After a few short seconds, the whistle stopped.
Maybe the loss of his voice was for the best. What would Dean say, anyway? That Cas shouldn’t have come to rescue him? That Dean should never have left in the first place? They both knew it. Talking about it wouldn’t change anything. Maybe what was broken couldn’t be fixed.
“Did you see her patch up my shoulder?”
"I know that's got to hurt, and I'm sorry, but I can't have you messing anything else up. I can't worry about where you might be or what you might be doing that'll get us both trapped and killed." Dean put his hand on the door and lowered his voice. "Try to keep quiet," he instructed. "I'll find us some water."
A horrifying realization hit Dean square in the soul.
Something about her tone triggered an alarm somewhere in Dean’s mind. She spoke with authority, as if to remind the young man why he came; as if she already knew, or as if she’d given him specific instructions earlier. And while her smile was kind enough, her eyes didn’t match the expression.
“Better now?” he asked, his tone neutral but his mouth tight.
Dean reached for Cas’s right hand and pulled it over his left shoulder. He bent his knees and aligned Castiel’s torso across the expanse of his upper back. Then, with a breath and a mighty heave, Dean stood. He held Cas's hands and feet close together, making a tidy bundle and wearing Cas's weight like a shawl around his shoulders.
“Don’t worry,” she said as she opened the door. “I know you're lonely down here all by yourself, so I’ll let you watch this time.” With a smirk she added, “Maybe you can come on yourself for me again.”
The man’s hand reached up to the table and circled Cas’s arm. His fingers were cold and his grip weak as he squeezed.
“Cas needs her,” Doc clarified. “Again, I don’t know what the hell you boys went through, but it wasn’t a human woman who did this—“
Castiel opened his eyes, but couldn’t see for many moments. He knew he hadn’t moved from the kitchen table—in fact, he was still tied to it—and as consciousness returned in earnest (and agony with it), Castiel longed for the escape of nothing. Then he heard his name.
Castiel said nothing in return, and the doctor leaned in closer. The breeze from outside the window blew cold.
Dean nodded.
Dean mouthed.
The world twisted as the demoness moved forward into the shack. It was nauseating. Dean felt trapped inside her body and seasick with the uncontrolled motion. She kneeled, and it seemed like Dean was mere inches from Cas, but he was still so far away. He couldn’t feel the other man, smell him, or touch him. He could only look through the eyes of a demon and wish that this had never happened.
Perhaps the hunter should have been more worried about the nurse spilling what she’d seen. He was pretty sure a man could be killed for kissing another man in the twenties. It looked like Cas’s breaths were coming faster than before, and he leaned closer to the kitchen doorway.
Castiel wakes in a strange place. Someone is coming.
Dean made a wispy growl, then. The man’s lips moved, but Cas couldn’t read the words well enough. His throat tightened.
A gust of wind, cold enough to make Cas shiver, blew on the frigid air. The smell of smoke burned his throat.
The white-haired man furrowed his brow as he held Castiel’s jaw in one hand.
Her features shifted again, that same heat-off-the-pavement warp coating her body. He saw her eyes change color, flashing almost green across the dark room. Her hair shrank back toward her scalp, lightening into a tan blonde. Her skin darkened into a buttery tan. Her shoulders filled out. The woman was becoming a man. Her clothes were changing, too. Jeans. Plaid shirt. Bloodstains.
Cas held Dean tighter and closed his eyes against the world. “It feels bad.”
“He stuffed the wound.”
“Come on—” he growled at himself. “Get it—together.”
Dean squeezed the other man’s hand. If the angel apologized one more time for things that weren’t his fault, something inside Dean would shatter. He wasn’t sure if he would break things or fall into a depression too deep to crawl out of, but he knew it would be bad either way. So he held on tight and hoped Cas understood his silent plea.
Dean might bust his stitches and bleed all over the place in the process, but he figured he could make it to Cas, hoist the angel over his shoulder, and hurry out the door in decent enough time to outrun the old man and the red-headed woman.
at him!
A couple of yards away was a tall, skinny tree with some underbrush that might do for cover. Cas tossed his left arm over his right side and followed the momentum until he was face down in the dirt and leaves.
After a sharp breath, Cas monotoned, “We aren’t.”
The man didn’t respond.
Cas shouldn’t think about Dean’s body. He reminded himself of that often. The man was… a man. And while Cas knew precious little about humans, he knew that men and women were the natural pairing. He also knew that Dean was a big, big fan of women.
The doctor continued. “Now, I suspect you aren’t gonna tell me who did this, and I’m not going to force you for answers. But maybe you can tell me what kinds of tools were used? What methods of”—his voice squeaked out the next word—“torture. Over how many days? What exactly was done to you both? I can help you better if I know.”
Could a weapon be self-cleaning?
The succubus flashed a grin and a bit of cleavage as she turned. Her eyebrow arched in apparent surprise.
"But--" Cas began before being interrupted by his own shriek of pain as Dean hoisted both his arms above his head. Dean's free hand shoved another strip of fabric into Cas's mouth to quiet him. His shoulder flared with new, white-hot agony.
Just pain. And that meant this was real.
Miss Rose had a nice, smooth voice, but it sounded irritated. “I did warn you,” she said.
“Heavier’n a three-hundred-pound cart.”
Cas lay stunned, the physical pain muted at Dean's shocking loathing. But Cas remembered the man's prayer as clear as anything. It had been a soft, whooshing sound. A quiet, pitiful whimper. A last resort. A grudging need. But it had been sincere, and against all sense, that prayer had reached Cas. He had heard it and followed it back to Dean.
Cold sweat slipped down Dean’s back. His mind was his own worst enemy, always had been and always would be. Usually, he could fight the voice of self-doubt, or at least push it down, but this was different. This wasn’t his voice. Hers had taken its place, stolen his voice even from his own head, and she was laughing as he pulled his hands away from Cas to spare the angel his needy clinging.
But with his body sliced into ribbons and his best friend skewered and dragged away to suffer God knows what other tortures, Dean felt decidedly on the bottom of this mess. Bravado wasn’t working. Threats weren’t working. He had to think like Sam.
Then, “Your thick-headedness astounds.” Doc pinned his drink between his knees and dug the heels of his palms against his eye sockets. “If these men don’t die of infection in the next week, then you can come ‘round asking if they want to join the wonderful underground dust cloud of coal mining. But it’ll be at least a week, boy. At least.”
Cas, Doc, and Jamie exchanged glances.
“Of course you can, Jamie, my boy! You’re doing great.”
“I’d say so,” she practically purred as she sauntered his direction. A look of excitement and triumph crossed her features. “I can smell that, you know,” she whispered, and Dean tried not to look as panicked as he felt. Her cold gray eyes zeroed-in on his crotch.
"Why the hell would you ever think that?" he replied.
Finally, his breathing became easier, but as soon as he caught his breath, his vision exploded with white. Pain like knives stabbed the back of his eye sockets. He fought his screams as flames assaulted his eyeballs from within his head. As suddenly as it had come, the pain vanished, taking the white with it. Then Dean saw dark, blurred shadows.
God, he hated this bitch! He hated that she tried to use Cas against him. He hated that he couldn't show how much it hurt to see his friend in pain. Hated that he had to pretend he didn't care. He'd hoped to convince the succubus that torturing Cas wouldn't break Dean. But it almost did. God, it almost did.
“No courtin’ in my house,” he scolded, voice rough like a dog’s bark. “I ain’t got the stomach for it.”
"Dean Winchester," she stated. "I heard that you were insufferable, but I rather like that mouth of yours." She toyed idly with the paring knife in her hands. The rest of her torture implements lay on a table at her side. Save for that table and the chair Dean was strapped to, the room they occupied was an empty basement. It had concrete floors, work lights hung from low-hanging rafters, and a stuffy mildew smell that sank into everything.
Dean’s voice sounded relieved and amused.
That was accurate. The Winchesters were incapable of leaving anyone in danger. The need to protect, to save, must seem like a curse to them at times. And as much as Cas may have wanted to hear, "I
"Do angels even have a type?" she asked, surprising Dean with a sincere question instead of a snappy comeback.
Charlie laughed a high-pitched bark. “You’re jokin’ ain’t ya? Here I thought you had no sense of humor.”
The demoness could still be in that funky little shack with Cas, kissing him or something worse. And at the end of their encounter, Cas had looked like…
Cas shook his head. “S-sorry. I don’t know why I can’t—”
“Now, you ought to lie down if you can stand it.”
Silence followed Jamie’s panicked outburst.
The demoness responded in a cold tone, “I know you did.”
Cas’s eyes adjusted enough to see the bleached form of Jamie kneeling over Dean, who was shaking on the ground with his arms and legs pulled tight. Cas knelt.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s hands clenched. But then Miss Rose entered the room, and Jamie’s face turned pink beneath the coal dust. He removed his hat to clutch it to his chest, and Dean scolded himself for his misplaced jealousy.
“Did you…?” Cas swallowed hard. He wasn’t sure why dread was coiling around the base of his spine or what he was so afraid of, but heat spread up from his gut as he asked, “Did you see her take off my shirt?”
Cas shifted his hips forward and pressed himself flush against Dean.
Dean let out a sigh, and his breath clouded around him. Then he heard the sound of Cas’s voice coming from the window above him, and his heart raced with a mix of fear and something indefinable—a feeling between longing and anxiety. He sat on the cold ground, his bare back pressed against the splintering wood, and listened.
but nothing happened. His mouth moved, but sound didn't come.
Dean obeyed, crashing to the floor, both hands still up on the table and reaching for any piece of Cas to hold: a shoulder, an elbow. The why and how of sharing their thoughts was a mystery but however it worked, he didn’t want to lose it. He couldn’t go back to how it was, alone and screaming into the nothing with no way out and no good way to express himself beyond glaring and stomping and head-shakes. He and Cas were all each other had in this hell, the only people who knew how screwed they were, and each other’s only hope of salvation. That’s if there was any salvation to be had at all.
“Oh, right. We should see if we can get you some paper or something.”
getting better,” she repeated. “Now I really can’t wait to play with Feathers! Of course, this changes my strategy.” She stood and leaned against the torture table. “Have you fucked him already, or are you just pent-up and pining for him?”
Dean’s eyes were full of agony. After letting loose a silent scream, his trembling lips formed the word, “Cas.”
The ground was hard beneath a layer of fallen leaves. The air was crisp and the sky gray. With the forest at his back, Dean faced West where the last rays of a vibrant sunset painted the sky orange.
Okay, new plan. Come hands-free. As soon as Dean took care of his obnoxious, needy, abused (but not in a fun way) dick, he could get back to the escape plan. And bonus! When the succubus tried to seduce him again, he wouldn't be so desperate to come since he would have already done so. He’d be able to resist her. This was a good idea.
To this, Dean nodded.
Dean became like a stone in his shock and fear. He couldn’t function beyond breathing as he waited for Cas’s response to the insane demand.
So it was a new forest. How had he gotten here? Who had moved him?
All of this was too much. He was still too tired—that’s why he couldn’t shake this horrible feeling or the image of the succubus. He needed food and booze and a good night’s sleep and God Damnit, he needed Cas to
Dean heard his own voice and could have jumped out of his skin. It was him speaking, but his voice came from her.
That was a good idea. And maybe it would be easier to figure out what to say to Cas if Dean could write it all down. He imagined what his opening lines might be.
Dean let out a huff. He hoped it would come across as sarcastic and funny but feared it sounded more weak and defeated than anything. Cas freed one of his hands from Dean’s grasp to tighten the quilt around his shoulders. He stared at the wall. His voice was a frail, heartbroken sound when he whispered, “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Charlie is standing at the stove putting together chicken fajitas when Dean stumbles into the kitchen at noon. She holds up a rolled fajita and waves it at him like a baton. “I was wondering if I should come check on you,” she says, dropping the fajita onto the plate with the others. Shredded cheese tumbles from the ends when she pushes three off onto another plate and slides it across the counter toward him.
Dean wants to argue, but he knows Ash is right. They need to get back inside, if only to do damage control. He puts his hand on top of Ash’s and squeezes. “Okay, yeah.”
It only takes a moment for Dean to look up at the sound of their approach. There is a brief flash of recognition and then a smile lights up Dean’s face. Castiel doesn’t let himself think about the warmth that blossoms in his chest at Dean’s grin either.
Lisa dives through the swinging doors and launches herself at him, the soft cloud of her black waves tickling his nose. She’s only a fraction of an inch shorter than him, and his hands land right on her hips when she goes in for a hug. Although Dean goes for guys these days, the aftermath of their short, memorable fling in college mellowed into friendship once the recriminations faded.
Dean’s hips are moving now, smooth rolls that push his dick deeper into Castiel’s mouth with each shove, so Castiel closes his lips around the hard length and allows Dean to thrust up into his mouth. “Fuck, fuck, Cas, so fucking good. Your mouth is amazing.” A few more shallow thrusts and suddenly Dean is tugging on Castiel’s hair, pulling him away. Castiel fights the pressure for a moment, as much because he likes the sharp twist of pain that comes with the tug as because he doesn’t want to stop, but he eventually allows Dean to pull him away.
Cas nods. “Thank you, Dean. Have a good night,” he says, closing the door on Dean’s response.
Dean takes another deep breath and blows it out in a long, slow exhale before squaring his shoulders. “Can they sit at a piano and play a piece of classical music they don’t know even though they’ve never played piano before in their lives?”
Caught up in studying Dean’s family, Castiel doesn’t notice the presence beside him. He tenses at the weight of a hand on his shoulder and turns to see Ash slouched insolently beside him. “Castiel Novak,” he drawls, squeezing Castiel’s shoulder slightly. “You’re not exactly what I pictured.”
Cas closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. “You haven’t seen them together.”
Ellen swats Dean on the arm before responding, “It’s no problem, honey. You know that. He’ll be asleep before he knows you’re gone and we’ll have a nice breakfast before dropping him off at your place tomorrow.”
When Dean joins Cas back at the fire, he’s smiling with the first genuine enjoyment Dean has seen all afternoon. “They were beautiful, Dean.”
“Be quiet.”
“You’re hurt?” Ben whispers.
Dean’s fingers skate across three lines of strange markings resting on Cas’ abdomen, just to the inside of his left hip. “And this one?”
Cas thinks about that for a moment. Would that make him feel better? The physicality of taking his frustration out on Ash? It’s not that he’s never punched anyone before. Chicago in the early 2000’s wasn’t as progressive as some places and being openly gay on the Northwestern campus was still a risk, especially in some of the clubs where Michael’s band played. He glances past Ash at the slight shadow from where the drywall has been patched, and a cold tremor passes through him. He shakes his head. “I don’t like violence.”
“Haha. You act like you eat that stuff under duress, but you forget I saw you drinking a kale smoothie when no one else was around.” There’s the sound of crumpling paper, then a door slamming. “Anyway, I wanted to see if it would be okay if I brought Eileen to the Pro Swim in Santa Clara. She’s heading back to Ireland to see her parents for the summer, but I thought it might be a nice distraction from finals. And you could meet her.”
Ellen rolls her eyes and biffs Dean on the back of the head good-naturedly. “She’s got a study group for one of her classes at KU tonight so Jenny’s coverin’ for her.”  She looks past Dean and adds with a wink, “Least I don’t have to worry ‘bout you hittin’ on the staff anymore. Good to see ya, Castiel.”
He catches up with them as they’re looking at the last display in the long hallway. “You ready to grab something to eat? We still have a movie and the Apollo gallery to go, but I’m starving.”
“I get it. Your family was fucked up, but you have to decide to stop letting them define you. You ran from your father, you ran from Michael, and now you’re running from Dean. Stop it and stand up for what you want.” She takes his wrist and smooths her fingers over the red marks raised under the band. “I can’t stand watching you do this to yourself.”
Castiel waits for a moment before he responds. He hopes that Dean doesn’t ask to get together tonight. Although he’s not hiding his relationship with Will from Dean, he has noticed that it seems to end the conversation quite abruptly whenever he mentions the other man. It’s easier on both himself and Dean if they just don’t talk about it.
He’s still standing in the parking lot, watching the taillights, when Castiel looks in the rear view mirror as he pulls away.
Dean chuckles as he pulls the door shut behind them. “You can pretty much presume you get dibs on the good parking spaces when you’re the first one here. Charlie’s on her way, but Garth has to work and Benny’s got something going on with the family.”
With more effort than should be needed, he pushes himself up and carries his dishes to the kitchen. Rather than wash them, he dumps them into the dishwasher and lets the door slam. Even though he hasn’t washed dishes since returning from Pontiac, the dishwasher is barely half full.
She frowns. “Don’t spend all night beating yourself up. I’m just hanging out at home tonight, so I could use the company.”
Dean can’t speak with the words stuck in his dry throat. When Castiel pulls away, Dean nods. It isn’t stupid at all. Whatever this connection between them is, Dean feels it too.
“What if—” Cas stops, snapping his jaw closed. This is exceedingly unprofessional.
On a side note, if anyone is interested in the calm down jars Meg makes with the kids, you can find instructions here:
The Winchester men have never been ones for chick-flick moments, so Dean just places his hand over his father’s for a second and squeezes before shoving himself up off the chair. “Come on, old man. There’s some firecrackers with your name on them. Better get ‘em going before the kids conk out.” The two men head across the yard to where the others are setting up chairs around the fire pit, the half-finished beer beside Dean’s chair forgotten.
Dean rubs his cheek against her hair, four-day-old stubble catching in the strands, and tries to imagine what life would be like without her. Though he’d had friends in high school and college, no one but Charlie ever stuck it out. If his grueling training schedule didn’t push them away, John’s snapping and growling did. If she gives up on him, this time he’ll have no one to blame but himself.
Cas sticks his tongue out in response since he’s the one that taught Dean to count the minutes with Ben when he was having a hard time waiting. “Fine,” he harrumphs, crossing his arms across his chest.
Dean huffs a laugh. “Yeah. He used to say that’s what he wanted to be like, a shooting star. Live hard, go out in a blaze of glory. God, we were such punks back then.”
Cas nods jerkily. One hand creeps across Dean’s chest until Dean reaches down to wind their fingers together. His other hand continues its petting, fingers pressing lightly to rub at Cas’ temple and the sensitive spot behind his ear. Cas takes in a deep breath and Dean thinks he’s about to say something else, but he just blows out so it ghosts across Dean’s cheek.
They continue their song until Charlie pads across the pool deck and takes her place with the other athletes. Dean scans the far edge of the pool where the coaches have congregated until he finds his father. He almost doesn’t recognize John with his easy grin while he chats with one of the other coaches.
Unfortunately, not everything is roses and sunshine for our boys and they have to deal with some ugliness. Trigger warning for homophobic slurs in the second part.
Dean bites his bottom lip. “He’s got himself worked up about something. You know how he gets. He’s a weird dude. We’ll be fine.” He grabs the pot out of the sink and shoves it into the dishwasher with enough force to rattle the rack.
Despite the waves of pain rolling through his skull, Dean forces a smile. “I’m fine. I’ll only miss a few days of training, then I’ll be good as new.”
Cas tenses, shifting like he’ll pull away again, but he doesn’t. He relaxes back against Dean with a long, slow exhalation. “We can talk later,” he says, tucking himself closer into Dean’s chest.
He’s done a thousand of these jobs before and mindless work is exactly what he needs. Raising the car on the lift, he changes the brakes pads and drains the oil. Once everything is empty, he reinstalls the plug and a new filter and refills the oil. It’s the simplest service they do, and he lets his mind wander back to Cas while he works.
“The guy who cuts your hair,” she snaps. “Who do you think I mean? The guy at the music store.”
Dean is silent, his throat tightening with emotion. Dean spent so long angry at his father that they almost lost this chance. Dean could have packed up and went to California with Ash and never gotten to build this relationship with his father. From a distance, it would have been easier to hold onto the pain and frustration that always came along with having John Winchester as his father. Instead, Dean gave up the person who meant the most to him in the world after Sammy and stayed to help John with his battle for sobriety. Because of that, he not only has this relationship with his father, but he also has a son who is now the most important person in his world. Dean figures it was a decent trade-off.
While Meg and Becky take the children out for dismissal, Castiel wanders the room straightening up. After his third circuit, he realizes that Meg is standing in the doorway watching him, hip braced against the doorframe.
“Yeah, Bela Talbot. She’s a bit snooty sometimes, but she knows her stuff. She got Allie to tolerate socks when I was convinced that she’d be wearing sandals for the rest of her life,” Jolene continues once they’re seated. “That’s her with Mr. Novak.”
“I don’t get to play much these days, but I’ve been meaning to bring Ben down to look around the store,” he says. He realizes how much he’s been meaning to do a lot of things with Ben but never seems to get around to it.
There are two people in front of them at the registration desk, but the line moves quickly. When they’re standing in front of the frazzled woman behind the counter, Dean motions to Ben. “My son passed out in class today, so we wanted to get him checked out. His doctor is booked, and they suggested we come here.”
Dean nods. “Got it.”
She throws her hands up in an exaggerated sigh. “How am I supposed to get an adequate dowry for you if he knows you can’t be a good wife? For fuck’s sake, Clarence.”
“I miss you, too. I can’t stand being away from you for so long,” Cas admits, letting his fingers tangle with Dean’s again as they continue walking.
Kali huffs a laugh and looks at him appreciatively, then her lips twist into a frown. “Keep them away from Castiel as much as possible and provide support when they must be in the same room.” She thinks for a moment, then adds, “And keep Meg from hitting either of them. My understanding is that it is only because Gabriel is a lawyer that charges weren’t pressed after Theodore’s funeral.”
“You got homework, bug?” he calls, walking into the kitchen to see about dinner. While cooking normally relaxes him, he’s not really in the mood to make anything elaborate.
Dean meets Cas’ eye from the other side of the car again. A family. This is exactly what it feels like. “As long as it’s okay with Cas,” he says with a smile.
Dirk glances back down the hallway where he came from. “Sure, what class? I can let you in.”
With everyone taking a few items, it doesn’t take long to carry all of the food to the dining room. Soon the long rectangular table is bursting with steaming dishes. The room is a bustle of activity as everyone shuffles to find a place to sit. Dean passes out bottles of the pale ale to everyone who wants one, skipping Castiel and John. Castiel recalls that Dean said his father is a recovering alcoholic as well. Castiel is happy to find himself between Dean and Sam, but the seating certainly doesn’t limit interaction with the others at the table.
“Are you sure you don’t want me to come over there?”
, Dean thinks indignantly. He isn’t sure how he expects Cas to handle the situation, but the approach Cas takes certainly isn’t one of the options.
“Breathe,” Dean directs, taking Cas’ hand as they backtrack to the gallery. He draws small circles on the inside of Cas’ wrist with his thumb, the repetitive motion grounding Cas. “You’re gonna to be awesome and everyone will see how amazing and super talented my boyfriend is.” He shoots Cas a wide, disarming grin.
“You’re having a hard time breathing?” she asked.
“’Kay. We got enough gas to get us to Indianapolis. We can switch plates or cars then.” Dean glanced at his brother. “I’m glad you’re back. No matter how it happened. Cas wouldn’t even let me—” He stared out the windshield and pushed all the emotions back down. “Wouldn’t let me go after you. I would’ve, you know. Even if they tore me to shreds.”
“Jess still using the lollipops to keep from chewing her nails?”
“And the bullets still being in him? What does that mean?”
“Sammy. You here to give me the Gabriel story now?”
“It’s…complicated,” Castiel answered truthfully.
Dean opened the door with money in one hand. “One meat-lover’s, one—” He stopped short. “It’s you. I thought it was pizza.”
“And you talk about the memory while doing this?” Sam asked.
A corner of Gabriel’s mouth quirked up. “Thanks, Mom.”
“Yeah, you got quite the track record there.”
“I’ve already packed and left,” Cas said. The sound of a car door slamming was clear. “I need to find a new place to stay. Someplace I can drive, which means Hawaii is out, sadly. Michael could track flight manifests.”
to him—and yet the only way Dean had accomplished this was to build an entirely new, entirely fictional world where nobody he loved had died. Did his actual life really cause him
“Are you certain? You’ve never offered to share a bed with me before.”
“There’s one other thing.”
Dean wasn’t sure how to answer that. Hard work, persistence, knowing the right people, making concessions, and sheer luck were certainly part of being published. But faith? He looked away, up at one of the skyscrapers across the next intersection before they started walking again. “How about you?” he finally asked Cas. “What got you into writing?”
“Well, I don’t like it. You’re right about that. But, you know, we’ve beat worse. I
hungry! Who’s ready to order?”
“Ooh.” Gabe held his hands up. “No can do. Sorry.”
“So, if deep down, I think I might be evil…or stupid…”
“Everything you experienced, Dean, even the painful times, they’ve made you who you are. And nothing says you have to remember all of it. You just need to accept it. Accept that it’s part of you.” He watched Dean stare at the floor for a while and continued on. “Humans learn through trial and error, through mistakes and failures. That’s not how angels work. That’s not how I used to work. I had a mission and I either succeeded or I failed. If I succeeded, I was given another mission. If I failed, I was…reprogrammed. There was no learning. Only doing. Until you, Dean. Learning is hard and it’s painful and I made more than my fair share of mistakes. But I wouldn’t give it up for anything, other than to save you.”
“About our wings?”
Castiel pulled out the only chair in the room from in front of a miniscule desk and sat down. “I understand. And no, nothing further. Except he complains a lot. It’s annoying. And distracting.”
“No, you’re coming with us.” Dean twisted Crowley’s arm behind him and marched him behind Cas.
“Loosen your arms,” Castiel coached him. “Shake from the shoulder down.”
” With a smirk, he filled a cup from what looked like an Icee machine, removed his apron revealing an AC/DC t-shirt, and moved around the counter. “One
“He said some things. That he was going to give something back to me. He seemed…unimpressed with the re-education in Heaven.” Cas fell silent, watching him for several minutes. “You can speak now, Dean.”
“Oh, that’ll make him a lot of friends,” Cas observed.
Gabriel gave a half-smile and his eyes seemed to lighten. “You ever been to Nashville?”
leave. You chased us out.”
Snorting, Dean shook his head. “Not in the least.”
The sound of his door opening woke Sam from a restful sleep with no hint of nightmares. He didn’t bother to open his eyes as he directed his thoughts toward Gabriel.
“Anyone else?”
“I’ll wait.”
“It’s a cab card. Registration. And it’s in
“And you’re here to warn me?” Castiel asked.
Oh. Memories of the previous night flashed through his mind. The shower. Gabe’s wings finally being clean. Him… Yeah. Then healing himself.
Castiel continued to stare at him without expression, knowing it would prompt Dean to answer more honestly.
Dean slid into the spot across from Sam, so Castiel took the chair opposite the laptop. He could smell the cinnamon in the hot cocoa and debated whether he wanted to drink it all now or delay his gratification for a little while. He decided to delay. The last time he drank a hot drink immediately after it was served, Dean became worried that Castiel had burned his mouth, as if he’d forgotten that was impossible.
Castiel could feel Dean’s chin nestled in his hair, almost touching his scalp. “I… Could… Could I stay with you?”
“It’s not the motel, is it?” Dean said it like he already knew. “It’s me.”
“Just…” Without thinking it through, Sam grabbed his clean knife and, with a hiss of pain, cut along his forearm, careful to not go too deep, yet deep enough to draw blood.
Dean tapped a few times on the phone’s screen. “Looks like it’s only about a mile between the two. We’ll have to work fast when it’s time.”
“It ain’t your decision, boy. That angel has saved your ass six ways from Sunday, and he’s a hell of a lot smarter than you give him credit for. Maybe he don’t know slang and pop culture, but give him the respect of makin’ his own choices. ‘Sides, then it’s one less thing you gotta blame yourself for later.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Castiel agreed. “I could make one, back at the bunker.”
“Yes, ma’am. Two beds if you’ve got it. My brother’s asleep in the car. Long drive.”
“Now,” Gabriel said, producing a metal clipboard with papers attached, “we have you scheduled for a colonoscopy this evening. Would you prefer coffee or lemon juice for your enema?”
“Speak for yourself,” Cas muttered.
“Maybe I am,” Castiel snapped. “Maybe I’m not some
“What?” Cas opened his eyes this time, frowning.
“I—” Gabriel approached slowly, as if he was nearing an injured wild animal. “I’ll try.” He put his hand on Cas’ forehead for a few moments, then stood up, shaking his head. “He won’t let me in. I can’t do anything.”
“Okay. Well, I think we got the plans for springing him as worked out as we can without actually being there. You got enough juice to do what you suggested?”
“If I’d brought those other crops, it would’ve taken me twice as long, and I’d have worked harder than you did. Why should I do that?”
“I’m sorry, Sam. Okay? I’m sorry.”
“Suck?” Cas supplied.
“No, not the diner, Cas. Cell phones work, GPS works, hell, even my credit cards work, though they're not exactly
“I mean, we own the rights to the Beast Hunters series. Your manuscripts are yours, but the series is ours. You cannot take the series or characters to another publisher or we will have grounds for a lawsuit.”
Snapping his fingers and pointing, Dean said, “I’ve got just the thing!
Satisfied, Sam grabbed his duffel with his good arm and headed out to the SUV. One last challenge stood between him and home.
Dean relayed what he and Cas had talked about regarding self-publishing, then Bela’s call and the series name issue. “Can they do that? It was
“Yeah,” a male voice called out.
It all made sense when Castiel saw what it was. A name plate. In white letters on faux woodgrain, it said CASTIEL.
Dean took a step backwards, away from Cas. “He wants me to smell the air. Don’t ask me why.”
“Regretting what?” Cas said behind him.
“Yeah. I’ll try. You’ll make sure he doesn’t run around unsupervised?”
“Naomi wasn’t the only one who took from you in this chair,” a taunting voice said from behind him.
“Is…uh…is this on?” Chuck said tentatively into the mic as he tapped it. “I guess so. Can you guys hear me? Should I talk louder?”
“It was like a confrontation. The Empty, Naomi, Metatron, Chuck, me. I don’t think I can even explain it. I really don’t want to talk about it right now.”
“When he went MIA, my mother couldn’t cope. She shut down emotionally. Most of my childhood was her parenting through intimidation and control. That was the only way she knew to run a household. Michael was, as the oldest, the quintessential overachiever. Bossy. Perfectionistic. Bal tried to get her attention and when she didn’t respond with kindness, he acted out, tried to get her to respond with anger. My younger sister Anna was the baby. As far as my mother was concerned, she could do no wrong, but she was depressed much of the time. She ran away when she was fourteen, found dead of an overdose two years later.”
“You are confident in your research?” Cas asked.
“Weak,” Uriel interrupted. “A liability. It only leads to pain and death. It will
Those long fingers extended themselves out to him in a handshake. “I’m Cas,” the stranger said with a hint of a smile.
. At least not for the next hour and fifty-three minutes. Give or take a few seconds.”
“It’s…a shield of some sort,” Cas said, examining the needle closely. “It doesn’t conduct any energy at all. Like some kind of armor?”
“You’re not on a walkie talkie, Dean,” Sam chided.
Dean ran a hand over his face. “Of course you would know that.”
“What would your protagonists do if an angel from one of CJ’s books showed up? Would they kill it?”
“It’s him! The escaped angel!” yelled another man—a demon, probably—wearing the unfamiliar uniform. The demon wasn’t looking at Cas, though, he was looking behind Dean.
Cas came a little closer again, his warmth a whisper against Dean’s body. “What do you want, Dean?” he breathed against Dean’s ear.
Chuckling, Sam turned around. “Only with my brother. Dean’ll never admit it, but he loves it.”
“Towels? That’s what you’ve got?”
you choose.” Cas glanced at Dean and gave him a sad smile. “I had to learn that one myself.”
“Just saying. But I have to put my foot down, Sam. No demons. I mean, I get it, they know the life, they’re not likely to die, but they’re bad news for you. I don’t want to see you go through that again.”
“I noticed. Did you do something to us? Or is it me? Everyone took off separately. Everyone’s angry. Every time I try to help I just seem to make it worse.”
“Why not? This might be my best cake yet.” He cut off a small piece of Castiel’s cake with the fork and held it out toward Castiel’s mouth.
. “It won’t keep out an angry, determined adult, but it should keep any kids out.”
protect that which I have sworn to shield.”
“No, it’s… I don’t know if you’d want to…”
Crowley scowled. “They’re not mine. All right? Traitorous bastards. Whoever’s pulling the strings at that angel council stole them away from me. From
They found Jack in a dimly lit corridor, sitting cross-legged, and looking defeated and forlorn, a far cry from what Dean knew he really was: possibly one of the most powerful beings in the universe, unafraid to kill.
“Dean, we talked about this. About being open.”
“Oh, come on, Dean. If I was gonna put you in a cartoon, I’d never choose
“Why not the city by the bay? Just think: cable cars, Golden Gate bridge…”
“Now I definitely don’t believe you,” Dean said, feeling every hope of finding a way home die within him. “You’re not getting this world, and I’m not saying yes, so if either one’s what you’re after, you can kiss those plans goodbye.”
“You don’t need my permission, Dean.”
“Ethnic cleansing?” Castiel repeated, amused at the words coming out of Dean's mouth.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up. “Since…? And you never said anything?”
“I’m not doing it again,” Jack said. “Not unless I know for sure I can get us to the right place. The right universe. This is all my fault.”
“No. But I can tell he’s in pain.”
“CJ,” Hester turned her attention to the end of the table. “What would your angel characters think about the Beast Hunters?”
—from everyone. Learned how to make all the desserts with a few not-man-made ingredients, which reminds me, when this is over and my sweet patootie is safe and sound, I’ll make an apple pie with some deliciously unearthly apples, if you know what I mean. And that’ll make your pet Dean-o gloriously happy, and I know how happy you are when he’s happy, am I right?”
Dean unzipped the duffel, reached in, and pulled out what looked like a handful of shredded towels. “Dude, what is this?”
“Only pretty much? Well, we can’t have that.” He held his hand up. “May I?”
Sam sighed, giving up on all of them for the moment, and dug into his sandwich. It was
do is stir the waters a bit, so when he jumps in, it doesn’t hurt so much.” He held out his hands. “Speaking of not hurting so much, let me have a crack at those ribs.”
Dean took the jug of holy oil that Jack had brought back from somewhere in the Middle East and formed a circle more or less centered behind the single-story office building at the front of the lot, using the old parking lot lines in back to guide him. The sound of a few nearby cicadas buzzed in the air, and aside from a few cars heading east from the diner, the main highway through the north end of town was deserted. He waved away a few fireflies, surveying the placement of the circle. As long as they could get the angel over here, they’d be fine. But the lot was so big, Dean was concerned about getting him in the circle.
Finally Cas looked at him level, maybe a little defiant, and Dean wasn’t sure whether to be scared of the answer or scared of the angel. “I drove your car,” Cas said.
Dean took the scarf from him and opened it to its full length. “We do this right, you might be able to hide a knife under here too,” he said quietly. “Probably too short for your blade, though.”
“They still hurt. Everything hurts.”
“Well, let’s see where that gets us.” Sam raised his hand. “Now, just notice.”
Cas nodded. “I… Yes, I think that would be good. I don’t wish to negotiate any more today.”
He stayed clear of small towns, taking barely-paved roads to avoid Northfield on one side and Cannon Falls on the other. After bypassing Kenyon, he continued south, looking for a good spot to pull over. South of Claremont, he found it. It was no more than a run-down shack, really, just off the gravel road, a copse of trees beside it and further surrounded by empty snow-covered farmland.
“Yeah, well this time, you’re not gonna be on your own.”
When the waitress returned with a Styrofoam container, Cas stood. “Read your newspapers, Dean.”
“Hey,” Dean argued, “going in guns blazing has saved our asses more than once.”
help.”
“You prayed for guidance, yes?” Castiel asked.
“One for sure. Possibly two. And they’re both likely armed.”
“Not so fast.” Dean stopped him. “Tell us about the demons at the border.”
Castiel began organizing the jam packets in front of him by type. “You know, Dean,” he said, his tone taking on what Dean liked to think of as his ‘Professor Castiel’ role, “in Moses’ time, Aaron, the high priest, would cast lots onto two goats on the annual day of atonement—one for God and one as a scapegoat. That’s where the term comes from, actually. The goat chosen by lot for God was sacrificed on the altar that the Israelites built while wandering through the desert. Aaron lay his hands upon the other one, transferring all the sins of the people onto the goat, and then sent it away into the wilderness. In fact, the goat was sent
“Breathe for me, Sammy. Deep breath.”
Castiel nodded. “But this part has actual experience to draw upon.” He paused at the sound of more crashing in Dean’s room. “And if the part that expressed romantic love no longer feels like he has to hold back, this part may not be inhibited by the rest of Dean’s personality either.”
He looked in the rear view mirror to see how Castiel had positioned himself, but could only make out his face against a background of black. Glancing over his shoulder, the rest of the picture became clear. Castiel was sitting nearly sideways on the bench seat, one wing taking up most of the footwell, the other pressed to the back of the seat, the main joint flexed forward and the flight feathers extending all along the width of the car.
“I have squandered opportunities,” Cas said slowly. “Because I thought I didn’t matter. Because I thought what I wanted didn’t matter. And, now that I think about it, I suppose I thought what you might want didn’t matter either.”
And maybe Sam could do something to treat those ragged holes in his wings.
“Then sleep.”
“No.” A sense of power flowed through Castiel at that point. “I know that is not true. That’s another lie, Metatron. You’ve done nothing but lie to me from the start.”
“Not as you experienced it, no. There was a short-term cleansing of the soul back then, when it was necessary. But then the soul could proceed to Heaven.”
“The bunker was built into the side of bluff,” Sam said. “There are no bluffs.” He approached a miniscule park at the top of a very small hill and pulled the van over to the side of the road.
Jack looked at Dean, who could see tears forming in the boy’s eyes. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to. I couldn’t…couldn’t control it.”
angel was not like the others, and certainly not an animal, but he found himself frozen in place, shocked at what he was seeing.
“You a hunter too, or you got some other fake life like him?” Hunter Dean asked, stabbing his thumb over his shoulder toward Husband Dean.
“Dean? How do you feel about Castiel?”
He could feel Cas pushing into him then, a finger probably, but there was no pain. It was like the best vibrator imaginable, and Dean felt himself relaxing around the intrusion, taking it in farther, seeking more.
“I’m sorry!” Sam said. “Did I hurt you?”
“You guys are—?” Jack looked between them, then at their hands. “I’ve wanted this for so long.”
Gabriel was suddenly in front of Sam, his arms out, herding them back the way they came. “In the diner. Back door.” He glanced at the crowd behind them and shouted, “Security and police are on their way!”
? Where’s the bunker?”
Sighing, Sam unlocked the door and opened it. He closed it behind Cas, staying out in the parking lot and trying to get a handle on his emotions. Dean’s body was inside the room, but
No. Not on his watch. Cas had already been through too much, had suffered enough. And yeah, he could be a secretive sonofabitch, and he could make world-ending mistakes, but the guy tried. And kept trying. And kept leaving to try more. If anything, the leaving bothered him more than the trying. The leaving and the lying and the withholding information. Dean would much prefer Cas just
“Really?” Sam asked. “How did you know that?”
Dean repositioned Castiel so he was standing in front of the side of the bed, then eased him down into a sitting position, Castiel’s wings stretched out to the side and resting on the bed. With a wink and a smirk, Dean pulled his own shirts off, kicked off his boots, and shucked his jeans and boxer briefs.
“So as a guy in air force intelligence, Michael could do the same thing.”
“Because of the bond? Is that like being angel-married?”
By now you know that I have compromising information on you. I have sent some of this information to your editor. I have no wish to harm you or end your career. However, I need you to understand that I have the power to do so and I am serious.
“Essentially.” Castiel took a step closer and averted his gaze. “No one has ever given me a wing massage before you. If there is a protocol, I don’t know it.” He met Dean’s eyes again. “What would make it easiest on you?”
“Bobby will,” Cas said. “I am certain of it. He won’t let anything happen to her.”
Castiel tried to discern what Dean was getting at. Dean’s emotions were so often covered up with layer upon layer of anger or shame, Dean himself might not even know what he was feeling. “I don’t understand.”
“No, Castiel. No arguing this time.” Gabriel set the plate down on the over-bed table and rolled it so the tray hovered over Castiel’s lap. “You need to eat all of this.” He sat down on the edge of the bed and held out a fork.
“No offense, Cas. I’m just trying to figure out what we’ve got to work with here.”
“Shit. And they’re still in him?”
“Dean…”
“That’s not the same as being invited, Dean, and you know it.”
“You’re in no position to be making conditions,” Castiel said.
“Hey, uh…” Dean was suddenly unsure how to say what he was thinking.
“So what happened?” Dean got up and went to the kitchenette’s tiny fridge, got out a bottle, and returned to the table. At Castiel’s raised eyebrows, he said, “What? It’s Dad’s. But I think I’m gonna need it for this story.” He popped the top off the beer with his switchblade, took a gulp, and sputtered.
“We can’t just buy you a solid blue tie?” Dean asked.
“Still afraid of clowns, huh, Sam?” Dean teased.
“Dean and I will do the shopping,” Cas offered. “You work with Jack. Gabriel is more than capable of making holy water and we’ll bring back bottles for it.”
Chuck’s words came back to him then.
Castiel started to speak out of defensive anger, then stopped. “Don’t take my word for it. Let me show you instead.”
“But you just said—”
“Yeah, I’ll look too,” Gabriel added.
“Hey, we got plenty. And maybe it’d help your wing recover faster. Boost your grace and all?”
“No, I don’t mean it like that. I mean, um… Well, you’re kind of tense. And you said back in the bunker when I gave you that wing massage that it was pleasant. And maybe it’d help you relax.”
“It’s Kansas,” Gabriel said with a yawn. “Whole damn part of the country is flat.”
Dean felt that tingling and buzzing intensify as if he was on fire from within. Carefully, he settled between Cas’ thighs, then felt Cas’ long, graceful fingers dig into his shoulders and neck. Dean groaned as Cas worked out a knot. “You’re a lot stronger than you look. Is that your samurai training too?”
Dean chewed his bottom lip. “How about this? Numerous miraculous healings, but at each of them there was someone—an EMT, a tow truck driver, maybe just a concerned citizen—who had his or her hands on the person who was healed. Or on a person who survived something unsurvivable. But then after the fact, no one knows or recognizes this EMT, driver, citizen. Is Waterville a small town?”
It was only a few minutes until Dean came sauntering back through the hallway. “Dean,” Cas began. “Do you remember shooting me?”
“Let me guess,” Sam said just before swallowing a mouthful. “Constance died shortly after.”
“No problemo. So what brings you to my temporary yet humble abode?”
“Gabriel…”
“What did you sing? For the baby?”
“Great. Just what we needed.” Dean let out a long breath. “Well, let’s get these groceries and meet up with the others. At least we know angels exist in this universe. Maybe Sam can look into that in his research too.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean pulled away a bit, even as Cas chased his lips for two more kisses.
“I’m still not clear on the nature connection. What does this have to do with what I do, what
Gabriel appeared first, Sam behind him, looking oddly nurturing. It was true that Sam would care for any and all injured animals, especially if they were of the fluffy, canine variety, but Dean was surprised to see that extended to Gabriel. “You guys going to eat?” he asked.
Dean took a deep breath while watching the occupants of the car in front of him. Uniformed police and National Guard scanned documents from everyone in the car, did a quick search of the trunk, and waved it through a traffic gate. “Heads up, Cas,” he said in a low whisper, digging out his wallet and rolling down his window. Sam’s forgery had better be spot on.
“Well, great. We can head out together. What airline you flying? I’m on Delta.”
He blinked several times, bringing Dean’s face into focus, the sharp pain in his back coming from the tree bark that scraped against him as Dean shook him.
“I tried healing myself and I got nothing,” Gabriel retorted. “Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.”
real, who’s still…” Dean swallowed audibly. “Who’s still alive?”
“It’s what I did while I was writing and sending queries out to agents. I restored my car, a ’67 Chevy Impala.”
“Aw, come on,” Gabriel said in a mock pleading voice. “We did some bonding during that ride back from the frozen northland.” He stepped closer to Dean and waggled his eyebrows. “Wasn’t it good for you too?”
Hesitantly, Bela handed them over, then steepled her fingers in front of her mouth.
“I do not like feeling powerless,” Castiel agreed.
“How the hell could they hit his wings when they were in the etheric plane anyway? Wouldn’t they be vibrating too fast to be affected by bullets on the physical plane? Or something?”
“When I first saw Dean in Hell,” Castiel repeated, a little louder, “I didn’t see the demon he was becoming. I didn’t see the twisted things Alastair forced him to do. I saw the brightness of his soul underneath all that. It was pure and radiant and brighter than any other I’d ever seen. It was…righteous.” Cas turned to look at Dean. “But you didn’t see that. I think you still don’t. You see yourself as tainted by what you’ve done.”
“Modest too,” Husband Dean said with a grin. He took a swig of beer and set the bottle on a side table. “Okay, you’re on. You gonna forgive him?” he said, nodding toward Castiel.
Castiel sat on the foot of his bed, his eyes closed. He never used this room as a bedroom, per se, not needing to sleep, but it was a much-appreciated space to himself, a place to sit in silence and consider his choices. Within the rules and order of Heaven, choices were much like a game of chess. Make one wrong move, or the right move at the wrong time, and the game was lost. But he’d elected to play a different game. And that made everything so much easier and so much harder.
Dean paused for a moment, unsure how to answer that when the author was sitting literally six feet away. “I guess it would depend on whether they thought the angel was a threat to humanity.”
“Sam, you go ahead,” Gabriel said, stopping short of the table.
“Oh.”
Sam was quiet for a few moments, and when Cas didn’t continue, he said, “Cas… That’s how we see you too.”
“Jack…” Castiel began.
“Oh.”
“That’s great, Cas. Really. And this is still your processing. Jack can wait a few more minutes.”
Castiel was examining several different types of brass mesh when Dean overheard harsh voices. Always wanting to know what was going on in his environment, he whispered to Castiel, “Stay here. I want to see what’s going on. Make sure it’s nothing that will affect us.”
Castiel sighed with relief once they were in the van and heading toward the only grocery store in town.
“In case you hadn’t noticed, lover boy, my hands are literally tied.” He held up said hands, his wrists encircled with thick handcuffs marked in Enochian. “So are my wings, which hurt like hell, and I mean that literally. So thank you for the rescue and I’m sorry things didn’t work out.”
To make it easier for Dean, Castiel spread his legs, allowing Dean to settle in between them, then brought his knees up to his chest. “I trust you, Dean.”

after.
“I know. But not here. Not now.”
“Gotta love the memory foam. Careful, or it’ll remember you too.” The moment the words were out of his mouth, Dean realized what he’d said and turned away, embarrassed.
“It wouldn’t have changed our plan for how to get back to the bunker. But it may impact how we deal with anyone who might see us.”
“No! No, you can stay away from my wings for now, Einstein.”
“So he’s dangerous.”
“One you won’t. You might get angry. The other one you might. If I’ve been…reading things correctly. Or it might make you angry too. I’m less certain about that one.”
Sam snorted. “I wouldn’t call it
“Do you know how to remove an implant safely?” Gabriel asked him, still adjusting his wings with clear discomfort.
coming with you. I know how to fight demons. You can’t just spark this one out, right?”
“And we’ve got Cas here too,” Sam added with a gesture toward Cas.
“Dean and I did rescue you. Just today. I think that entitles us to some respect.”
Another man sat on a bed of animal skins, his long, dark brown hair covering half of his face. “This is not fair,” he said, anger and hurt obvious in his voice. “His work is easier than mine. Why should his gift be accepted and mine rejected?”
“Yes. I can do that.” Castiel licked his lips, then leaned forward again, kissing Dean lightly on the mouth, then pressing harder.
Castiel put his hand on Dean’s arm, stilling it. “What are you talking about?”
Chuck handed him the box, shook his hand again, and gestured to the steps while patting him on the shoulder with his other hand. “You’re gonna do great things, Dean,” he said quietly. “You already have.”
“Yeah, but I don’t want to move.”
“Fuck.”
“In a school lesson on human anatomy, you used a book with transparent pages, each with a different human body system printed on it.”
Dean hopped back onto the bed and bounced a few times. “How come?”
“Okay. So you’ve got a…
“Okay.” Sam kept scrubbing and kneading, feeling muscles shifting beneath the skin, the feathers fluffing like they did on the other wing. Then the trembling again.
“You think she killed Constance’s baby and then Constance killed herself?”

“To get away from Lucifer. He wanted me. I didn’t—don’t—want him.”
“Hey Cas,” he said.
Dean started to retort, but the thought of Cas as his

heartless dicks.”
“How can you need my help? You’re dead.” Castiel remembered Metatron’s cruel trick at the Gas-n-Sip. Of course Metatron would have exploited his hope that Gabriel might still be alive.
“That’s Doctor Gabriel to you, and you are currently my patient.”
, Cas. I just…um…” He looked around the surrounding area, worrying that at any moment someone might recognize Castiel for what he was, wings hidden from human view. “I don’t want someone spotting you, is all. If they’ve got demons at every checkpoint…”
“I think it’s old,” Cas said, still looking carefully at the pendant. “This isn’t a cheap knockoff. It might actually be an amulet, not just a pendant.” He handed it back. “You should keep it safe.”
Dean looked down at the floor and Castiel could pick up a faint blush coloring Dean’s cheeks. “Um…you know… Kissing you. And then all of a sudden you were gone. I figured I’d crossed a line. I’m sorry.”
Dean frowned. “Angel blade doesn’t have a point that small.”
Returning to his own room, Dean found Gabe looking like he was asleep on the couch, curled up facing the back with his wings hanging over the edge. “Gabe? You able to do
Gabriel snorted. “Well, that’s no fun.”
Memories from the previous session came unbidden.
“When I get the cash, yeah. How are you even here?” He stepped aside so Castiel could enter, then froze. “Whoa… Are you like one of the X-Men too?”
Dean couldn’t think of what to say, so he nodded once. As he climbed back into the van, he called over, “You want a ride?”
, Sam warned.
“Wanna play?” Dean asked.
“We can feel longing too,” Cas said, staring at the bedspread. “Even unspoken.”
“It would seem our presence has caused some excitement,” Cas observed, coming to stand unnaturally close to Dean. “They are not only taking photographs and video, but appear to be texting or posting. Their constant glances our way lead me to believe we’re the subject of their messages.”
“Uh, yeah.” Sam reached out to shake her hand, then indicated the empty seat across from him. “Thanks for meeting me.”
“Why didn’t you say so?” he said, already walking back toward the bunker. He heard Dean start to say something, then sigh in frustration and follow him. Fortunately, Dean couldn’t see his face and the smile Castiel didn’t need to conceal.
“Yes. Pharaoh Setnakhte. As I was saying, I had orders to prevent him from changing his mind to let the Israelites go. I questioned those orders. It was perhaps the first time I doubted their origin. But I understand now. He kept choosing to ignore the Israelites’ plight. He kept choosing power over compassion, so many times that he lost the ability to choose.” Cas leaned forward. “Jack isn’t there quite yet, but he’s on his way. I can stop him. Before he loses his ability to choose.”
“It feels real,” Husband Dean said. “But yeah, I’m starting to think it’s sort of a really nice delusion that I’m gonna miss.”
“I just meant…” he started.
“No! Lunch. Plan.”
“As a matter of fact… In approximately thirty-four minutes, if you continue at this speed, we’ll reach a gas station that has a speedy-mart. I’d like more snacks.”
Dean lifted his face, squinting in the mid-day sun, his smile as radiant as when he was alive. He covered his eyes with his hand, then scowled. “Who are you?”
,” Michael said softly.
Hester began with the questions she’d emailed to all of the panelists, questions typical for an author panel. How did you get started writing? Why urban fantasy? Where do you get your ideas? What’s your most favorite and least favorite part of writing? What’s next for you—what are you working on now?
“Nevertheless, it’s in your contract. Which you signed. We
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel stepped inside the room and closed the door behind him. “There are two other children I’d like you to meet.”
“I had a memory. Talking with David before his battle with Goliath.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, stepping forward, “are we still going to—” He broke off as he executed a perfect stumble, tripping over his own foot, and spilling the water all over the stranger’s arm, torso, and leg.
Dean did and noticed that his hands felt much heavier. It was like he could actually feel the blood flowing through them. “They’re tingly,” he said. “That’s it? That’s what you did?”
“My apologies, Professor. I believe I’m in the wrong office.”
“Yes. That was really him.”
Hunter Dean rolled his eyes. “I don’t know you two,” he said, following them out the door.
He made a mental note to tell Dean about this when he got home. Of course Dean would never hear of following a truck. Dean was always a leader, not a follower. Except when it came to Dad. Sam shook his head out of the memory, careful of his wounds. That was better saved for when he wasn’t driving through the mountains on a single lung. In the meantime, he followed the Navajo and the river, parsing out his shallow breaths in time with imagined waves.
Good morning, Dean. This is Cas. I saved a seat for you at table #11.
They continued on the drive to Lawrence talking about more banal topics: Sam’s growing practice, a possible promotion for Jess, and looking into pre-kindergarten programs for Gabe. Partway through the trip, Dean’s phone buzzed. He pulled it out as Sam chatted on about some case he’d won, and glanced at the screen, then smiled and unlocked it.
Out of his peripheral vision, Castiel could see Dean’s frustrated expression, and he knew he’d made the right decision to have Sam lead this.
“You’d be right. It was only a few days later. I mean, the timing makes sense with a suicide; I can’t imagine her grief. But it just wasn’t who she was. And there’s something else too.”
“You should come, Dean. Besides, I think I’d like to have you there.”
how miserable you were last fall, when Cas was dead? I do. I have
“No, Cas…” Dean reached out to touch his shoulder when his phone beeped from the pile of clothes he’d brought out of the bathroom, He dug it out, swiped the screen, and nodded once. “Sam’s done. Gonna rest and head back. Looks like we’ll all get back to the bunker around the same time.” He grinned. “Come lay down okay? I’m not gonna be able to sleep if you’re sitting there. Last night wasn’t so bad, right? I don’t even need your wing tonight. Heater works fine.”
“Eh, it was nothing.”
“Yes. I’m now realizing that.”
Sam held Gabriel’s gaze, refusing to let him wiggle out of this one.
“I am sorry about that.”
“Are you kidding? Chuck Shurley is speaking. Dude’s like a god in the fantasy genre. None of this would be possible without him.”
“Great. Fan-friggin-tastic.” Dean chewed on his lip as he drove, nudging the speed up to ninety-three. “So, you got both a clock and a whole astronomical chart in your head, huh? Anything else you want to share?”
“Except…” Cas began.
“I guess. Just don’t— AH!” Gabriel recoiled as the cuffs sparked and smoked.
Dean took another swallow of beer and was silent, his mouth moving as if he was chewing on the insides of his cheeks. “You ever listen to that mix tape?”
He let out a short laugh. “My dad asked her once why she didn’t choose flowers that were safe, you know, with little kids in the house. And she said she respected roses ‘cause they could fight back.” Dean swiped his hand over his face. “In retrospect, knowing now that she was a hunter, that makes sense.”
“Yes.” Castiel turned the phone off and placed it in the glove box, then pulled his own phone out of his pocket and did the same.
“Hey!” Dean shouted, stepping on the brakes and pushing the feathers away while ducking to try and see out the windshield.
“So you’re the angel of the strength to resist desires, and you do exactly the opposite?”
“You have your computer, Dean?”
He almost panicked then, but somehow the clear thought came through that either Dean or Sam would speak up if they noticed him leaving, and he allowed himself to trust them. Left to right to left, he was lulled by following the ink spot, still feeling like he was floating and disconnected, but not as worried. Just as he fully relaxed into the sensation, Sam lowered his hand slowly.
“Why would they not want to see you, Dean?”
“Uh… Thank you. How are you doing?”
Jack nodded. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and let it out, then reached out his hand toward the pen, his face scrunching as he focused.
“Excuse me?” Dean’s mind was racing. They’d stayed in Cas’ room until checkout on Sunday, and avoided any public displays of affection in the hotel. They didn’t kiss again until— Dean’s breath caught in his chest. The light-rail train on the way to the airport. And then after they were through security at the airport. At a coffee shop in the terminal.
“Happy happy joy joy,” Dean said. “You got anything positive to share?”
One moment, the brass mesh was still sitting precariously on the dashboard. The next, Gabriel had it in his hands, examining it briefly, before settling it around the back of his neck.
“I know. I hope to change that for you.”
“I want you,” Dean whispered.
“And we’ll deal with it. We’ll find Jack. We’ll…stop him somehow. It’s what we do. But we can have a little of what we want too, you know. Take it where we can get it. ‘Cause, man, I don’t know how long we’ve got. And I’ve…” Dean let out a long breath. “I’ve been thinkin’ about quitting. I’m getting older. Let some of the younger hunters have a turn. Thought about you, me, Sam…hanging out on a beach somewhere.”
Dean grinned. “I like the sound of stimulation.”
Castiel gave himself over to Dean’s attention, acting on some base instinct, only aware of
It was time to ask for help. He started with Barb, since she was right across the road. He hated to wake her so early, but figured that with young children, middle-of-the-night wakings weren’t completely foreign.
“You don’t know what I’m going to say, Dean.” Cas let his wrist go. “Now look at me.”
“That’s cool. I wouldn’t mind being able to get rid of stress like that.”
Dean leaned his head back against the headrest, feeling a post-flight headache coming on. “His name’s Cas. He writes as CJ Novak.”
“Do you think you’re less whole because your grace isn’t at full power?” Sam asked.
Cas went over to the short dresser across from the bed and opened a drawer. “Wallpapered my bathroom with them, so I could be reminded of my failures in the appropriate location.” He pulled out a pair of navy blue swim trunks and handed them to Dean. “I’ll be honest with you. I don’t take rejection or failure well. And I know that acquisitions editors make subjective decisions based on interest and marketability. Self-publishing was a way to bypass that. I knew I wanted to make the first book a success, and I was confident I could fare better on my own.”
“Sam? Honey? I’m outside your door. Can you let me in?”
Castiel wondered why Dean kept using the term
“You said before that you didn’t want anyone messing with my head.”
“Yeah. Thanks, Sammy. I’ve got to run. Got a panel coming up about paths to publication and from the lineup, I’m pretty sure I’m the only author signed with one of the Big Five.”
“Uh huh.” Gabriel nodded sagely.
hospitality. Now, if you don’t mind…” Crowley raised his hand, fingers poised to snap.
Sam felt sudden anxiety course through him. “We need to find Jack.”
! I am the king!
“Mornin’ sunshine,” Dean said, wrapping one arm around Castiel’s shoulders. “Want some coffee?”
That thought soured his stomach even more, and he reconsidered the motel, if only to delay the inevitable. Carefully, he pulled his phone out of his jacket pocket and texted one-handed to his brother.
“Good.”
“I’m not here to judge your housekeeping skills, Ms. Elston.”
“I have lived a very long life. If I spend the remaining few years human, assisting you and Sam, I am content with that.”
“’Specially us,” Dean added before he shot a guilty look at Sam and made a point of pinching his lips together.
“And what am I supposed to call you, Dean? Beast?”
“Easy there,” Crowley complained. “No need to wrinkle the suit.”
The crowd laughed.
“You, Cas… Want you.”
“An organic compound produced by bacteria, yes,” Cas said. “The compound C-twelve, H-twenty-two, O.”
“I believe this will work, Dean. I believe this is what Chuck wanted me to see. The answer I had that would help us with Jack. And the reason why Chuck won’t interfere.”
“What’s your name?” he asked gruffly. He could see his breath in front of him and for a moment felt icy fingers on his jaw. Then it all suddenly disappeared. “Oh come on!” Sam called out. “Are you afraid of me?”
“No.”
or anything. I forget that to humans, it seems more final. It’s hard to restrict my perspective to such a small box.”
Dean felt his core muscles clench as another shudder moved through his body. “Holy fuck.”
"I'll love you when you stop making a fuss in my library," Castiel blurts, his eyes filled with genuine joy as he watches Charlie's initial enthusiasm slowly fading.
"Thanks… for the help," Castiel says meekly, glancing at Dean over the rim of his glasses, before shifting his eyes to the almost fully arranged books on the floor.
For the first time in nearly twenty-four hours, Dean feels something close to relief swiftly flooding into him. He drops his backpack on the ground without thinking, and then takes a step forward to bridge the gap between their bodies.
"Thank you," he murmurs, the word fading into a soft moan as Dean's tongue swirls over his nipple.
"Need some help?"
Dean smiles in response and leans forward enthusiastically, invading Castiel's personal space as he fixes up the, according to him, troublesome section of the track. Castiel's earlier compliment is said right over his hair without realizing it and he doesn't even notice how close they are now, their legs brushing under the table.
The other student stands up and carries the pile of books into his arms.
"Do you need a ride to your bedroom?"
Castiel doesn't move his fingers away, and he doesn't withdraw his when Dean finally speaks, maybe he should, but neither of them are pulling away. They both get a few inches closer without realizing it, and Castiel tastes the taste of coffee on Dean's lips when they kiss.
It's inevitable and while neither of them knew what to expect, they both just melt at the contact. The headphones fall to the ground, but Dean doesn't care, he's too busy because this is a moment that he had been imagining over and over again in his head. Not even her most vivid fantasy could even compare to the reality of kissing Cas.
Castiel quickly realizes it and tries to hide his smile by biting his lip.
Less talking… ”Dean interrupts, grabbing the condom and tearing the paper with his teeth. "And more of those nice noises, okay?"
"I'm talking to you, Charlie."
Castiel leans his back against the shelf, but has the audacity to rub his body against Dean slightly, his lips are red and slightly swollen from the previous kiss.
Castiel isn't in composition class, but he's in Literature class — and many others, obviously, but Dean can't remember why he was staring at Castiel's face the whole time and didn't really pay attention to his words. Dean heard Castiel recite things as profound as they were beyond his comprehension, often when they were alone or when Castiel was lost among the shelves in the library. He loves his voice, but he shouldn't be thinking about it right now.
"You can't judge a book by its cover," Castiel replies with a smile as he tugs on Dean's shirt a few inches, but can't lift it any further without Dean's help. "In addition, we are surrounded by tables ..."
Castiel is rummaging through his backpack, but stops for a moment to tilt his head slightly to the side, not understanding.
"Well, I heard about you at a party recently, and someone said you worked with one of the station announcers… Besides, Charlie is pretty loud when she calls out your name in the library."
"Yeah, but I know you're busy today. It can wait."
Castiel smiles and puts the sweater on, pulling it over his head. He rests his arms on the table and jumps down, which is probably a mistake because he wobbles and his knees almost buckle when his feet hit the floor. Dean walks over to help, but Castiel shakes his head and shakes his backpack, straightening up and setting it on the table, raising his hand when Dean opens his mouth to speak.
A few hours pass, and then Charlie and Sam come down the stairs together, both with backpacks slung over their shoulders. Charlie sees Castiel but only raises his eyebrows. After signaling Charlie to move on, Sam heads toward the reception.
Castiel's eyes close in the last seconds of his orgasm and he moans shakily when their foreheads are pressed together. They just stand there, their limbs tangled with each other in their post-orgasm, their lips pressing soft kisses to each other's hot skin.
So now, and just to be an annoying girl who likes to have fun at the cost of her best friend's suffering, Charlie decides to start making a bit of a fuss; he chews his food audibly, slams his textbooks against the table and other things to make as much noise as possible to draw Castiel's attention to his table.
Castiel's shoulders sag at that statement and he outlines a very weak but believable smile.
"Kiss me again, Dean." Please.
Charlie is a good friend, or at least most of the time, but in Dean's opinion she is too conspicuous for his liking. Like now, as he watches her waving her hands and earning several looks, as if Dean couldn't see them. There is a more or less hidden table on the second floor of the library, near the history section, which they quickly turned into their unofficial meeting place.
"I know," Castiel says, as he slides a book into one of the spaces on a shelf to his left. "... Excuse me, that must have sounded creepy." He smiles slightly and Dean stares at Castiel's lips for too long. "You make music, right?"
Eight classes, plus his temporary occupation in one of the labs - courtesy of Lisa, who didn't stop bothering him until he agreed to help her with one of her ridiculous projects - and a part-time job as a music mixer for the host of the night show at the university radio. Which meant he didn't have enough time for one of the most important physiological needs: sleep.
He briefly nods to Dean and Charlie before leaving and disappearing behind one of the bookshelves, going downstairs before checking in and starting work.
Castiel does not have his glasses on, and they are not on his head. It's not unusual for Dean to see them, but he can see the blue color of their eyes more clearly when he gets closer.
"Shit," Castiel breathes against Dean's lips, the ones he kisses quickly once more. "This is definitely better than a bed.” And Dean can't stop laughing, his mouth splitting into a full smile. Castiel laughs too and lowers his legs. "You know It's true."
"I… didn't bring anything with me."
"I like you," he blurts out, and that catches Dean's attention immediately. Castiel still keeps his grip on Dean's wrist but his voice escapes in a silent whisper " A lot. I like you so much."
"The sweater too?"
When he's done, Castiel gently removes his headphones and shakes his head to fix his hair. He runs one of his fingers to his lips in a thoughtful gesture, when something occurs to him that might help Dean figure out what is bothering him about that particular clue.
And Charlie quickly picks up on the change, because it's too obvious that they like each other. He sees them exchange glances as Castiel passes by their table, and Dean glances at the librarian wherever he goes.
“Unavailable?” Cas supplied.
Castiel was eager to follow that thought but then Sam lowered his hand. Time to breathe.
“And how do we do that? It’s not like being possessed?”
“No…”
Castiel shook his head. “You said I was a warrior. I was the only one strong enough to do the trials, to close Heaven. Now you’re saying I’m weak. Which is it? Which one’s the lie? Or are they both lies?”
“Do we need to take him to the dungeon?” Sam asked.
On the way back to the kitchen, Castiel paused to ask Sam, “Have you found anything?”
Looking at the list, he chose the hardest one first: Call Sam.
“Yeah, uh, Jack…” Dean cleared his throat. “It’s Dean. But maybe you already know that.” He glanced around the room, silently challenging anyone to poke fun at him. “Look, I’m…uh…I’m sorry I’ve been so angry at you. I’m gonna work on it, because you don’t…uh…you don’t deserve it. When Cas got killed, it just…I didn’t know how to deal with it. And I took it out on you. And, uh…I’m sorry. Okay? I made some assumptions about you ‘cause of who your…birth father is. But, you know, I’m not my dad either. I’m makin’ some different choices. And I think you are too. So…can you come back? Please? Uh, Dean out.”
Demon Dean narrowed his eyes and glared at Lover Dean. “You’re such a slut. You gonna take it up the ass for him too? Love is a joke. It means nothing.”

“So what’s this about Sam asking something?” Dean asked again.
beneath his wing and closed his eyes.
“You know…” Gabriel began. “The whole trapping us in holy fire thing? Doesn’t really endear you to us. We’re powerful beings. That’s what we’re used to. Rendering us powerless like that makes us more likely to think about eating your entrails than giving you answers.”
“Ten points to the emotionally constipated boyfriend! Yes, it’s Hebrew. And it has three parts. We’ll work backwards. The last two letters—in English or Hebrew, as it turns out—make up one of Dad’s old names, before humans got creative and pretentious: El. The letter before it is a suffix meaning ‘my.’ Quick Hebrew grammar lesson: the ‘my’ modifies the part that comes before it, not the part after. What we’re left with is
“So, when their wings have to remain in the physical plane, with this law, what happens with the physical feathers? Do they molt? Is that even a thing?” Sam slid a few feathers through his fingers, stripping the gel residue and more grime away. Underneath, the color began to look like metallic gold, as if actual gold threads were woven through the feathers. Must be a trick of the light.
There was no point in going back to Earth. He would only remind Sam of his loss. He’d only stayed to be with Dean, to fight with him, to protect him. His mission was over. He no longer had a purpose. Dean had taught him about hope, about choice, about family, about love. Castiel now knew these things, had had a taste of their unrivaled sweetness, and their absence was like an unending hole that would devour him.
“Wonders never cease.” Cas sat up carefully, a slight shifting in his shoulder translating into gentle movement of his bandaged wing. He tried reaching for it and frowned.
“Cas…” There was maybe some growling that time.
Castiel surveyed the road, the ruts from tire tracks in between the lines of slush and snow, the piles of dirty snow along the roadsides from when it was last plowed. He nodded. “I know what to do.” Without saying anything more, he got out and walked eastward back in the direction of the jail, then stopped just beyond the overpass.
“Have you read a bible? Jewish or Christian? Book of Daniel, Ezekiel…angels are badass. Also, I’m named for one.”
“I accept your offer.”
“Yes.”
After another affirmative chorus, Chuck nodded and looked out over the ballroom. “Wow. You know, I never thought when I first said we should get together as fantasy authors and fans that it would have grown and multiplied to this extent. That seems like a long time ago on one hand, and on the other, it seems like yesterday. Time is a funny thing. But you all know that; fantasy plays with space and time.
“Um… Cas?”
“I’m still pissed, and we’re still family. Family gets pissed at each other.” Dean couldn’t help but look at Cas. “We say things in the heat of the moment that we don’t mean.” He shoved his hands into his pockets. “But, you know, we all had a part. Even Mom.”
part,
“It’s about the struggle to accept and love ourselves,” Chuck continued, “even in the midst of failure and pain. So I want to present this token of my appreciation and recognition to the author of this remarkable series. Dean Winchester, would you come up please?”
“Senate Republicans argued that the House bill did not go far enough to protect humans, citing the recent escape of an archangel, which left several law enforcement officers with non-life-threatening injuries, and thousands of dollars of damage to equipment. Instead, they favor shoot-to-kill orders. The president has already made his disappointment in Congress clear and announced that he will sign an executive order requiring that all angels around the country immediately have their grace—the mysterious substance that gives them their violent powers—drained and their implants updated. He has pledged a ten-billion-dollar package that will fund pop-up clinics to begin work in the next seventy-two hours. You’re listening to KSPN radio, your source for all the oldies here in Kansas, and this is Brad Leming. Coming up next—”
“Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.” He started on his eggs, pleased with himself for how they turned out. “We gonna let Cas stay hidden here?”
“Give me your phone.”
“No,” Dean interrupted. “Don’t go there. She had a part, yes, but now is not the time to put it all on her. I can’t take that.”
“Eh, you know Naomi. A little trigger-happy, if you know what I mean.”
“Okay, that wasn’t creepy at all,” Dean said softly, climbing into the driver’s seat. “Sam, you take a load off. I’ll keep my eyes open for that motel and a place to eat.”
Over angel radio he heard a summons from Naomi.
“Getting back to our own world and then taking the fight to apocalypse world and ganking Michael and Lucifer, once and for all, and getting our mom back…
“I don’t, but I’ll get you some new ones.” Sam set the supplies down on the couch.
“Yes, I can see you too, Gabe,” Sam said, his voice somewhat muffled as if he was turned away from the phone. “He’s supposed to be in bed,” he added to Dean. “At least his vision works too. Good to know.”
“We knew this was risky when we began,” Castiel said. “Go relieve yourself. The risk here is small. I’m an angel, Dean, not a child. I am fully capable of taking care of myself.”
“No, Dean. You go. I’m staying here.”
“Four and I’ll brush my teeth,” Dean countered.
Dean sat down at the kitchen table and grabbed hold of the table’s edge, focusing on his breathing as blackness encroached on his vision.
you had a choice.”
The semi had the word Navajo in large, bright orange letters, and he fell in behind the truck, matching its pace, and simply followed. It was almost calming, simply following the truck. As long as he didn’t get too close, there was little chance of him speeding, and an even smaller chance that anyone would want to hang out behind him for long. Nobody wanted to tail the trucks. As an added benefit, the icy road spray kicked up by the trucks wheels regularly wetted his windshield, allowing him to use the wipers without needing much wiper fluid.
“Of course, Dean. What do you think about bees?”
Crowley glanced at Cas, then sighed. “Enough. What do you want to know?”
He sat down at the kitchen table and brought up Sam’s number. “Sammy, I need your help again, man,” he said after his brother answered.
“You know,” Sam said, “he’s kind of got a point. We’ve probably hurt each other more than we’ve hurt anyone else. And we don’t talk about it.”
Snorting, Dean slapped him lightly on the chest. “Yeah, right, Sam. Like you’re gonna cook for me.”
“Maybe that’s the belief we start with. Sound good to you, Cas?” Sam asked.
“I disagree,” Cas said. “I think you’re excellent relationship material. We just have a few obstacles to conquer.”
“Oh. Cause, um…I know that them being out is uncomfortable, right? People seeing ‘em and making judgments about you. And I want you to know I don’t see them—you—that way at all. Maybe I can help them be a source of, I don’t know, happiness or something. Instead of pain.”
“I think there’s more to it than that,” Crowley said, trying to hold back laughter. “How old are you, my little one?”

“Oh. Well, it’s really powerful for, you know,
“Good. How’d you know it was me?”
When the machine beeped, Sam withdrew the plate and nodded his head toward the hallway. “Let’s go figure out what that witch did to Dean.”
Cas paused to take a sip of his water. “But I do a lot of social media. I schedule tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram photos. I go where my fans are on social media. I browse through Tumblr and Reddit. I lurk a lot.” At the laughter from the audience, Cas added, “What? It’s research.”
“Dean.” Sam stopped his brother in the hall. “What are you talking about? I just brought you a snack.”
actually felt…pretty good. “Yeah,” he finally said.
“I’ve been ready to John McClane these fuckers for days now. Gabe, let’s go with masking sound again. Cas, you be my extra eyes in the dark?”
“So…you can help?”
Checking out a map of the area, the potter’s field was right across the street from the US Energy Department campus and just north of the Grand Junction Police Department’s outdoor shooting range. A leisurely, completely innocent drive around the cemetery grounds during daylight was on the day’s agenda. With supplies for gravestone rubbing and a bouquet of flowers, he’d fit right in, wandering the rows of headstones. Tonight he could come back with an entirely different set of supplies. And then he could head home.
“I think I understand. And thank you.”
“Kate, I’m sorry,” Sam said, “but our contract prohibits us from taking selfies when we’re on location. So, we really appreciate your discretion, but we need to go.”
, whatever that looked like. And he thought maybe if he doubled-down on the closeness of their friendship, it would help. But Cas seemed…pained when he left. Deep down, Dean was afraid that there was one divide they’d never be able to cross: that it was presumptuous and selfish and maybe even arrogant for him to truly have a close relationship with an
“Hello, Dean.” Cas was sitting on a lumpy brown sofa, several folded blankets stacked behind him on the sofa back. The walls were a nondescript white. “How was your trip home?”
So now they’d met an angel in this universe. Funny how it didn’t matter what universe it was, the supernatural always found them first. But this angel apparently wanted to play mind games with them, while diminishing Cas to little more than a scared child. He picked up a rock from the base of the stone marker and threw it at the covered picnic area, hearing it bounce off one of the wooden supporting posts.
“Sam,” Castiel called, getting off the bed as well. “Would you come in, please?”
Maybe that’s what Cas was going to tell him, that they could be colleagues of a sort. Hunter and angel. But nothing more. Maybe that’s why Cas never seemed to feel like the bunker was his home, never really accepted the Winchesters as his family. Maybe he
“You embraced it, and ran with it,” Chuck said.
Dean shrugged. “He gets the job done.” He turned to Charlie. “What about you?”
“You want to fight me?” Naomi taunted. “Then fight me. If I win, you submit completely. If you win, I’ll leave you alone.” She leaned in, pointed the drill at his eye, and whispered, “But you won’t win.”
“Yeah. Your…brother or whatever. Are you actually brothers? Or is that an angel thing?”

“No, thank you Dean,” Castiel said, sitting in one of the dinette chairs. “I just want to talk to you a little bit.”

“I don’t
Castiel wasn’t sure what he was feeling, but he wanted to touch.  He held out his hands. “May I?”
“Still hurting?”
“I agree. I tried to negotiate—” Castiel broke off as the room and the chair suddenly tilted at a dizzying angle. He grabbed the arms of the chair to keep from falling, but it seemed he and the chair and the entire bunker were tumbling through space.
“It’s different,” Cas said, moving his limbs as Dean let go of his hand. “It means more, coming from you.”
He was about to change the channel again when the TV Lucifer asked, “What is it you most desire?” The real Lucifer
“The Jungian shadow aspect,” Sam said. “The dark side of a personality.”
“God’s not here,” Castiel said. “Just me.”
Cas looked everywhere except at Sam. Finally he stared at the table as if the wood grain was the most interesting thing on the planet. “He kissed me.”
“What did you notice?”
“I’ve got this thing,” Dean started. “My agent—”
Dean scowled. “So you’re just weird, then?”
“Dean,” he said, tugging gently back. “What do you see around us?”
Castiel felt those same doubts rise again. “You can love someone and still not intervene when bad things happen. I’m not a parent, but I can imagine that’s part of letting them grow up. Making their own choices, both good and bad.”
Cas adjusted his position on the bed, turning more fully toward Dean. “Go on.”
Sam glanced at Cas, inhaled through his nose, then smiled. “It smells like spring.”
you.”
As it turned out, everyone else was up. Cas sat at the kitchen table, nursing a mug of coffee while Sam finished preparing some disgusting-looking green shake with bits of—were those
If you’d prefer not to geek out with me about books and publishing, and would rather see if you caught all the canon references, just scroll down to where it says TRIVIA AND REFERENCES.
“I’d like to meet him too,” Cas said, looking over the back of the sofa. “Anytime is good for me.”
Gabriel stopped and turned around. “Not hard so much as unfamiliar. What can I say, Sam? Something about you makes me want to be better.”
Dean didn’t seem to notice and ran into his room and jumped onto his bed. “I did drawings here too!” He leaped off and ran to a small table with drawings on it. One was similar to his pencil drawing, only in bright colors. Yellow for Castiel’s coat, brown for his hair, ebony black for his wings spread out slightly beside him, and bright blue for his tie and the tips of his feathers.
“How does it work?” Sam asked.
“Sorry,” Dean said.
“Ba—” Dean’s worried look increased tenfold. “Dude. How does she know about my car?”
“That’s because I haven’t done any.”
Just after dusk, Sam drove along 26⅞ Road, half-wondering if Grand Junction also had a 9¾ Road, and if it wasn’t visible to everyone.
“Whoa, what do you mean the series name?”
“The woman, yeah.” Sam moved away from the stove and let Dean take over. He went to his laptop and tapped a couple keys. “Constance Harrison, twenty-three, widowed as of the 1920 census. Husband William is deceased. The baby was five months old when the census was recorded, six months old when he died.”
.” He raised his bound wrists as if an example.
“Right. I mean, he could have recorded our conversation, but I don’t think he would. He didn’t tell me he was doing anything other than taking notes. And he asked about that before he did it.” Dean’s paranoia began manufacturing scenarios. What if Cas was lying to him? What if there was no break-in? What if Cas
“What the hell was that all about, Sam? Are we in bizarro world again?”
with Dean, Castiel felt much more ready to face a new day and try a second session. He knew that Dean was a little out of his comfort zone—his constant use of teasing to deflect his real feelings was obvious—but he was grateful for what Dean had offered, and he would treasure those memories forever.
Search results showed that some people absolutely believed, and others considered the idea religious garbage. A familiar name caught his eye and he clicked on it, his eyes widening at the sheer number and types of results about Cas. And Cas was mentioned a lot with respect to Dean. Sam followed links to groups on Facebook, hashtags on Twitter, even a foray into Tumblr, where he had to alternate between wanting to bleach his eyes and laughing hysterically.
“It’s a diner,” Cas said. “What is there to ‘get?’”
“Yes, he did. He’s always thought that about me. And he’s right.”
“Dean.” He opened his wallet, still trying to understand the monetary system here. The paper money was easy, but why’d they make the biggest coins the smallest denomination? And what was anyone supposed to do with a half-shekel anyway?
“Yeah. And eating. Dean’s sleeping, by the way. Thought you might want to know.”
“’Kay.” Dean grabbed Castiel’s untouched beer. “I’ll be here, then.”
“You are a car accident just waiting to happen,” Dean said, hearing his tone harsher than he intended it.
of them. I’m gonna do a perimeter check, but I don’t think it came from outside. No alarms were set off. Just the breakers.”
“Dean, you don’t want to be on his bad side. He’s—”
Barb sucked in a gasp. “I knew I hated that basement.” She continued to dress Sam’s wounds carefully. “I guess I kind of feel sorry for Gwendolyn, if she lost her baby and then had to watch her landlady have one. But it doesn’t excuse murder.”
“Dean Cave or my room?”
“Yeah, I do, Dean. Taking care of everyone else before yourself. How’s Cas?”
“Do you feel that?” Michael asked.
Castiel stretched his wings slightly out to the side, mindful of the space.
“He is.”
“Shit,” Dean swore and dove for the bottle. He snatched it up and took several healthy gulps from it as if to reassure himself that there was still some inside. There wouldn’t be if he didn’t slow down, though. It was becoming strange that Dean hadn’t tried to share. It was also strange that he hadn’t untied Cas yet. The hunter leaned against the shelf along the wall and set the water bottle by his side.
Dean’s anger helped ground him to reality, even though he was blind to his own environment as long as the demoness was broadcasting hers to his brain. He had to block her out. This was exactly what she wanted—to make Dean angry, to keep him hot-headed and stupid. He wouldn’t fall into her trap.
Cas's mind processed this in a broken, fractured way. Dean's words repeated through his ears, echoing and heavy. Dean's cold eyes grew colder still. Cas was staring. Dean dove forward above him.
Doc Emmerson let out a long sigh. “Well, that’s a new one for me.”
“If you hadn’t done it, I would have,” he said. The old man lowered his voice to a near-whisper. “Dean was trapped in that dream. I felt it, same as you: The demon magic. It mighta killed him if you didn’t wake him up. You did well.”
“No,” Sam hushed, even as he fumbled a sideways step and reached out a hand for balance. “No, just tired.”
The demoness tilted her head and tugged on Cas’s tie, and Dean shouted at the top of his aching lungs.
“Why doesn’t that surprise me?” asked the Doc. Cas realized it was a sarcastic question so continued with the story.
The high-pitched voice burst into a raspy laugh. “What in the hell did you just say about the mother of God?”
If he’d known who to pray to, he would have prayed. Instead, he whispered a frail, “Oh, no,” to himself.
"Are you okay?" Cas asked. There were more pressing issues to discuss, the demoness being high on the list, but Cas was weak and found that fighting his sentimental human side was exhausting.
If only Castiel had never lost his powers! If only he’d been stronger or more prepared before facing down the demoness. This was his fault. He was more than useless. He had caused this. He couldn’t fix Dean. Couldn’t even help.
Jamie sounded worried. “What are you—?”
“Hey,” he called out. “I have some questions for you.”
Cas huddled against the wall in pain and torment, slowly dying of his wounds and thirst, yet he didn’t put up any resistance when the fake Dean told him not to look at him. When he swore at him. When he ordered the angel to take his clothes off and said he couldn’t drink water until it was done.
Cas repeated this mantra to fight the darkness that clung to the walls of his mind. It wasn’t long ago that he didn’t sleep at all. Now it was all he could do to stay conscious.
Gabriel was always one of his favorites.
The young man jerked his head away and stared at the floor, his mouth in a deep frown.
“What happened to you two?” Doc Emmerson asked.
“Give this to my brother,” said the trickster, then added a dark, “If you find him.”
Dean’s eyes slipped out of focus, and he saw past the doctor as he worked. The house wasn’t just old-fashioned, it was old. Like, really old. Like, wood-burning stove, iron kettle, no appliances in the kitchen old. No electrical outlets. Dean spun his head to the right. Zero modern furnishings. Not even retro or vintage. There were tintype photographs on the wall. No television.
“You should leave,” Cas said. The woman seemed surprised and glanced at the doctor. The white-haired man studied Castiel’s face before shifting his focus to Dean.
