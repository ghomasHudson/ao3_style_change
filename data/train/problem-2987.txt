“So,” Cas smiled as he looked down at my arms wrapped around his waist, “what are you going to do about Lisa?”
"Oh, Dean!" Cas squealed but before he could say anything else I kissed him.
“I have no idea.”
“I mean, I don’t know. You haven’t been yourself recently. Not that it’s a bad thing. You just don’t seem to be looking forward to the date.”
I decided on washing my hands, I pushed the button on top of the sink and adjusted the temperature using the motion sensor. I lifted my hands until it said 85° F and used that temperature to wash my hands. Once I was done, I simply tapped the button again and it turned off. I went to the blow dryer and decided to test my luck with it. I put the temperature near the middle and the air ¾ to as strong as it could go. I ignored all the other buttons, not wanting to complicate it all too much. I waved my hand underneath it and watched as the air came out just right . I moved my hands in and out slowly as instructed and realized that I’ve been doing it all wrong the entire time. Once I was done, I waved my hands in front of the motion detector for the door and it opened up outwards instead of inwards. This bathroom was really smart. I walked out and noticed as the door shut and the lights turned off.
Once we got to school, we hopped out of the Impala and ran off to class. We had our classes together and absolutely loved the arrangement.  We giggled as we ran across the school, racing to see who would be the fastest today. I got to my locker first and Gabe huffed once he caught up, grumbling something about it not being fair and me having long legs. I chucked and towered over him to tease him.
“ well, I don’t know about that…” Cas looked at me with a look that said ‘you’re not going to do that’.
“You loved to keep it all a little mystery for me to try and figure out,” Cas mused.
The rest of the day went very smoothly. I didn't get much more trouble. I did get some insults thrown at me but nothing physical. I was happy to see Sam and Gabe come out with grins on their faces when they pulled me into a hug.
“So…” I mocked.
Oh no. I love Hester, she is my girlfriend after all, I just… I never expected this to happen. I wanted to wait till I found the right person, the right time, the right mood. My breath hitches and I nervously make my way around her and to the counter. I could feel my hands sweating and I urged myself to pull myself together and be a man- like dad would want me to.
I woke up early and went straight to the kitchen, I wanted to make sure I could make some food for all of us before school started. I mixed the batter together and dropped circles of pancake mix onto the hot skillet. I could hear Cas waking up and wandering into the shower. I wondered what he looked like and my mind began to wander... No! He's just my friend and he doesn't see me that way anyways, plus, I have a girlfriend.
“Hey, I’m in the hospital. It’s a long story. You should come over. I’ll text you my location,” I said.
“How will  I even know who my date is?” Dean lifted his eyebrow and tilted his head in confusion. Charlie always seemed to have answers and at this point, he desperately needed them.
“And, I said hello. Told you I’m Dean Winchester and thought you would make a good friend. Mentioned that dad moved into town because we needed to run from our troubles and you never questioned me otherwise,” I smiled fondly.
“Confession, there is no project,” Castiel admitted.
Right now, I did not feel very lucky, however. Most boys would be floating because of this, ready for their deepest desires to come true. Me, I wasn’t very joyous about this whole thing. I didn’t want her to explore every inch of my body, I didn’t want her to violate me, I didn’t want that. I was alright with the cuddles and kisses and late night calls. This? This was all just far too much for me and my mind to handle.
I looked at Sam and raised my eyebrow, wondering if I was doing the right thing in inviting her over. I opened up the texts once more and type in my location along with the room number. I looked at Sam and I looked at Cas, we all had the same looks on our faces. We were ready for this day and have been ready for quite the while. Now, all that was left, was doing the action.
“If it makes you happy, we could go over and try to talk to him together once we get out,” I said.
“Hey. How are you, Meg?” I asked nervously
“Can you believe that Castiel Novak sits next to me during class now? First people ruin cars, then pizza, and now this! What’s next, are we going to elect an orange as president?! Or are we going to go from buying phones to hoarding toilet paper? Are murderous bees going to come into my home and threaten my very existence?! Are humans going to fucking form a mob and break into a goverment facility? Lord, Charlie, tell me what’s next!” Dean cried out, waving the comb at Charlie.
"You didn't have to hide that from me. You fall all the time you klutz." Dean chucked and I soon felt my face flush a deep red.
Castiel wakes up to a good old morning prank and later on Dean Winchester learns more about his dear friend.
“As am I. Cas, I thought you were… straight.”
And that's what happened. I decided to stay right where I am because for me, it's impossible to say no to Dean. I loved Dean and more than he expected. I wanted to tell him more than anything how I feel but I couldn't risk it. Even if there was only the smallest possibility that Dean would stop being friends with me and cut me out of his life, I wouldn't take it. I don't want to risk it. I love him too much to lose him. I love him more than myself.
I pulled out my phone and turned it on, allowing it to blow up with all the missed calls and texts from Lisa and school friends. I opened up Lisa’s contact and dialed her number. While it rang, I looked through the texts she had sent me.
“So, I heard your dad’s going to be gone for a few days if not a week. Said he was going to be out doing a job but that he would be back to see me. I talked to him some more and he said I could stay the night if I wanted. Of course, I said yes. Now…” she used her spare hand to make a motion as if she was showing the entire room, “we have this all to ourselves.”
I went to a nearby coffee shop and sat down at my usual spot. The waitress came over and smiled at me leaving me my usual. I came by here so much that they already knew me and what I wanted. I handed her forty dollars and smiled giving her a thumbs up when she dropped half of the change into the tips jar and the other half into the charity jar. They all knew that's what I enjoyed doing instead of receiving the money back and sometimes some were still wary of doing it. So instead of looking at me oddly and giving me back my money, they simply deducted the little money that the food and drinks cost and left the rest for the tips/charity jar.
Dean’s brother Sam had always been smart when it came to school, he advanced quickly and was able to skip a few grades, putting him in college with Dean. Dean’s definitely smart as well, however, when the boy’s father had decided to leave, it put Dean in charge of both of them, finances included. Due to the fact that he had to work to keep a roof over their heads and food on their plates, he never got as much time as he would’ve liked to put into his studies. Dean never used this as an excuse though and he sure as hell never complained, just because has to work twice as hard doesn’t mean that he can’t make it. As long as Sammy got a good life, Dean was willing to let everything else fall into place, whether or not the pieces had a hard time fitting where they had to go wasn’t up to him. Sam always looked up to his brother as well, he knew exactly how hard Dean worked everyday to make sure that they were able to thrive and Sammy knew that Dean could’ve been so much smarter had he been able to get what he worked hard to give Sam. Dean wasn’t dumb, in fact, Dean’s far from it. Sam could recall multiple occasions where he’d gone to Dean for assistance and his brother provided.
I smiled at her and removed almost all the needles and all the dangly things attached to me. I grabbed onto the IV pole for support and dragged it with me to the restroom. Before I left I got to take a quick look around the room and on my way to the bathroom I realized that the person to my right is Sammy. I smiled, observing how he had his ear plugs in and was most likely listening to a documentary. His eyes were clothes and his hair was messily surrounding his head. He took in leveled breaths and let them out peacefully. I could tell that he had some broken or fractured bones and from the looks of it his arm was broken. He seemed peaceful and that was good enough for me.
Once we finished gobbling down our food, we got into the car, picked up Sam and Gabe, and drove to school. The rest of our siblings lived together and drove each other to school. John was out at work a lot and Mary had sadly passed away. Adam stayed with the Novak's and had a very good relationship with all the siblings. As soon as we got to school, we parted ways.
When dad left, he didn’t completely leave and pack his bags. He’s just gone most of the time and didn’t have time to take care of us. He hoped that the Novak family could take us in and keep him updated while disciplining us. Things didn’t work out that way and as it turns out, Chuck didn’t agree with my dad’s way of doing things. Chuck says that whenever John has the sudden realization that he has kids hit every once in a while, he just tells him that things are going well and the kids are behaving. Dad not being here doesn’t necessarily mean the house isn’t there. We still own the house and dad is well off with money he just never bothered sending any. I guess he was just too occupied.
"I'm gonna go home! See you guys tomorrow!" I ran off before they could say anything else.
I walked over and felt the floor brush against my feet as the dripping water splattered everywhere. I smiled up at Dean nervously and pulled out a chair on the right side of the table. I sat down and looked up at Dean. I could see him staring at me but I didn't really care. I cleared my throat and his gaze left me. I could see his eyes dart around the room and I wondered what he was searching for. I looked at him confused when I saw his eyes settle on the thermostat but thankfully he didn't seem to notice.
“Have a nice day, Sammy!” Dean yelled before driving away to go park his baby. Sam waved, racing up the stairs and through the doors. Dean adjusted the necklace Sam had given him when they were younger and their father was out on a trip, leaving Dean to care for themselves once again. It was a fond memory of Dean’s, it was Christmas time and Dean had tried his best to make it seem as if their father had stopped by and dropped some presents off for Sam but the younger one knew better and gave his older brother the present that he had originally intended for his father. They spent their day talking and eating some of the food that Dean had stolen, they spoke about their dreams and where they saw themselves in future years. Dean never took the necklace off and always kept it on him, he would murder anyone that tried to take it from him because of the emotional value it held.
Lisa got up and walked out the door, leaving all five of us to look at each other wondering if that just happened.
“Television?” Meg asked.
“Winchester! Don’t go backing out on me!”
“What? I just invited you into my home all just for you to tell me there is no project?”
"Thirsty?" Dean asked.
I sighed, already knowing I would have to be the one to inform her of the recent events. “Well, Dean may have hit me on the head with a rock due to past memories and a bit of his ptsd. That then led to me being kept here for a while. I didn’t do too well and didn’t want him to come over and see me in the state I was in so I didn’t allow him over. Dean then went to his father’s house and was shocked to find the one and only John Winchester. His father left him in pretty bad shape and I assume Sam figured that from the amount of time Dean had taken something must’ve been up. Sam then drove to John’s with the impala and found Dean. Dean then got in with Sam and somehow accidentally ran him over, mistaking him for a shelf. They came to the hospital and ended up in my room and then we made up. Oh, I was with Meg and that was an awkward conversation. Dean just broke up with Lisa a few minutes ago and Gabe came around a little while before hand with Miracle and all this stuff,” I concluded.
“Well, you must be one lucky person. I’ve waited a long time for someone I thought I couldn’t have. It was all just for me to find out that perhaps if I had spoken up sooner, I could’ve made them realize the same,” he smiled up at me, “it’s not all just fun and games. There are going to be some tough calls to make, you just have to decide if they’re worth it.”
I smiled and jumped out of bed, I woke up two hours earlier than usual so that I could carry out my plan. I snuck downstairs, careful that I didn't make much noise. Once I got downstairs, I smiled fondly at the kitchen and rushed to grab all the stuff. I opened up the cabinet door under the sink and pulled out my sticky concoction. I needed to make sure I had something sticky enough to make sure everything was decently stuck to everyone. I tried not to giggle while I opened up the pantry door and brought out sugar, edible glitter, and lollipops.
“You’re adorable,” Dean said softly, a low rumble in his voice.
“Yea, anyways, the girl is making things complicated and said she would only get with Charlie if we hit things off and if you said good things about me. Something about a good judge of character and stuff associated with what kind of friends you have. I don’t know. I just know that I’m not about to get in the way of Charlie’s love life because I either screw up or refuse to go on some date. What about you?”
I made some food for Lisa and we ended up cuddling on the couch while watching some tv. There was a new episode to a good show that I like to watch with Cas - about two brothers that fight evil alongside their angel - on. I watched the new episode with Lisa and before it started I made sure to record it so that Cas and I could watch it later.
“You ready, Dean?” Cas asked, clearly worried about me.
“Alright, I’ll see you after school.”
“Together, we are like fire and gasoline,” I paused to give him another quick peck on the lips, “we don’t put each other out but instead we burn brighter together.”
“What did I do? I didn’t do anything!” Dean pouted and looked at Sammy to back him up.
I looked around at the trees and such before turning my attention back to the conversation only to find my eyes settle on Cas' arm. I looked wide-eyes at Sammy and he did the same. Before we could question Cas, he ran off. After that, Dean picked us up and we rushed over to our house. We got in and started baking and cooking making a mess out of the kitchen. I laughed when Gadreel got home and saw the mess. I ran over and pulled him into a hug thankful for him being home. Although most might not cherish him, I do.
"Rough day?" Sam poked my rib playfully.
Dean began pulling his clothes out of his closet, rummaging through his drawers as he tried to find the right shirt, the right set of pants, the right jacket. At the end of the day, he decided to go for his usual. There was no need in trying to pretend to be someone he wasn’t, he didn’t like to roll that way on dates that actually meant something to him. He turned on his classic rock playlist and got to work, hopping in the shower, doing his hair, throwing his shirt, jeans, and leather jacket on. He brushed his teeth thoroughly trying to make sure he got rid of the smell of cheap food and the remains of yesterday’s lunch. He threw on his socks and got his boots on, making sure not to forget his phone, wallet, and blade--just in case of emergencies--and ran out of the house. He unlocked Baby and got on the road, driving to go see his mystery date. He was nervous, his palms were sweating, and he was anxious. It didn’t help that Charlie’s love depended on this date, it just made him even more concerned about how the date was going to turn out. Charlie said that if we hit it off and got together then the girl would get with her and Dean couldn’t risk anything. Sure, he wasn’t liking this new idea of going on a date for the sake of his friend, but that was what he was dealing with and he wasn’t about to let Charlie down.
Dean lost his patience and picked up Castiel, grabbing his bag and sending him out the door, dropping him on the porch. He stormed inside and began to do his homework, rushing to get it all done before it was too late. He was just about done when he heard Sam sneaking in. Dean grinned to himself, rushing to get the rest done before rushing out to see him.
“Tv, same same,” Gabe waved her comment off.
"I love you"
"Sure, what's up?" Dean replied, his shoulders slumped. I could tell he was expecting the worst now and although that might've been true, I was sure that he wasn't expecting what was going to come out of my mouth.
“Dean,” I brushed my hand across his cheek and made circle motions behind his ear with my thumb, “you don’t have to worry about me. I’m okay I just want you to be okay. I just want you to get better. You matter.”
This day was harder than most. I didn’t know when the sun was gonna rise back up or when it was going to set. I didn’t know when the night was going to come. I didn’t know when it was going to finish. I didn’t know when the day would come or when the night would shine. I wanted my sun to shine bright for me. I wanted my stars back. I wanted the clouds, and the rainbows, and I wanted rain. I want all of it. But, as it turns out, not all things are as simple as made seem. Though I did find out where my heart lies and where I want all my ends to meet, it’s not that simple. People get hurt easily.
“I’m kidding,” Dean said, partially meaning it.
"What's that all about?" I looked at Balthy and Sam confused.
“Hello, Charlie,” I greeted her kindly, hoping that perhaps she wouldn’t bring it up.
"Castiel freaking Novak," Crowley sneered, "guess they job wasn't done right?"
"What?!" I hit him with a pillow wondering what had him so amused. "Don't we have school to get ready for? Are we late? Oh, please don't let me be late."
She had to open the curtain, allowing her to have a view of my arms wrapped around cats. My head on his chest. Her jaw dropped open and I turned to try to scurry off. I was immediately challenged by my broken bones, slight trouble breathing, and a heavy pain. I groaned and Cas pulled me back so I was in his arms are not dangling halfway off the bed.
Once Cas got home, he just took off his trenchcoat and went straight to his room. I never did end up to him about what happened in the bathroom that day.
Next to it, there seemed to be a cot of sorts. I’m not quite sure what its  purpose is but it seemed very professional. Between the toilet and the cot there was an adjustable wall curtain- I’m not entirely sure what it’s called. The hard and bouncy fabric was blue and the pipes that kept it all together were white. It was folded up at the moment and reminded me of a  gymnastic mat.
“Okay, maybe we could just make signs,” Gabe chuckled, “hold them up as she walks through the door.”
I shoved the credit card into the sloth of the machine and pressed the number nine. It asked me questions like what type of gas I wanted and how many gallons and all that crap. I just clicked the buttons and it printed out a receipt. I tried pulling the card out but no matter how hard I tried the damn thing wouldn’t budge. I went to Baby and popped the trunk open allowing myself to have a perfect view of her storage unit. I grabbed the key and shoved it in the slot so I could grab a knife. As paranoid as I am, I kept looking over at the machine to make sure no one was nearby to steal my - not so-  hard earned credit card.
"You could say that," Cas silently rolled his eyes and my attention span failed me.
“Hello, I’m better than ever although my mood may have just dropped. I’m good!” I smiled and she returned the favor.
"Ready for breakfast?" I asked him while throwing down the food on plates.
"I- I... Dean! I'm okay, I was playing soccer with Gabe earlier and I tripped over a rock. His foot ending up colliding with my face during the fall." I looked at Dean and felt bad for lying to him. I was surprised by how quick and easy it had become for me to lie. Dean looked at me and nodded.
“I love you too,” Cas smiled as he pulled me back down.
“I. Hate. You. All,” I groaned through the tears of laughter.
I used the other senses in me to see what I could make out of this room. I heard an unsteady heart monitor to the left of myself that was accompanied with a raspy and uneven breath. To the right I heard a decently steady heart monitor, the person seemed to be sound asleep. From the sound of it, they were pretty banged up and in pain.
"Bee," I begin, "I know you heal fast and all, but I hate seeing you in pain. It eats at me. I care about you too much to see you suffer."
Dean was beat at one of his old schools for coming out as bi and after that, his dad figured it out and sent him to a mental hospital and to get treated. He came back and said that he was straight and realized it was just a phase. After that, I tried talking to him about it but he just said that he was young and stupid and didn't know what it meant to be bisexual. His dad beat him some more and paid some schoolmates to knock some sense into him as a reminder. The principal figured out Dean was getting bullied but when he realized what for, he decided Dean didn't deserve to go to that school and kicked him out. Dean and I moved school together because I didn't want to go to a school with a homophobic teacher. Once I moved, everyone else decided to move too.
“Advice? With?” Meg looked at Cas and I, throwing us a wink, a devilish grin on her face.
I wrapped my arms around Cas and pulled him closer to me. I love him so much and I wish we could always be this way. Cas looked up at me and I loved the way his eyes twinkled in the dim light. He gave me life and suddenly, I had meaning again. I leaned down to kiss him again but before I could, Crowley burst through the doors. I didn't bother looking up but instead I rubbed Cas' back and went to go grab my jacket for him.
As I began to look around at my surroundings I realized that I was at home. Not home home with Cas. I was home, with dad, with memories, and at the moment, nothing but the floor to keep me company. I looked at the counter remembering the time with Hester.
“Charlie, don’t worry about what I’m looking forward to. All you need to know is that I am definitely going to that date.”
Above the entire room, there was a machine for people that needed help standing up and/or that would help guide you along the way and stabilize as you walked. If you were going to fall or needed a little rest, it would hold you up. The restroom seemed to be decently open and spacey. I smiled as I thought about how well planned this restroom seemed to be. There were a few other things that I had no idea what the use was for but instead of analyzing them, I did what I needed to do.
“Anyways,” I broke the silence with the question of the day, “what are we going to do about Lisa?”
"Babe! I made you cupcakes," Lisa called from the kitchen.
“Well, she walked me to my car and got in and then kissed me. Then I told her to get out and sent her out of Baby,” Dean murmured.
“Meg, I can explain,” Cas struggled to find his words.
"What the hell is going on?" I pushed.
“She should be here any minute,” Cas reminded us.
I turned to my right to face Sam and I saw his long hair brushing against his face. I always wondered what it felt like to have long hair, not that I’ve never had long hair, it’s just… Not really my thing. I flinched and the jabbing pain in my side returned.  I knew I had bruises and broken ribs and all this other stuff, just didn’t expect it to catch up with me so fast. That’s why I was still here, monitor attached to me, cast on my leg. I actually had a few casts and sprains and stuff. I had all these weird needles jabbing into my skin, attached to me as if I was some sort of lab rat. I’ve never liked hospitals, always made me feel like I was under a microscope, people looking to see what was wrong with me. It made me feel small, almost weak.
“Made out?” I pushed.
I shuffled over to my bed and opened up my curtains, no longer wanting them closed. For a moment, I let the confusion overwhelm me before I closed my eyes and did the same. When I opened them, Cas was still there. He shined bright like the stars on a dark and starry night. I knew this boy had won my heart and maybe, just maybe, he would shake the world at his feet and let me have a glimpse of his light.
"Wow. That bad." Dean sighed and I could almost hear the disappointment in his voice. I looked back up at him, ashamed of myself for letting my feelings get in the way of our friendship.
"I'm going to bed, assbutt!"
I let out of breath I did not know I was holding in. Meg sighed, closing the door and sunk back into her chair. Sam rested his back down on his pillow again.
I was shocked to see that although I did look decent, I looked slightly pale and ill. I brushed off the thought and blamed it on the light that Dean had apparently replaced earlier that day. Halfway through getting dressed, I heard a loud thud and rushed out of the restroom. Instead of finding a burglar or a fallen table, I found Lisa pushed up against a wall with Dean brushing against her. His lips neared her and they fell into a lust-filled makeout session. I shuddered and ran back into the bathroom. I closed my eyes wanting that image to get out of my head as I quickly threw the rest of my clothes on. Once I had, I rushed out of the bathroom door and made a beeline straight towards the door. I could hear Dean yelling for me but before I could make my way out of the door, I felt something slam into me.
“Hey love! How are you? Is everything alright? I’ve missed you,” Meg walked over and checked my monitors, giving me a kiss on the cheek in the process. She walked over to Sam and Dean’s monitors and did the same, well except the kiss part.
“Not what I was expecting, Mr. Winchester, but I’m impressed,” he said, walking over to the board and writing something down. “That leads to a question though, why is the good always said about these famous people but the bad is always hidden under the surface?”
“That’s not what… No… I…”
"Cas?" I heard a voice say just above a whisper.
*possibly triggering chapter*
"YOUR HIGHNESS!" I screamed back.
“Good,” Dean said.
I sat down in the waiting room, I knew the nurse would come out any minute but it was all taking so long. After I was pushed out of the room, all my mind could do was think of the worst outcomes. What if he doesn't get better? I never got a chance to make him mine. I never got a chance to tell him how much I truly cared. I always just pushed him away and refused to believe for a second that he could ever love me. Face it, no one could ever love me, I'm a good for nothing boy toy. I just wanted Cas to be happy and find someone he could truly love. Hell, maybe he would make a family and finish college or whatever. I just wanted the best for him and now it might just be the worst. Sam and Gabe came over and as much as I wanted them to be okay, I don't know how to help them. I wanted to help, I truly did but now... I'm not even sure how they can be okay if I'm not okay... Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I don't like what I see anymore... I- I'm a monster. I'm crashing down and I don't know what to do. I think I'm losing my mind and I don't know how to pull myself back up. My mind is racing but my body is slowing. My will to go on is decreasing every second I spend waiting. I know it hasn't been long but I will wait my whole life for him.
Dean POV
I stopped reading through them and listened to the ringing of the phone. It lasted about three more rings before she picked up.
“Fine,” Cas shuffled around in his bed and called for service.
“Can you believe that Dean finally realized that Cas is in love with him?” Zach laughed.
"Hell yea! We have school today! You better be awake now, Cassie!" I jolted away once I heard Gabes voice echo from the opposite side of the room as Sam.
“Cleopatra being Greek isn’t spoken about, everyone thinks she was born in Egypt!” Dean exclaimed.
“So many things are unknown to people to the point where they know enough to the point where they believe they are correct but not enough to understand why they aren’t.”
"Bingo!" Dean cried out happily as he plopped down next to me. He unfolded the blanket on the couch and spread it on us. I looked up at him and asked him if he wanted me to start the episode from the beginning, he just shook his head and said that it's only been a few minutes into the episode anyways. We sat in comfortable silence as we watched the movie. Before I knew it, I let myself drift into sleep.
His raven hair draped perfectly over his head, proofing up an inch just right. It was spiked up and messy in all the right places. Little strands of hair fell over his forehead.  I wanted to go over and tuck them back in their place, giving him small little kisses in the process. He looked as if he just woke up, which he did, or as if he just did the dirty.
Dean POV
My anxiety levels skyrocketed. Before I could turn back, the door swung open and low and behold, dad. He was standing there and behind him I could see that he’s been drinking. He grabbed me by the collar and pulled me inside.
“Thank you for walking me over to my car but it’s best I get on my way home. My girlfriend is worried sick about me,” I smiled up sweetly at her.
My voice trailed off and I sat in my thoughts. This was all my fault. Why did my heart deserve to go on and my eyes deserve to see but he wasn't able to. How come I was allowed to continue on with my life but he wasn't. Maybe, I'm the reason he can't come back. Maybe, I'm keeping him from waking up. Maybe, he's scared to wake up. Because. Of. Me.
"We already got you some clothes." Sam said as Gabe showered me in perfume.
“I’m adorable?” I snorted. I didn’t believe Dean one bit and though I trusted him more than anyone in this world, low self-esteem has always been one of my problems.
“I guess so.” Dean chuckled, reminding himself that this was Castiel he was talking to not one of his friends. He moved his gaze from Castiel to Baby and realized that he should probably start walking to the car. He got up, fixing his flannel and looked down at the stairs, groaning at the realization that he had to go down them. Dean raced down the stairs and around his car, unlocking her and popping in, Castiel following suit.
“Maybe, just maybe, we should try getting your dad to go to a rehab center or get some therapy,” Cas let out a small and hopeful smile, “maybe it could help you guys get closer. It could create a better, safer, kinder environment. You deserve that.”
I doubt Cas likes me back and that’s why I can’t tell him. He would hate me. Leave me. He would ridicule me and expose me to the world. I love Cas and I can’t risk losing him. But I just did. It’s all my fault. Today, I’m waiting for Cas. It’s a Friday and I just got out of school. Sam decided to head with Gabe to some diner for grub- I hope Adam got to go with them.
“So,” Cas repeated.
Once we finished eating, I grabbed the dishes and wished her a good day as she made her way to our room to grab her belongings. I turned on the faucet and began washing the dishes. Once I finished, I realized that I forgot to give Cas the rest of the raisin brownies I had made for him. I thought about it for a few minutes and finally decided that I would try to find Cas and drop off the brownies as an excuse to see him. I know I probably don't need an excuse but it would be nice anyways. I run back to my room and grab some clothes for the day. Grabbing the usual outfit consisting of jeans, flannel, a shirt, and leather jacket. I adjusted the samulet, a necklace Sam gave to me when we were younger for Christmas, and made my way to the door. I grabbed the keys and headed out.
"You could say that," Cas replied, subtly rolling his eyes.
“I- I no. Yes. Maybe? No. Yes! What? I don’t know. Help,” Dean stuttered.
“It’s not fair! Sammy! I wanted to beat them! We need to get together then,” Gabe whined.
Castiel POV
The phone let out a loud ring and the receptionist at the table answered it. She looked around with sympathetic looks flooding her face. She kept letting out mhmm and grunts. Once the call ended, she turned to some of the staff and spoke with them urgently. One of them stood up and began to speak.
“Dean- you know what never mind.”
“What are you going to do?”
"Wanna come join me?" Dean smiled up eagerly at me and I couldn't help the words that came out of my mouth.
"Hey! You assbutt!" I screeched.
Meg’s face flushed red before she composed herself and stood, a grin on her face. “The name is Meg, nice to meet ya,” Meg said, winking at her.
“Oh,” Sam and Cas said at the same time.
All I could do was look at him because I didn't want to inflict more pain than the pain that I was already going through. I just looked at Dean deep in his eyes hoping that he would understand that I'm thirsty. I loved his green eyes. They're so amazing... their electric green tints blended in nicely with the warm hug of a leaf green ring. The tiny veins stretching out, reaching for what they could, spread out like tiny claws searching for their way out but in such a manner that it was calming. His beautiful pupils fit subtly with the luscious green. There were some hints of brown but just enough to make your heart melt. It reminded me of a soft caramel glaze, melted ever so softly into my heart.
“Dean!” Charlie whispered harshly, waking Dean up. Startled, he looked around and up at the teacher. He sighed, thankful that he had his back turned until he realized that he was being asked a question. He turned around and looked Dean in the eye.
“Positive,” I blew him a kiss.
"Cas, are you okay?" Dean looked at me, concern flooding his eyes. "Where did all those scratches and bruises come from? Are you wearing makeup? Cas!"
“Dean?” Cas grabbed my attention.
“Dean Winchester, there’s been a delay in your visit and I’m sorry to have to say this but you’re going to have to return another day. We are doing our best right now but we’ve mixed up our schedule slightly and we are all bruised up. With our staff making room in the morgue and others are busy with cleaning. We have our doctors occupied with surgeries and assisting. There’s more but I would hate to waste your time with the details. Perhaps, you could come back at another time. I know it seems harsh but we are being very careful with this one.”
The next day went by slowly, Charlie was constantly reminding him to remember his date after today and Castiel continued to be a pain in Dean’s everloving ass. Dean watched the time tick away, it went by slower and slower every time. Charlie’s day seemed to go by quickly, apparently if this date ended well and the girl’s friend spoke nicely of Dean, Charlie would get the date. Charlie had mentioned something about it being a way to judge morals and what kind of person she was. Dean didn’t care much, Charlie seemed to be going through a hell of a lot of work to try and get this girl but what could he do?
“Yain’t gonna make me explain it are ya?” Dean whispered although it sounded more like a threat.
Dean’s POV
I pouted at Sammy, not even making a face close enough to make his puppy eyes.
"What's that!" I asked through sneezes. "It's giving me a headache!!! Why does it smell like artificial strawberries?"
“We just moved in from our old home, it wasn’t like we weren’t in the area, we just never really hung out. It’s sad to think our parents got along before we did,” I sigh.
“I know,” I glanced down, “but not everyday can be a good day and sometimes we have to remember to cherish the littlest things in this world.”
As I got closer to the door, I could hear a moan come from inside. I slowly opened the door not wanting to interrupt whatever might be going on. As I heard the stall door open, I noticed only one set of shoes inside. I looked up to see Cas, his arms were lined with scars, some new and some old. He quickly tugged his sleeves back down and his eyes scanned the room for an exit.
I walked inside to pay the clerk for the gas on number 9 but instead of a person, there was a machine. I crooked my head as I looked at the damn thing. How the hell am I supposed to use this? I reached into my pocket and grabbed a credit card. My friend had hacked it earlier on for me so I wouldn’t have to go around worrying much about money but I still prefer not to use it much. I’d rather work hard to earn my things, however, sometimes it gets hard and I have to do what I have to do to survive.
“I want to talk to you privately later today, don’t worry it's nothing bad,” Meg smiled and then left, she rushed out the room in a hurry and I glanced towards Dean. He must’ve noticed the confused look on my face but it seemed that he was just as confused. He both turned to look at Sam at the same time, he seemed just as confused as the rest of us and soon we turned into the trio-of-the-confusedos.
“Okay Dean. We will be here! Be safe,” Sammy was silent for a bit until the realization hit him, “oh! Be careful! Are you planning on moving in there?”
I dodged over to the side and watched amused when he rammed into the wall. His anger now turning to rage. I could practically see the steam coming out of his ears as his head turned to look at me. I bolted up the stairs, down the hall, and into Sammy's room.
“Yea, I was thinking about it with you and Gabe. Cas too if he’s even...”
I rested my head against the not - so - cushiony pillow.  I miss Cas. Maybe, now that I’m here, I can go visit him. I smiled to myself thinking about Cas and how much I missed him. Maybe I could finally hold him in my arms, tell him how I feel, kiss him until the end of time. I was snapped out of my thoughts when I heard the sound of the now proved couple kissing. I shifted uncomfortably in my bed wondering if that would ever be Bee and me. Oh my Jack, I miss him.
“So,” Sam said.
“Hello? Dean?” Lisa questioned.
I went over to the pan with eggs and made sure to check up on them. I turned around to find Cas standing in the kitchen.
“Shippers?”
“It was an accident! I didn’t want to hit Sammy! Dad finished up with me and I needed to get myself to our home so I could get to a first aid kit. I had some serious gashes and glass chunks in me! I was trying to get away. Went to a gas station, Sammy needed to pee and when I did a 180 to try and turn around I just so happened to hit the moose like a deer,” Dean chuckled, “I thought I hit a shelf.”
I walked into my room and gasped as I looked into the mirror. I saw all the bruises and cuts that I have accumulated and realized that Dean might've seen. Yesterday, I had been wearing makeup just in case. Once I took the shower it must've all washed off. I groaned hoping that he was too caught up in his fit of laughter to realize.
“Oh, well…” Cas scratched his neck in embarrassment, “I didn’t actually need anything. Although, we could use some advice.”
“Is the  fourth of July even the real Independence Day?”
My heart broke. It felt like it had been ripped out of my heart. Shattered into a million pieces. Salted and burned and then brought back again.
“Yea right,” I grinned at him, turning my head to place a kiss on his chin.
“What's the date?” Cas asked.
“All our troubles left in the current of the wind, letting the newfound wave of joy take over,” I added.
My lips were pressed together as I nervously chewed on my superior labial frenulum - the thin tissue sheet under the top lip that somewhat connects with the gums - and waited in the waiting room. I missed Cas already and just wanted to tell him how much I missed him. This wait was killing me. It’s been such a long time at home with Lisa and as much as I love her, she’s just a mask to cover up the sad truth, I’m in love with Cas.
“Well, some may argue that it’s July 2nd considering that was when the Second Continental Congress actually voted for the approval of a resolution of independence. Sure, July 4th was when Congress adopted the official Declaration of Independence, however, most didn’t sign that until August!”
“The girl, Eileen.”
“Golly Sammy, way to show you love me.”
“Yea, I guess.” Charlie smiled up at Dean.
"Great..." I grumbled before making my way to the kitchen.
“Alright,” he sighed, he knew how much this date meant to Charlie, specifically the girl behind it. Dean hadn’t come to know who the mystery girl was but he knew Charlie had something for her and he wasn’t about to get in the way of a possible love story. Sure, he wasn’t into all those chick flick moments but with Charlie, he just wanted to see her happy and if going on one simple date meant that she would be then so be it.
“Of course you can. Just get up and do your thing but be careful not to open any of the stitches and stuff. I’m sure you're a big boy so you can do your thing.”
With this said, the conflict evaporated and we settled down, peaceful again, We let out a breath, perhaps we could get away with not having to return the bag. Maybe, just maybe this would be our perfect little love story. I smiled, snuggling closer to Dean before turning my attention back to the television, all of us had seemed to settle down pretty nicely after Lisa had gone. Meg lifted an eyebrow, glancing at Sam and Gabe getting cozy on the hospital bed. I gave her a small grin before motioning for her to get up on Dean’s empty bed. Meg happily accepted the offer, glancing at Dean for assurance before she bounded over and settled in, Miracle jumping onto her lap. Though we all had much to discuss, for now we would let it be and rejoice in the moment.
“Alright,” Dean said, his phone buzzed and he paused to fish his phone out of his pocket. It was a message from Charlie letting him know that she wasn’t going to be going with them. “Charlie isn’t coming and Sam can find his way back.”
“You sure you want me to come?” Cas questioned.
I looked down at the food next to my bed and tried reaching for it, in the process, my grip on the bed slipped and went tumbling off my bed. I groaned as my body hit the floor and I bit my lip harder than I ever thought I could trying to hold back a scream. I could feel the sticky liquid ooze into my mouth and the sound of someone swinging open the curtains.
“We have a curtain,” Dean sassed, getting up and covering us up with the curtain. He snickered, coming back and crawling next to me. I took this opportunity to move myself so that I was resting my head on his chest. His breath was softly brushing against my hair, sending warm currents throughout my body. I closed my eyes as I took in this pleasant feeling, never wanting it to end. He rested his head on mine and closed his eyes. I could feel my body starting to fall asleep but I fought the urge, not wanting to lose the battle. Dean didn’t make anything easier as he ran his hands through my hair, whispering soft and kind things into my ear.
“Wrong side,” I yelled soft but loud enough for her to hear.
“I remember the day like the stars remember the sun,” I smiled thinking about it all.
Hester wasn’t like most of the other girls I’ve dated. She might not seem it but she’s strong and has got looks to have a boy falling head over heels for her. She was smart and flirty and kind and caring, any boy would be lucky to have her.
“Wait, Dean are you really going to call Lisa?” Sam asked.
“Oh my gosh! Are you okay? I’ll be right over. Love you, bye,” Lisa hung up.
I stopped by the area near the bridge and took a deep breath. This was the final place Cas could be and I really hope he's not here. If he isn't here he might just be at someone's house that I haven't checked or out of town for an errand. I walked through all the trees making sure to check everywhere and go inspect everything that moved. I finally arrived at the bridge where the fast water ran under and took a deep breath as I approached. I found Cas seated on a blanket by the side of the water. He had a basket next to him and I slowly approached him. As I got closer, I could see that he was crying.
“Oh… bye.”
“Hey, what are you all talking about?” Lisa faked a smile as she looked at Sam.
“Yes,” Sam and Cas said.
“Or… you could head to the principal's office and ask him for her parent's number because you have a project together that needs working on but you haven’t had the chance to get contact information from her. Then, you can just call her parents and ask them for her number because you really need to talk to her about something school related, I’m sure you could make something up.”
“Maybe you should cool it, princess,” Metatron sneered.
Lisa: Hello, why weren’t you at school today? You better not be with that friend of yours.
Castiel POV
“Welp, keep the cans in the tin. Wait, that was said wrong. Beans in a can? Worms in the can? Cat in the bag,” Metatron sighed.
“Because why?” Cas asked, using his baby voice too now. His hands were now clutching onto the blanket like his life depended on it.
DEAN POV
My extra clothes and hygiene products habits were from when I had to leave the house to get away from whatever was going on but I liked to carry them around regardless now to in case the chance to help someone else ever came across.
"Rough day?" Sammy asked Cas.
“Smell you later, Winchester,” Cas said, tripping Dean and making his way out of the room. Dean got up and threw his bag on, brushing himself off and entering the hallway.
“Oh, well then, tell Cas and Dean I’m happy for them. They deserved it. Also, Sammy, we’ve got some dinner plans to make,” Gabe hung up and left everyone to pester Sam.
"Want a fist-sandwich?"
Just then, there was a knock on the door. Meg’s eyes almost flew out of her head from the surprise.
"For?" I wondered what in the world Dean would ever have to be sorry for, stealing my heart?
I could tell his eyes were starting to water up and he was fighting back tears. I love Dean and I more than anyone else don’t want to see him hurting nor do I want him hurting at all. I brushed my finger quickly by his eye and swiped away the beginning of a tear. He looked into my eyes and leaned in closer to me, that’s when the thing I least expected to happen happened. Dean kissed me, it wasn’t hard or rough, it was soft and gentle. His hands cupped my face and his tongue rubbed against my lip, asking for access. I happily granted him access and soon his tongue was exploring every inch of my mouth. My hands moved up and into his hair as I pulled on it. Soon, Dean got up in the bed next to me and was cuddling with me. I loved this more than anything I’ve ever experienced. When we broke apart, Dean just laid next to me and I heard a familiar voice.
The rest of the day went by alright, I invited Lisa over for dinner and continued on with the rest of the day. It's none of my business what Cas is doing to m- his body anyways. We are close friends and I love Cas, I really do, but I can never admit to it. I can't show it and I sure as hell can't have anyone else figure it out. Instead, I have to prove to others that I care but just not enough to actually care.
"Sammy help!" I screamed and jumped onto him, not long after I crawled under him.
Sammy’s POV
Once it was over, I ran to a bridge near the edge of town. I went to a nearby store and bought some stuff to have a picnic. I sat down at the edge and thought about my life and what it's really worth. I picked myself off the ground and lunged off the edge. I could feel the impact against my body and I knew that I had broken a few ribs but it didn't do anything so I picked myself up and walked back to the dry shore. I grabbed the blanket frustrated and began to tie it on the tree so that I could be done with life once and for all. I got up and hung myself but the knot undid itself and I just landed hard on the floor. I screamed frustrated about how much of a failure I am, I couldn't even finish the job correctly. I laid down the blanket and placed everything back on it. I angrily thudded my fists against the ground and could feel the sharp pain from the beating, the lunge, and the failed hanging. It all felt so horrible. I was horrible.
“Dean!? You did what!?” I gasped as I looked at Dean.
Soon, the curtains of my eyes closed and I fell asleep leaving those two love birds to discuss little things the man was clearly clueless to. Just like my Cas. Not not mine- yet.
Dean started the car, heading over to his place. He smiled when he spotted his home sweet home. It sure was something and he was grateful for having it. College wasn’t always easy, especially not with a job, but he did his best to get by. He stopped the car and took the key out, getting out and locking the door. Castiel did the same and Dean shot him a look, however, he didn’t seem to notice because instead he was nodding approvingly at his place. Dean felt proud of this accomplishment.
My parents kicked me out as soon as they realized that I was gay. Most people think I'm gay anyways. No one really gave me time to explain that I was bisexual. I just told my parents that I liked boys one day and they immediately assumed. They told the school before they kicked me out of the house. The word got out from the principle to the teachers and from the teachers to the students.
"Sasquatch!" I yelled while hugging him tightly.
Sometimes, I forget what Adam’s baseball schedule is. I know Sammy is working on getting into the football team and I know it would be good for him. He’s so caught up in his studies that I am not sure how he will map out his time. They’re both smart kids and I love them so I know they’ll be fine with or without me but I really hope that they’ll be able to move in with Cas and me soon.
“Alright, you can come. Sammy is being a bit of a prick right now and just ran off with some girl, Eileen.”
“Hey! Winchester!” Dean heard a familiar masculine voice call.
“I’ll figure it out, Bee,” I smiled up at him reassuringly.
"Get some underwear on first! We have a lady in this home!" Dean squealed as I ran out of his room chasing Gabe. I stopped in my tracks as I looked right up at Lisa's amused face. I turned around and caught the underwear Sam threw at me. I ran after Gabe, throwing them on in the process. I tackled him and grabbed the perfume out of his hands as I sprayed it viscously on him. I ran back into Dean's room and threw on my clothes.
*End Flashback*
"D-Dean get out of here," Cas muttered.
“Um, the person next to me? They let out a scream but I think they were trying to cover it up with a blanket or something,” I grumbled as I fidgeted with the wiring.
Before he could answer, I looked over to Crowley signing threats at him and that answered my question. I threw a fist at Crowley and gave Cas a little kiss and my headphones with classic rock playing before I threw another fist at Crowley. I grabbed the lamp and went to throw it at his face and that's when I woke up.
"You could say that." I rolled my eyes when Gabe scanned me.
“Lisa, she goes from one guy to the next,” Cas started, “she likes motorcycle guys. She’d hit up just about any guy that walks up to her first at the bar.”
“Yes, Dean hit me on the head with a rock. To be fair, you know he’s been through moments like that and sometimes ptsd isn’t something easy to overcome. He tripped and the rock was there. I wasn’t thinking and from his position it must’ve been perceived as if I was coming at him in an aggressive manner,” I said, defending Dean although I knew Charlie understood. We had both seen firsthand what John could do to his son and it wasn’t anywhere near pretty. John had been a decent man before the tragic death of his wife, however, after that, he wasn’t the same.
"Hey Squirrel," I replied blankly.
“What?” Lisa looked at us with a disgusted face, “I guess, good for you. I’ve got to go, have a nice life.”
"Hey Cas!" I said soft enough not to wake Lisa but loud enough for him to hear.
“Well, I guess that was fast and easy,” Gabe said, “I brought movies and food, let’s watch some television.”
"Just some pranks we wanted to pull and whatever. Maybe you could help us plan some?" Abaddon chimes in.
Lisa awoke not much later, she got out of bed and joined me. She sat in the same spot as Cas and I simply stared at her wishing that it was Cas instead.
The bathroom has smooth white walls and a soft blue materialed floor. It seemed to have padding to it but also had a grip so you wouldn’t slip, like shower mats. It hadn’t been until now that I realized I was barefoot. There were three toilets: a low toilet, a changing toilet, and a high toilet. Now, I’ll tell you why I called it a changing toilet. The toilet was short but seemed to be adjustable in height.
"Sorry, but I don't swing that way, I'm gay."
With that, they ran out of my room and downstairs. Gabe and I exchanged looks while heading down the stairs after the others. We sprinted into the kitchen, grabbed some breakfast, and ran outside.
CASTIEL POV
I groaned thinking about how helplessly in love I am with Dean. I’m so lost in my love for him, I’m practically drowning. His green eyes that dazzled in the room, they were filled with love and kindness that made my legs quiver. I would never know if he felt the same way or if it was simply because of our close friendship. I love his chestnut brown hair that was so soft and messy that I could practically imagine holding onto it while I kissed his soft pink lips. His light freckles that were perfectly scattered on his face, if I could I would kiss every one of them.  His muscular tones, though a bonus Cas wouldn’t mind if he didn’t have them.  I even loved Dean’s sense of style: his denim jacket, his flannel shirts, his soft stubble that fit well with the rest, it all was too much for me. I loved the way he walked, the way he talked, the way he spoke, the way he groaned, I loved everything and anything about him from all his flaws and all his perfections.
"Wanna come join me?" I smiled up at him eagerly.
I smiled, I took in the sight of my younger brother fast asleep on the hospital bed. Watching Sam grow up, it’s been a great experience as his older brother. Always love the kid, he’s smarter than me, better person than me, always knew his morals, how to treat people with respect, how to get people to like him. Man, people practically spilled out his secrets to him. All it took was that one look, those darn puppy eyes could do it. They always do you in, making you want to tell him your deepest darkest secrets. It’s always how it worked. He always knew what he was doing, and he loved it. It hurt my darn heart to see him on that bed, I was all right with knowing that he was with me, that he was safe. I could always keep Sammy safe. I want to be able to do the same for Cas.
I grabbed an all too familiar blade. I felt the cold metal brush against my finger tips. I walked into a stall and shut the door behind me. I didn't bother to check if there was anyone else in the bathroom. I didn't care anymore. I needed this. I took in a shaky breath as I put the smooth blade up against my skin. I pushed down and sliced into my skin. I watched as the wound took some time to open up and let out the all too familiar red color. I moaned as I felt the pain remind me I was still alive. I was still in control. I had some say in the world. I could decide whether I lived or died.
I could never tell dad, I already know what he would say, “you’re not a man,” “a true man would never do that” and so much more. I fell over and burst into a fit of laughter. It’s good that I finally got rid of her. She was abusive anyways. I never told Sammy or Dad because it wouldn’t make me “manly” and I couldn’t bear that thought. I can’t let anyone in ever again.
“Alright, so about that date…” Dean began.
Once we did eat, I ran up to my room and fell asleep. I was awoken sometime at night by a scared Gabe who had had a nightmare and wanted to stay the night in my room. Of course, I said yes and allowed him to cuddle. We ended up falling asleep curled up together.
"Gabe, y-you're suffocating me," Sammy said between coughs.
“Not much, waiting for you,” Sam smiled innocently, knowing what was to come.
“What happened to your phone?” Zachariah asked.
This time, it’s my turn to try and be happy. It’s finally my turn to try and make a make. Though I won’t be like Dean who simply goes through them like a girl changes her underwear, I’ll at least be able to give it a go. Hell, I’ll finally be able to live my life. It’s going to be hard but I have to learn not to blame myself. It’s not my fault Dean doesn’t like me, it's not my fault he doesn’t love me.  I need to take my own feelings into consideration and I’ve been so lost in how others are doing that I’ve forgotten about myself. I’ve been so caught up in loving others that I forgot to love myself. Now that I think about it, I’m not the cause for all this suffering and pain, sure I may be the cause for some of it but not all of it. I need to learn to accept that and stop blaming myself for the things others do because if I continue that it will lead me down a dark and rocky path. Sometimes, no matter how hard we try, we can’t make others feel something. What matters is that we try and I tried.
So, here I am with the two people I love most, Sam, and Cas. I know other people will judge. I’m not saying that I expect it to be all fun and games. I’m not expecting it to be sunshine and rainbows. I know there’s going to be ups and downs. I know there’s going to be good times and bad times. I know there’s gonna be all this hard effort and hard work. I know there’s gonna be crying and scratching and running and crying. I want all of that and more with him now, I want to work it out with him. I want to be able to spend the good times and the bad times with him. Trust me, there will be a lot of good times.
I sat down on the couch and a sudden realization hit me. We are paying for rent at some not so crummy - but still - apartment when we could be at my dad’s. I almost forgot that place still existed.
“No! That would be cruel,” Cas objected.
“Yea, I’m just as surprised as you are. I just figured out,” Dean said.
Sam is very smart, he studies a lot, plays video games when he has the time, has plenty of A's, and I'm positive he's going to get a scholarship. He has some great friends and he's thinking about joining the football team. When he first started off at school, a kid - sort of heavy but not much taller - bullied Sammy, but once Sammy put him in his place no one has messed with him since.
“Charlie, I don’t like parties,” I said, hiding my face in shame.
“Raphael, let go!” Naomi yelled.
Cas looked at me, he was nothing but smiles and giggles. Sam cheered in the background as he ranted about Gabe and Adam being doubtful with the rest. Sam proceeded to call the Novak family along with Adam. He told them about how he always had hope and how he always knew how it was going to happen. Samandriel laughed, saying that he knew there was some serious tension and was glad he wasn’t crazy. Lucifer shouted gibberish and Uriel pouted along with Baltahzar. They all continued to freak out and more people began to interject. Gabe was very caught up on the fact that he now owed Sam forty dollars.
*TRIGGER WARNING*
“Well, what are we going to do?” I asked.
*Trigger warning*
“You’re mean!” Cas groaned before sighing, his blanket rising up and down with every breath he took.
“No, I asked,” Cas responded.
"Sorry Sammich!" I let go of Sammy.
“Do spill,” Charlie said, pulling up a reclining chair next to Dean’s bed - now occupied by Meg - and shoving some popcorn into her mouth.
“For example, the government poisoning alcohol during the prohibition resulting in many losing their lives,” Dean added.
“Hester, I-”
"Okay..." Dean's voice trailed off and he ran his hands through his hair. I ate my food even though I had lost my appetite. I know, it's horrible for me to be such a jerk. Dean is my best friend after all, I should be supportive.
Adam has a pretty good life and is in the school's baseball team. Dad used to take him to games when he was younger and he loved it. He always wanted to be able to make dad proud with the little time they spent together. Adam is a good kid and I'm lucky to have him as my brother.
I watched him stunned wondering if that meant anything. Had he just used my feelings to win? Did he know that I liked him? I felt a blush creeping onto my cheeks. I began to get up and turn the opposite way. I needed to get out of here.
“Just getting cozy,” I said, pulling the blankets over the both of us.
“What the hell? Why- I don’t want to know,” Naomi said, I could envision her shaking her head.
“Why?” Cas squealed, stretching out the y.
I glanced behind Dean and realized all the curtains were now open except the one by the door, exposing Dean and me to Sammy. I smiled up at Sammy until I realized that he had broken a few bones. I raised my eyebrows at him and looked directly at his wounds.
“Dean Winchester?”
Dean raised his eyebrow at Castiel.
“What?” I faked a gasp, “you don’t believe me?”
"Don't even ask how he managed that. I think he added some honey or something because it was sticky as hell," Balthy interjected.
Anyways, as I was saying, I’m waiting out in the waiting room to see what’s up with Cas. No one has told me anything about what’s been up with him recently and his Dad says it’s best I don’t. Today, I had a good talk with Chuck and he said that I can visit him but I have to prepare myself. I’m not even sure if that means he’s dead or alive but I’m nervous and terrified. The nurses keep looking at me with pity and lots of empathetic looks are being thrown my way. I’m not sure why but they seem sad for me; I feel almost as if they know who I am.
Dean shut off the ignition once he got there, pulling the keys out of the car and hopping out. He made sure to put a smile on his face and then he walked inside, searching for this mystery man. He looked around until he spotted a booth with bee plushie on it, the man was off to the corner, bent over as he presumably looked through his phone. Dean wiped his hands on his jeans and walked over, flashing one of his smirks and scooting into the booth. Dean picked up his menu and began looking through it, he didn’t bother checking who was sitting with him, he probably wouldn’t recognize them anyways.
"Hey, I need to talk to you," I said, snapping myself out of my thoughts and back into the real world.
They led me towards a room and so far I was winning the battle to stay awake. I could see them opening the door and up until now I hadn’t realized that my head was gushing out blood. I could feel the warmth of the sticky liquid. The doctors held my head up and began to get to work. I heard them say something about the risks that come with  putting me down without it happening naturally are too high. They grabbed needles and metal things I’ll never be able to name. They poked me and sewed me together. They used some sucky  thing that looked somewhat like what a dentist used to get rid of some of the blood. I passed out before I could continue observing what they were doing and as I did I heard one of them say it was about time.
CASTIEL POV
“Alright, I see,” Meg shot me a disappointed look.
“Weird?” I questioned, “That was more than weird, that was random. So, what did you do?”
I could hear fast paced footsteps as they approached my room and swung the curtain slightly open. The people around me had theirs up too so I couldn’t see who it was.
That was the last thing I heard before it started.
"Sammy help!" Gabe screamed as he crawled under me.
“What?” I asked, knowing exactly what I was doing.
“Just tell me what you want to say,” Dean snapped.
“Well, you should call her over and figure the rest out from there,” Sam suggested.
“GIVE ME THE PHONE! LET ME TALK TO THEM TOO!” Lucifer screamed.
“Dean, no offense, but you’re being a coward. Just call her up on the phone, ask her over, and toughen up. We are here for you,” I guestered at myself as Sam, “and we will support you and have your back. Good and bad, remember?”
After that, Dean's dad got busy and left to go travel around for his work or whatever. Dean, Adam, and Sam decided to move in with us and of course John decided that would be for the best so that Chuck could keep an eye on them. Dean decided that he couldn't live with the constant reminder that his father was trying to dictate his life and although my life was better than his, I was abused too. Not just at school but at home too, I was an easy target and most of my siblings didn't know and the rest were in on it. I decided to move with Dean and although Dean can be cold, he's just scared his past is going to catch up to him and that it will all be the same. He is scared that people will bully him for who he is or what happened to him so instead of standing up for himself, he decided that he wanted to try and fit in. There is more to the story but it is best left for another day.
"I never get in on the fun!" Anna complained. "You're lucky Gabe loves you!"
“Destiel and Sabriel,” Charlie whispered, acting as if those words were the most important words in history.
“Oh, damn. Rowena must really be a pain in the ass then. All she told me was that she had this really nice guy she wanted to set me up with and to tell her all about him once the date was over. She never told me anything about the date thing…”
“Get. Out,” Dean growled, pointing towards the door.
“All mine and Sammy’s.”
Apparently, Adam claims that he always knew it was going to happen someday because apparently he said, “Cas and Dean always seem to save each other instead of me everytime and I always end up sidelined.”  I knew he was referring to sports and how we always helped each other out while managing to forget Adam in the process. I struggled to hear every word they were saying considering Sam didn’t bother putting them on speaker. In the act of trying to listen, I almost fell off my bed and Sam in turn, turned on speaker allowing Cas and I to hear.
Dean grinned, “Good thing I love meat. I say you get a cheese burger.”
“Sam! Gabe! I’m gonna stop by Dad’s!”
“Okay, Dean.”
I woke up in a room and I’m not quite sure where I am. I can see some turquoise looking curtains surrounding me, preventing me from observing too much. There was a heart monitor attached to me as well as an IV. I could see a chair or two by the side of my bed and a table yet again filled with things I can’t or don’t know how to recall the name of. Fluids I’ve never seen before were placed strategically on the tray. I looked at the light blue hospital walls and back at the familiar floor. Have I seen a room like this before? This is all too familiar. Fuck. Too bad I can’t see with these curtains.
When I got home, I found Dean and Lisa sitting close together on the couch. I took off my trench coat and hung it. I walked to my room and gave them their privacy. I dropped my keys into my bed and opened up my books to study.
“Hey Deano!”
"Cas!" I heard Dean's familiar voice from across the apartment. "Yes, Dean?" I responded as I searched through all the boxes. We had just moved into an apartment together. We thought that since we were both going to the same high school and needed to get away from our homes, it would be financially easier to rent out an apartment together. "Gabe and Sammy are going to come over and help us unpack. Then we are going to head over to the diner." Dean's cucumber green eyes landed on my vibrant blue eyes for a second before they flew across the room. "Okay! Guess we will have to see the two bringers of destruction soon." I sighed thinking about the last time Gabe and Sam got together to prank the both of us. "Yep! I'll leave you to it and make sure to hurry your feathery-" "Dean!" "What!?" I glared at him, which somehow answered his question. I picked up my box and took it over to my room while Dean followed silently behind. We dropped my boxes off into my room before doing the same to his. We worked in comfortable silence before the doorbell rang. "I'LL GET IT!" I screamed from across the room as I ran trying to get to the door before Dean. Dean sprinted across the room and towards the door. Before I could stop myself, I tripped and flew right at him causing us to go stumbling across the room. "It's open." Dean groaned as I tried to get out of the wrapped-up mess we were. His leg was hooked around mine while he laid on my arm. I could feel my other arm stuck between our legs. His free hand was rubbing the side of his head that had collided against the wall. His other hand was stuck between us. I heard someone open the door while I allowed my head to drop onto Dean's chest. I let out an exasperated sigh once I gave up trying to get out of the knot we were in. Dean laughed as he watched me struggle. "Dean, what do you think you're doing?" Sam said with just as much of the amount of sass as Gabe has candy. "DOGPILE!" I hear Gabe scream as he and Sam come running at us. I bit down on Dean's leather jacket as I fought back a scream. I felt the pain hit me and it hit me hard. Suddenly, I heard a loud pop in my arm. I shook the pain off even though it felt like a thousand knives were going through me when I moved it. Dean must've heard the noise because he struggled and failed as he tried to push Sam and Gabe off. I smiled weakly at him before remembering I had a voice and yelling at them to get off. I quickly added for them to help Dean and me unravel ourselves. As soon as they got up, I felt some of the pain and pressure leave my arm. I let out a relieved sigh. Once they pulled Dean and me apart, Dean immediately checked my arm to make sure it was okay. "DUDE!!!" Dean said with a gasp. "You fractured my little angel's arm!" "What!?" I said confused. "GABE!!!" Sam whined. "It wasn't me you oversized moose!" Gabe replied defensively. "With all the candy you eat, you are just as bad as me!" Sam stuck his tongue out at Gabe. Gabe ran over and licked it quickly before Sam got the chance to retract it. Gabe winked at Sam's shocked face reviving lots of oohs and awws. "Well, are you going to help us unpack or not?" I said frustrated with my hungry stomach. Sam and Gabe let out groans before retreating to our rooms. Gabe went into mine and Sam went into Dean's. I could hear Sam teasing Dean before asking him what had happened before they opened the door. I laughed to myself as I thought about my clumsiness. Before long, we had finished unpacking and we were on our way to the diner. Ash, Jo, Ellen, and Bobby are all going to be there today. I smiled fondly when I thought about how kind they all are to me. Even though they are Dean's family, they treat me like family too. It must be because they've known me for so long. But like they said, family doesn't end in blood. We ordered what we normally do before a lovely brunette walked over to our table. Sam and Gabe exchanged looks as they watched her walk over like she owned the place. I looked at them confused while they just smiled and shrugged. "Hey Dean," she said with a bright smile, "you still up for tonight?" She winked at him and his cheeks turned slightly pink. "Umm..." Dean's voice trailed off as he looked at me shyly before turning his attention back at her. "Yea, seven, tonight, my place." He smiled as he wrote down our apartment number and address on a napkin. He handed it back to her with a smirk. I got up, cleared my throat, and excused myself, not wanting to hear the rest of the conversation. I walked over to the restroom and opened one of the stall doors. I sulked in and sat in deep thought on top of the closed toilet seat. I have had a crush on Dean for a while now. At first, it started off as a friendship, then we became best friends, and soon family. Those feelings then developed into more. I always pushed it away not wanting to confront the sad truth that Dean would never like me that way. I silently sobbed with my head in my hands. I sat there for about five minutes before I heard the bathroom door open up allowing someone to walk in. I whipped my eyes as I pretended to get up from finishing and flushed the toilet. I pulled out my phone and checked my eyes to make sure that it wasn't visible that I had been crying. I sighed, I have cried a lot growing up and have learned a thing or two about hiding the fact that I had been crying. I've hidden it so much I guess my body had gotten used to the fact that it needed to remain hidden. "Are you okay?" I heard Sam's voice echo throughout the bathroom. There was the smallest hint of empathy and worry in his voice. "Of course, I just needed to use the restroom." I looked down and realized that my fly was undone. Thank goodness, I thought to myself as I loudly zipped it back up. I hoped that it was loud enough for Sam to hear and use as proof that I had indeed been using the restroom. "Okay, whatever you say." I walked out of the restroom to find Sam washing his hands. I leaned over the one on his left and decided to do the same. I smiled, thankful for the silence. We exchanged a look that said more than a million words ever could. A few years ago, I had told Sam how I felt about Dean. I've always trusted him and he's confided in me as well. He said he understood and revealed the fact that he had feelings for my brother. We have been there for each other ever since always there in case one of us needed to let it out. We walked back out to find that Dean and Lisa had left to go out for a walk by the park. Gabe smiled at Sam the second he saw him and ran over to drag him back to the booth. I laughed as I watched Sam get confused with all the mixed signals he was getting. If I was him, I would be confused too. We always knew that Gabe was pansexual, it just confused us on whether or not he liked Sam too. "So, what's with Lisa?" I watched Gabe look at Sam for help. Sam just pushed Gabe and motioned for him to tell me. "Dean and Lisa have been dating for a while now, but they haven't told anyone. Dean's keeping it a secret from you. Dean didn't want to make you uncomfortable or make you feel like your friendship was going to die out." Gabe sighed, he knew how I felt about Dean too. I didn't tell him but he figured it out. Most people assumed Dean and I were dating but it was just how close our friendship was. "Yea, but don't worry, he's probably going to figure out how quick she is to move on and go onto another guy. She isn't the most faithful person, maybe when she's older she'll straighten out." Sam looked at me hopefully. I smiled at him and gave them a hug, thankful that they were always there for me. Once we were done eating, I got the check and paid for all of us. Dean was supposed to pay but he didn't leave any money. I guess he got so caught up in the presence of his girlfriend which he didn't tell me— his best friend, that's always been there for him, and showed him nothing but loyalty, love, and respect— about. We walked home once we realized that Dean also took the keys of the impala with him. I smiled weakly while Gabe and Sam tried cheering me up along the way, telling me jokes and funny stories while making a fool out of themselves. We got home and I allowed Sam and Gabe to spend the night. They stayed in my room while I grabbed some blankets and took the couch. I didn't bother changing or taking a shower and just went to bed before Dean and Lisa could get home.
His face flushed and he looked down, attempting to hide his face in his hands. He gave up and lifted the blanket up and over his head, hiding himself from me. I pouted, sad to see that his beautiful face was now covered with a blanket.
“Can you believe it? The hottest girl sits next to me. I should ask her what her name is. Ugh. Stupid Mr. Fitz, I was about to go up to her and give her my number or whatever and then he pulls me off to the side to lecture me about some stupid class assignment. I’m pretty sure he should’ve figured it out by now that I’m hacking into the system and changing my grades. Anyways, I think I’m just going to have to check the system for her parent’s information and then I can trace it back to their IP and then once I have that I can go ahead and find out where she lives. Once I have found out where she’s located I’m sure I can make up some lame excuse,” Charlie huffed, giving Dean the usual annoyed look she had when the teacher interfered with her love life or just life in general.
I let out a sigh of relief thankful that Dad was gone. I dragged myself across the floor to get close enough to the door so I could crawl out. I looked up at the sky and saw the stars shining bright. I wondered when I would be able to come out of this hell hole, have Cas in my arms, have a family, kids, a nice home, decent jobs… I adjusted my eyes just in time to see a shooting star go by. I watched it go by as I spilled all my deepest darkest desires.
Lisa: This is so annoying, you ignorant bitch.
All three of us burst out laughing and Dean had to climb into his bed so he wouldn’t roll on top of me with all his laughter. Just then, Meg strolled in. I completely forgot about Meg and suddenly my eyes widened. I looked at Sam and Dean and they both seemed to have the same expression on their face. We had all completely forgotten about Meg.
“Hi Dean.”
“Hey guys!”
“Okay, so, we are making a break-up plan?” Meg laughed.
*flashback*
“Why! You couldn't have waited a week or two!? Now I owe Gabe twenty dollars!” Sam shouted.
I turned around rather quickly and tried to hide my grin. Maybe Dean wanted to hang out or spend some more time with me. Maybe Dean finally broke it off with Lisa, maybe Dean liked me back, maybe Dean had a surprise or something important to tell me. I knew it was silly but I still have hope.
I looked into his eyes, they gleamed with admiration, with love, with compassion. He followed every word I said and every move I made. His eyes scanning the beat of my lips as they moved. His hands tapping along to the beat of the nervous shake in my leg. His gaze would flicker to my hands before shooting me a stern look. I’ve always had a bad anxious habit of peeling on my skin. Cas knew that and always did his best to remind me that it’s all alright and I need not worry. He reminds me to halt, breath, think, and pause my actions. It was one of the various things I loved about him.
The sink was white and medium sized. There were handles and each side for hot and cold and a button on the top that said start/stop to get the water going. It was motion activated as well but I guess some people don’t want to put up with it assuming that you’re done. There was also a motion pad for the temperature where you simply move your hand up and down directly in front of it to adjust the temperature. The higher you went, the warmer it would go and vise versa. There was a stool underneath it in case anyone needed a boost to reach. On either side of it there was a way to dry your hands. To the left of the sink, there was a hand dryer and it had levels on the side that determined how hard/cold you wanted the air to come out. The dispenser also had motion activated adjustments and other buttons I wouldn’t want to complicate my life with. To the right, there was a paper towel dispenser. The paper towels were purple and I was worried that perhaps they would dye my hands purple. Above the sink, there’s a soap dispenser that’s motion activated, however, if you decided you didn’t want to wait for it to catch onto your motion there was a button to press for it to simply squirt out.
“Oh. Oh! This is going to be fun to watch,” Gabe plopped on my bed and shoved a sucker in his mouth.
“I’m alright, Dean,” I sighed as he set me back down on the bed and looked up at him in wonder.
Dean shoved Naomi out the door and I could hear Lisa struggling to stifle her laughter. Dean gave her a look that showed disappointment with a mix of anger and confusion. Once Lisa had realized that Dean had noticed her, she pretended to look at her phone and that something funny was on the screen. Dean shot me an apologetic look before giving Lisa a kiss goodnight and offering to walk her to her car. Lisa, of course, accepted and stole another kiss from Dean before they made their way out the door.
“Not much?”
Lisa; You’re so annoying sometimes.
I walked out of the bathroom and ran down the hall. I stopped by the corner and turned around just in time to see Cas walk out and walk down the hall. I walked to class which ironically enough, Cas and I both had most of together.
And those were the last words I heard for a very long time.
“Mhmmm,” Meg said through her teeth, “all good things.”
“Alright, get some food and then hit the hay after you’re done with homework.”
I rolled my eyes once she was gone and wondered what in the world I was thinking. I have Ca- I mean Lisa to worry about.
"That's rich coming from you," Gabe responded. Gabe reached out and grabbed Luc's arm.
“It's November fifth,”  Sam interjected casually, “the day Dean and Cas finally happened.”
“Well, we haven’t exactly been on the best terms for a while and I really wanted to fix that. I know I’ve been a jerk lately. I’m sorry about everything. I just want to fix things.” Castiel lowered his head, his nervous habits were suddenly beginning to make themselves present as Castiel waited for an answer.
He looked into my eyes and I could see how sorry he was, as if it was his fault. I wanted to kiss him. I wanted to hug him again. I wanted to tell him everything was going to be okay, that he would be okay. Instead, very different words came out of my mouth.
"It's just Lisa," Dean stated before turning off the ringer on his phone.
“Do you remember the day we first met?” Cas asked me, breaking me out of my thoughts.
Suddenly, I had hoped about talking to Lisa. Meg was very calm and took it well. I knew she was going to go a long way in our lives and be a great friend at that moment.
“It was nice, not much.”
“Guys…” Meg said, grabbing our attention, “I wouldn’t want to kill the mood or anything but the lady left her purse here.”
“You scared the living grace out of me!” Cas yelled.
Later on around dinner, Dean had made a delicious pie and some burgers. Cheeseburgers are my favorite and he knew that so he had made some just for me. We sat down at the table with the lights off and some candles lit so that the electric bill won't be too high. I smiled as I bit down into the delicious burger. Dean looked at me with a look I couldn't quite identify. I smiled up at him as I devoured the delicious burger. I wonder if Dean tastes better.
I could hear some leaves rustling but I brushed it off and assumed that it was just the animals running through the trees. I sat down on the blanket by the side of the water. I burst out crying wondering why I was such a disappointment that I couldn't even keep my best friend from successfully finishing myself off. I was about to pick up a PB&J sandwich when I heard a voice.
“Hey, Clarence! How’s my favorite patient doing?”
“Just getting cozy?” Lisa made a disgusted face.
“Well, Charlie wants to get with this girl--”
Once we stopped in front of school, we ran out of the car and to class. The day went by like any other and I had plenty of kids screaming at me. Their bright blue, green, pink, red, and yellow faces were making it impossible for me to take them seriously. Some kids got stuck to their chairs and others found fake cockroaches in their bags. The day was wonderful and I laughed more and more while people fell into my traps. Luc and Balthy teased me for bringing 8 bars of chocolate and other candy but I didn't care much because they had no idea what they're missing out on.
“Exactly!”
When Dean was younger, he spent more time with his dad and Sammy. His dad struggled with the sad truth that Dean's mother had passed away and took his anger and sadness out on Dean. He drank till he couldn't walk and beat Dean senseless . Dean never liked to admit it and always thought of his Dad in a good way but deep down inside he knew the sad truth. When Dean tried opening up to people they never believed him and thought he was searching for attention. Although John might be an abusive drunk, he was always kind near others. He was an amazing manipulator and knew exactly how to turn people against each other, including his son.
"I'm gonna go home! See you guys tomorrow!" Cas ran off before Gabe and I got the chance to question him.
"Sure," he chuckled as he made his way over.
I stopped in front of the house. It was big and painted while. It was kept clean and the lawn was starting to decay but it was still the bright green I knew it to be. I walked up to the steps and pulled out one of my copies of the keys to the house. Sam and I both got two copies once dad left and we had some backups made and others hidden in case too. I went to put the key in but that’s when I realized it, dad’s car.
I woke up early the next morning and did the usual, I walked into the bathroom, turned on the water, grabbed a towel and some clothes, and hopped in. I sighed once I felt the ice-cold water hit my bare back, the feeling although stung a bit, felt good. I grabbed the shampoo and worked it into my hair, letting it foam up before I rinsed it off and began to work my way through my hair with the conditioner. I almost considered skipping the body wash, but once I got a whiff of my underarms, I decided against that idea. I slathered it on my body and rinsed it off, allowing the conditioner some time to do its job. Once I finished, I brushed my hands through my hair a few times before deciding to rinse off. I hopped out of the shower and momentarily forgot where I had placed my towel. My body trembled vigorously thanks to the freezing cold air conditioning that was now, for some reason, on. Once I found my towel behind the small and empty trash can in the restroom, I wrapped myself in it, thankful for the warmth it provided. I started getting dressed and looked at myself in the mirror as I did so.
"Assbutt?" Dean asked, amused as I blushed.
I ate the brownies thankful for them and the effort that Dean must've put in to making them. They were just how I liked them and I enjoyed feeling the warm goo pour into my mouth with the delightful mix of chewy raisins. It was neither too gooey nor too soild or chewy. Once I finished up, I grabbed my things and ran out the door eager to get away from Dean. I loved spending time with him but I really didn't need a reminder of how much I missed him or what a great person he truly was when he wasn't hiding behind the mask.
Soon, Meg walked into the room. Oh. My. Cas. I looked at Cas and could immediately tell he hadn’t thought that through. We had both been so caught up thinking about stealing me from Lisa, that we forgot about stealing Cas from Meg.
I ran around town trying to find Cas but I couldn't. I ran and I ran and I ran looking everywhere. My fears began growing and before I knew it I was panicking. What if something happens or what if something already did happen. I've been so caught up in myself and all my self-loathing and pity that I forgot about Cas. All the problems he has- all the things he faces, what if he's tired? What if he finally gave up and can't keep going. What if I broke him enough. I never got to tell him. What if I never get to tell him. My panic begins to sky rocket and I'm running around like a lunatic going in and out of every shop, every alley, every street, every park, everywhere.
“Yea, that would be great.” Dean smiled, he was growing fond of the Novak.
“What are you doing with him?” Lisa sneered, motioning towards Cas.
“Because,” I gave him puppy eyes even though his face was covered up, still using my baby voice.
He walked over and his bare feet smacked against the floor as water spattered out around him. He smiled nervously as he approached and pulled out his chair. He sat down and I continued staring at him, a little too obviously. Cas cleared his throat and I quickly retreated my gaze. I wonder if Cas is cold...  My eyes skim over the room trying to find the thermostat. It was at a decent temperature but I still couldn't help but worry.
“Well, what’s life without a little bit of mystery?” I asked him in turn.
I ran down the green field squealing when I saw Gabe get closer. I almost got to the finish line when I saw him trip and fall. He looked like he was going to cry and I ran over. I bent down to make sure he was okay but the second my knees hit the floor he jumped up and placed his lips on mine. He then laughed and ran to the finish line.
DEAN P.O.V.
“Also, don’t forget that blind date you’re going on tomorrow, you wouldn’t want to forget that. We get off at twelve thirty tomorrow, don’t forget that because the second you get out of class you need to make a run to your home, into the closet--which I’m sure you’ve made yourself very familiar with--and pick out a decent outfit. You need to look nice, remember your manners, offer to pay before being asked to pay!” Charlie looked at Dean with a look that let him know she had much more to say, he didn’t bother questioning her though.
“No, Dean! Shrugging it off isn’t right,” Cas said.
I looked at Cas and I could tell he seemed just as confused and tired as I did. We both looked at Sam as he happily talked to the rest of the family. I loved seeing Sam happy and now life couldn’t get any better. I have everyone I need and everyone I love right with me. It wasn’t long until Sam hung up and turned to talk to us.
Dean didn't end up making dinner for me today. He did make some for Lisa though. I don't mind. I'm not hungry much anyways. I'm sure other people deserve food more than I do. I did get to study and read some fanfic.
“Alright, what’s the project for? Some history thing. Said he wanted us to work together. I was wondering if I could drop by your house, work on it with you. If that’s alright with you, your highness.” Castiel bowed, his hair flopping down like a mop before he raised his head to look Dean in the eyes, a mischievous look in his eyes. Dean found himself admiring the ocean blue eyes, waves of lighter blue crashing in, rays of light making the hues of blue gleam. Castiel cleared his throat, snapping Dean out of his trance. Dean reminded himself not to get close to the competition, much less his enemy.
I sighed as I sat through another long day of being called a fag and other names. I was beaten in the parking lot during lunch and pelted in spit balls during class. Gabe helped me clean myself up and apply some makeup after lunch. Dean has only ever heard the names they've called me, he never knew about the abuse. It must've helped that he was barely attentive in any of my classes. People have learned to keep it hidden from Dean and so have I.
“Well, we are making a plan. Want to help?” Cas asked.
I turned a corner into an alley to get some peace and quiet and immediately regretted that. There, standing in front of me, was Crowley and his group. I tried back back away and run but before I knew it, they were on me.
Gadreel seemed exhausted but he was trying. Most of the siblings didn't like him much and looked down on him, but I could tell that he tried. Some others could tell too, they gave him a chance and learned he isn't all that bad. People just never allowed him to prove himself.
“Hey babe!”
“I don’t know… and I still don’t know who Clarence is. I don’t understand that reference.”
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked, slightly surprised considering he had originally believed Cas to be straight.
"Do too!"
“So, what’s up? You called?” Meg looked at Cas’ monitors as she talked and then soon after moved onto Sammy’s and mine.
I ran through the dark alley and chased after Sammy. I smiled when I caught up to him but the person I caught up to wasn't my Sammy. His eyes were black and his soul was dark, maybe even gone. His laughter echoed off the walls and he screamed as he sang. I slowly approached him and tried telling him that I loved him and that he should come back to me. But it was too late, Sammy jumped down and into a long ditch that looked like it would never end. I screamed and sobbed wondering why I never told him that I loved him.
“Cas. Is. What!?” Naomi yelled.
All of us went back to enjoying what was on, everyone except Charlie that was. Charlie was practically vibrating in her chair from restlessness.
It was my idea for us to stay at the Novak's and Chuck agreed. He thought it would be a good idea to ensure that someone kept an eye on the kids. He knew that I kept us on our feet and even worked under the table to get money for us, he thought it would only be fair to help me out. Sam and Adam have a solid relationship with the Novak family and seem to get along pretty well.
I woke up in the morning and did my usual morning routine. I walked out of the shower and towards my room but Dean called me before I could get there.
“No! Not that way!” Cas cried.
“Nope, think she hung up a bit ago,” someone else added.
“Dean!” Charlie squealed, skipping towards Dean. She pulled Dean into a tight hug, squeezing Dean, before letting him go. She looked him up and down and frowned, adjusting the samulet around Dean’s neck before flattening out his flannel. She chuckled at Dean’s messy hair, mumbling something about how he looked like he had sex hair. She pulled out her phone and shoved it in Dean’s face, her red hair bouncing with her every word. Dean smiled at the way her green eyes glimmered in the light as she talked to Dean like he was the older brother she never had. He smiled at her fandom shirt underneath the flannel she wore, she had picked up a fashion sense or two from the Winchester brothers.
Little did this boy know that he was my sun.
When it was time to wash my hands, I almost settled on going for the hand sanitizer that was on both doors- one on the left and one on the right. The doors automatically sensed when there was motion inside and locked as well as the lights turning on up until the door opened and closed again and they didn’t sense motion, then they would turn off. As long as the door didn’t open again from when I walked inside and the motion was sensed inside at the beginning for at least 15 seconds, the door would stay locked and the lights would stay on. In case anyone did not trust this, there were light switches and a button to lock the door. The door has a little square on the side of it that would allow the door to open with motion if it sensed enough. For example, if you waved your hand in front of it for 5 seconds, it would open up automatically. There was also a button next to it that you could press for it to open automatically as well. If you didn’t like any of these options, you could just open and close the door with the handles.
“Woah there tiger,” I smiled, “I’m pretty sure it hasn’t even been a week yet.”
I got up from the floor I had collapsed on earlier and walked towards Cas. He looked so peaceful and so adorable but he might not wake up, all because of me. Maybe it's best if I'm not here anymore.
“Mr. Winchester, what is the answer to the question?”
“Exactly,” he paused, “except, without all of that, where is the thrill? The lust to find something new and see where the road takes you. The excitement of not knowing what’s to come but knowing whatever it may be, you’ll never expect it. Where’s the deciding factor of making new decisions and figuring out who you are as a person. You can figure out who you were made to be without trial and error.”
“I just wanted to let you know that Mr. Fergus assigned us together for some assignment, said you’re one of the smartest kids, but you don’t have the balls to admit it.”
“You’re inviting me into my own place?” Dean laughed, that was funny.
“You’re right, sorry,” Dean apologized though he clearly didn’t mean it, only wanting to see Sam happy.
“Oh? All good things I hope,” Lisa shooed Gabe off my bed and took his place.
I woke up early this morning to the sound of Gabe screaming at Luc. I wondered what the fiasco was now but I couldn't bring myself to care enough to get out of bed. Before I knew it, I could hear war cries and loud footsteps storming up the stairs. Gabe threw my door open and jumped on top of me, Lucifer, Balthazar, Samandriel, and Anna threw themselves into the doggy pile. I could hear Zachariah and Raphael shouting from downstairs. Naomi was cursing words at Metatron while a loud crash was heard from downstairs. Anael, also known as Jo, was screaming at the top of her lungs.
“Yes! Exactly,” Sam smiled, thankful to have a friend.
“Nice, ready to go in?” Castiel asked.
Sometimes, it's not about the words. Sometimes, it's not about how you can express yourself with a few carefully picked remarks. It's about the choices you make, the things you change. Sometimes, it's about trying. Sometimes, it's about doing good on your word. No one deserves pain or suffering. No one deserves to feel like they do either. But changing that mentality takes time, it takes time to realize your own worth. But others can see that worth, others can see what an amazing person you are. Sometimes, others can see it and they use it to their advantage. Sometimes people use you, sometimes people play you. Sometimes they say sorry and promise it won't happen again but it does. Words aren't everything, actions are. The changes made are what matters. What matters is how you show you care not how you state you care. What matters is proving that a person matters to you not telling them. What matters is trying to help the other person and realizing when you've gone too far. If you can see that you're hurting the person you love, then it means you don't care enough to try to. If you don't take it seriously when the person tells you something, it means you aren't as close as expected. If you can't respect it when someone tells you to stop or pause for a moment, then that person, that person deserves someone who loves them. If you can't make good on your words, promises, and responsibilities, then it means that you need to fix some things. But if someone can't fix those things, that means they don't care enough to. If someone is doing all those things to you, then maybe you give them a chance. You give them a chance because everyone deserves a chance. You give them a chance because everyone wants to feel loved. You give them a chance because you love them. You don't give them a chance because you feel like you have to. You don't give them a chance because you feel like you deserve the pain. Because guess what, you don't deserve the pain. No one deserves pain. If you gave that person a chance, or two, or three, or maybe even some more, and they still haven't made good on their promises, then you should rethink your approach. If the person truly loved you, they wouldn't want to hurt you, they wouldn't want to cause you pain, they would want to change. But if that person did not change and continued to harm you, you should relook your things. If that person can't respect you and love you and treat you right then that person was never made for you. No one deserves pain and no one should think that they do either, but no one should cause others pain either. You may love that person and you may have a good connection with them, but is that connection truly as close as you thought? Does that person truly care about you as much as you do? Are you with that person because they care or because you feel it is your duty to be there? Sorry doesn't change things. You could say sorry to someone and not mean it. You could say sorry to someone and mean it but soon you've said it so much and that person has tolerated you so much that the words that were once meant to be a promise is now just a regular thing. Sorry might seem to be a strong word and it can be but it's not always accurate, people don't always make good on their words. Sometimes, it's about showing people you care, proving it to them. Sometimes it's about making sacrifices for those people because you care about them. If that person isn't willing or simply can't make that sacrifice then honey, you deserve better. You might love a person but sometimes it's not about that love. Sometimes it's about you. No one deserves pain and no one deserves to be unhappy. You should love yourself and others. If you aren't good as a person, then you take that time for yourself to make yourself a better person because darn it, you are worth it. Sometimes, you have to give people time to change themselves before you can let them in. Sometimes you have to do it for yourself and for them.
Once Cas finished he got up and collected his things for the day. He ran out of our apartment and I could hear the sound of his footsteps getting fainter as he ran down the hall. I wondered where he was off in a rush to. I didn't care much and I just continued to eat.
I looked at Dean with a shocked expression, surprised to see Meg went both ways. It wasn’t long before the mood was ruined and something went horribly wrong though because right when Meg got off the bed, Miracle bounded right off and out the door. Dean shot up faster than ever and Gabe practically pushed Sam off the bed in surprise, failing when the rails and heavy casts kept him in place. I wanted to get off the bed just as bad as them but it didn’t take long for Dean to notice how much pain that brought him. Gabe on the contrary went scrambling right off the bed and out the door to try to find Miracle. Meg walked over and helped Dean back onto the bed, wincing at his groans and noises of pain. Charlie went to check on Sam making sure he was okay and that she could eat every last piece of gay bacon off Sam’s bed. Gabe came running back in with Miracle, dropping her back on the bed and motioning for Charlie and Meg to join her. Charlie waved Gabe’s invitation off and allowed Meg to cozy up in the bed alone.
We talked and waited a bit for Cas to come out, when he did I looked over at Sammy. Cas although he looked the same, you could see it in his eyes.
I hopped in the car and waited for her to finish up guzzling down her well earned juice. Once I heard the soft click indicating that it was done, I got out and finished her up. Getting back into Baby was great and I turned the key starting her up so I could get her near Sammy and ready to go. I hit the gas as I did a 180 in order to try to get the right direction when I heard a thump. I looked into my rear view and realized that I hit something large. Perhaps a shelf or something?
I circled my finger around a bruise under Cas' lip and I could tell Cas was trying to process it all. Before he could object, I quickly grabbed some ointment and bandages from the cabinet and started cleaning him up a bit. Although the nurses were trying, Cas wasn't in the best shape and they had to act quickly. That meant they didn't have time to worry about small cuts or anything.
“A damn good one,” Charlie said even though we both knew she was just kidding us.
“Yes, that’s what he said,” Gabe rolled his eyes behind her.
"I'm awake," I mumbled as I felt someone else shake the bed.
“Oh,” Sammy laughed as he pointed to his wounds, “these? Dean hit me with the car. Always knew he was a klutz.”
“Hey Sasquatch,” Gabe winked at Sam before acknowledging us, “What’s going on?”
“Well,” Sam smiled, ready to speak, “I have a lot to say. So, get this Meg. Dean didn’t exactly realize what he felt for Cas until it was too late. He already found a girlfriend, Lisa. Lisa and him are still together, however, during this relationship, he found Cas. He tripped and fell so hard, he didn’t realize what he was doing until you rose back up and got a new view. Dean knows Lisa loves him. Dean loves her just not the same way, he loves Cas. So, Lisa may or may not be on her way right now. He needs to find a good way to break things off.”
“Oh no,” I whispered to Dean. Dean took in a long breath before groaning into my chest at the realization.
“You had just moved over here with your dad, you were young, wild, careless, and a free spirit. You weren’t afraid to be yourself and always went around speaking your mind. Back then, no one was brave enough to walk up to you but everyone wanted to be your friend. I wanted to be your friend. Before I could go over and introduce myself, you strided right on over, stuck your hand out, and-” Cas spoke, his eyes and mind going to the past.
"Hey Novak!" I heard an all too familiar voice yell from down the hall. I looked around eager for an exit only to find out that I was cornered. I looked back at my school bullies as I collapsed on the floor and let their beatings take over. I sobbed once it was done. Their kicks and insults flooded  my brain. Their punches beat me down more than usual. I crawled into the bathroom and fumbled through my pocket.
“I remember that day so vividly, you moved in right next door. You were wearing your olive green jacket, it was paired with flannel and a plain shirt, your jeans. You always wear jeans, maybe you should try sweatpants or something, I hear they’re pretty comfortable,” Cas joked.
"It's Lisa's, she agreed to let me shower you with it once you woke up." Gabe smiled innocently.
"Yes?" I could barely hear his voice through the muffled fabric that was by his mouth. Oh, don't even get me started about his mouth...
“I think…” I paused in thought before continuing, “I think that a lot of people seem to like beer, just not like my dad. Dad’s love for beer is different.”
“I’m going to stay here with Gabe tonight in Cas’ room.”
“CAS IS IN A HOLE NAMED LOVE THAT LUC DIGGED!” Gabe interjected quickly.
"I do not!"
Charlie looked at me with bug eyes. “Dean hit you on the head with a rock and ran over his brother!? John beat Dean again? Dean broke up with Lisa? You were with Meg?” Charlie asked, enraged with some of the questions and merely surprised with others.
"We got lucky enough to get the sugar so we just washed it off in the shower," Sam stated.
“That couldn’t have been put better, I’m going to head out and leave you all be. I’ll be back at lunch and Dean?” Meg turned her attention to Dean and he glanced up at her, he still had a bewildered look on his face.
I sat on Baby, he black paint shining in the light. Baby’s as gorgeous as any car could get except she was that and more. She wasn’t just a car and everyone knew that. I hopped off the hood and went home. The lights lining the street were just bright enough to help guide me to my house without tripping over a bush. I grabbed my key and opened the door to the sight of Hester by the refrigerator. She seemed jolly as ever to see me and I have no idea how she even got in here.
“Hey! We’ve got trouble in these waters,” Cas whined.
“Yes?” Dean responded.
“Okay, are we going to be in the room during? That’s going to be awkward,” Sam noted, eyeballing Gabe like a kid looks at a piece of candy.
“I’m on a date,” Cas responded calmly, lifting his eyebrow up.
“Yes?” I couldn’t recognize my own voice for a moment. It came out pained and thick with sorrow.
“She should be here any minute,” I said, mocking Cas.
"Elvis..." Dean said as he opened the door and smiled a toothy grin. I leaped back into the curtains and fell inside the bathtub. I sighed thinking about how clumsy I was while Dean laughed at me. Once he was done laughing, he helped me up and out of the curtain. I hid my face in embarrassment the entire time. He tossed me the towel and I changed into my clothes. He looked entertained while he threw off his clothes and hopped into the shower. Once I finished, I picked up my stuff and closed the door behind me leaving Dean to hum his tunes alone.
"You're not going to ask?" Dean asked, clearly disappointed.
"That's rich coming from you!" I replied, I reached my arms out and grabbed Luc.
I want Cas to know how much he means to me and I have come to a realization that Lisa isn’t for me. Lisa never was for me, I think she was more like a stepping stone, a nudge, to the right path. She showed me that home isn’t where you’re pushed to be. Home isn’t where you’re expected to be. Home is where you make it be. We aren’t just given our home, we have to work for it, we have to earn it, and we have to want it. Cas is my home. Lisa was never my home, she’s what I always thought needed to be my home, she is what I was always expected to be my home, she’s what everyone expected.
“Welp, that was weird,” Dean said breaking the silence.
“Make. Me.”
There was a small trash can with two sides to it, one said recycling and had a list of what you could throw in and another had the same except with the garbage. Above the trash can, there was a medium sized box with a lid to it labeled Hazardous along with a list of things that you had to put in there instead of the trash can. The trash can seemed to be motion activated although it did have little pedals to push on so you could open it up. The hazardous box, however, did not have a motion activated sensor. Instead, you had to do it manually, pulling down a lever on its side.
I woke up and saw that Meg was by the foot of my bed. She seemed to be sweeping the floors and making sure everything was nice and neat.
“Calm your tits, I’m kidding.” Dean tilted his head as he watched Castiel, his cheeks were bright pink and he was fumbling with the sleeve of his trench coat. Dean walked to the door of his rent-to-buy house and unlocked it, moving to hold the door open for Castiel, but then deciding against it and walking inside, slamming the door behind himself. Dean loved his home, it wasn’t fully his, yet, but in a few payments it would be. He heard the door open, grumbles following, and the noise of a bag dropping on the ground.
“Guys don’t just ‘get cozy’ it’s gross and wrong. It doesn’t matter if they are friends or not,” Lisa said.
I stood there unable to move and unable to show any sign of emotion. I didn’t know how to react or how to feel about it all and it took me a while to process. Once I finally realized what was all going on, I tried pushing her way. Instead, she took that as an invitation to put me on the counter. She quickly moved her grip from my arms to my crotch. She lifted up too far and it hurt like hell. She continued to raise her hand until there was no escape but going up.
“Nice car,” Castiel said, gently closing the door, respecting the car. Dean was grateful for the way he treated Baby kindly.
"Oh... Cas, your boyfriend I presume, isn't doing very good," she paused before continuing, "let's just say he might not wake up."
“So, what would you like to eat?” Dean asked, acting as if this was like any casual date he has gone on.
"I said, what the hell is going on?"
Once I grabbed a hunting knife, I went over and quickly flicked the blade in and out allowing the machine to loosen its grip on my card. The plastic eating machine finally let it go after a few hard tugs. I made a hmph noise on my way back to number 9 and shoved the pump into Baby. Giving her only the best for the best.
I was snapped out of my, erm... thoughts? Dean's arm reached over to the table next to me and the sudden movement had caught my attention. He seemed to be reaching for a cup but I couldn't see very well considering I didn't want to move. He lifted the cup up to my mouth and helped me drink. I could feel a very tense pain and that's how I knew I indeed had broken a few ribs. I could hear the faint and muffled noise of a phone ringing and it took me a while to realize it was Dean's. I watched him sadly as he walked over to his phone, it was most likely Lisa and that means he would have to go.
"He's the devil incarnate!" Lucifer shouted.
"Sasquatch!" Gabe shouted, "I didn't mean that! C'mon, don't be that way! I was just kidding."
“ you guys have no idea how much work it took me to get all this through!” Gabe exclaimed, panting between each word.
“Well then, I guess it’s a good thing they’re not,” Meg snapped back at her.
"Are you okay?" I could hear him slowly near me. He took a step back and suddenly tripped over a rock. I ran over to him to make sure he was okay while saying sorry and trying to explain but the words couldn't come out. Once I got over, I saw him pick up the rock and suddenly the world went black.
"Stop it! You're going to leave a mark!" Luc pushed my hand off and I rolled off the bed and out the door, leaving Luc in the room.
I was heartbroken and hurt. Was this all my fault? Was I going to go to jail? What's going to happen? Can we even afford this? I hadn't realized at first but I had started to cry and the nurse silently slipped out of the room. I looked up at Cas in desperate need of his comfort and love and attention. I hope he would forgive me, I wasn't thinking, I remembered when my dad would approach me that way and I-
Dean and I stormed to our rooms while laughing. I plopped down onto my bed and closed my eyes ready for another day in hell.
Once Cas got his lazy butt up and ready to go, we got into Baby and headed on our way to pick up Sam and Gabe. Once we stopped by the house and picked them up, we headed to school. Dad was always out at work and mom passed away in a fire earlier on, this meant Sam and Adam got to stay at the Novak's.
