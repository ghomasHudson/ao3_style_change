“That’s not at all how we met,” Watson was saying, pipe resting between thumb and forefinger. A familiar scene was before him; Watson in the chair across, a fire roaring on his right. He had been here before.
John attempted to ask what the hell he meant, but was prevented from it by his jaw dropping open and remaining that way for quite some time. Sherlock waited, once again, unexpectedly patient.
John however was not able to gather whether that had been the case, as any openness he had seen in Sherlock’s face shuttered closed when the Hudson’s alarm system began to blare through the overhead speakers. Sherlock’s antennae twitched at the first loud blast of sound, but they did not seem to feel the need to cover their ears as John did.
“Then, we’ll start talking about it,” John concluded, as Sherlock secured the bandaging. “If we want. You can say it any time you want. You can say her name over and over again if you like.”
“What happened to dinner?” John asked, joking, but also thrown for a complete loop. Once he had the lost reins on the terms of their interaction, he had lost them completely. “And why would I come back to your flat?”
“No." Sherlock slid forward, and John sputtered as one ringed hand reached into the front pocket of his shirt. He pulled out a folded piece of paper.
“Would you care to join me?” John asked, the smile returning, and spreading wide across his face. He realized John had meant it as a joke, but yet, only if Sherlock wanted it to be a joke. John was excellent at this kind of thing, testing the waters but providing himself with an escape route. Sherlock admired it despite it making him unsure what John was ever asking of him.
“The staff of the house, I presume?” he asked in response, attempting to appear unaffected in the face of John being worried for him. John becoming upset over the nature of his introduction to their new home was the last thing he wanted.
John and Sherlock exchanged another glance.  “He means Anderson,” John clarified. “He lives with one of my tenants.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said, reluctant, eyes shooting to the side. “That you’d see, and be repulsed. One thing would be too far, and that would be it. It would all be too much for the man still clinging to his normalcy to handle.”
“Something happened a year ago that altered my entire life, and I want to forget all of it. Everything before it too. The whole point of me coming here was to try to begin living all over again. And I know that’s idealistic – sometimes it comes back all the same. If you want honesty I’ll give it to you, seeing as you know everything without needing to be told anyway. At the top of the hill the other day, I had been there before. With my wife.”
Which John must have, as Sherlock’s pout changed into a crooked half-smile, before he said, “Turns out you were all three.”
Waking to find he had slept the entire night slumped over in John’s chair (with his face mashed into the upholstery) was not a joy. Having never left the room after the bizarre events of the previous day, he must have dozed off while thinking. He raised his stiff neck to blink at the light pouring across the bedroom floor, indicating it was well into morning. He wondered if the servants would notice the wet spot on the chair back where he’d drooled, and come to the easy conclusion he’d slept there. He hoped John wouldn’t be as observant, whenever he returned.
John was silent for a moment before he continued in a much softer voice. “Do whatever you want, just not here, and don’t - all I ask is that - you don’t bring him into this.”
The nothingness became too much, and months later, Sherlock had relapsed. It was morphine this time, and was much easier to obtain due to his connections at Barts. Sherlock had always prided himself on not letting himself be consumed by the chemical defect that is ‘love’. And he didn’t. He
And boy, he had never wanted to scream louder in his life. He resisted shooting Michael a side-glare and simply kept his head down.
John sputtered on his tea. “Sherlock!” he scolded. “I know that’s what he’s asking, but,” his voice fell to a whisper. “This isn’t usually something you talk about on television.”
Nev's eyes flicked back to the screen and roamed it carefully, using the mouse to scroll down his extensive list of emails. "Got one here… Subject line is, ‘Help me before it’s too late’, from John Watson." He cleared his throat.
And then Mycroft was back – this time with company. Detective Inspector Lestrade, Mycroft had introduced him as. He was giving Sherlock a case.
“I know. I just… feel like I know him so well already. I know it could all be a lie, but I don’t want to acknowledge that. I don’t wanna go down that hole.” spoke John softly, running a hand over his face in stress.
John wanted to sink into the floor and never reappear. “Okay, sir. And what would you like me to write?”
This chapter was meant to include the Yule Ball but ended up going way longer than I anticipated. Don't worry, the angst will all be over soon ;) I attempted some teenage sexy times but er... You can be the judge of that. I hope you enjoyed and please, leave a comment!
Biting his lip at the thought, John let out a quiet squeal of joy before racing off after Sherlock, short legs shuffling through the grass in an attempt to keep up.
Perhaps it was that desire to help people which led John to pursuing his medical degree. Day by day, John would study until his eyes drooped and he had no other option than to sleep. He studied with the hope that perhaps one day, he’d finally be able to heal his soulmate’s wounds. John graduated university with high marks – perhaps not as high as he would have liked, but high enough. His residency at Barts had provided him with a position in the A&E department several years later, and in spite of not having found his soulmate yet, John was happy.
Upon the deafening silence which accompanied his deductions, Sherlock coughed awkwardly. “So…” he attempted. “To answer your questions – I am in fact clean.”
“And then there were you two. You’re both an open book. An expression of distrust was already in place before the door even opened – one might go so far as to even call it fear. And while you were both intrigued, Nev, you hesitated on the stairs as though you suspected something illicit might be up here. Why would you think that if we had never met before? You had no reason to distrust me… unless, of course… you spoke to someone recently who had that impression. Well then, who do I know who seems to perceive me a junkie? Plenty, I suppose, but your reaction implied it was someone who had seen my flat in particular… That narrowed it down to only a few candidates and I’m certain you didn’t ring my brother. My old landlord, then. Snarky bastard never did understand science.”
One year turned into two, and while John could have sworn he felt occasional bouts of pain, they weren’t obvious enough to be attributed to his soulmate. Slowly but certainly, he was falling into a depression so deep, John was uncertain he’d ever be able to rise above it again.
John sat on his bed – if it could even be called that – and stared at the bare wall opposite. Nights had never been so long. Breathing deeply through his nose, he willed the tears not to fall. Discharged from the military, John should have been happy. He was no longer surrounded by the death and injury of his friends. No longer on guard 24/7. No longer bleeding out on the battlefield. But even though he was safe, he wasn’t happy.
"Hey, I heard the greasy git's got an apprentice this year." one housemate, Michael recounted excitedly during the Opening Feast.
“My suspicions were only confirmed when we sat down. Max, you’re not the trusting type – that much is easy to tell. But while it is usual for you to be startled by the skull and the experiments lying around, your gaze keeps flickering back to my kitchen. Yes, I’ve got quite a few beakers bubbling, but I can assure you that they are a simple concoction used to determine how quickly different soil types soften in wet conditions. A man’s alibi depends upon it.” He explained, as though it were obvious.
Nev moved to sit by their hotel room desk and opened his laptop, Max moving behind to video the screen. The camera crew stood at a distance, capturing their interactions. “We have his picture,” began Nev, “so let’s start with putting that in the search.”
John had never wanted so badly to hex another human being. But rather, he turned a shoulder and walked away, spotting Molly Hooper amongst the girls.
“We’ve been trying to talk to you for ages, John. We never get a chance, mate.” interrupted James, seeing where this was going. “Yes, we’re sorry for interrupting you like this – it’s rude – but when else can we ask you?”
Moments passed. Carefully, Sherlock’s foot slid forward to nudge against John’s. They continued to stare.
John, with a shaking hand, clicked on the link Nev gestured to, and began to read. “Yeah.” He murmured. “This sounds like William, alright. But why would he lie about his name?”
Cameras completely forgotten, John smiled again. Mrs Hudson, unbeknownst to him, had disappeared entirely during their spectacle. Sherlock risked a glance over John's shoulder, before he began to speak once more.
Every conversation in the Great Hall during breakfast was inherently the same, and by the time first period rolled around, John already possessed a throbbing headache. Apparently the new apprentice – Sherlock – was a squib. John didn’t know how he felt about that. He hadn’t met any other squibs before, and he didn’t really harbour any prejudices regarding the matter. If his classmate’s reactions were anything to be going off though, Sherlock was now equivalent to the dirt on the bottom of their shoes.
Molly sighed. “It’s just so stupid. All because you made friends with Sherlock. I mean, yeah you guys are quite close, and sure, Sherlock is quite feminine, but that doesn’t automatically mean you’re gay. I mean, I know plenty of --”
Sherlock was a sociopath – a high functioning one. He had mentioned this multiple times, insisted it, even. He didn’t care for people. He didn’t have friends. And he certainly didn’t have a soulmate. But yet…
Sherlock Holmes was brilliant. The most brilliant man John had ever met. Certainly, he was an obnoxious asshole – there was no doubt about that. But something about him piqued John’s interest. The danger, the excitement, the
“Right, boys. That display we all saw earlier was utterly horrendous. John – this is the second time you’ve been in my office within the last month. Does anybody care to explain first? Xavier?”
“Ha ha.” John laughed sarcastically. “No need to be a smart ass. I’m just wondering what soulmates have to do with anything.”
Nev and Max guffawed loudly on their end of the screen. It seemed that things were going smoothly for John and Sherlock, and for days following, Nev couldn’t keep the smile off his face.
The two sat in thought. “I think contacting the old landlord is the best decision. William doesn’t seem the type of person to answer our questions as soon as we ring. And I don’t want to risk him getting suspicious of us.” Max spoke finally.
No reply came and Lestrade continued to the kitchen, calling again. He paused and listened and frowned at the unnerving silence. Impatience brimming, Lestrade turned the corner and moved to yell one more time, but stilled immediately at the sight before him. Sherlock was lying on the floor, body shaking as his hands gripped at his arms like a vice. His nails left half-moon dents in the skin, and Lestrade could vaguely make out the dried tear tracks which stained Sherlock’s cheeks.
With their teeth now sparkling clean and their mouths tasting of mint, John and Sherlock didn’t hesitate in pulling each other forward and engaging in their first sober kiss. Their lips pressed together softly with a newfound shyness and John’s hand lifted slowly to caress Sherlock’s cheek. It was slow and delicate, almost careful, but nonetheless left John with goosebumps prickling his skin and his knees weak. Sherlock’s hands came to rest on the small of John’s back, thumbs tracing small circles in reassurance. John wanted to stay there forever, kissing Sherlock, and never let go.
The kettle finished boiling and John poured his tea. He exited the kitchen with cup in hand and came to sit in his armchair. John took a sip and looked into the fireplace. The flames flickered.
“So I said to him, I said, “Listen here, Snapey. John was saving my ass from these nasty pricks, so you better let him off easy.””
Sherlock was bouncing on his toes by this point. “Don’t worry about that and just trust me, John. Do as I say.”
It took him to a digital White Pages. A few moments passed as Nev studied the results. His face brightened. “Max, I’ve got contact details for… Martha Hudson.
– something more. Mycroft knew what was going on. Of course he did. He could see his young brother wasting away, yet only observed with furrowed brows.
, you should have told me sooner. But I was an idiot too, and I should have been more open with you. What’s done is done, now.”
John could feel anger thrumming in his veins. Pushing the others back, John slid off his bed and stood before them, glaring menacingly. “First of all, all of
“But, John—Oh.” It seemed as though Sherlock had stumbled upon their skype call, his curly head poking into the frame. “Hello, again.” He greeted, before simply walking off again.
Sherlock picked himself up from the floor and shook his head, meeting the man’s gaze. Both their eyes sparkled with humour, and at the mere situation, Sherlock found himself laughing along. His deep baritone weaved perfectly with the other man’s soft chime.
“Nothing.” Nev sighed, pulling at his hair slightly. “This is going to be even harder than I anticipated.”
“Well...” Sherlock spoke, looking up at John with pink cheeks. “If it makes any difference, you’re my best friend, too.”
“John seems like such a genuine guy, too. I don’t want him to get hurt but… that’s kind of the premise of this show.”
Collapsing onto his bed, John let out a deep sigh of relief. After some deep thinking, the holidays had been enlightening, and well… Basically he wasn’t as straight as he had initially thought. A few months ago, that conversation wouldn’t have phased him in the slightest. But now, it was suddenly as though he didn’t fit anymore. His housemates were behind a glass wall he just couldn’t break and his voice no longer worked. He rubbed a hand over his face worriedly. He’d seen what Harry had to put up with at school and at home. He didn’t much fancy the same for himself. Retrieving his homework from his bag, John hopped onto his bed before closing the curtains around himself. He wasn’t in fact tired yet, and figured he may as well use his time wisely before the rest of the boys came up.
Unfortunately, that very same night, as John lay in his dormitory bed willing sleep to take him, this blissful contentedness was to be rudely interrupted. Abruptly, his curtains were pulled back to reveal his housemates standing on the other side, firm expressions on their faces. “What the hell?” John muttered, squinting at the intrusion of light.
John’s grip on his cane tightened instinctively. “Is that it? We’ve only just met and we’re going to go look at a flat?”
Fingers buried deep in Sherlock’s curls, and Sherlock’s hands currently braced against his shoulders, John took the liberty of deepening the kiss, hesitantly probing Sherlock’s lips with his tongue. He was rewarded with Sherlock’s enthusiastic compliance, and John squeaked in shock at the sudden sensation of their tongues intertwining.
Sherlock suspected immediately. Here was an army doctor from either Afghanistan or Iraq who looked his mid-thirties. He would have been deployed only a few years ago – which would explain the sudden bout of injuries Sherlock had felt consistently until only a few months ago. He studied the man carefully and furrowed his brows. A limp? Sherlock hadn’t recalled any leg injuries, but –
Sherlock made the effort from then on to sprint as fast as he could away from his tormentors. He ignored the upturn of his lips which accompanied his face when he did so.
John waited until Michael and James had shuffled out of the room before lifting his gaze. Cedric was still standing in the corner of the office, hands in pockets. Their eyes met and John quickly diverted his gaze. “Is he gonna leave, too?” He was aware he sounded slightly rude, but John couldn’t bring it within himself to care in that moment. There were too many emotions racing through his head and he just wanted to be left alone.
Skype rang out, awaiting the answer of John who had sought their help two months prior. It picked up after three and a half rings. John’s grinning face met them on the other side, swimming in a beige sweater and drinking a cup of tea. “Hey, Nev. Hey, Max.”
When Mike Stamford stopped him in the park, John really couldn’t think of anything worse than sitting down for a chat. His leg ached, his hand tingled, and he’d just come from another pointless therapy session. He would’ve kept walking, really, if Mike hadn’t been so persistent.
This was something Sherlock needed to get off his chest. John, despite their unlikely meeting on a chatroom, had become the most important person in his life. He was the person Sherlock thought about when excited, when disappointed, when bored. He respected John’s opinion unlike any other. He was, after all, an intelligent and level man, with an understanding of people and communication that Sherlock would never be able to grasp.
“Yeah,” came the response from the other end. “Pretty sure the freak was caught out a few times, too. Seemed to ‘ave a whole meth lab set up in the kitchen when I kicked him out.”
“What did I do to deserve someone like you?” Sherlock mumbled, leaning down to kiss John tenderly on the mouth.
John swallowed thickly and adjusted his foot against Sherlock’s. Now, their feet were completely intertwined, pressed together firmly. “Yes, you’re an unpleasant, rude, ignorant and obnoxious asshole.” he began. “But you’re also the most intelligent, brilliant and best man I’ve ever met. And I don’t think I’ve ever told you this, but,” John was having difficulty. His throat was thick and he couldn’t speak. “I owe you so much. You’ve saved me in more ways than I thought possible.”
“I’m only sixteen, John.” Sherlock defended, but John knew for a fact that he was blushing at the compliment.
Nev nodded slowly. “Right, yeah. Um, good for you, man. That’s really great. I’m sorry – shit – that was just a little shocking.”
“Ask me a few questions?” interrupted Sherlock, a smug expression on his features. “To ensure I’ve been truthful, I imagine.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock looked back, slowing suddenly at the realisation that John was lagging behind. “Just thought we’d walk around the grounds. Sorry for the rush, I hate crowds like that.”
“I’d very much like to indulge in a morning kiss without vomit-breath, if that suits you.” As John spoke, a sink appeared by the sofa, equipped with two toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste. “Boy, I love this room.”
John sighed, running a hand over his face. “I just don’t understand why you’re so worked up over this, Sherlock. What I do regarding my soulmate, quite frankly, has
And then the intruder was gone. Sherlock was left a pathetic, convulsing figure in the middle of the floor. He hacked and coughed and brushed down his clothes. It would be no good for John to see him like this. Not only had Sherlock been a selfish, reckless fool, but he’d gotten himself hurt in the process.
Sherlock immediately lifted from his position by the desk to join John on the couch, falling naturally into John’s embrace. “I’ll be bored without you.”
“One more word from your insolent mouths and this whole class will be serving detention with me for the year’s remainder.” Snape began, stalking out from the shadows and glaring down his nose at the class with contempt. With the class frozen, the professor then ordered the class to begin with their potions, subjecting them to complete silence for the lesson’s remainder.
Cedric offered a sympathetic smile. “Knew it. It’s just, uh… They talk a lot. In the Great Hall, y’know? Pretty nasty stuff, so I just figured...”
John diverted his gaze to the floor, flustered. “Well, often they might, er, pursue a romantic relationship. Become boyfriends, perhaps.”
On one of these usual days, as John was making his way down to the lake, he was intercepted by an out-of-breath Sherlock. His cheeks were red and his eyes were sparkling with an unspeakable excitement. “John!” he exclaimed. “You have to check this out!”
Nobody could believe their ears. Harry Potter, chosen as champion? Cedric had already been selected for Hogwarts, and rightfully so. The Great Hall was in absolute uproar, including the commonly calm Dumbledore, and the students watched with raised brows as the staff raced to follow Harry into a room separate from the remaining students.
Maybe it wasn’t the fact that Sherlock had a soulmate that was so surprising. Rather, it was the fact that Sherlock looked so
He was at a loss, and loss was an unfamiliar concept to Sherlock. He had no idea what to do, what to say, or what to think. All he could do was stand in the middle of the room, play his violin angrily, and hope to a higher being that John would return.
And John watched, eyes wide and laced with confusion, as Sherlock’s hand moved back, as fast as lightning, towards his own face.
“Is there any desire to pursue something deeper with Sherlock? Do you think you’ll be seeing him again?” Nev spoke this time, but it seemed that no one could hold John’s attention for long. No one but
The awkwardness between them returned, but beneath it is something deeper. Something raw. Something to be guarded.
“I’m here to pick up Rosie.” Sherlock speaks to the woman he knows to be Rosie’s teacher. It’s her role to wait with all the children until their parents come to pick them up. Today is no exception.
With that, John was following Sherlock through the rioting crowds and out of the Great Hall, bashfully ignoring the looks his housemates were casting him. Possessing much shorter legs than Sherlock, John struggled to keep up, maintaining an awkward hop-step kind of stroll. “Where are we going?”
fifteen, or he was a child genius who had graduated some years ago and had now returned to become a Potions master. John was putting his money on the latter.
“Professor Snape is making me stay behind for a few lunches this week to prepare some potions. They’re really interesting, John. Did you know Veritaserum isn’t always accurate due to how the user perceives the ‘truth’?”
Max pulled out his digital camera and the shot changed to a close up of Nev's face. The brunette chuckled and looked into the lens. "Could you imagine if William lived in the States and we had to go all the way back?"
"A bit of a dump," commented Max with a laugh as they entered, running a hand over the chipping walls. "But central London is not cheap."
Sherlock shook his head frantically, stepping forward to tap his fingers on John’s desk. “No. You’re not like that. What did he say?”
“John could be a dealer for all we know. In that case, William’s doing everything right.” quipped Nev, laughing.
The boy stepped forward, arms locked behind his back. He held himself with an air of dignity and his posh voice resonated throughout the room. “The name is Sherlock Holmes. I… look forward to any future correspondence.”
“You know…” the prefect began out of the blue. “Whatever it was they said, you could have told her. She’s probably the most understanding teacher at this school.”
James’ eyes widened and hurriedly opened his mouth to say something in Michael’s defence. But it was too late.
, he did not find the laugh enticing. Or adorable. Or even cute in the slightest sense. But it kept on grasping his focus, each time those giggles burst out and decorated the room. And if Sherlock’s lips had tilted up in the slightest smile upon hearing the laugh, he would never admit it.
Involuntarily, he felt more tears fall and broken sobs escaped his lips. It was no longer due to the physical pain.
John’s heartbeat immediately picked up, and his wand was out in a flash. “Petrificus Totalus!” he yelled, instantly causing all three perpetrators to become rigid and immobile, collapsing to the floor unceremoniously. With them out the way, John maneuvered around his desk to check on Sherlock, lifting his gaze to be met with stunned eyes.
John huffed a laugh, taking that moment in the conversation to mutter a quiet healing spell. Sherlock watched with amazement as a soft light emitted from John’s wand.
Nev snorted. “Honestly, I’m a bit scared for John. He’s seen one picture of William, which easily could have been taken from the internet, and when there are no phone calls it usually means it’s either: someone they already know, or, someone of the opposite gender.”
So he remained silent and simply continued on with his potion, shooting Sherlock concerned glances every few moments. If Mike had noticed anything, he didn’t speak up. The two finished in good time, and John proceeded to clean their workspace as Mike wrote their names on the vial and took it up for perusal.
Sherlock shrugged. “I mean, he’s a bit of a git to the Gryffindors, yeah, but… He’s helped me a lot. He’s alright once you actually have a normal conversation with him.”
Sherlock, in loss of what to do with his hands, strode to the sofa and snatched up his violin. He avoided John’s gaze and began to play. The tune was sporadic – random. An accurate representation of the situation at hand. Minutes passed and John waited patiently. Sherlock had always admired him for that quality.
During Potions, neither boy let their gaze linger too long, being careful not to stir suspicion. The only time John could hold Sherlock’s hand was in the safety of privacy, and he longed to express to the world how utterly besotted he was. But alas, limited by societal constraints, he was forced remain silent, listening to his housemates talk about their heterosexual dates and girlfriends with a bitter smile.
“Sir, please calm yourself!” Colonel Barclay yelled out, and Sherlock instinctively stood in front of John, as if that would keep them away from his husband.
As he fell back into the upholstery, he found himself lying supine. Blinking, disoriented, Sherlock recalled why Watson’s claim to disavow matrimony had rung untrue.
Before he can finish his warning, the ghost–man John had inconveniently forgotten about has swung at him. John just manages to push Sherlock out of the way, but is less successful with his own evasion. His quick movement causes the man to miss, but a knife slices across his leg regardless. John gasps in pain, causing Sherlock to cry out in alarm. While the room is dark John can still make out the knife the man has in one hand, which is coming towards him once more.
John sat back, attention shifting to the quiet murmur of the telly on the wall across the room. There was a police investigation, apparently. Multiple, and oddly similar, suicides.
“Mycroft,” the Queen greeted. John, still bowed, was only able to see the hem of her green dress as she passed. “And who is this?”
His heart was beating hard in his chest, and he wasn’t sure why, why any of it mattered. He had deduced all of this of course, it wasn’t a surprise. He just really had not needed it said aloud.
Except then, John was pulling away. The hands, that had just been holding his face so dearly, were drawing away to rest on his shoulders. Why was John stopping? Unless it was true, that he had imagined everything, everything John had said -
“You’re going to bring him up here?” he asked, feeling somewhat alarmed. He’d been so nervous for so long of Sebastian finding them out. He supposed Wilkes would really need to know now, however. He wished he didn’t, Sebastian had a way of ruining anything good.
Which was why John was still awake when he heard the creaking on the floorboards leading to the bedroom door, and was wide awake by the time Sherlock stepped inside. Closing his eyes, John pretended to be asleep, though may have given himself away regardless when he made a small sound at Sherlock climbing into bed with him.
He felt himself and Gladstone bristle. Only Harry was allowed to poke fun at the dog’s weight. And what had this man done to Gladstone, when he’d been but a puppy? How foul a person was this Magnussen?
“It’s not just here,” Moriarty said. “It’s all over - you can feel her everywhere. You do too, don't you?”
It would have been hard for John not to notice, seeing as the man didn’t appear to be wearing any clothes besides a white bedsheet.
John’s face felt warm from all the smiling. Speaking with Sherlock had been just as engaging as he might have imagined.
Even if the deduction seemed silly given the apparent disability, he knew he was right. He tried to picture Watson in Palm Beach and while he could see him looking well with a tan, he couldn’t see him happy in a place intended for vacation. Watson possessed a strength in his bearing, almost military, that spoke of steadfastness and loyalty. He had calluses on his hands from shooting a gun, likely for sport, and he imagined that Watson shot with precision and without hesitation. His face was unassuming but handsome, the lines of it speaking to years lived. Watson was not a soft, idle aristocrat – rather, he looked as though he belonged in a war zone defending his country.
That damn voice. It was as if Moriarty knew exactly what he was interrupting. And that thought was more than enough to kill the mood.
“I’m a tit,” John typed, and kept it. Maybe he could salvage some of his image if he showed a little self-awareness.
The hard, sardonic person who had cut into Wilkes that first night was nowhere to be seen in their day-to-day adventures. Watson felt like a friend, a friend he’d known all his life, but had only just met. He would almost have called him a brother, but didn’t like to. That label itched, not unlike a bandage left too long on a wound, perhaps because he was not overly fond of his own brother.
Maybe the sails had pressed her down as she had tried to escape. The bay would have been dark, how she’d ever have found her way he couldn’t imagine. The shore would have seemed very far away to anyone swimming in the water.
Moriarty telling him that story, about her cutting her hair. Her short blonde hair. Him buying a wig of that exact cut. He should have recalled that. He should have known.
He shook hands, living the torture of the formal half-hour of social niceties expected of these house calls. It was somehow impossibly worse than he had predicted. Not only because he was bored stiff (and so was John, even if the man wouldn’t admit it), but also due to his newfound fear that their guests would trigger John’s darker contemplations.
John’s face, rather than breaking into a look of dawning realization on how Sherlock had gathered intel on their suspect’s whereabouts, had softened. He looked at him differently. It was the kind of expression that Sherlock never felt deserving of, but still made him feel… good. John could look at him a certain way and his chest would heat, like drinking after he’d put the blood in the microwave first.
“Another man kept looking over the shoulder of his partner, in mid coitus.  I'm quite sure he wanted one of the people observing or filming, and not the man actually having sex with him.”
“I help the police,” Sherlock said.  “I'm a consulting detective,” he added proudly.  “The only one.”
“It was enough that it was finished.  If I have asked, all I would have gotten was a clipped declaration that it was none of my business, or that I was too young and would be told when I was older,” he observed dryly.  “I never seemed to grow old enough.”
“No,” Well, maybe later, John mentally amended.  “It's just that...” he paused, trying to think of exactly how to say this.
“Home is not the right word.  Will they want to come to a foreign country?” Mycroft's scorn was touched with bitterness.   “To be faced with  Mummy's tender regard and Father's confusion?”
“It..well, it depends.  You've heard of one-night stands?  Just sex doesn't make boyfriends, Sherlock.  There's...well, some getting to know each other first and some mutual, ah, decisions.”
The man nodded.  “Exactly.  Why me?  Why not the handsome silver-haired contender you mentioned before.”
Any more right and he'd be dead.  He managed the condom at last.  “God, I hope the neighbors didn't call the police.”
John paused in his own investigations to fight back a yelp. He forgot about it as Sherlock said, “Will you let me see your scar?”
The poor thing.  “I,” John began.  “Never mind.  Drink your tea.”  He drank his own while wandering around the flat.  When he finished his cup he turned.
Sherlock returned, dropped a cloth on his stomach that was not wrung out or particularly warm.  John's hand clutched it to him so that it would not slide off onto the sheet, and once again watched the tall lanky man with the amazing arse walk out of the room.
He was thinking of the army as he realized that never before in a sexual situation had he found himself feeling so...conquering.  The masculine essence of the act increased for him when the body under his was masculine.  Making a man make those sounds, those low, rumbling erotic sounds,  was inspirational.  Sherlock's long arms around him meant they were so very close as they rutted against each other and a tiny bit of John's mind that wasn't in thrall to the sensation was wondering if he could stop and deal with a condom, could....
“Fellatio, then?  I didn't quite do it right before.  But I could be brilliant at it,” he predicted.
“Boyfriends!”   The word ended on a squeak.  John swallowed hard and tried it again in a deeper register.  “Boyfriends?”  He'd had some relationships that developed rather quickly, but this was a bit much.  “I don't think we're quite that,” he said, as gently as he could.
John had been planning to go home.  Really, he had.  But somewhere in the middle of the second feature Sherlock decided he wanted to experiment a little more with kissing.  And really, who could turn that down?
“Always.”  Sherlock sighed.   Then he added.  “It might explain Uncle Rudy's reputation for cross-dressing.”
John whimpered and sent his tongue out.  The other man did not seem to know what to do with his own        tongue, pushing it tentatively against John's.  As clumsy and awkward as it was, the touch of tongue still lit a few more fires in John's gut.  Twisting, John slid off the bar stool, and as his arm had wound around the other, the man came forward off his own stool so that they now stood, arms wrapped around each other, still kissing.
“The easier job of the two?” John asked blandly.  He got identical looks of annoyance from both Holmes.  That made him grin.  “Keep in touch,” John ordered.  He was rather surprised when Mycroft nodded his agreement as he stood up.  Then John frowned, “Not staying for tea?
The next moment John was really aware, he found his mouth plastered to Sherlocks' shoulder.  Drooling on him, actually.  He drew back a little.
“Right.”  But there was something about this entire encounter that seemed to indicate that Sherlock was a bit innocent.  “Look, have you done this with a woman?”
“How do you know that?” John asked, leaning back in his amazement.  The annoying man didn't answer, only studied John with those oddly compelling eyes before continuing.
“Yes.  Yes, it certainly is.”  John took a deep breath.  Moving back home, all of them.  “Are you implying....”
John's arm shot out, his hand flattened against that sweaty, glorious chest and growled, very politely, “Go clean yourself off and bring me a flannel.  Please.”
Science never felt so good.  He felt something against his hip.  He pulled away to say firmly, “Condoms.”
“Perhaps it should be on a case by case basis.  Let them present a document about their connection to Wakanda.  If they are seeking justice, let them explain.  Perhaps, to become Wakandan, they must give up a disputed inheritance, a feud.  Perhaps we will ask them to renounce their current citizenship, but what happens then if it does not work out and they must go back?  Not all of these will be good people.  Do we keep good and bad? Is their presence dependent upon their behavior?”
“The problems which drove them away may still be here.  They will bring problems which were thought solved.  Some will want justice.  Or revenge. This will be more trouble than it is worth.”
Sherlock said nothing, waiting.  John took a deep, deep, breath.  “The more important a thing was, the less likely it was talked about.  He would get mad about it, and the more important to him, the more he...hit out.  I just realized...I realized I...channel him when I...When....”  He gave a sigh and said quietly, “When I hit you.  God, I should never have hit you!”
“Molly?  Oh.  Pathologist.”  Should he be giving away details about Molly?  He pressed his lips together and frowned.  But the man was nodding, as if this just confirmed what he already knew.
Apparently not.  In fact, Sherlock seemed to be enjoying his explorations.  His fingers coiled through the hairs, raked them, ruffled them and stroked them smooth again.  His large nose traced through them to John's armpit and a red tongue came out and licked him there.
“We'd bet on the time it would take a...uh, colleague,  before he would do a certain incredibly stupid thing we had all seen him do once already. I had my guess down at five minutes, Mike ten, Evan fifteen, you know, everyone had a time, and Molly had 'anything over an hour.'  And she was right.”  A nod encouraged him to go on, so he added, “Before we started, Molly wrote down on slips of paper what the penalties would be for each of us if she was right.  Buy a round, bring pastries in the morning, things like that.  The person who was most wrong had to take everyone to the nearest gay bar and kiss the best looking man there.”
“How did you turn this presentation into, “How the Medical Community Can Help Sherlock Holmes Solve Crimes?” John asked as they met in the front of the room.
“Mary.” John's hand went to the back of his head.  The small headache he had woken up with was still there,  but now it seemed a little worse.
That brought Sherlock's eye open again.  He looked carefully at his brother, and then swung himself up to a seated position, his hand rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.  “What is it now?” he asked with a tight voice.
A stifled laugh exploded past John's lips  “I did.  How did you know?”   It was damned strange, having to look up while flirting.   His glance went down automatically to check out cleavage which wasn't there, and he  admitted to himself that the whole situation was more than strange.  How did he get himself into these things?
They were at the house John had shared with Mary, while 221 was in the throes of reconstruction.  Mrs. Hudson was here as well, installed in the nursery at her insistence.  John was terribly glad for the help.  Between the three of them, they managed to function well enough to deal with the day to day effort of living, and the endless minor catastrophes involved in raising a toddler. Mrs. Hudson was currently out replenishing the larder, with Rosie's assistance.  Poor woman. No doubt her absence factored into the timing of Mycroft's arrival.
“Mycroft probably knows.  But you've never asked him,” John guessed. “Or asked your parents,” he went on.  “You would have had to have an actual discussion.”
John snorted as he waved Mycroft into the chair Sherlock had adopted as his own.  Sherlock, stretched out on the sofa at the moment, managed not to say anything else as his brother approached, but he closed closed his eye again, as if the sight was quite painful
John looked around.  Bar along one side of the room, a dozen tables in the middle, booths along the far wall.  Low lighting in the corners, where couples leaned towards each other.  Lots of ferns in pots.  Copper bowls with fancy artificial candles flickering on each table.  Two thirds of the patrons were men sitting with other men.  “What is it, then?”
“Ah.  Well.   My name is Sherlock Holmes and I am a consulting detective.  I assist the police and have a private practice.  Today I am going to speak to you about how see, how to observe, how to use what you see.  Pay attention!”  He had noticed Nurse Demnan in the last row, on his phone as usual.
“It was just lunch, not a date!”  It had been enough to tell them both that dating wouldn't have been a good idea.
“All our decisions affect Wakanda for generations to come.  But the sunset approaches, I am hungry,  and I suggest we begin this discussion again tomorrow.”  Makanta's voice was getting loud again.
“So the clientele mix here is just because of proximity, not on purpose?” John asked, leaning forward a little again.  “And some of them are here waiting until the action starts.”   Waiting here, in a place where you could actually hear a conversation, made sense.
So they'd gone to bed and John slept for hours, only waking up shortly before noon when Sherlock, who had vanished at some point, came back to the bedroom, climbed into bed and...
As the fine trousers pooled down to join his on the floor, a wash of scent went flooding into John's nose and he breathed it in, letting it go deep inside, feeling a shivery response in his gut.  Neither of them was more than half hard.  John could tell even though he was carefully not staring at the stretch of fabric over the  crotch of the other man.  He was carefully not staring but he already knew that Sherlock was bigger in that area than John.
“Yes.  Quite.  I must confess that in response, I did something...Sherlockian.”  This time it was John who snorted.  “Convinced that I did not have all the data, I...investigated.  I began  by thoroughly reading the files our parents keep in their home office.”
“Like moving in?  You should, John.  Your place is small and you don't like it anyway.  There's a room upstairs here, if you wanted a space of your own.  You'd probably need it,” he added darkly.  “I get on people's nerves.  They've told me so,” he explained.  “So you might need space.”
John frowned.  “Who is this Anderson you're muttering about?  No, tell me later.  What?  Oh, that sounds good.   Yes...how did you know that?  I can't tell you how grateful I am that you'll come.  Okay, yes, probably...when I get off work, okay?  I'll have to go to my flat, have a few errands.  No.  No!  Oh, for Chr....  Yes, see you then.”
“Not quite ready to move in, yet.  Quite.  You know.  It takes a little more time.  Big decision.  Ah....”
John decided to change the subject. “Some day you'll have to tell me about these cousins that you already know about.  That bad?”
“This plan serves several purposes," the elder representing the Border tribe stated.  As he had now said it for the third time, the statement was not moving her agenda forward.
He rang off and looked up.  “Well, we've got a consulting detective trained as a chemist coming but what he'll be telling us I couldn't say.”
“I pointed out your murderer,” he snapped.  Murderer?  John blinked.  “I provided the distraction that allowed you to catch him before he killed again.  I think I'm done here, don't you, Lestrade?”
Sherlock said, as John came back, “He has another language to learn in only three weeks and needs to give his assistant special training before he leaves her on her own.  She can handle it, Mycroft is just a nervous twat,” Sherlock said as John came back to hand around the tea, which had seeped rather longer than planned.
“Sherlock,” the man began again, but Sherlock...what sort of a name was Sherlock?...turned to him impatiently.
He wasn't alone in that.  John had questions, too.  Along the line of 'What the fuck?' and, 'What is this, anyway?' and, 'Why did we stop?'
“Which is not to say that I haven't, upon occasion, wondered what it would be like,” the man admitted, with a look from the side of his eyes.  He was pursing his lips just a little.  John found himself staring at those lips.
“Fine. To-mor-row,” Sherlock enunciated, his hand already coming out to grab John's.  “Come on, John.”
Well, yes, John thought with embarrassment.  But before he could marshal some of the scrambled  thoughts in his head to say so, Sherlock went on, “Perhaps I deleted that information.  I do that sometimes when I come across data that is absolutely no use to me.”
“This we must determine.  Right now, we discuss if it is to happen at all.” Then, present the decision to the king, who might decide for it or against it, or ask for more information, or for delays.  Starting the process all over again.
“Not a guess at all.  Dr. Hooper kicked me out of her lab once.  She must not remember.  She wasn't wearing her name tag then,”  Sherlock recalled.
“Yes.  Yes it does,” John whispered, and let his hands roam down and under the clinging fabric again.  The silk was nice, but this skin was even better.  Acres of it, covering long firm muscle.  The roughness of hair.  The edge of a hard nipple.  Sherlock didn't have as much hair on his chest as John had on his.  Would he be put off by John's?
“Yes, of course.  I like to know these things,” he added as John let his head fall down onto the pillow again.
Okay.  The guy had a great aftershave, he noticed, before he was overwhelmed by lips and kissing a man and...lips.  Not much different from kissing a woman.  Warm.  Lips.  And.  Well.  He leaned into the kiss, automatically pressing his own mouth forward, his hand coming up to brace himself on the other man's shoulder.  This encouraged a bit of movement, a nestling closer from both of them, a slight change in angle and then....
“How many generations do you intend to go back?  Who has a right to Wakandan citizenship?  What blood ties will suffice?”
Taba closed her eyes and fought back a sigh.  The meeting had been going so well, too.  She rubbed her temple and then brought her hand away, hoping none of the others had observed her annoyance.
Red.  John felt the red creep up his neck and start to burn on his cheeks.  He was extremely thankful  when Sarah came up and said, “Wonderful presentation, you two.  Where did you find that speaker?”
John's mouth opened but no words came out for several seconds.  Then he managed to say, “That was amazing!”
Taba said, “We have identified one hundred and nineteen individuals who have left because of disagreements with family, including twenty-two women and one man who left to avoid being pressured into unwanted marriage.”
“Got him, Sherlock!  Your distraction was great but...uh....”  He was now staring hard at the dark-haired man, his expression half puzzlement, half amusement.
So he reached for the lube and used it with hands that trembled.  It was torture to see that expressive face contort at every touch, push, finger.  So smooth inside.  He'd never slid a finger inside anyone when the finger wasn't in latex.  Oh, so very slick and smooth, and clutching at him.   He rather got involved with the sensation, which changed again when he eased a second finger inside.  Well, what changed were the sounds Sherlock was making.  When he thought he'd managed to make Sherlock loose and ready, he stopped to put on the condom, watched by eyes so intense, an expression so fervid that John gasped a bit as he moved into position.  Sherlock made a short sound  himself and belatedly, John grabbed the spare pillow and eased it under those slim hips.  He wasn't, he decided, doing a good job of thinking clearly.  Thinking at all, actually.
“I asked to borrow a leg.  Or an entire body  She didn't even bother to ask me what I wanted it for!” Sherlock complained.
John rolled his eyes in an ohmygodreally THAT'S what you want to talk about face, and opened his mouth to comment, but Sherlock spoke over him.
“As this is not precisely a gay bar,  she's created an interesting dynamic.”  At john's questioning glance he explained, “I've never kissed a man, myself.”
The thing was, they did.  He was riveting.  He strode back and forth, he asked questions and didn't wait for the answer.  His head would toss, his hand wave, and they focused on him.  He seldom bothered to make eye contact but when he did the person leaned forward.  It was almost steam of consciousness, a jerky pinball effect as he contradicted himself or went back to add something.
“I have been looking into the...background of the....”  Mycroft look vaguely constipated as he paused to find the right words.
John could see, standing just behind Sherlock, Cora, who was waiting to talk to either John or both of them.  Her eyes had gone wide.  And a few steps behind her stood Mary, looking at them suspiciously.
Cora and John had started work at the same time and Sarah had paired them up on the theory they might not know the community and wouldn't have as many connections yet.  There had been some grumbles, as no one else had a partner.   Having them come up with speakers on their own  was to maximize the number of subjects presented, John thought.  The Monday meeting had become something to dread.  Total waste of time he and Cora had decided after sitting through the first one.  And the second.  And the tenth.  John said, “We've got next week, yeah?”
John reflected on what Sherlock might term ghastly.  “Small minded, mocking, ignorant, bullies?” he speculated.
“It is not the time to introduce foreigners to our society!  We are not stable enough to handle the disruptions.”  Makanta's voice was too loud.  He'd been getting louder through the entire meeting.  She lifted her spear in warning, and he subsided before she could thump it on the floor to censure him.
“Yes.  Thank you, John. Even after some investigation and analysis there were some aspects the whole affair which were not explained to my satisfaction.”
“Well, good,” Johns said again.  There was a rattle at the door and he jumped up to help Mrs. Hudson in with the shopping and the toddler, and Sherlock threw himself back against the cushions, looked up at the ceiling, and smiled.
John sensed he did not have the man's full attention.  It felt strangely annoying.  He said, “Yeah, it took awhile.  There are actually quite a few good looking guys here, but finally it was between you and that handsome silver fox in the corner.”
It was a hectic morning.  Never quite caught up from the delays at the start.  So he wasn't able to meet Sherlock at the door as he had hoped.  John arrived at the conference room two minutes after eleven to find Sherlock chatting with Cora.  Twenty three of his colleague and co-workers were sat in three rows in front of a short lectern with a microphone angling up from it. When John arrived Sherlock stood taller and smiled at him before he strode up to to the lectern, casually tossed his coat on it and turned to look them over.  “Most people are idiots.  If I'm really in luck, you'll prove to be exceptions.”  John slid into his chair, face in his palm.
“The oldest child, a boy, Rudo, possibly named Rudolph for his father, grew up, attended school as long as he was able—he has had some university classes—and works for his country's Department of Transportation,” he paused for Sherlock to laugh himself sick and then went on as if not interrupted. “and his sister, who is probably called Denka, is a widow working in an office. She has one child, a girl.   None of them are using any of our family names as a surname.  As I said, we must wait for more information.”
“You've got a patient waiting.  But I  need to talk to you first.”   She leaned forward and said in a near whisper, “Do you remember when they assigned everyone a day to provide a Community Connections speaker?”
“For my mistakes.  For causing you to...mourn.  For...”  But Sherlock could not go on and sat, staring at the rug under his shoes.
“Oh.  I work at a clinic, actually, not Bart's like the rest of the group.  Mike's an old friend.  We'd plans to go out for a drink after his shift, and it just,” got out of hand, he wanted to say.  Snowballed into this group activity.  He still wasn't exactly sure how, in fact.
There was a case, alright.  A head case.  Sherlock to be specific.  Which didn't explain why he was throwing on clothing himself.  They were out the door shortly after midnight.   Sherlock put one hand up and summoned a cab out of the darkness.
The man nodded.  “Molly wished you to go to a gay bar, and kiss the man she selected as most attractive.  She wanted to see you kiss a man then.  Your Molly has hidden depths.”
“Right.  None of that matters.  What matters is that it's just gone nine and at eleven we need to produce someone who can talk 45 minutes about anything at all that could be considered Community Connections!  What?”
“We have survived a terrible battle in which both sides were our own people.  A third of our warriors did not get treatment fast enough to avoid disability, and too many died.  We will have to train up an new generation.”
Sherlock's legs spread, he tilted his pelvis into just the right position and John gasped again and fumbled them together, then sank in to wonderland.
“You liked kissing me,” Sherlock reminded him.  It probably had not taken a detective to figure that out.  “I like kissing you.  We're going to my flat so we can do it again.  It has occurred to me that there are other things besides kissing I may want to investigate more thoroughly.”  He studied John and said, “We should do our investigating together.”
“It is not new blood!  We are searching for the lost!  For those of Wakanda blood who have gone out into the world.”
John had, in the back of his mind for years, the image of an ideal flat.  It looked something like this.  Well, minus the skull, the table full of laboratory equipment and the bullet holes in the wall.  Cozy, a little old-fashioned.  The dead opposite of the tiny shabby post-war house of his childhood or the sterile concrete box on the seventh floor of the building he currently occupied.
Mr. Lestrade grimaced, a hand coming up to drag through his hair.  “Except for the paper work, which I want done tomorrow, and I am not kidding about this, Sherlock, yes.  Yes, we are done.  Which isn't to say I don't have questions,” he added, glancing again at John.
“Mrs. Hudson said I should because...she told me was leaving the building to me in her will and it was a good time to make any changes that would suit my needs.”  John's mouth opened but as nothing came out, Sherlock continued.  “Because of her hip, we gutted out C and made a storage room and a bigger flat on the bottom.  More convenient for a person getting older.  There's stairs to our level, but also we're adding a lift, so she can visit. On our level there's a flat with three bedrooms and above us there is a lab with separate venting, and storage.”
“In this, are you arguing before or against?  With the security problems new blood will bring, now is not the time to begin this project.”
But he kept a clean shirt in his locker here and planned to change.  He'd learned that the hard way.  In the last month he had been vomited upon twice.  Cora met him at the door to his office.  He liked Cora.  When he'd met her he had been unhappy to hear she was married.  She was shorter than he was and currently sporting hair an unlikely shade of bronze.
Mycroft grimaced, his face turning slightly pink.  Embarrassment?  “I believe it was simply prejudice.  You see, the money she sent went to a bank in Africa.”
In an all male environment such as the army, size was a large piece in the big game.  Something teased about, lied about, bragged about. Used to project a masculine image and manipulate others.  John had played the game to such affect that he garnered a reputation. Three Continents Watson.  Although, in his experience, what they said was true.  It wasn't just the size, it was what you did with it, and his reputation was hard-earned and deserved.  But John knew the hand he had been dealt in this game was modest. Perhaps a bit beyond average size.   It made sense that if Sherlock was a larger man, he could be expected to be larger everywhere.
“Yes.  Yes it did,” John managed to say, rolling off and onto his back. He tried to pull the condom off but his fingers weren't cooperating yet.
“It's a plan,” John said weakly.  Because there was a very odd speculative look in Sherlock's eye.  He knew what it meant.  Experiments.
“Yes.  Worked hard to eliminate the need for it.  People try not to let it, but it affected how they saw me.  Or it could be a coincidence that I wasn't getting the jobs I interviewed for.  But got the first one I  applied for without it.”
God, that voice.  It rumbled into his blood.  John flushed.  “Uh, right.” Leftover from his service. They'd suggested silk for all underwear, including pants.  Ballistic boxers, they called them.  The things worked.   More than one soldier had been spared devastating damage because of the protection the special heavy silk offered.  His own hands settled on Sherlock's chest.  “Silk?” he asked in turn.
The man lifted his shoulder in a sort of shrug, tilted his head towards John's friends, and lifted his drink to his mouth.  It made John look at that mouth again.  Was the man doing that on purpose?  “Of course, your plan would have worked better if this was actually a gay bar,” the man explained as he put his glass down.
“Of course I did, John.  That's what good boyfriends do.” He punctuated the statement with a nod, but was looking out from under one curl uncertainly.  He looked adorable.
“Right.  British.  Men.  Uncomfortable.  But we should have talked about things sometimes. We both know that.  But this background you've just shared.  Explains why...  You didn't get raised with actual communication.  You with your keen desire to know, to find out, and nobody who would answer.  Left with only your brain to work things out.  Which, given your brain, it worked for you.”  He took a deep breath.  “I've just realized I didn't get often get  information back from my interactions with my own parents.  If Dad was drinking, you didn't even bother asking.  My mother wouldn't talk to us when he was there, for fear of annoying him if she accidentally contradicted him.  He was big on direct orders, shouting and...hitting.”
Sherlock made a gesture towards John which said stay here and a wave towards Mycroft which prossibly meant, get on with it.  John waited.  Mycroft seemed to know what his brother intended and went on as if permission had been granted.  It probably had.
“You lost a bet.”  Taking small sip from his own glass, the tall, dark man stared his new neighbor.  It was like being under a microscope.
“Mycroft....” John's head was tilted and his mind was, for once, possibly ahead of Sherlock's.  “Are you going to bring them home?”
This story was written in two different versions and I had to combine the two.  This turned out to be most difficult when each version had a good bit and I had to discard one or the other or figure out how to use it.  I still suspect you can see some of the stitching lines.  Please mention it if there is something I screwed up.
Sherlock looked intrigued.  “I wonder how many brands they tested and what the experimental parameters were.   Would you adjust the apertures of the original bottle or design a penis substitute so that the...John?”
“Like you use on your hair?  I don't know if they still do, but certain brands apparently are better than others.  Color, you know, and viscosity.” He's learned that in late night bull session in the Army.  His memory of it was a little blurry.  No surprise considering how much alcohol had been involved.
What relationship do they make with family?  The children of this mother are half Wakandan.  But, the children of this mother have a colonizer father.  Will you allow the father to visit, to stay?  His relatives?”
“Too young for anyone.  They won't even let him in the door over there so he does his hunting here.  What's she do?  At St. Bart's?”
That actually made a lot of sense.  Wait.  No it didn't.  The talking part, okay but...his flat? John stumbled to a halt in front of the table.  Evan was laughing at him and snickered as he said, “Watson! You're kidding me?”  Ted was looking the other way, watching a handcuffed man be put up against the wall by a dark-haired woman who looked pleased to do it.  Aaron was eying Sherlock with intense speculation and something else.  Lust?  John found himself stepping between them as the man moved forward.
“Hence the spirited discussion after you had ordered.”  The man gave a nod and  his glance went out over the room.
That's why John usually went home with someone, true.  But he wasn't comfortable with jumping from a few kisses into bed.  Not under these circumstances.  “You said the kiss was an experiment,” John said. “Quite a leap to sex, really.”
Sherlock was climbing back into bed, leaned over to open the drawer in the bedside table, and fetched out a tube lubricant, a well-known brand, mostly unused, which he dropped on the bed. Then he arranged himself supine, but supported by his elbows in order to see John, as he sent a 'what's keeping you' look.
Taba said, “This list of people we would accept back is not complete.  But I would like to present a sample case, for discussion.  If you will permit this?”
God, that grin.  “Not right now, we can't,”  John flopped onto his back and tried to take a deeper breath.
“Ohmyghh, ohmyvery, gah!” he gasped, watching himself paint stripes over the glistening damp of somebody else's spent cock.  Then he dropped down and tried to remember how to breathe and listened to another set of laboring lungs under his cheek.
“Because you have this driving need to know, and the only answer to this puzzle will have to come through actual communication.  Talking with your parents is, as far as I can tell, something you've always avoided.” John took another sip of the less than satisfactory tea.
Finally, tentatively, Sherlock said, “Mrs. Hudson and I made some changes during the repairs.  221.”
“Did their mother teach them the language or will they need a translation devise?  How will they learn the culture, how to live, to buy food, to find a job, a house?  Will they be acknowledged as kin by the mother's family? Is there inheritance involved?  What proof of the story is there except the word of her sister? Will legal action be taken against the attacker, who is still alive?
Fireworks hell, that was an atom bomb.  An explosion of feeling and heat and taste and John lunged forward for more even as he felt an arm around his shoulders pulling him closer and his mouth was open now, pressing into and then devouring the responsive, gasping mouth opening under his onslaught.
“We have cousins, more or less of our own age,” Mycroft confirmed.  “Whom I need to find,” he added.  “Meanwhile, I have a legal team sorting out the inheritance.  Because Uncle Rudy's money went to Mummy.  Mummy, of course,  had money of her own, so I do not believe she was trying to feather her own nest.”  He said it as if he were grateful not to have that sin added to the growing list.  “By rights the inheritance should go to Rudy's children. With interest, it will be a significant sum.”
“Tell me about the wager,” the man demanded again.  It was almost charming, but not quite, due to a bit of arrogance in the tone.  Okay.  A lot of arrogance.  The man didn't care how embarrassing it might be for John, he wanted answers to his question.
An hour later he woke up to find he'd been cleaned off a little but left half sprawled across a tangle of bedclothes.  His neck ached because he'd been pillow-less.  His shoulders weren't too happy with him, either.  He staggered up and took another much needed shower and then dressed and wandered out to the kitchen.  Sherlock had actually made tea.
It was probably two minutes later that a hand fell on his shoulder and gave enough of a pull to break the suction between them.  John looked up to tell whomever it was to piss off,  It was the silver-haired man from the corner, number two on Molly's best looking list.  Right now he looked amused, impatient and exultant.
John knew he would have been the innocent victim wearing the drink, and the glass was almost full.  He had deliberately seated himself in the spot right beside this madman, so it was probably his own fault.  Given the choice between a drenching and a kiss, he was voting for the kiss.  Which made his stomach roll a bit.   “Urm.  Probably,” he said, a bit belatedly.  It looked as if he were actually going to kiss this man.  He slid a glance towards the table where Molly held court, noting that everyone's attention was still firmly planted on him.  He swallowed, hard, and cut his eyes back to the man who was now staring at him with keen speculation.
Mycroft sighed.  “Quite.  He maintained two families, each in ignorance of the other, each apparently of equally long standing.  We were just grateful that there were no children from the...other family, although grandfather was supporting the three children from that wife's first marriage, so there were dependents  involved and two wills to investigate.  It took quite some time to sort out.”  Mycroft took a deep breath and continued, “During this time, a notice came which said that Uncle Rudy's wife and two children had died.  In a fire.  This news left him...damaged.  Devastated, in fact.  And when Eurus began to...when she used fire to destroy people...it may have contributed to his...choices.   At any rate, after dealing with...everything, Uncle Rudy drank himself to death in remarkably short order.”
she actually wanted to know.  She gave me a look.  And don't worry about Mrs. Turner's renters.  One of them's a screamer.  Nothing new to them there.”
“I needed to discover the effects of assault with a whip, postmortem.  I brought my own whip,” he explained patiently.
“Well, yes.  Next week.  And they can't make it today instead.  I already called and asked,” she added.
“If we add in their spouses, children and the spouses parents, brothers, sisters.  The number may be over a thousand!” Makanta dropped his voice when she glared at him.
“The silk. The way you hold your shoulders.  Walk.  You have a trace of a limp, too.  You used a cane when you first came back?”
“Experiment,” the man called Sherlock mumbled, his own eyes glued to John's.  There was a fire in them now, a sort of mad exultation.  John wondered if his own eyes were as intense.  “Successful experiment,” Sherlock added.
“I didn't know anyone else could hear!”  Cora rolled her eyes.  Well, yes, it had been stupid of him.
John pulled up his other leg, wrapping it around the other man's thigh awkwardly.  With his nose smashed against a heavy shoulder, he was rethinking logistics and abandoning well-practiced moves for something that actually allowed him to breathe.  But he was loathe to move his groin out of alignment with the thickening counterpart he was rubbing against. He twisted into a position that gave him more leverage and the chance for air, but he didn't stop, couldn't stop, and it was no real surprise less than two minutes later when Sherlock froze, convulsed, and then collapsed on him, completely boneless.   John had to heave Sherlock over onto his back and, leaning over him on one elbow, used the other hand to frantically jerk himself off all over the mess Sherlock had....
“I'll be over at eight.”  In one smooth motion Sherlock scooped up his coat and slid it over his shoulders as he turned.  It swirled dramatically as he rounded the corner.
“Add lying, cheating, avaricious buffoons,” Sherlock said.   “Children of father's sister and quite envious of his...better financial status.”
“I'll call you!” John managed to say before they were out of earshot.  “Wait.  How did you know Molly's last name?”
John shook his head.  Mycroft?  Sherlock had once said that Mycroft's problem was that he did not even take time off to even visit the toilet.  He probably not had a proper holiday in years.  Typical that it would be a working vacation.
It took heroic effort not to spray the beer all over the man's elegant suit.  John choked slightly and gasped a bit around a huff of laughter.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw Mike give a shoulder punch to Evan.
“What I discovered in the secret cabinet is disturbing.  It's going to take some time to untangle the legalities and  it will--” he glanced at Sherlock and did not go on.
Instead he was marveling at how easily Sherlock had been distracted.  But even as the thought passed through is mind Sherlock turned his attention to John again.  The vest was pulled off over his head.  Gentle fingers traced his scars while soft lips pressed into the juncture of shoulder and neck.  John shivered and drew away, reaching out.   He had a slightly hard time pulling off Sherlock's shirt.  He had to do it one-handed as that shoulder didn't have the range of motion to reach so far over his head.  He was reminded again of the sheer maleness of the person he was undressing.
Then Sherlock's hands were deftly undoing his belt and John's stomach was suddenly churning.  The angle was wrong to reciprocate and so he let his hands settle on Sherlock's hips and stepped out of his trousers when they fell to the floor.  Should have taken his shoes off first he thought as he heeled them off. He shivered as the air hit his mostly nude body.   Sherlock stepped out of his own shoes as John  returned the favor, trying to show confidence as he worked at getting the trousers to slide off those hardly-there hips. God, the fabric.
It was surprisingly entertaining.  John washed up, forcing Sherlock to dry because if you counted what had been sitting around in the sink there were too many dishes to just leave to dry themselves.   Afterward, they settled in front of the TV.  It took some time to find something they could both enjoy.  Sherlock had what John considered a rather unnatural and unmasculine disinclination to watch car chases, but he did have a small interest in explosions.  He kept interrupting the movie to wonder how this effect or that might have been produced.
“Hello, Sher...how do you do that?    Never mind.  Tell me later.  I have a bit of a problem I hope you can help me with.  No, no one's dead.  No murder involved at all, sorry.  It's just, I need to come up with a speaker right away.  Yes, here at the clinic. I haven't even told you where I work but... Oh.  Yes, that's it. Yes, but.  Okay, the subject has to be some sort of connection with the medical field and a community resource or...no.  I don't think there's enough time to pull your friend away from her work. Although that's a good idea for the next time they stick us with this shite, which they will.”
“That someone deliberately dumped us in the shit?  Yes.  And you know who my first suspect is, too.”
A wintry small smile settled on Mycroft's face as he realized what John was thinking, but his attention stayed on Sherlock.
“She didn't tell her brother his children lived?” John said, his eyes darting towards the bedroom his daughter shared with Mrs. Hudson.
“Oh, god,” John murmured.  Somehow, asking a not-gay stranger for a kiss was even more embarrassing than asking a gay stranger for a kiss.  In either case he was probably lucky he hadn't collected a fist to the face.
John made the sort of sound he made when he had an opinion but did not want to express it out loud. Then he drank some of his tea.  “I see something,” he eventually said.
Sherlock was tall,  but not really a big man, and John knew oh so well that he himself was not physically a big man himself   But there was a difference of scale; none of his girlfriends had been ever been anywhere near six feet tall.  It wasn't that he didn't seek out tall women, it was that they didn't usually show much interest in him.
“I still don't think we're quite there yet. Boyfriends, I mean. It hasn't even been 24 hours, Sherlock!”
“If he was wearing some sort of native African dress in his own home, and someone walked in on him, they might not realize,” he waved his hand, too lazy to explain, sure that he had given John enough information.  Then Sherlock frowned, glancing at the door Mycroft hd exited from.  “I wonder what he was holding back?”
“We're going to my flat. I've deduced you would not leave without a word with your friends.  Say good-bye, but don't linger.  We need to talk.”
No one objected, although there were side glances and a few quiet asides.  “I will set out for you the case of  a woman, Otasti, whose family wished her to marry their very esteemed neighbor, a widower older than she.  She said no, firmly.  Her family accepted this, but the suitor did not, and one evening, decided to solve the problem another way.  His argument was that, if she was carrying his child, there was no reason not to marry.  He attacked her.  She did not speak out to get justice because of threats he made in regards to her younger sister and younger brother.  She told her sister the situation, then she ran away during that same night.  She started a new life, married. Now she is dead, but her two children yet live.  Do they even know of their mother's country?  Suppose they return to Wakanda.
