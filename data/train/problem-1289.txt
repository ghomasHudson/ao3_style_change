“Yes. But no matter how fast I run, he gets farther and farther ahead. Some nights, he gets blown to bits in front of me, sometimes it’s me who gets it. Other nights he just fades away. Like he was never there at all.” He scrubbed at his face with both hands. “It’s bloody stupid, really. I had plenty of mates die over there, and I only dream about the one who didn’t.” Might as well have, though. Simon had made that clear enough –
“Not so dead.” John wanted to shake Sherlock for not getting it already. “Well, he’s dead, yes. Shot. Shot up rather.” John dropped his arms and stepped back, exhausted. “He’s connected to this. Talk to Molly.”
Kate recognized that move. Get too close to an uncomfortable truth and Sherlock deflected. She looked at the paper. “Of course . . . I just . . .”
“Maybe you should start from the beginning,” John said. He sat in his chair opposite Kate and leaned forward and she felt oddly comforted, like she was one of his patients. “Is Chloe your girlfriend?”
The dumplings were sublime, the beer cold. He’d forgotten what young taste buds added to the enjoyment of a meal. That and the way John sucked plum sauce off his pinky finger, the way his eyes sparked as he talked about his time in medical school and the terrible Chinese takeaway near Barts that served ketchup with their dumplings.
“Your explanations are tedious.” He leans down and nuzzles my neck. “And they are wildly inaccurate.”
sort of way – an abundance of plaid upholstery and dark wood. He checked in and had to explain to a very bored but polite young man, that no
“What I vowed to do – keep John and Mary safe. For John. Because I have done enough. He’s endured enough.”
He bent stiffly to pick up the cane from the floor. “My mother called those piecrust promises, Dr. Thompson. Easily made, easily broken. I’ve had enough of those to last a lifetime.”
Sherlock was still in his chair when John came downstairs wearing a jumper the colour of mushy peas. Sherlock was capital T thinking, legs crossed and hands steepled under his chin. It was past six and he listened as John prowled the kitchen, opening and closing cupboard doors, standing in front of the open fridge, tapping his fingers against the door. He picked up the empty kettle, sighed and put it back on the burner. Sherlock heard paper rustling and John came back into the living room with a stack of cream crackers in one hand.
“Your wallet is on the dresser in my room,” Sherlock said to John. “It contains two twenties and one ten pound note – give it to her.”
“She’s a cop too. Local, not RCMP like me. We met three years ago on a murder investigation. I never worked so hard to solve a case – I knew I couldn’t ask her out until we closed it. We moved in together a month later.”
The waitress set down the pot of tea and plate of lemon scones in front of her. “Anything else, miss?”
John turned on his side and scooted closer to him. He reached out one arm, rested his hand against Sherlock’s hip as if to anchor him in his world, and slid into sleep.
He leaned his head back against the wall. There was something familiar about Ronan, but nothing he could put his finger on. Maybe he’d come into his clinic once with his mother or sat opposite him on the Tube ride home. It was one of those puzzles that your brain works out on its own and the solution comes to you days later in the middle of shaving or drinking your tea.
“As much as I enjoy you cataloguing my scars, John, I need coffee.” He sat up and scrubbed his face. “Lots of coffee.”
John didn’t move. He felt paralyzed. The memory of everything that had ever happened in this room had him rooted to the floor. He was uncertain. He was pleased. He was terrified. When he had told Sherlock he’d chosen, he’d been lying. Well, not about his choice, just about this. This retracing of the steps to the place he had been the most happy. He knew there was no coming back from this final step. Not this time. If things went sideways now, he knew he wouldn’t survive. And he wasn’t being drunkenly melodramatic, either.
“Later,” he says, his voice a low growl. I lift my hips and Sherlock pulls my trousers past my hips in one swift motion. The man has many talents.
He lay back on the bed and closed his eyes. Was there someone he should call? Harry, maybe. Probably. But not until . . . later. He felt a bit guilty he didn’t want to see her, didn’t want to hear her awkward attempts at saying something heartfelt and meaningful. No doubt he’d end up trying to make
“If I hadn’t returned, he’d still be with her. Happily, I believe. Looking forward to the birth of their child. How many times can I . . . and still expect –” He stopped and took a long breath. “Have you ever lost anyone, Kate?” His voice was thick.
So why couldn’t she shake the feeling that she needed to stay a little longer? Sherlock was brilliant, but a complete imbecile when it came to his own relationships. He would analyse and deduce and plan and in the end he’d fuck it all up because he knew nothing about human nature. Sherlock still didn’t understand that all John had ever wanted to hear was “Choose me.” Someone needed to protect him from himself. Preferably someone who wasn’t fucking at least one other person in the room.
She scrolled through stories that claimed he was a fake, twice as many that claimed he wasn’t. She felt a surge of pity, she knew how much those stories must have irritated Sherlock. How much they must have hurt John.
John finished the tea and yawned. He stood and stretched, “I don’t know why I’m suddenly so sleepy.”
“Thoughts?” Sherlock asks. He means do I want to hear his. I nod and he continues, “So where is our Ms. Miller?”
It was John who wanted a service for Sherlock. Somewhere away from the city, he told Harry, away from the cameras and the reporters and the lies. John recognised a funeral was probably not what Sherlock would have wanted, but throwing himself off the roof had taken away any say he might have had in the matter. It turned out that Sherlock being dead had a profound effect on John’s ability to think about anything besides Sherlock being dead, so when his sister offered to organise it, he agreed.
John had no answer or maybe his answer was in his touch. He wrapped Sherlock in a hug, his skin warm and alive under Sherlock’s fingertips.
There was a breakfast restaurant a couple of blocks away. Made a decent cheese omelet, even better coffee. She’d give John and Sherlock some morning after privacy. Maybe she’d bring back some muffins and coffee for them if she felt generous.
Moriarty had a hand in this before his demise, it seems. Who was he? The name sets him on edge. He decides to search his mansion for anything that’s there. He closes his eyes, his back resting against the headboard, steepling his fingers and pressing them against his lips. He stands in front of his grand mansion and steps inside the large, wooden doors leading inside. He takes the winding stairs up. On the second floor at the end of the hall, there’s a door with the name “James Moriarty” written neatly on a placard in Sherlock’s hand. He reaches for the knob, turns, and pulls.
"Ta. Bring your paycheck so I can win it off you," John waves as Greg heads out the door. Greg hadn't known, or hadn't thought it worth mentioning, but Pelham is not only on the city council but on the board of the hospital as well. Once he finds out the man who accused his sister is a patient, who knew what he might do if he decided to find an alternate suspect for the police?
“I blamed Mycroft. My last words to him were bitter. I regret them.” She sat down on Sherlock’s old four-poster bed with a simple frame covered in an old handmade quilt much like the one in the chair his mum sat upon. “I’m afraid it’s a all bit cluttered. When Willie disappeared, Mycroft had his apartment packed up and kept some of his more personal possessions here, hoping.”
Markham’s eyes open wide. John is grinning at my deductions. His eyes sparkle in approval, which makes me propel myself around more and wave my arms dramatically.
I climbed inside behind Sherlock and nodded to our pilot, who smiled back and waved at us. He was a striking bloke, reminding me of a silver-haired Tom Cruise. He was skilled—that we found out pretty quickly. He brought us up flying backwards to avoid another chopper in front of us, and once clear, spun us around. My stomach dropped. The pilot gave us a wink, then lifted us into the sky on our side, blades whooshing and whirling. What a rush! It certainly felt like something out of a Mission Impossible movie as we spun around and headed up and over London.
"The one I left on the stairs just in case we were out of her sight. There are instructions telling her we're locked inside the freezer and to let us out."
It’s a perfect day. They’re on the far side of the island, sun warming their faces, where they rediscover the traces of the old walls on top of a forty-foot cliffs jumbled in richly colored reddish-brown rocks.
"Doctor, we're just talking," the woman, who is clearly a murderer and probably not a patient, says. "No need for a scene." She looks over John's shoulder and nods briefly. He glances around Eyebrows to see another tall man with a hand inside his jacket. Damn. "Come on, don't want you late for your shift," she says.
When Sherlock fired up a second joint, paranoia struck John to the core. It was most evident in his flicking eyes and twitching jaw. Watching Watson squirm caused a most unusual sensation inside Sherlock's chest.
I stopped dead in front of one of the tombstones. "Sherlock, did you see the name on this?" I pointed.
I shiver. The very heart I denied betrays me as white-hot pain shoots into my chest. I will myself to remain upright. I clear my throat.
Molly laughs. “The best part was when the mother told you that Sherlock wasn’t a girl’s name, and then named her 'Watson'!”
"You've half a point there,” Greg says. “I'm still not sure why this is bothering you, but out of respect for my fellow professional and poker player, I will let you know if I uncover that posh tosser's C.V. See you Thursday night?"
Sherlock was home and John wasn’t. Not that he expected John to come back. Sherlock knew he had to at some point. He didn’t have anywhere to stay on campus.
Sherlock doesn’t answer directly. “The owner wished to remain anonymous and wanted to make certain the island would remain open to the public and preserved as it is for future generations. No buildings allowed. Ever.”
“I thought as much. I need to know the whole story. There’s already so much misinformation about how the epidemic started, and Sophy Kratides and her cohorts are part of feeding this false information to what’s left of the press.”
Even as Sherlock fled deeper into his mind palace, he felt John calling him. Touching his wrist, his neck. Making sure Sherlock was alright. It was the most comforting realization. Someone thought him worthy of friendship, for himself. He'd misjudged emotion in the past, but he was certain he'd read John correctly.
I close my eyes. I don’t tell him the link. I don’t need to confirm what I know now to be true. I know the answer, and it’s an answer I don’t want John to hear. Not yet. Not until I understand why. I need to distract them both. I take my deductions in another direction. Since I do, however, know why he’s dressed the way he is.
“Must I do everything,” Moriarty said. He reached into his coat and pulled out a Baby Browning. “Drop your gun, Sherlock, or it will be my distinct pleasure to end John Watson’s life.”
John's head pounds when he sits up. "Oh, it's 'Irene' now? Are you on a first name basis now that you're both in the Not Dead Club? Bloody hell, can you please give me some paracetamol or something for my head? I can't argue with you properly while I'm in pain like this."
I prepare myself for his possible reaction. He destroyed the USB and told Mary her past was her business, but her future was his privilege. What will John do if I tell him that she planned to leave him?
“I don’t believe this. You owe me, John Watson! I’ll take the first floor and the basement. You take the upper floors.”
While the candles flickered, James talked about himself. Sherlock realized the Jim's stories about the psyches of deviant bank robbers and ax murderers targeted their common interests in homicide and the science of deduction. James cleverly omitted any of clues to his past from all his cases.
He shrugged and snugged up his collar. He was always saying things like this to me when in reality, a name is one of the most important things if not
John knew all about those, he'd had a few. One from Sally down the street for two bucks. But it was the one from a boy at camp the previous summer that changed John forever.
Who was this Sherlock Holmes who came into his life? John felt as if he was thrown straight into the middle of an Agatha Christie novel.
Sherlock pushed his pants lower as his cock throbbed at the same tempo. All the while his never let his eyes leave the sight of John.
But Moriarty made a mistake. Or he hadn't. Sherlock believed Moriarty had intentionally left the evidence. Either way it didn't matter. The evidence tied James to the crimes, but it also tied Sherlock. The only thing that saved Sherlock from arrest was that Lestrade knew Moriarty's cunning handiwork. He saw the trap Moriarty set. That by implicating himself, he was trying to force Sherlock into his world.
He should know better than to care. People are fickle. In a few days, John Watson will forget Sherlock even lived upstairs.
“Wait! I have a new internet wifi access option...it says from this flat! How?” John sits back, he holds out the mobile as if Sherlock could see it from the kitchen. Then Sherlock spies John’s eyes light up in an explosive flash of realization. “Oh! Mycroft!”
“Hope you don’t mind, but I asked Gregory Lestrade to do some checking.” John leans on the counter. “Want some toast?”
“I’d prefer if you keep calling me Will.” Sherlock shuffles his feet to get warm. “Or at least, Sherlock.”
I turned back to the manor. "It looks still as death." Although the grounds looked tidy, no light illuminated the windows. "Does someone actually live here?" I asked.
Eyes still looking up and shining, his lashes fluttering, his cheeks flushing, Sherlock sits back on his heels.
"Yer no alchemist! Best alchemist in all of London, my arse! All them stories about your powers was a lie."
John never says a word and waits until Sherlock sets down his bow. He can’t believe how breathtaking Sherlock looks with the window’s night lights illuminating his profile.
. Except not. She walks around the bed and lifts the sheet. She plucks the mobile from his feeble hand.
John frowned. The spectre of the news article raised its ugly head again. Sherlock recognized his error. While it was in fact most distressing to Sherlock as well—that it could have been them—he pushed the thought aside.
“I understand that the roads are deplorable, but are you intentionally aiming at every pothole in the road? For a man who’s worried about returning his friend’s car in one piece
And heat? Since renters in the winter months were rare, heating the cabin obviously was never thought necessary and only an afterthought because of “deer hunting season.” The old cast iron stove hooked up to the propane tank worked, but the antiquated propane heater was useless. He stared at the gloomy walls with soot stains on from his first night here. Sherlock had to pull a dead racoon from the red sandstone chimney of the fireplace before he could even start a decent fire.
Sorry that it’s been a day or two since my last entry. Life has been seriously busy, and Sherlock is back in his room upstairs! Sherlock, the madman, has been getting himself and our new feline flatmate, Blackbeard, acclimated to 221b.
"Mummy had me take lessons, and I loved to dance from the start," Sherlock says. "Although not so much with my cousin, Elizabeth at Christmas. She was such a bore."
"Oh, American crime boss. Yes. That would make consummate sense, but I don't want you risking your life."
John’s head popped up as another minion slid through the door. This one was roped up like a steer and pissed as hell, but otherwise looked unharmed.
Of course he’s still not going to share his bloody plan! They leave the greenhouse behind, and John asks again twice before they get to the flat. Still nothing from Sherlock.
I do have an end note on False Memories. I plan to add more on this subject to chapter endings as the story continues.
That’s why he escaped into his music, humming and strumming a few Neil Young songs on his six-string. Easy to sing and not think. At least until his roommate decided to come closer. Sherlock was even humming along next to him. In his underwear.
Unlike Mycroft, Sherlock did enjoy parts of Michigan. While John Watson was the main draw, he enjoyed the wilderness walks. While Sherlock had used his mind palace at night, his days were filled hiking through snow.
"It should be some sort of fantasy we could actually have some fun with," John suggests. "We could pretend that I am an alpha, you are an omega. You've just gone unexpectedly into heat, and I'm forced to knot you."
“Pandora left the world in chaos with some ready to step into seats of power,” Mycroft says. “While we did not stop Pandora, we can stop those who created it and coveted that power. We can possibly find an antidote if they try such a thing again.”
Sherlock can’t help but touch John’s body. It keeps his mind off the panic he feels within. He lets his long fingers distract him as he explores the curve of John’s back, the pivot of his neck. John laps a path down the center Sherlock’s chest then veers off to suck at his nipples. He keeps his tongue flat with every rough-tongued lick.
John moans between them, and Sherlock’s hands itch to touch him, to find out if he is well, but to do that would put John in more peril.
"I am sorry, Mr. Watson, if that is the way you feel. If you should change your mind, I am but a phone call away."
Sometimes words fail me, fail us both. I need him to speak. He holds my hand tighter as Rosie turns and smiles at us.
He helps me out. My legs are more unsteady than when we got in. He’s drying us both off. I can’t even try to do it. I’m completely absorbed in the moment. John begins drying my hair, his fingers vigorously rubbing my scalp through the towel. It feels heavenly, and I have to bite back a moan when John stops.
Mycroft believes I have gone insane. Maybe I have, but I heard John’s voice, or I thought it was his voice. It’s coming from the homeless man who now sits in John’s chair. He’s wearing John’s old tattered tartan dressing gown and ugly slippers. He’s drinking black coffee from John’s chipped Army mug.
He had to admit that he did think about sex a lot, but probably not every seven seconds. He wasn't sure how often other people thought about sex since it's not something people went around asking. He wouldn’t casually turn to Molly in Biology class and say, "Hey, Moll, how often do you think about the horizontal mambo?" He supposed he could ask Sherlock. It might even result in actual sex, which is a lot better thinking about it.
Next he looks for any personal files. Again, only those of the past owner. Family photos, bills, receipts, emails. An elderly couple, but he already knew that the moment he walked inside this place. He looks to see if there are ties to Sophy Kratides. He finds none. She chose the house at random, no ties to the owner, or the game.
I found the truth in my studies through my books, my science, and my obsession: alchemy. I wanted to become an alchemist. I scoured shops for supplies and books to learn all I could. I read every scrap I found. At ten years old, I performed my first transmutation: a simple fire into water. All the while, my family encouraged me.
“Your family name cleared?” John continues to scan the posts, clicking backward. “That would be nice for your Mum, but that’s not why you’re doing this, is it, Mycroft?”
John had hoped the jaunt across campus to work study would help clear his mind, but he still couldn’t get it out of his head.
John supposed he'd find out soon enough if the peckerhead ever woke up from his self-induced trance.
I’m afraid I can’t give too many details here since he’s sure to read this. Yes, I mean you, Sherlock. Basically, I’m saying that it was one of the best snogs of my life. But please Sherlock, don’t get your head too all blown up about it. On the merry-go-round in Primary, Little Cindy Lynn Schuster bested you.
She looks puzzled. It could be an act, but Sherlock doesn’t think so. Then she gives a huff. “You’re one to bring up sibling issues.” She sits forward in her seat toward him. “Despite what you’ve been told, I have no siblings.”
“I expected as much.” His words are slow, slurred; his mind reduced to single thread of thoughts. It’s so...
I walk over to John's chair and kneel before him. “I’m not even certain as to why. That may even have been planted by Eurus. We don’t know how much of what’s happened is us. That is why you should never blame yourself for all that happened afterward.”
“Oh, but I do. I know who I’m meant to think it is— Lord Henry Blackwood but...” She taps her finger against her temple.
John wonders if he should feel grateful to this thief. He hasn’t needed his cane much since. It’s like the man is some bloody faith healer.
Whatever Thomas gave her begins to take effect. Her eyes start to slip shut, yet she struggles to speak. “I n-never. G-got to. S-say. G-goodbye.”
After dinner, I finish the dishes, and John gives Rosie a bath. I hear singing from the bathroom, and “I’m a Little Teapot” rings out in John’s clear tenor accompanied by Rosie’s splashing. As I walk to the bathroom to capture the moment for my mind palace, I’m distracted by an incoming text message. It’s John’s mobile that persistently vibrates and rattles against the wood of the coffee table. I decide to ignore it, and glad I did. I suppress a laugh when John's arm loops as a handle and his other as the spout while he sings "when I get all steamed up hear me shout, tip me over and pour me out.”
“Bloody hell, yes you do!” John sighs, lips pursed in determination. He fixes his glare at Sherlock’s face until he captures Sherlock’s eyes. “I knew we should have talked more first. I told myself I’d never do this again. Not talk about things.”
What little I can see of his round face is beet red, and his mask is soaked with sweat that’s burning his eyes. He tries to sit up, and speaks so fast that his words slur together.
A large range of variables were listed. John eyed the extensive list. Subjects were divided into the usual by age, socio, and economic groups, but also included other interesting inclusions, such as how many hours spent watching television per day and how many times per week they dined out.
"Promise me," John said, "promise me you won't go off by yourself to confront these two. Tell me, let me help, or at least call your spooky brother or this Lestrade from Scotland Yard."
She laughs and pats Sherlock’s hand as she sits down next to him. “No, I don’t. But it’s not only for money. No need to go to such lengths either. It’s a waste of time and energy, and there’s other less messy ways of going about silencing people.”
. I packed the book for you along with those on flora and fauna. I'm surprised you found time to read it with all of the distractions."
“Please. Don’t you bore me too! You want to make sure I don’t spoil your plot to gain control of Cardiff and other grander designs you have.”
He remembers after Eurie, their vacations too, but his first real memory after his sister left was of he and Mycroft on the beach.
John stands and brushes the sand off his trousers. This time it’s John’s hand that reaches out; it’s John’s hand that pulls Sherlock up.
Sherlock stops dead in the office doorway. A lamp is overturned, papers litter the floor. He takes three more steps inside. Behind the desk, Lord Blackwood is sprawled out on the floor on his back. Face pale, marks around his neck. Sherlock doesn’t need to kneel down and feel his pulse to know he’s dead but not for long. Still he checks, the dogs helping him, each whining and whimpering and licking their master.
“It’s important that Ms. Sophy Kratides doesn’t find out I’ve returned,” he calls back. “I don’t want her looking for me and finding Sherlock in the process.” The way he spits out her name there’s no disguising his contempt for her.
“Vivian told her that it was a message. It was to let you know that you weren’t untouchable and that others will know what you are.” John takes a deep breath. “How did Carolyn Norbury get the note?” he asks me.
John gives William a damp flannel to wipe his face, then begins getting his IV set up and back in. He’s cursing himself for not realizing William might run.
“Transporting them that far would not be wise,” Sherlocks says and immediately stomps off to speak to his brother. John can’t hear or see the discussion, but when he returns, Sherlock looks pleased with himself.
John's mind had been set that he'd be the one on the receiving end. Not to be. At least not this time.
“By the way, John, you have toothpaste on your chin,” she said. She reached out and rubbed it off his face.
"Get out. This your new home. It's rather nice, I'm told, for an older ketch. You'll find food and what you need inside," says Captain Obvious as the boat bumps into the dock. "Good luck."
"It's only a name. My name is Sherlock Holmes. Your name is John Watson. A name is of little consequence. It serves merely as a label."
“You mean genetically?” John asks. “That’s what you’re getting at? I read a study about genius genomes once. It’s been years. What are you suggesting?”
John froze in the middle of the sidewalk. The next moment, he heard fast footfalls and a body careened into him, sending John tumbling to the ground. John's knuckles immediately began to burn from hitting the pavement. He sat up to glare at whoever had run into him. He was sitting on the pavement next to John, brushing off his trouser legs. A shake of his head, sent thick, dark-haired bangs from over his eyes. Those eyes met John's with intensity. Not angry, but curious.
Mycroft takes another bite of eggs, swallows politely, then nods, “Very well. Go ahead, dear brother.”
“Alright, then.” John clicks on video file. There’s also folders with documents. The images on the screen are dark and difficult to make out at times but a moment later, Sherlock sees himself on the screen clearly, walking near the Cardiff docks. He’s wearing his Belstaff but beneath he’s wearing crisp dress trousers and a dark shirt. He’s a stone heavier.
They step into the clearing around the airstrip. The vista of the Pacific with the rich navy blues and turquoise of the reef makes John feel like a speck against its majesty. He thrusts his hands into the pockets of his khaki swim trunks and sighs.
“I’m so...relieved.” Greg pulls himself together. God knows John’s seen Greg lose it before, but he’s surprised that he’s the cause. “You hadn’t stopped around, so I thought I’d stop by yours. When we found your jumper covered in blood, I thought I’d lost one of my best mates! I was never so relieved when Molly came back with the labs that the blood wasn’t yours.” He embraces John again in another suffocating hug.
He continues to leer down at John's naked and flushed form. He makes a show of grasping his long cock in his hand and strokes it firmly until it stands tall and proud. He shifts around the bed as John lifts his head to watch.
Sherlock assesses himself. “Resting heart rate, 45. Close to normal. Breathing rapid, but within acceptable range. I suggest we watch the video.”
"Do not be hasty. There is much to gain, incentives to be had. I assure you that any information you give me will reap numerous benefits. That, and I have much to share with you regarding my brother dear. "
“My, my. That is what I love about you, so full of surprises.” James brushed off his suit-jacket sleeve, then glanced at his watch.
He goes into his flat, gets Sherlocks meds, some food. He’s for shite at taking care of himself. John knows Anthea will track him on his mobile and leaves it on the table. He checks his service revolver still stuffed in the back of his jeans. He may need it although he hopes not. It’s beginning to get dark.
There’s a pinch and twinge in his shoulder. Even in first class seats, the three and a half hour ride fucks with him, but he’s too intent on what’s on his mobile to care.
I grimace. I will now have to disinfect, which is only marginally better than sterilizing the stairway.
“The man had a list. But it was old, faded, illegible list. Too washed out for most people to make out. In fact, it was a list over a shopping list! That’s why we missed it! We just thought it was a slip of paper. What Will saw immediately was the list beneath. A list of past substances he had used. William said it was 'obvious' that he had experienced a near death episode before this. You know as well as I that addicts often quit only to return to the addiction. He kept this note in case it happened again— either from overdose or, as Will suggested, a sudden death episode.” Molly shrugged. "It's rather sad, really, he wasn't using anymore but his past still got him."
John, no. I gave my heart to you long ago, but you never realized. You still don’t see. Although a BAMF never misses the mark, at least John Watson does when it comes to identifying the object of my affections.
"It must be. Reading the book last night was very strange. It was like it was about me. But I'm less sure of what I know about myself than I did before. Though it explains the constant dreams of the sea."
Sherlock said he would think about it. He did. But his soul was not something Sherlock was willing to part with.
leather gloves.The inside of them. Examine his effects.” He points to a large evidence bag. “You will find that the substance used to incapacitate the victim are in his gloves.”
Sherlock wakes early. Takes a shower. Makes coffee begins breakfast. It’s good to surprise John like he surprises Sherlock. While John’s in the shower, Sherlock writes John a new note and slips it in John’s billfold.
“You need to rest. I’ll sit here.” He smiles, taking the chair next to my bed. “I don’t know if I could trust myself if I crawled in next to you.”
Then he nearly staggers and falls. How could he have missed this?! Although these buildings held no interest to him, he’d thought he’d nosed around the edges of this place— or so he told himself— but what he sees before him is something he either avoided or blocked from his mind.
"Most serial killers don't seem the type. They relish hiding in plain sight. Some pose as simple, ordinary men. Others project a congenial and very engaging demeanor, as does Moriarty. Do not mistake this for weakness in them—it is their strength. They wait and play with their prey." Sherlock walked back and forth in front of the beds.
He hates to hit a woman, but he does. It's mostly reflex—he actually didn't intend to, but she jabbed him. He's almost out of her grasp when the second woman trips him and pushes him down. His knees slam into the pavement.
Even before Pandora this was a rough place. After, it became the most crime-ridden of sections. Most of the dwellings are blackened skeletons, trees scorched and scarred, the grass consumed and replaced with trash, weeds, and muck. When learning the layout of the city, Will came here. The experience from the knife wound in his side was enough. Will never returned.
We wait for him. The water runs. At least he washed his hands. He comes out, his mask is off and he’s a mess of wild red hair.
But Sherlock is certain that John is not as excited about the plan as he was about last night’s hand job. And Sherlock then realizes, neither is he. As for expiring, that will be over Sherlock’s dead body.
But Sherlock forced himself remained cautious. Better to gradually increase the bids and build the pot slowly, than to push all your chips into the pile at once and lose it all. Sherlock would be love to be the pot to be won. He needed John to be willing to gamble a bit.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “I’ll need to decide what pertains and what does not. I need access to your assets, records. Tangible. Intangible. I would also like to speak to this Lord Henry Blackwood.”
“Not long ago, I couldn't wait to leave this place. Now I never want to." John gives Sherlock's knee a squeeze. "But I will. If you must, I will too."
“He’s really handsome,” Mary said. “But you’re right, he is a big jerk.” She pulled her scarf over her head. “I know you don’t want to put off talking to him, but you really should come up and get warm. It’s starting to sleet.”
Shame would just have to look the other way and Paranoia would have to find something else to worry about.
"You father didn't want a scandal. He believed threats of bringing charges against the thief would be enough to keep him from returning. Sadly, greed and stupidity have no bounds. You lover returned to you. Last night, your father surprised him sneaking in through the back to the kitchen. He hit your father over the head and picked up the cleaver to do more serious damage. Brutus bravely came to the rescue. And that was when you came in."
John loves being breached by Sherlock, who makes love with the grace and passion of a dancer. At each hint of building orgasm, Sherlock reads John and slows.
"Go on, John," she'd coaxed. "I really don't think you'll find the dress fitting very entertaining. And after all, it's bad luck to see a bride in her dress."
John sighed. He didn’t want to set the gun down. He was trusting that the fiery glow in Sherlock’s eyes meant that he had a plan. Maybe he shouldn’t. John slowly lowered the Colt and set it down on the opposite end of the kitchen table from where his hostage was tied to the leg. John let his hands flap to his sides afterward.
John has his sketch pad. It’s as if  John has read his mind. “Is this her?” John asks, flipping to a page and showing him.
Four hands uncover the top of the chest. Sherlock feels John’s eyes on him—  his doctor is checking, assessing, re-assessing while Sherlock does the same. Despite the gnawing pangs inside his gut, he feels remarkably calm. His mind alert. No sign of a headache.
He can hardly believe he’s here after all these years. He’s happy to share it with John. Over the last months, numerous cases Lestrade has shared with them have been eventful. John has continued with his blog and although Sherlock likes teasing John about his case entries, he dearly loves John’s romantic sentiments. He’s certain this adventure, or at least some part of it, will find its way into his blog.
At first John thinks Sherlock is making a joke about parts of him coming to attention, but then realizes he’s talking about the luger stuffed in his jeans.
John kept his head low the remainder of the lecture. A few students caught his eye to give him emphatic smiles and nods. With the professor's last word, he thrust his borrowed pen back at Molly and scrambled to get out of the lecture hall and away from all of those eyes.
"As I said, he is clever! I'm certain he told you that along with other sordid stories. He applied here because he knew I was offered this position over two years ago, but I turned it down. When I told him I was leaving and putting distance between us and accepted the position, he applied here. It was my mistake. I never should have told him."
“I'm to bed. Let me check you over once more. It’s getting late and both of us have another exciting day tomorrow."
“It was a spontaneous decision,” John explains. John bends down and puts away potatoes in the bottom of the cupboard.
It was brutally cold and I was shivering. When in survival mode, a person doesn't always question the whys and what-fors. But with Sherlock, it's necessary if you do want to survive until tomorrow to ask those very questions.
Mike lifts his hands in surrender. “I know a crusade when I see one.” He looks over at the sleeping man, then back at John. “Plus, then you get first crack at solving the mystery.”
“But you didn’t,” John says weakly. Did he read about the kiss on the cheek? Does Will remember? No need to embarrass each other. Will has enough going on in his life without adding complications.
He stopped in front of the massive double doors and stared into the eyes of the lion's -head knocker. It was roughly the size of the real thing.
I hear the tub draining, and John’s footfalls signal me to put on water for evening tea. As John comes into the kitchen, Rosie hangs from John’s hip, wrapped up snug in a soft-blue bath towel. Although still wet, her blonde curls are already springing to life. She’s chewing on her rubber duckie, then puckers up her lips and leans in for a kiss goodnight from me.
John’s lips are hard and soft and filled with contradictions. His mouth is slippery and slick and sweet as candy. His tongue is thick and powerful and relentless. It stabs and explores inside Sherlock’s mouth. The air is hot surrounding them. He needs to remove these clothes.
As John climbs down the companionway ladder, he surveys his new surroundings. So much better than the dark dungeon he was in. On the port side he walks through an adequate galley with a two-burner propane stove, what looks like a fridge lid, and a decent-sized sink with hand-pump. The galley is well-stocked. John digs around and finds canned goods in the bilge along with tins and jars. Not one can has a label. The contents of each ziplock baggie and rust-spotted can are hand-labeled in permanent marker. In French. Frustration ahoy!
“He,” she says, nodding in painful jerks at Sherlock, ”I begged him. In the end. He didn’t. Save her.”
“The whole meeting in the aquarium was staged to make sure they had plenty of reliable witnesses. They knew I would be right there … and you would come.”
Sherlock no longer nips at his lips. Instead, they slowly open and close, and John's eyes fix on one of the larger freckles on his top lip. It's so quiet in the cabin that he can hear each steady breath Sherlock takes as he leans down closer to him on the bed, his eyes on John's lips as well.
He spends the rest of the day walking along the vast beaches that surround this end of the lagoon where his ketch is moored along with some of its smaller inlets. This time he wears a hat and some sandals he's found. He takes them off to wade through the warm water, and realizes quickly that he'll need to keep track of the tides lest he be marooned away from the ketch by high water.
“I loved her.” Sherlock turns the key in his fingers as they both look at the chest between them. “I remember how she followed me and laughed and played and...I still do love her. I don’t care what she did. Even after all that they told me, all that I don’t remember, I love her.”
Lestrade begins laughing. “I love the description of his first meeting with you. Chasing you down...hanging by his fingertips. A sort of metaphor for your whole relationship, wouldn’t you say?”
“This reminds me of the first time we met. No hopping rooftops this time!” John says watching Sherlock's are from beneath as they climb.
Molly heads back to the morgue — the dead can wait, but apparently not all day — but John tugs Sherlock's sleeve to stop him from following.
“I see that you find Lestrade’s cold case files more to your liking.” John points at the coffee table.
Stuff that! He’s seen plenty of people meditate. His sister for one. It’s usually in a planned space, but yes, he remembers his sister saying she did it in other places, not always quiet. It’s odd where he does it. Not like he chooses the time or place. Yet, when he snaps out of it, Will is there with John immediately. No fog or confusion. He’s completely there. So it’s not a seizure or meditation as he knows it. He doesn’t take it up further with Will. Yet. He knows if it continues, he’ll have to address it. Again.
Will willingly allows John to examine him before sending him off to Molly for his first day in the morgue.
His bare feet feel cool against the wood on floor as he dresses. His hand grasps the railing as he races down the stairs and out the door. He pushes Sherlock’s number on his mobile for the third time.
Being present on Portobello Road at Mary's final dress fitting by the legendary Jane Bourvis isn't high on John's list of what constitutes a good time. Even if the lace is "hand-made antique." He'd frankly prefer a few pints at the corner pub. He should be happy that Sherlock is saving him from all this, but instead he's anxious to find out what is motivating Sherlock to do it in the first place.
“Before I begin to explain,” he said, “you need to clear your head of preconceptions you have about life and death. It’s not what you believe, Sherlock.”
The doctor is carefully cleaning where the infection has spread. The pain peaks and tips. I hear someone whimpering before I realize it's me—I'm the one sobbing pathetically.
John sat down hard in the desk chair. The enticing scent of pastrami made his stomach growl. He pushed the bag of sandwiches away to the other side of the desk.
"But you two have faced Moriarty together. What's one more assassin?" She sighs. "Well, Jim only gave orders. He may have had a mind like a trap, but he couldn't shoot a man off a moving yacht at over 900 yards."
He'd almost come back and scratched them out himself. He'd choked on the cigarette smoke as he reread the words, murmuring to himself, “Who the hell was the fool to even joke about that around here?”
Not long after, Sherlock looks up to see John stepping from the bath freshly shaved with a towel around his waist, empty mug in hand, skin and all golden and glorious. As John pours another mug, Sherlock checks the status of a blog he’s monitoring.
While Sherlock did his best to remain upright, James seemed to float over the ice. Of course he did; the man was made of it.
John’s body is a shambles, but he's all smiles and sighs and shaking limbs. He murmurs Sherlock’s name as his love collapses next to him. A moment later, Sherlock begins to gently untie the cords.
of sex he was thinking about that got him into trouble. The boys’ locker room, the Rest Area, his roommate. People got beat up and worse for what he did. He’d hoped to feel some sort of relief after letting go and giving in once again to what some call unnatural desires. Instead he felt like he was going to vomit. He couldn’t stop thinking: Did he look different? Are people staring at him and giving him the hairy eyeball? Could they tell “I’m John Watson, and I like it up the ass”? There! Someone was staring at him right now! Looking at him as if he was a freak! Did he have horns sticking out of his head?
The commotion brings John. At the top of the stairs, the door swings open, and John stands there in a checkered shirt and jeans, hands on his hips.
John pulls up to the curb. William hesitates to get out and show John where he’s been holed up for these few months. While impressing someone feels alien to him, he wants to impress John Watson. His legs feel rickety when he gets out and leads John inside. It might be John’s bad driving, or it might be he doesn’t want to be back here. They step over dumped dresser drawers, discarded clothing, and broken toys. Most furniture and any other objects of any worth were taken months ago. Wallpaper torn, carpet soiled with looters bootprints. A few old family photos hang on the walls. William knows the family’s story— he’s played it enough in his head. He straightens a photo. The mother was the first to get sick. Father’s notes and children’s lonely pictures litter the floor, all telling the story of the family that once laughed and played here. All gone. It’s one of the reasons William selected this home— it had no one to come back to it. It was just like him.
Marilyn held a piece of paper in her hand. She looked down, referring to it as though what it contained were especially complex.
It's a twisty-turning ride, and it takes far too long for the world to go dark. His pulse pounds in his temples, and his breathing feels erratic. He thinks that he might be having a reaction to whatever concoction they used on him. He hates the world, but he hates Irene Adler more.
It sure was a hike to get to the other side of the manor. As we went, she dutifully had us stop at each lavish portrait that lined the walls, told us who painted them and where each fell in the Frankenstein line as if she were a tourist guide and we the tourists.
My head shot up, but not before noticing the clotted hair next to the leg of the butcher block. I pointed to it.
Finalist were:  Badkatpat's Murder; Rosiepaw's Obsidian - "Sid" for short;  Humblegleeflower's Sigurson (Siggy for short), and Jobooksadcoffee's Mr. Hawkins
“Even if true a person loving one’s own brother is not defining characteristic or distinctive in anyway.”
And while he was playing the guitar, John was pretty certain that Sherlock had been actually flirting with him. No way he was sharing that with Molly. He didn't begin to know what to do with that tidbit.
He felt nauseous and tired and wondered why Mary’s dorm room smelled like men’s dirty socks, and why the fuck was she talking about Sherlock like he was some long-lost friend?
“I see you've been very busy,” she says. “And you’ve made yourself at home.” She stares at the collage of papers and notes pinned to the wall, surrounding a map of Cardiff. She steps closer and points to one of the many red circles drawn on the map linked neatly together in a chain. “And you know where Lord Blackwood is.” She pokes her finger at the circle with a star in the center.
“Whatever do you mean?” Sherlock picks up a framed photo of John’s mum, looks at the back, then sets it down, continues to roam around the living room picking up knicknacks and other objects, inspecting each, then setting them down one after another.
She turned around and faced John. She was about his height in her sneakers, and her blue eyes flickered in the moonlight.
“That’s what I said.” John tries his best not to give it away he covered up his little escape plan, but William already knows. He decides he may as well lay it all out for him. It might be a bit tricky. But...
Sherlock knew little about guitars, but he knew quality. John must have saved and worked hard for this one. The body was powder blue and the chrome on it polished. Sherlock eased the neck of the guitar up to put the capo and pick away in the small compartment that hid beneath.
"No, not an experiment. Please, John, talking lowers your core temperature. Come on now, get inside the box."
Molly gives a choked laugh. “Except you. She was avoiding you. I watched her. She ducked into a patient’s room when she saw you coming down the hall. It would have been funny if it wasn't so awful.”
“Anyone who could make it through my defenses was an advisory most formidable. Under usual circumstances, I knew I could take them, but not with heat approaching.”
Sherlock carefully slips his empty thermos into the small knapsack he carries for water and first-aid supplies. He always comes prepared on their excursions.
It was dark inside the cabin—only flickers from the fireplace illuminated the room, sending Sherlock’s long shadow across the pine planks of the floor. He moved the rocker closer to the fire, then walked over to the kitchen window where he stood watch. He frowned as he peered through the slats.
Sherlock can’t help smearing what's left of the ice cream around John’s arse. With a gasp, he pushes his cock completely into John until his thumbs are on each side at the root of his cock. He regains control, inhaling and exhaling slowly until he's centered, then pushes in and pulls out with purpose.
He sniffed along Sherlock’s neck. It was close enough for Sherlock to slip his hand inside and deftly snatch the remote from inside James’ suit coat.
“What about the other victims? It's been too warm to wear gloves for most of the month,” Molly asks.
Sherlock thrusts into him. Sweat slides down Sherlock's nose, his black curls wet on his forehead, his eyes trained on John's.
It seems John is just as distracted. Sherlock can’t forget last night, the couch. John clears his throat. "I need a shower," he says. He stand and walks into the bath and turns on the water. With his coffee.
“Mycroft did. Yesterday morning.” Sherlock knew Mycroft timed the visit to coincide with John's departure to hospital.
“Let me know if I’m going too fast or if it hurts.” He removes his hand, then slips it between his legs and slips his thumb to Sherlock’s pucker, then presses inside.
“You might not recall, but I do prefer calling or speaking in person, especially since there is much more to discuss. Now that you’ve cleaned this room proper, we can talk,” says Mycroft as he wipes off the kitchen chair with his hanky before sitting down.
Sherlock seems genuine—emphasis on the "seems." It's not a performance to influence or some sort of subterfuge for a case. But John notes that there is something behind his all-too-happy-to-please attitude that feels completely wrong. At times he'll catch a glimpse of the Sherlock he really knows when he thinks John doesn't see. He looks...sad. John is convinced Sherlock's heart isn't in it.
“Yes. There was an enormous amount of your blood at the scene. We feared they dumped your body into the bay. We searched.”
"Sometimes you need to keep the truth to yourself," he'd suggested. John decided that it was possible that his roommate was socially awkward and he was just being giant ass-wipe. Instead of acting grateful for the advice, Sherlock reacted like John had just insulted his mother and huffed off.
John shook his head. He didn’t ask why Sherlock would do it because he didn’t understand, he asked because he didn’t think Sherlock did it. Either he wasn’t dead or someone killed him. Sherlock didn’t jump. John didn’t believe that for a minute.
As those lips turn up at the corners, John loves him all the more. John drags a chair over next to Sherlock’s bed and takes a seat close to his head.
“You know I can’t do that! I need someone to play the game with me. Every boy does need some sort of toy. If you don’t want to, I can find another.” James pressed his finger to his lips. “Let me see, who shall it be? I spy with my little eye something compact.”
“He’s off to finagle food from Mrs. Hudson. Much like you do when you stop by,” Sherlock says. “Have you put on a stone or is that the disguise you’re wearing?”
“Why ever would I want to write as a ghost,” Sherlock huffs. “I’d be dead. How could an incorporeal being use a laptop?”
Stepping up behind him, John wondered how Sherlock could see anything through that abyss of darkness and whirling snow. He turned to watch Sherlock’s frown turn to a smirk.
“Well, this has all gone to shite,” he says, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. Not the homecoming he expected, but he berates himself for not expecting something like this. He hands the violin case to Mrs. Hudson.
“Mycroft, do shut up!” Sherlock turns and squints at Mycroft. “And it’s an elf hat. At least yours doesn’t light up!”
It was only later that he did find out something about his roommate he could appreciate. Those same long, large tapered fingers rolled a mean, fat old dooby. Sherlock fired the sucker up with his Bic, then passed it to John. Pretty primo pot, resin all sticky on John’s fingers and lips. Sherlock got a real good buzz too. His eyes turned red and, along with the green in them, reminded John of Christmas trees.
“And Geoff, who was not forthcoming with why he was here. Not that I didn’t know immediately, but at least the man followed protocol and came to get my statement.”
Sherlock puts on a detached face and grimly goes about the autopsy. Doctors cope in much the same way— it’s a natural protection mechanism.
“Carolyn told me Mary gave her mother the gun,” John says. “I still find it hard to believe. If that’s true, Mary would have checked the gun and seen that there were live rounds in it.”
"Yet you play 'patience.'" John sighed and turned the page. "I supposed you read this textbook in grade school."
But he loses his grip on the eaves and falls. When he twists as he lands, he feels his ankle pop. He’d sprained it much worse when jumping off a fire escape fleeing a rape gang. He bites back the sharp pain. Leaky blood vessels, fluid oozing into his soft tissue surrounding his joint...and it’s the same ankle, weakened by previous trauma.
Sherlock left Marilyn a note. He left it knowing that she would most likely shut us in here. Why did he let her do that?
John sits on the edge of the bed, hair sticking out, two days worth of stubble on his face, and eyes drowsy. Sherlock’s heart actually skips.
“It’s so hard to get things done in the limelight,” Mycroft bemoans. “It all went to Hell, when I became a public figure. It fell on me to run the country—  I’ve always preferred to work behind the scenes, pulling the metaphorical strings. As soon as I knew I could no longer hide behind a wall of anonymity, I had to seek other means to go about covertly.”
But inside his head the war raged on. He’d fought the battle over this craving to be with a man and now that he’d finally surrendered, what was he? Gay? Bisexual? He did like women, but … this whole not-a-relationship with Sherlock for example? It was new, and frankly, terrifying.
“These came for you special delivery.” Mrs. Hudson hands Sherlock a plain manilla envelope like it’s something she gets in the post every day.
"More water?" John asks in disgust as he looks at the glass Sherlock thrusts under his nose. Sherlock's hand trembles as he does it. "I think I've pissed at least enough to fill the lagoon."
He tells me little about his work there, but I deduce he has his hand in all aspects of the business. The ink on his hands reflects the administrative and clinical research and chemical stains, lab time. He also steps out in the evenings for walks, which I join him on. We’ve walked by his business on our way to Regent’s Park but have yet to tour through the business. He assures me, we will.
I wonder what my sister’s purpose was for the note. Is it advice? A warning? Or is this about my fall? I never questioned my choice to keep it from John, because I didn’t see. How could she see it, and he could not?
They find an old wooden cot and Sherlock tests it out, sitting on it and bouncing. John takes a seat next to him.
“I had to. I needed my meds.” He doesn’t say a word about Anthea. He knows she realizes he’s keeping something from her, but she probably thinks it has to do with John. He holds his head and hopes she thinks it’s just his headache that’s making him off.
Then John begins to take off his clothes. I sit and watch him unbutton his shirt, remove his undershirt, take down his jeans, and slip off his pants. No shame, no embarrassment. I can’t look away. He’s beautiful to me, my deepest fantasy. Faded tan and freckles from the sun define his chest, and the fine golden hairs shimmer. The scar on his shoulder is a badge of honor to me.
They’re back inside the apartment when John turns to Sherlock and asks him what he half suspects. “You really don’t have one, do you? A real plan?”
The rest of way to Paddington, John worries, but not so much. He knows where Sherlock will go. A place where no one but John kind find him.
. She is asleep on the last page. I tuck the blankets under her chin, kiss her forehead, then decide to look over a few cases Lestrade gave me.
Sherlock smirks at John’s bad pun. Tuna is on the menu again. Blackbeard is happy. So is Sherlock as John comes in for another kiss. He gasps as John fills his open-mouth with his tongue. He thinks of his note in his pocket. What he might lose.
John’s eyes fly open. “I wouldn’t go that far. What kind of line of questioning is this?” he asks, then chooses to ignore her by turning his head toward the window and watch the countryside.
“I am surprised at the extent of what you’ve shared with me. Our family is tightfisted with such research, always concerned that some other lab will get the edge.”
John winces and looks away from his fellow widower. Ever since the plague it’s considered fairly crude to make remarks about anyone's family, but people who run cities don't have to think about such things, he supposes. "Well."
“I’m taking advantage! You have a brain injury!” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You are not taking advantage. Despite my injury, I do understand what I’m doing.”
After the funeral, I hardly left the flat. It was fourteen days, five hours and twenty-three minutes since John died instead of me when I finally had the courage to visit John’s grave again.
Better to hide. John kept his head down, his neck tucked, and eyes on his feet the rest of the way to his work-study program.
James tapped his temple. “You see him, but your puny mind can’t comprehend what he is, what I am, and what we are together. Our genius combined, more than a sum of our parts.”
horrific. Not to me. In the vision, I’m... excited, inspired. I circle around and around the body, inspecting it and the room. The locked room.”
The lagoon is spectacular, and it's easy to lose track of the time. The sun is high, the sand is blindingly white, and the aquamarine water has emerald green patches like glass. John can vividly see the life beneath. He wishes he knew the names of the colorful fish. He had little time to appreciate them on his little trip in from the freighter.
Aw, yes, now I remember him. He is my captor, and I, only tender for him to lend and spend. He's yanking my head, twisting it around like a cruel child would to as he or she removes a doll's head.
He sighs. No, he's not that sorry he's being left out. He decides he should make the best of it until Mary reels him in again to pick out the right complimentary colors for the corsages or ask him if they should have monogramed biscuits for favors. He shudders just thinking of it.
Magic doctor hands slip down his arse. Sherlock’s breath hitches in anticipation. They thrust together. It’s perfection. John gasps and clenches.
Then he sees the confirmation that she’s within the third building. A lighter flickers. A man lighting a cigarette, but the repeat one, two, three flicks count out in three-quarter time.
When I replied I’d clean them, she rolled her eyes and climbed off the chair, immediately foisting the window cleaner and a chamois into my hands. After, she crossed her arms and tapped her toe, expecting me to begin.
"He still has not regained consciousness. You are right that my brother owed your father a debt. He felt that you should know this even though in a few minutes you will remember none of it. He'll send you a written report tomorrow, with instructions to place it on your bedside table where you'll discover it regularly."
He'd missed getting his heart racing. A motor service station where perverts got off seemed the answer. Just the sort of thing Sherlock missed. Excitement! Although in all likelihood, the only real peril was possible arrest or getting beaten senseless by some local, either for money or for fun. At least he'd get some sex. Not as good as investigating a murder, but it'd do in a pinch.
He likes him, and that’s more than he can say about most people he’s met thus far. John is intelligent and compassionate. He’s rather ordinary looking in extraordinary ways. It's possible, though, that his attraction to John is in fact Will's strong preference for living in a perfect flat with an interesting person rather than an attic by himself.  He decides he needs more data: more observations of John, and of his reactions to John.
It was not knowing a soul that bugged him most. John always had had a lot of friends. Here, he'd had to start over. Sherlock didn't seem like someone who had many. As John had wandered the university yesterday, he’d observed the self-assured way upperclassman moved about. John watched as groups met for the first time after the long summer break—guys back-slapping, girls jumping into waiting arms. He wondered if next year that’s what his life would be like.
John had come to the conclusion that even though dorm rooms sucked, being in a freshman dorm sucked more.
The black iron stairs echo as John and Sherlock step down. They take a short stone path that leads to the greenhouse. The door is latched, and Sherlock carefully inspects it and the white paint-chipped door before opening. They step into the oppressive heat into a protective vestibule between the outside and inside of the hothouse.
As soon as I start the task of washing the windows, John helps. It’s most distracting. His biceps and triceps flex. He’s toned in ways that make me ache to see what’s beneath the stretch of the thin blue T-shirt he’s wearing. And the way his arse wiggles in his jeans when he’s reaching up high makes me face the opposite direction so that John doesn’t notice I’ve taken a particular interest in his work.
He doesn’t usually smoke but considering he’s on edge over tonight and all the possible implications and possibilities with John, he needs it. His heart pounds thinking of it without the nicotine, but at least his hands calm. He’s still concerned about the planned sting for Ms. Kratides, but focusing on what will John and he do tonight becomes his new obsession. Will it be more kissing, touching and mutual wanks or more? Oral sex or sexual intercourse? So many possibilities.
John ignores Sherlock, turning to Mycroft. “How do you propose we do all that you suggested?” John asks.
“Before I feed you both,” John says, spatula in hand and holding out the pan of scrambled eggs like an offering, “tell me this secret plan. All of it.”
“Actually we were talking about Molly. How is she coming on your automail. I trust it’s up to your expectations.”
The messages are all from Sherlock, wondering where he is, why he’s not answering. The bloody git! He’s concerned. John knew it! He really didn’t want to leave.
“And that would last but for a few years, then he would have returned and taken up the chase, wouldn’t you, Sherlock? Not that I mind the chase, but you’re forever in my business.” James looked again at John. “He’s obsessed with me,” he said conspiratorially.
“I don’t recall how I felt about it, but I do know this is one I intend to win. I have an idea, John.” Sherlock flips the buttons in his hand.
After his experience with Sherlock with his big joint and his hand on his knee, he had decided to hide out in his room.
Later that morning, as they watch Palmyra grow smaller behind them, John and Sherlock throw the bottle out into the ocean.
“I understand," says the doctor, "but I need to get you to some sterile conditions, and that’s not here.” The doctor turns his attention to Rodrick. "Go fetch your master, and be quick about it!"
“In my quest to procure rare elements, I often had to go in disguise. It would not be wise to come as the one of the heirs to a pharmaceutical empire since I often met with felonious and nefarious persons along the way. I also look incredible in tights.”
He needs more, and he knows where to look. It’s an invitation to a new game— he read between the lines in the folders as Sophy Kratides intended. Where does she keep them?
It’s then he notices the smell is all wrong. Burned plastic, tar, wood, and flesh. The buildings are all wrong too. He recognizes the cobbled concrete wall on his left that separates the road from the old Branch Line tracks and the charred rubble of low-rise apartments and alleys on the right. He should have been watching. “You need to turn around.”  Somehow they’ve ended up in Butetown. “Now.”
“Sometimes a feeling is all we have,” she says. “You look like you need to lie down and rest. I’ll get you our safe house soon. I’ll have my driver come back for your things tomorrow.”
John ran his hands through his hair in anger and frustration. Sherlock carefully took a seat in the desk chair, facing John. He could see the pulse throbbing in John's neck and how John took a deep breath to regain control before he began talking again.
"So, it's the whole knowledge is power thing you've got going on? So, you know I talked with Moriarty, but not what we said, and now you're calling because you can't stand not knowing what happened."
“You did well in the morgue today,” John says, trying to start some discussion, but Will just grunts in return. He’s about ready to give up when Will finally looks up from his map.
I wake to exhaust fumes and cramped darkness and a monster headache. I am no longer in the backseat but stuffed in a boot. Not the same vehicle. The tiny compartment is too small for a sedan. I’ve had enough time spent in boots to last a lifetime. Not only is it boring, but it’s damn uncomfortable.
“There are many forms of extraordinary,” Mycroft says, and John wants to pound his face until it’s a bloody mess. “Common does not necessarily mean one is unintelligent. You know that, doctor.”
. Not a call for help or asking to borrow a pen. Not checking to see if roommate were okay. No. He drew out his name like it was a song. A siren's call.
“We thoroughly investigated any party who came in contact with her,” Mycroft answers. “All tapes were sifted through meticulously, second by second. No person was thought untouched by her; even those who never directly spoke to her were suspect. My people investigated and deprogrammed any person who was touched by Eurus or by proxy. We were meticulous.”
Clothes didn't confirm a thing, but what was beneath them did. The most damning single piece of evidence was Watson's legs. Although Sherlock had not seen the same cut of jeans or t-shirt that the man at the sink had worn that day, the clothing had afforded Sherlock a good look the shape of the man's legs and his tanned arms.
John wasn’t sure how prepared he was for living this closely-packed. Months ago, John’s parents had insisted that he not be in a coed dormitory. John wanted to be in a coed: he had no problem with girls around. He put up a fight—just on principle—but in the end, they were footing the bill so here he was in a dorm packed with hundreds of male bodies, nuts to butts. The bathroom situation was the worst; his whole floor shared this single communal bathroom. John’s first impression was walking into a wall of steam filled with five sweaty, hot guys in various stages of undress. John took a piss, then ducked out as quickly as he could. How was he going to make it through this? It was worse than high school gym class.
He never followed them. Instead, he'd imagine what seamy acts they were committing: who was on their knees? Who was taking it up the ass? What makes a man come to this place for sex? But John knew why. He just wasn't brave enough to be one of them. Yet.
But Greg doesn’t know that. Sherlock crosses his arm, stares down Greg, then Sherlock raises an eyebrow and smirks like the cat that ate the canary. Does he actually think that Greg has interest in John? That Sherlock needs to mark his territory?
“Let’s hope they are Anthea’s. I can only shoot so many people at a time.” John gives a pained smile. “It’s good we’re almost home.” At least there’s that. He so much wanted to be home.
“I guess I need to start with Afghanistan.” He wipes his face with his hands and sits  down at the table. “At the time I attributed what happened to me to a combination of trauma and morphine. But it wasn’t. I died there, Sherlock. But it wasn’t my time, so they brought me back.”
“Ta, I believe that’s it,” John says as he pays the driver. He watches for a moment as the cab drives off.
I usually hate it when people repeat what I’ve said, but those two words from John’s lips, I would listen to over and over. I hope it’s in some way an answer.
His sandy hair looks common, yet upon inspection William notes the pigmentation of hair follicles more eumelanin making it lighter, yet contains pheomelanin with darker hairs mixed with achromotrichia or grey hairs. Like grains of sand, the colors vary from dark to light. He is unable to ascertain the number of different hair colors John possesses. He decides he must inspect them closer when given the chance.
“What about Beca Bellin? Even if she is the most unconventional hospital director that ever was, she should know. She paid for the cameras in the locker room— even though I wondered if it had more to do with her seeing a few of the younger docs starkers. You probably should tell her. I wouldn’t be surprised if she didn’t already know. After you got her all riled up to solve the thefts. Said they were…” Mike makes air quotes. “‘
In that moment John realizes that it’s possible that Anthea may have been in love with Mycroft. It’s the first time he’s seen this intensity, this powerful concern from her. She bites her lip before she continues. “With both of her sons missing, and all this horrible gossip, I thought it would kill Mrs. Holmes, but when we found out Sherlock was alive, she had hope again. I know you are not one-hundred percent convinced, but I assure you, after meeting Mrs. Holmes, you will be.”
John finds Anderson and asks him to take him home. On the ride back, he watches out the window at the empty Cardiff streets and can’t let it go—  he knew this was going to happen! Sherlock would remember, and it would change everything. Sherlock just sent him home. He shouldn’t have gone. He never projected this outcome: He didn’t think Sherlock would hate himself so much that he couldn’t let John love him.
John was beginning to understand Sherlock's intense dislike for his brother. He was a nosey, arrogant bastard.
"And what did James have to say today to you?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow, as he unwrapped the sandwich, then licked dressing off that had dripped onto his fingers.
The next morning Sherlock takes his time before meeting Sophy. As he sits in the dining room with his morning coffee, she comes in to join him dressed is camel ruched-sleeve blazer and brown slim-leg trousers. She takes no time at all to jump in headfirst.
Sherlock tries to open his mouth to answer. He thinks he has it. John turns grabs Beca’s arms. Even through the dark tunnel, Sherlock sees John’s anger, John’s rage. He shakes her so hard that her head snaps back and whips forward over and over until Lestrade stops him from rattling her brains out.
Two mammoth hands, reaching out, encasing his. He was gorgeous. Tall, lean. Strong features, sharp cheekbones. He was handsome in an odd sort of way. And he was British.
In the black, I know he’s there. It’s John. It’s his surgeon's hands that strip off my coat, and his captain's arms that grip me to raise me. We break through the surface. Glorious air. I gasp and choke.
“Before we get started here,” John said, “I really should talk to either Sebastian Moran or James Moriarty.”
He opened the mail box to find the Consumer’s Power bill, a postcard reminder from Dr. Tom the dentist reminding his mom of her February appointment, and a letter from Publisher’s Clearing House stating: “You may already be a winner.”
“You forgot to take your meds, didn’t you? Your pupils are dilated.” John knows Art is a paramedic and a good one. John gets his attention. “Sherlock needs to be looked after as well. I’d appreciate it if you’d check his vitals.”
"Why should we ever do what Mycroft wants and follow his direction in another one of his envelopes? Maybe we should never leave this island. Serve him right. We should make this sex holiday permanent," Sherlock grouses as he sits on their bed. He's holding a heaping bowl of
"It’s damaged, but repairable," he reassures me in a calm voice. "At least that’s what Molly, our restorative implant specialist, assured me. She’s repurposing it.”
Sherlock really doesn’t need young Mycroft’s map to locate the key landmark where they must start, a large red sandstone shaped in his child’s mind like a dog.
One day she’d asked me to bring in something simple, with pictures. I went to the corner bookstore. “Here. I bought two comic books and a mango,” I had said, and she’d laughed and told me it’s Manga.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but remained silent, waiting for his brother to continue. Sherlock noted how John monitored the phone call with an ear obviously to the conversation. John continued to look up and down from his book to Sherlock with unabashed interest.
When they reach Cardiff Memorial, Sherlock thinks he’s well enough to stand and walk, but Art refuses to let him. John appreciates how Art is as stubborn as Sherlock.
The pen kept its tap, tap, tapping. John found he couldn’t blink as he watched it. A Bic pen. Blue ink.
"Poor Brutus," she said, her voice flat. She blinked. Again, she didn't seem nearly distraught enough for what she was describing. At all. I studied her closer for signs of shock. Her pupils were normal, breathing appeared regular, and I saw no pallor or sheen of cold sweat.
Big, fat flakes began floating down. They clung to his lashes and hair. His first real Michigan snowfall, and John wasn’t here.
“Good. That's good. And as much as this is the season for giving, I must say that I like to be on the receiving end,” John says.
He turns to Anthea. “You said before that Sherlock was safe as long as he doesn’t remember. What exactly does Sophy Kratides
Later that evening after way too much roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and brussel sprouts, they move to the living room to relax and talk— or the Holmes’ version of it.
“Mary didn’t have to worry about that since Eurus told us to only see the blood and Mary’s face. All that blood. It’s never like that when someone’s shot, but we ignored that.”
Over the next few days, I feel stronger. I call him John now, and he calls me Sherlock. I feel a strange connection to him. The infection has abated and my fever only shows itself in the evenings, and even then it's low-grade. I am getting out of bed and exploring the doctor's residence at 221B Baker Street along with his adjoining office at 221C. Trice daily I complete John’s prescription: a series of push ups and triceps dips to prevent atrophy in the adjoining muscles where my automail will be attached.
“Mrs. Hudson has gone out but will be back shortly, and her Mr. Lewis Gilbert stopped by. He thought you’d like some company for a bit, Sherlock. He suggested that maybe you and he could share a cuppa,” John winks, then speaks loudly to Mycroft, as if he’s half-deaf. “How’s your lumbar feeling today, Mr. Gilbert?”
"If it comes up, sure, but finding out if he knew the wife and where he was at time of the Earl's death is more the thing."
“All scrubs, only scrubs,” Williams says. “Which is advantageous since that’s what I’ll need to wear at my new job.”
Sherlock removes his coat, then searches the room as he did before, inspecting under and behind lamps, tables, picture frames.
And a big hug and thanks to recently_folded, my superb beta, who never stops or gives up reminding me to show not tell and add character voice through their narration.
He slides back inside. Both are sweaty, skin wet pressed chest to chest. Sherlock's eyes are like fire as he drops his head to lick across the scar on John's shoulder. He raises up and thrusts his hips as his eyes burn with intensity. John gasps.
His gaze takes in the island that lies before him. It must be miles and miles long, he realizes. The water grades from a shocking aqua to pale blue, almost white, where it turns shallow at the shore. It shimmers and sparkles. He can see occasional bright, silver flashes beneath the water—probably fish swimming but moving too quickly to be sure. The anchor chain arcs out ahead to where it lies partly buried in the sandy bottom. Otherwise the bottom looks dark with some sort of grassy plants. It's like a completely different world. Even the birds don't sound or look the same as anything he's ever known.
Moriarty stood back up, brushing off his trousers. His eyes never left the body as he circled it. Both kept an ear toward Lestrade as he talked to the boy who had been the one to discover the woman's body—or what was left of it. The lad had mistaken the corpse for a tossed-out mannequin until he'd stepped closer. Lestrade had taken him aside to calm him.
“I am so, so sorry. Really I am. The donations your brother Mycroft made were so generous, those of your wealthy following padded my pockets nicely, but not enough to make up for what  you’ve cost me on the streets. I was thinking of quitting my day job until you and John Watson decided to become such good ‘mates.’ I thought you might be around. But I never dreamed you walk right through my office door.”
“I think everyone who meets you knows you don’t like them, but you don’t belong out in the streets even if you are good at nicking people’s pockets and stealing from vendors. And this would also keep you close to hospital, give you access to medical treatment that’s needed. Molly suggested you start in the morgue.” He’s almost certain William is going to say no, instead, the man bursts out in deep, rich laughter. He hasn’t see William do that much. At all, actually.
The man’s computer screen is up and on, and while not visible, Sherlock can see its reflection in the man’s glasses.
“How was the show?” James asked, spinning around. “I haven’t seen it, but I do love Warren Beatty. He’s a handsome devil.”
By senior year he'd gotten up the nerve to pull in later at night. He'd sit in his car. Sometimes he'd get out. He'd stand under the bright vapor lights and pretend to look at the map. He'd watch men get out of their vehicles and wander off behind the darkened building.
"One point I don't get is that she said when we first got here that her father had contacted Mycroft."
"It has always been my goal to perform as deftly as I play violin. Both are much like languages but instead of our mouths, we use the hands. You understand. It's the same with your guitar when you run through your blues progression."
“Breathe out, please,” Thomas instructs. She does, and her eyes flutter shut in pain as Thomas tapes up the wound.
“I don’t mean you personally,” Mycroft says, exasperated with them both. “What does makes one person ordinary and another extraordinary? Is it mappable?”
“We’d ruled drug use out since tissue samples came back clean, but Will tested his hair! Heavy opiate use until two months ago! Took him all morning what with the old equipment we have here, but now that there's two of us, we have the time.”
“You won’t win, Mycroft,” she whispers. “Say goodbye, to your little brother...” but with her last word, she falls forward as John yanks her ankles and drags her down to the floor. The shot echoes inside the warehouse, and with it more gunfire comes from behind. Sophy’s Glock clatters to the floor and blood blossom’s across her chest and oozes out onto the concrete floor.
Mike is more shocked than Sherlock. “Yer giving Sherlock a rose? And I don’t get one?!” Mike hangs his head in mock despair. “I'm heart broken! You’ve known me longer!”
John tosses them at Sherlock, who snatches them out of the air, holds them taut between his hands, then crack! snaps them together.
Luckily or unluckily for me, I still hold a modicum of value in his eyes. If I didn't, my heats would be forced. I'd be given heinous black market drugs, then auctioned off to the highest bidder. I was able to stave off such actions from my keeper through a bit of fast talk along with a few hand and blow jobs. But the threat of having a forced heat thrust upon me and used by a waiting line of alphas, made my stomach turn. Such is the life of an omega without means in these times.
John read somewhere that men think about sex every seven seconds. He really should look it up to see if it was really true. When he goes home to Grass Lake for a visit, he could sneak a peek to find the answer in that Kinsey Report book his mom has, except the thought of his mom reading about sex out of the same book creeped him out.
“Most people are what you call ‘rubbish’ at keeping secrets, let alone hiding them. It would be next to impossible for the average individual not give away the ruse. No one in his family
?” the woman says. She dresses with extreme care: hair coiffed neatly, nails recently trimmed and painted, her makeup understated. She places the cell in her hand under the counter in an effort to appear as if it’s remove the distraction, but really it’s from observer’s eyes.
At times I wonder if he didn’t pull back to save himself. I hurt him terribly when I faked my death. He blamed me for Mary’s death. Maybe he knew exactly what he was doing by protecting his heart.
“Don’t you worry, Mrs. Hudson, I know where he is,” he reassures her. “And I’m going to find him— just need to get a few things upstairs.” John starts up the stairs, but turns to her after two steps. “If anyone comes looking for me, you haven’t seen me.”
“I suppose you are whatever Gotham wants you to be,” is Mycroft’s only acknowledgement. He looks at me. “She is secured.”
John tries his best not to tug too hard on his bindings, but this is driving him around the bend. Sherlock continues by going back up to his cock and running the edges of his teeth gently over the tip. John does his best not to giggle, but can’t suppress it.
Sherlock stands in the horrid lighting of Lestrade’s office. Although Lestrade knows Sherlock has come here to expose a good many of his men, Lestrade would rather discuss John’s blog.
My words conjure nothing. No Alphons, no mother. Instead, the floor opens up and swallows me. I fall, spinning round and round down into the abyss.
John continued to hold his hand under the cool for three minutes before taking it out and checking it again. “Doesn’t look like it’s going to blister,” John observed, returning his under the cool water. “A couple of more minutes. It will hurt like a bitch for a bit, and it might be a few days before you’ll be playing that violin again, but it’s only a first degree burn.”
“Oi! Will?” He blinks awake into the real world with John shaking his shoulder. “You okay?” The doctor stares into his eyes and frowns. “Might be a form of seizure.”
Of course Sherlock, make me reimagine the plot for the rest of the story! Next chapter may take a bit longer...
"You're a fine dance instructor. When did you learn to dance?" John asks. They bump the kitchen counter but continue.
John smiles broad and clasps Sherlock’s hand that’s just above his head on the pillow. They both fall asleep wound up together.
“I think I’m staying for a bit. Would you look in on Mrs. H. for me, though? I texted her, but, you know. Doesn’t hurt to have a look-in as well. Oh — she may be next door, Chippie said she could come over if she saw anything dodgy.”
Sherlock only caught bits and phrases from them after that such as “he means well” and “he’s clueless” and “lovable arse.” Then they giggle. And point. At him. He doesn’t recall Anthea ever smiling at all before this.
"Moran has no criminal record, not even a minor traffic violation. Until only recently, he was a British Army officer with a blemish-free military record, attaining the rank of colonel. His superiors thought he would become career, but he left after his current tour. He was in many delicate operations, most notably, in Northern Ireland. The files
As he wiped up the coffee, he gave me more evidence: private conversations and close calls. It was our night at Angelos that made me believe—all we said and didn’t say sealed it for me.
At least they let me up topside now, even though I've threatened to jump overboard on more than one occasion. Why should I let them have all the fun?
The woman stops. Shoulders tighten, hands stretch and fingers spread at her sides. Those hands. He’s seen them. John realizes that Mrs. Roberts was right this time about her clothes going missing.
I wait for him to help me get my trousers over the cast. He kneels down in front me, tenderly slipping them over my foot. He looks up into my face. He begins to wrap my cast, making it water-tight.
Sherlock thrusts his coat into John’s arms, then kneels down to look under the benches. “It serves a purpose. Think John! In Lord Blackwood’s case, his death settled some sort score with her.”
“This place is drab, dull, and the company equally so,” he says darkly, eyeing the two new folders she holds at her side.
“Not much to do here. We could read, talk, listen music, play Cluedo before we go to bed if you’d like. I’m a bit keyed up from earlier.”
His brain is muddled. He can’t think. He needs rest. Time to think about all he’s learned. There’s Mycroft. Could he be alive? He must find out! But he can’t let Helena know. There’s no doubt in his mind that Helena Smith is trying to confuse him. Taint him. It’s working, in fact. He opens the pill bottle and swallows two down, then pockets the rest. He expects Helena to be here quickly.
Our last conversation was about why I enjoy dancing, her last question, “Would you teach me?” Her last word, “Goodbye.” Since, she has not spoken.
He began to leave. Stopped. He continued to face the door as he spoke. “Oh, one more tiny thing? You know that heart? The one you think you don’t have? It’s there, and I’m going to burn it out of you.”
For this story, I needed to dig into research on the subject done during the 1970s. I was surprised how much there was. I strive to keep this story as historically accurate as possible. The study that John is asked to conduct with Mary is based on a composit of studies and my own imagination. I do have some background in sociological theory (yeah, I hear that it’s not a “real” science all the time) and conducted a few studies in college, but that’s my extent of knowledge.
Sherlock hears Sophy’s voice echo from the living area. She’s talking on her cell. He listens for a moment. “We are agreed then,” she says. “Fine.” Then disconnects. “Ross?!” she calls. He spins too quickly into the shadows and feels the familiar heat from a torn ligament, the joint throbs angrily.
On almost every summer weekend during those early years, his dad would play baseball with John in the back yard. They'd take turns hitting and pitching. John's hands got sweaty and nervous, but he'd swing the bat as hard as he could, partly just to please his dad.
Lestrade takes a sip of his coffee. "This is bloody awful!” he says, closing his eyes for another sip. “To your question of whether you have a murderer in your hospital, Doctor Watson, I don't have anything definitive to rule him out. He might have predicted what we'd find because he had a part in the deed in the first place. I'm not done with him yet, and I suggest you keep a fairly close eye on him. A few years ago I'd have an officer guarding him, but we're a bit short-staffed."
“I’ll have Simon take your bags to your room,” she says, and turns to John, hugging him with almost the same enthusiasm. “Thank you for bringing my sons home to me.”
“Why not just give in and come and play with me?” James asked. He cracked his gum, then bumped Sherlock’s shoulder to his.
"Stance, tone of voice, and you continue to wear your hair with the short side part, but it’s how you tuck the bedsheets under military style that gave it away.”
He turns to Sherlock. “If you should remember anything essential to Pandora, you may reach me through Anthea.”
"I wasn't certain how you would take it—or if you'd believe me." Sherlock believed he had told John just enough to keep him from certain harm.
Mom would still plant petunias and marigolds. Three weeks later after his dad was finally fired, John thought that one good thing might follow from it: his father couldn't afford to go to John's Tavern.
My ankles are tied and my arms are in front of me, tied at the wrist. I test the rope. Nylon. I can’t move around enough to even try to pop the boot open, but I can shift around enough so I work to loosen the rope. I squirm and twist. Though much contortion I squeeze myself so that I can feel my mobile pressed into my hip under me with my hands relatively able to reach into my coat. My thumbs do the work as I send off a message to John just in case I can’t free myself. My captors are idiots, but Norbury is also a zealot. I’ve learned that stupid zealots are often unpredicably violent.
“And to know where to send the bill. I can tell you that I have no memory prior to two years ago. When can I leave?”
“As an elderly gentleman caller,” Sherlock says, simply. “For Mrs. Hudson.” With a stodgy mustache, fringe of grey hair, wizened face, gainly walk, and a too-large coat, Mycroft held no resemblance to the the man they were introduced to just days before.
John takes one look at him, and throws his head back and rolls his eyes. “Your mum is going to kill you,” he growls.
With trepidation, Sherlock stepped behind James inside and the lights flipped on overhead, one-by-one. James always had a flare for the dramatic. Relief filled him to see that John wasn’t floating in the water.
“You know my proposal. You’ll work for me. Make our little addictive additive. I think it’s a bit ironic? You the reformed addict creating a substance to addict the world! And you’ll be married to your work. My lab awaits you.”
“You can’t blame yourself for that, and I’ll never blame you for it. It was never your fault. I think about Mary or your sister. I could hate them, but what good would that do? They punished themselves. Mary’s plan to leave me ended her. I’ve thought a lot about it—what Eurus did to us. I tried to reach inside myself to understand why. What drives someone to do what she did? Then it suddenly occurred to me: it wasn’t an experiment. It was Eurus’ quest to discover emotion.”
Sherlock has no interest in other entanglements John has had on this bed. “It’s been sometime though I see. The magazine has been put to good use.”
“I don’t know who you’re talking about. I don’t remember any game or any one named Moriarty. I do know this folder contains nothing of interest to me. It does nothing to cure my boredom or return my memory. In fact, I’m more bored after reading
"John," he says. "Your pulse. Your heart. We have to stop. What if you went into ventricular fibrillation? I haven't sailed in years, but if I must, I can. I can get you help."
“It's not for you to be sorry about. It took a long time and therapy for me to realize that it wasn’t PTSD that I had— I just missed the war.
But when he had no other reason to, Moriarty couldn't resist wooing others. He complimented Lestrade's diplomacy with Anderson, his patience with the young lad. He even admired Lestrade's hair, which made Lestrade blush and Sherlock jealous.
Sherlock gave John a leg up, which pushed the snow out and inside the door, making a way for Sherlock.
He’d also looked for signs of Mycroft’s men. It seemed they were spying on him from a distance. He’d found no tracks in the snow anywhere near the cabin.
John nods weakly. With his right hand free, he flexes his fingers and brushes them against Sherlock’s cheek.
A new loud thud came from beneath the old floor planks with enough force to rattle the pans hanging on the kitchen wall above the stove.
Sherlock’s breath quickens, his jaw drops. How did he ever become so attached so fast? It’s all sentiment. Not love. His hands begin to shake, and he shoves them into his coat.
"Easy. Close your eyes when you inhale! It's best to smoke in a well-ventilated environment. I keep a small mist bottle of sodium citrate diluted in water and spray it on myself from time to time. It was a trick Mycroft and I used to mask cigarette smoke from our mum. Here …”
“Associate professor Moriarty gave me these for us to review,” she pointed to the folders stacked on the desk in front of her. “I was just reading them. You know what? I have an idea … instead of that cramped office, you could camp out here, and we could go over them together? It gets boring at the desk. Not much for me to do except twiddle my thumbs.”
“Yes, yes. The Queen’s Arms.” He started reading the file again. Twenty minutes later, he texted Lestrade.
“How long is the Miss Havisham act going to last?” she’d asked during his last visit. “You’ve turned grieving into a high art form. You’ll never get laid again, you big baby.”
Moriarty had enjoyed being the star of his own show. After the old woman was killed in the bomb blast, John had angrily shouted at Sherlock that he and Moriarty were two sides of the same coin. He wasn’t far wrong, was he? If John knew the things Sherlock had done during those two years away . . .
She smiled the smile she reserved for elderly ladies and babies. More forced than friendly. “I’ve not been here before. Just arrived in London yesterday.”
Out on the street is looking like a front runner. “Not much of a victory though. It was a shite case.”
John took the tray from her, biting back a smile. “That’s very kind. Thank you. I hope we didn’t wake you.” He set the tray on the table beside his chair.
Sherlock wrapped the scarf around his neck and shrugged into his coat. “Text me the address of David Sutton.”
He dragged the covers off the floor, and twisted himself up in them, squeezing his eyes shut as tight as he could. He felt a fool for believing any of it had been real until the door flew open and John walked through the door, a cup of steaming tea in one hand, a newspaper in the other. The dog jumped off the bed and disappeared through the open door.
He brought two glasses back from the bar and set them on the table. Greg sat and stared over her head at the soccer game playing on the TV in the corner. She stared into her glass and said nothing. After a few minutes, the scotch began to warm the places that Mycroft Holmes had turned cold. Greg was right – she would never have enough evidence to prove Anna Ashcroft had anything to do with Goodale’s murder. She should take what Sherlock had offered – the evidence of the wire transfers – and go home. Clearing the high profile murder of an MP would finally get her that transfer to Toronto. Plus a commendation from the PM, most likely. What was wrong with that? She swallowed the rest of the scotch and made a decision.
“Really, Mr. Holmes, your reputation seems a bit overblown. You come into my home, accuse me of attempted murder. If anyone is guilty of murder here, it’s John Watson.”
John sat for a moment, trying to make his heart slow down. Trying to take all the ridiculous pieces of information swirling around his head and put them in some kind of rational order that he could understand. That he could accept. He wished he had Sherlock’s mind palace. Because it was all too much. He could feel himself shutting down. But then a lone thought flashed across his brain in neon colors. And it changed everything.
John said, “This is Sarah,” and you could see past the smile to her hand on John’s back, her fingers closing possessively in his shirt and your chest tightened because if there was one thing you knew as well as anything, it was what a person looked like when they were mad for John Watson.
“Bollocks.” John grabbed his hand. “Can you just stop for a minute? I can’t do this like . . . this.”
Sherlock grabbed a pillow and curled himself around it. Kate stood watching, not quite sure of her role in this little domestic drama.
In the elevator, John leaned back against the wall. He looked exhausted. “I can’t believe we’re back here. He was finally getting better.”
“Once in a while you are allowed to miss a detail. And once in a very great while, I am allowed to figure something out. Balance of probability, right? Isn’t that what you always say?”
John ignored her and set the kit on the coffee table, opened it and busied himself with unwinding gauze and ripping pieces of tape. Kate saw that his hands were trembling and she knew they were as far from okay as possible.
He was grateful for the washing up. It gave him a chance to think about something besides the soap opera that passed for his life lately. If Kate had accomplished nothing else, she’d made him see how completely fucked up it all was. He’d been pretending – to himself, to Mary, to Sherlock, that they could continue living in this bubble indefinitely. He needed to make a decision.
Her phone vibrated and she looked down. A text from Chloe.Perfect timing. She didn’t read it and turned back to Mrs. Hudson, who was smiling at her.
“You came back,” Sherlock said quietly. “I estimated the probability of that outcome at less than 30%.”
John handed him the laptop when he was done and for a while, the sound of Sherlock working while he tidied the kitchen made things seem almost normal.
Sherlock brushed the hand away. “I am fine. I just need to focus.” He coughed several times, one palm pressed flat against his chest.
She lay in the dark, mentally planning the next day’s interview with Sherlock. She’d start with Anna Ashcroft – see if Sherlock had really recognized her name or if the drugs had made him loopy. She had several pictures of her on the laptop she could show Sherlock including a few graduation photos from the University of Ottawa. Not that she expected him to recognize her – she’d disappeared more than ten years earlier – and she wasn’t particularly memorable, just attractive in an ordinary sort of way like Mary.
“Good. I read John Watson’s blog last night and Holmes seems kind of –” She wanted to say “crazy”, but settled on “eccentric.”
He didn’t expect to be happy. Or content. Or God forbid, fulfilled. He only hoped not to be desperately
He heard the water stop and he stood, smoothing out his rumpled suit, the wilting rose tumbling to the floor. He faced the door and waited.
He stood in the front garden of the cottage and whistled for Graham. Bloody dog was always running off, chasing anything that moved. He enjoyed this weather as much as Sherlock.
“Pack your bags,” he said. He looked ridiculously pleased with himself and for a horrified moment she thought he was asking her out.
Sherlock squinted in the sun. “Terry Fox.” He looked back at Kate. “I did mention I spent some time in your country.”
On the way to the car, Kate asked, “I don’t suppose you know any jewelry stores that are still open? And roses, I definitely need roses.”
He tried the second drawer (pants, socks, two forks and a copy of National Geographic), then the third (jumpers, ties, and a collection of takeaway menus). No slides.
now?” John shook his head. “Pearce couldn’t pull this off. Besides, I knew hundreds of men in Afghanistan. Probably pissed off more than a few.”
“And wife number two?” People only referred to their ex-wife as their first wife if she were followed soon after by a second. “How did you propose?”
“I’ll get a chair.” She grabbed the least uncomfortable looking one from the kitchen and dragged it noisily behind her. Set it facing their chairs and sat down. “And I
Kate heard voices in the stairwell – she stood and rushed out of Mrs. Hudson’s door and down the hallway. She didn’t want John leaving before she could talk to him.
Kate got out and started to walk away but Donovan called her back. Kate stepped around to the driver’s side and Donovan handed her a paper bag through the open window. “I forgot to give you these. Tell John he owes me two pounds fifty.”
Poor sweet dumb Molly. Brilliant scientist Molly, but dumb about men Molly. She’d run the forensics lab at Barts for thirty years before finally retiring to Cardiff with her Welsh husband, who immediately left her for a tenor in the Castle choir.
“Now I have a daughter. Who deserves a father who can manage to get her bike fixed before she outgrows it.”
He reached for John’s hand. “Despite evidence to the contrary, I do not have all the answers.” He pulled John to his chest. “But I do know we have a better chance of exploring this . . . development more thoroughly if we are not in the A and E being treated for pneumonia.” He kissed John quickly on the lips and tugged him toward the door.
Sherlock continued to stare at her. He wasted so much time on . . . thinking. If she thought that someone was about to tell Chloe something that would potentially hurt her, not to mention wreck every chance she might have at a reconciliation . . . she wouldn’t be sitting here thinking about it –
In the books Sherlock loved as a child—brightly illustrated tales of knights and maidens and magic—each character possessed one defining trait. Maidens were beautiful, fathers stern, knights brave. Frogs became princes, and princes became heroes. Villains were killed, not reformed. Personality was motivation—bad men did bad things—and revenge was never mistaken for justice. Even in these stories, heroes sometimes died, but always some good would come of it.
Sherlock turned and drew him closer, bending his head to press his lips just under John’s ear. “I know.”And then he kissed him, long and deep and low.
John sat in his chair opposite Sherlock. He sat on the edge so that their knees were almost touching. “I don’t . . . what are you doing, Sherlock?” he asked, his voice unsure.
She hesitated. “You mean did someone else inject it? I can’t say. Not yet, in any case. But he had no other injection marks, so it’s possible. The fingerprint results haven’t come back yet.  I estimate he died three to four hours before you found him.”
John suddenly put his hands on Sherlock's chest and shoved him away, putting an arm's length of space between them. Sherlock stared at him, surprised. John gripped Sherlock’s arm and said, "Not here.” John jerked his head to left and then right, scanning down the alley. “Home,” John said and grinned brilliantly and Sherlock mirrored it back at him.
Sherlock still sees what he calls his halos – but nothing more than that.  Making it through the apocalypse together was the only miracle we were going to get.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You could fit all of Manchester United in that bed.” He said it without thinking, but it felt right.
They showered together and came back to bed. They lay facing each other, wet hair slicked back, skin flushed red from the hot water. Sherlock cupped the side of John’s face and ran his thumb along his jaw. John held Sherlock’s hand against his face for a moment and closed his eyes.
He didn’t finish the letters – he’d never mastered the art of chatter, would have been appalled with himself if he had – but he knew John still saw her on occasion . . . surely two degrees of separation was better than what he had now.
Mycroft was waiting for him in the lobby.  Anthea stood beside him, looking bored and typing into her phone.
She closed her eyes and blew out a long breath. Resisted the urge to poke the bandage on Sherlock’s forehead. “Fine. But just so we’re both clear here. You’re a fucking nutcase.” She turned to John. “You do recognize that, right?”
After a minute I can hear his low moan become more frantic and he arches his back and freezes as he yanks his cock out of my mouth and rolls to the left, coming in waves on his silk robe. I reach down and join him, three good strokes and I am over the edge again, ramming my head into his chest until the chair almost tips.
“Don’t stop.” Sherlock reached around and pulled John’s hips closer to him, pushed his back against John’s chest.
Lestrade snorted. “Sherlock, he’s not like most people. He’s a bit of an –” She saw him searching for the word – “arse . . . know-it-all sometimes. Don’t take anything he says personally. Especially now.”
Sherlock felt John’s hand through his pajamas. Warm. Real. He stared at John’s neck. Wrinkled, a bit of white chest hair peeking out from the top of his shirt. He sat back down.
He bent down to kiss the top of her head and inhaled the sweet/sour scent that he loved. Molly was right. Of course she’d be fine. She was a Watson. Watsons excelled at being fine.
. Asserting his authority. Doesn’t approve of this visit. They shook hands and made (very) small talk about Canada (
John dropped a thick file on the table, unwound his scarf and hung his coat on the hook by the door.
The cabbie looked back at him in the rear view mirror. “It’s like that, then, is it? A bit of a domestic?”
She could see Mycroft shake his head. “Sherlock’s obsession with Charles Magnussen must be contained. Whatever incriminating information Magnussen might have about Mary –”
He laid them out side by side in his mind. Definitely not a set of clues. More like a Greek chorus, mocking his every move of the last 20 hours.  He stopped thinking and let the images of those hours flood his mind.
“It’s just next door – 221b. I’ll go find a parking spot. Wait for me downstairs. We’ll go up together. ”
Mrs. Hudson pushed a stack of towels into Sherlock’s arms. “Mind you dry off before you sit on anything. We don’t need mildew up there along with all your bacteria.”
John felt his head spin and decided to sit down again. Sherlock knelt in front of him, looking worried.  John felt not at all guilty about worrying him. He laid his head against the back of the chair and sighed. “So there’s got to be a point to all this right? You’re not just torturing me for the fun of it?” He cracked an eye to catch yet one more look between the demon brothers.
“The box is in the top drawer, John. Left hand side. Open your bloody eyes,” Sherlock shouted at him from the kitchen. The search was on for Sherlock’s new box of microscope slides. They’d been delivered the day before and hadn’t been seen since.
Her anger had fizzled, giving way to something darker, more disturbing. If John and Sherlock hadn’t told anyone about the Anna/Mary/Moriarty connection, then who did? Even she didn’t know about Mary’s past until last night. If the text wasn’t from Mary, who else knew about her past? Who would want to keep Mary’s name from coming up in a murder investigation? One that could see her extradited back to Canada.
And eighteen months later he met Mary. She had pursued John with a devotion that both flattered and frightened him. She was funny and smart and sexy. She learned quickly when to hover, when to let him be, and made room in their lives for his grief. She made it easy for him to love the person she was pretending to be.
It also helped him to think of John’s wedding as another assignment. His cover was supportive friend, helpful best man. He identified a spare room in his mind palace to house the hurt, and went on to make seating arrangements, fold napkins, choose flowers.
Sherlock felt the room slant. He reached out and held onto the end of John’s bed. The noises of the machines matched the rushing in his ears. Thankfully, Mycroft stepped in front of him.
“She suggested you make your famous plum pudding. Why she believes you make Christmas pudding is beyond me.”
“What does this have to do with your  . . . oh . . .” John stopped talking because the answer he wanted, but had never expected, had been tangled up in all the odd details. “You mean you’re actually . . . you’re not . . . you do understand what this means, right?”
“She calls herself an office manager but I reckon it’s closer to receptionist. Answers the phone, makes appointments, that sort of thing.” She looks at Sherlock hopefully. She clearly expects great things from the small slivers of information she is feeding him. “I spoke to her office and they said she’s on holiday. She’s never gone away without telling me.”
He’d actually looked concerned when she’d abruptly turned to leave, a half-hearted “I’ll call you later” tossed at him as she left him standing by Terry Fox, both in mid-stride. She hoped for a minute he’d follow her – to suck all the horrible emotions out of her with his cold hard logic.
The question seemed entirely random, and it surprised an honest answer from her. “A few. I like the new ones.”
Kate picked up Anna’s graduation picture. Sherlock shook his head but Kate handed it to John. “This is Anna.”
He didn’t bother opening the fridge. He saw a Speedy’s take-away menu on top of a stack of blue file folders, and shut his eyes. Everything ached. His eyelids felt like sandpaper as they scraped open again and he tossed the menu on the table. He glanced at the files, didn’t recognize the handwriting, the little post-it tags hanging off in rigid single file.
“I know. God knows any bit of it should have sent me right over the edge. But if I were being totally honest –”
“He knew, John. He just didn’t know what to do with it,” Greg said carefully. Gently. “His whole life was about finding patterns in random events. Creating order out of chaos. It’s what made him brilliant. But with you . . .” Greg paused. “With you . . . if he acted on what he felt, what you felt, it would be like creating chaos from order. And that scared the hell out of him. For a smart man, he could be pretty thick.”
“We worked hard to keep it out of the papers, but he managed to get himself shot a few months ago and he’s. . . he’s not back to himself yet. There were complications followed by surgery followed by more complications . . . he’s getting better finally, but it’s going to take time.”
“Kate . . .” he said quietly. He held up one hand, like he was trying to stop an oncoming truck. Only it was too late.
There was something in Sherlock’s voice that stopped him saying what he was about to say. Something about what a bastard Sherlock was and why would never—could never—forgive him – but all he managed was, “Oh for god’s sake, just sit down.”
“Chloe, it’s me. I’m really sorry about earlier. I promise I’ll explain everything. But right now, you need to listen. You need to . . .
When he woke up, John was sitting on the edge of the bed, holding his hand, looking worried. “Sherlock?”
The first thing he noticed when he woke up was that he’d slept late. Graham usually needed to go out before Sherlock needed to get up, and Graham usually won, but not this morning. The second thing he noticed was that nothing hurt. Since his surgery, it had been a dull throb from his ankle, which would roll into a painful twinge in his right shoulder that usually nudged him awake. His eyes still closed, he reached down to check his ankle when his hand brushed against something even more curious. Something he’d almost forgotten about.
John waits until Clara’s gone and they've put the bags down before crowding Sherlock against the wall and kissing him breathless. Sherlock’s hand comes up to draw him closer, and John slips his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth.
John jolted out of a nightmare, eyes snapped open and a gasp barely contained. He held still, checking to see if Sherlock was still sleeping before he eased out of bed. He rubbed his hands on his face, bare feet on the cold floor. He looked back and Sherlock had turned onto his side, his arm bent and his hand curled around the space where John had been and his throat closed with something that was either tenderness or despair. He picked up his trousers and shirt and left the room to dress in the hallway.
“I won’t charge extra, I promise.” The barest hint of a smile flashed across her face. “So? Do you?”
Sherlock shifted in his chair and winced. “He was trying to discover your pressure point,” he said after a minute.
Sherlock nodded and began to cough again, his eyes wild with pain. He took another gasping breath, closed his eyes and slumped forward.
“John,” Kate called after him. “I’m sorry, but come on – if I didn’t figure it out first, someone else will. Maybe someone already has and I’m doing you both a favour.”
She sat by the bed, writing up her notes and flipping through the old copies of OK! she’d found in the waiting room. After an hour, her notes were in pristine shape and she’d developed a small fangirl crush on Harry Styles from One Direction. He reminded her of Sophie McKinnon, the girl (sorry, Harry) she’d been in love with all through middle school. They’d practiced kissing in Sophie’s bedroom after school for months
“I’m hungry. How about I go pick up some groceries and cook dinner for us tonight? Then I promise to disappear for a few hours.”
Sherlock reached into his pocket and pulled out a single piece of paper, folded. “Aren’t you a bit curious as to why I’m in Ottawa, Kate?”
“John’s military background, although useful on countless occasions, can be an impediment during this initial planning stage.” Sherlock frowned and touched his forehead. “Do you think these stitches are too tight?”
Sherlock lost every bit of patience he’d ever possessed. With a shout, he threw himself across the desk and toward Sutton. The move surprised Sutton and he fell back, Sherlock on top of him. They tumbled to the ground, the gun skittering across the desk and falling to the floor. Sherlock pinned Sutton’s hands against the floor. “Where is the antidote?”
When he finally reappeared, his own case of PTSD etched into every new shadow on his face, he found the room empty. The fire gone cold.  The haze was a welcome relief. Consolation prize for the runner up.
Kate rolled her eyes. “Hey, I have an idea – how about you two go make out some more and I’ll find a real suspect to question.” She paused, deciding how much to say. John walked to the window, turning his back to them. His face was reflected in the dark window and she saw him wipe his eyes with the heel of one hand. “What about Charles Magnussen?” she said. “I imagine he has a very thick file on Mary.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll call Sherlock.” Greg resisted the urge to toss his mobile through the window. “Anything else? Don’t most poisons have antidotes?”
The car smelled like aftershave and coffee and curry. Take-out on the way home last night. Lives alone. New shirt, same tie.
He glanced at his reflection in the mirror. “You’re a bloody old fool.” He padded across the cold floor and slid into bed. This time he fell asleep immediately.
The phone buzzed. John picked it up and read the screen. “Ignore that.” He handed the phone back to Ella. “You help. You’ve always helped.”
“The day before she died, five thousand dollars was wired into the account. As it was on the fifteenth of every month.” Sherlock sat back, still watching Kate.
During the ceremony, while Harry and Lauren pledged mutual love, respect and shared litter scooping duties, John wished his parents were alive to see Harry finally and completely happy. Even if it did mean she was pregnant and marrying a Glasgow girl who wasn’t Catholic and had odd ideas about Scottish home rule and the ethics of eating meat. It would have gone a long way to relieving the irrational guilt they both felt about Harry’s drinking. His parents believed they had unwittingly sowed the seeds of her unhappiness. John thought of Rosie and understood.
Kate sighed. “I can’t believe this is news to you. I’ve been in London for three days and I know more about Mary than you two. Your wife works for him, John. Or did, anyway. I didn’t get all the details, I was too busy trying to escape.”
She nods and glances down the hallway. “The blog makes you out to be the nice one. Bit of an exaggeration, don’t you think?”
“What do you understand, Sherlock? Do you understand how insane all this is? Not only did my pregnant wife shoot my . . . you . . . but now we find out she was probably fucking Moriarty? And god knows what else – Christ, for all we know she was at the bloody swimming pool, hell, she was probably the one who was going to put a bullet through my head if you didn’t jump . . . Kate is right – this is so fucked up.”
that? I said that out loud once and Sherlock laughed and proceeded to tell me why in exquisite detail. So for a week after, I refused to do that thing I do with my tongue that he especially likes.  I meant not to do it for two weeks, but it turns out I especially like it too.
he said.  And it was, until it all went spectacularly arse over tea kettle. Your arse, Dimitar Ivanov’s tea kettle.
“He’s on oxygen which is helping him breathe easier and they’re pumping him full of thrombolytics – clot busters. Anticoagulants too. If they don’t do the job, they may have to remove the biggest clots surgically. But it’s a bit dodgy doing surgery after a course of thrombolytic therapy.”
Kate stood and brushed crumbs off her shirt. “I’d be offended if I weren’t so full.” She took her dishes to the kitchen. “How does Sherlock stay so thin, I wonder.”
John was speaking, but it was hard to hear what he was saying. Sherlock’s heart was hammering in his chest and he had the strange sense that he’d been cut adrift, lost between the past and the present, between the present and the future.
Sherlock nodded, stood up and walked inside. Kate zipped her jacket and grabbed Sherlock’s scarf, wrapping it around her neck. Sherlock reappeared with a large box and stared at her.
Sherlock warmed his glass between both hands. “I believe he does. He thought being alone would protect him. He was wrong.”
He looked confused by her sudden change in direction. “That is the standard treatment for a blood clot, yes.”
John dropped his hand and turned away. “Just go. Now.” He sank down into the closest seat and closed his eyes.
Washburn clears his throat again. “She said Spain, I think. No, Portugal. One of those timeshare places, a friend owned it but couldn’t use it. I can find out from one of the girls if you like.” He shakes his head. “It’s a hen party out there most days.  Fi told me she planned to go off the grid on holiday. No phone or internet, if you can believe it. Who does that now?”
When John stood to leave, Ronan dug into his pocket. “I almost forgot.  He said if you came asking, I was to give you this.” He glanced at Sherlock who was standing at the window and lowered his voice. “Not the tall one, he said, just to you.” He held out a crumpled bit of lined paper.
Sherlock scooted over a bit, giving John more room. He pulled John’s hand to his chest. “In order? Morphine, tea, maybe a biscuit . . .”
“I was trying to tell you.” Sherlock reached for John’s arm, but John twisted away and sat back down in his chair.
But Sarah was always there, in the corner of her mind, in the tracks of her memory, close enough to touch.
Sherlock was half-way out the door when he stopped and turned around. He crossed back to Greg’s desk and pocketed the pack of cigarettes.
“Don’t fall for his parlour tricks,” Simon said. His tone was icy. “He’s as clueless as the rest of us.” Someone called Simon’s name from the vestibule and he turned and nodded. “I should go.” He reached inside his jacket pocket and removed a small white card.  “My number.”
The roads are slick with new snow but if Harry’s nervous, she doesn’t let on. She talks happily about the twins and Clara and the new baby (
He tried to sit up straighter and brushed nothing from his trouser leg. He watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock scrubbed his own face, letting out a heavy sigh.
“You are an idiot. An idiot who is going to get my brother killed. Again. And you continue to wound him with this nonsense about your poor, misunderstood wife. I won’t stand for it.” Mycroft was breathing hard. “Your wife, John, is right now in Essex eating rosemary potatoes and filet of sole with the man she’s been sleeping with for months. She started seeing him two weeks after Sherlock’s return. Two weeks after she realised it was very unwise to put all her eggs into your very flimsy basket. James Moriarty taught your wife well. She will always have an exit strategy.” Mycroft released John’s collar and he fell back against the seat.
“I understand the seriousness of this situation. I understand it better than all of you. It’s my life. It’s my problem.”
“Hardly. Although I am happy my brief career in the theatre didn’t go to waste.” I’m also happy to see Sherlock’s faint smile as he sips the whiskey. But there’s something else there. Do I search for it or leave it alone? It’s a constant question.
After an eternity, Sherlock falls back onto his arse and I feel my legs dangling over the edge of the table. The air hits my cock, still twitching and I’m not sure whether to roll off, or just stay there forever.
He stared at it a moment, one finger tracing the outline of Mary’s smiling face. Then his face crumpled, his features collapsing in on themselves. “Oh God.”  He leaned forward and buried his face in both hands. “Jesus, Sherlock . . .”
“Doesn’t seem fair to me.” John pulled the pouch of pipe tobacco from his father’s front pocket, opened it and held it to his nose. He loved that smell, a mix of wood and apples that would forever remind him of his father. “Will you get ever get too sick to fix?”
Sherlock turned away, trying not to leap over all obstacles to John’s chair and unwound his scarf instead. “No one in need of a doctor today?”
) and warns them not to talk politics or the EU and especially not the results of the last Scottish referendum with Clara’s parents during Christmas dinner. John laughs and reminds Harry that Sherlock cares nothing about any of those things, so it should be safe.
There was never an official count of the dead. The internet and television went out long before a final number ribboned across the remaining screens. The one thing I do know is that I’ll never have to wait in line for anything ever again. The bodies all disappeared, spirited away by some cosmic SOCO team in the middle of the night.  I’d like to send someone a thank you note for that – the alternative’s a little too Stephen King for me. Sherlock said it was proof that Mycroft was still alive. No one else was that efficient.
“So, who is she?” I repeat the question half an hour later. He is in his chair, fingers folded, breathing slowly. I bring him a cup of tea and he takes it from me, the ghost of a smile lingering under all the seriousness.
“Jesus,” I manage before he releases me, turns me around, and continues his assault, kissing me hard on the lips, slipping his tongue into my mouth, now tasting of curry and spices and I claw at his shirt and he swats my hands away and rips my shirt open, dips his head and sucks on a nipple.
? Most of the time I don’t feel anything.” How could he explain it wasn’t a broken heart he suffered when Sherlock died? It was the total absence of heart and the sneaking suspicion that he wasn’t a good man because somehow he had ruined everything decent that had ever happened to him. He looked at the vicar. “I want him not to be dead anymore.” He drained the rest of his coffee. “My father told me once that I shouldn’t waste God’s time on trivial things, that I should save my prayers for something important. Guess this is what he meant. I haven’t thought about that in a long time.”
“Still in one piece.” He turned towards the lamp light and John saw the faint bloom of a bruise on Sherlock’s jaw.  “About Simon –”
“Yes. The ring was not the only evidence. My investigation was quite thorough. We could go to the police, but I’m not sure what purpose it would serve.”
Sherlock stopped himself short of reminding John that this was also the place where John had taken two dates on the same night. But John hadn’t told him that story yet. That story had come out the night of John’s bachelor party . . . the night when they had almost . . . when a lean too far forward would have undone everything Sherlock had tried to rebuild after . . . he remembered John splayed out in his chair, drunk, happy, beautiful . . .
She scanned the letter and let out a breath. “Damn . . .” She looked over to Sherlock and mouthed the word “wrong” to which he rolled his eyes.
“Apart from the first words you said to me, you’ve never questioned my presence in your city. Sloppy detective work, I think.”
“Fancy.” Kate waited as he closed the gate and they walked down the sidewalk. Her apartment was three blocks in the opposite direction, but she didn’t think she should spring Sherlock on Chloe as a surprise – best to give her time to prepare. After Kate’s return from London, Chloe’s favourite response to anything she said about the trip had been, ‘Fuck Sherlock Holmes’”. Yes, the Parliament buildings were a better destination.
Five minutes into the service, as the last notes of the organ prelude faded, John knew it was a mistake.  But it was too late to do anything but live through it. Which, when he thought about it, was pretty much how he approached everything lately.
If he really had less than twenty-four hours to live, was it too much to ask that it be sunny?  Being poisoned and soaked to the skin on the same day seemed to John a bit of cosmic overkill.
“Angelo’s. I reckon it’s time we go on a real date.” He kissed him quickly. “Think of it as a do-over.”
“Yes, of course. Good to know you’re keeping up.” He rubs his hand together, smiling. If he had a moustache, he’d be twirling it. “I expect Lestrade will ring shortly.”
done. You’ve sent John a coffee and a text. Said you’d be back in a bit. I’m sure by now he’s used to your . . . disappearing.”
John left to fetch the pillow and Sherlock crooked a finger at her. She walked over to the bed and leaned down. He was struggling to keep his eyes open, “The girl who disappeared – what was her name?”
A movement by the door caught his eye and he watched with surprise as Mrs. Hudson gave him a wink and quietly closed the door.
“I know you're a prick, I’ve known it from the minute we met. I knew it when I agreed to move in here. I knew what I was doing that first night and I knew who I was doing it with. "
Sherlock walked over and stood next to John. Took John’s hand in his. John was surprised, but immediately felt better. About everything.
. Her mother loved Chrissie Hynde and Kate had grown up singing along to her music. She tried to open the playlist, but it prompted her for a four character password. Why would Sherlock protect his collection of Pretenders tracks?
“Yeah, told him I would. Though I’m not convinced that John having it out with Mary is such a bad idea. I can’t see that she’d do him any harm, not with all of us looking on.”
Sherlock’s answer was to pull him closer. The laptop slipped from John’s grasp and they both reached down to steady it. Sherlock took it and set it on the coffee table and turned back to John. “Always okay, John. Always.”
Sherlock imagined four scenarios for how the next thirty seconds would go. Three ended up with a bullet in his head. And the fourth was impossible. The fourth scenario – John, saving the day at the last moment, kicking open the door and wrestling the gun away from this madman – was a desperate attempt to postpone the inevitable outcome of the first three.
Sherlock tried to find a place in his brain that wasn’t red hot with fury, but failed. “You poisoned John Watson and now you are going to give me the antidote.” He took another step forward and Sutton’s gun came up level with his head.
"Your clothes were so...binding. Those buttons on your shirt were about to pop on their own." He slid up the bed closer to Sherlock's head. "I do want you, but I will wait if you do not want this."
I’ve completely let go of him, and he manages to stand. He looks nothing like a bat. He’s bouncing up and down from one leg to another on the steps. Bats do
