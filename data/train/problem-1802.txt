“Oh. My. God. That man really wanted to exchange a hand job or BJ for a Chemistry’s essay?” The disgust was clearly audible, “you should have said yes, Freak,” Sally sniggers viciously, “you’re a bloody psychopath, who knows when someone else going to –”
Getting over the fact that Sherlock was alive as just another quirk, the South American was laughing, retelling old adventures as well as sharing news about their common acquaintances. Alas, the detective wasn’t really paying attention as he was more preoccupied with trying to estimate the consequences of John knowing who he was.
"Yes! It's me!" He grins as he pats his stomach. "I'm a bit fatter, I know! But, you! John, John Watson! You haven't change a bit! How strange it is to meet you here!" Catching sight of John's walking stick, he frowns slightly. "What happened? I'd heard that you were getting shot at in Afghanistan or somewhere else."
Seeing that John's smile and apparent bonhomie wasn't as deep as the occasion deserved, his friend asks lightly. "So... everything is okay?"
“Scared, me?” John hummed and nodded, leaving Sherlock space to think. “I, I am not sc-” He stopped and tried again, “I am not -”
It was the best kiss that they ever exchanged, ten times better than the sum of all the kisses they exchanged that night, in that little pub. So long ago... The sweet scent of Sherlock's hair product, the taste of his favourite tea that was surrounding the heat of his mouth. John groans as he pulls the detective even closer, the shivering in his limbs clearly not caused by the still pouring rain. Finally... the dancing of their tongues, the little noise Sherlock was making as he ravages his mouth, his neck... licking the saltiness of tears from under his beautiful eyes.
They were in a grubby but warm pub, the small gathering an occasion to celebrate the doctor’s new position in a nearby surgery. After a tough year full of therapy sessions and physiotherapy, he was finally in a better place. Physically and mentally.
Feeling guilty that his mind was able to focus on the logistics of his own care when his brother needed it a thousand time more, he stops at Sherlock's door and pauses for a moment. His usual iron levelheadedness was starting to slip, and he knew it. All of it. Secretly managing Sherlock's mission from afar, keeping the secret from his friends and family, adjusting to his new life with Greg, the wedding, dealing with his brother's rescue... and now this.
Turning quickly to look at the untouched breakfast, he frowns before shaking his arm to get his brother's attention.
"You know what they say, liquid courage!" He surprisingly quickly pulls Sherlock onto the bed. Or more specifically, on top of him. Holding him tight...
Clara was up getting coffee when she hears John talking about the beautiful stranger. Laughing, she interrupts the story. "I knew that something happened at the terminal!"
“Maybe, but he’s under my... my responsibility.” Rubbing his temples as to chase the sentiment away, he waits for Mike’s verdict. “He’s... he’s so beautiful, Mike. I’ve never seen a man so pretty, but pretty in a man way, you know. Strong, agile, tall, but not bulky or anything.” He sighs, his thoughts turning back to the time they spent in the closet. “And he smells so fucking good, and his voice... God, I nearly came just by hearing his damn voice.”
“Let go for a beer then. Molly, are you joining us?”  The DI asked, looking at the cute pathologist expectantly.
A good talk… AKA: The conclusion to this little story, that finally got really little to do with the movie. Except for the fact that Kate and Matthew are both also adorable.
.. he thinks as he turns to the back of the car to get the grocery bag.  The aggressive sounds of a car horn wake him from his reverie as John, instantly in doctor mode, looks at the road in case of an accident.  John freezes, dropping his bag and letting his cane drop to the ground, as the man from the terminal was standing in the middle of the road. He was about to open his mouth to say something - anything! - when the man vanishes as if he hadn't been there at all.
Looking at the gate, John read the sign out loud, “The Old Operating Theatre,” before looking back at Sherlock. “This is marvellous! I heard about this place, are we really going to go in?”
“Don’t sell yourself short, man, I know a few men and woman at the office who haven’t given up on you!” The number of times he’s been cornered by a besotted member of the Met! Asking him to put a word for them toward the dark but dreamy Byronic detective! “But, a flatmate could be good for you. if you find the right person. Keep searching. Being alone isn’t good for you, sometimes I worry, you know...”
The government man is about to retort when a text from Anthea confirming that they were minutes away, stops him. “Time to go away Gregory, stay behind that wall over there and do not intervene... I don’t want you to be an official part of all that, you’ve got too much to lose.”
"I created an account for him on the site, under the name LondonSleuth." She opens the account and turns the computer in direction of the DI. "Here you go... you can read it if you want!"
Tired, Watson murmurs, “What do you want... I just want everyone to forget that I’m here.” The weight of a paperback suddenly falls on his stomach.
After a few minutes, the cleaning team shows up, opening the rooms one by one. Turning off the light and re-locking the door when the cleaning is done. The moment they enter the third room, the lecturer runs to the door and applies a paste before the cleaning staff ends the job and closes the door for the night.
“Really? You don’t think that... that I am  a fr-, weird.” Sherlock mutters as he fidgets with the buttons of his coat, suddenly shy. “That, that letter I wrote to you... it’s a lot, I know, and –”
“I am... I am afraid that you are going to leave because I have done horrible things; I am afraid that one day I am going to attack you... I nearly did in the cemetery...” Tears were pearling from his beautiful eyes. “I am afraid that criminals like Moriarty are going to hurt you to hurt me. that I am going to love you so, so much but one day you are going to die and -”
Rolling his eyes as Stamford is talking to another officer, probably answering the same questions, he explains everything. Everything except the fact that he is actively trying to find a gang leader...
“Don’t be dull, I’m a great fan of yours! I know everything!” is nose wrinkles in distaste, “hate that hair colour, really awful.” As the car gently comes to a stop, the well-groomed man nods to his bodyguard who is now holding a syringe and mutters sadly, “don’t have a lot of time, so sorry my dear, next time…”
Looking at his whiskey, he raises it in Sherlock memory, murmuring sadly "And to think that two of our friends were in a more important relationship than I have ever been so far. Without even being honest enough to admit it to one another. So sad. Don't you think, Mike?"
The fact that he found no testimony that Smith was a drug user was another argument against the idea of a junkie creating a new drug and dying of an overdose.
“You still have doubts as to why he was in that cupboard, Gregory, perhaps you’re going to learn something more shortly.” Smiling innocently at the older man, he adds, “It’s in the Met’s interest to know more.”
“Shush,” he peppered small kisses all over his lovely face, “it’s the first time it happened since you stopped drinking human blood, isn’t?” As Sherlock nodded, sad and troubled, John kissed him again until the need to breathe forced him to break the connection, “that is so fucking sexy! I, ordinary John H. Watson, was able to trouble your great mind enough that you lost control after a century!” He laughed, grinding their manhoods together, wanting to be lost in the pleasure of having the tall man behind him until they were both panting in exertion.
They left the hall quietly, while the party was in full swing, the guests eating hors-d'oeuvre and drinking wine.  Mycroft was the first person John saw when he steps outside. "You! Get out of my sight!"
Walking out in the direction of the meeting room where the surveillance material was set up, he quickly asks without stopping, “how? What happened?”
Turning in the direction of her boss, Donovan shakes her head. “No, so far the only things we know is that Holmes and the mini-mes he chooses as friends are nailing the pub quiz!”
"No, no, don't worry, you are not strong enough to hurt anybody!" Another one, Murray, teased, lifting his glass with a wink. "Especially, Three Continents Watson!"
"You're lucky, you know, you are perfect together..." After a sad sigh, he murmurs, "I don't think it's going to happen to me you know."
“Don’t talk like that about him!” The doctor protests, “it’s not right! Okay he likes to put his nose where he shouldn’t but it’s only enthusiasm! Remember how you were at his age and –"
The doubt of the first man is received by a harsh laugh. “Stop being a pussy, Harrison, since when do you mew like a babe when an opportunity to make more money appears!”
“This is why it’s going to remain as we are right now…” Getting a USB drive from the back pocket of his trousers, he placed it in front of his old friend. “Are you interested in a third tome?”
He cringes as desire invades his thoughts and he becomes unable to stop his reactions to the body next to his. Despising himself, his thoughts are quickly followed by guilt. His high sense of morality currently fighting against the urge to simply pull Gallagher by his shirt and kiss him! Touch him! His senses on alert, he is able to feel his heat, to catch his odour.
“William! Should you be here already?” He promptly kisses his girlfriend before taking Sherlock’s computer bag from her hands, “I’ll take care of this, we’re together for the next hours, Will and I.” Wiggling his eyebrows, he winks. “It’s Doctor Watttttson’s class, your saviour!”
"A big mistake, the first of many probably. I was so focused on finding you that I never realized that you were here." He blushes, feeling like an idiot.
"You're right, darling..." She stops walking as her phone pings "Oh, my phone. Shit!" With her teeth, she removes one of her gloves and fishes out the little device in the inner pocket of her coat. She reads for a minute or so before she starts laughing "Oh!!!!!!! Quick, love, we need to find that little café John was talking about!"
"No, and it's not a 'band', it's a musical." She struts near Greg with a satisfied smile and shows him her phone. "Read!"
Not acknowledging the return of the excited buzz, he quickly set up his session and, getting a grip on his emotions, he finally starts his lesson.
"Oie! You're supposed to be my friend first and foremost, and after that Sophie's, and lastly, the kiddos!" Mike was smiling more openly, happy that John was able to joke a little and not moping alone.
Stopping, the vampire frowned, unfamiliar with the resistance to what can only be called an order. “Something wrong?”
“But don’t worry, he’s going to be out soon enough, and you’ll be able to continue the case. Are you sure –“
The memories of his time in the hospital, of the infection that nearly killed him, the thought of his mangled shoulder, nothing was worse enough to make him totally grateful to be in that little village, on that island, so far away from conflict, so far away from real action.
The sender was a server called ExclusiveLove. As his anti-virus didn't detect something weird, he clicks on the first one.
“Me, perfect?” John arms enveloped the lithe body, “no... far from it. I am usually patient but I can be obstinate about certain things, I still have terrible nightmares and wake up screaming and fighting whoever is in bed with me, my family life is horrible, I don’t have a clue how a functional lasting relationship works, I am grumpy in the morning until I have at least two cups of tea, I often miss the war which is clearly not a good thing, I -”
Carefully lifting his cup to his lips, Sherlock asks again "Okay, so... What about him? Except for the fact that he's probably devastated, he loves her and..."
"I don't ask for more!" Rushing after John, Greg leads the doctor to a quiet corner, far away from the others.
"John," Clara argues quietly at his image on the screen, "you won't get better if you don't give yourself a chance..."
"DONOVAN, I won't let you disrespect my husband or his family!" He points to the door.  She tried to apologize, she wasn't stupid and she was now aware that she had been manipulated by Moriarty, but Greg wasn't ready to listen.
Knowing that he had no choice, not when she was in that kind of mood, Lestrade took the phone and starts reading aloud. "Sleepless at Yaverland. What am I reading? It's a lonely heart ad'?"
Paralyzed at first, Sherlock pushes his panic away and rolls his eyes at the lack of subtlety and utters icily, “you have nothing that can be of interest to me,” and pushes the man away before going on with his day.
The detective was about to leave his brother's office when he calls him back. "One last thing, Sherlock?"
When he started to write a blog at his therapist’s insistence, he never thought that one day he would become a professional writer. Not wanting to write about the war, it was not something he liked to think about, he started to write short stories full of spies and detectives before setting on a taciturn hero, intelligent but full of himself, who always solved the case and got the girl. Keeping them to his blog, instead of websites dedicated to auto-publishing, he left his little nuggets of nonsense available to anyone to see without advertising anything. But here he was, two novels later and on top of the bestselling list.
The position was not that glorious and wasn’t worth a big happening, but he was pleased to have his friends around him. It was the best thing that happened to him since… since he cannot remember when! Being able to help, to work as a doctor – even if it was only to give shots and pills for STDs – was way better than staying in his bedsit waiting for something to happen.
Losing interest in the outside world, it was impossible to know where they were going anyway, Sherlock turns his focus back to the case. After a second viewing of Smith’s files after Holt meltdown, the solution became clear suddenly,! It wasn’t Holt, but his TA... it was Appleton. The text he had sent to Lestrade right before he left asked for a thorough review of the young man finances and his links with McAllister.
Sally, thinking about the snogging session she had with Anderson instead of checking the screen, mutters, “I don’t know Sir, it just... One moment everything was normal and then –“
“He’s not a teacher –“ a third voice tries to object before the man smacks him, the sound resonates in the empty room.
Watching longingly after the cabs that pass near them, Sherlock sighs. "I'm a consulting detective. Invented the job. The man on the phone was from the Yard, he needs help. Always, kind of sad, especially at this silly season. So... Cab."
“Always going somewhere, I know…” She paused, patting John’s arm. “You know, you should find a sweet young girl! My niece is –“
“Sir!”, the door where the bodyguards disappeared was now open. “He’s awake, what do you want us to do?” He frowns before adding, “he’s kind of driving us crazy and I had to stop Bob from knocking him up silent. Twice.”
Looking at Mycroft defiantly before pointing the ceiling, Greg replies with a bit more bites "No, but HE can!"
"You know how it is, Sir. People sneak into your office when you aren't there." The woman was looking as pristine as usual, but her boss's eagle eyes were able to see behind the clever make-up.
Taking the tea, John asks automatically, "how do you know about my therapist? And psychological limp?"
"You heard him, he doesn't want us to do anything, Molly..." Greg is at a loss for words. "Anyway what can
“Excuse me Sir, are you a tutor or do you have any family relationship to the young man? Anything change since the last time we saw you?”
Moran darkens at the insults. “Her Majesty Army is often a disgrace to her men! Enough chit-chat, sorry to say that but I think I –”
"Hello, Gregory." The warmth in his gaze disappeared as his eyes fall on his husband's subordinate, "Sergeant Donovan."
“Do you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend? If not, I’ve got a few friends who are willing to pay me in pints for an introduction!” Grinning, he didn’t realize that his classmate had frozen next to him.
“I’m certainly not that late, am I?” John smiles, spotting the candles on the table, “and we can’t let those candles go to waste for noting, can we?”  Sherlock, sitting back slowly into his chair, looks at John with an edge of mania in his eyes. “Everything all right? You look… agitated.”
“No.” Sherlock replied, softening his reply as soon as he saw the deception on the man’s face, “I mean, not here… too many people… I can’t hear myself think. I know a nice restaurant. Come with me.”
Clearing his voice, he extends his hand. "Hello, John. I'm happy for you." looking at the people who were starting to gather around murmuring, he chuckles shyly. "Short version. Not dead?"  Right before the groom rushes to punch him.
An eager voice replies with an edge of fear and hope “Yes, yes... and you said that I should be able to have my money back four times over?”
“Yes! That’s the name!” After another quick peck on her boyfriend’s lips, Lucy waves to William and pushes Marcy in direction of their class and for a little girl-talk!
Closing his eyes a second, his level of anxiety starts rising at the thought of leaving his village, leaving the island.  Hating the feeling that his life here is becoming a security blanket, he opens his eyes back and looks at Harry. "Okay, I'm not going back to work until the second anyway."
I couldn’t think about it in public. On the tube. I certainly couldn’t think about it in front of Sherlock, not if I could help it. I felt like it would be transparent on my face.
, all the breath I’d apparently been holding came rushing out in something that sounded a bit too much like a sob. She looked up, all eyelashes and glowing cheekbones and delighted eyes.
She tasted clean and musky and salty, none of which was really that foreign, but all of which was surprisingly intoxicating (my addled brain supplied something to do with
‘Hey, it’s ok. I kind of didn’t know either. I mean, maybe if I hadn’t been such an idiot. For… well… ever.’ My heart was doing a crazy thing, like it was dancing to a fiddler on speed. I was fucking terrified.
‘In addition, I don’t require you to dress in heels, or business dresses, or make attempts with that blue eye-shadow stuff you still haven’t worked out how to apply properly. I’m already well aware what your eye shape and colour is in a range of situations, along with your various bodily features regardless of dress,’ I made a strangled noise, but she persisted before it could form into words, ‘and I provide you with entertainment – you can’t tell me you find the latest Hollywood concoction more interesting than our cases, because I know for a fact you don’t. You’ve walked out on three films for a case, including one of those dreadfully implausible spy ones you like so much.’
The Taliban’s automatic guns were firing without precision, trying to kill as many people as possible, soldiers and civilians alike. His protective instinct back now that he accepted that it was impossible to save the people on the bus, he helped a few soldiers with minor wounds to reach cover. Until he saw Elliot, one of his men, falling down as he was shot in the leg. Rushing to the man, he stopped the blood loss as much as possible under the circumstances.
Lifting his head from his deep contemplation of his empty pint glass, John smiles at Greg. "Yes, yes, everything is okay."
“No, it reeks of my dear brother’s men. I know a nice Chinese place a little further away... You know I can guess the fortunes in the cookies.”
I think that if he really wants to have the trouble of having a partner, he could have chosen worse. MH
In the first chapter, I’ve said that Sherlock used to go to King’s College, I’ve changed it because it was impossible that no one remembers him! So, he went to Oxford instead, the posh git!
“I’m undercover right now, for a case, you know, so tonight you don’t know me, okay? Don’t call me Sherlock!”
"Yes, it's Sara. You know that, don't fish for more information..." John chuckles, not able to stay cross with his sister for too long.
He is still holding the undercover detective, unable to give a damn about the rumours that spread around them when Mike’s joyful voice murmurs near him. “So, this is your William. That will to stay away didn’t work after all.”
Finally giving up, the older brother mutters in a defeated tone, "I'm going to take care of Mummy's gift for her next birthday."
They drank their tea quietly until Sarah sighed while looking at the clock. “Better to go back, or the secretary is going to file a missing person report! Lucy at HR is waiting for you to complete your file, do you have any questions in the meantime?”
“Yes, after that thing two years ago... You would have thought that they were able to monitor students about to do crazy things better!”
Sherlock is still looking around, searching for something when he stumbles on the place where they kept a prisoner. The length of the body, the shoes size, the blond hair he founds where the doctor head touched the ground, everything is saying John. Color drained from his face at the sight of blood drops on the cement.
Reply by Doctor John H. Watson: Sorry, it's been 4 days. Your comment, it unsettled me so I had to ruminate a bit. I used to think that stars are the people that I loved that are looking over me, showing me a way, a path thru all this. A bit like you said. But, since I'm back, it's as if my comrades that died are looking at me from the sky asking why I'm there when they aren't. Sorry, I don't want to destroy your own epiphany. God, this is ridiculous, I keep having to apologise to people nowadays.  And now I need to say it to an anonymous person, this is, I think the most pathetic I will ever be.
Hi John! Really nice speaking to you yesterday! This is so funny, I walk thru that park nearly every day to go to work! MS
to the church episode.  "Anyway, now that I know that it's raining, I don't think I can't get any wetter."
Chuckling, John tried to stay serious. “Faking to amputated a patient, Isn’t a bit strange for a date? Shouldn’t we go to a movie or something?”
"I needed to talk to you. Sherlock --" The DI places a hand on John's arm to stop him. "Listen to me! He's in danger!"
Keeping his dismay and self-destructive thoughts to himself, the detective turns to look outside and forces a last smile on his reluctant lips. "It's a beautiful day, yes, yes... I'm truly happy for him."
Looking back at the few pictures in the file, he tries to link them to the black and white face on the blog. Far from the energetic and smiling man that posed in Afghanistan with his team, or that teen running on the soccer field. Eyes glued on the small portrait, Sherlock wasn’t able to read anything.
Knowing perfectly that the odds were mostly null, a small flicker of hope and fear was hidden under his composed manner.
The feeling of loss was instantaneous when the surprisingly delicate pressure of the strong hand disappears. Instinctively licking his lips, as if his body needs to taste the young man, the doctor is uncustomarily flustered.
A flash and he’s in the little military hospital, fighting the pain, fighting the nurses, angry but resilient. Cold. Dead inside.
wedding day isn't the best when... John and... what's her name again? Oh yes, Mary do not know that..." He sighs and closes his eyes a second. "Mary. It's a good name. A solid name. No fuss. Traditional. It pairs nicely with John."
"Thanks, love." With a last squeeze of Greg's shoulder, he left the room and walked in the direction of his brother's bedroom.
"I'm sure, poor Sherlock... he can't go on like that! Not now that is life as a detective is really starting to take off."
“It was nothing serious, I don’t need babysitting!” Even as if his demeanor was saying everything except ‘nothing’!
John wrinkles his nose, “you smoke? That’s not good for you, you know. I’m a boring doctor, I know, but –“
With a sad pout, Sherlock shrugged his shoulders, “I guess we can keep the costumes one more day.”Offering him his arm, he smiled at his scrumptious captain. “come, darling, the car is waiting.”
“Why are you saying this? You really think that you are both not good for each other? How could you -”
The idea of having a whole week with them was really pleasant and John was nearly feeling himself again. He raises his head as the walking passengers start to make their way out of the door connecting the terminal to the dock. He saw them quickly, his sister jumping up trying to spot where John was.
Subtly, he writes a text to Scotland Yard as the military looking man walks to the small table and sits down with the others. Turning a bit to talk with his classmates – just enough to not raise suspicion by staying silent too long – he waits a few minutes before sending another text.
"Okay..." The detective rolled his eyes at his friend's nonsensical words and the fact that he was actually drooling on his shirt. "perfect... yes... you do that. Come inside would you?" He helped John up the stairs and was about to continue one more floor up to John's bedroom when the doctor pushed the door of their shared living room. "John... It's better if you go to bed, don't you think?"
The hands that were pinning the thin young man to the wall push harder, roughly knocking his skull on the centuries old brick
Jumping out of the car, Sherlock pulls the poor example of a man out of his seat, took his place and starts the car. Leaving a stunned bastard alone in the middle of the A10.  The whole operation took less than a minute.  “Don’t worry Molly, the next village is only a few miles away.”
Unable to resist, John swiftly pulls on their hands to bring the man to his level and presses his lips upon Sherlock before calling a cab with his other hand.
He sighed deeply, happy that his novel was over. It was probably going to do great, as usual, but it was getting... kind of boring. His free time nearly one hundred per cent dedicated to writing, it was getting harder and harder to find something exhilarating to write about. The few non-earth-shaking dates he went on did nothing to rock his world.
“Put him in my office, on my cot,” after a second or two he adds, “but handcuff him. Both hands and feet separately... you never know with that bloody man.”
You have so much to learn about so many things, my love. It is going to be my pleasure to educate you. MH
"Gentlemen? They are closing..." Anthea was waiting, keeping the door open as both men - a bit stunned - walk out of the pod, Sherlock taking John's hand to avoid being separated in the crowd.
– the portable coffee mug from Speedy's. His eyes wandering on the man who was badly driving the compact car.
Looking at the computer, Sherlock reads "I am an experienced medical doctor recently returned from Afghanistan." He nods in appreciation, guessing that the small picture of the doctor was probably previous to his period abroad.
“Why the exam then, if the threat to his reputation was enough to get him on board?” Lestrade asks to Sherlock’s annoyance.
Unable to see who was with Anthea as the pod starts its ascension, Sherlock shakes his head. "I am not fond of repeating myself, but as I said, I think it's an elaborate set-up..." Thinking about the woman he saw with John just forty-eight hours earlier, he adds a sad "apologies."
Without paying attention to the angry man, the detective walked back to his room and muttered, “you’re first for the shower, I need to wait for the clothes anyway,” before closing the door between them.
“Don’t need one,” his breath was labored, the pain of his possibly broken ribs kicking in as he moves to the chair, “I’m okay.”
He was up, still holding onto the chair when he realizes that maybe - just maybe! - he should have asked Mycroft help.
His friend's reaction when he found him at the pool even gave him a bit of hope that Sherlock wanted something more.
he smiles, "can be fulfilled by staying with me? And the not being married to me is something that you can do for the rest of your life?"
“You said, ‘people’, who are you talking about?” Sherlock repeats annoyingly, thinking over the last weeks, trying to find a time when the doctor may have seen something that he shouldn’t. “Who ‘shielded’ me?”
So, do not be afraid that you've been stalked by a maniac, it was only the action of a curious man, wanting to understand his feelings.  We understand and won't contact you again. This account going to be closed in the next few minutes.
As Mycroft's bodyguard and chauffeur shouts that they need to leave now, the window for a discreet flight was closing quickly, Mycroft promptly gives one last kiss to Greg. "Follow our plan, darling, we are going to hold each other soon."
"I'm going to send Simpson to wait for you outside as soon as we are back home..." Mycroft says, holding his brother tight.
"As if you didn't know..." the patient shrugs, turning his gaze to the window without looking at his brother.
"Watson." He starts walking back to his home to get his things. "Yes, Ms. Gallagher, I'm coming. Just keep putting a cold cloth on his forehead until I arrive."
vampires are first and foremost human. If they need help, we help them. Their bodies are not invincible, unlike what some people may think.” Her tone was firm as if she was daring her recruit to talk against her policy.
Sherlock turned, comforted by the deepness of the doctor’s voice and right on time to see the tell-tale lip licking. He smiled and winked, “Ohhhh… I’m THAT wonderful -” before he realized John’s costume. “Oh, darling, is this for me?” The former captain, knowing the vampire’s love for formal military costume, had chosen a 19th-century officer’s costume. Heavy red wool, copper buttons and tight,
"Sherlock is in danger and we haven't saved him from a Serbian chamber of torture to have him killed in a church in Chiswick!" His eyes were hard but Greg was able to read the fear in them. His voice breaks."I won't let that happen, you understand, not because I didn't consider making a thorough check on his
His mind was restless, his recent inactivity was driving him crazy! The idea that somewhere in the city, someone was maybe plotting a complicated crime! The heist of the century! The puzzle of a lifetime!
"It's good then, no?" Mycroft argues looking at the happy couple that was still going down the aisle, stopping every two steps for kisses and
“Oh no... It’s so sad. I don’t understand you are so sweet and nice and cute, you should have dozens of men after you!”
"Why do you ask then?" He asks, really clueless about why someone would care, "If you don't want me out of your hair."
Her first thought was that the man was beautiful in a subtle way. Except for the fact that he was walking with a stick, he appears to be, well, 'normal' compared to the people that usually around Sherlock.
Reply by Anonymous: I am not at all a poet, too rational and scientifically minded for that, but you're right, it's peaceful to think that even within the total darkness, light can come thru to show us the way.
Less than one hour later, Sherlock was at the back of Mycroft's car, the trunk full of the various things he had with him during his sojourn to his house. He was looking outside, trying to predict the streets that Simpson was going to take when he realizes that the route they were taking wasn't making any sense. "Where are we going?"
The emotion of the moment was dissipated when the guide announced the live demonstration of a Victorian operation room.
Shaking his head at the stupidity of all this, but complying for his friends’ amusement, he slowly turned in the direction his mate was pointing.
“I, I don’t have, I... I am not suffering from PTSD.” John stutters, hating that he was in awe of Gallagher’s analysis even if he is angry at the intrusion into his personal life.
"What are you talking about, Sherlock?" The pathologist asks with a smirk, used to her friend's antics but worried about his disheveled and exhausted look.
"I am a graduate in the biochemistry field, curious about life, and the mechanics of the human mind but - don't be fooled by that - I am energetic and like to keep my life unpredictable. In a more generic way, I like to eat out, nice clothes and playing the violin. If you are likeminded, don't hesitate to contact me."  Greg was smiling when he turns to look at Molly. "You know, I think it may work!"
She recalls the teachers with grabby hands and the many similar cases she saw at the Met. It wasn't in favour of the lecturer, even if she joked about 'Sherlock's Doctor' a few times. She waits, looking at John with stern eyes.
Thinking about the state of his brother when they opened the cell - sickly thin, broken, staying up only because of the chains that were attaching him into the ceiling, the quantity of blood, urine, and vomit on the floor - Mycroft was once more possessed by an uncontrolled rage. The satisfaction when he heard the sound of the deflagration that destroyed the compound was his only comfort
Strangely, the thought of the lonely doctor hadn't left his mind since he read his poor example of a blog in Molly's office. And he wasn't able to resist reading it daily since then.
"We've been back from honeymoon for a bit more than two weeks now, and everything is perfect!" Greg replies with an honest smile even if he was still angry about Sally's implication in brother-in-law's downfall, especially now that he knows first hand the price he paid.
"Let's just say that he didn't warm up at the idea of you seeing him not at his best. He was ashamed I think, even if it's ludicrous after all the..." he stops as his phone vibrates. It was a message from Mycroft. "John... come with me now. Please."
"Aie! What? I'm right! You know I'm right! Since you've been back, have you even looked at anyone? Be honest!"
"Nobody came, not even me!" Greg jokes thinking about the jumping and humping he did to mimic the expected behaviour of newlywed. "I've been to the Opera, the actor who was playing your role was flawless. We sat at the back of the box and everything went as it should. Nobody suspected that you weren't with me."
"Yeah," he mumbles, "and one day I'm going to wake up with new memories. As if the war just never happened." Looking into his sister-in-law's eyes with a sad smile. "Anyway... I don't think I am in the right mindset to find the love of my life right now."
The pub, right outside the castle gate, was warmly lit and cosy. A few locals, as well as a dozen of the wedding guests, were already relaxing and drinking in the main room. Quickly finding his place with a little gang near a pool table, John finally relaxes for the first time since he spotted Fiona.
“Okay, but this conversion is not over...” After a quick pat on Mycroft’s back, he walks quickly in the direction of a nearby wall.
“Have you... have you ever been in such a situation? Not that... you are in a situation right now. I am not AT ALL interested in you! You know you can talk to the dean and --”
Careful to not look at his husband, who was probably screaming 'No' with his eyes, he replies quietly, "ready for a wedding."
After a hesitation, considering all of the pitfalls of starting something that will only last one night, he gives in to his curiosity, and offers John a pseudonym to make it more safe, “Scott, William Scott.”
"Yes, yes... I'm going to start at the top floor and go down, you start with the garage and go up." Getting a grip and pushing away his feeling of failure, he asks Maxwell to contact Anthea for a quick survey of the CCTV in the area and heads back to the residential floor.
Watson, quickly sobering up, grabs William before his head knocks on the floor. “Gallagher... William... Are you all right?” He finally breathes when the young man starts to cough and finally reopens his eyes.
They are working on a complex formula when something in the corner of his eye catches his attention. A few students, including the asshole who cornered him two days ago, were discussing something at the end of a row of shelves. Even if  he isn’t able to see everything clearly because of a partially frosted glass, things were unmistakably changing hands! Closing his computer, Sherlock rises slowly. “Sorry guys, need the loo, back in a sec,’” Leaving the small room, he closes the door silently before walking in direction of the stacks right behind the spot where the little meeting is taking  place. Once at the end of his row, carefully as possible, he moves the first layer of books to be able to listen.
“Sir, I... I am... sorry.” Sally stutters, not wanting to become an enemy to the powerful man and sincerely wishing her best to Sherlock. “It was inconsiderate, I will ask both for their forgiveness.”
) while nudging John in the ribs. “You walked a long way, use the shower, change the clothes, relax a bit!” He cocked his head in the direction of the double bed and winked (
A controlled usage is causing a temporary euphoric state, the overdose creates the contrary. Until the body can’t take it and just stops functioning.
"Time for his meds, your turn." Greg smiles, kissing his husband lightly while sitting innocently at the kitchen table, drinking his second cup of coffee.
The small woman, even if she was still a bit under the water, smiled at Lestrade. “Yes, I am! And Sherlock you must come with us, no excuses.” She knew that getting out is not his forte. Vampires were broadly accepted, but the man attitude was already often problematic in society.
“He’s not perfect.” John’s grins drunkenly, “his pale skin would be wonderful against dark hair... and that perfect arse would be to die for in a tight suit.”
Only one chapter to go probably! Let me know what you think of Mycroft intervention and BAMF!Anthea :-)
"No, no... not a game." The detective was taken aback by the doctor's attitude. "Seriously, what kind of game can be that dull... I am as
turns to look at Mycroft. "What's going on? Don't talk to Mary like that, she deserves to know what's going on, like me!"
"Imagine that he doesn't love him anymore, what if even their friendship is over? Can we take that risk?" The image of his brother, high as a kite in a drug den, springs to his mind. "You know what I'm talking about, we can't take that risk, we can't tell him. He's not ready!"
“Tell me what happened, please. I want to help you. I’m with you, always, you know that.” After a moment, he pressed his brother against him, trying to calm him. “That criminal, Moriarty, John told me, flew away but we are going to find him, don’t worry. You are going both to be able to have a great life without his interferen -” Interrupted by understandable muttering, Mycroft tilted his head to be nearer, “what did you say?"
"Yes, it was strange, it was as if you had seen a ghost!" She laughs, fussing with his clothes before kissing him and rushing inside. "Be quick, it's freezing! And we need to talk about that Sara!"
His mind already elsewhere, he didn’t remember the conversation at all, he nods briefly before walking out of the venue to go to the parking lot where a black car was waiting for him to bring him back to his miserable flat.
“The same thing as your brother, Sir, I was relaxing at the end of a hard day.” Turning on his heel, he walks back to the car and with a nod to Anthea he instructs, “Angelo’s, Northumberland Street. Thanks.”

“Really sad story,” Alan continues, “he lost his grant and everything. A week later, he killed himself and --”
The lecturer was talking about head trauma – in car accidents, in sport, etc – when someone raises his hand. Nodding at the student, Watson took the opportunity to sip his coffee and sit back down at his desk as at some point he had jumped to show things on the screen and had been energetically walking around.
"You are here for real, you are not going anywhere..." The doctor was now holding Sherlock tightly in his arms, not wanting to let him go. "Say that you are staying with me."
December 24th: The sky / It's Christmas Eve, the sky is wonderful and full of brilliant stars. I wish you all, where ever you are, a peaceful night.
Sherlock, his hand still on Watson's mouth, drops his head to murmur in the doctor's ear, "I'm going to remove my hand, don't scream or talk. I've got the feeling that, like me, you don't want to be discovered by our... friends." Slowly, keeping eye contact with the lecturer even if they were unable to actually see each other in the dark closet, the undercover detective removes his hand.
... A bit later, sitting in a nearby pub with some of the attendees, he sighs, thinking about the relationship between John and Sherlock.
He was now grumbling in a an obvious manner until Molly explodes. Looking at her friend with in her mirror, she chides him severely. “Sherlock! Stop fidgeting! And do not try to deduce Brendon!”
A few days later, Sherlock was at Bart's when his phone buzzed. Not acknowledging it - he wasn't waiting for information from his network and Lestrade was out of the country on his sex holiday - he continues to look at Anderson's abysmal photos. "Can't believe how useless that man is..." He grumbles to himself, "actually, yes, I can believe it."
"I won't be alone, Simpson is going to be with me. You know how he is, he won't allow anyone to touch me! Everything going to be perfect, in 12 hours at the most we are going to be back." Hoping to lighten the mood, Mycroft rolls over, opening his arms for Greg like a model on a runway. "What do you think?"
"If anyone here knows of any lawful impediment to this marriage, they should declare it now." After waiting a few seconds, the officiant continues with a smile. "Before you are joined in matrimony, I have to remind you both of the solemn and binding character of the vows you are about to make. Marriage, in this country means the union of two people, voluntarily entered into for life, to the exclusion of all others. I shall now ask both of you, in turn, to declare that you do not know of any lawful reason as to why you should not be married to each other." Turning towards Mary, he asks, "do you know of any lawful impediment why you, Mary Elizabeth Morstan may not be joined in matrimony to John Hamish Watson?"
Quietly, Mycroft sent a text to his brother's therapist to come later that day instead of tomorrow. "'Lock, do you want tea?"
"It's okay, we're going to go somewhere when everything returns to normal." Greg murmurs automatically. Taking the opportunity of having John's attention back, he continues, "just know that he left for an excellent reason and that it was not as
Shaking his head, he moves his chair away from John and taps on it playfully. “Bring him here, Jake, I want to see first-hand what all the fuss is about.”
His worries about the unusual situation, he wasn’t stupid and realized quickly they were in a drug operation, was turning into irritation.
"Okay... So, all this is just an unfortunate turn of events." Still shaking a bit, he sits in the nearest chair, a comfortable plaid armchair. "Why didn't you cancel when you knew?"
“Don’t be silly Molly... I already agreed to bring your weird friend with us... Don’t push me.” The sharpness to his voice was clear now, putting Sherlock on edge. “If I present you to my mum, I hope you’re going to behave better! No girlfriend of mine...” But he was interrupted by Sherlock. Leaning forward between the seats, the exasperated detective took the wheel and turns it to bring the car to the side of the road. “WHAT THE HELL,YOU FREAK!”
"Shhhhh, love, it's going to be alright."  For Greg, it was hard to believe that that crazy plan of a fake yet real honeymoon in Vienna as they planned Sherlock's rescue had  actually worked!
The satisfaction that his friend didn't flirt with any woman didn’t last, as another wave of shame rushes into his heart
"Don't worry Molly,"  John's voice was sickly sweet "I know that he's able to twirl you around his little finger when he needs something... but you! YOU!" he points at Greg, "I thought you were my friend!"
“John? Are you all right?” The doctor in chief asked, a little smile on her lips. “It’s a lot in one day, isn’t?”
Unable to stop giggling, John repeats Sherlock’s words to the American tourist that was in the cab they pursued, shaking his head at the pure insanity of their actions “Welcome to London!”
"I don't want to lose you." He didn't say 'obviously' but it was clear in his tone. " And, isn't that what people do?" The tall man asks, a bit lost.
"I need coffee! Then a good shower, then we are going for a nice brunch..." She is strangely happy for someone who just woke up a few minutes earlier.
"You shouldn't," John shrugs. "I am not as fit, but I used to be a soldier... I think I can manage a little village."
Don't want to be blunt, but if you want this to go further I need to ask. How much does a doctor make a year in the Isle of Wight? Do you get a bonus because you're so far away? I don't want to work, so I --
At Scotland Yard, everyone cheers at the kiss, not so secretly hoping that Sherlock's acerbic attitude going to be mellower (one can hope!).
Sherlock walks out of his building, trying to keep his computer bag on his shoulder without hurting his ribs. And failing.
"Okay love... everything is ready. You just have to take a shower, change into your own clothes and we are ready to go." Helping his husband out of the borrowed outfit, he states in a hush, "let's go home."
The doctor rapidly opens the door – happy to be able to do so from the inside. Turning on his heel, he watches as his student remains in the closet, quickly tapping on his phone. “This is not the time to chat on Instagram or whatever Gallagher!” John protest, “maybe you didn’t realize, but they were dealing drugs. In a classroom!” As Sherlock stays silent, texting everything to Lestrade while watching the security cameras outside to get a visual on the men, John rushes to open the light.
"Perfect!" The petite woman jumps up to hug her brother-in-law as Harry quickly books ferry and train tickets for December 30th. "We're leaving tomorrow morning!"
Looking up to the sky, he frowns as very few stars were visible because of the light surrounding him.
“I am a grown man and I like to think that, yes, I know what I am saying.” The doctor objected with a cocky smile, betting that he was right and that Sherlock’s attitude since the cemetery was only fear of the unknown.
“Yes,” John acknowledged, stepping closer to the man he loves, “this is why I asked your brother to drive me
Quickly but quietly, the man explains that he had lost track of Sherlock. "I still don't understand, he was there calm, relaxed. I left him for one minute and..."
"It's him, not me! He's the one who contacted John's fake account." Harry tries to justify her actions. "Yeah, I know, I was supposed to close the whole thing down but... I couldn't! I thought if there were a small possibility of something happening was still on the table..." She points at her phone, excited. "Read! Read!"
aren't my department usually, but he needs to talk to someone about... feelings and such. He won't talk to me!"
His attention went back to the corridor when he hears the noise of a door shutting as Watson finally leaves the room.
Locking his eyes on Mary's he tried to find something to hang on to. She was smiling benevolently, lovingly.
"I know... but I don't like her." Holding hands, they walk out of the house with the kids to go to the church.
Entering Molly's small office, Stamford grins at the others' cheerfulness. "What's going on? Why are you both so happy?"
"No!" He was trying to push tears of rage "NO! You listen! YOU know how I suffered when he... when I thought he was dead. All this for what? Playing whatever game his majesty found amusing at the time?" Looking at his watch, he utters coldly, "you've got 6 minutes left. Choose your words wisely."
All he could think of in that moment were John’s perfectly steady hands against his skin, rubbing along his ribs, thumbs grazing his nipples. Sherlock kicked his feet up to rest on the table. He could see John smiling darkly at him, knowing that he had the upper hand; Sherlock was at his mercy. John was nestled between his knees and nipped at the insides of Sherlock’s thighs through his soft pajama bottoms. He rose to his feet, leaning his body into Sherlock’s. He braced his arms on the sofa back and bracketed Sherlock’s head. Sherlock opened his mouth in a silent gasp when John ground his hips against Sherlock’s aching groin. John rocked into him while mouthing at his neck. Sherlock was climbing a hill fast, his heart racing against John’s chest, and was at the peak and ready to throw himself down the other side, when John pulled back.
Burning tears ran freely down Sherlock’s face. Bile singed the lining of his insides. Sherlock’s stomach lurched.
The thought of losing Sherlock tortured John daily. Instead of the Afghanistan sands, he’d dream of thousands of red sights on Sherlock’s bloodied corpse. John had to wade through pools of rifle shells just to find Moriarty lying in the same spot with Sherlock’s carved off face stapled to his, toothy grin spread ear to ear.
“I am sorry that you are in this predicament.” John scoffed, keeping his back turned. “But would you not agree that this may be for the best?” John uncrossed his arms and faced Sherlock. Rage boiled under John’s skin. How dare the bastard?
“Right.” Sherlock was certainly feeling better to be so grumpy. John picked up his shoes from beside his chair and slipped them on. “Would you want me to pick up dinner?”
John blushed hotly. She was a smart woman. Soft snores erupted from the body on the couch. She leaned in.
. His trigger hand shook at his side. He itched the have his gun in his hand, because he was ready to kill the person that dared touch Sherlock like that.
John’s hands were impatient as they undid Sherlock’s belt and trousers. Wanting nothing more than to feel Sherlock’s hot flesh, John wrapped his fingers around Sherlock’s firm length and tugged. Sherlock threw his head back at the pleasure. His own hands rushed to get out of his shirt. God, why did he have so many buttons? Sherlock’s shirt fell open, nipples stiffening at the cold air of the lab despite the red flush across his heated chest. John bent forward to press his mouth hotly to Sherlock’s ribcage, kissing and licking his way up to lap at the hardened buds of Sherlock’s nipples. Sherlock leaned into John’s tongue. His heart was hammering against his chest like it did during chases or when he did just a tad too much cocaine. It was bloody fantastic. The feel of John’s hands running over his skin, pushing, pulling as Sherlock was tugged away from the benchtop and flipped onto his stomach. Alarms went off in his head. There had been too much time spent in this position in front of the wrong person. The sharp bite of panic shortened his breath to quick gasps. John’s strong hand splayed across the pale expanse of Sherlock’s back underneath the sagging material of his dress shirt. The cold fear in his chest dissipated as soon as John’s warm hand pressed against his skin. John was nothing like the previous man. He trusted him like no other.
On the cab ride to Baker Street, Sherlock and John had their hands on each other’s thighs- just on top, resting innocently. Sherlock on the other hand, could not resist sliding his onto John’s inner thigh, earning a shudder from the doctor and a hitch in his breathing. John furrowed his brow. He was trying his very best to keep from blushing, but he felt the tips of his ears getting hot and his trousers getting tight.
He brought a spoonful of broth to his lips and ignored the searing pain at the roof of his mouth. Sherlock lifted his phone again.
Sherlock stood there like a Greek statue, brilliant eyes narrowed toward the door. John didn’t try to move or draw Sherlock’s razor attention, so they stayed quiet for another five whole minutes before Sherlock finally broke the silence.
Sherlock tried to hide his coloring face, but John reached up and cupped his jaw. “I want to see and feel all of you.”
. He never pulled it because there was always a nagging in the back of his head of something coming. He wasn’t sure if it was just him trying to be hopeful, but this past week put him in lighter spirits. The stern frown on his face was gone when he rose from bed to bathe despite his nightmares. He hated to think it, but his life seemed to have turned after meeting Sherlock.
“You’re the blogger, aren’t you?” Victor stared at John’s stern face for a second longer before grinning from ear to ear, his fake accent completely dropped. “You are!” Victor took a step back and extended his hand out toward John. “What a pleasure it is to meet you.” John’s eyes didn’t waver from Victor’s young-looking freckled face. He looked at least five years younger than Sherlock, but if they had gone to university then surely they were around the same age.
Sherlock and Mycroft turned to John. The doctor couldn’t even believe what he said, but he said it, so he might as well go through with it.
There were plenty of beautiful things about Sherlock, but what John loved the most was the pure excitement and glimmer in Sherlock’s eyes when there was a case to be solved or a body to be looked over. John was sure that if he had been in better health, Sherlock could solve the case purely off the details Lestrade gave him, but Sherlock wanted to be there behind the yellow tape- he needed to feel like his normal self, calculating and whip-smart. So when John finally agreed to go along with Lestrade, Sherlock nearly popped his stitches leaping so quickly toward his bedroom to change.
Sherlock rushed toward the loo, nearly crashing into someone on their way out. There were only two others inside as he hurried into the first stall on his right. Closing the door behind him, he grabbed some paper to wipe the seat before positioning himself to look as elegant as possible despite his environment.
The dark haired stranger turned back from the door and steps into John’s personal space. “Is that what?”
John couldn’t see Sherlock anymore. All he saw were the darkening bruises and the raised slashes across Sherlock’s beautiful skin. Sherlock stared at his own feet. He wanted to know who had done this to him, but John couldn’t speak.
He pushed the door open with gentle fingertips. The room smelled inherently of John and dust. It had been awhile since John had stayed in this bed, Sherlock thought as he went through John’s things. John never had as many things as Sherlock, sticking to the idea that wherever he was, it was only temporary, but he had even fewer things since leaving the house he and Mary shared. He snatched a brown leather belt from atop the dresser and sat at the edge of the bed. Sherlock had to get a move on if he wanted to have ample time to come down.
Hello again! Thanks a lot for keeping up with this fic and being so patient with my updates. I promise that the details of what Victor did to Sherlock will be brought to light, but patience my dear friends!
“I took it upon myself to replace your chair.” Sherlock unwrapped his scarf, revealing that beautifully pale throat. John looked between him and the chair.
Sherlock turned his head to meet John’s lips, warm and just slightly chapped. John traced the detective’s bottom lip with his tongue.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Don’t be thick, Gavin. It was clearly the mistress judging by the ligature marks on the wrists. Mr. Dursley was an active participant in the BDSM community and got into something he wasn’t quite ready for. I wouldn’t be surprised if you found his mistress bawling her eyes out at his flat. You can call us in tomorrow once you make the arrest.”
Sherlock ground his teeth together. He hoped that once he was rid of that dreadful memory, his mind palace would be settled, and John would go back to calling him “brilliant” when John in reality said nothing. Oh, how he hoped things would return to normal. He was reliving the nightmarish thought that John was Moriarty when he had stepped out from the shadows at the pool, but he knew otherwise. He was certain that this was not John, but Moriarty’s venom coursing through him. Sherlock had allowed himself to fear the man he loved, thus making a weak spot in his mind palace’s structure. Moriarty would not win.
“Keep your voice down!” As the walk past Sargent Donovan, John said awkwardly, “Sorry – it’s just, um, nerves, I think.”
“You could.” Sherlock laughed as he looks down at his friend. A tear dripped from his chin. He had lost his chance with John. He had lost the chance to hear those soft endearments whispered into his ear in the early hours of the morning while they lazed in a shared bed. Sherlock could almost see the sunlight streaming in through the window and catching on John’s eyelashes.
Unfortunately, John didn’t have any food in his new flat, so as he ordered takeaway, his eyes drifted out the window once more.
“I hope you don’t plan to do any consulting for the next couple of days. You need to fully recuperate.” Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to settle his swirling stomach. John thought that he had fallen asleep when he finally answered with a shake of his head.
The walk to St. Bart’s was fairly quick and easy. He hadn’t even realized that he was already there until he heard himself speak.
“Which was it – Afghanistan or Iraq?” He briefly met John’s eyes before turning back to the phone. John glanced at Mike for a second who only gave him a knowing smile.
Mrs. Hudson placed tea and biscuits on the table while Sherlock removed his coat. “I hope you’re here to explain what it was that was going on upstairs.” Mrs. Hudson had made for a good friend and even better confidant.
John shoveled in the rest of his food, glad to have a home cooked meal after eating takeaway for so long. He licked his lips clean and watched Sherlock prod at his half-eaten meal. John sighed loudly.
“Well, isn’t it bloody Sherlock Holmes,” the voice cooed. Sherlock kept his eyes focused on the brick in front of him. He had solved a number of cases slumped against that wall.
John’s skin felt numb. The only thing he felt was the sharp edges of the letter opener cutting into his palm. Shreds of wallpaper, fabric, and stuffing clung to the soles of his bare feet.
John ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair to his cheek. Sherlock turned ever-so slightly till he could lick the tip of John’s middle finger from the corner of his mouth. Gently, Sherlock sucked in John’s finger. John’s cock throbbed hotly in the mess of Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock eased his other hand down the cleft of John’s arse. A moan escaped John’s lips. His heart beat quickly in his chest watching Sherlock suck on his finger like he was starving for it.
Sherlock said: “Hey, what’s happening? Who left a bus in the middle of the road?” Then, “What a shit place, nothing work!” And, after he saw John and Mary, “Am I interrupting something?”
“This is not what that DI of yours said...” opening his phone, he read “Something happened at Kings and Sherlock turned off his phone. Please ask him to contact us.”
Forcing himself to be serious despite the excitement, he asked again, “are you sure you want to do this?” He talked to Sherlock about the bet a few days ago, after a good bottle of wine and a particularly satisfactory snogging session, and to his amazement, the man found it excessively funny.
He is still doing a mental list of pros and cons when his sister steps outside the bedroom and starts making coffee.
** Anthea said: Allowed me to interrupt that edifying discourse of unsecured masculinity. (and later) Put your hands in the air!
“So....” Moran says as he sits in a nearby chair, happy for the leverage against Watson, “are you enjoying your return to uni, Holmes?”
Keeping his back toward John, he murmurs, defeated. "If it wasn't for me, you would probably have a wife and kids by now! I destroyed everything, I cause you pain... Don't you see it?"
Until he hears a voice at his left. “Hey! You, Captain! The silence is driving me crazy... No radio, no tv, what kind of crappy hospital this is! No A/C... Talk to me, mate, I’m dying of boredom here. Among other things!”
Able to talk in the warmth and affection of the old lady, he murmured, ashamed, “I nearly attacked John, my precious, beautiful, gentle John.”
Thinking about the few people who contacted him that way the first few days his profile was online, he hopes it wasn't one of them!
As the car halts inside the old building, Anthea (John was calling her The Bond Girl in his head) opens the door.
Portsmouth? Why... Do you have a case or do you want to visit the historical ships? You always wanted to be a pirate after all. MH
Sherlock withdrew slowly, holding his hands in front of him. “You were in the middle of a nightmare, I… I didn’t know what to do… sorry…”
Shaking his head, Holmes light-heartedly interrupts the policeman, “he was on your suspect list for days –”
“No, no, it’s not that, sorry, you were saying?” he quickly replied, not wanting to look overwhelmed.
“Tut, tut, tut, Doctor Watson, temper,” the ex-military chides playfully, pondering his options.  “First thing first, what were you doing spying like that in the park.”
“Yes, please, it’s really interesting.” Shaking her hand, he walked to the HR office as she went back to work.
"Oh!" Sherlock's eyes sparkled a second before becoming clouded again. "Thank Lestrade for me when you go back to the kitchen, would you?"
“Just asking, what about you, John? Any prospect for a Ms or Mr Watson?” Murray repeated, with a friendly but concerned look. The thought of his friend being all alone when he deserved so much love was worrying and saddening him.
"This makes three. The first time was at the ferry, you never saw me." John was mesmerised by the man's voice.
"Yes, to both..." Mycroft replies, exhausted by the night's events. "Did no one come last night? Everything is alright?"
“Of course, and we are right in time for a demonstration of an operation in the theatre...” with a wink he added, “too bad it isn’t with a real patient!”
Without a sound, he sits in a deserted pew near the end of the church. And he sees him. For the first time in 2 years, his tired eyes fall on the beloved face of John Watson. The amount of information was staggering! Each little details filling John's room in his Mind Palace, updating instantly the void caused by his absence.
"Love..." Greg lays a gentle hand on his shoulder and quiets his voice. "We were all worried about Sherlock, we never thought that... Anyway, we are going in right now and get him out of that situation." He motions to Simpson to come nearer. "We are going inside, by a side-door, are you ready?" The chauffeur/body-guard nods, readying his gun. "John, are you okay." Stunned, but most of all afraid for Sherlock, John nods silently. "My', stay behind me. Simpson leads the way."
Unable to shake his belief that the man is hiding something, he grabs his bag and runs to his first class.
Not knowing why, Sherlock walked purposely in the direction of the back of the pub, eyes locked on the blond man’s ones.
“Are you sure about that, Mycroft?” Greg walks nervously, unable to stop. “It’s kind of... illegal.” As Sherlock’s brother silently laugh, he continues, “Nooooo, let me be CLEAR, it’s really illegal! You may kidnap spies or whatever thing that you do I don’t want to know, but John Watson is an English citizen, an Army veteran –”
“This is truly wonderful, have you seen the saws! And that guide presenting how to cure an ingrown nail by chopping off the whole toe! (ouch!) Can you believe it! This is barbaric, thank God we do not act like that anymore.” Frowning, John realized that he never asked an important and quite personal question.
The excuse was lame even for Sherlock, who quickly puts on the rest of his suit and goes down to wait for Molly.
“It’s the proof of an open mind for someone as homophobic as you to know such a word, I am really proud of you!” He jokes, unable to stay silent. He didn’t wait long for a reaction as he was once more brutally shoved against the ancient bricks wall, distinctly feeling the blood dripping from the back on his head now.
Afraid for his friends, unable to imagine a world without John in it, the detective jumps to protect the man he loves more than anything.
He smirks at his sister's reply asking if Ella was a good prospect as a girlfriend and asking for a picture. Could you imagine, dating a therapist... Someone who's able to read everything that you don't want to say out loud! Horrible!
"Sorry to say, I think this is a set-up, Doctor Watson." The voice, echoing in the closed space, was velvety and warm. Slowly, John turns in the direction of the end of the cabin. And he saw him.
I am in the middle of fictober (One chapter a day...) and I can't find the time to continue this WIP. Don't worry, stay around it's coming!
"It's just that it's our wedding night, but I am so stressed out about... our trip... I can't think about anything else." Hugging his husband tightly, he kisses him softly. "I love you so much Mycroft..."
Chiding herself about being too obvious about her little scheme, she quickly singsongs out "No, no! Just had a good shag last night and I slept suuuuuuper well so I'm really relaxed!"
. They haven't slept together yet, but as they were only at their fourth date John wasn't too worried.
“Are you... are you...” Sherlock stutters and definitively blushing, wanting to know if John was in the same disposition of him without being able to ask frankly.
“Your flaws?” He was now standing dangerously close to Sherlock. “I don’t remember anything that horrible.”
With a low chuckle that ends in a wince, the detective asks "Are you really interested in something that trivial Mycroft..."
Sherlock's heart somersaults when he realises that he was in front of a nicely restored Victorian middle-class home.
Looking at the time instinctively, he realized that it was nearly time for the meeting with his editor.
"Nobody calls them that, it's like Tinder but for a meaningful relationship, and pretty exclusive also. For professionals and all." She motions Greg to start again.
"Yes, but I'm thinking about moving elsewhere. It's not a very nice place to... to receive clients."
"I know, peace Sherlock, peace... I know... You've told us so many times." Mycroft was unsure about informing John of his brother's 'resurrection' when Greg was adamant that they should!
Shaking away any doubt that it was too good to be true, he started his weekly clean-up, trying to be as ready as possible for working a whole week.
“I  feel pretty old some days too, but when I am near you my weariness disappears. Can’t you see? You won’t be able to find anything that I don’t love. Sometimes you may be annoyingly cute but nothing will push me away.” With one last small step, he was able to stand near the object of his desire, feeling his presence as if it were a magnetic field. He murmured lovingly, “I was totally gone on you since the first day, but you were so bloody perfect that I nearly felt as if you weren’t honest with me... As if you were constantly wearing a mask. That you were too good for me. When you started to be a bit of a jerk sometimes, a bit lost in your thoughts instead of always being so considerate, that is when I knew it was possible. That is when I fell in love with you irremediably. When you opened up to me, when you showed your true self to me, that’s when I knew that our two
"You are still successful with the ladies... and the lads!" Murray laughed loudly, getting the attention of the people around them.
The government man, realizing in what state his brother was, had quickly administrated a light and safe sedative.
Later, a bang on the metal bed frame is enough to chase any remnant of the sedative. His head pounding because of the drug and the loud noise, Sherlock looks at the man in front of him.
"I'm okay Mycroft. Don't worry."  He smiles while his eyes remain dead of any emotion. "Of course, John is going to marry someone, he should, he's going to be good at that. Being a husband and... whatever else comes with that."
“Watson, wake up,” the man shouted, his luscious lips indecent in the scene of horror surrounding them.
“This is so obvious now! Don’t you see it!” Pointing the TA he explains “this useless waste of a human being, realized while correcting Smith’s paper that he had the potential of a great,” he stops, feeling Lestrade’s eyes on him, “a... strong drugs in his hands. With the help of his mate, McAlister, he decided to commercialize the drug. Only one problem!”
“Could you please read to me? My head is hurting when I read right now, bummer. It’s just a Le Carré spy thing, but I want to know how it ends.” As John looks at him, astonished by his persistence, the other man smiles openly “Hi, mate, my name is Paul!”
“I told you that if you are willing to make sure that I won my own bet, I really don’t mind... And I am planning on explaining with many details how marvellous you are and how totally in love I am.”
“Ms. Hooper will be giving you a sort of,” the nurse hesitated. “Orientation.” John nodded, thanked her, and left downstairs. He cursed to himself as he wobbled down the steps.
“I kept a newspaper clipping of you folded into a tiny square under the sole of my shoe. When I managed to find a place to sleep, I would set it beside my head and imagine that you were there next to me. It is what kept me grounded the most, I think. I had another version of you in my mind, of course, but he would always call me a prat, and well, the photo of you never did that,” he laughed quietly, eyes drifting to the marks on his forearm. “I do regret trying to forget you. I tried so hard after that night. You were so cross with me, and I thought that after telling you about the child, you would never be able to love me or think I was brilliant. The only thing I wanted to do was forget that you were the most important thing to me.”
The detective took his cup gratefully and held the rim to his lips, eyes closed. John watched him. He looked so calm and certainly much better than previous. He could hardly tell that the man suffered from an overdose on cocaine. Sherlock opened his eyes and narrowed them at John.
The threat of rain loomed over John’s head as he walked. A young woman leaned against the wall of a café, coffee and umbrella in hand. She winked suggestively at John as he passed. There was hesitation in his next step, but he continued nonetheless. He was no longer a single man to stop at every wink and tongue flick sent his way.
There was nothing in the room but the sound of their heavy breathing. Sherlock glanced over toward the door and burst out laughing.
John isn't the type to walk into battle not knowing what to expect, so when he leaves the flat in search of blood, he's going to get it.
“Well, you certainly need to take better care of yourself, even if you aren’t. We’re going to be living a healthier lifestyle now. No more late night cigarettes and takeaway.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “And dare I say, no more tea.”
“I appreciate that you are allowing me to be this close to you, so soon into a new aspect of our relationship.”
Sherlock looked down at his own feet and crossed his arms behind his back. John hooked his finger around Sherlock’s belt loop.
When John stepped outside, he wasn’t expecting to see Sherlock standing by the curb. And he was definitely not expecting to see a NSY squad car and officers pointing at the younger man.
John smiled and kissed his hand, not minding the fine sheen of sweat. “Would you like some tea?” Sherlock grimaced. The amount of sugar Sherlock liked in his tea made his stomach twist painfully. “Maybe some cool water and a long bath then?”
“Nothing in particular.” Sherlock continued to ignore John’s concerned eyes. “We were just talking about how ridiculous you look with your collar up.” Sherlock whipped his head around toward John with an ugly scowl. John knew what they looked like with Sherlock looming over him like an angry shadow, trying to intimidate him with his height and icy glare. John was unfazed, however, and couldn’t help but smirk at him. It might work on other people, but there was nothing that Sherlock could that would make John flinch away from him.
“I thought I would be the more difficult flatmate to live with,” Sherlock rumbled. John’s eyes snapped toward the still reclining figure.
John sat in the car, staring out the front window as the DI drove. Lestrade glanced over at him from time to time, but he was a little nervous to ask what exactly had happened. It would be off the record for his mate’s sake, but he was hesitant to know the depth of John’s rage.
The sharp inhale John took had Sherlock’s heart skip. John stepped closer, fingers hovering over his back.
Outside of Sherlock’s room, he took a deep breath, knowing very well that Sherlock wasn’t the only problem behind that door.
The woman put her hands on her hips. “That’s Sherlock’s room. You’re not supposed to step in there.” John swallowed hard and withdrew his gun. The woman gasped.
“Nonetheless, I had gotten accustomed to it, where even Sally Donovan’s use of it was not bothersome; but after my return, she had not really used it in my presence, and even though she may not have meant it in consideration, I appreciated it. I had thought that maybe I had finally proved to everyone that my intellect was nothing to fear. When I had met you, you were initially impressed by my deduction skills, so I never thought that I would hear that word from you.”
made John’s head sway. When Lestrade had dropped him off, he found Sherlock in a deep sleep. It was the only time Sherlock looked remotely approachable. Even when he was pretending to be someone else, he always held a sharpness in the way his mouth moved. There are plenty of people who can feign sincerity, especially in the eyes; Sherlock could do that without a problem. It was changing the way that your mouth moved that was difficult, and Sherlock could never quite get that pompous frown to completely even out, so seeing Sherlock asleep, face slack and tender, made John’s heart swell. This figure, however, tense and prickly, was something John didn’t particularly enjoy.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.” Sherlock chuckled.
Sherlock would need some time to reorient himself, and John hoped that he would let him know if he wasn’t feeling any better as he headed for the upstairs bedroom to change. He would need to take a long shower after this disaster. John was about to take his first step up the stairs, when his stomach twisted.
“Sherlock,” John barely made out. “I’m . . . so-” Sherlock swallowed him whole, relaxing his throat so he wouldn’t gag so hard. The slick heat of Sherlock’s throat threw John over. His vision went white with the sheer force of his orgasm as he spilled himself down the detective’s throat. Sherlock swallowed what he could before he pulled off to gasp.
The bedsit was bland, off-white and grey in the dim light coming in through the window. John Watson, retired army doctor of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, placed his pathetic amount of belongings onto the cot. He began to place them neatly in their designated places. At the bottom of his suitcase, his Sig Sauer was wrapped in cloth. The heavy weight was comforting in his hand. The calluses on his fingers lined up with the trigger, and his thumb grazed the hammer. There were so many memories in this pistol. He had drawn it close to his chest before checking corners, peered down its sights at enemies, pressed the muzzle under his chin. There was not much honor in being invalided home. The injury to his shoulder might not have been so bad if the infection had not taken. He had a fuzzy memory of the same nurses and doctors he used to work alongside with staring down at him with worry as he went in and out of a feverish consciousness. His shoulder wound could be hidden though; it was the cane he relied on that made his situation that much worse. The ache in his leg would worsen with the slightest weather change or if he stood or sat too long. People stared at him. His therapist had explained that it was all in his head, that his insecurities made it seem like everyone was looking at him when they weren’t, that his limp was psychosomatic, but it was a hard thought to push away.
“You’re a dangerous game, and I want to play along with you.” John kissed his mouth closed, running his tongue across Sherlock’s. The world around the detective was spinning. His body was free falling into John’s kiss, and he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Not all wounds heal properly, Doctor Watson.” John gripped his change and straightened up. “You of all people should know that the wounds we don’t see are the ones that hurt the most.” The man rose to his feet, blankets falling to the sidewalk, dusting himself off. He wore tailored blue slacks and a light blue button down.
“You’re beautiful, Sherlock,” John muttered, shedding his jacket and jumper. Sherlock didn’t hesitate to mash his lips together with John’s, letting his tongue slip in just so. In John’s head, his thoughts flew by at breakneck speed.
Sherlock ignored him and threw himself down, reaching under John’s bed for his army trunk. He flipped the lid and pushed aside John’s uniform, various military mementos, and paperwork. It wasn’t there. He stood and glanced around the room. It was an exact replica of what John’s room looked like in 221B, but something was off. The dresser had been shifted just the slightest from its original spot judging by the scratch marks. Sherlock pressed his back against the side and pushed, body screaming out in protest. John’s efforts on the door increased.
“Never trust a dog to carry out your work!” John kicked Redbeard’s stomach. Sherlock had to hurry. His hands wouldn’t stop trembling as he tried to unlock the door. John aligned the front sights to Sherlock’s arm and fired. The bullet went through his right forearm. He was sobbing loudly as the key clicked, and he rushed in, locking the door behind him.
John brought his other hand up to squeeze at the taller man’s firm cheek, pressing his thumb in beside his tongue. The sharp intake of air from Sherlock only made John want to go faster. John replaced his tongue with his thumb. Sherlock whined from the burn of John’s thick digit.
John continued speaking with an unfaltering vice grip on his thigh. “Leave the door unlocked. I want to see your feet on the floor.” John let go of him, leaving a pulsating pain in his flesh. “Now go.”
John switched his phone to silent and put it back into his pocket, grabbed the duvet, and went back out into the sitting room. Sherlock was placing the cleared dishes into the sink and stood at the entrance of the kitchen looking sickly pale against his deeply colored bruising and marks. John laid the duvet on the couch and held his arms out for Sherlock. The taller man looked shy as he walked into his open arms, wrapping his own around his torso. John kissed his face as softly as he could, breath ghosting past the worst breaks in his skin, and held Sherlock close to him. Sherlock’s curls smelled wonderful against John’s neck as he stroked the back of his head. John swore he could hear Sherlock sniffling, but rather than point it out, he left the other man alone to not embarrass him. John slowly eased themselves to the couch and wrapped Sherlock loosely in the covers. John was looking for the remote to the tele when a familiar voice greeted Mrs. Hudson downstairs, followed by quick footsteps up to their door.
“The other kids in primary used to call me a freak. As I grew older and my knowledge expanded, the word was said with more venom by my colleagues.” John recalled the banker he had spoken to years ago. He had sat back in his chair and thought the world of himself while Sherlock searched for clues. Anger flared in John’s chest at the memory.
Sherlock obeyed and let the coat slide from his shoulders. It was a constant heavy pressure that he loved, but now, he was left bare to the outside. He shuddered. The voice and hands soothed him. A hand reached back and massaged his neck from right under his hairline to the bend where his shoulders met. His skin turned into gooseflesh. The other hand unbuttoned and removed Sherlock’s jacket. Sherlock leaned his head back, feeling the rough of stubble against his own cheek. Lips kissed his jaw.
Sherlock dreamt of warm tea on a winter morning and the way the heat radiated through his palms. It was a dream of soft grey light and maroon jumpers. Sherlock wanted to stay in that dream land, but they never stayed that way. Dreams turned into nightmares he had already lived through.
Sherlock closed his eyes again at the thought. Maybe it was time to ask John. It was bound to happen, so why push back the inevitable?
Before John exited the flat, he gave Sherlock a hesitant kiss on his temple. Sherlock held his position on the sofa, hearing the uncertain steps at the bottom of the steps. He counted to three in his head before John walked through the flat again.
Mrs. Hudson tsked over the state of his bedhead and talked about all the goodies she would bake for him, mostly sugar-free, now that he had a heart problem. And maybe he should give up chasing criminals for a tad?
Redbeard opened his mouth to get a better grip on Sherlock’s arm. Alarms wailed in Sherlock’s head. He swung his leg and landed a solid kick to the dog’s side. Sherlock just managed to scramble to his feet when the gunshot struck his left shoulder. He cried out in pain.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, pressing his palms in between his shoulder blades. Sherlock closed the gap and leaned into John. Their bodies melted together and their mouths fell open with tongues lapping at the inside of each other’s.
John gave the landlady a quick squeeze goodbye and jumped into the back, immediately grabbing onto Sherlock’s sweaty, trembling hand.
Sherlock allowed himself a moment to cry over Redbeard. His body burned and ached, but his chest was heavy for his first best friend.
Sherlock shot up and stepped toward the door leading out of the flat. John gripped the back of Sherlock’s head, held him close to his body, and whispered, “I don’t think so” into his ear before slamming his face into the doorjamb. Sherlock’s cheek collided with the corner. John threw him into the coffee table. Sherlock gathered his hands beneath him and pushed himself to his knees.
“John,” he moaned. John hummed and the vibrations ripped through the detective’s body. He trembled under John’s palms. “John,” Sherlock panted. “I can’t- I won’t… much longer…John…”
“Sure it was!” Victor had stepped out of the shadows now. He slicked his brick-colored hair back with the rain. The freckles on his cheekbones had darkened over the years.
His heartbeat is going back to its usual rhythm when he hears something strange. Suspending his breathing for a second, he realizes that he wasn’t alone in the small space. He is hearing a second person, the scent of as yet unidentified grooming products and laundry detergent mixing with his own. Turning slowly on the side, his elbow accidentally nudges someone’s shoulder.
“He was anxious to get away from you, Holmes, can’t say that I disagree with the sentiment.” With a last sardonic smile, the woman leaves Sherlock alone in the now empty warehouse as his phone vibrated in his hand.
"Never said I was 'nice'..." Frowning, Sherlock looks at the doctor with dispassionate eyes  "So... good day then. Have a nice life."
He was considering the inconvenience of having to think about food all the time when John stepped at his side and kissed him on the cheek.
"Still moping, Mister Holmes? Seriously, from your reputation I was expecting better from you." He opens his eyes at the sound of the light laughter. "It's good in a way, you're making my job much easier!"  Whispering in his ear, Mary's voice murmurs harshly, "tell me, Sherlock, do you have a list?"
With a small chuckle, John kicks his bad leg with his walking stick. "I'm not doing a lot of running nowadays..."
Suddenly, he stops his vigorous walk and opens his phone, looking for the doctor's blog. The last entry was as pathetic as the other.
His fingers dancing over his keyboard, he starts to investigate Smith’s life. The amount of data proving his genius was staggering, excellent grades, perfect research, works published in serious journals while he was going for his post-doc... His family background, regular folks without any serious education or money, was the reason why he received grants over grants to pay for his university.
"Sherlock?" He laughs merrily at the idea. "I don't think - it's not really his thing to be interested in that kind of --!"
"You cause me pain because I love you so much! The pain of not being able to get what I want because you didn't feel or do things like that, then suffering from losing any chance to ever get it because you died in front of me! Letting go of the hope for a miracle and settling for second best only to realize that you were still alive! That! That's what pain is!" With a slight pressure, he forces Sherlock around.
Back with their drinks, Mike argues with a laugh, "it's true that your blog isn't perfect! But it's always hard when you start something like that."
"Sherlock, stop it." Molly laughs, "you have to be nice to him if you want to work on that case while Greg is away."
"John..." Mary was trying to calm him "we don't know everything, it's hard to judge the situation right now. Of course, it does not look good for them, but
"John, sorry..." Mike tries to calm his friend as he was trying to button the buttons of his shirt. "I didn't..."
Eyes closed, John is pondering the discussion he had with his boss an hour ago. Instead of  being threatened of losing his job, the director simply warned him about going out in places where the students are going. The innuendo was clear, he must stay away from William. The most important thing for now was that he wasn’t dismissed!
Sherlock chuckles as if it were possible for a Holmes to not go to a boarding school, and shrugs, “I was homeschooled until I was twelve, then was sent to a boarding school.” The goal was to help him to socialize but... “The same place my grandfather, my father and my brother attended. But he was already at university when I arrived.”
Sitting at the bottom of the bed, Mycroft opens the first file, not acknowledging the subtle 'you can go now' "The kitchen? What gave me away? The odour of coffee probably... Anyway... this one look promising! It's dating from 1975, the biggest disco ball in London disappeared in a dance floor full of partygoers and nobody saw anything..."
Funny: An experiment that was written as a Sherlock Holmes story! http://www.chymist.com/properties.pdf
“The right-hand man of the dealer was there for a few minutes then left,” Mycroft replies to Greg’s question. “Then, Sherlock tries to get out discreetly to follow him but the... student that harassed him a few days ago – the man we now know has a part in all of this – spotted him.”
Greg was about to gives his opinion on the whole affair when a scream and the bang of pews being shoved around resonate in the church. John's voice was heard over the noise. "YOU BASTARD!!!" Taking his husband by the hand, he rushes to the back of the church where a furious doctor was punching the hell out of a stunned Sherlock.
John was still trying to strangle Sherlock (more for the dramatic effect than for real, thank God!) when Greg, Mycroft, Stamford, and Molly arrive near them. Holmes quickly kneels near his brother, raising a hand to stop John while Greg - showing his badge - asks everyone to get out of the church and go directly to the party venue. "Let them be, nothing to see..."
December 25th: Nothing / I wrote poetic bullshit last night. And I wasn't even drunk. Which I am a bit right now. You see Ella, I'm doing something with my life, I'm drinking!
Guiltily pushing away the memories of his friend away, he considers calling the hospital. Just to be sure that William was out and that no complications arise, of course.  He’s still unsure about what to do next, when his phone pings, from a restricted number.
Sitting taller, Sherlock lets his eyes survey the man in front of him. He is well dressed, hair slicked carefully with just enough product, a slight smile on his lips as if he knew that the detective is observing him… and is loving it! Extending his legs in a relaxed pause, he chuckles softly as if the situation was a daily occurrence.
"Everything is ready, Ms. Watson, please follow me." Anthea, a little smirk on her beautiful face, walks through a security corridor until they reach the platform. Turning to John, she smiles. "Is this your first time in the London Eye, Sir?"
“Holmes! You’re going to do as I told you!” The beefy man was pushing hard against his classmate, angry that he wasn’t cooperating. “You’re going to complete the work I’ve gave you or –"
yourself to be interested in me is nearer to the truth,” Sherlock argues, his mind elsewhere, “which is already better than many, Doctor Watson, I’m sure that this distinction was greatly appreciated by your subordinates when you were in the army. Too bad that it ended that way, psychosomatic limp and all.”
“I am not only a one-night stand man for them!” John argued, even if he wasn’t that sure about it! “They are in love with me! For real! It’s just that... life... life is complicated and...” He closed his eyes a moment, the enormous quantity of men and women who only stayed with him for a few dates before breaking.
“Ohhhhh, in love, really?” For all the discussion about adventures with men or girlfriends, having John H. Watson talking of love was quite new.
So, we just want to say that you were not apologising/talking to a random stranger, but to our friend.  It's true that for you, he's still a random stranger! We've read your discussion and we want to tell you that you didn't need to apologize, your experiences in Afghanistan are simply colouring your feelings and that's normal.  And it's his opinion also. Our friend lives an eventful life, even if it can't be compared to being a soldier, and we can say without a doubt that he's done a lot of stupid things. Sometimes we feel that he thinks that he doesn't deserve to have friends or someone special in his life, something that we felt in your profile and your blog.  Which is utterly sad. For both of you. Nobody deserves to be alone.
“Oh, Sherlock! Who is it! Do you truly like him? Is he here tonight?” The pathologist was turning on herself to look around.
The generic upscaled bodyguard look of the man who ‘asked’ him to jump in the car, the good quality shackles that hold him in place by tightening the detective to a bolt in the back of the seat (
"I know that I will give anything to be able to go back in time and be with you in front of the crowd..."  Tears were flowing freely, hidden by the rain. "Because when you are absolutely in love with someone --"
The heat was nearly unbearable near the blaze, the old bus completely destroyed by the fire. Slowly, in a nearly catatonic state, John turned to look at the people trapped inside. Screaming and crying old men, women, children
He was trying to do something with his hair, he kept it shorter than usual but it was still curly, when he heard moaning on the other side of the door, followed by sobbing and mumbling. Without hesitation, he entered the darkened room. John was in bed, fully dressed in clean clothes, in the middle of what looked like a terrible dream. Unsure of what to do, he advanced closer to the bed. He slept well last night,
“This is not over, Moran! What’s the name of your boss!” Sherlock shouts as the man places a gag over his mouth before he exits the room.
Placing his forefront on John’s head, the detective murmurs, “no you are a brilliant, passionate man, courageous, you are magnificent.”
Sad, I know :-( And not what you could have expected from a day with Juan! But do not worry, a dinner with a talkative drug lord, too much tequila and Little Mule are coming next!
“Don’t be a pussy, you’ve got nothing to do... Just give them one pill and they are going to be back for more at whatever the price!” The detective shivers with disgust as he now recognises the voice of the bastard who harassed him. “I’m going to help you, go to the Gold Swan tonight, I’m meeting the big boss intermediary.” His voice was now lace with a bit of fear, “I’ll tell them to let you in... For a certain price of course!”
Rushing thru the path, he nearly runs over a woman and her dog “Sorry!!!!” He laughs when she screams back calling him a nutter.
“Yes, sorry, I’ll leave you alone for a moment. One of Juan’s men just told me that dinner is going to be in half an hour.” Without another word, the detective walked back to his room.
Not reading the whole letter or courageous enough to click on the picture, he skips to the next email.
John, who is about to walk out of the classroom – he didn’t want the police to question him too closely – turns and watches the chemistry student who is still looking down at his bloody phone. “What did you say?” He walks back and grabs the gadget out of his hand to get his attention “How could you possibly know that?”
The detective was about to reply that he shouldn't talk about himself like that, being a doctor and an ex-captain was something to be proud of!, when he closes his phone.
Letting their bodies do the talking, the noise of the fireworks making any conversation impossible anyway, they kissed.
Anthea, watching as Sherlock's pod arrives back to the platform, presses the doors open and motions John to step in first. Closing the door after him quickly, leaving Harry, Clara and Molly outside. Thinking it was an error, he quickly bangs on the door, shouting. "What's going on? HEY!"
"Oh! Yes!" She frowns quizzically. "Blond you say? The photo, wasn't in black and white on his blog?"
With a sign from his ‘friend’, the man that is holding Sherlock lets him drop on the floor as both men run to the exit.
), John starts thinking about what he could write for today's entry. In fact, something happened yesterday.
Both a bit on their guard at the beginning, they are more relaxed now. The wine, the food, the dessert, the candles, everything is working to push them in uncharted territory.  They talk about everything, even as they both take care to avoid the carefully constructed lies.. John distracts Sherlock by his adventures in the army or from his years as a med student. The havoc his rugby team created every local they went to! Retelling stupid jokes that occurred after the 12th hour on duty or following a close called in Afghanistan.  A warmth spreads in John’s heart every time his companion smiles or laughs, when his incomparable eyes glisten in amusement. He was storing everything away, knowing instinctively that it was a privilege, that it wasn’t common for the student to be so open, so carefree.  Proud to be the one that
“No, no, of course... it’s just that it’s been a long day, but we need to keep an eye on Sherlock tonight as we finally have a lead –“
Three hours later, he is rushing to meet his chemistry classmates for lunch when it happens. A contact.
“Of course, I will not drive –” but the doctor’s protestations are lost as the vehicle left for the hospital. The fact that they didn’t on turn the emergency light was a good point.
"Oh God! Harry! Seriously too much information!" He theatrically falls back on the sofa, burying his face with a cushion. "You're my sister for God sakes!"
Dear Sleepless. I just want to say that I have been touched by the apparent similarity of our profiles. We are both scientists of some sort, my life is quite exciting sometimes and you look like someone who is in dire need of excitement. In fact, I really don't understand what you are doing in that village, as I personally can't imagine my life out of London. We both have utterly disgusting meddling siblings. We should talk if only to stop them and protecting ourselves. I may not be perfect, far from it some may say, but I think that I am a great person and that, with the right man at my side, I could aspire to become a good human being.
"At us! I was with her on that..." Clara adds, taking her wife's hand. "it's just that we worry about you."
Looking around her to be sure that no one was listening, Lucy murmurs, “It was after the exams, Smith – who used to be a model student with A+ in everything – had an E in is Chemistry’s final.”
spectacular that a sexy woman is going to stop her car! “Get in, Doctor Watson,” with a light smile she continues, “don’t worry, nothing is going to happen to you.”
He was unable to stay away, the only things he has accomplished in the last days was to think about him, then reprimand himself because he was thinking about him! The discussion with his boss, the tone of William’s brother when he asked him to leave his brother alone.
"Hey, Sherlock! How are you? Still abusing poor cadavers?" He jokes, knowing that the detective wasn't going to be mad at him.
His head was spinning, the paracetamol doing little to relieve his constant pain. But it was okay. The pain was okay. The pain was the proof that he was alive. With the last drop of energy left in him, he rises slowly helping himself into the chair near his bed. The brand new walker was right beside his bed but he didn't need it.
"Yes! The one with that doctor, ex-soldier!" As Molly remains silent, he continues. "Him! Watson! The short but strong blond man! Kind of cute." The last words were barely formed.
After pushing himself up from the ground with difficulty, emotionally and physically drained, Sherlock stood before distancing himself from his brother. Holding a hand up to keep him away now that the older vampire was also back on his feet, he whispered sadly, “leave me alone, please...” The pleading tone was so unusual that Mycroft stood silent, astonished, as his brother ran away to get a cab.
“It’s not a murder!” The detective t-shirt flies in a corner. “Moriarty! Bank of England,” He was panting a bit, trying to remove is pajama bottom while putting a shirt. “Pentonville and... the Crown Jewels!”
"We are here this afternoon to witness the joining in matrimony of Doctor John Hamish Watson and Mary Elizabeth Morstan,"
"No, no, no, don't try to..." He waves his hand in dismissal "It's... not important!" He stops talking and frowns. "Just weird."
Ordering a beer, Stamford smiled mischievously, “I will not disclose anything that I shouldn’t, but...”
Holding his cup, he thinks about the previous evening. The way he opened up to Mike about his what can only be called sentiment for William, how bad he is feeling even if he can’t ignore the fact that the beautiful witty man already has his heart.
"No it's okay, I understand." It was uncalled for, but he's so stressed out at the moment so Harry lets it slide. "You got to go out there!"
A few pints later, only one for Sherlock who wants to stay alert, the door opens to Bidget and his new ‘friend’.
Placing his hands around the glorious man neck he raises his head to be able to reach Sherlock’s perfectly plump lips and effectively stop his rambling by a small peck. “It’s okay love, I understand...”
“Or to tell me what’s going on with him if you can’t... stop yourself,” Mycroft mutters, hoping that Gregory isn’t able to hear what he is saying.
The day was going slowly, it was driving John crazy! Beside the presentation to a dozen staff members, a crash course on the informatic system they used, a coffee with the administrator of the surgery… he found the time to miss Sherlock.
"Yes, I would like to." The older man was looking at the screen, the little dot in Serbia showing the stronghold where Sherlock was probably incarcerated, only an hour's flight from Vienna.
The church was suddenly silent. The only sound audible was Sherlock light sobs as John leaves with his wife. "I shouldn't... Oh God... I spoiled his day, I want to go home now, My'... not your place. Home."
“Oh,” his cheeks turning red as they stopped in front of the ancestor of condoms, he joked, “that’s good then, you are only 3 years younger than me!”
“But of course, the traffic lights are going to be cooperative, Sir,” Anthea replies to her boss, a small smile on her otherwise straight face.
Sherlock was lost in his thoughts, still trying to understand what was expected from him in such a situation and how the complexity of dreams and flashbacks work when a discrete knock on the adjoining door between their rooms startled him. It was John, looking better now that he pushed the cobwebs away with a washcloth dipped in cold water.
"Yep. So that's it. Her ex-boyfriend was at her brother's Christmas party and they... they are ex-exes." I
"Sir, the doctor called a few minutes ago, your brother is finally fully awake and is asking for you."
Sherlock lifts his hand to stop John. He had known about John’s military record but having the man in front of you was something else He clears his throat and murmurs. “It’s not a burden. I am honoured that you opened up to me, a stranger, like that.” Considering what was okay to tell John without exposing his cover and put the doctor in danger, a faint smile appears on his beautiful luscious lips. “I have my own scars, you know, even if they are not as visible. My... my years in high school haven’t been as idyllic as yours.”
Both men remain silent for a few minutes, listening to the noises coming from the classroom. Watson’s heart is beating far too fast, his inner soldier unsettled by the idea of being in an enclosed space.
It's been nearly a week now and you  haven't replied. In fact, I need to be honest, the message was not from LondonSleuth, but from us, Greg and Molly. Both friends of the wonderful man we were talking for without his knowledge. What we said in his profile and the message that we sent was as truthful as we could make it. It's what we think he would have written for himself if he could...
"Stop protecting her, love." With a little devious edge in his tone, Mycroft shrugs and whispers. "It was quite invigorating to watch you defend my family name."
“So, you can’t ride with him then, simple as that. You are free to follow the ambulance when we are done, but the hospital won’t tell you any more as you are not related.” After a quick survey of John’s dishevelled appearance and a sniff of his breath, she frowns. “If you want to follow it, I suggest a cab or to call a friend.”
He massages the phantom pain in his leg, uncostumarily thinking about how foolish his younger self had been.
Winking a bit more effectively, the other man shook his head, “you need to go out to find someone, you are not going to just fall in the arms of a perfect partner!” Turning around, he spotted an attractive thirty-something, “go talk to her, she looks nice!”
Curious about who or what could make him say words like 'shit’, Greg asks, “what’s going on Mycroft! Is it Sherlock... a brawl, where? At the pub?” Mycroft silently rolls his eyes at the obvious question, he likes his friend dearly but sometimes...  when Donovan rushes in the office.
“But... no... YOU are perfect.” Sherlock murmured, surprised that the smaller man was now directly in front of him, separated by merely a few centimetres. Unable to stop himself, he pressed a small kiss on his head, leaving his lips in his hair.
“No, no... it’s okay,” he said as he started to breathe again, “it’s just that... except Ms Hudson, my na-, my lodger, nobody ever has done that before. It just took me by surprise. That’s all.”
"SHERLOCK!!" As the house remains silent, he rushes down to the first floor and opens the front door where Simpson was talking with one of the men that belong to his entourage. "Have you seen my brother?"
He stayed in his place until the end of the ceremony, when he saw his brother discreetly walks to join Molly and Greg.
The Shard: I place my story in the same timeline that the series, so we are in 2010 when the construction of The Shard began in 2009.
“Good afternoon, everyone,” spotting a young man with crutches in the second row he smiles.“Hamilton, happy to see that you’re back with us, let me know if you have questions about anything from the last few classes.” Dropping his bag under the desk, he logs onto his laptop and after a moment, the first slide appears on the white wall facing him. “Any question about last week’s session?” As a chorus of ‘no’ dies down, he continues “Today, we’re going to talk about blunt trauma and – even if I am glad that Hamilton tried to give us a very fine example – I can assure you that It’s not as fun as it may sound!” Everyone giggles and shouts good-hearted jokes at the poor student, as Watson sits on the desk and starts his lecture.
John is finally leaving his place and ready to call a cab when a posh black car stops in front of him. A beautiful woman, unknown to him, opens the door and motion him to get inside.
And now he found himself on a temporary leave from work with full salary and benefits without an official return date, thanks to Mycroft probably.
This is how Mycroft found him, twenty minutes later. Kneeling beside him without a thought about his immaculate trousers, he placed a comforting hand on his younger brother’s shoulder. “First know that your doctor is safely back home, the sedative was mild and didn’t leave any lasting symptoms. His...” he paused a moment, “his small wounds have been taken care of.”  As the younger man remained silent and was still shaking, Mycroft sighed and sat carefully near Sherlock, back pressed against the cold brick wall.
Checking his phone, he read a few articles regarding the relationship between vampires and blood, without finding anything helpful. Looking at his browser history, he chuckled on how single-minded his searches had become over the last few days!
"You read that, oh, god!" Opening the door, he grins as the comforting warmth of the pub engulfs them.
"Yes, but nonetheless, they were a stronger couple than my so-called wife and I would ever be... you know that I asked for a divorce? Shit, we didn't last two years..." Tears appeared in his eyes as the poem John post on his blog before shutting it down spring in his mind.
Indulging him with a small smile, she protests, “You know it kind of freaks me out when you do that.”
Coming back after he walked away a bit to get a chair, the ex-soldier sits in front of John. “Sorry, doctor, did I hit a nerve?” Placing his phone on the floor at the right of his chair, he moves closer to  John with purpose. “It’s the only proof we need, you were spying on us, trying to be the avenger for his wife or his mother... or maybe you were in love with him, I won’t judge, but you went too far, mate and now you know us so –”
"Okay." John, still confused, turns his wrist to get Sherlock's attention. "But why are you holding my hand?"
Blinded by his exasperation, one of his few flaws, he didn’t realize that Bidget, full of self-confidence following his meeting, is standing behind him. Until an heavy hand drops on his shoulder.
"Oh, Gregory..." With a sob, the imperturbable man finally broke in his lover's arms. "What they have done to him... it's horrible. I don't even know... if he's going to be okay."
“Get inside,” the doctor playfully pushes his friend thru the door, “I’m going to need alcohol to talk about this!”
"There is the possibility that you are going to have a wonderful time, did you ever think about that?"
"John!" Greg was walking in the direction of the man he hopes is still his friend. "Can I talk to you a second?"
A few hours later, he seriously doesn’t remember that much now, John tried to walk up the stairs to his floor without killing himself.
, but the look on Holmes’ face was priceless. “Have you told him the fact that you’re a drug addict as well?”
Getting a table, he waits as Stamford asks the bartender for two pints.  Looking at his old friend, John was honestly pleased with the happy coincidence.
Thinking about his still fragile brother, who was starting to talk about going back to Baker Street but Mycroft was against the idea, the younger man protests, "I know that he's doing better, that the therapist has helped a lot with his nightmares, but he's not ready!"
He is lost in his thoughts and has been walking for more than an hour when someone calling his name brought it back to reality. Looking around him, he was in the middle of a square, he spots the grinning face of an old classmate. "Stamford?"
The heat is unbearable, the day long and monotonous... A day like dozens of other days since he had arrived in Afghanistan. Looking at the horizon, he isn’t really paying attention to the light banter of the others, too exhausted to laugh at their silly jokes or crude comments about whatever they are talking about. The sun, disappearing behind the mountains, is beautiful and soothing. Hypnotic. Everything is perfect for a second or two.
"That's my line, John, you're the one who... anyway, I wasn't supposed to come here, but as I am... I just need to know that you are not busy drinking yourself into oblivion or something like that. But, you are obviously doing fine." John's heartbeats accelerate as his friend leans over him. "Eating waffles... no American pancakes."
“John,” he murmured, “you need to get up you are having a nightmare.” When the doctor’s agitation didn’t diminish, he repeated, louder. “Watson, wake up!” Unaware that the dream was becoming even worse because of his presence, Sherlock placed a hand on the ex-soldier's shoulder and called once more, “you are dreaming, wake up John!” The look of horror on John’s face when he finally woke up was something that the detective didn’t see coming.
I half expect you to smell different, corrupted by the hormones and the joint DNA of the foreign thing swimming around in you. You don’t. Somehow, it’s almost worse. You mistake my choked noise (weak, stupid) for pain, and grip me more firmly, your navy eyes all concern, at 18 centimetres away.
‘I love this,’ she said, teeth scraping against my stomach, ‘delightful.’ I laughed, and she sucked on the skin. When she ran her tongue along the waistband of my pants I whimpered.
‘Sherlock?’ his alarm at the sound overcame any desultory respect for privacy, and John turned the door handle, only to find an empty bedroom and an open window. In the distance, a seagull cried.
This was one of the men who’d been on the dating site, who Sherlock had insisted on picking apart from his profile alone.
, and has been using that to distract her from the blackmarket knickers trade he's been running from her flat.'
Fucking Sherlock. Ah, sorry, not actually the verb, obviously. Bloody late. Should’ve known, actually – I’d got her text when I was halfway there that’d said ‘the name’s Fielder, by the way SH’. Should’ve known it meant that whatever she was up to had held her up, and I ought to go in on my own. It’s been half an hour, so I give the name and am let in. And it’s like a horrible crush of tall people, exactly as suspected. Oh well. Hopefully I will be able to hear my phone, hopefully will be able to elbow my way through the people, in case Sherlock’s business actually held her up in something actually problematic. I make my way over to the bar, trying to note something about the people on the way, not sure of where will be the most Sherlock-convenient place to stand in, pretty much hoping I get a text that says something to the effect of ‘Joan help, am trapped somewhere far away from the crowded posho bar, give up that plan and come at once SH’, but obviously that doesn’t happen, and there I am nursing a drink and taking cover next to an ornamental palm (happily the name ‘Fielder’ has an open tab, leading me to assume that ‘Fielder’ is actually Mycroft’s account, which Mycroft probably doesn’t know about it. Cocktail it is then).
He and Sherlock had been talking. Well, Sherlock had, just now. John had been watching dusk fall across his friend’s face. The sky behind him in the window was rosy, with a sort of lilac colour now across the fields, a late spring sunset. This was the kind of light that made the years fuzzy, blended the past with the present, reminded him even of the first times they’d spent together.
That’s right. Even though she clearly knows enough about these things to be able to deduce a crime of passion from a few fingernail clippings, not to mention keeping Sean the PA strung along for several months.
Consider starting a conversation with the palm tree, check the phone, survey the crowd again. No one seems particularly dodgy, or anything useful. There are a particularly high percentage of well dressed men here. Loads of them bridging on the ridiculously young, which is somewhat disheartening (I must be getting old. Am I getting old? I never used to notice people being too young, and now they’re everywhere). Actually, now that I’m looking around, I notice there’s a smartly dressed chappy with a trendy, stubbly sort of beard just down the bar from me who’s clearly doing the same thing I’m doing – staring off into the crowd and avoiding people. It makes me smile a bit – always a relief that you’re not the only crazy one in the house. I check my phone again. Still no word from bloody Sherlock. I send her another text. ‘Still inside, let me know when you get here. Alright?’
), it is all-pervasive, overwhelming, and blinding-- the virus in the operating system, the solar storm that skews every instrument. When I was younger it seemed to pour into me from every outside source I encountered, and I could feel everything, all at once, and none of it was mine, and none of it made any sense. It was overwhelmingly horrible. Obviously it was preferable - vital, even - to eschew it. Obviously, I sometimes fail at this task, and frequently, of late, as evidenced by the doctor in my sitting room, and the tortured hessian cloth that used to be my back; by the bullet-hole in my chest, and perhaps most indicatively, by the accompanying metaphysical void that makes it difficult to breath with any conviction. Particularly in the presence of the aforementioned doctor.
‘Oh for fuck’s sake. Sherlock!’ John stormed to the window, and was relieved to find no one below it, at least. A thin film of smoke from above indicated that the room’s erstwhile inhabitant was, in fact, on the roof of the neighbouring room-extension. Cursing, John scrambled to crouch on the windowsill, coming eye to eye with the detective’s toes on the adjacent overhang.
There you are. My mind short circuits for a moment when I see your changed form, jacket opened on either side of your protruding abdomen. Stupid of me, I’d forgotten you were pregnant. Not forgot. It’s just the Joan in my mind hasn’t quite caught up. I doubt she will. I would liken it to the shadows in Plato’s cave, but it’s clearly somewhat of the reverse – she’s the shadow, and you’re the true form, regardless of whether that form happens to be host to a… well, someone else.
. The problem is, I trust you with your death as much as I trusted you with my life. It crushes me every time, with a crippling physical pain that shouldn’t be possible. And I should know, I’ve been shot. You are gone. I know this, but some part of me can never know it. My eyes have always been a cracked sort of dark blue, I know this too, but when I look in the mirror, all I see is the endless grey behind you on the day you fell.
The trying works at first, until the morphine of denial wears off. Then the doubt grows deeper and deeper, a darkness slipping in from the edges of my consciousness until it is everywhere. It was my fault, I should have saved you.
‘I’m gonna… take my jeans off, if that’s ok? They’re sort of uncomfortable… in bed. I can run and get my pyjama’s if you-‘ Sherlock shot me a look that made it more than apparent that pyjamas were not only unnecessary, but their presence would be found offensive. ‘Ok, just offering.’ I took off my jeans, fighting the urge to turn my back and do it, ‘sorry about the er floral knickers.’ I saw Sherlock’s lip twitch.
‘I’m not cuddling, I’m taking advantage of the benefits you offer to my limbic system,’ she would have sounded more scandalised if she hadn’t been contentedly worming her way even closer to me, so our legs were now knotted up as well.
Once those words were out, the rest flowed out. He wanted to show Sherlock how weak he truly was. “I wanted to dig a knife into my arm until blood dripped through the floorboards. I wanted unconsciousness to envelope me.”
“Yeah, I’ll have the curry,” he sighed, watching as the pale man across the street stretched in the center of his living room. He wore a dark red dressing gown. John noted that it too had a dramatic flair. The man must be a bit of a drama queen, John thought to himself. His food order was on its way, but rather than get the money from his wallet, he continued to observe the curly haired man as he leapt onto the couch and threw himself on his back. He pressed his hands in mock prayer and pressed the tips of his fingers to his lips.
John left his gun lying on the cleaning rag on his bed as he went to bathe and change. Finally into a pair of dark jeans and his beige jumper, he reloaded his gun and slid it into the back of his pants. John limped into the kitchen, glanced over into the other flat to still find it empty, and proceeded to make himself tea.
“Count wha-” John’s fist to his face interrupted him. John eyed him expectantly. Tears sprung to Victor’s eyes; blood dripped from his nose and mouth.
Sherlock did not answer and stared quietly back at him. “Hm, I guess not,” Victor said to himself. “Aren’t you lonely, Sherlock? Has he been mistreating you?”
Sherlock hurriedly shoved a whole spring roll in his mouth. He was actually incredibly hungry, but he was mostly trying to turn John’s interest away. John laughed and claimed his own box, immediately tucking into it. Sherlock was halfway through his spring rolls when John offered him a bite of his sesame chicken. Sherlock stared at the offered piece on the fork. John waited patiently. Maybe it was his chance to tell John that he certainly was inclined to accept his post-dinner offer. Sherlock leaned in and took the piece whole, dragging his mouth down to the tines. He finished his bite and swiped his tongue across his bottom lip. John’s mouth had fallen open. Sherlock finished his plate, licking his thumb and leaving it to linger in his mouth. John drank the last bit of his tea in one gulp and put down his mug a little too hard. Sherlock met his eyes with a suggestive lift of his eyebrow.
Across the street, a young man swooped in, heavy Belstaff coat swirling about his slender figure. He whipped off his blue scarf and tossed it haphazardly over the couch followed by his coat. The man was dressed sharply in a well-tailored suit and light blue button down. Over by the window, he sat down at a desk and lifted crime scene photographs. Several moments had passed before he jumped up again and began pacing his living space, spouting sentences into the empty air.
Sherlock whipped back around in irritation. “Oh, what now? I’m in shock! Look, I’ve got a blanket!” He brandished the blanket, waving the sides about.
“You,” Sherlock glanced away for a second before returning to John’s concerned gaze. “In my mind palace, you were as Moriarty: cruel and cold. I had to fix the data, or you would remain trapped as Moriarty’s minion. I had collected data that allowed Moriarty to worm his way in. I had to delete the file that corrupted you.”
John spent more of his time at 221B while Sherlock healed. He was certain that it was because of his worry for Sherlock and not because of his fear of Mary. Because really, he was a soldier after all. If he thought Mary posed a real threat to him, he would hope that he would be able to disarm and subdue her fairly quickly.
Sherlock stood and aimed the pistol at John while he held the revolver at him. Sherlock glanced quickly at the paper as the flame died down, leaving less than half of it burned.
John stepped back into the sitting room and faced the windows once more, eyes scanning the room. He reached for his Sig just to remember that it was upstairs in his bedside table. John’s eyes landed on the stack of cold case files on the desk. Sherlock had said that he didn’t get through as many as he liked.
Upstairs, he put away everything and decided to strip into his sleepwear and robe sooner than the night called for. He slid his gun back in its drawer. Today was his first day fully “assimilated” back into civilian life- flat, job, and grocery runs. It was a bit exhausting, and quite honestly, rather boring.
They had stopped to eat at their regular Indian restaurant. The staff was excited to see them in person after delivering so many takeaway orders in the past couple of years. It was the first time since knowing John that Sherlock had eaten more than him. John had prodded his tandoori chicken until the server came to see if there was anything wrong.
With his head swimming in thoughts, he sat up, swaying a bit with the rush of blood. Sherlock recoiled the belt and went to put it in the exact spot John had left it in. His own breaths sounded like bees in his ears. He opened one of the drawers and ran his fingers over jumpers and button downs, reveling in the gentleness he normally associated with John. Sherlock slipped out of his worn tee and held a beige cable-knit sweater to his neck. John’s cheap soap clung to it with just a hint of his cologne and sweat. Sherlock pulled it over his head. His heated skin was smothered by the coolness of the jumper. Sherlock smoothed his hands over his hair.
When John had met Mary, he was hardly the man he used to be before Sherlock’s death. He had changed after the war, but now, he was nothing without the detective. His permanent scowl made his patients uneasy, and when the practice had threatened to let him go, he disappeared into a three-day drunken haze. He had spent so many years fighting the vice that had taken hold of his family, but how could he fight any more when there was nothing to live for?
John reached his hand out for the other man, but Sherlock stepped away. “Don’t think you’re the only one who has suffered from battle.”
“How could you say no?” John bent forward and kissed the raised handprint. Sherlock’s skin prickled at the sweetness of John’s mouth. John trailed his lips down Sherlock’s arse, flicking his tongue out to tease at the warm skin and crouching down to be level with that delectable pale arse. As John neared his tight puckered heat, Sherlock’s back arched and his breaths came faster. Pleasure jolted through his body once John’s lips made gentle contact. A high-pitched whine escaped his tightened lips as John’s tongue flicked out. It felt absolutely filthy, defiling Sherlock like this, but John wouldn’t have it any other way with Sherlock trembling against him. John flattened his tongue against Sherlock’s arsehole, dragging it long and slow. John tightened a hand on Sherlock’s hip to keep him still. Sweat dotted Sherlock’s hairline. John dipped the tip of his tongue into the ring of muscle. Sherlock tensed.
This man that had once despised him for the things he’s said and done, and now stares into his eyes like he was made of starlight.
John immediately called for EMS. Sherlock’s heartbeat was rapid and his breathing shallow. Tears stung behind his eyes as he yelled for Mrs. Hudson.
“No. I don’t think he had them when he approached me.” Lestrade pulled into the parking lot of Tesco and cut the engine.
“Can you walk?” Sherlock nodded. “Right.” John was about to open the stall door when he grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “Did you enjoy yourself?”
“Your tan line doesn’t go past your wrists, suggesting that you’ve been out in the sun for long periods of time but with considerable sleeves. I noticed when you held the pan up to me. The way you stand is poised by military standards. You work at St. Bart’s and introduce yourself as “Doctor,” so you’re obviously a military doctor. So which is it: Afghanistan or Iraq?” Mycroft rolled his eyes once more. His brother the show off.
Sherlock stepped back and draped his coat over the stool. “I don’t see why not,” Sherlock laughed with his arms spread. He looked delicious as always dressed in dark blue. “If it’s a matter of cleanliness, don’t worry. I sterilized the lab this morning.” John stared at him in disbelief.
“I have not figured out what exactly it is that I want to say, quite frankly, but I do want to clear any questions that you may have.” Sherlock closed his eyes for a long time before speaking in a firm voice.
John saw through his bullshit. “No you didn’t. It’s how you get your kicks, isn’t it? You risk your life to prove you’re clever.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. He didn’t need to think about what he needed to say. What he needed was the courage to say it all. John sat nervously at his side, but thankfully didn’t try to rush him. Sherlock spoke toward the wall, scared to catch a glimpse of John’s reaction to what he was about to say. He hoped that John would manage to keep his body as still as possible. The hand in his would be enough to reveal how the other man felt about all this.
“You know that doesn’t make me feel any better. I think you’ve proved time and time again that you’re the one the Yard should worry about.”
Sherlock stared at him, dumbfounded. He rose from the tub and wrapped a towel around his waist, flicking his wet hair out of his eyes.
, John thought. Had John decided to give him a chance, maybe he would have landed a couple of licks, but those who put their hands on Sherlock didn’t deserve a chance. As soon as someone is able to lay a hand on the detective, John knows that they are certainly worthy of getting the dog shit kicked out of them.
Sherlock stood suddenly with his hands behind his back. “Get your head out of your arse, Mycroft. It was a minor occurrence and will not be happening again as the issue has been resolved. Now, if you please,” he motioned to the door.
It took a John a bit longer than normal to get himself hard. He thought about previous conquests and naked women, but the eyes of that stranger would flash into his mind and make him bit his lower lip in frustration. How could those eyes have such a lasting effect on him? They were just eyes, silly. But John knew in his sex mottled brain that they were different. He didn’t exactly understand why or how, but he just knew. Another ten minutes had passed, and the blond haired man was finally able to push out that glacial stare from his head. Just a few more tugs had him easing himself through his orgasm with a soft grunt. Not one of his stronger ones, but one that will definitely get sleep going.
“What I was thinking about-” John rolled his eyes and was about to turn back to the counter when Sherlock’s trembling voice continued.
John took a quick sip of his water before going to check Sherlock’s room. He stepped into the kitchen and was stunned to see a dark curly haired figure sitting hunched over at their table. The usual cool crispness of their kitchen was different, almost sticky warm from humidity. John’s eyes fell on the water dripping from Sherlock’s coat to the growing puddle on the floor.
“I’ll do everything I can to make sure you two are safe from the law. However, you’re not making my job any easier.” John smirked to himself. Lestrade was a good man, and John hoped that one day he would repay him this kindness.
Lestrade was about to say something snarky, but Sherlock bounded out of his bedroom with his air-dried coat swinging around his shoulders.
“When I wasn’t in a rush and really want to relish my high, I used this. It wasn’t about the high, but the act rather. I haven’t used it in awhile.”
John could see the small tooth-wide gashes in his knuckles from Victor’s mouth, and fuck, the way his skin reopened when he clenched his fist tight enough gave him cool shivers through his spine. The adrenaline left his hands shaking, but John thought every tremor was worth the trouble. His pistol was electric against his skin; aiming his sights on a target always left it feeling like a living thing, vibrating with energy.
“What can I get for fifty?” The other man laughed obnoxiously- a nasally sound that grated John’s nerves.
“Oh,” was all Sherlock could muster. John looked at his shoes. Sherlock looked at the IV in his hand for a moment before speaking again.
John was at the counter when a pair of hands encircled his torso, palms lying flat against the planes of his chest. Sherlock pressed into his back and nuzzled his shoulder. John bared his neck for the taller man. Sherlock took his offering and trailed his lips over John’s skin, leaving slight pecks along the way. John braced himself on the counter when Sherlock spoke into his ear, velvety baritone vibrating through his body.
Sherlock’s anger flared. “I do not understand what it is that makes you think you could have stopped this.”
Thirty minutes later, John was once again eating alone, pushing around his food in the Styrofoam plate. He didn’t notice that he was staring off in the direction of the flat across the street until Sherlock came in a flurry once again. He whipped off his coat and scarf and settled in the middle of the room. He stared at the wall behind the couch for several moments before throwing his hands up and turning toward the window. John jerked his body away, ready to jump and hide in case Sherlock caught him staring once more, but the other man just bent down and picked up a violin. He watched as the other closed his eyes and began to play. John wasn’t sure what he was watching exactly- a performance or a man so invested in what was between his fingers, he seemed entranced. John focused on the man’s swaying head, oblivious to the world around him. The outside world seemed to blur. He was standing in the flat across the street, watching this strange human go from a whirring hurricane to slow oceanic waves all with the touch of a violin. John found himself biting his lower lip and growing hard in his jeans as he watched those fingers, long and artistic, float across the neck of the violin. His toes curled in his socks. He couldn’t tolerate it anymore. He hurried into his room, threw off his clothing and tugged himself hard on the bed. He fucked his own fist, imagining that it was Sherlock’s deft fingers around his cock rather than his trigger ones. He came with a silent yelp, arching his back off the bed.
John took a seat in the decently plush chair against the wall in the living room with the newspaper. It faced the window and gave him a pretty view of Sherlock Holmes, the curt violinist from across the way. He raised the paper up to cover his face, but no matter how much he wanted to read, or rather, pretend to read, he couldn’t manage to tear his eyes away from Sherlock. The man looked brilliant in the way he stood with his shoulders pinned back in that wonderfully tailored suit of his, dark curls surrounding and softening those sharp angles on his face.
John slid his hand up the wall, gripping his cane in the other, as he made his way up the steps to his new flat. With his new position at St. Bart’s hospital and his army pension, he figured he would be able to afford a slightly bigger and more comfortable flat than the one he previously resided in. When he finally unlocked the door, he stepped in with held breath.
The front door opened again and let in the biting wind from outside. Plenty of party-goers hissed and complained at the slender man walking through. John could recognize that mop of curls in a crowd of fifty-thousand. Sherlock didn’t lower his collar or unwind himself from that bloody dramatic coat until he flopped himself down in front of John.
Sherlock lay on the bed dressed in only an old grey shirt and dark blue bottoms, foam and vomit dribbling from his mouth as his body convulsed. His silk dressing gown pooled around him.
John couldn’t believe his eyes. The sight of Sherlock leaning back against his arm, fucking his own hand, sweat matting his curls to his forehead was an incredible image. John wished he had a mind palace of his own just to save this picture of Sherlock Holmes. No one else would get to see him like this. The flush across Sherlock’s cheeks and chest was a deep red. He panted hard as he reached his climax. Ribbons coated his abdomen and hand as his body trembled.
Okay, so I haven't gone through and proofread this chapter, so please do not hesitate to comment on any discrepancies with the previous chapters and misspellings, and all that jazz.
Sherlock frowned harder. “I’m thinking about how long you are taking to touch me.” John’s grin spread ear to ear as he bent down to take Sherlock’s mouth again, lowering his knees to the sofa and straddling Sherlock’s hips. John ground his cock into Sherlock’s taut stomach. He licked his way into Sherlock’s mouth before leaning back to observe the flush high on Sherlock’s cheeks. His mouth was red and wet, and it was a rare thing to see: Sherlock’s composure broken. He had seen the smooth mask of indifference slip from is face at Baskerville and again, at his wedding. It had been the slightest change in his eyes, the sadness in which he looked at him, knowing that their time for a deeper and more intimate relationship had passed. John imagines that it was upsetting to Sherlock when he had to throw himself off Bart’s; he may not have seen his face, but Sherlock’s voice had wavered on the phone, the ball forming in his throat. John doesn’t want to think of that, though, and if he had a mind palace of his own, he would shove it away in the basement, because to him, to not be there for Sherlock when he was most vulnerable, was more painful than the gunshot to his shoulder.
