After what seemed like an eternity, but had only been the day, the sun dwindled and fell into the night. Twilight welcomed the vampires on the roof. Tony watched as the wraith next to the other vampire swayed in the coming dark as if dancing to unheard music. He only turned to his body, so broken, so decayed and desiccated. What was left was a dried-out husk, bones and little flesh hung on the wooden cross. Nothing about the thing kneeling bound to the cross looked at all like Tony. It was a dead thing. And he was cursed to it, for all time. As he stood and watched the night city come to life, the door to the building opened and his assailants returned but without Rumlow. They wheeled a gurney with them.
He staggers backward and falls into the snow. When Tony tries to talk to him, he’s spent and overcome with his revelation as if the words that poured out of him to Tony had actually been the first time he’d recognized them himself. Tony lies there for a second, the songs of the birds the only noise other than Steve’s harsh breathing.
Tony took that as his cue. The heat in his chest amplified and he spread his hands out in front of him. The beam of energy shot out, bursting forth and burning away their enemies and leaving only devastation in his path. All of the agents fell. Tony swallowed down the sickness, but the idea that he could be such a killer swam over him like a swarm of locust, eating away at his sanity. He was a member of the undead – that didn’t make him an absolute killer. Yet his power, his transformation – what else was it but naming him the harbinger of death? He staggered, numb with the power and the realization of what and who he had become.
“A sweetheart,” Tony says and ambles down the last two steps. “That’s nice; she come with you out West?”
Shrugging he says, “The name?”
“Just for dinner.” When Tony frowned at him, Steve only smiled. “Just joking. Meal’s on me. I’ll send you the address to the restaurant. It’s in Brooklyn. Hope you don’t mind.”
“I don’t know what you mean? Like if you were a snake or a rabbit?” Tony scratches Blu behind his ear.
“You went to bed at like four in the afternoon yesterday. You must have been beat.” Steve waves the mug of coffee like a carrot in front of a horse. “I made coffee to see if it would revive you.”
They adjourned with the intention of heading directly to Steve’s room. Sam stopped both Tony and Bucky by standing in the doorway, arms crossed and a decided glower to his expression.
“No. It’s a work in progress. Everything you’re doing is awe inspiring. The world shouldn’t lose that.” Steve’s tone is earnest and pleading. The gulls are cawing, crying out, in the background, giving credence to his speech.
“First, we eat. Even dead we need to eat,” she says and there’s a melancholy about her words.
Another slam against his palms and the spikes drove home. Tony cried out, knowing the blood tears streaked his face. He gulped and gasped unneeded air. The whirl of the air in his lungs expanded and hurt from the inside out like a firestorm in his chest. The arm around his neck tightened and he gurgled and choked.
“I will see what we have.”
Steven measured his words before he stated, “When you were a child, or a teen, did Estane show special interest in you? Did he act like a father to you?”
Tony’s hand brushes down his cheek. “You left because of me?” His tone breaks.
Tony places a single finger on Steve’s lips. “Shush, I know.”
Tony sits up and hovers over Steve as he reclines. “You are a regular superhero.”
“You can’t ask someone to fake date you, Tony,” Pepper is saying. “He could report you for sexual harassment.”
“And that’s what I mean,” Tony said. “If I’m having misgivings about it then you, you have to be.”
"Tony, I told you I'm fine. Put on the suit."
“I’m not used to it,” Steve says but lets the prince lead him back to the living room. He has to admit, he feels better than he did right after the shocks that Rumlow gave him, but still a little shaky if he thinks about it too much. As they enter the living room, the heavy aroma of food hits him and his stomach protests loudly. Tony arches a brow at him.
“He accepts you, they all do,” Steve says and finds a comfort in his own words. Here in this sanctuary, he’s found acceptance and belief that he can be happy in his skin.
“I certainly hope so,” Steven says and turns to Tony. “Would you like me to pour the wine?”
Part of him was hollowed out, empty and silent. It yearned for more, for connection, for fulfillment. A tendril reached out, seeking and longing, and he couldn’t follow it, couldn’t see the end. Yet even as he investigated this inner corner of his own soul, he saw himself denying it, reconstructing it so that he could pretend it didn’t want something different, something unheard of, something wrong. He closed it down and when he did that part shriveled and curled up as if desiccated and dying. There was no rhythm, no song, no part of a pack. Part of his soul slowly succumbed to a kind of death.
“What? Wait? I can’t sleep?” Steve says. “No, that’s not right. Tony I’m exhausted. I’m not the kind of person who stays up all night and doesn’t have an issue with it. I need sleep.” A part of him internally screams. His eyes burn with fatigue.
“I could help you.”
“People seem to forget the most I knew about the serum I screwed up royally. So, I have no explanation. We called in Wong and Strange. They’re coming over,” Bruce said and then checked his old-fashioned wristwatch. Why the hell he wore one, Tony couldn’t fathom – it had to be ruined anytime he turned into the Hulk. Bruce continued. “In just about 20 minutes they are expected to arrive.”
Steve watched him. He placed his napkin on the table, dusted off his hands. “It’s for the best, Tony. Everyone, all of you. I’m trying to save our pack the only way I know how.” He looked over to the rest of the pack. “You all think I have it together. That I have the answer, that somehow, I can make this pack work. I have no idea what I’m doing.” He shifted gears, abruptly. “Look out the window. Look at that. I don’t know what’s coming. I don’t know who they are.”
“Best we get moving?” Tony asks.
It took weeks for him to become fully conscious again. He suspected someone nursed him back to health. He’s not sure who it was – whether it was one of the cursed humans or one of the Legion. He wished to die then, and sometimes he still does.
Setting a small propane heater on the floor of the Quin Jet, Steve preps it to light when Tony stops him.
“Yeah, yeah.” He touches the pages tenderly, a treasuring his creation. “Just a little idea I had.”
He scans the underground garage and spots the helmets for the motorcycle. This is all kinds of wrong, he knows that, but he cannot say no to Tony. Everything from this point forward in his life will be centered on Tony. His fulcrum, his true North, Steve finally comprehends the idea of it. What it all means. It’s as if he’s walked through an envelope separating his old life from the new one – the present one. He never wants to go back. This is where he belongs. He squeezes Tony’s hand and brings him along as he grabs the helmets.
“More and you can get me to come,” Steve whines and jerks against Tony. The filling of his hole and the teasing of his nipples sends Steve into a rash of need. He grabs onto Tony’s hair as he bends to taste and nip. He jerks against Tony, trying to get the right feel against his prostate and he’s almost there, so wanting and needy but Tony stops and glances up at him. A strange and wicked look crosses his expression.
Tony arches a brow and replies, “Tonight it is.”
“Bucky, I’m still the same person. I swear it. I swear it.” Tears welled in his eyes as he tried to reason with Bucky, as the ache in his belly exploded and he struggled to stay on his feet.
Tony drops his fork. “Why not? He’s my plus one.”
“Sorry, just not used to it. Back in the day, it wasn’t polite to address someone by their first name if you didn’t know them,” Steve said, his voice stayed strong – no faltering at the mention of his lost days.
Sharon stays to herself and only half heartedly interacts with anyone. Once in while she talks to Steve but it’s more businesslike than anything else. She’s kind to her clients because she always walks them out and kisses their cheeks as they leave.
Bruce put up his hands in surrender. “I’m just trying to get a hold of the situation.”
“Please button up,” Tony says and then tugs on his own jacket. Steven follows his command and then gets to his feet when Tony indicates he can do so. “I reserve the right to drink later, of course.”
He shrugged, though she couldn’t see it at the time, since the metal body hardly allows such a subtle gesture to be communicated. “I’m on it, Pepper, I am.”
“Well, it is a very big bathtub.” Steve coughs up some water and prays his meds stayed in place.
“But I left you behind,” Tony weeps. The words come out garbled, but it doesn’t matter – there’s no one here to hear them. Tony’s always alone. Alone with his billions. How does it feel to be a billionaire? Money can buy yachts and mansion and the best of everything, but it can’t buy him what he needs.
“See? Now you know you do want to sleep with him,” Thor snickers. He searches the cupboards to no avail. “No coffee. This is a disgrace.”
Bruce relents. “Sure, Tony.”
“How about we eat our fries and then maybe watch a movie?” Tony says. He rubs Steve’s back.
“Rogers had another seizure. It’s all over the internet,” Reed says. JARVIS plops down a holograph interface with Reed standing in what looks like his lab in the Baxter building. He doesn’t look arrogant, just contrite and a little sad. “I talked to him a little about realities. Different realities.”
“I know there isn’t one. I used to think there could be. Some benevolent creator. I hoped there was one.” She put her sandwich down and tears gathered in her eyes ran down her face as she bowed her head. “Not after this. Not after that.” She looked behind her at the bio-division building. It had a large sculpture of the helical structure of DNA (twisting in the wrong direction) in front of it. “That – what they do – what
The doors opened. Agents lined the rooftop. In the distance, in the sky, Tony saw the glimmer of a Helicarrier. They’d brought in the big guns. Natasha had calculated wrong. They would all die. The agents aimed their guns. It wouldn’t slow Tony down, or Natasha, but Clint and Steve would die. Then the agents would get close enough – they would set the place ablaze with the Helicarrier’s guns. Tony stepped out of the elevator, gave one last backward glance to his mate and love, and then dropped his head back, allowing the fire inside to consume him.
“I said I’m good,” Tony snaps back. He waits a moment before he continues. “Besides, someone has to help me out here.”
“Do that, do that again,” Tony sobbed.
Tony bows his head, leaning against Steve’s abdomen. Running his hands through the prince’s hair, he asks, “What happened?”
No one said
“That, something like that would happen to you, if you did this with me?” Tony says and swallows visibly.
His gland.
“Good so far. Only one night. The prince has meetings all day today. So I won’t see him until tonight.”
"We will be installing the new arm, as well as connecting it to your brain and nervous system all at the same time. That way you only have to go under once for the procedure." Setting his coffee mug down, Tony leaned against the edge of the table. "We'll still have to run calibrations on it afterward, but it should be in full working order when you wake up."
"Do you know where Steve is?" Natasha gently asked.
Howard's eyes widened in shock as his gaze snapped to his son. "What?"
Howard waited until his son disappeared in the elevator before letting out a relieved breath. "Jarvis, call Maria."
"Hey, easy there."
Over the years, Tony had managed to keep a pretty good handle on his hormone levels. Between board meetings and cooking with his mother, he was usually able to keep them within optimal levels. However, on occasion, he would need to contact Sub Services for a more intense session. He hated doing so. One of the subs that went down for him early on went straight to the press and began spreading lies about him. Now the world considered him a playboy and a Dom who would do absolutely anything with a sub. In reality, he could count on one hand the number of times he'd slept with someone. Instead, he was saving as much of himself as he could for his soulmate sub.
"I know. I'll take care of things until you get back. Let me know if you need anything."
"But what if ..." Steve looked to his lap and drew in several shuddering breaths.
A soft voice broke through his panic.
"You get many other visitors out her?" Coulson asked. He heard Tony's and Clint's laughter behind him despite the wind.
"I have all the required measurements but didn't get the cast of Bucky's shoulder. I gotta have that before I can finalize the specs for his arm." Tony let out a long breath. "I'm also waiting on the shipment from Wakanda."
"Come on. You're covered in sweat and I'm sure you're hungry too." Tony tugged Steve inside and to the elevator. Jarvis began the ascent to their floor without a word.
Although he wished to grab a sketch pad and settle into the armchair to draw, Steve nodded and reluctantly followed Bucky from the room.
Ooohhh, Tony's making something for Steve. What do you think it is?
Setting the tray on the low table within easy reach of Bucky, Steve noted the luxurious pillow on the floor at Bucky's feet. Without hesitation, Steve sank to his knees on the pillow with a soft sigh. His eyes closed as he slipped further under, all the cares of the last few days slowly slipping away as relaxed into Bucky's care.
"I thought for sure the bastard would be dead by now."
Sliding his phone back into his pocket, Coulson proceeded into the elevator.
"I'm here, Stevie. I'm alive and well all thanks to you. You did so good. You protected me when I couldn't do so myself. You always take such good care of me. We're safe now." Bucky kept up a litany of praise and comforting words. It took several minutes, but he finally sensed Steve relaxing into his embrace.
Tony frowned at Steve's tired voice. "You alright, Babe?"
"Security breach!" Tony pointed at Coulson with a glare.
Bucky peered to his right where a man with a kind smile and curly brown hair stood by medical equipment.
"No. There is no physical reason why he hasn't woken up yet. I can only speculate that he isn't ready to face the world again. His brain may be protecting him so to speak. He may not wake until he senses he is in a safe place."
"Deal."
"I've talked Tony into joining us for dinner."
"Sir, you have a visitor."
By time they arrived in New York, the ice around the soldiers was mostly melted. Once they were in the medical wing, they would be separated. Doctor Cho would handle Barnes and get him into surgery as soon as possible while Bruce would oversee things with Rogers.
"What other Stark is there?"
"I will pass along the message."
Steve's muscles went rigid at the mention of a doctor. He swallowed hard and his words came out in a whisper. "Buck ... I can't ..."
Moments later Henderson strode into the room. Steve could tell without looking that Henderson was muscular, commanded attention, and wouldn't accept anything but complete submission.
"President Barack Obama is presently in office. He is the first black man to become POTUS."
- I'm totally making up Howard's back story because I can.
Steve tapped one of the images and drew his hands apart in the air, blowing it up to see the details more clearly. "I count three transformers."
"Open."
Steve gasped for air as the memories of the cold surrounded him. He shuddered, his eyes distant as his heart raced. Without thought he pulled the feeding tube out and tossed it across the room.
"I have never in my life seen such a large bed!" Bucky exclaimed as they stepped back through the bedroom and headed for the hall.
After several long moments of silent contemplation, Steve nodded his head. "Fine, but the first time something feels off, we're finding our own place."
Tony began to slowly peel the chastity belt off of Rogers. As he opened the front, he found Rogers' cock was tucked into a metal cock cage. "Fuck, Bruce, find me some lube."
"He didn't want to wake you." Sam poured two mugs of coffee, passing one to Bucky.
"How about you start at the beginning," Howard suggested.
"Serves him right, the bastard."
Hours later, as Steve snuggled into him, deeply asleep, Bucky vowed he would never let anything like this happen to his best friend again.
"Why were they even looking for us?"
Steve slowly crawled to the chair where his uniform sat waiting for him. On trembling legs, he stood and dressed. He slipped his feet into his boots, not bothering to tie them as he only had to make it to his bunk. Without a backward glance, he opened the door and stumbled into the early morning.
"Weren't subs from his time severely abused?"
"Dead. He and his wife died in a car crash when Tony was eleven. He was driving drunk."
Steve chuckled. "See you in a few hours. Love you."
Startling, Steve's eyes scanned the room noting only a small light by the door was on and Bucky lay sound asleep in the bed next to him. They were the only two people in the room. He started to ask who was speaking when he remembered Bucky and Dr. Banner introducing him to the tower's AI.
"That's the plan." Tony piped up.
Tony laughed as Steve's stomach grumbled again before reaching for the shampoo. "Alright, alright. We're coming."
"Is there anything we can do?" Tony hated not being able to solve this puzzle.
"Huh? Oh, well, you know me. I can't do anything halfway." Tony chuckled and moved to stand beside his dad. His hand ghosted over the metal arm. "Once I got started, I wanted to get as many details in there as I could. Besides, how do we know if it'll work the way we want if I only do the minimal work?"
Steve met Bucky's gaze, recognizing his best friend despite the haze he found himself in. He trembled as Henderson's words echoed through his mind. "M bad." He whispered in response to Bucky's question.
Steve loved the expression on Tony's face when he entered him. The trust placed in him was not lost on Steve. Only he could see Tony this relaxed, this trusting, this open and blissed out. Something he treasured. "I'm gonna fuck you now."
"Oh yes! Gimme." Tony lifted his hips and bit his lip in anticipation.
Without a word the elevator moved, only stopping once it reached the previously empty floor between Tony's penthouse and the communal floor where he would often gather with Bruce, Natasha, and Clint. Striding through the foyer, Tony pressed his hand to the security pad on the wall beside the door, and they silently opened.
"Yeah. Just needed to tell you. I know you noticed I've been off since all this started and I don't want to keep anything from you."
Not caring where they stayed, as long as they had privacy and safety, Bucky shifted the conversation. "You said Steve was in here?"
"Come on, let's head back to the kitchen. I'm starting to get hungry." Bucky led the way back down the hall. "I want you to look through the cabinets and find something to make for dinner. Something simple. We'll eat in the living room."
Tony spun in his lover's arms. Steve simple pressed in closer, rubbing himself against Tony's growing arousal. "But I'm already dressed."
"You love him?"
"They've only been found an hour and you're already turning Barnes into an experiment?" Natasha rolled her eyes at him.
Howard slipped in beside Tony as the doors closed and the elevator rose to the penthouse. "How are you doing, Son? I haven't seen much of you the last few days."
"She was mentioning just this morning how much she misses making homemade pizza with you." Howard offered his son a slight smile, expertly wielding his secret weapon. "I bet you would make her day if you came over and cooked with her."
Locating the lock in the front, Tony got to work releasing the locking mechanism.
"Oh, that." Steve beamed as he met Tony's gaze.
"Hey, I'm gonna be right here. You've already met Doc Banner. He's a great guy. He won't do anything without your permission." Bucky squeezed Steve's bicep. "Come on. He's been taking care of us both since we were found. And honestly, do you
"I look forward to it. What time should I expect him?"
"Can't a guy just want to spend time with his science bro?"
Around Rogers' waist was a leather and metal belt. From that, another metal band crossed from front to back through his crotch. Tony hoped he was wrong in what he suspected he would find when he removed it.
He smiles at Natasha. “I know.”
“You got a big ass number of issues to deal with. I need you to focus on the big three players, not all these little ones.” Fury steps up to the display. He still hasn’t replaced his computerized eye, it had once been enhanced, a vulnerability that the artificial intelligence of Ultron tried to hijack. He wears a black eye patch that matches his long leather coat.
“Read it.”
Tony clears his throat as he leads the way into the kitchen. Steve follows like a puppy. “A date?”
His mind was all over the place – his soul a juddering mess. Steve couldn’t hold onto it. Clasping Tony’s soul felt like trying to tame a hurricane. “Bucky and the twins aren’t here. Hawkeye and Natasha took them to a safe house.” He didn’t say that sooner or later, Steve would have to follow. He needed to. Not only was he their pack leader, but he was also Bucky’s friend.
Ross appears and orders the guards to take Steve into custody. The leg braces are unlocked and the guards haul Steve out of the SUV.
Steven glowers at him. “I don’t lie, my lord. All I can say about the Purge and the omegas there is that they are not saddled with the current political philosophy of the Council of Worlds.”
Tony sighs and drops his hands. He white knuckles his console. “Not we, you. I don’t like you going alone.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “You’re a scientist, of course, you can boil water.”
Stumbling to his knees next to Tony, he shoves the shirt away to look at the mess on Tony’s chest. It’s ugly and smells worse. He gags a little and then gets up to find some water. Luckily there’s a bucket near the work bench. It looks clean enough and he tastes a spoonful. There’s a distinct metallic taste to it, but otherwise he cannot detect anything overtly wrong with it.
“It’s not teasing. It’s more like taunting. But I get your point. I understand. I’ll try. I’m not saying it will be easy or anything. Sometimes I just run off at the mouth,” Tony said. “A lot like now, I can’t figure out when to stop. Do they have any coffee around here?”
Was it like a mind link? Could he call out to Bruce? He knew the bond transferred information subconsciously and that might not always be for the best. He needed to learn how to control that so he concentrated on the stash of papers that referenced transference of mind images and communication. From what he could gather, Bruce’s announcement of using
“I bonded with Bruce two days after I met him,” Steve said. “At least I’ve hung out with Sam once.”
His descent into hell – not in Afghanistan, but the minutes when Bucky tried to kill him and it all fell apart.
“I was going to say the equations don’t make much sense, like parts are missing,” Tony replied. He shrugged and had to smile because the admiration in Steve’s expression, the wonder in his eyes made Tony feel whole. It surprised him the difference between before and after – the vibrations, the very look of the world around him shifted, changed, and transformed. He couldn’t fathom a moment without Steve, now. Underneath it all – that scared the shit out of him. Even if he had to settle for Captain America and not just Steve Rogers sometimes.
THE END
“What is it?” Steve pins his hands over his ears. The din of sound blasts at him and he bends over about to vomit again.
“Okay. Thanks.” Sam walked into the Tower and disappeared in the elevator. Steve didn’t even know where he was going. Did Sam have an apartment in the Tower? Or was he staying elsewhere? Steve couldn’t remember one way or the other – his brain felt heavy in his skull. Then his arms tensed as he held Tony against his chest. Without a word, he headed toward the penthouse bedroom.
Two and a half hours later, Tony sat in a truck with Coulson, Romanov, Barton, and Dr. Banner.
"It's alright, Tony." Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist. "Whatever tech they have on-site I'm sure Natasha and Jarvis can handle, and Bruce will be on call."
At that moment an alarm sounded and red lights flashed. Steve stilled, panting for breath.
"Steve, hey, can you look at me?" Bucky gently lay a hand on Steve's shoulder, still amazed at how the serum changed Steve.
"I've got drag marks." Clint pointed to the ground, then down the tunnel. "They must've taken him this way."
... ... ... ...
Smirking, Bucky nodded. "You've got that right."
"Captin Rogers. You are in New York. The date is April third, two-thousand and two, and four twenty in the morning. The sky is slightly overcast and sixty-two degrees."
Steve grasped Tony's hips and thrust his tongue into him, ensuring he hit the bundle of nerves that would soon have Tony coming undone.
Steve swallowed down a whimper. Henderson loved to inflict as much pain as possible, not caring how it affected Steve or if the sub drifted into subspace. If Steve did reach subspace, Henderson sent him away without bringing him back up which would spiral him into a drop. Only the caring Commandos kept his hormone levels within optimal range. Without them, well, Steve was sure he wouldn't have made it through the first week.
"You said we were gifted an apartment in the building."
"Rogers. You're late." Henderson slammed the door closed behind him.
"Sir, I believe I have a location." Jarvis' voice interrupted them.
"You know I do," Steve responded immediately, meeting Bucky's gaze again.
Bucky sighed before smiling softly at his best friend. "I don't know. But what I am certain about is they will treat you the way you've always wanted. They'll want what's best for you, cherish you, do everything they can to show you each and every day how much you mean to them. They will be the best soulmate a person could ask for because that, my friend, is what you deserve."
"Jarvis." Bruce moved quickly to the side of the bed. He didn't wait for the AI to respond, instead keeping his entire focus on his patient.
of people with the new technology."
"Wow, that's pretty extensive."
"Of course."
"Tony asked me to marry him last night. I said yes."
Tony smiled before kissing Steve. "Love you too. Now, shower."
"Tony! There you are. You're late." Pepper sighed when she spotted him at the edge of the landing pad. She sighed when she noted the jet's absence and Tony's pout. "Steve get called out?"
"Come on, up you go."
"Where?"
Slowly the terror receded, leaving him drained. "Bucky."
"Well, Son. What else do you need?" Howard joined his son, refreshing his own drink.
Spotting a man with a red light on a pole ahead, Tony felt anxious. "Only one way to find out."
Steve nodded, smiled softly at Tony, and stood. "Jarvis, assemble the team. We have intel."
"No, I'm fine. Just still wrapping my mind around having a soulmate." Steve lay back on his pillows, positioning his arm so he could stare at the grey space on the inside of his left forearm. Upon spotting the mark the previous night, Steve had burst into tears, only stopping when he cried himself to sleep in Bucky's arms. Thankfully the doctor was finishing up his work when Steve spotted it.
“Don’t ask me,” Steve says but doesn’t bother signing. Instead he just shrugs his shoulders and throws up his hands in surrender.
Warmth flooded through him when Rogers gazed at his soulmark.
Bucky's expression softened as his gaze shifted to the front of the jet where Natasha sat in the co-pilot seat. "We've both got a past Steve. We want this to work, but we've both been through so much we've decided to take it slow. I'm still working through what I did as the Soldier. She deserves someone who's not such a fuckup."
"You think there is more going on than just human trafficking," Tony observed.
"Rogers. My office. Now!" Phillips ordered as the men of the 107th made their way towards the medical area. They would be thoroughly occupied for a while as they looked over all the men Rogers brought back from Azzano.
“In some ways, but in other ways I think we’re different.”
Steve nuzzles against Tony’s neck, enough that he hitches his breath and arches into Steve.  “No, but there are consequences.” Steve kisses lightly and then tugs at Tony’s shirt, wanting to feel flesh against flesh.
The prince studies him and then says, “Really? You’re an artist?”
“I was in my rebellious phase.” There’s no wind to speak of and the snow is perfectly white, silent, and overwhelmingly bright.
“Most people don’t talk about omegas like that – like they’re people,” Tony said. Hell, even Pep once in a while fell back on the idea that omegas, due to their different biology, couldn’t truly be considered human.
With little oxygen and almost no time to stop him, Steve lifted up his wrist and touched his healer brand to the Hulk’s tattoo. Why he did it, he had no idea – it felt more like instinct. He couldn’t speak, because the hand around his throat squeezed out all of his air, but this little motion, this action meant more. Somehow Steve knew it would. When the brands touched, the Hulk stopped mid-scream. The team members around them, Tony armored up, Hawkeye with bow and arrow drawn, Natasha with electrical rods at the ready, and Fury pointing a Glock at the Hulk, all paused as well. The shock wave hit them as the brands merged and a primal message, wordless but more profound, anchored Steve and the Hulk. The monster eased Steve to the floor, opened up his hand, and then simply lost hold of his form and shifted back to being Bruce just as quickly as it happened.
Tony brushes a rough hand against Steve’s nipples and he shivers as his erection jolts against their bellies. Tony leans forward and tongues Steve’s nipple, then catches it with his teeth. Spears of pleasure race through Steve and he cries out. He’s always been extra sensitive. His response elicits excitement from Tony as he plays with one and pinches the other nipple between two fingers.
“Are we talking Pretty Woman or Diehard?” Tony asks as Steve slips off his socks as well.
Steve flinched at her sharp edged words. He had no excuse. “It’s not like I can hide it.”
“I know,” Tony said. “You’re probably going into shock. You need more blood. I drank too much.”
“And?”
She pats his shoulder. “Don’t go messing with him, Sheriff. He’s trouble.”
“Later when I get a sense of where-.” He stopped. He already knew where. The scratching ache in his chest wasn’t going to disappear unless he did something about it.
“I’m not even sure where they came from,” Steve says as he throws his toothbrush back in the bathroom and then joins Thor in the kitchen.
“That’s concerning, Mer Rogers. Thank you for informing me. I will report their defiance of orders and also run a self-diagnostic.”
“Hardly.” Tony shakes his head and meets Steve’s eyes. “I’m going to miss your blue eyes.”
“What?” The switch throws Tony and he’s confused, muddled.
“Even out here.” The Hunter waves to the hills beyond which poppy fields grow. “In the middle of nowhere, you are well known for your actions in – what do you call it – California?”
“Thank you.”
“What’s that?” Not-Tony says.
She doesn’t raise her head when she speaks again, but stares blankly at her folded hands. “Capta-Commander, this is complicated.”
He slid his other thumbnail into the bloody one, carving out more skin. “I wanted to kill them.” Did she know everything? Had anyone told her what they’d done to him? “I wanted to kill them, the vampires that fed off me, when I was – when I was capture. I knew they were being forced to-forced to do those things to me.”
“Anything at all. Take me for a ride, Steve. Get me out of here before they find me and the hell that’s breaking loose up there becomes my life. Show me that this was the right thing to do today,” Tony says, and his words are said with heated despair. “Give me a brief moment.” He doesn’t have to voice the rest of his thoughts, Steve already knows – a brief moment of happiness.
“You should watch this too, Captain Rogers.”  Jarvis prods him and Steve acquiesces. What more can he lose?
“Get the packing going. We should leave.” He knew he sounded like an ass ordering her around, but he’d back it up to her later. Buy her something, or get some art. Or something. He didn’t wait to hear her plans or to answer where he’d gone. Instead he rode the elevator down to Bruce’s research floor and ended up not finding anyone at all. He did find a lot of broken glassware and a centrifuge that had a huge fist print in the side wall of it. Maybe having a guy that could turn into the Hulk at any given moment 32 floors up wasn’t the grandest idea he’d ever had in his life.
“Can I ask what brought this on?” Steven asks. “Because I’d like to be able to figure out the motives behind some of your reasoning. It might better prepare me for when I’ve crossed the line and you might lash out.”
“A tour of this fair country of yours. I would love to ride out and see the surrounding area.”
“Tony, we’ve been through a dozen candidates except for the missing requirement of knowledge of biomedical sciences and stats he’s the best one we’ve seen or interviewed. You know that the bio requirement is just an ancillary concern. Strange is always willing to step into that role for you,” Pepper says, and she places her hand on his. It is a gentle touch. “The headache’s back, isn’t it?”
“That’s not very nice to say about the man you love,” Steve says and ushers her through the bay to the main docking lounge.
Tony presses a hand to his upper arm. “I think I understand. Now, you were part of a tour, Captain America tour, right?”
Steve keeps his hands in fists by his side. “I wouldn’t think that’s a proper way to talk about one of the most influential, powerful men in Human Space.”
“Really this time. It’s just being drunk and inappropriate. Maybe a little lonely. That’s all.” He hits on an idea to get them to stop badgering him about the recording. “I probably need some friends time. How about after Labor Day we get together? That weekend after? Maybe I can get two days off in a row.”
Thor remained calm, almost passive, as he listened to Tony. “Perhaps there is somewhere we could talk? Your mate needs his rest.”
Smiling, Steve blows at the bubbles. “I think you forget who was on the end of the violence.”
“May I come in?”
Steven had shrugged. “It wouldn’t be the first time that society made decisions based on biology. Women have been subjugated for centuries because they are the ones to have children. I never liked it. I never will. I don’t like being bullied. I don’t like bullies.”
As Sam took off to the north, Steve felt the stretch of their bond and the pain it took for Sam to leave Steve alone. “Stay steady, Falcon.”
“Can he dig into our memories, or is it just active thought?” Steve says and tries to sit up further. He’s thwarted for his efforts by a shock of pain through him.  Lost in thought, Tony only shakes his head at Steve’s query. “We have to plan, Tony. We can’t-.”
“Well, then, Sheriff, you are none too happy this beautiful morning.”
“But perhaps you may tell us something? You said you have no family?”
Without looking back at him, Steve said, “Don’t touch it, Tony. You’ll get it infected.”
“She’s gone,” Steve managed to say again. He spoke in quiet words with a wrecked voice.
“I went ahead and added a plate of your favorite pasta, boss,” Vision says. “Well, Wanda did. She didn’t think a bowl of soup would be enough for Captain Rogers.”
“Mind your own business, Brock,” Steve spat out. Six more agents approached, all with their weapons still raised. Steve turned around to face the car and so he could watch as they got Tony out of the vehicle.
"If you give me his mouth."
"I told him you wanted to make pizza with him," Howard admitted, knowing full well he was tricking his son.
"Cap, upper floors are empty," Natasha reported over the comms.
Steve sucks in a deep breath before releasing it slowly. "A couple of years before I joined the Army, I was walking home from the grocery store. It was early evening, but cloudy so darker than usual."
Bucky peered down at Steve, his heart breaking for what the other man had to endure. In the time they wanted, Steve had fallen into a light sleep, but now Bucky needed to get him cleaned up, fed, and water into him. Only then would Steve truly be able to rest.
Thanks to everyone who has left Kudos, comments, or subscribed. I am thrilled you are enjoying this fic!
"Plenty of those to choose from."
"Tony!" Steve gasped.
"Oh yeah! More!" Tony closed his eyes and his head pressed back into the pillows as Steve entered him. He worked one finger in but quickly followed with two, then three.
"Fine, they can go with you, Tony. But, you
"What? Are you alright?"
Tony strode across the lab to the coffee pot and frowned when only a few drops were left. "I still need a cast of Barnes' shoulder so I can get the new arm right. Is he available?"
As I add chapters, I am updating the tags.
"Not only will he see to your punishment, but he will ensure your hormone levels are evened out by dropping you."
Raise your hand if you want to give Steve a hug!
Tony couldn't help the grin as the lights began to come on from the bottom up. Ending with his name on the side. "Like Christmas, but with more me."
Setting the device down, Howard turned to his son. "Not all Doms know how to properly care for a sub. Could be he allowed the fact he was Captain America's Dom go to his head and chose to exert that dominance in every way he could."
"How did I not know?" Natasha slid her arm around Bucky and hugged him back.
"Sure. Do we know what it's made of?"
"What?" Tony tilted his head to the side as he met Steve's gaze.
"All I wanted to do was come back here, pull this out, and slide right in." Steve whispered in Tony's ear as he played with the toy, relishing Tony's sounds of pleasure.
"I'm not the only one who can find happiness." Steve gripped Bucky's shoulder and smirked, choosing to change the subject. "I've seen the way you and Natasha gaze at each other. When are you going to get your head out of your ass?"
Tony's eyes rounded and he would have dropped his glass had Pepper not reacted swiftly and snagged it from his hand.
Tony moaned and pressed the heel of his hand to his growing erection. The thought of having Steve Rogers at his feet, willingly submitting to him, had him aching to make it so.
"Yeah. Mission was a bust. Everyone was gone when we got here. Only thing left was a single computer, medical equipment, and empty cells. They bugged out through a tunnel. Jarvis and Bruce tracked them to a plane they're trying to locate."
"I look forward to working with you soon." With that, Strange left.
"Thirty-six hours, Sir."
Laughing, Pepper turned from the screen to pour the champagne she put on ice earlier. Passing a glass to Tony, she sat on the couch facing Tony. "So, any plans for tonight?"
"Around seven. Jarvis will let us know when he's on his way."
"Everyone is different, Son. It may be five days, or five years. You just have to have patience." Howard squeezed his son's shoulder.
"Night, Dad." Tony headed for the elevator, carefully not peeking into Barnes' and Rogers' room. Although it was still a bit early, he instructed Jarvis to let Pepper know he was unavailable for the rest of the evening and she could go home. Once in his private space, he turned up the music, had Jarvis pull up the necessary information, and got to work on Bucky's arm.
"Hello, my dear."
Pepper noted Tony rubbing at the pulse point on his left wrist, where the grey circle which made up the beginnings of his soulmark rested. He'd been rubbing at it lately. The small shape had been there as long as Pepper had known Tony, but neither spoke of it. Her employer, and friend, had spent years hoping it would develop into the bright colors and crisp shape which usually made up a soulmark, but it had yet to change. He was losing hope at ever finding his soulmate which was the reason he always wore long sleeves or a wide watch when in public. He didn't want the world to know he was a man with a soulmark and no soulmate.
"So ready for me. Bend over, Love." Steve turned Tony around to face the stone bench and pressed between Tony's shoulders to guide him into place. "So perfect. All mine." Steve kissed down Tony's back before lowering to his knees and nudging his feet further apart.
"Yeah, get some of this ice melting anyway." Bruce agreed.
"Since this morning. A Russian oil team called it in about eighteen hours ago."
"Captain, if it's the serum you're worried about, I assure you. It's safe with me." Bruce pushed his glasses back up his nose. "It's imperative we ensure your levels are all where they should be."
Steve rolled to his side and hugged one of his pillows as he watched Bucky sleep.
"Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works."
A jet settled on the landing pad outside and Coulson led the way through the penthouse with Tony on his heels.
"I'll find out about the others, but Howard Stark is dead." Bucky knew with certainty that knowing his tormentors were long dead would put Steve's mind at ease. He only hoped all three were no longer among the living.
Bucky noted the direction of Steve's gaze and released a slow breath. "Before I tell you, I want to you remember that you did everything you could. You saved my life, Steve."
“Pay and fuck, that’s how this goes,” Steve says and his voice is gray like icy steel.
“Tony,” Pepper said as she faced him. The eerie green light from the computer screen threw odd tones across her face. But he still glimpsed the tears in her eyes, on her cheeks. “I think I found out who he is.”
“Oh yeah, right.” Tony focuses on the task at handle, a little amazed that they’ve each compartmentalized so well what happened out on a snowy slope.
Steve stays next to the buffet table but then a clutch of busy bodies arrive and swarm around him, asking probing questions until one finally asks, “Are you the newest flavor of the month?” He barely shakes his head when another one chimes in to comment, “Prince Anthony is the most eligible bachelor, everyone is trying to land him.”
“I made you three sandwiches. I didn’t know if that was enough,” Tony says.
“Now, that’s impressive,” Sam said and knocked Steve in the arm with an elbow. Tony noticed the slight blush of pink to Steve’s cheeks.
“Stop, doc, you’re making me blush,” Tony says. He turns serious. “But really, after the implant goes, what choices do I have?”
“Yes.”
“Always the optimist,” Tony comments.
“Copy that,” Sam says. “I hope you got my bird.”
Without another word they left him, crucified in the middle of a hot roof. Alone.
Steve shivers and pulls Tony to him, kissing his crown. “I’m so- I’m so sorry. I wanted it to be special. I didn’t want for it to be.” He stops and when Tony looks up, he sees the tears staining his cheeks.
“The other vampires were not routinely fed serum laced blood for years. We expect that this is the difference,” the quiet second scientist said.
“How are you feeling?” Tony asks and it’s all Steve can do to put two words together.
“And this is the last omega,” Tony surmises as he studies the curved back. He should be dead by now, considering the passage of time. But then again, he was in stasis for a while. He presses the interface communicator to alert the omega that he wants to speak to him. The man doesn’t move. For a second, Tony thinks he might be dead, but then when Tony hits the comm-link again, the omega turns over.
“Fuck. Fuck a fucking duck,” Tony says and tears the device from the panel. “Pack up. Now that we know, he’s going to come at us – any minute.”
“Divorced," Tony says quickly and then adds to his daughter, "You’re too old for your age, you know that don’t you?” She only nods and smiles, not sparing a glance at her father.
Through tears caught in his throat, he whispers, "I'm here, Stevie."
None of it was.
“What?” Steve crunched up his face like he smelled something bad.
“He was delirious with fever and we all love it when he gets like that,” Bucky says and glowers at Steve. “So not only did I get you a blacksmith, but I also got you a doctor in the deal.”
“He might, but we know Clint and we know Ultron. I think that gives us the upper hand.”
Steve pats his lap. “Sit down.”
The church emptied out but they all stayed silent and waiting. When Steve finally spoke, he said, “Thank you. I didn’t know that was possible.” All the other mourners had left the church, going to the burial.
He’d been there. Steps away from the building where a man had been tortured and he never knew. He could have known, he should have asked. He was twelve – what responsibility did he own? He’d spent the next four summers on the campus. He never walked into the bio-division laboratory. Not even once.
What does that mean, exactly? He slumps down to the floor, the tangle of images like gnarled branches of a tree all about him. He feels absent, lost. He scratches at the place the arc reactor resided, but is now gone with the rest of him. Wincing, Tony closes his eyes and cups his face in his hands. What is there left of him. He can do this on his own. He doesn’t need anyone. He’s proven that time and again. He’s too old to ignore the fact he needs more than what’s on the surface. He needs the people that surrounded him.
At that point the knock came for the delivery and they chowed down on it. Steve told stories of his younger days and Tony relished it. It helped in some ways to hear Bucky humanized and not just some instrument of Hydra. The conflict that they were one and the same person plagued Tony, but when he heard of both the bravery and the smart-ass interactions that Steve had with Bucky, Tony’s hatred started to dissolve. He didn’t know if it was a good thing or a bad thing.
Steve set a fast pace, aware it wouldn't be long before Tony would need to leave and wanting to bring him as much pleasure as possible in the short amount of time they had.
Bucky squeezed once more before releasing Steve and heading for the door. As they entered the hallway, Bucky was thankful it was deserted, not a person was in sight.
Steve, to his credit, didn't flinch. He was used to Henderson's theatrics, meant to throw him off balance but which rarely worked. "I'm sorry, Sir. Debrief ran longer than expected."
"Thank you." Bucky stood and shook Bruce's hand.
"You'll learn soon enough. If your mark is taking shape then you're getting closer to meeting them. It shouldn't be long before your names mark each other's skin as well."
"I'll brief you on the way."
"Sir, an assemble order had been given by Miss Romanov."
Shaking his head with a laugh, Steve pulled open the drawer and retrieved the butt plug Tony enjoyed so much. It was wide enough to keep Steve's cum inside Tony, but not too large as to become uncomfortable if worn for several hours. "Is this what you want?"
Tony cried out in pleasure as Steve entered him in one long thrust. Steve didn't waste any time. Wrapping one hand around to grasp Tony's cock, the other wrapping around his waist to hold him steady, Steve began moving his hips in quick, sharp thrusts.
"Phil! Come in." Pepper greeted him with a smile and stood.
"Of course, Sergeant."
Henderson agreed with a wide smirk. "That he does. Of course, all your wonderful toys help."
Steve leaned against the back of the elevator and his eyes drifted closed for the few moments it took to get to their floor.
"All we can do is our best. We'll find them, and we'll get them home." Tony pressed a kiss to Steve's forehead. "You okay?"
Tony glanced up from his work wearing a wide smile. "Perfect, J. Thanks."
"Of course, Agent," Tony smirked. He had no such plans, but again, wouldn't tell Coulson.
"Buck!" Steve wrapped both arms around Bucky and held on tightly. His heart was still racing from the events from the Valkarie. He thought Bucky had died in his arms.
Two hours later, Bucky began the process of bringing Steve out of subspace. "Look at me, Stevie."
"Doing well. I'm actually just about to leave the tower."
"At your service, Captain. Do you require assistance?"
Bucky's gaze followed Steve as his best friend paced the back of the quinjet. Noting Tony was deep in discussion with Jarvis, he walked silently to the back. "Hey, you okay?"
"Morning, Son." Howard entered the exam room with a broad smile. Dinner the night before had gone well and when Tony left he seemed more relaxed than he'd seen him in weeks.
"Very well, I have work to do, so get out." Phillips waved towards the door, already shifting focus to his mountain of paperwork now that the 107th is back. However, he couldn't help the grin when he thought about hearing Henderson's report upon finishing with Rogers.
"We received a distress call from Brazil. The local authorities have reason to suspect there is human experimentation or trafficking going on at this compound." Natasha brought up a map using the holo table.
Pepper couldn't hold in her laugh at Tony's antics.
"Want me to come along?" Bucky offered.
"What ... " Steve cleared his throat. "What kind of security measures are in place?"
Steve sucked in air, but his breath was soon punched out of him again when Stark pushed his thumb into Steve's ass. The burn of the stretch bringing more tears to his eyes. With the sound locked into his cock, Stark's fist in his ass, Henderson shoving his thick cock down his throat, and Phillips playing with then putting the clamps on his nipples, Steve was overwhelmed with the stimulation. If done right, any of those would have easily allowed him to slip into subspace. However, with them all at once and without any care, the calm headspace was nowhere in sight. He wouldn't be drifting tonight. But that wouldn't keep him from experiencing subdrop when he returned to his quarters. Such were the facts when a Dom only used a sub for their own pleasure and paid no mind to the subs needs.
After considering his response for several moments, Tony closed his eyes. "I'm not really sure. Something other than Rogers' designation has me out of sorts, but I can't figure out what it is."
Steve's stomach chose that moment to growl loudly.
He was right. The Dom pressed the tip to his hole, and shoved the entire thing into Steve in one hard thrust. His throat raw and aching, he wasn't even able to cry out in pain. He was sure he was bleeding from his ass by now and this didn't help the situation. Tears streamed down his face as Henderson insert his cock into a chastity belt. He locked the device around Steve's waist, then locked the anal beads to the device.
"I'm right here. Won't leave you. Promise."
"Hey, Punk. You're never going to guess what happened to us." Bucky took Steve's hand but froze when a patch of grey caught his eye. "What's this?"
One wall held every possible color of oil paint, canvas in varying sizes and shapes, and an easy was set up by the large window which allowed in plenty of light. Along the opposite wall, he found colored pencils, charcoal, pastels, and sketchbooks of various sizes and types. Finally, in the corner was a sink where one could clean supplies, as well as a mini-fridge, a small armchair, and a side table.
"So, maybe he never had a mark before because his soulmate is from this time instead."
The elevator door opened, and Steve moved swiftly through their private rooms to their large bed. Tony released his legs from Steve's waist, grasped his face, and kissed him soundly.
Noting the pain lines, Bruce administered a dose of pain meds while he answered. "Yes. Captain Rogers is in the bed on the other side of the curtain. We found no injures, although we suspect any were healed by the serum years ago."
"There. Right there!" Tony used his legs to pull Steve in deeper. "Almost there."
Although expecting the intrusion, Steve couldn't hold back the whimper of pain as Stark shoved into him.
Steve kept his eyes closed as Bucky gave him a bite of grilled cheese. He chewed slowly, relishing the calm that settled over him over the last hour. He continued to float as Bucky fed him, letting him know when he switched from one item to the next, offering small sips of the flavored water in between. His focus remained on Bucky, the soft words spoken, the care with which Bucky fed him. Nothing else in the world mattered, only this small space in which Bucky knew what he needed and gave it to him in heaps.
"Barnes asked us not to enter the room until Rogers is awake and they have a chance to talk. But, I'm sure he doesn't want to leave his side either. How do you propose we go about the scans and measurements for his arm?" Howard was ready to start on the next step of his and Tony's project, but they couldn't do that without speaking with Barnes and assessing his arm.
Gabe returned twenty minutes later with Morita in tow. They brought a bucket of warm water, a large clean bowl, several clean rags and towels, a large tray of food, several canteens of water, and more warm blankets.
"You weren't even gone a whole day." Tony laughed.
Howard burst out laughing. "Well, what can I say. You learned your patience from me."
Bruce had left the room the moment Steve woke to allow him a few private moments with Steve, but now entered the room at Bucky's wave and offered them both a smile. "It's good to see you awake, Captain Rogers. If it's alright with you, I'd like to check you over for injuries, or side effects from your time in the ice."
"Hey, you're alright. I'm right here, not going anywhere." Tony squeezed Steve's hands, hoping to ground him in the present.
"Hey, if I can find your sorry ass in the basement of a Hydra base in the middle of a war, I think I can find you on the other side of the floor in a stupidly huge tower in the middle of New York."
"What about the ..." Bucky caught himself, unsure of how Steve's designation would be viewed in the new time they suddenly found themselves in.
"I spoke with him briefly about it. He assured me that he could handle it. Apparently, he and the Howling Commandos would give Rogers a chance to hit subspace during downtime on missions. They'd work in an extra day whenever possible, with Carter's help, so they could take care of Rogers. He had a Dom on base, but he wasn't taking care of Rogers the way he should have."
"Hey yourself. How do you feel?"
Bucky sucked in a breath. Steve's eyes were dilated to the point they were black, he was covered in sweat, trembling, but most of all, Steve was crying. "What the hell did they do to you?"
"Don't worry, Tony. I'll take good care of you." Steve would never admit how much of a turn on it was to know Tony spent the day with his cum up his ass. He never imagined he'd be so possessive of his partner. But, he loved Tony with all his heart. Why would he want to share the man who meant the world to him?
Understanding his patient's dislike for the medical bay, Bruce shook his head. "I can bring what I need to you."
He and Bruce had already had the conversation, after all.
Sighing, watching his quiet evening go out the window, he picked up his phone, "You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark."
Time seemed to drag on as the three men continued to take their pleasure. He wished for nothing more than for the abuse to be over but knew that the men spilling their load into him wouldn't mark the end. When Stark's thrusts became more frantic, Steve prepared himself to swallow as much as he could. He wanted to avoid the punishment he would receive if any cum spilled to the floor.
"The last truck arrived six days ago. If we're going to do anything about this, now is our chance." Natasha eyed the gathered team.
Coulson's voice came over the phone, "Mr. Stark, we need to talk."
"It appears as if the metal is Adamantium," Jarvis answered without prompting.
"Yes, Sir."
"Oh, Stevie. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you from this." Bucky whispered, trying to keep his tears at bay when Steve moaned in pain at every touch to his sensitive skin.
"What? Can't I want to help a veteran?"
"No, Stark. I wouldn't call an assemble if it were only a suspicion." Natasha knew better than to interrupt Steve and Tony unless it was a necessity. "When the call came in, I asked Jarvis to do some digging. He managed to pull up satellite images from the last two months. There is a steady stream of trucks going into the compound."
"Grandpop made the chastity belt which Steve Rogers wore," Tony muttered before dropping to a stool. "If he made that, I can't help but wonder what else he did."
"I never tire of this view."
"Wanna tell me what's going on?" Tony asked as he led Steve through the penthouse to their room.
"If you're making me a new arm, might as well call me Bucky." Bucky shook the man's hand, astounded at how much this Howard resembled his father. He had to remind himself that they weren't the same man.
Steve pressed his head into Bucky's hand and his eyes closed at Bucky's soothing words.
"Alright, give me his ass. Once I'm done with it, you two can have your own fun." Henderson rounded the bench as Stark pulled his fist out, leaving Steve's hole gaping.
Howard smiled and dropped a hand to halt Tony's rubbing of his soulmark. "Thinking about them again?"
Tony opened his mouth to respond before sighing, "Fair point."
Steve followed, but when he realized what the room held he stopped in his tracks in sucked in a breath. The room was stocked with every imaginable art supply, and some Steve couldn't name. He slowly began to walk around to room, his fingers ghosting over some to the supplies.
"Let's find out." Stark withdrew his hand to the tip of his fingers before pushing his arm in up to his elbow in one brutal thrust.
"How'd he take it?"
"J, lock it down," Tony instructed as he filled his mug before facing his father.
"Well hidden. But also means we can sneak up without being spotted easier." Clint noted. "The tree canopy and cloaking on the jet will get us in close and we can melt into the trees once on the ground."
"Right, small sips. You don't want to start with too much." Bruce held a straw to Bucky's lips and allowed him to drink. "How do you feel?"
"Is he alright?"
"I am overseeing Captain Rogers' recovery. I personally handled admitting him to the medical ward, assessing his injuries, and ensuring he was comfortable. Certain ... items have been removed and destroyed with great prejudice."
They all fall in step with one another as they were led to where a team was finishing drilling a hole in the ice.
"It's not just a plug, it's beads. Large ones." Tony sighed as he repeated the process of pulling it out one bead at a time, adding lube to each beads, and pushing them back in a bit. He was trying to ease the way so they would come out with minimal internal damage.
"Sure, why not?"
"We've been watching them for hours. There is no indication of any vehicles left in the last few days. How did they slip past us?"
"Tony?"
"Really, Punk?" Bucky's eyes widened as he peered at Tony then Steve, noting the matching expressions of pure joy on each.
Henderson led the way, Steve remaining the required number of steps behind him. As they passed through the center of the base, Steve heard Peggy call out to him. Thankfully, though, they reached Henderson's quarters before she could make her way through the crowd to talk to him. He knew she would have questions later and wasn't looking forward to the discussion.
"Love you too, Babe."
"I'm still thrilled." Steve spun the ring on his left hand absently. "I never thought I'd have someone love me, much less someone as amazing as Tony."
"You go ahead and hop in. I'll join you after I order dinner."
“I’ve found a suitable island, sir. With a very beautiful view, should I purchase it?”
“I’m not sure,” Cho answers. She set up a series of monitors in the room. Wires crisscross between the beds and the occupants.
“Tomorrow maybe we should go boating or for a hike.”
“If you believe that, why did you invite him here?” Steve says and he’s slowly running out of steam. He presses the heel of his hands into his eyes.
“I think you’ve been studying humans way too much.” The first wad of burrs is free and Tony throws it into the fire, starting on the next. “So, you got these while catching the hares for dinner, didn’t you?”
Steve stared at the middle distance, not facing Tony or the truth. “It’s new. I hadn’t really considered it before, but I enjoy it. The dreams. I like it.” He wasn’t sure he could look at Tony as he confessed these truths.
Steve stands up and starts to clear the table. He tries to sound casual about his query but doesn’t think he pulls it off at all. “When it almost leaked what did you do?”
As Frigga stands in the middle of the tangled flowers and weeds she gestures for them to stand aside. Steve wonders if he should be armed, or at least ready to fight, but Tony only grabs his hand and stills him.
She rubs his bent back. “I’m sure the serum will do it’s magic, Tony.”
Clint strode right up to Tony, leaned down, and stuck his face right up to Tony’s face. “What the fuck do you even know? I have children. I have a wife. They depend on me. Do you think, for even a second, mating with Natasha stopped me from loving them?”
. He picked up his hand and rubbed his temples in feigned exhaustion. He wasn’t ready to share, not now, not with the pack and surely not with the world. Though he knew that Sam would never betray his confidence, Steve still needed to sort things out for himself. “Do you think I could sleep a little more?”
“I could lead the way a little?” Tony asked, and he had no problem doing that at all.
Leaning over, Tony closes the strap to the breastplate of the leathers and covers the gland. “I noticed that your gland does not scar. Are you modified? It didn’t say in your file.” Many omegas are modified with enhancers to be fit for battle. Healing enhancers is one of them.
“Perfectly good citizens being infected by the vamp bug and ending up undead like that?”
“If you can get in touch with them and not alert the authorities have at it. But otherwise, no. You’ll have to hunt.”  She smirked at Thor as Bruce wilted further into the corner. “It’ll be fun. Like old times.”
“I can’t tell you what’s going on. It’s not a secure line. Get safe. Get Pepper safe.”
“She said it would be like this,” Sam says quietly. “Just take your time, Steve.”
“Your funeral, right boss man?” Clint winks at Steve and then hands the bow and the quiver over to Tony. “Give it your best shot.”
“Just a little report for you, boss.” Happy shifts on his feet glancing at Steve and then back at the prince. “In private?”
“Schmidt runs everyone out of town, or scares everyone,” Steve says. “Besides we can do our own horses.”
“And you were a wily adversary,” Tony chimes in. “You were a bastard of a knight to hunt. Let me tell you that.”
It is a chance. A chance to at least say goodbye to Tony. Silently, Steve accepts the garment bag with the tuxedo and goes to the tiny bathroom in his garret apartment. The water is – as usual – frigid but it is an unusually hot and humid day. He quickly showers and then dries off which is a tight fit in the cramped room. He slips on the Tux pants and amazes that they fit well. He leaves the bathroom and finishes dressing in the main room. It’s too stuffy in the bathroom to continue, by the time he would finish he would need another shower.
“Well, many don’t survive it when they are so close these days,” Fury states. “Back in the day it wasn’t as bad, but now it’s worse. A lingering after effect of the genetic era.”
“Or when the train was attacked and you called out,” Tony said and nodded. He pointed to Steve. “I get it. But you instigated all of that. Does that mean only you can do it?”
“So you think Allah agrees with animal torture?” Tony spots the lion’s blue eyes. Somehow the Lion Hunter and his gang of goons had trapped the lion. How they managed the collar around its neck is a mystery. But it knows torture from its days in captivity.
Steve frowns at him and starts again. “Yeah surprise, okay. So there are Legions that protect worlds. We – the Shield Legion protect this world, humans. We look like humans because we protect humans.”
The gravity of Tony’s stare pulls Steve’s focus to him. He cannot deny the prince the words spilling out of his mouth. “For the right partner.”
“Yes, Mer Rogers.”
“I will try, and you can trust me.”
"When I was growing up there was a lady who lived in the tenement across the street. You know, she didn't have much and she had a baby to feed. She did it."  Steve doesn't elaborate on what
