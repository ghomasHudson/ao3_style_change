He found out who he was looking for in the corner of the room, trying to learn how to start a fire with sticks.
Steve shook his head. “He disabled it. He wouldn’t have gone into a fight with me knowing how to shut down his suit with a few words.”
Tony spoke up. “I ran into Raza. He was unconscious last time I saw him.”
In this chapter, they get an unexpected visitor, who challenges their relationship.
“Ok, yeah, I’ll shut up now.”
Steve saw red for a second and had to take several breaths to calm himself down. He unclenched his fists and flattened them on his legs. Bucky thought he was being nice, he thought he was being generous, he didn't see it as stealing away yet another one of Steve’s crushes. Except this wasn't a crush, this was Tony, his fiery, impossible, Tony. If he laid a finger near him Steve was going to turn into a wolf and bite it off. He kept his voice even, though his displeasure still bled through.
Sam bit his lip, caught, and decided to get straight to the point. “Maybe cool it a little with this new guy. Cap looks like he's about to strangle someone and I'm pretty sure he just broke a glass in there. He gets worked up when you guys fight.”
“Easy, big guy, what happened?”
“Are we having a moment?” Brian asked, half serious.
That was alarming. “Need them for what? Where is your recipe?”
“Wow Tony, that was beautiful, what training seminar did you steal that from?”
“It wasn’t his fault!”
Tony’s smile froze. “I was…out. With a ...friend.”
“You only do it when we’re pretending. I don’t want to pretend any more.” His grip on Tony’s shoulders tightened. “You told me the first kiss didn’t matter…that it didn’t count unless I wanted it to. I want it to count, and I want you to make this one count too.”
“You good in there?”
Tony looked up at him, his face impassive, before looking down to continue working on the wings. “He’s nice.”
The man controlling the birds was unremarkable, of average height and weight, identical to hundreds of people that walked the streets of New York everyday. In one hand he held a golden orb with a cross on top, in the other, a normal hand gun. The dichotomy made Tony want to laugh. Sure an army of magic birds was cool, but it was hard to top a good old fashioned gun.
“It doesn’t matter, because he’s staying. We worked it all out, and we’re good.”
“Yes, you shouldn’t have, so I want to know why you did.”
Tony spat mud and sand from his mouth. “Why do you care?”
Steev nodded. “You saved me when you should have left me out to die in the smoke. Then you helped me save Thor when you had no reason to care. When the peacekeepers came after us you tried to get me out first. You ended up being nothing like I expected.”
“We’ll stand together. All the way to the end.”
Steve was intimately familiar with how far Tony would go when pushed to the limit, and it had never involved causing him permanent harm. He wished he could say the same for himself in regards for Tony, a vision of Tony lying pale and bleeding on the ground flashing through his mind. He looked across the tables to where he was laughing with Rhodes. He looked ok. His cheeks weren’t hollowed out so clearly someone was making sure he got fed. He was breathing and walking easily and though his left arm seemed to have a tremble, he didn’t seem to be having any problems with its strength or dexterity. He looked....fine. He looked happy. Steve looked down at his own hands, curling them to hide where he had bitten his fingers bloody, remembering how his hands had shook as he had shaved off months of hair that morning. He was happy that Tony was fine without him. It was good. He wanted Tony to be happy. He pushed his chair back from the table.
While he was in here, there was nothing he could do to prove his innocence. He had to trust that Obie would look into things more and let him out when he saw the truth. He trusted Obie more than anyone. He would be ok, if he could wait it out. He could stay right here, and not even meet another contestant. He would be fine. Tony rubbed a hand through his hair. He was going to be fine. This was like a fun little camping trip, he tried to convince himself. Tony had always wanted to go camping, but you weren’t allowed to leave the Capital without special permission so he had been stuck inside like everyone else.
“Hmmmm. No.”
Steve hauled himself out of bed, and started pulling on his uniform. “Tell everyone to assemble in the hanger.”
“Ok? You’re not going to fight?” Tony asked incredulously.
Tony shook his head. “I should be fine. Last time I still had the suppressants in my system, and I had no idea what the hell I was doing. Now I know what it feels like at least, so it should go better.”
“You're up early.”
“Can you quit yelling? My head is killing me.”
Later that night Steve found himself back on the base. He still felt too guilty over the Commandos to celebrate the victory as raucously as the others. He walked to his quarters, where he found a tall man sitting against his door with his head in his hands.
“Natasha says you were really worried that I was missing.”
things were this way.
Seeing as last time his missiles had had little effect, he used his laser to cut a swatch through the birds, creating a brief empty space before they poured back in. Nothing was working, and now people were ragging on his cooking again.“Seriously guys? Twice in one day? We already had this conversation, let it go! It's not like I poisoned your grandmas or something!”
“I'm not a puppy!” She gasped, affronted.
Thor swung at the birds with his hammer, passing through them as they dissolved into smoke, this time reforming only moments later in their same size and form. “I have had one of your omelettes in the past, friend Stark, and I think I would prefer my eggs unbroken.” He raised his hammer and called down lighting,lighting up the street with a boom of sound and light. It did no more damage to the birds than Tony waving his hands through the air.
“We have a seating chart now? What are we, kindergarteners?” Huffed Clint, making a show of settling more firmly into the chair. Tony bumped the chair with his hip and took a swig of coffee.
Steve was unimpressed.
“I guess, but all I post is my art.”
“He's the real deal, the papers over there seem to like him, and he's done plenty of what I’d call superhero work. I don't know why he's decided to trot over to this side of the pond, though. I should have asked.”
“Hmmmmmm. I'd love to help, but really, I'm not sure I can offer what you need. I'm not even sure if you know what you need.”
“Hurts.” Tony mumbled. His head was pounding so hard he could barely think and his back was a mass of pain.
Clint slumped down in his chair dejectedly, muttering about chair guns. Tony continued, ignoring him. “So I needed somewhere to put the party. I technically own this whole building, but the floor below us has offices for Stark Industries, so I gave everyone the rest of the week off, and moved all the furniture up here so there would be space.” There was an outraged beep and DUM-E nudged his arm. Tony gave him a pat. “Sorry, we moved the furniture.”
“Great work, everyone move in. I want this guy surrounded, but we don't want to scare him into harming the hostage. I'm going in alone to try to talk to him.”
“I need to get to my dragon. Please, help me get out of here.”
As he talked he destroyed another bird, and watched it blow away into the wind. Maybe he could get them all before the team got here, and convince them there had never been any birds in the first place. In distance a street sign fell over with a clang. Maybe not.
The crowd let out a collective gasp, and Tony whipped his head up. On the screen there was the chariot for District 12. A curly brown haired girl stood beside a short blond boy. The camera jerked away to focus on the precious set of contestants, but not before everyone got a good shot of the blond kid giving them all the middle finger. The crowd on the bleachers was booing and hissing, and from the corner of the shot Tony could see things being thrown down onto the path.
Tony was unaware that he had done a guide for Brooklyn. The situation around his travel books was...complicated.
He looked up at Steve who nodded. Tony didn’t look happy about it but he stood up and brushed off his pants. In the past, Tony would have fought him on it. Would have said to keep them in, then Steve would have taken them out himself and done a bad job of it, then Tony would have gotten mad. Now, he stood up. “I’ll go get the scissors.”
“You make much of little.”
“There’s no way it says that.”
He was sleeping, he knew he was sleeping, as his feet carried him down the hall, every step carrying the weight on inevitability. Steve met Tony in the conference room. They were the only ones there, and Tony looked up when Steve entered.
Loud music was playing when Tony startled awake with a gasp. His throat filled with ash and he coughed roughly, struggling to breath. Overhead the dome of the arena showed the fallen tributes, a quick scroll of names accompanied by a canon last that seemed to echo through Tony’s aching head. While he had been unconscious, the sun had set on the second day of the hunger games.
Clint continued on. “Steve never introduced you to Dottie? He loves Dottie! She's his favorite cow.”
Steve had to take a breath after hearing Tony's whole speech. Never in his life had he heard such absolute
It cut to a shot of Steve yelling that he volunteered, as he ran towards the stage.
“You are going to help me. This is good for both of us, less competition. And once you do this for me, I’ll let you go.”
“I like hearing you talk. Now tell me again.” Tony insisted, holding his hand and humming as they walked. Steve smiled and started talking.
“It’s not a sport! It’s a lifestyle!” he said, with mock outrage.
“So what exactly is going on here?”
“I don’t want you to be perfect, and I’m not asking you to stop fighting. I tried to retire for Pepper, and it was like cutting out all the most selfless and noble parts of myself. We’re fighters Steve, down to our bones.”
Tony scoffed. “Not a full patent, those take forever to get approved. But the preliminary rights, yeah. I can do this, I know I can do this,” he pleaded. Steve stood up. He was starting to get excited. He felt hope blossom in his chest.
“Wait! No!” Steve stammered while Clint yelled over top, “I’m coming too!”
Cake? Tony mentally scrolled through the list of drugs he had personally had a chance to try. There were always a lot of things floating around the Capital, no laws against it unless it made you violent. If anything Obie liked it when everyone was either blissed out or hungover because they meant they weren’t trying to cause him trouble.
Tony paused to look at Steve, his eyes so blown he could hardly see a ring of blue, his hair sticking up, and his lips red and wet.
“Because he gives me eggs. Right, Steve?”
Tony rested his hand, palm up, on his Steve’s leg. He hesitated.
“So that’s a yes. Where do you live? I’m coming by to pick you up. I want an official tour of Brooklyn.”
“Never listen to Clint, he’s worse than you. Now give me the hammer.” She held out her hand expectantly. Steve clutched the hammer to his chest, then relented, placing it in her hand. She gave him an encouraging smile and shooed him out the door, where he immediately ran into Tony.
“Escaping, come on!”
The End
“Right when the games started.”
It wasn’t the worst kiss Tony had ever received, that honor went to the time Tiberius kissed him without permission while drunk then immediately threw up on his shoes. This one was still bottom ten though. The cut on Tony’s lip stung and Steve drew back before he had the time to process what was happening.
“No, I’m hiding. You go bring
“I pulled some parts out. It’s no big deal, I know where they go and I’ll put them back after Tony fixes the heater, and we can bring him home tomorrow, no skin off anybody’s back.”
“We can talk tomorrow when we've calmed down. Good night. I'm sure Jan will be happy to find you some clean sheets.”
Steve tried to pull off his jacket and Tony grabbed his hand. “Steve, Steve,” He struggled to think of any argument to convince Steve to stay, any plan that could keep them all safe.
With a beep Jarvis sounded an alert. “There is a 99% match found for the criminal known as Maxwell, and his partner Kane. They are attempting to break into a house just outside the city limits.”
“Either that or you fight him. That’s how I usually do it.”
Steve’s face went red. “Reading is not
Tony rolled his eyes and didn’t bother to respond. Steve put an arm around his waist and they drifted off to sleep.
“Symbolism, Tony. Why is half your suit grey?”
“Nothing.”
“What if someone attacks us?” Peanut to his eye.
“And you ignore what you know to be true, and dally where action is needed.”
His friends gave him a concerned look but didn’t stop him as he left the dining hall and went back to his assigned room, his steps just slow enough that no one could accuse him of running. He shut the door and slid down the wall to the floor. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Tony wasn’t supposed to be fine. Steve had spent so many years taking care of Tony, making sure he went to bed at a reasonable time by physically hauling him upstairs, making sure he ate by bringing food down to the lab, and a million other small things like reminding him to not forget his coat. Steve had always felt that Tony lived life so carelessly, and Steve was doing a great service helping him because otherwise he would fall apart.
“A lot has changed on the outside while you've been here living pretty with Steve. The helicarriers would probably be the least of my problems.
“I’m not happy.  I proposed for the wrong reasons.  Didn’t want to be alone anymore.”
“Plate, Cap.”  Tony sees Steve wince at the nickname before presenting a second plate.  Forks in hand, the pair take their meals over to the dining room table. Tony drops his dish in his spot and turns back into the kitchen, head halfway into the spice cupboard.  He returns and sits across from Steve, popping the small spice container open and sprinkling his eggs.
“I’m okay, kid.  All good.” He hesitates before flashing his routine smile, lips failing to hold the happy expression for long.
“I'm so sorry.  I know it's selfish, but you need to survive.  Please, Tony.”
They board the Quinjet half an hour later.
The sound of actual voices makes his ears blare. Tony is glad he passes out from the pain.
Barnes sat frozen as Tony flipped the blankets and scrambled toward him until he was knee-to-knee with his parents’ killer, reaching fingers shaking as they went to clench the man's nonmetal hand.
Steve looks back over at Tony.  His face is flushed and smeared with dirt.  Tony tries to not break down as the blonde starts walking again.  He somehow makes it to the wall to his left before he sinks to the ground, head falling to his knees as his chest heaves and arms shake.  He cannot look up as the pair passes him even when he hears a pause in movement and feels a light touch on the top of his head.
“Oh God, what did we do Buck.”
couldn’t call you even if I still had that ridiculous paperweight.  So, since you can’t stick with your usual mantra, how about you crawl back to whatever deluded part of my mind still has me hallucinating that you ever gave a shit.”
“Or we could put on a movie?  Never got around to seeing...how did you describe it again?  ‘Idiots bring back dinosaurs and are surprised when they turn into breakfast.’  Cretaceous Park? Bet Peter will say it’s another one of those really old movies.”  Chuckling, Steve stands and points to the remote on the coffee table.
The grip on his arm tightens. Tony masks his wince with a scowl.
“Perhaps it would be wise if I left.”
“He requested to be put back under until the HYDRA brainwashing no longer works on him.”  Peter pops up and walks over to the window. Tony decides to follow suit, ignoring how Steve’s eyes follow his movement.
“I think you’ll look good clean shaven.”
The teen disappears from the room so fast that Tony has no idea where he went.  Steve stops once he’s a few feet from the other in the kitchen, now close enough to see the food on the stove.
“We’ll do anything to make things right.”
He dons a generic grin before he turns back to the mirror.
“He's a fucking kid! And I made a custody agreement with his family, which means--!”
Steve meets him halfway.
OH I am so sorry y'all for the long wait.  I have been half-way done with this chapter for a while now.  In the last month I (1) got a new job (YAY) and (2) started studying for my next exam.  Welp.  But since then I've planned out the next three chapters of this story, so there's that.
“Next time you see him, Tony will be a new man.  The Tesseract seems to have that effect of people.”
Steve hand stops reaching forward, and his whole expression turns cold.
The heat behind those repeated words make Tony’s next comeback die in his throat. Captain America is no longer manhandling him, but he’s towering over the smaller avenger and pushing into his space, and Tony suddenly wants Steve to take a fistful of his hair and yank him back
Steve gives and takes.  Tony needs to learn to tell the difference.
“How about we go somewhere a little more private. Wanda?”  The two women helped Stark stand, taking him to the elevator and disappearing.  Sam looked down at the empty cushions and then over to the blonde next to him with wide eyes.
T’Challa continues to move forward, checking the unresponsive man's pulse with a deep frown.
Tony no longer left the bed unless he was forced to do so. He ignored most of captor’s comments and only ate when necessary. Steve resisted the urge to knock some sense into his house guest as Tony grew more indifferent by the day.
“Would you like some pancakes? I have to head out here in a bit, but we can have breakfast together before that.” Steve pulled out a pair of plates and held them out to Tony.
Barnes scowled, eyes wide and suddenly angry.  Tony scooted to the opposite side of the bed after the supersoldier slammed his metal fist on the armrest.
“I'm okay.  I'm just happy you're alive.”
“Hardware?  You mean--the phone?  Banner found it and used it.  That’s why-”
“I definitely over reacted.  Obviously you're right; Barnes is innocent.  But tell me why I acted the way I did. If you can tell me what went wrong, maybe you're not the fucking hypocritical robot you seem to be.  Maybe there is still something here left to salvage.”
Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve.  The blonde almost seems to smirk before his lips thin.  He takes Tony by the arm and walks them over to the Quinjet.
“Have you been to that Italian place down the block?  Was considering trying it out.”
Barnes took a deep breath before nodding.
“Your shield, Captain.  Either he left it behind or Stark is still here.”
“Thirty minutes.”
“Bruce is not, but he’s been MIA for awhile.  Same with Thor.” The supersoldier dipped his head to catch the other’s drifting eyes.
“Haven't been able to sleep very well knowing my Nazi ex-boyfriend shares the bed.”  Tony got a glare and stony face as a response. Steve looked like he wanted to say something, but he instead turned back to the stove and killed the gas.
“Tony?  What’re you doing up this early?”
“If he gets his hands on all six infinity stones, fifty percent of the population of every planet in this galaxy will be randomly selected and wiped from existence.” Tony stops himself from reaching for Rogers's familiar fingers to help his own from trembling. He watches as Cap steadies his forearm, grip tense and hesitant before he drops his hand down to Tony's and squeezes.
“Okay.  I'm going against my better instinct of absolute hatred and frustration and giving you another shot.  Since I can't remember you royally screwing the pooch, we can try to make this work. I won't promise anything when my memories return.  I doubt you're lying, and if you are you're a damn sadist, but I am guessing reliving the last few days will be no fucking walk in the park.”
“This is why the Accords can’t work, Stark.  Those families--were you able to help them? Or did Greece’s Prime Minister tell you no, the Avengers needed to stay out of their country’s affairs?”
“Lay it on me, Cap.  Crazy fever? Slow, painful death?  Inability to ever be happy again?”
Little Bucky & Tony bonding here.  I may have fallen into some WinterIron in the last couple of months.  Stony is still my one true love. <3
“Believe me, I have been trying to get him to go on dates for years. I would ask you for suggestions, but I know your flings pre-Iron Man were destructive in nature and Pepper has been your gal ever since. You two still on hiatus?”
“War?” Rogers tries to approach the two geniuses, but Steve steps between him and Tony with a different dark look in his eyes. Rogers scoffs, looking past his future self and over at Tony, disgust written on his face.
He forgets that face when his arms are full of dust.
The same hand that embraced his this morning now crushed his knuckles until Tony could only see white. He heard a string of pops before the grip released.  Tony dropped to his knees and folded over, clutching the misshapen fingers to the reactor in his chest.
“Did you?  When you boarded this ship, did you really think you wouldn’t make it out of this one?  Once you save the doctor, then you can turn around and come back home. We can regroup, and we will take Thanos on together.”
Tony sees white as he starts jerking harder into Steve’s hand.  He comes hot and heavy all over that palm, and his sight starts to bubble back slowly until he can see the pleased smile on his tormentor’s face.
“I can’t fix anything if you won’t talk to me.  Olive branch, Shellhead. Just take it.”
“Another panic attack?” Tony nodded, moving back under the spray. He handed Steve the soap and washcloth and let the supersoldier bathe him. He ignored the soft kiss on his thigh as Steve scrubbed his legs.
?  You fucking knew and never told me.  And as for your shit excuse for comfort--hopefully those lies can keep you warm at night when you’re out there killing innocents yourself in the name of justice.  Believing I could ever love you was the
“I am under orders.  Steve said you were allowed Benadryl if you had issues sleeping.”
Sam dives down and fires at a cluster of metal canines soaring after Peter.
“James, Pepper just went upstairs. She didn't take any of this very well.” Natasha moved her gaze to their leader.
“About damn time.  Now, leave. I must escape this timeline to not further contaminate it.  Speak with my counterpart on the eventual side effects you may encounter.”
—are definitely not asleep, but they’re not here either, and the thought of going out to dinner alone with Tony is equal parts thrilling and terrifying. A warm dinner at a two-person table is so intimate and he wants to tell Tony that he really appreciates it and he’s glad they’re finally friends and that he’s sorry about Pepper, and sorry that he’s been so distant, it’s just winter isn’t a good time for him—but what comes out of his mouth is: “We’re mom and dad?”
Some hours later, Steve comes across an article that makes his heart drop like a boulder. Maria and Howard Stark killed in a car accident. An
, god no, it’s just that you were sharing so I thought, gee, better pitch in with my bit so Steve doesn’t feel all alone, so… So stop laughing at me.”
; Clint says,
“Do you want me to stop?” Tony asked, hoping the answer was no. As awkward and uncomfortable this was, Steve was hot and tight, and the sensation of the real-life Steve on his dick was enough to silence the perpetually disappointed, imaginary-Steve in his head.
He turns and it’s Stark, lying on a bed next to him, hooked up to various heart monitors. Stark grins and lightly knocks on his arc reactor. “Had a little issue with this thing. They’re just doing some monitoring. What’s the deal with you?”
“C’mon, baby,” Tony chides. “Tell daddy what you want. You want me to pound your mouth? Suck your dick? Fuck your tight little ass?” He counts off each option on his fingers, delighting in the way Steve bites his lip and closes his eyes. “You want me to eat you out?” He settles his hands on Steve’s pecs, lets his thumbs circle over his hardened nipples. “Want me to suck your tits, Stevie?”
“I thought we had an implied truce. I gave you the phone so you could contact me if you needed me, and in turn, you
Steve looked up from the plane’s controls in shock. “Why?”
When Tony next awoke, it was in bed in a quiet room. The sheets were soft under his hands, and as he sat up his back felt fine. He swung his feet over the side of the bed, and stood up easily, resting his hand on the bed post for balance. He found a simple shirt and trousers on a table next to the bed, and got dressed. He pushed open the door, and cautiously made his way down the hallway, following the sound of voices. The room ended up being a kitchen, where Steve and several others from the Dragon Guard were sitting around a table and arguing.
“No,  you are, it’s just…. he looks like, and you know, you’re all… and……“ He trailed off and seemed to give up on trying to explain. Instead he switched to questioning.
Since Tony’s birthday, Steve had been putting in an effort to get to the know the man. Weekly lunches had turned into watching movies too, which had started to include video game tournaments, and before Steve knew it, he had a desk to do paperwork in Tony’s lab and a couch to sketch on, and in Steve’s room there was one of Tony’s tablets next to his sketchbooks, his bookshelf was filled with Tony’s recommendations, and one of Tony’s coats hanging up in his closet. He wasn’t sure why the coat was there, but it made him feel warm whenever he saw it, so he didn’t question it.
The door to the barn opened and Stane stepped through. Tony was on him in a flash, hissing questions too quietly for Steve to hear. Stane put a possessive hand on his shoulder, and guided him back out.
Tony nodded and let go of the wires. The cart died with a quiet whine. Tony hopped over the side and hit the side of the cart with his shoulder until they were facing in the direction that Steve had indicated. He started them back up and they drove that way for a few minutes, taking pauses for Tony to get out and nudge the cart around trees. Tony heard the dragon before he saw it, deep gasping breathes than stirred the leaves dotting the ground. The dragon blended into the pile of boulders it was laying on, except for the bright blue eyes that blinked ope as they approached. As they had gotten closer Steve had sat up in the cart, leaning forward in hopes that that might make they arrive the tiniest bit faster. Tony opened the door and Steve limped over to the dragon on his own power, collapsing at its side and hugging its neck. The dragon made a pained sound and tried to lift its head, dropping it back down before it made it more than a few inches off the ground. Tony got the med bag from the cart and cautiously walked over, watching the dragon's five inch long claws curl and uncurl on the ground, cutting furrows into the dirt. Steve waved him closer.
“I’m not running my mouth like usual until I piss you off?”
“And you still came changing into the river after me?” Steve shook his head. “Of course you did. No self preservation at all."
“Yeah, that sounds rough, buddy. He seems like a jerk.”
Clint straightened up from where he had been slumped against the wall. “Holy shit, are you serious? Hell yeah!”
Jan and Clint stumbled downstairs as he made up the first plates. They dug in happily, and he took his plate and Tony’s upstairs along with a couple forks and a large mug of coffee. As he walked down the hall, he ran into Bucky.
“Look man, I’ve seen the way he looks at you, and it’s adorably sappy. But compared to the way he looks at a broken stove? You have no chance. Now, take this hammer, and go fuck up our washing machine before someone lures him away with a faulty toaster.”
“God Steve, I thought you were dead.”
“Are you Tony Stark? Oh my god you are! I’m your number one fan, I’ve been following your insta since you had less than 100,000 followers!”
Steve blushed, embarrassed. Curse his Irish skin. “I couldn’t find you, and I thought, well, actually it’s pretty obvious you wouldn’t fit when looking at you now, but I mean, at the time, and you're kinda small? And when ever I was looking for something and told my Ma I couldn’t find it, the first thing she’d ask was if I’d checked under the bed. So, I, uh, I did that.”
Steve shook his head and took it. “You’re nuts. We’re eventually going to have to kill each other, and you’re giving me your food. Are you still thinking that this is all some big mistake and your friend the President is going to swoop in and save you?”
“Do you like hamburgers?”
In all of his years of (sort of) watching the games, nothing like this had ever happened.
“Does it matter? Seriously, help me with this.” Tony pulled out his phone and started composing an email. “Dear SHIELD,” he started, but was laughing too hard to continue, so Steve grabbed the phone and started typing.
“You can double check the numbers right here. Monthly compounding on the original loan adds up to more than you have there. Sorry, son. It’s not enough.”
The door of the supply closet burst open to reveal several peacekeepers, with Stane at the front. Chrsitine stood behind them, holding a camera.
“I can’t a wait a few days, my dragon needs me now. She’s hurt, and she won’t last much longer without help. I have to go. Please, help me.” Steve looked up at him with blue eyes clouded over in pain, and for a second Tony flashed back to the dragon in the courtyard, it’s blue eye bright with wildness and life. Against his better judgement he nodded.
Tony stood up and smiled for the camera, waving and blowing kisses. “Thank you, thank you!”
Steve glanced around his team to judge their reactions. None of them seemed happy, most likely hoping for full absolution for facing the coming threat, but it looked like they would be willing to settle for this for the time being. Steve was going to fight in the upcoming battle even if the UN sent their entire security force after them. Still, things would be significantly easier if they didn’t have to worry about staying on the run and could reunite the teams. Steve nodded decisively.
“Like what exactly? There's no other way to get the money in time. The banks gonna repo the ranch. And even if we do get the money, we're still too short staffed to take care of this place.”
Steve clenched and unclenched his fists. He had been waiting to meet with Stane for over an hour, and his patience was wearing thin. If it had been any other person, and if his pack had been where it had been a year ago, he would have already walked out. Hell, if his pack was how it was for most his life, he wouldn't be here, period. He had never been any good at this kind of stuff, and that was fine, it was a nice joke, Bucky or his ma would laugh at his stumbling efforts at diplomacy, then they’d go sweet talk him out of whatever hole he'd dug himself into. And right now, he was in a hell of a hole. So he sat in an uncomfortable post modernist chair, and stewed in his hatred for the over the top opulence of the waiting room. Peppy elevator music struggled to cover the loud ticks of the artsy clock hanging above his head. He tapped his foot in time with the ticks until the receptionist glared at him. Then he started tapping his fingers too, because fuck her, and this clock, and this stupid room, and his collared shirt that was too tight, and Stane, for making him wait an entire goddam hour in this little room when there was so much work he needed to get done back home….
“Um?” Steve brushed his hair back with a sleepy motion. “Yeah?”
“I hate you.”
“How are you this smart and still this stupid?” Steve asked, almost in wonder. At Tony’s scowl he held up his hands. “No, no, I’m sorry. I’d be dead if not for your help, so thank you. What are your plans for the rest of the games? Are you going to stay here?”
Howard shook him roughly. “Knock it off, Anthony. Stark men are made of iron, we don’t cry. This is all part of the games, you need to get used to it.”
“Doesn’t matter.”
” hissed Jan, tugging futility on his arm.
He frowned, and and pushed his hair back, getting soot in it. “Well, no, I’d need the part. That’s why this house is still an ice box.”
“And hombres.” Steve agreed. “Wait, hombres? It's amigos, Clint. Anyway, we swear to always have your back, through good times- ”
“Two hours?” Tony asked in shock. “Before they’re here? Don’t they need to prepare? Convince people?”
“A little of this, a little of that.”
He had drawn a rough diagram of it along with numbers at the top on a sheet of paper, which he pulled out of his pocket and handed to him, leaving black fingerprints all over it. Clint looked at it while Tony stared sadly at his still black hands. He wiped them on his pants again to no effect, and shrugged to himself and gave up. He looked up at Clint and narrowed his eyes.
Tony contemplated running, but with his bad ankle he had no chance, Raza would catch up in seconds. He was forced to keep his head down and do as Raza asked.
A heavy hand came down on his shoulder and he turned. The Captain was standing beside him, frowning. “He was too unruly to make a good asset anyway. Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?”
This story is completely written, and it will be updated as I edit and format, most likely every couple days.
Tony kept his eyes downcast. He didn’t deserve Steve’s praise, while he was lying to his face and his weapons and planes had caused him and his dragon to come to harm.
“Let’s try to find a maintenance tunnel. They’ve got to have them, they need something to run all of the wires of the cameras through. Tap on the trees, let me know when you find one that’s hollow.”
“Obie, there's something wrong. The contestant’s aren’t actually volunteers, we can’t send them into the arena.”
Steve woke up the next morning before his alarm. He shut them both off at the same time and got out of bed. He slapped on his watch and hurried to get dressed. They were going into town today, and there was a lot they needed to get down before they could go. He pulled on his pants, cursed his past self for
“Thank you.” Tony said.
“What, crack an egg one handed? How confident are you about that?”
What a glowing compliment. At least Steve wasn’t going to try to punch him over it. If Tony had kissed him closer to when they had first met he bet he would have gotten a knuckle sandwich, sponsors or no sponsors.
Tony stood frozen in the doorway. “I cannot.”
So that’s what lead Tony to where he was now, on stage in front of the whole country, being sworn in and promising to uphold the rights of everyone and to treat all the district fair and equally. The sun was shining and he felt anticipation building in his chest. This was a pivotal point; things could go anywhere from here, and no matter what happened, it would never be the same.
“First time seeing this side of things? You’ll get used to it. Happens a lot, all part of the games. You think that once you’re promoted to Game Master they’d let you have a peak at what’s really going on, but I had to find out the hard way too. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. You won’t be around for the next games anyway.”
“My liege.”
Steve shrugged, and Tony continued. “He was going to fight no matter what. If I tried to ban him he’d keep doing it anyway, without protective gear or Friday on speed dial. Also this way he gets paid and gets internship experience. Colleges love that sort of thing.”
“Yeah? Well now it's your fucking dump too, so if there's anything you don't like you can get off your ass and fix it yourself.”
Steve was silent. Tony kept his head facing away. When he spoke, his voice was level.
“And then Peter says it’s a meme. Can you believe that? A meme. That boy.”
“Of course. Remind me, where is that picture of us from my nightstand? Is it face down on your dresser, or is it wrapped in one of my shirts in your closet?”
Stane straightened, now twice as big and trapped halfway between man and wolf, with sharp claws protruding from human fingers, and standing tall on two legs bent backwards like a dog. Fur like spider legs thinly covered pulsing veins. Blood and spit ran from his mouth, his jaw twisted to the point where he spoke in tortured growls. Everyone in the barn was screaming and trying to escape, their leader having become the thing they feared most; an out of control wolf.
“It’s not like that,” he said defensively. “You left it in the conference room, I wasn’t stealing it to spite you or to keep as a stalker memento or something. Here, take it back.”
“I didn’t miss you, I’m excited to throw away that abomination of a flip phone.”
Sam walked through the door. “I got the stuff. How’s he doing?”
“Hey, don’t knock the magic. It helps me recover quickly, from all sorts of different things.” He raised an eyebrow suggestively.
(See the end of the chapter for
“A little before then. Peacekeepers have the right to strong arm anyone they want, traitor or not, no questions asked. I should have known to shut up after that. Now I'm locked up in here and going to die.”
Steve didn’t look up. “I think I'd rather have you take me out back and shoot me. It'd be a mercy.”
He gently grabbed Tony's chin and pulled his eyes up to meet his. “We’re both getting married with ring pops and Clint will be in charge of taking pictures of every outraged stuffy old lady’s face.”
“Oh. Ok. That’s good.”
“Useful. Do you want to read the note?”
and started it.
“I was talking about touching-”
They dissolved into fighting. Tony grabbed Rhodey’s shoulder. “Supposed all that is true, why would the dragon have to be here?”
“It was bad. No points awarded.”
Steve worked the rest of the day with Clint and Jan, trying to finish up even long after the sun went down. When they finally trudged inside, the house was cold and dark. They washed up, and Jan made a simple dinner of canned pasta. As they sat at the table to eat, Tony came into the room. Steve didn't bother to turn around as he shoved food into his mouth. “Too good to help out and make dinner, huh?”
They searched for an hour and didn’t find anything good in terms of shelter. Tony was sick of walking and came up with a new plan.
“Because we are running out of time," he said desperately. "Please Tony, one kiss. That’s all I ask for.”
“Clint, he’s probably dying of tetanus in one of the boarded up rooms, he's not gonna-”
Outside canned clapping played and that was his cue. He ended up in the chair across from where he had sat to interview the tributes, four short days ago. Now he was in the tribute chair, and Hammer  stood at the edge of the stage in the empty room and riled up an audience who wouldn’t see him for another three hours and several rigorous rounds of editing.
“So what, he gave you a loan? Guys like Stane, they don't give gifts, and I don't see how borrowing from him would be any better than the bank.”
Behind him, Bruce jumped off the cornucopia and stepped forward to draw an arrow. He picked one and pulled it slowly, revealing more and more wood as he pulled it inch by inch, until it ended in a sparkling silver tip.
“There's a nice hamburger spot near here.”
He jolted upright in bed, gasping. He stumbled across the room and tripped over something, falling into the wall with a bang. He smacked it until he found the light switch and flipped the lights on. He slid to the floor, still struggling to breathe. There was a red pile on the floor. Tony had forgotten his coat again, and he had tripped on it. He dragged the coat over and buried his face in it.
“Wait! Let me out too!” Yelled the man in the cell next to Steve’s. “Please! Steve!”
“Please, I know it sounds stupid, and I don’t like this any more than you do, but it’s the only thing I can think of to help Thor," Steve finished, equal parts desperate and uncomfortable. Tony thought it through. Thor clearly meant a lot to the team, and it didn’t sit well with him to let anyone die if he could help. He didn’t think that Steve’s plan was actually going to work, but it seemed harmless. Steve was nice enough when he wasn’t yelling at him or flipping him off, and he had let him into his alliance and helped him with his ankle.
“It would have been the party of the century, if Steve here hadn’t given me the puppy dog eyes.”
Obie put a hand on his shoulder comfortingly. “You can retake the training, and I’ll talk to them, how about that? Now tell me about that tribute, the one from 12.”
Steve's eyes widened as the door to the jet opened. The team piled on, Natasha clasping a hand to his shoulder as she passed. Sam settled in the driver's seat and Steve sat in the co pilot chair. Sam flipped the switches to start the take off sequence. Steve taped his fingers on the console, thinking.
Tony dragged Steve off the stage and into the backstage area, the peacekeeper right on his heels. He leaned Steve against the wall and reached into his pocket for his phone. He activated the program and a voice blasted from the overhead speakers.
“You know I’m not. We were both supposed to be backstage preparing for the opening ceremonies an hour ago.”
“Who the hell invited you guys to the wedding?” Tony asked, leaning on Steve. “Whatever, talk to Pepper, she has proof of Ob- of Stane ordering the attack. More than enough to put him behind bars.”
The air was heavy with an unspoken tension, and Tony was relieved when they continued their journey. As they walked deeper into the woods, the wind picked up and the snow grew deeper, rising up to their knees and soaking through their pants and shoes. They walked farther and the snow continued to rise, while more pelted down on them from above. Tony’s ears and nose burned, and he kept his hands tucked under his armpits. He couldn’t believe that he thought he was cold this morning, when this was real cold, where everything alternated between numbness and terrible burning. When it got to waist height Tony grabbed Steve’s arm. “We can’t go any farther!” He shouted as loudly as he could, struggling to make himself heard over the lashing snow.
“You doin’ alright, Tony?” Steve asked.
“Give me a minute.”
Tony jerked back as the unfairness of it all hit hit. “Yinsen-”
He made it sound so reasonable and Tony hated him. In the past few months of working with Tony, Steve had learned that if he went in fighting it would escalate things until nobody won, because you can't change the mind of the rock steady Captain America, and no one out stubborns the infamous Tony Stark. So being a master tactician, Steve had started trying different things until he settled on a unbeatable mix of kindness and logic that got Tony every single damn time. The kicker was that Tony knew exactly what he was doing, and it still worked.
“I know nothing-”
“We can’t do this. You’re not leaving the country in a week, if I mess this up it will ruin the whole team. What we have now is good, it’s enough.”
Tony jerked back, his shoulders hitting the rock, as someone crashed into the river, just two feet away. It was Steve.
Tony pushed himself up to a sitting position. “Prince Loki.”
Tony stood up and started pacing. Apparently the other side of the bed was still too close. “I don’t care that you’re sorry, I want to know why.”
After they died in the snow the Capital had collected their bodies, and instead of dumping them in the incinerators with everyone else, they had brought them here. Because they froze, the Capital had been able to use their advanced medical technology to revive them, like a makeshift version of cryogenics. Maybe Obie had intended to use them as a bargaining chip to get Tony to behave, maybe he intended to revive them to question them about the rebellion. Either way, here they were, defrosted and sleeping in a thick cryogel.
Tony put on the gauntlet he had been working on, and flexed his fingers, the repulsor at the center glowing a familiar blue. “Don't worry about it, I always find a way to make it work.”
Tony nodded and left the office with a quick goodbye. Tony felt his shoulders hunch up to his ears as the guard followed a step behind him. God, this was embarrassing. He should have known that the people from the districts were lying to him. It made much more sense than the whole Capital and Obie himself being the one’s in the wrong. Obie had always been the one person he could trust completely, the one he could turn to when his own father didn’t have time for him. And after his parents death’s Obie had been the one by his side, offering a guiding hand. If he couldn’t trust Obie then he couldn’t trust anyone.
Still, he didn’t say anything. They did the games the way they did for a reason, and they had been successful for 74 years. That’s what Tony had learned from school. It was important to support the games to keep the Capital safe and remind everyone that the districts were savages, and to remind the districts that the Capital could crush them at any time if they threatened them. It was the way the system had to work. No one ever complained.
Bruce worked quickly, and as soon as it was wrapped they forced the boot back on, to provide extra support. Clint brought him back a thick stick with a slight curve to the top like a handle, and with it, Tony was able to stand up and hobble forward. Steve was walking away almost before Tony was fully to his feet. He was clearly upset about something. Was Steve mad he was slowing them down? Did he regret inviting him to the alliance?
“I’m going as fast as I can, it’s delicate work and my tools are barely a step above worthless.”
“What do you mean? It was a live broadcast, it’s too late.”
Tony pushed past Steve to bend over and rest his elbows on the desk. He placed the check face down on the desk in front of him. “We-” he gave Stern glare for ignoring him when they first walked in. “-are here to pay off the fifteen grand.”
“Is this ok?”
Spellcheck is messing with me, both google docs and AO3 are saying that "untensed" isn't a real word, but I googled it and I think it is? Like defined as 'to stop being tense'. Dictionary.com says I'm right but now it's bugging me... it feels like a real word. If it isn't, or if it is but I spelled it wrong, please let me know so I can fix it. I can't think about it any longer or else other words will start sounding fake too and it's all downhill from there...
He put the torch down and walked over to one of the many holograms lighting the room in a soft blue glow. Jarvis pulled up several grainy camera feeds.
“That doesn’t mean I want to step in cow vomit, stupid.”
“You’ll find something else to make fun of.”
Steve peered over at Tony. He seemed pretty content to just stand here with him and pet Dottie. Maybe he was having fun taking some time to slow down, to enjoy the simple life on the ranch.
“And when we’re the only ones left?”
As soon as he sat down Sam had him back up, asking “Hey Tony, could you come outside with me and check over the wings real quick? Something’s loose and I don't want them to explode while we're trying to enjoy a burger.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“To get a drink and food. It’s been hours and I’m not digging any more until I get something to eat.”
Steve nodded and followed behind him.
“You shouldn’t try to antagonize him.”
Tony walked away before Liberty could respond, missing any words but clearly catching her annoyance. Steve called out to him, “Tony, do you need-”
Steve pushed his hand off and stumbled to his feet, glaring up at his uniformed self. “Why won’t you
Their morning break was called and Tony sat against the wall next to Steve. A basket of bread was passed down the line, each person taking one and digging in eagerly. Steve finished his in a few bites and looked sadly down at his hands. Tony ripped off a third of his and offered it. Steve shook his head. Tony firmly put it in his hands. “I insist. I can practically feel your hunger.”
The team surrounding him seems to fade into the background and all he can see is that photo and all he can hear is the beating of his own heart.
“Sounds fair to me,” Steve says, rummaging into his doughnut bag and pulling out a chocolate glazed.
—to gasp for breath.
“Tony – ?” he begins, but then Tony licks a stipe up the cleft of his ass and he hisses. He laps up the come leaking out of him and then prods at his hole with the tip of his tongue, shoving it in a little, opening him up again.
And that was that; Tony had tried and now both of them were worse off for it. He'd gone to stitch himself back together and instead caused himself to further fracture.
noises like he could eventually come just from this, slow and relaxed.
As expected, Steve shoves his ass backwards, and the tip of Tony’s finger is pushed inside.
“I’m just—I need to go out for a second—fresh air—”
—since you’re so obviously trying really hard to get into the spirit of things—you could come volunteer at the soup kitchen with me today.”
Tony thrust up into Steve’s mouth, sheathing his head in that wet heat, groaning, “
“Okay,” Stark says, now looking
“The Cap ornament’s the
“Okay,” Steve says, smiling, taking Tony’s hand and hefting himself up.
“Put on the suit, let's find out.”
Rogers took the next minute to clean himself before he returned his attention to the brunette.  Tony was once again breathing evenly and was watching him with red-rimmed eyes.
Steve soaks up the warmth in Tony's brown eyes to calm his frazzled nerves.  He gets up from their bed and starts to change, shot still ringing in his ears.
“You have corrected me several times stating that this is not a ransom situation, and yet you refuse to release the Stark Industries chairman to our custody.”
Steve gives Tony a hand while he's injured.  He also recruits two of his friends to care of his captive when he leaves on business.  Tony reacts poorly to the pair.
Stark and Barnes chat.
“I’ll bet three.  Also, if Clint visits, he will definitely throw something heavier than a cup at him.  Maybe the cast iron skillet?”
“Absolutely.  I am putting down fifty dollars that Tony will throw at least two mugs at Steve if he ever has to go through a menstrual cycle.”
Barnes and Rogers are standing next to each other by the expansive window in the laboratory, staring over the lush land of Wakanda.  Tony tries to give the two some privacy, but an unknowable force won’t let him stray far from Steve. He settles on a bench next to the set of supersoldiers.  Peter sits next to him, swaying his legs in front of him.
“Maybe.  Why did Natasha just drag him off like that?”
“Could use a ha--...--finitely have mor--...--drop off may be requ--”
“So why do you still have that look on your face?”
Tony finds himself on the floor a second later.  Steve is backing away from him slowly, mouth gaping and eyes wider than spoons.
“I think I lost you for good this time.”
“Want to take a break and go see a movie?  Do they still have drive-up theaters?”
“He’s not allowed to leave Stark Tower without Steve accompanying him.  He must wear destabilizers at all times to minimize his powers. Steve drove R&D off from weekly mutation trials after their testing gave him a seizure. He told me he planned to bring the kid here when things are more settled.”
“Mission accomplished!  I’ll see you later, Mr. Stark!”
“Wait.  Are you fucking with me, Rogers?”
“I don’t want to hear it!”  Steve tries to put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but he rolls it off and shoots him a glare as the kid rambles his excuse, sounding more desperate with each word.
“Because I don’t know if there’s anything wrong with you!  It’s been over a year and you have yet to share what you’re dealing with!”
“No need for Iron Man today. I'll be sure to keep you safe.”
“Maybe you should listen to what the kid has to say.”
“Boys, back up.”  Natasha pushed Steve and Sam's hovering forms a few feet from the sofa before kneeling next to her friend, using a light touch to close Tony's suit jacket.
“Then what?  Let this fifteen year old wanna-be superhero hack back into the suit
Tony looks over to his busted armor, unable to stop his mind as he's back underneath the Captain’s strong gaze and slick biceps, those four words thick on his lips.  Heats pools in his lower belly.
Pepper collected herself before she turned to face the supersoldier.  She nodded once before she moved, dragging Tony by the hand to sit him down on the far side of the sofa away from Steve.
“I'll be in the workshop.  Let me know if we learn anything new.”
Disclaimer:  I own nothing.  I am sorry for making Steve bad.  He truly wishes he was a bad boy.
“No can do, sugar daddy.  I lost that worthless piece of hardware in New York trying to save that worthless wizard.”  Done with his second piece, Tony hesitates before pulling out another, meeting his friend’s widening expression.
“Hah, yeah right--Captain All-American BS bawling on the sofa upstairs.  Bet that serum dried all of the tears out of him.”
Tony jets to the center of town when he hears Steve's chopped words.  The supersoldier is surrounded with Barnes at his back, the animated wolves attacking from nearly every direction.  The extra red on his uniform freezes the air in Tony's lungs as he steers toward them.
“You have yet to call.  Proves that you don’t need me.”
Tony felt the grip on his shoulder tighten.  The Winter Soldier finally met his gaze, and the captive did his best not to cringe under the dark glare as he ducked his head down again.
Steve stares at him, confusion on his face before he grins and laughs into his chest.
Tony attempts to smile, but the devastation of the last sixteen trials makes his happy expression waver. He tilts his head downwards, teeth clenched and eyes heating.
“He now appears to be a she.  I expect our visitors may have done something to cause this gender swap.  We should try to contact them before they venture too far from Earth’s orbit.”
“This is a one-way ticket!  Do you hear me? Don’t pretend you thought this through.”
to have my parents’ murderer only a few feet away from me while I’m unconscious?  And yeah, me being awake probably can't prevent you from doing whatever the fuck you want, but I like it when the monsters stay in my dreams when I wake up.”
“Unfortunately, yes. It seems Captain America Steve Rogers may be compromised. You need to report to Director Fury, as he's the only set of eyes restricted from these materials.”
“Stark. He's halfway across the globe. Even if Steve picks up, Parker won't be allowed to come here without him.”
“-ark?  Mr. Stark, can you hear me?  I am going to go get Happy, I’ll be right back-”  Before Peter can retreat, Tony grabs his wrist and feels his head shaking.
“Cap, just give me a minute to wake up.”
Tony scooted up next to his boyfriend as he pulled out a pair of sandwiches.
Pepper makes her appearance!  Rhodey, Wilson, and Barnes will also show up in later chapters.
These coordinates looks familiar.  Fry?”
Steve Rogers makes sure Tony knows how wrong he is.
“Tell me it’s only on the suit.  Did it touch any part of your skin?”
“Put on the suit.”
“Fuck you, Rogers.  You know how adamant I am about normal issues.  I am never going to join the HYDRA bandwagon. Awarding me immunity will be your downfall.”
He mutters apologies and promises into Tony's damp hair, staving off his tears to keep the man dry.
“Damn straight.  I got your favorite.”  He tilts the box so Tony sees the familiar green and red writing.  Tony nearly falls on his face as he charges his friend.
“I need to talk with Steve.  I know I'm not allowed to use your cellphone, but there's a landline in the living room.”
Steve takes a seat on the couch.
“Mr. Stark!  Are you okay?”  Tony lets himself be lead to the couch and sat down, stressing teen attached at his hip.
“Well, I’ve purchased eggs before, Mr. Stark, but generally they come in cartons.”
Steve forgets to hold back his strength as he lifts Tony against the cracked wood, driving splinters through the back of his shirt.  He ignores Tony’s whimpers as he presses forward, dropping their jeans and rubbing their cocks together with a tight grip.
“I want you to never leave.”
our collective decision to end weapon manufacturing to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. Exhibit A.  And the Iron Legion is not equipped for combat.”
“They were in prison.”
“Maybe was a long time ago. Now, you need to get your shit together. Tell him the truth. And sign those damn Accords.”
“Compared to the New York death site?  Yeah, Stark; I'm pretty sure your situation, husband of HYDRA's head general, is a bit nicer than the concentration camps being built across the country.  Most men with your political stance and superhero status are either dead, dying, or complying, hoping their immoral actions will allow their friends and families to survive.  And here you are, bitching how horrible your life is because Steve took a shine to you and bargained for your safety so you wouldn't be sent to die or be made a puppet of HYDRA.”
The J’naii were appalled at the idea of artificial intelligence.  When first introduced to Vision, the youngest member of their party hissed insults at his vibranium form as their fingers swirled with magic.
Tony snarls but continues forward, first running into Strange’s floating cloak and then calling out his nanobots and nearly vaporizing the kid taking shelter in one of the higher levels of the main deck, still wearing his new gold-highlighted suit.
Tony wishes he hadn’t looked up.  Steve’s face is worn and tired, but he has that stupid hopeful light in his eyes as he gives the exhausted mechanic a small smile.  Tony opens his mouth and stops, eyes darting to Peter. Peter gives him a little wave and gestures toward the approaching supersoldier.
Tony mentally curses and simultaneously rejoices when the blonde stops, mouth hanging open as his eyes bulge and cheeks burn a dusty pink.
Tony feels his fingers falter.  He screws his face into a smile and holds it there until Steve sees.
“Besides, I am fine.  Already back in action and in the makings of a suit not even you can beat me out of.  Won’t make that mistake again.”
in the next
“They’re HYDRA too?  Who that I trusted isn’t HYDRA?”
“We could really use an assist, Shellhead. Your hubby and Buck may need a lift out of this mess.” Natasha’s voice crackles over the comms just as a shrill screech fills his ears.
“I apologise for my reaction, Stark sire.  Even though gender for our species is uniform, we all have one.  Forms without an association would have no place in our culture.”
He allows himself to stare down Steve as he wraps his free arm around the woman in front of him as he downs the rest of his drink.
“Based on your happy demeanor, I must be in for a real treat.  Any known side effects?”
“Let me take a look.”  Steve takes the letter from his hands.  He looks down, then suddenly his grip is tight and his arms are shaking.
“We fixed the timeline. We have to remember all the good we did.  All the lives we saved.”
“Maybe whatever the younger one planned to hit Vision with rebounded.  They seemed determined to give him some sort of sexual identity.”
“You were about to call.”
“No, no.  Mr. Rhodes asked me to come down.  He says you’ve missed lunch. And dinner.  Again.”
“We're going to talk about it later today. She promised she'd stop by the compound.”
to you?”
“Suck it, Legolas.”
“One of SHIELD’s swat teams back in the day came across this gunk.  Of the four exposed, two did not make it back to base. The pair that returned told us how they cured themselves.”
“I just thought I could use a break. I've got a feeling I'd rather not be here when…”
and let him nearly kill another
“Yes.  This must be my guilty conscience not beating around the bush.  I nearly killed him, Buck. For an instant, I thought I was going to.”
“Surrendering him to SI would void his exoneration for his infractions against SHIELD.  Let's not have that conversation again. Instead, let's continue our exchange regarding the redirection of SI.  We expect for you to begin analyzing the artifacts provided by our organization so construction of armaments can begin.”
“Then I’ll just take a short leave while you’re gone.  I’ve been considering going to--”
“You're having a panic attack. Breathe with me.”
Pepper found herself being towed to the door with a heavy arm around her shoulders.  Once they reached the entrance, the supersoldier leaned down so his mouth nearly grazed her earlobe.
“Tony, believe me when I say no threat to your well-being was or will ever be made. You are under my protection.”  Steve stood and carried his empty plate to the sink, glancing over his shoulder back at the table. The dark bruises under his eyes and the flat line of his lips made Tony realize how tired and sad the man before him looked. The familiarity of that face made Tony’s chest hurt as his rancor started to falter. He got up and took a few uneasy steps towards Steve as the man leaned over the sink with the faucet running.
“Hopefully she makes it this time. If I find you moping around again, I'll drag your ass to the gym and beat the heartache out of you.  Probably could convince Rogers to assist.”
Tony twists the arc reactor embedded in his jacket and builds a long vibranium blade on the front of his gauntlet. He stabs the thick metal between them and cuts a rough circle out of the barrier, making Zemo freeze with his mouth gaping.  Steve stalks over and yanks the small man down to the floor, stepping on his wrist until he hears a decisive pop and a mangled scream.
Tony only manages to nod before an intricate green circle encircles Strange’s wrist and twists.  Tony loses his grip on Steve. His mind reels and a memory of fallen allies surrounds him, Peter’s crumbling body now among those few friends.
“You deserve this.  Everytime you let those damn Accords stop you from saving lives, this abuse is the least you deserve.”
“Indeed. He just got back from a mission and promised to help you house-sit while I'm away.” Steve sat on the couch next to his captive, heavy hand landing on the other’s knee.  Tony continued to stare down the newcomer rather than engage the supersoldier.
“At your service.  What would you like to record?”
Steve served the food and brought silverware and syrup before sitting across from the hunched brunette.  He ate half of his plate before he gestured to Tony’s with that look in his eyes. Tony picked up a piece of bacon and took a slow bite, watching Rogers as he finished his meal and leaned back.
“On it.”
“So did we.”
“After they broke the law!  And I was working to get them out!  The
“Ray’s pep?  Seriously? Whatever you need is yours, Rhodey love.  Sex, drugs, alcohol--take your pick. Or don’t.”
When he comes back, his back is nearly touching the wall and his head is cradled between Steve’s chest and neck.  The blonde has his arms wrapped around Tony’s smaller frame, legs also interlaced to keep himself from falling off the edge.  Tony feels as Steve traces shapes up his back, looping circles at his waist and connecting figure eights in the dips of his shoulder blades.
“No.  I died, remember?”
Tony forced a smile.  He dropped his phone in his pocket and reached for his watch, but Steve pulled him out the door before he could grasp the metal band.
“Twenty minutes, Cap. Final offer.”
Tony seemed to relax, but he did not release his hold on the supersoldier.
“Almost.  Something about me makes those closest to being family want to betray me.”  Tony shared a small smile before he eyed Steve as he sat in the armchair across from them.
“Yeah, Cap?  Kind of busy right now hating myself and regretting life choices.”
“Probably shouldn’t.  I was referring to Pepper.  Saw in the paper that the two of you are engaged.”  The fingers on his back slide up to his neck and into his mess of hair.  Tony hears Steve softly inhale before he pulls back only far enough to look at his companion’s face.
“His heart rate is elevated, Captain. 170 and rising.”
“What's the last you heard from Viz?”
When the spinning stops, Tony opens his eyes to the same dark passage in the bunker.  Steve is gone, and Tony digs his nails into his palms, pain staving off the sorrow lodged in his throat.  Peter is still at his side, eyes focused down the hallway.
“Cap. Are we seriously in Wakanda?  I can tell by the tech in this room that they have some serious vibranium stashes still socked away.  Also, sidebar; where the hell was I? They said I have gaps in my memories and lots has happened since my BARF demo.  You okay there, Steve?”
