go for those breakfast beers if he doesn’t, so. Crappy heartfelt overly-emotional pie it is. “I didn’t figure you’d, um, know. When my birthday is. Didn’t figure I’d celebrate it in the future.”
“Couldn’t feel anything for the longest time after you were gone,” Dean rasps. He sounds hollow as bone. “Just. Just anger, and pain like nothing else, and guilt—fuck, Cas, I’m so goddamn guilty. Everybody kept telling me it wasn’t my fault you were gone—”
“You are so,” Sam says, shaking his head, and his eyes are red—sleeplessness or tears, or both—but he’s smiling a little as he looks back and forth from Dean’s slumped figure to Jack and Cas’s exuberant tangle. “Goddamn infuriating. C’mere.”
He presses Cas's palms flat to his heartbeat, covering them with his own, and fights to keep his eyes open even though they’re dragging down heavy. If Cas doesn’t believe him soon, Dean
Castiel doesn’t, certainly. He is filled to the brim with the feeling of Dean Winchester in his arms again. He is drowning in him, and doesn’t wish for air.
“Dean?” he says again, a question this time, and he’s frowning in concern, and god he looks different, he looks
He imagines their faces if they knew he had an angel in the front seat next to him—one that can shoot a gun and heal wounds and decapitate a werewolf with a strong clean sweep. He wonders if Cas can hear their prayers, or if that’s the kind of thing only the big guy upstairs is privy to.
“Say something,” Cas says on a whisper, coaxing Dean somehow closer with a nudge of his hand. “Please, so I know it’s you. I…”
Even though the words are terrifying, the voice saying them warms Dean down to a place nothing’s been able to reach in weeks.
Dean mouths. Fuck, he hopes Cas can work that out. He wants to ask Cas why the Empty would bother with a projection of Dean now that Cas has said he doesn’t even want Dean down here, but it’s so cold, and he’s so tired. He curls his hands around Cas’s, and he tangles their legs together on the smooth black ground.
“I’ll know you for twelve years after that,” Cas continues, letting his cheek come to rest on the top of Dean’s head. Dean’s heartbeat stutters. “And though I was born before the air you breathe, they are the best twelve years of my very long life.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Jack says, solemn. His mouth flickers into a smile, brief and fleeting, and he leaves Dean’s hand feeling empty when he walks away.
She was much older than him, and her experience was evident even in the sway of her hips as she moved in close. When she kissed Dean her mouth tasted like wax, lipstick-thick and cool.
He’s never been to the ocean before. He and Sam had always tried to get Dad to stop off at one when they passed through a coastal state, especially during the summer when the air inside Baby stifled their skin like a weight—of course he never did it, wouldn’t have even if they
Dean can’t repeat it out loud. Hell—Dean can barely repeat it to himself, will only let himself think about it when he’s drinking with the goal of passing out and won’t hafta contemplate the words for long.
“Nope,” Sam says. “You’ve been awake for three days and I don’t trust you not to run us off the road. Keys.”
He hates himself for a moment, a blinding twist of it. Cas deserves to hear it back. Cas deserves—he deserves so much. So much more than Dean can give him, grizzled and hardened as he is, with blood stained so deep down the cracks of his hands that there’s not gonna be any getting it out. So much more than someone who can’t say what they feel out loud without the heat of their past breathing down the back of their neck.
Castiel just sits at the table and watches the three of them work, heart so full that it’s difficult to imagine eating. He talks to Sam and Jack some, but he’s content to mostly listen. He’s missed them, and it’s good just to hear the easy flow of conversation between them all, steady and loud. It’s such a stark contrast to the Empty that Cas finds himself failing to blink, not wanting to miss a second of what’s taking place in front of him.
He is staring at the place where Cas’s pulse leaps, so human, in the hollow of his throat. He can’t look up, but Cas dips his chin down to meet his eyes anyway.
He isn’t so narcissistic as to think this change came about because of his confession—though he won’t deny that it likely played a part. Dean, a man so sensitive to loss already, has lost so much lately. Friends, family, even the illusion of his own free will. And though he’s gained it all back—gained true free will for the first time—well. Castiel hadn’t lied when he’d told Jack that Dean feels things more deeply than any human he knows. This loss isn’t something Dean can simply move past, even though it’s been rectified.
“You’re shivering,” Cas says. There’s not much inflection to the statement, but Dean catches the undertones anyway: he’s worried. He’s wondering.
Sam and Jack are cleaning up the remnants of the spell, talking quietly amongst themselves. Likely to give Dean and Castiel their privacy, though Castiel doesn’t think either he or Dean has room enough in them for shame right now.
it's sam winchester's birthday today (may 2nd) so i'd like to extend a formal apology to him that he's so under-represented in this fic aldksjf i'm sorry sammy i love you
is what got you here in the first place, pal.” Dean’s heartbeat tastes like blood. “Don’t try that shit with me. You came here to make a deal—let’s make a goddamn deal.”
“Don’t,” Dean says, more rasp than voice. He flinches hard, and he knows Sam sees it. He wants to be home. He wants to close his eyes and never have to open them to this reality again.
It’s a lie, and looking at Cas, he knows it. He is touching Dean in one of his most vulnerable places, one of those places that nobody has ever touched with such care; his fingers skim the curve of Dean’s last rib, where the claw marks end, and his palm brushes the softness of Dean’s stomach, and Dean has both hands wound up in the front of Cas’s shirt before he means to.
say his name—he’ll doom himself for Cas to be able to get outta this place, go see Jack again, and Sam. Live his life like he deserves.
It’s like a punch to the chest. For a minute he can’t breathe, gaping down at Cas, finally in his hands after all these weeks. All these years.
“Sorry that I…” Dean trails off vaguely, gesturing at Cas’s coat, the way it’s gone wrinkled under Dean’s weight.
“The first time you will remember seeing me is in a barn in Illinois,” Cas murmurs. “You’ll sink your blade into my chest, because you don’t know what I am and you don’t know that I would do anything not to hurt you. It won’t harm me. It will make me—I will want to know you.” Cas breathes in, and out. “More destructively than I’ve wanted anything before.”
Dean wasn’t sure Castiel’s method would actually work, but he did want to kiss Castiel. The kiss was slow and deep. Castiel was trying his best to share the effects of the sleeping pills with Dean.
Meanwhile, Dean slid his hands into Cas’s pants and cupped his ass. He ground up against Castiel trying to relieve his quickly hardening erection. Eventually, Dean realized Castiel wasn’t grinding back, and actually wasn’t hard at all. He stopped kissing him and softly pushed Cas away. Dean stared at him for a second trying to understand why he wasn’t as into it as he was.
Sam walked into the family garage. Glancing at the sheet covered car body and pulling it off. “This here, is your uncle’s car, her name is Baby.” He glances to make sure his son was paying attention, he was.
Dean doesn’t mind the running sentences, smiling widely. He got to be with Castiel for a day longer. And that was good in his books.
Castiel kisses him softly. "No apologies from you," he says against his mouth "no need for you to apologize, you're all good." He says and runs his clean hand through Dean's hair, eliciting a purr from him.
There wasn’t time to talk before Dean walked over and gave Sam a tight hug. “Heya, Sammy, missed you.” He says and Sam hugs back just as tightly.
”Sam, I have to go. Please contact me if you... are planning on doing anything for him. I just need to think.” Not waiting on an answer, he hangs up.
”What about fucking me? Because I’m fairly certain I’m the top in this relationship,” a voice chimes from the door and Dean whips his head around so fast, it takes his eyes a moment to catch up.
Dean could practically feel Castiel's smile through the phone and it made his heart clench with love. "
Suddenly, something in the air shifted and Eileen was the first to make a move, running over to the thing... or person who changed the air around them. There was a sound of a kiss and soft squeals of excitement and hellos.
There was Castiel, drenched in sweat, deep circles under his eyes and his skin significantly more grey contrast to his sun-kissed skin in the last video. "So, I think I've come down with a fever and can't really move too much without feeling stabbed... also not to be graphic. But whatever I'm coughing up- looks like a melted alien." He whispers close to the camera. Dean notes that his lips are tinted a light blue and extremely chapped. He chuckles at Castiel's description of presumably- phlegm. "Anyway, Gabriel is on his way over to drive me to the hospital, but I think he's just overreacting because I told him I hadn't eaten in a few days-" Cas is cut off by Gabriel walking in a hazmat suit.
Dean kissed back gently, feeling arms around his waist. His lips were so soft and warm, Dean couldn't help but lick gently at Cas' mouth and Castiel hums, pressing his body against Dean's and successfully pinning him to the car (which was a weird pimp car).
They were there when he fell in love for the last time because he fell in love permanently and Sam was there to hold him at Eileen’s funeral a healthy amount of time later.
Castiel gently pulls away after a moment. Fixing the tube that rested along Dean’s face. “Need to make sure I don’t steal your breath for too long.” Castiel jokes and Dean giggles.
However, the male understands what he's trying to motion and nods. "Go ahead, I would say I will not eavesdrop... but we are in close proximity and even the curtain provides little privacy for conversation." He says with a gentle smile playing his very full soft pink lips that Dean may or may not have been staring at.
Dean awoke a bit later from his presumably short cat-nap. It was either too much sleep or too little sleep, judging by the sunlight outside it was too little. He shifts and glances around the room, momentarily confused at why it was just him.
It took Dean a moment to realize that Castiel was shifting Dean until he was on his knees, but his head was still against the pillow. It took Dean a few seconds to realize that Castiel was tugging down his sweatpants; it took Dean barely a second to know that he really wanted this with Castiel. He wasn't sure if this was for real or not, though it sure felt real when Castiel's hands went to cup Dean's ass and Dean felt a breath against his ass and he had a full body tremble, he needed Castiel somehow, right now. "No underwear, Dean? You're so bad, aren't you? You want to be punished." Castiel whispers just loud enough that Dean can hear it, "Don't you?" Castiel adds on.
"No, I'm not. I-I have pudge around my stomach and I used to be...well... I had clear skin... Now, I just- The damn freckles showed up and got worse as I got older. It's like all my mistakes decided to taint me; not only mentally, but physically too... I hate it. I want to forget what I've done and what I look like-" Dean was starting to go deeper into self-hatred and Castiel gets upset at himself, for listening to his words so long and staying silent.
Castiel encouraged him, making his rhythm more and more assured and letting him forget about the fear of hurting him. Castiel let out soft cries each time Dean’s lips touched his neck. Dean could feel the tension building in his gut as he neared his release, until suddenly they were interrupted by a knock on the side of the cabin.
Cas relaxed instantly. He set his head back onto the pillow and gestured with his hand towards Dean, inviting him on to the bed. Dean wasn’t sure what he was doing, but he got onto the bed too and sat next to Castiel.
Dean chuckles, trying to summon back up his façade, “No… “, but finally gives in “- but it was the first time that it felt so damn good.” He pauses “Usually, I regret it and barely even remember the person’s face… but I could tell you the colours and textures of every single bar bathroom wall in Kansas.” He adds trying to make light of it.
They spend the night together. Dean cooks them a simple meal and they fall asleep watching an old western on TV.
Castiel pressed himself against Dean spreading his legs with his own. They grind into each other in a way reminiscent of many of Dean’s shame filled hook-ups during his youth, but different in virtue of the reassuring praise he received, a deep calming voice covering his internal monologue. For each dirty sneer he heard in his mind he felt it be shut down by Castiel’s soothing tone and worshipping gestures. He let himself enjoy the idea of being cared for and admired.
This had to end. It took him all the strength of his body to sit up, but he did. He knew what he had to do, for himself, for his performance, but mostly for the community. He had to hold on strong, but he couldn’t, not on his own, not like this. Dean was a strong man, and could handle a lot, thanks to his father’s absentee parenting methods, but he could feel that it wouldn't be long before he would give in an put a bullet through his head. He knew that heaven was closed, but even Hell itself couldn’t be worse than his current situation. The only thing keeping him going was knowing that he would be leaving so many innocent lives to be butchered by the croatoan-infected zombies by killing himself. It was that guilt and sense of duty that pushed him to get out of bed and try the very last solution he had left.
Dean wakes up when the rain has turned to pale heavy fog, when the storm-darkness of the sky has been replaced by evening.
Dean peels off his ruined flannel, presses its clean edge into Sammy’s grip. Wipes at Sam’s knuckles, and then lets his touch fall away.
“The first time you will remember seeing me is in a barn in Illinois,” Cas murmurs. “You’ll sink your blade into my chest, because you don’t know what I am and you don’t know that I would do anything not to hurt you. It won’t harm me. It will make me—I will want to know you.” Cas breathes in, and out. “More destructively than I’ve wanted anything before.”
“Well don’t,” he says, and it’s too fierce, and he fucking means it. “You hear that, Cas? I don’t—I can’t—I don’t wanna be here without you, asshole.”
He understands why the Empty gave him this ultimatum now. He wonders how many times it’s taunted Cas like this: how many times it’s crashed in to break a heart Dean knows he himself has already had a hand in breaking far too often.
He tugs Castiel up to a half-kneel and he kisses him like that, with his hands pressed up to Castiel’s beating heart. It’s gentle, a brush of his mouth to Castiel’s, as if he’s afraid he’ll break Castiel with anything stronger.
Dean wrestles down a sob as he soothes his thumbs over the bags beneath Cas’s eyes, as he touches the softness of his hair with questing fingertips. He’s here. God, he’s here, and Dean—Dean missed him so much he almost couldn’t do it. Any of it. Almost couldn’t live.
The only outlier is the crowd of empty whiskey bottles taking up some counter space to the side, rinsed clean and waiting for Sam to take them to the recycling center.
It isn’t Jack’s fault that he can’t reach Cas—it’s Dean’s fault that he let him go in the first place.
Dean makes himself stay leaning back, staring up. “Thought we could go to the coast, maybe,” he says, unsure why the words trip themselves in his throat. As usual, he sounds too gruff. “Thought we deserved a day off. I dunno.”
He always does. Constantly on the lookout, constantly hunted. Cas used to watch him laugh about it with Sam, watch him never notice that Sam’s smiles were strained.
so he tilts his body slightly toward Dean, welcoming him closer like it’s his decision whether Dean sits by him or not.
Halfway through dinner Dean catches Castiel’s hand beneath the table, focusing intently on his burger with a slim little frown between his eyebrows. Castiel holds Dean’s hand in both of his. Castiel runs his fingers over Dean’s scarred knuckles three, four, five times, until that frown lifts away.
“I suppose I must, then,” Cas says. He shoots Dean one last smile for the road and turns around, already shrugging out of his coat.
Dean doesn’t bother going down to the water. It’s freezing, actually, the briney air sneaking up under his layers and sending a shock of shivers down his skin. He sticks to the border of pines and leads Cas to the first fallen log he sees, good for sitting on and drinking and looking gloomily out at the untouchable ocean.
Castiel keeps their hands tangled, watching the landscape blur by them as the Impala eats at the miles of road between them and home. When Dean slides across the bench seat so he can be directly next to Castiel, Castiel simply smiles and squeezes his hand; and thirty minutes later when Dean’s head droops down to rest against Castiel’s shoulder, when the roll of the interstate lulls him at last to sleep, Castiel marvels at how a love this big can even fit inside him.
Castiel laughs quietly. It’s the first time he’s laughed since confessing to Dean. It’s the first time he’s laughed in ages.
He doesn’t seem surprised to see Dean here, or relieved. He watches Dean with none of the avid closeness he’s always bestowed him, with none of the soft regard. He’s blank.
Dean shakes his head so fast that Cas blurs before him, clenching Cas’s wrists tightly as if he’ll slip away if Dean lets go.
The Empty is delighted, and Dean’s heart sinks even as it beats with the first real hope he’s had since Cas was taken.
Jack brings those that have been lost back, standing in the bunker with power shaking the slim line of his shoulders. Jack brings them all back—and Dean watches Sam fold Eileen in close to his chest, Dean watches reunions happen like a movie of someone else’s life—
It’s… it is unbelievably good, sitting here with Cas’s arm around him—good in a way that he can’t look directly at, like the sun, like his reflection in the mirror after a hunt gone bad. There’s guilt there, of course, tucked away inside of him where his guilt always lives, but it’s dulled. It’s muffled.
“Jack,” Cas says. He is so happy that the corners of his eyes are crinkled up like a starburst, and it makes Dean need to grip the edge of the table so tight it hurts. “I missed you too. I am very happy to be home.”
They’re in Kentucky hunting down a werewolf, and there’s no way to prove that Dean throws himself in its path when he sees its claws extended, but that doesn’t seem to matter.
“It’s good to see you too,” Jack says. His breath hitches a little and Castiel rubs his palm up and down Jack’s spine, a soothing, instinctual movement. A human one. “I missed you so much. We all missed you.”
But humans, Castiel has discovered—humans hang their hats on hope. Humans build their houses from it.
“Of course I’m scared, you son of a bitch,” Sam says. “I’m scared of losing you, and Eileen, and Jack, and everybody else I care about. I miss Cas every day, and I can’t go through something like that with you—“
The bunker is spotless, and if Castiel hadn’t yet realized that something had been deeply wrong with Dean while Castiel was gone, he’d be realizing it now.
Dean breathes. It jerks in and out of him like he has to force his lungs to move, too sharp, and something about the shape of him, all brittle-edged and limned by the slate gray Illinois sky, has Castiel reaching a hand over the back of Dean’s seat and curling it around the point of his shoulder.
His heart is jangling around like a fucking loose coin in the bottom of somebody’s purse and Cas is still breathing just as calmly as ever, still just sitting there, a rock and a buoy and the very tilt of the earth that’s dislodging Dean all at once.
He wonders if this Cas will stick around all that time, wait to wipe Dean’s memory until the very last second. He wonders what this Cas will do once future Cas rolls into town. Where he’ll go, and who will take care of him.
“Where are we headed to?” Cas finally asks—not like he’s on Dean’s ass about meandering this way, skipping across the country as if there’s nothing in the wide world to be afraid of. Just like he’s vaguely curious.
He hasn’t heard from Dad since that day back in Minnesota. He hasn’t heard from Sammy in a thousand times that long.
Dean forces himself through those last few stumbling steps, and then he falls to his knees at Cas’s side.
Dean looks like he wants to answer, but he hesitates, and Castiel doesn’t fault him for that. He knows how difficult Dean finds vocalizing how he feels on the best of days—and now, today, grief still lining his face and weighing down his shoulders, thinner than Castiel has ever seen him, exhausted in a way that hurts to look at… now it’s easy to believe he’d have trouble speaking.
“Hey.” Dean gives Jack his best smile, reaching out to touch his knee because it’s the nearest part of him. “You would’ve figured something out if I didn’t.”
Cas’s brow smooths, the corners of his mouth lift slightly. He’s running his finger over the worn fabric of the shirt slowly, almost reverently. Because it’s Dean’s. Because Dean handed it to him.
Sam smiles at the two of them openly from his position in the passenger seat, but it’s Dean’s reaction that guts Castiel. The way he flickers his gaze to them in the rearview mirror, the shape of his mouth softening as Jack rests his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
He drops the cooler. Settles down onto the waterlogged wood, Cas joining him a little closer than anybody else would, and grabs a beer.
So he digs up a loose pair of sweats and the softest sleep shirt he has out of his dresser, and he presses them into Cas’s stomach, who takes them with slight surprise in the lift of his eyebrows.
It doesn’t feel right going somewhere sunny without Sam. Somewhere with hot golden sand and lifeguards in ugly red shorts and fuckin’ striped umbrellas.
“Yeah, alright, tough guy,” says Dean, another laugh spilling out of him, and the heater is fogging up the windows and the wind is swaying Baby like a cradle, and he’s tired. He’s tired. “Excuse the fuck outta me.”
Though it’s nearly midnight, Dean makes dinner, and Castiel can tell by the surprise in Sam and Jack’s faces that it’s been a while since he’s done that. By some unspoken rule, the three of them stay in the kitchen as Dean cooks: Sam puts together a salad and Jack very carefully slices tomatoes for the burgers Dean’s making, chatting happily all the while.
“A deal?” His voice is sharp, and Dean knows it isn’t directed toward him. It stings a bit anyway. “Dean, if I leave with you, will you be stuck here?”
Cas sighs, hands flexing on Dean’s shoulders. He turns his head slightly and meets Dean’s mouth head-on. Lingers there for a moment.
Something in Dean’s face breaks open at the word, as if he’s been hit. He takes a stumbling step forward, weak like his knees have better things to do than hold him steady, but that doesn’t matter because between this breath and the next Castiel is crossing to him, gathering Dean up in his arms.
Dean’s arms slip around him now, take up clutching fistfuls of fabric behind Castiel’s back. He’s breathing into Castiel’s skin. Castiel can feel the bumps of Dean’s spine through his layers, pressing up from beneath his flesh like a mountain range.
They stay like this for a long time. Castiel allows himself to finally take in where they are, and he isn’t as surprised as he should be to see that it’s the barn where Dean saw Castiel for the first time in his memory. A spell like the one they must have worked would need a very strong connection to work, a tether—it’s flattering to think that their first meeting on earth had this much of an impact on Dean. Castiel holds him tighter.
“I’m really sorry about starting all of this… the Apocalypse. And I’m also sorry that you fell. Can I come in? I think we need to talk in person…” Dean insisted.
Before he could even process what was going on, Dean was spreading his cheeks, and next thing he knew, Dean’s tongue was circling his opening in a slow but intense pattern. Just when he thought he had reached maximum stimulation, Dean laid his tongue flat caressing the whole entrance at once. He couldn’t help but weep a bit at the sensation.
“Uh.. It’s me, Dean. I mean, the one from 2009… Look man, I can’t sleep, and I just wanted to apologize…” he started They had both forgotten Dean’s younger self had been sent back in time by Zachariah to meet them and realize how bad the Apocalypse is.
“I think about you constantly and it fills me with excitement and curiosity. I wanted to be able to find you so I could be your next victim so I would get the pleasure of sharing such an intimate moment as my death with you, putting my life in your hands.”
Dean wasn’t sure if he was just talking in his sleep or actually calling him, but he took a step closer to the bed.
Dean looked at Castiel laying underneath his future self, and caught his gaze, wordlessly asking for permission. Castiel smiled back at him.
“So, let me get this straight: you were able to track down a serial killer and you chose to follow him around like some groupie instead of calling the police ?”
A shiver of pleasure went down his spine. That would be a dream come true. So far nothing hinted to that possibility but Castiel let himself imagine it while he laid down onto the ratty motel bed.
As he walked up to his room, he tried to focus his mind on his plans for the next few days. His job was done in town, but he quite liked the little town’s relaxed ambiance. Perhaps he should stay a few extra days, to take a break, let himself breathe. With the key idea of relaxation in mind, Dean entered his room, tossed his belongings aside, and let himself fall onto the motel bed. He laid there, attempting to relax, but couldn’t shake the tension from his body. There was no way he would fall asleep this way. He decided to do the next best thing and get himself something to eat. As he opens the cabinet door to grab a drink to rinse down his sandwich, a piece of paper hanging from the cabinet door catches his eye.
Dean chuckled, “Yeah, sure, I mean, you aren’t scared of me and it’s not common to find people who will accept to sleep with an actively wanted man, even less hunt him down…”
He was brought back to consciousness by the impression of weightlessness. Dean was carrying him. He looked up to cross Dean’s gaze who  cracked a small cocky smile.
“Especially when it comes to you… You’re so beautiful Dean... I still can’t believe I found you after all my searching… You are my guiding star, my idol, the most important person in my life... I admire you.”
Dean wakes up to see Castiel staring at him from the opposite side of the room, fully clothed, but visibly aroused.
He slides out and holds Dean against his chest until he feels his breathing even out. He tilts Dean’s face upwards and kisses his forehead. Dean closes his eyes, avoiding eye contact, before flipping over while still in his embrace. Dean can’t help but feel comforted being spooned. It was quite rare for him to feel so vulnerable around anyone. Once he can sense his voice was steady, betraying none of the emotional turmoil around his vulnerability, Dean asks Castiel to never speak of his reaction.
“You’re…not… very… talkative tonight Dean… Perhaps… there’s a way to… get something… out of you…” he whispered between kisses.
He positions Dean beneath him in missionary, Dean’s legs wrapped around his waist, and stares into his eyes as he initiates a sustained rhythm of come and go, intermittently pressed flush against Dean, then looking down over his pleasure contorted body. If getting Dean to fuck him had filled him pride, he couldn’t exactly put the words onto what he felt fucking him. It filled him with a feeling of power, but also bore the burden of knowing he was in charge of pleasing the object of his admiration. The task consumed him, but he rejoiced himself in the idea of disappearing so fully into it.  His pleasure came from Dean’s.
“We can do this. The two of us, and we’ll get Sam back. I promise… just please, Dean, don’t give into Micheal. Don’t give up on me…on us.” he pleaded.
As he stood in the motel room, surrounded by Dean’s few possessions, he felt a surge of awe. This is where he lives. He locks the door behind him and walks over to the bed. This is where Dean Winchester sleeps. He reached out and touched the dent in the bed left by his body. It was cold. Disappointed, he wandered over to the small pile of clothing that sat on the desk. It was composed of a pair of jeans, two flannel shirts and some socks. He leaned in and laid his cheek against the soft flannel cloth imagining he was pressed against Dean’s chest. He pressed his lips to the fabric then continued his tour of the room. He walked into the bathroom and found the wall opposite to the shower covered by newspaper clippings and pictures. It seemed as though Dean was gathering information for another kill. He hoped he would be able to catch a glimpse of the body in his trunk before he burned it like he usually did. The rest of the bathroom was quite disappointing, except for the toothbrush which he picked up and stuffed into his pocket. It has Dean’s DNA,
He took a deep breath, trying to let go of the haunting memories, leaving them to stew in the stale air of the car which he had left behind.
It wasn’t the first time he decided to visit his old friend in the middle of the night, so he doubted that Castiel would mind. The way to his cot was now more than familiar to Dean. His nocturnal visits to the village guru were more regular than he dared to admit. Admitting he visited Castiel so often, would inevitably lead to having to admit he cared for him in a way he wasn’t comfortable with voicing. He wasn’t ready to take that step yet, not in public at least. But Castiel knew, he was sure he did. Dean had noticed that he was different around him, especially since he fell from grace. Castiel knew that Dean loved him, and not in the same way he loved Sam, but damn, Dean wished he didn’t. It was easy to rationalize their late night encounters by seeing them only as a sexual outlet to Dean’s pent up frustration, but Castiel knowing that it was more than that was inconvenient. Him knowing that Dean has feelings for him will only bring him pain and a sense of betrayal when Dean will have to leave him alone in this broken world when he’ll die, because he will. Dean could feel death’s scythe against his throat every morning , but for the refugee’s and for Cas’s sake, he tried to fight it for as long as he could.
“I-I love you,” Dean whispers. Their mouths touch as he speaks, as he breathes out a shivering breath. “God, god, I love you, Cas.”
“Dean,” Cas murmurs into the breath of space between them. Dean pulls back far enough to see his eyes—those gorgeous goddamn eyes—as Cas lifts a hand. He traces a thumb along the swell of Dean’s bottom lip, as careful as if he were touching something made of glass. “Are you—you can’t really be here.”
“—you ok? Dean? Jesus, you were gone for a whole day and we didn’t know where you were, Jack couldn’t reach you—”
It ain’t enough. Dean slips down off her hood, staggering a little when his boots hit earth, and the thing in his chest shudders.
“What’s it gonna take?” Dean asks. His throat is raw, tight and burning. “I ain’t giving up. I’ll ask you every day until I die, and after that I’ll crawl my way out of Hell until I find you and ask you then. You will
Instantly it is cold like Dean has never felt before. Colder than the dead of winter—an absence of heat.
Cas’s lips part as Dean nears him, the corners of his mouth gone sweet and softly surprised. He’s breathing down here, even though he doesn’t need to. His fingers clench in the fabric of Dean’s shirt.
All along his left side is Cas, sitting so close that Dean is warm despite the chill rolling in off the surf, and utterly heedless of the way the log they’re on is soaking moss and water up into his coat. Cas breathes in deeply, his head tipped up to face the sky. His eyes are closed. It could be prayer, Dean thinks, if there wasn’t that divot between his eyebrows.
“Cas,” Dean whispers. He steps close, tucks his head up beneath Castiel’s jaw. Butts softly at his chin. Castiel slides his hand between the layers of Dean’s flannel and his t-shirt, around to rest in the soft dip of his waist, and Dean lets him. “I…”
If he does, he doesn’t say anything. He yanks the last stitch tight and snips close to the wound, packing everything back into the First Aid kit with sharp movements and leaving Dean to tug his shirt down.
He can hear his name being called somewhere, an echo of voices pressed up against the wall of this dimension and the next. It thrums beneath the soles of his feet, voiceless and entire—
He’s moving before he’s even made the decision, stretching himself out at Cas’s side as close as he can get without letting go of their hands. It’s almost unbearably cold now—the floor feels like a sheet of ice, the air scraps at his lungs when he breathes it in—but he doesn’t give a shit. He curls up close to Cas, their hands clasped between their chests, and smothers a sound at the twinge across his ribs from the werewolf attack that hasn’t fully healed.
His head is bowed slightly, not quite turned toward Castiel—he doesn’t look like he’s slept since he went to bed a few hours ago—but he keeps glancing at him anyway from beneath heavy lids. Glances that linger, soft, and have to be torn away.
They’re all here. All safe. Dean kissed Cas, and Cas kissed him back, and Dean’s willing to bet that’s gonna happen again.
He doesn’t look at Castiel, but he doesn’t have to. Castiel stares at the fan of his eyelashes above the dark circles beneath his eyes, the way they spread soft as fleece, and wants so badly to stop the car and coax Dean to sit back here beside him.
“Cas,” Dean rasps after a moment, letting his forehead drop to Castiel’s shoulder. He seems—he is exhausted. Beaten in a way that Castiel has never seen him before. A way that seems almost dangerous. For a man so strong, he’s closer now than ever to breaking. “Please. Come home.”
Castiel can feel Dean’s heart beating through the translucent skin of his wrist, pressed right up against Castiel’s. He doesn’t hesitate. “Because I love you,” he says.
He’s back to gripping Castiel with careful, cautious force—a guarding sort of grip. Like a precaution. He wets his dry lips before he speaks, and the flash of his pink tongue makes Castiel want to cup Dean’s face in his hands.
But he knows the issues Dean has with leaning on others, with letting himself be taken care of. The last thing Castiel wants to do is upset him so soon—to scare him off. As much as the idea of holding Dean pleases Castiel, he isn’t willing to risk making Dean uncomfortable.
They’re all talking around Dean. He eats slowly, drinks slower. He wants Cas to reach out under the table and touch Dean’s thigh. His heart beats, birdwing fast.
Sam doesn’t ask Dean what happened. He wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders and pulls him in, the only warm thing in the room.
Dean lets his eyes drift closed. He still ain’t that comfortable wedged against the glass like he is, despite Cas’s best efforts, but… but Baby as much a home as he’s ever had, and he feels safe held by her warm interior.
—and Castiel holds him all the tighter for it, his own eyes growing hot. “It worked! I knew it would!”
The Empty’s mouth moves, but its voice echoes only in Dean’s head. Probably so Sam or Jack won’t hear and come running.
“You did good,” Dean tells him. His hands are full—he switches the bottle to the crook of his arm and he squeezes the nape of Jack’s neck with his free hand, gently like he’ll shatter if Dean presses too hard. “Get some rest.”
Cas kisses Dean’s forehead. It should feel mothering, juvenile; it shouldn’t wash Dean over like the gentlest tide.
Dean is blinded by the sudden light, his elbow smarts where it hit the floor, there are voices filling the room.
“Is there something wrong with what I have on now?” he asks. It’s solemn, but Dean can see the grin that he’s got tucked up all secret.
“It’s alright,” Cas says kindly. His thumb moves slowly over Dean’s shirt. Jack is beaming at the two of them, wide and unabashed, and Dean can’t look at Sam without dissolving. “Dean saved me.”
“I haven’t thanked you yet,” Cas says. His lips brush Dean’s skin as he speaks, right over forty years of layered scars. “For rescuing me.”
“Sam,” says Castiel. Jack pulls back and Sam’s arm goes around Jack’s shoulders easily, leaving Castiel to face them both. “Thank you.”
It works immediately. Dean relaxes back into Castiel’s touch, point of contact small though it may be, a little of that hard tenseness gone from his muscles.
There is a moment of hesitation. Then Cas lifts his arm and slips it around Dean, presses his hot palm to the middle of his lower back.
“You don’t, really,” says Cas. His elbows rest on his knees, coffee held between them, and he watches Dean eat with enough of a self-satisfied tilt to his mouth that Dean’s on the verge of blushing. “And of course I know when your birthday is.”
He settled down on the bed deciding to rest until Dean returned from wherever he had been. He heard Dean come back about two hours later and peered out the window catching a glimpse of him seemingly calm and eating a doughnut. When the clock struck 7PM, he was standing at the soda machine, trying not to get his hopes to high, but secretly dying to see him. He waited until quarter past then had to accept Dean either hadn’t seen the letter, or did not want to meet. He dragged himself back to his room disappointed but not discouraged planning another letter mentally. He remembered locking his door, but surprisingly found it unlocked.
With only the thin layer of his underwear separating his skin from Dean’s, Castiel felt so vulnerable and yet so powerful. He had gotten what he wanted, convinced the infamous Dean Winchester to bed him. The sensations of pride and pleasure only grew stronger as he felt Dean slide his hand past the band of his boxer-briefs. He leaned into the touch grinding upward onto Dean, but soon Dean was pulling away, much to his dismay.
The younger Dean, upon realizing what was going on, froze and stared in stupefaction. Castiel tried to sputter out an explanation but he seemed to have lost his words. The camp leader was about to pull away and tell himself to get lost if he thought what he was doing was wrong, but he didn’t. The Dean from the past didn’t seem all that disturbed after all. His expression was closer to surprised, maybe even with a hint of pleased… The man nearest to the door looked at his future self with a smirk.
As he watched Dean fumble with his keys, he imagined those hands around his neck choking the last flickers of light out of him after a night of unhinged lovemaking and providing him with the ultimate release. He would enjoy letting Dean take his life, it would be the best gift he could give him since he already had decided to devote all his time to his pursuit. He would need to be a special kill though, not just a roadside slaughter, he wanted Dean to hunt him down craving him the same way he had craved Dean. His death would leave Dean both filled with the pleasure of the kill and with the satisfaction of eliminating the only soul who knew him well enough to be his downfall, as his last breath would be the sound of his success.
Dean seemed to think for a moment. “Maybe not tonight. I’m not some weird masochist who does it without lube… but maybe someday.”
The next morning Castiel woke up alone in his bed. For a second, he feared he had dreamt it all, but the dull pain of sitting up testified to the veracity of the night’s events. Then he realized Dean was nowhere to be found and felt as though a boulder had fell into his stomach. Dean was gone. He left him after their night of passionate lovemaking, like some common one-night stand, like some everyday run of the mill victim of his. He didn’t even get the luxury of death’s kind amnesia. He was cursed to remember Dean. He got up and dragged himself to the kitchenette, hoping caffeine would take the edge off of his heartbreak. As he stood in front of the cupboard he noticed the notepad had been moved to the counter. He opened it up and to his surprise found a hand-scrawled note. Dean had left him a note.
Dean looks back up at him, and he can see he struck a nerve in the slight glimmer of vulnerability in Dean’s eyes before he regained his facade
He knew this was beyond risky, beyond weird, but he really did want to meet Dean at least once, and if that did lead to him being murdered, well, it wouldn’t have only negatives.
He looked so soft and confused laying there squinting into the darkness. Dean felt bad for waking him up. But what was done was done, and soon they’d both be back to sleep.
Dean pulled him closer and pressed their lips together in a passionate kiss. He pushed Castiel backwards onto the bed. Castiel let himself be manhandled with joy, enjoying the idea of his body being manipulated by the same hands that had taken lives. Sensing how pleased his admirer was with him taking control Dean felt inclined to let go of his inhibitions. He straddled Castiel gripping his throat.
He slowly works Dean open, while stroking him, never stopping the praise, except for a light kiss on the lips to swallow his moans.
Castiel grasped at the handrail with one, his legs going weak as Dean swirled his tongue around the tip before gulping his member deep into his throat, bobbing his head back and forth. His second hand settled into Dean’s hair gently pulling as he sucked and gulped. What topped it off for Castiel though, was the piercing stare of Dean’s bright green eyes, as he looked back up at him. It was enough to send him over the edge spilling into Dean’s throat. Dean kept going to ensure he had finished him off, swallowing every last drop of Cas. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and stood up grabbing a bottle of soap to wash them both off. The sensation of Dean washing him was almost too much for Castiel, but he loved it, almost as much as he loved feeling Dean twitch as he washed him. By the time they had finished cleaning off, they were ready for round two. They kept it simple this time, Dean simply pressing Castiel into the corner of the shower and pounding him from behind, then rinsing off. They eventually  made it to the bed where they laid together peacefully.
”Of course... but please don’t attempt murder on me.” He muses and Castiel laughs and he loves Castiel’s laugh.
Castiel was already picking at his food as he glanced at Dean. “It’s as good as microwaveable steak gets. Though, it comes close to State & Main.” He says as he takes another bite.
”Cas! Guess what- okay. So- I was thinking, you me, we go buy a whole ass pie. Okay? Any kind. Preferably fruit if I have any choice though- and Then- we do like Lady and the Tramp style but with PIE! Like you eat half and I eat half and then there’s one piece left-“ Dean was rambling and giggling like he was the funniest one on the planet.
Castiel nods towards her as his own sign of hello and she waves, studying quiet as she leans against the wooden barrier, keeping them from going over into the waters below.
Dean beams at him, happy that such an attractive male even wants to interact with Dean. "I'd like that, Cas." He muses, happy to move onto a happier subject.
”Dean?” Castiel’s voice knocks him out of the dazed trance he was in, blinking up at Castiel, who’s wide smile was now formed into a concerned tilt.
Castiel just seems to know because he takes a few heavy steps, passing around to the other side. His breath hitches and his heart stops functioning and at that moment, he wished it would.
Castiel wastes little time to respond, his arms snaking around Dean’s waist, fingers circling around Dean’s belt loops  as he twists his arms as tight as he can get them around Dean and kisses back with the same amount of want and need.
him now  and he can't help but admit that it feels friggin awesome from this angle. His head falls back against Castiel's shoulder and he moans loudly, one of his hands going over Cas' hand that was on his waist.
Dean wasn't sure what to think, he wasn't thinking at all. He was becoming crazy, his mind hated him and he was dreaming. Or having a nightmare. One where Castiel is there and then he changes his mind and leaves Dean all alone,
Dean stands up, wincing at the ache under his skin and gives a light wave towards the woman and then follows her through the long and narrow walkway. She motions him to head into a very sterile room. "Just sit down on the patient bed, the doctor will be right with you." She says with a small smile and then closes the door once Dean has moved to sit on the uncomfortable parchment papered bed.
And he did. He just didn’t want to think about it after he had left the room. Said he’d see Dean tomorrow, kissed him goodbye and didn’t notice the pain. Ignored the weight on him as he left. The feeling of darkness. He had left anyway.
Dean couldn’t help but be a little bit envious, he was happy for him, but he longed to do stuff like that. Minus jogging, gross.
and count how many times I hit your ass, understand?" Cas says with a top voice that had Dean in full bottom mode.
They grin at each other and Sam gives a sly smile. “Actually, I’m dating someone right now.” He says, looking past Dean as if they were over his shoulder.
Dean nods a quick thanks and presses call on Sam's contact, anxious for what was about to go down. How would he word it? Surprise Sammy, I might die soon. That wouldn't go over well and Dean didn't want to give his brother anymore reason to worry about him than what he had to tell him. He would tell him minimal as possible and to not leave California because at this point, Dean was fine. Dean almost didn't notice that Sam had picked up and muttered a 'hello' into the phone.
Dean didn’t know what to expect when he turned. He saw Castiel in his white button up, tie and both jackets absent and his black slacks, rolled up at the ankles. And his feet-... were absolutely dirty. He must have looked like he was buffering or something because Castiel came forward, a few inches away with a soft smile playing his lips.
Dean shifts his legs and winces at the paper crinkling under him. "Construction and welding. No, I do not though my dad smoked when I was younger and I eat like I'm gonna starve." He says honestly, watching the doctor nod.
What Dean couldn't respect though, was privacy. "So... why are you in here?" He asks curiously, sitting cross legged on his bed which was okay because he wasn't wearing a hospital gown, luckily.
Billie looks at Castiel for a moment before giving a short nod. “I learned that if I put you people in hell, it doesn’t end well. But he’s with his brother, his parents, Bobby, all if them, in heaven.” She replies.
It was later that night, Dean was trying to drift off but with the medication running through his system and his body hyper aware of its surroundings, it wasn’t coming so easy. He wondered if Castiel was awake and if he could bother him until he felt tired enough to close his eyes.
“Oh shit- that didn’t happen. Love you, sorry for sneezing on your camera, I love you.” Before Dean kisses the camera and the video ends.
The kiss gets a bit heated quickly, Cas' tongue exploring Dean's mouth and his hands running closer to Dean's hips. "Is this okay?" he murmurs against Dean's mouth.
Dean and Castiel make some sort of sound that was supposed to be a goodbye before their sinking into each other’s touches and also sinking onto the kitchen floor.
Dean's face burns red at the tone of his voice and his down south area has taken interest in what was happening at this moment, and Dean realized something as well. This was
"Alright, Mr. Winchester- please be as still as you can, light breaths if you can. Keep your back straight." She says through the loud speaker and Dean listens to her every word.
Castiel wants to scream. The past tense meaning of Sam’s words hitting him like a bullet. “...I know.”
”He never got to me, Dean. You know why? Because he wasn’t the one who was there for me. He wasn’t the one teaching me what I needed to live.” He says, squeezing Dean’s arm gently.
"God wanted you to be a living embodiment of stars." He kisses Dean after those words and smiles as the male allows himself to sink into the kiss and stay close.
Castiel didn’t take long, Dean assumed it was because he knew his way around the bathroom with his IV. Dean on the other hand, struggled when it was his turn. He was also less sore than yesterday, but more clumsy because of the drugs they put in his IV. He struggled to stand straight and ended up sitting in the shower chair, which wasn’t awful, but he couldn’t help but feel slightly weak and vulnerable.
Dean had just finished talking to the doctor, he had been having shortness if breath for a few days and the doctor had put him on some special medication to help with the symptoms that seemed to want to wreak havoc on his life.
If Dean didn't already have a currently hitched breath, it would've been taken away by the gorgeous facial features the male had and the soft gaze upon his eyes. "Sorry to bother you, dude, do you mind if I..." He holds up his phone, words functioning less with the guy's unwavering stare on him.
Castiel reads over the scribbled and messy handwriting of his boyfriend. He started to sniffle throughout the middle of reading it, but made no other sounds. Eventually, he finished reading it, folded it up and turned to Billie. “Tell me he’s in heaven,” he begs.
The kitchen was amazing to look at, but he moved through another open way and headed to what looked to be the living room. His hands traced along the back of the couch, authentic brown leather. Dean approved. And he also approved of the brick fireplace that had picture frames placed along the ledge of it. Picking one up, he smiled.
”Whatever happened to my camcorder?” He asks, a soft teasing smile on his lips as he quirks and eyebrow and Dean falls into a little fit of giggles that end with a few wheezes and a soft cough into his arm.
Blushing at the question and giggling at the formal wording, he nods slowly as he tilts his head to press his lips gently to Cas' mouth before pulling away. Castiel hums before getting up and leading Dean to the bedroom, carrying his oxygen tank for Dean as well. Opening the door, Dean is gently pulled inside and happily glances around.
Then he was beside the reaper-sorry, Death. It was Billie. She was looking down at his body with him, turning to face him— his soul. “Dean Winchester, I’ve been waiting a long time for you,” she says and Dean glances over, nodding.
Castiel takes a moment before he responds. “I’d really enjoy that, Dean, but do you think it’s a good idea with your condition-“
Dean was currently trying to get Cas' attention by throwing his pillow at him. "Cas! Let's play a game, come over here. We can play go fish!" He complains a with pout and a smile, taking in as deep of a breath as he can; the oxygen tube still resting below his nose.
There was Castiel, shaggier hair than he had currently. His face was kind of zoomed in, but he looked very happy and very tanned compared to the more pale version he knew. "This is my first video on my awesome and totally not old camcorder, I mean this is the twenty first century! Don't let this technology die! Anyway, I wanted to share my religious experience with you..."
He's allowing himself to be even more vulnerable with Castiel, but in a very different way. He's allowing Castiel to show him just how much he loves him. Which he will.
Dean just wanted Cas to live his best life, on Earth, with him. Things changed all the time though, but Dean’s stomach still rolled at the thought of leaving Castiel. He would never do so.
Both burst into a fit of soft Laughter. Both the girls smile at them, but give them a soft reminder to take an easy because of their breathing conditions. They also hand them dinners. Which are microwave steak and French fries. They leave after putting the plates down.
The door opens and in comes a giant moose, giving a slightly apologetic smile. “Hey, Dean,” he says as he walks over.
”I’m sorry I didn’t come visit earlier, I thought I’d let you have time with your brother. Probably too early to meet him. Though you’ve met Gabriel and it’s always too early to meet him-“ Castiel was on a soft ramble that Dean couldn’t help but hold onto, just nodding along.
It had happened just the night before and now here they were. Cuddling in Dean's bed, Dean curled up against Castiel's front. "Cas," He says gently.
Dean was far from knowing anything about his condition or how it would turn out. But he knew that as long as he had some sort of fight left in him. He was going to use it to show Castiel that he was more than just an expiration date.
Dean smiles again, relaxed. "So, you gotta show me the ropes around here, I haven't been in a hospital since I was born." He muses and Cas flashes him a perfect white smile that has Dean melting.
I’m sorry I’m so bad at regular updates. I want to try and finish this as fast as I can so I don’t leave it unfinished for y’all.
”Let me show you my hot spot then, that’s my house. Come on, I’ll drive. I already grabbed some medicines for the night from the hospital because I know that sometimes the pain is worse during the evening. And I didn’t steal them, Fawn helped me make sure everything was in order.” Castiel rambles as he helps Dean get into the passenger seat and then gets into his own seat.
He calls for Fawn back and is lead to his new room, it smelled bleached but sanitized. He's placed in a new bed, a comfier bed in his opinion and placed on a few extra drugs as Fawn noticed he was moving a bit more stiffly than usual and apparently he looked extra tired. "You gotta get your beauty sleep for your trench coat angel," She teased and Dean tilted his head curiously, drifting but aware.
Finally, he had the nerve to take his phone and slide it to Sam's contact. He hesitates before he does though, glancing towards the other male in the room. The man was reading the bible of all things. Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes. Why would the male hold faith over a God that obviously doesn't give a damn that he could possibly be dying in the bed beside Dean. Despite the slight negative thought, he clears his throat softly and watches as the man's electric blue eyes look up and pierce into Dean's very soul,
Dean handed out the cards between him and Cas and then put the rest of the deck between them, still in his head a bit. He was pulled out of it by Castiel putting a gentle hand on his knee. Dean's gaze flickered up to meet his eyes. "Yeah, Cas?"
Dean blushes and looks up at him with wide eyes as he holds the video camera close to him. "Cas, thank you so much- and hey, don't forget about me out there." He says softly.
Dean chuckles, blushing. “I just- wanted to be careful- I don’t know how much of Dad has gotten to you-“ He’s once again cut off.
Dr. Jackie's words weren't going through Dean's head. All he heard was the sad, but formal tone of her voice. It was like he was underwater. Why did this happen to him? He kept thinking as he's lead or urged to a section of the hospital he didn't want to be in. Ushered into sweatpants that must have been kept for long-term patients. He was one of them now.
Sam gave her an excited look before looking down at the baby. “Welcome to the world Dean Rowen Winchester.” He says softly, eyes watering a bit as the baby coos gently and gives a little yawn.
Castiel squeezes his hand again as reassurance as Dean's breath finally evens out, face flushed as he shakily looks up at him, body suddenly heavy from the event that resulted from the time they had climbed off each other.
Sam looks up at her, making sure she has a good view of his lips as it’s a bit difficult to sign with a baby, his baby, in his arms. “I just know that if he was here, he’d be telling me that he feels bad that you had to push a baby moose out and that he’s... that he’s proud of me.” He says, holding the baby a bit tighter and feeling Eileen’s hand on his.
"That's enough, Gabriel." Castiel huffs and Dean gives a soft sound of amusement towards their brotherly affections, reminded him of Sam and himself.
Before Dean can stop himself, he’s pulling Castiel close, arms around his neck so tight, one might think he was choking him and presses his lips to Castiel with haste. It wasn’t a rough kiss by any means, but desperate.
His feet slap lightly against the cool wooden floors as he makes his way to the kitchen. Wooden planks turn into marble tile and he smiles as Dean moves around the kitchen. His movements are a bit awkward because every few moments his tank gets in the way or the oxygen tube gets tangled, but he looks adorable in the domestic scene.
”Cas, I... I make you happy, right?” He says, keeping his voice light, keeping his eyes closed, head tilted back to press against the door of Baby.
Dean's eyebrows pull together, unsure. "What-" He starts, but was interrupted by Cas' lips gently pressing against his, the older male's hands going from holding Dean close, to keeping him still by holding his sides of his face.
"Sorry-" Dean says quickly, blushing at the sound. "Don't apologize, you're okay, Dean, I think everything you do is so damn cute." He muses and Dean whines shyly.
Dean checks to make sure. Nope, just him and Sam. “Her name is Eileen,” he says softly. “She’s deaf, but I’ve been learning ASL to talk to her and she’s really good at reading lips. And really funny, I think you’d like her!” Sam says excitedly, rambling.
Dean smiles softly. “I close my eyes and think of what could happen the next day. Like maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up and have Doctor Sexy on my tv screen. And a big ass slice of apple pie-“ he says and makes a fake moan sound that makes Castiel chuckle from his bed.
Dean's eyes reluctantly open to look at Castiel, lips parted in shock, something the angel takes soft advantage of, gently kissing him again, he still hears the 'you love me?' that Dean breathes out. Well, he feels it more than hears it, but he understands nonetheless. He pulls away and gives Dean a shy gaze of his own, a slight nod, then tilts his head, waiting for the hunter's answer. When Dean's flushes and he ducks his head into a yes, Castiel pulls him gently to one of the bedrooms. Dean's room more specifically.
Sam laughs and nods, fitting himself into the backseat with Eileen as Dean and Cas get into the front.
The kiss continues after those words, and the kiss deepens until Castiel has Dean under him for the second time that day.
Dean felt Cas’ arms still around his waist, though one arm was unwinding to gently held the side of his jaw and Dean instinctively turned his head into the touch, feeling Cas’ thumb pull gently at his bottom lip. His mouth tugs gently into a smile as he opens his eyes and meets Castiel’s magnificent blue ones.
There's some mention of Castiel's religion and he is Christian so I just wanted to let you know ahead.
”I’m going to teach you how to take care of her the way he taught me and then, we’re gonna take her on a drive, she hasn’t been out in awhile.” He says as runs his hand along her sleek body, not a rust spot in sight.
The flush across Castiel's face, the smile playing his pink, plump lips, the brightness in his electric blue gaze, the creases around his eyes; Dean loved that view. A view of Castiel being happy and carefree around him.
Cas’ smile reappears and he kisses his cheek. “I have one more surprise for you, would you like to dry our feet off and I’ll tell you I’m the way back to the car?” He asks curiously, seeming very sly and mischievous.
Dean watches as Castiel puts the box down and Dean hadn't really noticed that he kind of wanted pizza, so he goes over and flips the lid up only to be pretty disappointed that there's not even pizza in it. "Alright, Cas, what the hell is going on? What is this crap you're pulling?" Dean spins around the face Cas only to be met with a plump pair of lips against his.
Dean narrows his gaze suspiciously. “You’re supposed to be at school! You know- university or whatever?” He asks. “What are you doing here, Sammy?”
Blushing darkly, he heads to his bedroom awkwardly and sits down before hissing. He was sore. Which was strange for something that... wasn't real? He wasn't sure, maybe he was still dreaming, he wouldn't put it past. He chews his lip for a moment, trying to figure himself out and make some decisions. Sucking in a breath, he takes out his phone before hitting the call button on one of his contacts.
Sam pulls away and rubs the back of his neck with an innocent shrug. “I missed you, jerk. And you’re sick and we take care of each other.” He replies.
He grabbed a bottle of cheap whiskey from the cupboard and didn't bother grabbing a glass as he pops off the lid and takes the burning liquid down his throat quickly. He didn't notice that with a few gulps half the bottle was gone. He didn't consciously notice when he started to scratch the space between his pinkie and his ring finger harshly; a space where dark red marks were already there from the recent past. He kept itching the place on his skin as he walked into the main area, looking around, but not focusing. He didn't hear the door open, he didn't hear the footsteps; he most certainly didn't hear his name being whispered by a blue-eyed angel who just wanted to hold the eldest Winchester close forever.
”Well, tomorrow my brother is supposed to come to visit. You can meet him. He has very chaotic energy though.” Castiel warns and Dean laughs softly, trying to stay quiet and not put so much pressure on his lungs.
The anxiety slips away fast as Castiel grabs Dean’s thigh, just above the knee, thumb stroking the denim. “I love you so fucking much too.” He says, voice serious, though his eyes soft when Dean’s gaze flickers over to him.
”Hello, Sam,” He greets and Sam smiles back, surprised, but not disappointed. “Hey, Cas,” he says and smiles at the two holding hands.
"I know, Sammy, but I'm going to kick this disease in the ass, I'm not going out so easily. I want you to focus on your school, you hear? Because if you fly your ass out here to see me in the middle of your semester, I will take you off my visitors list." He says sternly and hears Sam sigh into the phone.
Sam gives a humourless chuckle as his eyes study Dean's and he shakes his head firmly. "This isn't a good ending, Dean. You're dying! I-I can't do this without you, please, Dean." He says shakily, staring down at him, the tears now falling freely.
He sits up quickly and looks around. He was on the floor, full dressed in his normal style, the glass case and the ball a bit away from him and he looks around again. He was alone. He glanced at the casing and finally saw the words of warning. He carefully manages to get the sphere back into the case without touching it again because he didn't think his body (real or not) could handle that again. He put it back in the chest and went to the bathroom, glancing into the mirror and tilting his head to the side to see the dark marks in the form of lips.
Dean seemingly gasps for his breath as his eyes flicker open and then squint at the brightness of the screen in front of him. Had he fallen asleep in front of the television? Dean looked around, this was
Dean's eyes were opened now, watching Castiel, who only looked back at him with pure adoration. Dean didn't fully believe that the look was real, but for now, he'd focus on the angel looming over him, feeding him compliments, even if he was having a hard time swallowing them. Castiel seems to take his silence as an okay and he kisses his chest now, whispering praise that gave Dean goosebumps. Dean's cheeks flushed when Cas' fingertips slid under the fabric around his waist, taking off the jeans first, then playing with the waistband of his underwear; looking at Dean's eyes, which were currently completely giving, allowing himself to be vulnerable.
Putting his phone to the side, Dean allows the soft sound of his oxygen machine to lull him to sleep.
Dean realized quickly it was the mixtape that he had made Castiel all those years ago. He gave him a wide smile. “Pop it in, baby, we got a long ride ahead of us.” He chimes and Castiel complies, putting the Zeppelin cassette into the player.
Dean Rowen Winchester gives a gentle squeeze to Sam’s hand and gives him a smile in return. “It’s okay. I can do this and,” his son gives him a sad, but warm smile. “And I’ll be okay without you. Go see Uncle Dean and mom.” He whispers gently.
Castiel tugs the fabric down his legs. "I know you don't love your bowlegs, but I think that they make your walk so cute, you look like a cowboy when you walk." Castiel watched as Dean's eyes brightened at the comparison and his length took interest in the words as well.
Sam was more excited than he let on as he squeezes Dean into a close hug. “You’re bossy.” He grumbles into his shoulder, Teasing.
Eileen and Sam taught him hunting when he was starting to get too curious for his own good, they properly trained him and made sure he knew the importance of working together instead of solo.
It was quiet while they all waited for the same thing. Not with anxiety, but with the contentment they had been searching for all their lives.
Castiel had apparently coated himself in lube while Dean was in the midst of being a full bottom. "Don't worry, cutie, I'm giving you the full pizza man package." Castiel replies smoothly as he starts to move in and out of Dean.
”I know this might be a bit more fast paced than you’ve been used to for the past few months, but I need you to let me put this over your eyes and you got to trust me.” Castiel says and Dean raises an eyebrow.
Dean hadn't realized a soft sounding moan mixed with a whine had left his mouth and he heard Castiel chuckle from above him again. "You're so cute, sweetheart, but I think I want you to count, okay? Be a
”Heya, Sammy, just wanted to tell you that... I hope you’re kicking ass in school.” He takes a sharp breath and coughs softly.
”THat’s assuming of course that I wouldn’t eat most of the pie- anyway. You’re coming tomorrow and,” he brings the camera close like he’s telling a secret.
Castiel whispers, watching the red flush travel from the tips to Dean's ears and down his neck; he watches Dean shake his head after a second.
Pulling out his phone carefully, eyes squinting at the slightly blurry screen, he clicks call for his brother. It goes to voice mail after a long series of rings and he inhales as deep as he can so he can talk.
Dean felt his sides be stroked gently and then he was being lightly lifted and moved to a new location. He realized quickly that this new location was bent over Castiel's very naked lap. "Ready, sweetheart?" Castiel says slowly as his hand brushes gently over Dean's ass.
”I...” Then there’s a piece of paper in his hand. He wasn’t sure if it was Billie or if he had gotten it himself, But it was in his hand.
Dean nods. "But you're getting better now?" He replies, nuzzling against him again, feeling Castiel nod against him.
Dean was currently laying with Castiel in the back seat of Baby. Cas’ not so missing trench coat tossed over the both of them. Dean was laying against Castiel’s side, feeling Cas’ hand rubbing along his lower back. Letting out a content sigh, he shifts his head from Cas’ shoulder to look up at him.
There is his best friend, standing in black work pants, and a dark blue work shirt with a pizza company Dean is unfamiliar with, embroidered into the shirt. Castiel is wearing a visor over his tussled black hair, one with the same company on it, and holding a pizza box in front of him. The whole thing was starting to feel like deju vu or something to Dean, there was something familiar about what is going on.
Castiel smiles softly at Dean, watching him with patient eyes. “I assure you, he is, you allowed him to see death as something he can be comfortable with now. He can know that his loved ones are where they should be,” he assures as he rubs his thumb across Dean’s knuckle.
News flash: It wasn’t a dream. Dean wakes up sore and with Fawn turning his oxygen machine up because his body wasn’t producing enough. She fixes his bed and puts the tray over his lap.
Castiel, nods, seeming to think over his words. "You seem to not like showing that you are in pain."
"Just... thinking." Dean murmurs softly, chewing his bottom lip as he watched Castiel tilt his head.
The whole room hurt Dean's eyes, the room was bright purple, practically neon and filled with stuffed animals that stared at Dean with their beady plastic eyes. He steps closer to the crib to lean over it and there's no baby.
"Breathing has been an issue for over a year, been sore on and off for around the same time, and I just recently noticed how much skinny I look." He says, trying to use his memory.
”Then I can come back and cuddle with my adorable boyfriend.” He winks at Dean who gives a childish and cheeky side grin.
To Sam’s credit, he didn’t look phased. He just looked in awe. “Was it that guy you used to share a room with? The nurses were gossiping or talking about it when I came through. May I ask what your sexuality is? If you want to tell me of course, but I love you and I’ll support you no matter what of course-“ Sam was ranting and it made Dean’s eyes water.
Dean was smiling as he ran his hands along the steering wheel of Baby. He glanced at Castiel in the passengers seat.
Dean watches as Castiel walks back to his bed, and suddenly his heart rate picks up a bit and he felt very restless. Castiel had already been in the hospital with something that could’ve possibly been fatal. Dean didn’t want to remind him of that. He knew Castiel was his freedom while he was stuck in this hospital bed, but he also knew that he was Castiel’s reminder of an awful experience. He didn’t even know how long he was going to last, he didn’t want to put Castiel through that. Especially when he didn’t know the outcomes for himself.
Billie looked a little bit more sympathetic now, nodding as she glances down at Dean’s soulless being now. “I will,” She days and holds out her hand.
Castiel hands the towel to Dean first, who does his best to dry his feet off quickly and hand it back to Castiel, who does the same. Helping Dean up, Castiel brings them back towards the vehicle. “So the doctors and I agreed, that maybe some time away from your bare walls would be good for you.” He says casually, but it makes Dean stop in his tracks.
Dean's trying to pull his hands out of Cas' grip, but if anything, Cas' grip grows tighter and seconds later Dean is smashed against his chest with arms tightening around his body. Dean could just notice that Cas' hand was playing with his hair and Cas' lips were pressed gently against his forehead. He doesn't really understand what's going on, and the confusion makes his tears stop and his head cloud with some sort of curiosity. Castiel had pulled his face away to look into Dean's soul. "Let me take care of you, Dean." Castiel murmurs between them, letting the words hang there for a moment.
