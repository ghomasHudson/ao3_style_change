“Tony what are you doing here? I thought you were working on simulations.” Steve stopped mid pace genuinely surprised at Tony’s presence.
Tony's new mission goes from bad to worse.
Downside?
Before Tony could answer Steve’s question JARVIS interrupted.
Then he turned to Steve and eyed him warily knowing that the next few hours for that man are going to be hell.
He was going to ask about them again when he saw a brilliant flash of light followed by an all-consuming clap of thunder. Steve realized why Tony seemed so calm. He finally relaxed and let Tony carry him to the helicarrier.
Barton, of course!
Wow, Natasha can be ridiculously brutal. His head was swimming. It wasn’t only Natasha though. Bucky crash landing back into his life stirred up a hornets nest in his head and in his heart.
Morning came sooner than what Steve was ready for. To think he spent the night thinking of Bucky when hundreds of people were now in an incurable coma that the ancient alien Calamity had put on them. Calamity was planning on taking every soul, not just Earth, but from the entire universe. Great, now he hates himself just a little bit more today.
“We got this for sure.” The thought about the remaining members of his team and how vulnerable they would be in this situation.
She paused and looked out into the distance pensively. "I do not recall if I have a name. I have been known by many titles these past eons, I never really thought to keep one."
“Hmm?”
As they spoke there was still a part of Steve’s consciousness that was hyper aware of Tony’s absence.  But he still listened as intently as possible.
"No problem, which one do you want?" Angie smiled at Ellie.
That has a nice ring to it. Because that’s what he is, a stupid dumb ass for giving his heart away, for actually letting someone get so damn close, closer than anyone has ever been.
Tony looked down at the mess of dishes.
“Kevin, it doesn’t matter. They will protect you from the zappers. Right now this is the only way to get you kids out of here as safe as I possibly can.” Steve replied holding the child’s shoulders and looking him in the eye.
Natasha regarded him momentarily before getting to the point.
He continued,
The soldier was having none of it and tried punching the Captain with his left hand. He forced his face away and twisted his arm back until he heard a snap, successfully breaking it and making him drop the knife. The soldier wailed in pain and Steve use that opportunity to take the man to the ground. They both hit the pavement hard.
"But I thought-"
He nodded mutely as he made his way to sit next to her.
"Couldn't you have just snapped your fingers and killed it?" Sam asked warily.
"No! Tony wait!" Steve reached for him but he was already gone.
“You’ll have to be more specific.” Tony’s said uncomfortably.
Wanda nodded in agreement and followed close behind him without resistance.
“I don’t? What happens if I press this button here?” He said as he pressed the button.
“Tony, where are you on your ‘T.C.T.C.D.’ repairs?” Tony dramatically rolled his eyes showing his distain at being handled so ‘officially.’
“Yeah, actually, I might,” he began. But before Pepper could utter a sigh of relief Tony continued, “when hell freezes over or when pigs fly, you know, which ever comes first.” He finished deadpan.
Tony could not contain his amusement at that one and grinned in return. It was the exact same thing he himself would have done.
He stiffly maneuvered the laptop back over his lap and struggled to open the lid. He wedged the lid between his teeth and pried it open. He did his absolute best to complete the code one-handed. Mercifully, even now, there were still a few Wi-Fi signals available that he was able to piggyback off of. He sent the code to Jarvis and hoped beyond hope that the AI could make it work. He did the best he could up to this point. He closed the lid and hid the computer the best he could in a nook he found in the façade of the building.
He ran to the end of the bus but when he looked across the street the man was gone. There was absolutely no sign of him. He searched the streets, observing the other pedestrians to see if any were reacting to a strange man running about. But all seemed utterly unperturbed.
“Shit.” Tony uttered as he hurriedly knelt in front of the soldier to examine him.
“I really don’t know what to say… It’s one thing figuring all this out for strange adults but now it’s mutant kids on the line.  I just don’t know anymore…”  Bruce was torn up about it.
"What if- " he coughed. "What if we make another deal?"
Everyone stood completely still. No one dared to move or even breathe. Once a little over a minute past Tony broke the silence first.
Soon enough Steve's attention turned to his latest work. That red and gold flying armor. He idly wondered about the man that flew something so… Ostentatious. What kind of man had the gonads to create and fly something like that?
"Daddy, you look scared."
But before he could ask what that time was, the all-consuming resounding beep sounded off again.
“I will admit that to a degree. At least you took to Rock well. So, I forgive you.”
“Ow. Ow. Ow. Stop!” He grabbed her hands so she couldn’t hit him anymore. “You’re the one who distracted me.”
Steve was shocked out of his thoughts at the newcomers voice.
As he approached he could feel pulsating energy coming from within.  He just had to find a way in.  He did a perimeter check and found that all ground level entrances were all shockingly welded shut.  He had no idea what was going on in there.
“Did you just check out?” Bucky demanded, staring at Tony incredulously.
"Can I see what it is?" Ellie asked as they exited the store.
“So what exactly does that mean?” Maria asked.
“‘You mustn’t dwell too hard on the ‘what ifs.’  There has been much in your life that had been taken from you.  And though it is healthy to remember them and give them the respect in time to mourn the loss you should not dwell and yearn for them.  True it is easier said than done and there have been many times when I myself have dwelled and yearned for the ‘what ifs.’
“Hey, in my defense I was not aware that I was being as she put it “a total dick face” and that if I didn’t shape up I was going to be “wearing my ass for a hat,” like literally.”  The genius alleged with a shiver.
His statement also had an underlining tone to it.  Tony has heard it before and understands it as being ‘if you don’t do what I say I will drug you and make you go to sleep.’  There may have been a timer two in which this has actually occurred.
“I’d been fighting with myself for days now on whether or not I should.  I wanted…  No, needed to know I was doing it for the right reasons.”
“Oh, come on, baby doll, time to go home.” He laughed.
I love you Tony. Always. My biggest regret is that I never got to tell you face-to-face and kiss you once more.
“I’d still want the chance to fight. Even if the world still ends. I wouldn’t want the end to come and think well maybe just maybe if I had done more… I’d rather think that if I did everything I could and the world still ends, I’d somehow be okay with that you know?”
~Flashback~
Steve grew more irritated. Calamity wanted to continue to play this game with him. Only, he was not playing.
“Well fuck me running backwards!” Tony responded much more elegantly this time…
Steve walked around for awhile with no destination in mind.  He was just thinking, and started wandering from hall to hall with nothing particular in mind.  He thought he would go to his quarters but had decided that they were much too small to contain his anxiety, recalling how not so long ago he was pacing, awaiting the arrival of their special guest who had unfortunately left so abruptly.
Find out All this and more in the chapters to come! So, Please come back and read some more!! Don’t forget to leave me a review and let me know what you think! All comments, questions and theories welcome.
Tony had the irresistible urge to clap after that epic brilliant speech, though he was sure he might get lynched… Oh fuck it!
The Captain began his onslaught fists in an attempt to subdue his dark assailant. The soldier tried to buck him off but Steve was unyielding, tightening his knees around the soldier’s ribs. The Captain gave the deadly assassin a jarring headbutt that resounded with a sickening crack. Steve saw flashes but wasn’t going to stop for the life of him. The soldier stopped his assault just long enough for Steve to grab the edges of the mask and rip it off.
“We knew that was going to happen Tony she told us.”
“Keep going!” Steve shouted.
Who does he love?  The man with the artificial heart.  Artificial…  Artificial…  He has an artificial body…  No not body, armor.  Iron armor, not actual iron but called iron…  Armor…  Iron something…  Iron suit?  No…  Iron person?...  No…  Iron Man?  Iron Man yes!!  It was Iron Man!
“Okay, how does it feel now?” Tony asked.
A/N: And another one bites the dust. Guess what everyone? Next chapter is all about Steve! Not only is it all about Steve, but were also going to have a significant amount of the long awaited Stony action! Finally! Be sure to tune in for next chapter.
"What our scholars could decipher was that people fell asleep and never woke up. That’s all we were really able to come up with the entry referenced to this person. Soon after, Asgard went on a search for other worlds of similar fate. There had been five others as far as we know. But in the end that is truly all we know.”
There was screaming and shouting happening all around him but he could hear none of it. His mind was so utterly focused on Bucky he didn’t even sense Iron Man make a move. He was so focused he could not process anything else but Bucky’s visage. The way his gaze shifted around a moment in fear before his right arm fell limply at his side and many expressions flitted across his features. He looked Steve in the eye and held that contact adamantly. He silently conveyed remorse, gratitude and acceptance.
“Do you think you’ll need anything?” Tony and asked as he approached Steve and grabbed his shoulder.
“Good, can we get started now?”
The X-Men had gotten hit the hardest. Of all of Xavier’s crew there were only four remaining.  Charles, Hank, Scott and Ororo were the only ones left.  And with gut wrenching horror and a wretchedly jagged pill to swallow they had discovered that Calamity had claimed the entire school, every single member, just before her arrival to the Avengers Compound.  Their own misery was rolling off of them in waves.
“A Doe blind in one eye was accustom to graze as near to the edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: ‘O wretched creature that I am! To take such precaution against the land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for safety, so much more perilous.’” Steve finished with a sigh.
Soon after Tony went back into thoroughly ignoring Steve which only served to irk him further.
Chapter Forty-Six: Desperate but Not Hopeless
“I do want to look at it. But like Clint said there’s no telling if what ever is on it is safe to view.” Tony sighed.
“Perhaps you should start with falling for a Stark.” Pietro suggested with false innocence.
“My hearing aid.” Tony said matter of factly.
Bucky told him once a long time ago that the reason he was able to read him so easily was because ‘it all showed in his eyes.’ How long had Tony been observing him to realize such a personal detail?
“Nevermind, Babydoll, I thought I remembered something but it’s gone now.” He said solemnly.
“NO!!” Tony cried out in panic.
The world is ending.
'It was like a countdown.' He thought regrettably.
"Nothing too big, I figure a two by three should do well."
Once it was airborne he pulled out yet another gun then continued to shoot away.
Barnes smirked and stared at him for a moment, he rose one eyebrow then took a big gulp of scorching hot coffee.
He grasped the edge of the bloodsoaked garment and lifted it gingerly. He gasped shocked at what he saw.
Knowing he had been caught Tony quickly copped to it.
Priorities! Gotta stay alive.
Steve shook his head sadly.
Jesus Christ the guy did not sound good.
Barnes nodded in understanding. "Tell him bye for me?" He asked as he quickly bounded for the door just as another red alert sounded.
Steve watched him.  The Professor remained calm and patient.  He had to be sure, Steve started an assault of all the most ghastly and rude things that he could think of from horrible and scathing insults to the scarring things he saw on the website Clint tricked him into viewing.
“This had better be good Cap. I was in the zone.” Tony stated flashing Steve with an obnoxious grin.
Steve wasted no time getting Ellie and himself into the car that was now pointed to the road. He just shoved himself, Ellie and the suitcase into the back seat.
The Captain can just feel Tony seething.
“Hells yeah! It’s a date then.” Tony stated excitedly as he started walking the other direction.
Rumlow apparently didn’t like his utter lack of response because in seconds he was charging Bucky with an enraged roar. His fists were raised ready for combat. Bucky dodged right, sidestepping slightly. Rumlow’s punch missed his face by mere millimeters. He felt the air displacement flutter over his bullet grazed cheek.
“Where do you wish to be freed to?”
He did another sweep making sure everything was in its proper place.
“Listen, there is a sub floor that opens. The warehouse itself is a front. I know the code to get in, there are…” Steve paused taking out a rough schematic of the building he drew up. “Only five security cameras. Two here and three here. We can definitely bypass these three easily. However, these two will be tougher.”
"And the second?" Barton asked, now curious as to what Barnes had to say.
“Oh! I see it, I get it!” She exclaimed astonished.
“Will do Cap.”
The extreme severity of the situation was starting to call for dangerous measures. Then this miraculous young man stepped up and took control simply and completely.  Truly with this man they could overcome…
Before Tony could reply scathingly Barnes spoke first.
Even Tony came out of hiding for a short time.  The temptation of fresh homemade pie too great to pass up.  Sue teased Johnny over his involvement in the pie making process, suggesting that the pies might have been poisoned.
"Hey, chin up. Your mom is gonna be fine. She's the strongest lady I know!" She said reassuringly. "Hey, I know! Your house isn't too far away from here. How about I go get one of your dolls. Hmm? Would you like auntie Angie to get one of your little ladies to help you out?" She asked considerately.
This made Steve jolt in surprise.
Well…
First Cap had Thor manhandle him and make him leave him to fight the Winter Soldier alone. Then Rhodey would not let him have his suit. Then someone came out of nowhere bitching at him for stealing an electrical circuit repair kit. Who the fuck cares at a time like this?!
Well…
Steve copied and stood there for a moment to gather his wits. Everyone was making slow progress to the source factory, on the completely other side of the city. Steve had to figure out how to get the kids out of this city safely by himself.
“Tony, can you please be serious for one-“
Tony scoffed at himself, he really could be a drama queen sometimes.
‘Make sense.’ He paused.
“Hey, how are you doing!?” Tony asked concerned.
Who does it belong to?
Tony barely made out the soft conversation between Barnes and Steve.
Natasha brought in Agent 13, Sharon Carter. Steve was shocked to learn that his old next door neighbor was not only an agent but Peggy’s great niece. His mind was certainly blown. No one blamed him for shooting daggers at Fury all through that day.
“Hey now, Director Fury is right we should not be letting this get to us.  The more destructive we allow our minds to get, the easier it would be for the alien to in fact control our minds.  Wouldn’t you agree Professor?”  Summarized Coulson, looking to the professor for affirmation.
He felt the impact resonate throughout his entire body, but was happy to be successful in knocking the bot away from Natasha. Steve hit the ground with a deplorable thud causing him to go into a coughing fit laced with blood.
“No, no, we’re good. As long as it’s not something over the top shocking like it was with Steve or something… It wasn’t Steve, right??” Was Tony’s shocked and over exuberant, apprehensive response.
Barnes glanced at him sideways, wearily. He shook his head, “so what’s the plan now, will you gain control of the doom bots?”
His legs ripped out from underneath him. He quickly latched on to the fractured pavement with his wounded hands.
“Because hey! We are dealing with an old ass alien who is hell bent on, no, not world domination, but universal domination! Yet! Yet she doesn’t want to stop us from stopping her!” He shouted at an unusually high octave.
“Bullshit!” Tony shouted making Steve flinch yet again.
Ellie slid off of Steve in alarm. "Daddy? What's wrong?"
“Woah man! Put the brakes on!” Sam tried to keep Steve down.
Then death.
“Yay!” Ellie squealed as she ran upstairs.
“We now have a face. We need to know what the 69 seconds means. And we need to know if this woman was present around the time the others fell.” He continued.
Then it all came back to him at once, like a piano falling from a third story window. That vibrant image of his blood pouring down shiny steel plates of a metal arm made his throat close painfully. A metal arm that belonged to…
Five minutes.
“Very good Babydoll. It is. And also because of this shape here.” he explained pointing to another element on the page.
“You all have your orders, meeting aj—“
“Che, I didn’t even have a chance to enjoy it yet…”
Steve looked down and saw the children staring up at him in awe.
Kevin added, “She don’t talk.”
Oh, life. It is still the most marvelous of all my encounters.
“We need a team.” Said Fury.
“Yeah, I know.” He did know, he felt the same way. “I’m just a bit torn, I’d like to involve as few people as possible in this. To impose this impossible burden on them would be so unfair and cruel. Yet, I know I can’t simply take away their right to choose if they want to be a part of this.” Steve uttered through his warring thoughts.
“Honestly?”
The man paused for a moment, then sighed, "Most likely, but I'll let you have it anyway, it's Tony." The man, Tony, replied.
‘I knew that man.’  He thought.
The man paused, looks down at the device in his hand, then looked back up in incredulous astonishment.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
He made his way slowly to the coffee pot and poured a generous amount into his mug, being careful not to spill any. His body was so sore it was difficult to stay steady. So many sleepless nights and very little food did him no favors. Natasha folding him into another unique pretzel two hours ago did absolutely nothing to aid him either. Clint’s obnoxious laughter still rattled around in his head. Nat had cornered him earlier and was very displeased that Tony had harassed Barnes last night. The only reason she wasn’t snapping bones was because she actually agreed with Tony’s plan. It’s a dangerous day when Natasha Romanov agrees with one Tony Stark. Tony had to question how dangerous and deadly his plan was if Nat agreed seemingly so easily.
“Here on the helicarier.” Everyone turned cold.
“You fucking bastard!” Tony exclaimed shrilly.
The man was hard to swallow unless you knew how he operates… God he was so glad he did not say that out loud. Anyway, though Tony was a difficult person, he was full of heart artificial or not.
And with that they both began to laugh. Steve’s laugh morphed into a grown as his newly stitched wounds became agitated.
Tony's head snapped to her as feelings of shock and dread washed over him. There she was standing there next to Steve's IV drip, ever still and ever serene.
"Yeah, you don't see too many people with facial hair like that." He mused in agreement. "Know anybody like that?" He asked.
“No.” Was all he said.
“You’re the only one who can figure out how to save these people Tony! How to save Bruce and Sue and …”
No!  Lots of pain!  It caused so much pain!
“Steve darling, are you all right?” Peggy asked concerned.
“Stupid! Not yet.”
Tony looked between them, fear growing in his heart for Steve.
The man was strikingly handsome, his large dark eyes full of profound intelligence and a hint of arrogance but also bearing something deeper. His straight round nose balanced well with his high cheekbones. That odd stylized beard framed his smiling lips in such a way that it complemented his face shape well.
"Wow, that's a ways away."
Tony looked up at him. "Well, to give you some context, you said it had been ten hours since you last saw me?" Steve nodded. "It had been almost two days for me. According to my math every twenty-four hours for you is about 113.4 hours for me which is about 4.96 days." Tony stated matter of factly.
"Waiting for someone?" The genius spoke up smirking, his wide brown eyes crinkled in a knowing smile.
"Oh please! You are too full of yourself, Stark!" The Rhododendron shouted from his hiding place. "My encryption is flawless, it is completely unbreakable!" He cackled.
Bucky sided up to him after a moment.
“God, why do you have to be such a buzz kill, Nat.” Tony drawled. “It’ll be fine, nothing has happened yet.”
Horrifically, his suit had been commandeered before. Rhodey was piloting the suit at the time, but it still happened and was still entirely conceivable that it could happen again if a hacker was talented enough. Tony could create as many safeguards and firewalls he desired but if some alien came along with technology like Calamity’s they could easily take control of his armor. With Tony inside no less.
Steve shook his head.
“Two days.” Sam said as he gently lifted a cup to Steve’s lips. “You are a crazy lucky man.” He said as Steve took a small tentative sip of the cool water.
“…What?” He asked confused by their behavior.
"Darling, if you continue to kiss me like that, I may never leave." She teased.
“You are not meant to understand, love. Time... Is fluid, you will not be beyond my reach.”
“Look Daddy! There it is!” She tugged his hand excitedly as she tried to drag him faster to the little colorful unit.
“HE’S INNOCENT!!” He screamed again in desperation the electric noose was once again wound around Bucky’s neck and they managed to keep him pinned on his knees. The Soldier stopped struggling.
Peggy shrugged. “Hardly anything, I’m afraid. Howard has been very tightlipped about the whole thing.” She answered pensively.
“Well, as it so happens Tony and the other avengers are after me.”
I apologize for any and all errors.
The longer he looked upon his face the more sure he was that this was their last night together. He did not know then that it was going to be his last, but he knew this time. It was all going to end one way or another tomorrow.
“Your eyes are a pale blue right now, like the skies during the rainy day.” Tony said lucidly.
End Chapter Nineteen
Tony knew he was going to have nightmares for months perhaps even years about the scream that ripped from the Rhododendron's throat. The genius's body flinched involuntarily, and Steve rested a hand on his shoulder to steady him. Tony couldn't look away from the terrifying scene in front of him.
Uh oh… Tony was 30 feet away from reaching Bucky before he realized sub unit number one was getting ready to launch another pressure bomb. He wasn’t going to make it. Dammit!
When the last of Anuk's black twinkling light faded from the sky, it irrevocably and resoundingly marked the end of the Calamity case.
“That wasn’t funny!  If you do that again I’m going to murder you in your sleep!”  Steve shouted back with a hint of laughter and his own voice.
"I'm fine, Babydoll, I just felt faint for a moment. It must be from the worry over your mom and the baby." He said knowing full well that such intense feelings like that were not supposed to happen with his super soldier enhanced body.
Steve felt around his person for a moment, he grabbed two devices.
“Okay, here’s the plan. We are going to keep moving forward. When we get close enough Kevin will use the sonic pulse. Okay? I know you’re scared, but I need you guys to be brave. Okay?”
Talking about Coney Island and the photos led Steve to remember why he had wanted, no, needed to paint that scene. Bucky was always on the edge of his thoughts. For the longest time it was just the two of them vs. the world, always together, till the end of the line. But Bucky’s end had been met in the dead of winter falling to his death into an icy river.
“ETA on the elevator?”
Chapter Fourteen: Something I’m Forgetting…
“Alas my hopes were for not.” He spoke at almost a whisper.
She threw on a look of utter intense concentration as she posed herself like a jockey. Steve laughed and began to announce for her.
"A deal is a deal." She ran a single finger starting in the middle of his forehead down his face.
Also, I made a huge change to the summery, let me know if it works better, or if the old one was better.
There were some concerns at first that with such advanced healing, the soldier’s body would completely reject the foreign hardware altogether. Dr. Cho and Dr. Davidson kept a close eye on him and Tony admittedly had waited with baited breath the last few days, hoping the soldier’s body did not, in fact, reject the titanium and carbon components. Dr. Cho had been developing some impressive technology that had helped profoundly. It was a way to merge organic matter with synthetic fibers to heal. It was invaluable technology that helped immeasurably.
“But he’s my responsibility, it should be me that brings him in.” He tried to sound as depressed and broken as he could in order to sway Tony into not lashing out. He found it wasn’t all that hard to do. And as a plus totally worked. Instead of becoming indignant and snarky, Tony’s eyes softened.
“Well, where are they?”
“Possibly three minutes.”
The Avengers rose and stood steadfast to their true nature. Something truly heroic stirring in all of them at the Captains admission. They were all in fact superheroes after all.
It was of course Tony's job to figure out how to disable it safely, without, you know, sucking the whole planet into its pseudo-void.
The other Avengers with the help of the X-Men had made equally little progress. They had combed through the documents. They went back and forth between interpreting vague passages and trying to fit the one new piece of information they found somewhere in the mess of data they already have.
Barnes gawked at him in disbelief.
“Who the hell is Bucky?” His question came out soft but his expression was thunderous.
“Once every one arrives we should be getting started.” Bruce concluded as looked about the room once more.
But before Clint could even retort Bruce cut in,
Angie frowned then looked up at Steve reprimandingly, "You bought her a new one?" She asked incredulous.
“Draw stuff from your past or something.  It’ll keep you occupied while I do some work.”  Tony said while quickly flashing his billion dollar smile before turning to the work table to converse with Jarvis about his various programs.
*~0~*
Oh boy did that idea backfire. He detested doing the dishes and logically she probably knows that. He smiled wistfully to himself however, at least she’s not standing there doing them.
“Last night’s nightmare was…” He trailed off.
And so it was the Captain stood alone on the roof once more. He had the biggest bone to pick with Tony but he was going to wait till he could get his head wrapped around this new piece of information. He was the keystone. The one thing Calamity needed to take over the world.
“Sir?”
“I agree.” Said Natasha. “I got the impression that she pretty much has the capacity to do nearly anything. If she wanted to destroy any information we already have, all she would have to do a snap her fingers.”
“I told you, it’s beyond complicated.” He sighed. “I have days at the most.”
Bucky chuckled painfully but nodded in ascent, agreeing with those terms. They hobbled to the door.
“Just keep going, Jar!”
Steve perked up, listening intently. He could have sworn he just heard something.
“All right people this meeting room will now come to order.” Shouted Fury over the various voices mingling together in the Super Duper Meeting room.
He was rewarded, however, by a brilliantly stunning smile.
Tony rapidly glanced between the "human" woman and a little crystal figure in his hand.
“What kind of mischief are you two getting into now?” Peggy expressed in playful exasperation from the doorway.
"A celestial God, eh. I'm in. Can't give Asgard a bad name, can I?"
He shook his head again, the panic starting to set in a little.
“This thing that we now presume to be an alien, a creature that out of anything and everything in this entire world, we know the least about. An Alien that, of course, we know nothing about could very well be completely impervious to anything and everything we dish out to it. It is undetected by our best technology. How would we fight it?” The Captain paused for a moment to allow the weight of his words to pierce through everybody’s minds.
He knew, however, that somehow, someway, he was going to get his memories back. He was obstinately hell-bent on it.
Steve really did not know how to respond to that. He was just coming to terms with his weird condition himself. He thought long and hard on how to give her a proper answer.
The genius knew how complicated the algorithm would be to alter the energy exchange but hopefully with the professors description and If he could personally study one of the patients then maybe he could develop it enough to get close.
Tony grabbed the arm and inserted the primary neuro-clasp rod deep into the bone anchor, deftly locking it into place before anyone could blinked.
Tony knocked on Bucky’s helmet. “Ready?”
Before Steve could even comprehend the sentiment behind the gesture an all-consuming thunderous percussion of a gunshot ring out and Bucky’s chest blew out in a rain of crimson blood. The scream of anguish that ripped through the Captain’s throat tore his vocal cords apart after a drop of blood landed on his cheek. It froze everyone on the spot and subsequently made them back away in terror.
He swallowed thickly.
“If it’s any consolation, I have Jarvis keeping me informed of any and all sightings of Barnes. If he shows up anywhere we will know about it.” He sighed frustrated.
“Is it possible stop you?”
Hundreds of doom bots were plaguing them. Not just here but all over the world. There were fuzz buzz still littered about and now that Thor was here, they were swarming in, feeding off of his energy. Hell bird eggs were hatching, and the mother was clawing her way out slowly but surely.
“What do your eyes see?”
Wanda used her abilities to reinforce the bow cable and Spiderman’s webs, she also began to help pull them in.
Bucky sprang up, quickly evading another round of bullets. He needed to be quicker. The moment one of them realized Stark was truly the worst threat it was over. He needed them to stay absolutely focused on him. He dodged low to the left and took careful aim and shot agent number 4 three times, one in each shoulder and one in the left leg. The man went down fast screaming. He should have lost the use of his arms so he was down and out as he was writhing on the floor in pain.
"How do you mean?" He asked anyway.
Tony had Jarvis analyze the gravitational disturbance, and yes, it was growing.
“I know! But there is no avoiding it.”
“You can give me my grand back Barton.”
“Is it because of the way the light shines from here?” She pointed at the paper.
Now this caught Steve’s attention.
Bucky squinted at him. “Is that supposed to be a joke? You do know who you are talking to, right?”
"Oh, that's great." Steve replied.
Steve gave him a broken smile, “Aren’t we all.”  The Captain sighed.  “It’s just that’s how I feel, useless.  I was useless my whole life before the serum, even after…”  His mind flashed back as he watched uselessly as his brother fell to his death.
‘Hmm fireworks…’ He idly wondered how Steve would feel about this. ‘Definitely pissed off.’ He mused just as he was about to click the last mechanism into place.
Tony eyed him particularly.
Steve's mind screeched to a complete halt and his heart gave an alarming jerk and began to beat thunderously. Then he looked at her. Really looked at her.
“The car Steve. She is my baby and I won’t be having you dinging her up.” She said warningly.
“Wow, how much do you want to bet he’s wasted?” Tony asked close to Steve’s ear.
She held out her hand again and this time he took it. The moment their fingers touched the scene changed and they were standing together in what appeared to be a grassy field with a number of trees scattered about.
“Going after him is a dead end.  I know, I’ve tried.  Like you said he’s a ghost story.”
It had been a long and difficult night for Steve.  He tried to shake his thoughts but to no avail.  He had desperately tried to continue to deny his feelings for Tony.  He tried to simply categorize it as merely admiration and respect for a friend that he cares so deeply about.  He tried to convince himself that his pull to Tony was merely platonic.  Like the way he had always thought of Bucky as his best friend and brother.  But then again he never ever had the urge to kiss Bucky the way he wanted to kiss Tony.
A/N: Happy birthday Steve Rogers!
"Well, here goes nothing." He said to himself as he tore off the first piece of his own Iron Man armor over the chest plate.
“You have a gift many do not receive, to know when you have reached the end. You have the chance to say that things you could not before.”
The lines between reality and fantasy were blurring and he did not know where one ended and the other began. A large part of him did not want to know for the simple fact that if anything in last night's dream were ever remotely the reality, then he would have to face the disturbing fact that he was probably having an affair with that man. It tore deeply at him because he firmly believed that those who committed adultery and defiled the sanctity of the marriage bed were less than putrid scum.
“It is true, my dears.  I am so sorry…” She smiled sadly.  “I have taken your kin.”  She confirmed mournfully as she began to fade.
He took her into his arms and sucked in a deep breath.
“You know me, I go where you go!” Said Sam.
“Tomorrow… I think I can take that.” Steve could not keep the exhaustion out of his voice.
“Reed Richards, Sir.”  Jarvis answered simply.
“Mr. Stark!  How in the fuck do you know that information?  That is classified beyond your clearance.  Wait, no never mind I don’t wanna know.  But let me tell you, this isn’t over.  I will find out about it.  But now was not the time.”  Fury stated reprimandingly.
As happy as he was to be there he got the oddest sensation that he didn't belong and even more disturbing that he desperately needed to be elsewhere.
“Yeah, that one option that was simply better than giving up, right?” Bucky looked at him.
Then only a few weeks later they had been thrown into their first mission together, to stop Loki. He tried to be kind but that bastard made it so damn hard. He did not know how but Tony had the gift to just look at him and say the worst thing he could possibly say at any given time and piss him off like no one could ever hope to. Just when he was sure that Tony was going to wake up dead by his own hands they got stuck in a subway tunnel together. Isolated together for hours.
Steve was momentarily bemused with the thought of the Thumbelina fairytale. Calamity looked like a small humanoid-like little crystal being with little wings, like a little fairy.
Steve nodded then a sly thought came to him and he rolled his eyes to himself. He could not pass up the opportunity.
Steve nodded for him to continue.
Barnes hummed deep in thought. He turned a cracker over in his hand and focused on it like it was the most interesting thing in the world.
“Oh God What Now!!” Clint shouted. ‘This is so not cool’.
“I hear ya.”  Agreed the Captain.
Chapter Six: Fell For You
Now Steve was worried, he watched on in horror as it turned its soulless white gaze onto Tony.
Steve quickly pushed Tony to the door. Tony grabbed Clint by the collar and dragged him away with him. Thor grabbed Xavier, chair and all and followed Tony. Steve hauled an unconscious Fury over his shoulder and followed Thor, glancing back to see Natasha hot on his heels.
Tony watched him expectantly.
Not just any roar, a painfully familiar roar that Tony swore he would never in his entire life feel so God damned happy to hear. The Hulk roared again, apparently much closer now. Tony collapsed in relief when he the doom bot left to investigate the new development.
But Bucky Barnes had apparently returned from the dead and that’s all Steve could think about. After being the center of attention for so long it’s hard to swallow being placed on the back burner. He deserves it, he supposed.
After a moment nothing happened. The drive didn’t blow up the world didn’t end.
“Rogers, you will go and assist Thor.”
“Indeed, Sir. The alarm went through but I managed to relocate the source to sub level 9, Sir. However, I won’t be able to continue much longer. They have a talented hacker that has realized my presence. It won’t be long before I am completely booted from the system.”
After the accident yesterday it came to the attention of the Avengers via Shield that it was in fact the assassination of Senator Wolfram.
Steve slammed the bathroom door shut behind him after excusing himself swiftly. He splashed water on his face trying to get his emotions under control. He does not even know why that information was so tragic to him. He’s been in war. He’s watched people he’s cared about lose a lot more, lose everything. Yet, somewhere deep in his soul the fact that Howard cannot have kids is the most devastating thing he’s ever heard.
“Good.” The genius swooped down and stole another kiss before heading to the door. He turned slightly, “Good night Steve.” He said lovingly.
“Well, it’s like this…” He began to describe, in as much detail as possible, the Calamity case.
Now all eyes were on him.
This was his life!
And Tony put his life and company on the line to help this guy, to aid him, to
"Cell phone."
As you can imagine I was relieved to find life on other planets. I was afraid I had destroyed the only other sentient creatures besides myself and that I was meant to be eternally alone.
Steve was quick to reply, “Whose nerves?  Yours or mine?  ‘Cause you know very well this won’t do a thing for me.”
He was dressed so oddly. He had on a dark gray T-shirt and black slacks in which the Captain could not identify the material, and were those sneakers? The shoes were like nothing he had ever seen before.
“Forward!” Steve bellowed trying to urge them on. He stayed behind them to shield them from the tsunami of zappers.
All Steve could do was stare in awe as he turned around and around trying to take it all in.
“Okay fine. I’ll meet you at the bay doors in a half an hour.”  He stated as he was walking out the door.
Fury’s expression changed from indignant irritation to god forsaken horror for a fraction of a second before he took on a stoic face.  Nobody but Steve caught it. The Soldier concluded that Xavier must have told Fury something in his mind, some sort of threat likely.
“Captain Rogers! Stop pestering our guest with—“ Fury was cut off by Tony.
Their chances of survival were so low to begin with, why bother? But then he pictured all of the disappointed faces of his team and he just couldn’t do it. He imagined what Steve’s sad puppy dog disappointed face would be like if he had given up on the world. It wasn’t pretty. Tony thought back to Steve’s encouraging words in the letter and knew he couldn’t let that insufferable bastard down.
“What the hell!”
He took a shuttering breath, “Yeah, I’m fine. I really don’t know what came over me.” He tried to sound reassuring. “I just had a moment I guess.”
“Just shut up and stick the damn thing on me already.” Bucky barked.
“I could have saved you.”
Tony only nodded. He said everything he needed to say.
As an experiment Tony decided to throw a pressure bomb at her. Warning his team of his intentions he called out, "Stand clear! Throwing a pressure bomb at her in three, two, one-"
Steve’s face contorted in revulsion.
Steve thought for a moment. A small spark in his soul, utterly resilient that refused to be extinguished, begged for a modicum of reprieve.
He pressed his hands against the phantom pain in his torso, trying desperately to ground himself. This was foolish. There was absolutely no reason he should be feeling like this. It’s fine, everything is fine.
He was this close to stabbing and going ape shit on everybody. Oh was he ever going to give that stupid stupid suicidal idiot a piece of his mind. He was so mad right now. At every one!
“Daddy?”
“I don’t feel it.” He said as he poked at it.
Sam was finding it harder and harder to keep the Captain down.
“S-so, uh… how is this… g-going to go? A-are you… g-going to p-put… me… in a c-coma or… or…” He couldn’t finish his thought.
“Good morning Agent Romanov.  What brings you my way?”  Steve greeted.
“What? Why? We can’t really do this without you.” Like seriously most of their plan hinged on her help.
He put his drink aside in favor of wrapping his arms around his head.
“That was my thought; I mean getting out of the helicarrier for a few hours will probably do is some good.”
“Ah fine, what’s the plan?”
“It’s okay Tony. That was then, I’m here now.” Steve said almost breathlessly.
This time he was a bit more successful but it wasn’t perfect. They scattered quickly and began to return fire. Tony spotted Clint take aim at the Rhododendron from an obscure rooftop. Tony watched in dismal horror as the arrow landed harmlessly five feet away.
He was so god damned out of it he barely registered someone up in the rafters.  He was talking.  Steve assumed he was addressing the group.  He had to get closer.  He kept to the shadows holding his breath determined not to make a sound.  He managed to make his way up the rafters.  The closer he got the more he could hear this strange man speak.
“And that was…  Useful.”  Supplied Fury as no one spoke up.
With as much effort as he could muster, he got to his feet.
Instead, he subtly twisted his wrist and flicked his fingers unassumingly altering the settings on his watch armor. By the time Rumlow registered Tony’s movements it was too late. A shockwave him and the other agents away from the door.
“It’s simply too dangerous for you to know this sensitive information.  It must unsettle you profoundly, the unknown.”
Peggy gave one last amused glance at the book before handing it back to Steve and announcing that she was going to take a bath and get ready for the day. Steve continued to stare at the mysterious man for a time before a head of golden curls flooded his vision as he was glomped by Ellie.
This nearly threw Steve into a fit of rage.
When Steve's face broke out into a wide grin Tony was happy to lose that battle.
But before he could truly breathe a sigh of relief, the worst happened. As if in slow motion Tony watched as Steve stood quickly, and looked up to Iron Man's incoming position in the sky and stared at Tony with such horror the genius knew he'd never forget it.
“Come on, get ready for bed.”
“Who’s here?”  Steve questioned.
After removing his T-shirt, Tony felt slightly self-conscious as he noticed the Maximoff girl attempt to discreetly examine the webbing of scar tissue surrounding his arc reactor that was visible above his undershirt. He haphazardly tossed his Black Sabbath shirt aside for Dumm-E to pick up later and took his position behind the soldier with the small painkilling device in hand.
“And a punctured lung with four broken ribs accompanying it. They have been set and are also in the mend. Only five others are bruised. That was quite the attack Captain.” She stated with a sorry smile.
“So how are we going to pull this off?” Wanda asked getting everyone back on track.
Steve could barely process anything that was happening. He was shaking uncontrollably, the truth was just behind a piece of steel and leather. The soldiers scream had nearly unhinged him. Steve has heard that scream in his nightmares for years.
“Hey.” Steve greeted in return.
“It was Calamity!  She was here!”  Steve uttered panicked and breathlessly.
He tapped his forehead against the glass again and took a deep breath.
Although Tony was willing to bet his own plans definitely were a tad more suicidal.
“After Dr. Banner contacted me I had taken it upon myself to seek out the potential suspect using Cerebro. Had the suspect been a mutant I would have seen it.” The professor concluded.
Tony forced more power into his thrusters. Steve turned around to face Tony and reached out his free hand for Tony to take. Iron Man threw his hand out and latched onto Steve’s hand with a death grip. He quickly shifted his angle and began to pull them away from the hole. He did his best to try and pull them both to safety, but the force of the pseudo-void kept getting stronger and the drain on Tony’s arc reactor was becoming unbearable.
“Now, you’re gonna listen good.  I need you to read this book to me and tell me what I need to know.”  Commanded the rotund one.
The pressure was off his neck but metal hands now grabbed his broken torso he almost thought the bot was going in to finish the job. He struggled as he moaned miserably before he heard a familiar voice that made him calm instantly and smiled broadly despite himself.
It was so ingrained he didn’t even have to watch it to know exactly what would happen moment by moment…
For a fraction of a moment the image of a half painted portrait of Coney Island came to him. It left as quickly as it came but he was sure he had seen his own hands work the paint. He shook his head. He could have very well have painted something like that recently and just not remember it.
Just then nearly one hundred more chrysalises shot out from the blackhole.
“Yeah, we have that in common.” He replied.
“My plan is perfect.”  He scoffed at Tony.  “Looks like it’s time for another dose, hmm?”
“Really? You’re going to call language on me right now?” Bucky replied incredulously. “Well how about fuck you! Fuck, fuck fuckitie fuck you fucking punk!” He cursed, challenging Steve. His cocky smirk widened significantly.
Surely, his life could not get any worse.
Without warning, Tony broke the kiss and leaned back. They both stood breathing hard for a moment before Tony spoke up, panting.
Tony’s blood ran cold when he recalled the numerous times he had nearly killed the soldier. The genius had loathed, detested and hated him, wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. Would have been utterly glad to be the one to dispose of Hydra’s lapdog. What were the odds that after everything, every single fucking thing, that he would befriend the soldier and earn his trust enough for Barnes to pass on information he thought had become completely irrelevant. Apparently, 0.5%.
Disclaimer: I absolutely do not own anything! Who’d come after me anyway, really? All you’d get is my crappy ass pottery and my last roll of toilet paper. Not Worth it.
Steve bolted out of bed with a cry as if he had been burned and electrocuted, then darted to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him.
“Excellent!” Calamity exclaimed in delight.
“I’ll show you how murdery this persona is if you don’t shut the fuck up.” He threatened through gritted teeth.
It was not.
"No, not like this. I'll have to make a new one." Tony replied not quite believing that this just happened.
Her very large, round protruding middle…
“Oh, thank God. I thought you had reverted back to your more cold and murdery persona.”
'No!' His entire being screamed in a desperate plea. 'It can't be too late!'
She began to make her way steadily to the Rhododendron who was now spewing incoherent filth.
Bucky’s eyes widened comically. Tony wasn’t just handing him an olive branch he was trying to throw him the entire fucking tree, roots and all.
“Uh oh.” ‘Oh no… No no no…’ Steve thought pleadingly.
"You're welcome to try." Tony replied offhandedly.
All questions, comments and theories welcome.
That was her primary job in this case, to find the woman.  But Tony took that from her. She knows deep down that she is overreacting and that she should expect Tony capable of such things. But she just can’t get over it. She had searched all of these media avenues before and came up with zilch.  But Tony came in and researched them and found the woman despite her efforts.  She wasn’t necessarily angry with Tony she was more angry with herself and the situation.  She cannot understand how she had managed to miss what was clearly right in front of her.
“I don’t think so.” Said Bruce. “If she wanted to slow us down there would have been easier ways for her to do it.”
“Natasha! The Doom Bot is Adapting!! Disengage!” Steve shouted.
Steve said nothing.
Bucky shook his head vigorously. “No! Get someone else, anyone else. I can’t.” He replied severely.
She went back to her little worktable and swept her colored pencils aside and began showing him a few different versions of Rocky she made. Her skill was incredible. She was going to be a very talented artist if she continued to indulge in this hobby.
He looked up to Peggy questioningly. She was leaning in the doorway smiling contentedly, rubbing her belly. She gave him a gentle nod of ascent.
“I do not know why you always insist on playing this game with me.” Von Doom continued exasperated. “I already know where you are.”
"All right." He smiled.
Their first meeting was a disaster at best. He hadn’t realized it then but Tony had ignited something in him that day. After coming out of the ice he was numb. He could barely feel anything but the cold, hopeless darkness of his dismal life. Then that enigmatic man walked into his life with the cocky strut and made him feel alive again. Yeah, it was because Tony enraged him beyond comprehension.
He glanced around the room searching for a way out. Instead he found an answer as he spotted Thor in the corner of the room giving Jane a kiss on her cheek. In the end all it was is to kiss Tony or fork over fifty bucks. Duh.
End Chapter 42
He was about to continue until he looked up and saw the look on Steve’s face. The Captain looked like he was about to throw up. Steve always took these kinds of things really seriously; as if each unfortunate victim or casualty was his own personal failure.
"Then you absolutely cannot have our souls!"
“Well if we do keep them alive in the comas, at least they’d remain very happy about it.”  Though spoken two help lighten the mood, it only served to put a look of uttered dismay on the Captain’s face.
“Actually, scratch that. Fury should be the one to worry; he’s got the deadly secrets.” Tony said in all his snarky glory.
“Thor, you said that it followed the survivors across the galaxy’s the last time it had appeared?” Steve inquired.
“Why do you seem so proud of that?” Barnes squinted at him.
"Nah ah, grace, Ellie!" He chided as a large forkful of potatoes was just about to pass her lips.
"Likely." He replied. "Well what are you doing still standing here, soldier? The world needs you."
"Tch." Tony derided.
“Very good, Sir.” Jarvis replied. “Captain Rogers wishes to speak to you immediately. He has assured me that he will, as he puts it, ‘behave.’”
“Works for me.”
Iron Man sighed and turned the final device over in his hand for one last inspection before quickly making his way to the infirmary.
“Yep, still a complicated, impossible mess.” He sighed.
"Thought so…" She sighed, then turned her attention back to Ellie. "No worries, auntie Angie to the rescue. Gotta go assist Princess Avalon in vanquishing the dust bunnies, then escape here back to the hospital!" Angie declared epically.
Steve turned and realized he was talking about the painting of the red and gold armor.
When he reached the bottom of the stairs he found yet another robot shaped hole in the four.  After following it he found himself in an isolated room that was obviously meant to be secretly secured.  He quickly found the bot as it was trying to remove some type of power core, no doubt the product of whatever they were secretly researching in this facility.  Before he could approach the intelligent machinery, Natasha’s voice rang out of his earpiece informing him that they have the outside secured and that the bots were taken care of.  He smiled to himself, good just this last one.  He called out to it.
“It was Tony’s idea, I get why he did it, I do. But you should hear it all from him. I’ve said far too much already.” He sighed. “I figured if this ship is going down you should know why.” Johnny clasped Steve’s right shoulder and gave him a gentle squeeze.
"Ah, to thwart my nefarious plans. I suppose that is as good as a motivation is any. Your current chance for success does stand at a solid 98.8 percent." She replied almost exasperated.
Maybe he would take Wanda up on her offer to sooth his mind. But the thought of her manipulating his mind in any way made him want to vomit. He suddenly remembered all the reasons why he could never let the likes of Xavier or Wanda near his head before. His mind was utterly off-limits.
Perfect. The blast shattered the windows just enough for him to barrel through them. He had to move fast. The whole building would be on alert now.
Tony was by Bucky’s side instantly. He grabbed him before he could hit the floor and helped him up to his feet. He positioned the soldier against the wall of the elevator to study him.
Ellie walked slowly and dejectedly to the stairs.
“Remember when we were on the mission against those stupid zappers?”
He looked up at her to see a box in her hands. She resisted the urge to throw it at his head, instead tossed it next to him. She sighed.
“In since your mind is just as vulnerable you will have access to mine.” Tony touched an icon on the screen. “With this, you have access to everything. All of my personnel files, my projects, the company, my money. Everything.” He said.
"This place, whatever is happening, isn't real." He said finally.
Tony backed out of the way as Scott and Sam made their way to Barnes to patch him a tad better than a T-shirt and duck tape.
“Thing, you and I will hit the streets and see what we can see and take out what we can.”
He wished he could glance back at Bucky to see if he was planning anything but the moment he took his eyes off of Rumlow it would be over.
He shook his head as he began walking to the barn. After what Ellie told him earlier he was curious as to what kind of paintings and drawings he had created since the war. He had little to no time to really make anything when he was on the road taking out Hydra bases. Perhaps, he made a doodle or comic book here and there, just to keep the story going, but overall nothing to elaborate.
She startled slightly, turning to him. “I do.” She replied astonished. “How did you know?”
“My apologies, but we could not help but to overhear,” Xavier rolled up to them. “But if we are going to be adding members to this ragtag group of ‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’, then we know a few others that have the right to join us.”
When Peggy was finally moderately convinced, he went on to head to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Mercifully, Ellie had slept through that entire fiasco and had only emerged when the smell of bacon roused her. Thankfully breakfast had been cooked to perfection as Ellie was all too eager to point out.
“See, no problem.” Tony assured. Bucky stared at him. “Stop doing that!” Tony shouted as he made his way to the compartment Jarvis indicated. “Seriously, it freaks me out.” He said pulling out the suit.
“Nope, definitely not a piece of tech.” Tony said in absolution.
Just when you think it couldn't get any worse the universe takes euphoric joy in proving you wrong.
“Just in the last 72 hours.” Natasha added.
“Dick.” Tony barked before asking his original question again. “Why are you here again?”
“I’m sure.” He smiled sincerely.
"Sure? Can you do it?"
Realizing that Tony and Bruce were not on this mission; the Captain felt relieved.  Fury probably felt it prudent that they remain working in the lab.  Which for once was fine with Steve being as he didn’t really wanna be near the genius right now anyway, even though deep down that’s all he wanted.  Damn these conflicting emotions.
He was about to curse himself before he felt a brush of sensation on his right hand. He looked down to see little Becka grabbed his large hand with her tiny one. She looked up at him with eyes full of hope. He smiled tenderly at her and realized the other children were just behind her also immensely hopeful despite their fear.
“Oh yes!  Come here you two, Boss wants to talk.”
“It tickles you.” Tony declared triumphantly as he waved the wand over Barnes’s shoulder again and again eliciting an undignified squeal in response.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
The billionaire paused what he was doing and looked up at Steve.
He suddenly felt a sharp, wrenching, twisting, and unbearable pain in his gut. Steve was so destroyed over this new revelation that it took him a moment to realize that the new sensation of painful agony was not emotional but physical. He slowly looked down to see that Bucky had impaled his metal arm into Steve abdomen. They both watched with shocked expressions and morbid fascination as crimson blood began to run down the polished steel plates like gorgeous streams priceless liquid garnets.
Tony continued, “And the score happens to be 16-19, get it right! Now get your ass into that chair!” Tony pointed to the operating station.
After he kissed the child good night, Peggy turned out the light and led him to their bedroom. Their shared bedroom, where there was their shared bed… Well this was awkward.
“Then why claim Von Doom!? Surely he could have caused enough pain!” Steve countered.
“No one can save you!  The troops will be infiltrating the city shortly.  Aren’t they in for a surprise?”  He grinned slyly.
She pinned him with the glare.
“Only if you make that raspberry herbal one, I can never do it the way you do.” Jane replied.
“My friend! You are awake!” Thor exclaimed from the doorway.
Before Steve could protest any further Tony continued,
"Not always, Babydoll." He answered tightly. "Okay, now that the dishes are done go make sure your room is tidy. After that you can go play. Just don't leave the property. After I finish some things we'll walk into town together, okay?" He said.
Tears began to roll down Steve’s face freely. Bucky swallowed thickly and continued.
As she lightly traced the delicate and colorful paint job, Steve chuckled lightheartedly at her now calm and appreciative demeanor.
“You have no idea.” Wanda commented wryly. “I have it all right here.” She tapped her temple.
“Nope, bad move. Don’t mess with my music...” Tony said irritatedly as he looked up at the intruder of his sanctuary.
"What exactly does that mean?" He demanded.
Thor considered everything they had told him for a moment.  So much was going on, 75 humans have seemingly randomly been struck down with this ailment.  The last two on the helicarrier right under their noses.  Somehow that does seem familiar to the Asgardian.  The various members of the Avengers looked expectantly at Thor as he rubbed his chin in consideration.
“I-it’s w-warm.” He shuddered.
“Yeah but most of that is still open for interpretation.” Bruce retorted. “Most of the Asgardian scholars could not even agree.” He continued gesturing to the scrolls, notes and journals.
She leaned over and kissed him deeply. While he was distracted she grabbed the sketchbook off the table. She flipped to the most recent page while our poor Captain was still gathering his wits after that mind-blowing kiss.
Hawkeye was nearly out of arrows. Peter remained absolutely resolute in protecting the containment field. As far as he could tell, from the last transmissions he had gotten from the coms, the rest of his team were dismally scattered. Widow was still handling the evac and Rhodey had finally removed the dead suit. He and Sam were trying to aid the first responders in recovering the dead and wounded, pulling them off the streets and hopefully out of harm’s way.
“This thing is pretty much a super soldier pain reliever.” Tony replied. Bucky stared at him. “Stop doing that! Look, it will work like best fucking aspirin you’ve ever taken. Since you can’t actually take medicinal pain relievers because of your metabolism this device will block the pain receptors in your brain on a neurological level by manipulating the electricity in your neurons.”
Now the occupants of the room perked up at that.  They stared at Tony full of hope.  It was in the code after all.  However, Tony was shaking.
“Why don’t you have faith in us to help you!? You can trust us!”
He trusted Steve.
"Unfortunately for you, this Calamity does not meet the laws of that task. Regardless a planet wide evacuation would not help you in the least.”
The others watched on, shaken.
“Is that like where your grandmother lived there something?”
They watched in solemn silence as the X-jet flew swiftly beyond the shipping bay doors and out of sight.
“So, instead you can kill your friends! Then we can go find the Captain together!!” He laughed.
"Hell no!" Bucky exclaimed. "No way in hell! That is Steve's thing. I- No, Nope." Barnes backed away.
“Now, when I attach this to the bone anchor and cybernetics it’s going to hurt like a mother fucker but only at first from the initial contact, after that you should be fine.”
Important…  He was trying to figure out what he was doing that was important!  He did not have time to identify Fury’s significance.  But what was important?  He did not know.
He looked around.
He snapped his head up in attention, ready to deny.
It was somehow oddly soothing. Then a warm scarlet aura enveloped him and turned him to face the Rhododendron. The look of shock and fear on his pink face was almost worth it all.
"Why?" Natasha questioned.
This was truly “Calamity.”
“NO!” The Captain screamed uselessly.
It was all he could do to keep himself from completely breaking down in misery. He had nothing but time to think about everything that had transpired to this point. He berated himself for his foolishness. He had given into Calamity too easily. It was selfish, his decision. Now he was literally at the end of his life…
“How is it we were able to find you then? The data I used found you in the video footages we have.” Tony replied looking at the drive in his hands skeptically.
Johnny made eye contact with Steve trying to convey so much in one look.  There were tones of anger, regret, sorrow, pain, resignation and something akin to acceptance.  Steve could not figure out what all that meant.  He had no idea what was going on.  Xavier gave him a regretful nod before exiting with the last of his team leaving only Steve and Tony alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve nodded absently following obediently.  Tony led them to his temporary workshop.  Realizing where he was, Steve began to object.
Iron Man analyzed how large the mother must be and concluded that if it wanted entry into this world the portal would need to be much larger and he was damned if he was going to let that happen.
It was fine right?  He destroyed the core so that everyone could get free…
"First off, your bastard friend, Barnes, thinks you're a rotten punk but he's gonna make you proud anyway because he's 'With you to the end of the line and passed that.' He said you'd know what that means."
They quickly followed after Johnny.  They arrived to the kitchen to see Sue hunched over Reed’s still body, crying hysterically.
“OK, this is what we are going to do,” He started adamantly.
I’ve had time to think things over at this point. It’s funny, you are by far the most infuriating, egotistical, neurotic asshole I have ever met and yet I find myself so deeply and stupidly in love with you.
"I will." He stated convincingly, though he himself was wholly unconvinced.
When they entered Fury’s quarters Clint, Natasha and Maria were already there.  Steve barely noticed their presence on the account that Fury looked like he’d went a few rounds with Bruce on a bad day.  Before anybody could ask,
“Everything meaning arms and legs too.” He added as he stood and stretched his muscles and popped his joints. “Not a lick of pain.”
Everyone comes together and Steve gets lost in his memories.
Steve takes the ultimate test...
“Yeah,” he agreed. “That’ll be swell.”
"The Calvary is coming." He said aloud. "They made it; they're are awake." Not just Bruce, but the rest of his team might be coming to help.
“How long before that happens?”
"Stop being a cryptic bitch and give me a straight answer for once!" He snapped.
“May I?” He gestured to her feet.
“What?”  Tony asked for clarification.
Steve looked at everybody. He had all of their attention now and it seems that the mayhem had been diverted… at least for now. He smiled inside. ‘At least I was useful in some way’ he thought to himself.
“Yeah of course Professor, obviously you know I was hoping we could do that.”  Tony stated slightly lamely.
“Dr. Banner please summarize the victims’ conditions.” The Director ordered still slightly irritated by Tony’s snarkyness.
“My turn!” Ellie whined up at Peggy reaching her arms out.
Yep, he was going to hell.
Days passed in a blur and a restless eerie calm descended upon the Avengers. It had been three weeks since the Baltimore massacre and not a hair nor hide could be found of any new foe seeking to wreak havoc upon the world. It scared Tony more than he was ever willing to admit. Something big was coming and the uneasy peace made Tony’s nerves stretch tighter than a guitar string.
“Okay, people! The meeting room will now come to order. Please, everyone be seated.” Fury announced while half glaring at everyone with his one eye.
We watched weekly as Bucky stopped cold at his response, staring at him horrified. He just uttered the one thing he could to get through to him. If there was anything he could say to get through to Bucky “his Bucky” if there was a part of him that existed, that was it. Bucky had always said that to him to remind him that he was never alone. When he had nothing he had Bucky. In a nutshell that one unassuming line was their way of saying “I love you, no matter what.”
He kinda felt sorry for Fury. It wasn’t entirely the Directors fault, he felt. If only he had realized sooner that the Doom bot was adaptive. If he had disengaged sooner and came up with an alternative plan things would have been different.
The man in these drawings wouldn’t have done those things to him, would not have manipulated him that way. Yeah, he was egotistical and fickle but not like that. It’s not like they were together and he would want Tony to move on after he was gone, to find peace and solace and live a long and happy life. But did he have to seek that solace even before Steve was out of the picture?! Did he have to go back and forth like that.
Many looked at him slack jawed; his proposition quite extreme.
But before he could completely lose himself to Tony, someone in the doorway cleared their throat.  Tony jumped away so quickly Steve felt like someone had just slapped him.
“Good.”
"I'm sorry about your friend. It sounds like you truly cared for her." He said finally.
Everyone perked up at that statement and stared gapingly at the Professor. Is this it? Everyone was now on the edge of their seats.
Johnny regarded Steve for a moment before answering.  “Not a chance in hell.”
Tony rolled his eyes so hard it hurt.
Tony emitted a long-suffering sigh. It's true that in this there was one last thing to not have regrets over. If he could go back and redo that moment with Steve, he'd likely play it out the same. (Maybe with less tears preferably.) But that doesn't fix the fact that there are a thousand more things that he was going to forever regret.
“You can trust me.” He said softly caressing Steve’s face. “I will find him, I promise.”
"To be honest, I don't believe Steve forgot you or tried to 'erase' you on purpose."
“Thought so, thank you, Jar.”
Chapter Thirty: It’s Not Over Before It’s Too Late
“Nothing!  I did nothing to that demented woman!”
“You’re the one isolating yourself!”  Tony snapped.
"Hey Jar?" He asked as he dissected the fake doom bot code.
“Wow Tony! That’s amazing. This could help so many people.” Steve almost gushed.
It was nearly three feet long and about a foot and a half wide. It looked as if it were made of charcoal briquettes haphazardly glued together. Tony watched in horror as it began to hatch. That same wailing noise he heard before emanated from the cracks as a horrendously foul-smelling mucus began to ooze from its core.
On the other side…
She sighed heavily, "I suppose I should explain further. As forthcoming as I had been, there were perhaps a few things I may not have been entirely clear or honest about."
“Just… Thank you.” Steve said almost shyly. “Really, thank you.”
Extraordinary!
A/N: Sorry this took so long to get to you. I wanted to get this out before Endgame premiered but my work schedule got really janky there for a while. Then I was a little destroyed after Endgame. Only a few more chapters left. Leave me a review and let me know what you think. Also, I was considering a sequel and or a series of sequels to this story. You'll know more what I aim to do after this story is concluded. I will ask then if you want me to continue on for a sequel or if you just want me to put this story in the coffin and leave it be.
“Professor? If you could, please brief the others about what just happened. Leave nothing out.”
Barnes was breathing hard and seemed to be in a daze. He blinked slowly up at Natasha who was holding him up by the shoulders.
Before he could decide on what to do next, he heard a commotion over the com line. His ire peaked when he heard that pink rabbit’s squealing voice.
“*Snore*OK, enough of this wonderful touchy feely stuff.  Here.”
It was monumentally refreshing.  The wind in his hair and the increase of his heart rate was exhilarating.  He had been on a type of house arrest the last week while he healed.  It was horrible.  But now there was nothing between him and the open road.  Well maybe a bunch of cars and people and stuff but the point was he was outside and no one could say otherwise.
Chapter Twenty-Nine: Shine a Light Into The Wreckage
“Steve, no!”  Tony shouted.
The genius nodded solemnly.
Now that one of their greatest fighters had finally joined them, that fucking bunny had sent in the exact thing that could nullify Thor's overpowered abilities. The fuzz buzz were absolutely genius. Thor couldn't do anything but fight with only physical attacks. If he used his lightning again, he would only make the zappers spawn limitlessly.
“You’re an idiot. You chose me over your friends, you could have stayed. Why? You could be safe with your team.”
This was getting nowhere.
“I even sought the council of the historians of other galaxies.” He began to unravel the parchment.
She led him to the living room and let him ease her down into her armchair. He noted the lovely floral pattern and placed the matching ottoman in front of her after she was seated comfortably. He knelt in front of her.
“You can’t keep me in the dark like that! Tony, that was not your call to make! You should have told me straight up from the start and trusted me to make that decision on my own.”
“Definitely, and beat him by a landslide.” Tony replied with a smirk.
God, he could not wrap his mind around any of it. She had her hands draped over her stomach lovingly. The ring on her left hand caught his attention. It was his grandmother’s wedding band. It was one of the few possessions of his mother he had left. Now Peggy wears it.
“I know, I know this logically but…” He eyed the bed with apprehension.
Steve bonds more with Ellie.
“Sounds like a really smart guy, are you sure he’s all that annoying?” Steve replied without missing a beat.
Fury did not respond. Steve stared straight ahead refusing to acknowledge his presence any longer.
“Good night Tony.” Steve replied despairingly.
“Oh! I’m going to go get the groceries.” He announced as he made his way out the front door.
"Is that all you forgot to tell us?" Black Widow sounded off.
Both slept completely through the night and most of the morning for once. Their slumber may not have been entirely restful, considering, but sleep they did.
What was so important about a heart. Was it someone else's heart or his own?
There was once a time in which he could not see the color red correctly. It always looked like a greenish gray color. Now, however, the hue was one of his favorites and he could not help but to truly admire how red appears so frequently in nature. Steve ran his fingers along the velvety soft petals reverently.
The black haze still lingered in his mind and pressed hard against his consciousness. Somehow, he knew this was all wrong. His head hurt and his wrist burned.
‘Well... Good for him!’ He thought.
“Thank you, Babydoll. What should I draw?” He asked.
“You are a pathetic nuisance.” Dr. Doom called out.
They had fought over a blanket of all things. It was the softest one. Bucky had tricked him and claimed his prize leaving Steve with the scratchy one. Steve smiled at the memory. In the end Bucky had shared with them. It was the dead of winter and one of the few times they had slept so close together as adults.
He was doing something.  What was it?
"No, Tony!" Steve shouted.
Tony nodded in understanding.
Steve knew that one of the only ways to calm the situation was to knock out agent Barton.  He was about to make a move to do so before he saw Natasha inching closer to do the very same.  So he backed off allowing her to handle it.
"Daddy? What's going on?" She asked groggily, alarm started to bloom across her face.
Tony stared at him frozen in confusion.
“Yeah, of course, Tony. Of course.”
“Steve!!”  They all shouted excitedly.  Steve opened his arms wide for the kids.  They were wrapped in his big safe arms in moments, snuggling happily into his warm body.  Behind the kids three sets of parents walked in.  They all were staring at Steve like he was pure gold.  Like he was the most wonderful thing in the world.
Everyone looked at him. Surly that alone wouldn’t cause for such alarm. Sure enough;
He felt the machines vibrate beneath his fingertips as the thrusters activated.  He held on tight as the aid bot launched through the tunnel to the outside.
“Apparently victims 74 and 75 have been discovered…”
As far as Tony knew the twins had been getting along fine with the remainder of the Avengers. Tony had locked himself away shortly after coming to and had little to no interactions with them, but from what Jarvis told him they were fitting in well enough.
As a soldier of peace, that was his life mission. However, this mission, he learned, was unachievable. There will always be conflict as long as people are truly free to think for themselves.
'Landscapes!?' He thought with disdain.
“Jarvis, you’ll lock the door behind us, won’t you?” Tony requested as if he were merely heading out to the grocery store.
Steve nodded.
It’s just… It’s just, perhaps, he lacked clarity. Perhaps, if he were in a different state of mind and regarding his current situation from an alternate point of view, then he would be analyzing the data differently too. Maybe in a way that led them to the answer they needed. Maybe he would go talk to Clint after all.
"Oh well." He supposed that he was going to have to go check on Ellie before he went to bed himself. Peggy should be back soon.
"You're not supposed to touch me." He said hastily.
Steve could have swore that his heart stopped.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky smirked in victory.
“I believe ninety-something.” Barnes replied in thoughtfulness, completely ignoring Tony’s revulsion. “Anyway,” he narrowed his eyes at Tony, “What you are you doing standing there freaking out like a baby. You’re supposed to be a superhero and now you’re making a scene.” He nodded to the doctors and Wanda who all were watching him with unconcealed mirth. “It’s time to be serious and get to work.” He declared with an air of authority. Then he turned to Tony and mouthed ‘Nineteen.’
“Tony I can’t just sit this out!”  Steve was shaking with fury.  Not when it’s all happening just outside.
“It happens today doesn’t it?” Wanda asked softly, approaching Steve slowly.
"What is and what should never be?"
“Damn.” Tony said as he picked himself off of the floor. “I was aiming for your groin. Wouldn’t be smirking then would you, asshole?”
Tony taught him enough about machines and robotics that he was sure that he would be able to take this one down.  Steve began to attack what would be the robots natural weak points but found that they were protected.  The robot itself moved somewhat sluggishly at least in comparison to the quick footed Captain.  But damn when the Doom Bot landed a hit he sure felt it.  This thing was a power driver.
"You most certainly will not be needing this any longer." She stated simply.
“But she would free the others. Please Tony, with this we can save Bruce and the others. Please all I am asking for is your best. I know you can, you’re the only one that can, please.”
However a dark cloud still lingered over the group. Three members were injured, Von Doom created a new super robot and to top it all off not two hours ago there was confirmation of an 86
“Please? The high and mighty Tony Stark saying please? I didn’t think it was in your vocabulary. Learn something new every day, huh?” The archer teased.
“The code is pretty gnarly so it’ll probably take a week maybe two at the most.”
The inventor found during the time they spent together that Steve is in every sense a ‘Good Man’. Through the tragic events and unbelievable experiences that led Captain America to this time, Tony was lucky enough to find the ‘man’ underneath the legend. He discovered that despite being born in 1918 and being the most mature and responsible of all of them Steve was by far the youngest, technically he was only 30. To carry so much on his shoulders at such a young age is such a profound burden. At times it is hard for the genius to even fathom the horrors Steve must face daily. Thus his constant awful wit towards the Good Captain.
Johnny stiffened beside him and uttered “Sue” under his breath.  His sister must be there.  Steve squeezed his eyes shut.  He swallowed thickly.
Fury looked as if he wanted to shoot Tony.
His first instinct was to go check on Tony and see how he was doing.  But then everything that had happened the night before came rushing back to him.  He had to think it over for a moment.  He couldn’t simply avoid the genius the way he wanted to because surely someone would notice.  He knew he would have to act as if nothing had changed, as if he didn’t have this incredible realization about himself.  He had decided to make it a personal mission, to make sure nobody realized that something was different about him.  His mission would be put into action soon enough as he spotted Natasha waltzing up to him with an air of determination.
Right now they are all on the helicarrier coming up with viable plans to better handle the situation.
"Oh! Can we take the elevator!?" Ellie asked excitedly.
“This is how.”
“I don’t think I can do it.” Tony whispered.
“Only if you join me?” Tony said in a way that was as close as pleading as he could get.
Now Steve was really crying, this time however, they were tears of utter joy. He cradled her small convulsing form close to his own shaking body. The other children cheered, Johnny let them go and they swarmed Steve and Becka.
How will this nightmare come to an end?
“Why put off the inevitable? Ever since I fought that assassin there has been something scratching at the edge of my mind. Like a word just at the tip of your tongue.”
Before the knowledge of his newfound isolation and proximity to the mother could consume him, he felt a presence side up to him.
As it was Natasha was out of commission due to a minor concussion and a bullet wound in the shoulder.  It went through and through and missed anything vital but it was going to hurt for awhile.  Clint came out of it the least scathed.  His various cuts and bruises already well treated and on the mend.  Maria had a broken arm from a particularly nasty run in with the Soldier’s metal arm.
Steve rolled over in a huff and tried to banish such dangerous thoughts from his mind. He realized he faced Peggy now. He gently placed his hand on her belly and was nearly brought to tears at the fluttering movements of his unborn child. With the incredible feeling of blossoming life beneath his palm he finally drifted off to sleep.
A/N: Have no fear this is definitely going to be Steve/Tony! I’m shamelessly using Bucky to put Steve through a bit more torment before his run in with the 1950s.
Steve’s way ended up discharging the excessive power in a shockwave.  Though quite powerful and damaging with the capacity of knocking all of the Avengers through a loop, it was nowhere near the annihilating force it was meant to be.  Despite the absolute terror of the entire circumstances the only reported fatalities were mostly birds.  All in all not bad.
“Nothing happened!” Steve tried.
Tony hazard a glance up at him and regarded his stunned face. He was staring at the dead mother in astounded appreciation.
Okay, Barnes was not cooperating just like he thought. He’d feel like the scum of the earth, even more so than he does now, but he could threaten him with the journal. It could also backfire spectacularly. He could also try and figure out how to use the journal, however, he was sure Steve would never forgive him for that. No matter where he was.
Chapter 45: Our Life Beyond the Stars
Johnny nodded.
Iron Man’s face plate snapped open to reveal Tony’s face. Looking at his thunderous expression Steve was sure he had never seen him so furious. This was so not how he wanted the last of his life to go. He knew from experience that an angry Tony did not listen to reason. But he had to try.
Despair was thick in the room until the Asgardian prince spoke up once more, “Do not despair my friends,”
“If it’s really the end of the world, she didn’t wanna miss it.” Jane replied as Tony rolled his eyes.
I could not bear the anguish and grief I felt.
“Get Down!” Captain America shouted as a shot rang out a second later. They all dove down immediately. Steve’s right cheek was on fire. He could feel the blood begin to drip down his face.
“What I do care about is whether or not he’s treating you right. Which I don’t think Tony Stark is capable of.” He said pointedly.
“We already are.”  He smiled kindly at him.
“No…  No…  No…”  Was Natasha’s whispered mantra into Clint’s shoulder as she began to sob once more.
He could not believe the twists and turns the last month had taken. It did not escape him how he had premonitions of this very scenario not three days ago. How this was the very thing he feared most after everything that had happened with Barnes. Unfortunately, this living nightmare was about to get infinitely worse.
Everyone looked at the professor disbelievingly. They were silent for a moment while the news sunk in. Clint was the first to break the silence.
So, I killed them, the murderers.
“Don’t you fucking do that!” Clint shouted before socking Tony and the arm.
Despite all of the devastatingly horrible things that has happened that day, somehow seeing Natasha in that state was the most frightening of all.  He slowly brought his hand up to run through her soft crimson hair.  That action only served to make her cry harder.
Unlike Hank, Tony’s departure was noticed.  Steve felt every single step he walked away.  His heart shuddered in agony the moment Tony was no longer in the room.  Natasha and Clint were successful in recapturing his attention as they began to tell him in excruciating detail everything that happened that day.
“Yeah! You should draw with me Daddy!” She exclaimed. “I’m going to draw Rocky again and do it the way you taught me!”
“And what is your endgame? What is your purpose?” This time Steve asked.
He squeezed the bridge of his nose forcing his emotions back.  Despite having a better day than he’s had in awhile his heart was still so raw after everything.  He just didn’t know any more.  He felt like coming out of the ice all over again and he hated it.
A/N: Hello Everyone! Thank you all for the kudos! I appreciate every single one of them.
Tony smirked at him. "Arc reactor. Keeps me from dying."
A few hours had passed and Tony had insisted on trying out a preliminary simulation on the computer.  After watching a simulated victims head explode in a dismal blaze of utter catastrophe they thought it would be a good idea to take a break and get something to eat.  Although it would have been rather difficult to stomach something after that grotesque display.
Brock turned to Bucky, livid. Bucky knew it was a bad idea to fuck with the guy. He could feel that he was a talented fighter but he also knew the guy was a hothead with an ego. If Bucky can keep him riled up then it would give Stark time to get them out of there.
Thor had returned shortly after and regretted to inform them of no new information. After he had discussed the fate of the planet Trëyía with his father, they were rather forlorn to admit that if there had been any evidence or clues of Calamity on Trëyía it was destroyed during Asgard’s invasion against the Miigs. That is of course if the Miigs hadn’t destroyed the evidence themselves in their pursuit of plundering the planet’s riches. All in all it was really such a shame, the whole situation.
Over the next three days for all intents and purposes the Avengers grew. Fury was on radio silence from the government. The last thing he told them was that they had yet to make any real progress. They do not need those people with their petty disputes and wayward agendas holding the reins on this case. This was no longer in an issue of National Security or even global security. This now involves the entire universe essentially.
He really, really did not want to talk about it.
“In a specialized recovery center in Los Angeles.”
“Oh, I guess that makes sense.” He chuckled.
“Alright!” Steve said as he looked around at his current team.
Sam got up and started pacing, “It’s fine right?  I mean if there is anyone in the world capable of finding out what’s on that drive and figuring out how to use it Tony Stark can.”  He stated reassuringly trying to keep it together.
Steve felt hopeless and broken.  It hurt.  It cut him deep.  This was his home and his family, his friends and Allies.  He was utterly useless, unable to stop this from happening.  He slid down the walled nearest him and slumped on the floor in a catatonic state.  He did not know where he was, what room or what floor. All he knew was that this was all his fault somehow.
Bruce had a thought, “So the etching of this being was from that time?”
“BARF?” Barnes quirked an eyebrow, his lips curving, pausing his hand movements.
"Very well." She conceded as she began to flutter just infront of him. "Did you not find it odd that you had come to realize your hidden desire for your friend and comrade Anthony only after this case started? Or how each consecutive case had left your body more broken than it had ever been since the serum infusion procedure? Was it not convenient that your friends came up with the most debilitating way to deal with your incoming doom? Was it not the very things you loathed in your youth, to be confined, left behind and belittled?"
The soldier stood there somewhat awkwardly, with the metal skeletal arm still hanging limply from his left shoulder. Tony turned to Barnes and took him in appraisingly.
A/N: Yess! Here’s the next one! There’s a couple of surprises for you all at the end that I know you will enjoy! Again, Sorry for any and all errors, I can’t find them all though I try, I promise I try. Lol
“Please trust me.” His voice was soft and his eyes were pleading.
Howard cut in. “She is incredibly talented, you must let her play for you some time.” He gushed.
“Not how he told it.” Bucky replied, wholly unconvinced.
“When Tony succeeds in s-stopping you I still belong to you? Will I remain where I c-choose to be or do you have other p-plans for me after that?”
She landed smoothly about twenty feet in front of them. Tony backed flush against the Captain. He reached back and intertwined his left hand with Steve’s. That simple action did not escape Calamity attention. She smirked at them. Steve tightened his grip.
“Fine, still a little sore.”
“How does your shoulder feel? This step will show us how well the bone anchor should hold up.”
Please leave a review and let me know what you think. All theories and comments welcome.
He perked up at that and gave her a questioning look.
The Captain fought the urge to offer his hand and instead bowed.
“Blow job? Hand job?... Fisting??” She asked with a straight face.
The soldier clutched his own throat in an effort to calm his emotions. He reached out and grasped Tony’s forearms in solidarity. Somehow the genius found a modicum of comfort in that.
Beep. Beep.
How the hell did that fucking bunny get a hold of a working model of it?
Tony was so deep in thought he did not hear the approach of the dark assailant behind him and thus did not realize he was about to become his unassuming victim.
“I don’t know how to take that.” Tony said flatly.
Steve nearly startled at his sudden appearance.  He swiftly turned to him.
Though a grand and profound part of him yelled and screamed at him to get up and to find his primary team, begged and pleaded for him to find Tony; he could not move.  He was too devastated to the point of non function.  He was broken into so many pieces he did not know where to start to piece himself back together.
“Tony!” Tony nearly jumped out of his skin at the sudden exclamation.
“Alright you heard him. From what Hawkeye had managed to gather they’re easy to destroy. However they seem to be multiplying rapidly we need to find their source.”
“Hmm.” She became pensive, “I was afraid that.” She sighed heavily. “What you have is a form of shell shock, Steve. It’s a side effect of the extreme conditions you were in then subsequently nearly freezing to death.”
Ah, yes. The all-important heartbeat.
Easy as pie.
'A friend…' Steve abysmally reminded himself. 'I can't remember.'
"She hasn't fully materialized here yet. What we see is an impression of her." Tony replied.
“This… This needs to be redone.” She sighed concerned.
Chapter Thirty-Two: Torn and Frayed So Let It Bleed
No fucking wonder.
“Okay!  I was being a jerk and she called me out on it.  Happy?”
Most nodded their heads in agreement.
She smiled coyly. "It matters not."
Two down four to go.
The irksome part was the fact that the assassination happened so close to Steve and involving him so dangerously only days after his suicidal near death experience, landed him back on house arrest (for his own safety of course.) In addition to that it was Tony’s idea.
Bucky nodded then shook his head. Steve said something similar to him not long ago.
“Aye, Aye Captain! Now there’s the Capsicle we all know and love.” The billionaire smirked and turned back to his computer.
“But it’s a secret okay! You can’t tell anybody.”
He snapped his fingers and made sure he had Steve’s undivided attention.
“Oh! Potts!”
~-0-~
He gently lifted Becka off of his chest and handed her to Johnny.
Steve sighed.
He winced in agony as his stitches protested his movements vehemently. When he was able to focus again Iron Man was trying to stabilize himself.
“Like I wanted to shit my pants.” Reply Clint immediately.
Tony grinned,
He ran his hands down his face forlornly. This sucks, plain and simple.
“Yeah, it’s too bad you’re banging Tony now, and here I still thought I had a shot.” Darcy replied mournfully.
He would never be able to un-see the way Bucky’s face contorted or the way the puddle of his blood glistened in the sunlight as it steadily grew in size. But even more disgusting was the fact that he was unable to reach him yet again. He was forever doomed to fail.
This was the life.
"Okay." She said taking it.
Well shit.
"You have no idea the events I set into motion. Do you really want to know?"
Bucky frowned deeply. The twins set up in attention, concerned over the next part.
“Yep.” He groaned curling into himself in the fetal position. “I don’t believe me either…”
Tony nodded slowly, “Yeah, a .5% chance.  She said it’s in the code.”  The genius stated despondently.
“Oh come on! Did you not see that… Smile? He’s so tanked.” Tony argued.
“If it isn’t enough, which I won’t lie to you, may very well be the case, but if it isn’t enough we can at least give the next race of people it targets a running chance.” Steve stated with absolute conviction.
Yet despite all the strength in his enhanced body, all his sharp reflexes and superior instincts; he let Bucky, his entire world, slip right through his fingers. He let his brother die.
“Oh my Dear Anthony. What you think you have isn’t close to being accurate. The algorithms and data you have of my supposed abilities are incomplete at best.” Tony visibly gulped.
“Sir, three more sub units are approaching.” Jarvis warned.
In that moment Tony fully realized just how true that was. It had dawned on him the full extent of Calamity’s planning. The hexilien algorithm was so top secret and secure that it was likely never written down and those who knew it have long since perished. The algorithm thus became lost to the throes of time. It was entirely possible that Barnes was the only person in the entire world who knew it. And Calamity planned it that way.
“You don’t plan on coming with us.” Bucky prodded accusingly.
It doesn’t matter.
“That is until I create a device that will negate your abilities.” The crazy genius said 40% jokingly and 60% seriously.
'Definitely a registry.' He concluded then signed his name on the indicated line.
He sat back down on the edge of the bed. The buckle of one of the useless restraints was digging into his thigh. He did not notice however because he was desperately trying to piece together his broken heart. He was so utterly confused. He thought… He actually thought he and Tony had something.
“I’ve had an alien in my head recently, that might be it.” Steve retorted, resisting the urge to look in Calamity’s direction. “Why do you need to read my mind? You know who I am.” The Captain ventured.
“Holy fuck.” Barnes muttered under his breath.
Just as Johnny was about to deliver a smoldering punch into that vile man’s face he stopped midair only a few feet away. Steve watched with horror as a woman came out of the shadows. She was controlling Ben and Johnny making them just float there. She approached them steadily and when she touched their faces they were out old.
After a few more moments he added,
Dammit, he had to keep moving!
Why was he not good enough?
The bots grip was becoming tighter. Slowly but surely tighter and tighter.
“You’re really here! How?”
Okay.
Why did he have to think these weird things?!
“Well it’s not like I broadcast it! That kinda shit happens if you get blown up enough!” Tony retorted rubbing his ears.
Steve let go of the aid bot and dove.
While Barnes was happily recovering after the removal of the hardware, Tony spent a few days analyzing each and every component and adding his own altercations and upgrades to the new designs. After that, he had Jarvis thoroughly analyze the microchips and came up with a refined program for the neurotransmitters. He had also isolated Hydra’s other potentially malevolent programming and was running analysis on their exact purpose.
"We can go home now, Steve." She said through a wet happy smile filled with hope. Hope and a promise for a happy, peaceful future. A future that he yearned for all his life.
Once they had settled down into their little corner, Steve addressed them.
“And?” Tony replied impatiently.
"Tony is the most unpredictable person I know. I had no doubt he could beat you." Steve responded finally with a small smirk.
“Hold on tight, Cap.”
“That uncivilized animal, Clint, that’s who!” Tony shouted as he started to rapidly type away.
"Did you assume I merely took a backseat as events played out? You truly have not realized have you, the magnitude?"
“Oh Steven, they are not comfortable with it at all, but do it to protect you.”  The Professor expressed softly.
He wasn’t going to take shit from anyone at this point, especially the troublesome ones…*cough*Clint*cough*Tony*cough*Coulson*cough*. What? The later couldn’t stay dead. Gotta watch out for those guys.
“Sir?”
Steve smiled inwardly at the sight. He was happy Tony was reconnecting with his family.
Tony cheered on the inside.
“Natasha decked me, okay.”  He eventually answered.
“I’m sorry I’m not a good enough reason for you to want to stay!” Said Tony before turning on his heel and leaving abruptly.
Xavier had gathered a special team of mutants together and are going back and forth between the Avengers compound (home base), the sky base and back to the school to compile the rest of the data and to include anybody else interested in joining.
Steve in his distraught haze realized with a modicum of reassurance that Bucky was aiming to maim and not kill. That and as long as he didn’t kill any of them means he still had a chance.
He walked into her room and was saddened when she stopped singing the moment she realized his presence. His sadness was short-lived, however, when her expression beamed and she squealed in delight as she launched herself at him.
They came upon Steve’s quarters first.  Tony stopped and smirked at Steve as the Captain open the door intending to go inside.
Tony did not know how long he was staring blankly at the screen of code when Barnes came up behind him and whistled.
They stared at each other for a time. Their gaze was full of sorrow and misery. There was so much that was left unsaid especially on Steve’s part. He felt like there was a wall between them now. Something had shifted. No matter how much he wanted to tell the genius all the things he felt, he could not bring himself to do it. He couldn’t take that step and bury himself in Tony’s arms and spill his heart out knowing that in a matter of days it all wasn’t going to matter anyway.
After the San Jose fiasco where some jackass had the audacity to challenge him over the rights of an electrical repair kit (Fucker), Tony had installed a precision soldering function to each of his new suits in the event that he needed to fix himself in a pinch. He was now eternally grateful for his own foresight. Though it's not quite being used for its intended purpose, its current value was immeasurable.
“Alright.” Steve smiled tiredly.
"My God, I love you Steve. So fucking much and it's my stupid fucking fault that every fucking thing happened the way it did because I was too scared to tell you the truth." Tears began flowing down Tony's face. "And I was so cruel to you. I had mistakenly thought you had betrayed us, me, and I had said so many terrible things to you that I can never take back and not one of those things were true. You are the most important person to me and I failed you! I am so sorry Steve! I'm so fucking sorry!" He cried in agony and regret.
Please don’t forget to leave a review. All questions, comments and theories welcome.
“I-I have little time left and I should want to be spending it with my family, and I do!” He did, twenty minutes ago. “But I don’t think I can get over the guilt of just leaving Bucky out there somewhere. Here, I am safe and surrounded by people who care about me and he’s out there alone in a hostile environment.”
He considered her point.
"Daddy? What's wrong!?" Ellie screamed completely alarmed now.
Tony was seething from this guys cocky attitude.
“You two aren’t the only ones.” Tony replied.
“Its ok Steve, I’ve got you.” He said soothingly.
“S-sorry.” He barely managed out, his voice broken and torn.
Becoming very pensive, the Captain couldn’t help to think that a vacation after this case would be absolutely wonderful.  If only they could in fact solve the case.
Steve was about to pull away before Tony leaned in and kissed that treacherous tear away. The sensation made him gasp. He still wanted Tony, make no mistake but this is all sorts of wrong. Tony pulled back searching his eyes.
It had a homey rustic vibe to it, but what would one expect from a barbecue steakhouse.  Within minutes a waiter came by with a set of menus.  He quickly went into the specials, obviously trying his damnedest to suppress his excitement over the identity of his guests.  He bounced on his toes happily as he looked between Steve, the shield, the suit, and Tony and then around again as he waited for them to decide what to order.
He had just finished gently placing the devices on the foreheads of his fallen teammates when Xavier had alerted everybody to convene together to discuss the newest threat. Seconds after that he had gotten several red alerts from Jarvis about odd and peculiar sightings of that stupid bunny.
Go figure.
Another scream sounded somewhere in the compound and chaos ensued.  Over the next hour Steve witnessed many of their Allies fall to Calamity’s whim.  The red alerts were blaring and Steve had traveled room to room, floor to floor, almost in a trance attracted by the frightened and panic stricken only to arrive and watched helplessly as more members of their team dropped completely unconscious.
"The black star from the heavens."
“Shut up! Like you’re any better, Barton!”
Steve stood there in the barn alone and in complete shock. He could hardly believe all that had just transpired and yet he had also marveled at how so much, and at the same time, so little made sense.
“Thanks, I think.” Regardless, Steve felt a hundred times better.
“I need the keystone to complete the circle, or perhaps more accurate, the cherry on top so to speak.” She said as she tapped their very top of Fury’s head gently.
"Not gonna happen, asshole!" Iron Man sent another barrage of missiles to the Rhododendron. The pink bunny remained unmoved and Tony's earlier suspicion had been confirmed when they exploded harmlessly thirty feet away.
"According to my father, several thousand years ago when last this thing appeared, Asgard tried to save the last few remaining alive on the planet, none survived.”
“Oh God, why did you escape? And you better not say to do something stupid.”
All kudos, theories and comments welcome.
“So a ghost story then?”
“Oh I’m sorry Iron Ass, that the rest of us can’t shrug off reality like you do. There’s a difference between dying in action and getting caught by this thing with your pants down! Why don’t you make something useful to stop this thing!”  Clint countered obviously losing it.
"And you know what else?" Steve asked as he shifted Ellie around his waist so that he could stoop to grab his now cold coffee.
The two doom bots closed in on him and he had realized last minute that they had essentially cornered him. He found himself at a literal crossroads. Behind him were the doom bots, straight-ahead was a large bank, to the right was a street blocked off by a collapsed building and to the left the portal.
He needed to create 2020 of them. No, no new cases had popped up, however, there had been many misdiagnosed cases all over the world that they initially did not catch. Now that Tony was damn near intimately familiar with her energy signature, he used various satellite scanners and other similar methods to locate every last individual in the entire world exuding her energy.
His remaining team members that were not helping with the evac or deployed elsewhere were engaging the frightful creatures head on as quick as possible. No one wanted to find out the hard way exactly what those creatures were capable of. Their deaths were swift but not without the horrendous sound of squelching and gurgling.
I apologize for any and all errors. It’s just little old me over here, and though I try my best I cannot find them all. Please, do not forget to leave me a review at the end and let me know what you think!
“Whatever happens I can take it.” He tried to sound reassuring.
But he had to.
Tankar swears up and down that he has no idea what Harker was planning.  He did not care to ask as long as Harker generously funded his research and development of his Fuzz Buzz dolls.
Tony winced.
“I did what I had to to keep you alive! I needed you to trust me!” He urged.
“I-I don’t… Thank you.” The soldier uttered just above a whisper. “Dumbass.”
With that thought a whole floodgate opened up and he thought of all the ways he loved Tony Stark. Everything from his easy points to love to the worst ones that were so enraging he wished extreme violence upon him. He loved them all. He loved Tony Stark inside and out, through and through.
“Whatever you say, dumbass. Jarvis, play my tunes.” Barnes called up.
“How does it feel, Stark?! To have your life’s work your technology proven useless!” Rhododendron called out. His lackeys snickered ruefully.
"Oh?" Tony stepped toward Steve.
Steve couldn't help but to pick up on the reverence in Calamity's voice as she spoke of her long-lost friend and the tribe she was born to.
“Steven, what is currently happening is much bigger than you suspect.  I can’t say much more about it but it doesn’t all have to do with you.”
He brought up what appeared to be a holographic nervous system on display, a neurological representation, if you will.
“Yes, hello Doctor, it is a pleasure.” Charles greeted the good Doctor as he shook his hand.
"Oh, I beg to differ, Stark!" The Rhododendron shouted from his perch upon a stack of cars about three hundred meters to Iron Man's left.
"Yes, you really don't remember much to you?"
“So, what did you do?”
Tony glared at him. That cheeky bastard!
“Not even this bruise on my wrists hurts.”
site you went on.” Tony paused for a moment to let that comment sink in.
“Okay, I want Natasha, Clint, Sam, Rhodey and Ms. Munroe on the backup team.” They nodded in affirmation.
Well crap.
Steve sighed heavily. "I kind of had a nightmare last night and it's hard not to think about." He answered as truthfully as he could.
The moment Jarvis alerted him of Steve’s escape he thought he could literally feel his heartbreak. He had just gotten done convincing Rhodey to ignore the executive kill order when the alert came through. He was so devastated and angry. He tried hard to keep it together. That was until he had returned to the tower only to find his team in such a sad state of affairs. He buckled down immediately searching every avenue he could to find Steve. To find him so he could shove his fist into his face and demand why.
"The right time."
“Uh, no it’s fine. We’re just being followed.”
“It’s always nightmares.” Barnes continued in a whisper. “Every night and day nightmares. It’s always the same, always remembering what Hydra did to me and subsequently what I did to others.” He said darkly.
What was he going to do? Would it even be possible to leave the battlefield and make his way back to the tower to try and figure something out? He couldn’t just leave his team to fight her alone could he? Even if he could somehow feasibly make it back to the tower in a reasonable amount of time it would still take at least an hour to create something that would actually work. There just was no time!
"Don't… Know yet…" Barton wheezed.
Steve sighed and rubbed his forehead. That does sound about right.
“I guess I just rub people the wrong way.”  He shrugged with a laugh as he scratched the back of his head.
him.” He spoke directing his response to Steve. “With Cerebro I could sense all mutants with the capacity to manipulate another physical being resulting with the effect corresponding with the victims.  There are five total in the entire world with the capacity to do something even remotely like this.” He said gesturing to the various reports scattered around the table.
"No, this isn't real." He said again as the black cracks spread across his vision webbing out in sharp harsh angles.
Chapter Seventeen: Trouble Follows Me Like a Mystery
Hopefully he could figure it out before Tony finds him or before Calamity claims him. Which could happen any time now…
God why!? Why was he so stupid!? He couldn’t even reassure Steve that he had eyes for him only.
He does not know who he was addressing at this point all he knew was everybody needed to stop. It didn’t have to go down like this.
"Oh, God yes!"
Soon most of the occupants of the room realized what agent Romanov was about to do to quell Clint’s panicked rant.  That is until the Professor let out a moan of agony.  Everyone shocked to silence as their attention was drawn to Professor in horror.  They didn’t know what ailed him.  He looked stricken and exhausted and in pain.  But before any could inquire about his condition the reason made itself blatantly an unmistakably known by a deafening roar.
“Hydra killed my parents. You are no more than the gun they use to pull the trigger.” He stated bluntly. “At first, it’s true, I wanted you dead, wanted you to pay, to suffer. But instead I got a sickening dose of reality, a new perspective so to speak.” He paused, Bucky listened openly, utterly stricken. “There is no one on this planet that will make you suffer more than yourself. Look at you, you are so destroyed over the things Hydra forced you to do you can’t even function right. You barely go a few hours lucid before you completely breakdown because the memories of the horrible things that has been done to you and the horrible things they force you to do to others are too much to bear.” Tony painfully observed.
“When we can we will get you back to your parents.” Steve took a deep breath.
“Bucky!” He started in his deep authoritative voice. Bucky froze and stared at him. “No we don’t.” He stated firmly.
The Captain whipped around to face Ironman, sensing what he was thinking.
"Yes, sir!" Angie replied coyly as she peeled out once again and headed for the hospital.
He ran his hands over his arms and chest, thoroughly mapping out his muscles. His face was definitely his own but his body was almost foreign to him despite the fact he could definitely feel the difference. There was so little downtime overseas and during the tour to really have the time inspect himself so intimately. In the beginning, to be honest, he was kind of afraid to. He began to run his hands over his arms and chest again.
Tony groaned, cursing the world and his entire existence.
“OK, I know that the only thing anybody really wants to do right now is to get a little bit of shut eye after everything that has happened.  But we gotta keep on truckin’.” He paused for a deep breath, steeling himself for a lengthy explanation.
After weeks of sitting on the bench he was excited to get back into the game.
'This is going to be a painfully long day.' He thought.
“From attaining and he using the keystone?  No.”
“Already underway, sir.”
"Please Daddy! Please remember me!" Eleanor cried.
“No, he said for Thor to take me away. He said nothing about not coming back!” Tony shouted as he tossed away the soldering iron after making the last of his improvisional repairs.
“Yes, please do. It’s the perfect way to simulate exactly how you would react in battle. That way I can tweak and make adjustments to any flaws I overlooked to accommodate your fighting style. Also, don’t sweat it if it breaks. I want to know its limitations.” Tony explained.
Really now?
He scratched his wrist.
Only Tony, Ben and Sam seemed to remain conscious.
“You should write him a letter.” Wanda said without preamble.
Double damn.
He continued to watch the world move around him for a time before he spotted incoming company upon the horizon. Falcon landed a few feet from him, disturbing the flora and fauna from their graceful dance.
Mystifyingly he did it without blowing something up. It was a surprise to everyone, and perhaps a disappointment to others. Although Eric Selvig and the Asgardians did help him significantly. Still there is no denying that Tony’s genius is responsible for the miraculous capability to communicate through galactic matter and light years of distance.
"Wait," Steve shook his head. "What are we even talking about?" He thought out loud.
Steve sighed deeply, thinking back on it all, all the way back to when they were children. And everything after that.
Tony watched his activity warily, hoping he didn’t decide to buy obscene things online with an audience present. The genius nearly died in horror a few days ago when Clint walked in while Barnes was in the middle of buying a hot pink leash and collar. It was not for dogs.
He was going to have to figure out how to keep his team alive.  At least if they stop Calamity’s whims the others would wake up.  However, if the deadly soldier got to them first, that’s it, dead.  This was beyond nightmarish.
“I have nothing to say.” Was Barnes’s clipped response.
“Jesus Christ!” Tony shouted grabbing his ear and launching out of his chair onto the floor.
The others followed her gaze.
“Oh, okay.” She looked sad for a moment.
He quickly went to the start of his feed and watched the moment the kiss happened. He desperately watched everyone’s reactions and realized with wretched relief that though many displayed shock none were looks of disgust. He felt a twinge of irritation as Barton passed over a wad of cash to Romanov.
He was happy to be from a lineage that had that power to help those he cared for when they needed him.
“Sure thing!”
“Oh God, tell me you’re not planning-”
“Come on, come on!” He urged again, this time louder, almost screaming.
“You know,” she started. “Tony believed that you really intended on behaving.”
Eventually the fuzz balls caught up.
Steve went along with him certainly not in the mood to get into it with the distraught billionaire.
“I am going to go alert the others that you are awake. I know a certain genius that has been completely insufferable since you got here.” She winked at him.
As soon as he finished signing his name he looked up to find Bucky staring at him not two feet away. He flinched back in shock not expecting him to be so close. Bucky smirked widely at him, deeply satisfied at having surprised his brother so. Before Steve could even recover properly however he was thrown into another shock when he discovered his hands empty. Bucky had taken his sketchbook and began reading his letter. Dread spread through his body.
I created these tests to instill the lessons I needed to impart. I gave each world a chance to prove themselves to me and all have failed... Except one."
Everything was fine.
She walked around the room lightly touching our hero’s shoulders as she went. She lingers on Clint for a moment, grazing her hands over the bandage still present over the assassins forehead making him flinch almost violently causing Calamity to smirk. She also lingered on Tony for a moment, tracing his left ear gently before moving on. She finally came upon Fury.
Steve wakes up and deals with the fallout.
“Thank you, Nat.” He replied as he pulled her in for a hug.
"I'm- Ah!- A little busy!"
“Please Stop! He’s innocent!” But his plea fell on deaf ears as they continue to torture his brother.
‘That’s not good.’
Barnes nodded curtly and pulled up the chair indicated. He sat for a moment before becoming a bit restless. He opened his mouth to speak. “I –“
“Shh, I am one with the chair.” Tony replied ignoring Barnes’s question.
There was something about Thor's unsure tone that made Tony's cold dread turn to solid ice.
"What are you doing, Dumbass?! Don't just stand there, kill it! More are coming!" Barnes shouted from the rooftop across the way.
She eyed him for a moment. There was a time he wouldn’t have hesitated to suggest that they could share a shower together. Now, however… She smiled. She could tell that he really did have it bad for this person. (Let’s be honest, she knew who it was but wanted Tony to at least have this to himself… For now.)
‘Steve is not dead, Steve’s not dead.’ Was the only useful thing his mind could supply him.
“What? Tired already? I can do this all day!” Steve managed to taunt as he took a battle ready position.
With every ounce of strength, he tried to force his broken body to get to his brother even with Iron Man pinning him he managed to force the both of them closer nearly two feet. He could feel his flesh tear and his bones crack at the exertion. He desperately tried to reach for him.
“Yeah I’ll get right on that!” Was his snarky reply. Obviously he had his hands full.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Assuming everything she told us it’s the truth, all that drive contains is a more accurate data code to the one Tony had been working on. We won’t know to what value it could be to us if we don’t plug it in. She may have handed as the trump card and is waiting to see if we use it or throw it away. She did say that this is a test.” Steve concluded.
Not to mention Tony is back at the compound working hard with Jarvis on decrypting that code.
"WAH! Where did the rift go!" The Rhododendron bellowed as he shakingly picked himself off of the ground.
He gulped audibly and splashed his face again. He desperately tried to gain control of his rapid breathing and his wildly beating heart.
“Come on, let’s get this kitchen cleaned up. And since you love doing the dishes so much, I’ll let you do them.” She smirked.
He headed into the barn where his studio was, intending to write down his thoughts about the armor, regardless, knowing that it more accurately pertained to the mysterious man who piloted the strange armor.
“Look at how the tides have turned!” The Rhododendron sneered. “Take them out boys!” He commanded.
He backed himself up against the façade of the building and held out the pipe to shield himself. The second doom bot charged, and he fainted to the left then stabbed the pipe up under the headpiece and tore the head clean off. The third doom bot took that opportunity to strike out at Tony's extended arm breaking it.
Tony frowned. He really did feel for him. He couldn’t even begin to understand what Steve must be going through.
Barnes was unfazed by Tony’s attitude. “Way to be positive.” The soldier muttered.
Steve saw everything before him in slow motion. His mind working in overdrive. He finally regained his bearings and made a petrifying realization. He alerted Black Widow at once.
“No! Listen. Nobody died. Yeah, it’s horrible that it all had to play out this way. But think about it. If you two worked it out and Steve was able to resist her, then she would have had to resort to even bloodier methods to break him. No doubt ensuring mine and your death. Then where would we be? Steve gone and no one to figure out the code. The entire world would be doomed with no hope.” He said.
She was about to frown and protest but he continued.
This is starting to go downhill very quickly.
“I w-want f-freedom.” He whispered.
“Who are you and why are you here?”
“I went out with Tony last night.”  Steve winced internally realizing how that sounds.
No, no, that wasn’t the irksome part.
“You didn’t kill me.” He stated simply.
That fucking bastard!
“I think I’m going to be overly cliché here and order the prime rib, medium rare, with a loaded baked potato and a beer.”  Tony stated flashing the waiter a grin.
“You were so concerned and you went through so much trouble to keep me from over exerting myself.” He said gesturing to the restraints. “I’d hate for you to fail your mission now.” Steve forced the smirk.
This was exactly how that which wanted everything to play out. He played right into her hand perfectly, like a good little stupid pawn.
make you wish another wayward missile hit you in the nuts again.’ Tony felt that it would be the absolute best opportunity to go see how Bruce and Hank were faring.  So he backed away slowly and b-lined toward the doctors. When he arrived Bruce couldn’t help but to ask…
"I am." Natasha replied.
He was shaken out of his thoughts when the soldier took a deep breath that subsequently led to a coughing fit. The small trickle of blood on the corner of his mouth did not go unnoticed.
As they had gotten settled down by their new hiding spot by the river, Steve pulled out a small travel map and got down to business.
He took up the glass and poured himself a hefty amount.
“Jarvis? Is he asleep?” He asked hoping that if the soldier was asleep he could just leave and no one would have to know. He could just come back later when he actually had a clue as to what he would say.
He made out windows on the seventh floor of the factory that remained open.  That was probably his best shot at getting in.  It looks like all the fire escapes had been blasted off.
No pressure.
‘Crap!’ His suit wasn’t built for underwater combat. He had to make it to the surface. Then, unfortunately, Tony noticed a spike in Bucky’s vitals.
He looked at the open window and gauged the distance.  The more he stared the blurrier it got.  He felt woozy and lightheaded.  He shook his head and took a deep breath.  There was a chill in the air now and the slight breeze tickled the hairs on his body that were standing on end from the electrical charge.  Night was falling.
"Daddy, look!" She shouted pointing at a toy store window. "It's Princess Avalon of the Mystic Realm!" She cried excitedly, pointing at a beautiful fantasy-esque doll with gold hair wearing an armor/Princess-dress hybrid type thing. Steve noted that she came with a shield and sword.
“Good night Steve.”
“Good.” He said softly. “I’m going to make another adjustment.” He warned as he began to adjust some of the settings. “How does this feel?” He asked.
Tony just nodded in response and she turned abruptly striding out of the door.
~-0-~
"So, what's the plan?" Barnes asked as he unceremoniously dropped Tony before the pile.
“It’s brutal man, they’re small fry but we can hardly make any headway on them. They keep evading us and gunning down civilians. I don’t know how but they got some crazy tech on them. They already took out the Quin Jet, Falcon and War Machine. Their suits are dead. Be careful, man!” Hawkeye warned.
She looked apologetic knowing she just broke Captain America’s first rule.
“Considering all that has transpired I came up with something I think you will appreciate.”
"That I can do, any preference in size?" He asked walking to the back of the store.
“You need to trust us Steve. We’re out there looking for him. We will bring him in.” Tony managed to sound reassuring.
'This isn't real!'
A/N: What is happening? Can this get any more heartbreaking? Well stay tuned for the next chapter and find out.
"Oh?" She turned back to him and smirked. "Tell me, why should I not be?" She goaded.
“I can make more.” Tony muttered.
Clint never misses.
He grabbed a small cupcake and stuffed it in his mouth in an attempt to distract himself from his emotions.
Before Steve could respond however Bucky’s weight was off of him in an instant and all he could see was a red and gold blur.
Steve grabs him off his shoulder and set him down where he sprang up to normal size.
“What does that mean?” Bucky asked apprehensively.
“Oh no, I don’t want anything.  Just for these kids to grow up happy and healthy.”  He said with an awkward smile.
He groaned into his hands again. “Awesome.” He muttered.
"Listen to me Steven, preseption is relative. Evil does not exist in of itself. Just as the cold is merely the absence of heat or darkness the absence of light, so too is evil the absence of good, apathy the absence of empathy. However, there has never been a light that does not cast a shadow. Darkness cannot exist without the light as evil cannot exist without the good. I do not mean to abolish the evil from the planes of existence for it would be foolhardy and impossible. My true motive is to give all that is pure and good a fighting chance. I may not be able to eradicate or even in the slightest subdue evil, but I'm going to damn well try for my beloved Anük, this planet, and for you."
Quicksilver only ignored him and began pressing more buttons before snapping the device in half.
Tony blanched and felt all of the hope and positivity that was generated from finally solving the code completely disintegrate into putrid ash. His hands clenched into fists over his knees and hot treacherous tears sprang to his eyes. The floodgates to his dark emotions sprang open wide.
“What the fuck are you doing sneaking up on me like that?” Tony nearly squealed.
“Nah ah, not yet.” Tony cut him off. “This cup must be empty before we start- whatever this is gonna be.”
He looked to Thor again.
“Something stupid.” Steve replied. He almost wanted to laugh. It’s almost like a running joke now.
It vexed him greatly. He could remember some of the events that happened, the odd situations the man in the armor found himself in, but Steve can never remember the man himself.
It took a moment for Tony’s eyes to blink in comprehension.
The woman was gone by the time anybody could suspect anything. Everyone was wondering this significance of it. What was the point to that number?
"Indeed." She chuckled. "Many races across the universe usually depict Yggdrasil as a great tree because through years of observation she seems to be constantly branching out forever across the cosmos. Yet, she is so much more complex than that. It's difficult for me to find words you will understand, forgive me."
Bucky’s face went from concerned to scowling. But he did not interrupt. Steve could feel his desire for more information, however. So he began to tell him all about his complicated relationship with Tony Stark. He started at the beginning when he learned his good friend Howard Stark had a son that had become something of a hero in his own right and he had absently wondered if he would ever end up getting a chance to meet him. Surely if he was anything like Howard they’d probably get along swimmingly.
“Now you wanna know how I’m doing!?  I haven’t heard from you in days Tony, and we’d live together!”
Her hatchlings dropped dead out of the sky. The last of the chrysalises shattered in a mess of putrid ooze.
"Don't let the flame touch you! If you do you will surely die." Thor warned.
“Okay, this is a very special tool that IronMan made, okay?”
They stood in companionable silence for a time watching the last of the light fade away.  Both of them very well aware that there won’t be too many of these moments left for either of them.
"What on earth?" Steve was shocked to see his shield in action. What was even more shocking was to see Captain America on a rooftop opposite. "Who?"
“No, I mean it’s kinda shocking, you know? My best pal fancies men. Because I did not see that coming and yeah, back in 1945 I would have been creeped out a bit but after everything that has happened in the last seventy years? I really don’t care.” He replied running a hand through his hair pulling it out of his face.
They stared at him in awe. No doubt noticing his most striking features they couldn’t see before. Like the sharp angle of his nose, the kind shape of his brow line and his golden hair.
“Steve!  Oh my God I found him!”  Natasha’s voice rang out like the most beautiful melody.
Now they were sitting in comfortable silence slowly savoring their chocolaty dessert.  Tony couldn’t help but to get entrance by the good Captain once more.  He couldn’t help but think of how beautiful Steve’s stormy grey eyes were.  The genius had always marveled at the many ways the Captain’s eyes seemed to change color.  There were days where Steve would overlook the city with thinly veiled sorrow; his eyes appeared to be a pale blue almost like the sky on a cloudy day.  Then there were days, Tony realized, if he unknowingly pestered the Captain into a rage his eyes would turn a pale jade.  He had even noticed that in the heat of battle his eyes turned to cold steel.
“Shit!” God this was the stupidest idea ever, a prison break from one of the most secure prisons in the world. Real smart!
“How long?” His voice came out as a broken whisper.
“Just tell me what this is.” He demanded lowly on the edge of the fit.
Why does this have to be so damn complicated!?
‘Ah, to be a super soldier.’ His nerves regenerated faster than it took to fry them.
That foul mouth little turd was getting on Tony’s last nerve.
“I’m sorry Steve… Everything’s still in here.” He admitted softly.
"Because," he began again. "If Tony and I really had a daughter, her name would be Sarah!" He declared with finality.
“And I’ll take it!” Tony replied. “Tell me which ones give you a hard on and we’ll work on those.”
There was no answer.  They both turned to her shocked and in desolation.
Tony muttered a few more overrides to no avail.
“Override code 389-2468 Jam Jars.”
“See at first I thought that they were crazy or something was wrong. They were so happy and wonderful it was unreal, but I quickly came to the conclusion that they were just that way.
Three minutes.
Well that idea was shot out the window.  The energy of the room fell rapidly.  This is becoming ridiculous.
“How…  Are…  The kids?”  He grunted out.
After finally swallowing back his emotions curiosity got the better of him and he grabbed the box to inspect it. His heart nearly leapt out of his throat when he read the sender information. It was a code name: Stan Marvel. It was one of a few set up for his team in case something needed to be sent undetected. It was Steve’s code name!
He leaned down and pressed one last kiss to Steve's lips.
Some of the people in the room were looking through the documents and some, Tony, didn’t move. Steve looked sideways at Tony about to rip him a new one because he wasn’t participating only to realize when he got a glance at the genius’s phone that Tony was doing exactly that.
“Not what I heard.” Natasha ground out darkly.
"Daddy! I caught one, I caught one!"
“Oh, that’s an easy one.” Clint replied suddenly as he stuffed a sandwich into his mouth.
“All right!  That’s enough!”  A voice came over a loudspeaker.
“Johnny, what did she say?”  If Steve were sitting down he would literally be on the edge of his seat.
As he worked an odd sense of euphoric nostalgia overcame him. It’s like his hands knew exactly how to draw the armor. Every curve of the platings were so familiar. Almost like he had drawn this image hundreds of times before. It was coming out more defined and detailed on the page then it ever hoped to be in his own mind. He couldn’t understand how that was even possible but he kept working.
Gotta keep it together.
This was strange, he knew that Tony was just here and that he had dropped a couple of bombshells on him. But Steve couldn't remember what those were…
He then went on explaining how they ruled everything else out.  Thor went on thinking a bit more.
Tony glanced over and saw that indeed Barnes was referring to Calamity’s dense data load. Tony emitted a long-suffering groan and muttered an affirmation.
“Don’t you dare Tony!  I swear to god if you push me off-“
He took one last longing look at Steve, then stormed out of the infirmary altogether. He needed to get as far away from this place as fast as humanly possible.
“We are to speak with Fury immediately.”  Steve was almost thankful for whatever it is that’s likely happening.
“Because it won’t work on normal humans. If I tried to adjust it on myself I could fry my brain.” Tony stated bluntly.
“Oh!” She exclaimed suddenly. “I-I forgot!” She said turning back to her work abruptly.
“Bullshit! You say you love him but you couldn’t protect him from her. You’re the whole reason she got what she wanted in the first place.” The Soldier accused.
Everyone inwardly cringed at the number of victims and the current media level status.
Tony let out a shuddering breath as he stood from his position next to Steve's infirmary bed. Another red alert blared in the background and he sighed.
The man frowned then pushed the sunglasses up on his head while muttering, "Don't disconnect. Don't disconnect."
“Good, let me in then.”  Steve made his way to Tony’s lab.
“No, I did not. However, I wanted to. You are by far my favorite, love.” She smiled as she caressed his face. “Which is why I will leave you with this warning. Anthony is furious. And a furious Anthony Edward Stark is a very resourceful one. He will find you. He is utterly hell-bent on it. You do not have much time, love. The end is nigh.” She uttered with an air of foreboding.
‘No, don’t think that way.’  He thought trying to push the pessimism away.
All of this was a thousand times nicer than anything he had in his entire life. He smiled to himself. He was immensely happy that his wife and children did not need to struggle the way he did all of his life. He undressed slowly as he watched his reflection in the mirror.

He smiled serenely before turning his attention to the sky to admire its miraculous hues.
