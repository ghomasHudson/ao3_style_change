“You’ll have to be more specific,” Gabriel answered, turning his attention back to his yogurt. Charlie let out a low growl.
He walked into his kitchen and grimaced at the sight. Of course he put off doing the dishes for a week just so he could do them now. He started with those. After a grueling half an hour with crusty food bits and a lot of soap, he moved on to the counters. He cleared the end of his mail and other scrap pieces of paper. Then he swiped off all of the trash that littered the surface. Man, sometimes he could be a real slob. He wiped down the counters and decided this room was finished as well.
“Did you just fucking punch my boyfriend?” Dean yelled. Balthazar’s eyes went wide with panic. He spun around to face the cowboy.
Castiel nodded and took a deep breath. He reached for Dean’s hand and squeezed. Why the hell did it take half a day for them to give him this news? He thought he was dying!
“So...for the bet...you’re not gonna rat us out, are you?” Dean asked again, having forgotten he’d asked a first time. Balthazar pulled up to his apartment building and put his car in park.
“What’s got you so anxious?” Balthazar asked as he placed his dirty clothes in his locker. Castiel stopped playing with his hair long enough to look at Balthazar in the mirror.
When Castiel didn’t dive back in to kiss him, Dean became confused. Instead, Cas was just sitting on Dean’s waist...searching his chest for something.
“Jerk,” Sam responded, thinking that nothing could be seriously wrong if Dean still used their call and response.
that?” Castiel asked back. They had just gotten those tests back on the last day of school before break. And it’s not like he failed; the teacher had told them that this test was going to be the hardest of the year, so he was actually pretty happy with his grade.
“Please, Dean. We can go to Garth’s. You love the cheeseburgers there,” she reasoned. Dean rolled his eyes and sighed.
, the zipper. Castiel shivered slightly as the cool air hit his heated skin. Dean laughed as Cas' jeans got caught on his shoes. He slipped off the bed and removed Cas' shoes before unlacing his own. After that task was completed, he went back to taking off his boyfriend’s jeans. The boxers quickly followed, as Dean was becoming increasingly impatient. His eyes were fixed on the boy lying on the bed. The sight was absolutely breathtaking.
Dean woke up around ten and snuck downstairs to the engine bay. He didn’t want to deal with Gabe or Jo at the moment.
“Hey, hey...it’s ok, babe,” Dean comforted. Castiel turned his face into Dean’s stomach and Dean immediately wrapped his arms around his boyfriend.
He pulled out his laptop and rang up Balthazar on Facetime. He was surprised when the Brit actually answered.
“No, no, I was merely...announcing which shirt I’d pulled out of the drawer,” Castiel lied, smile growing wider as Dean crept towards him.
“After Naomi sent us out, we went to the office to get some work done. You told me that they fight all the time and that I shouldn’t worry, but then we heard the yelling and the crashes. I saw Cas right before you came out and he didn’t look good. You said you’d go and talk to Naomi,” she recounted.
"Can we talk now instead of later? I can't wait any more, dreading this conversation." Dean pleaded, focused only on his own bare feet, not even making eye contact with Cas.
“Of course you would ruin my beautiful meal with something as foul as that,” Naomi spat, her eyes deadly.
“I’m sorry about earlier. I didn’t mean to be pouty, I was just worried about you going back there so soon,” he explained.
Castiel’s smile faltered at Dean’s use of the word ‘mom’. He knew Dean hadn’t really meant anything by it, but Castiel could not stand the thought of that woman being his mother.
“Castiel?” Naomi’s voice called, muffled through the closed door. Castiel threw up once more, a bit louder this time, almost as if he were signalling to Naomi that he was in the bathroom.
“Dean, I am not losing this game, c’mon,” Castiel said, his competitive side leaking out over their little ‘enemies’ ruse. The couple concentrated and worked together, coming in under the wire, besting Jo and Gabriel ten-to-nine. Balthazar cheered and wrapped Castiel in a hug. Dean had to bite down on his tongue almost hard enough to draw blood. Castiel extracted himself from Balthazar and stuck out his hand.
“I think she's picking up ingredients for dinner,” Sam said, “we're having burgers,” he revealed with a smile. Dean smiled as well. He loved his mom’s burgers. When he looked back at Charlie, he recognized all the signs that she was about to embarrass him.
Dean mustered up his courage and looked at Cas. He pulled himself together and said what he needed to say.
Castiel raised his eyebrow and reached for the piece of leather. He toyed with it in his hands, bending it in half before snapping it loudly. A small moan escaped the freckled man as he closed his eyes, imagining how their night was about to play out.
Once the belt was tossed to the side, Castiel heaved himself off the bed to retrieve a washcloth. He feared if he didn’t clean them up now, he never would. He made sure the water was warm before running the towel underneath it, wiping off his hand and...other messy parts before returning to the bedroom to clean up his fiancé.
Why the hell did his dad think Castiel lying to his doctors was something he should do? As he sat on that question, the answer slowly dawned on him.
By the time the food came out, Dean was surprised at how hungry he actually was. He tucked into his food and finished his burger in record time. He rolled his eyes at the look Charlie gave him and flipped her off for good measure.
Neither of them were familiar with Middlefield’s “code of conduct” regarding personal relationships. They also didn’t want to jeopardize either of their jobs. It had taken many applications, interviews, and rejection emails for them to get here.
"Don't go all sappy on me, Winchester, I just asked if he was hot." Jo punched him in the shoulder and brushed passed him. "Give me a warning next time you're gonna grow a vagina." She said over her shoulder. She turned and fully faced him. "Hey, I have to help my mom out at the bar tomorrow, you should swing by to save me from absolute boredom."
“Did you two just...are you...what?” Charlie stammered. The couple beamed as wave after wave of confusion crashed down around their friends.
"Um, I hate to be a.....ah...a tease, but" Castiel moans as Dean keeps ravishing his skin. "Dean, I don't do the whole....'fuck right after running away from the police and hiding in a tree house' thing."
“What? No! Stay! We’re about to watch Focus! I hear that it’s really good,” Charlie pleaded. Castiel looked from her face, to Dean’s, and back to hers.
Cas glanced at Dean with a playful look in his eyes. He stood up and shot out his hand for Dean to grab. With great effort, Dean managed to stand up and throw his good arm around Cas's shoulders.
As Cas looked around the table at Dean, Sam, Mary, and Charlie, and he realized that whatever happened, he knew these people would be there on the other side for him. He went from feeling utterly alone not even a year ago, to having the greatest support system he’d had in his life. Although things were potentially going to get a lot harder for Cas, weirdly enough, he had a feeling that maybe everything
“Tempting...but why go for the whole kit-and-kaboodle on the very first round? How about we wager a shot,” Gabe counter-offered.
like he was. He didn’t know how Dean would react to him sharing a bed with Balthazar, so he just decided what Dean didn’t know wasn’t going to kill him.
He quickly put away all of the items that needed to be refrigerated. After looking at the clock, he figured that he’d let Future Dean deal with putting the rest of the items away. Quickly, he used the restroom before he headed out. He passed through their bedroom and noticed the laundry basket still overflowing. Confused, he walked out to their washer/dryer in the shallow hall closet and cursed when he saw that it had gone unused. Castiel never put in a load.
Cas nodded and pointed towards the nightstand. “There are some condoms in there too.” Saying that instantly brought Cas back to the parking lot where he and Dean had first ‘met’. Dean must have recognized the box because he was smiling at Cas when he returned with the items.
“Uhh...thanks. For helping me clean up this morning. That would’ve taken all day by myself,” Castiel said. Charlie just waved him off.
The teen clenched his jaw and stood up suddenly. As he walked towards the front door of the restaurant, he ignored the others calling out to him. He was tired of it!
Balthazar was shocked to hear Dean say this. Granted, he didn’t know the man very well; he was actually much more acquainted with Castiel, but he gave Dean the room to talk freely.
“My dad died about a year ago,” he started, “he was driving home from a late shift and uh, he got hit by a drunk driver. T-boned, actually. Some stupid kid thought speeding down the street drunk off his ass was a great idea. Slammed into him going 90 in a 45. My dad died on impact; barely even saw it coming,” Dean relayed, running a hand up and down Cas' back.
He let his eyes drift shut and he fell asleep next to his boyfriend, letting the sounds of the comedy on screen be the last sounds he heard before joining Dean in a nap.
He arrived at his house a few minutes before six. He crept to the tree next to his window and carefully started to climb upwards. It was a bit easier with the hint of daylight creeping above the horizon. Once inside, he shut the window and shot off a quick text to Dean about his safe arrival. He exited the bathroom and shucked off his sweats and socks, leaving them in a pile to deal with later. He snuck under the covers of his own bed and fell back asleep.
The taller man’s deft fingers quickly undid the button and fly of Cas’s jeans. Dean sat back on his heels and pulled Cas’s jeans down. His erection clearly showed as a tent in Castiel’s gray boxers. Dean could feel himself harden a little more of that were at all possible. Cas sat up on his elbows and looked at Dean.
Slowly, Dean descended to his knees, looking up at Cas through hooded eyes. He unzipped the slacks and palmed at Cas’ dick through his boxer briefs. Why his boyfriend insisted on only wearing orange underwear, Dean would never know, but he wasn’t about to bring it up now. He pulled Cas out and started teasing just the tip with his tongue. Castiel held onto Dean’s shoulders for dear life once he started picking up the pace.
“Cas, baby…” Dean moaned, gently thrusting his hips up in search of friction, “please. Please,” he repeated, eyes closed. Castiel rubbed Dean’s thighs soothingly, encouraging the man to be patient. Dean whined (“yes,
“I respect and appreciate you,” Castiel reassured his boyfriend, “I just also happen to like giving you a hard time every once in a while. I have to maintain a good compliment-to-roast ratio.”
“This is why you don’t make bets on love,” the brit pointed out. Gabriel scoffed and continued pacing the room.
Castiel nearly jumped out of the boat when suddenly a vigorous round of ammunition fired into the air, illuminating it once more as the show progressed further. His eyes tried to take everything in but there were so many blooms of light and bursts of sound that he could only sit there and try to process it all. He felt a hand slip into his as a string of shrieking fireworks were lit off. He glanced down at his and Dean’s intertwined fingers and felt a warm feeling spread throughout his body. He smiled as he looked back up; the truly
“Will do,” he agreed. Before he could open the door, Dean pulled him in for one last kiss. They were both smiling as the door shut between them.
One of the reasons Castiel let their pre-party make out session go a little long was to purposely skip his and Balthazar’s tradition, because it was a little too intimate for someone in a committed relationship to do. It didn’t cross any lines, but Castiel couldn’t do it with a clear conscience.
"Dean..." Cas whispered as he took a few steps forward to where Dean was standing. He placed a hand on Dean's shoulder and tried to catch the taller man's eye. When blue met green, Cas could see the devastation and regret in Dean's eyes. "I'm fine, your fine, let's get some sleep and talk about it tomorrow. Don't get me wrong, I'm pissed at you, but I don't think talking at this point in time is a wise decision." Dean nodded in agreement.
They walked to the front door (Dean insisted the tour should start there, not the back door), and Castiel pulled his keys out of his pocket. He quickly unlocked the door and swung it open to reveal the inside of his house. Dean’s eyes went wide and a smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. Cas thought he was watching a kid on christmas day.
“And I don’t think your bedroom is ‘cooped up’. I like it. A lot, actually. It’s a lot more...homey,” Castiel explained, “this feels like too much space most of the time.”
Only about 30 minutes into the movie, Castiel’s phone vibrated in his pocket. He fished it out and read the text.
“I’m sorry. I must’ve spaced out,” Castiel apologized, he braced one hand on Dean’s chest to balance himself as he looked into the green eyes. “What were you saying?”
He observed his barely recognizable boyfriend. There were tubes everywhere, bandages were wrapped around his head. His face was covered in bruises. He looked awful. Castiel took his hand and leaned his head on Dean's arm.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean yelled out as he entered their apartment, shrugging off his jacket and unlacing his boots. “Sorry I’m late, I was-” Dean’s explanation died on his tongue as he took in the sight before him.
Dean reached around and undid Castiel’s belt, sliding it out of its loops. Once it was free, Dean cracked it, causing Castiel to jump. Dean knew his boyfriend didn’t like belts in the bedroom, so he dropped it to the floor; he didn’t mind...he had other plans, anyway. His skilled fingers returned to the front of Cas' jeans, rubbing the man’s erection ever so slowly before undoing his button and sliding down the zipper.
“Damn you guys are pretty good at this,” Charlie commented. She apologized to her teammates when they gave her an exasperated look.
Dean moved lower until he reached Cas' collar bones. Now, these Cas could hide from Naomi. Dean got to work leaving hickeys everywhere he could. After a moment, Cas pulled Dean up by his hair and kissed him hard.
Dean pulled back after a few minutes. They stared at each other for a long time, not even so much as motioning to break the contact. Dean’s hands remained wrapped around Castiel’s lower back, and Castiel’s arms remained looped around Dean’s neck. After a moment, Dean leaned in and kissed Castiel. The shorter boy melted into the kiss.
“Of course,” Castiel obliged, wrapping his arms around Dean as they lay facing each other, foreheads touching. Dean closed his eyes for a while, allowing Castiel to gaze upon his boyfriend with unfiltered adoration. He was absolutely breathtaking with those long eyelashes, dusting of freckles, and goddamn perfect cheekbones. Castiel couldn’t be more in love if he tried.
“I’m sorry...It’s just- I didn’t- I forgot-” he stammered, his eyes finally settling on Dean. “I just remembered today is Dean’s birthday,” he admitted, going with the truth.
“I’ll join you,” Michael said, getting off of the couch and heading towards the door. Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He put on his shoes and followed after his brother.
“I was about to say the same thing,” he said softly. Cas yawned again and Dean scrunched his eyebrows together.
“What do you mean ‘today is hard for me’?” Castiel asked icily, narrowing his eyes at Dean. Wow, Dean was not good at handling these types of situations.
Jo leaned against the counter next to Charlie and said, “I can’t believe Balthazar isn’t bringing his new girlfriend.”
“No, he seemed pretty confident that Led Zeppelin is a shit band. No goddamn taste!” he declared, throwing his arms up as he stalked off. Luckily, Charlie didn’t chase him, because he couldn’t stop the smile that was creeping onto his face.
“Fuuuuck, Cas. You’re killin’ me here,” Dean said, itching to reach out and guide Cas where he wanted him.
Dean looks down and smiles. "You little shit." He says under his breath. He takes a breath and speaks louder. "No, nothing illegal today. I was thinking we could get out of here, road trip to Kansas?"
“You don’t like the way I eat?” Dean asked, changing their position on the couch so he was trapping Castiel against the seat cushions with his arms.
Dean reached over and rummaged through his nightstand. He came back with a triumphant smile; a small tube and a red package in his hand.
Castiel had only been joking when he sent the text. But he would admit the idea was enticing. There was a climbable tree outside of his bathroom window...as long as he was back before anyone came looking for him, it could work.
I'm sorry again that this took so long. I've been really busy, and if I'm honest, just not motivated enough to write. But I found some free time and decided to make the most of it.
The boys stared at each other for a long, weighted moment. Dean knew that Naomi wanted Cas to keep his mouth shut about her. Castiel knew that his father bribed him to lie about what happened last night. But neither knew the other knew what they knew.
her sticking around and working on their issues. As much as he didn’t want to admit it, this would be the second mother that...no. No, his biological mom didn’t
Cas woke up early the next morning and got ready for work. He noticed it was a little after six and thought about how Dean would be at work.
Cas pulled him close and hugged him tight. Dean hid his face in Cas's neck and just cried. He felt stupid, weeping about this when it happened almost twenty years ago.
“I like the way you think,” Dean said, attaching his lips to Cas’ neck. Castiel laughed and pushed Dean off of him before grabbing his hand and dragging him to the bedroom.
Dean presented them and Castiel fit the belt over them, pulling on the end to tighten the hold. Once it was snug, Castiel leaned forward and secured it to the headboard. He leaned back and took in the sight before him.
“Zachariah has been unjustly swamping me with intern level paperwork. It’s been causing problems for me.” Castiel informed the older man.
“I’m just trying to avoid giving away my money for a bet I didn’t even technically lose!” Gabriel shot back.
“You don’t know that. What if we had moved out to Chicago right after your father’s accident? What if all he saw was the fighting between us? We weren’t necessarily winning any awards for ‘functional family’ back then. He might’ve thought exactly what you’re thinking right now,” she reached out and put a hand on her son’s shoulder, “Dean, what Castiel needs right now is support. Not someone trying to tear his family apart even more.”
“Ok,” Dean said, “I’m sticky,” he announced, sitting up to head towards the bathroom. “Shower?” he asked. Castiel nodded and followed his boyfriend into the bathroom.
In the five minutes it took the race the the location, Dean had cleared his mind and set himself into 'fireman mode'. Years of training had made him able to snap in and out of diverse mindsets. When Dean was in the zone, he was the best damned fireman in the station, and everyone knew it.
"I knew there was something deeply wrong with you. You are a disgusting faggot," she spat out. "You are a disgrace to this family and I will not tolerate it," Naomi hissed. "I will teach you a lesson if it takes
“Thank you so much! I-I know you must think the worst things about me, but, Dean, I in no way wanted this for Castiel. I just, I want to help. In any way I can. I can drop off his stuff. His phone, his jacket, a pair of shoes, anything! I promise I won’t tell Naomi or anyone about it. I feel awful about last night. I should’ve-” she cut herself off. She took a deep breath, “just let me make it up to him,” she pleaded.
“What the fuck was that?” Gabriel asked, finally voicing what the rest of them (minus Balthazar) were thinking. “Is this a prank? Are you pranking us right now, because I gotta say...weird flex, you guys.”
Once the rush of guests had been served, Castiel left Ash alone to tend the ‘bar’. He made a lap around the house, feeling a sense of pride at his guests having a good time. He also laughed at all the costumes his peers showed up in. There were some couples-costumes and quite a few ‘slutty’ getups, but Castiel enjoyed them all the same. He loved the freedom of Halloween. He, himself had dressed up as a doctor after hearing about Dean’s little guilty pleasure. He spiced it up a bit by wearing booty-shorts instead of scrubs and forgoing a shirt altogether. Dean’s eyes had lit up brighter than Castiel had ever seen them when he showed him his costume before the party had officially started. The host had thought he was going to have to cancel the party with the way Dean was looking at him.
“I know. I’m so sorry, it was a horrible thing to say and I shouldn’t have said it. I really shouldn’t have even been at that party,” Castiel said, feeling worse about his actions by the minute.
“No. You think I let him say something about you. About my life choices,” Dean stated. Castiel closed his eyes. This isn’t exactly how he saw this conversation going.
“Looks like someone can’t hold his-” Gabriel’s taunt was interrupted with a hiccup, “liquor,” he finished confidently, ignoring the epiglottal malfunction. Dean stared him down and took his arms off of his coworkers. He pushed a finger into Gabriel’s chest, backing the man up against the wall.
Five uneventful hours later, Dean was on his way to Cas’s apartment. He shot off a warning text to Cas so he could let him in. When he arrived at Cas’s door, we was greeted with a deep kiss and pulled through a barren apartment to Cas’s bedroom. Dean quickly got rid of his shoes and discarded his uniform pants. Cas slid under the covers and pulled Dean with him to use as a pillow.
They cleaned up properly after that and fell into bed. Dean scooted up behind Cas to be the big spoon. Cas hugged the arm Dean threw over him.
“I thought you were going with her,” Castiel said, his heart beating faster as he imagined his entire plan crumbling around him. Was his father not going out of town as well? Cas could’ve sworn his father said something about a trip. Those beads of sweat were threatening to fall any second.
“Hands up,” Cas ordered. Dean smirked and raised his arms, but stopped before they were close enough to the headboard.
“Hey, look, if you need to leave, I understand. Don’t let her make you feel bad because you have a curfew. But, it would be cool if you could stay for a little while longer,” Dean mediated. Castiel almost stayed. Almost.
“Oh believe me, it wasn’t just for the bet,” Balthazar assured, “but I couldn’t continue after I knew you were in a relationship. And as for you all,” he addressed the room, “I didn’t tell you because I wanted to see you eat your words. The look on all of your faces when Dean was on one knee was absolutely
She grabbed the phone and stared at the lock screen. The passcode was a simple four-digit number. She raked her brain for anything Castiel might’ve told her that would hint at his passcode.
"Dean," he pants, "feels so good." Cas's moans drown out the pings of fat rain drops hitting the window. Dean removes his mouth and reaches over to the nightstand to grab the lube, Cas too far in his own bubble of pleasure to notice what Dean grabbed. Dean goes back and licks a long stripe up the underside of Cas's dick. Dean opens the lube and coats his index finger before circling Cas's entrance. Cas sucks in a breath and moans Dean's name when the taller man pushes in, mouth still wrapped around Cas's throbbing erection. He pulls off to focus his attention on opening up his boyfriend.
“I can’t believe this,” Castiel threw up his hands and let them fall noisily at his sides, “you’re saying that I have to act as your
“I could modify the tracking device in your phone so you can manipulate it no matter where you are. You could be in Japan, but your stepmom would think you were in your room,” he said.
“Cas,” Dean groaned, voice hoarse with both over use a few hours ago and lack of use during sleep. Cas just hummed a response.
Castiel cursed as he stood up and ripped the couch cushion back in search of his phone. He heard a soft thud and picked his phone up from where it had been unceremoniously tossed in his haste to find it.
Castiel stood up and stormed towards his office. The entire reason he was doing all that extra work was because he thought his
“You know your father and I can’t do all of the housework on our own. Not while working full time,” she said.
Dean nodded his head and agreed. “Who brings wine to a party? Are we in our mid-forties?” Dean mocked.
Those three little words flipped Castiel’s entire world upside down. He hadn’t had somebody say that to him since high school, and back then, Castiel never said it back. Dean loved him? His chest swelled and he squeezed Dean’s hand. Castiel breathed deeply, scent of freshly mowed grass filling his senses. He wanted to remember this moment.
“Why? Are you going to turn me in?” Castiel asked, a bit more on edge than when they started the conversation.
“He slept in the same bed as Balthazar last night,” Dean said. Charlie made a face displaying confusion mixed with humor.
“Dad,” Castiel said, finally joining in on the conversation. Michael leveled him a glare, warning him not to say exactly what he was about to say. “Remember earlier when I said it was just a friend who had texted me?” he asked. Michael shook his head.
The next few weeks flew by and many things changed. Dean's schedule being the most dramatic. Now, starting at 9, he had a much more reasonable sleep schedule, opening the doors for more quality time with Cas and the crew.
It was about a month into school and besides the fight with Naomi before the first day, Castiel’s senior year wasn’t going half bad. He did, of course, regret taking gym last period, but there was nothing he could do about that now. Often times, Dean would go pick up some food or snacks and bring them back to school to give to Cas after the final bell rang. That made Cas' days a little better. Other times, Dean would send snapchats of himself ‘taking a nap’ or tease Cas through text about how great early outs were. That made Cas' days a little...less better. He would usually respond with a snap of himself half dressed in the locker room with the caption ‘You wish you had gym class with me’ or a text with just the middle finger emoji repeated about ten times.
Castiel eyed the rest of the options and easily declared, “Balthazar.” The brit smiled at him, and his boyfriend threw him a glare. Castiel had to bite back a smile as Jo and Charlie whispered conspiratorially about who they would pick for their team.
“If you’re going to bed, at least don’t fall asleep in your costume,” Dean said, surprising Castiel. He picked his head up from the pillow and stared at Dean. After a moment, he pushed himself off the bed and walked up to his boyfriend.
“Dean, this is not up for debate. I’m telling you. Take Sam and go home. Try to get some sleep. I’ll call you if anything changes. Cas seems to be fine, and we should get the results soon. Now, go,” she commanded, thrusting the keys into Dean’s hand. He took them reluctantly and stormed off towards the parking lot, Sam scrambling to catch up.
decision? Why did he have to keep making life-changing choice after life-changing choice? When was all this bullshit going to end?
Castiel sat on his bed with his eyes closed. Not quite asleep, but not fully awake, either. He couldn’t use his phone because the screen hurt his eyes, and everyone had left to go do other things. As he awaited his CT results, he replayed last night over and over in his mind. He still wasn’t entirely convinced that it actually happened to him. Maybe it was a super long, hyper-realistic dream he was having. Or maybe it had been an episode of TV he watched.
“What is that?” Cas asked. Much to Cas’s confusion, Dean moved off of him and started dressing himself.
"Oh, sweetheart, what happened? Was it Naomi? Did you fight? Are you hurt? Have you eaten lately? I'm going to go make some soup, ok?" Mary asked in rapid succession. Castiel would've laughed if he wasn't so wound up. She left the room and hurried upstairs to make Castiel some comfort food. Dean kept Cas close, running a hand up and down his back.
“I love you, too,” he replied. At that, Castiel finally opened his eyes, a grin creeping onto his face to match Dean’s. He was so happy he could cry.
Dean gently rolls Cas onto his back as he slides on top of the dark haired man. Dean's left hand is trapped under Cas's shoulder and his right hand is sliding up to tangle in Cas's longer hair. They're mapping out each others' mouths and bodies like they've done so many times before. Dean loves that he gets to spend time alone with his boyfriend on a day like this. It reminds him of a Maroon 5 song (Sammy totally made him listen to it). Dean detaches his lips from Cas's and starts his descent on Cas's body. He trails kisses down his boyfriend's neck and chest, his hands roaming up and down Cas's body. He starts singing the song he was reminded of.
After that, they took a shot of that awful brandy and sat around trading birthday stories. It was actually pretty entertaining, and Dean found himself laughing at more than one of his coworker’s anecdotes. But, every time his eyes wandered to Castiel, he felt a twinge in his chest and had to force himself to look away.
“Great question! My team will place the stickers on the bottom of empty cups while your team’s backs are turned. You guys will fill the cups with liquid and mix them up as you go, but don’t cheat and check which ones have the stickers. You’ll turn around again as we mix them up a final time. Sound good?”
we were...sharing a bed, if you know what I mean. We also went to our fair share of parties. I was kind of a really bad kid."
Castiel’s dad, much to Naomi’s chagrin, allowed Castiel to go back to Chicago to watch Balthazar walk at graduation. Castiel didn't even cry...until Balthazar came over in his cap and gown and handed him a flower. Castiel did not have full control over his tear ducts at that moment.
“Holy, shit Deeeaaaannn. I’m gonna,” that was only warning Dean got before Cas was spilling down his throat. Dean milked him through it, catching every last bit of come on his tongue. Dean climbed up Cas’s body and gave him a searing kiss. Cas could taste himself on Dean’s lips and boy, did he wish his recuperation time was faster.
“You know very well mom makes us keep our doors open when we have company,” Dean said, annoyed at the invasion of his privacy.
behind,” she said, pointing an accusatory finger at her son. “Look, boys, I wasn’t born yesterday. The way you two look at each other and how you’ve been inseparable for the past month,” she said, eyebrows raised.
“Gwen. Please. You owe me a favor after last week’s you-know-what,” Mary said, giving Gwen a pointed look. The other nurse raised her hands in surrender.
They settled on ‘Deadpool’ because Castiel hadn’t seen it yet. Charlie went to the kitchen to pop some popcorn, which left Dean and Cas alone to sort out the seating arrangement. Unlike Dean’s basement, which had plenty of places to sit, Charlie’s den had only a love seat and an armchair.
“Castiel,” Dean said, clearly forcing his voice to remain steady as he pressed on, “You are the most incredible, intelligent, and inspiring person I have ever met. You have made me better in ways I can’t even describe. You already make me the truly happiest man on earth, and I can’t see myself with anyone but you,” a tear slipped out at this point, but Dean just kept talking, “will you marry me?”
“No, I don’t really know what that was. I’m fine now, really,” he said, “I’m going to go take a shower,” he added on, looking for an excuse to hide in his room again. He really did need a shower, anyway.
“Apparently, Balthazar has started seeing someone,” Castiel divulged. Dean had the presence of mind to look surprised.
“Hey, I’m here, aren’t I?” Dean asked as he threw himself on the couch, legs crossed with his arms behind his head.
“I’ve been gone for less than eight hours,” Castiel pointed out. “And to be fair, I stayed at Charlie’s so Balthazar wouldn’t find out we live together.”
“Holy shit,” Dean said, breaking the silence. Cas chuckled into his shoulder and positioned his arms underneath himself so he could get started cleaning them up. Dean raised his arms so Cas could slip out of them. He leaned down to plant a sweet kiss to his lover’s lips before grabbing his arms to free him from his restraints.
“So uh,” Cas started as Dean set him down, “are we...obligated to tell them about us? I’m not exactly looking for a repeat of St. Agnes.”
“Uh, nothing. The garage door opened. I'm pretty sure it's Naomi. I wasn't looking out the window when they pulled up so I'm not sure,” he said, glancing toward said window as if it would help now.
“Fine, I’ll stop calling him condom guy.” She smiled and punched his arm. “The team’s starting to notice your absence, so unless you want Meg catching you giggling at your phone like a school girl, I suggest you make an appearance.” Jo raised her eyebrows and turned on her heel to join the Dream Team in a lazy afternoon of channel surfing.
Today had been a particularly warm day, and Castiel had been craving something cold and sweet since lunch. He pulled out his phone and texted his boyfriend.
“Oh, there you are,” Naomi said as she entered the room. Castiel involuntarily recoiled into Anna’s arms. Dean stood up immediately and put himself between Naomi and his boyfriend. She wasn’t going anywhere
The family all joined hands and said grace as per Naomi’s wishes. Castiel didn’t utter a word, barely tolerating Naomi’s hand in his own. He made eye contact with Anna, who gave him a nervous, yet reassuring smile. They ate in relative ease, Castiel biding his time by filling his stomach. If he was about to be kicked out of his house, at least he wouldn’t go hungry.
a ‘flirty-face’, Cas”) and shot Gabe a wink. The shorter man’s expression was unreadable as Dean and Charlie grabbed their cookies.
"Is it five? Hmm..hey, I'm off in half an hour." She smiled and continued doing whatever it is she does on her computer all day. Dean scoffed and swiped the remote off of the coffee table. He clicked on the news and promptly dozed off.
“It’s not my fault Balthazar was being a smug bastard,” Dean defended, his hands returning to their comfortable place on his boyfriend’s ass.
“Alright,” Castiel said, smelling the alcohol on Dean’s breath, “I think somebody needs to go home.”
The woman swallowed thickly and bolted towards the school entrance. She practically ran up the stairs into Charlie’s classroom. She relayed the story in hysterics.
“Weelllllll,” Castiel joked, earning an indignant ‘hey’ from his friend. “No, I’m just excited. That’s all. I haven’t seen you since May.”
“Dean, if you don’t start fucking me right now I will be forced to lay you down and ride you for all you’re worth.”
“So it looks like you owe us some money, Mr. Kokopelli,” Jo said, sticking out her hand and making a grabbing motion.
“You’re perfect,” Castiel repeated. Dean stood up and kissed his boyfriend. “Now let’s take care of you,” Cas said, leading them towards the bedroom. After opening Dean up (
two to one, but usually way more. For a group of, let’s say ten people, there should be two or three cops. The way we’ve always played it is that you have a pretty limited area to play in. We usually use the park. You set up a ‘jail’ and a ‘safe house’. We’ve always used the tennis court as the jail and the merry-go-round as the safe house. Now, this game can be played in many different ways, so I’m just going to explain how we play it since you’ll be playing with us tonight.
“Since when do you have a wheelchair-bound brother?” Dean asked right back. Castiel shrugged as they continued to laugh.
“I was expecting something like Eugene or Maddox. Not…Ross.” Cas said. Dean laughed at the second name. Maddox? Where the hell did people come up with these names? After a while, Cas joined in with Dean’s laughter.
“Babe,” Dean said, muffled into the pillow, “you’re thinking too loud.” Castiel turned around in Dean’s arms.
“Hey, hey, calm down. I’ll pretend I don’t know about you two. I’ll even act like I don’t know he’s gay if you want me to,” Sam joked. He smiled to himself when he saw a bit of the tension dissipate from his boyfriend’s shoulders.
He got out of his car to examine his engine...as if he knew what the problem would be. He was an English teacher, not a mechanic. Still, he got out and popped his hood.
After two and a half movies, almost everyone had passed out. Castiel could be found sound asleep with his head resting on his couch buddy’s shoulder. He didn’t mean for it to happen, he just zonked out and ended up using Dean as a pillow. Charlie most definitely would have snapped a picture had she been able to stay awake long enough for it to happen. Soon enough, though, Castiel was nudged out of dreamland. He yawned ferociously as he stretched his arms above his head.
“You know I’m ticklish,” Castiel rumbled, his voice scratchy from disuse. He felt Dean’s smile as he ceased his movements. Dean pushed himself up onto his elbows and looked at his boyfriend.
the faculty slut,” Dean assured him, “and don’t tell me you don’t love everyone thinking you have a sexy mystery lover.”
They enjoyed the rest of the day almost constantly touching, stealing kisses and just being adorable.
"Right." Castiel stands there kind of awkwardly. He'd be lying if he said this Dean guy wasn't attractive. Now, being alone with him, his mind wanders to some very.....unlikely scenarios. "Don't do this to yourself" Castiel thinks. "He's probably straight anyway."
"I can't believe you carried me here. I can't believe I didn't wake up. Did you drug me or something? My head hurts." Cas said in rapid succession, not giving Dean a chance to answer. He coughed a few times, remembering why Dean had to carry him to his bed in the first place. Dean just smiled and looked at his puzzled boyfriend.
“This is the third night in a row you’ve told me you’ve gotten ‘held up’ somewhere,” Cas pointed out, using honest-to-god air quotes. He finally looked up at Dean, who resembled a deer in headlights. They stared at each other for a long moment. Finally, Castiel waved his arm in the direction of the chair in front of him.
“And then I hugged him, but he didn’t really hug back. Then he made up an excuse about finishing homework. He didn’t even invite me to go with him or anything, he just...left,” Dean recounted. Charlie chewed her lip, trying to think of any possible
Castiel sat at the dining table, the only light coming from the single bulb fixture overhead. The English teacher had spread a white cloth over the table, and two plates were set across from one another. The plate in front of Castiel was empty, the man having eaten without Dean. There were also two glasses of wine, and a single rose in a skinny vase.
“Oh, Castiel, could you take these downstairs?” she asked, more as a command than a question, but Castiel wasn’t going to be bothered tonight. He went over and grabbed the bags before lugging them down the stairs.
“Right,” he agreed. After what seemed like minutes, Castiel finally blinked and slid off the bed, scouring the floor for his discarded clothing. He picked up his shirt and grimaced, recognizing it as the piece of clothing they used to clean up their
“Cas, you're scaring me,” Dean said. Enraged blue eyes met terrified green ones. Castiel blinked once, twice, finally the anger seeped out in the form of tears.
me. Now do as I said or you won’t see that laptop for a week,” she threatened, walking towards the kitchen to undoubtedly do some cleaning. Castiel rolled his eyes and went to do as he was told.
After staying the night at Dean’s, Cas woke up to the smell of pancakes in the air. He slowly blinked open his eyes and breathed in deeply. His stomach growled and he pulled back the covers on the bed. He pulled on a clean pair of Dean’s sweatpants and wandered towards the intoxicating aroma. When he reached the kitchen, Dean had his back turned to Cas. The dark haired man looked him up and down, appreciating his fireman still dressed in his work clothes. He tiptoed up behind Dean and wrapped his arms around his waist. Dean jumped, but realized it was Cas quickly.
After a short moment, the two boys heard a timid knock on the door. They shared a look before Castiel rolled off the bed and swung it open.
“I was talking to this girl towards the end of my freshman year, Lisa Braeden. We were in that sorta-almost-dating range, but then she met this other guy and I guess they really hit it off, so she started going out with him. I was a little hurt, but I let it go. We weren’t
“Well, don’t be too nervous. You’re a delightful teacher. I’ve overheard some of my students talking about your class,” Balthazar assured his friend.
Balthazar scoffed, “Oh, please. We might be in a high school, but we don’t have to act like high schoolers,” he prodded further.
"The object of the game is to run out of cards. Ok, I’m going to deal the entire deck. You can look at your cards. We’ll go clockwise. You can only put cards down that are the same or a higher number of the previous card. So if I put down a three, Meg can put down a three or higher. If she puts down the same card as me, she skips Gabe. Everyone with me so far?"
"I'm not going!" He yelled, burrowing back into his covers. He heard the distinct footsteps of his step mother coming down the hallway. She burst into his room without even knocking.
“Shit, shit, shit! I-I followed the instructions! It’s not supposed to be an expensive fix!” Charlie defended, “Dean was just supposed to give him a ride! What have I done?”
Dean slid up behind Cas and wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s waist. He kissed the bare skin of Cas’ shoulder, traveling up to nip at his neck. Castiel let him, knowing that they would hardly be able look at each other that evening.
"Yeah, I want you to feel at home there. And I'm not around a lot, so I thought, hey why don't I just give you the key? So I got this one made and...yeah," Dean rambled.
Castiel had a few more tears slip down his cheeks throughout the speech. He wanted Dean. He wanted to forgive and forget and fall back into those forest green eyes. He wanted to kiss Dean until he couldn’t feel his lips anymore. He wanted to trace the freckles on his face into constellations. But he also felt like it couldn’t be that easy. His heart and his head were at war with each other, raging inside him, and he couldn’t get a word in edgewise. In a moment of courage, or of great stupidity, he grabbed Dean’s jacket and pulled him close, slotting his lips against Dean’s like he had a million times before. The war inside of him ceased and his heart and head could finally agree on one thing: this felt right.
Castiel sits alone, in the dark for about fifteen minutes. He hears muffled voices outside of the car. He hears the cop speak first.
Naomi entered the room, her hands full. Castiel looked between the items she was carrying and her face many times. She set the items on his desk and turned towards him.
“Maybe my dad and Naomi will let me visit over the summer,” Castiel said lightheartedly. It was a longshot, but weirder things have happened.
” Castiel all but shouted, “I was going to do it after I was done talking to Balthazar! It’s not like I was procrastinating out of spite!” he yelled.
“Oh, no need to call me ma'am. Any friend of my boys is a friend of mine. Call me Mary, please,” she said. Castiel nodded and went back to eating his food. “So did you meet Sam at school?” she asked.
The day went on and Cas cleaned the apartment to kill time. He had no idea what he was supposed to wear, so he threw on a pair of black jeans and navy blue shirt with an American flag on the chest. He was borrowing the shirt from Dean, of course. Cas slipped on a pair of black Nikes that looked like Vans. He plopped on the couch and awaited Balthazar's arrival. His blond friend was punctual, at least, and Cas was out of the apartment by five.
Everyone exited Cas’ room, and Dr. Andrews walked Naomi down the hall in the opposite direction of the rest of the visitors.
"That was a lovely meal. I'll wash the dishes while you give Aiden a bath." Cas suggested. Dean smiled and agreed before going after his rambunctious child.
“Alright, your father and I are catching the redeye out to New York city. I still can’t believe we didn’t leave this morning, but what’s done is done. You’re still expected to follow house rules and be back by your curfew if you go out. We’re putting a lot of trust in you with this. Your father just barely talked me out of calling Michael to come spend the weekend with you,” she said. Castiel’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t known that. He sent out a silent thank-you to his father.
“Don’t mock my pain,” Castiel groused, “it didn’t look like they were just good friends,” he sighed melodramatically.
“Here you go,” he offered it to his boyfriend. He leaned down and kissed Cas gently on the head before returning to his seat.
“Oh, so the school can call my dad or Naomi and then they send Michael out here to find out why I didn’t go to school? I don’t think so. Nothing is getting in the way of my party tomorrow night,” Balthazar put up his hands in defeat and let Castiel lead them up the stairs.
“And we need to listen and put ourselves in check without the fear of being yelled at by the other.” Cas finished.
“I love you,” Castiel whispered, keeping his eyes closed, almost afraid to see Dean’s reaction. If he would’ve opened his eyes, he would’ve seen Dean’s face break out into the biggest grin. Dean kissed him through the smile, running his hand through Castiel’s hair.
trying to beat out of his chest. He took the stairs one by one and eventually found himself in the kitchen.
Castiel had just three jackets these days. A trench coat, for when it was raining (and he’d been teased mercilessly for having it); a bomber jacket, one that he never would’ve bought himself, but his current boyfriend had picked it up for his 28th birthday last month; and finally, a denim jacket. He hadn’t worn that one in years; the memories it brought to him still on this edge of painful to justify taking it off the rack.
“God, yes, Dean. You always feel so good.” Cas answered. Dean picked up his pace, chasing the orgasm they both longed after. Dean shifted slightly within Cas and it felt like the goddamn planets were aligning. Cas cried out in pleasure and his orgasm took him for surprise. His chest was painted in thick ropes of his come.
The school had decided to dress the entire graduating class in black robes instead of their traditional “women in red, men in black”. That was the crowning achievement of one Charlie Bradbury. She beamed at them as they made their way back to her, and they chatted while they waited for the administration to get this show on the road. Dean also tied Castiel’s tie for him, teasing his boyfriend the entire time he was doing it.
"I forgive you." Cas said, smiling through his tears. Dean smiled, too letting out a huff of air that might have been a laugh had this not been so emotional. Dean doesn't do emotional too well. They hugged again, neither of them saying anything. Finally, Dean took Cas's hand and led him upstairs to their bedroom, where Cas set his watch carefully on the nightstand before stripping Dean and riding him until they were both too exhausted to move.
“Alright, Charlie. Let’s get this party started,” Gabriel said, standing up to pull a prompt from the bowl. He read it, nodded at his partner, and signaled that it was 3 words. Jo started the timer as soon as Gabriel started drawing.
Charlie was able to guess a whopping eleven words correctly, earning some serious smack talk from Gabriel towards Jo’s team.
“Uh, would you be more comfortable in an actual bed? I could take the couch for the night. Unless you’d feel more comfortable sleeping out here with everyone else, then I could just go use my own bed I guess,” Dean stumbled through his suggestion. Castiel was ready to just sleep on the floor if he had to, but then he remembered something.
“So, Dean who were you talking to after school?” Charlie asked, a teasing note in her voice. The teens swung their backpacks off their shoulders and unceremoniously tossed them by the dresser. Dean knew he was not going to enjoy the next five minutes of his life.
“And now I’m here,” Castiel finished, taking a deep breath. The room was silent for a few moments. Cas couldn’t stand the quiet, so he filled the silence himself.
He didn’t want to think about anything. Not his fight with Naomi, not his chat with his father, not the fact that he was being treated like a child, and
The last thing he remembered was saying goodbye to Cas before he left for work. He didn't know where he was, and his eyes refused to cooperate. Dean panicked. He could faintly hear an annoying beeping sound picking up its pace. He tried to move but he just couldn't.
The next day passed quickly, Castiel spending time with his dad and his brother during the day, then ringing in the New Year with the Winchesters that night. It was a great night filled with laughter and celebration; something Castiel didn’t think he would experience for a long time. It was a perfect night amidst all the chaos Cas’ life had been the past few months.
Except it was. Naomi walked towards him slowly, maintaining eye contact until she was standing right next to him. She roughly grabbed his wrist and pinned it to the table. He tried to resist, but he felt like he was in a dream. He wasn’t reacting fast enough to anything. Castiel looked quickly between the ruler and his hand. Naomi slowly raised her arm.
“I mean...you were the one that insisted on the pre-nup. It wouldn’t be too messy,” Bart said, trying desperately to keep the emotion out of his voice.
“Very. And do you ever sleep with a shirt on? Should I be jealous of the fire crew who are on shift with you?” Cas teased. Before Dean could answer, Cas snatched Dean’s hand and walked backwards through the kitchen and into the living room. Cas sat down and rested his left foot on the coffee table. Dean laid down with his head in Cas’s lap.
I hope you enjoyed this piece as much as I enjoyed writing it. Be on the look out for my high school au that's in the works. Follow me on tumblr (satansass666)
They had both started the day in nice, clean suits, but as the day wore on, they became more and more disheveled. Their jackets were the first to be discarded, stopping only when their sleeves had been rolled up and Dean’s tie somehow ended up around his head. The couple was lying on the hammock Bartholomew had insisted on getting the first weekend they had at the house. Castiel was skeptical about the piece of outdoor furniture, but after actually trying it out, he had to say his father was right.
The teen’s leg bounced up and down at a rapid pace and Dean wasn’t sure if God himself could stop it. He hadn’t heard from Cas since early that morning. He knew that Cas had probably turned his phone on Do Not Disturb, or even
Cas stood up from the table and scraped the remainder of his food into the trash. He filled up the sink and started washing the dishes. As he scrubbed off the stains, he thought about what was really making him upset. By the time the last dish found its way to the drying rack, Castiel had his answer.
“Alright, so basically the point of this game is to get an oreo from your forehead into your mouth without using your hands. Since there’s six of us, we’ll do three head-to-heads, then a semi-final of those three winners, then a championship match between the remaining two. Sound good?”
“Uhh...rainbow? Arch?” she guessed. Gabe shook his head, drew another arrow going under the box, then crossed it out, and went back to draw the arch from left to right again.
“I really can’t. I have to get back to...where I’m staying,” he said, stopping himself before he said Dean’s name.
“Balthazar would have your head for an accent as terrible as that one,” Castiel commented. The three teens sat in silence as each of them took in what Cas had just said. “Oh fuck,” Cas said under his breath.
“Oh,” he said, grabbing the glass and taking one small, apprehensive sip before going back in for a much larger gulp. He gave her the (nearly empty) glass back, looking around to see if Naomi or one of her awful relatives had noticed the underaged drinking. She chuckled at him.
“It could be after the meeting. A lot of the teachers stick around to socialize a bit before leaving for the weekend. And there is a chance Charlie will want at least one of us to hang back anyway,” Castiel said.
“I just find hair bands dull and repetitive,” Castiel said, an air of pompous nonchalance about him. Dean scoffed.
“I’m glad someone around here is getting some action. Small towns are not for the bachelor,” he lamented. “So who’s the lucky lover, and where did you meet them, because I’m getting desperate.”
“Technically, no. They’ll figure out tomorrow whether or not it goes to trial,” Sam explained. Dean furrowed his eyebrows.
"How are you this peppy at five in the goddamned morning?" He asked her. She pushed her thick, black frame glasses farther up her nose and combed a piece of her fiery red hair behind her ear.
Castiel wakes up on a lazy Sunday morning; the soft patter of rain splashing the windows. It's darker than normal, but this lighting just seems to make Dean even more breath-taking. Cas smiles and admires the man sleeping next to him, noticing all of the freckles that stand out in the dim lighting. The white sheets are a perfect contrast to his tanned body, intensifying his natural beauty.
“Some bloke in a shirt with the sleeves cut off is here. He’s got quite the selection of alcohol,” Balthazar yelled from the entryway.
“Dean, I don’t know why I said that. I don’t...I don’t want to break up. I love you, too. I don’t know why I said that.”
After a rather large helping of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, he placed his bowl into the dishwasher and decided to do some research on new and developing fire equipment.
Shit. Dean was hoping he wouldn't be asked that. The truth is, he doesn't know why he blurted out his real name. He was too distracted by everything 'Castiel'. Ok, that sounded dumb. So, Dean does what he does best. He lies.
“I have my ways,” Cas answered mysteriously. Dean just gave him a look. “It’s called an address book, Sherlock.” Cas deadpanned. “Why don’t we watch a movie? And did you know you look adorable all sleepy and disgruntled?” Cas asked.
"He was a good sport about it," Dean said, words muffled by his hands. He sat up and sighed. "He pushed me back and gently let me down. But he helped me figure out that I could like guys as well as girls. In a way, he helped me discover myself. I know that sounds dumb but I don't know how else to explain it," Dean said.
He slumped on the couch, folded his arms and closed his eyes. That’s when a particularly nosy coworker joined him.
The next day at work, while Dean was deep in the engine of a '68 Chevy, he heard footsteps walking towards him. He extracted himself from his work to see who was approaching him. A perky red head was walking his way with a devilish smile on her face.
Out of nowhere, a pack of men in summing trunks picked up Castiel and carried him out to the dock. Cas practically shrieked in horror when he realized what was about to happen. The men were shouting and gaining a lot of attention. By the time they had Cas at the end of the dock, everyone outside had stopped what they were doing to find out what was going on. Before Cas could take a breath, he was being thrown into the lake. He sputtered his way to the surface to be greeted by uproarious cheers. The men that threw him in were now jumping in as well. He paddled through the traffic and over to the shore before dragging himself over to Balthazar.
Charlie opened and closed her mouth, hesitating as she thought of how to respond. Then, with the most sincere tone Dean had heard her use since he met her, she responded, “It’s a small school...I just think it would be easier if we all got along, ya know?”
“It’s going to be expensive? I-I don’t have the money right now,” Castiel made his voice quiver as he choked out, “My student loans are piling up, and I-I just told my brother I’d help him out to have that knee surgery that would finally get him out of that wheelchair. I guess I have to call him back and tell him I can’t help anymore,” he lamented. Dean thought Cas was laying it on a little too thick, but one look at Jo told him that she was eating up his totally bogus story.
"Er, probably not. I myself won't know too many people. Just stick by me and we'll have a good time," Balthazar said with a smile. Cas grew a little worried about this. He hated going places where he only knew Balthazar. The blond would always leave him stranded so he could go catch some tail. Cas shrugged and decided to just go with whatever the night threw at him.
“What? You’re not happy to hear from me?” Charlie quipped on the other line, “I’m hurt, Dean.” Dean just rolled his eyes.
“It means that...I don’t like the way you’ve been acting around Naomi,” she clarified. She’d been meaning to have this conversation with him for some time now, but she could never bring herself to approach the topic.
“Dean, please, it’s not like that. I just want to know he’s safe. You don’t even have to tell me where he is,” she waited a long moment before he replied.
When Dean returned home Tuesday morning, he called Cas, disregarding the early hour. It rang for a long time before a disoriented voice came through.
“Hey!” Dean barked, “he’s telling you what happened, asshole,” he said sharply, squaring his shoulders.
“As a matter of fact, I have. Here, let me show you a picture,” he said, pulling out his phone. On the screen was a beautiful redhead smiling at the camera. She was wearing a salmon cardigan and she had pushed back some of her hair behind her ear.
“Gabriel!” Charlie complained. They all clinked glasses and swallowed down the liquid, many of them wincing and gagging at the taste.
“Didn’t look like ‘no one’,” she teased, resting her elbow on the back of the couch and her head in her hand. Castiel blushed slightly, and looked down at his phone to try and conceal it.
, and right after that, the sound of bedsprings announced to him that the couple had decided to move their ‘conversation’ to the bed. Castiel decided to stop trying to listen to what was going on behind that door.
Once Dean was satisfied he pulled back and asked Cas, “How do you want to do it?” The English teacher blushed and looked off to the side. Dean caught his cheek and returned his attention to those green eyes. “Don’t get shy with me.”
His last class of the day was computer science. Castiel was actually looking forward to this elective. He knew next to nothing about the inner-workings of computers and he was eager to learn.
Castiel feared for the rubber left on Dean’s tires as they peeled into the parking lot. They ran into the school and met up with their fellow graduates where they were all gathered in the library.
“Um, am I supposed to take these off at the door?” he asked self-consciously, noticing Charlie was only wearing socks.
He returned to the bedroom to put on his work clothes, but couldn’t find any black socks. He knew they needed to do laundry, but he was
“Thanks,” Castiel said, looking up at her. When Mary turned to look at the boy, she saw genuine gratitude. After the last dish was dry, Castiel returned downstairs.
“So you’re saying I should earn my keep?” Castiel paraphrased. Naomi blinked a few times. Was her step-son finally seeing things her way? Maybe this whole parenting thing wasn’t that hard after all.
“Tell me why we signed up for this class,” Dean said as he laid his head down on his closed textbook in defeat.
built for sleeping on. He made his way to the bedroom situated off the den. He knocked lightly and opened the door to find that nobody was inside. Confused, Castiel returned to the couches.
He entered the kitchen and Mary pointed out which cabinet the bowl was in. Sam was in there as well, peeling and mashing the bananas. Dean ruffled his little brother’s hair, earning an indignant ‘hey’ before reaching up and grabbing the bowl. He only had to go up on his toes slightly to reach it.
And there you have it, a piece set on the 4th of July posted on the 4th of July. By the way, my favorite pitch is the curve ball ;)
“Huh,” Dean replied, checking over what the problem might be. He spotted it pretty quickly; someone had removed Castiel’s spark plugs. And by someone, he had a pretty good suspicion that it was either Jo or Charlie. Had they really resorted to car trouble?
“Jesus, Sam! We need to get you a bell,” Sam brushed off the comment and waltzed into Dean’s room like he owned the place. He had a shit-eating grin on his face.
,” he disclosed, reaching over to Dean’s lap. He took the edge of the blanket and moved it over so both their lower halves were covered.
“Balthazar. Where did you go?” Castiel’s eyebrows stitched together. “What? Why?” Charlie observed as he put a hand on his hip and started pacing between the couch and the ping-pong table. “No I-” he stopped at the table and started absently gathering cups to be put in the trash. “I never said you had to-” Castiel rolled his eyes and gave an annoyed look to Charlie. “Yeah, whatever. Safe travels. Goodbye,” he hung up and tossed his phone harshly on the ping-pong table.
So, God help him, he left his own bedroom and the small, open den on the top floor accessible for anyone to use. He was definitely going to have to burn his bedsheets tomorrow, but that was a problem for future-Cas.
“You’re not even a little bit concerned about where he is all the time? Maybe that’s why he didn’t have time to study,” Naomi pointed out.
The text was sent with an image of a pouting Dean, holding up his middle finger on the hand with the cast.
Anna awoke early Christmas morning. Usually, she’d be jumping out of bed, waking the house up with exclaims of
“Oh please tell me I don’t have to be around for that,” Castiel begged. ‘Abby’ was Naomi’s sister. Her full name was Abaddon, and she sure as hell lived up to the reputation that came with that name. Naomi gave him a stern look.
He switched modes and went over to help with the hoses. After the fire was officially put out, Dean was dying to get to the hospital. Gabe drove the remaining crew back to the station where Dean stripped in record time and raced to his baby. He fired her up and drive to the hospital.
“Ahh, pining at its finest,” Castiel protested against the statement but Balthazar just kept talking, “I haven't seen that look on your face since…” He trailed off, not wanting to open that can of worms unless Castiel was prepared for it.
of my girlfriend,” Dean joked. Castiel pulled himself out of Dean’s grip and went to open his car door again.
“Yeah, but I guess he and Naomi got into another argument and she took away his phone,” Dean told Alfie. The boy in the backseat let out a long breath.
“Hello, I'm Mr. Shurley,” he said, “Welcome to Lawrence High. The material we're covering in class is built on the previous units. I'll help you catch up as much as I can, but if you need additional instruction, you can ask Ash here,” he informed Castiel, clapping Ash’s shoulder twice. The kid smiled back at him and gave him the ‘rock on’ hand sign.
“So? We don’t have to stay late. Just some dinner and a couple of drinks. I’ll have you home by ten at the latest,” Charlie pleaded. Cas sighed as he sent the email and closed his laptop.
"Funny you say that," Cas said ominously. Dean took his eyes off the screen to peer at Cas questioningly. "What's that supposed to mean?" Dean asked as he returned his eyes to the screen. At that moment, all Dean could see was a flash of blue.
When Cas came back, he returned to sharing the blanket with his boyfriend. Dean reached under the quilt, positioning his hand right above Cas' crotch. When Dean placed his hand firmly on Cas' inner thigh, the shorter boy jumped slightly.
“What?” Castiel asked curtly. He had other classes to go to. There was a voice in his head telling him that he wasn’t being fair to Dean, but he ignored it. He raised his eyebrows, signalling Dean to ask his question that was so important.
Somehow, he made it up to his apartment and pulled out his phone. He sent a text to Castiel, but he wasn’t entirely sure what it said. That was a problem for Future Dean.
“Growing up, I was taught that misbehavior earned disciplinary action. It’s about time you learned a lesson,”  Naomi said sternly. Castiel took a step back. Sure, he’d been threatened with the ruler before, but it was never this serious. She had never actually been holding one.
"Dean?" He inquired, straining his ear for a reply. After a few moments, the door swung open revealing a very wrung out-looking Dean.
“Give me a moment, I feel...stale,” he replied, wetting his toothbrush before squeezing out some toothpaste and sticking his toothbrush in his mouth.
Dean salted his fries a bit more before he started working on those. Charlie snagged one off his plate before continuing her story about...wizards? Dean really needed to start paying attention.
Sure, he’d had sex before. He had even cuddled with Balthazar in the aftermath a few times. But never had Castiel felt like this before.
"Mmmm, Dean," Cas moaned, opening his eyes slowly. Dean detached from his boyfriend's neck and placed his lips to Cas's.
“If you’re accusing me of striking that boy, you better think twice. You said the doctors haven’t told you anything. Did Castiel tell
Dean deflated at those words. Did they really just come out of his own boyfriend’s mouth? Sure, he’d expect that kind of jab from one of the drunk idiots in the living room but from his
“Hey, don’t do that. I don’t tell a lot of people I’m rich. It makes them act weird around me.” Cas smiled and rubbed Dean’s back with his good hand. Dean looked up and smiled.
"Nothing. It's nothing. Just...forgot what I needed to pick up at the store later." Dean replied. Charlie was having none of it.
"My brother and I found this a while back. It's come in handy more than a few times." Dean pats the wall affectionately while talking. Castiel continues to look around. There's an actual bed in the far left corner. To the right is a couch, and a small bookshelf sits near the corner. To the left is a circular wooden table with an abandoned deck of cards collecting dust on top of it.
Dean came first with a long, noisy groan. Cas soon followed him, making an utter mess between them. He sunk, boneless on Dean’s chest.
“Never mind, I’m going to sleep. I don’t want to talk about it, Jo, so don’t ask. Don’t wake me up unless it’s for work.” Dean said. He exited the room and went to bed.
“Now go. Can’t have you getting grounded over this,” Dean mumbled, removing his arm from around Cas' waist and burrowing back under the covers. He never was much of a morning person.
“I’ve been worried sick about you,” she went on, “you can’t just run off like that,” she looked skeptically at the teen standing between her and her step-son. Through years of practice, she was able to keep the malice out of her voice when she guessed, “You must be Dean.” Although, no amount of practice could keep all of the hatred out of her eyes.
When he did, Castiel could see stars. He let out a loud moan, his breath hitching and becoming more ragged by the second. Dean kept pounding in at that angle, Castiel powerless to stop him. Dean nuzzled into his neck and nipped at the sensitive skin.
“Dean, alcohol is not appropriate to consume on the clock, especially around minors,” Garth interjected. Dean rolled his eyes towards Jo as the guidance counselor was behind his back.
On his drive home, he was seething. He was muttering every cuss word he knew. His knuckles were white as they gripped the steering wheel. He didn’t need that from Dean. Didn’t he realize how stressed Cas was? Couldn’t he see Cas had had enough demands? Didn’t he know how overbearing Zachariah was?
"You're....you're wearing entirely...ah... entirely too much clothing." Cas says between kisses as he undoes Dean's belt and fly. Dean gets up on his knees and shucks the rest of his clothes, pulling Cas's jeans and underwear off as well.
”) when he felt Cas pull away, opening his eyes when he felt Cas shift on the bed. The man was reaching for the nightstand to grab supplies. He threw the bottle of lube onto the sheets.
“Harder.” Castiel commanded. Dean gave a devilish smile and obliged Cas. He slammed into him which each thrust, bringing both of them closer to their climax.
It felt like Castiel had been slapped across the face. She just insulted him as well as his dead mother. And Bartholomew was just standing there! He clenched his fists by his sides and took two large steps towards her.
“This. Us. My family. Is this...all of this...something you want? Because I want you in my life...my entire life, including my boys. But I can’t put them in harm’s way again. If you don’t want
“Look, Cas, I don’t have time right now.” He said before turning back and pushing his cart towards checkout, last items be damned.
Was it necessary for him to wear slacks and a button-up every time? He didn't even believe in the teachings of the church, for Christ's sake! Why should he be forced to wear uncomfortable clothing to attend a mass he didn't want to be at?
She wondered what Cas meant by that. What room did Dean go into? Why was he going into a room with Amara? Dean hadn’t told Charlie about anything to do with Amara. All Charlie knew was that Dean had come upstairs to find Castiel, and did so while the host was dancing with his friend.
half of the time. What was his alternative? He knew teenagers were a handful, and it was easier - more
He tidied up his desk and collected his things. He was out the door and on his way to the grocery store at an impressive 4:30 p.m.
He was surprised when a folded piece of scrap paper landed on his desk. He discreetly unfolded it and read the message on the inside.
“Don’t,” she warned sharply. The couple sat in the car for a long stretch of silence before Bart spoke up again.
Dean laughed and shook his head, “yeah that’s not really much of an answer, babe.” Castiel laughed on the other end of the line and Dean almost cried. He’d been so stressed about Cas all day, now hearing him laugh was like the sweetest music to his ears.
“Thanks for telling me that,” Castiel said, leaning in and giving Dean a quick kiss on the lips. Dean smiled sadly. “For what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re naive or dumb or anything remotely like that. I think you were being vulnerable with someone, and she was the one that fucked it up. It doesn’t make you weak or stupid. If anything, it just proves how great
Dean was still mad at Castiel. He was mad at him for blowing him off at school, for arguing with him when he was just trying to help, for bringing up his dad around drunk teenagers.
wonder of the world.” Dean’s jaw dropped in mock-offense. Castiel kissed the offended look right off Dean’s face. Castiel removed his boyfriend’s boxers and took Dean in his hand and pumped a few times, causing Dean to moan into his mouth. And
Dean, taking the very heavy hint Castiel was dropping, turned around and shut the lights off on his way out of Castiel’s room.
"Don't say that. I'll always want to see you. As for getting me sick, I don't think it'll work since we spent an entire day wrapped around each other and I'm perfectly fine. I'm actually probably the one who got you sick."
“Oh, um...we met when I was a kindergartener in Chicago. We were best friends until I moved here,” he answered, returning his attention to the problem he was solving.
When the apartment was spotless, Cas went about setting up his grand apology. He just needed to be sure to keep a watchful eye on the clock. He couldn’t be here when Dean got home. At least, not right away. He stuck the first phase of his plan to the outside of Dean’s door and left, checking his watch.
“You don’t think Michael would’ve rather spent time with his friends than studying for that test?” his father speculated. Of course, Castiel remembered Michael commandeering the kitchen table that week, but Cas just thought his brother was taking it seriously himself. He didn’t know Naomi was breathing down his neck.
“I meant why have you two been fighting so much lately?” Bartholomew clarified. Castiel folded his arms over his chest.
Castiel shook his head and took another sip of his drink when his boyfriend sneered something at Gabriel about overcompensation.
"You little shit," Dean said, setting his own controller down after finishing 5th thanks to the untimely attack.
“What?” He said, failing to keep most of the venom out of his voice. Her eyebrows shot up at the tone in her stepson’s response.
"I might have seen him loitering around here once or twice," Dean said in response to Cas's question.
Castiel felt glued to the floor as Amara stood up and grabbed Dean’s hand to lead him to the private room for seven whole, unsupervised, pitch-black, steamy minutes. He couldn’t tear his eyes away if he tried. Right before he was through the threshold of the bedroom, Dean had caught Castiel’s eye. A multitude of emotions, ranging from confusion to guilt, passed through the cowboy before his line of sight was cut off. Suddenly, Castiel regained the power to use his legs and they carried him upstairs faster than he could even process what he’d seen.
“Let me walk you to your car,” he offered. They exited his room and made their way outside. Before Castiel could climb into his car, Dean enveloped him in a hug that lasted many long seconds. Castiel put his arms around Dean’s neck as he pulled back slightly. They stood like that for a long moment.
“I’m afraid you can’t,” she told him, “he’s giving his statement about the incident, and then he’ll need to sort things out with his family. We can come back tomorrow, ok? He’ll have to stay here for a little while while they monitor his injury. He’ll be fine here, Dean. Let’s go home, ok?”
“Alright,” said Jo, “and we pick Dean and Castiel.” The couple looked at each other, unsurprised at the other team’s choice.
Castiel smiled lazily up at him. He looked perfect. Sweat accumulating on his skin, almost shimmering in the light of the setting sun. Castiel could die a happy man. Dean leaned down and kissed Castiel for several long moments. When the feeling returned to Castiel’s fingers and toes, he pushed Dean’s shoulder, rolling him onto his back.
“I was probably down by the river,” Castiel said, hoping his brother’s jogging route didn’t go too close to the river running along the back of the neighborhood. Naomi seemed to think over Cas' answer.
“Oh, is it...not...a girl? I don’t know I just kind of assumed,” Dean brushed off, busying himself around the kitchen.
“Ok. I suppose I can go...grab some breakfast,” he suggested to himself. Before he left, he put his hand on his son’s shoulder and said, “I’m here now, Castiel. Everything’s gonna be ok.”
All too soon, Dean pulled off, shifting so he could remove his own pants which were now becoming uncomfortably tight. Once freed, he returned to Castiel’s lips, kissing them slow as he reached around for the lube he’d tossed on the bed. He located it and coated his fingers, never removing his lips from Castiel.
It was too much for Castiel to handle. He told Joseph he needed to use the restroom, and started making his way off of the dance floor. Joseph was too drunk to really comprehend what was happening. The chorus repeated and Castiel could feel eyes on his back as he ducked out of the front door. He fumbled in his pocket for his pack of cigarettes. He lit one and took the first shaky draw. Smoke rushed out of his nostrils and he took a deep breath of the cold air.
“We’ll have to call Michael to come stay with you while we travel next time. I’m sure you don’t want to be babysat by your older brother, so I suggest you make the right choices,” she advised. Castiel nodded at her response. He was not going to risk misbehaving this weekend. Then he remembered the plans he made with Dean.
They stayed like that, pressed together from head to toe, for a few long moments. They caught their breath and let themselves sit in the feeling of utter satisfaction.
“I’m fashionably late,” she said with a smile before putting the car in gear and heading downtown. Their first stop was an old school arcade.
"Cut the crap. You know what I'm talking about. How do you make me talk about stuff without me registering it?" Charlie just smiled at him.
“It’ll be a pretty casual game night,” she reiterated. Dean swayed his head this way and that, tugging at Charlie’s heartstrings as he made a decision.
“Yeah, that’s why they’re gone all the time...not really lookin’ to get into that,” Castiel said with a laugh.
As Balthazar told Cas about his journey (that may have involved briefly watching a high-speed chase on the outskirts of Chicago), they walked towards the backside of Cas' house. When they approached the back patio, Balthazar let out a short whistle.
“So…” Dean started, grabbing his head to process all the new information. Boy, if the world wasn’t spinning before, “she wasn’t fired for dating a staff member?”
“But that didn’t give me the right to act like that,” Dean reputed. Castiel was silent for a moment.
“Oh,” Dean realized, “I tried to talk to him this morning and I grabbed his arm to make him stay in the room with me. Then I literally said the word ‘control’, Jesus Christ,” Dean said. He laughed at how wrong he went about that conversation.
He leaned down and started kissing Cas’ chest; down, down, to the button of his jeans. Dean zipped the pants open and pulled Cas out of the slit in his boxers. He pumped him a few times, making cheeky eye contact. The blue eyed man rolled his eyes, half annoyance, half ecstasy. Dean smiled as his boyfriend let out a moan, and leaned down further to lick a long stripe up the underside of Cas’ cock. When he got to the tip, he flicked his tongue over the slit a few times, relishing the breathy sounds this evoked from Cas.
“I mean...I guess? At least with Naomi. She’s a nightmare,” Castiel said. He blinked and realized what he’d just said. Since when did he freely discuss his relationship with Naomi? He had
Castiel rolled his eyes, “you act like he’s some sort of serial-dater. To the best of my knowledge, he’s been single the entire time we’ve been here.” Dean shrugged and continued cooking.
“I don’t get parents like that,” Charlie judged, “they’d rather have their kid driving out at a dangerous time than let them stay the night where they know they’ll be safe."
“Dean,” Cas whimpered, head thrown back against the headboard. Dean wasted no time, grabbing Castiel’s cock and licking one long, slow stripe up the underside before sucking at the tip, causing the man above him to let out a deep moan. The noises only encouraged Dean, who took Cas in deeper, bobbing his head as he moved up and down. His hand pumped what wasn’t in his mouth as he set a steady rhythm, slowing down every once in a while to pay attention to the tip and flick his tongue teasingly over Cas’ leaking slit.
“What? All it is is how much you fuckin’ missed Cas! Almost every damn song on this album is you cryin’ over him,” Benny stated. Dean just rolled his eyes.
mad at him, Bartholomew could still use the physical reassurance. And if Castiel was being honest with himself, he could use it, too.
“And? What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?” she replied. It was Dean’s turn to be confused.
“Well, we can’t let her win. She’s probably going to try a bunch of little things to push us together. Ten bucks of my own says we get placed on the same team for game night,” Dean said.
Dean slipped his tongue in and Castiel let him. His lips were cold, but his cheeks were flaming hot. He knew Charlie and Sam were out there somewhere, and while he would never complain about making out with Dean, he could still feel a
Mary leveled a glare laced with fondness. She wouldn’t outright agree with her son calling himself an idiot...but he was a seventeen-year-old boy.
“I’m so sorry. I shouldn't be putting Sam and Dean through all th-” Castiel’s apology was cut short.
“Yes, I figured as much seeing as you are both men and you are in a relationship,” Balthazar responded after it was clear Dean was waiting for a reply.
"Hey Aiden, can you answer that for me?" Dean called from the other room, knowing who was at the door.
“Jo, I formally introduce you to Cas.” Dean said. Jo grinned wide and blew past Cas’s outstretched hand to envelop him in a hug. Cas awkwardly returned it after a beat.
Joseph led Castiel by the hand to the dance floor. The band was just about to play their opening song. The lights came up on the stage and Castiel couldn’t believe his eyes. On the drum was the familiar name
do correctly off his neck and held it in his hands. When he looked up, Dean was naked save for his underwear. At his boyfriend’s confused head tilt, Castiel raised the silk.
He was warm. He was comfortable. His boyfriend was practically fused to his side. What cruel world would take him from this paradise? Ah, yes. The wonderful world of firefighting.
“Not even a single cut-out of Shakespeare?” a british voice asked from the doorway. Castiel immediately stopped humming and whipped his head towards the door.
“When Jody brought in those donuts,” she prompted, “you both reached for the last plain glazed and he totally let you have it!”
And as cheesy as Cas knew this was, he still looked up. He smiled at his reflection and looked back down at the note. His cheeks turned a little red when he remembered Charlie was standing right behind him.
? Even if she didn’t lay another hand on him, the sheer tension alone would drive him crazy. He couldn’t go back to that house so long as Naomi lived there.
As soon as Castiel shut the front door to their apartment, Dean was on him. Castiel didn’t even get to say hello before his mouth was downright assaulted. The english teacher didn’t mind; however, he rather enjoyed this welcome party.
“Dean Winchester what the hell was that?” she started. Dean kicked the couch on the far wall before sitting on it and putting his head in his hands. He ran his fingers through his short hair and looked up at his friend, fire in his eyes.
“And how do you think you’re making him feel now, attacking his dad like that?” she reasoned. Dean clenched his jaw and looked down at the ground. “Honey, I know you’re protective, but this is Castiel’s family. They’re gonna have to sort it out on their terms.”
She loved Castiel dearly already, and she wanted to stay in his life. But, after what Michael had demonstrated about his own character, she wasn’t on very solid footing about their relationship. She did love Michael; at least, the Michael that wasn’t around Naomi. Whether he knew it or not, the elder Novak son was running out of time to prove to Anna that he was worth sticking around for.
“He...I’m just trying to say...are you sure he’s the one you want to be with? For Christ’s sake, he punched me!”
“Let me tell my story,” Cas said, smile breaking through his fake pout. Dean wanted nothing more than to kiss those beautiful lips, but Castiel resumed speaking before he got the chance.
“Y-yeah! Anna. She’s my brother’s girlfriend, she could get the insurance card or whatever and...yeah.”
required to attend dinner tonight,” she said, leaving no room for argument, “you will also be presentable. Go upstairs and shower. And get a comb through that hair,” she instructed.
A few months passed with only some minor scuffles with Naomi. Castiel hadn’t gotten any privileges taken away in those few months (but he might’ve gotten confined to the house for a night or two). That wouldn’t get Cas' spirits down, though. It was finally October and Halloween was quickly approaching.
She silently tiptoed her way past Naomi and Bartholomew’s bedroom to Castiel’s. After gently closing the door behind her, she flicked on the lights. Flinching at their brightness, she walked towards the bed. She noticed a phone sitting on the covers.
Dean served the food and they all dug in, enjoying their first meal together in a month. Aiden chattered away excitedly the whole time, asking Cas questions as well as telling him an abundance of stories. When they were finished, it was about eight o'clock.
“Baby, wha’ happened?” he slurred. Castiel wiped at his eyes quickly. He wasn’t fully aware he’d been crying.
“He’s...not here,” he told Charlie, nothing but confusion on his face. “He wasn’t supposed to leave until this afternoon. He was going to help me straighten out the house and then I was going to buy him lunch and we were going to hang out and talk and catch up and
have been? Sure enough, Castiel was taking notes like the straight-A student he was. After the teacher was finished with her lecture, she announced that there would be no homework. A few kids verbalized their approval and others gave audible sighs of relief. Dean turned to Castiel and caught a glimpse of the text conversation he was having with ‘Balthazar’.
“I’m never leaving this couch,” Cas said before flipping his head to face the back of the couch. Dean laughed and left the apartment with a spring in his step.
A week later, and Dean was settled in at home. He had the joy of wearing a cast running past his elbow on his right arm, and a boot for his fractured leg on the left. He currently sat on the couch, leg propped up on the coffee table. He had roped Cas into playing Mario Kart with him.
“Um, you’ve got a…” Dean motioned to a spot near Cas’s eye. Cas wiped at it but he didn’t manage to swipe away the eyelash that was stuck to his cheek. “Let me.” Dean held Cas’s face in his hands and gently swiped the eyelash away.
Instead of returning to kissing, like Castiel had anticipated, Dean sprawled out over Cas and pillowed his head on Cas' chest. He snaked his arms around Castiel and kissed his sternum before lying his head down. Castiel laughed and wrapped his arms around Dean. He shifted his lower body until they were both comfortable and he kissed the top of Dean’s head.
“You gonna come just like this, baby?” Dean asked, his thrusts getting deeper and more forceful. Castiel couldn’t string together a sentence if he tried. Instead, he forfeited himself over to the sensations, feeling that familiar tight heat coil in his belly. Dean could tell he was getting close, refusing to give up the pace for even a moment.
“Castiel,” Bartholomew started in a slightly condescending tone. The teen didn’t let him get any further.
Charlie passed off the phone to Balthazar, and the other team took their places. Dean seemed a bit less upset, having had two and half beers now. Together, he and Jo were able to have the brit guess nine words. Dean was more animated this round...at least in his body. They weren’t allowed to talk this round, so he really needed to be physical. He kept a facade of almost boredom...something Castiel liked to label his “grumpy face”. Cas knew Dean was actually enjoying this game, he just wouldn’t show it.
“But then I wouldn’t get to run my hands all over this gorgeous body,” Dean complained, rubbing Cas’ waist as he tightened his hold on the man.
True to the estimate, Balthazar arrived about 40 minutes later and parked his car down by the park like Castiel had instructed him. When they met on the basketball court, Cas practically tackled Balthazar in a bear hug.
“Dean,” Castiel called out as he entered their apartment. He furrowed his brow when he didn’t hear a response. Castiel had gotten up pretty early as per usual. He would’ve stayed longer, but he was afraid of being on the bad end of one of Gabriel’s pranks, so he left as soon as he woke up.
“Yeah,” Castiel affirmed Dean, “that reminds me...Mary told me that you didn’t say hi to her on your way in?” Castiel teased. Dean playfully groaned and rested his forehead on Cas' chest. “All I’m saying is...that’s kinda rud-” Castiel was cut off when Dean attacked his sides. Through the laughter, he begged Dean to stop. After a couple more seconds, Dean relented. Castiel caught his breath and Dean kissed him once more. They laid there a tangled mess on Dean’s bed, not speaking, not moving.
“I asked her why she was talking to him again, and she said he reached out and she didn’t want to be rude. I wasn’t happy about it, but I guess I sort of let it happen. I mean...what else was I supposed to do? I’m not one of those guys who tells his girlfriend that she can’t have any guy friends,” he explained.
After an hour of off key singing and hypocritical prayers, he returned home. He immediately went upstairs and changed into something more comfortable. When he returned to the living room, he noticed someone sitting on the couch.
“Sorry I’m late, I hope this makes up for it,” he said, showcasing the bottle of Apple Pie Whiskey he brought.
Anna gently opened the front door, sending up a prayer that everyone was still asleep. As she removed her jacket and boots, she could hear familiar voices coming from the kitchen. She paused, her entire body as still as stone as she deciphered those voices. They didn’t belong to any of the Novaks.
“Thank you, Castiel, you really didn’t have to bring anything,” she said, giving him a warm smile. The gears in Castiel’s mind were turning as he weighed the pros and cons of flirting with Balthazar tonight. On the one hand, it might throw Charlie off her plans of pushing Dean and him together. On the other...he wasn’t sure how Dean would react. Castiel still had a pretty wicked hickey on his ass from the last time he ‘flirted’ with Balthazar. And Dean hadn’t even heard what they were saying, he just saw them standing close together. Castiel was pulled out of his internal debate by a loud noise at the front of the house.
“Oh, hello,” a british voice rang out. Lost in thought, Castiel had failed to notice somebody slipping in. He looked up from where he was fumbling with his phone to set up music. “You’re a new face,” the man observed. Castiel smiled.
She turned back to Castiel and promised, “We’ll finish plotting our schemes later.” With a wink from Anna, the couple returned to the party upstairs.
“Holy shit, you’re gorgeous,” Dean said. Castiel smiled and blushed slightly. The dark haired boy pulled his boyfriend down by the back of the neck and kissed him.
“Gorgeous, huh?” Castiel inquired, a teasing smile on his lips. Dean smiled back, unusually shy. Cas reached up to cup Dean’s face in his hand.
“Cas,” Dean said breathlessly, “you’re gorgeous like this, you’re always gorgeous.” Dean took Cas’s newly hardened length in his hand. Cas gasped at the sudden contact.
Dean grabbed one arm and lifted him up, Sam appearing seemingly out of nowhere to grab Cas' other arm. The brothers made eye contact and brought Cas to the Impala. They laid him down in the backseat and Dean tossed his keys to Sam.
“Balthazar,” Castiel cut him off, “he's not dating Dean. He's dating Dean’s brother. They were waiting for Dean to give them a ride,” Castiel still squirmed in his seat a little bit, which did not go unnoticed by his friend.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered, leaving feather light kisses all the way up until he reached Cas’ lips. “I’ll be more careful next time.”
“I left everything there,” Cas blurted out, once Mary had reentered the room, “my phone, my wallet, my fucking
Castiel sighed and laid fully onto the couch. After a moment of staring blankly at the ceiling, he pulled out his phone.
“Look, I can get you a place under my name, and I can give you a monthly allowance. You don’t have to come back and live with Naomi. In fact, if you leave her name out of this, she won’t bother you again,” Bart promised.
Soon, he added a second finger, pumping the two in and out, Castiel making delicious noises. He scissored them slightly, making sure Cas was nice and open for this. At his boyfriend’s pleads, Dean added a third finger, Castiel’s hips getting more active as he relaxed on the digits. Dean crooked his fingers, finding that ever-sensitive bundle of nerves and bearing down on them.
“You stuck around this long? Must mean the kids aren’t too bad,” he commented, hoping if she had any complaints, she’d voice them now.
"Then I guess we better move this to your room," he suggested before going downstairs and waiting for Dean.
“Ya think?” Castiel said under his breath. His father gave him a look that asked him to play nice. Castiel wiped the humor off his face.
Dean sat down with the lunch he bought from the cafeteria. He wasn’t necessarily excited about it, but he didn’t have anything in the fridge to bring today. He decided to treat himself to a coke from the vending machine. As he cracked it open, he sighed as he looked at his tray. They were serving cheesesteaks today, and as Dean inspected further, he realized there were green peppers on it. He sighed deeply. Today was just not going his way.
“Oh, yeah. Naomi told me about that. She said they both lost their tempers a bit, and that they got into it again. She told me she had sent him to his room afterwards. I was gonna check on him last night, but Naomi said that he just needed some space,” while explaining this, Bart had poured himself a glass of milk and started buttering the toast that had popped up.
“Um...yes,” she agreed, an obviously fake smile on her face. Dean doubted her integrity, but he knew she wouldn’t leave him alone until he agreed to do something with her.
“Well, Cas is on my team. You’re not,” Charlie pointed out. Dean rolled his eyes. Castiel lifted his head from the snow and Dean smiled down at him. Just then, Castiel was hit by another snowball. Then another. And another. Dean acted quickly and covered Cas' body with his own.
“Oh my god, Cas. You’re amazing.” Dean growled, gently grabbing a fistful of Cas’s hair and leading him to his mouth.
“Charlie,” Gabriel yelled into the kitchen, “I know you have booze somewhere in this house. Where is it?” He got up to search for it himself, bickering with Charlie in the kitchen. Moments later, he reappeared with a half-empty bottle of blackberry brandy.
“Well, whoever she is, I bet she’s wonderful to snag a guy like you,” Anna said, giving Castiel a reassuring smile. Castiel was glad he was looking down at his phone, because Anna’s use of the feminine pronoun definitely got a response out of him. He pondered briefly correcting her, but ultimately decided against it. She was just too close to Michael.
When Dean got comfortable again, he was definitely a lot closer than he had been. He also threw his arm along the back of the couch again.
This particular Christmas, however, she was not quite in the holiday spirit. She checked her phone, noting that it was only a quarter past five. Michael usually got up around 6:30.
“Yeah, go ahead,” Dean said, grabbing the box of pasta and pouring it into the pot. He heard the door to their bathroom close and let out a deep breath. He needed to get his plan set in motion.
"So, how've you two been?" Dean asked conversationally. The two girls shared a look and smiled, answering together that they've been doing great.
“How the hell have you never heard of night games?” he all but shouted. Castiel put his hands up in defence.
“Well, it’ll come along when you get more settled. Alfie did it, so I'm sure you'll be fine...although, Alfie did have one advantage,” she said with a smirk.
"He's my boyfriend." Dean said before pursuing the familiar apartment. It took Benny a second to process what Dean said, but then he was at Dean's heels. The flames were licking at the walls around them. They needed to move fast. Dean kicked down Cas's door and searched the apartment. He heard coughing down the hallway.
“Gabe! Lower your voice, it’s five in the morning.” Dean chided. Gabe lowered his voice but now he was just whisper yelling.
, NO!" Cas yelled from his position on the couch. Of course, right as he took the lead, someone had to blue shell his ass. Dean chuckled beside him and Cas shook his head. Half way through their final lap, Cas had managed to make it a close race again. As he broke his last item cube a prayed for a useful power up. He was given a single green shell. He needed to make the most of that little sucker. He lined himself up and focused on the princess in front of him. He hesitated, but pulled the trigger nonetheless.
conversation. ‘Hey Naomi, can I go 600 miles away to hang out with that one friend I always got into trouble with?’ ‘Sure honey, go right ahead’,” Balthazar joked.
“It’s fine,” Dean assured her, “more time to recover if Gabriel brings more tequila.” Jo laughed at that and agreed.
Within a few moments, Cas had three fingers in his fiancé, the man making the most beautiful noises from the head of the bed. Castiel peppered kisses along Dean’s stomach and thighs as he worked his digits in and out. When he decided the physics teacher was ready, he removed his hand completely, shifting to his knees.
He was able to work off some of his stress on the treadmill, letting his mind get lost in his music and the rhythmic pounding of his feet as they carried him for two miles. He greeted Balthazar and they ran in silence, Castiel not in the headspace for chitchat.
“You’re more than welcome to stay in my guest room. Gabriel will be crashing on the couch, though, and I have to warn that he likes to play pranks, especially in the morning,” Charlie cautioned. Castiel laughed as he pictured what his coworker might get up to in just a few short hours. Dean stumbled over and threw his arm around Castiel.
” Bartholomew barked, startling the boy. “That’s enough,” he said, his tone more gentle than before. Naomi went back to the kitchen in a huff, muttering something under her breath. Bart looked at his son and shook his head disapprovingly.
Cas impatiently instructed, when they came up for air, to move to the bedroom. Dean quickly obliged, stripping his jacket and kicking his shoes off through the hallway. Cas followed suit, and before long, Cas had Dean pinned to the bed, a layer of clothing separating them from absolute bliss.
The last ping pong ball in the box was expelled by none other than Charlie, the host celebrating by giving Balthazar the middle finger.
Castiel was ashamed. He was ashamed of himself for acting so childishly towards Naomi, for being so aggressive towards anyone who tried to talk to him, for treating Dean like he had been the past few days.
Dean didn’t take long divesting Castiel of his own shirt, tossing it to the side before diving back in to claim his lips once more. Cas pulled back and bared his neck, inviting Dean to do with it what he pleased. Dean smirked and peppered kisses along Cas’ jaw, down his neck - stopping briefly to nibble at his pulse point, but not enough to leave a mark - finally arriving at Cas’ beautiful collar bone. He sucked hard at the skin there, Cas’ hands trying to find purchase in his shortly cropped hair.
“What? Nothing. He locked himself in Sam’s room and refuses to let anyone in,” Dean explained. “What the fuck happened?” Castiel started pacing Dean’s room, pausing every so often and acting like he was about to say something before continuing to pace.
“I’m so sorry,” she said, “I’m so, so sorry. I should’ve done something else, I-” she choked up and just continued hugging the teen.
"How may times do I have to tell you no?" Cas asked petulantly, squeezing Dean tighter, burrowing into Dean's side. Dean huffed a laugh.
“Nobody is even going to be home. I’m just going to go there, grab a few more things, and head right back. It’s not a big deal,” Cas soothed. Dean still didn’t look satisfied.
“You’re insane,” Jo whisper-yelled at Charlie as they made their way out of the building and into the parking lot. It was a chilly January afternoon, and if the weather reports were anything to go by, it was only going to get worse.
On his way to the bathroom, while trying to get the eye boogers out of his tear ducts, he rather ungracefully ran into the dresser.
“He...he,” Naomi bit back a sob, and Bart took a deep breath. He was not in the mood to do this routine again. “He threatened me. He called me a
After a pleasant lunch, Castiel returned to the office. He went through the rest of his paperwork fairly quick and decided he had enough time to pick up some apple juice from the store. He didn’t know why, but he had been craving apple juice all day.
“So this one’s called The Nutstacker,” the host announced. There were audible groans at the name, but she just continued. “This one is two-v-two, and the other team gets to choose their opponents, so start thinking about who you want to have play. The player on each team who
“Get on the bed,” Cas instructed, removing the rest of his clothing before following Dean. Castiel revered his boyfriend, truly unbelieveing that he had someone so wholly beautiful as Dean Winchester.
“Oh, I’ll get you back,” Dean promised. They kissed for a few more minutes before finally settling down. They got under the covers and cuddled up together.
“Sorry, your royal highness,” Dean apologized sarcastically with a comical bow. Cas looked confused but chalked it up to an inside joke of theirs.
shared a bed on many occasions...but those occasions were a bit different. Castiel awkwardly crawled under the covers, and made sure to stay as close to the edge as possible. Just as he was plugging his phone in, he received a text.
"Is there a Dean Winchester here?" He asked impatiently. The receptionist gave him a look and leafed through her papers.
“Generally, huh? What do you think about, when you touch yourself?” Cas asked bluntly, encircling Dean’s cock in his hand, setting a steady pace.
He walked down the crowded street to a small cafe that served the best chicken noodle soup he’d ever had.
Castiel just looked over at his boyfriend and smiled. He reached out and ran the back of his hand down Dean’s cheek. Dean smiled and leaned into the touch.
“I’m….I’m sorry Cas,” he said. Castiel’s heart leapt at those words. Dean was sorry! Cas’s brain, however, was not as forgiving.
“And just where do you think you’re going?” Naomi called after him. Would she ever have a discussion with Castiel that didn’t involve at least one conversational cliche?
ok. Dean cursed and tried to talk to Cas, but it was clear that his boyfriend wasn’t listening. Eventually, he hung up.
When Castiel arrived home around seven the next morning, he walked directly to the kitchen. It had taken an hour to walk home. When he was driving, it usually only took him about five minutes to get to Dean’s house.
“Sorry,” Dean whispered. Castiel just laughed, causing Dean to blush profusely. He tried to turn away, but Castiel wouldn’t let him. He kissed the blond deeply, framing his freckled face with his hands.
Dr. Andrews paused for a moment. His patient told him that he was hit by his step mother, and that the hit hadn’t been accidental. He did hear correctly when this woman, Naomi, had been addressed as his patient's step mother...right? He didn’t have all the facts, but he knew he couldn’t put his patient in more danger.
Cas whispered something to Aiden before leaning down and giving him a peck on the forehead as well. Cas walked out of the boy's room and Dean shut the door before turning towards Cas. He took his boyfriend's hand and detoured to shut the TV off before heading to the bedroom.
“Hey, I’m the one who brought that bottle,” Dean interjected. Gabriel raised a finger to silence him as he stared down Castiel.
“Yes, Cas, you’re very well-endowed,” Dean appeased sarcastically, “I guess I still just automatically assume people are straight. Probably inherited that from my dad,” he replied, hoping that bringing up his father would put an end to this conversation. They did not get along growing up, and the famous John Winchester was a huge sore spot at the beginning of Dean and Cas’ relationship.
"I found this little boy in the entryway, do you, by any chance, know who he belongs to?" Cas asked, a huge grin on his face. Dean turned around and beamed at the picture they made. He walked up to them and gave a quick peck to Cas's lips before peeking around Cas's back to find his son dangling precariously from his boyfriend's shoulder.
appeared under his text. Almost as soon as it was sent, he received three dots in a gray bubble informing him of a formulating text. He smiled despite himself.
“Yes, Dean, I am aware that you work together. Is there a question in there somewhere? Why do you keep looking at me like I should be talking?”
"Maybe we should get a room." Dean says. Cas agrees and they head to the office to pay for a night. Dean gets the key and takes Cas to their room. It takes Dean a couple tries to get the key in the lock with Cas attacking his neck, but he manages it and opens the door, quickly dragging Cas inside and slamming him into the closed door. He crashes their mouths together while sliding a thigh between Cas legs and they both moan at the contact. Cas's arms wrap around Dean's neck and Dean starts taking off the black jacket Cas has on. Then he moves to unbutton the blue shirt Cas has on underneath. Dean's hands travel the expanse of skin that has been exposed, mouth following his fingers until he's on his knees in front of Cas, mouthing him through his jeans. Cas moans an throws his head back against the door.
But, the smack-talk only seemed to fuel Jo’s fire as she stood up front to guess. She came out of the round matching Charlie’s score of eleven. She handed the phone over to Gabriel, sticking her tongue out in a childish show of pride. Gabriel mocked her back with a stuck-out tongue of his own. Those two really knew how to bring down the mental age of the group.
Castiel felt...guilty. Guilty for lashing out at Dean, for getting drunk and being an asshole, for not wanting to explain himself because it would put him in a position of weakness. Of vulnerability. To fully justify his actions, Castiel would have to tell Dean a lot of things he just wasn’t ready to tell him. It was too early in the relationship, and Castiel feared that these things might break it. And he wasn’t ready to let go of Dean.
These questions and more circled around his head so fast, he wasn’t able to hold on to a single one long enough to ask it. He also couldn’t handle his father just staring at him like that.
With the pants loose, Dean grabbed them firmly and ripped them down. He fondled the globes of Cas’ ass momentarily, enjoying the show he was putting on for himself. In an effort to get Dean to do something, Castiel pushed his hips back into Dean’s hands.
Sam covered his mouth and quickly reminded himself to act normal. Being caught spying would not be beneficial...to anyone. This was quite the conversation, though.
“Talk about shite taste in music, right?” the brit struck up a conversation, coming around the side of Cas’ car to talk to him.
It took a moment, but Dean continued, “So I go and I shop and I get everything ‘cause it’s supposed to snow like it is right now and I didn’t know when the next time we’d be able to go to the store. It’s fine,” he said, slurring heavier each minute. Balthazar cursed himself that he didn’t cut Dean off sooner. “But I’m in the store for like two fucking hours. Everyone and their
grace during this transition? Shouldn’t the adult be accommodating to the child? Utterly confused, Castiel shook himself out of it and set his keys on his nightstand.
“Then you’re paying for our next date,” Dean teased before leaning in and kissing his boyfriend. Cas smiled and kissed him back.
It was a Monday in every sense of the word. Dean woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Late. Which was a wonder because the buzzing of his alarm was giving him a headache. He fumbled around blindly until he found that awful machine. He slammed the snooze button and dragged himself out of bed. Oh how he wished he could burrow back under the covers and continue his blissful unconsciousness.
Castiel, in one last act of surprise, reached up and untied the belt from the headboard, tugging on the end so the still-tied wrists looped over his head. With Dean’s arms wrapped around him, he commanded, “Pull.”
“No,” Castiel said. He laughed as he explained his plan. By the end of the night, they were giddy in anticipation of tomorrow.
“I can’t believe you let him go like that! You were so close! You were sitting right next to him for well over an hour!” she chastised.
She smiled at him. "Good answer,” she said. They went back to easy conversation until Dean was honorably discharged from his watery hell. He spotted them and made his way up to their bench. Most of the games were finishing up to get ready for the dance and fireworks. It wasn’t a summer bash without fireworks.
“What the hell are those?” Jo asked, referring to the hickeys on his neck. “Dean Winchester, you sly dog. You had condom guy over last night didn’t you?” She guessed.
Dean smiles and kisses Cas deeply, both of them panting when Dean pulls back up. Dean quickly decides that he's over the 'taking it slow' thing and starts picking up the pace. He trails kisses down Cas's chest, stopping to pull one of Cas's nipples into his mouth. Cas groans and his left hand comes to pull at Dean's short hair while the other fists in the sheets.
"That's not the reply I wanted. You know, I'll get awful bored if I'm not kept busy. So bored...I might send a funny story a good friend told me about a hot fireman in a parking lot...."
“Well, I’m off to work. Stay out of trouble, you two,” she instructed, pointing an accusatory finger at the pair. The teens protested but she just laughed her way out the door. Once Mary’s car was out of the driveway, Charlie spoke up.
"Agreed," Cas said, chuckling into Dean's neck. He got up and went to the bathroom to retrieve a washcloth. After cleaning up their mess, he untied Dean, making a stop to turn off the lights before settling back into Dean's side.
Castiel was irritated beyond belief. Zachariah was hitting him with file after file of busywork, completely unforgiving of Cas’s reason for his absence. It’s like Zachariah thought Cas dropped a burning building on himself on purpose. Every knock on his door was someone there to either give him an earful for being gone or pile on the paperwork. It was only half past three and Castiel wanted to tear his hair out.
“Hey, wanna dance?” Joseph suggested with a smile. Castiel agreed, never able to resist Joseph’s requests to dance. If Castiel was being honest with himself, Joseph’s dancing was the only thing keeping them together at this point. Well, that and the sex. They tended to argue a lot when they weren’t doing one of those two things.
Castiel slow blinked and walked back into the house. He headed straight for the bathroom; his bladder had been screaming at him since the candy toss.
show up, we’d probably just end up fighting even more because I don’t even know how to talk to Cas right now,” Dean listed out, frustrating himself even further.
Based on the sounds Dean was making, Castiel deduced that he was very much enjoying himself. That, and the fact that Dean’s cock was looking painfully hard on his stomach. Before long, Castiel added a third finger. To pass the time, he leaned down and started marking up Dean’s chest. He had a fleeting thought that he hoped Dean didn’t have to be shirtless in front of anyone anytime soon.
When they crossed the hall and shut his door (Mary’s rule be damned) Dean pointed a stern finger at her.
He sighed and pulled the covers off of himself, shivering as the cold air touched his sleep-warm skin. He really should’ve slept in a shirt last night. He quickly got dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, and a sweatshirt from his alma mater. Padding quietly to the kitchen, he stopped at the dining table stacked with clean clothes and picked out a pair of wool socks. The floor was freezing!
"That's a whole entire day and a half." Cas mock whined. He gave a half smile. "You better get your shoes on. You wouldn't want to be late for your date," Cas said, Dean stood up and pulled Cas with him. The shorter man wrapped his arms around Dean in a hug.
With a smile, Castiel set his alarm for the next morning and put his phone on the ledge behind his bed.
“You broke my heart, Dean,” Castiel said. He had a lot of things he’s wanted to say to Dean for a long time. “You broke it and it didn’t even seem like you cared,” Dean flinched at the words. “Benny tried harder to save our relationship than you did.”
Before long, Castiel leaned up and pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s lips. After only a moment of hesitation, Dean kissed back.
“Right,” Castiel said, all of the wind taken out of his sails, “Um...goodnight. Happy birthday. I love you.”
They traded a few more slow kisses, coming down from their high. Dean smiled sleepily at Cas and looked down at his own body, trying to assess the damage. Castiel laughed and ran his thumb over the hickey he left at the base of Dean’s neck.
I was hesitant to post today because I'm wary of the Ides of March...but then I thought if any of these chapters fit the theme of today, it'd be this one. This is also a fairly long chapter, so buckle up!
When Cas woke again, he didn't know where he was. It took a few moments but he realized he was sleeping in his bed. Which was odd, because the last thing he remembered was falling asleep on the couch. He rolled over to find Dean on his laptop.
“Uhh...person?” Jo guessed as her partner crudely drew a stick figure, “Squat? Crouch?”. Balthazar shook his head and added another person, along with a jump rope.
Gabriel managed to score six points for his team, handing the phone off to Dean. The physics teacher really didn’t want to do this. He already felt like this group didn’t respect his game-playing skills since he hadn’t been a very great competitor last time. They just needed to play poker or pool, then he could show all of them how it’s done! As it were, he took his spot at the front of the room as Balthazar and Jo tried valiantly to score enough points to stay competitive.
“Looks like you could use some Jack in that coke,” Jo commented as she took a seat next to him. Dean laughed.
“Yeah, that’s fine thanks,” there was a pause, but soon enough Zachariah’s intimidating voice filtered through.
"Yes, you were, and I'm still angry at the lack of maturity you showed. God, I felt like I was arguing with a child." Cas said. "A child with a colorful vocabulary," he added a little quieter.
“Nothing. Let’s get you home,” he said. He called a cab and waited at the curb for it. He had planned on getting in the cab as well, but something held him back. He gave the driver the address of Joseph’s apartment and shut the door. His boyfriend gave him a confused look through the window before the car pulled back out onto the street.
“Are you gonna put that in me, or are you just gonna take care of it yourself?” Dean asked. Castiel glared at him.
“Yes, please,” he replied. Castiel placed a kiss upon his forehead before slipping out of bed to complete the task. Dean silently admired the dark mark on Castiel’s ass cheek as he walked into the bathroom.
"Balthazar, I'm not going to a bar with you tonight." Cas rolled his eyes and continued cleaning his kitchen.
“Yeah, well...I’m here now. What are we playin’?” he asked, trying to keep most of the frustration out of his voice. “Got any beer?” he added. Charlie nodded and gestured towards the fridge. As he grabbed a cold one, Jo stood up and prepared to explain the game to everyone.
Naomi hadn’t been joking about the privileges. She wouldn’t even give him his laptop to finish his homework, so he was forced to have his father drop him off at school early (“Children don’t drive cars, Castiel”) just to use a computer.
“Cas isn’t answering,” Dean said, brow furrowed. He tossed his phone on his bed, nearly hitting Charlie before sitting with a huff on his futon.
Dean woke up groggily by the sound of his alarm. He shut it off and turned to face the other side of the bed. It was then he remembered that Cas had not stayed the night. He also remembered
Castiel had his face buried in the pillow, obviously not having anything more to say. Before he left, Dean spoke up again.
Castiel returned his eyes to the television without really focusing on the screen. His thoughts went straight back to Dean...and Charlie. Castiel was not the type of person to come between two people. He didn’t even know if Dean was interested in him...or boys. Plus, even if Castiel
In an act of retaliation, Cas detoured into the kitchen to take a couple shots before finding his british vampire dancing on the main floor. Muscle memory took over as he threw his arms around Balthazar’s neck, moving his hips in time with the music.
"I got you something," Dean said as he walked backwards towards his chair, never breaking eye contact with Cas. Dean picked up the box and walked back over to his husband, "I'm sorry," he said as he handed Cas the box.
Balthazar had surprised him by showing up to the party, causing Castiel to practically tackle him in a hug. The old friends reconnected whenever Castiel wasn’t playing host. There were fewer people here than at Balthazar’s party, but to be fair, Castiel hadn’t lived in Kansas very long.
gal has a problem with you dating my son, then she and I can have a few words. But if it’s important that she stays in the dark, I will hold my tongue,” Mary promised. Castiel let out a slow breath of release.
“No, Dean, it was awful of me. And I guess I was just feeling a bit insecure, and then you kept staying out late, and I thought that it was because you were still mad at me,” Castiel explained. Dean shifted a little further up the bed, placing his hand just above Cas’ knee.
The boys got into the Impala, and Dean started the drive to Cas' house. He really didn’t have a game plan. It’s not like he could walk up to the front door and ring the bell. Wouldn’t that be interesting?
Dean walked up to his apartment and noticed a note stuck to his door. He took it down and skimmed through it.
“Have you seen her, Alfie?” He asked hopefully. The boy just shook his head and looked at him with apologetic eyes. That was when Castiel piped up.
“Maybe you just have to get to know him,” she suggested hopefully. Dean repressed a smile, having had that exact same thought when he’d met him in their intro ‘teaching methods’ class.
"Meg has to give me her two best cards. Twos and jokers are the best cards, then ace, king ect. I have to give her my
Dean grabbed Castiel’s ass, causing the younger boy to jump and break the kiss. He scowled at his boyfriend and shook his head. Dean laughed at Castiel’s facial expression.
“Wait, really? I thought I was going to have to do a lot more convincing, I had a whole analogy and everything,” Charlie said.
“We’re just bed buddies who happen to be very close friends. Our sexcapades were a fling, Dean could be something serious,” Castiel explained.
“No problem. Say, Cassie, I don’t see many rubbish bins out,” Balthazar said apprehensively, looking around the first floor of the house.
“You better wipe that smile off before I wipe it for you,” Dean threatened sitting up on his bed and facing Sam as the younger boy took a seat on the futon.
His older brothers were a whole different story. They loved working for the company. They rivaled each other in their divisions; always trying to out do the other.
“Can I ask you something kind of personal?” Dean asked hesitantly, rolling onto his side, supporting his head in his hand.
“I’ll give you some of the money,” Gabriel offered reluctantly. Balthazar smiled and nodded his head.
Dean got the conversation back into safer territory when he mentioned Charlie. Apparently, Jo was good friends with her. Dean didn’t know if that was going to be a good thing or a bad thing for him in the future.
“I’m sorry,” Cas whispered. He just couldn’t bring himself to explain any further. Castiel felt Dean nod against his own head. They kissed once more before Cas turned back around to resume his position as the little spoon.
"I love you," Cas said in the quiet moment. Before Dean could reply, Cas's mouth was on his in fierce passion.
Castiel took two slow steps towards the bed, contemplating whether or not he really wanted to do this. He reflected on the day he’d had and decided that he would probably be better off if he let off a bit of steam.
“Good morning, Cas!” Sam said, walking up to the counter that separated the kitchen from the dining room.
“I don’t think it’s all that important who you were texting,” Michael insisted, “This is a family dinner, we should be presently enjoying each others’ company.” Their father brushed Michael’s comment off.
When Dean knows Cas is ready, he slides a second finger in, causing Cas's back to arch slightly off of the bed.
“Woah. You guys remodeled,” Castiel japed. He looked over and noticed Charlie giving him a weird look. He awkwardly averted his eyes down to his shoes.
The teen fought against his father for a few more seconds before giving up and leaning into his chest. Bart hugged his son as Cas sobbed into his shirt. They stood like that for a couple minutes, Bartholomew swaying gently in an effort to calm his son down.
“Since you have the time,” she explained, “and you are an occupant of this house, you should be responsible for your fair share of chores.”
He made himself a light dinner and decided to turn in early. His work schedule didn’t care if he got into a spat with his boyfriend, Dean still had to show up ready to fight fires.
Dean shoved his key into the lock, slightly stumbling into the entryway before taking off his boots and jacket.
All-in-all, the first couple months passed by smoothly. Dean could pick up hints that Charlie was up to no good regarding Cas and his relationship. It didn’t seem like she was catching on to the fact that they were
Three hours later and Cas was done for the day. He closed his laptop and sunk into the plush couch. His hands swept down his face, as if they were cleansing him of today’s stress. They weren’t.
“Whiskey,” Dean replied. Balthazar nodded and returned to the kitchen to drop off the gin and grab a couple glasses. He poured a heavy hand into each of their glasses and left the bottle on the table. He decided this was the only glass he would have; he did have a date later that night and he didn’t want to show up already drunk.
After most of their lunch had been eaten, the conversation shifted from light and casual catch-up talk into we-should-probably-discuss-last-night talk.
“Castiel. Out of your office, are we? Now, you know that’s no way work gets done.” Zachariah said. He was holding folders that Castiel presumed were for himself.
“Oh hell no,” Mary interjected, “you are not going back to that house tonight. Go downstairs and make yourself comfortable. I’ll even let you keep the door closed for the night,” she said.
“I didn’t want him to tell her that news on Christmas Eve. I knew she wouldn’t handle it well, and now he’s in the hospital and she’s...I don’t even know where she is. I woke up to an empty house. On Christmas morning!”
“I’m ready, Cas. Please,” Dean begged. Castiel was more than eager to give Dean what he wanted. He sat back and put the condom on his own neglected cock. He coated his hand in a bit more lube and ran it up and down his shaft, biting his lip at the sensation.
"No, I like it." Cas runs his hand through Dean's hair. "And I like you." Dean smiles. "But at least buy me dinner first." Cas leans in an places a chaste kiss to Dean's lips.
By the time he arrived, his mood had not improved. If anything, it had gotten worse because he had time to replay the night before repeatedly in his mind.
that,” Dean asserted. Cas opened his mouth to say something, but cut it off in his throat. Dean audibly scoffed at the self-censorship. “If you’ve got something to say, Cas, spit it out.” Castiel remained silent. He wouldn’t be goaded into saying something he would regret later. He was fairly even-keeled, and he knew how to control his temper.
“Since I bought it, and I’m on the winning team, I’m also taking a shot,” Dean declared, “got any shot glasses?” he asked Charlie. She nodded her head and went to go retrieve them.
"I see you got my notes." Cas said looking at the stack of paper on the coffee table. Dean smiled. "I'm sorry," Cas said.
“Joseph?” Castiel asked. There was murmuring on the other line that Dean couldn’t quite make out. “No, I want to speak to Joseph. Who am I? I’m his boyfriend, who the fuck are you?”
“Yeah,” Sam said curtly, quickly walking towards the parking lot. Dean shrugged and followed him. The redhead, who Castiel assumed must be Charlie, kept her arm linked with Dean’s as they caught up with Sam.
“You’ll castrate me, yeah I know,” Castiel finished. He laughed as he closed the front door behind him. His smile didn’t leave his face the entire ride home.
“Oh, wait! Hey mom, is it ok if Charlie comes over after school?” He asked hopefully before Sam could succeed in pushing him onto the porch.
“Hey mom, what's up?” Mary impersonated her sons jokingly, “oh nothing, boys. How were your days?” She shook her head and returned her focus to preparing dinner.
The laughter crested and then died down, and Castiel leaned forward to kiss Dean soundly on the lips. Dean grabbed a fistful of Cas' hair and kept him right where he wanted him.
Castiel was a mess, tears falling down his cheeks onto his hands still firmly pressed over his mouth. He nodded furiously and removed his hands from his face, “Yes, Dean, of course I’ll marry you.” Dean beamed, and held out his hand for Cas’. He slipped the golden band with a sapphire and emerald inlay onto his
He went downtown to retrieve the files. He hated getting files for Rufus downtown, it took forever. The secretaries must have had a competition to see who can make people wait the longest. And don’t even get him started on the music in the waiting room. No wonder Rufus never did this himself. After an hour of frustrating boredom, Dean texted Jo to have her help him. Dean left his laptop at home, which had all of the scheduling information on it.
“Nice to meet you. I wish it were under better circumstances,” she replied, taking the duffel off her shoulder and handing it to Dean. The boy opened up the trunk and tossed it in. Before he could climb back in his car and drive away, Anna stopped him.
Castiel broke down crying. He couldn’t even hold his phone. He let it drop to the bed before he contracted even further into himself. He heard Dean’s voice faintly from where his phone had landed. Castiel grabbed a pillow and sobbed into it.
Charlie sighed again. “You know how Castiel said he lived out of the way, so that’s why he turned down a ride?”
Castiel squints his eyes and tilts his head. "Dean. I was handcuffed in the back of a cop car. Last I checked, those people aren't 'trustworthy'." Castiel puts his hands in his lap after having used air quotes on that last word.
"My father came home this morning and found me skipping church and I told him that I told Naomi off so he said he'd talk to her and so he did and I could hear them yelling then that fucking bitch called my mom a tramp and a hypocrite and called me a heathen and my father didn't even say anything so I stormed in there and yelled at Naomi and said that I hoped she never became a mother to anyone and then she slapped me she told me to leave so I took back my phone and my keys and I packed and I drove around for a while and now I'm here and...Dean," he rushed out, looking at Dean with tears in his eyes and Dean was so overwhelmed with the new information, but he just hugged Castiel close while the shorter boy buried his face into his shirt.
Dean stirs minutely at Cas's ministrations. The dark haired man pulls back to admire Dean as he gradually gravitates into a state of semi-consciousness. Dean opens his eyes to find Cas looming above him; a soft smile on both of their lips.
A couple more minutes went by and Dean retracted his arm from the back of the couch. He leaned forward and started untying his shoes. Castiel looked at his own covered feet and wondered if he should do the same. He decided not to and focused on the screen.
me. You boys need your sleep. I can’t imagine Naomi will appreciate him staying out too late," she told him, leaving no room for argument.
“Hey Cas?” Dean spoke softly, stroking Cas’s hand where it lay intertwined with Dean’s. They were sitting on the couch. Cas had his head resting on Dean’s shoulder. The sun was pouring in through the window off to the side, a slight breeze that smelled of spring. Old
“Run? Track? Marathon? Fast?” he guessed. Castiel gestured that the last word was on the right track. “Uhhh...fast, speedy, quick?”
“Turn the light off on your way out?” Castiel asked, burying his face back into his pillow, hoping that nobody got
“I know I was a complete...asshole these past few days. I was quick to anger, and I took it out on you, which was completely unfair,” he started. Dean could tell his boyfriend was wrestling with something in his head. He wondered if it was related to Naomi, or their fight, or maybe even something else entirely. It wasn’t long before Castiel spoke again, “I’m going to tell you something and I don’t want you to take it as an excuse. I just...I want you to know why I was acting the way I was,” Castiel said. Dean gave a small nod, encouraging him to go on.
“Maybe he’s having dinner with his family and he can’t look at his phone,” Mary proposed. Dean nodded his head from side to side, not thoroughly convinced of that theory.
“You said that you wanted to ‘talk’, which everyone knows is code for ‘I want to break up’, but please, don’t. I-I can, I can tell my dad. About us. I can-”
Dean decided to go wait at Cas' locker. He still hadn’t received any texts and he was starting to get worried. Usually if something happened between Cas and Naomi, his boyfriend would send him a quick heads up that he wouldn’t have access to his phone.
Castiel packed up his things and made his way towards the parking lot. After reaching his car, he shivered as he unlocked the door and hopped inside. Turning the key in the ignition, his car started making very curious noises.
“I can’t believe you beat me to it,” Castiel chuckled, walking towards Dean, his gaze intense. Dean smiled and tried to say something, but stumbled over his words, not really saying anything. “Dean Winchester,” Cas continued, “for as long as I’ve known you, you’ve always managed to keep me on my toes. Before we met, I was...stern, as some of my peers would say.”
Cas. She tiptoed away and made it to Dean’s room safely. She got his laptop bag and headed back out. She was walking through the living room when she bumped into the coffee table.
“Isn’t there a faculty meeting tomorrow?” Castiel asked. Dean did the calculations and confirmed that yes, there was a faculty meeting. One Friday a month, the principal, Chuck Shurley, got the teachers together to give a ‘status report’. Talk about meetings that could’ve just been an email.
playing out in Cas' mind. He tried to just close his eyes and hope for the fantasy to follow him into his dreams, but apparently he got a little too carried away.
“Yes. You’ll be fine. Evals really aren’t as terrible as you’re probably imagining them to be,” Balthazar soothed. Castiel took a deep breath and nodded his head. He knew he was building this up into something it wasn’t, but he just couldn’t help it.
“Uh, hey Cas,” Dean grabbed his table mate’s attention, “are you free this weekend?” Dean asked, shooting for nonchalance. Cas' phone vibrated on the table between them and both pairs of eyes darted to the distraction. Before Dean could make out what was on the screen, Cas picked up his phone, glanced at the text, turned a shade pinker than when he started this conversation, promptly shoved his phone into his pocket, and nodded in reply to Dean’s question.
Both men were surprised when the door opened and Charlie walked in. Castiel immediately removed his headphones and gave her a questioning look.
The pair were like that for minutes on end, making out like a couple of teenagers against Castiel’s car. They were re-familiarizing themselves with each others’ mouths, leaning into the tricks they remembered and trying to find new things the other had developed in their years away from each other. They pulled apart when they heard a wolf whistle from the building. Dean smiled and leaned his forehead on Cas’s shoulder.
Dean walked through the front door then silently climbed up the stairs, hanging a left into their daughter's room.
“I’m not opposed,” Dean whispered. Before he knew it, Castiel was sliding onto his body, positioning them so they were chest to chest. The shorter boy quickly latched onto Dean’s neck. He could feel that Cas wasn’t quite low enough that he’d be able to cover it up tomorrow, but damn if he was going to tell Cas to stop. After a few moments (and a few hickeys), Castiel started his descent on Dean’s body. His head disappeared below the covers and he pulled Dean out through the hole in his boxer briefs.
He had slipped out as soon as he woke up, not wanting to overstay his welcome. Now, he was starving, having not eaten since lunch the previous day.
The fourth Thursday of November was finally right around the corner, and although ‘relieved’ might have been a strong word, Castiel was at least seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And no, he wasn’t even going to
“Are you going to tell me why Castiel is lying to me?” She asked. Both boys’ eyes went wide as they shared a look across the table.
All Cas could manage was a fervent nod, quickly pulling Dean into a fierce hug before pulling back slightly and kissing his
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Castiel asked, a mischievous glint in his eye. A wry smile spread across Dean’s face.
"God, yes, I meant it, every word of it. I swear, baby, I didn't mean what I said earlier. I was being an ass and I don't know why...." Dean took a deep breath and stood up. "Maybe we should have this conversation somewhere else." Dean proposed as he referenced to their sleeping daughter. Cas nodded and led the way back to their bedroom. Dean shut the door behind them and turned to face his husband, whose arms were folded over his chest.
Castiel hung up and he couldn’t possibly stop grinning. He hadn’t gotten to say those words to Balthazar in a long time. He was getting more and more eager about Friday by the minute.
“…to pay you in one way or another. And then there’s a winky face!” Gabe erupted in laughter, Jo mirroring his look of amusement. Dean shot straight up and lunged for his phone, but Gabe was prepared. The short man shot across the room, keeping distance between Dean and himself.
“Ok, since we’re all here now, we can discuss what we’re doing tonight,” Charlie announced. “I thought it would be fun if we did some of those minute-to-win-it games.”
“Ok, so maybe I didn’t think you two would get together, but that’s only because my good friend over here,” he marched across the room and threw his arm around Balthazar, squeezing him tightly in a side-hug, “had taken a liking to Castiel, and I couldn’t bet against this face, could I?” Gabriel asked, using his free hand to squeeze his colleague’s face into a pucker. Balthazar tolerated it for maybe a second before pushing Gabriel off of him.
After two days of only leaving Dean's side for the bathroom and occasional food, Cas was advised to go home and take care of himself.
“You’re so beautiful like this, Cas. All sexy and desperate. You look amazing stretched around my cock.”
“Since Samandriel?” Castiel finished for his friend. “Yeah, uh, guess who goes to Lawrence High,” Castiel said.
Once Dean was sure Cas was ready, he removed his fingers and undid his own pants, shucking them down his legs and kicking them off. He removed his shirt as well before he poured out a bit more lube and coated his much neglected cock. He decided to tease Cas further, smacking his ass with the tip of his dick.
And wow, Dean felt something akin to giddy that Cas knew what he sounded like first thing in the morning.
He slipped the bomber jacket onto his shoulders and pinched his boyfriend’s ass as he closed the door behind them, a cheeky smile on his face. He took out a cigarette and lit it as they pulled out of the parking lot.
“Yes, I see how that can be annoying. I grew up in a house with five siblings,” Balthazar said, nodding along.
“Your spark plugs have mysteriously gone missing,” he divulged, “hop in my car and I can drive us home. Quick, while no one’s watching,” Dean said, closing the hood. Castiel grabbed his stuff out of his car, locked it, and followed Dean to the impala.
Swallow. Dean's first thought was the bedroom, but he laughed at himself when he figured out Cas meant the kitchen. Could you blame him for having a dirty mind?
“Ok, I see what you mean,” Balthazar started, “First off, I’m sorry about Castiel’s previous employer, but I can assure you, our administration is not homophobic. In fact, even if they were, it would be illegal for them to fire you based on your sexual preference because we teach at a public school. Secondly, Ms. Rosen was not fired for having a relationship with Mr. Shurley.”
"Don't stop Cas, please. Never stop," Dean plead, pulling on his restraints as he tried to put his hands on Cas. He growled in frustration and pounded up into Cas, causing the man on top of him to curse loudly and encourage more.
“Are you still sick?” she asked. Castiel was confused until he remembered that the last time Naomi spoke with him, he had been staring into his toilet.
“Oooooooo, Dean’s in troubleeee,” Sam taunted, earning an ‘I’ll get you for that’ look from Dean. Mary held a hand up to Sam, stopping him from adding anything else.
Once two bags of popcorn had been popped and salted, the two boys made their way downstairs to the den. They sat on the couch and tried to agree on what to watch.
"I'll see you tomorrow," Cas said, carefully choosing his words to hopefully calm down Dean's inner monologue. Cas did his best to distract Dean from his thoughts this morning. He did pretty well, if he did say so himself.
At least, he thought he could do that. Dean couldn’t seem to fall asleep. He didn’t mind though, he was more than happy to lay with Cas and have a few hours of thinking. After a while, Dean’s thoughts traveled to the half naked body cuddling up to him.
“So Naomi leaves Thursday evening...tomorrow,” Castiel restated for about the hundredth time that phone call.
“Hey, I’ve got a TBI on a seventeen year old boy. He’s been unconscious for about half an hour. He needs a gurney and a CT, asap,” she said. Gwen jumped into action and they rolled a bed out to the car. They got Cas on it and wheeled him in. Mary instructed Dean to take Sam and park the car. After that, they were to go straight to the waiting room and sit tight.
have Dean, he couldn’t be public about it, lest Naomi catch on and throw Castiel out. Then, to make things even the slightest bit more difficult, add in the fact that he was the new kid in school. Castiel knew that rumors spread like wildfire among teenagers, and Castiel was paranoid that people would notice that Dean had broken up with his girlfriend, started hanging out with Castiel, and put two and two together. The boy crossed his legs on the footrest and resolved to think of something else.
He wanted a lot of things. He wanted to be on his phone or his laptop. He wanted his mom. He wanted his family the way it used to be. He wanted to be back in Chicago. He wanted Dean.
He swept down onto the bed and kissed Cas with everything he had. His hand traveled down back to where it was when they were on the couch. Cas hummed in pleasure and bucked up into Dean's hand.
"It's not a date, you ass." Dean replied, peppering a kiss to his boyfriend's disheveled hair. Cas squeezed one last time before letting go.
"Don't call me," Cas added before slamming the door behind him. He fired up his engine and ignored the buzzing in his pocket as he peeled out of the driveway.
If Castiel was being honest with himself, he was jealous of Charlie. Dean was giving her so much attention and the two seemed to have an endless amount of inside jokes that Castiel couldn’t even begin to decipher. Throughout their lunch time escapades, Castiel couldn't help but wish Dean paid as much attention to
“Uh, Kevin’s. Kevin Tran, the kid from my AP classes,” Castiel lied. He didn’t know why exactly he didn’t want his mother knowing about even the mere existence of Dean, but he followed his gut and decided to keep his exact location to himself.
When he arrived back at Dean’s house, he found his boyfriend on his bed, watching Netflix on his laptop. He was lying on his side with his head pillowed by his folded arm.
Balthazar noticed, despite his efforts, he was not succeeding at raising Castiel’s spirits. After paying for the meal, they climbed back into Balthazar’s Porsche and headed back towards Castiel’s house. On a whim, Balthazar took a left turn instead of a right.
Gabriel told him the full story, and by the end of it, it seemed the prankster had forgotten all about Dean and Cas’ tiff. The physics teacher was just glad he didn’t have to come up with a backstory, Cas was much better at inventing those.
Castiel grunted when the phone was thrust into him. He tried not to take it too personally, but he knew Dean was mad at him, and the man had just done the worst out of everyone so far. Castiel took his spot and they started the round. He managed to guess nine correctly, giving his team the lead.
A few days later, Cas and he were watching TV, Dean's arm was slung on the back of the couch and Cas was leaning into him. It had been a relatively normal week, although Cas felt like something was amiss. Dean seemed to close in on himself and Cas, for the life of him, couldn't figure out why. He entertained the idea that Dean's mood was brought on by something
“Oh, no you don’t!” Dean yelled after him. He scooped up some snow and chased after Cas. He caught up and shoved some down the back of Cas' sweater. The younger boy shrieked at the frigidness. He whipped around, his eyes ablaze as they centered on Dean.
The boots came off next; those he just tossed to the side. Finally, and ever-so-slowly, he removed the booty shorts, revealing to Dean that Cas had skipped putting on underwear.
"C-cas, no don't stop," he pleaded. Cas took the invitation and swung one leg over Dean's lap and straddled his waist. He leaned in close but didn't kiss Dean quite yet.
“You’re not even listening to me!” Gabriel whined, throwing his head back in illustration of his frustration. Charlie sighed and looked up from her computer for the first time that morning.
“Um, I-I think you need to contact my dad...have him deal with the medical...stuff. I don’t really know. But...Anna, please don’t let Naomi know where I am. I can’t...please,” Castiel begged. Anna was quick to assure him that she had absolutely no desire to involve Naomi.
“Now go clean up that trash. I didn’t raise you like that,” she said, giving him a pointed look before returning to Castiel’s room.
“Cas,” Dean said, looking at Castiel as if he might disappear if he spoke too loud. Castiel clenched his jaw. It’s been five years. Shouldn’t he be over Dean already? He’s had time to recover, he has a boyfriend now. So why didn’t he go home with Joseph?
“Yeah,” he whispered, wishing with all his might that this was some sort of twisted nightmare. “I can't believe my father is doing this. Ever since…” Castiel trailed off, not wanting to discuss
this was because of her. He didn’t know if she was the one who struck him, but he knew she was responsible. If Dean saw her right now, he’s not entirely sure he could restrain himself.
“Castiel, all I am trying to do is bring your attention back to your academia. You’ve been out of the house so much doing God knows what, which you
. He was vacuuming his carpet for the third time. He had dusted every available surface in his apartment. He even checked the goddamn smoke detectors! He took a deep breath and forced himself to snap out of it and stop stress cleaning. Instead, he took up pacing the living room, checking the clock every 30 seconds. He stormed into his bedroom and picked up his phone to call Dean and tell him he was sick or something.
Dean disappeared down the hallway for a moment before coming back out with an honest-to-god red sack slung over his shoulder and a Santa hat on his head.
“What am I hearing about Castiel?” Mary asked as she walked into the kitchen. She was wearing her scrubs, obviously getting ready to head to her shift.
first day of middle school. New kid in a new country with a weird accent. The novelty of your newness will wear off eventually,” Balthazar soothed.
feel when Cas hangs out here?” Sam asked. Charlie smirked and took a tentative sip of the hot chocolate.
“Mmm, Dean. Feels good.” Cas groaned out. “Time s’it?” Cas slurred, bringing a hand from under the pillow to swipe at his eyes.
Castiel jumped when his phone vibrated again. He pulled up Dean’s contact and called him, wiping away tears he wasn’t aware were there.
This was something brand new to Castiel. Something he thought might’ve come along with Alfie had he gotten the chance to explore. Something that was never quite
” The rest of the table erupted in laughter at Dean’s misfortune. Jo reached out and took another cup.
“Agree to disagree,” he said. Charlie rolled her eyes and sent up a prayer when the bell rang, forcing her coworker to return to his own classroom.
Castiel didn’t know what to do. His dad looked so...small in that moment. Castiel could see that his father hated being caught in between the two of them. He took a few steps towards his dad and hugged him. As much as Castiel wanted to be mad at him...hell, as much as he
"Ha! You missed!" Dean teased as he crossed the finish line, throwing his hands up in victory. Cas crossed shortly thereafter and returned his controller to the coffee table.
Dean watches Cas's face as it changes with each movement Dean's finger makes. Dean loves that he puts those looks on his Cas's face.
“Alright, I’ll leave you alone. But do you want to come over after work? We could-” Dean cringed internally before finishing, “talk about it.”
Cas watched as Dean exited the store. He just scored a date with Dean! He needed to get home and start cleaning. Pronto.
“I’m literally driving you home right now!” Castiel just laughed. He kept snacking on his candy as they made the rest of the drive to the Winchester’s house.
“What? What’s go-” she stopped mid sentence when she saw the boys. “Bring him up here, set him on the couch,” she instructed, rushing to the bathroom to find the first-aid kit. When she got to the living room, Cas was lying unconscious, blood trickling down his forehead. She took the gauze out and handed it to Dean.
“You think Dean was jealous?” he just laughed, “yeah, I’m not so sure about that. If he were jealous, he wouldn't have gone into that room with Amara,” without a drink to sip from, Castiel had no other option to distract himself than looking out the window. “He was a fucking idiot,” he mumbled, mostly to himself. With his eyes mostly unfocused on the outside world, he missed the puzzled look on Charlie’s face. He also missed her pulling out her phone and shooting off a text.
the very last time he would see his best friend, “he's been...less. He's not around as much, he doesn't stand up for me, or himself for that matter. I don't get it,” Castiel informed his friend.
The app must have sensed that Dean had something to prove, and actively worked against him. He hadn’t even heard of half the animals they were trying to get him to guess! How the hell was he supposed to get ‘gnat’, and was a sea urchin even an animal? He pushed the phone harshly into Castiel’s chest after scoring a pathetic three points. He was ready for this night to be over.
“Yes, and as we decided, teams were chosen based on the order everyone showed up. Charlie is with Gabe, and I’m with Balthazar, which leaves you and Castiel,” Jo explained. Dean nodded his head in understanding.
Cas leaned back, placing his hands behind him. By changing his angle, he was able to stimulate his prostate with every thrust. Dean was quick to aid by thrusting into Cas.
“So, what are we playing?” Dean asked, realizing that Gabriel probably wasn’t intending on giving the bottle of whisky back.
“Hello,” Castiel said in greeting, his voice not as strong as it was when he was talking to Mary. He dawdled over to where Dean was sitting at the foot of his bed, feeling less and less prepared for this conversation by the second. When Castiel finally made it, Dean stood from his bed and surprised Castiel by wrapping him in a tight hug. It only took a moment, but Cas was hugging back. They stood like that for a while.
“Almost as ridiculous as you having all day to clean the kitchen, yet I come home and it’s exactly how I left it,” Naomi retorted, “Phone, laptop, keys,” she demanded, holding out her hand. Castiel just stared at her, his jaw aching from how much anger he was holding back. He dug his phone out of his pocket and threw it on his dresser where his keys and laptop were already sitting before getting up and storming out of his room. Naomi took a deep breath and collected the ‘privileges’. If she had known parenting was going to be this hard, she would’ve crossed Bartholomew off her list at the first mention of children.
“Oh to be twenty-five again,” Balthazar lamented, launching into one of his stories about the shit he pulled when he was becoming an adult.
“Friggin’ humanities teachers,” Dean said conspiratorially to the biology teacher. Gabriel cracked a smile and nodded.
“You can borrow one of my shirts,” he offered, pointing to the dresser in which he kept the clothing. Castiel sauntered over to the dresser, swaying his hips a little more than necessary. He knew Dean was watching him, and he was going to enjoy the attention.
He thought. At that moment his stomach asked the same question. He had an hour to get to Cas’s and he still wasn’t even dressed. He didn’t even have a shirt on, for Pete’s sake! He decided food was a more pressing matter and made himself a quick sandwich. After practically shoving that into his mouth, he walked down the hall into his bedroom.
“I don’t like your tone,” Naomi started, “and yes. You should be striving for As on all your tests. Especially calculus, since you’re taking that for a college credit. How you do in that class will affect your college selection, Castiel. I don’t think you understand that.”
The brit’s jaw clenched as he thought about how to respond. He could very well throw Dean under the bus and end the whole shit-show that has been plaguing him for the past few months. He was about to do just that when he saw something in Dean’s eyes. He took a deep breath.
“Shit,” Cas hissed. He pulled his wrist to his chest. He looked up into Dean’s worried eyes. “I’m fine, let’s keep going,” Cas said.
“I’m very sorry, ma’am, but I am not legally allowed to disclose anything to you,” At that moment, a couple police officers rounded the corner. Dr. Andrews spotted them and with a sigh of relief, waved them over. “If you have any further questions, you can ask these fine officers,” he told Naomi. He hated dealing with the legal side of his job.
When he entered the kitchen, he let out a sigh and shook his head. It was still in the same state it had been since Naomi had asked him to clean it. He dove right in, throwing away the trash that littered the countertops. After that was finished, he packed the dishwasher as full as he could get it. He filled the sink with hot water and soap and washed the remaining dishes by hand. After drying the dishes, he stacked them in their correct cupboards and drawers. Then, he got disinfectant wipes and wiped down the countertops. Once that was finished, he took the swiffer out of the closet and cleaned the hardwood floors in the kitchen and dining area. While he returned it to the closet, he saw the vacuum sitting there, and decided to run it over the carpet in the living room. He actually rolled the cord up nicely after he was done this time. He was in a surprisingly good mood, considering the week he’d had and the chores he was doing.
