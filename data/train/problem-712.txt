“No, you’re not,” John says. “You’re drunk and you’re having a massive panic attack. Come on, let’s get some fresh air, yeah?’
“I was living there, for a while. A few months. He needed help,” John explains and shrugs. “Live-in doctor.”
“Technically, I wasn’t lying, John—”
John is speechless. Sherlock looks much the same.
“Stewart had somehow convinced Mycroft’s boss to get face time with Khoury during the night,” Sherlock says. “Mycroft and I got our hands on the security tapes. They never mentioned Stewart jumped him. He could have done it. He could have slipped him a blade.”
“Why not?”
He takes the stairs down to the sitting room, calling for Sherlock. When he turns the corner to the kitchen, he’s surprised to find Sherlock with a guest.
“Yes, they were.”
Another message arrives.
“It means I…” he starts, “I don’t feel comfortable with you going away like that. Considering your… history.”
“So you were worried you’re being offered something that would be taken away from you?” David asks.
"There's no slide under that microscope, you're examining air." John says with a sad smile.
He came home and attached himself to a bottle of whiskey.
, David. Eight long years, I sat here and cried myself to sleep, every night.” She says. “And then they sent me that box and a letter saying they’re starting to pay dependants’ benefits…” She takes a long breath, closing her eyes when she continues. “And Henry was here and he… I didn’t want you to find out like that. When they told us you’re coming back I told Henry that despite everything I’m still your wife. That you come first. And I-”
By the time they reach their destination dusk is falling over the small, quiet village. John’s mind is clearer and he feels re-energized after the short respite thanks to an uneventful ride. He steps out of the car carrying Rosie in his hands.
“Perhaps…” Sherlock starts. “When we go back to London we can… discuss options.”
Also, have you read my most recent ficlet,
“Ummm.” She starts but isn’t sure what to say. “I’m not sure what’s going on but I heard you mention James Sholto’s name.”
“He’s a good looking bloke. I’d let him kiss me.”
“I’m not coming.” John says and Sherlock freezes mid-movement, surprised by the declaration. “I’m not playing along with whatever the hell it is the two of you are planning.”
They thank her profusely and head for the shops. They get some chicken, sausages, sides - all premade, John figures it might save everyone a lot of unneeded stress over the next few days.
“What?”
Sherlock snuggles closely still. “What about him?”
“I trust you’ve heard the news today?” Mycroft asks, averting a curtain as he speaks.
“Why were you kicked out of uni?”
“Yeah,” John frowns. “The case is... it’s been taxing. I’m going over there now.”
Alexander is frozen in place and can’t seem to move. The man turns to look at him.
He closes his eyes in despair. It’s always so terrible when reality destroys his well-made arguments, his self-assured plans. Because John insists that there can be no more lies between them, and that’s impossible.
And it’s only because Sherlock’s always paying attention that he hears Saul’s whisper. “You can really see the resemblance, can’t you?”
“He didn’t ‘
“It’s nice to have a baby in this house.” She tells John with a sad smile as she sits down to eat. It’s nothing complicated, just some fried eggs and sausages.  “I wish you’d come visit more often dear, not only when you need to drug your friends or bury your father.”
"Why not?" Sherlock asked, bitter. "Never took you for a coward, John Watson."
“Oh. A Nazi joke? I thought those were generally frowned upon.”
Sherlock’s eyes roll back in guarded pleasure.
“Right,” John says and inhales deeply. He reaches his hand out to Sherlock’s. “Let’s go.”
"John, she loves you," he says coolly, wincing when John scoffs again. "When she left, she asked me to take care of you till she’s back. I won't lie and tell you I didn’t think there might be other explanations, other forces at work. But she deserves the benefit of the doubt—" Sherlock continues quickly when he sees John's doubting stare, "—of assuming she's not off playing secret spy and enjoying it. You've made that mistake before. You were gravely wrong then as you might be now."
Yet there are two men in her life these days. One of them constantly fights to keep her safe and married, the other is her husband. Even she can see just how very dysfunctional this triangle is, at this point.
“Coming back.”
“No, not really.” John says, aching to unarm Sherlock from years worth of derision towards his frankly sorrowful mother. “I take the stuff she told me mostly as a… cautionary tale, I suppose. To try and not make the same mistakes she’d admitted to.”
He smiles again, the warmth in the cabin soothing his mind and body as he relaxes against the uncomfortable chair. If he closes his eyes and tries hard enough, he can imagine this night as one of those many years ago in Baker Street, when John and he were just getting to know each other.
“Thanks, love.” She takes the envelope with a frown, flipping it over. Scribbled in fine, feminine handwriting are the words
“You need to… You need to give me a choice in things that involve me, Sherlock. You can’t justify everything in the name of saving my life.”
"I don't think so."
He’s staring down the microscope when the sounds of John’s heavy footsteps finally thunder through the flat hours later. He can hear the man’s fatigue in the cadence of his climb, the weight of the day weighing him down.
, he thinks.
“Yes.” Sherlock breathes, his brain suddenly whirring in overdrive. He stares at the map, suddenly seeing it in a whole new light.
“Of course not. You look like you need it.”
“I wanted to sign them in Alexander’s presence. He didn’t even bother to tell me he asked for them to be drafted.” James explains.
“Generally negative, ma’am,” Tahir says. “
So, Mycroft and John.
James’ voice is nearly a growl when he speaks, his head almost stuck to the table.
“What?” David asks, waking from his disorientation.
He has work to do.
right?” Sherlock continues his tirade, ignoring the interruption. “Why am I still here? The deal was that I’m to confirm his identity and then move on to the next assignment.”
He’s been grunting and huffing and mumbling in a bid for the other man’s attention for the better part of an hour now. Necklace lady is all but gone and forgotten, taking the promise of excitement with her. Never mind that, though. Sherlock has the wheels of a new plan to set in motion, and the sooner he starts, the better.
John turns to look at Sherlock, trying to find his footing. Sherlock turns to look at the body instead.
“Sherlock, there were more than fifty casualties in that raid, all Abu Nazir’s men.”
She never understood Sherlock’s real reasoning behind keeping her so close, insisting on being the one fighting for their marriage. She’s sure a part of it is a stalling tactic - keep your enemies close, etc. Sherlock has been keeping a very watchful eye on her. Supposedly not in revenge, but in the name of his lifelong mission of Keeping John Watson Happy.
Priya turns around and notices John watching them. She smiles brightly and waves hello, signalling him to join them. His first instinct is to move towards the door. Then he catches another glimpse of Sherlock and decides not to.
Sherlock’s eyes dart up. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
Sherlock was never one to stand in defence of humankind, and the sights in front of him justify that.
She turns back to the kitchen, admitting defeat, as he runs upstairs for a quick pre-work shower.
.” He whispers to himself in disbelief, as if Sherlock just suggested that aliens have taken over 10 Downing St.
A beige-and-white monstrosity, the Clerkenwell practice is proof of the old adage: money can't buy good taste. Mycroft was adamant that Dr. Levinson was the best doctor money could buy for a man in Sherlock’s condition, and it shows; in the empty waiting room alone stand three Linley chairs worth more than John's entire life savings and debt combined.
No response.
Sherlock sighs in resignation. “Ok.” He says, picking up his suitcase.
“Go ahead.” James says quickly and turns back to his drink.
“You…” he starts, his face clouding. He feels dizzy. “
Sherlock hums, mumbling distractedly. “Shame.”
“There are plenty of single parents in the world, John. Everything can be outsourced these days, including child care. ‘Gig economy’ as it were.” Sherlock makes a face at the millennial term. “We can ask Mycroft to help find a vetted nursery school--”
“Be careful who you share your bed with at night,” Mycroft warns him. “You’ve sent yourself to the ends of the world in order to avoid all this… drama.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He could leave, start over—as insurmountable as that sounds. People divorce and raise children separately, that’s nothing new. He’s the product of a broken home and while his parents were atrocious at making the most out of it for their children, he’s a passably functioning adult.
“I know who you are, mate,” John says quietly. “I
“Oh my god…” James says and looks away too, his body slumped. “My apologies, John. I’m so sorry. I didn’t have any
“Because…” John’s confused. How can it not be? “Because we’re friends. We’re best friends, we’re very close. He and my daughter are the most important people to me in this world.”
“Thank you.”
She shushes Rosie, sleeping peacefully in her baby carrier, shouldering the diaper bag as she follows the woman inside. Once inside, Mary scans the openings underneath the stall doors, relieved to see they’re all empty but one.
“John.” Mary’s sharp voice travels through the sitting room, waking him. He opens his eyes and looks around, the room gathering shape slowly. It’s early morning—the sky is still grey, he orients himself quickly. The telly is on, muted.
“I’ve been to Jordan once,” John says. “Came back with an extra five pounds. They feed you up, there.”
He stops when Sherlock’s body tenses unexpectedly, sobering up quickly.
“Oh.” Sherlock smiles. “You noticed?”
“My brother requested to be re-enlisted with MI6, Dr. Watson.” Mycroft says. “It was in the works long before the...
“About Mum and Dad?”
“You’re going through your process right now, and I decided to work on something myself,” John declares and Sherlock listens intently. “I’m going to speak more openly, more clearly with you from now on. I always assumed we understand each other perfectly, but I don’t think that’s true. I told you last time at David’s that I can’t handle any more secrets. I’m going to demand the same from myself. Does that make sense?”
John smiles as a warm memory comes to mind.
John passes Sherlock his phone without a word.
Unsure what to do now, he stands up and moves behind his chair, grabbing the cushion with one hand while still holding Rosie in the other. His voice trembles and he braces himself for his next question.
… relationship. Otherwise, Sherlock, it’s not much of a relationship at all.”
“He was deployed rather close to Kabul at first, but the situation deteriorated in Southern Afghanistan shortly after he arrived there. Swedish and Danish NATO forces took over British ones in Kabul, who were sent to Helmand instead.”
Sherlock’s eyes dart to the doctor, his attention now zeroing in on John's tightly wound body at the sight in front of him.
Sherlock is silent for a long moment. “I admit it might… make things difficult for me right now.”
“What?” Sherlock asks again, this time from just outside the cabin door.
“Indeed,” Edwin says. “I’ve learned long ago to trust Mr. Holmes’ instincts, Dr. Watson. I knew something must have gone terribly awry when the Corporal called to report him.”
“Turns out the man was a hoarder,” she says with a sigh. “Mountains upon mountains of junk. Took us days to clear the place, the things I found there. A lot of it is... probably stolen, I suppose, but anyway—I remember growing up he used to joke about how he buried a treasure in the grove next to his flat by some tree we used to play under, and when we cleared his things I thought… what the hell, you know? And guess what? I found a box. Most of it was junk too, I suppose…” Her thought trails off unfinished as she reaches into her purse, pulling a dossier out and flicking through it. “But then I found this and I… I thought you'd like to have it.”
Sherlock sighs. “Since I came back.”
For the sake of argument and my laziness, imagine there existed a printed version of Al Jazeera in 2015.
“Yes, she is.”
“Is it weird for you?” John asks and Sherlock nods. “Why?”
“Rosie lost her mother, John.”
“Yes, I know that, Sherlock. What does that have to do with everything I just said?”
“Eat now,” John says with a winning smile.
Looking ahead he notices the big, green cottage Mrs. Holmes had mentioned. Rosie’s pushchair is standing on the front porch. This is the right place, then. It looks cosy, well taken care of. There are silly looking garden-gnomes and very minimal Christmas decorations.
“So you’ve known him for a long time then.” Sherlock cuts Alexander’s musings. “Before and after that injury. The paranoia, the trauma, you’d known all about it by the time you married him. What changed?”
“Of course you hate the suburbs.” Sherlock laughs still. “You, John Watson, were not meant for the suburbs.”
“Have you seen Alexander Calvert in the clinic recently?” Lestrade asks.
His body freezes in realization. He takes his phone and is about to call Mycroft when he notices a small flicker of light coming from inside 221B. It appears to be coming from… from his old room, he realizes. Up the stairs, to the left.
Sherlock spends his nights on the stairs to the flat, awaiting a drunk John to appear.  When he does, Sherlock takes him up to his room. Some nights Sherlock smells the stench of cigarettes and the sweet scents of a woman’s perfume; other nights the scents are clearly a man’s cologne.
Mary crosses her arms, huffing as she plans her next move.
John’s brain finally picks up on the hint. He pulls his wallet out, grabbing the notes and handing them to the man.
Sherlock's eyes were stuck on the lens, unseeing. He waited until the front door shut quietly to close his eyes in defeat.
“Yes?” He asks with a sigh, looking between the three of them. “What’s this about?”
“Still—”
John raises his eyebrow at him, critically.
“Oh,” is all he can come up with at the thought that his wife has essentially just quit her job as his nurse. “Alright. That’s...”
He parks the car on the other side of the road from the flat, looking up to the windows of the second floor. The building is pitch black; if Sherlock had been in John would have seen some movement or a distant light coming from the kitchen or the fireplace.
“What?”
Her body was found nearly two months later by a passing city official, thrown haphazardly in a pine grove-turned-landfill just outside Broomfield. Her skull was bashed. Hers would have been a slow, agonizing death.
“Why?”
Sherlock nodded, unable to speak.
He grabs his burner laptop, ostensibly to Google names of places he might visit nearby but his fingers have a mind of their own; he ends up Googling John’s name. He scours the web, his Facebook account. Nothing. There are dozens of new comments on the blog, all unanswered. It’s as if the man disappeared off of the face of the earth.
“Why did he petition for divorce?” Lestrade asks.
Sherlock is adamant on figuring this out for her, on saving her from herself. He’s more than welcome to give it a go. She doesn’t know what Mycroft or his colleagues have in store for her - now that she’s no longer pregnant and having pulled a disappearing act, she assumes she’s fair game.
’ Sherlock. He’s ashen and tight-lipped, his thumb moving back and forth restlessly over his clasped hands in a nervous tic.
“I’m fine, Collins.”
“What’s this?”
A myriad of possible answers goes through his mind, from blatant lies to half-truths to juvenile deflections. What’s the point though, he wonders? she can tell when he lies, anyway, and playing this game might make her think there’s any point to it whatsoever.
“Oh, man,” Lestrade says. “I figured you two… figured out where you stand with each other. It’s been so long.”
The limp is returning; he can tell simply from the sound of furious footsteps. Of course it is.
Sherlock swallows loudly.
“Enough grumbling, Grant-”
“I’m right here.” Mycroft’s voice comes from behind the door, a step behind the woman. “No need to antagonize the entire airbase, Mr. Knight. Thank you, Lieutenant.”
“No, it’s not nothing.”
“What family emergency?” Lestrade asks and looks at Sherlock. “Was Sherlock there when you talked?”
He doesn’t believe Sherlock when he tells him it’s safer this way, or that it was her only option. Mary is the woman who outsmarted Sherlock Holmes, caught him by surprise and nearly took his life. If she wanted, if she
Sherlock scowls and closes his eyes in frustration, glimmers of panic and excitement taking residence in his belly at the same time.
Sherlock's mouth falls open. Oh, he thinks to himself. Is that what you're doing, John?
He raised his eyes from the picture to the man sitting solemnly in front of him. His entire body shook violently, uncontrollably.
“Considering—
John raises his eyes as he picks up on Sherlock’s train of thought. “You think he’s innocent.”
What a difference a few days make.
He texts Eva.
Sherlock is holding an apple and a fruit knife. He’s picking the apple apart and eating it silently, in front of the camera. Sherlock’s sneaky, teasing smile is one he hasn’t seen in a long time.
“Yes.” Sherlock says matter-of-factly, sharply. The doctor nods.
“Some people think the meaning of the proverb is that God, such as it is, had meant that children should and would suffer the consequences of their parents’ actions,” Sherlock says. “However Ezekiel argues that righteous children do not suffer for their parents’ wickedness; nor do wicked children benefit from their parent’s righteousness.”
“I’m not sure,” he admits. “But the truth about what really happened doesn’t matter as much as the story he's telling.”
Sherlock takes the steps to 221B slowly these days. He doesn’t have the energy to hop two at a time like he usually does.
“What are you saying, exactly?” David says, indignant. “That I’m lying about being tortured?”
A chinook is a helicopter.
“I see your point, although I do want you to keep that earlier statement in mind. I want you to remember that John’s life is not your sole responsibility. He’s an ex-soldier, he’s been working with you for years, and he's not worse for wear for it. You’re the one who seems to be taking the brunt of the beatings, to be honest.”
Sherlock finally directs his full attention to Billy’s words, the seemingly ordinary piece of information causing him to frown. Of course Alison would buy David a phone - who knows if David even had one when he left for Afghanistan, and even if he did, it’s long gone. But If Alison had bought David a phone, it means she doesn’t know about the one David had purchased for himself earlier that week at ASDA. David had bought it with cash—cash Sherlock isn’t sure how he’d got, and clearly, he’s hiding it from Alison.
John, who for some reason looks more miserable with every passing day.
John turns to look at Sherlock again, emotional.
Finally acquiescing, the man turns around without a word and John sighs in hopeful relief, following him as he steps out the door.
“Do I?” John blinks once, then again. The sentiment, coming from Sherlock, is lovely and unexpected. It’s also incredibly incorrect. How could anyone, let alone the world’s only consulting detective, possibly mistake John Watson to be
, task,” Sherlock says. “Rory’s about your size and build. It was only logical to practice the steps with him first.”
“True,” Saul nods. “And I personally offered your government to take him off their hands. He’s fucking brilliant.”
“That’s really neither here nor there, is it?” John asks, sounding positively unconvinced.
John nods.
“When was the last time you ate?”
“Were you ever going to tell me?”
She’s not innocent. He thinks about the words she said yesterday; berating him for not visiting enough. Why would he visit if that is how he’s greeted when he does? But that disconnect is a result of years of miscommunication. By this point, anything they choose to say to each other is the wrong thing.
The elderly neighbour across the street moves to his own window dragging one leg after the other, slowly, slowly. The man draws an old, sturdy chair behind him and settles in it, nodding at Sherlock—
It’s another email from Mrs. Poole, with a video attached. He sneaks a glance up to John’s room and clicks play.
“I think Aldridge knows more than he lets on,” John says. “You should have seen David’s face when he walked in. He looked like he was looking at a ghost.”
“Not a big drinker.”
Sherlock gently tilts his head as he speaks, shrugging helplessly.
If John had ever thought he’d seen Sherlock Holmes looking his best, he had been completely wrong. This stunning creature is the best thing he has ever laid his eyes on.
“Good,” Mycroft nods. “Very good. Mummy’s so very excited over the prospect of company this year.”
“You alright?” He asks quietly, out of Mrs. Holmes’ earshot.
“I can’t say.”
“Recognition confirmed.” Edwin says to the microphone, then turns to David again. “This man’s name is Yasser Khoury. He was captured last week and brought here for further investigation.”
“Yeah! You remembered.” She says, probably only half-joking. “How’ve you been? Haven’t seen you since you left for uni.”
“Alright,” Mycroft says suspiciously.
"That I was upset. That I was scared, and.." John stuttered.
John hears Sherlock grinding his teeth before he speaks. “I came back, John. didn’t I?”
Today, she arrives with a surprising offer.
He shakes his head in astonishment at his own libido. He needs to get a grip. He must and he will, he thinks resolutely.
“Whatever do you mean?” Mycroft asks.
“A conversation between me and Gabriel. That he mistook for something that it wasn’t. I swear.”
, hard and fast. He couldn't deny it if he wanted to.
Sherlock shakes his head. All are silent, letting the words sink in.
“Well,” she says, looking at Sophie with narrowed eyes. “Could be interesting, I suppose. A photogenic war hero, a blushing English rose for a wife...”
” John murmurs, the word barely audible even to his own ears.
John has Rosie in his lap at the kitchen table while they’re talking. Rosie is fascinated with Sherlock’s voice as he’s telling her stories about the animals he met in his travels, the old woman who gave him food despite not having a home of her own (
“I see.” James says, his voice a mix of worry and disappointment. “I’m sorry. I… well, I understand.”
“What’s he got to do with any of this?” she asks. “I thought he left for Eastern Europe.”
In the week leading to Sherlock’s departure, John had worked very hard on himself to let go. That was clearly what Sherlock needed and wanted. John thought they’ve been making progress but this is a two-step-back phase. It hurts, but it is what it is and John promised Sherlock that it’s OK for him to go do what he needs to do.
He has to stop talking because John is laughing like an overjoyed idiot.
“No, not according to my asset,” Sherlock says. “He helped me find you in the first place. He had no reason to lie.”
"I still have a long way to go, John," Sherlock says. "David and I have an appointment later this week. He says to not assume everything is magically solved now that we're... this."
, he thinks.
“But?” John asks. “You don’t sound very convinced.”
It’s fucking glorious.
“Five years. I was his physical therapist, that’s how we met. He'd had a few other physical therapists before and he never liked any of them but he took a liking to me. I’d come over a few times a week. He was all alone in this big mansion of his. He was... lonely. He barely even wanted me there, he hates physical therapy. I worried about him, you know. I thought he was a wonderful man. We became friends and over time he started smiling. Telling jokes. He used to say I saved him from himself.”
Sherlock wakes mid-dream two days later, disoriented and sweaty; unsure what had pulled him out of the land of sleep with such determination. He teeters between waking and dreaming, rain pattering outside his window.
“Well they’re quite boring, these two, aren’t they?” Billy complains. “I think the more important question is, when‘re you gonna buy me an iPhone?”
“I know I will.” Sherlock says.
“I’m not—”He moves to take a sip from the mug but his hands are shaking, and he spills tea on the front of his shirt. “Fuck. Fuck!”
he shakes his head.
“Oh.” Mrs. Poole's cheeks turn slightly red, looking between the two men in front of her. “This isn't about a case.”
John shakes his head, confused. That answer means absolutely nothing. “But is he alright?”
They’re not a couple - it’s not a lie, but there was always a bitter aftertaste to the words when he spoke them. Sherlock had never said the same words himself, had never agreed or disagreed. Never berated him or nodded in agreement. He just let it hang in the air, his reaction open for interpretation.
“Like hell he does.”
“What?” Mycroft and Sherlock exclaim simultaneously.
“And you brought me out here…” David points at the empty car park.
Despite
“Who was that?” Alison asks David, off-screen.
John feels a lump in his throat that won’t go away as he moves to remove Sherlock’s phone from his frozen hand. He calls Rosie’s minder to explain the situation. She understands and offers to stay through the night if needed. John thanks her profusely, happy to have one less thing to worry about.
, he wants to reproach her.
James sends a sad, crooked smile in response to the pleasantries.
Of course. David isn’t talking to Sherlock Holmes right now. He’s talking to Peter Knight, the heroic intelligence agent.
“Just looking for a mate.”
“Did you say everything you wanted to say?”
Sherlock stares at the photo for a beat. John sees his face rearranging itself into a well-composed, regal disinterest. His eyes, though, they’re wide and round at the sight.
“Why?” Lestrade’s eyes narrow even further.
“Where does Mary think you are?”
“I know.” Sherlock croaks, admitting defeat. “I know. I didn’t know what else to do. She-”
Sherlock sighs a suffering sigh at the irony. “I’ll give you an extra fifty if you promise to shut up for the rest of the ride.”
Sherlock tilts his head and twists his face. “What is ‘
“It’s just… I just wanted a change of setting, you know. I missed this. You and I on the road together; me chasing you around.”
“Dr. Watson, are you joining us too?” Dr. Williams asks, hesitant.
Y'all ready for some Mrs. Holmes?
Elin has led him to one of the most unexpected locations in the city. There she stands, at the bottom of the Edwardian building, close to the entrance of the London Aquarium.
Mercifully, Rosie perks up at the sound of her name and directs the room’s attention fully at her. “Me!” She calls as she jumps out of John’s lap towards Sherlock, who picks her up.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his brother’s frankly disturbing theatrics. “Afraid of what?”
Dust particles drift in slow motion in front of John's eyes, the rest of the world swallowed up in the sound of his heartbeats, loud as a drum line.
“Me?” John croaks, surprised. “No, never. Surgeons are never sent that deep into the country. Too dangerous to lose medical personnel in heavy battle.”
Sherlock smiles nervously. “He’s not really my type, John.”
Except for Sherlock, it would seem.
“It means you’re asking too many questions.” She opens the door, her face gone steely again. “Are you alright?”
Sherlock looks down, surprised by John’s perception of his intention on their ride back here.
"I can't stay here," John said and swallowed a lump in his throat.
“Right,” John says, working very hard to tamp down his anger. “No, you’re right. She’s just my daughter. Why would you bother to take the time to meet her?”
“Indeed. Let’s go find dogs.” Sherlock smiles and nods to John, tipping his head towards the door.
“Make sure his back pay is held back for now but give me a line of credit for money to offer him instead,” Sherlock says. “It’ll help me gain his trust.”
“What’s up with sunshine over there?” Lestrade yells back, jutting his chin towards the back of the room. “Not a Michael Jackson fan?”
He leaves the capital city and goes back to his hideout, away from the main streets. Eva had sent him here in vain. They were hoping to prove that the lion’s share of Moriarty’s money laundering operations was done right here, in these streets. By the time he landed the entire operation was... gone.
“What?” John’s smile wavers at the ice in Sherlock’s voice.
“John, the case.”
“Good to have you back.”
“I suppose it is.”
Sherlock is the one blinking now. “What?”
Sherlock swings his leg with a wearied sigh, bored with this charade.
An angry sniff.
Mary’s been counting too. He can see it in her eyes, narrow and begrudging. She rocks a groggy Rosie in her arms and steps into the kitchen without a word.
“You did,” Edward nods. “However there’s been a significant development in our investigation into your capture.”
“Have you seen him recently?” Lestrade asks eventually.
“I think something doesn’t add up.” Sherlock clarifies.
“Who knows what might happen if the Egyptians send them back to Gaza without you,” Sherlock continues. “Someone might notice you’re not with them. One person in particular. Abu Nazir. Who, as you and I both know, is an extremely…
“Do you remember his name?”
start a new life together. Couldn’t keep your hands off each other.”
“Jesus,” he says out loud even as he feels the heavy weight of resentment leaving his body, leaving him a thousand times lighter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ouch.” John mumbles and looks at Sherlock whose face is, as usual, nothing short of inscrutable. “So, erm, how about briefing me about him? Any thoughts about how you’d like me to run into him?”
All the work he’d done to distance himself from Sherlock, from his memory, wiped clean in one second today when he stepped into Mycroft’s office and laid his eyes on him.
Sherlock sighs with frustration. Of course, he won’t have eyes on the one room that seems to be actually important.
“I- I don’t know, to be honest. But things between Mary and I are… bad.” John says. “It’s been hard. And sometimes I worry if one day all of these secrets will come back to haunt her. Us. I need to know my options.”
. As if
“Acclimation training?” David snorts. “You know what they said in acclimation training? They told me the name of the current Prime Minister and the price of bread. Do you know what they didn’t tell me? That everyone had moved on. That all of my mates now have children and careers, and all I do is remind them of some ancient time in their life they'd rather forget.”
“John, can you talk about Mary’s time away from London?” David asks.
John feels like he has been slapped in his face. Hard. He laughs with incredulity, plants his face in his hands.
“Sherlock, it sounds like you feel like you’re solely responsible for John’s safety. Is that correct?”
“I’ll need your therapist's details, as well as your lawyer’s, the one who visited you on Sunday. When was the last time you spoke to Alexander?”
“Having great doctors is never the same as having a loved one with you in the hospital. You were hospitalized, you ought to know that yourself.”
Molly’s talking to Sherlock outside, Rosie balanced on her hip. Before she went out the door, she pleaded with John to change his mind, but John’s heart is hard as a rock these days.
“Did you serve as a sniper in Afghanistan?”
“Yes, you would.” Sherlock turns his resigned gaze at him. “And I wouldn’t be able to live with that, John. And neither would you.”
“Sulman Abu Nazir is a cruel, cunning mastermind responsible for some of the worst terrorist attacks the world has known this past decade; he has the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands,” Edwin continues, cold and calculated. “If Stewart was sent home to execute one of his schemes on British soil, I can assure you it’s bound to be a horrific one. I will not let that happen on my watch.”
John stares quietly at the river, biting his cheek.
“Yes, Yes. More.” He begs stupidly and they begin to rock into each other, harder and harder. Sherlock spreads kisses on his neck, on his jaw. He grabs John's hair gently and tilts his head to lick a spot right below his ear.
Just like old times.
“Maybe.”
“Mycroft?” he says, his voice high and shrill.
(He perks right up with the new sensation underneath the crispy-white thin fabric).
“We’re closed, ma’am,” says an usher standing next to the entrance.
Sherlock spears him with a sceptical look.
“One can only hope.”
“Mary doesn’t want you eating out,” Sherlock says, and John has to shake his head to remind himself that Sherlock is very rarely aware of double entendres, no matter how unfortunate they are. “You still have those extra four pounds to lose if you want to get into that suit.”
It changes absolutely nothing.
John nods and adds “And Rosie.”
He’s not sure he’d stop her if she did.
“See you later,” John calls behind him, his shoulders slumped.
“So.” She moves as though looking behind his shoulder conspiratorially. “Is Dr. Watson with you?”
John’s face sobers up. “You are coming back, though. Right? I wish you did. I miss you.”
This time it’s John who lets out a bitter laughter. He closes his eyes in frustration.
“Like what?” He turns to face her, returning her challenging glare. “Like
“Sherlock..” John says, leaning forwards in his chair towards the other man. “Sherlock, come on. You said so yourself. He was hiding it. He’s a quiet man. I barely remember hearing him speak. There
“Nothing I haven’t seen before.” Rory shrugs. “Was a Park Ranger myself back home. Takes a lot to surprise me. Ever been to Australia, Dr. Watson?”
, a small voice whispers somewhere in the back of his brain.
“D’you know what the intel officers told me when I came back?”
“God, I fucking hated her. Good.” John says, thrusting his cock further into Sherlock’s hands, urging him for more. “Good. Because you’re mine. No one will ever touch you again, do you hear me?”
Sherlock stares at the screen, wide-eyed.
"John?"
“Oh, don’t get me wrong, dear,” Mrs. Norbury says. “Those Holmes brothers are a menace, but here’s a little something I’ve learnt from experience, and it’s proven itself yet again just this morning. When it comes to those two, it’s best not to waste your energy. They think they’re so clever, but given enough time, enough temptation, they’ll always end up their own worst enemy.”
“There’s somebody here to see you,” she says apologetically.
Sherlock turns to look at him.
John looks at Sherlock and speaks. “My biggest regret is that you never saw her for whom she really was before we got married.”
“That’s—” John starts without looking up.
Sherlock is the most calculated man when he wishes to be, but Rosie is an exception. When he looks at her, John gets a glimpse of what an adoring Sherlock looks like. He wishes he could be on the other end of that look of adoration one day.
Now that Part I is over, I'd like to once again thank my wonderful betas for being a part of this (admittedly) long, convoluted journey. I've taken on the task of writing a complicated story about a conflict I was never a part of, soldiers from countries I'm not a citizen of, in a language that certainly isn't my native tongue. They're the ones who make this story readable and presentable despite the 'artistic freedom' I present them with when it comes to verbs, tenses, idioms and English grammar in general :)
“Alright, Alright. But just—” Lestrade swallows, then nods. “You know what they say about the road to hell, yeah?”
It feels like time stopped here. It probably did, the minute William dropped to the floor without a word.
“Do you agree?”
Alexander moves swiftly and stands in front of Sherlock, as if ready to take a bullet in his stead.  Sherlock stands frozen with his hands up.
“I—” Sherlock chokes on his words. He should say something—
John's hands refused to disengage, balled at Sherlock's sides.
Dismissed, John picks a sleeping Rosie up and heads for the bedroom.
“Well thank God I did!” David sputters angrily. “He's been hot on my trail this entire time. Had surveillance on me for weeks! Did you know—” She stops him mid-sentence, signalling him to lower his voice. “Did you know?”
“It doesn’t work that way. They don’t accept individual complaints.”
“From me?” John asks and Sherlock nods. “By whom?”
“I just…” John starts too but drifts away. He turns to look back at Sherlock, a pleading mixture of questions and answers in his eyes. Sherlock's chest turns to stone at the sight of that, his head swirling with a dizzying wave of sympathetic pain.
Sherlock squirms in his chair, surprised. “Your sister called?”
“Is that legal?”
“You may come in now.”
John is nervous when Sherlock connects to their first call from Argentina.
I hope you enjoyed this, despite the sad, open-ended conclusion. There's a lot of sadness, hurt and betrayal in the Mary-John-Sherlock triangle, much more than the show could handle in my opinion. Canon reaches a level of heartache that very few people and relationships can bounce back from in real life.
The thought materializes of its own volition in his mind. He has to stop it before he utters it. He can’t move back to Baker Street. He’s a father now. A husband, still.
“I… I didn’t delete it as much as…” Sherlock stops, unsure of how to continue. John sighs in understanding.
“He’s here,” John whispers as he leaves the car, making his way behind David into the small community centre. He’s still a few steps behind him when David enters the meeting, hesitant. John can sense the change in the atmosphere of the room immediately—all eyes are turned to David, as people whisper and gawp at him over coffee and pastries.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Not much time left for thinking, Sherlock. We’re down to practicalities. Wiggins?”
“Sherlock, how would you explain missing essential parts of her identity?”
“Shortly after her husband committed suicide.” Mycroft says. “She was naturally preoccupied. The tip was examined by Mrs. Norbury and passed on to Lady Smallwood later, but seeing as there was no real actionable information in it, it was left untouched until both the Mossad and DGSE reached out to us. They began hearing a similar rumour themselves and notified us.”
“When you return heroically from nine years of enemy hands.” Sherlock rubs his eyes, sore and tired from hours on end of reading. Pages and pages of inane, meticulous, detailed intelligence reports from the months prior to David and Jonathan’s capture.
Overwhelmed, Sherlock looks ahead in an attempt to diffuse the tension.
John looks down at the table again, feeling the weight of the words hitting him.
“But you’ve known about the necklace for a while.” John speaks tightly, his voice cracking.
It’s definitely Sherlock—who else could it be? But everything about him is just plain foreign. He’d thought he’d seen Sherlock in every condition possible during their time as flatmates; anxious, sleepy, letting his hair grow long, cutting his curls too short. In sleepwear and robes and towels and his tailored suits. But never this.
Sherlock nods.
“How long…” Sherlock’s uncle asks.
David hunches forward on the table, moving fractionally closer to him. Sherlock feels John’s instinctive movement as a result, becoming alert.
And it’s then that John’s brain rebels in the face of whatever fresh hell this situation is, because -
Mrs. Norbury squirrels back to stand behind Edwin. “I think we have everything, sir.”
Sherlock’s tall figure freezes at the question. He clears his throat and turns, scanning John’s face in that way he always does when he can’t be sure what sort of trouble he’s got himself into. “John?”
“Sounds about right,” she huffs, amused. “They were a useless bunch, the lot of them,” she says, booting up her laptop. “Would that be all, Mr. Noor?”
While Mycroft and Sherlock exchange worried glances, several phones in the room chirp simultaneously.
“Yes, and by the time I get a response John’s unborn child will be old enough to drive.”
Everything is in motion. Only the last piece of the puzzle remains.
He stops again, choking on his words. Because this was the heart of the matter, wasn’t it?
“Alright. Then I have to tell you this because otherwise, it’ll be on my conscience. I read his file, Sherlock, and it doesn’t look good-”
“Right. See you.” Lestrade says and hangs up.
“Working.”
They spend the rest of the ride silent, unable to look at each other in fear of saying anything else.
“And what does that entail? Slides? Speaker notes? Perchance, solving a classroom murder?” John teases.
He reads the email quickly, wordlessly; there’s a paragraph ending with a link, a photograph of the necklace, and an apology. After a short glance at the Facebook group she’d sent him to, he straightens ominously in his chair, his body humming with a hint of dread.
The other three are surprised by his gesture but cooperate nonetheless.
Inhale With Ease by Vulpesmellifera is another (current) WIP. TST canon divergence with a premise that had no other chance but to hook me in immediately: Covid-19 + Victor Trevor + Jealous John, ooohhhh! I know right? Go and read it now :)
“Was it?” David asks, looking deep into John’s eyes. “Was it really? Was it worth your injury? Your job? The life you had before you left?”
“Why?” Sherlock asks, twitching his nose in mock disgust.
“I’m not
“I’m sure you do.” He knows Sherlock is slightly uncomfortable about it, but he’s thankful for the conversation he and Mrs. Holmes had earlier. She knew what she was doing by talking so openly with John; she was sending a message. He wasn’t about to deny her that.
“It’s unfair, is what this is,” John says pointedly. “Not like they can speak for themselves.”
“Oh, right, right.” John chuckles in a mock apology.
“John.” Sherlock calls him, still in his chair. There’s no sign Sherlock had moved at all since he’d dozed off again, the warmth of the bed enveloping him. “John, wake up.”
Sherlock had volunteered to pick Rosie up from nursery; he didn’t want the two of them to leave for an overnight stay without settling her in with Mrs. Hudson. Now he's asking Mrs. Hudson to watch over her before even saying hello to John.
“If that means she’ll take you back, then yes.” Sherlock admits cooly, knowing full well he’s adding fuel to an already flaming fire.
He loves her so much. It’s so good to put a smile on someone’s face.
“Is your husband staying with her?” she asks and Mary nods. “I’m sure they’ll be fine. He’s good with her, isn’t he?”
“Research,” he says.
“Alright,” Sherlock concedes. He appreciates clear instructions if nothing else.
“Can you…” He pleads. “You can touch me, Sherlock. Please.”
“Well, it’s not your decision to make.” John straightens his back in defiant petulance. “You can’t force me to go back to her. I’m not doing that.”
“Good.”
—but he’s too slow. Rosie's whimpers steal her father’s attention away.
He sighs and steals a glance at the telly. Breaking updates have been coming in all morning about a British POW found alive by NATO and Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, right on the border with Egypt.
“But never in London.” Sherlock says more than asks. John finally realizes what Sherlock is asking.
“Do you, now?”
They find Sherlock in the sitting room and Mrs. Hudson joins John in serving dinner and the cake. It’s a quiet affair. They’re eating slowly, charmed by Rosie’s babble.
Lestrade eyed him up suspiciously.
“Good.” Sherlock nods at first, then his face twists in contemplation. “Is that good?”
“Come on mate, you know how much the civilians were suffering,” John says. “That alone was worth a war.”
John wouldn’t go back happily, but there is a baby. He’s a good man, a man who keeps his word, and he wouldn’t have felt comfortable neglecting a child.
“John, are you familiar with the murder of Sister Sofie Novák?”
As John runs, he sees Sherlock move swiftly to grab the gun and drag a weeping Alexander away. He wordlessly follows Sherlock and Alexander around, sticking as physically close to Sherlock as possible.
“It… it was a complicated day.”
Priya’s face falls at that.
“What did you say?”
“Dr. Watson, Sherlock’s been telling me that you have some grievances about various aspects of his therapy.”
“You don’t need to be invited, dear. This is your home.” She says.
.” He says mischievously.
“What?” John asks in shock. "Are you sure?"
“Wait, Sherlock, look!” Mrs. Hudson tuts, pointing to a box by the fireplace. “He might need that. You go on, don’t let him go without it. I’ll take care of this one here.”
Harry is the administrative manager at John’s surgery. He’s a bulky, six-foot-two mountain of a man; an ex-security guard working at the surgery to finance his nursing education. In the days before the bullet and the wedding, when Sherlock would visit the soon-to-be Watsons at their workplace, Harry had the tendency to ogle hungrily at Sherlock in a way that made Mary smirk knowingly and John clear his throat incessantly.
“Look at this view, Sherlock. It’s gorgeous.” He says and unbuckles the seat-belt and nods towards the cliff. “Come on, just for a little while.”
“Oh,” John says.
Last week I shared
Surprised, he takes the call. Sherlock’s camera is in selfie mode and his face is blurry with motion.
Rosie, her eyes bluer than blue, considers the man with a wide, curious glare. Whatever test she gives him in her young, developing mind, Saul Berenson seems to pass with flying colors. Mycroft, however, gets immediately frowned at.
They had both left each other so many times, misguided and wounded. They've paid their dues. They can finally be what they always really wanted to be.
He was happily surprised: most are single or widowed dads from the area, all needing a bit of adult time in their day. There are some interesting blokes in the group, and he tries to actually make at least one meaningful conversation every time.
The items begin to appear to Sherlock as he squints his eyes.
“Are you sure?”
“No one said you were, but that still doesn’t explain why you won’t listen to what he has to say.”
“I’m going to need you to explain this to me, Sherlock, because from my side of things this looks… bad. This obsession...” John says, his gaze in search of Sherlock’s eyes. “The surveillance. Sending me off on these idiotic assignments, tracking his every move like he’s—”
,” Sherlock says. “He’s an opportunistic, narcissistic liar. A man as intelligent as Abu Nazir must only have taken one look at him to realize what had fallen into his lap, so to speak. Frankly, he’d fit in very well amongst your lot.”
“...Sherlock?”
“He’ll want to meet up as soon as possible,” she says. “When you do, you’ll tell him what a big fan of the Home Secretary you are, and how honored you’ll be to meet with her. He’ll have a meeting arranged with her in minutes, and we’ll proceed from there as planned. Are you listening?”
“I did tell him. He said we should wait a bit more, let them take effect.” James says.
“Yes.”
“That’s why you chased that fucker Moriarty, isn’t it?” John taunts him. “Because he
“Here I was, sniffing around you like an idiot, giving you all this
“It’s what I do, John. That’s the work. That’s
“So?”
“Right. Right,” David muffles distractedly. “What’s so dangerous about it?”
And just as Sherlock contemplates the answer to
“Fuck you, Mycroft.” John spits, his body changing swiftly into combat mode.
“I dunno, attic stuff. Why?”
” Billy moans.
“She’s packing,” Sherlock says, sitting down. “She’s been packing and unpacking for days. Gathering the strength to leave him, I think.”
“Sholto invites you to dinner on the day of his divorce and turns up in bed with a dead man not 48 hours later. I find that a bit suspicious.”
Sherlock watches him with a measured side glance. “She was all you talked about in Gaza.”
“For all his faults, Mycroft, of which there are many,” Edwin tells a sighing Mycroft as the car leaves the kerb, “he’s brilliant.”
“Look, I’m sorry, I had no idea you were in this group,” John says.
do it?” She asks. “You’re a widower. And with a small child to raise, no less.”
“No one will have to know. You can make up the story as you'd like; ‘Poor, brave Mary Watson. Her past came back to haunt her’.” Mrs. Norbury tuts again. “Although, what do you imagine he’ll say when he arrives in London and finds that you ended up marrying somebody else?”
“Are you sure you’re alright?” John inquires again.
Every inch of Sherlock’s body itches with foreboding when it comes to her.
“Do you know this man?” Sherlock asks and pulls David’s photograph out of an envelope that’s been sitting on the table. “Yes, you do. You know him well. You were his guard.”
get home. Whatever... whatever's going on in the cabin, he's not invited. He knows this rationally, of course, but he also knows that he would raid it if he thought Sherlock was there under duress.
“It really wasn’t as terrible as you seem to make it.” Sherlock looks away. “A brush of bad luck, running into a wrong crowd in Serbia.”
“Yes, I know.” Mycroft sighs. “Sherlock?”
“You know what I mean, Sherlock. Yeah?”
“Rachel—”
Sherlock sighs, dizzy with want. He whimpers with a sense of loss when John moves his crotch away.
Sherlock returns three hours later, stinking of cigarettes and his shoes dirty with mud. Thankfully, it seems his mood had subsided enough to ask John for another cup of tea and agreeing-by-silence to visiting the village centre.
Rosie considers this and nods her head thoughtfully as if she also thinks it's a great idea. He buckles her in her car seat and starts driving and planning the rest of his day. If Sherlock turns out to be alive after all, they’ll stay for an hour or so and discuss their plans for the week. Then they’ll go back to their flat so he can meet the minder. He’ll have to leave for his dinner with James by 7:30 pm at the latest. A tight schedule, but he can make it work.
“Yeah,” is all John says, used to being an open book.
Sherlock can’t help the hint of a bitter curl to his lip at the question.
The other man hums in confirmation.
"Fine, we’ll go." Sherlock yelled from his seat on the sofa, loud enough for Lestrade to hear him over the phone.
“Not sure,” Lady Smallwood says, her voice turning into an excited whisper. “I was told the Duke of Edinburgh requested a private meeting with him afterwards.”
“I imagine nothing can be fixed now. We’re both too old and too stubborn. But now that Will is gone… he was the one who kept us all together. And I… I might be gone any day now myself. It breaks my heart thinking my boy will never really know how sorry I am. How much I really do love him.”
“Be careful?” Sherlock looks back, surprised. “What on Earth are you on about?”
John steps into the kitchen in the early morning, finding Sherlock slouched over his laptop on the kitchen table, his fingers steepled at his chin.
“Happy Birthday!” the waiter chirps at Sherlock in a cheery voice.
“I like it,” John says, wiping his face. “The beard.”
“Ah,” John nods, pleased with the revelation. “Pirates.”
“I don’t like any of this. This is bad,” he starts and points at Sherlock. “You going off the grid like that, and you,” he points at Mycroft, “you, running him unofficially. I’ve seen this before. You cocked something up, or you’re about to.”
“Your performance last night begs to differ.”
“Of course.” John says.
“How does one do that?” he asks, the alcohol rendering him far too curious on the subject than he’d care to admit.
“Guess who rang me on my way back.”
“I don’t—” John says. “I don’t know. Probably… probably not. Depends.”
It’s pouncing time.
“She’s dangerous. She’s allowing us this…my recovery. It’s some sort of show of remorse. But she’s waiting for you to come back, and you have to. She shot me once and she will again if she gets the slightest sense of anything like this... A kiss...”
“A daughter,” John says again, as though it’s the first time he’d heard the word. “My daughter.”
“Oh, dear.” She says, lowering her eyes to the table.
Sherlock shakes his head.
“Rrmmmm!”
Alexander nods weakly.
“No, we were never.” John shakes his head. “He wasn’t interested.”
Not available tomorrow. -SH
Sherlock’s supposed to smile, be happy that John offers his help. Instead, he’s looking down at his hands.
He smiles, surprised.
“What? That my life is in danger?” David asks sourly. “Care to elaborate?”
Aldridge slouches slightly, some of the tension leaving his body. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
A short while later, John wakes up as Sherlock grumbles over David disappearing into the attic. Disoriented, he glances at his watch—almost midnight—and shakes his head before resuming reading.
In his hands, John held two large duffle bags. His shoulders slouched with a mixture of shame and guilt.
Sherlock takes a big breath, his nose tickling with the cold air as it enters his nostrils.
“Nathan Black’s murder was an attempt to frame you.” Sherlock begins. “Gabriel and Alexander used to be an item shortly in their school days. Gabriel still had feelings for Alexander when your relationship began and he agreed to treat you in order to gain access to your lives. Gabriel was the one who encouraged you to discuss the terms of your marriage agreement with him present, didn’t he?”
“Yes, love. Just like that.” He pleads and licks a soft spot on his neck. “That’s beautiful. Come for me, Sherlock. Please.”
James just shakes his head, tears forming in his eyes, and turns to walk away wordlessly.
He watches the car passing him by, every cell in his body boiling with a mixture of fear and suspicion. Before he knows it, his body moves of its own volition, following David’s car.
“So according to the autopsy report, James’ fingertips were indeed the only ones found on Nathan’s body. No other physical signs of distress or struggle. The death is indeed due to a broken neck.”
In what feels like a scene out of a sitcom, John and Sherlock discover they’ve
He texts Eva in response to her previous text, their agreed-upon codeword for inquiring about John Watson’s.. condition. Existence.
He finds John sitting at the kitchen table, clutching his head next to Sherlock's laptop. Stepping closer, he notices something else on the table.
“Halothane.” John and Sherlock say simultaneously as they read the results, taking the information in.
Sherlock mumbles to himself furious frustration, turning to leave the area as quickly as possible.
“What piece?”
John usually uses the small artificial tree he stole from Harry years ago; Sherlock, however, made it clear the Holmses insisted on a real, big tree every year.
“You’re…?”
“Corporal Stewart!” She calls him, and there’s a slight accent he doesn’t fully catch. “Don’t you think you have an obligation to tell the world what truly happened in Afghanistan?”
“Who says that?”
“I can’t
“Margaret.” He corrects himself as Mycroft turns to look quickly, suspicious of this new development.
“Mate, I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have said it like that had I known,” Lestrade apologizes.
“Christmas isn’t even a Christian holiday, John.” Sherlock twists his nose. “The pagans were the fir--”
When he turns to look ahead, he takes stock of his surroundings and narrows his eyes to recognize what he’s looking at. It’s the most outer edge of a vast, expansive farm, obviously maintained regularly by a farmer.
"The thing is, with Mary, I need help. I need… leverage. Between her and Sherlock, it's very hard for a man like me to find anything of the sort."
“This practice, it's in—”
, for one, to a lovely girl who doesn’t deserve any of this… if he is what you say he is, Sherlock, he’s dangerous. This is a man who confessed to killing his boyfriend, and we both saw the look in his eyes when he had you pinned to the wall in that cabin.”
“I thought it’d be for the best,” Sherlock says. “You and I, John, we chose this work, we’re well aware of the risks. But if anything happened to your daughter, to Mary—”
That’ll be the day,
“Yes, she did. I won’t belittle that. But let’s not forget her mother died immediately after returning from a months’ long leave of absence. She would have left again, Sherlock. She was never going to stay.”
Something happened.
“What?”
“Are you alright?” David asks.
“Any plans tonight?” Lestrade asks. Sherlock's eyes flit up in surprise. “Been saving these up for you,” he says, shoving a stack of dossiers in Sherlock's hands. “Thought you’d appreciate the one with the parrot.”
“Your dynamic during that period sounds very much like the one during Sherlock’s recovery,” David says and they both nod. “Was that for the same reasons we discussed? You felt the need to protect them?”
“In which capacity?”
John calls Sherlock.
Eventually he retires to his room, resigned and exhausted.
“Like what?”
“No!” David spits, his cheeks red with anger. “Bloody hell, no.”
“Yes, wonderful idea, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft says with a condescending smile as he pulls a small box from his inner suit pocket. He opens it up to reveal four identical memory sticks. “Whatever would we do without you.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer for a long minute, his eyes moving quickly from side to side in a pattern that John knows well enough; he’s reviewing information in his own head, trying to find an answer to a question.
“Seeing him jump off a building. Seeing him dead on a slab, shot by my wife. Seeing him coding on the floor. Seeing him so high that he doesn’t even recognize me.”
How is he supposed to be happy now, knowing everything Sherlock had sacrificed for him? His freedom, his body, his heart? How can he ever begin repaying Sherlock for all he’d done for him?
“There'd be barely any left by the time Mycroft had his way with them.” She says devilishly.
“I failed him as his mother.” She says and John looks away with pain. He’s not one to judge her, but from everything he’d seen so far she’s not so far from the truth. “But not because I didn’t love him. I did. I still do. It was just too much…”
“That was for my benefit?”
The case was solved by late afternoon, Lestrade at Sherlock's side as they chased Dr. Frankland through the thick forest. When Dr. Frankland blew up, Sherlock felt a slight relief. At least John was spared the sight of another bomb bursting into action.
“Hmm.” John murmurs and smiles a bit wider. His eyes search for Sherlock’s. “I’m sure they are.”
“That’s really the sort of thing you should be able to get access to under the Freedom of Information Act,” Lestrade says, moving uncomfortably in his chair.
“John—”
“Yep.”
The night air is cold, much cooler than in London. The wind flows freely among the sparse trees. He spots a few distant lights from cabins nearby, and hears hints of traffic from the main road.
"I was looking for new cases," Sherlock feigns innocence, playing along.
“I know.”
). It’s exactly what’s been missing.
When he does, John's breath catches at the sight of man’s back. Tracks on tracks of deep old scars, making his back look like the surface of the moon. There’s no mistaking what had happened to him. It was brutal, and repetitive, and inhumanly painful. John’s doctor brain recognizes the patterns, the depth, the absence of proper medical treatment.
“Yes, I know that, John!” Sherlock snarls, his patience thinning. This isn’t how this conversation was supposed to go, not at all. “I know she shot me, and unless you’d like your loving wife to do that again,
“How is that possible?” Mycroft asks. “He’d gone through at least four full body searches.”
David smooths his jacket nervously, thoughts of flashing lights filling him with dread.
He’s eating his lunch alone in the surgery’s meeting room right now, and he’s utterly miserable. He feels terribly lonely. He’d braced himself for a repeat of the way he felt when Sherlock was gone but it’s completely different. John always wished he could have been given a chance to talk to Sherlock before the fall, to convince him to stay or to let John join him.
“When have you
“Yes.” Priya says without batting an eye. “I’m a palaeontologist.”
“Was hit crossing the street by a driver with a history of heart attacks and a revoked license. He had his final heart attack at the wheel, killing them both on the spot.”
“How long do you think you’ll be able to pull this off?” Mycroft asks. “Live in that bolthole, like a ghost?”
John smiles tightly. “Yes, I think I do.”
“Don’t touch me!” David stands abruptly, kicking the chair from under him. He leaves the room and travels up the stairs to the bedroom.
Sherlock looks away, nervous.
He sneaks one last looks at the Cathedral, memorizing it. With thoughts and memories swirling through his mind he turns and walks towards the warehouse.
John takes a sip without a word. Sherlock registers the silence, turns to look at him with a frown.
From his seat on the floor the following Monday, with Rosie hanging off his arm, John’s eyes follow Mary fluttering around the flat all evening. They’ve been circling and avoiding each other all weekend, far more than usual, making a point not to be in the same room simultaneously.
He freezes, clearing his throat. “Never mind.”
He huffs and exchanges a knowing look with Mycroft before washing up in the small kitchenette. With his umbrella, Mycroft approaches the shower and knocks on the door.
“And I just caught you a serial killer, more or less." Sherlock said with his usual logic and determination.
He’d been somewhat detached from the case thus far, participating only as an observer, but the thought that some plot was hatched yet again to harm James is distressing. John has no idea what James is like as a husband or even as a friend, but he knew him well as a superior officer. The accident that took James’ soldiers’ lives was not his fault. He knows James well enough to know the man wishes every day he’d died that day with them.
“I suspect she’s an only child, as well as an orphan.” Sherlock nods, deep in thought. “I don’t think that part was a lie.”
“Can you tell me about it?”
Though Sherlock's sense of social constructs is quite loose and non-judgmental, he has no patience for babbling millennials.
Sherlock balances her on his hip and walks slowly and assuredly towards the other end of the kitchen. The outer wall, the one heading towards the backyard comprises a large, wide window, nearly the height of Sherlock’s body. The view is that of the outskirts of the small grove nearby.
“Why not?” Sherlock turns to look at him again, frowning in confusion.
Sherlock nods, clearing his throat. “Did you tell them anything?”
Menacing glares aside, Sherlock does as he’s told.
“That makes two of us, John.” Sherlock finally moves, shrugging his jacket on. “Thank you for helping. It’s been invaluable.”
“When did you learn of Palmer’s death?” Mycroft continues.
“Have I made myself quite clear?” Edwin demands, eyeing all three of them.
She waddles around the store, her big belly clearing the way for her
John watches Sherlock working his jaw, looking away; his own heart plummets to the floor, like a weight thrown carelessly. “Sherlock,” he says, his voice painfully raw. “You don’t have to do this. You’ve done more than enough for these people.”
If I disappointed anyone, I'm truly sorry. The Johnlock Endgame tag relates to the SERIES as a whole, and not this particular part of it. I hope you won't give up on this world I created and stick with it.
No wonder Sherlock isn’t attached to this place, he thinks. No wonder the man feels comfortable in mental and physical seclusion. This is how he was raised; in a bereaved household, under the pretension of normalcy that a small English village promises. But there is nothing normal about this family, in the most tragic of ways.
John shutter-blinks. “You’ll do that for me?”
,” he curses under his breath, refusing to acknowledge the scandelized mother of two who had just passed him by.
“Would you take pride in knowing that I’ve since learned it’s somewhat rude and unbecoming?”
For the sake of this story, I've decided that Sir Edwin is more senior than Mycroft and Lady Smallwood, though I'm not sure if that's true. In this story, he's the head MI6. The difference in seniority between Mycroft, Lady Smallwood and Edwin is very unclear in the show, so just go with it.

“John-” Sherlock says nervously, breathing hard.
“Mr. Holmes,” Jenkins cuts Mycroft short. “We really do need to focus on more specific questions relating to the Corporal’s memories of his period in Afghanistan. Are these questions critical right now?”
“We can’t do that. It’ll draw suspicion. The entire government is waiting for me to bring him back.”
“What is this about?”
things, things—”
“What, that’s it?” David asks. “The man tortured me, nearly broke me, and that’s all he gets?”
“I feed the ducks.”
And it just melted Sherlock’s heart.
“Yesterday proved to be quite unproductive, I’m afraid,” Mycroft says haughtily. “Not that I don’t enjoy watching you sulking into the cushions.”
“Can you?”
“That’s not true. There are professionals—”
“Look who’s up and about again!” Lestrade greets him far too loudly, drawing attention. “Welcome back, sunshine.”
In the video recording, Sherlock can see David turning back to look at Alison again. He sighs quietly and turns around. “We’ll see.”
“It’s appreciated, nonetheless. And we accept your apology.” She says and looks at Mycroft, sending some unspoken order his way. Mycroft nods with a pained grimace as if to signal he accepts John’s apology too, proving once more Mummy is the most formidable member of the clan.
“What?” Sherlock asks, exchanging a confused glance with John.
And yet.
Sherlock isn’t there when John wakes the next morning, alone in an empty room. If the man had slept at all, there’s no sign of it.
“No, guv. ‘M alright.”
"What do you think?" She puts her hand on her hips consciously, her hair still damp from the shower. "It's for the gala. Vicky said I could borrow it.”
” He texts back.
“Well, well, well,” Edwin says.
“Dad left when I was 12. Left her for… somebody else. Never saw him again, ever. She was heartbroken. Then she married my stepfather. I don't think she ever really loved him. Probably... felt like we needed a man in our lives, you know?”
“Is it?”
Then Sherlock showed up and left her no choice but to return.
“A Christmas gift, if you’d like.”
John thinks and nods to Sherlock, encouraging him. A moment later John sighs in pain; Sherlock’s cheek is rubbing against his own in search of warmth, of reciprocated tenderness.
“John?” David asks.
Sherlock left, and he had no intentions to ever come back.
Rosie had started screaming the minute her father had left her, admittedly limited, field of vision.
He’s still watching himself in the mirror ten minutes later, holding tightly onto the sink. When the world isn’t spinning around him anymore he takes his phone out.
“I’m sorry?”
James looks at John who shakes his head in agreement with Sherlock.
They mutually nod their way into an uncomfortable silence, avoiding each other’s eyes.
“Call him, or I will.”
“I’m just saying,” David says, quietly. “I didn’t feel lonely in Gaza. Did you?”
What wouldn’t a person tell himself in exchange for a clear conscience?
Sherlock heads for the door, ready to leave Khoury behind.
“Come to bed.”
She walks towards the nook that an unassuming usher had directed her to. Once she reaches a dead end—an obscure looking observation room—she doubles back; with her senses jumping to full alert, her head tilts in hesitant confusion.
“Ready?” He asks gently.
Gemma took one look at Mary on her first day and took her under her wing, no questions asked.
“Are you… are you considering it?”
“Have you ever been arrested?”
Sherlock tilts his head slightly, surprised by Lady Smallwood’s suggestion.
?” He finally spins towards him. “I’m not the one who brought these people into your life, John. Not Mary, not Lottie, and certainly not your father—"
“Yeah.” She says after a beat, her face inscrutable.
John chooses his words carefully. “That is... categorically untrue, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock’s choice.” John says. “Whatever he chooses is fine with me.”
, John thinks. He can feel the ground slipping underneath him.
James was a fine commander and didn’t deserve the hate he drew afterwards. The attempt on his life on John’s wedding day was horrible enough. If James is innocent in Nathan Black’s murder, and it looks like he is, he doesn’t deserve everything else he’s been going through since.
It’s a warm smile, bright. Her round cheeks glow pink in the chilly evening wind.
“I may have…” Sherlock clears his throat. “Thrown some things in there that I shouldn't have.”
(See the end of the chapter for
At first, he thought it was discomfort over the banality of it all—all the horrid details that make for wedding planning. It took him months to realize his discomfort was over the other two’s perfect harmony. There was a point where he couldn’t lie to himself anymore.
“This seat taken?”
“Alright. What’s your point?”
He stops for a moment to gather his thoughts, scrambling around now that he finally has a chance to talk, really talk, with Sherlock. This isn’t how he imagined their interaction upon Sherlock’s return; he’d expected a visit to Baker Street with Rosie, or maybe being called off on a case at a moment’s notice.
Sharp, dark eyes stare up at him. “Be my guest.”
their money; my family had more than enough. But that was what they were like. Altogether unkind. They didn’t like anyone but themselves, especially Ernie.”
“Cheers,” John smiles, offering his glass up in the air.
,” Sherlock snarls, shutting the door angrily. “And focus on finding the mole in your so-called ‘Secret Service’.”
Sherlock blinks just blinks. He looks to the ground without a word.
There are boxes and boxes filled with Sherlock’s stuff so John offered to help. Unfortunately, Jane from the surgery called saying they’re swamped, and would he mind taking a few video consultations after all?
(See the end of the chapter for
Placing the diaper bag on the changing station, she waits patiently for the other woman to leave the stall while bouncing Rosie.
John blinks angrily, taken aback. “Sherlock, come on—”
“I don’t want this.” Sherlock closes his eyes tightly again, his respiration quickening. “I can’t carry the weight of this, John. It’s too much and I don’t know that I’m... equipped for it.”
David thinks for a second. “Do you have many friends besides Sherlock, John? I know you have mutual friends, Sherlock mentioned. But other than the mutual friendships, are there others?”
“I canceled your lunch meeting with Martin—”
“A lie by omission is still a
John stops and goes back to Sherlock’s side.
“It looks nice. Nice colour.” He nods.
He’s a selfish, pathetic man.
John frowns in sympathy, blinking to keep his own eyes from tearing up.
An elderly woman sits on a bench with her back turned to her. The fluorescent jellyfish swimming above her make the woman seem small, almost fragile.
“I doubt that,” Sherlock says coolly, his expectations low. “They’re not idiots, they know they’re being watched. It’s just another piece of the puzzle.”
“Oi!” The man calls and raises his hands in the air.
“John said you were white as a sheet when you first saw him,” Sherlock says. “You thought he was dead, didn’t you?”
Christmas lunch is a small, subdued affair. They have enough food to go around and Rosie is entertaining as always but there’s tension all around; Sherlock’s never really comfortable around his mother, Mycroft is either busy on his phone or ignoring John (as ordered) and John is… he’s restless.
“Please, Dr. Watson,” Edwin says, pointing at a chair. Mycroft nods in reinforcement of the other man’s message. “We won’t take too much of your time.”
It’s an interesting case, in and of itself, though Sherlock doesn’t usually bother with cold cases going back decades. There are so many of them, and he finds it much more fulfilling to solve more current ones. There are still family members to provide closure for, perpetrators to look straight in the eyes.
“Stewart. What did he say to Khoury when he came in?”
He hates
“Henry said this might happen,” she says, rubbing his hands. “That you shouldn’t leave the house alone—”
He shakes his hand, signaling Sherlock to move. He notices Sherlock looking at him, then at the group behind them.
“So... it could have been a trap," John murmurs, finally catching up.
“Sherlock?” John tries again.
Lestrade starts, and John huffs in amusement when he notices Sherlock is moving his lips along him without a sound, expecting the DI’s next words.
“This is Tahir,” Sophie says, waving the man in. “Mr. Tahir Noor, the new Communications Coordinator.” Her next words are whispered apologetically. “Jamie’s on holiday.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” John chuckles when he notices the man is utterly flustered. “The scruff and the... It’s... nice.”
“That’s it?” John asks. “Just talk to him?”
like (for now) in the story.
“Nothing, nothing.” He swallows again. “Good night, Sherlock.”
“Then why are you still there?”
“It certainly wasn’t for mine.”
He makes a decision and speaks again.
She has no idea where to even begin to talk to John when they’re back in London, nothing pre-planned. She’s tired, wrung out from months of looking over her shoulder for danger. There will be conversations; long and difficult ones. They’ve barely managed to feel comfortable together following their reconciliation at Christmas. They both thought having Rosie around would make things better and it did, just a little bit. They were civil, at the very least. Sherlock had even taken a step back, as much as he could.
“Yes.”
“Because the man you spent the night with is a part of the problem,” she says. “Works for the people you swore you’d never work for again.”
“An asset?” Mycroft asks. “A Gazan asset?”
work, you know that very well by now.”
“Berk,” John whispers to himself and shakes his head profusely. “Bloody idiot.”
“Could you?” The woman lights up at the suggestion.
Of course the marriage isn’t perfect—it never could have been. It was doomed, cursed, right from the start, from the minute Mary snaked into John’s life under a false identity. But Mary, whomever she might be, loves him. She chose him.
“No, we’re not. We both agree on that. But you’ve never said that before. Was that another assignment?”
As quietly as possible, he sneaks back to the cabin, careful not to make a sound. Sherlock and David are wide awake, one of them wandering around the cabin.
“Well, he
Mycroft half-nods haughtily, staring down at Sherlock with tight lips. “I’d have thought you’d know everything by now.”
“Mummy.” Sherlock acknowledges her. “Watson.”
“I see.” John nods, seeing where Sherlock is going with that. “I can be the good doctor coming to his rescue.”
Sherlock's lips purse into a thin line. “John, why was your father imprisoned?”
John looks down.
John, in turn, looks at Sherlock.
“And I’ve got a little surprise for you.” Lestrade says and John and Sherlock lift their heads in surprise.
John looks at him as though it’s the first time he’s ever seen him. “What?”
So, John realizes, he’s shaken by the change in their unspoken agreement. The agreement states that John demands he's Not Gay and Sherlock says absolutely nothing about it. To be fair though, nothing of that sort has happened since Mary died, so it's been a while since he has given thought to this issue.
and obstruct much of his view. Carrying them from the car park was a challenge that demanded a good measure of coordination and side-stepping, to avoid bumping into unsuspecting pedestrians.
“So you say,” he acquiesces, disarmed as he is by the unexpected physicality tonight.
“Because he’s
John’s sad smile straightens in a split second. His heart twitches in pain. Is this what’s been eating at Sherlock this entire time? The dementia diagnosis was marked in Mr. Holmes' files as given nearly a year ago. So is this the reason behind the change in his character? Behind his more subdued personality these days?  Has he been upset over losing his father this whole time?
Sherlock opens his laptop, clicking through various folders, then finally presses the play button. The video reveals three women sitting together in a cozy but outdated sitting room. Mrs. Poole is on the right, staring at the camera as the recording starts. A female lawyer sits on the other side, clearing her throat. At the center of the frame sits a tall, elderly woman in her early seventies; she's frail-looking, but sharp-eyed.
“We need to get this under control, Sherlock, so let’s not dawdle,” Mycroft demands. “Why did you contact Corporal Stweart yesterday?”
Having abandoned his plans for reaching his destination on time, he was in no rush to get to the next destination. His contact, who was adamant about meeting outside of Turkey proper in fear of the authorities, expects at least another day’s delay. Their meeting point, a small restaurant near the Ermeni Manastırı, is less than an hour’s drive away. Sherlock has plenty of time to figure his current situation out, and he can walk there if necessary.
, he realizes. John’s not out there, drinking his tea or filling up the crossword puzzle or doing his various other John-things. Another shift? Surely not. John hates Fridays shifts. He listens more intently, hoping the man might still be there after all; Sherlock would be hard-pressed to admit to anyone but himself that it’s the silence, unexpected and unwelcome, that woke him.
He wants to tell him.
John’s hand never even touches the street door when it opens abruptly.
The man starts running towards Alexander, aiming his gun at him.
If there's a Regent's Park pastry expert in the audience who can offer a name for Sherlock's choice of chocolate-y goodness, let me know.
John sees Alexander from a distance, tense and worried but nodding his head in response.
He presses his lips together instinctively; a helpless nervous tic in the fight against the itch in his eyes and the burning in his throat. He turns to look at John over his shoulder, their eyes locked in wordless conversation.
“So?” She laughs.
“Mary, come on-”
“The clinic has rooms for four different therapists but only Gabriel’s is furnished and occupied. He’s the only one accepting patients here right now. There’s an expensive espresso machine but it’s broken and dusty. There are plastic water bottles next to it with plastic cups - a distinguished establishment like this will only offer that as a temporary solution until the espresso machine is fixed. But it hadn’t worked in months, never fixed or replaced since it broke down. I also caught a glimpse of Gabriel’s agenda on your screen. James is only one of two patients scheduled for the day.”
“No, but I have.. I haven’t been taking them consistently. Recently I’ve had heart palpitations and that scared me. I’ve been taking lower doses. I know that’s not advisable but my therapist had been out of the country and I couldn't reach him. That’s what I wanted to talk to John about.”
“All right,” John says, finally heading out the door. “I’ll be back after dinner. Don’t wait up.”
“Fair enough.” John smiles back.
“Is your name David Julian Stewart?”
“And eyes and ears in the Stewart residence, of course.”
Mycroft nods wordlessly.
“What’s that?” John asks.
He nods, touched by this unexpected turn of events.
“Barely even scratched the surface.” Sherlock mumbles in response.
You have no idea how scared I was posting this chapter as it contains the first-ever smut scene I ever wrote. I hope I did it justice.
“Oh?”
“Oh, good. Separated from the sofa this time, I see.”
“And that was it, I never heard from the police again. And then Lottie came back with this necklace, and… well, I don’t know what to tell you. That’s just too many coincidences.”
“What sort of information?”
David squints and shuts his eyes tightly, but that only serves to bring on a nagging whistling he can’t seem to shake off from somewhere in the distance, like a drone hovering over the building. He feels a throb of anxiety twisting somewhere in his lower belly, so he takes a deep breath, hoping to nip the panic attack in the bud.
“Yeah.” John says, not for the first time wondering about the Holmes’ opinions about Sherlock’s choice of career. “I can imagine.”
James’ jaw drops. He blinks at Sherlock for a long minute, processing his words, his threat. He looks at John, disbelieving.
“I’m sorry.” John says, surprised by the sad turn the conversation just took; he reads between the lines and realizes Priya’s father had passed at some point, too.
“Please, I insist.” She says. “He always bought the biggest tree, every year. You’re all set.” She says and looks at her assistant with a nod. “You’ll have it over at your house in an hour or two.”
“What do you mean, there wasn’t a place for you?”
There are smiles, and books and openness. Mrs. Parashar lost a son and a husband yet she welcomed Sherlock unannounced in open arms on Christmas Eve.
He freezes when he recognizes that voice. Turning around, he sees Sherlock leaning against Mycroft’s desk, his arms crossed.
“New details about Aldridge. It appears that for a short period of time after his return he became a part of
I cherish every comment, so please leave one! 💖
“You just said, ‘not Typhoo’.”
“Yes.”
"That's... heartbreaking." John says, his voice cracking. After everything James has been through... Gabriel ruined so many lives. Irrevocably. "Christ. Does James know?"
He stops by 221A to say hello to Mrs. Hudson, stalling for time. After a while, he goes up the stairs, opens the door quietly.
His stomach turned when he first laid eyes on him at the reception, but things turned… well, murder-y very quickly and John was distracted. By Sherlock, as usual.
“Dr. Watson,” Mycroft says, his voice tight, “Sherlock has just taken part in a very complicated operation. Every minute of his time will be accounted for over the next fortnight. He won’t be landing and coming back for tea with Mrs. H, I’m afraid. There will be debriefings, press events, medical and psychological evaluations. He’ll be required to account for every movement, every contact and detail he has accrued during his months away. His job isn’t over yet.”
“I lied.”
“No more than usual, John. Everything’s all right. Don’t--”
Sherlock nods obediently, turning on his heels with a swish of his robe.
“Hmm.” Sherlock hums, satisfied.
“What?”
John’s heart squeezes in sympathy at the thought.
Sherlock nods in agreement.
John slumps down against the bench defeatedly, because he has a pretty good idea what the man’s about to say next.
“She’s perfect.” John smiles proudly, relieved. “Quite big now. Will probably start crawling soon. The birth was… incredible, Sherlock. I wish you could have been there with me, it was…” He trails off. “I want you to meet her. I want her to meet her...” He stumbles over his own words, unsure what title he’s about to bestow on this man. “...erm, her Sherlock.”
. John makes his own decisions and walks his own path after much stewing and huffing and raging.
“Who’re
“What was he doing in the Middle East?” John asks. “You said he was going to Eastern Europe again.”
“No, Sherlock. He’s the one who hid the truth about Eurus from you. He’s the one who’s been lying to all of you for so long, and this is somehow your fault?” John asks and turns to Mycroft again. “You toss him around like it's a game. I’m the one left to pick up the pieces after you leave. How dare you!”
Sherlock clears his throat, looking down.
“We talked,” Sherlock says coolly. But John, ever loyal John, can’t help a huff. Mycroft looks between the two of them like an eagle honing in on its prey.
John grabs General Spencer’s business card from the man’s hand. “Oh, yeah. We know about that,” he says. “Guess he’s going for it after all.”
“Counsellors. Professionals.”
Ian barely ever uttered a word. Never asked any questions. It was a wonderful arrangement.
“It’s alright,” Elin says, stepping quickly to David’s side. “We’ll be right back. Corporal? Why don’t we…?” She nods her head toward the back of the room, placing a gentle hand of the small of his back.
“Done with what?”
John’s mouth stops mid-chew. “Nothing.”
“You should also know that he refused the presence of a lawyer, can’t for the life of me understand why.”
“And?”
John shakes his head in disbelief, his eyes sharp and knowing when he turns to look at Sherlock.
“So am I, Sherlock.” John says and stretches his hand again. “So am I. Come on.”
(Oh God)
“Oh. That’s weird,” Lestrade says, genuine surprise in his voice. “I’ll have to ask him next time I see him.”
“Yes.”
“What, Sherlock?” He asks but Sherlock doesn’t reply. “What is it?”
“Lady Smallwood doesn’t have a deputy.”
“So, er,” David stammers. “Have you given any thought to what we talked about last night?”
“You…” John brows furrow. “Which time?”
“I wish you’d trust me, Sherlock.” John sighs.“Really trust me. With your… pain. With your...”
“Rosamund Mary,” Mycroft says and all the oxygen leaves Sherlock’s lungs. “Let’s hope the name is the only way she takes after her mother.”
, you have an important announcement to make, so the floor is yours.” He gestures regally at the table.
Whatever it was that she saw in his eyes that moment he wasn’t sure, but within a split second Mary Watson was back.
“Her older brother, yes.” Sherlock nods but frowns as memories surface. “She should be around Eurus’ age, maybe a few months younger.”
Sherlock nods and looks at the clinic. “Business isn’t very booming, is it?” He asks.
“Alright, alright,” John stops him, not needing the full image. “So... you’re not... you’re OK?”
“Oh, forget it.” Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“Shhh, here,” she says calmly, taking the tea away and grabbing the edges of his shirt, pulling it up. “Take this off.”
“Yeah. And that’s exactly why you need a lawyer, Mr. Sholto.” Lestrade says, reproaching him.
“Thank you,” David says as he takes the seat offered to him.
. Like I have something to offer, some experience gained from sitting in a hole for nine bloody years.”
“He’s taken up running. Very early in the morning, in a park by his home. In the photo shoot he was quiet, didn’t talk much. Cooperative, obedient—ever the good soldier,” he says. “Found this in the sports jacket they loaned him for the shoot when he gave it back.”
Christ, Sherlock, John thinks. “Why didn’t you just tell me, Sherlock?” John blurts, unsure where to begin. “Wow. I’d have been more…”
“Hello, Watson.” Sherlock says, his low baritone causing Rosie to look his way. She squeals and wiggles out of her father’s arms and runs to Sherlock who picks her up without a word.
Sherlock picks his bag up and steps quickly to the sitting room, listening.
“Although I think mostly.. it took a while, but the words you said at the airport finally registered.”
He knows what that means.
“Right.” Lestrade nods, confused. “You wanna tell me what this is about?”
“Y..yeah.” Lestrade says carefully as he reads. “He was found by a maintenance crew in a room in a hotel near Paddington Station. Checked in on Monday night, was found earlier this morning. His ex-husband reported him missing. There was a body next to him in bed.”
“I called the police again and they came over. Told them the whole of it again. They took the rosary and said they’d look into it, but by that time Ernie was just… gone, if you know what I mean. All those suicide attempts left him brain so jumbled,  there was no point to any statement he might have been able to give them, anyway.”
he thinks, scanning his face up close. “Alright. Nadi.”
“Oh, John!” Mrs. Hudson laughs delightfully at the sight of him, bringing a hand to her chest.
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?” he says coldly.
A hint of a crooked smile ghosts Sherlock’s lips and John’s heart leaps.
“I thought nothing of it for a while after that. He helped me bring the baby home the next day, and I had four children running around to take care of. A couple of months later, Leonard and I were watching telly one night. They’d just found the nun’s body that day and the newsreader said the nun had gone missing on 21st November… and then it hit me. 21st November, that was the night they called and said we could pick Vera up from hospital. That was the night Ernie came back all bloodied up. I’m telling you, my stomach dropped.”
Brave John Watson - who invaded Afghanistan, who tackled James Moriarty in a pool, who’d been raising Rosie as a single father for all intents and purposes for months - fell prey to a group of busybody mothers. Their questions brought home the fact that he has so many life-altering decisions to make for his tiny daughter, that his wife left, and she’s not there to make those decisions with him. The realization landed on his head, heavy as an anvil. He found himself in the grips of a panic attack in less than an hour.
John’s not fine.
“Listen,” John clears his throat. “I’m sorry, of course I’m bloody sorry. I shouldn’t have said what I said, all right? I’m an arse, and you didn’t deserve any of it.”
“I think you’re doing yourself a disservice, John.” Sherlock says.
Sherlock can’t help but frown. “It’s not?”
That Sherlock is gone. He’s not sure where things stand with the current Sherlock. Every day passes with a semblance of their own brand of normal. They exist. They cling to each other. John has no doubt of his importance to the detective, but not a day goes by without John staring at the other man, wondering what Sherlock sees when he looks back at him. A chore? A commitment? A friend? A comforting part-of-the-furniture? A mix of them all?
“You’re all flushed. It’s lovely,” David says in a low voice, reaching out to squeeze his knee.
Sherlock waits for a beat, then calls out in the direction of the door.
“Christ,” John whispers. “Can you imagine, grieving him for so long, then suddenly—” He stops when he catches that train of thought. Sherlock throws him a wordless side glance.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock says. “Mostly Jordan and Israel. A short stint in Turkey and Syria. Mainly negotiations and following up on leads provided by assets.”
“The following Christmas, it was the year after the nun disappeared, Ernie gave me a rosary as a gift. A nice one, in a black velvet box. A bit out of his budget, but I thought nothing of it at first, until I opened it. Then I noticed there were initials on the clasp: 'Z.A.N'. I was just so insulted that he would give me something he must have stolen for Christmas. I threw it in a cupboard and forgot all about it.”
He’s been wandering the streets the entire evening, lost in thought, recalculating his next steps.
There are scattered claps from around the table. Sherlock nods his head in thanks, then stands up a bit too quickly. He has to grab John’s sleeve on his way up, clearly drunk. John thinks nothing of this until Sherlock grabs him by his shirt and crashes his mouth onto his. Sherlock kisses him sloppily, hungrily, for a good long minute.
, suffocating him more with every passing day, that made him not throw away a stranger’s phone number into a bin. Back then, he and Mary were just going through the motions, outright lying to each other. It was a life they both wanted but hated on a visceral level.
Sherlock stared at her, unhearing.
“Right,” she says, some sort of realization finally landing. What that realization is, Sherlock thinks, is the most interesting part of this rotten day. “Right, of course. Thank you,” she rallies, turning to Mrs. Hudson, then to Sherlock. “Thank you for seeing me. It was good to see you again, Dr. Watson.”
He tried walking among the crowds earlier, but felt overwhelmed and overstimulated by the fast moving vehicles, the language he doesn’t understand, the people pushing and shoving. His body is vibrating with the need to DO SOMETHING. The worst part in this entire “adventure” he’s on is the waiting. He’s not built for sitting around and waiting. He needs cases, problems to solve. He never bothered to prepare to actually play tourist here.
“Do you need to get that?” David asks when John looks at his mobile, seeing Mary’s name on the screen.
The sheer simplicity of the truth in that question leaves him silent for a long moment.
“How did you pay for the room?” Sherlock asks. James shakes his head. “Who suggested getting a room? Was it you or Nathan?”
John wonders.
And then everything, the whole of it, suddenly makes sense.
Mary has to fight any visible proof of the rush of adrenaline flooding her body. “Is that so?”
They let the words settle over them like a heavy blanket. They’re both silent for a long time after that.  John nearly gives up the fight to sleep again when he suddenly hears Sherlock’s soft voice.
“You think I’ve been crossing boundaries?”
“Nothing was stolen. The place is empty since they don’t seem to live there most of the year.” Lestrade says.
“Bought popcorn,” John says and Sherlock looks with a questioning look. “For the live Q&A. Been thinking about playing Sherlock bingo. ‘
John clears his throat uncomfortably sometime later when they watch David joining Alison in bed. She moves closer to David, caressing his chest, kissing and licking up his jawline. David closes his eyes, his body tense. He moves, effectively turning her away.
Sherlock falls silent at last. ‘
David looks down and away, her point taken.
“All seems well,” Dr. Levinson says, typing up his prognosis. “Medically speaking, you’re fit to work, but I would avoid excessive physical activity for the next week or so.”
“That would be one way to go, I suppose.” He clears his throat, stopping the spiral of words begging to leave his mouth, begging to be spoken.
“You’re going by Sherlock these days, I forgot.” She says with a bright smile as she catches up to them.
There’s nothing for it tonight.
“No.” Sherlock says, frustrated from being misunderstood. “I didn’t expect any of this. Having you, having Rosie… All to my… All to myself. I planned for the end of the world and then the end never came. We had an unspoken agreement, she and I. How can I ever hope to give you everything you’d lost when she died?”
He should be… surprised, maybe? Upset, surely, at another sign of their crumbling marriage? At the fact that these days, their interactions seem to add up to handing Rosie to one another?
"How was it?" Sherlock asks mockingly.
“That’s not what happened at all,” Sherlock says solemnly, chewing a gingernut while watching the doctored video on repeat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She’s offering a book deal, actually.”
John stands ramrod straight, his left hand bunching unconsciously into a fist.
Sherlock moves quickly to hide himself behind a tree, his hands in his pockets and his earpiece transmitting Elin Thøgersen’s goodbye to the Stewarts. It’s a cold night, and his breath is a white fog against the soft lights glowing from the neighbouring houses.
His breath hitches. “Who?”
turned in that safehouse?”
“Loud and clear, mate,” John says.
In the blink of an eye, John notices that Stewart has turned his back, staring over his shoulder. The soldier's glance finally draws John's attention to the target. The man is standing as far away from the many dignitaries as possible, as if he is trying very hard not to be seen. You’d have to look for him to see him, just like John just did.
“It’s a very simple sentence, can’t go wrong.”
This time it’s John who walks ahead, lost in a deluge of thoughts. Behind him, Rosie sits on Sherlock’s shoulders as they walk through the park, surveying her surroundings like a tiny Khaleesi.
Jonathan Palmer’s sister.
“Sherlock’s busy, love. Let’s go wait for him.”
Sherlock swallows. “Did you?”
Despite his pitiful condition, they’re familiar with John through his association with Sherlock. With a courteous yet snobbish infliction, he’s directed towards a suite of rooms that contain Sherlock Holmes.
“I noticed the times in your notes,” John explains. “Muslims pray five times a day. The hours make sense. Could be Jewish prayers too, but they pray three times a day, so Muslim prayers make more sense.”
A short-sleeved, grey hoodie and a black pair of denims. His hair is ginger and short—the curls almost gone, his eyebrows match the colour of his hair.
“Sherlock?” He tries again.
“Isn’t this what you do for a living?” David asks. “You leave, save a life, come back?”
David turns to Sherlock. “Why would you say you started feeling distressed around that time, and not immediately after you came back?”
Do not accept abuse, ever. Moftiss fantasy-land aside, please don't learn from them. It should not be forgiven or forgotten. If you are being abused you should focus on getting all the help you can.
In the past six weeks, John Watson had been suffering from a significant increase in his nightmares. The severity of the nightmares had also increased. They'd been living together long enough for Sherlock to have data for comparison.
he thinks, signalling Anthea into his study as he does.
“He is, it’s infuriating.” The answer does nothing to prevent his brother from raising an eyebrow. “It’s research,” Sherlock lies, throwing them both into a pregnant impasse. The silence drags on long enough for Sherlock to break first, squirming in his chair.
David nods and they talk some more. John is quite honest about how miserable he’s been the past few weeks.
"Like what?" John asks.
John nods again.
“When will Mycroft be here?”
He shouldn't be surprised; nobody ever stayed. It was better this way.
“Oh, of course. You have a copy of it,” she says, stealing an uncomfortable glance at Sherlock.
“I—” John's forehead wrinkles. “The teacher?”
“Who are you?” John barks back.
“You heard Lestrade, John.” Sherlock asks coldly. “Something about the timing of your dinner is suspicious. Can’t you see that?”
“What the hell,” he shrugs and goes searching for his keys. “Worth a try.”
Frustrated tears clouding his eyes, John slams the door in Sherlock’s face.
“Oh,” he stops for a split second before actually moving. “And you should probably go back to live at home with Alison, just in case.”
“Was it…” John sniffs nervously, thinking back to the scars he’d found on the man’s back that day at the hospital. “Are you OK?”
“What about tracking software on his other phone? The burner?” Sherlock stands and moves to grab his coat, grumbling unintelligibly. “And a surveillance camera in the attic?”
“You promised,” John says quietly. “Sherlock, you...”
“A press conference? Mycroft—”
PS - Did you know I have another WIP being posted these days called
“Suppose you’ll dye it when you come back,” John babbles, nervous. “You shouldn’t. It’s lovely.”
Sherlock isn’t sure why, but the first thing he does when he hears John slamming the door behind him is to sneak up to John’s room and open the door. He finds two duffle bags; the two bags Mycroft arranged to be transported from John and Mary’s flat while Sherlock was being released from the hospital.
“Stewart’s still in shock,” Mycroft explains. “He had some acclimation sessions when he returned but those are generally less than helpful, as I’m sure you know from personal experience.”
“I’m sorry, I’m just…” David says, taking a big breath. “I have a lot on my mind.”
John makes a mental note to brace himself to dive headlong into difficult discussions at David’s. The man doesn’t beat around the bush.
“It’ll be very short and simple, David, just a service and some words in his memory. No press, I promise. And afterwards you lot can go to a local and get pissed and catch up.” She pleads with him. “You were the last person who saw him, and… and… You were there for him, with him. Please, David.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry.“ Mrs. Warthington says when Sherlock breaks the news. “He was a dear. This one’s on me.” She says and points at the tree.
.” A slurred man’s voice overrides the others’, coming from the pub’s entrance.
“He got lost?” John asked.
“Mr. William Holmes?” John inquires politely, nodding to a nurse.
“Oh.” John closes his eyes in relief and lets a big breath out. “What does that have to do with—”
“Once... or twice,” David says, and Sherlock knows well enough to be sure that they were only
He never imagined John would take the news of his plan well. No, of course not. He imagined a heated argument during which Sherlock was supposed to cooly and calmly list his detailed, rational explanations. John would be upset but dazzled, as always, and they would end up agreeing that they’re both in this together, to the very end.
Sherlock stares at the ceiling when he speaks next.
A horrified look dawns on his face.
“Because, it’s not my place to say.” Sherlock says and his answer is sobering. Of course he would think that. “It’s Mary’s flat. That’s why you’re there. You want Rosie to grow up in the house she shared with her mother.”
“Don’t worry,” she says. “I won’t tell a soul, I promise.”
“Did you stick to your script?”
If you're depressed but no one in your circles of family or friends understands you, you can speak to a GP, a social worker, helplines and therapists; they're all there to help you! They were not only trained to support someone in your situation, they actually CHOSE to do that for a living. Isn't that amazing? Give them a chance (and know that it takes time to find something/someone that works, and it takes time to see results, so don't give up! It's a lifelong process.)
“I hoped it would.”
“Will you come?” She turns to look at him, noticing his frozen form as she extends the invite. “He talked about you. A lot,” she says. “I know you were… important to him—”
He walks away, turning his back to the window as the car leaves the kerb.
“Good night, then,” he says, seeing that he’s not invited to join him. No further deliberation, then.
“Yes?”
“You bastard,” John snorts, the lines evident around his eyes. A smile creeps onto Sherlock’s face. “That’s not funny.”
Sherlock never imagined that conversation would come on the heels of a kiss. Why would he? Things were comfortable between them during his months of recovery, but it never came close to the comfortable intimacy they shared in the days before his fall.
“No.” Sherlock shakes his head. “I’m saving that little piece of information as a doomsday weapon. Mostly because it’s someone he still works with today. I see him at the Diogenes every once in a while.”
“I’m Corporal Stewart’s publicist,” Elin says, stepping inside with a few short, confident strides. Wearing high heels and a perfectly pressed suit, she sends a tight smile across the room, and the gesture sends everyone back to their tasks. They’re already running late setting up the photoshoot, so nobody pays her anything more than a courteous nod.
"Stop reading my emails," John obliges Sherlock with thoroughly rehearsed banter.
“They used that against me,” David says and stares at the table. “They said… they said my country had given up on me. That I was left behind and… and no one remembered I was out there. It was...”
“Ah, so he really
Wait for what? He still isn’t sure. He hasn’t heard from Sherlock since. Not a phone call, not a text, no sign of life. He could be out of the country by now, again, for all John knows.
**“It was simple stuff at first. Things they told us to expect in training. They had me sitting on a stool twenty-four hours, for ten days straight. If I dared move a muscle they’d come at me with fists and the barrels of their guns. I don’t think I slept the entire time. That didn’t work, though. I never broke. I didn’t tell them anything besides a fake name and address. So they chained me to the ceiling, had me hanging from my wrists. Called me ‘pig Jesus’. I can’t tell you how many times they had to relocate my shoulders. They’d place this device between my legs,” he continues, “a few of them would hold my shoulders, then that device gave me electric shocks. After that, my feet stopped working for a while.””**
“Oh my—” Mary starts, choking on her words. She looks up at the other woman with a start. “That’s—”
“And that’s all?” Sherlock says. “She agreed?”
John wonders. Did he just create some sort of motherly diplomatic incident?
right now. Sherlock's eyes grow wide and angry for a split second, but John recognizes the moment Sherlock makes the same decision -
David’s self-assured composure crumples right in front of his eyes.
“Yeah.” He sniffs. “Sounds nice.”
He fell asleep on the sofa again. It’s the third night in a row this week.
. He thinks.
“Easy for you to say, English Lit. Maybe I should just tell Rachel I can’t do it. I think it’s… I think it’s too soon.”
“Yeah, OK.” John sighs in acceptance. They took the case, they might as well finish it. “But promise me you’ll make arrangements for leaving for the hospital from there.”
“Sherlock?” John asks, confused.
“Shit! No!” John calls and tries to break away again but Lestrade won’t let him go.
John can’t help a crooked smile at that. He straightens where he stands, eyes the man standing in front him from head to toe. Sherlock looks back, challenging, measuring.
Sherlock swallows and nods.
Sherlock offers nothing more than a shrug in response, unable and unwilling to reveal more. He really should stir the conversation back to David, to his plans of starting over, maybe find a way to bring up Aldridge—
(See the end of the chapter for
David laughs bitterly. “I hate politicians. I hate politics. I’m not sure he’d like to hear what I have to say about his precious government.”
“Looks nice,” John blurts, unable to stop the words from leaving his mouth. Sherlock turns to look at him, confused.
“Welcome back, Mr. Knight, come in,” the young intelligence officer says as she opens the door to the Command and Operations bunker.
“Mr. Knight.” A female officer with a German accent knocks softly as she opens the door. “Do you need an—”
"I said I'll be back tomorrow." John clarifies, turning to grab his coat.
“Didn’t know you hike.”
He smiles at Rosie, her eyes dark blue, and sighs as he tightly bundles her and rushes to the nursery to prepare her for bed. He tries to allow his brain to relax and focus on this task at hand, one he’s done religiously every day since she was born; drying her off properly, cooing and smiling; spreading diaper ointment as he tells her a story about a tall detective; snuggling her warmly after he fastens the babygro.
“John?” Sherlock asks. “Are you alright?”
“I’m afraid it is.”
“John?”
“Don’t be, you couldn’t know.” John frowns. “I assumed there were... You know. It’s not your fault.”
John’s ears finally perk with interest when Mrs. Holmes mentions a nearby light trail.
John had no idea.
“I can see the marks of the tip of his umbrella on the floor.”
John feels more than hears Sherlock’s chuckle near his ear. Mycroft crosses his legs to the other side, exasperated by the entire ordeal.
Sherlock hums. The sitting room is silent while John braces for his next question.
“Right,” John says. “David.”
“Do I get to ask a question?” Sherlock asks.
John is the only thing that matters.
“What really happened on the night you and Jonathan Palmer were captured?” Sherlock asks.
So yes, today’s kiss was a complete and utter surprise.
“What is it?”
“I don’t know, I’ll think of something.” David says, raising an eyebrow. “You comin’?”
“What’s going on?” John asks.
“I work,” Sherlock says. “I think.”
“Hanwell?” he asks and she nods. “Head nurse?”
“You’re inebriated.”
John’s words are met with a sudden wall of silence. Aldridge’s eyes become dangerously narrowed again, and he takes three confident steps towards John, who straightens in defence as a result.
“It’s a case, John,” Sherlock says, “I’ve solved hundreds of cases and I’ll solve this one too, I just need to do it differently this time.”
There was a stilted conversation about David’s upcoming speech for the new recruits—the same one David had confessed to John he’s not very keen on. Elin insisted it would be ‘
“It’s just a dress, David. I’d rather save up for the important things,” she says, giving his shoulder a gentle squeeze. “Like therapy, or finding you a proper gym.”
“Yes, sir.”
“What did you think he’d say?”
Sherlock, asking Mycroft to be sent away. Avoiding John for weeks once he came back, insisting that he shouldn’t join him on the case.
“Don’t know. They haven’t left the house long enough for Mycroft’s people to install eyes there,” Sherlock exhales. “Only does it when his wife is out of the house or asleep.”
He thinks.
“When did you take your ring off, John?” David asks.
“Er, no,” John huffs at the mere idea. “The other Harry, from the surgery. Said you’d know what it's about.”
“Uh.” Sherlock gasps, surprised by the sensation. “More.” His fingers tighten around John’s waist as John rubs his thigh back and forth, gently.  “More…” Sherlock’s head falls backward, dizzy with sensation.
Sherlock’s eyes search the floor for something invisible.
“You can still give her that,” John says. “You only just came back.”
John shakes his head. “That’s not true, Sherlock, and you know it. I just feel… I think there’s a better way of doing whatever it is that we’re doing now.”
“Yes.” John agrees.
“Oh,” John looks to Mycroft, who smirks winningly.
“So…” He tries again. “Every time you demanded you’re not gay it was only somewhat true. Or do you still think of it as… stress relief? A solution for difficult times?”
“Oh good, you’re here,” John says rushing into the bolthole, breathless from exertion.
“It’s… it’s generally preferred that they don’t,” David says.
“Sir, I often wondered that myself.” David shakes his head in disbelief. “No, what’s more—I prayed for that. They’d tortured me for years on end. There were weeks I couldn’t remember my own name. Death would have been a kindness. But they weren’t kind people.”
“The missus bought him an iPhone. A brand-new one. That’s everything you’ve missed out on.”
John never mentioned his plans for the days after Sherlock’s recovery, but he assumed that was only because John felt it was none of Sherlock’s business. If anything, he assumed John and Mary would reunite and announce it to Sherlock after the fact.
“Come on, come one, come on,” he mumbles impatiently as the video rewinds, his heart nearly bursting with surprise when David’s figure suddenly appears next to Alison, moving in reverse throughout the house.
“He was doing well for a long time. We were so happy when we got married, it was everything I ever wanted. But then... It just became... Worse. Something happened, I still don’t know what. It was gradual, too. I didn't just happen one day. I thought that maybe he regretted the marriage. Maybe he resented me for something. Then one day I found him in the sitting room, arguing with his own reflection in the mirror. For a long time, too. He was immersed in it. He threatened me not to get close to him when I tried to help.”
John’s eyes narrow and his lips tighten, a signal that he doesn’t find the answer satisfying. Sherlock knows that look far too well.
“Yeah?”
“It’s good to see you too, mate.” Lestrade says, waving a dossier in front of Sherlock’s face.
He wasn't.
, Sherlock realizes. Billy must have looked like he was loitering.
“Can I help with anything?” John asks in return and she nods appreciatively. He’s given a few tasks he fulfils gladly, happy for the chance to get lost in some mundane tasks.The backdoor to the house opens and brings the winter with it. It also brings Rosie’s voice, her laughter filling the room.
“There were two of them originally. One of them disappeared, presumably killed, somewhere along the way. It’s still early days to tell for sure. We haven’t been able to get much out of Corporal Stewart yet, although he did confirm the other soldier’s death.”
By the time the two doctors are done Sherlock is settled in his chair, staring at the floor to his side.
With John Watson, he'd got that feeling early on.
“In many ways, yes.”
“See, we never said anything but… shortly after we got married I discovered that… there are some things in her past she never told me before.” John says quietly. “She told me about some of them, but I don’t know how much of it was true.”
“Well, I certainly didn’t imagine-”
David looks up at Elin hesitantly; the cool steel in her eyes, most likely a professional quality that has nothing to do with him, sends his heart into a set of nervous skips. She eyes him through the mirror and thanks the makeup girl, who gives him one final satisfied look.
“I’ve plenty of other reasons to resent her. She has more than enough secrets, still.” Sherlock doesn’t interrupt. John rarely speaks so openly and frankly. “We... I.. I was still working on forgiving her.”
“Aldridge was a piece of work, alright,” John says. “Nothing beats a drunk homophobe.”
Getting up, he checks on Rosie. She’s minutes away from her usual wake-up time, and she looks incredibly peaceful in sleep. He stands by the window of the nursery, half expecting to see the man staring back at him from the street.
What’s there to say, anyway?
“Look here, Rosie,” he whispers.
“Excuse me.” Sherlock says, reading the contents of the text, turning to leave John behind.
John looks away, lost for words.
“Will you do it?” Mycroft asks.
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. “No, he must have heard through the grapevine we’re still looking into Abu Nazir’s whereabouts—”
“Thank you.” John smiles.
“What about her?”
“John, this woman may hold a piece of valuable information—”
“No, of course not.” David says and squirms in his chair when the operator eyes him again, over the answer. “No. No, I didn’t.”
Putting John first, as always. John saw Sherlock’s silence, his intensity since this case started, and read it as jealousy. But it was fear, it was protectiveness. Wasn’t it?
That’s about as roundabout one can go to avoid saying ‘I owe the Holmes brothers far too many favours to have refused’. John doesn’t say that, though. Instead he frowns and stares at his chips. “Didn’t get any, myself.”
John's heart squeezes.
he thinks. It reminds John of simpler times; back in the days of barracks and tents when Bill Murray and John's life mission was to put a smile on James Sholto’s face.
“Even the stuff no one’s supposed to see,” Sherlock clarifies, determined.
“Sorry?”
Yes, in my headcanon Brave John Watson tried his luck with Sherlock again. Unfortunately, Sherlock wasn't ready yet again.
And if she was hoping to get a response out of Sherlock, it finally works. His body tenses and the smile he’s had on while holding Rosie is wiped from his face. John lowers his face to the table, feeling the same hurt he felt when Sherlock was blamed for his father’s condition at the hospital.
“Do you remember anything at all being out of place that day?” Jenkins asks. “Anything at the compound that seemed out of the ordinary?”
