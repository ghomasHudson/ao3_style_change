He stared out onto the moonlit night sky and got lost in the movement below. At least, that’s why he told himself he didn’t hear Happy approach. The steps on the ground were loud, but he was dazed, lost in his thoughts, and he didn’t hear him.
Steve was a nice guy, Tony could admit as much. Somehow less and simultaneously so much more than his father had made him out to be. He was a stubborn prick for sure, but there was so much good, too, and a mixture of bashfulness and a dry sort of humor that often had Tony laugh against his will.
Tony glanced into the air briefly. There was a flickering in the sky, an almost invisible outline of a plane.
Tony braced himself with one hand against the headboard and pushed back to meet Steve’s thrusts. Biting his lower lip, Tony glanced towards the cradle standing in front of the bookshelves. His expression was visibly strained, and he leaned forward to press his face into the next pillow, effectively muffling all sounds.
No, Steve thought, he definitely still hadn’t gotten used to this. And yet… he had to admit, he sort of liked the sound of it. To be anyone’s ‘my’.
Just as he’d hoped, any thought of resistance seemed to promptly melt away. A hard gasp clawed through Tony’s throat, his back bowing. After that, every swipe of Steve’s tongue seemed to have him near jolting off the bed—which was exactly what Steve had wanted to achieve. For Tony to finally let go for once, let go of his million worries and regrets and fears, and just be with him—here, right in this moment.
“Of course you love her,” Steve insisted. “And I made my peace with that. That you’d never love me in the way you loved her. It doesn’t
“No you don’t,” Tony sing-songed, and Bucky had the feeling that he would have to fight the urge to strangle Tony for a whole long while in the nearer future.
—well, he wasn’t making it any easier. For the last couple of weeks, he had always been so close to Tony and it was really setting him off his game.
“My name is Steve,” Steve told Barnes, patting his own chest to establish familiarity with the name. “Steve Rogers. I’m your best friend and I’ve come to take you
As far as Steve knew, the two had never actually talked about it, and instead had mutually agreed to simply try and move on. And Steve had never intervened, too much depending on his husband and his best friend getting along, though he had known it wasn’t a healthy way to deal with it.
Taking a deep breath, Tony decided to just jump right into the middle. “There’s… something that’s called Infinity Stones. Cosmic… entities, if you will. Very powerful. There’s six of them. Space, Mind, Reality, Power, Soul, and Time. In… in about two years, we’re gonna be fighting a power-hungry warlord from outer space—Good friend of Loki, by the way—, and you can probably guess what he’s after.”
“And when did the person live?” she asked him when they walked back to the living quarters. “You said they were from a different timeline?”
There was a considerate pause and visible surprise on Steve’s face. Bucky sat back down next to him and… this felt strangely formal—two people walking on eggshells although they’d shared so much with each other. He was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to hug Steve, or at least shake his hand or something, but he didn’t really know how to proceed with that.
“Means we’ll take a few turns, be less noticeable,” Steve supplied and sighed as he looked back on the parking lot where Fury was now being wheeled into an ambulance. He’d taken a bullet, too, but the shot had gone straight through him. It wasn’t anything fatal, and still… Fury would be taken to the hospital, and then he would die. Or at least, pretend to do so. “I’m not sure I like this plan,” he said. “If Camp Lehigh is SHIELD property, we could need him there.”
He spared the rest of his team a grateful glance as well, then walked out of the room. Outside, a huge stairway led to a second floor. There was a giant chandelier hanging at the ceiling, and lots of famous paintings decorating the wall.
Steve cleared his throat, putting a hand on his earpiece to show he was talking on the com line. Better choose his words wisely.
Slurring a “no” at her, Tony tried to sit up. God, he was stoned out of his mind. And the morphine they’d put into his bloodstream was definitely the good stuff.
“Go over there,” Tony ordered Steve, and pointed to the ground in front of the stove, a few meters away. He kept one hand securely linked with Ian’s, but otherwise, Ian was standing on his own two feet.
Steve was crying against his lips, but he was also kissing back. Tony’s eyes blinked with his own tears. And in that moment, for the first time in their long and rocky relationship, it seemed they truly understood each other.
Tony forced his feet to the door and carried himself across the threshold. He hadn’t bothered to change clothes before coming here, too busy freaking out about what he might find. And though it sort of surprised him that he was able to care at all about his appearance right now, the part of him concerned with Steve dumping him in about five minutes burned with the need to at least look the part while he did so.
Ian was all but hanging in Steve’s arms, his arms flailing wildly as he giggled with every step Steve took. His teething pains seemed forgotten momentarily, pure unadulterated joy buzzing through his tiny limbs.
“We can help you, Wanda,” Tony gritted out. “I know you hate me for what happened to your parents. I know you had to watch them die, and trust me, if I could go back in time and can SI’s weapon’s production long before you were even born, I would. In a heartbeat.”
Bucky sighed once more as he glanced at her. He knew that was true, but it wouldn’t make the fallout any less true.
Almost expecting Tony to breach him like this, Steve braced himself for the pain—but it never came. Instead, Tony leaned up to kiss him hungrily, sucking and nipping at his panting mouth.
Steve’s eyes widened at the crude words, his whole body stiffening. It was one thing that Stane insulted him right to his face, but why would he talk about him to one of Tony’s business affiliates?
He wanted to greet the man next to her but instead found himself drawn into a big hug. Pepper chuckled and said. “Steve, this is Harold, my husband.”
It was a cruel world that awaited him beyond the dream—Steve shivered hard and begged for some strength.
And that was the last thing he said, before—out of the blue—zombies and ghosts and horror brides and every goddamn monster out of a horror flick suddenly walked through the hallway.
, that wasn’t the case at all. “You looked about ready to bolt when you noticed me lying next to you. And I… understand your concern, I do. But Steve… if you have to fight some inner war with yourself every time you touch me, that’s… not all that flattering, really. I’m seventeen, sure, but I’m also
Vision shrugged, the movement looking strangely out of place. He pulled back, and really looked like he wanted to scratch his head but didn’t know if that sort of signal was okay to give.
“Well. I got no company to manage,” Tony mused. “Nat and Rhodey are more than willing to put the newbies through the wringer.” He shrugged slightly. “I’ve got nowhere to be.”
Steve huffed, staring at the ceiling for a moment, before looking back at Bucky. “No. We’re … married.”
Inhaling slowly, Steve’s eyes drifted to the landscape passing by and he allowed himself to rest against Tony’s shoulder. Inevitably, his thoughts returned to the shooter. He hadn’t known what to call it thenת though he knew there had been something more to it than was visible on the surface. Those eyes had seemed so far away. A dead look that somehow made Steve feel like he was scratching an over-rubbed scar.
“Right,” Tony agreed, his expression unreadable. “We’ll only get a feeling of what we want, no pressure, no obligations.”
Tony blinked as he realized that yes, he had read this in Steve’s file at one point, but he had tried to only skim through it, at that time, determined to get Steve out of his head and not lose himself in him even further.
“Sorry,” he told his team as he jogged up the rear hatch. “I hope you haven’t been waiting too long. I got held up.”
Now though, he mostly looked very unsure about the whole situation, so Steve was very cautious when he reached for one of his legs, drawing it up just a little.
“As I said, there’s a lot of people dying to get their hands on you. And this—” He pointed to the stack of papers. “—will tell them that you’re our problem to deal with. It will keep a bazillion federal institutions off our backs. The Avengers don’t have a white card for everything, but we have certain perks when it comes to explaining ourselves and our actions. And trust me when I tell you… you need those perks.
. Because I needed you through all of the mess that was the war. You were the only thing that kept me sane. I think I dreamt of you because I needed you to survive all of that.”
Tony pinched his nose, realizing immediately where all of this was going. “So we have to link all three carriers for this to work. Three carriers, three people to replace the blades.”
Obi had all but laughed in Tony’s face at the mere mention of an A.I., and sure, DUM-E’s programming was very basic at heart, but he
The next thing he knew, his hands had already grabbed Steve’s shoulders and he pressed him against the nearest wall. His lips were mauling Steve’s in hot, hungry kisses.
“You know, I’m getting really tired of hearing that,” Steve replied, taking a step forward with his shield raised, and he stared Tony straight in the eyes. “What if we don’t let you do that?”
When Steve eventually got his bearings, and went inside, the look Tony gave him all but froze his insides. A look, and nothing more. He sat on the sofas, his tablet dangling on his knees. He looked like shit, to be honest—still attractive, but obviously hung-over. He also looked ready to say something but evidently decided against it, standing up instead to walk intently to the back room and locking himself away.
In the span of twenty-four hours, Tony had given one interview after another, and declined about three dozen buying offers for the programming code alone. Obi had been back in the lab about an hour later, declaring loudly and enthusiastically that he had supported Tony every step of the way and that Stark Industries couldn’t be more proud of their future CEO.
When they left the mansion, it was already well into the night, and everyone was tired. Tony, on the other hand, was completely wired and Steve had to admit, it was sort of adorable. The ghost show had been pretty cool, all in all. The costumes were well-made and the make-up shockingly realistic.
"That's the spirit," Tony said, stepping closer and helping Steve get rid of the sturdier parts of his uniform. The radiant light of the small device was casting an eerie glow on Steve's skin and Tony made it a point to press a kiss on every new inch that got revealed. There were a few scratches and bruises from the battle, but they were already fading. "So... you always putting out on first dates?" he asked at some point, grinning widely at the unimpressed expression that made itself home on Steve's face almost instantly.
“These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles in minute. The satellites can read a terrorist’s DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.”
Tony nodded with a tight smile, knowing that it really was this easy for Steve. They’d won the fight, and that was that—for now. “Yes, again,” he agreed. “Think we’ll ever have to not do that?”
Steve swallowed hard at that almost-confession, leaning in, probably so he wouldn’t have to look Tony in the eye while he opened the fly of his pants, tugging him free. Shifting stance so they’d be on the same height, he made quick work of his own jeans, aligning the both of them at last.
If tension could kill a man, Steve was sure he'd be dead. His entire body seized up at the sudden touch, so new and foreign it was electrifying. No one had ever touched him like this, but it was the casual air with which Tony did it that caught him completely off guard. He took a deep breath and relaxed, but by then the damage had been done. Tony knew at least to some degree where they stood.
“No, it wasn’t,” Natasha agreed. “But I know he understands why you did it. He won’t hold it against you.”
“Hey,” Steve called, but there was no heat behind it. He was just glad Tony finally had this off his chest.
“The Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list,” Tony explained patiently. “A few millions at a time. Zola’s algorithm locates every person or institution that poses a threat to HYDRA. I already sent encrypted evacuation notices to the locations on the list, but… we won’t be able to save all of them… not sure we’d be able to save half, to be honest.”
Steve nodded his head, his chest crushed with the weight of his gasps. “Yeah.” He bit his lower lip hard and wiggled his hips, determined to create friction, needing to feel all of Tony around him. “You feel amazing. I never thought it’d be like this.”
Tony urgently held out a hand to him, the same way that the man in the portal was holding out a hand to Tony. It was Strange, Steve realized, and Tony was waiting until he caught Steve’s hand and only then whirled and reached for Strange’s.
He just didn’t know how, not with Lagos still weighing heavily on everyone. And not when he knew in his heart that Steve would never agree to this. Their past conversations had made that very clear.
On a long sigh, Steve rose to his feet, leaning his shield against one of the couches. Only now that his surrounding was perfectly clean, he realized how dirty he truly was. His uniform was torn in a lot of places and his skin was stained with ash and grime.
“You know... I came to appreciate how good my name looks on you, Picasso,” Tony decided and sat down on the mattress with an amused grin.
“Yeah,” Steve answered, doing that thing again—smiling at Tony like he was genuinely glad to see him.
Steve nodded harshly, his racing mind determined to keep up with every sensation. Faster was good. Faster was infinitely good. He focused on the wet slide of their erections and, at the same time, the look on Tony’s face. The way he moaned and melted into him—the way his tongue danced with Steve’s as their lips moved together. Tony always kissed Steve like he was starved, and Steve was the only one who could quench his thirst.
Sleep hadn’t cleared Tony’s muddled thoughts. Wrapping his mind around Steve and this goddamn kiss seemed impossible. Seemed something more like a distant, bizarre dream than anything that could have truly transpired. How it was that Tony found himself here in this situation … and yet, it had happened.
“There’s every chance we’re not going to beat him,” Tony said without looking up. “If Ultron is really building a body… He’ll be more powerful than any of us.”
“I’m just… happy,” he said instead, and that, at least, was the truth. “I haven’t been in a while and I… Sometimes, I wish there could be an invention that bottled up a memory, like scent. And it’d never fade, and it’d never get stale. And then, when one wanted it, the bottle could be uncorked, and it would be like living the moment all over again.”
He didn’t know if he could deal with Tony’s rejection, though he knew in his heart that it awaited him on the other side of the ‘corridor’, as Tony had put it.
The elevator’s door in the hallway opened just seconds after FRIDAY had alerted them to Ross’ arrival. Tony briefly glanced over to Steve, who already sat at the conference table, before he flipped open his cell phone.
Tony heard water running. FRIDAY must’ve turned on the coffee machine. He considered opening his eyes to see what time it was, but the room was still dark and his pillow was so soft that he decided to roll over and burrow under the covers instead. When he tried to move, however, his gut caught on fire and pain exploded through him, making him groan.
"So what did I miss?" Steve asked Sam at some point as they were ascending the stairs. He wasn't even sure how long he'd been gone, and now he was feeling a little self conscious about it. Did Nat tell everyone already? Couldn't have, Sam obviously hadn’t known when he came down here, and he wouldn't have bothered to keep it a secret.
Eventually, Steve looked down at the tasteful plaque embedded inside the gravestone. It read simply,
“And that matters to you!” Tony spat, throwing the empty glass at the floor, hearing it shatter. And good God, there were tears in his eyes now and he couldn’t keep his voice steady anymore. This was a train-wreck waiting to happen, and yet, he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. “
Tony shrugged. “It’s alright. I’m sure you had to deal with your own demons after the Sokovia Accords.” He glanced at Steve, smiling a little. “I keep forgetting what it was like in 2018, but… you and your Tony… you haven’t seen each other in a long while, hm?”
“It’s gone, I know,” Tony offered, shrugging when Steve looked at him askance. “What? You expected me
Today belonged to him and his grief. And he would spend the time he had to remember the man he’d loved and lost too soon.
After he’d handed Ian over to Veronica, Tony went to the bathrooms, freshening up a bit. He changed his tie since Ian had effectively crumbled the last to a point of no return, and washed his face with the tap water. Then, he headed on to boardroom three.
Steve’s hands began to wander, slowly, acquainting themselves with Tony’s face and stroking his thumbs along his cheekbones. Tony made a satisfied noise in the back of his throat that complemented the soft sighs coming out of Steve’s mouth.
A full minute passed as the group watched the door after Obi had left. That had been an impressive speech, and Steve glanced at Tony at last. "That went… better than I thought it would."
Once he’d gathered every single one of the stones, once he’d reached his goal, he’d become so powerful that he’d simply left his body behind, becoming something… else.
It wasn’t hard to see how much he must’ve loved his wife. The grief was written all across his features whenever someone would say her name or even hint at her death.
It was so strange—this was still the same man he’d kissed only minutes ago. The same man who’d so easily declared his love for Steve. And yet… this was a version of Tony who, as far as Steve knew, still couldn’t stand to be around him for longer than was absolutely necessary.
After closing his eyes briefly, Tony looked at Steve again. And it was startling to realize that not being able to mend things with Steve would probably be his deepest regret.
There was a wonderful tightening, and a quick pulsation all around him that drove him on as he let out a single loud groan and came, shoving harder with his orgasm a few more times. His entire body felt overheated, and he wanted to slip out of his uniform so he could feel Tony's skin against his own, but that was not to be. He slumped over Tony, one hand holding his weight against the bench. "Oh my God," he breathed out, panting.
Tony’s legs encircled Steve’s hips, not surpassing the opportunity to tease his clothed backside with his free hand. Steve chuckled into his skin and squeezed his ass in retaliation, inspiring a careless smirk on Tony’s lips as his touch moved to the persistent hardness that remained frantically in need for attention. At Steve’s answering grip, Tony released a long moan and thrust eagerly into his touch, murmuring his name as though he was a god misplaced among the heavens.
Tony could pinpoint the exact second when the guilt took hold of Steve’s heart, his mind racing with thoughts of what he’d done for Barnes to look like that—which wounds had been his own fault.
Time had gone by so fast, and his last day in the army already dated back three years. As he'd told Bucky in that ditch, he went ahead and became a teacher, still working on his doctorate. Curator was clearly a position beyond his reach, but he didn't mind teaching, not at all.
“I don’t know yet. We gotta find this guy and stop him from wreaking any more havoc. We’ll have to come up with a plan,” he said glibly.
“He… he hasn’t forgiven me,” he said. “About lying to him. About leaving him. I’m not sure he ever will.”
Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder blade, feeling the echoes of his strong heartbeat where their joined hands were now nestled against Steve’s chest.
“It’s—” He almost choked on the word. “—understandable that something like this would happen when you’re… close to someone all the time. Bucky’s a good-looking fella, I mean… uh… from an objective point of view. I never…” He heaved a breath and pondered scouring the room for a hole to crawl into. In Tony’s tower, such a thing might be easy to find. “Probably lots of dames would’ve—I mean, if they were in your shoes—”
“You alright?” Steve asked, his voice low, though of course he knew the others could still hear them.
“You’re left subject to investigation,” Tony offered, shrugging at Steve’s confused stare. “What?” he asked. “He wouldn’t be admitting as much if he’d not already been put on SHIELD’s most wanted list.”
was the heir. And it might take a while, but he had Bruce, and a few other MIT alumnis that might be interested in working for the company.
Ian didn’t want a bottle, and when Tony popped the pacifier in his mouth, he spat it back out again. Humming didn’t work. Walking didn’t work. Bouncing didn’t work. He tried rocking, and Ian still wouldn’t stop crying.
“Oh, I’m sure you didn’t,” Stane replied, his voice pointedly light, but it still had Steve shudder. And for the first time, the reality of his situation sank in: From now on, he would be living in someone else’s house, sleeping in someone else’s bed with someone else’s husband, and he was surrounded by strangers.
He knew Steve was holding back how little he thought of Obi, but whatever he’d heard him saying to Tony on that day in Bruce’s MIT lab, it hadn’t exactly left a positive impression.
They’d started the day late, staying in bed and watching all those stupid cartoons on tv while having breakfast. After lunch, which Steve had been adamant to cook himself, they’d driven around the city, visiting all kinds of New Yorker tourist venues like Coney Island or Empire State. After returning home, and having a very athletic round of afternoon-sex, they got ready for the big party, which was—despite all of Tony’s fears—a pretty amazing experience in itself.
Tony settled his forehead on Steve’s shoulder and kissed the skin there. “You’re gonna be a great father, you know? Everyone’s nervous at first. I’m freaking out, too, but we can only get better.”
“I thought I could at least say goodbye to Rhodes,” Tony said, unable to contain his annoyance. He’d known Obi would be like this as soon as Tony got his papers and he could finally dig his claws into him but still… He surely could at least wrap things up here on his own time, right?
Tony sighed, brushing hair out of Steve’s face with his free hand, his lips unable to keep from stealing a kiss off his brow. He loved Steve like this. He loved him always, of course, but he especially loved him like this. Cuddled against him, peaceful, at rest, and so trusting of him. So incredibly trusting. Just allowing Tony to hold him like this placed more trust in his arms than anything he could have imagined.
Sure enough, Steve nodded, the motion tense, and Tony heaved a breath before answering. “No, we didn’t,” he said. “You were drunk, I’m not an asshole…”
Tony's hair was soft against his fingers, and he moved in earnest, quick pumping motions that left Steve breathless. "Your tongue…"
He hadn’t told Steve outright. Between him, Bruce and Helen, they had taken their time to really ensure the process was going to be as close to a natural pregnancy as possible. They’d worked, and worked some more, until all risks were down to a straight zero.
Steve snorted as though he couldn’t help himself. “Only you would put a sex joke into a code that will permanently change your life. You’re insufferable.”
“Sure it is,” Tony replied and shot a repulsor as a distraction, followed by a small-caliber rocket. “It’s a game. And we’re all losing.”
Steve looked back to Tony, then turned around. “I’ll do it,” he said shortly, and left the room with quick, angry strides.
"So," he said, looking to the woman before setting his eyes back on Tony. "You bounce back pretty easy. Good to know." He had his arms crossed in what he knew must be a pretty intimidating stance. He didn't care. The room was slowly getting fuzzy around the edges, but not so much as to really get in the way.
,” he groaned when he felt Tony tighten around him even further. Soon enough, they were straining against each other, mouths open and panting desperately for breath, driving each other relentlessly higher and higher. It went on and on and on until Steve thought he might die.
Oh fuck, that was better. That was infinitely better. Tony’s graceful fingers were gliding up and down, shifting ever so often to squeeze his sac. Up and down, again and again. His thumb becoming more boisterous—pressing into his head, earning jerks and moans and whimpers and long mewls of Tony’s name with no relent.
. “Not everyone can be saved. We need to live with that, otherwise, one day, maybe nobody can be saved.” He looked down at his feet. “I don’t think Wanda was ready for this. I thought she was, but… can’t imagine what’s going through her head. She just wanted to help and then—”
“Maybe not,” Steve said. “How about yourself, then? Because, knowing that I inspire self-loathing is such a turn-on.”
Tony had no idea when exactly he’d lost his heart to Steve. By all means, it should be impossible that he was still able to feel for him like that, but… maybe it had always secretly belonged to him and Tony had just been too blind to see it.
“The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place,” Steve told Ross, his voice grave. “I feel we’ve done that.”
. No bulk—not like himself, just strong definition; and he moved all easy and unselfconscious, as if... as if he had been naked in front of Steve a thousand times, as well.
, he decided then and there. It would be too much… for his own heart, and sure as hell for Steve’s fragile conscience. He could take a little shock and guilt in the morning, but if Steve looked at him in horror and self-disgust, that would just be too much.
“What’s the matter with you?” Tony asked, frowning slightly. “You look kinda spooked. Is it about the slime? I told you I’m perfectly fine.”
Sometimes Steve just had to accept that the things coming out of Tony's mouth made no sense. This was one of those cases. To the best of Steve's knowledge, there was no such thing as sex-pollen, and even if there were, he could personally say that the plant they'd been fighting did not have that.
“Need I remind you again that we do not answer to you?” Ross said sternly. “And you are not the only one who cares about Rogers. He’s a national symbol. And we’ve been searching all day. Tell me, Stark, what have
aren’t. And you won’t even make it into the Quinjet if I don’t let you. This is still 2018 and your codes don’t work here. And I won’t change that.”
They certainly were past the point of foreplay. While Steve would’ve never admitted as much to Tony, he’d had thought about this about a hundred times already. How it’d be to have sex with Tony.
It was time then. He would get Steve out of there, and then they could deal with the aftermath. No matter what it took. No matter the cost.
Steve’s expression turned disbelieving at that. “Do you really think I’d want that? Tony, you gotta listen… That doctor, the psychiatrist that accompanied us to London, he's behind all of this. He isn’t who we thought he was. And there are five more Winter Soldiers he’s trying to set free. We can't let him find them.”
Together, they walked back into the bedroom, and Steve’s eyes followed Bucky’s gaze, as he inspected the space.
, Tony’s voice echoed over the comm line. And, then, over their private channel, “Steve, copy now, or I swear to God—”
“Might be worse for him,” Bruce mused, scratching his chin. “Maybe he’s seeing things from his old life.”
Tony blinked and sat up straighter. He ignored the pain that jabbed abdomen for no reason other than it was there and wanted to be remembered. Steve was staring at him with such raw intensity that he nearly forgot everything else. “I wasn’t
“I wish you could’ve said them goodbye,” Steve said. “And that Howard would’ve been a better father for you.”
Every half hour they did a light show. The actual lights were turned off and the village lights up and then they played horrible outdated “God Bless America music” through 1980’s speakers. It was hilarious.
They arrived at Nashville in the early noon, setting up everything on the campground, before walking into the city. In Nashville, they went straight to lower Broadway. There were restaurants up and down the street, bars with live music, and one record shop after another. They stopped in a few bars that didn’t have a ‘21 or over’ age restriction during the day and stayed for a few hours. They listened to the music, and eventually even decided to do some karaoke. Steve and Barnes started by singing Bob Marley’s
“If he isn’t here I wouldn’t know where to look,” he said, and let his eyes drift over the scenery. The street seemed fairly deserted, and there were several empty houses. A perfect hideout. Something he’d look for if he had to go under for a while.
After another parting kiss, he watched as Tony walked to the elevator, his steps slow but steady. When he stepped inside the booth, the doors closing slowly behind him, he didn’t turn around again.
Around them, a crowd had gathered, snapping photos of the three of them. Only now Tony realized that Fury had, at some point, brought some distance between them. Fair enough, he thought. His disguise would likely not stand a chance once a photo of him was published online.
“Whatever it is you think you have to do,” Tony told Steve’s team, “you can run it by the UN once we’re home.” It was complete bullshit, of course, but exactly what Ross would want to hear.
Steve stepped closer, pulling him even nearer. “It means I considered this before you came back, Tony. Before you changed anything. And that means I thought about you in your previous timeline as well. You think that other version of me hated you. That he willingly left you behind, that you didn’t matter to him. But I know--Tony I
Ross smiled. “I wanted to talk to you about this in person. I’m reaching out to you.” He glanced sideways, and raised a brow. “But I’m not sure it’s appropriate for him to join us.” Though he tried for casual, his feelings for Bucky were clearly heard.
Steve winced, but didn’t say anything about it. For a few minutes, he didn’t say anything at all, and neither did Bucky, though Steve was sure he knew he was there. Steve walked in and simply sat down onto some battered sofa someone must have salvaged from the dump, and watched him out of the corner of his eye.
However, the jab about parental control was the point where Steve finally flushed with indignation. Did Tony really think he'd never been exposed to pornography before?
At least, aside the idiocy that had been throwing himself at Captain Perfect-Lips, the trip was fun so far. It might not go completely according to his plan, but they were having a good time. Even the stupid roadside attractions were kind of growing on Tony. After leaving Gettysburg, they’d been to the ‘Greatest Pancake Place Ever’, had taken a detour to Woodrow Wilson’s library (Thanks to Steve’s and Sam’s nagging), and Rhodey and him had taken the most epic selfie of all times in front of a giant robot statue in Buena Vista.
“Don’t be jealous, snookum,” Tony called and when he walked by, he pressed a kiss on Rhodey’s head. “You’ll always be my first.”
Tony thought for a moment, then sighed. “No. They’ve always been close. He hired her, after all. I’m sure the letter is genuine.”
Bucky grinned and looked up at Natasha. “She talked his ear off about her dead poodle and he nearly died because he was too enamored with her to tell her to stop.”
It all seemed so surreal. Half of the time, Steve expected Tony to simply access Extremis, work on some blueprint, write emails, or just read the news. But instead, he was staring into space, and whenever Steve asked what was going on inside his head, he said that it felt a lot like a giant phantom pain.
A small murmur of complaint rumbled through her throat as her weight was shifted, but otherwise, she held perfectly still. “I have to be in DC in a few hours. You should get more sleep,” she said gently, placing a hand on his cheek. “It’s still dark outside.”
Excusing himself, he headed towards one of the bathrooms. Instead of going in, however, he walked further along the corridors, and came to a halt in front of the large windows. There was a minor storm outside, the wind rustling through the trees and distant flashes illuminating the jungle.
Steve's hands settled on Tony's ass as soon as he got a lap-full of him, and he watched him with admiration as he spoke. He still felt a little guilty for making Tony's life harder, but it wasn't easy to keep that track of thought when Tony ground against him. And when he mentioned fucking on Tony's CEO desk, well… That stirred a reaction, even as Steve laughed at the audacity of it.
“Bruce, I’m back,” he said into the phone, finally getting a hold of himself, though his voice still came out blurry through lips numb with shock.
, wasn’t it? Almost instantly, his gaze wandered across the motel room, across the abstract painting, and for some reason, he couldn’t doubt Tony’s words. The room, everything had always seemed just the tiniest bit off, like it was something that didn’t belong in Steve’s world.
“Yeah, because your future is so bright and shiny,” Tony mumbled, though there was a hint of a question in there.
. Steve all but charged into the room, in complete battle-stance and looking around frantically. “What,” he gasped, and stared down to where Bucky and Natasha were seated on the floor. They were curled up around each other, with his back pressed against the wall, and her legs wound tightly around his middle to keep him still. She wasn’t quite sitting in his lap, but it was a close call.
FRIDAY informed him of Vision now watching him from the Quinjet’s side, but Tony ignored it. With everything else happening right now, he couldn’t afford to think about any of this. He needed to stay focused, and if he agonized about the fact that JARVIS was no more, there was every chance he’d lose his mind.
A second later, though, Ultron jumped on top of the truck and approached Steve with an upraised hand and calculating red eyes. “You know what’s in that cradle?” he asked without preliminaries, his voice vicious, as he fired a repulsor blast at him. “The power to make real change. And that
, but… at times, there had been so much sadness and fear in Tony’s eyes, and he hadn’t known why, but it had been there nevertheless.
“See, that’s where you’re wrong. Assuming that I was the good guy in this,” she said with a fond smile. “I wasn’t. I could’ve helped him back then. If I had tried—
Bucky was very still for a long moment and Steve reached over to grasp his shoulder. He didn't know what to say. It was easy to see how much it moved Bucky that someone would think to make his life easier this way. The set of his jaw was evidence enough that he was exerting some self control to not react on emotion alone.
Tony's words had reverberated in Steve's mind for hours after he'd left the workshop. How they could be spending time together, talk a bit. Something had changed in the way he saw Tony, a minute shift in perception, Steve could admit as much to himself. He knew these visions had something to do with it, but… a part of him wondered if that mattered. Even if it was the visions, would that make the change any less real? Tony had opened up to him, had actually bothered to give their friendship a try, and in the great scheme of things, Steve figured a few skewed magical visions of them didn’t matter.
“I saw your look, earlier,” Tony explained. “When he turned away from you. You don’t have to worry. You’re his hero, I’m always telling him that you’re not there only because you try to make the world a better place.”
Tony grinned suggestively, one hand travelling around Steve and coming to rest on his ass. He loved how flustered Steve looked right now, how completely ready to
“I’ve had my big night. I’m ready for my big something else.” To emphasize his point, he pressed his palm against the bulge through Tony’s slacks, smiling his satisfaction when Tony moaned in return and thrust slightly against him.
“TMI,” Clint immediately said, then there were a few second of absolute silence, before Steve’s hesitant voice resounded inside the helmet. “I’m one minute out.”
For now, his hands remained where they were, and instead of shoving Tony off, he let his fingers brush over the mob of his dark curls.
Her voice was so soothing. He could almost believe her words. He was quivering and lost as he looked up at Natalia, losing himself in her familiar steely-green eyes. “Так не должно было случиться,” he said brokenly.
The interaction looked pleasant enough, but there really was no need to guess where Phil’s loyalty lay. When he’d arrived at the facility a little bit after noon, flanked by a busty blonde and a feisty girl with shoulder-length brown hair, it had taken Tony all of five minutes to know that Phil wouldn’t even give his arguments the time of day.
Barnes had been unconscious ever since the Iron Legion suit had plucked him out of the air, the stress of the past few days apparently more than his broken brain could handle. And Tony knew the injuries that extended past the physical were going to be even harder to recover from.
“Come on, sweetheart, talk to me,” Steve said softly, and laid a hand on Tony’s chest, caressing the skin around the arc reactor.
,” Tony said, voice choked, and he fisted both hands in Steve’s shirt. “You were mine. You were my—”
Steve’s mouth opened and then closed wordlessly as he tried to think of something to say. Was she talking about sex? “You were a different person then,” he settled on eventually, and those were cheap words, he was well aware. “And everybody makes mistakes.”
Steve sighed. “Not like that,” he amended, trying to gentle his expression a bit. “Just a few hours to clear my head.”
Even after a year of being with Tasha, and it still felt surreal to him. Like a dream. One of those desperate fantasies of domesticity he used to conjure up when he and Steve were teenagers. Having a girl to call his own, someone to come home to after a good day’s work.
A woman stepped forward. “He had fifteen bleeding incidents as a result of dislocation of the Controller Implant after attachment, but has survived them all,” she said with a flat voice. “His cerebral cortex seems to be adapting well to the controller. We expect him to progress to phase four soon, to begin cognitive testing.”
When Tony sat up, Steve turned to look at him. "I shouldn't be wanting this," he told him slowly, surprised at his own words. Some part of him
“No work tonight,” he reminded him, smiling softly when Tony nodded. Tony himself rested his elbows on the table, cradling Steve’s head in his palms as he leaned in for a gentle kiss.
he asked wordlessly. Tony’s eyes went black—they’d played this game often enough—and a frown crept over his face. He blinked himself back into the present, then shook his head. “Nothing.”
Still, they needed to dash forward now, no compromises. Steve wasn’t about to allow HYDRA to keep on with their little hide and seek that had been going on for the better part of the last half year. And experience had shown that the longer they needed to ambush HYDRA’s bases, the larger were the chances of them smuggling Loki’s scepter out in time. There really was no time to back out now. Still, Steve would never forgive himself if something happened to anyone on his team, especially Tony.
Tony’s eyes were a storm of Million emotions at once. “Freedom has a price,” he rasped. “You don’t want to be used, and manipulated, and I grant that. You have some not-so great experiences, so do I. But enforced freedom calls for sacrifice.” He put both hands on Steve’s face, staring at him. “I
Steve’s brow furrowed in consideration. He glanced back to Tony, eyes ablaze with uncertainty. “We still have to meet up with Fury. The sooner the better.”
, was definitely a place that looked very much lived-in. Every room was filled with light, every piece of furniture neat and spotless.
Bucky frowned. “Bullshit.” He got up and fetched another beer from the fridge. Once he came back, he sat down in front of Steve, looking at him with a far more serious expression. “You two… you’re… absolutely nauseating. You’re so sickeningly in love with each other, I can’t imagine a little bit of time travel would suddenly convince Tony this wasn’t a good idea. When I said it started way before 2018, I mean Tony, too. Not that I’ve known him back then, but he talked about it, at your wedding, and he said he’d sometimes wished he could go back and just kiss you when you met, because that might’ve been one of the first things going through his head.”
“So you’re suggesting that… she drowned by accident, because she underestimated the storm?” Fury asked, leaning forward with visible interest.
He wasn’t really complaining. Working in the SI labs was something else entirely, and he had done and created so many things in such a short time, it even made his own head spin a little. He’d invited Bruce over at some point, and together, they’d started developing some new gadgets for the tiny energy department that Stark Industries had installed but never really made use of to this day.
“I can try,” Steve replied on a low moan as Tony pulled both of their fingers out. Then he spread some more lube over Steve’s cock.
There was a bad feeling rising inside Steve’s stomach and his glance fell on a Stark Pad lying on another coffee table. He walked over there, frowning when he didn’t even find the Home Button, but once he raised the thing up, the home screen flashed on and Steve almost fell over in shock.
In the past few days, Steve felt he had grown up. He wasn’t just much stronger now than he had been half a year ago, he also understood so much about himself now that he hadn’t understood before. About who he was and who he wanted to be. About the things he wanted. Because while he and Tony had made love before, he had never initiated anything. He had always waited for Tony to show him what he wanted, so certain anything else would be rejected.
“No it wasn’t. But… dammit, he really was a cunning bastard sometimes.” Tony shook his head. “He knew all along?”
“You wouldn’t,” Steve said, smiling. “But yeah, I will. I always do. We have to stop Rumlow from wreaking any more havoc. It’s the best lead we’ve had on Rumlow in six months, and he won’t stop. I figure I have the best chance of stopping him. I know how he operates.”
When he walked into the penthouse, however—ready to drop everything then and there and grab a quick shower—he was greeted with a sight he didn’t get to see all that often.
“What am I even doing here,” Tony wondered when he closed the casing. He leaned forward, burying his face into the crook of his arm and pressed the phone to his ear. For minutes he kept it there, grimacing at nothing, before he blindly dialed Steve’s number. It took a whole lot longer for him to pick up than it did before, and Tony only realized how relieved he was to hear the free-line signal when it resounded.
. Cautiously, Tony met Steve’s eyes again, and he was completely overwhelmed in his confused compassion. Steve
“Hands off. I know I don’t look like it, but I could shoot you in the head in about one point five seconds.”
Natasha looked so tired, and she didn’t seem to realize it. Where she got her energy from, he’d never know.
Tony opened his eyes for a moment, seeing the light filter into the room. He had no idea what time it was, nor did he particularly care. He was at Steve’s side, and if he’d have any say in the matter, he would stay right here for as long as he could.
Steve nodded, but the corners of his mouth were lifting slightly. “I can kiss it better, if you like.”
Stephanus had bidden him goodbye soon after, with a final kiss and a few murmured declaration of love. There were things the human brain didn’t remember without a trigger, Tony knew that. And Steve’s words were followed by a story that built upon itself as memories broke through the walls of Tony’s mind.
"Stay there," he said once he managed to recover some composure. He shifted off of Tony to grab for the bag and rummage through it.
It was the last part that finally forced him to crack his eyes open to face the offending dim light filtering through his shutters into the room. Clutched in his octopus grip was none other than Tony Stark.
“Exactly,” Steve acknowledged, then took a huge sip of the coffee and made to stand up. Rinsing the cup in the sink, he walked around the kitchen counter. Everything was said, and he really wasn’t in the mood for small talk. “Glad you’re on board,” he told Vision. “I gotta grab a new uniform, this one’s pretty torn. We’ll meet at the hangar in ten—”
Tony shrugged. “It’s not exactly something you can control,” he said quietly, then grinned up at Steve. “Next time, I’m gonna wake you with a pole, though…”
It was a strange feeling to admit that, no, there wasn’t. Not in such a short amount of time, anyway. “Zola’s AI is constantly rewriting itself. It’s not a code I need to crack once, it’s… a Million different codes that are already gonna be invalid once I’m past the first barriers.” He sighed with frustration. “It’s not
Tony should just leave the place, call a cab, and go home. But the notion made him shudder with very unfair worry. Steve didn’t seem like the guy who got drunk on a regular basis, and it might just be Tony’s fault he was in this state, intentional or not.
Ross stiffened at the mention of his past transgression. “Three days, gentlemen,” he said, ignoring Pietro completely. “Miss Romanov. Miss Maximoff.”
“It has buttons and it’ll cover you,” Steve pointed out with amusement taking over his features. “Besides, you’ll probably need at least another day before you don’t have to worry about tearing those stitches. Here, let me.”
“We had a couple of drinks if I remember correctly,” Tony added after a moment, his voice casual even as he fought off Ultron’s attacks in the tanker’s upper level. He paused for a moment, then cleared his throat. “I think that's actually how I got my Bahamas island. He lost it to me during a poker game.”
“Okay?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded. He laced his fingers through Tony’s and caressed his mouth in a loving kiss, then grabbed himself and slowly began to slide inside.
“Steve will know that we can’t help them right now,” Tony told her, hating himself for it, but knowing it was the truth either way.
A sigh from Tony. “I’m afraid we do. I’ve stayed away from home too long already. I can’t put all of the work on Obi’s shoulders. He’s practically leading Stark Industries as it is. It’s time that I step in again and do my part.” He smiled again, brushing a hand over Steve’s back. “To be honest, it’s partly your fault I’m feeling some kind of… motivation rise inside me again. I’ve been without that for a long while, but my fingers are itching to create something now. Thanks to you.”
That had Steve frown and he reached over to console him, putting his own hand on top of Tony’s. “I’d like to think you just needed the right… people around you. To be happy, I mean. There are few days when I don’t see you laugh at least once.”
. The only thought he could grasp, as he looked at himself, was that he missed his beard. It had made him feel like someone else. Shaving it off had only taken a few minutes, but once he’d looked at his clean face and the once-more short hair, he’d felt as though years had passed.
“I love you,” Steve said, trying to make Tony understand. “Whatever happened—it won’t change that. I’m right here.”
“Exactly.” Clint stood up again, petting Steve’s shoulder with a smug smile. “Now do yourself a favor and judge your man by the same standards?”
Tony was standing in front of the mirror, more staring into middle distance than actually looking at his attire.
Steve shrugged. “You spend enough time in the shop, and JARVIS tracked your whereabouts when I worked on it.”
“Shit, I’m an ass,” Tony breathed, stepping away from Steve. He shook his head, as he stared at him. “I’m sorry.”
He needed to climb upwards and when he reached the upper level, Bucky was back on his feet, aiming his gun at him.
Steve shook his head, and took off after Tony. Luckily, the kid was still wobbly on his feet, which meant he couldn't get far very fast. Once he reached him, Steve leaned down and sweeped him up, one arm secure under his knees and the other under his back. Tony might hate him for this, but at least he'd be in one whole piece by the time he sobered up. "Come on," he said, tone level. "It's bedtime."
A small breathy sound. “Guilty as charged,” Steve said. There was a long pause, as if Steve had only planned for a ‘hello’ and not much more. He awkwardly cleared his throat. “Did I wake you?”
Steve shook his head. “No,” he said firmly, frowning down at Tony, who was staring up at him in return. “When I got to Wakanda, I was… I don’t even know what I was. I stayed in the gym most of the day, and when I didn’t do that, I stared out into the jungle. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that numb in my whole life. It was only slowly sinking in, you know? What I’d lost. But when it
Tony tried not to let his nervousness show, but it was a futile thing. Vision and Rhodey had been giving him confused glances on his way up, but he really didn’t have the mind for any explanations.
“I’m not sure I would have now. If Barnes hadn’t given me the weirdest shovel-talk in all history… I thought he’d lost his mind for even thinking this was a possibility.”
Then the sirens had cut through his dream-world and the room around Steve had vanished. Somehow, the night had run away from him. One minute, he’d been with Tony and the next he was back on his cot, and woefully alone at that.
At the end of the day, Steve was back where he had started. And while he was grateful for the opportunity Senator Brandt was giving him, serving his country by doing fund-raising shows, he knew it wasn’t all he could do.
Tony didn’t move, not even his eyes were flickering. “They can’t stop it. Both the solar particles and the molecules in the planet’s atmosphere are directed by the magnetic field. They’re colliding, causing each other to burst into lights. It needs a very specific set of circumstances to bring them together, but once those circumstances are given, they create…
Something inside him broke then, his resolve to leave Los Angeles behind—to go back to Hell—crumbling to dust.
Tony nodded, racing at Ultron and throwing him to the ground. It didn’t last long; just long enough for him to land a few brutal punches before Ultron tossed him off.
Swallowing, Tony brushed a finger over the back of Steve’s hand. He wasn’t fully sure he knew what Steve was trying to say, because the thing he was hinting at couldn’t possibly be true.
Tony was biting back a snarky comment, and instead took a deep breath. “How about you just make a new one? We’ll have to get you new passports and such, anyways.”
The small smile that appeared at the corners of Natasha’s mouth told him that both of those assumptions were one hundred percent right.
—had put every ounce of skill to portray Tony just as he always saw him… sitting right in the center of all that energy, all that rawness and passion falling into his being from every direction.
, was to try and stop the team from splitting up. I tried to protect them, over and over again. And where did that get us? It was futile! I obviously wasn’t fit for the job, and I can’t watch them grieve and struggle all over again—for
Tony smiled, turning around and grabbing for Steve’s hand. He pulled it to his mouth and kissed his palm. “I’m not some embittered housewife, darling. I can deal with being neglected for a while." It was a lie. In the past days, he had been
Tony frowned, then tapped on the screen, and FRIDAY’s voice resounded. “The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within a day after your request, boss. He was met by this man.”
He knew he was overstepping certain borders, but the last time he’d had sex had been a while ago, and being horny usually made him lose whatever was left of his modesty. Anyway, the guy had seemed more taken aback than angry at Tony’s advances. And besides, MIT would rather burn down the science faculty than reprimand the ‘Stark heir’.
, Tony’s mind supplied in a haze and he responded with an appreciative hum. And true enough, Steve’s arm were around him, pulling him against his chest while he ever-so-clumsily pressed kisses against Tony’s lips.
Steve was always beautiful when lost in pleasure, biting his lips as he did, whole body quivering, but this was something different entirely. He was enthralled by the stretch of Steve’s ass around him, the way it was clenching around him so good. And
The words warmed Steve at first, but as soon as they settled in his head, he felt himself freeze. He pulled his hands back slightly, and stared at Tony’s face. “I never told you about Bucky.”
What had Bruce once said about timelines and multiverses? Before you knew what was what—whether you’ve traveled to another dimension or another time—, you had to be very careful not to mess anything up. But Steve… he’d, well… either way, he’d gone forward, not back, right? So nothing he could say would really cause any problems. At least, he hoped so. Besides, he would need help getting back. He didn’t have a clue about interdimensional travel.
good guy, and more importantly: they were happy—still happy, even after three years and counting. After a rocky start, they had ended up becoming one of those sickeningly cute couples that still kissed and hugged and caressed each other whenever they had the chance. They bickered and argued, too, sure… sometimes more than Tony was comfortable with, but they loved each other, they
Tony cast him a long glance. “Thanks.” He put a hand over his eyes and shook his head. “I’ve never done anything like that before.”
Steve nodded, and they made their way through the large ammunition storage. For a brief second, the familiar scents of oil, gunpowder and fuel brought about a nostalgic memory of his time here. It only lacked the smell of sweat and hard work, but it was enough to push him forward.
At that moment, Hill walked up next to them, staring down at Tony with something that wasn’t quite horror, but not much else either. “Get him inside, then we’ll discuss what happened.”
Tony shook his head, smiling. “Trust me, I’m the furthest from being sad than I have been in months.”
It felt good for the first few seconds; watching the pain on Steve’s face as he twisted the knife to see how much he could make him bleed. Anger was easy. He knew Steve’s anger now. And if he was honest with himself, the pain that followed extended to the very beginning of their relationship.
“Of course it is,” Rhodey agreed. And then—because the guy was secretly still a major nerd, he linked his own pinky finger around Tony’s and said, “This is our big moment.”
Steve cast him a firm, disapproving look that instantly vanished when he took the phone from Sam. The choked noise that left his lips went mercifully uncommented. They looked so…
, but you also have to understand why I’m doing this.” He made a vague motion in the direction their surroundings. “This is proof why we need to do what we do.”
“No,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice firm and strong. “No one got injured. Just a few scrapes and burns.”
“And once more, you’re wrong,” Strange said as he walked over to them. His ridiculous red cloak was fluttering in the light breeze as he stepped up next to them. “It’ll become a place of remembrance.”
Thanks to the serum, Steve had excellent night vision, and despite the dimness, he could see—not perfectly, but probably better than Tony. He turned to look at him from where he was perched against the wall, still catching his breath. The collapse had been unexpected, and he was worried about Tony.
Steve wanted to step in and kiss Tony when Dummy suddenly took off in a speed-roll across the room—and towards a different exit door. The move was so spontaneous that it took a few seconds for Steve to register in which direction he’d darted.
“Right,” Steve rasped, once more fully aware of how small this room was. He guessed it was what he should’ve expected. There
“Didn’t he say we should talk to Coulson?” Sam asked. “One of his agents was one of the new enhanced, right?”
“What, not yet?” Tony asked. “You have plenty of play left in you before bedtime, don’t you?” He lowered his voice. “How about a quick flip before I go?”
"Got any water?" he asked in a half amused tone as he watched Tony approaching and… Steve’s eyes once more dropped to his ragged workshop clothes, and the grease on his arms… and his chest with that round blue light fixed in it… and his neck... Tony’s neck had the sort of elegant curve that, as in artist, Steve could only call beautiful.
“It’s fine. I know what you meant,” Tony said, laughing. He smiled at Steve warmly. “And you’ll do just fine, Steve. I don’t think I can be much of help. You always knew far better how to get my head out of my ass. Just be yourself. I happen to like that.”
Tony swallowed. He had no idea why Barnes was entrusting him with any of this highly private information, but…
“We can’t… destroy them…” the Sorcerer Supreme said, gasping with the strain. “Not without setting their power free once more.”
Tentatively, Steve laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder to get his attention. That got him a questioning stare, and Steve opened his mouth to speak, to ask Tony once more if he was all right, when he noticed it. Tony was
unfair. Steve didn’t get to cry over that lost chance, the what-if they’d never gotten to try. “It killed me. It made me… I don’t even know what it made me, and I didn’t realize how much you had changed my life until it was changed. Until…” Steve stifled a shaky breath, wiping his eyes irritably with one hand. “Until you stood on the other side of this… this
In any case, there hadn’t been much to debrief, but Bucky knew Steve had been grateful for that symbol of normalcy.
The golden ring was perfectly smooth on the outside, but beneath the surface, there were… small fragments. Tiny splitters that almost looked like…
"Tests came back clean, but we're still waiting for some final results," Bruce answered with a shrug. "Whatever it was, you metabolized it already. It left no detectable residue in your system."
The softness in Steve’s voice surprised Tony, and he flashed him a smile over his shoulder. This was perhaps the most civil conversation they’d ever had, and it felt as if that thick fog of animosity that had been clouding each of their interactions after their initial meeting had finally lifted.
And then Natasha had asked him to join them on their road trip. And suddenly he was where he was. Standing next to Tony, and realizing for the first time, that what he’d taken for a close friendship might’ve always been something else entirely.
Soon after, Tony and Cooper were found sitting in front of the fireplace, super glue and a few more tools Steve doubted were safe for children placed on the floor next to them. Ever so often, Steve looked over and felt a deep yearning coil around his heart. Tony looked so
If there hadn’t been some sort of feelings already, they both likely wouldn’t have just dropped all reservations and stumbled into bed together.
“Good,” Tony murmured against his lips. “Have to get used to it. It’s only diapers and sleepless nights from here on out. Very unsexy.”
Tony stilled, and it took him a moment to gather himself at what was obviously an answer he hadn’t expected, before he answered. “Sure,” he said stiffly. “That’s… that’s a great idea.”
He pressed his face into Steve’s shoulder, breathing him in. No, he wasn’t made for flings anymore, at least, not when it came to Steve. And he wouldn’t walk away unscathed. His thoughts were still too jumbled, too confused, too out there to be given a label, but he knew, deep down in his gut, that he wanted this.
Tony smiled as he looked up to him, patting the empty space on the mattress, inviting Steve to join him. “I know. It’s so 2013,” he joked weakly and motioned for Steve’s hand as soon as he was in reach. Tony put the tablet aside and entwined their fingers. Tentatively, he pulled Steve down. The second he reclined, Steve found himself with an armful of Tony. The earthy scent of his hair tickled his nostrils, the steady drum of his heart beat soundly against Steve’s chest, the warmth of his skin enveloped him, and Steve felt as close to peace as he had since the night Ultron had stepped into their living room.
"You're only gonna sit there and mope, and then you're going to waste months of your life wondering what if and I can't sit here and let that happen. He invited me to SI? Well, guess what: I'm going. And you're coming with."
Steve was at a loss for words and neither of them spoke for a long moment, watching the oven as it baked the pizza with its fiery heat.
With his free arm wrapped around Tony, Steve held him steady and jerked him off in quick, familiar motions, and it didn't take long for the heat to rise to Tony's face, making him look a little feverish. It was such a lovely look on him, needy as he was, especially when Steve knew he was the cause of it. "You're so pretty…" he said, enjoying the little sounds Tony made at his teases.
Bruce glanced wordlessly out of the window. It looked as if he sat in Tony’s and his shared workshop. “You know… You, Tony, and Steve, you both have a point. We can’t go on like this, but we can’t let ourselves be put on a leash either. So tricking Ross into believing he’s in control while we really solve the problem at hand… maybe that’s the compromise we’ll have to deal with for a while.”
“You look about ready to punch me,” Tony commented, but did as he was told, anyway. Probably didn’t have a choice in the matter.
Steve sat next to Sam. He’d changed into a black T-shirt and jeans. Over the growl of the engine he and Natasha discussed the best way to infiltrate the Helicarriers while they were still on the ground. They cut off as the tablet in Tony’s palm began to beep. He didn’t look down at it, didn’t need to, his black eyes still fixed on Steve. “Insight’s launching in sixteen hours.”
Tony huffed. Steve was behaving a bit strange, wasn’t he? He took a detailed look at their surroundings with some resignation. “So you’re… absolutely sure you wanna take this stupid mystery ghost tour?”
"Nothing fancy, don't get your expectations too high," Steve said, still smiling fondly at him. "I was thinking we could go back to bed, finish what we started…" He paused, casting Tony a suggestive look. "And after that, maybe catch a movie in the media room, or we can go for a little walk on the premise." He considered for a moment, then nodded his head. "We usually train twice a day, but I'm sure the team won't mind having the morning off, and Natasha can take over later."
“I’ve never danced with anyone before.” Tony looked at him expectantly. When he didn’t budge, he rolled his eyes. “You gonna make me dance by myself?”
“Look,” Steve said enthusiastically, “the late ghost tour starts from the visitor center. And that looks a lot better than all of those crazy Halloween tours, anyways. Do we have the time for that?”
Tony shook his head as he reached into his back pocket, drawing out a small key. There was only one single door on this floor and Steve’s heartbeat quickened when they all walked closer. “No,” Tony said. “He’s on a business trip. He said something about a big deal.”
“JARVIS, what’s the quickest route?” Steve asked, as he began climbing up the hill, jumping the few feet easily up the front slope. He raised his shield, quickly positioning himself.
Bruce sighed. “Look, I wish I could help you, but this isn’t exactly my field of expertise, and if I’m honest, I’m still having trouble working with your programming language. Does it… I don’t know… get enough power?”
Steve loved seeing Tony so passionate about something. There was a lot of science involved in wilderness survival, in the discovery of this dimension, and Tony obviously enjoyed making use of it a lot.
There was no conversation after that, and they ended up walking into the workshop a few moments later. "This Tony Stark's lab?" Bucky called from the doorway, as they both glanced into the room.
In a way, it amazed Tony that after everything he had seen in those last days, that he still managed to be captured by the propensity in which a situation could progress from bad to worse.
Thor clapped a hand on his shoulder, and Tony pointedly didn’t wince at his tight grip. “I did explain Steven’s situation to the Vanir’s shamans, and they were confident that the antidote would have the same effect on him as on everyone else.”
Approved by 117 countries. It states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they’ll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel, only when and if that Panel deems it necessary.”
“You don’t leave me a choice, do you?” Bruce shot back, grinning now as he brushed past Tony to take hold of the microscope again. He looked, for all the world, like an excited little child. It was pretty awesome. “Now, get back to work.”
Tony looked over his shoulders, raising a brow. Steve already wore his full Captain America gear, sans the helmet and shield. “We ready to leave?”
When Steve took a step on the stairway, however, he spotted Thor freezing on the level right above the one they were heading for now. There was a familiar red shimmer wafting along his head, and Steve could see his arms flex with inward tension. “Thor!” he called. “Status?”
“Are you sure that’s the smartest move?” Bucky broke the silence as everyone took up various positions in the two cars. Sam shared the van with Wanda, Pietro and Scott, while Steve drove the Beetle with Clint and Bucky.
.” On the next beat, time seemed to freeze. It seemed that the Stones’ power began to seep into Nebula’s body, making it light up from within.
He brushed his nose along Steve's neck, pressing kisses to his skin here and there. When he looked up, Steve's eyes were already closed and his breaths evening out. He leaned up a bit to reach his mouth, taking Steve's face between his hands and kissing him gently. There was no need to hurry now—they had time. He kissed the corners of Steve's mouth before coaxing him to open his mouth and suckling at his tongue.
Steve hit the punching bag hard. He didn’t know how long he’d been going, but the sun was already up, and he was so tired that the gym benches were starting to look like the queen-size bed in Tony’s room.
He reached for the remote control and motioned for his companions that it was time to leave. “So, there are contingencies. Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.”
Tony cocked his head sideways at him and smiled. “So. That’s a surprise. You haven’t switched timelines all by yourself, have you?”
Steve shivered hard and shook his head at his dark thoughts, sitting down onto the worn mattress of his motel room bed. It squeaked with how heavy he was. Wincing, Steve checked if he’d broken something—
Steve drew a deep breath and willed himself closer to the office door. The reaction from those he passed was noteworthy, but otherwise ignored. He knew he probably didn’t look all that happy.
“Steve…” Tony started as he pulled back. He opened his mouth to say more, but it was then that sirens resounded all around Steve and he jerked awake.
Soon after Clarksville, however, the traffic became insane. There were hundreds of people everywhere, watching the sky, and others recording the event with their telescopes and cameras.
Steve looked far less flustered than Tony expected him to be. “Whatever gets you going,” he shot back.
“I’m so glad you’re here,” Steve breathed against Tony’s lips. It was the same aching desperation that he’d kissed him with yesterday—the sort of desperation that came with too many hours being alone, and too much pent-up energy. But back then, Steve’s lips had curled upward then in a futile, however endearing attempt to keep from smiling. His kisses had been insistent, and full of relief and joy.
“What is it you want, Captain?” Tony demanded. “You come here every night, looking as innocent as a freaking angel. That will stop now.”
And that, Steve thought, is why teenagers weren't supposed to drink. It made them irrational to the point of pain. Steve only took a moment to recover from the shock. He'd never been so angrily dismissed, aside for a few occasions with Bu—that was a bad direction to go.
“I know,” he said, smiling, “but I wasn’t talking about your body, darling. That one’s kinda perfect, too, sure, but… I meant
“What?” Steve asked a bit dumbly. It was so strange that anyone would find him remotely attractive. It was then that he noticed that he was wearing his pyjama pants and a shirt that was admittedly way too tight for his new body. Still. It didn’t justify how hard that man was hitting on him. “This doesn’t make any sense. I shouldn’t be here.”
“We were just lost,” Steve whispered, because it was true. Both of them had been lost, lonely, searching. Enemies, friends, then enemies again—and yet always feeling the pull. Inevitably drawn to each other.
"Now you're being silly," Steve said, grinning at Tony even as his dick twitched at the favorable tease. He'd had to stifle a chuckle at Tony's indignant refusal to go dry—He really should know Steve better than that. He reached for Tony's hand and held it in his own before turning him gently towards the suit that was still leaning against the wall beside them. He crouched to pick up the box of vaseline he'd retrieved earlier and presented it to Tony. "Think I'd start anything if I hadn't found this?" He raised an eyebrow in a mild challenge, though he was still smiling.
Bucky moved the arm up and down, then left and right. Making a fist, then releasing a finger one by one. He smiled. How Tony still managed to improve the arm’s movements was beyond him. Every time he thought it worked perfectly now, and every time, he was proven wrong.
Fury huffed. “You got that right.” There was a meek edge to his voice and Steve felt his anger deflate somewhat.
“And you and Tony,” Bucky continued, “trust me, you two have practically been joined at the hip since you… well…
As it was, the battle against Loki and the Chitauri lasted only a day, and yet it took every bit of strength from Steve. Loki had tasted dirt when the Hulk had smashed him into the ground. The egomaniac hadn’t expected how well the Avengers would work together, and he certainly hadn’t expected Hulk to storm into the penthouse and take him out for good. No, he’d obviously thought he pretty much had all the time in the world. Time to hold speeches, make a flashy entry, but at the end of the day, he’d lost the battle.
There were two more calls of heavy silence before it was Tony’s phone that started ringing. It was in the middle of the night, and Tony was in his empty, giant bed, doing what he liked to call ‘trying not to lose your shit over the fucking what-ifs of life’. And yes, he’d taken the damn phone into his bedroom, so what. He obviously couldn’t risk anyone to find it, and there was still one super-spy living under his roof so… better safe than sorry.
“Any luck over there?” Tony ground out in Bruce’s direction, despair mingling with reason. “Painkillers? Or alcohol, how about alcohol.”
“I wouldn’t know.” Tony heaved a great breath. “Look… I got sent back to make sure the team remained a team. That we would be a strong, united force once the Day of Doom arrives. If I tell you all the reasons you and I eventually ended up wanting to kill each other, I’m not sure it’ll all work out. You could start to hate me again.”
Tony shrugged. “Stuff happens.” He paused, appraising the man with a pensive eye. “Is that why you still cut him out?”
Coming to a decision, Steve stood up. There was a long and heavy moment of tense silence between them, before he moved closer. Cautiously, he pushed a hand down on her shoulder, and—with a very soft breath—Natasha made that last step and let him draw her in.
"Gym," he said then, grabbing Tony's hand and leading him under the staircase towards the large doors that led to the training area.
Steve smiled, a bit disbelieving that Tony would admit something like that. “Don’t say such things. If you say things like that we really must be close to dying.”
Tony smiled and Steve was almost sure his eyes were at least a bit watery. “We grew up together. Otherwise I’d be all over you, buddy.”
Tony believed him. Even though Steve never liked Extremis, he knew he hadn’t wanted for this to happen. Only then he saw the horrible burn mark on Steve’s waist, and cursed. “Shit, that was me, wasn’t it?”
“Give Ian a kiss for us, yeah?” Steve asked Bucky. The words were out of his mouth before he remembered that Bucky wasn’t exactly allowed near Ian at the moment.
“No, I haven’t,” Tony whispered, then cleared his throat. “People die. We try to prevent it, but in the grand scheme of things, we all know it’ll keep on happening.”
“Not cool, Picasso,” he snapped, slapping a hand against Steve’s chest for good measure, but he already knew there was no use in fighting. Besides, this was oddly nice, he thought. Warm, and kind of comfortable. He let his head fall on Steve’s shoulder with a tired sigh, vaguely noticing that they were nearing the dormitories.
