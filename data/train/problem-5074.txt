And at that, Sam shuts his eyes tight against the inevitable wetness and thinks, not for the first time,
Siri chimes, volume low from Dean’s single open-ear earbud. Then,
what it looks like Cas did. His whole head is soaked, his hair – longer than it ever was as an angel – slicked and dripping and curling at the ends. His face and neck shine with water and sweat; the gray of his –

Dean. We still have time, and Cas and I are so close to figuring it out, I swear, there’s crossroads lore and soul magic we haven’t even—” and he falls into abrupt silence as he catches sight of Dean’s face. The sick look of fearful shock he must see there. Dean can practically see Sam run through his last words, and his expression goes distinctly hunted.
08:15 AM  04/01/07
Castiel hums a single, tranquil note. “Now, it’s time to find Dean.”
I’m just a guy, Cas, really not that interesting.
“Of course. Give Sam my regards?”
Castiel may only know what Dean’s told him, but it’s enough to know this. He steps back, this time in genuine fear. “Trickster.”
“Cas!” Sam suddenly bellows at Dean’s ear (um,
“Yes,” Cas says, half into the blood-warm skin of Dean’s dick and half into his own fingers. “Yes,” and Dean has no idea if he’d actually said the words aloud or not but Cas is answering him all the same.
“You’re such a flirt,” Sam accuses, exasperation and reluctant amusement.
“Wow,” Dean says, grinning madly.
Dean huffs a nearly imperceptible sigh. Message received, loud and clear. Dean reaches under the counter for a bottle of syrup, just in case.
whispers a thought. It sounds suspiciously like Sam.
out there!”
03:27 PM  12/07/07
Dean presses his face deep into his pillow, Cas’s words spinning out in his mind on an infinite loop. Words that Cas had thought out and made a conscious decision to share; words spoken with sincere, open emotion;
“Impatient,” Cas clucks.
But…?
Kid’s a genius. Everything’s a personal interest, the nerd.
“Dean.”
He understands that others don’t…feel the things he feels. Emotion without cause, the pull, the
I’m not going to kill you.”
“Are you really standing with Dean on this? I’m worried, Sam. It’s been over a week. Call me, please.”
Uh, did you tell them to fuck off?
“I’ve been hunting for
Cas huffs a laugh. “Is that a hint?”
“No deal.”
“Cool,” Dean says, nodding at nothing in particular, “cool cool.” Oh, god,
Well.
It’s Benny’s off day, meaning Dean runs the grill, and Dean doesn’t even know the guy’s decided to come back until he gets a break in orders on the tail end of the lunch rush. Dean comes out from the kitchen to check on Krissy and Max manning the front and immediately spots him, sat in his usual corner and focus seemingly 100% on his steaming coffee mug.
Jesus, you actually knew the guy? What the hell, that’s such a dick move!
Cas lifts Dean’s hand to press a lush kiss at the base of Dean’s palm and, hot fan of breath, says, “A mouth not near as beautiful as yours.”
10:51 PM  03/09/07
“Well,” Sam says, slow, and fidgetingly tucks his hair behind his ears. “What if, what if we don’t? I mean, it really looks like she’s just hanging around. And I know we don’t know her story yet, but Cas is looking into it, right?” A slight nod from Dean. “What if we just try to talk to her?”
Great way to start the week, right?
, Sam tried summoning Ruby, which ultimately led to, you guessed it, a whole lot of nothing.

when one of the rolling wheels catches on an errant highlighter – and goes to make more coffee.

Dean’s fingers follow the thread, cataloging the well-loved features Dean, by this point, knows practically as well as his own. He moves to trace the shape of Cas’s plush, smiling mouth.
07:48 PM  05/30/07
09:33 AM  03/10/07
“Hello, Sam,” the man rumbles, voice whiskey-dark and rough as sin. His eyes slide to Dean. Fuck,
Just Cas is cool though, right?
That’s me, sad sack of shit with a sad sack, fucked up life.
Anael lets her overwhelming fondness speak for her; only shakes her head and reaches to take one of Castiel’s hands in both of her own. She smiles sadly, eyes shining and he sees it clearly: her awe of his choice, her fear and determination and a whisper of envy, most dangerous of all.
this aint my first rodeo
Dean unceremoniously slides a plate onto the table, jerky with nerves, and the man’s gaze falls heavy to the stack of warm pancakes set before him.
10:56 PM  03/09/07

“Dean, what— It’s been
“She could have me killed just for listening to this tosh,” Crowley mutters, raising the glass to take a healthy sip. He immediately grimaces, squaring Castiel a begrieved look and tipping him the drink. “Really? This is the best you can do?”
“I am, too. But we won’t, not today.”

“I meant
There’s a basket on the doorstep and two curly, wiggling, whining puppies nestled in the blankets inside.
For now, though, he props himself casually against the counter and allows his grin to spread a slight bit wider. “Howdy.”
“Oh my god, shut up,” Dean gripes, even as he fights down a smile. “Don’t laugh at me! I was totally getting somewhere!”
09:11 PM  01/02/08
Sam and I hunt monsters.
``````
Fucking Hemingway.
“Shit, I— I gotta go. I just, fuckin’ embarrassing, I gotta—”
Dude.
The man barks a laugh, seemingly startled into it. Castiel sways another few inches left. “Easy there, homeslice. I’m not here to hurt you.”
, thank you very much – when the bell above the door alerts him that his attention is needed at the register. Dean turns to see two customers, a man and a woman accompanied by a gust of chill November air, enter the shop and approach the counter. The woman, a redhead in a sharp, dark pea coat, catches Dean’s eye and smiles a greeting while her companion hangs a half-step behind, focus seemingly consumed by the menu board above and behind Dean’s back.
They eventually break away, panting damp breaths into the minimal space between them.
03:13 PM  04/10/07
It was nice knowing you, Cas.
my forgiveness. It’d better be good.”
It’s Castiel, surprisingly, who’s first to break the silence. “Dean,” he intones, squinting out at the alley, towards the club they had oh-so-hastily vacated. “Why is sex important to you?”
ive got it handled
If you could…if you had to choose, you know?
Dean draws up to the curb, his cane resting lightly at its edge. There’s a woman to his left complaining loudly into her phone – the tinny replies from her equally impassioned conversation partner obvious even from a distance – and a group casually chatting to his right. He waits, sun warming his shoulders and back and humming idly to the low sounds of passing traffic.
Bullshit, we talk all the time! You could’ve brought it up!
06:11 PM  02/06/08
A month, and Castiel has developed an acute sense of sympathy for any and all law enforcement ever tasked with tracking and apprehending Sam and Dean Winchester.
09:45 PM  05/16/07
06:16 PM  02/06/08
Juan accepts Castiel at his word, and Castiel steps forward to smooth a crumpled piece of paper to the counter. “Please, I realize it’s late and this will take time, but I must receive these marks as soon as possible.”
He whips the door open, gun up and ready and sights set between two wide, ocean-deep eyes.
“There,” the demon sighs, finally turning to face Castiel fully. His true face twists, keen and fiendishly pleased. “That’s better.”
The man’s eyes go wide in shock.
Whoa, when did this get to be about me?!
“Lilith.”
05:37 PM  11/20/07
“Hello?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, irritable. “I heard you the first twenty times.”
, Dean. You make me happy. I don’t want to date. I don’t want anyone but you.”
``````
leave the TV on.
01:28 PM  03/19/07
“I know what I want.” Castiel digs into one oversized pocket to pull out a cell phone. “I have a photograph.”
Give me five days, tops. If you haven’t heard from either of us by then…
He’s been so on edge, since he’d been brought back home, he jumps whenever Cas walks into the room.
He’d guessed the name because it was the only one Dean had mentioned, so far, that he’d said without an edge of terror.
It feels gentle, like Cas’s hand in his hair. Like his voice when they whisper at night.
In front of him, Bobby is frowning as he listens.
Dean shifts his weight, and hugs his middle, as he waits for Cas’s judgement.
little boy. Who’d run off with his purse. He’s staring right back at Cas, face pale and drawn and anxious.
“You just told me you were hurt.”
She’d purchased nothing but the use of a mill for a few minutes, a mill which operates not off the power of Alastair’s efforts but off the power of the public town river.
The tiredness is always heavy enough to seep down to his bones.
It’s a response he is unable to give, as all he seems able to do at the moment is hesitantly offer his thought out loud, surrendering it to her to either accept or reject.
He starts to wonder if he should go home.
He catches the last instant of the surprise on the man’s face before it’s wiped away by a bright smile.
Whatever it is though, it makes him think of how flustered Cas looked when Dean didn’t respond to him that morning, and how for some reason he seemed embarrassed when he cooked last night, and how isolated this house is from absolutely anything.
You tell me that you love me, and I believe you. But love is not an excuse to treat people however you want. It is not a magic word under which all sins become acceptable. It is wrong for you to have stopped me from going to college. It is wrong for you to force Dean to stay belonging to me. It is wrong of you to override my choices because you think you know better. That these things are done out of love doesn’t make them less wrong.
Cas’s dad sounds like someone Dean would have liked to belong to.
He feels his mind flinch away from the thought like its been burned, and his body wants to follow, wants to snatch his hand back from his brother and let him leave, to stop embarrassing himself, to stop imagining he is worth anything but pity.
When he finishes cooking the food, he goes to fetch a few clean rags, and comes back, handing one to Sam.
carefully casual.
Dean blinks, confused.
It’s the best thing he’s ever eaten, and he was right, he was
Like how touching doesn’t always feel bad, to him. Like how he hasn’t held someone’s hand since he was nine and his father was scared they’d be separated in the market.
Dean lets out a sound that makes Cas blush harder than he had when Dean took his clothes off.
“We are.” Cas answers. “And you’re Mr. Lafitte, I assume?”
Sam. He’d
“How long have you been bruised like this?” Bobby asks, and Dean immediately goes back on his word.
“Dean,” he had whispered, overcome, with no intention but to speak the word like a prayer.
It feels nice.
Also, if you didn't see, I updated the Wander Home mini-story "Belonging." This takes place in the future after The Outside ends, and is generally spoiler free, though it obviously gives away some basic things about how this story ends (like where they all end up and stuff).
I have sent the courier along once again with this letter. The suggested coursework I promised you is enclosed. I also again wanted to express how wonderful it was to meet you and your family, and how excited I am to have such a bright young man under my tutelage. Your questions were delightful, and I can only hope that I have answered them to your satisfaction.
Their faces are drawn and tight, their bodies thin as a voice hoarse from screaming. He sees dirt caked children standing by themselves, and drunkards still reeking of alcohol pushing their way in front of them. Women with hollow cheeks and men with heavy eyes look passively on, and somewhere an infant cries like a trumpet for food that will not come.
, his spring-thick coat not nearly enough to protect him against the weather and the wind. His teeth are chattering like gossiping women, and his fingers are as numb and stiff as stone.
Real to everyone. Dean skims the rest of the story blankly, knowing what happens. The fairy turns the rabbit actually real, real in its own right, alive and able to move and play independently from the boy.
Delicate and dangerous and small.
He doesn’t know it until he speaks it, but once he speaks it he’d known from the start.
Staring up at the dark night sky, Cas feels sadness consume the both of them.
Sam had listened. He’d listened, even when the things Dean spoke about made less and less sense, and became harder and harder to hear.
The man drops it for now. Dean tells himself he can have some cereal tomorrow, if he’s good.
Alastair raises an eyebrow, and looks down at the paper. Cas can see him considering whether he’s going to humor him, or just shut the door in his face.
“What I need you to do,” Cas says solemnly. “Is take care of yourself. The rest can come later.”
“Can’t choose tonight,” Dean replies. “Too tired.”
Cas thinks, but any exasperation he might be inclined to feel is overwhelmed with the relief of having his suspicions confirmed.
“Love is choice,” Sam answers. “Love is being able to go anywhere in the world and still coming home at the end of the day. Love is saying, ‘there’s a million ways for me to be happy, but this is the one I choose.’”
“Cas isn’t an asshole.”
Thanks so much for all your encouragement :) Pls leave a comment if you enjoyed or have any ideas about what should happen later on. As always, you can also come chat with me at https://ao3gingerswag.tumblr.com :)
He’s bone-tired, tonight.
It is, he knows it.
Now that he thinks about it, doctors cost money too. A
“I hope you don’t mind if I join you.” Says Cas, pulling out two bowls from the cabinet. “I’ve been up for a while, but I haven’t eaten yet. I often skip breakfast.”
He’s been in this town for less than an hour, and already it’s almost brought him to tears.
Cas makes a humming sound, then moves something and starts cutting again. It’s not bread that he’s cutting.
Weeks pass. Everything changes, and nothing changes.
It’s Sam’s, and always has been. He feels like there had been a puzzle piece from the wrong picture jammed into his body, one that had been missing from Sam’s. And now Sam had finally taken it back, allowing the piece that was meant to be in Dean to at last be slotted into place.
“He’s my
Cas’s breath catches in his throat.
Whether they’re at the inn or not.
It had taken Dean a long time to believe him. It had taken him a long time to stop pathologically hiding his hurt, scared of being deemed useless and being thrown away.
Alastair.
Also I literally made myself tear up describing them falling asleep curled up like little curled up hibernating mice ;~; they're literally so sweet ;~; they just want a friend, just want the other one to like them!!!!
“Are you alright?” He asks quietly, and Dean looks away, embarrassed.
Only twice in his life has he belonged to himself, both times when he’d been traveling the long road, all alone.
How had he missed that last time he’d cleaned? Fucking useless.
Cas isn’t going to punish him.
“Huh?” he says brilliantly.
He strips off his shirt, and Cas peels away the blood soaked bandages until there’s nothing left but his raw back. The man cleans his wounds again, and even though it stings Cas’s hands feel so nice that he starts to space out, losing himself in a quiet haze of calm, relaxing until he’s lose and limp.
Grit like that goes far in a place like this.
In regards to your concerns: Yes, I have thought this through. I am aware of the steps and requirements necessary for manumission, and am prepared to fulfill them. My eating habits and social life are neither relevant nor your business. I appreciate your worry, but it is misplaced. Please send the documents as soon as possible.
“Uh, yeah. Trying to. M’ not very far in.”
Thanks to my beta Tanuki Tan :)
“You don’t need to.” Cas insists. “That’s not what your here for.”
He has no idea what’s showing on his face right now, but he can be sure that it isn’t pretty.
His other hand, which had until now still not moved from where Dean had pressed it against his chest, begins to trail downwards. Dean’s hand, on top of Cas’s, moves with it as it inches towards his naval, then his stomach, then lower.
Dean bites his lip, looking around the enormous store in terror.
“Ok. Ok, let’s bake them, then,” Dean replies, and Cas stands, extending a hand to help Dean up.
It’s the first time Cas has admitted he’s unhappy with his strange and isolated life.
“I think you’ll like the market,” Cas says. “People sell all kinds of dried fruits and candied nuts in huge barrels, and even different kinds of honeyed rinds and jams. Most stalls let you try a bit for free, in hopes that you’ll buy more.”
But no, that doesn’t make sense. Cas doesn’t have any other slaves to bring him his meals, and why would he bring them up when Dean was perfectly capable of getting them himself? He will probably be expected to get his meals himself, and go straight back up to his room afterwards. He wonders then if he is supposed to eat downstairs or come back to the room as soon as he’s gotten his food. Well, he’s about to find out.
“Then he stays.” The doctor says simply. “I’m guessing you wanna know what’s gonna happen next, huh?”
He tries to believe his father would understand this, that he wouldn’t think Cas didn’t love him. He tries to hold onto the memory of his father defending him, and not the many times he’d gotten angry at Cas for not being able to express himself, too.
He pulls off a large chunk of his own loaf as he says this, then rips that chunk further into two. He passes one of the sections over to Dean, and Dean takes it quietly.
The fire crackles, and a piece of bark breaks off the log and falls down to the ashes. Dean watches as a flurry of sparks fly up in its wake.
“I’d. I’d like to be your friend,” he stutters, feeling rash and bold. “If you’ll have me.”
One look over at the young man reveals that he very much wants to keep prying, but is trying very hard not to.
“Dean?” He hears, and his head snaps up.
Dean’s lips part in half shock, half arousal as the crippling fear he expects at the thought of his master walking in on him is yanked back by heat. He watches, flushing, as the length in his hand starts to grow.
Dean doubts the girl has been well treated like Kevin.
“On the
He thinks he hears Cas let out a slight sigh at this, but he could be wrong.
He doesn’t sound mad at all.
He sits up suddenly.
“I know,” Cas continues. “But you should have chosen
For @ao3gingerswag ’s “Wander Home”. This is Dean’s perspective during the first part of the story. He deserves to have spring awaken inside of him, does he not? Luckily Cas is there to help…
Sam shifts his head in a halfhearted attempt to look in Cas’s general direction, though his words are still directed more at the wall than him.
“You broke your table.” Dean says stupidly.
And it's Sammy time!!! He's such a little bastard he's so much fun to write!
From his spot on the ground, Dean stares up at the mattress until he sees the outline of a messy haired head peek over it.
It is pitiful, how much Sam’s understanding means to him. Pitiful, how he doesn’t think he would have been able to go on without it.
See ya soon,
Aghast, Sam looks up at him in horror.
“Yeah, I could see that,” Sam says sarcastically, from somewhere outside of the stall. “Possessive bastard, aren’t you?”
Dean takes a deep breath, steadying himself for what he’s about to do, before shaking his head.
“You don’t know. You don’t know what it feels like, to be empty. To be…gone, to, to, just be a
he wasn’t prepared to face, all for the abandoner’s sake.
“Is it…” the boy starts, voice rough and quiet. “Is it enough?”
Maybe he could do it. But maybe not.
who he’d been trying to protect Dean from.
Dean doesn’t know how to explain to the boy that he doesn’t want to do that, that the decisions Cas makes for him are so much better, so much kinder, than the ones he would make for himself.
And, as always, he avoids touching his hand to his dick like it’s going to burn him, careful his penis touches nothing but the washcloth as he runs it across the underside of the shaft.
“Then take more,” Cas says.
“Is that a good thing?”
“Here’s what I think happened,” Cas says, when Sam still hasn’t moved a muscle after a long painful minute has passed. “I think John threw Dean out, and the inn fell apart at the seams, because he’d been the only one looking after it. I think, when Dean came back, John was angry, and saw the fact that he hadn’t been there as a betrayal.”
He knows now though, wide awake in the middle of the night, hounded by the one dream he can’t ignore. Love is not something you can sleep through.
But they don’t go downstairs to the basement, where slaves are usually punished, but upstairs, heading first into what he presumes is Cas’s bedroom and then a large, clean bathroom that’s attached.
“Oh,” he breathes eventually, looking slightly disoriented. “I. Yes. Yes, of course, Sir, thank you.”
Cas looks at the wooden marker helplessly, begging with all his heart for his father to hear him, and see him, and accept him, despite his plethora of faults.
Dean can hardly believe it.
He says
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s not a triumph, like Sam seems to believe it is. It’s just the truth, and it’s ugly. It’s the truth he’s been grappling with for months and months.
“Dean?” he asks tentatively.
Cas had tried. He’d
Dean shakes his head.
Under his shirt, Dean curls his fingers tighter into Cas’s own.
She breaks his heart.
“What…what rule is that?”
The boy pushes aside the cut loafs, and picks up the last, which has not been sliced. He doesn’t bother with the knife, but takes the loaf between his two hands and rips into it, pushing his thumbs into the crust and pulling the pieces apart. The crust doesn’t indent beneath his fingers, but cracks like hardened wax, and Dean can hear it snap and crackle as his fingers push it inwards.
Cas doesn’t answer him, just sighs and sinks deeper into the couch cushions. It’s hard to tell in the dark, but Dean’s pretty sure he’s blushing.
“Oh, well,” he tells Dean as they ride past the stalls. “We’ll just have to get up earlier tomorrow to get everything done.”
“But it’s your food.”
He looks down at his hands. They are trembling very slightly, like there is something inside of them straining to get out.
The boy has been gone too long for someone who just went to fetch a blanket.
wasn’t enough. The comforts and stability he worked so hard to provide meant nothing, in the face of a memory. He’d been judged against Dean’s past and found lacking, despite all the horrors that past contained.
It’s different with Cas. He loves it when Cas touches him. His hands never feel painful, and they never wander down to grope him and make him feel dirty. When Cas touches him, it’s like he forgets that that’s ever been his life at all.
He’s just…kindhearted.
Before Dean had come back, there had been a list of rules taped to the fridge in his brother’s hesitant handwriting that Sam had found so disturbing that he had had to lock himself in the bathroom to cry. The morning after Dean comes back, the list is mysteriously gone. It’s clear that Dean is hoping it wasn’t noticed to begin with, so Sam plays along, and hopes in turn that it was taken down not only because of Dean’s shame but because it is no longer needed.
He gets that feeling a lot, with Sam.
?” He stands up straight then, spinning around to face the other man.
His words sound strong, no louder than anything else he’s said but somehow so much more unmovable.
Cas just tilts his head, squinting at him like he is a puzzle that he can’t quite figure out.
“Are you making fun of me,” he demands flatly.
He feels sure of it, suddenly, certain like he’s certain that it’s cold. He still doesn’t know what the ice house is, or why they’re here, but it’s not because he’s going to be locked in it. He knows it. He’s safe, right now.
Honestly I recently read a really good book and I got really discouraged thinking that I would never be able to write like that, but all I had to do was go back and read your guy's comments and I felt better lol.
Maybe that applies to him too. Even if he is strange.
He isn’t dead, so he’s probably being tortured.
to give.
This is what he was afraid of. This is what he was
“Yes, Sir.” He mutters. He looks down at the shoes, then up again. “The boots are warm, Sir.”
It’s a sad mimicry of providing comfort, at playing the adult role he doesn’t know how to fill. It would be more convincing if he could find it in him to raise his head, if he could stop petting his cow, if he hadn’t just had a breakdown and left a 10 year old child to deal with that.
Kevin smiles tentatively back anyway.
It was very clever of Gabe, really, and Dean has to hand it to him. He would be worried too, if his odd and blind brother had essentially barricaded himself on the top of a mountain to waste away. So he’d found the most messed up, terrified slave he could and thrown him at his younger sibling, knowing that in all Cas’s sweetness he’d never let something so fragile fall, even if that meant having to jump out of the stagnant state he’d been in.
Well. There’s nothing he can do about that.
Dean, you did nothing wrong.”
Shy and pleased and bashful, he puts down the bread and picks up the figs, eating them fist because he likes them best and Cas already knows that so Dean doesn’t have to hide it.
A shrug.
“I would never hit you!”
He straightens his back and looks forward, and Bobby presses around his torso firmly but clinically, barely skimming over the area where the pain is as to not cause any more. Dean keeps expecting him to start groping him or at least pinch or play with his nipples, because even if he does intend to heal Dean, there’s no harm in having a little fun. It never happens though, and after a few minutes the man pulls away, leaving Dean un-fondled.
“I think you helped me yesterday because you know who I am. I think Dean told you about me, and you wanted me to help you get him back. I think when I broke down crying, it scared you, and you panicked, and you took the deed thinking that maybe you can just get Dean back yourself.”
“I didn’t ask about Cas,” he says. “I asked about you.”
Sam doesn’t reply.
Dull despair washes over him like exhaustion.
hidden in the kitchen. Both. Neither. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.)
But Dean hadn’t understood that. He hadn’t understood, and instead of being given closure, Sam had been left with the feeling that something had just reached down his throat and ripped his gut out of his body.
The thought sends such a pang of misery through him that he straightens up, irritated with himself.
But the man’s hands don’t loosen, in fact pulling so painfully Dean feels like it’s ripping his scalp off. The message is clear.
Since then, Cas has noticed, Bobby has been coming by more often. Once a week, sometimes twice, now. Cas can’t think of a reason for the increased frequency, except that maybe, despite his words, he hadn’t actually liked Cas’s father. Whatever his reason is for showing up more often, he doesn’t do anything besides what he’s always done, which is lurk in the corner quietly.
Sometimes he even moves closer. Like there is comfort to be found in Cas’s presence.
And he sighs then, and shakes his head like he is trying to center himself.
Alastair follows.
he types into the search.
Alastair can’t see it anyway. The man is blind, when it comes to matters of love and empathy and caring about other people. He has no idea that Cas would never,
Standing up, his eyes widen as they land on the alarm clock sitting on the bedside table.
Cas supposes that is a fair response.
The doctor steps away again, and Dean takes this as an indication that he’s done. Moving his hands away from his limp dick, he pulls his legs together and hunches over, hugging himself.
But the world snuffs gentleness out, Cas has learned. One way or another.
Pursing his lips, he nods. “I’ll be good.” He says, eyes still trained on Cas. They jump back to the metal thing, though, as it approaches his heart, and Dean tenses.
It has just saved his life, because he’d seen the blow coming, and so is prepared to knock it aside.
He doesn’t know how to stop being shocked by unkindness without giving in to the apathy of others. He doesn’t know how to grow thicker skin without losing the ability to feel.
It doesn’t seem to want to. It doesn’t seem afraid of Cas at all.
though.
Dean’s slightly parted lips open centimeters wider, and the tip of Cas’s thumb slips in.
Dean looks down at the cloth covered parcel. He clutches it tight in his hands. It’s heavy, laden with good things that Cas had packed for him. For
And now, and now, with Dean’s name falling from the boy’s lips…
“You used to love that book,” a voice says behind him, and Dean jumps violently.
“Dean, I.” Sam starts eventually. “I’m sorry.”
His fingers flex and strain with repressed energy under the muscles of his upper arms.
“What if they can tell what, Dean?”
Dean, when not being counseled or tutored, spends the time doing grunt work, helping Jess and the others cook and clean and package and un-package, washing dishes and sorting mail for hours on end. He likes the work. Real work has always made him happy.
He is overtaken all of a sudden with the strangest sensation of Deja Vu.
He doesn’t believe her. Maybe in another month he will. For now, he can be grateful for the words all the same, but still deflects instead of answering.
He would have gotten away.
“I can’t…I can’t free you. It’s not that I don’t want to.” He rushes to say. “It’s that it’s technically not my call. It was Gabe who bought you, so he’s the one who holds your papers. I’ve spoken to him about it, but for now at least he’s refusing.”
“That’s alright.” The therapist assures him. “But I want you to know that this isn’t some sort of test. You’re not being evaluated or judged right now. We’re just talking.”
He pulls the crumpled Xanax prescription he’d received from his pocket as proof.
“Done. With the top half, at least.” Bobby says in front of him, and Dean snaps back to attention.
And that night, that had been the end of that.
he thinks, and they are. Most of the food at John’s inn just turned into some shade of grey. The food here is colorful, though. Nice to look at as well as just eat.
To her credit, that’s all he sees of her feelings, and she immediately continues speaking like that was a perfectly reasonable question, like he hadn’t just revealed the depth of his stupidity.
Cas feels his face turn hot as flames as he struggles not to react. He doesn’t want to scare Dean off, and doesn’t want to draw attention to their interlocked fingers, like it is something that will disappear if it is acknowledged.
And it won’t. Fucking. Disappear.
isn’t he? He can work, he can make money. He’ll do anything Cas wants him to, if he’ll just touch him like that again, if he’ll look at him with a fraction of the care with which he looks at the cow.
The understanding of what he’s been through starts to hit him.
Dean thinks, but doesn’t say.
Dean continues to stare.
“I am.”
This is his future, without Cas. Blowing guys for cash as he inches towards Canada, then doing the same there too. It’s not like he’s good at anything else.
“He went back for Sam, Luna, I know he did,” he tells the cow that morning, eyes red and swollen, tears still tumbling down his cheeks. “I couldn’t break his devotion. Oh,
“It doesn’t matter, Mr. Cas.” Dean says miserably. “Just a fucking whore. Deserved it.”
Dean stares at the ground, feeling hollow.
Dean, of course, knows this from personal experience but says nothing, suddenly unsure. Maybe Cas isn’t planning on using him right away. It seems like this might be the case from what he’s saying, but being allowed time to heal has not been a luxury he’s ever been granted in the past. He doesn’t know what else Cas could mean though.
In a way, Cas is relieved, that it’s this “Sam” that Dean misses, and not John himself.
It doesn’t work, if the icy glare the boy sends him when he tries to step forward is any indication.
Damn he misses that book. It had essentially been a comfort item for him, had been something he could look at to calm himself down. He had felt stupid for wanting it when he was fifteen and feels even stupider for wanting it now.
Sam couldn’t blame him, after everything. Not with the hell coming for him in the morning.
He waits at least until his shaking subsides, then slips as quietly as possible from under the bed.
That Dean and Cas love each other complicates matters. It complicates Sam’s resolution to stay quiet on what Dean wants him to stay quiet on. He knows he gets no say in how Dean lives his life and the choices he makes. He knows he screwed up any right to have his opinion heard years ago. But this is hard to sit through.
Dean trails off, unsure if he’s overstepping. He’s presuming a lot, volunteering his companionship as if it has any value, and assuming Cas would need his consent to begin with.
Dean’s pretty sure he’s never been allowed to sleep so long in his life, and he starts to panic, wondering of he was supposed to wake himself up. Some masters had expected him to do chores or come pleasure them in the morning, and they were never happy if they had to come find him. Other masters though hadn’t allowed him to move from where they left him, not liking it when their sex toy took initiative.
The words sound stiff, rehearsed. The fears of a man turned into a prayer. Cotton to stuff into the hole of never finding out.
“I haven’t been feeding you enough.” He mutters. “You need to be eating real food, not cereal and canned soup.”
The boy gasps like he has dropped a baby on its head. His hands fly up to cover his mouth, and he looks at Cas like he thinks Cas is going to eat him. His face is white, and his eyes are huge.
“Your back is clearly a mess.” Cas says bluntly. “And you said your. Ah. Your a-anal region is bleeding.” His master clears his throat, blushing. “Beyond that.” He continues. “You likely have a broken rib and possibly two broken fingers.”
shocked. For the first time, his eyes display a hint of fear.
“What are you talking about? Get what clean?”
Dean can’t go through the world like this. He can’t go through the world not knowing what coins are worth, having only a warped idea of their value in terms of sexual labor, having no understanding of how to get what he needs other than by offering his body.
A sharp stab of self hatred has him scrambling to get away with renewed energy, as the repulsive image of everything he doesn’t want to be tightens its grip on his hair.
“I’m looking for an inn. It’s run by a man named John. Do you know it?”
He’d sobbed from relief, when they’d been reunited, had flung his arms around Cas without hesitation, then. And on the journey home, he’d been so happy to see Luna, he’d insisted Cas help him stand so he could feed her, even with how injured he was. Cas had held him up, then, and Dean had smiled and laughed, as the cow licked his face and ate apples from his hands.
“I folded the laundry, Sir.” He speaks much quieter this time, tense like a bowstring.
Dean nods slowly as if he understands, before shaking his head suddenly.
God, I'm sorry guys I really didn't mean to leave you guys on a cliffhanger again. I wanted Dean and Sam to meet in this chapter, but it needed its own chapter, and I was trying to bang it out so that I could post both chapters at once but I've re written it so many times because I want to get it right and it just wasn't gonna happen without another extremely long wait. Thanks for hanging in there and sticking with the story so far, I promise the moment you've all been waiting for is coming up ;)
“I believe I have an extra toothbrush somewhere.” Cas says as he rifles around the shelves. “It may take me a moment to find it. I don’t often have guests.”
This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous and fucking insane.
down.
“Can I get in?” Dean says. He still hasn’t taken his eyes off the water.
So sue him. He wants to do this right. It’s been a long time since he’s been expected to be anything but a sex toy, and last time he’d tried…
*******
And he feels stupid, for wanting to sob over a coat, and feels stupid, for wanting to sob becuse Dean isn’t in front of him wearing it.
over him, certainly. None of them even hold a candle to Cas, but he’s had masters who were nicer than others. But in all his experience, in the rare case that anyone took pity on him, it’s still always been understood that any kindness he receives is more than he deserves. He is to be grateful, however his masters see it fit to treat him. He doesn’t get to be angry or bitter or resentful. They
It was good thinking, and not something Cas would have thought Dean would have had the presence of mind or will to do on his own without being told, as timid as he is.
Before Cas can blink, Sam has ripped the parchment back out of his hands and has spread it out in his own lap.
Sam spits it out.
Grief.
“Ok.” Cas soothes, clearly not keeping up with what’s going on inside Dean’s mind. “We don’t have to, Dean. It’s up to you.”
Cas doesn’t say anything for a long time. He bites his lip.
Five seconds ago he hadn’t been sure if Ellen was going to rent them a room at all.
He doesn’t expect to see open bewilderment, so startled and true that Cas doesn’t question his own perception for even a moment.
Sam did not have a twelfth of the strength that John did, and so he had stood straining, sobbing in rage, book bending in his hands but coming nowhere near to tearing.
Or, it would be a scream, if there was anything left of the boy’s voice, but it seems that Alastair has left that as ravaged as the rest of him, and what comes out is a thready and excruciating sounding rasp of a cry.
Ellen’s eyes drift over to Dean. He sees confusion pass over her face as she takes the other boy in.
As always you can come give me prompts/talk to me at https://ao3gingerswag.tumblr.com/
His head hurts.
It’s only as Cas finishes that things go wrong.
“Like I give a shit,” he mutters sullenly, as talking more to the coals than to Cas.
Dean feels all of a sudden like he’s done something terrible.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas says.
He’d thought they were one and the same, and doesn’t know what to think when confronted by evidence that they aren’t.
“So you think he will?”
“I’m sorry.” He begs. “I’ll be quiet, I promise.”
“You’ve taken such good care of me.” He says. “I’m fed and I’m warm and I’m not in pain ever, and I appreciate that so much. But I don’t want to be a doll anymore. Not even a cherished one.”
Dean squirms awkwardly under his judgement.
Bobby’s eyebrows jump up in approval. “Good idea.” He says.
Later, he would realize he’d already known.
The anger and indignation he feels then comes from somewhere very deep inside him, rupturing out of his already cracked heart and widening the fissures. The whole muscle throbs with pain, lacing his hot rage with something achingly sad.
“That girl”- he wheezes, chest heaving, “That girl isn’t going to be the only person who can’t afford- afford
, he was right to keep him hidden away.
He doesn’t want Dean to think that whores don’t deserve friends, because they do, and because Dean is going to keep thinking of himself as a whore for a while whether Cas agrees with him or not.
“You should sleep, if you’re tired,” Cas suggests, but Sam shakes his head firmly, though his drooping eyelids don’t perk up from their slouch.
But. Cas hasn’t broken it yet.
In any case, the boy’s attention already seems to be drifting away from Cas now that he’s decided he’s not a threat. He’s twisted his body halfway around again, and is craning his head to look down the well.
“I think I have to leave too.”
he is used to thinking, as aggressive men grumble and huff,
“You don’t think I’m a slut?”

“Dean,” Cas says, rasping, the tinge of a plea, and lays a cautious hand at the crown of Dean’s head, fingers threading through Dean’s hair, grounding and good. Dean’s lips part, a long, shaky inhale of breath and he thrills to smell something dark and sharp and male, stronger by the second. Blinding anticipation builds in Dean’s chest as the heady scent of arousal overwhelms his senses: skin, and salt, and damp and—
Cas lets Dean’s cock slip from his mouth and briefly presses his face to the soft and smooth skin where hip meets groin. He pecks a kiss to the cut of hipbone he finds there, looks up to pin Dean with exasperated eyes which belie the pleased smile playing at his lips. “Yes, Dean. I’m very alright.” His gaze goes questioning. “Are you?”
interesting.

Castiel runs a critical eye over the room: the couch and chairs pushed to the walls or into the hallway, the additional wardings, the single table now in the center of his cleared living room space. The summoning bowl which rests upon it.

Castiel hides his smile behind his glass, concedes a nod. He takes another sip, says, quiet, “Thank you.”
“Fuck me,” Dean says, having spent too many lonely nights imagining it, needing it too much to remember to be embarrassed. “Cas, want you to fuck me.”
“Let’s see if I can’t top it,” Dean says. “What’ll it be?”

Are you doing it?
Dean hears the soft, cottony squeak of socks on the hardwood and a hand slides to rest at the small of his back. He feels the nuzzling press of a nose to his jaw, the warmth of breath. “He missed you.”
“Later,” Cas hums. “For now, all is well.” His eyes squint open in a half-hearted glare. “Dean, you’re ruining my afterglow.”

This, like many of the brief and ill-advised visits of the recent past, was entirely Balthazar's idea.
“Echo 4’s last known location is precisely 80 miles southeast of here,” Castiel says to Dean’s back. “We are by far in the best position to provide aid and get our men clear of the enemy forces.” Dean’s shoulders tense, but he remains silent. Castiel makes his way to the door of his chambers, cracking it open. “I’m putting together a unit,” he says shortly. “We leave at 16:00. Take the time you need.”
Castiel is unsure if he feels more grateful or insulted. Unfortunately, with Dean, this is not an uncommon occurrence.
“You do not have to bear your burdens alone.”

The Trickster regards Castiel for a long, silent moment, expression completely unreadable for the first time Castiel’s seen. He lifts a hand, index and middle fingers outstretched.
Fleeing wins, and Dean quickly and efficiently brews the macchiato, exactly right, no matter how hyper-aware he feels of the weight of a certain blue-eyed stare at his back. He pulls a sleeve and a sharpie, and then.

Dean chokes on a humorless laugh. “Figure out what, exactly?” Sam says nothing, and Dean stands to restlessly pace the short spaces between the beds. “If we believe Ruby, this Lilith chick is coming for you,

Sonny leaves, back to the front, and Dean dives right in. It can’t be more than thirty minutes later that he sets down the last of the clean plates, satisfied with a job well done despite the grossness of sweat from the heat of the grill, the soapy wetness that’s soaked straight up to the cuffs of his t-shirt, his jacket stripped and tied securely under the apron at his waist.
“No. No, you…”
02:06 PM  04/22/07
. No way, Cas,” Dean says, firm and sure. “You don’t feel bad for wanting things, you hear me? That’s not you, not anymore.”
Sam sucks in a breath, short and sharp with surprise.

“Then why did you—”

Uh, no, I think the word you’re looking for is ‘gross.’

Both Sam and Dean rubberneck up to the jumbotron, where there they are, Dean and his brother cozily leaned into each other and framed by an obnoxious, sparkling pink kiss cam heart.
” Krissy then hisses, quickly rallying in the way only teenagers can. “Every day it’s ‘coffee, please,’” she mocks, low and gruff. “You know, I’m pretty sure that’s the only thing I’ve ever heard him say?”
“Is everything alright?”
“Hello!” someone, a woman, chirps as soon as he’s clear of the door. “Welcome to Relish!”
Today’s a better day, Cas.

“Yeah, I think so,” Sam goes back to clicking around on the laptop. “I mean, there’s a lot of activity here. Leaving messages, moving things, showing up in and around the house, the whole nine yards. It’s almost sad,” he pauses, frowns. “She’s really obviously
“‘M gonna hurt you. I will.”
Cas pulls both arms slightly away from his sides, palms out and shoulders stiff; a gesture Dean knows to be Cas’s own special, socially retarded version of a shrug. “As an angel, I’m…incapable of sexual desire.” Cas casually tugs off his trench as he speaks, ignoring Dean’s weak
Dean stares and stares at the message he wants, doesn’t want, needs to send. The same message he’d typed out in the initial crippling wave of grief and guilt a full week before. His thumb hovers lightly over the bright green ‘send.’

Aw, hell, don’t be so…
Sam twists in his seat to face Dean, all curious eyes and poorly-concealed smirk, “Yeah, Dean,” he says, signing as he speaks. “What was that?”
Castiel continues to look at Dean expectantly.

Dean is slow in his approach, but even so is practically at the man’s elbow before he notices Dean in his periphery, startled eyes torn from the formica to lock squarely with Dean’s.
Castiel, who had marginally relaxed upon registering the intruder’s identity, again tenses at the other’s demand. He guardedly steps around the desk, one hand out in a placating gesture. “Dean,” he cautions.

The pretty one in the leather jacket (in July? What the hell?) had had his phone out and looked to be texting, leaving the cute one with the floppy hair to ask for a table for two, please. And if Jamie just so happened to seat them at the one window booth close and catty-corner to the hostess stand, granting her a mostly unobscured view of their table…
Dean’s smile falters at the odd response, and he's immediately made to regret it as the man’s own expression falls; eyes cast down and to the side as he quickly withdraws from Dean’s grip. Dean hovers as the man nervously fumbles for his napkin and silverware, desperately wanting to salvage the situation but unsure how.
“Tell me something,” Sonny says, making no move to retrieve the apron. “What time does school let out?” His mustache tilts and flattens over the beginnings of a knowing smirk. “Not on a half day.”
With a mounting annoyance which, typically, looks to be manifesting itself into a truly spectacular headache, Dean resigns himself to an offensively long wait and steers his buggy to the checkout closest to the supercenter’s exit. He knows full well that trolling the aisles for shorter lines would likely be more trouble than it’s worth.
“Awesome,” Dean breathes.

“Dean,” Cas repeats on a growl, taking full advantage of Dean’s momentary distraction to sneak a hand around to palm at Dean’s ass, canting his hips up as much as he’s able with his legs still effectively pinned and getting a whole lot of nowhere. “You interrupted me.”
All-in-all it’s a charred, lopsided, soggy mess. But as Dean’s cackling calms to unattractive snorting and breathless giggles, Castiel feels a smile of his own steal across his face, one which he can’t seem to wipe away, and he can always, always be thankful for that.
Castiel only fixes her with a stern mock-glare before collecting his purchases and moving along from the stall. Gail watches as he wanders away, not bothering to suppress her smile as she sees him pause to snap a picture of a crate of purple asparagus. Castiel squints endearingly at the screen as he then, presumably, sends it to his

They stop before a long, crowded line of boxy white machines. A number of them rattle and clunk in a collective racket, though the ones they stand in front of are quiet and still. Atop one sits a single basket, borrowed from the establishment and piled high with various clothes and cleaning rags. To Castiel’s keen senses the basket emits a smell all too recently familiar: sweat and blood, dirt and oil and well-use.
Dean twists to lean against the car door, pulling up a leg to lay across the seat. The moment stretches, silent and tense.
07:47 PM  05/30/07
Castiel stays silent, patiently awaiting Crowley’s true response. He knows as well as Castiel that this would be a pointless endeavor if Castiel didn’t, in fact, have this chip he proposes to bargain with.

04:30 PM  11/16/07
“Hey, whoa!” Dean exclaims, throwing up both hands, palms out, “I didn’t ask for a show and tell!”
Well, ain’t that a shame.
“Our guy just stole second,” Dean enthuses. “Bottom of the fourth and we’re three runs down. Two outs, full count, we need every inch we can get, right? And now we’ve got runners on two and three, we’ve got ourselves a verifiable run on anything. Fuckin’ wild, man.”
``````
“Yes,” Castiel says. He pauses, wondering where exactly he is being unclear. “…way.”
Dean stops those particular thoughts right in their tracks, not giving them the chance to spiral, but can’t help the “Cas—” that breaks free, stripped far too bare to fit the moment. He lifts a hand to find Cas’s face; one finger trailing the line of his jaw, the whorl of his ear. “Tell me what you look like.”
“No, you don’t! I may spend my time wading through the world’s shit, but I don’t make a habit of dragging my friends in after me!”
The last couple months of what Dean had fully, unequivocally believed to be his

That day I first texted you, busted arm? Got thrown around by some ghosts killing people on a movie set in LA.

He holds Cas’s face flush to his hips, doesn’t allow him an inch, and Cas simply swallows around him, humming slow, dark little noises with every constriction of his throat and yeah, no way is Dean coming out of this alive. Dean lasts for less than a minute before he jerks back, too quick and he slips out completely but it was that or come
Sam’s brows, which had been steadily creeping higher, collapse as his eyes narrow in sudden suspicion. “Dean…” Fuck. “Where’s Cas?”
You’re gonna be fine, okay? And I’m gonna be fine. But this is what’s best.
“The coffee was excellent,” the man compliments, which Dean accepts as his due, because of course it was. “My sister and I were glad to discover you,” he continues, a hint of slyness re-entering his expression.
``````
Cas leans in further still, brushes his nose and lips along Dean’s jaw and up to his ear to command, “Say it again.”
07:11 AM  04/29/07
Military AU!
Who, me?
Castiel allows himself a smirk. “Now do I have your attention?”
“Oh, yeah, loads,” the Trickster says, flippant. “But, funny thing: that last time, the time little Sammy thought was for good? He hunted me for months, and ‘Cas’ didn’t even get a courtesy call. Never looked back,” he again shrugs. “I lost interest.”
The man eyes Dean, speculative. “With a kick,” he says, low, and Dean feels his entire face burn in a sudden flush. Man, this guy just doesn’t quit.
“Oh, my god,” Dean says. “
A slight, brunette stranger pokes her head out around one of the tall dividers of the common workspace. “Hi,” she says, chipper tone belied by wary eyes, “can I help you?”
Dean senses movement in his periphery and shuffles forward with the rest of the queue. He glances up and his mood brightens considerably as he catches sight of the wall of checkout candy bait.
Dean unlocks the door and steps into the apartment. His keys clink sharply to the glass change tray on the entryway table and he rests his cane, propped between the table and the wall. It’s not until he’s halfway through pulling off his shoes that he hears the distinctive

Dean watches as Castiel’s hands haltingly slide up from his legs, never breaking contact. His left splays out and presses firm against his belly in an unconscious bid to relieve the pressure building a few inches below; the right travels up until his thumb skims over a nipple. His breath catches gorgeously, same as before.

Dean turns to see an intensely gorgeous man hovering in the aisle. Tousled black hair, two-day stubble, tall and lean in a light blue button down and dark-wash jeans. Jesus Christ, does Sam work for a law firm or a modeling agency?
09:16 PM 01/02/08
Fuck, I don’t know! Just, no big deal, okay?
“I’m here. I’m here, Dean. Come for me. Let me hear you, I want to—”
Castiel looks up to the all-powerful being stood before him. “Are you here to kill me?”

fucking good. Either Jack’s a god or a meal rightfully earned tastes that much sweeter, and Dean somehow doubts it’s the former. Dean sits up at the counter to eat, tentatively trading small talk with Sonny between bites. He clams up a bit when, a few minutes in, Sonny’s expression starts to turn a shade too understanding for comfort, and Dean instead retreats into his french fries, makes a conscious effort to slow down.
Five minutes later finds him out and three blocks away, no direction in mind other than
“N-Nothin’ to talk about, man.”
He buries his nose into Castiel’s hair, presses his words into the skin behind his ear. “It’s gonna be so good, Cas. You’ll see.”
“…Ah,” Castiel replies, obviously catching exactly none of what Dean just pitched him.
Dean rolls his eyes and tucks away the phone. Of course he is, the freakin’ hippy.
He died that day. He never expected to be

Gabriel meets his gaze, and Castiel wants to scream to see the mournful resignation in his eyes, the taut line of his body, angled carefully away. “We left the war, Castiel. Smart thing to do is not look back.”

Castiel’s fists unclench in painstaking increments. He takes a slow, fortifying breath. “My name is Castiel Ja—”
Really.

Are you serious right now?”

” Dean socks Sam in the back of the shoulder, feeling a building glee as he sees the third base line draw ever-closer. “Do we have fuckin’ dugout seats?”
``````
Dean turns to walk the few blocks over to Bally’s, hunched deep into his jacket in an attempt to ward off the November chill. He’s got enough of his own money to spend a few hours outplaying the tourists and drunks at poker; rake in enough that Sam will buy into thinking he sunk most of Bela’s money in the slots or something equally casino cliché.
Castiel keeps his silence. It is a matter of hours before the rise of the sea will completely overtake this village; the water come to wash away the fear, the sickness and the rot. The land thus Cleansed.
And, fuck.
“This, all of this, is…unimaginable.”

The signal chirps as it turns and Dean steps forward to cross, the click-clack of the woman’s heels pulling ahead at a speed that makes Dean snort in mild amusement. He hits the opposite sidewalk just as the countdown begins to beep its way down to the turn to stop – and say what you will about Palo Alto, but there’s no denying their APS game is seriously on-point.
Notice what?

so throaty it hurts. “Get ‘em wet.”
Dean turns and continues down the hall, cautiously opening doors as he goes. A young boy and a man in a cap and flannel tossing a ball back and forth in an open field. A wide, white farmhouse porch, acoustic guitar waiting propped against the railing and porch swing swaying slightly in the breeze. A sun-warm pier that stretches out over a picturesque lake. Dreams, all of them, compartmentalized and on display like some fucked-up funhouse of memories and wishes.
06:10 PM  06/02/07
“Bingo!” The man twirls his wrist in a slight flourish, smirking at Castiel’s flinch. “Got it in one.”
He likes to think blue looks like ice chips taste; clear and sharp as they melt to soothing, liquid relief on the back of his tongue.
that’s sure to follow.
09:17 PM  03/23/07
Sonny draws up, standing straight and arms crossed loosely at his chest, something settling behind the dark light of his eyes. “Well, it’s up to you, but,” he ticks his head towards the back, to the polished silver swinging door leading to the kitchen, “I’ve got a sink full of dirty dishes and a burger with your name on it if they come out clean.” He shrugs, indifferent. “If you want to.”
Castiel seems surprised at that, as if he hadn’t thought it out that far. Looking mildly confused, he frowns down at his chest and arms:
“Goddamn,” Dean sighs and drops his head to the steering wheel, eyes closed and ready for sleep. Sam huffs in agreement and unfolds from beside him, exiting the car to move from the front and slide into the back, stretching out as much as his long legs allow.
09:25 AM  04/10/07
Anael draws a slow, unnecessary breath, and Castiel senses her mind settle. Feels her resolve.
That’d just be the icing on the great big fucked-up cake, wouldn’t it?
Dean shoots his waitress a warning look. “Hey. Watch it,” he says, and Krissy has the good grace to look mildly chastised.
02:05 PM  03/29/07
Do you have any ink?
“Yes, I do. And we’ll never speak of it again, if that’s what you want, but I needed to say the words. I’m glad I did.”

You’re pretty sassy, you know that?
Maybe someday, when Sam and Eileen start popping out kids, or for the taxes, or when Cas finally tells Dean what that secret savings account they both pretend he doesn’t know about is really for. But, for now, “Kid was more disappointed he didn’t have a dog to pet than he was excited to tell me the good stuff,” Dean says. “Thought he was gonna drag me straight back home just to get ‘im, swear to god.”
Dean continues to rock into Cas’s mouth, deeper and deeper with each pass until he can very definitely feel himself hitting the back of Cas’s throat, fluttering and tight and so fucking good. He knows he’s pushing past what most people would be able to give, knows it’s too much too soon but Cas takes it all the same.

Seriously, what the HELL is happening here?!

The hand is restless, fingers tugging and scratching through the dark wiry hair he’s found there, hips hitching in off-beat, unsatisfying pushes.
Same thing that always happens.
Cas, is the best, easiest, most rock-fucking-solid thing Dean’s ever had. Always has been, right from day one. And it’s a hell of a thing to know Cas feels the same, and to know with everything you are what ‘forever’ really means, legally binding documents or no.
01:09 PM  03/19/07
Dean’s grin returns full-force. “You like ‘em sweet, huh?”
Dean, predictably, ignores him entirely and continues to flip through the channels on the motel TV, never staying on one for more than three seconds before moving to the next. The volume is obnoxiously loud, and this has been going on for long enough that even Sam – who’s been

For the love of pie and Norris and everything holy.
The guy squares up to Dean front-and-center, and Dean’s halfway to an apology when he catches Dean’s eye and holds, not looking angry so much as calculating. He reaches out and calmly retrieves the mocha from Dean’s hold, still hovering awkwardly over the counter between them.
04:25 PM  11/16/07
“It’s…fine,” Dean says awkwardly. “Hi, by the way.” He reaches a hand across the counter. “I’m Dean.”

Castiel swallows against the anger and urgency that have been building in him with every hour passed. “I know,” he says.
“Yes,” Castiel repeats a third time. “There were many angels stationed on Earth in the years leading up to the birth of the Son. The

Sam smirks, entirely too self-satisfied. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”

But seriously, it’s fine. Just probably something we shouldn’t talk about.
Castiel nods, curious enough on the promised ‘phase two’ to overlook the slight irritant of Dean’s playful condescension. He’s unsure what, exactly, is putting Dean in such a mood, but Castiel is…pleased, he believes, for the reprieve. The past few months have weighed heavy on them all.

“Should hop over to the West, shouldn’t they? The Dahšūr have certainly done better,” Balthazar says lightly. “They could stand to learn a thing or two from…” she waves a hand through the air, as if to pluck the words from the spaces between this dimension and the next. “Oh, what was his name…”

Incoming call
Cas catches on quick. He continues to swipe the pad of his thumb over his nipple, slow and exploratory, and Dean can oh-so-easily imagine the feel of it, that sweet little nub hardening under his own fingers. Cas changes it up, lets the rough edge of his nail catch on a sharp flick and a dark, punched-out growl catches in his throat as his hips jerk up into nothing and Dean is gone, gone, gone.

They see the news, and not five minutes later Ruby shows up to basically rip them a new one. Dean doesn’t want to hear it, leaves Sam to herd Ruby outside in favor of sitting on his shitty motel bed, with its shitty cowboy patterned comforter, head-in-hands, punishing himself further with the continued murmur of the local coverage of the morning’s events.
But he’s not...grateful. Or, if he is, he doesn’t show it. Doesn’t feel it. Not in the way that Dean does.
Alastair’s fist, reeled back for another punch, seems to hesitate. Confusion flickers over his face for the first time, as he starts to process Cas’s words.
The steel in Cas’s expression melts away all of a sudden and is replaced with concern.
The blade hangs loosely in his right hand, but his left clutches at the edge of the well tight enough that his knuckles are white.
Something catches it though, as it comes up his throat, yanking it back down into his stomach, and oddly enough that thing is not fear. He knows fear well enough to be sure of that, but is too unfamiliar with any other emotion to identify it.

“Course I know him,” he grumbles, glaring. “Know him a lot better than

Dean’s brain short circuits, the serial-killer like situation and the well-understood expression on the man’s face acting like some sort of override inside him. For a moment, Dean feels nothing but pure fear.
And he’d known the boy would see him from a mile away, had known he would have a chance to run off, and would consider it.
Dean jerks in fear. Immediately he curls into a ball, with his knees to the floor and his head to his knees, arms coming up to protect his head. He waits for the pain, but it never comes.
So he takes only a few small items, to represent his whole life.
Astounding, and disgusting in it’s truth.
He starts his morning chores quietly, subdued and distracted, frightened of waking Dean because he’s even more frightened of speaking to him.
Dean shakes his head a bit. “I deserved it.” He mumbles into his jeans.

This isn’t Cas he’s dealing with here. He can’t afford to feel safe.
And instead of avoiding everyone again he had pretended to be a better and kinder and happier person than he really is, and had tricked some idealistic classmates into being his friends. And he had gone on pretending, and observing, and not mentioning any of it, and it was all unfeeling and fine until Jess found a gun under his pillow.
But if Bobby is taken aback by his abruptness, he doesn’t show it.
Sam looks surprised, like he hadn’t actually expected to get through to Dean.
The world he’d described had been something out of a fantasy, with a hero who’d walked out of a daydream. Sam hadn’t believed a word of it, though it was clear Dean had thought he was speaking truth.
Dean stiffens. He wishes Cas hadn’t unwound his arm so he’d have an excuse to cling on to the man.
All Dean had ever wanted was to be left alone. All Sam had ever wanted was the same.
The environment is comfortable and friendly, and Cas feels utterly and completely disconnected from it.
Cas’s head moves up, startled.
The boy leans in, clearly eager to share whatever scene he’d just witnessed.
You're right that Dean has helped me, so so much, because he gave me the strength to test my own abilities in a way you or our family never allowed me to, and I found out for the first time that I am capable of more than you ever let me believe.
had left the inn to begin with to for the sake of an abandoner too, had willingly returned to his
“Need any help?” Cas calls from his cart, but the boy doesn’t hear him, or at least doesn’t seem to realize he’s being spoken to. So Cas jumps down from his cart, and gives Luna a pat, telling her to stay put for the time being.
Bobby’s brow furrows, and he straightens up, pulling the stethoscope out of his ears.
“Well, yes.” Cas says kindly. “This is your room now. I won’t come in without your permission regardless of whether you lock the door-that’s why I’ve been over here this whole time- but there is a lock, and I did want you to know about it.”
“Sir?” His master finally says. It takes Dean a moment to realize the word is not directed at him, though the man’s eyes still rest nearer to him than to his brother.
“Mr. Cas?” He says shakily. He sounds as disoriented as he feels, and the other man obviously picks up on that, frowning and sitting up straight. Dean jerks his hips back nervously, scared of his master feeling his arousal.
But the crowd has moved backwards, and are looking away as if they cannot see what is happening.
I had a sudden flash of inspiration when replying to a message on tumblr. This is about Sam in the oneshot Alone <3 Inspired by https://flyartproductions.tumblr.com/
Luna tilts her head at him, as if to express her doubt.
For all his effort, it still takes him at least twice as long as it takes Cas to wipe anything clean, muscles weak from malnutrition and neglect.
It feels like walking against the wind, walking against the tide, each step as hard as a diamond.
“Let go of her!” Cas shouts, and he grabs at Alastair’s wrist, intending to pry his arm off her.
Cas yelps, jerking backwards, and Dean is quickly pushed away. It makes Cas drop his hands though, so Dean doesn’t count it as a total loss. Undeterred, Dean shuffles back immediately, planting his hands on the ground and kissing the man’s length through the cloth.
Possibly himself included.
This part, though, Dean doesn’t say out loud.
were supposed to warn me I was walking into danger for no reason! And for the record,
Dean stares down at the carpet, picking fluff out of it before trying to poke it back in.
But something had happened. He’d messed it up, somehow, mere hours after being entrusted with Dean’s secret. He’d scared the boy, somehow, or in some way dashed his happiness, or just failed to stop whoever or whatever had. The boy had gotten quieter and quieter as they rode away from town, withdrawing into himself like the tide pulling itself back out to the sea.
So he does.
This is his first impression, as soon as he steps through the door, and he has to wonder if it is intentional. He wouldn’t put it past the man, to drape himself in artificial glory.
But you can feel seeds sleeping under the snow.
At first, Cas had thought his mood shift to be a result of his nightmare, had thought his disposition would lighten again in a couple of days.

“He could.” Dean mutters, knowing full well Benny is right.
Dean looks back over at Sam, blinking. He has a look concentration on his face, like he’s thinking. Otherwise, he seems completely unfazed by what Dean just told him, and Dean doesn’t know what to think about that.
Next, explain what you’re doing. It’s never fun to not know whats going to happen to your own body, Dean knows that from personal experience. And Cas is blind, Dean reminds himself, so he has to be extra careful to tell him what’s going on. He can’t see it himself.

“Seriously,” Sonny echos. He keeps a straight face, but the start of a smile in his eyes gives him away. “Come on,” he beckons, leading Dean to the far side of the counter, opening up to the back. Dean cautiously follows. “Believe me, you’d be doing me a favor.” Sonny elbows open the door to reveal the kitchen space, a wide flat-top grill set over a pair of ovens on the left and a deep double sink at the far wall, a large steel island set right at the room’s center. Small, but comfortable enough. There’s a second man, someone Dean hasn’t seen, stood at the grill and frying up what looks like the makings of a philly cheesesteak. “Clean up for food? That’s labor so cheap it’s probably against the rules.” Their entrance earns them a look from grill dude and not much else, turning right back to cooking following a perfunctory glance. “That’s Jack,” says Sonny lightly, then, “What’s your name, kid?”

“Oh, yeah,” Dean says thoughtfully, pulling from his pocket the item in question. “Smart.”
The arm around Dean’s waist slips lower, and Cas’s hand finds the curve of Dean’s hip to grip and pull, warm through the fabric of Dean’s boxers and encouraging him closer. Dean lifts one leg for room then nudges out the other to gently force a disgruntled Gabriel down to the floor. He sends out a brief mental apology as Gabriel huffs and complies, granting Dean the freedom to turn, he and Cas chest-to-chest and continuing to trade long, lazy kisses.
Still a weird name.
Dean feels the rush of relief and warmth of simple pleasure straight down to his toes. “No prob, Cas.”

Rebecca manages to stammer out a reply and retreats, face flaming. Jamie is both sympathetic and
Psh. Spoilsport.
Dean dares to feel a spark of hope, deep in his chest. “Three thirty,” he says, then breaks out in a grin, wholly unrepentant. “Usually.”
and oh, fuck, Dean is so screwed. “Yes,” Cas says, considering and low. He brings up a hand to tug sharply at a lock of hair curling at his forehead. “You did say you would trim it soon.” He turns to make his way back down the hall, throwing over his shoulder as he goes, “A shampoo and a cut is standard procedure, yes?”
“I don’t… I don’t really want to talk about Dean right now.”

There’s a few of us, yeah. Probably a couple dozen in the States. Can’t say for sure.
Ugh, whatever. You’re hopeless.
“Uh, wow, really?”
“Nothing,” Cas quickly returns, then grimaces at his own transparency.
It was just, I wanted…
Shit, Cas, what? What’s going on?
Dean stares, asks, “What’s that?”

“Drop it, Cas! I said no!”
It’s weeks after the man first started coming in that he takes up a napkin to write,

To his credit, Castiel only hesitates a moment before shrugging out of the oversized trench, leaving it to bunch at his back. He looks to Dean in question;

kill those people.”
Juan shakes it off, deciding to at least pretend to be a professional. “You want it just like this?”
Dean joins the line – four long, what the fuck - and grimaces down at the contents his cart. Boots, underwear, socks, toothbrush, deodorant; the sorriest ‘Congrats! You’re Human Now!’ starter pack there ever was.
“We’ll take a black coffee and a triple salted caramel mocha, extra whip,” she says, leaning forward, just a bit, as if divulging some great secret. She smiles, sharp and sweet. “Mediums, please.”

until he’s buried to the hilt and Cas’s nose is pressed to his groin, throat tight around him and tongue a delicious pressure on the underside of his cock.
The man says nothing, just looks at Dean with pleased, somewhat puzzled eyes.

“Hello, Sam.”
Any time, buddy.
“He’s homeless, right?” Krissy says, moving further forward to murmur low, bracing her forearms to the counter and likely messing up Dean’s neat piles of slips in the process, god damn it Krissy. “He’s gotta be.”
It was a risk – if calculated – to forgo the devil’s trap and leave the demon’s powers largely untethered. But, regardless of the dangers, Castiel needs him relaxed. Receptive to what’s to come.
“It’s good,” Dean says, grinning across to his brother. “It’s— It’s gonna be good, Sammy.”
Cas rolls his eyes, though the fondness remains. “The grave desecrations. Was it a ghoul?” He moves further into Dean’s space, close and familiar, to brush a kiss at Dean’s jaw, tilts his chin to say, “I missed you, Dean,” warm at Dean’s ear.
Dean feels carefully over the package’s contents – thick fold of bills, small bundle of protective herbs, and an iron obfuscation charm which should prevent anyone at the post office from looking too closely, not unlike the one they keep in the Impala to avert unwanted attention. He tucks inside a slip of a note –
“…The
And with that, Dean twists, hungry and searching for a kiss from Cas’s sinful lips. Their mouths meet and it's a simple truth that Dean, born to darkness, has spent most of his life groping for context on the things he's been told –
“Shoulda used less soap,” says a voice at his ear, unexpected and low.
Dean grins, wide and quick. “Pancakes?” he asks, and the man nods. Dean nods, too. “Sure, no problem,” he says and, turning his head towards the kitchen, hollers, “Need some pancakes!”
Fuck Hemingway, but Dean’s dime copy of
Castiel sways slightly under Dean’s hand, now roughly clasped to his shoulder. Letting himself be moved, yes, but Castiel discovered early on that the hunter would sooner cause himself harm than learn to curb these strange, sharp and insistent touches. “C’mon, Cas,” he says, steering Castiel away and ignoring completely Sam’s offended, pouting huff of breath. “I’m gonna teach you a little somethin’ somethin’.”
Dean begins to build up another protest, only to be stopped short by Cas’s hand, landing heavy and hot on his thigh under the table. A startled glance up, and Cas catches his eye and holds, way too close and intense for having Sam sitting, like, right fucking there. Or, y’know, public in general.
More than used to what he personally likes to call the

then: the frustrated strike of a closed fist against drywall, or maybe the tired drop of a heavy head against cheap, hollow wood.
Dean’s breath catches, and his entire body locks up tight. He remains painfully stiff for an endless moment and then, on a long exhale of air, sags, surrendering completely to Castiel’s hold; the fight drained from him as quickly as it came. Castiel cautiously releases Dean and quickly steps away.
07:34 AM  02/05/08
“Please, Dean? I’m still the new guy up there, and this is my opportunity to make some connections, get to know people!” Sam turns the puppy eyes up to 11. “I don’t want to be the loner friendless loser. Please just come.”
Except. Dean shines like something holy under the light of the early evening sun. His skin glows golden, and his eyes seem unreal, a green so vibrant and clear they subvert everything Castiel thought he knew of the color. He is beautiful and loved and here, alive, standing right before Castiel, at last. It’s almost enough to distract him from the gun at his head.
What am I even doing? This is fucking insane.
“You’re crying.”
Dean scoffs with exaggerated disgust, “Really, Sam? Give me the $15 nosebleeds over one of those bullshit glassed-off boxes any day.”
“What? No, I’m just…sitting parked, I guess.”
