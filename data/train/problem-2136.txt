"Sherlock, eat something finally. You'll starve yourself to death one day if you keep doing this."
As crazy as it might sound, it smells distinctly familiar, like John’s perfume.
come and it's no longer
maybe it's the one
"John, I'm bored." You start again, leaning slightly onto the back of his chair, your elbows colliding with the man's shoulder blades. You hear John inhaling deeply, not turning around just yet but slowing the rhythm of his tapping steadily. "Bored out of my mind, to tell the truth."
Something cool gets pressed against his ribs the next second and Sherlock swears aloud,
"Oh my, how generous of you indeed." John is practically gritting his teeth now, banging through cabinets in search of a rug. You roll your eyes, reaching for your violin but halfway changing your mind. You toss paper towels at John the moment he comes into view fuming and before he can say anything you go up-stairs.
He chuckles to himself, eyeing the gloomy sky as the first few drops begin to fall once again, "It's a rhetorical question though, isn't it?"
Sarah might be considered an elfin woman. She has her strength though, the inner as well as the out-side one and as she stumbles towards you and grips your coat tightly between her snow-white fingers, it is hard to find a good way of an escape. There's an open road round somewhere but her silhouette blocks out the lantern's light and you cannot read the road sign to know the address for sure.
You sit speechless for a few seconds, not really grasping the importance of the whole conversation. The atmosphere grew suffocatingly serious over just a few words and the dizziness in your head doesn't help much to understand something you aren't able to do right in much more normal state of mind and body. "Pardon me, I-"
wound
? Is it you?
blessing and cursing your spine and blissful warmth
You stare at your hands the moment the door clicks quietly, smoothing your trousers absent-mindlessly. You're mildly surprised when John comes back a few minutes later, gripping his phone with whitened knuckles and an unreadable expression on his face. You almost want to laugh when he tosses it towards you, a challenge glistening in his eyes.
Sherlock curls a fist against his side, calculating.
"Do things your way then, it's all fine by me. I have errands to run and as you once said, about yourself, I am no babysitter." He flickers his eyes to the side, licking his lips nervously, a hard glint appearing in his eyes as he throws the covers over you carelessly.
"Whenever you accept the reality, in fact." Sarah closes her eyes briefly, forcing herself to smile at you. "I've everything in boxes already."
You snuggle into your blanket, feet dangling off the couch. Good thing that John hasn't been sipping his tea like he usually does for now he splutters curses and bickers at the jam that fell from his sandwich. He dropped it centimeters from his mouth, splattering the bloody coloured jelly onto the floor, hardly missing his jumper. Hideous woolly thing that one is but still you can't help but smile at the sight of it in the morning.
but then the updates
!" John's voice echoes from the depths of the flat, suddenly, muffled somewhat and Sarah's eyes flicker momentarily to the side upon hearing it. Her pupils seem to widen and before you can anything, she slams one of her hands between the door and your arm. You don't move, still sipping your tea, glancing at her with a half-amused smirk, not blinking. John keeps banging with the drawers and cupboards, happily oblivious to everything, still moaning and groaning, 'It's already damn freezing in here without your help, you know.'
John spits his tea and you huff, sitting down on the couch heavily. You fist your hands while John is fervently closing some of the windows whose headings you just saw. He spins around in his chair, pretending not to look flustered. You pick the gardening magazine once again, bees keeping much more interesting than John's mouth closing and opening like goldfish's, his eyes going to and fro between you and the computer.
on things far too unimportant to ever play a role
The girl is so young and as feminine as any teenager would like his women to be, a scrawny redhead with long coppery hair twining down board-flat chest and halfway onto the muddy grass. Her flowery dress has been torn in a couple of places but otherwise there is no visible sign of a fight upon her face or beneath her naked milky breasts save for a few big, livid bruises on her stomach. She looks as if she was sleeping, heavy make-up going down her freckled cheeks in two glittering rivers, staining her swollen lips black.

Everything, even a silly question about sexuality which doesn't interest you at all.
it doesn't matter anymore
Moriarty puffs the smoke upwards. “Your little lap dog really doesn't do drugs with you?” He takes another deep drag, eyes closing in obvious pleasure. There is a rasp to his voice when he puts a closed fist against his hip in mock disapproval. “Such a pity! I'd have had so much more fun with him if he had already known the feeling. Bad, bad Sherlock!
"Sherlock, please close the goddamn door for

"Pardon me?" His voice is just as strained as his face and he tries to yank his hand away. You'll have none of it of course and thus instead of putting the much needed distance between the two of you, you come closer. "You are the one jumping to conclusions, not I!"

"Has Miss Sawyer said no to your proposal?"
it's okay to feel scared
that icy pressure on my chest
Maria's hair is short, cut somewhat tomboyish but she still has that stereotypical air of feminity around her, if something like that even exists. Your eyes are soft when you draw out a photo from one of your pockets, the ring in it looking just as eerie as always. You wonder why you haven't noticed its bulge on White's throat but now that you know what exactly to look for, it's laughably easy.
“What in the fuck-” I try speaking but my voice breaks, a coughing fit making my eyes water. There is disgust in the way he levels his head at me.
when it's over
You don't care for his answer. It's already perfectly clear.
"What is it?" You turn back, wet and cold wind lashing onto your throat as the coat opens slightly with your movements. John isn't looking at you, his back pressed against the side of some building, a flower shop you notice momentarily when you hastily make his way up to him. 'Look, we don't have time for any sentimental talks right now, it's high time we…'
You're not sure, just as always, what exactly it is, that thing in your chest when you see another of them. Even though thoughts about the cases (a small Ukrainian syndicate interested in killing off local prostitutes, a few false bomb alarms and a couple of petty thefts) are more important, you still pocket the shots and stare at them long into the night, trying to understand something that perhaps has nothing to do with logic at all.
I feel more nowadays than I realistically think
But well, he'll just have to start enjoying it as much as you do, huh?”
Maria McCoy was five years older than Sarah White. You observe her folded arms, no trace of fight visible, her clothes mudded and torn in the same places like the last time. Her make-up has been flowing down her face in the rain, mascara rivers soaking the collar of her whitish shirt. She played a string instrument for her left hand fingertips are calloused and their fingernails are skin-short. She misses her left ring finger and when you expose her stomach, you're not surprised to see a set of livid purple bruises grazing its lower half.
I didn't taste the air heavy with blood oozing from every
It's raining cats and dogs when you get to the park, your hair plastered to your forehead with all the liquid flowing down your nose and lips. John is fully awake at your side by now, scrunching his shoulders and muttering quietly under his breath, glancing at you with pretense from time to time. So okay, okay, neither of you remembered to get the umbrella from behind the armchair. Is it so important though, the sky being slashed through with thunders from time to time, the sky inky black upon your heads? You roll your eyes and nearly run up to the neatly covered with thick rich yellow tapes meadow near the Bird Sanctuary.
Sarah looks tired, even more than the last time you saw her. She has dark circles underneath her once bright eyes, her make-up flowing down under the tears' influence and isn't her lower lip a bit swollen by any chance? People are rushing to and fro behind your back and round her, the afterglow flickering and making it harder to see anything in the dim light of the afternoon. You are neither tired nor cold now, the curiosity coming at its peak in one quick caress of your eyes over her hunched shoulders.
You don't say anything when John's shots you a questioning gaze over his cup of tea, your eyes glued to the newest online headlines done in bold, angry red letters.
you know you knew the answer but really
But Sherlock, you are asexual. You are asexual, God damn it. It has always been one of those things you knew for sure, you didn't need anyone approve of or accept fully. It was one of those things which were stable but now it's falling apart, falling apart because of the damned piece of muscles, veins and cavernous body. You don't know why tears are the first thing that untangle themselves from the misty mess in your head but here you are, clutching your arms and rocking to and fro, bringing your head steadily onto the door. You are sobbing noiselessly, feeling your lips swell and desire dies in you on its own with a bitterly tasting finale, your whole body going stiff in contrary.
the blanket lonely starry nights and things I forgot to tell you the last time you were around
"I don't need your help!" The sentence leaves your mouth sooner than you have completed thinking the whole phrase containing it. There is venom in your tone, an indescribable amounts of it but the throbbing in your head only triggers the irrational hurt you feel gnawing at your insides. Dry cough shakes your whole ribcage painfully while John observes you from under furrowed brows, his silhouette tensing once again. You do not notice it happening straight away, but the tone of your voice raises, "I don't want you to occupy your precious time-"
maybe this
Before he can stand up and flee outside or wherever else, you catch his wrist in an iron-like grip. It seems weird the moment you notice what exactly you are doing but it doesn't matter for the time being, does it? John's skin is sweaty, slipping away slowly but you hold on tightly, feeling the irregular pounding of his heart beneath your fingertips.
"Isn't your girlfriend bothered by this kind of things?"
You want to tell the man, for the logical part of your brain instantly recognised the voice as masculine, to leave you alone and come back later. He should just let you rest and not try to do something unimaginable for you this exact moment.
and this time
Your voice is quiet and at first John seems not to have heard you at all. He sighs and stops reading the paper, his cup of tea steaming on the counter. He smiles to himself before looking at you, amusement filling his gaze, silently urging you to continue with whatever you have on your mind.
Your voice catches itself in your throat. You don't know what caught you more off guard, surprise, revulsion or rather that sudden emptiness deep in your gut, as if you just missed a step on the staircase and was about to come tumbling down onto the street.
His footsteps are loud in the flat as he stomps upstairs and all you can do is to stare at his retreating back. You shakily let out a breath which you haven't noticed holding the whole time.
Somehow, despite me being on watch, trying to predict what he would do, he surprises me. Again. I probably should have known better.
You neither ask him when he will be back , nor does he honor you with such a piece of information.
"Don't you have anything better left to do than looking dumb, Anderson?" You snap at him finally, feeling your patience wear off. You glance at him sideways, the blinding white lights of the laboratory irritating your eyes as much as the mere sight of him. You open your lips widely, as if a sudden thought stroke you, "Oh, I forgot. It's the only think you know inside out after all, isn't it? Do forgive me my forgetfulness."
"You saw Sarah, didn't you?" John's voice is quiet, a little raspy as if he just had a coughing fit. You look at him over your shoulder, still crouching at McCoy's head, your own tilted slightly in interest. It was bound to happen, what with the tale-tale the woman always seems to be to you, at least when it comes to John's interest. He stares impatiently at you, hands stuffed into his jeans' pockets and you can't help but play the dumb just for the kicks, even for a few minutes.
John sighs immediately and you can almost hear his eyeballs rolling in their sockets. You spot with satisfaction that Anderson's forehead vein started to throb centimeters underneath his pale skin. He breaths through his nose as you smirk in triumph, your mood already rising up. He turns his head sharply towards Lestrade but the latter just shrugs, coughing slightly in disinterest.
There was another murder like the one you two have been working on for the past week, this time just a few feet from the Speaking Corner.
kissing groping and laughing
"Why should I? It's six in the morning, Sunday and the dawn has been just a few minutes ago. If it weren't for you, everybody would still be peacefully sleeping, me included." You yawn excruciatingly, brushing off toast crumbs from your lips, mug in your hand barely warm any longer. With the most bored expression you can muster this early in the morning, you bring the door closer to yourself, nearly closing it completely, "Come some other time. Or don't come at all, either way sounds good to me."
You feel irritation growing in the pit of your stomach at that but before he closes the casing you look over his shoulder, not even trying to hide the sarcasm suddenly tinting your voice. "Oh really? It's interesting to hear that Sarah needs attractive Ukrainian girls in bikinis in her work. Is she making a PHD in that area? You've got plenty of research done on that quite alright."
it's over outside the dreams
and your fingers everywhere
"I wanted to talk to you about Sarah, help you around a bit but now I see it's pointless once again. What exactly isn't pointless to do in front of you?" John's breathing becomes shallower as he comes closer, covers still in his hands. You don't know what would be a better idea to act upon if you weren't this pitifully weakened. Running or rather staying put?
at such a jigsaw
world darkened enough for me to see your eyes
Nothing interesting happens for at least a week you spend pocketing more and more of the photographs you've never really noticed before until now. They've began to get monotous and quite boring with each day though because, really, how many different poses a model in a bikini or just with her panties on, can strike? John seems to show a liking towards brunettes, petite and with small breasts which couldn't really fill a hand. B- to C-cup, narrow hips and a girlish, flirtatious smile playing on the corners of lips of each of them. They all look so fake, trying to raise some money to maintain a living in a foreign country, get at least a degree in something or just kill the boredom beside their useless husbands. It all plays in the corners of their bare arms, defiant stares from under too big nerdy glasses or a sad glint in the eyes despite the cheerful pose. It all seems just as mechanical as you've read. Pull your pants down, the business and then forget about everything until next time.
It is a game, just a game, no matter what either of us says. One that will not end even after going across the horizon. The winners and losers change but this is for the best.
It's well past midnight when John shows himself in the flat finally, his clothes rumpled and stinking of cigarette smoke. You flick your eyes from the article on unusual jewelry you have been reading right onto his face, thousands of books scattered around the floor and your skin bluish in the laptop's afterglow.
and my tears and your sore throat and the way your lips quiver when I laugh out loud and the breath
"Sorry for calling so late into the night." He smirks at the yawning grotesquely widely John. You pat the man lightly on the shoulder, chuckling quietly when he glares at you. Lestrade observes the two of you intently but before he can make any useless comment, you tell him to show you the body. He snickers but turns to the figures lying crumpled on the grass. "Sarah White, a twenty year old student of architecture."
You feel your facial muscles freeze. Jesus
” he shouts. He clumsily tries to shrug off his coat, arms getting caught within its folds.
I must do things
Sherlock wants to lunge himself at Moriarty’s throat but before he can twist away from the knife – both the masked meat-for-hire and Moriarty are long gone. There is smoke filling the space, milky mist that makes it hard to breathe and he needs to get away as soon as possible.
The newspaper falls from my grasp, my whole body goes rigid. His fingers are crushing my windpipe. I should have known better.
There was a strange murder in Hyde Park, a woman in her early twenties. They need you as soon as possible there, Donovan and Anderson already looking correspondingly for any witnesses and tracks which just seem to drain with all of the water down into The Serpentine's opaque depths.
just this one time
"It's ridiculous." John's voice is muffled and his head comes onto the plaster with a dull thump. He gazes at the silvery tinted sky with furrowed brows, the sound of his laughter humorless and cold. "You're ridiculous. I'm ridiculous."
to bring me back
John is mumbling something in his sleep when Lestrade calls finally. It's two in the morning, the afterglow of the street lanterns misting the windows over, John breathing heavily in an armchair next to you. The detective curses constantly, the heavy sound of raining echoing in the receiver, making it near impossible to get what he is talking about.
After a couple of days of sniffling around, watching Lestrade frown at John sneezing and coughing by your side and listening to Donovan's moaning and groaning about your involvement in the case as always, one thing is certain for sure.
Keys are cold in your grip and so is the scarf finally laid down on the table with all of the hastily unpacked goods. John glares at you from the armchair he is sitting in with his newspaper and you almost want to leap from joy at the newest situation emerging before your very eyes. Perfect, everybody playing in a silent film, just perfect.
"Where have you been?" You look at him with unblinking eyes for a long moment, your fingers motionless on the keyboard.
Suddenly, there is a flicker of bright light on his left, somewhere in a backstage doorway. Sherlock begins creeping along the wall, his breath hitched, eyes focused and determined.
There is something very wrong in these quiet words. You know that much already and your palms begin to sweat as John continues, kicking a few stray stones with the tip of his shoe, "I don't get it, Sherlock. Is someone's happiness that much unreasonable to you that you feel the need to destroy it straight away the moment you get the chance?"
it's the reality, not a dream anymore
Quickening breath, drawn-out against the nape of my neck, “We agreed.”
and it'll be over
Your whisper is faint on the wind, "Tell me."
the day they brought
"You are impossible, Holmes. Just-" John groans, bringing his hands in the air. He shakes his head silently the next second and walks out of the kitchen, the once fresh scent of tea disappearing the moment his back leave your field of vision.
They caught the murderer without further complications. Sherlock's hunch was right. "Home?", he asked John after giving Lestrade his statement. John nodded. They turned to Victor. "Actually I think we should catch up later. I want to go and eat something." They parted ways. John couldn't think about anything other than Victor's encouragement. 'Just make a move.' If only it were that easy. They were walking, the distance short enough to make a cab ride unnecessary. Sherlock's hand bumped into his from time to time. And John made a move. Their hands tangled. And Sherlock froze. So John froze too. They stopped walking altogether, just standing on the sidewalk, holding hands. John's heart was close to exploding. "Is this... is this some sort of joke?", Sherlock asked, his voice hollow. John's heart must've exploded at that point. "I... no, Victor said.." Those were apparently the wrong words, since Sherlock turned around and ran back right where they came from.
They dined in an italian restaurant, Angelo's. The chef had a table ready for them right away. "Just this summer i did him a favour and saved him from a life sentence. He was convincted with urder charges, but Angelo was in a completely different part of town doing robberies." Angelo came up to the table now and asked for their orders. John ordered a Peperoni pizza while Sherlock wanted a lasagna. "Oh and ill get you a candle for you amd your date, it"s more romantic." Sherlock offered Angelo a smile while John offered him a strained "Not his date." Angelo didnt seem to have caught that and simply got a candle for the table anyways. John just nodded firmly and Sherlocks gaze dropped to his meal.
But because his work life and his home life were two different things, noone really knew of their relationship. Sherlock didn't have a problem with confidence or pride in his relationship but he wasn't one to just open up about his feelings and relationships. Partly because half of Scotland Yard basically hated him.
S:"my side of the bet doesn't really matter, 'cause I will win."
At lunch John sat alone at the Hufflepuff table. Well, there were other people but no Sherlock. By now John had realised what a dick he'd been to Sherlock earlier. Sherlock deserved better than that. Sherlock wasnt responsible for John's weird behaviour or confusion. He needed to apologize. Johns gaze drifted away from Molly in front of him and to the person sitting behind her, at the Ravenclaw table. Sherlock fucking Holmes.
"Well, you constantly have bad breath!"
The next day was Christmas eve. Shouting was heard throughout the entire day. "How ironic", John thought. They all went to church. It was tradition. And his mum insisted. And he didn't want to upset her so he just went along. Later, at the dinner table, his father glared in Johns general direction. John ignored it. If he did anything wrong, he knew he'd miss the blessed silence. Thankfully, Ma brought dinner. They started eating until they heard a knock on the door. "I'll go", John said, desperate to get away from the table.
"No physical fight aside from the headwounds." "They didn't expect it?", John asked. "No, I think they did." John frowned. "Look, there's a picnic mat. They sat gathered around it. But one side's open. There was a fourth. That person killed the other three." "Maybe the killer just moved the three." "No, that would've left trails." John nodded. "So someone they knew", he stated. Sherlock agreed. "Lestrade, check their identities and ask friends and family members." "On it!", he said and phoned the police station to do just that. Now Victor joined them, having pried Sally and her flirting away. John was examining the bodies. "Only recently deceased. Maybe ten hours." "It's like 10 in the morning, who would go for a picnic at midnight?", Victor asked. "Someone interested in astonomy", John answered. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Last night was some can't-miss starshower. I read about it in the papers." "So three stargazers die watching the nightsky?", Victor asked. "They were four. The fourth was the murderer." Lestrade came back and announced that the friends and family of the victims were being brought in for questioning. So Sherlock, John and Victor took a cab to the police station to do the questioning. "Ah, I've forgotten how much fun this was!", Victor laughed, nudging Sherlock and John in the side. Sherlock smiled at him and then looked at John. John could've sworn he'd seen his pupils dilating but when Sherlock looked away, he convinced himself it had just been a trick of the light.
I hope you liked it :)
During the meal he found himself looking over to the Ravenclaw table at times, using the excuse of 'veelas', that his buddies were going on about as a disguise to look at the curly-haired boy again. He was barely speaking nor eating. His eyes were mesmerising. He looked at lots of people intensely as if he was trying to read their thoughts or something. And there was something about him that kept John's attention at his person.
John was having none of it. He stormed after the boy who, despite his lanky appearance could compete in the running Olympics. But John knew the castle better and found a shortcut. Unfortunately he came through the secret tunnel at the same time the boy passed and they bumped together and both landed on the floor. "No, you won't run, stop it!" He rose his arm and the boy flinched. Johns face fell. "Were you- hey sorry... i don't want to hit you or hurt you in any way." The crease between the dark haired boys eyebrows deepened in disbelief. "That's... odd." John carefully asked:"What is?" "I can't detect a lie." John was baffled. "Well, cause I'm not. Lying. I just want to know who you are and how you knew about my father." The boy nodded. "I didn't stalk you or anything, if that's what you're concerned about. I just saw you were muggleborn and alongside a few other things, noticed the dog tags. And you were obviously too young, and while your brother or uncle would work, father is more likely." "What other things" The boy looked at him in wonder. He then caught himself and started speaking again at a pace which seemed to be reserved for only him as noone else John knew of could ratter down facts in such a rush. "I know he was a muggle and that he was an army doctor and you aspire to be a doctor too. Magical though. So healer. I know he hasn't got a good relationship with you or your brother, but with him especially. And I noticed your mobile device. Your brother gave it to you. Harry is worried about you and wants to stay in touch but you dont approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his girlfriend. And due to a traumatic event your muggle therapist thinks that limp you had was psychosomatic, quite correctly I'm afraid. But you're not limping anymore, are you? That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? Oh and the name's Sherlock Holmes." John was baffled. "That was amazing. Incredible." "You really think that?", the boy asked sheepishly. "Of course, it was quite... brilliant." Sherlock frowned. "That's not what people usually say." "Well, what do people usually say?" Sherlock smirked. "Piss off" John laughed at that. Sherlock joined in. "So what are you doing today, want me to give you a tour of the castle?", John grinned. Sherlock thought about that. "Do you know any secret passages?" "Sure!" John smiled evilish, something very unlike him. Sherlock could tell, he was an expert on people. And he accepted.
The next time Greg drove to Baker Street, he was dreading Sherlock already. If John was still in Dublin, Sherlock was probably still incredibly rude, careless and insensitive. So fully expecting to be yelled at, Greg sneaked up the stairs. But what he found instead was Sherlock curled up on the couch, head in John's lap. John was stroking his hair while reading. The obnoxious Sherlock was replaced by one that was cuddling with his boyfriend. Sherlock opened his mouth. "You're not spoiling this, Sherlock. I want to figure it out myself", John cut him off before Sherlock could start his sentence. Sherlock just giggled and carefully pried John's hand away from his curls, took it into his hands and brought it up to lips to pepper it with kisses.
Sherlock was always hyper-aware of John's presence. So much much that perhaps it was compromising him. The "small room" in his mind palace, entirely entitled to John, had grown. Sherlock knew why. Of course he did, he wasn't stupid. He had carefully categorised all of his physical reactions to John's presence. Elevated heartrate, sweating, an unconscious mirroring of movements and likely dilated pupils. He was in love with John. But Sherlock didn't know what to do about it. Or of he even should do anything about it. He knew John too well, he couldn't just deduce whether he returned the sentiment or not. If he didn't, their friendship might be over. Staying silent in order to eliminate that variable was the safest option. Yet Sherlock couldn't stop noticing him. Always there, right next to him. During Defense Against the Dark Arts, John leant onto the table. His shirt rode up his hips. Sherlock's breath hitched and he didn't notice Professor Moody once again sipping from his flask.
the first task, the first case, the first time Johns 'immovable heterosexuality' really comes up... NOT HIS DATE
It turns out, the murderer was an old school friend, ending a decade-long terrible feud. They tried to make up with another skywatching picnic, something they'd done in uni a lot, according to the friends brought in for questioning. After some digging, John found out the name of the fourth, estranged, friend. And with a warrant to search the suspect's flat, they went searching for clues. In the murderer"s flat, Victor accidentally moved a floorboard. "Sherlock, the weapon is in the floor!", he called out with surprise. They ended up finding a bleach-dripping telescope, which was an unusual weapon for sure but according to Sherlock "not the weirdest murderer weapon I've seen". Victor almost asked, but John's 'Don't'-look advised him to do otherwise.
And for some reason John sighed too and opened the folder. The first page consisted of a big picture, black and white. A man on a stretcher with something encarved onto his belly. "Okay, theres a man." "Wonderful deduction, go on", Sherlock said. John gave him the deathstare. "He has encarvings on his stomach, that's runes i think. No, hieroglyphs." Sherlock nodded. John thought Sherlock was mocking but it could also have been an encouragement. "Thats..." He leaned closer, trying to decipher it. "Ha-di, i think. Destroy." Sherlock nodded again. "Harry loved this stuff when she was my age and i read a few of her books", he explained. "But the cut is too clean. Too little blood. It was done after he died." "Incredible. What else?", Sherlock asked animatedly. "So im guessing some Egypt-nerd wanted to really destroy him" Sherlocks encouraging smile made him a bit nervous. After a bit of silence, Sherlock nodded. "Okay, that's pretty good." John frowned. "You probably have thrice the information. Sherlock had a perfect pokerface. "Go on, i wanna know now." Sherlock looked at the photo too now. ,"He was an archaeologist. Hes just returned from travel to an african country, the tan suggests that. His hair is dyed and bleached but his eyebrows arent to match it. Small scars all over his torso. And this bite-", he stopped to point at a small dot at the mans chest", is what killed him. Its clear. The man was chased and could flee without arousing suspicion due to his job as an archaeologist. The murderer followed him. So the man dyed his hair to not be recognised. In his sleep the murderer killed him with poison. Something rare, nearly undetectable. I would run tests if i were there...The murderer wanted his wife." "His wife?" "The ring is missing. There is a tanline. Where did it go, has he eaten it? No, the murderer took it. And to draw attention away from the obvious signs of poisoning, he slit open his stomach in an attempt to link it to the mans coworkers. It was a long time friend. Whos most likely pursuing the wife of this gentleman here", his fingers landed on the picture of the dead man again. "That was incredible. All just from the picture!" Sherlock looked at it again. "In hindsight its pretty obvious...", Sherlock remarked. John scoffed. "In hindsight, yes." The two looked at each other again. John looked away quickly. "Going to send this back to the police then?" Sherlock nodded. "Wish me luck" "For the chance of seeing a crime scene?" Sherlocks eyes sparkled. His lips turned up into a smile. He nodded enthusiastically. "Okay then. Sherlock took out his wand. "What are you doing?" Sherlock then gave him his 'seriously-isn't-it-obvious-?' look. John countered with his 'stop-it' glare. "I can hardly use an owl for this, can I? Officer Gregston might already think of me as sketchy or weird for offering my help with murders at the ripe age of 16. If I were to send my mail with owl... I don't think that will work out." Shwelock then proceeded to cast a few protection spells as well as the water-repel charm 'Impervious' on it and then threw it in the air. With a flick of his wand, the window opened and Sherlock moved his wand and also the folder with pictures and his letter to Gregston towards the window. The folder flew away into the sky. "Smart.", John commented.
“Sherlock! For god’s sake stop!”
“Oh my, sorry, so sorry dear,” she fusses.
“Yes, sir,” John gives a jaunty salute, before they wander off, shoulders pressed together.
John remembers getting into the cab, but not much else until he wakes up a few hours later with a pounding headache. His mouth is dry and his throat scratchy, but he calls out, “Helios?”
Sherlock tries to shift his face into a more pleasant expression, but imagines he falls short. “I need you to come with me to Baskerville,” he orders, “now.”
John does not know exactly where Sherlock is. It isn’t like he has GPS coordinates, but the bond tugs him along, whispering the way as he sprints through the city. He knows he must look mad, stopping at every junction, turning his head this way and that as he tries to figure out where the bond wants him to go.
John watches with tears in his eyes as the knife seems to get stuck on something in the air.
“Well,” Mycroft sighs, watching her trail disperse. The once glowing blooms of the garden have dimmed to nothing, leaving only the fading scent of magnolias. With the dragon gone, the lengthening shadows of the garden seem rife with unknown threat.
“You’re insane, that’s just a old pelt!” John yells, kicking out at the man, but he’s not close enough to hit.
“It’s not,” Sherlock shakes his head, “I’m not being emotional. This is the fastest way to find the killer and I am weighing the odds. The mark only contains one dose of poison and the Wu won’t be able to control anyone of a stronger class.”
John faces the voice. The man is old, hair grey and thin. His skin is sickly pale, dark bruise smudged beneath his eyes. He’s dressed in a grey cardigan and torn trousers, a strange combination beside the red fox pelt slung around his shoulders. When the man raises his hand, John notices the bloody bandages wrapped around the stumps of his index and pinky fingers.
Billy and Gary are shifting nervously on their seats as Lestrade flips through their books. John is pretty sure the detective isn’t even reading the books, but he hums every  once in awhile and it makes the two even more nervous.
John shakes his head. “Not that kind of ringing, just an annoying buzz.”
“It stands for Bond, James Bond.”
John’s voice whispered in his mind allowing Sherlock to catch the hesitating steps moving up the stairs.
“Yes, of course,” Mrs. Hudson takes a deep breath, looking nervous but determined.
“You need help, Cap?” Bill asks.
“Ah, that’s not good.”
They gather up and set off again, and the next few days, while tiring, are blissfully safe. It doesn’t last.
He startles when Sherlock barges in, his fists up and ready to fight, but relaxes once he gets a look at him. “You’re the kid from the park,” he exclaims, surprised.
Closer inspection shows it is a protection bond from a fae. He recognizes the unique signature of a banshee. He’s not sure why Sherlock would create a bond to the Holmes name with his new minder. It has only been a month since he hired Mrs. Hudson, but there is no telling what Sherlock managed to get himself involved with in such a span. Not for the first time, Mycroft wonders if he ever should have left home.
John chuckled, looking less nervous. “Um, yeah, would you…” he held out his hand.
He reached out along the bond, but in sleep he could only register John’s contentment. Nothing like the raging storm of
Sherlock’s answer is a raise of his brow.
His palm is unmarked, and Lestrade is rather curious what this man’s gift is. His only visible bond is a green familial one, that he suspects connects to his brother. “I’ve been keeping an eye on him since we met, but I promise to try and keep them out of some trouble.” Lestrade takes his hand, and gasps when a jolt shoots up his arm and his sight is blinded with splashes of colour. He stumbles away from the grip, his heart pounding as he tries to get air into his lungs.
It is a painful wait, but Sherlock lets him get down his first few sips of coffee before asking, “the case?”
Sherlock yelled, rushing forward to help what he knew was an illusion.
Lestrade cuts him off, “Yes, winter holidays, and Christmas is in two days. You should be home. Not running around London chasing criminals and nearly getting yourself killed.”
Unwilling to force the issue, Mycroft responds, his typing slow and tedious.
Moriarty’s expression dissolves into a deep frown. “I thought,” he growls, “that Sherlock was perfect. A intellect like mine, without the useless connections. Of course there was dear big brother and the detective, but those were easily dealt with. It was you,” Jim spits, “you and your bond that ruined him. Made him ordinary, just like everyone else.”
“Is your base near Marina Bay?” John asks.
Helios roared above him, her body growing and expanding to a giant creature. She had mixed the two creatures from the book. Her face was sharp and angular like a wolf, but scales peaked amongst the fur and her feet were taloned liked a dragon. Huge falcon wings spread from her back, some dark pattern of brown or grey. Her tail was long and bushy like a fox, but with feathers fanned out at the end like a rudder.
Sherlock presses his hands under his chin looking contemplative. “I’m not certain, but I imagine you will know it when you see it.” He gives a sly grin, “Give a shout if you run across any genetically engineered hounds.”
Sally is already on the defensive, a talisman in her hand. Demons that break out of summoning circles can only last a day or two without a contract to sustain them. Unless they drain human life, that is.
“Yes well, I owed you one,” Sherlock shrugs.
Also, today has been a surprisingly productive writing day. :D
“Exactly,” Sherlock grins and shoves his hand into the murky waters. With an exclamation of triumph he pulls a skull from the water. The eye sockets are filled with mud and there is a leach stubbornly attached to the parietal bone, but its definatly a human skull.
“Well, that is possible, I mean…” Lestrade trailed off, not willing to complete his thought.
The horror of the death was not enough to fell his mum, but the mark on her arm shaded with black and tendrils like veins came out of it, obscuring the once beautiful shapes.
“Would you like to meet him?” Mycroft asks.
. There are three of them as well, one to corral each girl apparently, though marks in the kitchen show the place is usually much more busy. Moriarty must have wanted these three the most.
sorry this took so long. I tried to get my typos under control too haha
The answer to that sentence never came to Johns mind though. Molly and Mike dropped the subject and instead asked Cedric about the tournament. John didn't listen to them. So he didn't realise the conversation with Cedric changed topics. "What's with him?", Cedric asked the two, clearly concerned. "No idea" and "Haven't the faintest", Mike and Molly simultaneously said. "He was blunt towards Sherlock earlier and now he's taking it out on the poor loaf." That was actually pretty accurate. John was slicing his bread aggressively. His bad mood didn't fade. During classes, John couldn't find Sherlock anywhere. Bummed about that, he tried to concentrate on his classes but his attention just turned back to the lanky boy and his stupid swishy hair. Mostly the lack of presence of said lanky boy. Not having paid attention in any of his classes, John came up with the conclusion that maybe avoiding Sherlock was much worse than being friends with him. He barely knew the guy for a week and not being around him already felt wrong. So John set up a few mental rules.
S:" I'm sure i can think of something")
I'll pick you up at 8. -SH
John almost forgot about the favour he owed Sherlock. But when they were going down the stadium to the second task, Sherlock nudged his arm. Johns arms were covered in thick wool and a scarf was thrown around his neck. Sherlock was not dressed weather-appropriately at all. His gangly limbs were only covered by the beauxbatons uniform, much too light to withstand these temperatures. A few feet ahead of them, Irene snuggled into Cho's jacket. John didnt even bring one, he was wearing multiple layers and a warm jumper. "John", Sherlock said faintly, nudging his arm again. "John, do you remember Mirandas apple? The one I stole in transfiguration?" John looked at him. He took in Sherlocks reddened cheeks, pale complexion and the goosebumps visible on the neck. "What favour do you want?" Sherlock pointed to Johns chest. "One of these hideous things. I don't mean to freeze to death." And so John accio'd the oatmeal coloured jumper over to them and Sherlock pulled it over his head while muttering insults at the 'hideous' clothing article.
After having breakfast, John went back to his room to dress. When he came back down, he almost bumped into two visitors coming up the stairs.
It was Harry. She smiled at him widely. He couldn't help but smile back. Harry was a mess but she was his big sister. He obviously loved her. She entered and hung up her jacket before he could even think about the situation that would occur. They entered the kitchen "Happy Christmas!", his sister proclaimed jollily. Then their mothers fork hit the floor. "You cannot be in here, Harriet." She looked scared and angry at once. "Its Christmas eve, surely-", Harry started but she was interrupted by their father "Get the fuck out of here, faggot." He slammed his fist on the table. Harry apparently thought they'd gotten over it by now. "No, it's Christmas, i want to celebrate with my family...", she started, trying to make it better. "No dyke is part of my family, get out!" Harry's face went from happy to ice-cold. "As much as you'd like that to be true, i am still your daughter." And with that she sat down at the table. That was it. Their father arose, taking one big stride across the room and sinking his fist onto his daughters face with terrible speed amd power. A sickening crack filled the room. Harry's whole face was bleeding. She screamed. Their mother let out a soft "no, please", but only flinched at the hit. John, in complete shock, dropped to the floor, looking at Harry's red face. "And what do you think you're doing, boy? Helping disgusting trash? You're just as unnatural as she is." He kicked John, who was trying to carry his sister away, in the knees. John fell immediately. His father was now laughing nastily. Despite the overwhelming pain, he stood up, turned around and punched his father in the face. The former soldier didnt take that lightly. So John, wanting to stay alive, helped Harry up again and they fled the house.
It's science. Not magic. -SH
"Have you thought about what I said last night?", Victor asked John, when they followed Sherlock out of the flat. John nodded. "Come on, I have an idea where he might be!", Sherlock motioned for them to follow him. They did so, but not without Victor asking John: "And?" John shrugged. "I don't know. I mean you're right about me, but I don't think he..." "Trust me, he does", Victor interrupted. "Even if he did like me, how would I broach the subject?" "Just ask him to marry you, he'll say yes." John looked proper pissed now. "Ha ha ha." "But seriously, just make a move. Now come on, don't want to keep him waiting." And Victor started jogging after Sherlock. John rolled his eyes but did the same.
"Tell me about your brother", John suddendly said, jumping around rhythmically to not be hit by owl poop. Sherlock scoffed "Tell me about yours" That made John suppress a giggle. "You already know" Sherlock looked at him "Did I get something wrong?" John tried not to smile at the other boys horrified expression "Harry's my sister. But yes, Clara was her girlfriend, theyre this on again, off again thing." "Sister!", Sherlock cursed. "There's always something!" "But you were completely right with everything else.", John tried to console him. Sherlock finished writing the letter, rolled it up and tied it to a school owls foot. The owl took off. "He's an official at the ministry. Well, more like he is the ministry. His name is Mycroft." "So he works for the French ministry of magic. What else?" Sherlock frowned. "He doesn't. He's the British Government. Magical and non-magical." "You aren't French?" They looked at each other. "Im half- French. Maman is french and wanted me to go to her old school. Our home however, the Holmes manor, my fathers heritage, lies in northern England.", Sherlock explained. "Oh and I was already wondering why you spoke English accent-free." "I'm fluent in three other languages as well but i dont have five parents." John laughed. "Oh really?" They descended the staircase of the Owlery. "Like what?" Sherlock ticked off of his fingers. "English, French, German, Russian and Italian, plus Latin, but you can't technically speak that and enough Spanish and Bulgarian to pass." Then he made a few symbols with his hands. "Seriosly, sign language?" Sherlock nodded. Then he tapped several times on John's arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
While descending the stairs, John remarked: "The Potions Master is Professor Snape. His presence is a bit unpleasant at times." "Oh. Well my presence is unpleasant at all times, so I'm sure we'll get along splendidly." John gulped. He tried to suppress a grin but it didn't really work. "Your facial expression suggests physical pain, please tell me I'm wrong." They've reached the dungepns by now. "Oh, not at all, I'm-" the door opened and Professor Snape almost ran into them. "Watson. What are you doing here?" "Sir, I'm just showing him around." "Sherlock Holmes." Their stares met. It was a battle of the giants. "You should not be here unsupervised." Snape motioned for them to go and they slowly left the dungeons.
Meanwhile, Irene and her parents were catching up and Mycroft stuffed his face with food. In the evening, Mycroft told them about his ministry position. 'Them' being everyone but Sherlock, who didn't listen but instead walked around in his Mind Palace. "Sherlock, did you even listen?" "Eh, nope." Mycroft sighed. Irene patted Mycroft on the back. "I know how you feel. In a week I'll be left all alone with him again, enjoy the time you have." "What is there to enjoy?", Mycroft replied, tired of this. "Certainly not your never-ending anecdotes about the Minister.", Sherlock snapped back. Mycroft rolled his eyes. Their parents surpressed laughter and told all of them not to talk to each other like that. And tge rest of the evening was just a blur of biscuits, french chatter and John in his mind.
2. John wasn't jealous.
"I can't believe I ever dated you!"
But really, three days later the news that Kelly and Ryan had broken up reached John. He found out in Divination, practically the only class Sherlock didn't share with him. They were to meet in the library after. When John entered, the raven-haired girl, Irene, sat in front of Sherlock. Sherlock locked eyes with John and shooed her away. Irene laughed loudly and exited the library, calling out "Have fun, you boys", before she was gone. Sherlock motioned to the chair Irene just sat in. John sat down and frowned at the binder laying on the table. Sherlock had looked it in most of the lessons at least once, Potions aside. Surprosingly, he'd also given the first D.A.D.A lesson his undivided attention. "So Irene's your friend?", John asked lightly. "You could certainly say so", Sherlock said with a laugh. John, now imagining them kissing heatedly against a bookshelf, shivered. "I mean, is she your special friend?' Sherlock was confused now. "I guess so?" Sherlock thought back to all the shared summers at the Holmes Manor where Irene even assisted him with experiments at times. Irene and him were friends but did their status as cousins qualify their friendship as special? John just nodded. That was a confirmation. Sherlock and Irene were an item. Sherlock was straight. "Anyways", Sherlock then said, clearly finding the situation awkward. "you might have been asking yourself about this dossier." He motioned to the folder. Now that caught Johns attention. "Its a case. A muggle police officer send me this after my brother persuaded him to give me a chance. If i solve this cold case, he might consult me on his next crime scene." That certainly was not what John had expected. "Oh, that's..." In his lack of words he nodded. Do you congratulate someone if they get to see a dead body? "I know, right? I can't await it. And I think I solved the case but i could really use an outside opinion..." Sherlock pushed the folder towards John. Who immediately shook his head. "No, I'm not embarrassing myself in front of you like this." "But it would really be useful." John, now violently shaking his head, disagreed. "No, it won't." "John an outside opinion might-" "I'm not doing it! Why dont you ask Irene?" Sherlock sighed. "Please".
yeah the reaction will be in the next chapter. BTW, the next one will go up until like the first task, so don't be mad if it takes a little longer.
also i hope my no beta problem isn't that bad anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock tried to not let his annoyance show too much. He wasnt his even sure why he was annoyed at Irene for interrupting his conversation with the boy.
During the next few days everyone was in a fever of sorts. There was no other topic than the Yule Ball. People who were dating somebody already were coordinating their outfits, dates were being made and a lot of giggling ensued wherever one seemed to go. John for one, was having none of it. He didn't feel like asking somebody, assuming he could hang out with his friends in a group. His mood dropped considerably when Molly got asked out by Greg. They were going as friends of course, but John couldnt really expect to be able to hang out with them since they were likely to spend the evening dancing. Mike and Stella were fairly excited about everything. And he didn't dare to ask Sherlock about it all. John had decided that if he were to avoid the topic completely, no awkwardness and potential friendship-ending situations could ensue.
Every Hogwarts student watched with eager when the other schools were supposed to arrive. "It's a bird!" "No you buffoon, it's a flying house". They were both wrong. A gigantic carriage, led by abnormally large pegasi landed. Out of it came the pastel-blue clothed girls and boys of Beauxbatons.
He didnt see Sherlock at dinner. John thought about going into the dungeons to get him but decided against it. He didnt really know why. He just thought that taking a small break from seeing Sherlock all the time might do him good. Eversince he found out about Irene and Sherlock he got a weird feeling, like he was somehow betraying someone if he spent too much time with Sherlock. Not that he fancied him, or boys for that matter. But he was taking time away from Irene and Sherlock. Who were together. His stomach cramped slightly at the thought. Irene, as Sherlocks girlfriend had first dibs on spending time with him and John didnt want to come between that, as a platonic companion. That was all there was to it.
(See the end of the chapter for
I want to get to know you.
the yule ball basically
Not sleeping wasn't a problem for Sherlock. He could control his system enough to miss a night or two of sleep without being affected by it in the slightest. John seemed to hold up just fine as well. They stopped talking in fear of overhearing the sound and only heard the others breath now. Then, the wood creaked. A door was opened and someone was stepping into the hallway. It was getting closer to them. Dr. Roylott had decided to check on Helen a second time. Sherlock got onto his side and drew John closer to him. He slid his hand over John's mouth and tried to cover his body with his own. John's breath hitched. The door opened. All that Dr. Roylott saw was a lithe figure covered in sheets with black, curly hair sticking out on the pillow. Clearly it was Helen.
The next morning, Sherlock was sitting at the Hufflepuff table when John entered, as usual. Unusually though, John indulged in a conversation with his Hufflepuff friends immediately.
(See the end of the chapter for
John hung up on him. So Sherlock went back inside and pulled off his coat and scarf. He sat down in his chair and waited anxiously. What if John didn't come back? No, he would. But how could he be sure? He was just about to slip into his mind palace to reevaluate everything in his life, when he heard the door click open. Someone came up the stairs. Sherlock almost bit his nails in anticipation. When John came into view he tried to compose himself. He stood up and carefully walked over to him. John looked up, catching his eyes. "You're shivering", John remarked. "Obviously", Sherlock said automatically. John laughed and in that moment Sherlock was sure to have discovered music for the first time again. He leant down and hugged John tightly. "I love you too, you know", John whispered right into Sherlock's ear.
I'm SORRY it took so long, I've been away for 87284 years!!! but don't worry the last chapter will arrive soon.
John had never felt so stupid. Was this really true? In the Great Hall, now very winter-y decorated, he didn't see Sherlock anywhere. But that might have been accounted to the fact that everyone was excitedly jumping around and waiting for the champions to arrive. And really- Viktor Krum and Hermione Granger, Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies and Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory entered the hall. Cho was nowhere to be seen. Excelt that he spotted her, leaning at a table nearby. Irene was standing very close to her. He huffed. Had he really gotten it all wrong?
TRIGGER WARNING, this chapter contains violence and homophobia. John's father is an abusive piece of shit
This couldn't be that hard. "Sherlock." He could feel his cheeks turning red. Most of the Ravenclaws as well as Sherlock's girlfriend were looking at him. "I'm sorry, I was really rather rude earlier." Wow, smooth John. "I uh... Look Sherlock. I understand if you dont want to sit with me-" "I thought you didn't want me there?" Sherlock was the smartest person he knew yet he also seemed to maybe be a fundamental idiot. Except that John was the idiot here. "I behaved like an idiot, of course I want you sitting there." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Irene and the others had started a conversation again. Sherlock didn't stand up. So John turned the other way and went back to his table. Except that Sherlock called after him "Are you sitting down or not?" John only now realised that Sherlock had budged up and made some space for him to sit. John climbed onto the seat. Irene leaned over the table to talk to John. "So, you're the John Watson I've heard so much about." John nodded and looked her into the eyes. She had really pretty eyes. Not as pretty as Sherlocks though. Where did that thought come from? "I'm Irene Adler, I believe we've met." She held her hand out and John shook it. Cho Chang, next to her, now looked at him too. He had a few classes with her and she was part of the quidditch friendgroup. They weren't friends per se, they didn't usually hang out but they were certainly acquainted. Irene and Cho indulged in their conversation again and John now looked over at Sherlock next to him. "Hungry?", he asked him. Sherlocks eyes met his. "Not particularly." The silence between them was a bit awkward. Sherlock looked away again. John focused on something else instead. He started to eat a cornish pastry and listened to the conversation going on again. "Are you doing anything later?" Irene asked. Cho nodded. "Yeah I'm probably going to meet with the quidditch group." "Right. Yeah, ill be coming too.", John decided. "Sherlock, we should totally go too!", Irene told her boyfriend. Sherlock nodded absentmindedly. He nudged Johns arm and pointed in the general direction of the teachers table. "Observe!" Johns head turned quickly. Sherlock was pointing in the general direction of Hadrig. "Thats Hadrig, so what?" "No not the half giant." "Half giant?" "Obviously" Sherlock scoffed slightly and John snorted. He noticed Sherlocks gaze burning into the back of his head. "What am I looking at?" "Below the table" "Sherlock what-" but then he saw it. "What is that?" Something was moving in Hadrigs coat pocket. Sherlock shrugged. John surpressed a laugh and he could feel Sherlocks smile. He was so observant and made everything more interesting. They fell back into their rhythm of companionship easily. Sherlock didn't come to the quidditch practice though. Irene did. And as it turned out she was hilarious and excellent at quidditch, next to being attractive of couse. He could understand why Sherlock was into her. She and Cho were a perfect chaser team. Greg joined them, trying to keep being flexible between positions. Stella and Mary took the roles of beaters and Cedric was seeker. John himself was the keeper. They beat the other team. Quidditch was great. And so were the evenings spent in the common room. But the real highlight of his days was of course the time spent with Sherlock. Sherlock with his annoyingly accurate predictions, brutally honest comments and undeniable charme. Sherlock with his wonderful girlfriend. As the weeks progressed, he got to see more of Irene and her friend Cho too. Sometimes they sat at the Hufflepuff table with Cedric during meals. In class they often sat near Sherlock and John. He even met them in the library once and at the lake. Sherlock wanted to do an experiment at the water. He had been collecting water grasses all day long and John was just laying on the grass, looking up into the sky. It was relatively warm for November so he was fine in his jumper. Irene and Cho were doing homework under a tree as Cedric walked by. They were maybe 20 meters away from him so he didn't know what they were talking about but they were all laughing. Then Cedric turned around and waved at someone. It was Harry Potter. He waved back. The whole 'Potter stinks' thing really ruined Harry's public image. John had talked to him a couple of times, all of the conversations relating to quidditch but he could tell that Harry was genuinly a nice boy. That was why he had, seriously pissed off, talked to a few younger Hufflepuffs wearing these stupid badges. Cedric, Mike, Molly and a few people in Cedric year, like Nathan, Alex and Claire were also sick of the badges and had decided to tell off people. Cedric walked over to him. Irene and Cho were watching the two and giggling. John decided to look back to Sherlock who was now standing knee-deep in the lake. "I didn't know this lake had mermaids", he exclaimed.
They found a ring up the girl's throat a few hours ago, the blue crystal in the centre matted and broken in half. It has a curious design you don't really remember ever seeing. It must have been made on someone's order and you store that information in your mind for later researching. Mrs. White had been dead for at least a few hours the moment the squad found her. She was strangled, bruises on her stomach caused by someone stepping or sitting on her for a longer period of time.
Something feels absolutely out of place now but you don't really know why.
a blink of the time
I didn't see your eyelids purple from the blows
His grasp goes stiffer, my throat constricting, saliva fills my mouth. I try to force a finger in-between his clasped hand, somehow pry it away.
spinning out of control
acting out the schemes of the dreams
Suddenly heavy, fatigued breathing vibrates through the paper-thin walls and a muffled groan follows suit.
A lump fills your throat. Why should you care, you don't care.
opening your arms you tell me to stay
John groans and you wet your lips, feeling nausea slowly getting the better of you.
"Bored." You groan with half-studied emphasis, staring at the ceiling. John doesn't say anything, his even breathing the only thing being heard in the room. You toss and turn before you spare a glance at him, his back turned on you.
The day went by as usual, Sherlock didn't pay attention in classes while John tried to, Sherlock randomly asked him questions that John answered in a whisper and Sherlock mastered whatever they were supposed to do in the lessons pretty easily. Once the lessons were over however, they went back to the Great Hall to pick up a suspicious Hermione and an excited Harry. "What's your plan?", the Gryffindor girl asked almost immediately. "I want the two of you to go down to the lake and talk. Loudly. Maybe lie, talk about personal things. The kind of story the Daily Prophet would die for. If I'm right, I will cast a spell and you'll see how Rita Kimmkorn found out all these things about you." So they did just that. Hermione and Harry sat down by the lake and started a conversation while Sherlock and John hid in a nearby Bush. "Alright so what do you think?", John asked. "Animagus" John looked surprised. "An illegal animagus?" Sherlock nodded. "Cedric is so stupid", Hermione started. Harry looked very hurt but the apologising look Hermione gave him, made him understand that she wasn't telling the truth. "Oh you think my boyfriend is stupid? Well Viktor is even dumber! How he can keep himself on a broom, I don't know!" Hermione pretended to be shocked and continued: "Well there's only one person here that played in the Quidditch world Cup, and it certainly wasn't Cedric!" Then Harry continued: "Victor's team lost because he caught the snitch!"
John was looking at Sherlock over the edge of his cup. He was downing the pumpkin juice like his life depended on it. Molly was glancing at Sherlock too. And Sherlock was rambling off a few of his brilliant deductions again. "No, it's just the mud from the school grounds, but how could you have possibly gotten it onto your robes since the last time I saw you if you didn't meet up with Stella? You don't play Quidditch and it couldn't have been this morning, since the mud would've already been dry by then, remember it rained yesterday evening, not last night!" Mike nodded, a bit fascinated, a bit confused that this boy could tell his romantic walk with his girlfriend from the pattern of mud splashes on the hem of his robes. "So it couldn't have happened any differently. But anyways, how was the date?" Mike smiled with the bare thought of it. "Really nice. We walked alongside the lake and showed each other nice spots on the school grounds we hadn't before. And we ended up kissing before I brought her beck to her dorm." Sherlock did not make any unpleasant or uncalled for comments, just put on a straight face and nodded when Stamford was done. John soundlessly sighed in relief. He was beyond glad Sherlock and his other friends got along. They returned to their meals while Molly opened up about the dream she'd had the night before when the Hufflepuff Head of House, Pomona Sprout walked over to them from a few feet up the table. "Meeting at 4 o'clock this afternoon. For everyone in 4th grade and above it." She smiled and moved on to the next small group where she repeated the message. "The whole house from 4th grade up will meat later?", Molly said, confused. "It would seem so.", Sherlock deadpanned. John gave him a disapproving glance that told Sherlock 'Bit not good. A bit more sociable perhaps?' So Sherlock complied to the silent request. "No idea what for though, any theories?", Molly and Mike weren't sure and John suggested they'd simply find out by attending and dismissed himself and Sherlock.
'Finally', Sherlock thought, when their headmisstress lead them into the castle to prevent her students from dying of hypothermia. They passed some of the Hogwarts students on their way in and all their eyes were on them. Sherlock noticed a million things at one, like how many students were staring at him (7 out of the 32 students in that pack), who was popular (12/32), who was his age (8/32) and who would want to participate (26 of them, maybe 27). But then they passed the group and entered the British Wizarding School.
John was so lost in his thoughts, he didnt eat a single bite that night. He just stared onto his plate until Molly asked him: "Are you alright?" John nodded, trying to smile convincingly. Molly sighed in exasperation. "You're clearly not. What is it?" "Nothing!" His voice went up an octave. Molly shook her head. "Oh boy", she muttered. John now realized her hadnt eaten anything and, in a hurry to leave Molly and her questions for the night, downed a glass of pumpkin juice and a piece of quiche and fled from the Great Hall.
They found both Sherlock's and Irene's mother in the salon. "Sherlock!", she exclaimed happily as she saw him. They both stood up from the Chaiselongue to hug their children respectively. "Oh Irene, comment était l'école?", Adina asked her daughter. "C'était assez bien.",Irene responded. And Sherlocks mother: "Oh, Sherlock, tu a encore grandi, n'est-ce pas?" "Peut-être un peu. Maman, arrête tellement de toucher mes cheveux!", Sherlock pouted, concerned for the wellbeing of his hair. She smiled at him. "Faible Sherlock, toujours inquiet pour ses cheveux.", Irene mocked him. Sherlock shot her an annoyed stare. Which soon turned into a death stare as another voice was heard. "Il avait toujours été trés dramatique.", Mycroft smiled. "How's the diet?" His brother grinned nastily. "Very well, thank you for asking." "Liar", Sherlock added under his breath. Mycroft must've heard him though, as he now drew in a sharp breath.
"Sherlock", John started. "Listen, I was wondering..." Sherlock was all ears. "You..." John didn't know how to put it. Sherlock raised his eyebrows. "Are you dating Irene?" Now Sherlock was confused. "Irene?" John nodded. "You thought I was dating Irene?" John nodded again. "I'm gay.", he bluntly said. "Oh..." "And so is she." "Yeah..." "And she's also my cousin." "Wait what?" The two had stopped dancing, standing at the side of the dancefloor, staring at each other in disbelief. "Yes, why else would she be at the Holmes Manor?" "I thought she was your girlfriend." "Girlfriends aren't really my area, like I said." "But why did you tell me you were together?", John now asked. "I didn't?" "Yes, you did. At the library." Sherlock thought back to that day. "You asked me if she was my special friend. She's a friend. And she's special. And doesn't her status as my cousin qualify her as a special friend? You're a special friend." John blushed furiously. "No, i thought you meant a romantic..." Sherlock looked up to the sky. "I see." "Look, I'm sorry", John apologised. "No, it's me who should apologise, I didn't know what special implied." "I hope this doesn't make things awkward between us.", John now admitted. "So do I. Another dance?" John politely declined. So Sherlock shrugged and asked the next best person, a Gryffindor girl. "Oh, Viktor's getting me a drink. I'm sure he won't mind though." John on the other hand went back to his table. He was stunned. How wrong he'd been. Not even five minutes later he retired for the evening.
The restaurant was lovely. Cozy but not cramped. The owner seemed to know Victor and Sherlock, immediately waving them over to a two-person-table. Realising they were three people, he smoothly organised a third chair. The food was divine and the conversation was entertaining. Between the old friends, John felt a little left out, but Victor and Sherlock tried their best to include him into it. Meanwhile John did his best to hate Victor. But the man was charming and funny. And with the three of them sitting so casually together and laughing like they all knew each other, John could almost overlook their relationship. But in those moments where Victor nudged Sherlock in the side or shared a smile with him, John couldn't help but feel a glaringly hot anger rise up in his chest. John pretended not to know why he wanted to hate Victor. But deep down, he knew he was jealous.
But someone else got out of the car as well. It was a short man with blond hair and a black jacket. Sherlock and the man were talking to each other and laughing until the shorter man pulled the detective closer to kiss him. Sally gasped and grabbed onto Philips jacket. Her other hand covered her mouth. Sherlock then pulled away, telling the man something. The blonde man playfully blew an air kiss over to Sherlock, who made a show of catching it. The short man was laughing out loud at that. They waved each other goodbye. Sherlock turned around, the smile still lingering on his face. He then walked up into the building, not sparing Anderson or Donovan a glance as Lestrade ushered him in. Anderson walked into the middle of the street in an attempt to spot the man who had just kissed Sherlock Holmes. He disappeared into the St. Barts hospital. Donovan's mouth was still open.
" 'Morse Code too', yeah i know, i can do that myself." Now in a corridor, they turned towards the library. "Say something in German then" "Was soll ich denn sagen, John? Irgendwas bestimmtes oder soll ich einfach vor mich her labern?" John looked genuinely surprised. "Was, hast du mir nicht geglaubt?" "Sherlock, the language barrier", John reminded him. "Oh, desolée, tu ne compris pas?", Sherlock tried in French. John started laughing. "English, please!" "Pourquoi? C'est trop facile! " Now they were both laughing. "Okay stop it!" "Alright, alright!", Sherlock replied.
With exams crawling closer, John had asked Molly, Mike, Greg and Sherlock, who brought along Irene and her girlfriend, to study with him.  John enjoyed study groups, feeling that this way it was more fun and also more efficient. Sherlock hated it but stuck around for John's sake. As it turned out, everyone had their strengths. Molly had a talent for herbology and potions, Mike was quite good at care of magical creatures and John liked Defense against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration. The three of them were also trying to become healers. Greg on the other hand, had a talent for History of Magic and Defense. Irene was excellent at Astrology and Divination while Cho excelled at Arithmancy and runes. And Sherlock was good at, well, everything he was interested in.
"So this bloke i was talking about earlier, his name is Sherlock Holmes and he's a bit of a genius I think." "What, no way", Mike let out. "No, I swear! He knew about my father! And Harry! Just like that, he observed, or deduced it!" "That's insane.", Molly said then. "I know it is, but i spent the whole day with him and I think we could actually be friends" "I dont know John, but if you like him, maybe introduce him to us." "I dont like him. Like that i mean," Molly and Mike exchanged a quick look. The conversation ended soon enough as they all worked on homework seperately.
After their glorious dinner and a Doctor Who rewatch, John tended to Harry's nose again. He did so first thing when entering the flat, his quick hands creating a makeshift bandage for her nose. Now he was checking again. He would heal it with magic but it was sadly illegal for him to do outside of school. And Harry hated hospitals.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock checked out a book on potions on Johns name and John proposed to spend some time in the Hufflepuff common room. "There'll be people!" Sherlock spat out the last word like it was some sort off horrible disease threatening the nation. The corner of John's mouth twitched into a smile. "Or we could wrap ourselves up and spend some time at the lake, it's quiet there. And quite nice, I might add." Sherlock had nothing to say against that. They sat down by a tree and John did his homework while Sherlock read in his book. Once John finished, he found Sherlock to be looking at him. "You're staring at me." "Hm?"  "You were staring at me." "Does it bother you? I do that sometimes. I was thinking." John shook his head and directed his gaze toward the ground. "No, it's fine."
"How do you like it?" 'What?', John angrily thought. 'That you shagged my best mate? That you're wearing his dressing gown? That you're where I usually am, making tea? That you're with him and I...' "A little milk", John replied. Victor nodded and put the kettle on. John went back to his chair and flopped down, staring at the newspaper in ire. His eyes burnt holes into the article about the starshower of the century. "So when did you meet Sherlock?", Victor asked cheerfully. "Over a year ago." "He deduced everything about you right away didn't he?", Victor continued. "Yes", John curtly said. "Ah, I still remember when he first met me, it was such good fun." Victor seemed to reminisce about old times. "And have you met his brother yet?" "Sadly, yes", John scoffed. "Good ol' Mike. A nightmare isn't he?" John didn't reply. "Used to surveill me i think. Probably still does." Victor set the cup of tea down next to John on the small table and went on to sit down in Sherlocks chair. He curled up inside it and blew on his tea. John looked at Victor.
But the last day of the exams, once the horror was over, Irene and Cho were found sneaking out through the witch statue. Well, they were trying. "Dissindo?" "Dissendio?" "Ugh!" Irene and Cho were annoyed. Sherlock cut in smoothly: "Dissendium" Irene smiled a him thankfully. "Where are you going anyways?", John asked them. "Secret date at Hogsmeade. Don't you guys do that too?" John turned red immediately. "Err we-" but Cho cut him off: "Shit, steps!" And climbed in. Irene followed her suit and Sherlock tugged John along to escape Filch.
John opened the door and just about cried; his omega is standing in the hot, steaming shower and scrubbing at his skin.
"Right. Okay. See you in a few."
“Good, good.” John held his omega closer to him, feeling an overwhelming need to protect him. He closed his eyes and listened to the heartbeat of his pup and mate, but frowned when he heard a third heartbeat.
"Sherlock, are you alright?" John asked worriedly, pausing in the doorway. "
The fingering went on for a long while, he had actually started to forget about it.
The man pressed a rather violent thrust into the detective causing him to moan in discomfort. Unfortunately, this only pleased the man, "Oh, you want it! You pretty little whore!"
Sherlock closed his eyes, trying so hard to think back to it and...god he could still feel their hands on him...hear their voices and his own screams mixed in, no one around to help him or save him as they pinned him to the ground and marked him as their own. He let out a broken sob, shaking his head and clutching at john as he started to panic a little. "I can't...I can't John please..."
One fateful afternoon, on the 29th of January 2010, Mike brought his old friend John Watson into a laboratory at St Barts. He introduced him to Sherlock Holmes, a certified genius and obnoxious arsehole. But while others may see that and only that, John saw something else in the other man. So when he got back to his flat and found a text on his phone, he texted back.
"I still don't get why I have to be nice!", Sherlock pouted. John sighed, clearly having been through this already. "Look, they are my friends." "Yes, and they're alright. You three are nice enough for the four of us!" "Sherlock, just try to not be insensitive or mean, okay? I like them and I like you and I just want you to get along." Sherlock nodded amd they went on their way to the feet lesson. 'Did I phrase that wrong?', John wondered while Sherlock just thought: 'John... likes....me ?'
The four boys fell to the ground into a big, crushing ball of limbs. Sherlock was, unfortunately for him, on the bottom. Harry groaned while trying to get up from under Cedric. The two rose and helped up John and Sherlock as well. "Voldemort!", Sherlock simply explained. "Is this a graveyard?", Harry asked while Cedric simply said: "What?". "His followers have orchestrated the entire thing, we need to-", John tried to explain but Harry yelled "Wormtail!", at something behind them. And surely there was a small man approaching, holding a bundle of sheet in his arm. "Kill the spares", a voice rasped, but before the man could do anything, John disarmed him. The bundle was dropped to the ground as the man shrinked. The four students chased after the animagus. "He's a rat. Peter Pettigrew. Fought against him last year.", Harry attempted to explain. "Say what now?" Cedric clearly did not know this before. "Less explaining, more following!", Sherlock interrupted. Meanwhile, John was trying to immobilise the rat but it was too dark and the rat was too agile. Then another figure appeared. It was Jim and one of his fellow students. Sherlock remembered him as Sebastian. "On guard!", Jim joked and mercilessly attacked Sherlock. Sebastian tackled John and curses flew.
Sherlock was also aware of whenever John was looking at him. By now Sherlock was sure that John had realised Sherlock's infatuation with him.  Except that John never said anything about it. But John was nice, Sherlock figured. Too nice. Nice enough not to end their friendship over Sherlocks stupid feelings. And Sherlock was glad about it. John's companionship meant the world to Sherlock.
"And how did that work out for you?"
They collapsed onto the ground and the crowd went wild. Confused applauding ensued and everyone started cheering. John was the first to get up, nerves still buzzing from all the adrenaline. "You!", he snarled at Moody, who was approaching. Johns wand pressed into the fake aurors chest after he disarmed him. Moody gaped in shock but John was disarmed as well, by none other than Albus Dumbledore. Sherlock got up as well, leaving only Harry and Cedric on the ground, clutching to each other. "You have to arrest him." Dumbledore stared at them in disbelief. " He isn't Alastor Moody, he's an imposter." The crowd got quieter. "He helped in the resurrection of Voldemort!", Harry let out. Everyone turned towards him "What did you say?", Dumbledore asked calmly. "He's back", Cedric confirmed. Now not a sound was to be heard. "You know this how?" "We saw him", Harry said. "And so did we", John agreed. Sherlock nodded and turned back to where Moody stood. Except that he wasn't there anymore. "Moody!" Sherlock ran after him. John joined in. "Petrificus Totalus!" So that was taken care of.
Anderson and Donovan found out about John on another occasion. They were outside, catching a breath before going in again to take another look at the body. They looked down the street. A cab pulled up and halted before the hospital down the street. A man in a long, swishy coat left the car. "Freak's here", Donovan stated. Anderson sighed.
"Victor wants to come over later", Sherlock told him. John nodded and smiled, remembering him fondly. "I thought you didn't like him", Sherlock added. "No, I do." Sherlock frowned. "Yesterday morning you were clenching your jaw whenever he spoke and now you smile besottedly." John shrugged. Sherlock eyed him suspiciously but dropped it.
"You never told me you liked dancing", John stated. "It never came up." "I suppose you're right. But you really seem to like it." "Yeah, I do." Sherlock's tone was unreadable. "Just a bit surprised, that's all." "I must keep you on your toes in some ways. To keep things exciting", Sherlock told John, smiling at him. The streetlights were flickering in his eyes. And the crinkles around his mouth made John all fuzzy inside. After John almost let out a wistful sigh, he turned his attention back towards the street and they walked in comfortable silence. While crossing a road, Sherlock bumped into John sideways, the backs of their hands swiftly connecting. Sherlock wasn't wearing his gloves. The touch of his skin seemed to stay on John's hand, like a phantom touch.
The door closed again. Then Sherlock's hand released John's face. John breathed out. They moved under the sheets so that Sherlock wasn't pressing his full weight into John anymore. John didn't dare say anything.
He descended the stairs into the Hufflepuff common room and found Cedric Diggory, hopelessly trying to transfigurate some small object into a flower. "No, I don't want that, that's ghastly... a rose? too clichee. How about- no", the sixth year boy was murmuring. John approached carefully. "Everything alright?" "Trying to make a flower." "Trust me Ced, you're an ace at transfigurations, whatever it is, Cho will love it." Cedric looked at him in confusion but tried again. "Did you ask him, by the way?", Cedric asked after taking the unidentifiable flower into hand and walking towards the portrait entry. John stepped through. "Ask who?", he laughed. "Sherlock, of course." John laughed at that. Which made Cedric even more confused. "You're serious?" The champion nodded. "Sherlock is obviously going with his girlfriend." "Girlfriend?" "Yes, girlfriend. Who else would he be going with?" They were approaching the party, as the noises started to get louder. "Who is this girlfriend?" "Irene of course, I thought you knew!" Cedric stopped walking. "Irene is going out with Cho." John turned around. "What are you talking about, Cho is your date!" Cedric was now the one laughing. "What are YOU talking about, I asked Harry. Cho and Irene are dating and Sherlock and Irene are most definitely not a couple." Johns face suddendly flushed and Cedric laid an arm around his shoulder. "Hey, it's alright... oh wow." Then Cedric let go of his shoulder again because one Harry Potter was waiting in an emerald green cloak for him. "I'll see you later!", he called out to John.
The Beauxbatons boy was impressed by the library, calling it "gigantic" and "wonderful". While they wandered around, Sherlock found a book on untreatable poisons and John found out that Mary Morstan, his ex-girlfriend and fairly good friend, was now apparently dating somebody, as Madam Pince shooed her and someone else out of the library, exclaiming: "No kissing in the library! If you dont want to study or read, you can leave!"
After Sherlock had set his experiments aside to cool down and develop, they started talking about other things as well. "Who do you think will be champion?" "Well", Sherlock answered, deep in thought, "Beauxbatons it's clear. Fleur." John didnt know who he was talking about. "Is that the Black haired girl who said next to you yesterday?" "No, that's Irene. Fleur is a blonde. Her grandmother was a Veela I assume. I'd always found it rude to ask so I'm not sure but I think so." John nodded. "Can you point her out later at dinner?" Sherlock replied smugly: "I'm sure you'll see her well enough once she gets chosen." John laughed quietly. "Durmstrang? I say Krum" "And you would be totally right. Karkaroff favors him, the others don't have a chance compared to him and he's clearly strong-willed." "And what about Hogwarts?" Sherlock seemed go have to think about that. "I don't know... So far I know of only six people to have put their name in. Surely there must be more, but since I don't even know all the names I cant actually make a reasonable guess..." "Well there's Cedric Diggory. Sixth year... He's 17 and also in my house." "I'm guessing a friend of yours?" "Yeah..." "What other options are there? And who do you think will it be, you're the expert here." "I think Angelina from the Gryffindors put her name in and some Slytherin quidditch player too... But I'm hoping it's Cedric." They had been sitting there for quite a while. It was afternoon already. "Do you want to go into the Great Hall, you could try to find out by doing your observation thing." "It's called a deduction. And yes. But first I'd like to see your library."
John spent the rest of his winter break at Harry's. He borrowed her clothes, his bag at their parents house. He had fortunately not brought amy school equipment back home with him, just some clothes and the dogtags. John felt like these dogtags reminded him that his father had been a good man. He wore them with the image of a caring father in mind. It felt right to leave that behind.
The next morning neither of them mentioned it. Sherlock only offered John a soothing spell for his back. John declined. They went to the exam together. Irene smirked at them, knowing Sherlock had not returned to his bed that night. But the curly-haired boy didn't even bother correcting her. Meanwhile, John was very careful not to touch Sherlock. Last night had been a stupid mistake on his part. He didn't want Sherlock to think he fancied him, thereby ending their friendship. But Sherlock seemed to stick to him like glue. While John usually didn't mind Sherlock looking over shoulders, taking his hand to lead him somewhere or nudging his side to get his attention, that day he did.
Sherlock Holmes was shivering. Irene was huddled right beside him in an effort to share body heat as Sherlock was not allowed to light a fire in a flying vehicle with mostly wood as the material. Irene was cursing the situation out, it was 'cold as balls', according to her. Sherlock himself did not really swear at all but could agree with his cousin's statement. But thankfully, they were apparently approaching Hogwarts, since the teeth clappering of their classmates lessened and the joyous "Nous arrivons, finalement!" increased.
Sherlock had predicted all the scores correctly and John applauded in a really sly and sarcastic manner. Sherlock grinned at him widely and John decidedly didn't think about how adorable it looked. After the task, they parted ways. John wanted to congratulate Cedric on his clever idea and Sherlock was dragged to Fleurs celebration. Cedric was, albeit injured, insanely happy. And the Hufflepuffs, knowing where to sneak into the kitchen since they had some friends under the houseelves, had brought lots of food for a small party. He imagined the Gryffindors would celebrate even extremer but he enjoyed the party anyways. Molly, having had a couple butterbeers repeatedly asked him about the whereabouts of his friend Sherlock. Mike was off to see Stella. Because of his intellect he was welcome at the Ravenclaw tower and the couple pften hang out in the common room. "Molly, I think you've had enough", John told her after she started gushing about Sherlock again. "But where is heee???" John laughed. Molly had a crush on Sherlock. Not wanting to hurt Mollys feelings while she was intoxicated and very emotional, he simply replied "with the other French students!" That made enough sense for Molly to leave him alone. He liked her, he really did! But he couldnt handle talking, or even thinking about Sherlocks lovelife right now. John went into his chambers, party mood vanished. He felt a bit awful for not having spent that much time with Molly but tried to ignore the feeling. John soon fell into a restless sleep.
The next morning, in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Sherlock slipped John a note. "Alastor Moody, Ex-Auror. Responsible for Arresting about 60% of all deatheaters" It was crazy, John thought, how Sherlock just knew when to intervene and where to help. Sherlock surely noticed Johns lack of knowledge regarding famous wizards and it being accounted to Johns muggle home and upbringing. After John read the note, he eyed the Professor more attentively. Weirdly, Moody took a big gulp out of his flask right in the middle of class. But John forgot about it soon after.
After jogging through several floors, John halted at a statue of an old hag. "Let me find out how it opens", Sherlock excitedly said. He walked around the statue several times, eyes everywhere. John eyed him in wonder. Sherlock noticed but decided to act like he didn't. "The hump. That's where it opens. A password. Now that I can't know." "It's Dissendium.", John informed him. The hump immediately opened. "No Gunhilda, not now." It closed again. Sherlock smiled slightly. John returned it brightly. Then Sherlocks expression straightened. It was as if he was guarding himself. But John was planning on breaking through those walls. "Umm, may I ask where your potioneering facilities are located?" "The dungeons. It's near the Slytherin dormitories." "Lead the way then."
But it all got revealed to John once they left the last class. Because Sherlock dragged him by the robes into the Hufflepuff common room and started jinxing the fireplace. "What are you doing?" "Demolishing this enough so this part of the floo network won't show up in the ministry's tracking." Johns eyebrows furrowed. "Where are we going?" Sherlock gave him his 'isn't-it-obvious?' look. "Crime scene".
