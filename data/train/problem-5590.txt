"What's up kid?" Her voice was gentle despite her demeaner. God, this is hard. I gulp and look her in the eyes. Blue meeting green.
"Let's make a deal; you tell us what your dream was about and will kick Clint out and you can come and sleep with me. Deal?"
"Guys, lay off. Tyler just wanted a change. Leave her be." Tony wraps his arm around my shoulder as I nod numbly. Everyone starts apologising before Papa suggests that we start making a move. I've never been more thankful for his war training. We pile inside of the limo leaving me sandwiched between Nat and Loki. My leg begins to bounce with anxiety so Natasha places her hand on my knee gently.
"Hey Underoo's. What's up?" Peter shuffles into the open space nervously, not taking his eyes off of the floor. He scratches the back of his neck.
"Have fun in Vegas guys. Don't go too mental, we need money to eat." Mom and Dad were going to Las Vegas on their honeymoon and Me and Peter decided not to go because neither of us are old enough to drink so Clint and Natasha offered to take us in for the week and even said that Ned and MJ could stay over. Mom kisses my head.
"Stark get out." When he doesn't move she starts yelling at him to leave. I start counting to 10 in my head, desperate to get rid of the dark feeling that was quickly consuming me. It didn't work. The last thing I hear is Wanda yelling my name then everything went dark.
That's how the three of us ended up sitting crossed legged on Nat and Clint's bed, resting against the headboard. Her slim arm resting on my shoulder and his hand holding mine. I try to keep my breathing under control as I tell them about my night terror.
By the time we'd got back to the living room, just like Nat had predicted, everyone was there. Wanda and Vision were talking to Bruce, Dad was chatting with Pete and his girlfriend, MJ, Clint and Sam were winding up Bucky and Thor was talking to Loki and Papa. There was one person missing, Wade. 'He told me he'd be here.' And just as that thought entered my head, the elevator door opened.
"Tyler Stark-Roger, Level 10. Welcome back Tyler. Boss wishes for me to inform you to look out as Mr Barton knows about this trip."
"Is it okay?" I just nod. She smiles. "I'm glad now come on. Let's go watch over the man child before he hurts himself."
"Wanna go and see what's next door?" I ask playfully. She nods. I offer her my hand and she takes it warily, allowing me to gently pull her to the dark oak door. I gesture towards it.
"And then this kid started picking on me and Tyler got in his face and was all like 'Don't pick on my brother punk!' and he went like 'Whoa. I'm falling now because I tried to hit the shadow!' and then he walked away really embarrassed and we were all like 'OMG Ty, you just made him fall over.' And then she was all like 'I did nothing. The punk fell over.'"
"Well, okay then, looks like you're finding out more than them. I lived with this couple for around 7 months, they were fine to begin with, nice and patient. One day they snapped, they started getting payed for taking me in, the social were now off their backs with the weekly check-ups, I had no one to save me. On the last night with them, the neighbour had come round to the house in the day, saying that she was concerned about me and that she would call the police. He got angry, started drinking, smoking weed. He filled the bath tub with water, put a blindfold on me and another one in my mouth. He held me under water. I was 4 years old. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't scream. I was defenceless. Police came in and arrested them. They're both behind bars but that doesn't erase the memories. The emotional scars. I'm stuck with them." I look up at the adults with bleary eyes. Clint looked heartbroken and mad and Natasha? Natasha looked like she was going to murder somebody. Her arm tightens around me as she pulls me onto her lap, holding me close to her, almost as if she was afraid I was going to disappear.
"I umm, put it in there. I thought you might like it but if you-" I cut off his rambling by throwing my arms around his neck.
We arrive at one of my Mom's favourite restaurants, it's pretty fancy but me and Pete are used to that scene by now. My salad comes and we all begin eating, lightly conversing with the staff and each other. Dad orders another round of drinks for all of us, champagne for him and mom and strawberry basil lemonade for me and Peter, after we finish with our food and he strikes up a conversation.
Me and Nat laugh at him as we bob up and down to the rhythm of the music, singing along with the chorus of thugs.
Well that’s it. Thanks to everyone who read this. And I’m wondering if I should do a sequel or not. What do you think? I love you 3000.
"All right children, on the bus." Everyone piled onto the cliché yellow school bus and tried to find seats near their friends. Ned and MJ sat together while me Peter and Wade sat in the back.
"Very Well sir. They have all been notified and are on their way." Clint starts leading me out of my room and onto the common floor. I plant my heels into the ground just like a toddler.
"Hey, I'm the best man for some reason. No. No. I'm kidding. What can I say about my dad that he won't kill me in my sleep for later? There's quite a lot actually. My dad is a mechanic. He builds things. He invents things and he told me one night when we was drunk a few weeks ago that his favourite and greatest invention was this family. And he was right. My dad built this family. None of this would've happened without him. All of got to say to my mom is, good luck." Chuckles bounce around the room throughout his speech. "I'm going to pass you over to the maid of honour now so please give it up for my little sister, Tyler." I grab the mic off my brother.
"They need structure Tony." Tony didn't argue and he started mumbling under his breath. Steve smiled at us.
We finish up and everyone is staring at us, mouth agape. I mean it's not every day you hear the 'Emo kids' sing but still. It's a music class, what do they expect?
"Happy birthday loser." MJ says. I manage to get out of Wade's clutches long enough to give MJ a short hug and accept the gift that she was handing to me. Ned was holding one as well. I shook my head.
"Penthouse please Jarvis." The AI doesn't respond but the elevator starts climbing upwards. It arrives the floor and the doors Bing open, allowing us to step through. Wade trails behind me like a lost Puppy as I open my bedroom door, gesturing him inside.
"Thank you everyone for coming tonight. It's such a special occasion for us and we're so happy to be able to share this special day with you all. So please, enjoy yourselves. Free bar so get drunk and yeah, have a good time." I sit back down at the table in between my dad and my new wife, MJ.
"Hey Pete." He takes a seat on the grass beside me, leaning back so he's lying down. I join him, looking at the clouds, analysing the different shapes that they make.
Time went quickly. Sean ordered pizza for dinner so mom could spend more time with me without having to worry about cooking. And soon enough, it was 10 at night. All the kids were asleep so it was me, mom and Sean sat around the living room watching Paranormal Activity 3. It got the peak of the movie when mom's phone went off causing us all to jump out of our skin.
"I am so, so sorry my little Song. I hurt you so bad and I can see it now. Please just give me a chance to prove to you that I will never hurt you again." I look away and shift uncomfortably. The judge notices.
"Good morning Tyler. Sleep well?" When he asks that question, Tony turns around and smiles at me as well. I smile in return before remembering I was asked a question.
"I know you did Angel. Thank you." He puts the plates in the sink and turns back to face us. "Tones, do you want to show the kids their suits? You know, before someone falls asleep again." I glare playfully at him before looking at Tony with begging eyes. I can see Pete doing the same out of the corner of my eye and he finally cracks.
"As much as I'd love that. I need to get out of the tower. Social interaction is good for my anxiety. At least that what my therapist said." I rest my head on his shoulder. "Plus, I can't let Pete suffer the questions along. What sort of a sister would that make me?" He chuckles and kisses my head.
"Thanks dad." I kiss his cheek picking up my phone. "I'll unpack later." I promise as I walk out of the room.
"No I didn't get in a fight. He was holding on to Peter, I pulled him off, told him not to hurt my brother, he went in for a punch, I dodged it, he fell onto a table. Technically it was his fault."
"'T's open." Without missing a beat, the door was pulled open a smidge and the witch stepped through.
"I know baby. I'm sorry. It's just been so crazy. Why don't you come round one day. I really want them to meet you."
"This place is amazing." Blake says, holding onto MJ's hand, gawking up at the house. I chuckle at her reaction.
"Our song babe. Everyday. You get the guitar and I'll fire up the piano." I do just that as I stand up to retrieve a guitar from the stands in the middle of the room. I grab my favourite and sit back down in my chair, quickly tuning it before strumming a familiar tune. Wade joining in with the piano when necessary before I start up with the vocals.
"You ready?" He asks simply. Instead of replying, I grab my phone and shove it in my back pocket, walking towards my brother and closing the door softly behind me.
"Did you take your meds today?" Mom asks out of nowhere. Dad turns to face me with an eyebrow raised. My leg begins to shake under the table.
"Nothing. Nothing Tyler, we just haven't heard you laugh before and it's beautiful." I hide my face behind my hair as Steve clears his throat.
"Too late for that." I chip in as I sit up, rubbing my eyes. Natasha smacks Clint and they start signing vigorously to each other. Nat turns to me and smiles.
"You saw that then." I nod. "He didn't mean it Tyler, he was angry, I said things he didn't like. It just got a little heated."
"Okay, Love you." I call as he shuts the door. I pull off the remainder of my wet clothes and step under the spray of the water. I spend little time washing my hair and even less my body. I did only have half an hour to get ready after all. Using the towel to dry my hair, choosing an outfit is proving to be a hard task.
I zone out for most to the case. In my defence, my mind was on other things. Like the fact that my mother, a woman I haven't seen in over 10 years is sitting less than 5 feet away from me. And the thought of having to go back to her. The judge gains my attention when he calls my mom up to the stand. I take my time to study her as she sits there. She looks different. More matured. Her blonde hair was no longer dyed crazy colours, her facial piercing had gone along with the tattoos on her hands, her posture had changed and her bright green eyes were no longer bloodshot or glazed over form the booze she had just consumed. I barely recognised her.
"You know me Lils. What's the point of living if you don't do it on the edge." She yet again rolls her eyes at my comment but doesn't say anything. Wise woman.
"Your honour, when she was taken from me, I wasn't in the right state of mind. Melod- Tyler's father had been murdered with promises to be back soon when he left, I was off my medication so I went out looking for him, believing he was still alive somewhere. I was in no fit state to raise a child. She needed better. She needed looking after. But now, I'm a changed woman. I went and got help I needed. I found a man who helps me so much and we have a beautiful family. I just wish that I could do right by that little girl I hurt all those years ago." She looks at me, tears gathering in her eyes.
"That's enough Clint. You've said your peace now go back to your nest and let us look after our daughter." My head finds it's way into Nat's shoulder as my small shoulders start to shake.
"I second that opinion. Don't worry, we'll come with you if you want." She sooths my hair flat. I nod and yawn, closing my eyes, laying my head on her shoulder again.
"You'll be fine baby." I lean back onto the merc's chest, enjoying the warmth I found there. We spend the next 2 hours or so conversing with the other Avengers. Wanda already claimed that she was my Aunt as well as Natasha, Bruce and Thor claimed the Uncle positions along with Sam and Clint. And Loki, well Loki told me he could be whatever I want whenever I needed. His exact words were: "If you need a mother's touch that's exactly what I'll be. If you need the guidance of an older sister, or an older brother to beat up the bullies, I'll be there. If you need a furry friend to help you fall asleep. Or if you just need comfort, I'll always be here for you." It was strange but oddly comforting, not that I'd ever admit that to him.
"Hey, are you going to that conference with Pepper?" Since the we had met the CEO of Stark industries the Saturday before she hired us as interns as she saw a lot of potential in us. We all know that the three of them (Pepper, Tony and Steve) are hoping that one day me, Peter and MJ will take over the company. Pete taking over Tony's job, MJ becoming the new Pepper and me, I'd be both. The secondary CEO and also designer.
"Tyler? Is something wrong? You've barely touched your food. Do you not like it? I can make you something else if you'd like."
"Oh. This is my jam." We all start singing to Cherry Pie by Warrant, head banging and screaming out the lyrics. Dad pulls the sports car up outside of a large gate, scanning a badge looking type thing on the side.
"Gross." We break apart to the sound of my brother being an actual 5 year old. I slap him around the back of the head and join hands with my girl.
"Shit." I jump out of bed and head straight to the bathroom, sorting my, stuff, out, grabbing my toothbrush, hairbrush and extra pads. Shoving them into my worn-out converse backpack along with a spare t shirt, leggings, fuzzy socks and my Hawkeye pyjamas because apparently they have those. I put my phone in my pocket and carry my stuffed tiger, who I've named Lily if anybody's interested. Like Tiger-Lily from Peter Pan. Yeah? No? Anyway. I yank the bag onto my back and carry it through the halls, throwing it down on the island and pulling on my Black Widow converse, because they have those as well. Who knew. Tony walks in with two empty mugs.
"It's fine." I cut him off. "We have our own." I take out my lanyard and put it around my neck. It's black with 'TIGER' printed on the back and a picture of me and Peter pulling a stupid face as my facial recognition. Peter's is red and blue with a spiderweb pattern with 'UNDEROO'S' printed on the back. MJ's is normal but she's getting her personalised one within the next week. Ned and Wade's are just regular because they don't use them that much.
"Coming Mom!" I yell down the stairs, stuffing my feet inside of my sneakers and grabbing my phone before sliding down the banister of the stairs. Mom shakes her head at me, pushing her phone into the clutch she was holding.
"Hey everyone, I'm Peter. Peter Stark and most of you probably know that I'm Tyler's older brother. I've known Tyler for 18 and a half years and I've never seen her as happy and as content as when she looks at MJ. MJ you fixed my little sister and I owe you everything for that, you make her so happy and I can see that she makes you happy but you must know, hurt her and you'll have the whole Avengers on your door step."
"Kids, this is Dr Bruce Banner and this is Natasha. Guys these are the two terrors we adopted: Peter and Tyler." They waved at us so we waved back, the atmosphere awkward as nobody knew what to say. Tony clapped his hands.
"Aren't you like some super smart technical genius? And you've let a coffee maker beat you? What has this world come to?" I throw my arms up in the air for dramatic effect as he chuckles.
"No Ty no. Not again." I can't look at him. I know the face. The face of pity mixed with disappointment. I've seen it too many times in my 14 years. He slowly pushes my sleeves up and lets out a breath of relief.
"Neither can I but hey, you managed to sweep me off my feet until you know, were gay." MJ comes over to us and wraps her arms around my shoulder.
Unfortunately, that doesn't happen. I walked into the kitchen after getting dressed for the day to see Steve standing there with his arms crossed. I mirror his expression.
"Tyler!!!! I swear to God woman get your ass down here now. We're going to be late!" I roll my eyes at my wife's behaviour.
"So, when did you know?" Nat asks awkwardly picking at her fries. I swallow my mouthful of cheeseburger and think for a while.
"We shoot him in zie legs because his shield is zie size of a dinner plate." We repeat to him before high fiving.
"I thought you might say that. I'm going to call your dad's in so we can talk this over properly. And because you're still under 16, you can't really make the decision. We have to make it in your best interest."
"I'll watch Lex, you go show Blake her room." I smile at the woman and push passed her gently, nudging Blake's shoulder with my own.
"I'm sorry прекрасный but I've got to go. I'll come and get you tomorrow yeah?" I nod and walk her to the elevator waving her and Clint goodbye.
"Tyler Stark-Rogers?" Her eyebrow raised when she said my last name. of course they got my last name changed at school. Why wouldn't they?
"What's wrong Joshie?" I ask, my tone soft. He wraps his arms around my neck and mumbles about there being too many people. I sigh and stand up with the boy still my arms. This kid is about the only one I can stand in this place. I look at Peter and he just shrugs. I set Josh on his feet.
"I wanted to help as much as I could. I could throw millions of dollars at this place but I know it'll just end up in Conrad's pocket so, me and my wife made the decision to adopt from here to make sure nobody has to go through what I did. And we chose you two." Before I can fully process what's happening, a pair of arms are thrown around my neck, my shoulder getting slightly damp from tears.
"Let's go." I say swinging the bag onto my shoulder and walking passed the two adults on the way out of the room. I didn't get very far before my head began to spin again.
"Sorry Ty, you just got back?" I nod timidly. "Okay well why don't we head to bed? Get some rest. We'll talk in the morning." I nod yet again and follow Steve into my room he sits on my bed as I go into the bathroom to change. 'I'll shower in the morning' I think as I pull on my shorts and tank top, my blonde hair still magically secured in the messy bum I put it in earlier. I walk back towards my dad who stands with a smile, pulling back the comforter for me and bringing up to me neck once I was safely inside. He kisses my forehead and passes me my tiger.
"No Pete a little more to the left. Down perfect." It's finally the day. Today is our 1 year adopt-aiversary. I still don't know where Papa got the name from but it's stuck. Me and Peter are currently hanging up a banner (no not Bruce) above the stage area. We made it ourselves, with a little help from a certain metal armed assassin. Peter climbs down the ladder and stands next to me, his arm going around my shoulder.
"Umm, I can't read English." My mouth forms an 'O' shape and I take the paper back, smoothing it out across my leg before reading out loud.
I look up at Steve speechless. I couldn't keep to half of these. I shift my gaze to Tony to see him sat there with his head in his hands. I clear my throat.
"Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what I told myself the first time Harleen hit me. We both know it's not true though don't we. All that matters now is that we're safe and that we've got each other right?"
The week couldn't have gone slower if it tried. But it's finally Friday and the room is literally buzzing with excitement.
"Not on the suit." He jokes lightly before wrapping his arm around me, pulling me into his side. "Everything is going to be fine okay Ty, I promise." I sigh sadly.
"Did you know that they changed your name?" He asked. I shake my head, resting it on my arms on the table. The class flew surprisingly quickly and before I knew it I was walking out of the door heading into my next class, music. Even though Midtown is a science and technology school, you have to pick one arts subject for creativity so I naturally chose music along with Wade whilst the Pete and MJ chose Art and Ned chose drama. I sit in my normal seat which is next to my boyfriend and right in front of the door. Mr Warren begins to talk about something but I just drown him out, staring at the keyboard, thinking of all the melodies I could be playing right now instead of listening to him.
"Hello? Tyler? You with us kiddo." I roll my eyes as I mark my place, setting the book down, turning my attention to my dinner. A bowl of pasta with cheese and tomato sauce is placed in front of me. Steve looks at me apologetically even though I know he's not the slightest bit sorry.
"Hey guys." I say giving a little wave as I put in my combination, opening the metal door my eyes instantly drifting to the picture on the inside. The one of Peter, Aunt May, Uncle Ben and I at the beach. All smiles. So happy. If only they could see me now. I'm broken out of my trance by the bell ringing signalling the start of first period. I groan. Math. I hate math with a burning passion. Luckily, I have Wade and MJ in that class so it's not total torture. The three of us share the mutual look of 'kill me now' as we start to walk to the classroom. The teacher, Miss Jones, was stood at the door greeting every student with her fake-ass smile. Once everyone was sat in their seats she moved to the front of the call and began to check the attendance.
The drive to the mall was long, hot but far from boring. We sang to random pop songs on the radio, played never have I ever and just talked about random stuff ranging from school to embarrassing things Pete's done over the years. Nat parks up and we jump out, walking arm in arm around the centre.
"Yup. What you got for us?" He hands us a book and we start to flick through. MJ's finger stops on a certain song and I nod at her.
"Umm mine's pretty basic really. Both parents died when I was young. I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle but my umm, uncle was murdered and a year later my aunt killed herself and I've been here ever since." Sympathetic glances were sent his way. I didn't bother, I knew he hated them.
"Hey Lex," she looks up at us with her shining blue eyes. "Would you like to come home with us?" I ask softly.
"Is he okay? Or do I need to call somebody?" He asks looking between me, Peter and his, partner? Hey, I'm not judging. I sigh.
"No, I know what it's like in there and if I could take every single one of them out of that situation I could, even if I can just take one or two it'll make me sleep better at night. So, are you sure we're ready for this?"
"Of course I will. I'll see you later baby. Everything will be fine. I love you." And with that, he climbs out of the window. Running my fingers through my damp hair I stare at myself in the mirror. My eyes drawn straight to the scars covering my sides and upper thighs. The ones on my back seem to stand out more today. I close my eyes as I hear the sound of the belt cutting through the air before making contact with skin. I shake my head to clear it as I begin getting dressed. Once I am finished, I glance at myself in the mirror. 'Not too bad.' I think. The fitted white shirt is a little loose now but with the help of a belt it fit fine, I found some smart trousers that looked like jeans but weren't jeans if you get what I mean along with a black tie which hung loosely around my neck and Steve's worn leather jacket I love so much. It was the first time I'd looked in a mirror in a while. My cheek bones were more prominent and so was my jaw line, my cheeks had sunken slightly and my eyes weren't bright anymore. My once fluffy, vibrant blonde hair lay limp over my head. I glance over to my desk then back at the mirror, nodding slightly to myself.
"Coffee?" She asks. I nod and before I could even blink, it was sat in front of me, exactly how I liked it. I didn't tell her.
"I'm Trans. I was born a girl but now I'm a boy. Me and Tyler are the same people you met today and last week. This doesn't change who we are. I hope you can see that." Yet again, silence takes over. I don't look up as I hear the sound of a chair scraping on the floor.
"Mommy told me to come and save you." She says to dad, crawling on his lap. He picks her up and sets her on his knees, hugging her close.
"I'm Peter Parker and this is Tyler-Kai Quinzel. We're both massive fans of your work as you can tell." Both men smile.
"You guys should get going. Happy's waiting." Dad says not looking up from his Stark Pad. We hug each of them, saying our goodbyes before heading out the door and jumping into the back of the blue Audi parked out front. Hell here we come.
He's got a dream he's got a dream. Clint starts up again, standing on the sofa, making it overly dramatic.
"No but parents never are." I undo my seat belt and jump out of the car, staring up at the building that makes me feel 10 years old all over again. I interlock mine and MJ's fingers and we trudge up to the front door, ringing the bell firmly. The door is thrown open not a minute later by a girl who looked to be about 16 give or take.
"Of course Miss." I stand in front of the mirror. Why now? This is great. Just great. I hear a knock on the door.
"We can kill 10 minutes." He says calmly, wrapping his arm around her bony shoulders. Tyler nods her head in defeat and leans on her older brother, closing her eyes and savouring these blissful moments before they go back and the torture begins.
"Yeah one second." I yell back, taking one last glance around my room before grabbing my final suitcase and carry on and heading out, not looking back.
"Fine but you're driving." I shoot back, handing my older brother the keys to the Ford. We make our way out of the lab, making sure it's locked behind us and head towards the lobby. MJ is already there and waiting by the time the elevator doors open, not paying attention to her surroundings, eyes focused solely on her phone. We walk over to her and before I can get a word in, Peter is snatching her phone putting it in his back pocket.
"Gosh kid, we've got to get you some more clothes. You've barely got anything." His voice echoes throughout the room. He returns a few moments later with my Captain America shirt in his hands, a goofy smile on his face.
"Fuck. I can't do this Pete. They're going to kick me out. I can see it already." It's currently 2 hours before any of the guests start showing up and I'm pacing a hole through my brother's bedroom carpet.
"Ha! I knew Penis and Scarry were lying!! You wouldn't be able to get a job here if you both offered to suck him off." I looked at Flash, my eyes deadly again.
"Calling Boss and Mr Rogers." Jarvis announces. Clint and Bucky are too in shock to say anything. I can feel Natasha's tears soaking my hair but right now I don't care. She's here now.
"Yeah. I uh, saw Steve and Bucky." Both of my parents look at me, waiting for further explanation. "My powers glitched out earlier and I was in this old apartment, looked like no one lived there. Before I got to look around I came back. They glitched again and I was back there, had a little fight with the pair of them because I was in their house and they were attacking me. We talked a little and then I came back." I told them. Pepper rests her hand against my forehead.
"Actually, Mr Stark, while you're here, do you mind helping us with something?" Pete asks shyly, not wanting to overstep any boundaries. But all Tony did was smile.
"I know. I'll ask dad if we can meet her at the weekend, you'll be invited don't worry." I get a smile as we go in our different directions.
Everyone jumps off the bus, still chatting excitedly. An intern comes running up to us with a clip board and a box.
"Okay." I pull her in for a hug, not letting go until the hour session was up. In the end I was prescribed: Antidepressants, sleeping pills, pills to make me hungry so I eat and some weird herbal remedy shit to calm me down. God I hope this shit works.
"It's open." My voice rough and hoarse having not being used in a while. I don't turn to face the door, knowing it's probably Loki, he's the only one that comes in now days anyway.                 "Hey Little bird." I spin around in shock, my hands going to my mouth as I all but fall out of my chair, racing towards the man I've not seen in 2 weeks. I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist as he straightens up. Him and Nat had been on a mission that had allowed no contact as to not give their location away. His arms wrap around my back and he holds
"I am sorry my lady. I did not mean to startle you." He places a small kiss to my wrapped knuckles. 'what the?' I think. Looking at Steve and he seems to take the hint, making a bs excuse as to why we had to leave. I pick up my water and the assassin grabs my arm lightly, it still hurts but not as much as before.
"That's Stark-Rogers thank you very much. Now as I was saying. Nat has said that she would be happy to do some light sparring with you every weekend and teach you some stuff along the way. The gym is always open but no lifting without anyone spotting you and just don't go overboard yeah kiddo?" My smile widens.
"You only live once." I dry out my hair quickly, brushing it through with the detangler that Nat gave to me before picking up the scissors and facing my reflection once more. I grab a chunk of hair, sizing it up before snapping the blades together, watching as the loose ends fall to the floor. I continue cutting till it's the same length the whole way around my head. Brushing it through again and cutting off any stray hairs. It came to just above my shoulder. 'Passible.' Before I even have chance to move, my bedroom door swings open and Tony walks through.
"No not at all it's just, Lexington comes with an older sister and you know the system isn't supposed to split siblings up." I look over at my wife who just nods with a smile.
"Fucking ties." I mumble under my breath, leaving it and deciding I'll make Nat do it later on. I do up the waistcoat and slide my arms through the jacket, slipping on my black dress shoes at the same time. I walk out of my room, still messing with the tie. All of the other bridesmaids gasp when they see me.
"No, he's got work, said he'd stop by later though." Before the brown haired teenager could reply, Steve places a plate in front of us both. A waffle with a berry face. I look up at him with a smirk.
"Hey guys, mind if we join you?" I look up to see my brother and his girlfriend at the door. I nod and they enter, sitting on the floor.
Once the movie is over Jarvis announces that dinner is ready so the three of us make our way down to the common floor where the massive table is. When we arrive, Steve and Tony were standing waiting, arms crossed looking pretty pissed.
"Umm guys." Pete's voice breaks through the room. I look over to where the sound came from. He's stuck. On the fucking ceiling.
"Wear something nice he said. No skinny jeans he said." As I flick through the different articles of clothing Jarvis speaks up.
"Yeah, please." We walk in and start flicking through endless rows of sale items and I somehow find myself in the men's section, staring at the rows of boxers and flannel shirts. I feel Nat's hand on my shoulder and I move away embarrassed.
"NOO!!! MY TWLER. MINE!!!!" We all share a laugh at the youngest girls expense and I lean over to kiss her cheek.
"I try." We spend the next hour or so just talking about everything. Getting caught back up in each other's lives.
"Nat said she'll be here around 4. It's 10 now so you've got some time. How about some drawing before you go? Or I noticed the guitar, maybe you can show me what you can do. Some Papa-Angel bonding time. Your dad and Pete have gone out and Bucky will be asleep for a while. So what do you say?" Steve begins to ramble and I can't stop the smile from creeping onto my face.
"Please welcome, opening the stage, the Shadow and the Stars." We walk onto the stage and get in position sharing glances with each other. I can't believe I'm doing this. The intro music starts and I silently count down in my head.
I sit in tone of the chairs facing the water, reading through a revision book for an exam I've got tomorrow. I know all of this stuff and more but I'm just worried. Fuck anxiety.
"And then there's Tyler. What can we say about her? Well, she's a butthead, an aggressive little pixie and a pain in my ass. No. I'm just kidding. Tyler is one of the best kids I know, along with her brother. She's such a strong, independent, caring young lady. I am blessed to have ever met her. Me and her have some of the deepest conversations at 2 in the morning when neither of us can sleep. And I'm telling you that that girl has survived more than any grown adult could have and she came out smiling. She's an inspiration to me and to everyone she meets. She has this way about her that just makes you fall in love with her smile, so you'll do everything you can to see it again. We love you Tiger. Always." Another round of applause. I wipe my eyes and run up to my dad's, Peter not far behind me. We have a big family hug and everyone starts cheering. Now it's time for our speeches. Peter goes first because he's the oldest so me and dad's stand off to the side listening intently.
"So what do you guys want?" Steve asks looking up from his menu. Me and Pete share a glance of 'wtf' before turning to look at our Papa.
"Morg, go get Daddy for me please." She runs off without a word, Dad and Peter joining my side not side not 3 minutes later. The car rolls to a stop in front of us, the doors opening agonizingly slow. Steve steps out, followed by Bucky and Natasha. The three of us get into a more defensive position, ready for a fight if it comes to it.
"We get you kid, but you need to stop working yourself up. You're pushing yourself too hard. You'll end up falling asleep in your exams." I sigh running my hands down my face.
"Hey beautiful." Her and dad share a quick kiss before she pulls away, leaning over to give me and my brother a kiss on the head.
"I'll tell you what, why don't we make a deal? You continue on your medication until after your finals then we'll take you to a therapist to see if you need it anymore." I nod.
"Oh hello James. It's nice to see you too. I'm fine thanks for asking. Yourself?" The sarcasm dripping from my voice was borderline comical. I take a seat in the black bean bag in front of the professional man. He re-adjusts his glasses before sighing.
"I know but, I want to do it you know? Prove that I didn't get the job because you're my parents. I want something to show for all my work."
"Hey, little bird, calm down. Everything is okay. You're okay. I'm okay. Tasha's okay. Everyone is okay." His calming words didn't help as I continued to internally freak out.
"Let me grab a shower then I'll get my guitar." Without another word, I head towards my room. I can practically feel his happiness radiating from him.
"God, that wasn't supposed to happen. Sorry kids, I'll call the school in the morning, make them change it."
"'K." She turns her attention to the picture she was drawing. Me and MJ go to the corner Lexie was sat in.
"But seriously girl," Nat starts, sitting up, "21 and running one of the biggest companies in America. How do you do it?"
"Those two men saved my life. I owe them my life for that. I love them so much. Thank you. All of you. Really." I turn away and hear the cheers and applause. I run into my dads' arms, crying into their shoulders.
"Stay safe kiddo. Don't be too long, we've got things to do today." I salute and head down the stairs to the gym. It was more crowded. I recognised a few of them; Thor and Steve were having a weight lifting competition, Natasha and Clint were sparring, Wanda was on one of the treadmills and vision was doing sit ups whilst reading a book. Nobody noticed me enter so I slipped off to the back room where the punch bags are. Taking precautions this time, wrapping my wrists and knuckles in tape before laying my assault onto the sand filled bag. My grunts fill the small area. I'm not really sure how long I'm going for but, yet again, I manage to knock the bag down, instead of crying this time though, I do a simple aerial over to get another one. I pick it up and hold it over my shoulder. Turning around to see most of the Avengers looking at me, shock written all over their faces. I glare.
"I'll come find you later." I promise as I allow my dad to pull me away. The next song which just so happens to be 'Butterfly fly away' comes on and we start dancing slightly. I see Pete and Mom dancing over my shoulder and realise that it must be the daddy/daughter dance.
"Well, I'm never one to shrink from an honest challenge. It's physics." He explains as he grips the handle. He, much like Clint, tries and fails.
"Yes honey, that's your sister." No more words were said as the young girl wraps her tiny arms around my neck. I hesitantly wrap mine around her back and wait until she pulls away. Once she does I stand up straight, opening my arms for my mom. She gladly accepts my hug.
We make our way downstairs and are slightly amused at the scene in front of us; the youngest children sat down at the table, breakfast all over their faces. Other children running around like headless chickens, tidying up and putting up banners and balloons for any potential parents to see. We, the two and only teens in this place, jump down the rest of the stairs and grab a slice of toast each. Conrad comes over to us, rolling her eyes.
"What the hell is your problem?" I ask Natasha once we're in the car. She sighs, closing her eyes and gripping the wheel.
"Jarvis mute." I pull my phone out and follow the directions. The music room was on the common floor which was handy, nobody slept on that floor. I sit myself down at the grand piano, my fingers tracing lightly over the ivory keys. I begin to press down making small sounds escape the instrument. A familiar melody fills my ears. My hands knowing exactly which keys to press with o hesitation. Aunt May taught me to play this when I was young. How could I forget? I play through the intro and start singing the verse.
decided: Tony was Dad and Steve was Papa. It felt right. My head continues to swirl as I close my eyes, allowing my exhaustion to take over.
"Now you may leave." The rush was even worse than usual, everyone was excited about the trip. Me, Peter and Ned meet up with MJ on our way to our lockers. Wade wasn't in today he was.. Busy with his 'job'. Ned and Peter were talking about the trip the whole way.
"Yeah, yeah it was bud." He turns to me. "You should hit the shower because, no offence, but you stink." He wrinkles his nose in disgust and I playfully push his shoulder, pouting before retreating to my room to do just that. I reach my bedroom and enter the bathroom, shedding my jacket and ripped tape in the process. I kick off my shoes and pull off my bra and legging, placing both items of clothing in the clothes hamper in the corner. I open the shower door and look around the spacious cubical. Racks on the wall were filled with different kinds of shampoo's and body washes but no controls. I step inside, my bare feet hitting the cold tiles, studying the walls. A voice broke through the silence.
"Thought you'd like it, come on." I pull her straight towards the Queen t shirts and pick up one that I like, putting straight back down once I see the price but Nat picks it back up again, waving Tony's card in my face, I sigh and allow her to add it to the growing pile she's collected. 20 minutes and 6 band t shirts, 3 pairs of jeans and 1 nightmare before Christmas hoodie later, we leave the store and set out for somewhere else to shop. I come to a stop outside of top shop.
Me and MJ can't allow him to make a fool out of himself alone right? Plus, it's impossible not to sing along to.
As the song finishes we all collapse onto the sofa, laughing, wiping the tears from our eyes, suddenly exhausted. I yawn and rub my eyes, hoping neither of them saw but I'm not that lucky. Nat taps my shoulder and before I can even respond, she picks me up bridal style, a frown making its way upon her face.
"Group hug!!!!" Soon enough everyone had joined in with the hug. They're weirdos. They're my weirdos. I couldn't ask for a better family.
"Sure." I reply quickly, trying to ease her anxiety. Without another word, she begins. Her fingers pulling and tugging lightly, twisting and twirling. Aunt May used to plait my hair like this, every night to help me sleep.
"Come on kiddo," He stands, holding his hand out to me. "Those people I wanted you to meet are waiting." A wave of anxiety washes over me. New people. I can't. I just can't. As if he notices, Tony wraps an arms around my slightly shaking shoulders, steering me gently out of the room.
"Peter? Where are you?" I calls out into the open space. The figure I know all too well steps from behind a cabinet.
"Yes thank you Jarvis." When I don't hear anymore I assume he's gone. I lift my bag onto my bed and look through the limited options I had. I finally decide on a pair of black jeans and a long sleeve plain black shirt with a skull and cross bones in the top corner. I close the door as I leave my room and start retracing my steps from yesterday.
By the time I'd finished reading, there was no stopping the tears as they rolled down my face. Neither of us spoke a word. Neither of us dared. Wanda stood abruptly, moving to kneel in front of me.
"Is that so? Well I think it's only suitable I call you Tiger now? Don't you agree." I laugh and nod my head.
"He's proud of us you know." Peter says, not taking his eyes off the graves in front of us. "Both of them are."
"See you in 7 days." I mumble, leaning into MJ's side. I notice her rubbing her arms so I pull of my jacket and drape it over her shoulders. She smiles gratefully at me.
"Mr Stark is making coffee, Mr Rogers is in his room and Master Parker is in the living quarters. Do you wish for me to notify them that you were asking for them." I shake my head.
"You great Tyler." Wanda says as she walks up to me. "Let me." She starts pulling on the end of my tie, tying it perfectly.
"Well you're just in time, lunch is ready, please come in." Peter and MJ follow mom into the house and I hang behind slightly with my dad.
"прекрасный? You okay?" I reach over to unlock the door, standing in front of the redhead assassin. I feel the blood rush to my cheeks already.
"Pete, why don't you go and unpack whilst we talk to your sister." Peter looks at me, silently asking me if I'm okay with that.
"There's one more thing we want to show you so, children, follow me." Me and Peter share a confused glance as we walk down the hallway we just came through. We stop at a door I failed to notice when I first came in. The adults turn to look at us, seriousness evident in their eyes.
"I can try, I think your dad's the best one to ask for that kiddo. Actually, I'll go see if he's free." Before I can protest, she's already out of the door.
"Can we have a moment with the kids please?" One of the men asked. She was unwilling but obliged anyway, giving us both a look that we knew too well. The 'keep your mouth shut or else' look. After she'd left the room fell into an uncomfortable silence until one of the adults spoke up.
"Wade! What the fuck! What are you doing here?" he doesn't answer as he stands handing me the set of under garments he got me for Christmas last year. I take them from his hands and start slipping them on.
"Pfft. Me? Drunk? No!!! I'm not drunk. Tipsy. But not drunk." The assassin rolls her eyes at my response.
"I'm 21 for your information. Plus if you had to work with this dipshit every day, you'd need a drink to." I say, gesturing to Peter who just slaps my leg playfully.
"Honey! I got her inside!" Dad yells as he runs up the stairs. I punch his back lightly, laughing, trying to get him to put me down. He walks through my room and places me down on the closed lid of my toilet.
"Ass hat." I mumble, jumping straight into a general catch up conversation with Bucky and Nat. This is how it's supposed to be.
"I slept with no one because I'm not a little slut like your girl over there." I point to one of Flash's many girlfriends. This seems to anger him more.
"Is this okay?" I ask, giving them a twirl. They both nod as they adjust their ties. Tony looks at his watch.
"That's enough now thank you. Tony and Steve if you'd like to step up." They do as they are asked and both kiss my head on the way passed me. They stand next to the judge, hand in hand.
"Are Dad and Papa getting a divorce?" I voice my thoughts without really meaning to. I see all three adults share a worried and alarmed look. I laugh darkly to myself.
"So umm, you don't want to talk about that so what do you want to talk about?" I shift uncomfortably and he notices.
"And now, you can go and pack your stuff away like your brother. Bruce will be here in 2 hours so make sure you're wearing something nice." I grumble but comply anyway, trudging my way to my room and closing the door softly behind me. So many emotions. Not enough time to feel them. I shake my head and continue with the task at hand. Moving in.
"No I think Black Widow is cooler." Blake corrects, pulling her sister into her lap. "It's a shame all the Avengers are retired, this place could really do with them." I've never empathised with something so much. Time to open up.
"So" I start. "What do you think?" I feel myself become more nervous the longer they take to answer.
"I tried to forget. I tried to forget. They won't let me forget. They want me to forget but they won't let me." I'm sobbing now. Strong arms wrap around me, rocking back and forth. I
"I think you would benefit from a selection of medications that help with different things. For example, I could put you on something that can ease your anxiety, some antidepressants, some pills to lessen your insomnia. What's your take on that?" I stare at him blankly.
"Your tour is over. I think you should leave now." Nobody dared argue with Captain America. Once everyone, except Wade and MJ, had left dad and papa start grilling us about Flash.
"You've not glitched in a while. Are you feeling okay?" I grab her hand with mine, pulling it down to my side.
"Yes it did. Oh how rude of me. Conrad, this is my wife MJ and we're here to adopt so may we meet some of the children?"
"Hey Pete. Sorry about that bro. are you going to be okay?" he nods and wipes his eyes, giving me a hug. The teacher glares down at me.
"Okay honey, I'm going to point to a letter and you're going to spell your name out okay?" She nods in understanding. I knew she was smart. I go through every letter until she raises her hand. We do the process 5 times before I have her name.
"I don't understand why you kids find these jokes funny. They're highly inappropriate and rude." Steve starts babbling on about the olden days. I look over to Tony who looked just as bored with the speech as I was. But before we we're able to say anything, the elevator door dinged open, revealing the ex-assassin. I gave my cup to the now silent soldier and ran over to hug the woman who is slowly becoming a big part of my life.
"You okay kiddo?" I hum in response, not even turning to face my dad.  We arrive at the clinic shortly after. My dad's go to sign us in and leave me with Natasha.
"Excuse me everyone, can I get your attention please?" Everyone's attention snaps towards the stage area where my two father's stand, looking dashing in their suits.
"Night Tiger." He kisses my forehead a final time and leaves the room. Steve smiles at me and repeats the same thing he did less than 4 hours ago; tucking me in and kissing my head.
I found the car pretty easily, considering she's not changed it since she became my social worker 10 years ago. I don't bother looking both ways as I run across the road, slinging the passenger side door open and sliding in. The brunette rolls her eyes at me.
"We missed you too Mom." Pete says, kissing her cheek. I follow suit before finding myself at my dad's side yet again.
"What happened?" She sits on the edge of my bed, her hand placed lightly on my back. I turn to face her, my cheeks wet with hot tears. I reach under the mattress and pull out a crumpled piece of paper, addressed to me. Quickly handing it over as if it was made of fire before turning back around. Wanda taps my shoulder, gaining my attention, she looks embarrassed before she says anything.
"Sorry babe. I can't." He kisses my head and puts a protective arm around the back of my chair. I lean onto his side, closing my eyes. Enjoying my moment of peace.
"Fine, but I'm not wearing a dress." I more or less stomp to my room and enter my wardrobe, glancing at my many options until my eyes fall on one. 'Perfect.' I pull my jacket and shirt off and replace it with a dark blue blouse. Pulling on a pair of black jeans that aren't ripped, a black blazer and a cute little neck tie. I yank my hair out of the braids and allow it to cascade down my back, settling in small waves. Finishing off my look with black pumps. Without even checking myself in the mirror, I run down the stairs to stand in front of my dad's.
"You cut it. Looks good." I lean up and place a chaste kiss on his lips, standing up and grabbing his hand.
"Why you little." I launch myself at him but he grabs me with ease, throwing me over his shoulder, running towards the house.
"Tyler come on, Happy's waiting." I jump into the car next to my brother and try to hold back a laugh as he puts the separator up straight away to block out my brother's babbling.
"Very well sir. I should also inform you that Miss Tyler's heart rate has increased and her breathing is shallow. Diagnoses: anxiety attack." The robotic voice of Jarvis brought me out of my head. Was my breathing shallow? Yep. Can't breathe. The elephant is back. I grip the bed sheets in my hand, slightly scared of ripping them as I waited for the agony to pass. I looked up at Steve who looked frozen, as if he'd never seen this happen before and he didn't know what to do. I don't blame him. It's pretty scary. He soon snaps out of it though, kneeling down in front of me, allowing me to grip his forearms as he tells me to breathe in time with him. I soon calm down. He checks to see if I'm okay before slowly unwarping the spoilt material, wincing at what he sees underneath. Tony knocks on the door, first aid kit in hand.
"Rogers." I sneer, glaring at the blonde super soldier. The stare down continues for a minute longer.
"No Tony, you're all wrong. Look at those beautiful eyes. Definitely my little Aangel eyes right there." I laugh once again and hug them both tightly.
"Ah my girls have arrived." He places the box down on the floor, grabbing Nat and kissing her. I mutter a gross under my breath. Clint soon turns to me with his arms open, a hopeful expression on his face. 'He kinda looks like a puppy dog.' I muse to myself accepting his hug shortly, not entirely comfortable with him yet due to our pervious meeting being a short one. I pull away and he grins, bouncing on the balls of his feet, excitement radiating off of him.
"Help yourselves guys, we just need to have a little chat with Tyler." Tony says, his voice dangerously calm. I take a step back towards Clint who places a protective hand on my shoulder. Steve holds his hand out for me to take, he doesn't seem that mad, he seems hurt. I give the archer a smile and place my hand into Steve's bigger one and allow him to pull me towards their room. Tony holds the door open for me and closes it softly as Steve leads me over to the bed, sitting down next to me. The billionaire starts to pace the length of the room.
"Michelle, I have loved you for years, even when you were with Peter, I knew it was you. You made me laugh when I thought I'd never be able to smile again. You held my hand when I couldn't walk and you helped my through the water when I was on fire. I don't know what I'd do without you and I don't want to know. I don't want to imagine a life without you MJ. I want you to me in mine forever. I want to wake up to your beautiful face every morning, I want to have mini versions of you running around the house, I want to be a mom with you. I want to grow old with you. I don't want to spend one day of my life without you because I know it will be miserable. So, Michelle Jones, will you do me the honour of being my wife?" I hold my breath in anticipation, tears already building up behind my eyes.
"She's okay. You're better." His smirk turns into a full-blown grin as he wraps an arm around my shoulder, pulling me into his chest, kissing the top of my head.
"Oh kid. I don't know what to say. Do you want to talk about it?" I shake my head no and he nods his in understanding. "Is that what was happening in the gym last night?" I nod.
"In here Ty." I walk through to the kitchen, Peter hot on my tail, MJ and Loki trailing behind. I just know that he's grilling my girl for the details of our relationship. Gossip Queen. As soon as I enter the kitchen area, something latches onto my legs.
"I mean, not if you don't want to I just." She cuts me off my pressing her lips to mine in a slow but passionate kiss.
"Two years ago, I was ready to die. I had nothing. My mother left me when I was 3, I was abused for years, the only family I had where I met Peter died eventually. I didn't see a reason to live. And then these two men came along. Part of the Avengers. The earth's defenders. I thought it wouldn't last. That they'd soon realise that they were too busy protecting the Earth to deal with an emotionally scarred teenager. But they proved me wrong. They fixed me. I was the broken toy sitting on the top shelf in the play room that the kids didn't want to play with. I was the defective typewriter that was only good for show. The girl that was never given a second chance. But they didn't see me like that. Most of you heard what they said in court. I was the girl that was being chocked to death and didn't care. I was accepting my fate. Ever since they took us home, I've not felt like that. I'm not the second choice anymore; I'm the first. I'm not just some random kid with no family. I have parents, a brother, aunts and uncles galore. I have a family. I belong to someone. And you have no idea how long I've waited to be a part of something. Something bigger than a club or a fandom. I've dreamt of having a family since I was young. I always thought it would be my mom, a dad and I, maybe a few younger siblings but never in a million years did I imagine this. Yet I wouldn't trade them for the world." I stop for a moment to catch my breath, wiping away a few stray tears.
"I'll come and see you later. Stay strong, прекрасный." She whispers the words in my ear and I hug her tightly, only letting go when my Pap- Steve, when Steve clears his throat.
"Blakey, they want to take us home with them!! Forever! They're not gonna send us back like they did! They promised." Lexie tells her older sister excitedly. Blake looks up at us in shock.
