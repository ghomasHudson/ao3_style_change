“Cas, you did all of that for me?” Dean asked in a small voice, pointing at his chest.
He fought tears the entire drive home. He continued fighting as he climbed the stairs to his apartment, as he looked around the small space that he shared with another resident from the hospital. He fought as he entered his bedroom and drew the curtains.  He couldn’t bear looking around his bedroom and being reminded that this space was undeniably his and his alone. Seeing Dean’s apartment earlier showed him all the things he was missing. There were no records lined up carefully on the bookshelves, no Vonnegut novels piled on the nightstand, no leather jacket tossed over a chair in the corner, none of the things that screamed the presence of one Dean Winchester. Everything in his room felt so clinical.  All of his belongings existed in this apartment to serve a purpose in his life as a medical intern. Nothing remained of his past life with Dean. Except for three things.
After a brief pause, Cas realized that he hadn’t responded to Dean’s apology, and a nervous silence grew between them. Cas desperately tried to find a way to break it, but it was as if all of the gears in his mind stopped turning. He felt the palms of his hands moisten, he was certain that he created this silence, it was his turn to say something, his turn to respond and put Dean at ease. His quick reaction to the nickname shocked Dean into thinking he had overstepped, but that wasn’t it at all. Cas had never been given a nickname, well, at least not one that he could see himself wearing, not one that seemed endearing. He was in disbelief. Dean wasn’t put off, he wanted to meet him for lunch and/or coffee next week. He was interested in being study buddies, in being friends. He had given Castiel a new name. Finally, he found his voice.
“Are you shitting me?” Cas asked, his voice gravelly as though he had just finished gargling stones. He raised his head to meet Dean’s gaze and the look in Cas’s eyes was enough to make Dean’s stomach drop and his heart stop. The normally bright, cerulean blue of Castiel’s eyes had darkened to that of an ocean during a storm. Castiel stood and rolled his shoulders back, reaching his full height, and while he was a couple inches shorter than Dean, his presence filled the room at this moment.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean said, his voice tilting up at the end, as if asking Cas 100 questions at once. “How are you doing?”
“Sam, look at me,” Dean’s voice was low and forceful. He and Sam had been through a lot of things together, especially in the last few years. When Dean was at his lowest, Sam was the one that was there to put him back together. And Jess was there for a lot of it too, he knew that Jess thought the word of Sam, that she had come to him and told him as much. That she only wished she ever meant as much to Sam as Dean did, that Sam would love her enough to drop everything and help her the same way that he had helped Dean, That Sam would think of her as family in the same way. Dean had learned a lot of self image and self worth the last two years, and there was no way in hell he was going to sit here and let his brother think any less of himself than what he absolutely deserved.
“Well,” Cas said, folding his hands in front of him on the table, “as much as I love bees, I’m here as a pre-med student, I want to be a doctor when I grow up.” He looked down at his hands, not wanting to see Dean’s reaction to such a generic career goal.
He was exhausted, like he had been run hard and put away wet.
Our boys meet for coffee, how will their meeting one on one go??
“Ok, Cassie, hold on, me and Tucker will be there in a jiffy.” Gabe hung up the phone and grabbed his youngest child to go.
The two men sat across from each other with only the sounds of Cas’s muffled sobs breaking the silence around them. After a minute or two, Cas had calmed enough to take deep, steady breaths. His body ceased its racking cries and his tears dried.
Dean turned on his heel and retreated to their bedroom. After drawing the curtains closed and crawling under blankets, the immensity of their situation weighed on Dean. There was no one that he treasured as much as Cas, no one whose opinion he valued and sought out as much as Cas’s. Where had he gone wrong? How could he possibly hope to undo this web he had gotten himself in?
As he made his way down the hall and back onto the overstuffed couch, Dean’s thoughts drifted back to Castiel and their morning. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the back of the couch. The pleasant feeling of sharing a cup of coffee with someone in the morning and the ease at which they fell back into their playful banter sat warmly in Dean’s chest. The desire for a partner and to experience mornings like that again washed over Dean until he felt like he was going to drown in his loneliness.
Cas loved the feeling of Dean’s hands on him, demanding, strong. He closed his eyes and leaned into it.
“Our home then." Cas agreed after a moment. "Let’s go. We’ll drive...fast” he teased.
“There are kids playing outside,” Cas said, noticing. “Everything’s okay.”
One meeting in late July, three months after Dean started, he felt so goddam weighed down that he had to break free of it. The turn to share came round to Dean.
“That’s a pretty tender sentiment. And here I thought you were some tough guy with your motorcycle and leather jacket.”
“I’m sorry.” he mumbled, turning quickly away from Dean.
Thank you to those of you who have commented and left kudos. They are little rays of sunshine! I'm still trying for Saturday updates but subscribing is safest if you want to be sure to know when I've posted. There is still quite a bit more to their story in this universe! 🥰
“Catch ya later Dean,” Jess said, climbing into the back of the powder blue monstrosity.
Dean’s eyes widened, brightening in understanding. “Oh! Yeah...yeah okay.”
“I said some things last night.” he said finally, “did things… I don’t know why. I guess I just lost my mind for a bit.”
“-but the extra food is so good so I don’t want to break it to her grandma just yet,” Cas smiled, but then froze and fell silent with the first few chords of
Dean sang…
This surprised Dean. He thought for sure Balthazar was the kind of guy who would be wining and dining Cas at nightclubs any chance he got.
Dean got up deciding to try Cas again. Taking his coffee with him he searched out the bank of payphones near the elevator. He dialed the number.
“At the beach.”
and more than that, Dean was almost certain he saw it mirrored in Cas too. He wanted to take Cas home, lift him up and carry him to his bed. Then Dean would kiss him until all the sadness was gone and all that was left for them both was
“What’s going on? Everything okay?”
“Well, you probably need sleep if you’re gonna work tomorrow. I should let you go,” Dean said finally.
Cas couldn’t help but notice hearing a tinge of loneliness. “You should get a gig somewhere.”
Cas thought about the idea of Thanksgiving with Rachel and Dean, the two people he loved most in his life. His heart ached with the fear it would be too good to be true. Depending on how things went in the next few days or hours, maybe he would gather up enough courage to ask Dean.
“What are you doing here Sammy?” Dean pressed a hand to his head to quell the throbbing pain.
"Yeah..." Cas forced the words swallowing past the tightness in his throat. Despite this recent blowout, Cas knew the problem wasn't Balthazar. "Yeah, he's good to me."
He drifted deeper into Dean, turning towards him, each movement another step in a bashful minuet. Cas’s eyes met Dean’s. Dean wet his lips, his mouth parting slightly as if to ask a question.
“Mr. Novak was discharged about an hour ago.” She said finally.
Dean looked at Cas, wide-eyed with shock, “I made trouble for you.” he winced. “Cas, I’m so sorry.”
Balthazaar was shaking his head wildly as the doctor asked him something, Dean just thought he made out the word “stablized.” What did that mean? Was he stable? Were they trying to
Sam huffed.
Dean shook his head as if to say no.
“No you don’t understand I need to be in there with him!” He shouted, his clear British accent causing others to turn and take note.
was the cornered animal.
“The worst part was not knowing what I did wrong.” Cas confessed.
“This one knows how to charm the ladies, Fred. And
Cas was turning beet red.
The weather forecast called for sunny skies and Dean thought about taking a ride out of town on his motorcycle for the day. A change of scenery would be good to remind him of the world that bustled outside these walls. He needed groceries and the market closed early on Sunday, but if he left within the hour he’d have enough time to get out of the city and enjoy a long ride on some country roads before coming back to grab food for the week.
Cas, shaken by the surprise of seeing his brother, tried to get Phillipe, the waiter in the next section to switch the table with one of his. Castiel would owe him he promised. Philippe however pressed Cas for details he didn’t want to give and with the dining room short-staffed tonight Cas told him to forget it and determined to just be professional and pretend it was any other guest. If it had been Gabriel, the plan might have worked. But unfortunately for Cas, this was Michael.
“Meg?”
Dean let out a breath that was partly relieved laugh, smiling softly.
Cas had heard him, and that was the very thing that had stolen his voice - temporarily short-circuited his thoughts. Cas
“Oh Cas..” she started.
Cas didn’t say anything so Dean continued. “It makes me really sad. He’s got all this bad shit happening at work and it’s spilled over into their home life. I always thought he and Jessica had something ...I don’t know,
“Yeah…” Dean took a breath. “See ya Cas….talk to you soon!”
Dean shifted lower, pressing Cas’s thighs up again before grabbing his hands, twining his fingers in them even as he tongued along the raphe of Cas’s balls. Cas whimpered, his hips shifting upward in pleasure as Dean’s lips wrapped around his testicle, tenderly licking and gently sucking, before switching and taking in the other, All the while Cas pulled at his hands, but Dean held them fast, forcing Cas to lay back and be pleasured, rather than tend to Dean.
“How’s Sam?”
“No Cas!” Dean put his hand gently on Cas’s chest as if to stay him. “Don’t be sorry. I’m sorry someone fed you full of that bullshit - that you’re nothing special. You’re special Cas. You say I barely know you and okay - so I only met you last month. But already I know that you're smart, and sweet, and sarcastic, and all kinds of hot.”
She’d brought it up to Cas after she’d unsuccessfully tried talking to her mother about it.
Dean’s lips pressed together raising an eyebrow, but his eyes held a twinkle, “I have news for you Cas, if a guy climbs on the back of my bike and grips me as tight as you did, odds are he ain’t straight.”
Cas was shaken from the memory. He looked up at the children blinking. Tommy held up a full-sized Hershey bar and Jenny showed him a giant Kit Kat.
“That sounds nice,” Cas said, like he meant it.
“Cas please tell me that’s not
Dean flashed a lopsided grin. “That sounds less than confident, but I’ll take it. Trust me Cas, I know exactly where I’m going.”  Dean took his hand to lead him the rest of the way. The grassy path had given way to a forest floor covered in roots, pine needles and rocks jutting up in places. Dean continued to walk hand in hand with Cas until they heard water up ahead in the distance.
“I’m sorry that the other night ended so shitty," was all Dean could seem to manage, but at least it was true, at least it was real.
and feel him smile against his chest.
Anything Dean could manage to say or do now was wholly inadequate. He struggled to say anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay,” Cas hesitated, sounding unsure, but then continued.“My hand is reaching up to touch your cheek. I want you to feel it there...let me feel your lips on me, on the palm of my hand as I hold you.”
“You moron! Figures. Only a Winchester could do a mental one-eighty in so little time. Six hours ago you were floating around the shop like your fairy godmother just got you a dress for the ball, now you’re Mopey the eighth damn dwarf! Moved on huh? Is that why he came here and introduced you to his sister?”
Dean said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“Jesus no Cas. You just said your sister’s coming. Spend time with her. For the record, I’m really glad you have her back again.”
“Happy Thanksgiving Cas,” Charlie kissed him on the cheek.
“Okay,...just tell me, man.”
“Dean!” Cas yelled, getting his bearings, trying to make sense of the noise and sulfur in the air and the confusion as another explosion sent a pulsing wave through the air and the ground around them. He looked towards the source of the sounds.
It's what kept him from calling Dean these past few weeks. He’d thought about it,
Dean followed Cas’s eyes as he took in the club. “Dance with me, Dean.” Cas said getting up, his voice low and commanding.
Cas could see the subtle shudders in Dean’s body and stepped across the divide, reaching to place a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean,.....Dean are you okay?”
Dean was good at reading people. How could Dean have misread him so completely?
Dean saw something in Cas then, and all the nights since, that maybe Dean wished he had inside himself. Maybe that was it. Anima and Animus colliding as Benny would say - though Dean couldn’t have used those words to describe it that way at the time.
“Wow,” Hannah whispered to Cas as he stood. “I don’t know who he is, but my ovaries just fell out and started rolling towards him!” she chuckled, but then her eyes narrowed as the man stood there, unmoving, looking up the lawn at them. She glanced at Cas, his back stiff, lips parted, his eyes wide. “Cas? Are you okay? Do you know this guy?”
this guy was, and what he was offering to provide.
Dean felt the press of Cas’s weight against his back as he held on, sometimes peaking his head around Dean’s to feel the wind in his hair, sometimes tucking behind Dean, using him as a wind break. A feeling of affection and protectiveness washed over Dean despite the racing of is heart. Cas’s arms wrapped all the way around the front of him, one resting on his hip, the other at the bottom of Dean’s ribcage as he held on tight, the tilt and dip of the bike as Dean maneuvered around corners, the drag and force of velocity as he sped along streets, all encouraging Cas to hold tighter. The more tightly Cas held on to him the greater the euphoria Dean felt.
Cas held his breath as Dean leaned in, ever so slightly, adjusting the cant of his head as he lowered his eyes to Cas’s lips. Cas let his eyes flutter shut, trusting his lips now to find their way home to Dean…
“Look at me Cas,” Dean said, his breath coming in short gasps as he looked directly into Cas’s rapture-laden eyes, as he rocked harder, and deeper, hitting the spot again and again, sending Cas soaring. “I love you...I love you... Come for me sweetheart...I love you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“An ex-girlfriend invited me to a party at her sorority so I went to say hello and because I had nothing better to do. She and I were just friends at that point. You know, messing around on occasion.”
“You wanna come on my cock Cas?” Dean asked, breaking the seal of his lips against Cas’s hole.
Cas felt shame all over again now as he looked at Dean’s still beautiful face, and knew that he had put those marks there.
Dean nodded, and fuck if Fred wasn’t going to make him cry after all. His eyes misted but a soft smile broke over his face. Dean struggled to keep his voice steady, “I..ah,...I’d like you to meet him.”
“I wouldn’t say that just yet,” Dean grabbed Cas’s hand. “
The man on the loveseat moaned and shuffled positions in response to the noise.
It was Dean’s turn to look startled, grabbing his drink to cover, so Cas continued, savoring each word, and drawing it out slowly, his voice deep and soft,
Since his phone call with Rufus, Dean still hadn’t figured out what he should do. The thought of doing the wrong thing and hurting Cas more paralyzed him. The thought that Cas may have once and for all written him off terrified him. The dream he’d had of Cas at the Palace of Fine Arts still held a kind of dark power over him, the memory of it a shadow over his shoulder.
Dean clenched and unclenched his fist, letting go of the t-shirt and looking away, ignoring Cas’s outstretched hand.
He could be affectionate to just about any warm body near him if he was high enough. Shit, he even made out with Meg once when they crashed at some hash house she led him to after a night out. They were fully grinding with half of their clothes discarded in a heap before a wave of clarity came over Cas and he realized what was happening. He stopped just short of fucking her. Cas pushed himself off and scrambled to grab his clothes while she rolled on her back, her tits exposed, giggling, telling him how much she wanted his cock inside her. Telling him he could take her from behind if it helped.
“This self-imposed penance you’re taking on, avoiding Cas. Hey  - don’t you roll your eyes at me and stop sulking! You’re not a damn teenager!”
Something in Dean’s chest tightened. “
**********
Cas clearly only had eyes for Dean though, as the music changed and he lip-synched hilariously to
fucking thing I want. I’m
Cas breathed deep and let himself relax into it.
“No, I’m sorry Cas...I know you don’t want me here..” Dammit, that wasn’t what Dean had come to say.
Cas’s face fell as he realized the implication of Dean’s question. He took a ragged breath. After a moment he brought himself to say out loud what Dean seemed to imply.
Dean hesitated. The last thing he wanted to think about was this. Finally,
“Yeah...I don’t have it with me,” Dean lied, “but if you give me your number I can make sure he gets it today, that is, if you want him to call you.”
“Can you come for lunch with us before they go?” Jess asked.
On nights when Dean couldn’t sleep or when everything got to be too much he would occupy his mind and body teaching himself any song he could think of. Songs he grew up with, songs he knew Mildred would like, new Zepplin tunes, anything really….well, almost anything.
"Oh shit!” Cas gasped, barely audible as Dean pulled their hips closer, their dicks rubbing along each other with sweet friction, but Dean heard and chuckled darkly, closing his eyes and bending to catch Cas’s lips between his own. Cas broke the kiss with a shuddering breath as he fought the sudden desperate urge to rut against Dean right there in the alley, but Dean held Cas's hips torturously still, denying him as he leaned in for another kiss. Dean’s lips were soft and gentle at first, but then his tongue sought out Cas’s, brushing his lips and then venturing further when Cas welcomed him in. Dean moved his tongue gently, tenderly for all of the urgency Cas felt. Cas melted into it, stroking the firm tip of his tongue along the length of Dean’s, sending all kinds of delicious jolts through his body at the feel of Dean’s strong slick muscle massaging his own in return.
“NOVAK! This mid-20s male is yours! Sounds like he’s stable so stitch him up, assess his leg and possible concussion then you’re out of here,” Anna called out to Castiel.
“Please, it was not a date,” Dean said, raising a hand to stop that line of questioning.
“This seemed a delicate enough situation that we both thought it would be best to handle it on your own… and then Jo burned her hand when she saw that guy pull a knife and stumbled into a stack of milk crates which blocked me in my office for about as long as it for him to slash you, and here we are” Meg replied curtly.
Cas sat back in his seat and mentally kicked himself, what the fuck was he doing? Why was he flirting so hard with this guy? He just met him and the likelihood that this man was as straight as uncooked spaghetti was 100 to none.
“DUDE WHAT?” Dean nearly yelled before bursting out into laughter. Once the realization that he wasn’t going to go running out of the coffee shop sank in, Cas was pulled into the laughter as well. He listened to Dean laugh and decided that it was his new favorite sound. It was comforting and intoxicating and there was nothing Cas wanted to do more in this moment than to make him laugh more.
“HEY!!” Dean said sharply, trying to get the man’s attention on him, instead of on this woman and child.
Castiel had been struggling with these thoughts and they often kept him up at night. He felt so guilty about walking out that night. Dean was in a bad place and Castiel just said that he couldn’t handle Dean and his emotional baggage anymore and just … left. Dean’s treatment of him today was the best that he probably could have hoped for and he shouldn’t have been so surprised to hear Dean call him “Castiel”. Cas was a special nickname that Dean had given him the day that they first met. No one else before him had called him that, and he hadn’t introduced himself as Cas to anyone he’s met since he and Dean broke up. Cas was something special, something that belonged to Dean.
“It’s adorable.” Cas countered, smiling as he took it looking it over. He looked back to Dean, his blue eyes met Dean’s green ones. “And sweet...and nice to know you thought of me.”
He’d been afraid of this night, afraid to see Dean again, and as crazy as it seemed after years of carrying the loss, Cas thought about ignoring Dean’s call if only to spare himself more heartache. But Balthazar was impatient with Cas as he considered. More than once he saw Cas deep in thought and seemed to take it personally.
“Well, tune it up and play us something,” Sam said.
“I don’t understand…”
“Can you heal it?” Dean asked, voice full of concern.
“Normally yes,” Crowley addressed the man then nodded towards Dean, “but I have something I have to take care of for my friend here. As you can see he’s in no shape to drive home.”
Dean turned to look over his shoulder as Cas settled in his usual chair and grabbed a nearby medical journal. He was turning to an article he’d marked to read.
Dean, stared, his head shaking slightly as the stunning weight of it hit him. He was rooted in place, looking on paralyzed as Cas cried.
“Secondly the only thing my sister and I talked about were Thanksgiving plans.”
“It's not true. You checked my references. It's just...I'm attracted to men,
“Ummm, Yeah, of course, but….”
Cas heard an audible sigh. Looking up, he met Dean’s eyes, a well of unspoken sadness looking back at him as he brought their hands back to the table.
different, Cas putting it like that. Dean didn’t do well with feelings, or for that matter things outside of his control, but choices?
The man stammered and finally came up with “I don’t know….maybe Ruby’s, maybe somewhere else.”
but in his mind, he still wanted to protect Cas. Though it never came up he was certain there were homophobic assholes in this group just like everywhere else. People who wouldn't understand and who weren't fit to even speak Cas's name. Cas was everything to Dean, still. One leer or comment from that douchebag Lucius would be all he needed for Dean to lose it. And then there was Benny. What would he think if he knew? Dean tried to tell himself he didn't care, but the truth was if Benny thought less of him Dean's heart would be broken. He didn't want to risk that betrayal, so he just didn't cross that bridge.
Cas's eyes narrowed, "But Dean..."
Dean looked back at Benny. It
Dean faithfully called Bobby that night and finally explained everything to him. Bobby whistled low and paused.
“Baby is a car!” Dean said finally, eyes full of mirth. “and Benny is
They’d made love to each other with their whole selves that night and countless other nights. When Dean wanted something from Cas he always made it perfectly clear, and Cas was happy to give back what, in his heart, already belonged to him.
Dean focused on the tall man. He had lanky brown hair and a stubbly chin. He looked to be in his fifties, was muscular and wore a shirt that had a security logo embroidered over the left breast pocket. He was flanked by a younger man wearing a sleeveless black t-shirt that displayed his tattooed arms - a naked Valkyrie and a flaming cross.
“Cas…”
“Dean!” Cas’s voice was gentle but insistent. “I thought you knew by now. I don’t want some ghost of who you used to be. I’ve seen what can happen, I’ve known you in your dark times. Dean, I’m still here. I want you as you are. It’s not a question of me wanting you in my life. The only question we’ve been dancing around is whether or not you’ll let me be part of yours.”
“Oh Dean come on,” Jess pleaded, getting up and grabbing Dean’s arm before he could answer. “Sing with me!”
“I know. I know you have Dean,” he said calmly after a moment. “But if you hadn’t noticed most of the great warriors in all those stories can’t do it alone.”
“No, I checked…. How did you know about that anyway?”
Ash used to talk about all kinds of crazy theories. He’d talk about everything really. Half of what he said Dean didn’t understand, but he understood enough to be certain that the world would have been better served with Ash in a research lab or university than in a jungle ducking bullets for his twentieth birthday. Once, he said something about time folding in on itself, like paper, that if such a thing were possible then a hole could be punched from one time to the next. At the time it made Dean think about watching the Twilight Zone with Cas back home, the one with the woman on horseback, trying to warn her younger self not to make the biggest mistake of her life, one that would end in tragedy and despair. She yelled...but always unheard, and always too late. The drugs must be taking their effect, he reasoned before the next wave of disorientation crashed, because in the growing twilight Dean looked out now and saw ghosts of his own. His younger self, barely steps away, holding the camera, looking out at his sweet Cas down along the surf. What would Dean scream if he could punch a hole through time and make them hear him?
Cas nodded, pressing his lips into a sheepish smile. “Thank you Charlie.”
“And there’s no engine in this thing?” Dean looked up and down the car, fascinated.
Benny returned his attention to Dean.
“Bar’s s’posed to be open ‘til two!” an angry voice from behind him broke in, the suddenness of it shaking Dean slightly from his muddled daze. He squinted at the man in front of him -
Dean laughed. Cas moaned in both pain and pleasure as Dean gave his nipples a hard twist.
Cas tried not to think of Dean but Dean was like the sound of birds in the outdoors or less pleasantly the feel of shoes that are too tight. Ever-present, especially when things in his mind stilled. He could occupy his mind to try to keep from noticing, but thoughts of Dean always crept back in. He wished he could go to Dean right now.
Dean pressed his lips together, narrowing his eyes petulantly. He knew where this was going. “
he thought, hoping he didn’t just make trouble for Cas.
“For meeting with me. For not hating me too much to see me tonight.”
"Nah Cas...s'allright. I promise I'm good."
Dean was relieved to have found Cas, and gotten him out of that place, but clearly Cas was not happy to see him. In his fear over Cas’s safety Dean hadn’t put much thought into how he might react if he was lucky enough to find him. In the few scenarios he had run through his mind, Cas decking him wasn’t in any of them. He wished more than anything that the warmth he had seen in Cas’s eyes just a few nights ago was there now. He knew it was a stupid, selfish want.
Balthazar stood speechless in the doorway another moment before realizing there was nothing he could say in his defense that Cas would accept.
Dean gave Cas Rachel’s number. “She really wants you to call. She wanted me to tell you she misses you.”
Cas let go and Dean continued to look curiously at his hands..letting some of the ice drop before finally spilling it all from his fingers. He looked at Cas, confused, his eyes searching Cas’s.
He explained that he was in town on personal business and just needed the apartment to crash. He grabbed the phonebook from the desk in the office and gave a quick look.
“Wait!” Dean started to say but a dial tone cut him off.
"Just wait until you're inside and feel the hum and power of her engine." Dean beamed at Cas, so proud and happy.
Cas paused, then “My father’s dead Dean.”
Dean. I’m not sure how far my bedside manner extends to other people.”
Dean shut his eyes and swallowed, the verses a painful contrast to the reality of John Winchester.
“I left my smokes in your car.” Dean said, panic rising, “Be right back.”
“It’s close to Rachel…. and change can be nice. How long was your drive?”
This time Cas ventured further in, squeezing through bodies to find a patch of floor where he could turn around and come face to face with Dean. The crush of people brought them close out of necessity and it wasn’t long before they were flush against each other, Dean’s arms around Cas, his face seeking the hollow of his neck. The music didn’t even register, only the relentless beat and pulsing lights as they moved against each other... other people’s bodies bumping inconsequentially around them.
as he passed, making his way to his car.
Cas brought his hands up to Dean’s face cupping his cheeks.  “It’s okay Dean,” he repeated smiling.
“It’s all pretty weird at this point,” Cas’s voice was tight. After a moment he sighed adding. “I’ll think about it Dean.”
“Do you wanna know Dean? Do you wanna know when I stopped worrying that you might be dead?” Cas demanded.
Cas pulled him in to take what he wanted from Dean’s lips as Dean let himself be ravaged there, tongues, tasting and flicking and swirling together. Cas’s hand dropped back to Dean’s chest, twisting a nipple, and the moan Dean let out against Cas’s mouth was half pleasure, half pain, all ecstasy.
Sam took three steps to cover the distance to his brother, getting to him just in time for Dean to fall against him, exhausted and flickering on the edge of consciousness.
“What are they?” Dean asked, pointing to figures at the tops of each column. Each column had four figures at its pinnacle. Their backs to the world, heads resting on their arms in a sorrowful pose, faces hidden from view. So many of them...as if an entire city had fallen and they were all that was left to mourn the dead.
Dean and Cas met at
The three of them stood as Cas and Balthazar got closer.
Cas turned his body towards him as Dean's hands came up to cup his face. Dean laid a soft kiss on his lips before pulling back to look at him again, arms sliding down around him until his hands rested on the small of Cas’s back.
Cas could actually hear his own heartbeat.
The look on Sam's face as he bit into the burger, smiling and nodding at Dean like he'd delivered him heaven on a plate even as grease dripped down his chin - that look had Dean buzzing inside. Sam was excited and happy, which made Dean excited and happy, and Dean held fast to that emotion and Sammy's smiles and pushed the rest away as best he could.
Cas shivered.
Sam focused in on Castiel, “Cas…” his head lobbed back to Dean,  “Oshiiit Dean..Cas..” he slurred. “M’ssorrry.” Sam tried to get up.
“That’s a loaded question,” he smiled, opting to tease Dean to cover the disappointment he felt. If Dean had no memory of telling Cas how he’d felt, then maybe it
‘Castiel Novak,’ not “To my son, Castiel….”
Cas straightened as he recovered himself. Dean watched the walls go back up in his eyes, the facade of calm return.
Cas replayed the image of Dean walking out the door in his mind. It hurt too much. Couldn’t Dean understand that? How could he not see what he was doing to him every time he raised his hopes and crushed them back down? How many times could he let his heart be broken? Cas told himself it was the right thing.
“Well you weren’t. I cleaned up the bathroom floor after you once already last night. You’re gonna have some fun later cleaning the front seat of your car!”
Sam, chuckled to himself at the banter between his brother and Jess. Dean had that easy way with everyone really. He’d always been charming. Sam found himself thinking on more than one occasion that he was probably lucky that Dean preferred men or he might be freaked out and insecure at their interactions. It was Dean’s cocky, self-assuredness. The lopsided smile with a curled lip. Every Hollywood bad boy seemed to learn that lip curl. Yeah, Dean had always been cool. Later that night they sang together for the first time.
He pushed past Sam and back into the living room, sitting down and taking a gulp of the hot coffee. It was too much, it burned in his throat.
Fred stared right back, unapologetic. Then Fred started talking. He knew the signs because he had been in Dean’s shoes once. After dropping Dean off, Fred had driven straight into the nearest town, phoned in a potential suicide to the police station, then drove back to the dunes in time to see Dean collapse in the sand. He stayed with Dean until the police arrived, yelling for them to radio an ambulance, then stayed longer until the ambulance arrived.
“I’m sorry to call you at work, but Bobby’s shop was the only number I could find.”
Explicit flashback. If you don't want the sex you can skip to the next break (*****).
broken.”
“I’m gonna fix it Cas.”
Dean didn’t respond.
Dean smiled, warm and genuine, “Absolutely nothing…..everything’s,..everything’s right,” a quick, joyful laugh escaping his lips. It was infectious and Cas couldn’t help but smile back.
He held it back, afraid it might be too much too soon. “I wish you were here right now,” Dean said instead.
“I’m sorry Cas…” he whispered finally.
“Are you okay Cas?” she asked.
Cas shrugged, “Nobody’s guaranteed a happy ending. Why should I get one?.... What if what I really want…” Cas shook his head, “..is something I know I can’t have?”
“I understand,” Cas said, and this time, he truly did. He felt silly, and a little selfish that he had worried over the reason for Dean’s absence before.
“Balthazar….”
Dean blinked to clear his vision as the man pushed into Dean’s space. Dean looked the man up and down and laughed, “Yeah, so?”
Dean’s breath came quick and shallow now. Desperate to take in as much contact with Cas as he could -  desperate to make up for all the years they’d missed, Dean’s arms slid round his back to pull Cas close, his warmth, something Dean needed to curl into.
The drive to the Buttes took a little over forty minutes during which Dean told Cas about Sam taking a new job at an environmental law firm, the pride evident in his voice. “I always thought he’d be defending people but I guess he is in a different way. So much of this country is going to shit. Sammy’s gonna help make it better.”
Dean said it jokingly but Cas knew it for what it was. A confession. There was never a mistake, accident, or injury to family or friend that Dean Winchester wasn’t ready and willing to blame himself for. Cas bit his tongue for the moment. To argue with Dean’s self-hatred tonight was useless and he didn’t have enough energy for it. Better to let Dean feel like he was atoning for whatever imagined sin he had committed for now. He could set it straight in the morning.
He could have had Cas all along, could have had Cas with him tonight if he’d never left but he’d fucked it all up.
Castiel paled. The manager must have given Michael this address and number.
For a moment Cas could pretend that -
“You’re up!” Sam said.
Cas looked swiftly out his window, feeling a heat rise in his own cheeks to rival and likely surpass Dean's, but apparently Dean wasn't finished.
“Cas called.”
“I like it,” Cas said. “It's bittersweet. There’s a whole history in this song you know - back to the 50’s.” It put Cas in a nostalgic mood, bringing him back to an earlier time in his life. Sure there was a lot of bad shit going on but he was younger then and maybe more hopeful too.
“Thank you Sammy.”
Dean felt the soft warmth of Cas’s gaze reflected in his own smile, filling him with tenderness - the sense of being exactly where he needed to be….a positive feedback loop. The grass was lush around Cas’s feet and Dean’s lips quirked briefly, eyes twinkling as he imagined taking his time.
“Oh?” Dean slid closer to Cas until they were side by side in the booth. “Did you go dancing a lot when you lived in San Francisco?” Dean didn’t want to think about Cas dancing with Balthazar, but at the same time he wanted to know what Cas would have to compare the night to.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam told everyone about how once their old man, promised to take them out for Sammy’s 10th birthday at this drive-in diner in Poughkeepsie. He came home shit-faced instead, cursing at them until passing out drunk. Sam was so heartbroken it made Dean furious. Putting a finger to his lips signaling Sammy to be quiet Dean crept up quietly and sewed their father into the bed, actually sewed him with a needle and thread into the fucking bed! Cas snorted a laugh and Dean smiled remembering.
“There’s fried chicken, I got the recipe from Ellen at the diner, you know the waitress?” He motioned to the second “fruit,” and finally the third “and peanut butter cookies. Oh yeah...I almost forgot.” Dean reached back into his backpack and pulled out a thermos. “Iced Tea. Nothing fancy." Dean shrugged. "I made it from a mix.”
“False alarm,” Gabriel said, bringing in an enormous floral arrangement and setting it on the table.
again Dean.”
“Tips are good so far.” Cas continued. “I switched some of my shifts at the warehouse to make sure I could get a few days in with the business lunch crowd. Lots of corporate types trying to impress their clients or bosses, throwing money around.”
You should rest a bit before you try to drive back. I can put on the TV and we can just sit and relax...we don’t have to talk about anything unless you want to.”
“Is that the same record player you had when…” Dean couldn’t finish.
“I’m sorry Balthazar,” Cas whispered again. Cas knew Balthazar was worried he might’ve done this on purpose. “When I get like that…” he searched for the right words, “it’s not like I was trying to land in the hospital you know….I just, lose myself sometimes.”
He shook his head, standing up and pushing the chair back underneath the desk. “I know what you’re trying to do boy and it ain’t gonna help none.”
. He froze as their eyes fastened on one another. Cas swallowed hard up at him, and for a moment everything was fixed in place. There was no sound but the sound of the blood rushing inside him like waves. There was no club. There was just Cas and Dean
“Hello, I’m trying to get in touch with Castiel Novak.”
The men exchanged blank stares. The arrangement was a beautiful blend of autumnal colored flowers, with red roses interspersed throughout. It must have cost a fortune. Rachel took the card out of its miniature envelope to read it. Her eyes crinkled as she handed it to Cas.
“CAS!” Jess jumped up and ran to him, breaking the spell, pulling Cas into a hug. Dean broke away, taking a breath as the club swirled into life around him again. Cas closed his eyes and gave himself in to her.
Cas was looking out into the distance, so Dean dropped his gaze to their hands as he let his finger stroke gently, purposefully against Cas’s. Guilt pricking at him,  he felt like a thief...like even this tiny touch was an act of transgression, taking something Cas could no longer afford to give, would no longer
Sam squinted his eyes, cocking his head slightly with that annoying ‘cross-examination’ look that came so naturally to him. “Dean you broke a fucking chair over someone’s head. How can you not remember that?”
They ran, both of them giddy with laughter, hands joined, to the apartment building to escape the rain. The vestibule was empty and lit by dim safety lights. Dean pulled Cas close again, pressing a bruising kiss to his lips and letting his mouth travel down the smooth lines of Cas’s neck. Cas pulled Dean’s head back up to kiss him. He paused, fascinated by the rivulets of rain that tracked down his face and neck, Dean’s freckled cheeks glistening beautifully. Cas leaned in to kiss him back, tasting the raindrops on his lips and the skin along Dean’s jawline till he reached the sensitive place where the bolt of his jaw met his neck. The smell of Dean’s cologne mixed with his natural scent was driving Cas wild and Dean laughed and pushed at Cas a little as he sucked strongly there.
“That smells really good,” Dean nodded at the soup that Cas was ladeling into the mugs.
Cas couldn’t help but imagine he was in one of those paintings from the Romantic period he’d been forced to learn about in school...
“Really, I’m okay Dean,” Cas assured him, but his complexion and total look of exhaustion belied his words.
Dean pulled himself off Cas, earning a momentary cry of displeasure. He grabbed at the buckle of Cas’s belt, loosening it and pulling it open, then popping open the button fly of Cas’s jeans. Cas kicked off his sneakers and shimmied off his jeans along with his underwear, kicking them aside.
His hands and even the quiver in his breath and lips betrayed him as he found himself finally HERE. This moment he had prayed for since the day Cas was taken by The Empty.
Dean remembered by the end of the first week wishing his Dad would marry Darlene and be good to her so that Darlene could cuddle with them and read longer at night instead of having so many visitors. On Mother’s Day Dean would make her breakfast in bed, and his father wouldn't drink so much anymore because he'd be happy, and they could all be a family. Darlene was special and loving and kind. His father must have thought so too. Surely everyone who met her must think so.
Did this kid even know him?
Dean shivered a bit and pulled his collar forward over his neck as the sun dipped deeper on the horizon and a chill set in. His hands and brow were cold with sweat, no doubt his nerves about tonight manifesting in all manner of unpleasant ways.
“So….uh..you hungry Cas?” he asked sheepishly.
Cas walked down to the curb taking in the glossy shine of the black Impala. He was sure Dean must have just cleaned and waxed it. It really did look sweet.
"You're gonna stay right here, understand Sam?" Dean sat on the edge of the coffee table to face him. "We're gonna work this out."
Even though we promised we never would, I understand now why we had to say goodbye, why we
I realize it's derogatory and dehumanizing to call someone a 'junkie.' The term was widely used and accepted in the 1970's and into the 80's so it's what likely would have come readily to Dean's mind.
“Yeah, Baby’s just about finished. Putting in a tape deck as soon as it comes in this week.”
Since the incident this summer with Cas, a door had opened. Talking about Cas in that way became much more matter of fact between them. Who was he kidding? Sam knew they had lived together, Sam knew they were lovers. Sam knew Dean’s leaving had broken them both apart and Sam knew that Dean still carried a torch, no matter how much he had tried to quench it.
Dean squinted his eyes at the man like his question was incomprehensible. Before he could think better of it he blurted “What the fuck do you think man?” His stomach hurt, his throat felt torn and raw and his head still felt like someone had taken a log splitter to it.
"Well..let's see." She began counting on her fingers. "You went to study pre-med because your father sent you away. You sacrificed a relationship with your sister because your family told you you would ruin her life by association. Part of you I think believed it when that asshole brother of yours told you you were a curse on the family.” Charlie turned to look up at him now, reaching her hand to his chest. “Then when someone gave you the slightest bit of love...that was it wasn’t it? I think you told yourself that was all you could hope for in life.”
Cas’s voice rumbled like distant thunder.
“Heh…….I think I really screwed it up this time.” Rufus could hear Dean’s voice breaking over the words. “I think it might be too late.”
Something was pulling at Dean. Maybe it was the voice, or the numbing warmth of the liquor, or the way the room rocked and swayed beneath him now. He was drifting.
She squeezed his hand, her thumb rubbing over his knuckles. “What happened, sweetheart?”
He’d known this feeling before - this euphoria for Dean, like their hearts were sewn together. Cas never wanted it to end, but somehow it always did. Dean left, and after years, returned only to run from him again. Each time it tore away more of his heart. How many times would he give himself over to Dean only to have Dean walk out on him?
Dean passed a worried look to Sam and back to Cas  “Let’s get you out of those clothes and we’ll take care of them our way tonight. Don’t waste your grace on this.”
“Got that position I applied for in the school so the money should be better now. Still running our circle once a week though.”
“I don’t.”
**********
“Want what to stop?” Rufus pressed. Dean shut his eyes, then looked off into some corner of the room avoiding the question.
Everyone seemed to have something to say but Dean. Sam had gotten into a discussion about work and was rambling on to Benny and Balthazar about the potential political ramifications of some case he was working on. Cas was listening, seeming genuinely interested. The only thing Dean could think of was just how extremely aware he was of Balthazar’s arm, still gripping Cas’s shoulder in what looked to Dean like a gesture of ownership.
or if I would ever see you again. It was like you died Dean!
money he would keep and use judiciously to finish his studies. Cas had excellent grades and if he could get a scholarship for med school he could use the funds to help with living expenses.
As the evening waned Cas waved off another cocktail going instead to the kitchen to make fresh coffee. Gabriel followed, his dessert plate in hand.
Cas laughed dismissively.
"uh...I just mean you were always so smart, so I just figured...well anyway, you look good Cas...You look real good."
“No Hannah,” Cas stayed her with his hand, his eyes pinned on Dean. “Stay right here. It’s fine.”
“I was supposed to be home earlier but I got asked to cover part of someone’s shift. Kind of too new to feel comfortable saying ‘no’ yet.”
‘You’re right…” Dean shrugged, taking a step towards Cas, his brow furrowed. “I probably shouldn’t have come. But I did, and I’m sorry. But since I’m here can I please talk to you?.. I couldn’t call...I couldn’t just call you after -
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! I think there will be one more chapter before the end of the weekend.
Dean found a marked trail and led Cas onto it, walking along it for about ten minutes before veering off on what looked like nothing more than a deerpath.
Dean swallowed, looking down at his hands before deciding finally. “Yeah...yeah,” The decision finally made, Dean found he couldn’t suppress the ridiculous smile that broke over him. “I just...I need to figure out how I’m gonna woo his sweet ass back.”
“Yeah..” Sam said.
Cas had stupidly let Michael and his father dictate an end to his relationship with Rachel….excommunicating “the sodomite” as his brother called him, from the family. Well, Rachel was his family too, not just theirs. Cas was going to rectify that. He was taking back their relationship. Cas wasn’t sure if that counted as badass. Probably not, but it was at least a step forward, wasn’t it?
“You’re gonna tell me whether I wanna know or not Rufus so let’s hear it.”
.Cas scrambled to put together anything Dean had said in two minutes but all that came out was…
Dean tilted his head confused,
“Yeah well, I got in huge trouble for that and ended up cowering in my room when his father complained to mine about it. Wait...What?” Cas’s eyes narrowed, “When did you hate my guts?”
“Well,” Cas huffed a laugh confessing, “I guess I was hoping you hadn’t. It was really nice getting the flowers. It’s really nice to finally hear your voice.”
“Hey! I told you when I saw you next,” Benny said, getting louder, “I wanted to hear progress on that guitar!”
“It’s okay Dean.”
Dean saw movement in his periphery just in time to block a punch from the guy with the tattoos. It cost him though, because in doing so he had to turn, leaving his back unguarded.
Cas looked around. Seeing Meg still on the floor he pulled her up and sat her down in the chair, crouching to examine her at eye level.
Dean slowed to a stop outside the house and Cas went down to the front lawn giving a wave. They had said eleven. Dean was right on time.
Dean chose a corner booth away from the lunch crowd. He nervously flipped through the offerings of the booth's tabletop jukebox - everything from classic country to rock, to 50’s doo wop and disco. Something for everybody. Dean had just dropped a quarter when the waitress appeared, an attractive woman just the other side of middle age with a kind smile. He ordered two coffees and lit a cigarette.
***********
"Just for me?” Dean looked disappointed.
“So you went to see Cas last week?”
“That coffee ready yet babe?” Charlie glanced into the kitchen and Cas heard Charlie’s girlfriend Stevie answer.
“Balthazar ….” Cas shut his eyes tight, trying to keep his composure. Taking a breath, he bit back his anger. “I’m trying…I’m
“So ….Cas pulled me back?”
“Ah…” the man said with clear skepticism.
to him, and he'd failed him
Benny shot him a worried glance. “Whatever he’s into, you can’t fix him Dean, and you can’t blame yourself.”
“You were eavesdropping?”
He only did it one more time before the man’s business trip was over and he returned to his family. Dean wondered about them. They probably had food and heat and new clothes. He knew this man was a predator, and yet when the man said goodbye cupping his cheek Dean closed his eyes and leaned into the touch, part of him hoping the man would come back for him. It was more affection than anyone other than his little brother had shown him in years.
By the time the cab pulled into the visitor lot by the beach the meter read $81.84. Dean handed the driver a $100 bill, grabbed his pack and jumped out, not waiting for change.
The nearest couple sat seven rows ahead and off to the right. Castiel leaned his head against Dean’s shoulder and Dean slid an arm around him, holding him close. It was a luxury afforded them by the darkness, to touch so freely.
Turns out Benny wouldn’t be able to make it.
“Cas…your letter…” Dean choked on the words and couldn’t bring himself to continue. “I know you don’t want me to come around anymore. I deserve that…..I should have called, but I’ve been trying to figure out what I could do to fix what I’ve
“Yeah,” Cas said flushing. “That’s uh….” he swallowed. “That’s
Dean was in the shop in Sacramento working under a ‘67 Impala that had seen better days. Bobby bought it at auction but for a car that wasn’t that old it needed just about everything done to it. It had been left out in the blistering cold winters of Detroit and basically abused to the point where its engine had blown from lack of fluid maintenance and rust was eating away at the doors. Dents in the hood and trunk and tears in the upholstery made it seem like someone had been out to punish the poor thing. Dean, always one to want to fix what was broken, fell in love as soon as she was hauled into the yard.
Cas eyed him like he had lost his mind, “You literally just said you have to get back to your baby.”
Dean grabbed a napkin and wrote down the number to the apartment over the San Francisco shop and Sam’s number.
“No,” Richings told him, “Observation. You just intimated that you intended to kill yourself. I can’t let you leave just now.”
“What?.....Spit it out Sammy.”
Cas huffed a laugh, thinking that Dean had somehow won this round.
...but Cas had another order to bring out and the chef was shouting at him to bring out the next tray to an adjacent table.
After Cas’s call, Dean put in nearly double the hours at the garage to keep from ruminating. After his shift he would stay into the night to do the restoration work. Bobby sometimes stayed with him to keep him company, ordering pizza for them both as Dean worked on “Baby,” as he had taken to calling her.
Hannah smiled, giving Dean an amused hum. “A woman?”
was the lucky one, and part of him was always afraid that if Cas ever realized it, maybe he wouldn’t need Dean anymore. Maybe he would leave and find someone who truly deserved him. That didn’t stop Dean from telling him every day, trying to show him how truly worthy he was of being loved.
Cas watched Gabriel join the others, the smile slowly returning to his lips. He was gonna find a way to make more time with Dean.
“Mmm, just as well.” Cas said, “Feed a cold, starve a fever….still, you should try to get something in you today. I’ll stop by during my lunch and bring you something.”
“No.” Dean didn’t feel like engaging.
“Don’t you dare!” Dean cut him off. “Don’t you dare say you’re nothing special, okay?”
Finally, instead of heading home to Balthazar, Cas sought out Meg. He’d been schooling himself
They had been passing through San Francisco to meet Bobby’s cousin about buying out the rest of his share of the garage when Bobby started seeing flashing lights and lines, a searing pain causing him to wince and grab his head. A headache had been building all morning but this was something more.
“They rotate husbands and wives from time to time but yeah, pretty much,” Cas had to agree.
**********
“My name is Missouri. I just have to take down some information from you.” Her voice was commanding yet deep, motherly like the earth itself. The man found himself following her to the main desk.
Cas hadn’t been looking for anything but to blow off steam with friends the night of the Delta party. He especially hadn’t counted on receiving any attention from Dean. In fact, he’d bolted nervously from the scene when Dean, with his reputation for racing, sex, and leather jackets, turned his head and winked at him from across the room.
Cas chuckled and Stephen, having gotten the initial approval of the protective older brother, relaxed his shoulders and smiled before grabbing utensils to go help Rachel set the table.
“Now tell me love,...what's brought such a beautiful pout to those sweet lips of yours?”
He shamefacedly asked to see the manager of the men’s department of the Emporium where he received a ‘Why-the-hell-are-you-here?’ kind of expression as David, the manager, came forward to meet with him. Cas swallowed his pride, and apologized for not calling and for skipping out, giving the excuse of “some issues came up I had to deal with.” He thanked David for the opportunity, acknowledging that he wasn’t a good fit for their sales team.
“Enjoy your 5-star breakfast. Mr. Winchester” he said turning and walking to the door as an attendant brought in a tray of food, “I’ll be back to talk later.”
“No?” Bobby shook his head, “Whatever you say chief.” He ran his hand over his face letting out an exhausted sigh. He let the silence settle a moment on Dean before asking,“You wanna go have a beer or somethin?”
Cas could feel a tear trace down Dean’s cheek as he laid it against his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Two weeks. Dean felt like a heartsick teenager who had just been asked to the prom.
The fight or flight reflex was almost immediate, threatening to tie Cas's tongue once again in knots. He fought it.
Dean rode off, putting his bike back in the garage before going upstairs and collapsing on the bed in his clothes. When he finally slept it was the fitful, anxious kind of sleep that doesn’t bring rest.
POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!
Dean knocked Sam’s hand away, downed his 3rd shot and put the bottle back in the cabinet. “Not until I’m sure Cas is okay.”
Dean beamed, “We’re gonna have lots of firsts together if you let me love you Cas.” The words rushed out of him like a solemn promise.
Cas hesitated but then agreed. A night out with friends would do him good while he still had the time.
Cas inhaled sharply and let out a breath as if clearing himself. He pressed his lips together, nodding acknowledgment at Dean, before turning and pushing on back towards the house.
Cas…”
“Hang on!” Dean said, holding up his hand to stay him. He unlocked and rolled up the garage door at the front of the shop, disappearing inside. Cas heard the familiar rev of a motorcycle engine starting up. And Dean pulled out front, getting off long enough to pull down the door and lock it again.
“So you said Rachel wanted to talk to me?”
and….” Dean closed his eyes, shaking his head, still trying to piece together what was happening -  what
“That one’s

“Yeah well, then he can consider it payback for all the times he’s creeped me out.” Sam looked like he was about to say more but Dean cut him off “I gotta shower Sammy and you’re right - we both need rest. “I’ll see you in the morning. Don’t worry about Cas - I’ll check in on him,” and with that, he left.
Dean smiled and reached his hand around Castiel’s back, gently stroking at the back of his neck, fingers flirting with the lush sweaty locks that curled there.
And really, why shouldn’t he be? It had been years. That was for the best, right? What the fuck else did he expect?
Dean smiled at him, chuckling softly before leaning in to catch his lips again...running his fingers up Cas’s sides, delighting in the feel of his warm skin, and the rise and fall of each rib his fingers slid over.
Dean looked at her and recovered. His expression now a mask of calm. “I...I never did this sort of thing really, no. ‘Cept once with my brother.” Dean looked to spot the trio, smiling again as the kids ran across the street to the next house, Cas in his cat ears following protectively behind them. This was, Dean thought, what childhood

maybe for the first time.
Sam nodded and understood. Privacy, family only. Partners weren’t considered family. In some places getting caught with a homosexual lover could still get you arrested or worse. San Francisco was kind of a safe haven, or safer one, but hospitals still followed official policies.
Ever since they reconnected Gabriel seemed to have loosened up about the fact that his brother preferred men. Now he was being a teasing asshole older brother in the best way he knew how. Little did he know that Cas
“Junk-food run and movie marathon,” Dean said decidedly.
“Sammy!” Dean ran over to him, Cas in tow. Sam’s eyes were hollowed out and unfocused, a pained expression on his face.
“Okay...no,” Cas’s response broke through Dean’s thoughts. “I ...I just wanted to make sure you’re okay tonight.”
Dean was panting now writhing into Cas’s hand as Cas shifted his hips to rub his own cock harder against Dean’s thigh and fingers, gripping Dean and pulling him down until they were both prone along the seat, breathless and desperate for each other.
Sam huffed.
Cas realized.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean found himself saying, his voice catching with anxious breath at the edge of his throat.
“You think you can manipulate my kids to get to me? That boy may be stupid but I sure as hell aint.” John took a step towards her, raising his hand.
“Who says it's for you? I been trying for years to get Mildred to run away with me and I figured now's my chance.”
Cas settled himself into a chair next to but sufficiently apart from Dean, with Balthazar on his right.
****************
“Charlie called, and I figured I’d blow off some steam after work. Dean if I had known -”
**********
"Dammit," he muttered shutting off the water and grabbing for the towel. He stepped out of the shower basin giving himself a quick pat dry before wrapping it around his waist. He tried to move swiftly in case it was Sam, but once again the ringing stopped just short of him grabbing the receiver.
“Look, I get it that I screwed him over. I’m sorry. I’m not trying to mess up his life...
Balthazar nodded. “Promise me you’ll take care of yourself today,” he said.
"Okay...that's good Cas."
It was a warm and bright Saturday morning in October, the sun quickly imprinting it’s heat on Dean’s black t-shirt as he climbed into Baby, started the engine, and popped a mixed tape into the deck. The speakers opened up with an acoustic guitar solo that Dean had been desperately trying and failing to master since he’d first heard it come across the radio.
