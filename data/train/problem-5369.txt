“I mean, you do know who you’re marrying, right? Some punk kid from Brooklyn?” Bucky continued, grinning cheekily. “You still haven’t even convinced him to start wearing a

woman, a woman who was controlling the weather, a very angry-looking man with metal spikes coming out of his hands, and someone in a red and blue suit that appeared to have some sort of... webbing that he was using?
“Tony, darling, what did they do to you? I swear, I’m not one of them, I’m not here to hurt you,” the Skrull said, keeping his hands up as he slowly inched towards Tony. “I don’t know what they might’ve done, but I can promise you that I’m here to get you out. We knocked out a couple of those shapeshifting freaks on the way over here, but I
, so Tony didn't pull away from him when he kept the brunet snuggled against his chest. "But I'm going to keep saying it, because it's the truth, and one day I
He wasn’t expecting his lover to come running over to greet him, no. They’d never really been very touchy-feely with one another, but he was okay with that. It was just part of who they were. No, there were others that he was expecting to come running over to greet him.
"I missed you so much," Steve whispered. "I thought you were dead... if I'd known before, I would've been searching for you. They wouldn't let me go on the search missions, and when they told me that you were dead—"
"Come on, let's get out of here," Steve said, giving them both a quick kiss before keeping them held up upright. "Someone's not allowed out of the tower for the next week."
He made sure to keep the Hydra agents away from Iron Man's back while he shot down another couple Hydra agents. There were a bit too many for just the three of them to be fighting comfortably, but if they got to the controls... Clint and Natasha needed to be able to fly the plane, not deal with Hydra agents.
The next morning, when Steve was set on tracking down the Winter Soldier, he stuck by his boyfriend's side, doing anything that he could to help out on the man's search. Each night, he was just happy that Steve came back to him, returned to
. He’d rather never see those blue eyes of Steve’s than know that he didn’t prevent his lover’s death.
"Please don't leave... during the night, when I'm not here," Steve whispered. If Bucky left now... he didn't understand why his friend had stayed away for so long, but if he left
to hurt his family, he’d kill them all. Every last alien that got in his way. No one was allowed to hurt and deceive his team,
"Thanks," he mumbled, and Rogers didn't seem to mind when he didn't let go of his hand. Stark, on the other hand, looked jealous.
"You... are okay, right?" Bucky asked, sounding cautious. As a super-soldier, he probably didn't need to think about aging so much. None of them really thought about it—they were too busy fighting evil and sorting out family matters to think about the idea of one day being old. Now though? Now the very thought was staring them all in the face.
"He's only being overprotective because he cares," Tony said, kneeling down beside Steve so that he could see the plan that his boyfriend was sketching out. Clint's face turned red when Bucky didn't deny it and instead helped him down onto the ground so that they could plan.
“Okay, something serious that I’ve only ever talked to you about… looks like everyone’s gonna know now,” Clint mumbled. “So remember the first time that the two of us went out drinking together and we ended up down in your workshop? We were both pretty drunk by that point in time, and you were showing me some designs you made for new arrows. I was
“And ever since then, I haven’t ever questioned you love for me. I know that you never once questioned the fact that I love you, not after we started officially dating—once we both knew that we wanted this to be permanent, everything was… was
"Actually," Stark said, shaking his head. He offered a small grin. "I'm not surprised about the situation you're in. I'd probably be in the same place if I didn't feel that I could tell the world that I'm Iron Man. I needed my team, they really did help. Plus, Steve and I do a
know already? Was I really just fooling myself into thinking that I had a secret identity? How long have you known?"
“They were trying to kill him,” Steve mumbled, glaring at the IV as Bruce put some more medicine into it. They had to give him high doses just so that it would actually work. “They… they had these plants that made him human, a-and then they… they were gonna kill him. I had ta stop ‘em, I… I had to save him.”
"Bruce will figure it out," Steve said, stopping Tony before he could go down the hallway to the kitchen. "If there's
“It’s a good thing that I don’t mind having our family around,” Tony mumbled, closing his eyes as he let himself relax in Steve’s arms.
"We don't need them conscious," Tony growled as he gripped one of the agents by his neck. "If you want to live, you'll tell me where Barnes is
"Good," Steve said. "I can do that. You're right—you're one person, no matter if you are or aren't wearing the armor."
"Nope, you need to stay here and get some sleep," Steve said, grinning when Tony turned around to face him. The shorter man pressed up against him, and Steve pressed a kiss to his lips. "I haven't had a chance to snuggle with you in days, and I miss it."
,” Tony whispered. The bed felt like Heaven after sleeping on the metal floor for two weeks, but Steve definitely made a better bed than the mattress did. “You’re so warm… just don’t move, okay? Just hold me.”
"If he's anything like me he'll eventually come around to the idea," Rogers chuckled, and the four walked over towards the portal. Clint was obviously confused about what they were talking about, but he didn't ask.
“Tony,” he whispered, not able to believe that his husband was right there. The man had said that he was gone, that the team had died and he’d missed out on
But this morning, something was different. He couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was, but he could feel that something was...
"The comms are always on... you've been in battles with us before, Buck, you should know that," Tony said.
“You’ll be happy to know that Stark never gave up on you, choosing to stay alone and wait for you to wake up. I’m almost sorry you missed his funeral.”
“Clint, I need you to tell Tony something that only the two of you know, okay? Whatever you can think of, but make sure that no one else knows about it,” Steve said, keeping a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Okay? The aliens were using our faces to hurt him.”
There was a slight static-y hissing noise that came from the suit, but with the lack of movement, he couldn't even be sure of the man was alive.
"If it'll get us away from the awkwardness of being around the team, then I'm fine with that," Tony said, trying to keep an eye on all of his teammates. Bruce was fine, and Clint, Natasha and Bucky were all watching each other’s backs, so they'd be fine, too. They'd all be fine.
Tony stepped forward to give him a half-hug, careful of his damaged arm. “I won’t let you do this to yourself, Steve.”
"I was working on these upgrades for your armor," Tony said, grinning. "If I can just find a way to make everything bulletproof without losing any mobility, then the whole team could be safer. I've got it
. He was a perfectly capable human being and hated being treated otherwise. But he wasn't about to just yell at his team, because he understood that they must've been feeling just as awkward about this as he was.
"I'm glad," Steve said, carrying off towards their bedroom. "I know that it hasn't been easy... especially after all those days of searching... I really owe you, Tony. You've done so much more for me than anyone else... You gave me a home, you gave me a
He managed to get Bucky as far from danger as he could before throwing the shield over to him, knowing that Bucky would be able to catch it. His teammate was used to handling the shield, though it wasn't until he threw it when he realized that he might actually
It wasn’t like his hands were cold, because they weren’t. When Steve had been in the medical wing for over a week, his hands had been freezing for the first two days. On the third day, though, when he’d woken up, his hands had started regaining the ‘I’m not dying of blood loss’ warmth that they used to have. Steve’s hands were still warm right now, despite being unconscious.
Sighing, Tony put the phone back before he wandered down the hallway and over to Steve’s room. If anyone needed to know, his husband did. Whether or not Steve would be able to hear him, he still deserved to know.
"I can try," Bucky sighed. Despite what he'd been through as the Winter Soldier, Steve could really see that his best friend wasn't completely gone. The more he remembered, the more Bucky was back. "There's somethin' about him... I like him. I never thought
“Those things are freaky looking,” Clint said, shuddering. He glanced over at Bruce. “Nothing wrong with green, though. Green is cool.”
"Steve, I was warned that you were hit pretty badly, and I'm very disappointed that you didn't come straight to me," Bruce said, frowning at him before he turned his attention to Tony. "Are you hurt? And no lies, because I know that you keep a first-aid kit in the lab, but you're horrible at treating your wounds so I'm not giving you the chance this time." He then glanced between the two. "You're finally ready to tell us?"
Bucky gave him an apologetic look and handed him the open jar. "Sorry," he mumbled as he wandered over to his seat. When Tony put the jar away and brought his food back over to the table, Steve had a completely neutral look on his face, but judging by the way that Bucky was avoiding eye contact he
Tony stood up, never once letting go of Steve’s hand as he leaned in to kiss his husband. “It’ll be okay. You don’t have to worry about that. I’ll take care of this family for you until you come home. I promise.”
"Of course I will," Tony said, giving him a look that was probably supposed to be prideful, but it looked so strange to Clint that he couldn't hold back the giggles that erupted from him. Okay, so maybe he was a bit more than 'a little drunk.'
"How many times do I have to tell you not to apologize for nightmares?" Steve murmured, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“We could help him figure out how to control those powers,” Steve offered. The easygoing smile on his face was enough to make Tony relax. “I mean, none of us are mutants, but the Avengers are smart enough—we’ll figure it out. Peter needs a home, and I’m sure they want to set it up as a foster-like situation in the beginning, just to make sure that he’d be a good fit for our family, but… Tony?”
"If you see any of them," the Captain said, handing him the sketch. "They're all great people, and I trust them with my life."
“I’ve got the rings, Mr. Stark,” he whispered cheerfully as he gave Tony a quick hug. “This is so great, everything’s so beautiful! I’m so glad you and Captain America are finally getting married.”
“What’s wrong, darling?” Steve asked. One of Steve’s hands gripped his hip while the other one cupped his face gently, and Tony leaned into his touch and up for a kiss. It was little things, like the way that Steve touched him,
, though, Steve wasn't sure if he'd have learned of Tony's secret. So maybe it was a good thing that the portal had been created. Either way, Steve was just glad to know that the man he loved was the same man he trusted with his life on the battlefield. That made everything so much better for him.
Turning his attention back to his husband, Tony placed both hands on Steve's shoulders before he leaned up, stealing a long, passionate kiss from his lover.
"I like fixing things," Tony said, trying to concentrate on the busted arm and not on Bucky's face. "Your arm is broken, I want to fix it. What's so difficult to understand?"
Bucky pulled sharply away from Steve, stumbling backward as he looked around. It only took a few seconds for him to see Tony there. When Steve had shouted
A couple of the people on horses seeing to be trying to rope down the bird-people, and... other people on horses? Someone was in danger.
At first, Steve looked confused, but then a thoughtful look crossed his face. “You told me about him. I remember hearing that name, and it just… it stuck. Just like your name, and Bucky and Bruce and Natasha and Clint and everyone else that I
“I know that the life that man gave you is wonderful and happy and everything you ever wanted, back in the war,” Bucky continued, sighing. “But you’ve got to remember what you said about this life. You’ve never been happier—I’ve seen it. When you were chasing after Peggy, you just had a crush on her. What you’ve got here with Tony… Steve, I’ve never seen you in love until I saw you with Tony.”
The children were screaming just as loud as she was, grabbing at him and trying to pull him back, to put him back under their spell, as the numbers started covering everything and slowly rotting it all away. He couldn’t close his eyes, he couldn’t get away from the horror that he had to witness as the entire world fell to nothing but an endless sea of black.
"Bruce... the Hulk," Steve said. He still felt awkward, because this wasn't his teammate Iron Man, even though he... kind of was. "I don't know anyone else."
Steve glanced back and forth between Tony and Bruce. His boyfriend was staring at the doctor, eyes wide and scared, while Bruce opened the first aid kit.
wolf, so carrying a super-soldier out of the town wouldn’t be a problem for him at all. Steve clung tightly to the werewolf’s fur, and the moment that he did so Tony charged off into the trees.
There was an almost regretful look on the woman’s face. “Her curses can’t be fixed—no one ever has been. Whatever happened—your friend is gone, now. People aren’t strong enough to be able to control her curses, and they become mindless beasts that know nothing more than
“It’s okay,” Tony whispered. It was his voice that Steve had been hearing, when he thought that he was going crazy in the simulation. Tony was always here. Tony was always waiting for him. “Everything’s going to be okay now. You’re awake, you’re
The genius looked at him, raising an eyebrow. He always seemed to take things as challenges when they got drunk together.
Tony sighed, but there was no point in arguing. When he thought back, he was pretty sure Steve had mentioned going out, but he was a bit engrossed with the battle. "Fine, fine. But if
If Tony was Iron Man, that would explain why Iron Man always wanted to get back to the tower first... not so that he was able to get home, really. It was to make sure that he could keep his identity. It would also explain the bruises that Tony got sometimes—not from working in the lab, but from going into battle with the team.
,” the little girl said. Her little dress was splattered with enough flour and batter for Steve to have been able to come to that conclusion on his own. “Wanna help?”
"Of course you didn't make me think this way," Tony muttered, silencing his husband with a quick kiss. "I looked at myself in the mirror. You've still treated me like I'm young and gorgeous."
, you're been keeping us all safe by upgrading our armor and weapons... You've been better to us than I'd ever expected, the first time I was told that you were offering us a place to stay. You've been nothing but kind, and one day the rest of the world will see that... if you
Bruce helping them. Now that he wasn't there to knock dragons out of the sky. "What do you say, pipsqueak? Should we see if they're over there?"
"But you know what would be good for you right now, more than anything?" Stark asked, and Tony smiled a little at Rogers' disapproving look. "I wasn't going to say a threesome, I swear. I think we should figure out how to get you home. That way you can talk with your team, hug you own Steve, and see that your team

that I can't carry my husband off to bed then I'm gonna punch you." Tony could barely hear Steve, but he was still awake enough to know that he was being carried. Normally he would've complained about it—usually just to get Steve to start kissing him until he couldn't talk anymore—but right now he was just too tired to care.
Instead of going down to the lab, Tony started going through the new designs in the room, explaining them to Steve in as much detail as he would if the super-soldier was down in his lab with him.
He couldn’t wait to be home, with his family finally back together again. He didn’t have to return home with no stones and a hole in his heart anymore, he could return with the stones back where and
Tony wouldn’t attack him… well, the werewolf might, but it wouldn’t be Tony’s fault. He knew that his friend couldn’t control it, and he wouldn’t hold it against him if he did get hurt.
“I heard you so many times… I thought I was going crazy, because I was hearing the voice of my husband telling me that he’d always love me, but I thought… I thought Peggy was my
"I didn't want to interrupt," Tony said, though it sounded kinda stupid when he said it now. "You two... you're just so perfect together."
But then, after dating for three months, when they broke the news to the Avengers, Tony had found that the team had been very supportive of their relationship. Sure, there was a lot of teasing for a long time, but it was always friendly teasing, like he was in on the joke… instead of him
Something was missing. He had his whole family here—Peggy and Michael and Mary and Susan and… There was something missing. Something was wrong.
Now, as they went into battle, Steve couldn't help but worry. This was the first time that Bucky was fighting alongside the team as an official Avenger. He'd asked about Iron Man, and why the man didn't stay with the rest of the team. Steve had tried explaining how Iron Man's identity was secret, and how he had a life outside of being an Avenger that he didn't want to be affected by him being a superhero, but Bucky hadn't been so thrilled about the answer.
, darling. That isn't going to change. You don't have to worry about Bucky. At least, you don't have to worry about me leaving you for him. It's never going to happen. He's basically my brother, and the thought of..." Steve shook his head, chuckling again. "Nope, that's not going to happen. And you don't have to worry about it, okay?"
"I don't want to lose you," Tony said before he could hold the words back. Somehow, Steve always made him feel so safe, even when he felt so vulnerable. Those strong arms of his would just stay wrapped around him, and he'd hold him, protect him, keep him safe.
There was a snarling noise as a huge metal box was dragged out by horses to the crowd, dropping the box in the middle of the circle. Steve tried pushing past some people, but everyone wanted to be in the front—they all wanted to see this.
in the room, and for a second Tony was worried that something had gone horribly wrong. Why hadn't the team come running in? Did something happen to Steve? Did anything happen in
"No, I love spending time with him, no matter where we are," Steve said quickly. He pressed a hand to the glass and sighed. "I was going to spend the evening with him... Now I'm just hoping he didn't spend the entire time in the lab, since I know that he doesn't get enough sleep as it is. But instead I'm here... and while I do love spending time with you, Iron Man, don't get me wrong... I just wish I could've said something to him before we were called out."
idea," Steve said. He'd always loved flying around with Iron Man before he knew about his secret identity. He'd always kept it as professional as possible. Now, though, he could really enjoy being able to hold tightly to his boyfriend as they flew through the sky. It was wonderful.
"Babe," Tony complained, and Steve laughed, backing off enough to start stripping his clothes off. With careful hands he started undoing the buttons on Tony's shirt, stopping though when he noticed the uncertainty on his husband's face.
where you'd be best right now, and you know it." Steve offered his friend a smile. "It's also pretty comforting knowing that you're watching our backs when we can't."
truth. “Steve isn’t choosing between me and Peggy. He’s choosing between the family that he thinks he knows and something that he can’t even remember. But even if he could, he’d be choosing between me and the family that he always wanted. I wouldn’t blame him for choosing to have a family, Buck.”
thankful for it," Tony said. "And no one's been treating me differently due to being an Avenger... everyone still treats me the same. I was worried they'd start acting different... But they haven't. And you haven't either. Which is nice, by the way."
Tony nodded. Great, S.H.I.E.L.D. still had their hands on the only thing that could potentially make him younger again. It wasn't that he didn't trust them—no, that was pretty much it. He didn't trust S.H.I.E.L.D. to save his life, but he did trust his team to do that.
“The man who did this… he didn’t think that you were ever going to wake up,” Bruce said as the team slowly approached. Steve smiled at them, and they all seemed to relax. “He was convinced that you were going to be stuck in that simulation… forever. But then you seemed to be… struggling against the simulation, and we thought… he said that if we shut down the simulation it was going to kill you, and the only way to get you back was to wait until you woke up…”
"I had my suspicions since the beginning... so I got to know you better, and I realized that there was no way that you

“How about this—I’ll bring some food up here for you, okay? Then you don’t have to leave just yet. But once you’re done eating, you
"That sounds like a good plan," Steve agreed, though Tony was pretty sure he was just agreeing because the two of them were snuggled up on the couch and if they started arguing, they wouldn't be cuddling anymore. The issue with arguing now was that make-up sex wasn't an option, and Tony was too tired to argue about anything. Plus, Steve seemed to be agreeing with him to keep him calm and relaxed and not thinking about their dilemma.
“I don’t know what you’re asking of me,” Peggy snapped, and there—again, she looked just like a stranger. Just for a second. He couldn’t explain it.
"I know... I just... I hate waking you up because of my problems," Tony said, keeping a tight grip on Steve. His lover was still breathing hard, his heart was still racing, and Steve knew that being close did calm him down.
. Tony was barely able to keep himself from laughing when he saw her, stuck as a mermaid. Bucky, though, hadn't been able to contain his laughter, and he'd gotten
“Hey birdbrain, you’ll never guess what happened,” Tony said once he’d grabbed his coffee. He took a seat at the table and struck a dramatic pose, sticking his left hand out so that his teammate was able to see the ring up close.
Bucky was trembling as he pulled Tony out of his chair and into a hug. “I never thought he’d find someone so good, Tony. When he first told me that the two of you were a thing, I wasn’t sure what to think. But now that I’ve come to know you, I’m so glad that you’re the one he chose. Sometimes I wonder if Steve’s good enough for you…”
Tomorrow he’d search for Tony, his team would show up to help, and… and maybe he could talk with some townspeople to try to figure out where the witch
, our team will probably want to know the good news, right? That’s not something I should just hide from them, right?”
"H-he's in the facility, a couple levels down," the guy gasped before Tony knocked him out. He wasn't
"Ready," he murmured, catching's the suit's arm long enough for Steve to press a kiss to the forehead of his helmet. "Don't get hurt. You're not allowed to play matchmaker and then go off and get hurt, because I plan on taking you out once we get back to the tower."
"I wasn't sure I'd like him," Tony said after a moment. "A-and I think I'm starting to get past the whole... 'you're going to leave me for him' thing."
“They have treated you worse,” the demonic man said, floating alongside him like they were old friends. Only one set of footsteps echoed across the rocks. “They have given you everything you never realized you wanted, then took it all away from you, yes? And they have given me infinite wisdom. Who has it worse?”
“I’ve thought about this a lot. We never… No one’s ever going to be able to unhook this machine. If the power goes out, it’s got an automatic, reactor-driven power source to keep it going. I know you’re alive, I know you’re well, and I know that… I know that you’re happy.” This time there were tears in his eyes. “I know that you’re happy, and that’s… that’s enough for me, you know? That’s all I’ve ever wanted—for you to be happy. And I know… I know that you’re happy right now. I can feel it—you’re relaxed, you’re not in pain, you’ve always got the hint of a smile on those beautiful lips of yours. And you’re… you’re with your first love. You’ve got the family that you’ve always dreamed about, and while I know that it isn’t real… it’s real for
highly skilled, and he easily managed to get the sword out of the man’s hand and hold it up, ready to protect his teammate. “Don’t touch him.”
"Iron Man?" Steve asked, trying to get the other man to wake up. There was no way that he could be dead... No way. "Iron Man, can you hear me? Are you okay?"
Just being able to hold Tony felt right. They spent the next few minutes in silence, with Steve playing with Tony's hair as the genius relaxed against him and smiled softly. Silence was something that Steve had originally struggled with in their relationship—he knew that there was something that Tony wasn't telling him, and at first he'd been worried that it would just stay between them just like the silence, but... he'd grown to like the quiet moments they got. There were so many things that they didn't need to say, and they could just stare into each other’s eyes and
"Steve," he tried mumbling as the superhero carried him out of the burning building. His date made sure to keep his head pressed to his chest, held tightly to prevent injury. He couldn't smell anything more than smoke, but it did feel good to have his face pressed to the cooler fabric of Steve's suit instead of near the fire.

the serum that made me who I am today. But Tony built his company up from near nothing—yes, Howard started it, but you should've seen it back in my day. Most of what he built didn't even work. But Tony... he genuinely cares not only about his own work, but about the people that he helps."
"He's going to need a transfusion," Bruce said once the bullets were out. Bucky was laying on the bed, still holding Steve's hand, but looking very out of it.
“I can do that,” Tony said, giving in. It wasn’t like he had any other choice. As Bruce left the room, Tony turned his attention back to the blond super-soldier in the bed. There was just one thing that Tony wanted at the moment—for Steve to open his eyes. If he opened his eyes, maybe then he’d finally just
"It's not that," he sighed, dragging himself out of bed. "I need some coffee. I'm exhausted. That's all, Steve, really."

The first thing he noticed upon waking up was that he didn't hear the incessant beeping of machines at a hospital, he didn't smell that
“Um… sure, Mr. Stark. I hope things get better for you soon,” Cheryl said, confused. “You know that I only want to see the two of you happy.”
"Don't get your panties in a twist," Tony said, flying off to cause a distraction. And oh boy did he ever!
When he finally made it to the lab, he was surprised to find that nothing was going on. A couple holographic plans were still floating in the air, so with professional ease Steve gathered them up—Tony
"That's a variable that I hadn't considered," Bruce, looking completely confused in his sleep-deprived state, chose to let Natasha keep taking him over to his bedroom. Natasha turned around just long enough to wink at Tony.
time, and… honestly, it was pretty funny, because it made sense why you’d been trying to keep me in bed so much,” Tony laughed. Steve looked like he’d insulted him by saying that he thought Tony had wanted a friends-with-benefits sort of relationship, and Tony had just been thrilled at the fact Steve really
"I've been worried that one day you'd break up with me because it was really Iron Man that you liked," Tony mumbled, then laughed a little to himself.
"Actually, Buck, that sounds like it would be a great way to ask me out," Clint said. Tony had never seen his face light up so much. "And if you really wanted to get an answer to that question, it would be 'Friday sounds perfect.'"
"Hey," Steve murmured, taking Tony's hand ever so gently. He looked so calm, and Tony couldn't help but feel better upon seeing his warm smile. "Quit looking at your phone—I don't care
That’s what Steve had originally been doing, but he figured that if he could find the witch then maybe… maybe he could fix this. He needed to fix it. For Tony.
“There hasn’t been a single day that he hasn’t been in here, waiting for you, telling you about what’s been going on and about what you’ll be waking up to find,” Natasha said.
"Tony, you're one of the kindest, most compassionate men that I've ever met. You've given us all a home—before you, none of us had much of anything. But you gave us a home, let us become a
Husband and husband. Where was his husband? Hadn’t he… hadn’t he married a man? Because it was legal, as of… 2015, right? No, it was only 1951 right now, that couldn’t possibly be right.
The quiet beeping of the heartrate monitor was nearly deafening, but… Tony had been the one who insisted that they kept it on. He needed to know that Steve was still alive, that his heart was still beating. It wasn’t necessary anymore, because he wasn’t in any danger, but… it was comforting.
Tony just nodded. Less stress and worry wasn't going to happen until he was back to normal, but it was a good thought.
Tony looked over to Steve to see if that was true, but he couldn’t confirm or deny it. He didn’t have an answer, but he was sure as hell going to find one. The genius seemed to catch on to his unease and his worry, because he didn’t look any better about finding a cure.
for a reason. He gently cupped Tony’s face, holding him there as they broke apart. There was still a look of fear in Tony’s eyes, but he looked like he at least understood that Steve cared for him.
“We need to find a way to tell Skrulls apart from normal people… I don’t want this ever happening again, to
"See you soon," Steve murmured, stepping close to Tony. The genius had installed a bit on the boots of his suit for when they did their hug-and-fly routine. It was such an easy way to be able to fly, freeing up Tony's hands while Steve held tightly to the suit, giving him a good footing so that he didn't slip. He shut off his earpiece, hoping that Tony would do the same so they could talk.
"Because... why would anyone love me when my own parents couldn't?" Tony whispered, once more breaking Steve's heart.
Tony grinned, leaning back against Steve's chest. The moment that the elevator doors closed, he looked back at his boyfriend. "I like him."
"But I've looked at myself in the mirror," Tony muttered. When they got married, "open communication" was something they'd agreed upon. It was probably for the best. He shrugged and mumbled, "I know how I look, and I... I just wouldn't blame you for not being interested."
fit him. Watching his muscles flex as be bent to grab something out of the fridge made Tony abandon his coffee.
that cares about me... so it's easy to think that maybe the Avengers don't really care about me as much as I think they do..."
“Well that was unexpected,” Steve murmured as soon as they were in the elevator together. He kept Tony wrapped up in his arms, and Tony leaned back against his fiancé’s chest. He was right where he belonged.
a genius," Steve murmured, smiling at the thought of his boyfriend. It still made him feel giddy inside, calling Tony his boyfriend. It had taken forever for him to chase away the press, to try and convince them that
“Papa?” Susan whispered, looking up at him. Her light eyes flickered back between blue and green, just for a second.
"I know. I already got rid of them on the way... 'cept the knives, those are in my boots," Bucky murmured. The pained look on his face worried Steve, because if he was actually
“I can do that,” Steve promised. “I don’t know why they took you, Tony, but I’m so glad you’re alive. I was worried that they… that they got rid of you. That’s what your doppelganger told me when I was interrogating him. He told me they’d already killed you, but… I knew he was lying.”
“—and we shall rid the world of those creations, those violent and blood-thirsty beasts, and keep the town safe from her control,” the man shouted. Steve didn’t like the sound of that. Sure, anyone who’d been cursed—it sounded like this witch cursed a
"It'd be easier if I could get outside," Iron Man grunted, knocking another Hydra agent away. "The suit's a bit heavy for fighting on the ground this close to everyone." When Iron Man turned and put a heavy armored hand on his shoulder, saying, "duck," he listened. "Barnes," Iron Man shouted, blasting a couple Hydra agents away from Bucky over Steve's shoulder.
“I need to know what’s going on, Peggy,” Steve insisted, following his wife to another room. The headaches were getting worse, and when he’d mentioned hearing voices she completely freaked out on him. But that wasn’t all—he was seeing things again. The numbers, the way that things would just, stop, and repeat a second of time back again like that was
“I’m still sorry that it took a whole week to track you down,” Peggy said. Yeah, a week after he’d crashed the plane, they’d found him frozen in the ice. Peggy had been devastated, but he’d healed up pretty quickly. And after that… Things had been wonderful.
“No, it wasn’t your fault,” Natasha said quickly. “It was ours, we all just assumed. We should’ve known you wouldn’t be joking around about this. And I would definitely understand if you didn’t want to see us around the tower for a little while—”
Today wasn't a normal day. When he glanced around, still gripping Steve's hand because he was usually so nervous about being out in public, he noticed that people either just weren't staring at them, or they were just slightly smiling as they walked past. Huh. He wasn't used to the lack of attention—it was
"Steve Rogers, I presume?" the man in the suit asked, and he nodded slowly. "I thought that looked like a portal. Sit tight, we need to just stop these DoomBots, then you're coming back to the mansion with us. Man, it seems like the multiverse is getting split every other week by now."
"Anytime," Stark laughed, while Captain America raced over to grab his sketchbook, tearing off the page.
that Steve couldn’t help the tears that came to his eyes. He then leaned up and kissed him again, more passionate this time. “I’ll see you once these stones are back. Someone’s gonna need to carry you off to the doctor, huh?”
"I'm pretty sure the battle isn't taking place anywhere near the park, so everything should be completely safe over there," his husband continued. Tony looked over at him, raising an eyebrow. "We're going out, Tony. You
"I'll just need to finish hooking up the power," Tony said, handing Clint a bottle that he must've picked up at some point in time. The archer looked around when he heard a noise, and it took him a few moments to figure out that someone was knocking on the door. He walked over, looking back and forth between the glass in his left hand and the bottle in his right hand before he managed to open the door.
he was sick of that—screamed and panicked as flames started circling around the walls, catching fire far quicker than it should have.
that he’d said any of that to the Skrulls. In fact, he was pretty sure that the Skrulls didn’t even know that he and Steve were dating. They’d never tried to use it against him, so he just figured they didn’t know. It wasn’t like it was public knowledge just yet. Tony wasn’t planning on announcing it until they’d been dating for, like, two years or something.
But Steve didn’t answer him. Once he was sure that Tony wasn’t going to be running back into the room anytime soon, Bucky turned the monitor on with the volume on low, needing to make sure that his friend was okay. When he turned the monitor on, though… It was just like before. Three kids, fourth on the way, a happy life with Peggy.
"Tony?" The brunet looked over at his boyfriend in confusion. "You're making weird faces again. There's something wrong, I
Sometimes… sometimes it can end in hope, in love, in future promises and soft laughter and gentle smiles. Sometimes an ending can be a beginning.
The best thing about having gotten used to it meant that he wasn't stressing about any of it, and because he wasn't stressing about it, he wasn't snapping at his team anymore. As the team relaxed, the teasing started up a little and Tony was able to joke around with his team. Steve also seemed more relaxed—the first time someone tried teasing Tony about the situation, he looked like he was going to murder them in their sleep, up until the point where Tony laughed and gave a smart reply back. He'd missed the lightheartedness of joking around with his teammates.
Before he was able to tell Steve not to turn around, his super-soldier was hugging him tightly and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
His husband was still so beautiful. When Tony looked at him, his heart still skipped a beat, his face still flushed, and he still wanted nothing more than to be by Steve's side. That's all he'd ever wanted—the chance to make the other man as happy as Steve made him. It was wonderful. But after seeing himself in the mirror... he really wouldn't blame Steve for waiting until they were back to normal to be by his side.
did. But Bucky knew Steve like most others didn’t, he knew things about Steve that even Tony didn’t know.
"I don't know," Steve mumbled, but he couldn't take his eyes off of Stark. "I... I need to get home. I need to find Tony, and make sure he's okay, and—"
He wasn't sure why Tony didn't want to be intimate. At least, at first. He'd suspected that maybe he was worried about getting aroused, seeing as Steve wasn't exactly a super-soldier anymore. And then he found out that Tony was ashamed of his
God, he should’ve known that they weren't after Steve. Of course they were after him! Who wouldn't want to kidnap the guy who funded the Avengers? Obviously he's got a bunch of money, and someone might want to pay to get him back... though perhaps not, perhaps the Avengers would be better without him. They'd be in control of all of the money, and they wouldn’t have Iron Man getting in the way and disobeying orders...
"It's okay... I don't know what we said, but everything's okay here, Tony, it's okay," Rogers murmured, and Tony leaned against him. Steve had been the one who'd helped him with his panic attacks, getting him to take deep breaths. Even this world's Stark put a hand on his shoulder, murmuring something to Wilson that got him to leave the room.
Tony just shrugged. Steve sighed, gripping his hand a little tighter before he pulled, and Tony got up and came closer. Steve captured his teammate in a hug, pulling him down onto the bed.
“I talk with Clint about a lot of stuff… but I think that one of the last things we discussed that he didn’t get to hear about was when you were redesigning the arm, and I was down in the lab with you, and I was making a bunch of suggestions about
Bruce seemed to understand what he was suggesting as he politely excused himself from the room. Tony gingerly climbed up onto the bed and stretched out, giving his super-soldier the best puppy-dog eyes he could. Steve just chuckled and climbed up onto the bed, curling around him while making sure not to hurt him.
When someone grabbed him, he tried weakly to fight back again—he wasn't going to let these people take him,
Something inside him felt like it broke. One of the first things he'd said to Tony, before ever getting to know him, was something
"I didn't even consider the possibility... I thought you were safe, here, and I wouldn't be worrying about you on the battlefield... but I
"I knew I liked this guy," Stark chuckled, glancing over at Clint for a second before raising an eyebrow. Tony shook his head. He couldn't tell Clint, not yet. He'd figure out how to tell his team eventually, but now was definitely not the time. "So, now that your portal's up and working, and I've got all the readings I need on where you're from, either you can bring your Steve back here, or we can come visit you, because I'm not going to forget about our deal."
able to hear him. Sure, the super-soldier had said that, but now he was completely sure that it was true. Steve knew the name Peter, he knew that he was the orphan who needed a family.
Tony couldn't help but smile a little at the thought of being able to work with the broken technology. He could make it better, far better than anything than anything that Hydra could ever make. He stood up, yawning as he stretched.
“Back off,” Steve growled, pointing the sword at the man as he slowly backed up towards Tony. “Come on, we’re getting out of here. This is
But even behind that happiness, Steve knew that this wasn't the end of Tony's insecurities, and he did intend to find out the real reasons to why Tony didn't want to share being Iron Man. There was something more, something that he didn't want to tell everyone, but maybe... maybe he'd be willing to give Steve a chance with that knowledge.
Carefully weaving his way through the crowd, Steve headed towards the center where the ritual was going to take place. He’d been ignoring everything that the guy had been saying—something about curing people through death and saving the world—up until the point where he lifted a large sword into the air.
They stood in silence for a while before Tony glanced down at the suit. "I should check if the team's still okay—I've got some backup comms. in the suit." Opening a hidden section, Tony handed Steve an earpiece, which he promptly turned on. Tony got himself back into the suit. "Everyone okay?"
He loved it. Every second of having a family was just incredible, something he wasn’t sure that Peggy would ever want. But then she just suddenly changed her mind and they started a family and he
Tony nodded. There was nothing except for love in those gorgeous eyes of his. He was home, and he was home to stay.
his family? He needed to see them, he’d never been away from them for so long… how long had it been since he’d last seen them? A few days? A few weeks? Months?
Tony had talked with Bucky and suggested that they let Steve have both of them, and they work on their own relationship—whether it was just a good friendship or it led to dating, it hadn't been all too important in the beginning. So they suggested the idea to Steve, promised that everything would be okay, and then the three of them went off to Malibu for a while to try to build their relationship. (And anyway, S.H.I.E.L.D. had missions on the west coast for them, so it all worked out.)
“The ritual’s starting,” the guy replied, looking far too eager for whatever was going to happen. “Those beasts keep coming back here, and the more we get rid of them, the less power that witch has over this place.”
it was different. He never had to worry about his lover hurting him, not like that past lovers had. Steve would never hit him or try to choke him or—
He slowly nodded before leaving the room. She was hiding something, yes, but she was right: their children did need him. But that didn’t change the whispered promises of love and the lingering taste of blueberries.
short. But now that I have the serum... I'm going to get a long and happy life with you and the team, and then... and then I'm still going to be here. I don't think I can do that alone, Tony, I..."
was because of his enhanced hearing. The slight, pained inhale from Bucky let him know that he’d heard it, too.
"I missed you too, punk," Bucky said, sighing. "I just... keepin' a lid on the Winter Soldier is tough. I think I've got it now... but I need you to lock me up if I lose it. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore, Steve, I
The world was a blur of yellow, orange and red, swirling around as his head rolled until it found Steve's chest. If he could just keep his head here... Those drugs were too much. He wished that he'd been quicker before, so he would never have gotten drugged in the first place. The heat was causing sweat to drip down in his face, nearly blinding him, causing the colors to blur even more.
Could… could he have mentioned something to Clint before he left, something that caused the archer to laugh instead of congratulate him?
Bruce's hair was a wild mess of tangles, and there were bags under his wide, bright eyes. If anyone tried describing 'mad scientist,' they'd be conjuring up an image of his teammate at the moment. Had he even
"Where am I?" Tony asked, scooting over towards him while casting a wary glance at the other guy in the room, who'd crossed his arms. He looked a bit disappointed, but not really surprised at all.
Once all of the ‘groomsmaids’ and groomsmen were all on either side, Tony turned his attention back to the doorway. There were only two people left, after all.
This time, the swirling colors didn't spin him around in circles, or drop him through the air for him to apparently land on a car. This time, he ended up right there in the lab, with Clint beside him and Bruce a few steps away. The other scientist raced over to make sure that Tony was okay. Natasha stayed at the controls, shutting the machine down when Bruce told her to.
Clint chuckled, making sure his weapons were all loaded. "Yeah, but so can everyone. You can't be happy all the time."
“S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks we’re going to have an invasion on our hands,” Steve said. When Tony pressed the side of his head against Steve’s chest, he could hear the super-soldier’s strong heartbeat. It was comforting. “Like… a
"I've had some trouble breathing," Tony muttered, knowing that if Bruce found out that he had kept anything to himself after he'd sworn that he'd said
The bright golden light that had caused all of the problems in the first place filled the room again, and for a second Tony wanted to run into Steve's arms, to hold his husband tight just in case this was the last time that he'd get a chance to touch him, to hold him. Why hadn't he kissed him before Bruce turned the ray on? Why hadn't he said
"I wanted to tell people... I really did," Tony said, carefully stepping out of the suit. "But... I couldn't. A-are you sure you're not mad?"
"I mean.... it was impossible to hide it from me, and you didn't mean to send Steve to another universe, Clint and Natasha are spies so I wouldn't be surprised if they figured it out... And to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if Bucky knew, too," Bruce said, shrugging. "It's not that you're bad at keeping secrets—the media never figured it out, and you've been Iron Man for a
-father, a man he wanted to be nothing like. It wasn't his father telling him how worthless he was, it was someone that he hated. His father had never returned from war, and was still a good man in Steve's eyes. Tony never had a good father that he could think of when Howard was beating him because Howard
, his wife, his children, even himself. But in a split second, it was all gone, right back to normal.
"You didn't," Tony insisted, because it was true. Steve hadn't done anything wrong, not in the slightest. And even when the super-soldier
of his face, questioning and concerned. "And somehow you've only managed to frown the whole time we're walking home. Do your feet hurt? Want me to call a cab?"
"He was in the shower when I came down," he replied, happily accepting the coffee. Ah, sweet, sweet caffeine. Sure, he'd probably need at least two more cups to actually wake up, but it was a start.
where the town could’ve killed Tony. This was bad—and he couldn’t even contact his team! He was going to use the pub phone after he lost his along the way…
"Good," Steve murmured, handing the both of them some towels so they weren't eating grease and oil. "I was a bit worried... that you two wouldn't be able to be in the same room together."
“Looking good, котенок,” Natasha whispered when she hugged him. There were tears in her eyes, which really surprised Tony, but he didn’t mention it.
He could only imagine the smile that would cross Tony's face, behind that mask. "Yeah, let's finish this."
“I told them that they couldn’t just kill anyone who was cursed… they just need some time.” He smiled and petted the werewolf like he was an overgrown dog. It was getting harder and harder to concentrate with the drugs that were getting dripped into him via the IV. “We’ll help you with this, Tony, I promise…”
"Whoa, hey, calm down," the young man said, holding up his hands in surprise. The young man was in red and white costume, and while he did look like a super
“If you hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t be here to do this,” Steve pointed out, wincing and groaning as he tried to move his arm.
The debate on whether or not he should go upstairs was a hard one. He needed food, and he needed water, and he was sure that his teammates were
"I think it's more about Steve than you're willing to admit," Bucky said, and Tony couldn't help but look up at him, an eyebrow raised.
"Do I look okay to you?" It wasn't like he was trying to be mean to his team, but he was pretty annoyed by the whole situation. No, he wasn't okay. He was eighty-something when he should've been about fifty years younger. It wasn't fair.
skilled and very capable, and neither of them really had anything to worry about. They'd do perfectly fine without either of them for a few days—hopefully less.
, Tony wanted to point out. But no, Clint had had a really rough time when the team first formed because he
hit the triple digits," Clint said, grabbing Bucky's arm before he started to pull the other super-soldier away. "So hey, glad you two are young again, but we've, uh, got something to do, um,
“I promise,” Natasha swore, kissing his forehead before she stood up and put the wristband on. “I’ll see you both soon.”
"...Is Tony here?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow. "And should you really be drinking all that in the lab? You might hurt yourself."
Steve seemed to be the only one who understood that, though, as he excused himself from the table a lot earlier than normal, claiming to be tired before asking Tony to come with him. He didn't see that his husband was just trying to get them away from the table, so at first he was confused and reluctantly agreed to go with Steve, expecting to be heading over towards their bedroom.
"Steve," Bucky gasped, clinging to the super-soldier after he'd ripped off the chains. "You're alive! God, you're alive. I knew you were... b-but they kept telling me you weren't—you took a plane down, you were found dead, t-they just..."
... "I know that you're probably not going to be in the mood, but maybe later tonight, when we get to bed—"
better. Chances were, he wasn't going to go Winder Soldier on anyone, and they'd be able to figure out what happened to Barnes, and how to fix him. Tony couldn't help but look over at his arm again—he wanted
“Thank you,” Tony said, snuggling back up into his chair. He kept ahold of one of Steve’s hands and pressed a kiss to his palm. They were going to start a family… and there was still a chance that they would. All Steve had to do was wake up.
The giant hole in the side of the plane took Steve right back to the moment when he was on the train, reaching for Bucky, trying to save his friend and ultimately being unable to do so. It sent him into a panic, making sure that he put himself between Bucky and that gaping hole in the metal. The air pressure was already nearly enough to send them out, but Steve was prepared for that.
This world's Thor was a bit different than his own, of course, with the first part being the fact that Thor actually lived at the tower. In his world, Thor went back and forth from Asgard to visiting Jane, only stopping by for visits or if the world was going to be destroyed. Now, that didn't mean that he didn't like Thor, because he
looking for you to actually get you back to the tower. I don't think that's fair, not with how many times I've managed to track you down."
That's why they were here. A date. It had taken him forever to get ready for this date. He'd even gotten a brand new crisp white suit, just for the occasion. He wanted to look absolutely perfect, making sure that his face was well trimmed, his hair styled with just the right amount of gel, and the cologne he chose wasn't too overpowering. After all, he hadn't been on a real date in a long time, especially not after becoming Iron Man.
“You guys… you’re still alive,” he gasped, reaching out with one arm to grip Bucky’s hand. “He said… he said you were all dead, that I didn’t escape fast enough, that I… that I lost all of you.”
It wasn't until the invisible light started swirling, looking more like a large colorful doorway, when Tony knew that his team was here for him.
"If something happens, I want you to lock me up right away," Bucky said. He hadn't once looked over at Tony yet, and he wondered if he was ever going to. The man had barely looked at
“I’ll check the monitor, maybe see if it can clue us in on what’s going on,” Bucky said, sounding just as nervous as Tony felt. The real issue came when Bucky pressed the button to turn the screen on. The screen
hated the way that he looked, why didn't Steve? Plus, if he'd asked for a separate room, then he would've seen the hurt look on his husband's face that would've meant that Steve was blaming himself for that.
"I'm going to do better, Tony, I promise," Steve whispered, kissing his forehead before setting him down onto their bed. Better? What did he mean by he'd do better? He'd never had someone who cared about him as much as Steve did—in the past, his relationships hadn't always been very good. Sometimes they'd turned a bit abusive, sometimes the person was just using him for his money or fame or
," stupid drugs, making him too honest, "I'm real glad you did... 'cause I really like you, Steve, and I still can't believe you like me, too."
“There’s this little boy,” Tony said cautiously, not wanting to sound desperate. “He’s four years old. Originally they weren’t even going to consider us until a little later, some other people have applied earlier, but… Due to some trauma in his life, he’s developed some mutant abilities far earlier than he ever should have, and I know he’s had some trouble controlling them. They don’t think placing him in a foster family would be a smart decision.”
Tony nodded. Of course—he’d walk first and wait at the end of the aisle for his to-be-husband to join him. But before Steve, in his white suit, could walk down the aisle, the rest of his team would be there. While they didn’t exactly have ‘bridesmaids’ and ‘groomsmen’ as both were grooms, they had decided who would be standing by who, with four people on each side.
Having Steve there, grounding him, was enough. Steve would never need to know just how well he knew the man, he wouldn't need to know about the secrets that kept them apart. The super-soldier continued whispering sweet nothings about how everything was going to be okay, about how they'd stopped the kidnappers from the fire who were now being interrogated by S.H.I.E.L.D.
"Tony," Steve gasped, and for a second he thought that the blond was horrified. Why wouldn't he be? Tony saw himself in the mirror, he couldn't blame Steve for his reaction. But then his husband was hugging him—not with the same strength that he used to have, Tony noted—and murmuring, "I was hoping you'd come out of the lab eventually, I hate it when you lock me out. Are you okay? Are you hurt? You didn't let S.H.I.E.L.D. make sure you were okay."
wake up. One day he’ll beat that program, and he’ll come back to us. And I just have to be patient until then, because if I’m not, I’ll only hurt him—and that’s the last thing that I’d ever want to do.”
," Steve muttered, because he knew he couldn't deny that. Sure, the serum was supposed to make his body as close to the peak of human perfect as it could, and it did a wonderful job at that. "But... I'm just some kid from Brooklyn. I'm not all that smart, I've been struggling enough with the new century, and the both of you have always been there for me, but... I was a nobody until I was Captain America—and it wasn't like I
"For the past couple weeks," Tony said. At least some things didn't change between different dimensions. Knowing that things were working out in this dimension made him feel better about his own relationship with his own Steve. After all, if they were together in multiple universes, then perhaps they really
Everyone went quiet when suddenly Tony was glowing bright blue and floating a couple inches off the ground. The bird creatures had all been tied down and the centaur all quieted down when they saw Tony. The ropes around his wrists burned off.
,” he whispered. It had taken thirteen days to break him. Silent tears ran down Tony’s face. “Not after last time.”
For years he'd been alone. He'd been beaten and abandoned by his father at a young age, his brother started turning bad once they'd joined the circus, leaving the two to go their own separate ways, which just ended up with Clint becoming an assassin for hire with the skills that he'd picked up, while his brother became a thief and a villain. Sure, his path wasn't much better, but then he'd been given a second chance by Coulson, and he'd ended up as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
He didn't even get a chance to scream out for help, he was only able to reach a hand out towards Steve before the world became a rainbow swirl of energy. Tony felt like he was being turned around, upside down, in every direction. He felt like he was going to throw up, and it wasn't just because of the amount of alcohol he'd had. Because honestly, Clint had had
hours and I think it's time for a break. You two need more than just a little food—some rest would do you good."
feeling inside of him only got worse by the day, and he couldn’t stop thinking about the man with the brown eyes with gold flecks… Whenever he looked at Peggy, sometimes he saw
“Being around soldiers will make you think that sometimes,” Peggy said, giving him a quick kiss before going back to the other couch to continue reading to her children.
"At least see if Bruce can check on you," Steve said, gently taking his hand before he led him over to the elevator. On a normal day, Steve would've dragged him up the stairs, telling him about how much better it was for his health. Today was not a normal day. "I know you trust him with the reactor. Is it hurting you?"
It was so dark outside—the sun had sunk below the trees by now—and Steve just assumed that the werewolf had some sort of night vision as he didn’t trip at all. A couple of times he started snarling, and Steve wondered if it was at him or if there were other beasts in the forest that he was warning.
