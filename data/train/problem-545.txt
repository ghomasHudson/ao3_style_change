The mer smirked and sang while he watched : 'On an island I long to be, far beneath the shining surface of the sea. I hear the sound of the ocean wave on wave calling you who have turned away from home'
Thank you all for the kudos, I didn't expect so many! And big thanks to the two people who left a comment :-) x
Massive apologies to everyone reading for the fact I'm so bad at updating!! As a reader I do know how annoying it is to be enjoying something but the writer appears to have a summer home on mars where there is no signal so a decade passes between chapters! If it helps I will finish all my wips...I'm hoping to get them done before Xmas, or at least before next year...
Five days later John was back.
John's fingers gripped convulsively as if he were handling a stress ball, before relaxing and releasing as he felt Sherlock tense. "I'm sorry" he said as he stepped back, reluctantly letting his flat mate go.
ps just a short chapter today, more filler than plot...
John called but Sherlock did not re-surface so he had no choice but to head to town where he puzzled over why the merman hated him with such a passion.
"That's the third time you've casually lowered your paper to look at me. If being stuck here without a case brings out your homosexual leanings then go to the Diogenes and ask for the full treatment. I'll put a call in to Mycroft and tell him to find someone who looks like me" Sherlock smirked.
Startled Sherlock stopped singing "Mycroft! You-"
'I've been staying at my nan's but I leave tomorrow. What about you?'
John put away the shopping with a sigh as Sherlock swept out the door on a new case, flatmate forgotten about. Suddenly however he dramatically strode back in looking at John intently.
Mycroft cast a concerned eye on his pod, barely keeping in a sigh. His peoples days were numbered, they were running out of places to hide. The world was shrinking and so was his pod.
John had just started to reply that there was really no need when Sherlock dived with a splash, strong tail beating the water as he moved.
"I thought you might be. You have a kind face, reliable hands" the stranger took John's small but strong hands in his own cold elegant ones and placed them on his hips.
"Are you even listening John?"
John came almost every day after that and Sherlock's speech improved as did John's fishing skills.
“How do you know?” John tried to look at the body the way Sherlock would.
"So what do you think? She's a beauty isn't she?" John changed the subject, beaming at the shiny white cuddy. "I added the red stripe myself"
'There was a sound that night, like a lonely whale, and ever since folk avoid that loch if they can. Only people what want to drown themselves go there, only between you and me some older ones dunney believe they all drown themselves if you get my meaning'
John reluctantly agreed knowing himself to be woefully average compared to Sherlock, then again who wasn't?!
'I did nothing! She, how do you say? took her own life? I was trying...' Sherlock scrunched his face up in frustration as he tried to find the words. He swam over to John's boat and placed two fingers on his mouth before repeating the gesture on his own mouth.
It took a moment for John to react. “Alright. Why?”
Sherlock turned, still smiling to the man by his side. “This room. It’s clean. The floor, the walls, even the dirty dishes have no spills. Compare that to the rest of the house.” He waited for the light to switch on in John’s eyes.
Jesus, do you even hear yourself, you arrogant prick? You saw that. Some poor girl is being tortured and you say it’s unimportant? You utter monster.”
He sank back down into the chair, closing his fingers around Sherlock’s.  “Are you sure? You didn’t seem to –”
The walk from the morgue to the roadside was uneventful, the two men falling easily into their roles, playing off one another to create the perfect synchrony that somehow deflected intrusion.
“Well then. John, Sherlock, you take the back. Don’t care how you do it - you’ll cover more ground than us four.”
Thank you so much for reading!
But John Watson had moved on, and in doing so, he had almost undone all the careful work he had done to fix the shattered fragments of the man he had left. Almost. Sherlock clung to what remained. He still saw him at intervals. During cases, John would occasionally reappear from the family he had so carefully constructed around himself. But that was all. And it was never for long. As soon as the shadows began to stretch, John would head for home, returning to the warm comfort of the suburbs. And there was no post-case high without John. At least, not a legal one.
“Bart’s?”
“Does it help, being out here instead of bed?”
“It has to be a warehouse. The dirt analysis suggests Islington, but I’ll have to investigate the ease with which one could use a warehouse, abandoned or not, though I assume it is in use; there are traces of blood on the fabric of the toes that hold certain qualities alike to pig’s blood.”
It’s been four days since he last saw Sherlock. John stands in the bathroom, razor in hand, trying to forget the words burned onto his prefrontal cortex. There have been no picture, and no videos since then, and he feels like he’s playing a waiting game. He feels like a goddamn pawn in a game of chess made up of only queens.
. Just for a while, just to let the cloak of loneliness slip from his body. But it was not his place. The right belonged to someone else.
It wasn’t until a shining black cab pulled up to the curb that Sherlock broached the subject that lay heavy over his shoulders, pressing him down. “How’s Mary these days?”
John can’t help but feel the weight of the blame resting squarely on his shoulders. If Sherlock had trusted him enough, if John had been there like he should have been, then perhaps he would have known, perhaps Sherlock would have confided in him, rather than shutting him out. If he hadn’t reacted the way he had, yelling at Sherlock for turning away, then he would have been there when he was hurt, wouldn’t have let him be hurt in the first place.
Sherlock pulled a face. “I doubt it.”
The end is open to your own interpretation; are they together? Aren't they? It's up to you, but they remain each others' best friend regardless (as is the beauty of their friendship).
He can't argue, so he just shrugs. John is irritatingly good at calling him out on his lies these days. Before, when John's sign language was still clumsy, he had to watch Sherlock's hands, missing whatever expression was on Sherlock's face. These days, John is almost fluent, and rarely needs to see more than a peripheral to catch the gist of Sherlocks sign. They stand awkwardly for several seconds. John clearly wants to offer comfort, Sherlock clearly can't accept the wordless noises he would normally make in this situation. John's eyes tighten with determination.
They had to walk a short distance to find a cab that would take them to Scotland Yard; taxi drivers had the infuriating habit of avoiding crime scenes. Although, Sherlock supposed, John’s first case had rather proved that to be a valid idea. Unsurprisingly, it took only a few steps for John to begin his usual monologue. Sherlock played the disinterested machine, as always, while John described the oh-so-dreadful things about family life.
And in some ways, Sherlock could never forgive John for this. For so long, he’d been content to remain emotionless, detached from society and those he came into contact with.  And now he wanted more. He wanted some form of human interaction, some form of approval, and a way to feel without meaning to. And when he did see John, everything was better, for a few, shortened hours, until he was gone, once again.
Maybe he screams; he’s not sure, but the knife travels upwards until it rests against his jugular. There’s a hesitation then, a second when the cold edge that is millimetres from draining him dry feels like a lover’s breath on his neck. The man’s lips move again, a short sentence that could be him promising that he will in fact, do it, or a jibe to attempt Sherlock to talk.
“So you’re sure?”
Sherlock smirked. Now a semi-permanent fixture in John’s bed, he squirmed down under the covers, watching John with a pair of bright eyes. This early in the morning, the day was filled with potential.
Sherlock glared at Lestrade. “Yes. Man like that? No bleach in the house. Hard to destroy evidence with water.”
He shook his head. “Just don’t – look at me. Like that. It’s... I – I don’t know,” he breathed, squeezing his eyes closed.
As the sunlight began to push out the shadows, Sherlock began to stir, stretching his legs out in front of him with several satisfying sounding cracks. He groaned, letting his head fall back, loosening the muscles that had no doubt cramped as he slept in the awkward position in the chair. Noticing the tea left near his elbow, he twisted, looking at John over his shoulder. He said nothing, but smiled timidly, nodding to the tea in thanks.
The metal digs in, just a little, enough to cause beads of blood to well up along the string of the incision, before the knife moves away. It’s slashed downwards less than a second later, and Sherlock loses his vision for one, white hot eternity of pain, before the colours fade back in.
Something hard struck his face, causing his face to fall the opposite direction to the way that it had just been pulled. The hand returned, yanking his head back. There was a brief moment of delay, in which Sherlock’s heartbeat pounded in his ears, and he felt as though he could feel the blood gushing through his veins as his fight or flight response was triggered. Pain licked across his cheek as he was hit again, before the fabric was practically torn off his face, blunt nails digging into his scalp, bringing a few hairs with it.
“Dead body lying there,” John gasped between giggles, “and what do you do? You bloody poke it. The great Sherlock Holmes just
There was blood in his mouth, leaving a metallic taste that refused to faded, an ache in his bones that he could never stretch out, and a crawling over his skin that would not be shaken off. Lying on the floor like this, hands behind his back, on his front, he was on display, and they all knew it. It was only a matter of time. It was a waiting game, and one that was designed to make him lose his mind, to break him. It was a game that he would inevitably lose.
The blackness of the blindfold caused his heart to thump wildly.  Unable to see, he could not predict the movement of his captors, could not brace himself against the touch he was sure would come. The three men seemed to enjoy taking it in turn, each doing their worst, though Sherlock feared only one.
Where do we go from here?
He’s gorgeous like this, John thinks. High on the adrenalin provided by the metropolitan police, Sherlock is impossibly alive, eyes seeing everything all at once and brain processing more than the rest of the men and women that huddled around could even be thinking.
John’s mobile vibrates against his leg from where it sits in his pocket. He pulls it out with one hand, not really looking, too distracted by the way Sherlock’s coat frames his silhouette and he rises from his crouch. They make eye contact for a second, and John catches the almost-smile that Sherlock gives him, returning a full smile at the detective.
When he poured the water onto the dried leaves, a droplet caught itself on the rim, and threw itself off the opposite side, running down the plain, beige side of the ceramic like blood runs from a wound. Sherlock let it run, watching it come to its own end as it hit the countertop. He wondered how it felt. Did the water feel freedom as it ran, only for its efforts to be thwarted? Did it know how it would damage those left behind? How they would mourn? Did it expect to be mourned? Of course not. It’s a collection of molecules, the very things that make up the earth; it felt nothing. The questions that Sherlock aimed at its watery hide were turned internally. The counter was the pavement, and the droplet was Sherlock. The liquid that remained in the cup, slowly colouring from the leaves, were those he had left, those who had, against all odds, mourned him.
“Unimportant.
“Ignore it.”
Ah, yes. Staring at ex-flatmate obsessively may possibly fall into the ‘bit not good’ set of traits that Sherlock possessed. Deduction is good. What he does best. He tries, then, but John is right (as he is unsettlingly often when it comes to Sherlock), and he can only assume that either John’s big news is that he’s having Chinese takeout for dinner, or he’s missed something.
It was hair, caught in the catch of the window, accompanied by deep scratches in the wood of the sill. He rapped on the window to get John’s attention.
Sherlock nodded. “I am. She could put the old food back, but not the dirt. I’d wager that particular work of art took years.”
The previously white sheets were auburn with dried and drying blood. Although the body must have been lain unmoving for upwards of twelve hours, in some areas the viscous liquid still shone like fresh dew. In other parts, however, time had taken its toll and the blood had dehydrated, causing the sheets to crisp as if they had been starched.
John hummed once. “Been eating?”
“Stay.” It was whispered quietly enough that John nearly missed it.
“Would it help you to talk?”
When he returns, Sherlock’s parents have taken his place, not even looking up as he walks in. He doesn’t blame them; Sherlock looks like he could slip away any moment, although they have been assured that he is stable. He stands awkwardly by the door, feeling like an imposter, yet reluctant to leave.
The light shone off the white surfaces in the lab, where Sherlock perched in front of the microscope, fingers brushing the focus with an almost loving caress, entirely fixated with the enlarged particles that hovered, suspended like bees frozen in motion, in solution. His silent companion stood amicably by his side, scrolling absently through his phone, waiting for a signal from the taller man. When it came, they rose as a pair, soldiers once again in action.
“What? Make John fall out of his bed in the middle of the night?”
Throwing the violin down on the battered black leather of his chair, with the kind of tenderness that one might afford to a misbehaving child, Sherlock moved into the kitchen. His left hand trailed behind him, across the battered surface of the light wood table, feeling the memories carved into the wood, the way lovers might carve their initials onto tree bark, a permanent thought, left for a short eternity.
Looking back at the body, Sherlock batted John’s hands out of the way, ignoring the half-hearted protest as he lifted up the head, stiff with rigor mortis. His fingers found the exit wound through the bloody, matted hair easily enough, and yet there was no mark in the mattress.
John shrugged. Sherlock looked closer at the carpet. There was a square indentation in the worn carpet, held in place by dust and dirt. Looked a bit like a box, but the edges are soft, almost blurred. A bag. Most likely a cooler to keep the organs from becoming unusable or decaying.
“Yeah.” He sounded forlorn, curling his toes against the carpet.
“Yeah. Anyway, enough of this. CCTV.” He gestured at the screen, allowing Sherlock to push past him to access the computer screen.
Sherlock felt his body moving, could hear the sound of choked breath escaping from between parted lips, but he felt nothing. And yet, somewhere in the back of his mind he heard a voice. John’s voice.
The carpet that covered the bare planks of the floor was fading, exhausted after years of excited movement. Its delicate pattern had been worn away to a crude smudge, like a child’s clumsy drawing. Despite this, it was much loved. It was a token of sentiment, bought by one, kept by another for the intrinsic value it possessed. The rest of the room had remained much the same for the past five years, with one, vital exception. Most people would never be able to look around the room and pick out what was missing, simply because it was never a thing. It was a living, breathing, beautiful mishap of loyalty and anger and compassion and scars and unwavering determination.
to breathe.
As always, comments brighten my day, and I love reading them, so let me know how I've done - good or bad.
As he shivered from the cold that filled the room, eating away at his bones, a coarse palm grabbed his chin, jerking his head to the side. Sherlock gasped as the movement pulled at the muscles in his neck and shoulders. He waited, tense, attempting to judge what was about to happen.
His reply was a vague hum in the affirmative. He grinned; Sherlock sounded as if he was already half asleep. Hopefully up here, outside his own room, he might get some more sleep, speeding the rate of his recovery.
It wasn’t long after Sherlock’s gentle snores began that John drifted off.
John shook his head as Sherlock delved around in what appeared to be the girl’s underwear drawer, amazed at his total lack of reservation. Had it been anyone else, it would have been horrifically creepy, but with Sherlock, it was purely investigation. The sudden flurry of clear-wrapped drug parcels thrown his way were enough to derail his train of thought. As he juggled the drugs in his arms, Sherlock spotted something by the window, forgetting the dozen or so grams of powder.
“Kettle’s just boiled,” he sighed, not bothering to turn.
Then, just as quickly, the weight was gone. Sherlock cried out yet again as he was pulled from within him, shaking with the after effects and the pure, blind panic that was left behind.
Of course. It would be so easy to hide the spoils there. Hide the tree in the forest. “Yes, that’s… Yes. Good.”
He sighed, and heaved himself up into a sitting position. The dust that kicked up from the duvet swirled in front of the window, creating inane patterns in the air. John stretched, listening to his joints pop as they unfolded from their night rest.
Sherlock practically growls, reaching for the phone, but John is faster, pushing him aside. “Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why can you not just respond how normal people do for fucks sake? Get the hell out.”
He nodded, continuing to ascend the stairs, neither man mentioning the way he leaned into John’s touch as he climbed.
John frowned and crouched down to get a better view. “Looks like he put something heavy down here.”
So, what do you think? Do you like where the story is going? I thrive off comments; let me know!
As Sherlock let his mind loose from its cage, he began to see, noticing things he hadn’t whilst at the scene. Tiny pink threads under the fingernails; attempt at self defence. Remove with tweezers. Makeup smear along the underside of the jaw; romantic intent, prostitute looking even more likely. Bullet hole in the head, no bullet; still lodged in something of the victims back at the house.
“You to try and make me talk about it. Get me to go to therapy or something.”
Sherlock’s voice is quiet after the tone of his.“I am not ‘normal’ John, you know that.”
Sherlock’s phone.
Upon his arrival, Sherlock was gratified to find that an entire section of the street had been closed off, preventing any unsuspecting member of the public from trampling potentially damning evidence. Lestrade waited by the tape, looking exhausted already, while Donovan stood by his side, anxiously running her hand through her hair. Both looked as Sherlock stepped out of the taxi, handing the driver a twenty as he went.
With that, he was gone.
Sherlock was asleep in John’s chair when he came downstairs in the morning for tea. Sherlock’s limbs were curled underneath him, his feet resting on one arm, his head resting on the backrest. It looked bizarrely uncomfortable, but his face was peaceful. John left him alone, flicking the kettle on and making them both a mug of tea.
The detective and the blogger left side by side, leaving just a moment too early to see Molly stumble through the opposite door, juggling three steaming mugs.
Hopefully chapter 4 will be up roughly the same time next week.
and guides him back down into the bed, coming to crouch down by the side of it, so that Sherlock doesn't have to twist his neck to see him spell out his words.
Well, that was interesting. “Where?”
He holds his hand out for the phone. John’s angry, immoral and stupid side takes over.
“I don’t think – ” John begins.
Sherlock’s eyes drifted closed despite himself. He was too tired to even make an attempt at lip reading, and he shivered with exhaustion, before fighting to extract his hands from the duvet in which he was wrapped, making a slight grunt as he did so to catch John’s attention.
John hesitated only a moment, his thought process clearly written out across his expressive face. “Some sort of cooler for the organs.”
“Got anything, Sherlock?”
“Oh, hello,” she smiles benignly at the three men who have suddenly materialised in her workspace, “can I get you anything?”
His fault. His fault. Only his fault.
“Yes it is! You get me right on the edge of the bed with all your wriggling,” John smacked him with a pillow.
Having deposited the milk, Sherlock moved back into the living room, picking up his tea as he went. Leaving it carefully on the stained wooden side table by John’s chair, he bent to cradle his violin against his shoulder once more. Fingers stroked the neck softly, brushing the hairs, creating a soundless melody that resonated through Sherlock’s frame.
He shook his head, “You – I don’t want –” he broke off again, eyes closing.
He could feel the heat of Sherlock’s body from across the bed.
His fondness from the morning is gone, he realises. It could never have been strong, if this is enough to break it like the glass at John’s feet. Or perhaps it was too strong, and the fragments on the linoleum are testimony to the betrayal that thumps in John’s chest with each pulse of his heart.
They both know that the men that captured Sherlock were not the men that decided to do so. It's the invisible men, plucking strings, that Mycroft will find. For once, Sherlock is content to let Mycroft take care of it for him.
John smiled. “Yeah. Plus I get a six foot tall living blanket.”
The vibration of the phone on the wooden desk was loud in the silence, the only sound as slender hands reached out to read the message that lit up the screen.
Tea sloshes onto the coffee table as John puts it down; he's filled it too much, a habit he is wont to do when he's particularly distracted. He perches on the arm of the sofa and this is worse, Sherlock thinks, worse than the hospital. At least there they could avoid this, the awkward silences (though Sherlock can't hear it, he can see it, feel it in John's posture), both unwilling to be the first to speak.
Sherlock nodded, already moving downstairs, offering John the box to put the drugs in.
John’s warm hands nudged him back down, resting benignly on his chest as he lay back, comforting, rather than oppressing. He spoke briefly, before Sherlock was moved towards the ambulance.
“Mummy’s invited you to dinner on Friday,” Mycroft’s tone left no doubt that Sherlock would be attending, willing or no.
Sherlock placed his own mug gently down on the counter before taking the short corridor to his bedroom. The armoire that stood by the open window was already cracked, exposing its inside to the room. A selection of suit jackets hung, suspended, with their corresponding trousers folded over the bar of the hanger. Absently trailing the long fingers of one pale hand across the expensive material woven to create the dark pieces that filled the wardrobe, Sherlock selected on one at random, tugging it free of its peers.
“Anyway, how’ve you been?”
Fresh tally marks carved alongside the old ones, Sherlock let his head fall forward, not even noticing the salt water dripping onto fresh wounds. It was shameful, how little he was capable of handling. He couldn’t even control his own emotions any more. The one thing he had was gone, and now his whole world was crashing down around him, tearing down the walls of his mind palace, burning the prison in which he kept his heart.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock nodded mutely.
Moving forward with his shorter shadow, Sherlock confirmed with a glance that this was the same car that he had seen in the CCTV footage, though the previously sleek paintwork had peeled back to reveal its bare components. It almost looked as if it could have been his brother’s commandeered vessel, had it not been for the cheaper upholstery interior. The evidence of an attempted fire was clear inside; black soot smudges licked over the beige roof, charcoal settled over the seats, not fully hiding the clothes that were piled there. Sherlock took a bag from his pocket, followed by a penknife. Reaching into the car he extracted the object of his focus with ease. A high heeled shoe. Probably red when bought, but now brown through wear and damage. Dirt was still visible on the point, caked around up the heel. A veritable goldmine of clues. Continuing to search the smoky dashboard and backseats yielded little, although Sherlock did find an unopened packet of cigarettes, which he pocketed.
Sherlock smiled as the town folk came in view. If that's what it took to bring John to him, he would drown the world.
'Hello'
Despite the time he spent with the mer John still felt a delicious shiver of fear at the question.
TEXT TO: JOHN WATSON
I'm going with the idea that while they can and do eat, they need human life force/energy from humans (obtained through a kiss) to actually survive-like the cat things in Stephen kings sleepwalkers if anyone has seen that?
“Er...” John looked baffled by the seemingly random nonsense his flatmate was spouting.
"Are you trying to kill the entire town brother mine?! You must learn to exercise some control over the song..." Mycroft outwardly scoffed while thinking quite the opposite.
The fight seemed to last an age, and as much as John wanted to see the outcome he struck out for land. He had almost made the waters edge when he heard a scream and an angry chittering similar to dolphin clicks. He turned around and saw Mycroft and a small group swimming away, water turning pink in his wake.
"Yes" Sherlock immediately replied thinking of feeding. First feeding, then satisfying curiosity.
"That place in Camden that closed a couple of years back? I might have, not socially though!" Sherlock looked aghast at the very thought.
"Aah" John hissed as he held his head.
So he did the only thing he could think of; he put it in his giant old claw footed tub and examined it.
'Yeah I think I'll be off too' John agreed, grabbing his cane before hoisting himself out of his snug booth
With a tut Mycroft motioned to them to slowly submerge while the bewildered humans snapped out of their trance and made their way back to their homes.
John froze and Sherlock looked put out. He flicked his tail like an angry cat then smiled as he remembered what to do. He swam slow circles around the human singing and humming all the while until this time when he repeated the question John answered yes.
He let out his mournful whale like sound at the thought.
"Its always been there John, you are just shockingly unobservant" Sherlock informed him scathingly. "It happens to be where I sleep if you must know; no cosy cave in the blue waters of the Mediterranean for me"
Whatever inclined him to offer John a position as his flatmate, it was definitely not, in any way, based in logic.
"Yeah?" He asked after a beat.
"Sh-Sherlock. Faster, please." John breathed, nearly begging.
"Is that what you think of me, then? That I only date for the sex?" He asked testily, shifting on his feet. Sherlock stood up and moved into John's space.
Sherlock shifted closer to John on the couch and soon their thighs were touching through the fabric of their trousers.
"I killed you." Sherlock said, and he said it with a false calm that sort of terrified John more than anything else would have.
"John." He said, and it carried that tone that only Sherlock used on him.
"I understand." John said with a soft chuckle. "I'm not completely daft." He said, pulling on a pair of latex gloves.
"Next time I was thinking latex gloves. Perhaps you could wear a pair as well?" Sherlock suggested, rubbing John's arm lightly through the fabric of the blanket.
Sherlock laughed and shook his head. "I feel that this fits into the same category as what we are trying to do, but by all means, go on."
John wondered then, briefly, where this was going. Of course, he understood the endgame, but now? What on earth was Sherlock doing?
Then, John's face lit up, which Sherlock knew meant John had an idea. He looked at Sherlock a moment longer before scurrying off to the kitchen.
"It was..." John was rather entranced, watching Sherlock taste him in such a way, so it took a measure for him to think of a proper reply.
"C-close." John breathed out, trying hard not to thrust into Sherlock's hand. It didn't quite work out.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Oh, please. Name one of your girlfriends that you didn't have sex with." He asked, eyes narrowed. John frowned deeply.
In no time at all Sherlock was coming over his glove with a half-bitten back moan. He took a moment to get his breath back before he pulled off his glove gingerly and looked over John.
He looked quite undone, and Sherlock had to admit that he loved the sight. "I will be right back." He assured, standing up. He tucked himself back in and straightened his wrinkled clothes before he crossed the room to the kitchen.
John reached to grip Sherlock's shoulder desperately when he felt a gloved hand wrap around his cock.
John took a breath to calm himself before meeting Sherlock's eyes. He felt slightly foolish, but he wanted to see if it would work.
Sherlock didn't emerge from his room for quite some time, though John was fairly sure he hadn't slept the entire time. He noted that Sherlock was, however, already completely dressed, even down to his gloves.
"How was that?" Sherlock asked, licking the semen off of his glove as he looked at John.
"I'd be happy to try something with you, Sherlock." John replied, watching Sherlock's hand rub slowly and methodically over his thigh.
Sherlock pushed aside the feeling of foolishness that came with his trousers down around his legs, and looked at John's expression.
"I killed you, because that's what happens when I touch people." He growled. John blinked, pulling back just a little.
Sherlock made note of that before he began to stroke John a tad faster. He experimented a bit, trying different pressures and speeds to see what drew out the best reaction from John.
Sherlock looked over John with a little smirk, reaching to cup him through his trousers. He rubbed him like that for a moment before he undid John's trousers slowly.
He then finally dragged his hand downward, skilled fingers landing on John's belt. Sherlock made quick work of all the fastenings on John's trousers so he could then start the main component of the experiment.
John took Sherlock's hand with his clean one and pressed a few kisses to his knuckles while the man came down. He pulled of the soiled glove and set it on the bedside table, quickly replacing it with a clean one.
John leaned into the touch before he swatted Sherlock's hand away. "Enough of that. We're trying to do something here."
John felt like an insect, pinned down for study by something far greater than himself. But he also knew that he didn't mind it. Which was probably not normal.
John was sure he had never seen anything quite as beautiful.
"I think it would be a good idea, yes. But obviously it isn't necessary." John replied.
It hadn't been an immediate problem, really, since he'd kept to himself for the longest time. And then, when he'd finally made an actual friend, someone he trusted, someone he felt actually cared, he'd killed him.
He stood up quickly and absolutely tackled John to the floor just as a shot rang out and shards of glass went flying.
He undid the zip of Sherlock's trousers and ran a hand down the middle of Sherlock's exposed torso, even following down to his happy trail.
Sherlock looked extremely offended, which only further proved his point, in John's opinion.
He then held up the plastic wrap to Sherlock and kissed Sherlock through it. It was an odd sensation to say the least, but he could feel Sherlock's warmth through the thin layer, and better yet, he wasn't dead.
"I am relaxed." John assured him, even giving a little smile.
After quite a bit more studying, Sherlock finally began to fullfil the ultimate purpose of this little interaction with John.
"I know how it sounds. I've tried very hard to figure it out, John. But it just... Is." John nodded slowly, trying to comprehend it.
"Come here, John." Sherlock said, nodding to the other end of the couch. John looked at Sherlock for a moment before obligingly moving to sit on the other end of the couch.
That is, until he met John Watson.
John was practically whimpering as he approached his climax. He hadn't done anything since that time with Sherlock in the alley, and that was too bloody long ago.
“Oh.” John passed the tissue to Sherlock, who tied the condom and tossed it, rather disgustingly, onto the floor before wiping himself down.
He lifted his hand and stroked over his own head, feeling how smooth it was. He sat up, and John let him. John also let him switch their positions so that John’s head was leaning against his own shoulder. Then John let him start returning the favour in the best way he knew how; with his tongue. It was weird, but far too sweet for him to put a stop to it.
“That’s because you’re still traumatised, and I’m doing my best to compensate for that,” Sherlock explained, and he kissed John’s head again.
“I don’t understand,” John insisted, sitting up a bit. He saw Moran’s gaze sweep over him, and a tiny bubble of victory rose in his chest – at least he’d made him think twice. Perhaps there was hope after all.
“I’d prefer somewhere new,” Sherlock said, raising his eyebrows, “but I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you. I only planned a whole date and saved your life a few times, it’s no big deal.”
The other two were a piece of cake, even from where John was standing. It was like watching something out of a cartoon as they took blind swings at Sherlock and ended up punching each other in the face. John wheezed a little huff of a laugh and dragged himself up from the floor. Sherlock was sat on one of the boys and was holding the other down until his partner was ready to take a seat on him, too.
John glanced down at Sherlock’s crotch and blushed slightly. His own groin had managed to keep itself contained, apparently. “I didn’t mean to. Is that okay?”
“Sherlock,” John said incredulously. He sat up, sliding along the sofa until he was closer to Sherlock. “I just told you, I can make my own decisions. I knew what I was doing then and I know what I’m doing now, and this is what I want. Trust me. And put those bloody magazines in the bin.” John put out his leg and shoved the pile over.
Still, he started where he thought it had been and worked forwards. Then, when he’d gone far enough, he went right and swept back to the cottage. It was only when he searched left that he made any progress.
“Why not?” Sherlock shot back. There had to be a reason.
“Are you in any bad pain?” he asked, and John closed his eyes and shook his head. “Okay. Just call me if you are, or if you run out of bowls. I’ll ask someone to offer breakfast around in about half an hour.”
“Wait,” he demanded, grabbing hold of the railing and pulling it back, “I need to go with him. I’m his boyfriend. He needs me, he won’t keep still without me.”
“Bloody hell, Sherlock. Not that shit again.”
John replaced his cold mug with a hot one, placing the cold in the sink before taking his own from the side. Sherlock left it to cool for a few more minutes, remaining still and quiet on the sofa. He heard John blowing out a noisy breath as he looked through the stack of those damned newspapers on the table. When he found the one he wanted there was a tell-tale rustling of cloth on cloth as he sat down in his chair. People were so noisy.
Both lay there panting for a few minutes, enjoying the warm skin pressed against theirs and basking in the spikes of orgasm still running through their veins.
“John,” he blurted, making both himself and the faun jump. He cleared his throat awkwardly and tapped his chest. “John.”
Sherlock gave him a sidelong glance, a slight squint at his eyes. “Is that a romantic gesture or a lazy suggestion?”
“Sherlock,” he rasped, reaching with his bad hand to pat him on the arm. He had his attention immediately. “Where’s Harry?”
The oafs didn’t seem to hesitate, this time, before letting her go. Harriet glared fiercely at both of them, brushing herself and her dirty clothes down as John continued.
“When?”
Back then, every day mattered. Now they were all merging into one insufferably long and repetitive one. He hated it.
Two buses later they were en route to the closest side of Hackney, John all snug and bundled in the corner of the back bench and Sherlock settled in next to him. The sour look on his face was the greatest thing John had ever seen.
“No, no. Keep still, that’s it. Really still.”
“How?” Sherlock pressed.
Then the guilt set in. Maybe today hadn’t been the best day to start off a… A whatever it was, with Sherlock. This was supposed to be a peaceful day of remembering loved ones, thanking the fallen, and here he was ignoring his own past and everyone else’s by sleeping with his flatmate. At least, he was classing it as sleeping with him.
After the interview John was told to wait in the room, but he hadn’t been told why. Being honest, he wasn’t really thinking about that part of things when he had bigger problems to worry about.
“Keep that test.”
Sherlock hesitated for a second before leaning in and kissing John’s forehead gently. “It
, God, you’re so… tight around me.” He took John’s lips into a hard kiss and thrust faster and harder still, causing John to moan embarrassingly loud and dig his nails into his back.
“A sandwich will be fine, thanks. Whatever you’re having. I’m not fussy.” Sherlock collected his magazine from where it had been chucked onto the floor earlier that day and then settled back on the sofa, sitting up this time.
“Can we go to a bedroom?” John asked, pulling back slightly. Sherlock looked completely wrecked already. He licked his lips. “It’ll be easier in a bedroom.”
Once his inspection was done, John stood up. When had he ever knelt so close in the first place? He took a few steps back and remembered the head wound. Yes. Right. He had work to do.
“What d’you think happened?” John sighed. Sherlock had pulled out his phone to let them talk it through without distraction. “Dad’s just… not well.” Not a complete lie, was it?
“Yez,” it repeated, looking up to John for approval. “Yes. Human yes.”
To John, the whole thing had been a purring wall of noise. “I don’t understand.”
Sebastian offered an empty smile. “Okay. I’ll explain it simply for you.” He settled his hands on his stomach. “I put your face on that photo and sent it to the police.”
“Where you look casual, I look underdressed. You can get away with overdressed, but I can’t get away with underdressed. Not with this face.”
“Thanks,” John murmured awkwardly, stepping past him and beginning up the stairs as he closed the door quietly behind them. Sherlock didn’t say anything but he could hear him following him up. The silence drifted on between them as they took their coats off and hung them up.
Every single bloody afternoon for the past week I've thought "Oh, better upload chapter three tonight." Did I remember? No.
John almost gasped audibly when he heard the words. He heard silence on the other end – perhaps his dad was just as shocked at the revelation as he was. Fresh tears rolled down his cheeks at the prospect that maybe he father was finally beginning to realise how badly John was affected.
“Police,” Sherlock hissed, his heart hammering in his chest. “Police, and an ambulance. Both. My friend, he’s been attacked, he’s unconscious. There’s blood.”
“John?”
"I tell you what, I could get some very realistic scuffs on my knuckles right now." John glared at him.
The afternoon passed easily. They ate their sandwiches together in front of the TV, John’s leg occasionally brushing Sherlock’s as he shifted around. Sherlock, on his part, wasn’t really sure of their boundaries yet – were they allowed to be sitting this close? Would it have been okay for him to put his arm over John’s shoulders and pull his head down to rest on his shoulder? Would John have minded if he rested his hand on his thigh? He resolved to consult the magazines after lunch, sure that he’d seen questions like that in them before.
“Your face is fine, John,” Sherlock muttered. “Have you seen mine?”
“That’s… That’s gross,” John frowned, rubbing at his hair again. It was strange how it felt just like a cat had licked it – bone dry and combed through from the sandpaper tongue. Again, Fawnlock didn’t understand.
John was woken the next morning by what sounded suspiciously similar to a glass breaking. He sat up in bed, his first thought
“Go on, then. What do you want to do with him?” Sebastian.
“You want to make a deal, I get that, but what deal? What could I ever give you?” John’s heart was speeding up again as he saw Jim lick his lips and lean forwards a little more. “I don’t have anything. I swear I don’t have anything.”
“I don’t know what you’re so concerned about, you’ve taken down much worse than teenagers,” Sherlock pointed out, standing up and assessing John again. “Cross your arms for a moment. No, keep your legs straight and firm, just cross your arms.”
“Of course,” he replied, pulling his lapel out for John to see.
You would give the shirt off your fucking back for people, and everyone knows it. You’re the one that should’ve gotten the posh university money, and gotten the proper education, not me. So if you want to be a doctor, forget about Dad, and go and be a doctor. If that’s what you want, I’ll do what I can to help, even if it means stealing you some proper books to read.” She smiled. “One of us has to turn out decent, John, and I’d rather it be you.”
It was surreal, actually, how much danger managed to find them that night. John knew it was a bad area but, well, that bad? He hadn't thought so. Everywhere had its ups and downs but being a victim of two muggings, two drug deals gone wrong, and an armed robbery in one night was definitely a first for him. He didn’t remember how, but at some point over the course of the evening he’d lost his drink, and he only realised when they were already walking back towards the bus stop they’d come from.
John looked up at him and smiled. Then, placing the menu until it was blocking the rest of the restaurant, he leaned down and rested his chin on his hands. Under the safety of the cover the menu provided, he said, “If we weren’t in public I’d kiss you right now.”
John had actually planned on saying something – probably in question to who had wanted the alley and why Moran’s had bought it for a ‘friend’ – but his voice caught in his throat as soon as he stepped through the door and looked around.
“Put that back on, please. I can’t tell you that, though, I’m afraid. I’m here to keep you well.”
John suitably broke the mood. “My dad’s gonna kill you for making me gay.”
“At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the guns fell silent on the Western Front, to bring an end the First World War…”
“I know that, thanks.”
At a slight loss for where to start he decided to go basic. It was good to get back into the swing of medicine. He’d forgotten how much he missed it as he held the torch between his knees and tried to roll the creature over, only to get a bit of a shock.
“Oh.” John winced again and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. “I didn’t call them. I swear I didn’t.”
John rolled his eyes, and kept them closed. “You have, maybe.”
“Upstairs, then?” John tried, glancing around once more while he still could.
Sherlock, with no idea how to act to remedy the situation, slammed the call button, and held John’s hands away to stop him from the pathetic attempts he was making to pick up his own vomit. A nurse took one look at the scene and immediately went for the locked cupboard at the other side of the little room.
“Quite certain.” Sherlock nodded. “I definitely didn’t do it to myself.”
John, his face crumpled behind the oxygen mask and his hands, sniffed hard. “I told him,” he sobbed, and a few sharper sniffs overtook his choked voice. His eyes were closed, but more fat tears still striped his cheeks. “I, on the phone, I said… I’d go over. He could… he could…”
“Checking,” Sherlock said, and those eyes slid all over John’s body again.
“It’s probably just the morphine,” the nurse explained, “don’t worry. I’m sure it’ll wear off soon. Use those if you need them.” He nodded his head towards the bowls and brought over some clean blankets, gathering the dirty ones up before setting the clean ones at the end of the bed. “Here, mate, wipe your mouth.”
He’d texted John at about lunchtime, dropped a little hint:
Sherlock shrugged noncommittally. John shook his head.
“No. Don’t be silly.”
A pause. “Oh.” Sherlock looked down at himself. He couldn’t for the life of him figure out what John had just decided, so he took a guess and answered the question he’d been asked. “You got blood on me back at your house. It’s fine, my mother can get rid of anything.”
“He really did say it,” John insisted. He’d never grow tired of showing it off. “That he loves me.”
He’d pushed at the waist and shoulder, careful not to put too much pressure on both points, and what had turned over was a person. Or, at least, something with human arms. He pulled his hands away in surprise and took a moment to evaluate. He tried to see any more markings, but it was so caked with mud he couldn’t see anything except light and dark, and who could tell what was just mud? He decided to move on, shining a torch down his waist. Again, there were issues with the mud, so he continued, right down to humanoid legs and definite human feet.
“Oh.” John paused, suddenly feeling a ball of some sort of emotion swell up in his chest. He glanced up at Sherlock, smiling just a little bit. “Yes, I think so. That’d be nice. Thanks.”
“No idea,” John mumbled. “Probably. Let’s go and find out.”
“Let’s go and catch ourselves a drug dealer, shall we?”
The promise was kept: when John awoke from his drug-induced nap, Sherlock was still right there beside him. Granted, he’d fallen asleep and was drooling on his edge of the pillow, but he was still there, and that was what mattered most.
again? He spent the rest of his tidying session shamelessly dancing around to an old Spice Girls CD of his sister’s, just because he could.
“You don’t remember. You had hardly any money and you still bought me a dozen eggs that you knew I’d only set fire to.” Sherlock was looking excited now. He was almost grinning. “I didn’t know why before but I couldn’t delete it. I know now.”
“Like you’re on your own,” Sherlock deduced slowly, “and you have nowhere. But that’s not true, John. You’re not on your own at all, because I’m right here, and there are people at all sides keeping you safe and sound and willing to talk to you for hours until you feel better. And you’ll always have a place with me.”
A slow smile spread across his face.
the painful music that came with bowling.
“Lots of people were eating it,” he’d answered with a shrug.
“That’s… That’s actually the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard.” John stroked Sherlock’s chest gently before dragging him in for a tight hug – which Sherlock, startled, eventually managed to figure out how to reciprocate.
And again.
“I told you. Sebastian Moran.”
“Childline. NSPCC. The nurses.”
There wasn’t much noise; practically silence. Every so often would be a faint thud of contact, varying in pitch so much that at one point he genuinely had no idea what on Earth was being put where. There were a few long minutes of listening and thinking and resisting the urge to march out and stop it breaking his things before he took a deep breath and got out of bed.
John was led over to a plain black car. It was inconspicuous, even with the tinted windows, but it was the only black car in the car park and he just knew it had some sort of tracker or gun storage unit or other such technologies concealed in it somewhere. Nevertheless, the threat of getting shot hung at the forefront of his mind and he forced himself to slide into the backseat. When he looked out of the window, the car park was full. Seriously, where had everyone gone? Who the hell was this Sebastian Moran that he had the power to do that sort of thing?
Unfortunately, the realisation of shock didn’t help him to overcome it. He got stuck halfway down the little staircase leading back to the bowling alley, his knees weakening to the extent that he had to slide down the wall and have a sit down for a moment. He put his face in his hands and breathed hard and deep to stave off any threats of a panic attack that may have tried to strike. When he finally felt a bit better, he could hear voices floating down from the room just a few steps up.
to him, and he was so smart. He had to wonder why they hadn't been doing this their whole lives.
John shook his head. “Same rules apply. If I’m not here, he’ll start on her. I need to keep her safe. She’s my sister, Sherlock.”
John couldn’t even bring himself to reply to that, too afraid that he’d just end up crying even harder and getting dragged away by a nurse.
John smiled an incredibly plastic smile as he cleared his throat. “I went the year before last,” he lied smoothly, looking down at his feet. “I think last year we had a case. You didn’t know what day it was for about four days. The year before that I went, though.”
“It’s…” John swallowed. He was almost smiling. Sherlock had no idea why. “It’s not a heart attack.”
“I’m right beside you,” John echoed again, an excitable smile on his face. The mask was back down by his neck, but he seemed alright, so Sherlock let it slide. Before he could answer, however, John turned his head to look at him, suddenly serious. At a delicate whisper, as if anybody were about to walk in, he said, “Sherlock, are we boyfriends?”
“Curious. Tell me.” Sherlock settled a hand on his chest and tipped his head back, closing his eyes.
John exhaled noisily. “My jokes are funnier than yours.”
John waited. No elaboration came. “Did you want to, you know, explain? Explain why you… Eggs? Really?”
“All night?”
“Good boy,” Moran praised patronisingly, catching both objects with a victorious flick of each wrist. He tucked the gun into the waistband of his trousers and slid from the table again and, in one fluid movement with two satisfying clicks, John had his hands back.
“Um, yes. That’s me. Hello.”
“Come on, this is your chance. You’re always being so fucking grumpy about not being able to take direct control, and here’s your opportunity. Are you gonna take it or not?”
John smiled. “Perhaps you don’t know the joys of double-glazing, but I dream about it frequently. I’ve never stayed in Central before,” he mused. “Maybe he’ll put you somewhere with a view. I’d love to see the city.”
John laughed. “Good.”
It took a full minute for John to catch up, and even then he didn’t see any of these points linking. Ever. Being honest, the next bit didn’t help at all, either.
“I didn’t know you had a mum.” Sherlock frowned. “Where is she?”
“I’m good,” John said, closing his eyes and nodding. “I’m
“Don’t be silly,” Sherlock scolded softly, rooting through his pockets until he could press a tissue into John’s uncoordinated hand. “You’re going to get lots of hugs, and then you’ll wonder why you ever thought you could live without them.”
No. He was better off just calling his sister.
of it was his fault. He didn’t need her confusing him even more.
Sherlock did.
“I-it’s the most sensible solution,” John said quickly. “He lives closer to school, and he’s in a lot of my classes. He can, you know, get me the work.” He cleared his throat, wondering how on Earth he’d managed to be this close to Sherlock for this long and not pick up on how to talk like a normal human being.
Fawnlock stopped when he couldn’t hear John following. He looked back and frowned. “John with me,” he demanded. He didn’t look back ahead of him until John rubbed his forehead and began to follow.
John sighed again, and laid back in the bed, turning over. He rolled onto his side so that his back was to the both of them. At least this way he could cry in semi-privacy.
John blinked. “What happened last night?”
Well, shit.
“Are you alright?” he forced, tucking his face into his neck and kissing.
“Golly. Spent all that on me, did you?” John popped the cap off his drink and gave it a sniff. “God, it smells amazing. Thanks.”
“They’re letting me go in a few days,” John said quietly, his eyes glazing over. “I could… come and see you. You could do it. Just finish me off, right there.”
“… It is the Soldier, not the politician, who has given his blood, his body, his life…”
“No chance of bail?” John dropped his head into his free hand. “It’s because I live so far away, isn’t it?”
John hummed and rubbed his eyes. "Biscuit?"
As soon as they were at the little clearing Fawnlock dropped John’s hand and headed straight for his shelter. He pulled out several handfuls of bush vines and creepers and laid them carefully over the ordered collection of John’s things, effectively covering them from the spitting rain that had started to fall. Satisfied, he nodded curtly and grasped John’s hand again to lead him back to his cottage.
After a moment, Sherlock dropped the dirty gown on the floor and lifted John’s arms into a fresh one, tying both sets of strings before laying him back down again with many grunts and groans. The nurse reappeared and plucked the gown from the floor.
John stuttered another strangled inhale. “Said he could finish the job. But he still said no,” he added at Sherlock’s horrified look. “He didn’t even want to kill me, Sherlock. ‘m not even worth that.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh, not this again.”
“You should be my boyfriend all the time.” John slid his hand back into Sherlock’s in an attempt to pull him close again. “Do it again. Do it again if I shout again?”
And they dragged. Sherlock’s phone was dead and they had no TV. John was in no state to be walking down to the lounge, either. They sat and suffered, eventually wolfing down lunch before sitting and groaning a bit more. John needed a top-up of medication after they’d eaten, but he requested a smaller dose to keep his mind sharp and his food down. They obliged.
John blushed deeply, barely biting back an ecstatic grin. “I don’t remember.” He shrugged, plucking at the blanket. “Just stuff, I guess. The rest doesn’t matter. Not to me.”
John sighed and scratched his chin. He put his hand back to the biscuits on his chest and popped it into his mouth. "Dislocated my shoulder. Ages ago."
That evening, he woke up more properly.
“Yes.”
Sherlock got more stable footing and pulled his phone out immediately.
“You are the biggest fucking tease,” John breathed, closing his eyes and sucking a mark onto Sherlock’s neck. “I’ve been waiting all bloody day. Just do it.”
Sherlock responded in kind, taking the cues from Sherlock’s body and doing the same thing again but with a few adjustments. After a moment he realised that the hard lump rubbing against his groin wasn’t only his own anymore, and he couldn’t help but smile as he started kissing down John’s cheek, along his jaw, down his neck, poking his chin down his collar to nip along his collarbone.
“Seventeen.”
“You make it sound like a right sob story when you put it like that.”
“No, Dr. Watson. You’ll want to keep that on.” A paramedic crouched down next to where he was sat by the motorway and gently pulled his hand away. When he looked around, there was his arresting officer sat beside him and handcuffed to him. John lifted his knees and rested his forehead on them, closing his eyes with some deep, calming breaths.
Sherlock blinked at him. “I know why you fainted.”
Harry would have told him.
“Go to sleep,” Sherlock said, grinning at the awed look on John’s face.
Sherlock frowned, but he did return the chaste kiss John pressed to his lips. “Are you sure?” he asked, sitting back on his heels.
There was a cold slab behind his legs, under his thighs. He wasn’t sure what had happened but when he opened his eyes he was sat on a stone bench outside the courthouse, across the car park from the police car that had brought him in. Another panic attack, then. Or, rather,
He’d wanted to start a new fire in his life. Get over the old one, start afresh, but he’d had no idea how. Now he thought he had at least a bit of an idea.
He put the bottle in a cooler and left it on the table, hurrying off to put in a good word for their food.
When he opened his mouth to say something else, all the words he knew flew out of his head. Instead, he gave Sherlock’s mouth another affectionate squeeze before trying again.
He was in love with this beautiful, intelligent, adorable creature.
“I’m not fussy when it comes to food,” Sherlock amended, not at all bothered by the accusation.
“No, before that.”
“John,” Sherlock said softly, wrapping him up in his arms and holding him close. John winced. He loosened his hold slightly. “They’re just policemen. They’re going to help.”
Shit.
“Human,” it copied.
John’s eyes filled again, but this time, he was smiling. He slid his cast hand into Sherlock’s under the covers – it wasn’t like he could use it to text, anyway.
Two fingers sliding smoothly, he crooked them again and pressed. John sighed.
“Okay.”
. Shit, he had to stop thinking like that, or he’d probably have another panic attack that would only make things worse. He had to think of something sensible to do. He needed a lawyer. That was what he needed. Where the hell would he get a lawyer? Who would believe his story?
“They’re mental health assessments,” Dr. Garner supplied, picking a few sheets out for him and passing over a pen. “Take as much time as you need.”
It didn’t take too long for it to finish up its search. John could tell when it got bored, because the place suddenly got very quiet. He braced himself for another smash of sorts, but nothing came. As he began to relax he saw a mug float into the hall, followed by an antler, followed by some dark curls, and then, finally, a face. John smiled and sank down into his seat, letting it figure out itself how to leave if it wanted.
“No? ‘No’ what? I don’t understand.” John steeled himself. His eyes hardened, his jaw set; he wasn’t going down without a fight, even if said fight was more of a pathetic excuse of a scuffle. The hairs on the back of his neck rose as he heard a quiet snort of laughter next to him. He didn’t let himself turn around.
"Shit! Sherlock, I'm so sorry! I should have come down sooner...I didn't want to spend all the money I made from the pearl so I got a second hand boat; I've been doing her up and fixing some stuff in the house...I won't leave you Sherlock, not unless you asked me to!"
. . .
"Sorry Mike I zoned out for a bit there. What were you saying?"
“He's wearing a frilly apron; he baked the cake himself”
The creature opened its eyes and slowly took in his surroundings, confusion rapidly giving way to panic.
He re surfaced with a triumphant grin, holding out a bundle of dark rags.
'It takes practice that's all, I haven't been doing it long' John huffed as he reeled in the line, only to fall back in the boat when it snapped.
'Mycroft please, I'm sorry, I won't do it again! I can't survive without the pod, I'm not even fully grown yet!' Sherlock begged his brother.
John had a good look at the creature while he could, examining his ears and lifting up his hand made top: everything was completely ordinary and human, except the gills either side of the rib cage and the elephant in the room that was the, actually rather beautiful, ombre tail going from midnight blue to sky. He, for it was definitely male, didn't even have webbed fingers; just bitten nails and John chuckled-he always thought mer folk sat on rocks combing their hair, not biting their nails.
'Ok then, I'm kinda average and it's getting late...I had better get back. It was, um, nice meeting you' John blushed.
'I never did get your name' John whispered going in for another kiss which was dodged.
"True Bill very true. You always give the best advice you know that? I appreciate that, I really do, and listen,  no listen, serious face now, I'm gonna make sure you don't die. I am, because that's how much I love you Bill" John declared before becoming distracted by a scene at the door. A tall young man with wild dark curls was gesturing madly at a stocky skinhead who shook his head and shoved him away.  The tall one looked desperately around the bar before locking eyes with John and threading his way through the crowd toward him.
And that was how John Watson met Sherlock Holmes and other colours began to creep into his dreams, black and white and dark aubergine, pale grey and ice blue.
Sherlock let his head fall back and gave a soft moan. "You could touch my arsehole, if you'd prefer." He said, a smirk becoming prominent on his lips.
"No, John. I've never had sex, never kissed anyone, never done any of it." Sherlock answered, a bit dryly.
John looked at Sherlock for a moment before nodding slowly. "You've never been kissed." He stated.
"John. Relax." Sherlock's voice broke him out of his thoughts.
Sherlock smirked. "I know that, John. I wouldn't be here with you otherwise." He assured, pulling on his own pair of gloves.
John's brows furrowed slightly. "What do you mean by that?" He asked, looking sidelong at the detective. Sherlock pushed John carefully against the wall.
John tried to gather his thoughts enough to figure out how to be useful to Sherlock, but his eyes were transfixed on the detective.
"No one comes through here, darling." And the way he said it made John think that Sherlock had actually noticed something or other that served as evidence to support that, but he couldn't be arsed to care quite then.
"If you're ready, then yes. Or I can give you some time if you're not." John said, folding his arms over his chest.
"It doesn't matter, John. Can you really picture a life with someone you cannot touch?" Sherlock bit out. John took a little step forward and carefully took a hold of Sherlock's forearms, the smooth sleeve of his shirt serving as an effective barrier.
“I got hugs,” John protested, covering his face with his hands.
“Sherlock, do you actually remember what a date is? We spoke about this a while ago. Two people going out and having fun.”
“I’m getting really sick of repeating myself,” Moran said, eyes locked on John’s.
“For the evening, yes. I gave up and went to bed with a book.” John was very confident about this.
John grinned. He wasn’t exactly aroused, but he was happy to help Sherlock out and, if he was being honest, he expected his own little friend would pop up as soon as he got into the swing of things.
“Ow,” John yelped, glaring up at Sebastian. “What sort of office is this supposed to be?”
He couldn’t just keep it all contained. He probably hadn’t been waiting as long as Sherlock had, but, well, it felt like he’d been waiting a while. What did it matter who had been waiting longer? They had each other now, and that was where the cause for celebration was. Granted, he couldn’t celebrate very much without Sherlock finding out and teasing him, but he’d celebrate as much as he could because, fuck it all, things had gotten better. It seemed that around Sherlock everything got better and then, somehow, got better a bit more. He’d never met anybody like Sherlock before.
John, however, made a funny, teasing noise. He slid his hand up Sherlock’s front to grip his chin, squashing his cheeks and mouth until his lips were perked appropriately. “But were you enjoying to kiss me?”
“You going to pick me up in a tux and then tell me how scary my dad is over a curry?” John continued, gaze roaming Sherlock’s face in amusement as it pinched. “Alright, alright, I’m sorry. Sorry.” He kissed him again. “I was only joking.”
, the only way to get John to comply with proper care was to convince him that it had nothing to do with him personally and everything to do with someone else. “
“What if I don’t want to press charges?” he asked eventually, looking between the officers. “I don’t want him to go to prison, just… cancel everything.”
John swept the torch left and then right. The rain was getting softer every minute, but he’d still rather be inside. He tried to remember where he’d heard the noise from, and thought it was straight ahead, but he didn’t himself not to have imagined it all, anyway. Lord knew he was lonely enough.
John took the wad of paper towels and wiped his mouth, his face the picture of confused heartbreak. Sherlock put his own hand over John’s and gave him a bit of assistance.
He bit back a smile and reached around to Sherlock. He didn’t know where his own phone was, but he discovered Sherlock’s in his pocket and fiddled around for a few minutes. It was no use; he couldn’t guess the password.
He nodded his stony agreement and leant forwards in his seat, at first just giving his body time to stop his legs from trembling. Once he realised what was happening, however, it was more to look at his leg in wonder.
Resigned, he tipped his head back and closed his eyes. Try as he might, though, sleep wouldn’t come. In the end he stopped trying and spent the hour thinking about Fawnlock instead.
“Nope. Those police fuckers kicked me out. All I could get them to do was direct me to the right hospital.”
“What?” he asked suspiciously, turning back to Fawnlock. Fawnlock seemed to be keeping a deliberately blank face. “What is it, what’s inside?”
“I don’t go to parties.” He pulled his sleeve up and checked the time. “Go and put some proper shoes on, we have to leave soon.”
“Sure!” the waiter cried, turning to have a look around. “Just hang on here for a second, and I’ll find you somewhere. We’re a bit packed tonight.”
John snorted. He sighed and picked them up again, keeping his knees up to hide his answers as he worked through.
Gavin has them. Why? SH
Shockingly enough for Sherlock, the dinner passed… well, not very boringly. The wine was taken back and a better bottle was brought to them on the house. The food arrived within the next fifteen minutes (fastest service John had ever had at a place like this, and it was courtesy to
They took their time exploring each other. Not too much, not too physically, but their hands roamed, stroking and holding, and their mouths synchronised until they were both giving and taking in time with the other. Eventually Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore.
“I’ll do it again if you
“Because I believe it’s in the best interests of your recovery to have a complete separation from him,” Greg said clearly.
“We will. Thank you.”
“I’m here,” Sherlock said, smiling both to comfort John and find an outlet for his smug I-told-you-so. “It’s okay, I’m right here. You’re alright. Just listen to me, you’re okay. Relax.”
“There’s… I didn’t think… What?”
Sherlock sighed. He stopped trying. The serious conversation seemed to have sobered John’s consciousness from his concussion, for which he was mostly thankful. Talking to a John with the mental capacity of a six-year-old had felt like repeatedly slamming his head against a brick wall.
“John,” Sherlock said, after looking at John for a long time as if he were some new species of idiot, “shut up. You might have died of your injuries and your own stubbornness if I hadn’t called. It
was being kidnapped.
“… May we have such a devotion to justice and freedom that the heroism of all who fought, and still fight, may continue to be remembered in a nation of service and in a world of peace.”
“You’re so soft,” he breathed, his nose tucked under Sherlock’s jaw. “All soft and sweet… warm.”
“Your lungs,” Sherlock reminded him. “Harry was here, and a small shard of one of your ribs punctured and collapsed one of your lungs. You had to have a needle put into your side to release the air.”
"I need you." Sherlock watched him closely. "And you need to get help."
“Here.” Sherlock’s hand popped between the two of them, along with a fifty pound note.
Well, John was certainly going to make sure his gun was clean when he got home.
John already knew. He was sure he already knew, but maybe, just maybe, they’d say something easy to listen to.
“I know.” John looked up at the ceiling, his jaw set. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John nodded. “What tests are these, exactly?”
“John?” he asked quietly. He had to close his eyes as his brain overloaded with the sensations splashing out from his cock.
He shook his head clear and sat down with his dinner in front of a TV that still didn’t have signal. Once he’d left his plate in the sink, he fished out his laptop from the bedroom and sat at his desk. He connected the printer up and put the memory card in from his camera. A few minutes later he smiled victoriously as he hung his new photo on the wall above his desk.
“John?” he called desperately, crawling through and then over to him. “John, can you hear me?” He carefully lifted John’s wounded arm and rolled him over, lifting his bloodied head to cradle it in his lap. He tapped his cheek a few times. “It’s Sherlock. Please wake up. John.”
He had a feeling the questioning had gone badly. They had very clear evidence that he had brutally assaulted and killed an innocent man last Monday evening; the fact that he was telling them he had no memory of it, and no proof that he hadn’t actually done it, wasn’t looking good for him. Apparently his living half the country away from the site wasn’t enough evidence. If that wasn’t enough, his bum was starting to go numb again.
Greg sighed again. He was quiet a for a minute. “I’m going to record the conversation and have someone listening. They’re going to cut you off if anything happens, alright?”
is why I refuse to socialise,” Sherlock snapped in annoyance. He reached over and pulled John’s hand away from his face.
“I don’t have anyone to talk to,” Sherlock pointed out, closing the rumpled magazine he had and putting it at the top of his stack.
He poked his head around the door and checked the guest bedroom, but it seemed untouched. His head turned instantly as he heard a distinctly crunchy snapping sound coming from his bedroom. John had to bite back his smile again. Instead, he cleared his throat softly.
“You’re an arsehole, John Watson,” he muttered against his mouth, eyes closed. John’s opened wide and stared up at him.
Sherlock smiled. “Are you hurting at all?”
“John!” Sherlock cried, bending down and scooping them back up. “Those were in order!”
John found it difficult to leave. He supposed he was in shock, though it didn’t feel fitting that this time last year he’d been happily throwing himself into the crossfire in war-torn Afghanistan and now he got a bit of a fright from a friendly (if extremely threatening) chat.
“I guess we could count this as a learning experience,” he said, trying to lighten the mood as he wiped his cheeks with his cast left hand. “Beat me half to death and I’m one-hundred percent guaranteed to change my mind about something. Keep that in mind for the future, hm?”
"You will tell me to stop if you feel it is uncomfortable?" Sherlock asked with such sudden intensity that John blinked.
It was after a month of awkward plastic wrapped-kisses that things finally became more heated.
Even though they'd been dating a while, he still wasn't quite used to being unable to touch Sherlock whenever he wanted to. "We're going to get caught." He breathed, ignoring how that sent a shiver of excitement down his spine. Sherlock shook his head and gave a more insistent movement of his hips.
John came only a moment after Sherlock, gripping the detective'sshoulder tightly.
For years, Sherlock had no problem with it. It was easy, given that regular people were just extremely uninteresting to him.
Like nothing else called for his attention at that moment in time. John looked at Sherlock for a pause before nodding.
"I'm sorry." John said softly, wanting nothing more than to comfort Sherlock, but he didn't know how. He couldn't touch him, so what could he do? He was a physical kind of person, and he always had been. But mostly it was because he wasn't the best with words.
Once they resettled, Sherlock was absolutely relentless. He stroked John without pause, sometimes meeting his eyes and smirking.
Perhaps, though, with Sherlock... He wouldn't ever need to have the right words, because Sherlock could so easily read him. He blinked himself out of his thoughts. "So do you ever plan to...Marry, or anything?" He asked delicately.
"How will you know," he asked lowly, "if you don't try? And you are ever so fond of experiments." He reminded. Sherlock locked eyes with John, and that finally convinced the blond that he should leave it be.
When he woke he was even more exhausted than before. He drank three cups of coffee before it finally began to kick in.
"I do, yes. I am uncertain on how well they would play out, but I do have some more ideas. I merely want to be able to satisfy you as a good partner ought." Sherlock explained. John nodded and took a long sip of his tea. He didn't know just what to say. After a few moments of silence, he finally spoke.
Sherlock had no shame, seeing as he'd never moved past this stage before. John had thought he'd grown out of acting upon such a primal instinct as rutting, but this made him rethink that. It was good. Really good.
John frowned and slid his hand up Sherlock's torso in order to cup his cheek. "I wouldn't have it any other way, you understand me?" He said firmly.
"I could, yeah. If it were with you." He said gently. Sherlock swallowed hard and met John's eye.
Sherlock gave a little shrug. "It's all I've ever known." He said, trying his best to brush it off. He was, of course, very lonely. But he knew it didn't matter. It would never matter.
John's breath hitched and for a moment he didn't breathe at all. Then then let out a breathy moan and came over Sherlock's glove and his own stomach.
Sherlock gazed back into John's eyes, a near-smirk tugging up the corners of his mouth. "I promise."
"Is this why you- ah, wear bloody gloves all the time?" He asked, struggling ever so slightly against Sherlock's hold.
John shivered as the cold leather ran over his skin. The touch was soft, but the sensation was a tad odd. It wasn't necessarily bad, it was merely... Different.
Sherlock rose his eyebrows, looking from the box to John. "Right now?" He questioned.
All Sherlock's life, he'd been different. He'd learned faster, questioned more, understood others less, and so on. But what made him the most different was what happened when he touched people.
"What did you have in mind, then?" He asked the detective, setting his coffee aside.
John sighed. "Sherlock Holmes. You are the most dramatic man I have ever met." He said with a roll of his eyes.
It seemed that assassin had been satisfied with the death of John, no matter that it wasn't by bullet, or that it had been temporary.
John was finished far sooner than he'd like to admit. Sherlock was quite good, though John was pretty sure the detective viewed his pleasure as a sort of experiment.
"So are we...?" Sherlock didn't know what sort of label to put on them. Perhaps there wasn't an appropriate one.
John slept for thirteen hours once the cases finally stopped, which was quite a significant amount more than his usual five or six- seven or eight if he was lucky.
"No, I hadn't been." Sherlock replied slowly, as if working it out in his head. He carefully took the cellophane from John in order to kiss him again, this time, while it was awkward and sloppy, he actually contributed to the kiss. John nearly laughed at Sherlock's antics, but he refrained so that he might kiss Sherlock like he deserved.
"It's alright." Sherlock said, and his voice was much softer than usual. Fonder.
"I was thinking that we might try something." Sherlock said, the leather fabric of his leather gloved-fingers an odd sensation against John's jean-clad thigh. He tried hard to repress a shiver.
“Goodnight.”
“Tell them what?”
He folded his paper, dropped it on the top of the paper pile, and got up with his empty mug. In the many minutes he had while Sherlock was getting dressed he washed up all the mugs and put the crockery back in the cupboards. Then he checked the time again and ran upstairs to switch his bulky jumper for a cardigan that would fit under his coat. He buttoned it halfway up his torso and then straightened his collar in the mirror. One last sensible flick of his hair and he was going back downstairs, sliding his shoes on and wondering how Sherlock had managed to be ready before him.
There were three of them, and they came at him like a pack of wolves would a deer. Sherlock couldn’t see any weapons on them but the largest was holding John quite firmly to the wall, and he could hear his furious shouts of
His footsteps faltered. Moran shoved him a bit further in so he could lock the door behind them.
“I’m hanging out of the window, I was just checking on him—” Sherlock sighed. He couldn’t get his thoughts straight. “It was his dad,” he clarified. And then, in the hopes that he could give them some sort of reason to let him stay closer to John, he continued. “He’s my boyfriend and his dad has attacked him. He stopped answering my texts and I wanted to make sure he was okay. I can’t get in.”
“Oh, I’m not so sure about that,” Sebastian argued with a little shrug. He put his feet up on his desk and scratched at his chin. “Retired war veteran with episodes of PTSD and absolutely no proof of where he is at any given time? I could use that. I could use that a
“No, I know that much,” John said in return. “I bet she could get you to a party, though.”
“Wow, wow, easy!” The officer put out his hands and stepped back. “It’s alright. I’m DI Lestrade, I’m not gonna touch you. Stay calm.”
He gestured back to the front door to make his point, not sure how much Fawnlock understood from his two days of solitude. He just shook his head, and John nodded.
“Oh,” Sherlock said uncomfortably, cheeks tinting pink. John bit his lips to contain the awed grin. “I see.” He pouted, made some strange kissing noises as he thought, and then turned back to John. “John.”
Another growl, this one more displeased than anything.
It took him two sweeps of the torch beam to make out anything different; the thing was almost completely obscured by the branch that had fallen on top of it. The only way John recognised something off was by catching a glimpse of distinct tawny brown under the pile of rotten wood and bright green.
“You never kissed me like that before,” he pointed out, thoroughly pleased with the whole thing.
He stared up at her, blinking hard. He couldn’t get his eyes to look.
John clenched his jaw.
And then John cleared his throat quietly and his hand loosened in Sherlock’s, and Sherlock realised he was trying to say ‘let go of my hand’, so he did. He glanced down as their tiny little point of contact parted, cold air rushing in to replace the soft heat of John’s hand. He shivered and pushed his hand back down into his pocket. John’s closed around his programme and folded it, then folded it again, until it was the neat little rectangle that he tucked into his pocket. Sherlock wondered if he was going to go over it again later, or put it in a drawer in his room, or forget about it and find it in a few months and look back with a fond smile. He hoped that one day John would be able to look back on this day and smile. He hoped it hadn’t made his feelings worse.
Message sent, he put his phone on the table and refocused his attention on the television, not noticing Sherlock’s smirk. He always found it funny watching John attempt to use technology, but he knew how much he hated being teased. Sherlock found that funny, too, really. John could stand to live with Sherlock Holmes, with his never-ending work hours and frequent illegal experiments, but he couldn’t stand being teased about his sexuality, or his height, or his ineptitude with anything electrical. By ways of what he stood for and against, he was more of a man’s man than Sherlock was.
It took a bit more discussion, but the nurse eventually left with a promise to seek out a doctor. As soon as she was gone, John pulled the mask down from his mouth again.
John stood up, but his steps faltered and it took him a second to remember how to walk. On his way past, Sebastian leant in and muttered near his ear.
the man had said, and John had thanked him in as shaky a manner as he could and leaned into Sherlock as they walked away. Of course, they didn’t go home.
At three o’clock that afternoon, a tall figure came to stand at the foot of his bed and, much to his surprise, it was Sherlock. John blinked at him.
“I’m sure. Besides, it’s a bit early.”
Sherlock sighed. This really wasn’t how he’d wanted their first time to go. “Well, which way am I
John blinked at her. The entire courtroom gaped in unison. All she did was scrunch up the note and walk back out. Mr. Suit pulled another from his pocket, glancing over it presumably to check it was the right one before handing it over to the usher. The whole room remained relatively silent as messages were passed around and people began to slowly filter out. John himself was led back to his waiting room, where he thought he’d be for the next couple of hours, but it was minutes before a tall man in a grey suit came to join him.
“I don’t need help.” John pulled his smile on again. “Everything’s fine.”
John’s eyebrows shot right up his head. He seemed to be in shock for the moment.
Finally, she found the right corridor, two floors below her first indications. She could see the room with its blue “27” just across from the nurses’ station, and with a gently whined cry of relief, marched on over – only to have her arm caught by security when she got within six foot of the door.
“No, Sherlock will be staying,” John said calmly, reaching out to take his hand. “I need him here.”
Sherlock’s hand moved to capture John’s and hold it there, to his heart. “Are you always going to be my friend?”
“Look, John, I understand that you’re upset, frustrated, and confused, but you need to give me a real picture of how you’re feeling.” Adam handed him a red pen so he could go over the black choices with the correct answers.
“I have no idea what you just said.”
There were dark patches over his waist, also shaped like triangles, but John didn’t want to focus on that, or the long thickets of hair he could see completely covering the crotch. He continued his little study and noticed a collar of the same furry hair growing over his neck and shoulders and leathery soles on the skin of his feet and calluses on his fingertips.
John’s hand stroked down a fuzzy arm. When he took it back, a pink tinge to his cheeks, the faun shuffled closer until his arm brushed his hand again. John took the invitation gladly and stroked him again. A quick glance to his face said the faun was very happy with this; he looked like a pampered cat. John’s gut twisted again as he thought about how long this creature could have been alone for.
Sherlock passed his coffee to John and dipped his hand into his inside pocket, pulling out two police badges in black wallets. He checked the names and then swapped his coffee for a badge.
The ravioli was the best Sherlock had ever tried, and had come with a little side pot of a spicy tomato sauce and a tiny bowl of parmesan cheese to top it off. They swapped a mouthful each and, genuinely, couldn’t decide whose was better. Or, at least, John couldn’t. Sherlock insisted that his own was, but he couldn’t help but think that maybe that was just because he wouldn’t have been able to live with the possibility that he’d chosen something that wasn’t the best. John’s carbonara was rich and creamy and also came with a little bowl of parmesan, so he really was incredibly chuffed.
He laughed excitedly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck, using his firm cast to tug him down and into another kiss.
“Is that so?” she pressed him, smirking. “Your boyfriend seems to know exactly what I’m talking about.”
John grinned as he followed him through to the stairs. “Really? We’re doing that tonight?”
He took a deep breath as he stared down at his watch: he hadn’t actually been to a Remembrance Day service since he’d gotten home. It was one of his most shameful secrets. To others, perhaps it wouldn’t have come across as disrespectful, but he felt he had an obligation to attend. He simply hadn’t been able to, whether it had been because he hadn’t wanted to go on his own or he’d not even gotten over his own battles. This year, though, he was going, and he was going with Sherlock.
“So?” Sherlock said, also now empty-handed.
Understanding dawned and Fawnlock nodded easily. “Wash,” he said, demonstrating on the back of his own hand. John didn’t know Fawnlock licked to clean. He thought he always just ran himself a few inches of water in the bath and used it like a puddle or the stream.
John frowned as he sat back to read the questions. There weren’t too many, and they were all closed questions with simple “Yes” or “No” answers. John assumed these officers thought he must have had some sort of personality disorder judging by some of these questions.
His eyes snapped open (when had they shut?) when he heard a familiar little bus rattling along. He didn’t recognise the driver, but that was nothing unusual. He went and settled into the back bench, pulling out his phone to start writing a list. He didn’t want to forget anything today.
was friendship.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, sitting forwards and getting his face close. “How are you feeling?”
John didn’t believe him.
“No, wait,” he blurted, making Fawnlock jump. He smiled and stepped over, lifting a hand to stroke over a few of the curls and flowers on his head. “It’s… You look…” He cleared his throat awkwardly. “You look amazing.”
work. He wasn’t made for bloody fishing and berry-picking; he’d only taken up fishing to please his dad, thank you very much.
good. Like, the goodest. Ever.”
After a moment he pried Fawnlock from his torso and ushered him inside, closing the door behind him. The house was cold, but, Jesus, it was good to be home. Fawnlock was stuck to his side like a limpet as he went to turn the heating on and stash the money he’d taken.
“Yes?” John grinned; he couldn’t help it. Since when had Sherlock been so…
“Have you got money?”
“You chased him up the tree.”
The journey home was different from the journey there, but only marginally. In fact, John frequently convinced himself that they were the same, and then he remembered the realisation he’d had. He remembered the way Fawnlock had dressed up for him, and how he’d looked at John like his opinion was the most important thing, and how gently his hand had been held so that Fawnlock was no longer leading but walking beside him.
