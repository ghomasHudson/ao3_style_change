Big fucking difference it makes when you leave me, just- just there, alone, to deal with the shit you piled on to me! How could I- What the hell do I even do after that, Cas?
You’re gonna think I’m crazy.
(wistful, to himself)
Right.
Oh no! What can we do!
. You had nothing to do with the man I became today other than my fears, my insecurities, and my ability to wield a gun at
How did Cas... how did he summon the Empty, Dean? Why- how did it take him?
Dean takes the hint and grabs Cas by the shoulders and hoists him up. Cas blinks his eyes open, delirious.
It took a week for Dean to start talking, really talking, more than one-word answers. Then it all spills out.
END MUSIC CUE.
Dean’s in the driver’s seat with Sam riding shotgun, Eileen sitting in the back. Sam and Eileen exchange another worried glance. Sam opens his mouth to say something, but is shut up by Dean’s empty, determined, glassy gaze on the road. Then Sam looks back to Eileen, and she shrugs.
“I’m a fuckin’ wimp, aren’t I?” No one gives him an answer. He wasn’t really looking for one, anyway, though. Sighing, Dean hops into the driver's seat of the Impala and turns the ignition, smiling at the familiar rumble. “This time, we’re gonna find him, Baby.”
Sam started chanting, and oh, right. The goal was to seal away the Empty, not just get Cas back. The rift stitched itself back together, and faded away.
Dean looks soulfully at Cas, who averts his eyes.
He was telling Jack a story, we didn’t get the chance. Now fill me in, do we know where Lucifer and Valeria are?
I’ve set up a spell of sorts. Chuck and I... our power is being slowly distributed into the universe. By the time he notices, we’ll be human.
“Yes, Death,” Adam responded, exhausted.
Jack flips his phone 180 to show to Castiel and jumps up and down. Castiel smiles proudly, before seeing the content of the phone.
“Well, I did then send you on a mission from the other angels. I think that caused more damage than a superficial wound to my trench coat.” Cas says, his usual deep monotone. Dean lets out a snort at how John raises his eyebrows hearing such a deep voice come from what looks like a tax accountant.
Sam and Eileen sit at the motel table, laptops and books out in front of each of them. Sam taps Eileen to let her know Jack and Dean have entered. Jack’s still groggily clinging to his teddy bear, while Dean is looking angry. Well, like always. Jack shambles over to the bed and faceplants into it.
LUCIFER
EXT. CHURCH GRAVEYARD - RIVERTON - 1996 - NIGHT
SUBTITLES: “I don’t know.”
(silly voice)
Yeah.
CASTIEL
Dean’s only half joking. He chuckles deliriously. Jack puts down Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, and looks at Dean, trying to soothe the beast.
Sam raises his eyebrows. Dean shrugs and grimaces. Smooth, buddy.
Look at me now, will I ever learn
Hi Sam.
(squeaky)
Dean wretches the stone cover off Pastor John’s grave and tosses the slab onto the ground beside him. MATCH CUT with:
Then we PAN OUT and rotate further, and there’s another figure behind Lucifer. A woman, brown hair, tan skin - QUEEN VALERIA stands with her arms folded in front of her. She’s wearing a dress suitable for a business meeting. There are GLOWING BLUE TATTOOS all over her, classic Djinn.
Dean sighs and looks down, ashamed. Sam looks at Glenn questioningly, then we-
SUPERNATURAL - SEASON 16 EPISODE 02: STYROFOAM PLATES
Series of panning cuts where we see Dean walking and praying. Time clearly passes. The distance Dean’s gone is unclear, but he’s been traveling for a while.
DEAN (CONT’D)
(deadpan)
Well, I’ve been thinking. What if he’s continuing his work after death? No bodies have popped up, so I’m guessing he’s keeping his victims in the church and trying to convert them back to straight.
God, what do I even say when he wakes up? Sorry? By the way, love you too? What the fuck do I even say. What the f-
Dean, you have nothing to apologize for-
You better have.
Sam nods.
Liar!
Thank you for reading! I tried pasting the words differently into AO3, let me know which is better, this or the first way.
First question, does anybody ever call you Cas?
(scoffs)
Dean chuckles emptily. Haha, straight.
Cas slams John’s head down again as blood trickles out of his nose, and a harsh bruise forms on the affected cheek. Then, almost casually, Cas turns to Dean and huffs. “I’m very glad Jack was unable to come. He’d learn very poor manners from this man.” And just like that, it’s like cold water was dumped over Dean and he remembers-
EXT. KANSAS HIGHWAY - MORNING
You make out with him once. You know, it’s been years since then, right? Years. We’ve been through hell and back together and you what, wanted to fuck him? What a deep, touching love story!
QUEEN VALERIA
Star wars! Popcorn!
Now it was distraction time. Jack needed to do some yada yada bullshit behind Chuck’s back while Dean's heart was “connecting with the one of the other side of the Empty,” as if Dean could ever stop thinking about him.
Dean stands there, at the end of the aisle with all of his family and friends looking at him, watching and waiting for Cas to arrive. He taps his foot nervously.
I found out what it takes to be a man
Dean falls to a leaning-sitting position against his bed clumsily.
“Is anybody gonna explain to me what the fuck just happened? And why you all
What, you-
CASTIEL (CONT’D)
(lie)
She had said it was only a formality. She could only give over the fruit to a spouse, and we needed the fruit. I will not regret this decision either.
Eileen walks over and sits next to Sam on the chair next to Miracle. She pats him, then takes Sam’s hand to get his attention.
You don’t have to fake caring about me, Dean. I can handle it. It’s okay.
(serious)
The Impala rolls into view on the street and parks by the sidewalk. It’s Sam driving. Dean glances back for a second.
CASTIEL
Sam groaned. "But is now really the time for one night stands?"
Okay, so Dean died on a hunt. Eileen got erased- she’s back, don’t worry- I had a fake old person life, we went to Heaven-
(chuckling)
“I’m Eileen, Sam’s wife,” she says and signs, getting raised (but approving) eyebrows from John. “You’ll have to look at me when you speak, by the way, I’m deaf.”
INT. GAS STATION - BEAVER CITY - EVENING
Whether you should live or die
No, this isn’t real.
DEAN (V.O.)
Sam shook his head. What could he say? Oh, you know my brother’s drunk as fuck cause he’s mourning the love of his life of twelve years? No biggie.
Dean pauses for a good second. He glances from Sam, to the road, and back again.
Castiel uses actual air quotes and Dean almost smiles. But this is too dire.
Maybe you’ll need this.
Don’t worry daddy, father’s going to be fine.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Shit.
(resigned)
Uh, my name’s Jerry. I’m kinda here to kidnap you.
Anything else helpful from the parents?
Don’t wanna be a bad guy
(singing)
It’s not my fault you’re amazing.
Dean finishes singing and looks back to Jack, fast asleep. Dean leans over to press a kiss to his forehead, pats miracle, then starts walking out. He lingers by the door, sighs, then shuts it with an echoing click and we-
MUSIC (V.O.)
Adam stopped pacing and Sam looked to Jack with hope in his eyes. Damn, it hurt to see his little brother hope, but in a bright way. Dean idly hoped Sam would get out of this mess, find a girl, settle down, while he swished the beer in his bottle ‘round and ‘round. “That could mean something.” Adam said, not really bringing Dean back to reality but reminding him that the option was there. “Let Michael-” inhale, glowing eyes.
Know that the sasquatch wasn’t going to bend, he read the note out loud to bring him up to speed. When he was done, Sam spoke a little more softly. “Dean, it sounds like Cas didn’t really want us to do this. I think we should figure out what those risks and consequences are first.”
“Yeah well, not this time. And if that’s all you wanted, then you can go back to your books now.”
She was wearing denim and a black hoodie. Her long blonde hair was flowing down her shoulders except for a braid framing her face on one side. It was her eyes that caught Dean’s attention. Lined with deep black eyeliner, they were bright and sparked with defiance. He knew those eyes, and he recognized the look.
Cas has a very,very good day.
Lisbon again. Maybe he could get Cas to fill in those blanks for him at some point, but not today. It seemed that they were going to have the time.
“I know Cas, and I know we already talked about this.  But let me just get this out and then we can get outta here ok?” Cas watched Dean with watery eyes, not that Dean would notice as his eyes were still focused on the tree, shimmering with their own unshed tears.  “If I don’t get it out now, I may not ever.”
“Cas, if he didn’t have a chance to say anything when you told him how you felt, how can you know that he doesn’t feel the same way back? Because everything I have ever seen between you tells me the exact opposite.”
"Ебаный ты блядский сукин сын!" Cas’ grabbed the keys out of the ignition and was out of the car before Dean could blink. He jumped out and followed, curious to see what the hell was going on.
Dean hears the unmistakable sound of the front door unlocking.
And when the week was over, they drove into town, bought more supplies, and did it again. Leaving behind their history which they both agreed they finally could, they talked about the future in a way that felt real for the first time ever. Dean had never expected to live this long, although technically, he hadn’t – several times. Cas had never existed in a way that there was a finite timeline to be measured, between them this concept of “the rest of their lives” was both foreign and novel and would take getting used to.
“Uh, hello? Can either of you tell me what the actual fuck is going on?”
“Dean?”
“Do I look like I fucking want to make small talk?”  Charming.
“Cas, buddy, you’re back, we missed you! You will not believe what’s been going on around here, right Sammy?” As soon as the words left his mouth he knew, knew he’d fucked up. Whatever light that had been in Cas’s eyes, those piercing blue eyes, had dimmed immediately.
She made her way into the center of the war room. With the music playing and everyone talking no one had really noticed her, or the fact that when she left the room fifteen minutes ago, she had been wearing the same casual clothes everyone else had on but was now in a dress and heels.  Putting her thumb and finger up to her mouth she blew a loud whistle that was the envy of soccer coaches everywhere.  Everyone stopped and stared.  She smiled at the group.
Without ceremony, he dropped to his knees and used both hands to reach for the button on Cas’s jeans. Caught off guard, Cas was silent while deep looked up with a grin.
Neither of them said anything for a long time.  John was staring hard out the front window, watching for Dean probably.  Cas stared down at his bottle, intentionally using his fingers to peel at the label, pretending like he was doing anything else except casing John, although that’s exactly what he was doing.   He could have used his grace to poke into his thoughts, he really didn’t care about respecting John’s privacy in the least, but it wouldn’t make a difference anyway.  Cas was just waiting for the right time.
“Nice try Romeo, but I can’t keep up with your demands. Let a guy rest and rehydrate, would you? Bathroom break, coffee, and meet back here in ten? There’s something I want to discuss.  Sound good?” Not waiting for an answer, because, in all seriousness, one more press of that cock and he’d be staying put, Dean rolled away and sat up on the edge of the bed. He turned back to look at Cas who was still pouting. God he loved that grumpy face, even pissy, he was adorable and Dean loved him.
Dean sits on the floor surrounded by wilting roses and a smashed vase. Water seeps into the leg of his slacks, but it doesn't make him get up. Not even the notion of Castiel coming through the door any moment gets him up.
“Yes.”
“Exactly.”
He turned back to look at the bed and reviewed everything again.  There was a drawer along the side, but it was less obvious than the wrought iron had been.  He rubbed his hand along the panel, wondering if it was spring-loaded.
He’d gotten a handle on the spell. At least he thought so. After talking it through with Sam, he realized that he wasn’t fooling his brother anyway, and might as well be honest about what he was doing and the things he wanted. he started with food. At first, it was really hard to be open about what he wanted to eat when Sam was right there. Awkward even. But Sam didn’t push, and Dean found that when he finally started ignoring his instinct to hide, the process of being upfront about things was almost freeing. Who knew?
Dean moved Cas onto the floor and stretched out beside him, using the last of his strength to pull him close.  He turned Cas’s face towards him, wanting it to be the last thing he would see.  Keeping his hand on Cas’s cheek he leaned in and kissed him gently, then rested their foreheads together.  Their breaths, as shallow as they were, mingled and Dean whispered softly, eyes closing. “I love you Castiel, I’m sorry.”
Sam erupted in laughter. “Jerk.”
“And the thing is, I knew it was true because every time I pushed against it, every time I hoped for anything more, Chuck ripped it away. The people I got close to always suffered for knowing me. Anytime I let my guard down and tried to grab even a little more than the pile of shit I knew I was entitled to, people got hurt, people died. I’ve always been poison.”
The sound of his own heavy breathing, along with the fevered adrenaline pumping through his blood, had blocked out everything else. It was a long minute before he was able to take stock, even a little bit, of his surroundings.
“It won’t be fine, this isn’t my world, these aren’t my people. I’m going to fuck things up worse. I can do midwest politics and fundraising BBQs. I was stupid to think that I could come here and play politics in DC.” Dean’s stomach churned, was it too late to back out? Maybe if he called Charlie…
“Well, I’m guessing it’s only been a few hours for you, but going on twenty-five years for me.  You don’t need to say anything.”
“OK, about earlier.  Want to tell me what was on your mind?”
“I have some questions that I need you to answer honestly.”
“Actually, Cas, I was kinda hoping the same. You only get married the first time, once, right?” He winked and smiled a flirty smile, but Cas recognized the hopeful look in his eyes. It probably mirrored his own. Again, he was looking forward to getting to know this man better, he had already figured out that the man beneath the facade held more depth than he let on.
Cas finished speaking and the German ambassador shook Dean’s hand. He might be the congressman, but in this situation, he was more than happy to let Cas lead the way. Dean was beyond impressed.
Slipping in beside him, Castiel drew Dean close and wrapped him in his arms. As far as wedding nights went, Dean had no complaints.
He was tempted to say more than that but held his tongue. His body seemed content at the moment to stay in place and he didn’t want to rock the boat. He was still scrambling to figure out the best way out of this mess and he’d gladly accept a broken nose in exchange.
“Man kann nur hoffen, aber ich danke Ihnen.”
да = yes
Castiel had been staring at the same crack in the paint on the wall for 43 hours and 27 minutes. He was embarrassed and trapped in a situation that he had no reference point to get out of.  Initially he was embarrassed because of the way he had reacted at dinner.  He had arrived back with Dean and Sam-just the same as always, and they had welcomed him home- just the same as always. But Sam’s comment about his profound bond with Dean had made him uncomfortable.  So, he had left.
Sam closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly.
“Dean, what
There was also a gorgeous little herb garden that Dean visited daily. Fresh parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, or sage made their way into their nightly meals, pestos prepped ahead and frozen for winter, and mint made into mojitos when they had guests who wanted something other than beer.
Moving day.
Cas paused in the doorway, one hand on the knob, the other by his side. Dean watched him take a few breaths to compose himself, and then he turned to look at Dean on the floor. Dean wanted to stop him from leaving, but he couldn’t move or speak. He didn’t know if it was the spell or his own panic, but whatever it was, he was stuck in place.
Will Dean grin widely, then happily hug him? Or will he be touched beyond words? As his heart beats like a joyous hummingbird in flight, Castiel sincerely hopes it heals his soul, so fervently dear to him.
What he needed to say, couldn’t be said in front of Sam. He hadn’t told Sam what had happened between Cas and him in the dungeon, it was too private, too painful when it looked like Cas had been gone for good. His angel was back, and he was never going to let him out of his sight again. The only problem was that he wanted to tell Cas without an audience, so he didn’t say he wanted to say, he said what was safe.
“Are you asking to scene tonight, Dean?”
The pillow was beside his chair but angled slightly toward it. This was by intention even if it was a little awkward. His right hand went back to carding the sandy brown hair, in slow and gentle strokes. He brought the apple slice to Dean’s lips.
“Did you mean it when you told me that you wanted to build a life with Eileen?”
“Sam, I don’t follow…” And then he got it. He’d been so focused on finding Cas, he’d forgotten he could pray and Cas would hear him. He
Castiel obliges. Behind closed eyelids, he can tell when Dean turns the light on, but that’s it. There’s a shuffling noise, like Dean is trying to drag something out of the closet, followed by a pained groan, and for a moment, Castiel is worried enough he considers just skipping the surprise part to go help Dean, but then Dean is saying, ‘got it, got it,’ and so he relaxes again.
“You’ll have to do better than that, your majesty. I’ve been called worse by better.” There was steel in his voice that Cas had never heard before. “And I don’t take kindly to you threatening my family.”
“Fuck’s sake Sam, leave it and get the hell out of my room. I don’t want to talk about Cas.” And during the whole time he was speaking, he walked back to the table, grabbed the duffle, and brought it back to the bed. Then he repeated the exact same process he had only just completed.
Not every anniversary is a happy one.
“I’m listening.”
He drew his hand up from under the blanket, studiously ignoring the morning wood pressed against his thigh. Gently cupping the side of Cas’ face, he leaned in for a brief but sweet closed mouth kiss that minimized their mutual morning breath. Easing back again slightly, he smiled at his boyfriend, and that was a term that still made Dean smile, who was gradually becoming more alert.
“I did what you wanted Dean, I left. I knew you didn’t want me around anymore. Why did you come after me? Why did you follow me? Why did you have Sam tell me to talk to you? Why did you—why did you kiss me? Why would you go through all of that to hurt me more? Wasn’t it enough for you that I was gone?”
“Uh, how much of that did you hear?” Mortified, absolutely mortified. He looked up at the man expecting open ridicule or worse.
“When I was 12, there was this nest of vampires that my dad was after just outside of Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Three times we had to go back, the leader kept getting away and repopulating the nest within a few months.  Dad was real pissed about it.”
Panic and fear blossomed in his chest, wining out over anger and a sense of betrayal.  He drank to cope, he knew it was too much, it had been for awhile, but he didn’t know how to stop. And if he did stop, he didn’t know how he was going to keep the monsters at bay in his mind.
“I think he’s going to kill himself, Sam, and I have to find him first.”
He dug into his memory for a loose translation;
“Oh it counts sweetheart, but reciprocating will have to wait until tonight.  I’ve got to be somewhere after lunch, and I was hoping you might want to join me – if you can tear yourself away from your kale long enough.“
“Oh, you know Rowena, just witch stuff. Said we could take everything.”
He wasn’t the least bit worried about how a fight right now would end, but Cas had to let things progress a little more to minimize the impact on the timeline.  Wordlessly he stood, dropped a few dollars on the bar to pay for the beer, and left.  He made sure to walk by the window so John would think he was leaving, then he made himself invisible and circled back to wait near where he knew Dean would be.  According to Dean’s story, he only needed to stay out of sight until John dragged him back into the alley.
“Dean, you will not ignore me. Tell me where you are.”
Cas didn’t even sleep.  He didn’t need a memory foam mattress topper.
“And who, may I ask, is this?” The cold fury literally seeped out of the phone and could be felt by everyone around the table. It hadn’t taken rocket science for any of them to figure out that she’d been talking about the deceased brother mentioned in the paper even if Dean was the only one who knew the story.
“Es ist eine Ehre, Sie endlich zu treffen, Botschafter Niebrandt. Ich hatte das Vergnügen, Sie bei einer Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltung der Stiftung Deutsche Krebshilfe kennenzulernen, welche von der Botschaft ausgerichtet wurde. I war außerordentlich beeindruckt von der Art und Weise, mit der Ihr Land sich dem Kampf gegen Krebs in all seinen Manifestationen widmet.”
“So, you were
“Be, Dean, be. I expect you to be my sub, not act like it. But I agree, 24/7 is too much and personally, I don’t think it would be healthy. But in private, when we both agree, you’ll be good for me then, won’t you?”
he would return.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen, no need to get feisty.” Dean closed his eyes and grimaced, only one person spoke with that smarmy Scottish accent. Crowley, their benefactor for the evening, had finally found them. “Out past your bedtime, isn’t Adler? And really, you should be congratulating the lads here. Newlyweds and all that.”
“Beer.  We are not done talking about this. Please sit down.”
“Ahhh,” Dean grunted once and was lost. Waves of pulsing pleasure worked through his body and he was washed away with it. His ears started ringing and all he could do was hold on while Castiel took in everything and swallowed it. He’d never come like that before, and it left him breathless. He couldn’t move if he wanted to.
“Honestly? Not really.” Dean looked out the window, it was too hard meeting Sam’s gaze. “I shoulda told him years ago.” A lump caught in his throat, but he swallowed it back and pressed on. “I wasted so much time. Should have told him how I really felt.”
The other shoe dropped.
The tablecloth goes on, then Dean sets a candle up, saving lighting it until Castiel walks through the door. Next to it, a safe distance away, he sets out the small vase of white roses. The lady in the shop had been really kind and understanding while Dean dithered over what he wanted, though she finally convinced him the white roses—for loyalty and youthfulness, since they're both desperate to hold on and not give in to the few grey hairs appearing at their temples—were the ones he needed.
“Hello?” Well, at least Cas sounded about as thrilled with current events as he was.
Head's up, we've got a little bit of NSFW content.
"Ебаный ты блядский сукин сын" = fucking fucking son of a bitch
“So, I have this idea for a February wedding…”
“Don’t worry, friend. Almost there. The Congressman’s building has extra security measures in place. Everything will be right as rain, you’ll see.” Oddly comforting words from a complete stranger who *may* have just abducted him in broad daylight.
The door clicked shut.
“I’m starting to freeze my ass off here, Cas. It’s ok if we’re done for the night, but I need to move on, man.” He couldn’t hear any more, it was too much. He was hitting too close to home. Dean broke the eye contact and looked away.
There’d be time for that later, for now, there was work to do. Wrangling the bitter grief that threatened to overwhelm him, he stuffed it away to focus on what needed to happen next. He’d already let Cas down; he wasn’t going to abandon him in this.
“Do I?” Sam cocked his head to the side and looked at his brother thoughtfully. “That’s the whole point, Dean. Being honest, telling the truth. Getting things out in the open.”
“The police reform bill will never see the light of day, Dean. No one will touch it with a ten-foot pole.” Sam’s hazel eyes bored into Dean, he could hear what his brother wasn’t saying. Sam had gone to law school and Dean had gone into politics so they could work together to make this bill happen. It had literally been a plan years in the making and they were so close. To lose it all now…
“Cas?”
Still sobbing, Dean launched himself into Cas’s arms, and if he hadn’t been an angel the force of it probably would have thrown him off balance.  As it were though, he just held him, Dean’s face tucked into the crook of his neck and shoulder, Cas’s arms encircling him in comfort, hands resting on his back.  He kept Dean pulled in close and let him cry it out.  Judging by the alcohol on his breath and the empty whiskey bottle on the floor, he figured that Dean would have no memory of this in the morning.  But it was a start, and he’d take it.
“Turn off that water Dean, and step out so I can dry you off.”
“I got a new stipulation, but it’s not in the contract.”
“I don’t mind. Thank you for being honest with me.  This will only work if you are honest. Can you promise to do so at all times?”
Dean closed his eyes because he knew,
“It’s the people you employ and the bill you want to introduce?”
This line inspiring this chapter is "Show Me Slowly What I Only Know The Limits Of", Dean finally starts to understand the depths of Cas's feelings.
Feeling safe to open his eyes Dean looked around the room, no Cas. He looked at the door, the sigil had literally burned through the wood and he could see the bathroom on the other side. The bowl was full of ash, the contents completely consumed.
Any errors are mine and mine alone.
He had done exactly as asked. His clothes were neatly folded and placed on the couch with his shoes on the floor beside. He was kneeling on the pillow, facing away from him, and holding himself in perfect position. A
“Cas, I’m not asking you to just accept everything the way it is, like I already said, Dean needs help.  He drinks too much, he makes dangerous decisions, he’s angry.  But he’s hurting and he’s lost, and I know that he wants to be with you because the only reason I am even here right now is because Dean asked me to leave the bunker so he could be alone…with you.”
“Everything looks pretty flat on the satellite map, Dean, if you can’t see him up ahead, he might already have turned off somewhere.”
“Michel, je vois que vous venez d’être nommé Ambassadeur Clairmont. Toutes mes félicitations, même si je dois admettre que je ne suis pas surpris.”
And for the first time since Dean pulled Cas into the motel room, Cas seemed to find his sense of autonomy. The hands that had been at his side the entire time came up to Dean’s chest and he pushed back, hard. Hard enough to knock Dean off balance and send him sprawling on the floor. Dean didn’t know what was happening, but it was like watching everything in slow motion.
Cas threw his head back and let out a low growl. One hand moved from the counter to the back of Dean’s head, wrapping fingers through his short hair, sandy brown hair and tugging him forward.
Then he remembered Lisbon, or more succinctly, remembered what he didn’t remember. All he knew was that Cas had rescued him, protected him, and ultimately saved his life. None of that was in the official debrief. Dean remembered the before and after, the during was something only Cas himself knew. Whatever had happened, it had ultimately forged an unlikely friendship that brought them here. Where Cas was saving him again.
“Seriously? He pissed his pants? Nice.”  Cas had no response, and Dean didn’t feel like he wanted to know any more than that, so they sat in pensive silence for a few moments.  “Cas, the world never had to show me kindness because I have you, and you are so much better.  You literally rescued me from Hell, died for me, and traveled back in time to protect me.  I love you so fucking much and it will never be enough to match what you’ve done for me.”
Dean was out the door and in the Impala in under two minutes, turning right out of the lot and heading down the empty highway as fast as he could. He desperately hoped there weren’t any turnoffs for a while so Cas would be easy to catch up to. Because if he couldn’t find him…
Castiel feels him sliding behind Castiel again, warm hands on Castiel’s waist to position him just right. Dean’s lips are the soft curve of a smile when he presses a chaste kiss behind Castiel’s neck that sends a shiver down his spine.
“Your finger, it’s on the salad.”
“Why are you eating? You don’t eat.” Amused blue eyes met his guarded green ones.
When they got to the motel, Sam turned to the back seat and smiled. He handed his key over to Cas and said he would go to the office and get his own room. Then he continued saying that they were all tired and even though it was early, it was best to call it a night. Meeting Dean’s eyes, he reassured him that he’d call Jody and the team back at the reservoir, so they’d know that their services were no longer required. He’d take care of everything; his only request was that they go back and talk.
This was the continual loop that played in Dean’s head. Whiskey might lower the volume, but nothing turned it off. Cas had walked out the door and left him. Didn’t matter that Dean hadn’t tried to stop him, hadn’t gone after him, hadn’t reached out. Cas was gone, he hadn’t cooled off and come back, hadn’t texted or called, hadn’t given Dean any indication of where he was going or when he would return –
Ten minutes later, Dean returned, Sam having waited in place the entire time because he’d been fairly certain he’d come back. Dean picked up his chair and sat back down.
“Yeah?”
Cas had left them. Left
“You pick. I’ll go get some snacks,” Castiel says after Dean has set himself down on the couch, sinking into the pillows and begrudgingly accepting the remote. Before the car crash, Dean would have jumped up and pushed Castiel down on the couch instead, ever the gentleman and never someone to let things be fetched for him. But Castiel is happy enough seeing his love get comfortable on the memory foam pillows and wouldn’t trade having
“I heard your prayer; I will always come when you call. At least this time, I tried...it just took me a while.”
Cas opened his mouth to speak.
“Come again?”
“After the way I fucked everything up and hurt your feelings, you bought me pie?” Dean swallowed thickly, he wasn’t going to cry.  He wasn’t.
“Listen, Cas…about what you said in the bunker…”
Dean swallowed back a lump in his throat, he was almost overwhelmed already, and they hadn’t even gotten to the vows.  Cas understood what was going on and stepped in to give Dean a chance to collect himself while also sharing the moment.
Sipping his own cooled coffee, Sam pushed his laptop closed and looked at his brother.  “Up early actually, got a few hours in and now I’m going to go for a run and see if I can make sense of what I have so far in my head.  I did want to ask you something though.”
July always was Castiel’s favorite month.
that Dean sneaked in such a gift for their anniversary. “But… thank you. Thank you, Dean. I love it.” He leans back from the hug, glances over his shoulder at the blank canvas just waiting for him to play with it, and his stomach flutters with excitement. Castiel is smiling dopily when he looks back at Dean.
“Alright, take a seat and I’ll bring it over.”
“Hey Cas, still here?”
“You’ve been saying all day that we were in a rush, what are we waiting for?”
The tip of Dean’s ears turn pink. “Actually… I have something for you.”
He missed Cas, missed his quiet presence in the bunker, missed having someone to watch movies with. He was a better sparring partner in the gym than Sam and always seemed to know when Dean was going to need something. So, fuck him for leaving, right? It was not like he had to go; Dean didn’t tell him to…he just didn’t ask him
Dean opens the letter from Cas to find more questions than answers and a mystery to be solved.  There is a little more heartbreak to navigate as Dean puts some of the pieces together.
Dean’s color deepened, he might have revealed a little too much there because that was exactly what he was hoping Cas was thinking when he looked at him like that. Not that he could just come right out and ask, that would be too embarrassing, but yeah, he hoped that Cas was picking up on the silent message he was sending.
Dean’s Enochian wasn’t as good as Sam’s, but it was good enough to get a cursory overview of the contents of the book.  The first sections had seemed to carry a lot of information they were already familiar with, or it least looked familiar to Dean. Towards the back of the old tome, he found what they might be looking for.  “Hey Sammy, I think I’ve got it.  Sending you a photo right now, can you translate it?”  With a quick snap of the pages laid out in front of him, he sent it off to his brother.  As isolated as the cabin was, he was thankful for the fact there was still cell service.
“Love you, too,” Dean mumbles, but with another sigh, he finally looks at Castiel again, eyes shining with unshed tears. “I don’t deserve you. Wanted tonight to be special.”
“Yes, James.” Ah, we were back to a subtle blush now and it was very sweet to behold. He noted that he’d immediately fallen into addressing him properly without being asked. Dean might be a novice to BDSM, but clearly, he seemed naturally wired for it.
Looking down at him now, it was easy to see that he was agitated, even in rest.  The last half week had been beyond rough.  He was pale and his skin was still somewhat clammy although the all-out sweats had finally ceased.  His lips were obviously dry from dehydration due to nausea and vomiting, but Cas was hopeful that Dean would be able to tackle some soup and fluids when he woke up.
Dean went red and Sam wasn’t sure if it was from anger or frustration, but he was definitely unhappy. Very unhappy. Anger won out briefly because he exploded and came towards Sam as though to shove him out the door, and then he abruptly turned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just let me know if you need anything, okay?” Dean knew it was against her better judgment, but she gave him the location with one more appeal for him to get some sleep before heading out. He lied again. And then she added before hanging up, “I’m so sorry Dean, I know how much he meant to you.”
“Wanna bring me up to speed first, Charles? I haven’t got a clue what you’re talking about.” And honest to God, he didn’t. They’d talked last night before his committee meeting and everything had been great, he had no idea what could have happened.
“When you put it that way…”
Dean sipped his coffee and stared at Cas over the rim. Everything about him looked casual...his clothing, his messy hair, his stubble.  All of it, Dean knew, was carefully put together to make him look relaxed and unintimidating to better blend in. Dean would know, he did the exact same thing. Had been doing it every day since he retired. Blend in, be entirely forgettable.
“Just hear me out, ok? I love you and I’m not going anywhere. You’re it for me, understand? And I’m not letting you go either, so the only option left here is for us to move forward together.  I…uh, thought we could have a fresh start together, maybe…”
“C’mon, Sam.” Dean sputtered and waved his hands towards the pile of books Sam had been trying to research for information on the spell. “All of this is a setup to force something that isn’t real.”
The look Cas gave him was almost tender, the discomfort of it made him shift nervously on his feet. It didn’t escape Cas’ notice.
Hope springs eternal, and a tiny thread of it took root in Castiel’s heart.
“Sounds good to me. When we are out in public, people will still expect me to be the congressman. I don’t think we’ll get very far if you expect me to act like your sub 24/7.”
“Hunh, great. Thanks, Cas.” Dean grinned and turned to his brother and Charlie. “So we get married, then what?”
“Dean, I know how you see yourself. I pulled you out of hell, pieced you back together. I know how love ties you to this world and how without it, you think that you are unworthy and unwanted.” Dean couldn’t look away, he was transfixed and hanging on to whatever words came next. “I know how often you’ve wished to be released from this life, and how often you’ve pushed yourself to keep going. For Sam, for Jack, for the whole world. But never for yourself.”
“Do you think Eileen will always want to be second to Dean? Do you think that would be healthy for your relationship?”
Dean plugged his phone in to charge and left everything else as it was, just in case he had to leave again. Maybe Sam would find something, maybe Cas would find a way to reach out and Dean would go after him. No matter what, he’d be ready.
“Dean Winchester, you sure do scrub up nice.”
“Okay Charlie, this is your pitch. Ready to sell it?”  Sam looked at Charlie who met his question with a determined nod and stood up. “Floor’s all yours.”
“Congressman and Mr. Winchester, let me introduce you to these lovely people. Before I went to retrieve you, we were having a lively discussion on climate change.” Crowly’s charm mode had been fully activated, he was laying it on thick. Dean prepared himself mentally, these were the people Charlie had wanted him to impress. It was showtime.
No wonder the man had said no to impact play and refused to call him Sir. Of course he had a need for praise and was probably affection starved as well. He’d bet his last dollar, which, admittedly wasn’t much right now, on the fact that his new client had a horrific upbringing with an abusive father. Anger and a desire to protect washed over him, muddling the sense of calm he’d been trying to project.  He quietly placed the plate and glass on the table and went to stand directly behind the waiting sub.
The first thing he realized was that Cas hadn’t moved. His hands were still hanging by his sides. Dean had been grabbing and pushing and pulling and tasting, but Cas hadn’t moved an inch. The second thing he noticed was his arousal…or lack thereof. Dean was painfully hard and pressed against Cas in a way that left no room for imagining. He should be feeling Cas’s erection pressed into the thigh that Dean had shoved against his groin. If Cas were aroused at all, even a little, Dean would be feeling it. But he wasn’t.
Now would be a good time to get off his ass and do something before it was too late.
He hung up and looked at the phone. 4:39, two minutes. It took two minutes to change everything. What was he going to do now? Sam, he might as well let sleep. There would be enough to do later.
“You can have water, or you can have the rest of your coffee. I need you to stay with me here.”
A collection of tiny silver lines caught the light along the sensitive skin. Completely different than the rest and clearly self-inflicted. Dean held his breath, waiting for the censure that surely had to come after this discovery. Castiel traced them gently with his fingertips, not in a sexual way, but in a way that offered comfort and kindness.
“Oh yes, I’m keeping you. It’s going to be July all year long.” He was a sucker for men in any kind of uniform, and animals. The two combined? Irresistible.
Cas raised an eyebrow, unimpressed with the answer. “You have to do better than that if you want to be my good boy, Dean. Color?”
Cas obliged instantly, and Dean shifted his body over. Maybe he’d be embarrassed tomorrow, but for today he was going to ask for everything. He threw his leg over Cas’s hip and worked his torso closer so that Cas had his arm around him. Finally, he left the pillow behind and placed his head on Cas’s shoulder, reaching his arm across his chest and pulling them even closer together. He was going to fall asleep clinging to Castiel, and nobody was going to tell him otherwise.
“Do you really speak ‘pretentious dick’?’”
“Maybe one or two things, it’s complicated, but I’ll explain everything. Tomorrow.”
He figured he could get something to eat later, if he was hungry, and he knew for a fact that the overly packed duffle had some protein bars stored in the pockets. He booked a motel room and bought a six-pack from the gas station. It was a small wonder that he let himself. He thought for a second that maybe the spell had been broken because of it, but when he tried to test it by unsuccessfully grabbing for some beef jerky and a pack of cigarettes, he learned that everything was still in play.
“That’s right. Partners”
“Yes Dean?”
“Yeah, story of my life lately, hit me with it.”
Which was why Sam was shocked when he made his way to Rowena’s office and found Dean casually munching from a bowl of candy on her desk. There was no way Rowena would leave a bowl of candy on her desk to snack on, Dean should have known that.
His dresser wasn’t overly crowded, so it was nothing really to move a few things around and vacate one of the drawers for Cas’ things. The condo also had oversize closets and it was very straightforward to split in two equally. Dean might have a half dozen suits and a bit of casual dress wear for work, but his default wardrobe of choice would always be denim and flannel. He had everything he needed and plenty of room to spare. Idly, he wondered what Cas wore in his downtime. He’d seen him dressed as Jimmy, in running gear, and in today’s wedding suit, but what did the real Cas wear?
Dean heard Cas’s footsteps walking away from the door and fading when out of earshot. The sound of a truck door opening and closing was followed by the start of its engine and a few moments of idling.
There was no Cas.  It hadn’t worked.
He really didn’t feel like talking to Sam but knew he’d be wanting an update. If it went too much longer, Sam would probably call anyway, so he might as well beat him to the punch.
“Not yet Cas, we are not done talking.”
“In the interest of being transparent and honest from here on out Sam, you should know that I just told Dean that I love him and that come hell or highwater I won’t be leaving again.”
Cas looked at his lap, silent. Sam turned to his brother.
“Good. Now, we already talked about honesty, but the other thing that is required for our arrangement to be successful is trust. My job is to give you what you need and to trust you to be honest with me, and your job is to trust that everything I do will be for your benefit. Do you understand? Can you summarize that and repeat that back to me?”
Well, there was at least one relief. “Ok, good.”
Bitterly disappointed, he put his back to the door and let himself slide to the floor. Hands in his hair, not caring about the blood, he slouched down while hot tears coursed down his cheeks.  Dean sobbed, the pain at this moment was sharp and nobody was here to see it anyway.
“This is Cas we’re talking about here Sam.” Swallowing, and taking a moment to choose his next words in order to win his brother over, “You know I can’t leave him there if there’s a chance I can get him out, so help me do it right Sammy? I’m doing it no matter what, so it’s better if you use that big brain of yours to make sure we do it right ok?”
What they needed, however, was a bigger bed.
He didn’t wait for a response, only turned and walked into his office, shutting the door behind him. Like the cool, detached dom he was supposed to be.
“Doesn’t it?”
“I want to.”
Rowena. This was Rowena’s doing. This and the music. It had to be. He had to get back to the bunker and dig into Rowena’s books.
“Moving on then, it’s still early, the city is still waking up to the morning news. We have very few hours to get a hold of this story and change the narrative. If we fail, we might as well pack our bags for Kansas, and Castiel here will probably need to leave the country. That’s a joke, but not really.” She pinned them both with a look that meant she was dead serious.
Benny parked the SUV and both men exited the vehicle first, Castiel didn’t miss the visual sweep they conducted before Jack opened his door to usher him out. The younger man smiled, apparently also trying to put him at ease.
“Hello Dean. How are you feeling this morning?” Cas smiled at him with a look he had never seen before. His expression was open and the smile itself reached his eyes, crinkling his laugh lines.
Dean came alongside, it seemed like he wanted to prolong the illusion a while longer as well. Hard conversations could come later.
“And you...” She turned to Castiel and concentrated her ire in one place. “...you represent the worst about this town, about the state of politics. Selling yourself to the…” Dean couldn’t hear any more than that. Charlie was right about him and she could say whatever she wanted, he deserved it. But Dean had read the article and he remembered what it was like to be alone and hungry, having limited options to survive and a brother to care for. He recalled that moment when he realized that the quickest way to get what they needed was on his knees in a dirty bathroom stall or the back of a trucker’s cab. It had never been about choice, it had been about survival. Castiel’s rates might have been higher than anything Dean had ever charged, but the desperation that drove him there had probably been the same. He wasn’t going to let Charlie dump on him or anyone for that.
Dean reaches the stove in two big strides, grabs the pot, and lifts it off the heat. “At least I’m not the only one making a mess around here today.” He turns to wink at Castiel, and the grin that splits his face lights up the entire room.
When it was over, he sat in the dirt next to his own sick and leaned against the front bumper.  Sweaty and exhausted, he just needed to collect himself before doing anything else.  Cas joined him on his right, sitting on the ground by his side and handing him an opened water bottle.  Grateful, Dean half smiled in thanks and used the first two mouthfuls to rinse and spit; trying to wash the acrid taste out of his mouth.
The reality of that statement washed over Dean, he was pissed at the guy, sure, but not like that.
Cas had gotten a head start on the day, waking up early, well ahead of his housemates. Housing near campus was expensive because everything in DC was expensive, but the proximity meant that he didn’t need a car. That and living with five other people made his money stretch and limited the number of clients he needed to take on to make ends meet. Once his program was over and he could find the job he wanted, he’d happily shut the whole thing down.
When he finally felt like the storm had passed, he wiped the tears off his face and took a deep breath meant to shift him into detached soldier mode. He had to go. There was work to do. A second deep breath. A third. He could do this, he had to do this. A fourth. He grabbed his bag; he wasn’t coming back here again. He’d sleep in Baby tonight if he had to, but he was done with this place.
Everything else was done, Sam and Eileen had departed after the last of the moving day pizza was eaten, and Dean and Cas had collapsed on the couch, tired and sore.  Dean reached his left hand to the side and grabbed Cas’s right; his wedding band still shiny from its newness.
“Well, that’s a crock of shit and you know it.” Shit, shit, shit, that’s exactly what happened. Dean’s internal panic level kicked up several notches.
More or less following instruction, they stayed put for the entire week. Days of being together stretched into evenings exploring each others’ bodies, which ultimately led them into chilly nights where they cuddled and slept on top of the memory foam mattress but under the honeybee quilt.  They talked in reverse, unwinding and re-evaluating everything they knew about their relationship from Cas’s confession in the bunker to Dean waking up in his own coffin after being brought out of Hell. Dean talked about John, about Sam, and about how he wanted Sam to build his own life and be happy. Cas talked about Jack, about Chuck, and how in all of time he never truly felt like he belonged anywhere until now.
Jimmy flashed a smile and once again left to tend to the others.
The closer Dean got to the stables, the more the smell of manure got stronger, the smell an odd comfort for him. The doors of the barn were open, allowing fresh air to be blown in. Not all the stalls were occupied ; out of ten stalls, only 6 were occupied. As Dean walked to the tack room, he was greeted with varying snickers and whinnies. Six heads at differing heights had their heads out of the stalls looking towards the man that would turn them out for the day. With halters in hand, Dean took two at a time to the paddock- first the draft pairs, Clementine and Maggie, followed by Decklan the quarter horse and Ditzy the paint, and lastly Lucky and Caddie, each unknown but worth more than their weight in gold. Each horse had been on the ranch for many years but none as long as Lucky. He was a bay gelding that his father had bought Dean for his 5
On top of the individuals head was a well fitted crown adorned with black and green jewels imbedded in the gold. His clothes were just as expensive with leather riding boots, a pair of pants that were a rich indigo and a white tunic. Not a stain could be seen. The clean-shaven face was smiling brightly and his eyes seemed to almost be closed from either the sun or laughing so much. Suddenly, it hit Castiel like a brick. The prince. He had ventured out of the castle.
So many questions ran through Dean’s head and it took all he could muster to keep from cursing outwardly. Groaning in frustration, Dean took the book with him as he went through the house, turning out lights as he went and he made sure there was nothing out of place for the morning. He told himself he would help his father with the pick up tomorrow and that would require him to wake up early. His father’s wrath was something he didn’t want to face two days in a row because of his stupid mistakes.
Castiel’s eye flew wide open in recognition.
“Thanks,” was all that was said of the prince as his strides turned into a quick jog once no one was around.
Dean stared up at the ceiling but sleep never came. The sound of rain never dulled, and the storm made its presence known with the rumble of thunder and the occasional flash of lightening. Giving up on sleep, Dean got out of bed and made his way to the half-lit kitchen. There he smelt coffee already brewing and a figure leaning against the kitchen counter.
I feel bad for all the descriptive writing but someone has to describe these places lol.
“Cas, I’m begging you, don’t give up. I’m here, I got you, everything is ok now.” Dean leaned down and kissed his forehead, a fresh tear dripping off of his cheek, splattering just to the right on Cas’s skin.
“I was just trying to send the trash out, Crowley. But by all means, you are free to join them.” God, the man was a disgusting troll. Dean wondered if Sam could get him out of a murder charge.
“I liked it there, I did. It was a friendly school, and I was enjoying that feeling of being normal.  Dean was 16 at that point, pretty much done with the whole school scene, so he just hung out at the motel, made sure there was food to eat and did whatever to take care of things you know? Dad had said that Dean wasn’t ready to face a vamp and didn’t bother bringing him along, his job was me. It was a really great time Cas, we hung out, we laughed, and it just felt good to have some stability.”
The angel had barely left his room since, and if Sam didn’t know any better, he’d say that Cas was depressed. Withdrawn, quiet, avoiding both he and Dean, Sam was more than a little worried about Castiel, that maybe something had happened in the Empty, something that he hadn’t shared with them. The three of them had each had their experiences with torture and trauma over the years, if that’s what was going on, he hoped Cas would bring it up when he was ready to talk about it.
“And I wouldn’t have been there if you weren’t.”
“Don’t you want my help?”
“Hey! Eileen and I helped. I’m the only one tall enough to reach some of these lights!” More laughs. “Where are Dean and Cas anyway?” Sam had clearly caught on that something was up.
“Pass me the phone when it rings, please.” As if his words were magic, the screen on his phone lit up. It was definitely his mother’s number. Charlie slid the phone over, he went to pick it up and walk away, but Dean stayed his hand.
“So, ah, what happens next Cas?”
Castiel popped off and looked up at Dean who was struggling to stay in place. He itched to run his hands through Castiel’s hair, if they weren’t scening he’d want to grab both sides off his head and thrust into his mouth until he came. But he couldn’t, and the fact that he was at the other man’s mercy, was incendiary.
“Morning Sunshine.”
“Wait, somebody tried to kidnap you?” Dean turned to his side and asked Castiel directly, but Benny, who had been watching everything unfold, answered instead.
“Castiel, please, I’m gonna…” He gasped, hoping Castiel would understand.
That was reasonable Dean supposed, but what would that mean for them? Were they supposed to go around acting married? For how long? Again, each answer begat more questions and his head was starting to hurt. Dean picked up his fork and tried to eat while his brain worked to make sense of things. Hard to believe that only a few hours ago his biggest concern was getting to the coffee shop before they ran out of pie for the day.
It was Sam’s turn to bring it home. “This last part is my idea ok?  Jody knows this therapist who is familiar with our world, monsters and all that. I’m tired too you know, maybe not exactly the same as you, but I know that I need more help than I can do on my own and deep down you must know that you do too.  I was hoping maybe we could start out together? Work out our shit at the same time, get some peace of mind? Would you do that with me Dean? I don’t want to lose you and I don’t want to live this way anymore either. Please? For me?”
Younger Dean was there, standing at the corner of the truck stop where the parking lot met a darker alley that ran between the restaurant and gas station.  The station was already closed for the night and the restaurant looked like it was just down to a few late-night stragglers. It was obvious that Dean was standing around and waiting, with nowhere to go and in no hurry to leave.  Even from where Cas stood at a distance, he could see his too thin frame and hollow expression, shoulders hunched.  His dark t-shirt, jean jacket, and tennis shoes reminded him of Jack, and Cas let himself pause for a moment to imagine how he’d have felt to see his adoptive son surviving like this.  The thought crushed him, and in the same moment, he both grieved for the child Dean never got to be, and hated John Winchester that much more.
And that was fair, he didn’t know about the spell. He didn’t know what Dean had been through in the past twenty-four hours. All he knew was that Dean had rejected and then hurt him, and now he was offering the opposite. Prayer or not, trust had to be rebuilt.
The bed creaked under his weight as he sat on the edge. Tossing the bag on the floor by his feet, he ran both hands through his short sandy hair and left them there. Head down, raked by bitter sobs, he gave himself up to it. Idly, he thought that he didn’t even think he had enough water left in him to make tears, but they were there anyway. His mind was awash in loss, in “might have beens” and “what ifs.” Not that that would help. He had to stow his crap and get the job done.
Four. A few birds could be heard making noise when the A/C unit was off. Dawn would be approaching soon and a new day starting for everyone who had been lucky enough to have any kind of peaceful night’s sleep. Not Dean, not this night. He’d lay here for another hour or so and then go for coffee, maybe check with Sam again. He at least should have gotten some sleep and Dean was loathe to disturb it.
“He ditched his phone Sam, I found it.” Dean could hear the weight of that sink in.
“Exactly, after my middle name.”
Dean shifted from side to side slightly so Cas would loosen his grip and eased himself down the bed, twisting at the same time so they were positioned face to face.  Cas’s arm was still resting over his torso, hand now on his shoulder blade, encouraging Dean to get closer as if that were possible.  Clearly, Dean thought to himself, he wasn’t the only cuddler in this relationship.
“Hold me to it. Hold me Cas. What if I want you to hold me?”
“Has memory foam? Yes Dean, how could I forget?” Cas smiled and tried to pull Dean a bit closer although it really wasn’t possible. “Anything for you Dean, you just have to ask.”
A tinge of sadness quickly passed across Cas’ face. “I didn’t really expect you to remember, but I hoped that you would.”
“Sammy, you’re my lawyer, tell Charlie her idea is off base.”
Dean lost it. “Cas I’m so sorry, I fucked up, I know I fucked up. Please forgive me, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Don’t leave me again, please. I can’t, I just can’t do this without you anymore.  I need you; I love you too, I just don’t know how to tell you. I’m so scared, please don’t leave me again Cas, please.”
He caressed the long jagged one, his touch only just perceivable. It made Dean shudder just the same. Castiel leaned into him and whispered in his ear, his deep voice warm and soothing.
“After the Empty took you, there wasn’t anytime to grieve because we had to deal with Chuck.  Dean never talked about what happened in the dungeon, but I’d be up studying and would hear him having nightmares Cas. Always the same, calling for you, asking you to come back. Those dreams were every night, Cas.  Every evening he would drink until he nearly forgot his own name, and then spend all night calling out for you. In fact, they only stopped when you showed up at the door two days ago.”
Opening the oven door, he spies the burgers. Only, the once plump and juicy patties are now dry and overcooked. Frustration overcomes him and he dumps the burgers into the sink too with a heavy sigh.
Dean’s heart swelled, seeing Cas happy, knowing he did that, he didn’t think it was possible to love someone more. Cas lit up with enthusiasm. “Dean, we have to go to the pet store first. We need a litter box and some food, toys, a collar…”
“The fuck is that supposed to mean?” Internally, Dean was completely terrified with the turn in the conversation. Nuh-uh-huh, no way was this how they were going to have that conversation.
That was probably more kindness than Cas thought he deserved, but he was thankful.
“Cas, Bobby is basically Sam, Charlie, and mine’s father.”
"The Sandlot," Cas states in amusement.
“And do you believe me when I tell you that I love you?”
“Well no bu-“
“Well, I’ve been leaving you to your nerd studies. Just figured you’d want to be left alone with Rowena’s books and shit.”
Castiel would never complain about the time he had spent nursing Dean back to health after the accident, and he would never blame Dean for still needing help now. He couldn’t—he loves Dean too much for any of those feelings to ever mean anything in the face of the utter relief he felt the day Dean started breathing without the help of machines, or the day he took his first step without his cane. The effort and time spent on assisting Dean in life means nothing when he thinks about how lucky and how grateful he is to be alive at the same time as Dean, to be able to share this life with him.
“Did I say you could talk…Boy?  Let me make myself a little more clear.”  Cas put his hand back on John’s forehead and linked some chosen memories from his mind into Johns, ones to frighten him, war and hell, misery and suffering, death and destruction on a scale that John couldn’t be able to comprehend beyond knowing he was little more than a bug to be squashed in this moment.  The fear in his eyes went right to terror, and Castiel smirked in satisfaction at the sound of John urinating himself.
“Well, he’s a good reference. Let’s move on then.”  He opened up his tablet to review the agreement that he had shared with Dean in advance. The man had completed the form, and only a review was necessary. He’d been surprised to see that impact play was firmly in the no category, very uncommon for his typical clientele.  “I’ve read your list of preferences as well as those kinks you wish to avoid.  I also see that you have a long list of things that you are open to exploring but don’t have a definitive answer for yet.”
“Hi Sam, thanks for waiting by the phone.  This is a good time to talk?”
“Um, yeah, if that’s okay?”
And while he was still smiling that wry smile, the rest of Sam’s expression and focus made it clear that he was indeed serious. He let his words hang into the uncomfortable silence, because really, what could either of them say? After a few awkward moments, once he was sure his point was made, Sam leaned down to hug Castiel. “I really am glad to have you back Cas. I missed you.”
“Maybe a little? But I want this more than anything.”
Dean looked at him warily, he didn’t really like having his privacy breached. “Not sure how I feel about that guys.”
“Yeah Dean, it was the candy. Rowena…left it for you.”
He felt an overwhelming need to move, to touch, to do something. Instead, he glared back at Cas and remained silent. If he didn’t say anything, if he focused on staying still, maybe he'd make it through and get Cas to leave.
“Mean what?”
“Thanks, Cas. For everything.”

“Is it really you?”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously and chewed his bottom lip for a moment.
“What in the Sam Hill were you thinking, Dean?”
“Dean, there’s more.” Cas was like a dog with a bone today.
The room was gorgeous.  Home décor magazine gorgeous.  Softly lit by two lamps, Dean knew that it would be even nicer in the daylight tomorrow, but right now? Wow. Three walls were painted a soft dove grey -   indeed the color of the speckles he had seen in Cas’ hair.  The fourth wall, behind the headboard, was a deeper blue-grey, and the bed itself was king size and covered in sage green bedding that Cas had turned down in invitation already.
*A: Взаимно, очень приятно встретить кого-то столь осведомленного. Вынужден признаться, наблюдал за вашим именем в новостях - очевидно, пресса не отдает вам должного. Примите мои искренние поздравления по поводу свадьбы. (The pleasure is mine, Mr Novak, it is refreshing to meet someone who is so well informed. I must admit that I’ve been following the news, clearly, the press understates who you really are. Please accept my sincere congratulations on your new marriage.)
“You heard the doctor, get me my clothes Sammy.”
“Dean?!  Where are you?” Nothing.
“Breakfast is almost ready.”  He nodded towards the table where two places were set, one of which had a steaming mug of coffee waiting. “I fixed your coffee the way you like it, have a seat and I’ll bring the plates over.”
“You could never be a liability. Don’t say that.” Dean couldn’t name the expression on Cas’ face, but if he had to pick something, fond, might have been it. “My reasons are my own. Perhaps I am more selfish than you think.”
“Dude, rare objects are exactly that: rare. We should store those first.”
“Funny, Dean. Who do you think it is? Can I come in?”
“Green, Castiel. I’m green.”
“It’s the canary in the coal mine for all of us. A mass melting of Yukutia’s perma-frost would have a devastating effect by releasing stored greenhouse gases.” Dean saw respect on the ambassador’s face.
“’M so grateful for everything you’ve done for me this year,” Dean continues, lips now pressed against Castiel’s neck again. “I thought it’s time you start doing things for
Dean couldn’t answer right away, what was Cas doing here?
By the time he was done and finished signing his life away, Dean returned with a small platter of sandwiches and a plate of cookies. A quick snack before the next wave of business, and as good a time as any to talk about the plan.
“Anything.”
Strap in for the ride, friends.  Further updates will follow, I've got a story to tell.
She got to work, Sam went into the kitchen to get set up for lunch, and Bobby excused himself to make a couple of phone calls to his office. That left Cas alone with Dean for the first time that day. Eyeing the balcony he gestured towards it and invited Dean to step out so they could talk in private.
“Are you the one responsible for the scars on Dean’s back?” He growled and postured in a way that let the older man know that he wasn’t going to back down. Bobby for his part shot his eyebrows up in surprise, it probably wasn’t often that anyone thought to challenge him.
“Want me to what?” For a millennia-old former angel, he wasn’t catching on too quickly.
Cas knew that had been his first big gamble of the conversation but noted that neither of them actually objected and he could see a little bit of tension ease out of Sam’s shoulders. Clearly, Sam understood the subtext of what was happening. He smiled and gave Dean’s hands a reassuring squeeze.
“Wow, ain’t she a ray of sunshine?” They picked up their menus, although they probably didn’t need to. Every diner served pretty much exactly the same thing. Dean looked to be about as cheerful as she did. It promised to be a fun meal.
“Finally, before I sign the discharge paperwork, let me say that I think physically you’ll get through the next part Dean.  You are going to feel terrible for a few days yet, and it could take a while for those hand tremors to go away, but eventually, they will.  If, however, you don’t feel right, come back straight away.  And really, consider getting a family doctor at some point, there is no record of you in our system and I’m guessing you are at least a decade overdue for a proper medical exam.”  Turning to smile brightly at Cas and Sam she added: “OK gentleman, are you ready to take your patient home?  Here’s a script for the medication, if you don’t have any more questions the waiting room is filling up and I’ll be off to my next patient.”
The sun made the smell of the approaching animals grow stronger and burn the inside of Castiel and his company's nostrils. Or to the village folk, the stench could have been from the men who were drenched in sweat from their metallic cages. Iron chest plates, boots, armguards, and leg armor announced their presence to even the deaf it would seem like. Upon their armor was the royal crest. On Castiel's shield was a chevron and outlined in front of it was a wyvern. If there was color to it, the background would be green, the chevron black, and outline of the winged creature red.
“You’d help a stranger? In the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere?” The stranger scoffed and ran a hand through his hair.
