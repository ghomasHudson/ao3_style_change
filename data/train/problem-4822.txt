Dean leans over and takes Castiel's face in his hand, sliding his fingers through the hair behind Castiel's ear, pressing their mouths together in a gentle kiss. Dean intends to leave it at that, but Castiel has other ideas, and he curls his fist in Dean's shirt, pulling the werewolf into his body. Dean lands in Castiel's lap and flattens his hands against the headboard on either side of Castiel's head to steady himself before he almost falls off the side of the bed and crashes to the floor. He muffles a laugh in Castiel's hair and says, "We're not making out."
Dean starts like he likes it, short, fast strokes with a tight hand before he can work up to putting his mouth on Castiel. When he does, he just puts his mouth around the head of it, sucking. The taste is weird, but not bad, so Dean goes back in, a little further this time, choking when he goes too far down.
-*-*-
'. He's so consumed with  Castiel's body and with the possessive streak he's apparently just developed that it doesn't occur to him that no one probably cares enough to be watching.
"Yes."
Benny makes a face at Dean. "I have to work Friday."
“How much longer?”
There's a wait as Castiel types, and then finally, after what feels like ten minutes, the text comes through. It's a long one.
Well, the girls do, and Castiel does, but Dean finds he can't, not when he's completely overcome by the urge to kiss Castiel again. Now that he's done it, and Castiel accepted and willingly participated in it, it's like Dean can't stop thinking about it.
"Can I come in?" He asks, signing while he says the words. Eileen looks back into the room then shrugs, stepping to the side so Castiel can pass her. Sam's sitting on the edge of the bed in a pair of pyjama pants and a shirt Castiel is pretty sure was one of Dean's, and his hair is also wet. The look he shoots at Castiel is one of understanding - like he knows exactly why he's here and is just waiting for Castiel to admit it. "Uh… do I… am I attracted to Dean?"
“I’ve been human before, and I haven’t presented thus far.”
"She's at the hospital, we'll have to pick her up on the way through," Jody tells him, squeezing his shoulder like she can tell he's worried.
Dean’s entire body feels like it’s on fire, blindingly hot, and he feels so close to coming, though they’ve barely been at it any time at all. He’s not sure what’ll send him over the edge, though he doesn’t think it’ll take a lot.
"Mm-hm," Emma replies, giving Dean an unimpressed look. "Whatever it is, get over it."
Castiel nods and Bobby goes back to typing. Dean pulls Castiel, Rowena, and Sam into the kitchen, shuts the door behind them and says, "Right, anyone got any ideas, cause I don't think guns blazing is going to work."
The gun does go off, a bullet shooting straight through the wood and plating and striking the wall on the other side of the room. Inside the drawer, next to the rigged up gun, is a small vial of shining blue liquid, and Dean suddenly remembers seeing it in Bevell's hands in the Nephilim's vision.
Dean nods his head and turns back to the woman so she knows to continue. She nods and says, “Olivia gave me a number, to call in case of an emergency. It was for a guy called Buddy or something. I called a few weeks ago after the third body appeared. It took me a week just to find the damn thing, I left it in a box for thirteen years. Anyway. A woman named Jody answered, and she sent me onto Garth.”
Dean shrugs then turns to shoot Castiel a smile. "Maybe. Where do you want to go?"
"Hey, Cas," Dean greets, smiling brightly at him. He really wants to lean down and kiss him, but he's not sure if Castiel's had that particular conversation with his kids yet, or even if he had, if he felt comfortable kissing Dean or Benny in front of them. So instead, he just stares at Castiel's mouth for a stupid amount of time, thinking about the last time he kissed Castiel, before he finally looks away. He shoots a smile at Castiel's kids and says, "You guys must be Claire and Jack. I'm Dean."
"Guess so."
Lucifer shoots him a look, almost bored, and replies, "Fine."
When they manage to calm themselves down, Dean holds Sam at arm’s length so he can look at him. "You look like dad, you know, but fuck did you get tall. I swear dad was never this tall."
When they get to St Robert’s they find a motel and pay for a single for seven nights, leaving their belongings in the room and dressing in their suits. While they drive to the police station, Dean has Castiel read Garth’s file on the murders, so they’re both well versed in the case’s details.
Eileen’s cheeks tinge red. “Yes. Penetration helps. I’ll… we’ll get some things for you, just in case. Okay?”
"It's not dead forever, completely fixable, but I need a special part for it. I'll have to get it shipped from Michigan. Could take a couple weeks."
"Sort of…?" Patience sips at her drink then frowns thoughtfully. "Like when your ears ring? And there was this smoke, like a cloud of blueish smoke."
Castiel shrugs. "Sure, text me time and place."
Dean leans over the counter with his elbows planted in the granite and says, "I don't either."
They visit the morgue after lunch and examine each of the bodies. Quite a lot more flesh is missing than Dean first thought - on the second victim he can see rib bone - solidifying Dean’s theory on ghouls.
When he looks over at Jody, he can tell this is a sensitive topic for the women, and that they've probably argued about it often. So he veers away from it, turning to Castiel to ask, "So, how do we summon the archangels?"
But then his red hoodie disappears, too.
Castiel's words are like a bucket of cold ice.
"I like your car," he says, smiling thoughtfully, running his hand over the dashboard. "Chevrolet?"
They crash in a motel for the night, grabbing a set of keys to a double from the office. Emma offers Claire some pyjamas for the night and Castiel promises her clothes hunting in the morning. Emma and Claire share the bed furthest from the door and front windows, and Cas and Dean take the bed closest.
Benny sighs, longsuffering, and takes the tray of clean glasses from the kitchen window, handing it to Dean to stack. "He said he was here for a funeral, and that's it. He also didn't seem too sad about the funeral, so he probably didn't care too much about who it was for."
When Eileen opens the door, she's wearing one of the thick grey robes Dean still calls
He has to kneel down to dry the hubcaps, and because he's enjoying being a shit, he sits a little further away from them than he normally would so he has to lean over and plant a hand on the floor, his back arched just a bit.
Rowena waves her hand over the pot and the fire goes out, and when she turns back to Dean, the flash of purple in her eyes slowly fades back to their normal green. She raises one eyebrow and Dean uses the hand on Castiel's wrist to steer him closer to Rowena before releasing his grip. She considers Castiel, circling around him like a predator with a finger tracing her bottom lip. She pauses to wave a hand in front of him, her eyes shining purple again.
The sun is still up in Sioux Falls, and as soon as Castiel lands he shifts back into a raven. Dean sighs.
Dean’s starting to see the plan.
dead."
Rowena's also frowning. "Neither have I."
They all go quiet for a long time, staring at each other, until finally, Gabriel says, "The Cage."
to say the least. He looks for it for a few days, then resigns himself to its absence, happy to continue on with his life without it.
Gabriel looks up from the chocolate bar he's been eating, eyebrows furrowed, and says, "You accused me of working with Lucifer? He's a bag of dicks."
couldn't miss. He braces his foot on the couch as Jody straps a holster to his thigh, before walking around the room a few times to get used to the extra weight.
The oldest child and Ollie both frown, before the oldest says, “I don’t know what that means.”
"Dean?" He hears Sam say. He turns his head up to look at his brother. "I'm gonna go call Mia, okay?"
It's eleven thirty in the morning in Uzbekistan, one thirty in the morning in Kansas, and they're mostly ready, though they haven't gotten the all-clear from the angels. They were supposed to send someone at eleven, and Dean doesn't know if they're making a point or if something's gone wrong. He hopes it's the former.
"I take it he told you about Fergus?" It takes Dean a second to figure out to whom Claire is referring, simply because Castiel's only referred to his ex-husband as Crowley. He nods. "I remember a lot of those years, even if dad would like to pretend that I don't. So just remember that, and just know I have a concealed carry permit."
,” the oldest child hisses, turning back to shoot a look at the other two children.
The humans appear from the line of trees, three of them, dressed in the hunter garb with guns no doubt packed with silver bullets. He hopes they're stupid enough to mistake him for a real wolf, but he doesn't count on it.
Their hands break apart so they can exit the car, and Dean meets Castiel at the passenger side. Dean's not sure what he wants to say to Castiel, and even if he did know, he doesn't get the chance, because Castiel says, "Is it alright if I kiss you, Dean?"
"Oh." Castiel drops back onto his bed and sighs heavily. "There is nothing we can do to expedite the process?"
Sam never touches him like that.
"Now the teeth?" Dean asks him, making a disgusted face. Castiel inclines his head in confirmation, and with a hand on Dean's elbow and the sound of flapping wings, they move on.
He feels wrong, like his whole life is a lie. If this wolf is his brother where the fuck has he been for almost forty years? How did he survive the hunters’ massacre? Who took him? He muffles his crying into Castiel's neck and finds comfort in the hand rubbing soothingly over his shoulder. Castiel's face is pressed into his hair, whispering kind words, and Dean can't hear them over his muffled sobs, but they help somehow - help him feel less like he's coming apart at the seams, or maybe that Castiel is stitching him back up as he does.
"Oh," Castiel replies, frowning thoughtfully. "I guess we have. Is that… bad?"
"Yes you do, and I promise I'll make it up to you. You and me, Chillo's, six on Friday."
"Ay, sit. We'll leave soon," Benny tells him, holding him down with a hand on his thigh. Castiel has a hand on Dean's other thigh, and instead of thinking about climbing out of their grips and throwing hands with a bitch, he thinks very hard about their fingertips leaving bruises on his flesh. Hard being the operative word.
Before the first time Dean and Benny had sex, Dean figured Benny would fuck like he talked, slow and rough, like honey sliding down his throat. He was pleasantly surprised to find that Benny fucks like a goddamned maniac, bruises on Dean's hips in the shape of his fingertips, keeping Dean breathless as he rode him to the edge faster than anyone had ever gotten Dean there. Dean will never admit it to Benny, cause he's already got a big head, but he's most definitely the best sex Dean has ever had.
Castiel pushes away from Dean and stumbles towards the disembodied collar before Dean can stop him. The beast growls, but doesn't pounce, and Castiel manages to take the book out from the collar before flying backwards into Dean, who catches him around the middle to steady him.
, Dean replies. Then,
"I'm not suggesting we wake them, Castiel," Gabriel replies, also in a hiss. "I'm not suggesting we involve them at all."
Dean's only response is to hum, and when Castiel looks up at him, he's got his lip between his teeth, worrying at the skin, looking deep in thought. He doesn't say anything, barely even registers Castiel's trying to get his attention until Castiel says his name again. His eyes refocus and the smile he bestows to Castiel is beautiful. Dean reaches up with his free hand and takes Castiel's face into it, running his thumb over his cheekbone. Castiel gets the urge to lean forward and press his mouth to Dean's, and he's just about to when Dean pulls his hand away again and says, "C'mon, Cas, let's go home."
Dean turns back towards the road and walks towards the garage, rolling his eyes when he's sure Castiel wont see it.
Castiel snorts into Dean’s shoulders, pressing a kiss to the bony skin there. Dean’s arms come up around Castiel and hold him tight to him, and he kisses Castiel back. “I need ten minutes before I’m back to normal.”
“I am.” Dean says with his best innocent grin, turned back to Castiel behind him.
Dean chokes a bit on his own saliva. He
“You like biting,” Castiel replies, pouting.
There's another pair of pants in the bag and he holds them and the only shirt he owns out to the other man, who accepts them gratefully. Castiel climbs out of the furs to pull them on before diving back under again, no longer shivering.
Eileen winces. “Closer to a week for your first heat,” she tells him, her face sympathetic. “It’s far worse because your body is new to the feeling. Eventually it’ll become accustomed to it.”
Castiel frowns. "Meg."
Jack bursts into laughter, and thank God for both Dean and Castiel's sakes, he seems to take Dean's answer, chatting about how much he likes the bolognese. His rushed one-sided conversation about the food turns into an explanation as to why he can't eat meat - apparently he got bitten by a tick when he was younger which gave him a meat allergy. It seems extremely ridiculous, so he has to look to Castiel for confirmation, which he gets. He makes a mental note to ask Castiel more later.
Dean gets more and more nervous as the time goes on with no sign of an angel, until finally, ten minutes before they're supposed to leave, five minutes after they've sent Kaia, Patience and Alex to Rowena's townhouse in Minsk, a crack of white light shines through the room. When it clears, the man it reveals is short and svelte, with caramel-coloured hair and Grace-shining blue eyes. He smells strongly of power, as much power as Lucifer and Michael have. He's not a simple angel, he's another archangel. Dean knows very little about biblical canon, but he does know that there are four archangels: Michael, Lucifer, Raphael and Gabriel.
“I love you too, Dean,” Castiel replies, eyes closed again and voice soft as he lays himself against Dean’s body.
Castiel curves his hand and taps his fingers against his temple -
"Do you have a boyfriend? My dad needs one."
Castiel smiles toothily at Dean and lets go of him so he can pick up the rope and begin rolling it around his hand and tying it up, doing the same with the next piece of rope. Dean watches him do it, sitting back to lean against the headboard.
"He's dead, Cas. It's not him. Hunters killed my brother when he was six months old." Dean feels a little like he might cry. So many emotions are fogging his mind and he can't hold them back.
"I'm coming back, hold on," Dean tells him, wiping his hand and cock clean before climbing back onto the bed to do the same for Castiel. Once they're both as clean as they're going to get without a shower he throws the towel away and pulls Castiel into his arms, throwing the quilt over them. "There we go."
When Deanna gets to Claire, she doesn't hold her hand out straight away, instead she stands in front of her, at least a foot shorter than Claire, and says, "Your hair's cool, I like David Bowie, too." She sticks her hand out then and Claire shakes it, a little taken aback.
Benny's hips have stopped moving, and as Castiel pulls out of Dean carefully, Dean turns to Benny and says, "Hey asshole, not that I'm not all for orgasms, but I was enjoying that, so what the fuck?"
Jack stays for three days - eating and sleeping, watching TV pressed in between Dean and Castiel - before disappearing again, just in time for Sam and Eileen’s return. Eileen pulls Castiel aside quietly to ask him how everything went, and Castiel has to explain that he never even got a chance to speak to Dean thanks to Jack’s appearance.
Dean chews his bottom lip and stares down at his phone, trying to think. "What if we get breakfast at speedway on Sunday morning?"
Dean mumbles through the tape, trying to move his mouth, opening his eyes wide, and jerking his head to the side. He’s not sure if he’s getting his point across for a moment, until the oldest breaks away from the other two and reaches forward to rip the tape off of Dean’s mouth.
"Hey sweetheart, whiskey please," he doesn't bother telling her which, she knows. He's been in often enough.
He starts in at the belly, removing a chunk of its flesh to chew on a few feet away so he can watch the raven. Now that he's opened the belly of the moose it takes the opportunity to feed on the flesh flayed open by his teeth. It shrills at him, like in thanks.
Castiel frowns, tilting his head to the side as he tries to process Dean's words. "Dean, humans who were born male cannot become pregnant, it couldn't have been yours, mine or Sam's."
Dean kisses Castiel again. “C’mon, let's get these kids somewhere safe,” he replies, squeezing Castiel’s wrist gently in his hand before the two of them climb into the car.
Dean stares at Castiel for a long time, mouth slightly open in shock, and Castiel grows worried, terrified he's about to be rejected. He's been rejected by Dean before, but not in this way, not for the way he wants Dean, and he's not sure he can take it. He's about to pull away, save himself from further humiliation when Dean finally speaks, "Me, too. Well, I don't mean that I think you love me, I mean that I think I love you, too." Dean screws up his mouth before it smooths out into a smile. "Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure I do. Have for a while."
'. Of course, it had far more to do with me conceiving a child with a human. Fucking bigots."
Castiel's cheeks flush so red that it just makes him more adorable, and when Dean expresses his endearment, Castiel hides his face behind a menu and tells him to fuck off. When Dean looks over at Benny he has the bottle in his hand and he's blushing too. Dean realises just how easy it's going to be to get the other two to like each other.
Dean drops the hare at his feet and sits back on his haunches, tilting his head to the side in curiosity, hoping it conveys the question he can't ask;
Castiel's face has gone pale. "Do you… do you think my family's dead, too?"
Castiel’s grin brightens again. Magic words. “Make me.”
Benny's fingers dig harder into Dean's hips and he fucks his cock faster into Dean, deeper until Dean's prostate is so overstimulated he's sure if he took his hand away from his own dick he'd come just from that. It'd probably take him awhile, though, he's no spring chicken, and he really wants to come
Castiel and Gabriel transport them to Luxembourg, into a large sitting room where Jody, Donna, Alex, Claire, Patience, Kaia, and Crowley are waiting. It's a tearful reunion between Bobby and the women, and despite how much Bobby tries to pretend he's not relieved to see them all, he lets them each give him a tight hug and tries to hide the shine in his eyes.
They make it back through the portal in time, into the lounge room where the others are waiting. Just as the first portal disappears a second one materialises in the same spot and they're pushed into it.
over. And it ended so much easier than he thought it would.
later, despite deciding it would most definitely be worth it.
Part 2
Castiel climbs to his feet and pulls his shirt over his head, leaving himself bare-chested as he fiddles with the button of his jeans. He’s trying to look coy, and if Dean didn’t know him any better, he would almost fall for it. “And how exactly do you want me on the bed Dean?”
"When?"
Castiel laughs. “Kinda the point, baby, if you don’t want me to do it again though, I won’t.” He leans over and presses a gentle kiss to where he’d bitten Dean.
Sam claims Rowena has been teaching him magic - which isn’t entirely untrue, just not the whole truth. Dean’s seen the looks, the touches. He isn’t stupid.
"Naomi Oksana? What about her?"
"Smells like death in there," Bobby Singer says once he stops hacking. He looks up at the people around him, frowning. "Anyone gonna help me outta here?" Sam takes the man's hand and helps him out of his coffin, setting him onto his feet in the grass. "So, which one of you idjits decided to interrupt my eternal rest?"
Dean rolls his hips, fucking his cock up into Castiel slowly and Castiel groans into the air, face tilted up towards the sky. A smug feeling akin to possessiveness tears through his gut when he imagines who could be watching them, and he sucks another mark at the crook of Castiel's throat, fucking his hips up harder as if to say '
"Awesome, he said yes," Dean says, grinning brightly at Benny, climbing to his feet and leaning over Benny's desk with his hand braced on the edge. "You know what would totally make this better."
Castiel takes a hold of Dean's hips and pulls him forward, lining his cock up with Dean's hole and slowly pushing in. Dean hadn't forgotten about how thick Castiel's dick was, but he's getting a reminder anyway, and it's not the most comfortable experience in the universe. He leans back on his arms and lets his head fall back so he's staring up at the concrete ceiling of the garage, and Castiel goes slow, without having to be asked, stopping every now and then to let Dean adjust. Dean takes a breath and tilts his hips up, turning his head to find Benny. Benny's standing to the left of them, in front of the hood, and reaches over to pull him in for a kiss, meeting him halfway. The distraction works, cause Dean barely notices Castiel bottoming out, hips pressed to Dean's ass, fingers digging into his hips.
. Nonetheless, he takes the long way back into town, and doesn't realise until he's pulling into the parking lot of the bed and breakfast that he's still holding Castiel's hand.
When it gets too cold outside, they get back into the car with the heater on, but they don't leave just yet, collapsed in the back seat while Dean's Kansas tape plays on the stereo. They don't have sex, they don't do anything more than kiss between the stupid stories they share; like the time Dean broke his arm as a kid falling of the top bunk of he and Sam's bunk bed, despite John telling him not to hang off the side, and the time Castiel fell of his bike and stacked it as a kid, breaking three of his baby teeth, or the time Benny tried to jump off the roof into the pool as a kid and ended up hitting his leg on the edge of the pool, snapping the bone. They don't get back into town until past midnight, and they crash in Benny's bed.
"You think a magic man cursed you?" Sorcerers, at least, Dean knows about. He's met a few over the years, that’s where he goes when he needs healing potions and he doesn't feel comfortable going into human towns. They ask fewer questions.
situation."
Castiel turns a smile up to Dean, reaching over to plug in his seat belt, and says, "So, where are we going tonight?"
"I swear to the gods, Lucifer, we don't have time for your devil schtick," Castiel sounds like a snotty younger brother (which Dean supposes he is) and Dean coughs into his fist to cover a laugh. "Who's been protecting her?"
Dean laughs and says, “Alright, I promise I’ll give it back.”
A thought pops into his head, reminding him to grab condoms and lube, and it's not until he's standing there with the things in his hands that he realises that it wasn't
Dean lets out a loud guffaw and leans over to slap the back of his hand over Castiel's hip in a playful manner, leaving his hand on Castiel's hip when he's done it. "It was a joke, Cas."
Dean reaches his hand down and aligns his cock with Castiel's slick hole, thrusting his hips up carefully until the head of his dick pops through the ring of muscle and into Castiel's body. Castiel groans, throwing his head back against the tree trunk, tilting his hips towards Dean and down, forcing more of Dean's cock inside him than Dean would have given him so quickly. A flush has worked its way from the apples of Castiel's cheeks down his chest, leaving his skin a nice shade of pink that Dean wants to suck red marks into. So he does. He gets his mouth on Castiel's shoulder and sucks a bruise into the pale skin there, fingers digging more bruises into the flesh of Castiel's thighs.
Castiel doesn't understand humans, and he certainly doesn't understand Dean.
It's from Castiel, and Dean's chest grows tight when he reads it. He waves at the others as he passes them, heading through the back hallway and into the office. Benny's there - on the phone - and Dean falls into the couch to wait for him, going into the messenger app to reply to Castiel.
Castiel’s eyes blink open and he leans up slightly to look at Dean’s neck, and says, “Maybe a little.”
Castiel’s next indication that his presentation is coming is not a fever, but rather the sudden appearance of Dean’s old leather jacket in between his bed sheets. He knows he took it, though he doesn’t remember doing it. He knows he should give it back, but he also knows he’s not going to, at least not yet.
Castiel goes easily when Dean pulls him in, letting himself be led, his head moving into the right position so when their lips meet again there's no teeth and no pain. His lips are soft and gentle, carefully easing Castiel into something more with his tongue, sliding a hand around the back of Castiel's neck to hold him there (not that Castiel would ever go anywhere). Castiel holds onto Dean by his sides, fitting his hands around the curves of his hips, feeling the way the muscles bunch and jump under his shirt.
He leans down and presses a wet, messy kiss to Castiel's mouth before he lifts his hips until only the head of Castiel's cock is still inside him, then thrusts his body back down again, grunting when it brushes up against his prostate. He does it again, then again, and again, settling his fingers over the middle of Castiel’s chest to feel the vibrations of his moans in his skin. Castiel lets Dean do all the work, and Dean has a comment on laziness on the tip of his tongue that he can't get out when he loses his breath every time he thrusts down onto Castiel's cock.
, has a
Dean feels a bit dizzy. He's had way too much information stuffed into his head in the last few months, and learning that the Four Horsemen and Death are real things make his head feel like it's full of cotton wool. He takes a seat at the kitchen table and braces his elbow on the surface, fitting his chin in his palm, sighing heavily. "My brain is fried, I need a drink." A bottle of whiskey appears in front of Dean, and he's not entirely sure who put it there, but he's grateful, and he thanks the room as he unscrews the lid. He takes a swig from the bottle and hands it over to Rowena when she takes a seat next to him. "So the spell, how do we do it?"
Dean pulls the Impala off to the side of the road and he and Castiel climb out, heading over to the bush. It’s perfectly maintained… everywhere but a small corner that’s been trampled. It could be a coincidence, just a trampled bush with absolutely no bearing on their investigation, but it’s the only lead they have.
"No, Cas."
"That wasn't a request for you to stop, Dean."
"I don't have it."
- and are back at his place in twenty minutes. He lets Deanna watch another episode while he feeds Mary, but she barely makes it past the first ten minutes before she's passed out with her head in his ribcage, under his arm. Mary isn't far behind her.
When Dean climbs back into the Impala he reaches for his phone and calls Benny. When the other man answers, Dean doesn't let him speak, instead, stuttering out, "He speaks eleven languages, Benny,
“Should we do a round of the nearest graveyards tonight?” Dean whispers over the third victim so the medical examiner and her assistant can’t hear them. The assistant had tried to flirt with Castiel when they’d arrived, which Dean thinks he could almost be jealous over if Castiel weren’t so unbelievably oblivious, and apparently stupidly in love with Dean, the absolute moron. Instead, he finds it hilarious. “Or go back to the motel for a few hours, fuck our brains out and
-*-*-
It's almost like a light turns on in Dean's mind and he says, "Hang on." Dean picks up the bottle of lube, pours some of the slick over his cock before finally climbing up the bed towards Castiel, settling beside him. He slides an arm underneath his back and uses the leverage to pull Castiel closer, slightly on his side, before hooking his arm under Castiel's knee to hold him open, sliding one of his legs between Castiel's. "Okay?"
"Dean, what happened?" Castiel asks very gently, voice barely above a whisper as he continues to rub at Dean's back as Dean tries to clean the evidence from the sink.
When Castiel doesn't say anything or move, his head tilted to the side while he tries to absorb all the information he's just received into his alcohol-soaked brain, Eileen waves her hand expectantly. "Oh! Now? Oh okay. Thank you."
Dean slides a third finger inside Castiel's body, stretching him out slowly and carefully, before he finally removes all of his fingers and says, "Okay, I think you're ready, but if it hurts, I can do a fourth finger." Castiel nods his agreement and lets his suddenly aching legs fall back to the bed while he watches Dean search through the drawer again. He comes back with a condom, tearing the packet open and sliding it over his cock with ease. He moves his phone back to the bedside table, looks back at Castiel and says, "Uh."
Castiel is even more confused now, and he screws up his mouth, blinking up at the man in front of him. "I do not understand."
, but Dean can't tell if he smells like
Jody and Donna begin a hushed conversation, words hurried, and, even to Dean's exceptional hearing, unintelligible. Dean glances over at Castiel, who looks like he's just been hit in the face, shocked and confused. He reaches over and squeezes Castiel's thigh, hoping to provide comfort. Castiel's rounded eyes fly to Dean's and Dean can hear Castiel’s heart hammering in his chest, and he doesn't think it's from the shock of learning he might just be able to get his memories back. Dean can't make himself look away until Donna speaks, and even then he doesn't move his hand.
“What kinda of things are you able to smell?” He asks her in sign, climbing into the bench opposite the machines when he’s done, feet dangling a foot above the floor. “Emotions?”
Lucifer's face twists in a frown and he rounds on Castiel. "What the fuck do you think you know about Kelly?"
Castiel's heart flutters in his chest and he mumbles his assent before reaching over to the bedside table to turn the light off with a click.
). When he steps out into the hallway he can just faintly hear Dean's music through the door across the hallway. It doesn't necessarily mean he's still awake, but Castiel decides to knock anyway.
Dean comes first, fucking his hips up into Castiel as he moans the man’s name. Castiel continues riding Dean, and reaches down to stroke his cock until he comes too, dick spurting on Dean’s belly before he collapses on top of Dean.
, they’re
“You’re only older mentally, the body you’re in is barely ten years old.”
"You can come in," He tells them, rolling his eyes as they hurriedly shuffle in, hovering around Jack and cooing at him. Some teenagers are just predictable; if babies are around, they lose their minds.
Castiel blinks his eyes open and looks over at Dean, raising an eyebrow.
"Gabriel!" Castiel shouts before Dean's even reached his brother. The archangel appears in the room in a crack of thunder. He's covered in blood, but none of it seems to be his, and his eyes shine as the silhouettes of his wings flare against the concrete walls. He's putting on a show, probably because he'd expected to be dropped in the middle of danger. "Heal him."
Dean goes back to his phone and types out,
Castiel comes back to Dean and leans down to press a gentle kiss to Dean’s hair. “We will, we will. We will need Gabriel’s help. Wait here, you’re still not fully healed.”
Dean growls at them, baring his teeth and readying himself to attack before the amused one holds his hands up in defence. "We just came to see Rowena."
well, but Castiel isn’t so sure anymore. The missing items don’t seem to link up with the normal MO of pixies - they tend to gravitate more towards stealing car keys, phones, wallets, gloves; inconveniences. While the loss of Castiel’s belongings are annoying, it’s not necessarily inconvenient.
Jo looks like she might cry, and she shoves Dean out of the way so she can lean over the table and pull Castiel into a hug. "
-*-*-*-*-*-
Even as he speaks, a rush of power flows into the room like a breeze, smelling of Rowena and the other witches. A hole opens up in the floor and when Dean looks down into it, all he can see is fire. The smoke fights, writhing and squirming, but it can't fight it, and it gets pulled down into the hole before it closes.
“Couple hours,” Castiel says with a yawn, voice muffled in Dean’s shoulder.
When Dean concentrates he can hear the thud of Castiel's heart in his chest. His eyes are so blue, blue like the ocean, like aster flowers, so blue Dean might drown in them. After a moment, Castiel nods and they step into the portal.
"What was that?" Dean asks incredulously, eyes as wide as saucers.
"There's another werewolf out there?" Dean asks, his heart caught in his throat. He's not alone, there's another out there like him.
"Tasha Banes."
"Nothing, Dean, go back to sleep."
Castiel pulls away first, hand pressed to Dean's chest (when the heck did that get there, and why does it make Dean feel like lightning?) and smiles up at him. "Tell Benny I said hi. Goodnight, Dean."
Dean's heart hammers in his chest, and he chuckles, pressing his face into Castiel's shoulder. "Let's work up to it, okay, Cas? Why don't we... I dunno..." Dean looks down the line of Castiel's body, and this time, he lets himself look. Castiel's dick isn't fully hard, but Dean doesn't think it will take him very long to get there. He's thicker than Dean and slightly longer, and despite knowing very little about other men's penises, Dean decides it's a very
Castiel tilts his head and looks over at Dean, another small smile curling at his lips. "That sounds nice, Dean, really."
“What’s going on?” Castiel whispers from behind Dean.
Jo sidles up to the table and while Dean hadn't been expecting to see her, at least not until Christmas, he manages, without stumbling, "Hey asshole, haven't seen you in weeks, sorta hoping you'd gone and died on me."
Dean is either going to burst into flames, or murder the both of them.
"No… well, yes. How did you know it was me?" Castiel asks, taking a seat on the edge of Dean's mattress, picking up the candy wrapper he finds hidden in the sheets. He rolls his eyes and stands up to put it in the trash can.
"I'll watch over you," Castiel says with a nod, pulling the quilt from the bottom of the bed over the both of them. Before Dean's eyes close he watches Castiel climb to his feet and circle the bed to the side he's claimed as his own, sitting down against the headboard.
. Oh and remind me to clean every available surface when we get home. I know what
“Dean will figure out something’s happening if we leave again so soon. He might force you to talk before you’re ready,” Eileen signs as Sam and Dean talk animatedly in front of them, the four of them entering the kitchen together.
"Me, neither." Castiel agrees, hugging her tightly. "Are you alright?"
Dean falls to a sit on the ground, taking Castiel with him, and turns around so his back is now against the tree. He gets his hand around Castiel's cheek and kisses him gently. "We're going to be like this for a bit."
Castiel nods his head, then says, "Can we have sex?"
Dean rolls his eyes and replies, "Fuck off. What's the plan, now, smartass?"
Dean stays with his head against Castiel's shoulder, drinking his coffee, and Castiel is really enjoying the contact, don't get him wrong, but he also really needs to know why Dean is doing it in the first place. "Dean?" Dean only mumbles in reply, but it sounds like an acquiescence, so Castiel continues. "You engage in frequent physical contact with me, is this normal for humans? Or perhaps normal for you?"
“Kiss me again.”
"I…" Castiel says, tilting his head to the side, eyebrows stitched together into a frown. "I wouldn't have been opposed."
Sam tries to hand her back, cause he's a shit, but Dean ducks out of the way, diving towards the fridge and pulling it open, reaching in for a beer. Sam disappears through the door leading into the back hallway and Castiel and Benny appear from the front hallway, and Dean takes out another two beers.
"I'll bet," Dean replies. The baby's power feels stronger when he touches her, like it's reaching out to Dean to investigate him, to learn if he's safe. "Have you chosen a name?"
The vibrations of the cock in Dean’s ass are starting to get too much and he says to Castiel, who’s still shaking through his orgasm, “Ah fuck, get it out before I die!”
Castiel nods, licking grease from his fingers. “I’ve never thought about it, but I suppose you’re right.”
“Yes, daddy.” Dean says, rubbing the lube across his fingers as he shifts his legs to open himself up. He reaches his hand down and slides his finger over his hole, slicking the skin, before fitting it inside his body. He makes a choked off sound in the back of his throat at the feeling.
Dean and Castiel leave them to it, finding the bedroom with their things sitting on the bed. Dean tells Castiel to sit down and is about to go find a cloth to clean the angel's wound, only to be stopped by a bright, shining light emanating from the cut. When it clears, the cut is healed. "Why didn't you just do that earlier?"
"Dean, I was an Angel of the Lord. I Fell forty years ago. If angels are in a human vessel when they Fall the vessel becomes their human form, but if they're in their original angelic form... It just so happened that the only pregnant woman in the immediate area was a shapeshifter, though I think it was fate playing a joke on me. I was the angel that assisted God in sending ravens to the prophet Elijah, when he was a fugitive in Jordan."
Dean's glad Benny's off the phone, because he can't quieten the laughter that bursts from him at Castiel's text.
Castiel pouts out his bottom lip and Dean tries to ignore the urge to melt. "Very well.  I am extremely tired, I think I might go to bed."
Benny's laughter is sharp, and it's doing awesome things to the warmth brewing in Dean's gut. Jesus Christ. "I swear to God, both of you need to stop right now."
“Does a mate not need a secondary sex? I don’t have one.”
As he drives, he decides to bring up the possibility of using an archangel summoning ritual with Castiel later when Emma isn't around. If it doesn't work, no harm done, but he reckons they should give it a try nonetheless. God, Dean doesn't even know if, well,
Dean's brows knit together and he mouths
She looks the same as the last time he saw her. She’s sixteen here, too, which makes no sense when she was sixteen three years ago.
It's something that's been going on for a while, even longer than Castiel can truly remember, but something that he's only just beginning to notice. He'd been far too busy in the last decade, but now, with Chuck and his Grace gone - for good this time - he's had the occasion to examine the exchanges the two of them have shared in the ten years they've known each other.
Everything goes downhill very fast after that, with guns suddenly raised, pointed at everyone.
"I still don't always understand sarcasm, Dean."
Dean lets out a startled laugh. you too? i thought everyone was on the henry cavill train and it was just me thirsting after jaskier
-*-*-
Castiel nods his head. “Do you still want to search tonight?”
Benny gives him the finger. "What do you want?"
Dinner is far louder and more raucous than any dinner they've had since the week following Chuck's defeat. Dean spends most of the night with his hand on Castiel's knee, and Castiel spends most of the night wondering if Dean would taste like pasta and beer or something else if Castiel kissed him.
"Well, it worked," Dean says, smiling gently at Castiel, who's still too blown to do anything more than frown down at himself. He looks like he's not entirely sure this is happening, and if he were to blink he'd find himself a raven again. "Do you remember anything?"
"He likes you too much to fire you," Castiel says, a cheeky smile on his face. The implication is clear, and Dean tries really hard not to react, because he's sure he'll say something stupid about Benny's dick, and children really shouldn't be hearing those things. He is thinking about Benny's dick though, and then he's thinking about Castiel's dick, and he gets a bit distracted until Castiel pokes him in the hip. "We haven't ordered yet."
"Seriously? You're pregnant?" Jack asks, bouncing up and down in his seat with a broad smile on his face. Castiel doesn't understand why he seems to be so excited, but given how depressed he'd been as his powers were failing, Castiel doesn't care why he's happy, as long as he stays that way.
He had, but he's really trying to be a respectable adult who doesn't get random hard ons, so he's tried very hard not to think about it. Now though, he remembers the video of Benny with three fingers in his ass and Castiel's responding picture, his belly covered with come. He hadn't seen it the night before, he'd been completely passed out, but he'd seen it in the morning and had jerked off to it
Sam calls it quits early,  followed by Jody and Donna, then Alex, and then the others until it's just Patience, Castiel and Dean left, polishing off the last bottle of whiskey. Patience has been suspiciously quiet, and once they're alone, Dean takes the chance to ask her why.
"He's rather enamoured with your brother. It's extremely annoying."
Dean rolls over and presses his face into the pillow, groaning.  "I dunno, man. Zachariah put me in that haunted building without my memories to teach me that hunting's in my blood. You sent me back in time to show me how Sam got addicted to demon blood. Gabriel tried to convince Sam and me to agree to be Lucifer and Michael's vessels." Dean yawns into the pillow loudly. "Whatever it is, we'll find out when they pull us out."
Dean rolls his eyes dramatically. “Stop thinking.”
"Take him to Rowena," Dean tells Gabriel who nods, ignoring Sam's protests. "Stay there with them, keep an eye on Dagon." Gabriel nods again before taking Sam's arm and disappearing.
The shine in Gabriel's eyes eases and he drops to his knee beside Sam, resting two fingers on the werewolf's forehead. White light gleams in Sam's wound before the skin begins stitching itself back together.
“Good boy,” Castiel tells him, leaning down again to bite the opposite ass cheek. Dean shudders and muffled a moan in his pillow. Castiel spanks him a few more times before completely removing Dean’s briefs, throwing them across the room. “How are your hands? Okay?”
He has a list Eileen's written him, with each item categorized by aisle so he doesn't have to go back and forth, and he's almost finished when he gets a text from Dean asking him to wrap it up and head home. He uses the word
Benny, the bastard, sends Dean a picture of his crotch, hard dick tenting his jeans. There's just a sliver of his belly in the picture, the curl of hair on his belly that trails down into his jeans and circles his cock, and Dean's gut grows warm.
Dean can't think of anyone local who's died recently off the top of his head, except he doesn't think he's seen Castiel's crazy bitch mom, either, and he doesn't think Castiel would come back here for anything less. He makes sure Benny's not watching him and texts Rufus, though he's not one hundred percent sure the man'll answer. He rarely does.
"Two weeks ago, why?" Rufus looks up at him and pulls his bloody glove covered hand from the body. Dean makes a face. "You bein' nosy again, boy?"
Castiel looks resigned and Dean chuckles at the two of them. "So glad I didn't have kids, means I get to be the cool uncle who lets them do the things their parents wouldn't normally let them do and I can hand them back when I'm done." Castiel laughs at Dean, and Benny rolls his eyes. Jack's eyes are sparkling, like he already has something planned.
"I would like for you to kiss me again." Castiel repeats.
"It's always been my name. The people who raised me told me it was." He looks unsure, like a small child who's been told off but can't understand what for. "My mom, well the woman I called mom, she took me after our pack was killed." Dean goes to say something, but Rowena hits him again. "I don't understand."
“I’m sorry, Cas, I don’t know. He’s better at hiding his feelings than you are. You can thank our dad for that.”
They go hunting for the pixies, checking every nook and cranny the bunker has, but come up empty-handed. Sam and Eileen are still fairly certain it’s pixies, pixies whose nests are just hidden
He hears shuffling outside the tent, footsteps on dry, crackling leaves, twigs snapping. He goes on the offensive, gun raised, safety off, with his finger on the trigger, watching as someone (or something) pulls the zipper of the tent’s door down.
Dean sucks in a breath. Tasha had convinced him it was trauma, had she taken his memories of that night? Was Dean really the kid Bobby saved? "The witch, what was her name?"
Castiel's heart is hammering in his chest and he's trying to decide what to say next when Dean speaks again.
Dean's heart suddenly aches with the memory of running with Castiel as the raven, wishing that he could still shift. Wishing he was still human, still
He finds his axe and the large sack he uses to carry wood around, and when he heads out of the cave, the raven follows, hopping on the floor until he has enough headroom to spread his wings and lift into the air.
Eileen shakes her head no. “Dean is unmated and only recently off his own heat. His body also identifies you as a potential mate, it just isn’t a good idea.”
, Dean thinks to himself as he's helping Kelly out of her pants,
When Dean looks back at Castiel his eyes are wide with wonder. Dean's not sure if it's the birth or the power that rolls through the room like the lick of flames that has brought on that look of wonder on his face.
Dean's) and a pair of sweatpants he
He panics, automatically reaching for the gun he always keeps under his pillow. There’s a gun there, certainly, but it’s not
Dean grins broadly and fights the urge to kiss Castiel, brushing his fingers over Castiel's wrist before watching him leave. He goes back inside and starts on dinner.
"Move in, here, both of you." Dean blurts.
. He watches Dean reaching into the fridge for enough bottles of beer for all of them. “I’ll figure it out, don’t worry.”
"Profound bond, huh?" Dean lets his arms drop to his sides and lets out a short amused breath, falling onto the bed next to Castiel. He rests his elbows on his knees and props his chin up with his hands, staring at the door across the room from where they sit. "Someone broke the archangel and demon proofing, Cas. Someone inside the house. Someone with enough knowledge to know how to. The only two in the house who knew how to break the archangel warding were you and Gabriel, and I know it wasn't you."
Dean's not sure what he's expecting when they reach the building, but it's certainly not the Claire that greets them. He's never seen her so... well,
Dean’s eyebrow raises towards his hairline. He moves his hand away from Castiel’s throat, which he would whine about - really - if it hadn’t gone straight into his hair, pulling his head back roughly so Dean’s mouth can latch onto his skin.
“Awesome, there you go!” Dean says with a grin, slapping his hand over Castiel’s shoulder. “Ready to go again?”
Christ, Benny," Dean groans, his cock throbbing against his belly. He uses the hand around Benny's neck to shove the other man's face further into his throat, pulling at the short hairs on his head as much as he can until Benny groans. The vibrations of it send a wave of heat through his body and he clenches around Benny, which only makes him groan again, and endless cycle of bite and touch and groan and fuck. "Oh fuck."
Dean snorts, flipping a finished pancake onto the plate he set out for them, putting it in the oven, with the heat on low so it'll stay warm. "Sounds about right."
"Saganaki," Dean supplies. "Fried cheese, usually haloumi. Try some with the hummus and pita bread."
," Castiel whispers, reaching down to thread his fingers in Dean's hair again, pulling until Dean's scalp aches and he goes, letting Castiel pull him up his body. They kiss again, Castiel leading this time, and Dean moans into it.
Dean smiles brightly and says, “Purely selfish. If I hadn’t healed you, I wouldn’t be able to do this.”
Dean's) and a pair of sweatpants he
Dean finds it hard reconciling the small, pathetic-looking dark-haired man in a witch’s trap and covered in blood with everything that Dean's heard of regarding Fergus "Crowley" MacLeod. Crowley's reputation had always been one of violence, irritability and biting sarcasm, an utter contradiction to the man held in the Men of Letters dungeon.
Dean feels a bit like his heart is in his throat, and his voice feels rough to his ears when he says, "Eleven?"
One of them, a woman, tells Castiel rudely, "Your brother and your sister-in-law are dead. Your niece is alive. We will take you to see her, but then you have to leave."
He climbs out of the mass grave and hands the pouch back to Castiel, watching as he puts it into the back, then snaps his fingers, replacing the earth over the skeletons as if it had never been moved in the first place.
Dean's eyes flick up to Castiel, and he suddenly wants to tell the angel exactly what's been going on in his head, but the thought of doing so makes something ugly and sharp curl in his gut. He doesn't want to be so open with anyone, even if he desperately wants Castiel to know that he wants him to stay. Dean Winchester, king of emotional constipation. "Yeah, I guess."
"A bit of stalling, that's really all I can think of."
He can't be alive.
Castiel shrugs his shoulders again and then says after a pause, “Do you think Sam and Rowena are enjoying their time alone?”
When Rowena returns during late afternoon Dean shifts to talk to her, ask her what the plan is and if she spoke to
Castiel knows, but he’s still afraid.
-*-*-
Rowena complains - informing him that she only filled her nails yesterday, and if she breaks them, he'll be paying for their replacement - but she still helps carry the bags into the kitchen. Dean is waiting for them, coffee in his hand, and he helps put the food away without having to be asked. Bumping his shoulders and hips into Castiel's every time they pass.
Dean's cheeks flush pink and he tries to hide a smile with his coffee cup as he makes his way to the kitchen table, but Castiel sees it anyway. It makes his chest feel warm and tight. When Sam and Eileen enter the kitchen, flushed and slightly disheveled, Castiel is sitting at the table next to Dean with toast (one piece with peanut butter and another with jelly, smushed into a sandwich - Eileen's idea) and Dean's hand is rested on his thigh. Dean doesn't move it, but the room's new occupants don't notice.
Three of their attackers whisper harshly to one another. Dean hears Claire and Amelia's names, but not much else.
, he’d be more than happy to do it like this for the rest of their lives.
Dean chuckles. "I know baby, that's why I pointed it out." He turns to Castiel then and asks, "You okay?"
"Stop, stop! He's Jimmy's brother!" Emma cries, very obviously afraid. At least Dean's theory was right.
Michael makes a face at Castiel and says, "It's not magic." He releases Crowley from the chair and reaches towards him, disappearing with the witch's limp body in a flash of light.
Jo leans over the table and grins, "Aces, where to, il capitano?"
"That's a… that's a thing? It actually feels good when you touch it? Like a girl's g-spot?"
Dean never misses, and today is no different. His teeth sink into the hare's scruff, breaking its neck, and he waves it for the raven, showing off. The raven trills, swooping down with its wings outspread to peck at Dean playfully. He butts his muzzle into the tiny feathery body.
Dean teaches Jack how to sign
"Can we go?"
"You and my brother," Sam says, prompting Castiel to speak, but Castiel doesn't know what Sam wants him to say. At Castiel's continued confusion, Sam rolls his eyes and goes on, "You've been touching each other a lot, y'know. Like, you touched each other a lot before, but it's been worse."
"No, Cas. I don't want to stop. At all." Dean takes his pants off and reaches for the box of condoms. "Do you? Want to stop?"
Castiel's face turns thoughtful. "I don't remember any of that."
Dean gives Castiel a toothy grin and does as he's told, shoving the pillow away as he lies down where Castiel had been, sliding his arms under his head.
"Imagine that," Dean says almost breathlessly, closing the book again and staring at it for a moment before he hands it back to Rowena. "I still don't trust them."
Occasionally, when he needs something Castiel has cut up, he'll lean over where Castiel sits, hand on Castiel's shoulder to steady himself, hair brushing against Castiel's cheek. It's the only time Sam will look up from his book, to shoot them a confused frown, before he shakes his head and continues reading. Castiel is still confused, more so than he was by Dean's increased contact, but he hasn't bothered to ask what Sam had meant.
Dean knows how long it took him to move into his parents house after his dad died, and he has to stop himself from saying something stupid like offering the two spare bedrooms he has to Cas and his kids. Instead he says something equally stupid, "Do you want to get dinner later?"
,” Dean whispers, almost in awe. He doesn’t get to be inside Castiel very often (and with Castiel on top of him even less), and it feels almost like a religious experience every time it does happen.
Dean’s second indication is the smell of dirt, rain and pine needles. Like a
He gets nervous again when he realizes that now Castiel's stretched he has to... well get to it. Get in him.
Castiel jerks up in bed, blinking blearily at Dean before realization dawns on him. He’s out of the bed faster than Dean was, and far more alert than Dean is still capable of.
They reach Rowena's cabin in minutes, and unsurprisingly it remains empty, with no smoke billowing from the chimney. Castiel lands in the snow in front of Dean and hangs his head, no doubt discouraged. Dean bumps his muzzle into the raven's body again.
When Castiel has placed the rope back in the case he climbs onto the bed and straddles Dean’s thighs. He pulls Dean’s face up by the chin and kisses him hard, licking his way into Dean’s mouth. His fingers are rough in Dean’s skin and a shiver slides down Dean’s spine, prickling at his skin. Castiel’s teeth dig into Dean’s bottom lip and Dean moans, fingers flexing where they lie by his sides. He wants to touch Castiel, but he hasn’t been given permission yet.
Dean doesn't speak as he begins to move his hand, too engrossed in his task, trying his best to learn Castiel's dick and how to work his body, and Castiel can't take his eyes off of him. He pokes his tongue out the corner of his mouth at one point, which would have set off Castiel's laughing again if Dean hadn't chosen that exact moment to swipe the pad of his thumb over the head of his dick.
"Think Nurse Ratched, but entirely more insane," Rowena answers, pursing her lips. "Go wake the others."
“Say it.”
Her grin turns sharp, almost predatory, infinitely hubristic. "I've been here, talking to
Jack returns to heaven without any prompting, claiming a section of heaven needs immediate attention. Garth finds Dean and Castiel a shapeshifter case in Missouri with three already dead. Sam seems suspicious - Dean hasn’t hunted in months - but he doesn’t say anything, so he either figures it out or doesn’t care enough to ask, too glad to have time alone with Rowena.
"This smells amazing," Castiel says, staring down at the food on his plate before handing the spoon over to Dean who scoops out his own serve. It does smell amazing, and Dean's stomach grumbles. He takes a piece of garlic bread and says, "Okay, now
Dean and Castiel order a pizza to the hotel room and take a case of beer from the back of the Impala, sacking out on the bed in front of the TV. They argue good-naturedly over which channel to watch, fighting over the remote, and Dean wins, because he manages to wrestle Castiel onto his front, pinning Castiel’s arms to his sides with his knees, straddling his back.
Castiel turns towards Dean, face sad, and reaches over to take Dean's hand in his, "The mothers of archangel Nephilims don't survive, Dean. Kelly knows that."
Charlie gives him a blank look. "You mean Castiel Novak?"
Castiel stops, mouth pressed to Dean's skin, but it doesn't take him long to understand, and he smiles widely. "I
"Is that…" Dean says, staring down at the concrete where Lucifer's Grace was sucked into hell. "Was that it? Is it over?"
Castiel nods and thanks him, before Dean makes his way back to the garage. Bobby is waiting in the office for him.
Dean must get sick of it quickly because he gets this determined look on his face before reaching up to take Castiel's cock in his hand and squeezing it gently so Castiel's laughter is abruptly cut off with a low groan. His mouth turns up into a smug smile and all Castiel can think about (besides the hand on his dick) is how green his eyes are, and how the warm light of the bedside table lamp makes his freckles more pronounced and striking.
Dean can't decide if he wants to kill the bastard or just hurt him
Dean nods and answers the phone with a “Agent Stark speaking.”
"Some ground rules," He starts, pointing at the women. "Claire has been given permission to shoot you if you piss anyone off, or say anything to anyone she deems rude. They won't be witch bullets so they won't kill you, but they'll hurt like a bitch, so don't try it. If you leave Rowena high and dry during any part of this, I'll find you and I'll eat you - you've agreed and you're here, so stay here. You'll need to keep your strengths up while you're working - you absolutely cannot fuck up - so eat whatever you want in the fridge. Except the pie. If I come back and someone's eaten my pie, I'm gonna eat them. Lastly," Dean says, smiling in a way that shows the sharp point of his canines. "If I find any of you have been working with Lucifer, his witch, or
His first guess is a djinn, but he’s not sure how this is supposed to be a good dream. He has no idea where he is, and he has no idea who he’s with. Besides, he was locked up tight in the bunker when he went to bed.
. And it's
Castiel makes a face at him, but takes his things, and then Dean's hand, following him out of the restaurant. It's almost eleven, and as much as Dean would kill to stay longer, be with Castiel longer, he has to be at the garage to open at five, and he doesn't think he's going to make it
Dean has placed his hand on Castiel's elbow to lead him through the doors into a Wisconsin diner, after Sam and Eileen. Castiel lets him but also turns to shoot him a curious look and tells him, "I can find the way myself, Dean. Not that I don't appreciate the contact, as always."
Castiel thinks about it for a moment, chewing on his bottom lip before he finally nods. Sam climbs to his feet and pats Castiel’s shoulder on the way out of the room. Castiel stays where he is for awhile, staring at the wall for a moment, thinking about the freckles on Dean’s cheeks before he stands and leaves.
, listening to a song on the record player that Castiel's pretty sure he recognises but can't name. He puts the book, open and face-down, on the bedside table and when he looks up at Castiel his eyes catch on his torso and his cheeks tinge red. "Is that my henley?"
-*-*-*-*-*-
“Cas, you’re terrifying then. The girl is five, just put the gun down,” Dean says, reaching forward and pushing the gun down. Castiel lets him, switching the safety back on. “You’ve got great timing baby, really, but I’ve got this one.”
Dean laughs and leans over to set his plate on the coffee table so that he can reply.
Dean nods. “I know. I can smell it.”
"Feeling better?" Castiel asks in a whisper after what feels like hours. Dean nods his head, though he doesn't open his eyes. "Good."
"You're probably bored of Lafitte's, huh? There's a place that does pizza and pasta in the next town over, that sound okay? And I'll pick you up at the B'n'B at six-thirty."
-*-*-*-*-*-
"Thanks."
That catches Dean's attention and he says, "Continental? Ugly gold color?"
-*-*-
"Bye, Cas."
They end up fucking in the back seat, with Dean in Benny's lap, his back against Benny's chest, head twisted uncomfortably so he can kiss him.
He checks Dean’s bedside drawers first, opening each briefly so he can see inside without breaching Dean’s privacy more than necessary. He checks under Dean’s bed, in the bureau, in the book cases, through the headboard’s shelves before finally moving over to Dean’s closet.
"Gods, fuck," Castiel groans when Dean brushes his nose in the crook between Castiel's thigh and groin. He wants to take his time, make Castiel desperate, but Castiel’salready impatient, and he tugs at Dean's hair as a warning.
Castiel looks unbelievably confused, brow furrowed, but still takes it in stride, nodding his head slowly. Jo disappears again and Castiel turns to Dean with wide eyes. "She's changed a lot."
. He does love Mary, on the other hand, and manages to steal her away for most of the night, playing with her while he eats. Castiel has a soft look on his face and Dean's chest is tight with fondness.
"Why Toledo?" Sam asks as they surround Bobby, staring down at the laptop. "And why wouldn't he just take Jack down to hell."
"Yes," Charlie confirms, nodding her head. She's concentrating on the saucepan in front of her, the milk inside just beginning to bubble, and Dean's about to leave so he doesn't interrupt her when she says, "He was Naomi Oksana's kid."
He thinks he's a bit curt with her, but he doesn't care, except Benny and Castiel are looking at him like he just bit her head off. "What?" He asks when she's gone.
Castiel rolls his hips and squeezes his body around Dean’s cock. Dean frowns, deep in his throat, hips jutting up at the sensation of
Dean's started to get dizzy with all the blood loss and when his body wobbles he lets himself collapse to the floor, unable to hold himself up any longer. He watches Bevell stalk towards him, suddenly unable to move or protect himself.
Dean can't do more than hold on as Benny fucks him (not that he minds), watching between them as Benny's cock slips in and out of his hole. His body feels like it's on fire and his dick is begging for attention, but he wants to wait until he's so close he can't hold on any longer before he reaches down to touch himself. Benny fits his face into Dean's throat and bites him again, this time in the junction between Dean's neck and shoulder, because he's a fucking vampire and he knows Dean fucking loves it.
"Who?"
Castiel's head swivels towards Dean and his eyes light up. "Really?"
Oh wow. A racist, too. Dean wonders if he can go for the trifecta. "Get out, or I'll make it hurt. Neither of us want that, and my boyfriend really doesn't like it when I get blood on the carpet."
They dress in near silence (when they speak, it's because Dean threw Benny's shirt into an unknown corner of the room and Benny can't find it), and when they're done, Dean kisses Benny again and thanks him before making his way out of the room. He washes his hands in the bathroom before heading out to the bar, greeting Charlie with a cheery salute.
"None taken," Castiel replies honestly, nodding his head. He's pretty much in agreement. This is quite possibly the stupidest thing he's ever done. "Is this the secret you guys have been keeping from me? Did you all know?"
Castiel lets out a fast gush of air from his nose. "Sam would often murmur to himself that you and I needed to 'get a room'. I wasn't entirely sure what it meant, but he would also threaten to lock us in a room." Castiel frowns in concentration as he realises there's a cut on Dean's shoulder, long and thin, probably (hopefully) from swinging the machete. "I think it involves sexual intercourse. Many things involve sexual intercourse on earth."
"We are not creepy."
, and hot; like his blood is burning in his veins.
Dean nods, and watches as Benny calls over a waiter to pay for their dinner. It's their first waitress, and she waits until Benny's handed her the cash before she mutters something as she's leaving. He can't hear it, but he doesn't like it, and he climbs to his feet - probably about to do something stupid like get into a fight with a waitress in the middle of a busy restaurant - but Benny and Castiel both pulling him back down.
No angel has enough juice after the fall to pop him into… wherever this is. The archangel Gabriel is dead…
"I didn't believe Castiel when he accused you both, but here you are," Dean says, scowling them both down. He hears the flutter of wings before Castiel's next to him, arms crossed over his chest. "I am going to kill you both."
It drops when his hold on its neck tightens, crushing bones between his jaws and breaking its neck. When he's sure it's over, a rustle of wings lets him know his new companion has joined him.
Benny and Castiel get down to their briefs, their clothes scattered around the room, and Dean takes the opportunity to wriggle his fingers down and inside to take them both in his hands. They gasp into each other's mouths and he feels them both harden further in his hands. Their mouths part, and Benny catches Dean's in a kiss while Castiel kisses down his throat. They're thrusting their cocks into his fists - Castiel slowly and Benny forcefully - and he squeezes so they both groan.
Dean braces his hands on Castiel's shoulders as a shiver runs down his spine, letting his eyes flutter closed before he grinds forward in Castiel's lap. Castiel lets him start at his own pace, holding Dean around the middle as Dean bucks his hips, fingers pressing into Dean's flesh until it feels like it might bruise. Dean feels so damn
When Dean opens his eyes on a blink they're in a large field filled with bright yellow sunflowers that have grown close to Dean's height, stretching up towards the sun. He reaches up to brush his fingers against one of them. He'd never admit it to anyone, but sunflowers are his favourite.
“Possibly because there’s only one?” Dean replies, squatting down next to the body to examine it. There are small straight nicks in the muscle that look like they may have been caused by a knife.
Castiel's long list of strengths does not include subtlety, whatsoever, so once he's completed his brief observation of the interactions between the others around him, when Dean next touches Castiel in a way the others don't, he mentions it.
Eileen nods, "Yes, it's annoying when he mopes."
Dean gives her a strong scowl before climbing to his feet and finding the hotel phone, picking up the receiver and dialing the number for reception he finds on the pamphlet sitting next to the phone. It's late, he hadn't realised, and the kitchen, while not closed, is only serving a limited menu, and with an after-hours fee. If he's gonna deal with this crap he needs to eat, and he needs alcohol. If Rowena has to pay for it, all the better. Once he's listed off what he wants he sends a questioning raised eyebrow at Castiel, who shakes his head in response. He knows Castiel hasn't eaten in almost a day, so he orders him a burger like he's ordered himself.
"And now we wait," Rowena says, wiping the dirt from her hands and dress.
They manage to make it all the way through preening (which Jack tries very hard to help with, but mostly ends up sitting in Dean’s lap for, while
"Yeah, he's in Mongolia. Sam something, a gun?"
There are at least fifteen keys on the chain and Dean has to try seven of them on the door into the dungeon until he gets it right. The walls are lined with tiny barred cells, at least twenty of them, and they're all full. The room smells of fear and various supernatural creatures, as well as one human, a red-headed girl right at the end, in the very last cage on the right.
Dean topples onto the couch behind them with a grunt and Castiel sinks down next to him, looking dumbfounded. Dean links his fingers over his head and stares up at the ceiling, studying the patterns of the tiles.
An aggressive bite over an already tender bruise is joined by a particular vicious thrust of Dean’s hips, and Castiel’s pretty sure he loses all brain function. He flings his head back to open his throat to more of Dean’s mouth and is rewarded with another bite, this one just above his collarbone.
“Just kill him, before he kills us,” the middle one says in a harsh whisper, holding onto the eldest’s arm tightly with two hands. The youngest is hiding behind the two of them, holding tightly to her dinosaur. She looks like she’s been crying, eyes red and cheeks blotchy, and Dean’s heart actually clenches at the thought of scaring a five-year-old so much she’s been crying. Shit, what are they doing alone? Even ghouls have parents, where are theirs?
"Don't look so smug," Castiel tells him, straddling Dean's hips and reaching back to take Dean's cock in his hand. He screws up his face in concentration as he slides down onto Dean and groans deep in his throat.
Dean looks back at her. "Okay?"
“Oh, that mouth,” Dean says with a grin, sliding his hands up Castiel’s thighs and settling them on Castiel’s hips. “That’s fair. Though it wasn’t always against the wall.”
Dean frowns and holds his hand up to stop her from continuing. "Wait, you can't be saying it was Zeus because that would be fucking insane."
A growl rumbles from deep in Dean's chest and he tightens his fingers around Castiel's thighs until he's sure they'll bruise, fucking his cock up into Castiel's slick, pliant body. His thrusts are hurried and rough, but Castiel doesn't seem to mind at all. Every time Dean's cock enters Castiel fully and knocks against his prostate the angel lets out a choked keen. Dean gets his mouth on Castiel's nipple, flicking his tongue and grazing his teeth over the hardened nub, and Castiel whimpers, digging his nails into Dean's shoulders. The sharp ache of it sends pleasure shooting through his veins like lightning, settling into his gut.
Dean chuckles and nods his head, placing a hand on Castiel’s back before pushing the both of them back into the blankets. He folds Castiel’s legs out to the side and reaches down to press his dick back into Castiel’s body. He unhooks Castiel’s arms from around his neck and slips his fingers between Castiel’s, pressing his hands into the pillows above his head.
"Why would she lie?"
One of Charlie's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shoots up towards her hairline. "You in a mood, huh, honey?" Kaia, who must have overheard what Dean was looking for, leans over Charlie to put the plate on the window counter.
Dean takes a deep, shaky breath and nods his head again. “Yeah, I know, of course I know. I’ve known for ages. Even before you said you loved me when the Empty took you.”
Patience nods, humming. "Once. A wolf. Once he got his memories back we learnt that Crowley had done it to keep him from being recognised as a were when he turned with the full moon." She frowns and picks up her wine glass, staring into it consideringly. "He said he thought he was the last werewolf. Guess not."
It looks like any other hipster cafe Dean has ever been to (which is not that many, thankfully), with all the wood and dark colors and shelves of books off to the side. It’s pretty crowded - it is lunchtime after all - and Dean has to zig-zag through the tables to get to the line at the front counter.
"No you don't, you can take a night off, you and I are going to fucking Chillo's, okay?"
"Stop her!"
"First of all," Dean says, "Dinosaurs, I love it. Second of all, sorry about the divorce. Third of all, you have kids?"
They visit the roadhouse a few more times, and Castiel gets the feeling that it's to give Sam and Eileen time to themselves. On one of the nights they spend at the bar, after playing pool and drinking beer for a few hours, as they're leaving the building, Castiel slides his hand into Dean's, like he's seen Eileen and Sam do. Dean doesn't pull away, instead squeezing Castiel's hand and bringing it up to press it against his chest so he can pat it with his free hand.
Dean goes to tell Castiel how much he'd like that, but he's asleep before he can.
She nods again. "So, exactly how does this work?"
Dean reaches down and fingers Castiel's t-shirt, looking up at him through the fan of his eyelashes. Castiel thinks Dean's asking for permission to remove his clothing and through flaming cheeks and a heat deep in his belly he nods.
Dean sighs and drops back against the pillow. "If someone really wanted to fuck us over, they could come up with something so much better than... Apocalypse World. Someone's either playing a joke on us, or they want us to learn some sort of lesson." He closes his eyes, intent on going back to sleep.
Dean really doesn't know what to say to that, so instead, he says, "You staying in town for long?"
Another shot goes off and pain shoots through his shoulder, and his legs give way as he collapses into the snow.
"Okay, good." Dean wants to ask, but he decides it can wait for now. "Anyway, full disclosure, I was explaining to Benny that I would like if we could explore triad dynamics, but I don't want to do it if it'll make either of you uncomfortable. If all you want is to keep it just you and me, then that's what we'll do."
tee that Sam got him one year for Pride. She really was a horrible bitch.
-*-*-
"Okay," he can do a brief introduction, without the specifics, that's easy. "So, I'm going to use you as an example; no one person can satisfy every emotional, physical and sexual need that you have, that's why you have friends and family. Some people have more romantic and sexual needs then others, which is where polycules come in. There are hundreds, thousands of different kinds, you can't do a polycule wrong. Some people have say… three partners, who also have other partners, and some of those have relationships with more people, it's kind of like a molecule, a web. Other polycules are like us, three or more people who are in one big relationship rather than two or three relationships. Does that make any sense?"
, and Claire beats them all in
-*-*-
He finds Castiel on the bed, completely naked with his arms behind his head, thick biceps stretched enticingly. Dean thinks very seriously about biting marks into those biceps and then throwing out the plan and making Castiel hold him down.
Almost as if Rowena can understand Castiel, she says, "Yes, just let me nap first, I'm going to need a lot of energy."
"I'm Dean, I'm going to keep you and your child safe." He turns to look at Sam, Castiel and Rowena and introduces them, too. Once he's done, he turns to Lucifer and Dagon and says, "The demon can stay, but if she tries anything, puts any of my people in danger, I will kill her."
Castiel jerks Dean with a renewed fervour, hand tight and fast as Dean grinds down onto him. Dean comes first, chin tucked over Castiel's shoulder, groaning Castiel's name into the angel's ear. Castiel comes when Dean gets his hand in Castiel's pants to stroke his cock.
Dean's chest constricts. He doesn't remember the last time anyone told him they loved him, nor the last time he let anyone
Sam reappears eventually, holding his phone out to Dean. Dean takes it and presses it to his ear. "Mia?"
"Benny, you motherfucker!" He can hear Benny laughing, and he might actually hate him. "Sorry, Cas. Another?"
"I dunno, dicks don't normally look like this, right? Like you'd see on a model or something? I don't know what I'm saying, Cas, just ignore me." Castiel really does try hard not to laugh at him, but Dean is just so flustered and nervous and it's just so sweet but also completely fucking hilarious. "Cas,
"How many have there been? Archangel Nephilim?"
Castiel hasn't noticed his reaction, and he just nods in reply. "When I was doing digs during university, and afterwards when I worked in the field, I had to learn the language quickly, or I would never know what was going on. So English - obviously - Russian, Czech, Serbian, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, Bengali and Hindi. Most of those languages I admit to knowing very little more than '
Castiel laughs around a forkful of cheese and broccoli. "Less than ten minutes is still pretty impressive," he says after he's chewed and swallowed the food. "Have you got any more?"
Dean thinks he knows where Castiel's going with this, but he's not entirely sure he wants to hear it.
Castiel’s cheeks tinge pink and he shoots Dean a warning look that sends a shiver down Dean’s spine. “Focus on the case, Dean.”
Castiel frowns like he knows something is going unsaid, then pulls his hand away from Jack's head, laying it in his lap with the other. His lips twist thoughtfully and he squints at Dean like he's trying to figure the wolf out. "Why aren't you wearing a shirt?"
Dean and Castiel pack up the Impala and head down the K-10 towards St Robert, Missouri. It’s not a long drive - maybe five hours, six with heavy traffic - and they spend it mostly in silence, with the radio on low, the mixtape Dean gave Castiel before they were together in the tape deck.
The woman smiles. “Not a problem. I think everyone’s just glad you’re here. They’ve been doing their best, but this one’s a doozy, it requires different expertise.” She gives Dean and Castiel a loaded look like she’s trying to tell them something without needing to say it, but Dean just can’t figure out what it is. She laughs, rolls her eyes, and says, “Garth said you two were thick. So, double shot Americano and black English breakfast?”
Castiel’s hand reaches out from the furs and scratches at the base of his neck. "Well, I don’t remember. I woke up one night and I couldn't remember anything, and then when morning came, I turned into a raven. I thought maybe I was cursed? Like that movie?" Dean knows what movies are, he remembers them from when he was young, but he's not seen one in a while, so he has no idea what the other man is talking about. At Dean's confusion, the man continues. "I don't remember anything about myself, but I remember other things. Movies, food, books. The alphabet. There was a movie - well, a couple - for kids, about people who are cursed to be animals during the day and humans during the night."
before moving onto Benny's text.
Benny snorts and rolls his eyes, pulling his fingers from Dean's body and reaching down to roll the condom from his cock, tying it off at the end. Dean does the same and shoves it into Benny's outstretched and waiting hand before Benny puts them in the trash, covering them with papers so no one will see.
Benny rolls his eyes and looks back at his laptop, typing something before he hits the enter button and shuts the laptop. "You haven't even had sex with him yet and you're already talkin' 'bout threesomes. He may only want to have sex with you."
Dean grins over at him. "No, I promise, it's the stripper with the nipple tassels."
Gabriel doesn't look embarrassed, in fact, he looks quite proud of himself. He rolls his eyes.  "Just so you know, sex was the catalyst, what brought you back here."
Rowena kneels at the foot of the grave and splits the earth under her palms with a deep, loud rumble, like an earthquake. As she stands she raises her hand and the casket inside the grave raises with it, settling onto the grass next to the hole in the earth.
The oldest looks at the other too, sighs again, and says, “The first one was an accident. We were hiding in a drainpipe, he was just a homeless man looking for somewhere warm to sleep. I think he wasn’t right in the head, he started yelling at Dale and Ollie freaked out. And it just tasted so much better than dead people.”
"You're late," Charlie tells him, like he doesn't already know, her back to him while she leans over a huge pot on the stove that smells like Benny's special gumbo. "Benny ought to fire you."
Dean laughs again. "I will."
He’s alone in the room, at least until the door across from him opens and three figures come filing in, from tallest to shortest.
"Dean," Castiel interrupts, sensing a tangent coming on that he's unlikely to pull Dean from if he lets it go on too long. "I think I'm in love with you."
"Son of a bitch," Dean swears, shaking his head. "Son of a bitch." He pushes away from the wall and leaves Bobby without another word, searching the house for Castiel. He finds the angel out on one of the balconies, sitting with his legs crossed and his eyes closed. "Cas, man, I gotta talk to you. Can you tune out of angel radio for five minutes?"
Castiel shrugs his shoulders and says, “Either way works, you decide Dean.”
He doesn't understand why Dean makes an alarming choking sound, or why Sam is biting his tongue to stop an amused grin (though barely) as he signs something to Eileen that is too fast for Castiel to translate.
The cave he's been sleeping in isn't far from where they caught the moose, but he drops it gladly when he reaches it, jaw aching from the strain. The fire he lit in the burnt-out hole from the night before is still going strong, warming the cave and casting a yellow glow over the stone. The raven's followed him in, and it looks around itself, eyes wide and almost human.
"Hey Cas, busted the car already?"
“Are you alright?” Emma asks, a worried look on her face. "You look like you've seen a ghost."
Dean watches him gently pet his car and has to swallow the lump in his throat. Benny's always complaining about Dean's unhealthy obsession with his Baby, and maybe he's right. "Yeah, '67 Impala." Castiel hadn't seemed very interested in the classic status of his own car, and Dean's surprised he even managed to identify Dean's, especially in the dark.
is most definitely one of those phrases. Dean's mouth tilts up into a sharp smile. "Lean over, then."
The hare stops to sniff at the inside of a log and Dean manages to catch it by surprise, snapping his jaws around the back of its neck, snapping its spine between heartbeats. He huffs triumphantly and carries it back to the bag and clothes he left hanging in a tree on the outskirts of the city. He hadn't smelt anyone as he was walking, or anything different from what he left when he went hunting, so he's surprised to find Castiel waiting for him, leaning against a tree with his arms crossed over his chest. He looks far more human standing like that then he has in days, a contradiction to the straight-backed, blank-faced angel he is around everyone but Dean, but also sometimes including him.
Dean's eyes flutter closed and he rolls onto his other side so he's facing Castiel, forehead pressed into Castiel's stomach. Castiel feels a heat grow in his gut that he recognises as arousal, yet he can't explain why.
They're silent for so long that Dean isn't expecting it when Castiel speaks. "New Years, after Christmas, before school starts back up, I'll be back then."
He's followed it up with the winking emoji, the smirking emoji and the drooling emoji. Benny never uses emojis, and it's probably more hilarious that he has because he had more feelings than he could put into words. Just as he's about to reply, Benny has texted again.
"I reckon we could get a motel for the night, or at least a few hours, if you wanted to," Castiel says, and Dean almost chokes on a mouthful of fries in his rush to say yes. Castiel's grin widens and he nods.
Before Lucifer can speak, his mouth opened to do so, Dean points an accusing finger at him and says in a low growl, "If you touch him I will tear you apart with my teeth."
As Jack pulls away from Castiel, satisfied with the layer of saliva he's left on Castiel's cheek during his kiss, he says, "Cas, look!" On his outstretched hand, a small ball of flickering fire appears. He looks so proud of himself and his smile is wider and brighter.
Dean returns, overburdened with blankets and pillows, and the duvet from Castiel’s bed, and Castiel helps him carry them out to the truck. He makes sure that the go-kit is still under the back seat in case they come across trouble before they set off.
Dean shrugs and then nods his head. "John used to disappear a lot, the years after the fire," he doesn't really think he needs to explain that one, everyone knows how Dean's mom died now. He thinks Castiel will remember even if it's been twenty years, it kinda sticks out in your mind. "He met Adam's mom Kate in Minnesota, I was eleven, Sam was six at the time? He ran back home before Kate could tell him she was pregnant. When she got sick in '97 - stage four breast cancer - she hired a private investigator to find John, put it in her will that he was to go there when she died. He was seven I think? He just showed up on our doorstep, John lost it. He ended up living with Bobby for a while and when Dad died and custody of them shifted to me, I moved him back into the house." Dean nods his head solemnly. "He's a good kid, smart. His mom was a nurse, so he went to med school, he's doing oncology, wants to help people, thinks he needs to make up for not being able to help his mom. His graduation is at the end of the school year and he's top of his class."
"That I was working on it, cause I am." Dean reaches over and hooks his fingers in the belt loops of Benny's pants. "You working on it?"
Dean’s mouth migrates to Castiel’s nipple, sucking it to a hardened point. Castiel threads his fingers through the hair at the base of Dean’s skull and holds on as the angel lavishes both nipples with his tongue, switching back and forth between the two. Gentle nips of Dean’s teeth join his tongue, and then sucking lips, and Castiel’s left with bruises on his chest that’ll be there even when Dean isn’t. Bruises Castiel will feel, see, bruises he can touch to remind him of this moment every time he misses Dean.
ask? If you had, I would have told you that I spend most of my time killing hunters. The Grand Coven pays me for every body I bring them."
Dean presses a startled laugh into Castiel’s shoulder to soften the sound so he’s not disturbing others around them. He hasn’t been allowed to do his duty as big brother (tease the ever-loving shit out Sam) and it’s been bubbling up inside of him. “Oh, I’m
Sam’s eyes go wide and he climbs to his feet, says, “you found them in his closet? Did it seem like there was enough space for him to climb inside?”
"At least we know he's probably too drunk to be able to smell what we're doing," he tells Castiel, kneeing his thighs out of the way before stopping and grabbing a pillow from near Castiel's head to put under his hips. "That's better."
Benny takes his bottom lip between his teeth, the corners of his mouth turned up before he says, "Okay, not a problem." Dean tries really hard not to look smug, he really does, but he can't help it. Benny gives him an unimpressed look, then turns to Castiel to roll his eyes, like they have an inside joke at Dean's expense.
“Thank you Jack. You know, they’re much prettier when they’re clean. Your daddy is going to help me clean them, then maybe you can help him brush them. But you have to wash your hands first, okay?”
, her hair still wet from a shower. She looks tired, but at least he hadn't woken them. "Is everything alright, Castiel?"
Dean stares between his phone and Benny with his mouth gaping open in shock, before Castiel sends another text.
"I don't ever remember your mother having an accent."
"I'm gonna kill you, Benny, I swear to God."
When Castiel steps outside, waving into the house before he shuts the door, Dean's mouth goes dry. He thinks very seriously about blowing off dinner and taking Castiel back to his place, getting Benny to meet him there, because no one is allowed to be this hot in public. He's wearing a black wool sweater and a red leather jacket over the top, and when Dean can't stop staring, can't say a word, Castiel laughs. The jeans he's wearing are black, and the cut isn't quite the same as the ones Dean is used to, the material tight around his legs (and his ass), and when Dean still can't speak, Castiel does.
"You don't need to trust them. Trust
Castiel crooks his finger up, searching for Dean's prostate, finding it with a triumphant hum and stroking it until Dean's body shakes with pleasure. Dean's about to tell him to stop before he does something stupid like come too soon, but Castiel does it without having to be asked, pulling his finger from the clutch of Dean's body and replacing it with two. Without the fear of coming looming over his head like a storm cloud, Dean relaxes into Castiel's fingers, melting back against the mattress and closing his eyes. Castiel really is good with
“Do you want Eileen and I to go on a hunting trip?”
He hears Dean stumbling down the hallway - Sam likens it to the approach of a drunken zombie, grunting and all -  and when he steps through the doorway, Castiel has a coffee ready for him, held out. Dean takes it gratefully and swallows at least half of it while it's still boiling hot as Castiel says, "Eileen can be forgiven for being so loud because she's deaf, but Sam has no such excuse."
Castiel replies anyway. "Most likely because everyone was well aware that you were a baby gay and no one wanted you to closet yourself for fear of your mother's rejection. I don't mind, I'd rather it to another child living in fear of being who they are."
"Hold on," Dean says, then faces Rowena. "Their methods are too extreme, the last time they battled they killed millions of humans. Not all of them are bad, Rowena, I don't want to live at the expense of innocents."
Castiel takes a shower after Rowena and Jack leave. Since becoming human for the second time, showers have become his favorite part of the day. He enjoys the peace and the quiet, the tapping of water on his skin. The showers in the bunker are communal, like the showers in the homeless shelter in Emery had been, and Castiel finds comfort in it in a way that Dean and Sam both do not. They often complain about the lack of privacy, something Castiel doesn't understand given how their childhood on the road with John had been.
"Dean?" Castiel asks from the back seat, both confusion and worry on his face. Dean smiles back at him through the rearview mirror, trying to express to him that he's fine, but he doesn't think it works.
"You can't, cher, you'd miss my cock too much."
"It would be better if you and Cas date, too. Because I swear to god if you don't tag team me at least once, I will lose my shit."
"What do you mean?" Dean leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees. "Feedback? Like from a speaker?"
"Juliet?" Claire asks from where she's still kneeling next to Patience. "That thing has a name?"
The golden light in Kelly's eyes fades with the thump of her heartbeat until it's barely discernible. She's still awake, but only just, staring down at her son. Dean feels tears prick at his eyes as her breathing and her heartbeat slow to a stop. Her arm falls away from the baby and Dean picks him up just as the wave of power charges through the room again and light shines from Kelly's still body.
"Like I said, insurance."
. Now, he's just waiting for the moment that Castiel returns to heaven with Gabriel and Michael. It's an ugly feeling, one that sits heavy in his gut.
is optimistic.” Castiel reaches forward and threads his fingers through Dean’s fringe. “And I suppose Sam is covering for you?”
Dean makes a shocked noise and drops the plate he's holding into the bucket of soapy water. "What?"
Rowena hums, and after a moment's pause she says, "An hour and a half maybe. Not enough time for me to be ready, we'll have to wait until tonight." She blinks over at Castiel, still sitting in the corner of the couch—he's not moved for hours. Dean's starting to wonder if he's in shock. "You can stay here, I've got things to do today. Call back and order me coffee, please."
Castiel pulls Dean’s briefs over the curve of Dean’s ass before slapping him again, leaving a hot sting in the wake of his hand. Dean’s body jerks and he groans into the pillow. Castiel spanks him a few more times in quick succession before he leans down and sinks his teeth into the flesh of Dean’s ass cheek.
"Holy fuck," Dean says, turning the phone around so Benny can read it. "Am I reading too much into this or did he just imply he wants to hit home base with me on Saturday?"
"I had to," Castiel whispers, pressing his forehead to Dean, eyes fluttering closed. "I couldn't leave you, Dean."
There are far more demons than they were expecting, at least two dozen, and while a lot of them are already dead, or at least unconscious or exorcised, there's still more left over than there are of Dean and Castiel's group. Dean rushes to Bobby's side, where he lays in the fray, holding his side as blood spills between his fingers.
Sam sets the artifact in his hands down and removes the leather gloves from his hands. “It’s up to you, Cas. I can’t make the decision for you.”
Dean winces. "I broke his nose?"
Kelly shakes her head vigorously no. "No, you and Cas, that's it, no one else."
They have to do it soon, within the week. Dean thinks the baby will be born before the end of the month, and bringing a pregnant woman into a battle is slightly less reprehensible than bringing a pregnant woman who could go into labour at any moment. Dean's horrified at the idea that using the baby's powers could bring on her labour, but that they have to take the risk. "Sunday. Early morning, probably. Maybe two?" Dean offers. They have two days to get ready, which isn't long at all, and he searches the others' faces for their reactions to that fact, finding them all in agreement.
Dean finally takes a second to look at the human bodies still littered around the room. Only one hasn't been torn up by teeth, and is instead riddled with gunshot wounds, and Dean guesses he was the one who got Sam. Dean thinks about kicking him for good measure, but he doesn't. Instead, he reaches into the pockets of one of the hunters, riffling around for a set of keys, moving onto the next when he doesn't find any with the first.
Eileen shakes her head and says, “No, but you are going to present soon.”
Cas frowns, eyebrows knitting together and mouth turning down almost comically. "Strange?"
"Fuck," Dean groans breathlessly into Castiel's mouth, reaching down his body to grasp what little hair Benny has between his fingers. Benny's hips stutter at that, but when he catches his rhythm again he goes harder and deeper than before, so hard it pushes Dean up the bed in harsh little jerks and he has to brace his hand against the headboard so he doesn't bash his head into it. It barely takes any time before he's so close it feels like lightning is sparking through his veins, and everything that comes out of his mouth is an unintelligible moan. A hand grasps around his cock, and he's too overwhelmed to bother figuring out who's hand it is. "Fuck, I'm gonna come."
Castiel splutters, "I just… I thought it was just
Dean nods and leads Castiel inside and up the stairs to their bedroom. He lets go of Castiel's wrist and sits on the bed, staring down at his hands while the other man pulls clothes on and suddenly feeling unsure about… everything. A little voice in his head wonders if Castiel's going to leave now that he's got his memories back.
Part 1
He puts some music on, sets up the space heater in the corner of the garage and gets a bucket of clean water, a bottle of soap, a wash cloth, a brush for the grates, a clay bar, a few towels to dry her and a polish for the chrome. He sets everything out on the table his dad used to use for woodwork before his mom died, that he now uses as storage, before getting to work. He starts on her roof, using a step ladder to reach the other side rather than doing one half and moving to the other side before doing the other half, then works his way down. Roof, windows, hood and trunk,  and doors. Once he's done, the car soapy and smelling like cherry, he gets the brush out and goes at the grates, the headlights, the hubcaps and as much of the chassis as he can reach. He's soaked to the bone, and although it's warm in the garage, it's not warm enough, leaving him just on this side of shivering.
There's an eye rolling emoji, a facepalm emoji, a sick emoji and a vomiting emoji there and Dean laughs to himself.
-*-*-
Dean forgets about it when Benny leans over and places a kiss on Dean's temple. Castiel pouts out his bottom lip and Benny laughs. "Alright, you too. C'mere bluebird." Benny leans over Dean and kisses Castiel's temple. "So needy."
When he gets into the kitchen, Sam has bothered Jack and Claire into helping him with the food. Claire seems more than happy to sit at the stove while the vegetables boil, and Jack is having an absolute blast with a ball of dough that Dean quite identify in its current form. Sam's hands are covered in flour, and he wipes them on a cloth once he sees Dean and realises Mary's getting fussy, taking her from Dean carefully. He lifts her up so his face is level with her belly and sniffs, before his mouth turns up into a grimace. Huh, Dean hadn't even noticed. Guess it was a shit after all.
"Thank you," Sam says, tucking the blade into his belt.
He used to pilfer his dad's car and come up here with Sam when he was a kid, when their dad was on one of his worse binges. Years later, when he was older, he would come up here with someone, though rarely at this time of year.
Dean attaches his mouth to Castiel's throat as his thrusts become more rapid and irregular, fucking into Castiel until he's come too. Castiel kisses him as he shudders through his orgasm, taking his face into his hand and holding him there. Castiel can feel the warmth of his semen filling the condom and his body clenches around Dean once more, his cock twitching as he wonders what it would be like without the condom in the way.
"Don't worry, we don't do any crazy shit, we pretty much all feel the same way. We mostly do it because Eileen has a thing about big celebrations like Thanksgiving and Christmas and Easter. Her family are all in Ireland, and she doesn't really talk to them all that much. She has seven siblings, so she's used to big parties." Dean replies, shrugging his shoulders. "We mostly do it for the food and the football. And Sam likes the dog show."
Dean wakes when Jack does, hungry again, and Castiel's already there with a bottle held out towards him. Dean takes it but leaves it on the bedside table when he smells the surprise Jack has left him in his diaper. Dean barely managed to put the first one on right (and he had to replace it with a new one when he pulled the tab too hard and tore it off) and only with Jody's help, so he sends Castiel off to get her to help him again, setting Jack up on the bed with the baby wipes and a diaper while he waits. After a moment, he also gets some clothing from the box he'd brought in from Kelly's room, a coverall with giraffes on it that Dean refuses to admit to finding kinda cute.
Benny laughs, then gives Dean the most innocent look he can manage (which doesn't look very innocent at all) saying, "But cher, it was right there, and I
Dean makes another choking noise, and the heat in his gut has morphed into a full blown hard on. He reaches down and gets his hand around the shape of it, groaning at the touch. Benny's trying to convince Dean to get off with him, or call him over to fuck, and Dean's more than ready to agree when his phone buzzes with a text from Castiel. He's convinced then that they're conspiring against him, because Castiel has written,
Dean drags his claws out of Crowley and climbs to his feet as he shifts into his human form. "Pathetic."
“I’m sorry.”
"I know," Castiel says, and he looks rather smug, and far more human than he's looked in weeks. He's still flushed down to his chest and Dean sets a hand over his chest to feel the warmth of his skin. "I don't-" he doesn't finish what he's going to say, eyes shining angelic blue.
joined forces."
Dean swears. A four state car trip in thirty-six hours. "Your boss sounds like an asshole."
A couple of the bodies have wounds and lay on burnt shadows the shape of enormous wings. Angels.
He finds it after a moment, and pees before heading downstairs, hoping there's a coffee machine. There is, and it looks brand new, like Castiel got it when he came here, because his mother hadn't kept one. It's pretty easy to figure out, and Dean gets it working, making himself a cup and downing the contents once he's sure he won't severely burn his throat.
Dean shrugs his shoulders and pats Sam’s shoulder on his way past him into the kitchen to join Castiel and Rowena.
Benny does, using his knife to cut a slice of the cheese, then spread the dip on a piece of pita bread. He puts it all together and takes a bite of it all, chewing slowly and swallowing. "I like that better." He eats the rest of it in one go, smiling as he chews. "And what's the last one?"
He knows he's won when one of the two men makes a noise across the room - a small one he might not have noticed if he hadn't known they were there, and wasn't actively listening for them - before there are suddenly hands on him, on his waist, pulling him up and turning him around. Castiel's the one holding him, pulling him flush against his body, pulling his face forward for a hard kiss, but Benny's not far behind, one of his hands sliding down Dean's back, settling into the dip at the base of his spine.
"About forty minutes," Dean signs in reply. "Do you feel any better?"
It's hard to text one-handed, and it takes a while, but he manages to type out,
Lucifer sucks his teeth, and with all the impatience and sarcasm of a teenager who's being told off by their parents and couldn't give fuck, rolls his eyes and says, "Do you think I'm
Castiel's still nodding, face thoughtful, and Dean's worried he's going to say no, except when he finally does speak, he says, "Probably earlier."
"Take the humans with you, they will be killed for harbouring fugitives."
"Adult boys, Jack," Castiel tells him.
Dean sends Jody, Donna, Claire and the people they've rescued from the cells away with the angels.he two archangels stay with Dean and Castiel to take them away once they’ve find Crowley.
Castiel lets out a harsh breath through his nose after a few moments and says, "Dean, please, I can smell how upset you are. There's nothing you can do tonight."
"After?"
Dean's eyes flick up to Castiel's again, his pupils dilated and the flush spilling from his cheeks down his chest, and all he says is, "Yeah."
Bobby doesn't bother asking what he means, he's long past caring about Dean and Benny's complicated thing.
Castiel swallows the lump in his throat and lets what Dean’s said sink into his brain before he twists his body towards Dean and says, “Is it alright if I kiss you?”
-*-*-
Dean feels his heart drop into his stomach. "He's working with the Men of Letters."
"That crazy old bitch? Jesus," He replies. "Where has he been? And why the hell is he back?"
"I still don't always understand sarcasm, Dean."
Castiel’s mouth curves up, his eyes still closed, and he says, “Good boy, Dean.”
Castiel thinks about it for a moment before the realization dawns on him. “I still don’t understand why we couldn’t have stayed and sent them to Rowena’s apartment.”
fire, which he doesn't really mind because it means he gets to sit back and watch Dean while he works.
Castiel laughs. "What a feat."
Dean laughs, closing his eyes and laying his head over Castiel's shoulder. "It's required after these kinds of things. Go to sleep, baby."
"Pouch?" Dean asks, holding his hand out, catching the pouch when Castiel throws one down to him. Dean thanks him and crouches over the bones, reaching for the skull. The teeth are surprisingly easy to remove, just a twist and a tug, and he does it methodically,
Benny has the benevolence to make it quick, though Dean's not sure if it's for his own benefit or Benny's. He spears Dean with one of his thick fingers, slick with lube, then two, and then three while he works his mouth over Dean's dick until Dean's sobbing out moans he has to hide behind his fist. When Benny decides he's ready he lowers Dean's foot back down onto the ground and looks back into the room behind him. Dean's about to ask him what the hell he's doing and why he hasn't gotten his dick into Dean yet when Benny climbs to his feet and takes Dean's wrist into his hand, pulling him towards the desk. It's clean, no paper stacked into messy piles and random items on top like every porn Dean's ever watched, which really is such a waste, he would've liked to have seen Benny swipe it off the desk before fucking him over it. Why he had to be a neat freak Dean will never know.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Think about you and me having the entire bunker to ourselves for a week.”
Dean does give it to Claire when she holds her hand out for it, but he's also confused, and Castiel looks like he's about to take pity on him, but Claire beats him to it. "Dad doesn't agree with the minimum drinking age in America." She says simply, using her shirt to wrench the lid off the top, rather than use a bottle opener, and Dean frowns at her in confusion for ages. "He says that a high drinking age only serves to cause more alcohol related injuries than it was meant to prevent."
before she follows him. "We are so not fooling her," Castiel tells Dean, smiling down at the baby in Dean's arms before wrapping a hand around the back of Dean's neck to pull him down for a kiss. They keep their chests apart, careful not to squish the baby between them.
"Cmon, we're dining and dashing," he jokes in a whisper. Castiel looks horrified, and Dean bursts into laughter, catching the attention of some of the other diners around them. "I'm kidding Cas, I've already paid, c'mon."
Castiel doesn't understand what Dean means, but he doesn't bother inquiring, instead, tuning back into Sam and Eileen's friendly argument regarding a relatively recent pop culture reference that Castiel doesn't understand. Yas-key-er is an unusual name; he may have to use the internet to research it later.
"I feel like I want to say something, but I don't know what it is yet."
Sam agrees to go back with them, although hesitantly, still afraid of the hunters and the Men of Letters. It's midday in Sioux Falls, almost three hours after they left, and Castiel is exactly where they left him: perched on the back of the couch.
"And how many triads have you been in?"
Dean collapses onto the ground next to Castiel and says, "It's your name, maybe it's like with ‘Castiel’ and you just know it's yours. Just because you don't remember anyone calling you that doesn't mean you never were." He pats Castiel on the back and wiggles his toes in front of the fire. "I was thinking I could find a rabbit tomorrow, could make stew. Hopefully the lake won't be frozen over."
Dean grunts, rubbing his hand over his face. "Fuck."
They've garnered attention, a man covered in food spluttering and yelling, calling Dean every name under the sun, and Dean standing there, holding an empty bowl with nothing but a smile on his face.

,” Castiel begs, tugging helplessly at his wrists trapped in Dean’s hands. “Please, please, please, please.”
, it would be cool to see what the person that made this liked. And this one's Foreigner, I love Foreigner, I hope it has Urgent on it."
Dean nods his head solemnly. He doesn’t either, he’s rather absolutely any other alternative, but he’ll do it if he has to. “We’ll wait here until they get back.”
Sam squints at Castiel. “I mean, it’s not unheard of, but generally? Only omegas.”
Before Dean answers he tils Castiel's head up and leans in for a gentle kiss, hoping it expresses how he feels and he won't have to actually say it. When he pulls back, the look Castiel gives him tells Dean that it had.
Dean sighs. Jesus. He nods his head and says, “And you couldn’t stop.”
"That was way too easy," Castiel agrees, frowning. "But he's in and Dagon's dead. We need to go back to the witch and find out where Jack is."
"Happy," Dean whispers. "I was feeling happy."
to get them, or raise her suspicions. Besides, this world's Castiel and Dean will need it, he figures, might as well help them out.
, too."
Dean feels a headache coming on. He hadn't even thought of the reason for Jack's existence, but now that he has, he's slightly terrified at the prospect. "I can't even think about that right now, we don't have the time. But we will come up with something. I don't want him to have Jack either, we can't let Lucifer take him from Kelly."
Castiel turns back. "Nothing, why?"
Castiel nods. “I understand. Amazons must kill their paternal parent following their maturity.”
Benny makes another face, then sighs deeply, rolling his eyes. A small smile is tugging at the corner of his mouth and it makes Dean's chest tight. "Okay. You gonna put out, cher?"
Dean reaches over and pulls Benny in for a kiss, cradling Benny's face in his hands. "Okay, I'm gonna order food then I have to go back to work, but I'll see you tomorrow. Do you want me to text you later tonight?"
Dean shakes his head. "Nah, my niece Deanna- yeah, I know, my brother thought he was being funny. Joke’s on him, she's my carbon copy. I have another niece, Mary, she's ten weeks, and a niece by association, Elizabeth, she's twenty. Benny, you know the big guy at the bar who looks like he fell out of nineteen-ten? His kid."
The third item is Dean’s AC/DC shirt, which Castiel chalks up to its return to its rightful owner and calls it a day, but the fourth is when the pattern emerges. His sweatpants go missing, and he knows he left them on his bed when he went to the shower room. He finds another pair of pants to wear, but also reminds himself to ask Sam and Dean about the strange happenings.
"I've had a thought."
"What are we going to do once he's born? We can't let Lucifer take him," Sam whispers, blinking between Dean and the door like he's worried Lucifer is hiding behind it, listening. Dean wouldn't be surprised if he were, or if he was sitting in another - angelic - plane watching them. "Why would he father a child? Unless he had some plan to use the Nephilim's power."
A sharp trill cuts through the air and the raven dives at the hunters, pecking at their faces. Dean watches, letting out a soft grunt, desperately hoping Castiel will take it for what it is: a warning to
"Can Jack eat the eggs?" Dean thinks to ask when he remembers Jack's allergy. Claire nods her head slowly, still sipping her coffee. Dean finds a mixing bowl (after checking three cupboards) and sets it next to the ingredients.
“Dean? What happened?” Castiel asks, trying to twist his body so he can look back at Dean. The angel releases his wrists and Castiel manages to get himself up on his elbows and his upper body turned around. It instantly becomes pretty apparent why Dean stopped. “Dean, your wings manifested.”
"And just a smidge of German thrown in there on my dad's side," Castiel replies with a laugh.
is replacing the country. Castiel is sitting at the bar, wide eyes on Dean, and his drink is almost empty, so Dean makes a beeline for him, giving him a smile before he says, "Hey, Cas, need another?"
During pie and ice cream, Sam sets out the card games and they play a few rounds of texas hold'em, a few rounds of Cards Against Humanity (all of which Castiel absolutely destroys them all at it, and it's the funniest thing ever), then a few rounds of uno when most of the adults have had too much to drink to concentrate. Dean is having the
They reach Florida by noon the next day, then drive around the swamplands looking for a cabin they like that wasn't abandoned too long ago and isn't in disrepair. The place they find is small, but nice, with actual furniture and gas stove that'll work once they get the furnace going. The water works, and once the furnace is on, it'll be hot, too.
Castiel chews his bottom lip, thinking, then says, "Essentially an animal with a body mass over one hundred and thirty percent of their closest living relatives. Woolly mammoths are an example of megafauna, their closest living relatives are elephants."
Castiel taps his fingers on his knee, chewing on his bottom lip. "Probably. He'll try. But I'd rather destroy it than go back." The look on his face when he stares up at Dean is so intense that Dean feels the hair on the back of his neck stand up. "I had a reason to leave before, and I have a reason to stay now."
and Dean hates him.
Dean flips him the finger as he leaves, taking the lift back up to the station. Donna has disappeared when he gets there, but Jodie's still sitting at her desk and he waves at her as he leaves. He takes the route past his brother's office back to the shop and sees the Continental sitting in one of the parking spots out front. Eileen's just leaving and he catches up to her, waving to get her attention. She's got Mary tucked into the crook of her arm and she hands the tiny baby over to him without him having to ask. She walks towards the shop with him.
"Original paint?"
As they kiss, their hips move together, and Dean doesn't get a chance to take it any further than grinding before Castiel flings his head back and groans Dean's name quietly when he comes. Dean chuckles, but he's not mad or disappointed, just amused (and perhaps inordinately proud.) He lifts himself up on his knees and gets his hand around his cock, squeezing the head in his fist before jerking it roughly. Castiel helps him along by reaching his hand down and encircling Dean's. He’s squeezing harder than Dean would have, and digging the tip of his thumb into his slit.
"I'll keep it open for ten minutes, be quick," Rowena waves her hand and a portal appears in the middle of the room. Dean pulls his shoes on in a hurry before stepping through it and into a janitor's closet.
want to think about
"Can you speak any of the languages?"
They both carefully back away from the sleeping baby, and only speak again when they've climbed onto the bed, sitting next to each other against the headboard. "How did it happen?"
"No one's ever started convulsing before," Donna says while Alex checks Patience over. "She's also never gotten thrown across the room before."
Castiel doesn't like going out to pick up groceries by himself; he's so used to going with Dean that he feels surprisingly lonely. But Sam had asked him to, and promised everything would be explained when he got back, and Castiel trusts him so he goes.
That thought makes it a hundred times worse and Dean has to turn back to the stove to cover the extremely embarrassed flush on his cheeks. "Uh… It's just… like a normal relationship? But with three of us?" He tries to think about how he would explain it to a normal eighteen year old, one that isn't the daughter of someone he's dating. "How much do you know about polyamory and polycules."
. The weight of her father's disappearance and her mother's death hasn't hung over her head for her entire teenage years. In this world, at least before it ended, she was happy, loved.
for now, Cas, they'll explain later."

Rowena shoots him a look. "If you'd have let me finish I would have told you that the legend was wrong. Zeus didn't put Endymion under the sleeping curse, Selene did. For the last three thousand years, Selene has been dead, but the daughters she had to Endymion while under the sleeping curse are still alive. It's likely she handed the spell to them in case he were to ever wake." She suddenly grimaces and says, "As far as I'm aware, Endymion is still under the sleeping curse. And the story of Lot's daughters in Genesis is based on him."
