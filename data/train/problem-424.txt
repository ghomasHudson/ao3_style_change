Sherlock ran to the side of the bed and took John’s pulse and after he counted for a few moments put the information down on the tablet.
John’s face flushed slightly as he joined Sherlock in his booth.  Sherlock stared at John for so long that John felt as if he were going to faint. “Suddenly, I don’t feel hungry anymore, let’s go for a stroll.” John said as his fingers lightly touched Sherlock’s arm.  The heat from John’s touch penetrated through his suit and Sherlock shivered from the effect. Unsteadily, he got to his feet and offered John his arm and then John got up smiled and took Sherlock’s arm with pride. Once they were on the deck John felt jittery as the cold air hit his sweaty body. Sherlock reached out to pull John into his arm and then pulled back shyly. “John, you seem cold. I can hear the dance music starting. Would you…you dance with me?” Sherlock whispered, as he held out his arms.
Sherlock stared back; frustrated for there was something about the situation he was missing, “Merry Christmas, John. Oh, I almost forgot I have something for you,” Sherlock said as he handed John a brown wrapped package.
I struggle with him, brother against brother. I sucker punch my own brother, barely noticing as he hits the ground.
I can tell you’ve noticed their hardness. For you take a deep breath and throw another towel at me. “Cover up,” you snap, your voice hard and tremulous at the same time.
Sherlock paled as he scooted forward in his chair. He let go of John’s hand as he whispered. “What’s her name.”
John grimaced. “Of course it is. We can’t take the well-lit path. We have to take the dark sinister street. Well, here’s looking at you, kid.”
Sherlock sniffed as he reached out and took John’s warm hand in his cold, clammy one. “Here,” Sherlock said as he guided John’s hand between his legs.
There is fresh fallen snow that covers the ground and as Mary reaches down into its powdery depths you throw a perfectly aimed snowball at her. She laughs as you take her around the waist. I stare and marvel at your ability to be happy again. She slips and you both fall to the ground laughing.
I look into your eyes dearest John and though I’m afraid I can refuse you nothing. “Yes,” I whisper. I will my body to relax as I let you and Mary strip away my clothing. I start to shake. I am full of performance anxiety. It is an alien emotion, for I have always excelled at everything.
John nodded, “We should make a plan B in case one of us can’t make it. You know something dire, unavoidable”
Jake awoke to the coldness of pre-dawn and he shivered not wanting to leave the warmth of his sleeping gear. Clare was already up and getting ready to head out. Jake yawned, as he reluctantly got up. “Good morning,” he said to Clare in an effort to remain cheerful.
Anderson stands before me, the only thing unchanged are his sad, blue eyes. “You like the bike?” I nod still unable to believe Anderson’s transformation. He blushes under my gaze and looks down. “Well, I kind of went crazy after my wife left me and when I thought you had killed yourself.”
When Sherlock next awoke it was to the sound of John’s voice whispering in his ear. “Sherlock, I love you.”
After a small interval you come downstairs and we both look at our reflection in the mirror. We each have beanies on. I am wearing a hoodie. You are wearing a ripped up military jacket. We both wear baggy jeans. I have biker boots on. You have on your boots from Afghanistan. I smile at your reflection because I cannot bear to smile at you face to face.
You sigh, “For now yes. When you’ve recovered, and start sleuthing again I’ll have to revisit the issue.”
Hugh Laurie looked into John’s wide eyes and then up into Sherlock’s frightened ones. “I honestly don’t know, but one of you has made a powerful enemy. Look all I know is that I can’t bear this pressure any longer. I’m going to turn myself into the authorities.”
Sherlock awoke his mouth was dry, and he felt like he was going to be sick. Quickly, Sherlock ran down the hall to the bathroom where he promptly threw up, he then sat of the floor for a few moments while he got his breath back and then turned on the facet of the tub. “A nice bath, that’s what I need,” Sherlock thought as he purposefully kept his thoughts from the events of the last few days.
Sherlock cradled John in his arms and held him close. Clare stood in the doorway watching them both. She paused and then spoke. “I know what ails Doctor Watson. The pain will soon pass. John your senses have been heightened, it will take some time for you to adjust. I can help you.”
He rushed after her. “Wait, I’m sorry, please I need your…help.” Then he handed her a folder. “Please.”
A few hours later you and I stand in front of the mirror admiring each other in our tuxes. Mary comes up behind us. “You both look so handsome,” She says as she kisses your neck and then mine. I blush as Mary smiles. “You are so cute when you blush, Sherlock.”
“Hello, it’s Doctor John Watson, isn’t it?” She asked her voice just a tone above Sherlock’s own sweet low dulcet tones.
I light a cigarette. “Well, I guess sometimes old things are the best.” I then look him up and down. “Well, some things at any rate.”
Hugh looked up at Sherlock and then at John as the dark circle around his cornea expanded. “She wanted me to kill you, John.”
Anderson sighs in pleasure while he tastes me, then he stops when you move my legs apart. The rimming begins. I pull up on the head board, unable to bear the feel of both of your tongues inside me. The pleasure is too much. You both give me no mercy, while you flick around in my warm cavern like a nest of vipers. My hips attempt to shoot off the bed and my lower back stiffens.
The interviewer looked confused again, “You already have a house full of priceless paintings and art treasures.”
“No,” John cried as he rushed at the creature in fear and rage. John’s emotions got the better of him and as a result the Yoma quickly saw a weak place in John’s defense as its claws ripped his shoulder open. “Oh God,” John said as he sank to the ground in agony. The Yoma overcome with blood lust failed to notice Clare’s approach until it was too late. With a clean, thwack sound she sliced the Yoma’s head off its shoulders. The spurting head rolled across the courtyard in a grotesque windmill motion, until it flopped, unmoving against the wall.
She nods, then turn towards a metal tray where several vials and a syringe gleam, waiting to be used. I watch her, while she punctures each rubber seal with the tip of a needle. My mouth waters in anticipation. She finds a vein, then uses an alcohol swab to clean the area. “You know I get hard every time I feel the sting of the needle. So, it’ll be like we’re having sex.” I then smile at her, focusing my green eyes on her. “You’re beautiful,” I whisper, “and maybe when this is all over we can take a nap together, while I think of the perfect plan to find you someone wonderful. Someone who can love you like you deserve.”
I sit in a cold sterile room, the walls are grey cement, the table's chrome, it is an emergency hide out shelter, disused until today. Sniffing the air, I feel as if I can smell wet cement, cold, hard unyielding. Mycroft comes in with my tea, and the scent of boiling water and tea bag assails my nostrils. I grimace. “It’s not Twinings Earl Grey, it’s Twinings Lady Grey Tea.”
As Sherlock looked down at John’s legs and everything in between, he began to hyperventilate. But John was patient, his voice coaxing; working to pace Sherlock’s body to a tempo they would both enjoy and finally like the roots of a weed being ripped out of the dry earth Sherlock relaxed until him and John’s movements were fully synchronized.
“I love you too,” John said as he squeezed Sherlock’s long fingers. “Now, what can I do to help you concentrate?”
Sherlock nodded bravely, handed John a towel to throw on his lap for privacy and then at John’s signal he slipped John’s pants down.  When Sherlock’s hands reached his upper thigh, John jumped as Sherlock apologized, “I’m sorry my hands are cold.”
“John, I know you’re not asleep and we’re narrowing down the suspects. So …so are you up to doing some sleuthing with me tomorrow?” Sherlock asked as he leaned his head over John’s shoulder.
Anderson smiles as he rubs my cheek with the back of his hand. “Yes, Sherlock, I tried to off myself.”
John was wearing some sort of Samurai looking blue-grey garb, so that when he turned around to look over at Sherlock, his eyes took on the same coloring as the clothing.  John made a few more moves with the staff and then flopped down next to Sherlock. “Good morning, sleepy head,” John said as he kissed Sherlock on the forehead.
“Come on, let’s go inside and I will tell you what you slept through,” John said as he gently took Sherlock’s arm and guided him to shelter and warmth.
I am just about to join you both when a hear a sharp ping and then the sound of impact. A red dot appears in the middle of Mary’s forehead. A viscous river of blood runs down Mary’s nose and then her cheek. Even before she hits the ground I know she is gone. People shriek and run for cover. I run towards you as bullets rip through the soft drifts of snow.
I press my fingers over my bandaged palm. “Thanks for this,” I say. I am about to say something hateful but the sorrowful look in his eyes stops me.
All of Sherlock’s attention was focused on John, now. “John, it would destroy me if something were to befall you.”
“You’re not stupid. In fact, quite the contrary. You graduated in the top percentile of your class with an IQ of approximately 131, which means that you are gifted. Not a genius like me, but gifted.” I say as I yawn. “Now go to sleep.”
John opened his mouth and was about to ask how and then sighed, partly in exasperation and partly in excitement at the thought of surprising Sherlock. “Fine, what do I have to do?”
After she left John laughed as he pinched the skin on the bridge of his nose. “She really is a piece of work. Now Sherlock whatever would possess you to make a deal with Laura. What did she promise you?”
When they reached the house, Wiggins whistled. “Wow, is this what you call a small country home? It’s huge. I’m going to be bloody rich when you die.”
Laura laughed, “John you are such an adorable creature. Sherlock barely knew what I was talking about.”
You slip out from underneath me. I look at the shiny substance on your shirt. Sure enough there is an arced pattern. I put my face in my hands and groan. “I’m sorry,” I say in a small voice.
Sherlock stopped strutting and smiled at John, “I’m Sherlock Holmes, and everyone in this city owes me a favor.”
She giggled as she handed Sherlock a box of needles, syringes, and vials of the green liquid. “I wonder what the chemical composition of the drug is.” Sherlock thought as he turned the green vial around in his hand.
So, a few drinks later, John and Elsa felt relaxed in one another’s company enough for Elsa to ask him about his accident. After John told her the details they both sat quietly drinking their pain away until Elsa finally spoke. “Ach, listen to us, how gloomy we both are. We are on the most luxurious cruise ship in the world, come let us enjoy ourselves.”
Laura smiled and looked over at John and Sherlock as she said, “I’ll leave you two alone to discuss my agreement. Oh and should your conversation lead to pleasures of a more carnal nature remember to keep hydrated John.”
John held Sherlock’s hand in a tight grasp, for he could see the terror and sadness that lurked behind those murky green depths. He bent down and whispered in Sherlock’s ear. “I love you.”
My skin instantly becomes warm as you dearest John wrap one arm and then another around my waist. You take my hand and lead me to the bed.  I lay back and let you both explore me. Like the goddess Shiva, multiple hands and fingers stroke me. I am afraid and aroused at the same time. “I love you, Sherlock and so does Mary. Will you let us love you?” You whisper.
“Sherlock, you know I had to get away, then I found out about baby Alice and it took a while to get things sorted out.”
Elsa smiled, brushed a tear from her eye and wheeled John to the deck of the ship, where they let the cold sea air refresh them. After a few moments of silence Elsa spoke, “I’m sure that Sherlock won’t become bored with you, John.”
John nodded and was prevented from answering as Sherlock came through the door. “Well, did my grandma treat you right?”
When you spin me around to face you, you are shocked by what you see. You see tears cascading down my alabaster skin. One of them drips on your hand. You look at it as if were poison, which it is. For my tears are laced with fear, self-loathing and regret. I turn away from you and run to my room. I am just about to throw myself on the bed and burrow under the covers when you burst in. “Sherlock, talk to me-NOW.” You shout.
You nod. “Fine, Sherlock I’m sorry too, for you know…” He says as he gestured towards the marks on my body.
John’s tears froze on his face as he leaned towards Clare. “Clare, then I must end myself, for I won’t be the end of Sherlock, I won’t-I WON’T.” John shouted into the howling wind.
Sherlock nodded affirmatively, “Yes, we will be married in New York six months from now and I plan to help support my partner by painting, composing, and detective cases.”
Though Sherlock knew John was not telling the truth, he didn’t pursue it. He let the nagging doubt slide, so that he could concentrate on the case at hand.
“Sherlock, everything is going to be fine,” John said as he gently coaxed Sherlock’s tense body into a state of arousal with his hands, his legs and his mouth, until they were both inside out and outside in, until they were one.
I reach down; pick up my shirt and coat. We both stare at your black coat and stripped shirt that I let drop to the floor. As I put my coat on, the small square package of condoms falls to the floor. We both watch its descent. I make no move to pick it up. “I going to bed,” I say with a detached coldness.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Mycroft. “Baker Street is not set up for guests. Besides it will be much too noisy.”
“Ssssh, Sherlock,” John said as his fingers reached through the opening he had made in Sherlock’s trousers.
“Sherlock, come away from the window. Get dressed and quit feeling sorry for yourself, brother dear.”
Sherlock placed a kiss on John’s head and Mycroft marveled at his brother’s ability to show public affection, something he would have never thought possible. He then turned to face them. “I’ve saved the man I love, that’s what I’ve done.”
You nod, then like a good soldier you, Alice, and Anderson are gone—safe. I hear a low rumble, it makes the windows tremble. People look around in confusion. I get up making my way towards the door. I want to scream at them all to run, but I have a mission and all missions have casualties. I open the door, throwing myself to the ground when an explosion rocks the café where we all sat peaceful and carefree just a few moments before. Hands pick me up, moving me to safety. Though I can’t feel pain, I know I am injured. Surprise makes my heart rate spike, when I realize I am in Mycroft’s arms. I’m not surprised because he is carrying me. I’m surprised because his facial expressions are full of fear. He lays me in the back of a vehicle, then unbuttons my coat and rips open my shirt. A voice I don’t recognize says, “The glass shard missed a main artery. Just keep applying pressure, until I can stitch him up.”
For a moment there was an empty, dark silence and the only sound was that of the dragon’s labored breathing.  John shrugged his shoulders again. “I suppose that’s where the sacrifice comes in. Anyway we don’t really have a choice, so what does it matter. We can’t just let these freakish creatures run rampart through London, now can we?” John quickly looked over at Clare. “Not you of course.  You are a lovely companion.”
“The horse is fine and it’s not your fault that we’re running behind. Okay, well maybe it is, but no matter we are still ahead of the meet. We’ll just have to press on,” Sherlock said as he reached for John’s wrist.
Sherlock hated the sad, frightened look in John’s eyes and so he jumped off the couch and ran outside into the snow. John frowned, “What is he doing?” John thought as he watched Sherlock bending over in the snow. He didn’t have long to wonder, for at that precise moment a snowball hit John on the side of the head. John jumped off the porch yelling, “I am going to get you Sherlock Holmes,” John said as he made a snowball to rival Sherlock’s. Sherlock and John played in the snow like children. They squealed with delight as they pelted each other with snowballs. John threw a couple of snowballs in the direction of the dragons and he and Sherlock oooed and awed when the dragons spurt streams of fire from their mouth. Clare watched Sherlock and John, her face expressionless. She watched as a snowball that John threw flew through the air and then as it met the dragon’s fire, it dissolved into a hot sizzling puddle at their feet. Jake came up beside Clare and for a moment neither spoke and then Jake asked a question, “Clare, does Sherlock know what is required of John?” Clare turned towards Jake, her eyes wise beyond the youthfulness of her body. “No,” she said softly.
John looked up at Sherlock with a wicked glint in his eye. “Just wait until tonight. When you walk into my gin joint you are going to be screaming for me to play it again.”
You scratch the side of your face. “That’s because it’s usually you that causes all the trouble.” Then you take a step towards Mrs. Hudson. “Look I’m sorry you had to find out this way, but we aren’t just fooling around. We are all in a relationship with each other.”
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s chest as he talked. For Sherlock’s deep voice made his chest rumble like a purr. “My little pussy-cat,” John said as he stroked the side of Sherlock’s face.
I bite down on my lower lip, appalled when a slight moan escapes. It isn’t the ringtone on my phone. Anderson’ breath is coming in shorter gasps now as he relishes the dissipating humidity my sweat has left on his palm. My eyes grow wide for it appears as if he is going to orgasm right before my eyes. I lick my lips and wobble to my feet, then sit back down as Donavan approaches.
John opened his mouth to say something, but then changed his mind and snapped his lips shut as Sherlock wheeled him into another room filled with easels, each held a painting covered by canvas. One by one Sherlock ripped the protective coverings off each work of art as he faced them toward the light.
Teddy was blushing furiously as he avoided John’s gaze, “I say I didn’t mean to offend Watson, old boy. Let me make it up to you. Why don’t you join us at the Captain’s table, you know the “A” list?”
Sherlock awkwardly backed out of the main room went into the kitchen and when he opened the small refrigerator he gasped for there was nothing in it. “John, your ice box is empty.”
John flushed as Sherlock’s scent filled his nostrils. “Well, I can see that I am going to have to educate you on the classics.”
John sighed as the sales girl brought out one outlandish shirt after another until he firmly said, “I just want a simple white dress shirt.”
Sherlock walked forward and said just out of earshot of the security officer said, “What a colossal moron. He makes Anderson look like an Einstein. I’m surprised he didn’t tell you to not leave town.”
We are escorted to Mycroft’s panic room.  After getting a list of supplies from you on what it will take to assist in my toxic clean-up, Mycroft locks us in. The room is spacious, industrial looking, cold, it is you-Mycroft.  There is only one bed. You lead me to it and I collapse in a heap. God, I feel so tired so nauseous. John, you know for you are already nuking a cup of chamomile tea for me. You start to put the cup in my trembling hands. But we both know that I will drop it. You blow on it to cool the tea off, then you offer me a sip. My hands cover yours as you steady the cup.
“Sherlock, I’ve got some medicine for your nausea. I can’t give it to you orally or in an IV, it’s a suppository.” You blush and hand me the package.
Sherlock started to edge forward, but Mycroft held up his hand. “Sherlock, don’t come any closer. Although, you’ve already been exposed, it would ease my mind to have you at arm’s length. Sherlock, I most likely will not make it through this.”
A man steps up to the front of the room and everyone silences. “At approximately 8:21 this evening Scotland Yard was bombed along with other buildings in the area. So, far no terrorist group has claimed responsibility. This image was transmitted to national security just before the bomb hit as well as the words ‘undeciphered’.” The man pauses, then projects an image on the screen in front of us.
After he injected him he kissed the spot on his arm. “Now, I’m going to give you some edible cannabis, it will help with the nausea.”
An’s bottom lip trembled. “The legend is not specific that I am aware of. It just states that a sacrifice of blood must be made at the proper time, so that the portal of evil can be closed. That is all I know.”
You rub your hand further up my thigh until I gasp. “John, not red. The dress should be midnight blue, to match her lovely eyes.”
“No need. I have pants and a shower at my flat,” I say and then I put on my helmet. It mutes the sounds of the city, would be it could mute the sounds of my brokenness. Only the syringe can take away my despair. “We must get back to Baker Street. I need a fix,” I think as we race through the streets.
Anderson bends over the body and inspects the victim’s feet. “The toes have been removed with a surgical instrument.”
As the wheels from John’s chair rolled over the gravel drive, Sherlock thought that the sound reminded him of the sound of bones being crushed. A soft snap, then shatter, broken-gone. John leaned his head back against Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock smiled as a familiar warmth spread throughout his body.
By the time he was done Sherlock was laughing uncontrollably and then just like that Sherlock began to respond to John’s gentle touch. At first Sherlock fought against John’s attempts to arouse him for he was humiliated by his lack of performance earlier in the evening and then a familiar stirring in his groin made Sherlock’s heart beat faster, made his brow sweat, made the thoughts in his normally structured mind turn chaotic, made his body strain with need, as he felt the uncomfortable tension, soon to be replaced with mind-numbing desire, followed by a release so intense that Sherlock felt as if he were going to lose consciousness and then everything that was dry became moist and everything that hurt became whole as Sherlock shuttered in John’s arms.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. “Yes, John all of London can hear you. You know how I am when I go to my mind palace. We must work on your stress reduction techniques.”
Sherlock glanced at John, and then looked away. “John, I am surprised at your lack of compassion. Clare is desperate and she is definitely very far away from home.”
When Sherlock joined the Shaman and John in the front room, he looked bored, yet alert. “Damn, look at him,” John thought angrily. The anger only lasted for a second as another thought wound its way into John’s mind, “Did Sherlock even care for him? Was he even capable of such an emotion, or am I the ultimate puzzle, something to solve and then toss aside.” The thought made John want to hide under the house like he used to do as a child, so that he could avoid a beating.
Sherlock smiled,”I was just beginning to think attractive people didn’t travel anymore and then here you are.”
As Sherlock wrapped John in a towel, with the intention of drying him off, John shook his head and whispered, “No, Sherlock don’t dry me off, take me to bed, and make love to me for I want to feel your wet skin against mine.”
I look down, I am fully aroused. I tap on the bathroom door. I see the outline of your body. I slide the door open and join you.
The longer he stayed in his demonic form the more his human half remained repressed as John gave into blood lust and became a killing machine. As he gazed upon one of the horsemen in his bubble, John barely noticed the look on his face as he sliced the horseman’s head off. Roaring in victory John turned to take down the next horseman, but just as John approached the bubble, the horseman blurred out of focus and was gone. John threw back his head and screamed and then his heart froze in terror for try as he might, John could not regain his human half for he had become a full Yoma-a demon.
I open my mouth to reply, but clamp it shut when our waiter arrives. After placing our order, I lock eyes with Anderson’s. His pupils are expanded, making his eyes look black. Just like mine. We stare at each other until our drinks arrive. I purposely order a drink with a cherry in it. Anderson watches as I pluck the plump, processed red fruit into my mouth. His hands tremble as I make a show of licking it.
John looked up at Sherlock in wonder. “Wow, it’s Hugh Laurie. I didn’t know that you were personally acquainted with him. He’s one of my favorite musicians.”
I look up at him with a witty retort on my lips, then stop. He is wearing black tactical gear and his hair is messed up. He looks lost and his vulnerability makes him look younger. Though he tells the man who is stitching me up to not be gentle, due to the fact, that my skin is tough like a housecat’s, he looks down at me in concern, and I know without a shadow of a doubt that my loss would devastate him. It shocks me, yet confuses me at the same time, considering how many times he has put my life at risk.
Sherlock’s eyes filled with tears as he adjusted John on the Arabian Stallion that pranced beneath them. John’s face was white as he bit his lower lip in an effort to control the pain.
Sherlock’s grandma looked sad, “Time for you to go I suppose,” she said as she hugged Sherlock and then hugged John as well.
“I loathe you when you are like this, John. You’ve moved on. Sure I let you grieve, but you’ve moved on. I gave you a Jesus Christ resurrection miracle and you still moved on. Now, get out.” I shout through clenched teeth.
John’s face looked like he had been slapped. “Sherlock, we can’t wait for the snow storm to let up. We are leaving tomorrow for battle and since you aren’t taking this whole thing seriously, you can just remain here.”
When the horsemen were lined up in their sites, demon-John halted until Sherlock was parallel to him. “Well, this is it then, John,” Sherlock shouted above the din, “Just like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, except without that deplorable song, Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head.”
Sherlock sat down on the ground with a heavy thud. “Well, we aren’t going to find out anything locked up down here. Is there any way you can spring us, An?”
I close the door and then focus my attention on Anderson. He looks less confident as I stare him down. He doesn’t break eye contact though.
“I can’t kill the creature because its John…John has become a full Yoma-a demon.” Sherlock said just before he passed out.
When Sherlock next opened his eyes he lay strapped down on a gurney. Doctor Dunkle looked down at him. “Sherlock, you are a fine boy with a fine mind. You are the only patient to come out of solitary unscathed. Unlike your friend Daniel. He was weak and is now paying the price for it.”
Sherlock jumped in bed and held the covers up for John. John willingly slipped in beside Sherlock. In a few moments John forgot his nightmare as Sherlock encircled him in an embrace. “John, where were you, tonight?” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock shrugged it off. “Whatever you say, brother mine.” He looked around the room, eyes glazed over and his jaw went slack.
Sherlock looked at the black card in his hand as if it were a poisonous viper. John walked over and covered Sherlock’s hand with his own. “Sherlock, “John said softly,” it’s going to be alright. Give me the card back. I will only give to you if I need to.” Sherlock swallowed and handed the card back to John. Sherlock’s phone rang and everyone jumped but Clare.
I slink over to his bedside, resting my upper thighs near his head, then I hold out one hand and then the other. They are both empty. “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I must have been mistaken.”
Sherlock peered at John as if he were an insect under a microscope, “You say that the pain…isn’t that bad…. No, by my calculations you are in pain 86.5 percent of the time.” Sherlock smiled, pleased with himself for figuring out the answer so quickly and then the ramification of his deduction hit him full force and Sherlock felt as if someone had punched him in the stomach.
The expression in your eyes hardens as you open my coat to reveal my dark prostitute attire; your eyes linger on my fishnet shirt, then your gaze moves down to my leather pants. They are very tight. There is little left to the imagination. You suck in a small gasp of air. “What’s the matter John?” I ask as you examine a nasty looking bruise on my left side. I then decide to play you. “Ouch,” I cry out as you put some experimental pressure on the bruise.
I go outside to have a cigarette. I watch you and Mary from the doorway. You both are so beautiful. Too beautiful. I fear my darkness will sully you both. Then the lights flicker. Intermission is over.
He does so. The bandage unravels and falls to the ground. I approach him, untwist the lid, and begin to massage the ointment into his lacerated skin. He winces but does not cry out when my fingers touch his wounds, wounds that I created. When I am through, I back away. “Anderson…I’m sorry about last night.”
He doesn’t beg me to be gentle, he just prepares by opening his legs further apart. I look into his wide blue eyes and ease into him. I am all prepared for an all-out assault. I surprise myself and him when I deliver what he craves, gentleness. I tell myself I am only being gentle so that I can watch him slowly unravel, but I find my body enjoys the slow thrusting movements just as much as Anderson does. Then it’s time. He tenses beneath me, grabs my forearms, the skin on his neck flushes, his body tightens all around me.
John laughed. “Sherlock, I know when you are fake crying, just quit screwing around and join us. I’ll give you a few minutes to compose yourself and if you’re not out and in the living room, I will drag you in there myself. So, get with it. Oh and by the way, I know you’ve been using again and that had better stop, or I’ll have you locked away in the dungeon.”
I close my eyes letting them lead me to the bed. My breath comes out shallow and fast when they remove my robe, then my pants. I shiver under the covers while I watch them both undress. Then like two seductive cherubim they approach me, each flanking a side like I’m the ark of the covenant.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, he swallowed, then spoke as if in slow motion, “John, …lets…just focus…on the case.” The “s” in case sounded like a hiss as Sherlock elongated the syllables.
“You straightened my nose, almost beat my sparring partner to death, licked blood from my fingers, bit my lip and sucked the blood from that and this,” Sherlock said as he moved John’s hand discretely to the hardness between his legs.
John turned around and smiled at Sherlock. “Sherlock, you’re awake. Good to see you up and about. Come here and let me see that nose.” John said cheerfully. Sherlock silently padded over to where John stood and let John’s gentle fingers examine his nose. “Aw, my poor Sherlock, you are going to look like a raccoon tomorrow. A cute adorable raccoon,” John chuckled as he put his arms around Sherlock and held him close. After a few moments John reluctantly pulled away and beckoned Sherlock over to a chair. “Sit down and have some of my noodle soup,” John said as he proudly brought a bowl of the delightful smelling soup and sat it in front of Sherlock.  Sherlock usually picked at his food if he ate anything at all; however this time he sipped the soup with a relish that John had never seen Sherlock apply to food before. As John watched Sherlock lap up the soup he was content just to stand there and watch him. “Even when he slurps his soup, he fascinates me,” John thought.
John’s eyes began to tear up as he pulled Sherlock’s head down so he could kiss him. “Sherlock, I owe you so much. I was so alone before I met you and…” John’s voice trailed off in a gasp as a spasm of pain rippled through the muscles of his lower back.
John laughed as Sherlock wheeled him into the room and began to undress. “Sherlock, you do realize that you left your credit card with the clerk. He’s probably charging and downloading porn by now. Aren’t you worried about identity theft?”
Sherlock spoke for the first time since Mycroft had found him in a state of overdose a week earlier. “No, I won’t be able to stand it. I will be good. I promise.”
I wave you off pretending to look through a microscope that I have set up in the kitchen. “Take your time, whatever.”
Sherlock turned the top and bottoms in his hands curiously. “How does this thing go?” Sherlock asked as he held the pants up.
Sherlock let John pull his body closer to that he would be able to sit up and yet still have John’s body against his back for support. Sherlock was out of breath from the small effort. “So, where is here?” he gasped.
Sherlock drew in a deep breath. “John, when we first made love, I told you that I hadn’t had sex with another person, willingly, that was true. I was raped in prison when I was in Eastern Europe. Mycroft put a stop to it as soon as he was able, however, he couldn’t act too concerned lest he compromise my cover. That time wasn’t too bad. The first time was the worse.” Sherlock gulped and continued on. “I was fourteen and home for the holidays. My parent’s had left the house on a weekend getaway and I was alone in the house with Mycroft and some of his friends. Mycroft left to get more beer and cigarettes and I went down to the kitchen to rummage around for something to eat. When I walked into the kitchen one of Mycroft’s friends commented on how beautiful my curls were.
John threw the sheet back and maneuvered himself into his chair, noting with a lump in his throat that Sherlock had taken the time to position it for his ease and comfort. “I’m coming with you. He’s my husband and he may need a Doctor.”
The woman’s eyes grew large as she licked her lips nervously, “That is the Shaman’s, how did you get it?”
John shivered and didn’t doubt that Laura was correct. “I wonder if she’s the anti-Christ?” John thought as he looked into the seductive depths of her eyes. After a few moments John looked away and Laura laughed again.
“Are you going to tell Lestrade about…?” My voice trails off as we both look over at the discarded syringe and rubber tie.
I wake up, feeling as if someone has stuffed a wad of cotton in my mouth. Yawning, I make my way downstairs where I hear you and Mrs. Hudson talking.
John suddenly felt as if he couldn’t breathe when Sherlock smiled at him. “Sherlock, let’s change the subject okay?”
Sherlock felt icy cold, as he trudged down the stairs and out into the rain. He hailed a cab and headed in the direction of China town.  On the way there Sherlock felt as if his whole world was coming apart. John was beginning to turn into someone he didn’t recognize. The cab stopped and deposited Sherlock at his destination. It had finally stopped raining and every sound on the street echoed. The click of the cab door shutting reverberated off the buildings like the sound of a garbage truck on trash day. Sherlock made his way to where the last body had been. There was nothing there, then Sherlock heard the noise of a struggle somewhere nearby. Sherlock made his way towards the noise and was just in time to see an Asian gang member trying to choke Clare. She struggled as John tried to help her. Sherlock could tell by the way her body was starting to sag that she was going to lose consciousness soon.  Just before she was ready to collapse, Clare changed. Her body became thick, her hair thin wild wisps, eyes glowing she hacked at the gang member until there was blood spray everywhere. Another gang member tried to attack John, but he was ready for him. Sherlock went numb with shock when John pulled out his sword and began to cut the gang member down. Sherlock couldn’t tell whether the man was screaming for mercy or just screaming, however, the site that froze Sherlock with horror was the site of John reveling in the kill. John’s eyes were full of lust as he let the blood from the dying man’s throat spray all over him. Sherlock sank to the ground in despair, trying to shut out the crazed look on John’s face.
John smiled up into Sherlock’s bright eyes. “My darling. My dearest Sherlock, what will you do when I am no longer with you?” He thought to himself.
John gave Sherlock a sly smile. “Do you have an observation Mr. Holmes?” Sherlock shook his head overwhelmed by the betrayal of his body-his desire for John. “Well, perhaps I might shed some light on the situation. You watch my throat as I swallow and you are reminded of something else are you not?” Sherlock’s face blushed a becoming shade of red. John smiled as he teased Sherlock just a little bit more. “Tonight as we lie underneath the stars I will test my hypothesis.”
It feels as if the nerves in my arms have caught fire. John is still not home. I grind my teeth together. I creep down the stairs and walk out into the night. Like an undead creature I make my way across town. I withdraw enough money from my account so as not to arouse Mycroft’s suspicions and then I get the rest from a secret account no one knows about. With money in hand I buy enough substance to last for a few days.
Embarrassed Sherlock tried to get up, but John held him down. “Where are you going, handsome?” John said as he stuck his tongue in Sherlock’s ear with a quick flick motion in and then out.
Sherlock returned an innocent look at Mycroft as he replied, “Right, the game is on to find the statue.”
Sherlock nodded. How could he forget the way John’s head had went back, his mouth open gasping for air, as Sherlock took off his jacket?”
John stood behind Sherlock as the cameras blinded them both, after a few shots, John excused himself on the pretense of a special engagement. As he moved past Sherlock, Sherlock lightly touched his arm and even though his touch was light, it felt as if John’s arm had caught fire, as he put his hand over the place in an attempt to memorize the feeling of Sherlock’s touch on his arm. John looked through the crowd and waved as he spotted Sharon. Before he made his way over to where Sharon waited for him, John spared one more backwards glance at Sherlock. Sherlock caught his eye and even though he was being swallowed up by the crowd, Sherlock maintained eye contact with John as long as he could.
“Anderson, I need you to keep John, Alice and Mrs. Hudson safe, don’t let John try to be a hero and Anderson I love you and I’m so sorry for all my harsh words and…”
A few hours later Sherlock and John lay together in an outdoor sauna. The palm trees swayed in the desert breeze and John sighed in pleasure as the rays of the sun shone down on his upturned face. “Sherlock, this place is amazing whom did you say it belonged to again?” John asked as he massaged Sherlock’s lower back.
Sherlock put the cigarette back in his case and stood up abruptly. “Sorry, I guess I must be going.”
John parried with his sword, miraculously he kept his balance, as he sliced at the Golem’s knees. Sherlock stood transfixed. There was no way John should be fast enough to block that attack, yet somehow he did. Sherlock stumbled against the wall, as Clare shoved past him to assist John. Her monstrous transformation took place as she battled the Golem. The Golem slashed into her abdomen with the metal prongs on the end of the mace. Even though the wound bleed profusely, Clare kept fighting as if she didn’t notice. John crept up behind the Golem. The Golem realizing he was outnumbered slammed his elbow into John and ran through the shattered entranceway. John fell to the ground like a rag doll. Sherlock had his arms around Mrs. Hudson to protect her. For moment no one moved. A dog barked and howled in the distance. Clare was the first one to get up; she walked over and took John’s pulse.
I see the concern in your face. I smile as I dig in deep with a verbal thrust. “Sod off, John, I’m going out. Don’t wait up.” The hurt in your eyes makes me smirk.
Sherlock was just about to move away from John, when John’s hand reached a spot that Sherlock couldn’t ignore. “John, we are in a cab for God’s sake,” Sherlock hissed.
I walk out of St. Bart’s with the knowledge that I will fake my death. A part of me hopes it will break your heart as you have done mine.
John angrily clutched the arm rests of his chair, “He doesn’t even know the extent of my injuries, so how can you even make such a guarantee?”
Sherlock took off his coat and meekly handed it over to John. John threw the coat over the front of Sherlock and unbuckled his trousers. Sherlock’s whole body jumped when he felt John’s hand reach inside and touch his bare skin. Sherlock leaned his head back against the seat. “John,” Sherlock breathed, as John’s motions became more aggressive. The world always seemed so far away when John aroused him. It was the one time Sherlock’s brain wasn’t going a thousand miles per hour. It was the one time he felt relaxed and God knows he needed to relax.
I swallow. Tears fill my eyes. As much as I felt the pain of your rejection and I grieved for my plight of unrequited love, I let you grieve. I cut you to the core. I blink back tears. “I promise, Mary. John will not fall. I would fight legions of angels to protect him.”
Irene appeared to pout. “Mycroft you’re such an old fuddy duddy. Laura wouldn’t they all three make such wonderful pets? Sherlock and Mycroft could pull John around in a little cart. We could share them between us.” She stood up and winked at John. “Let’s go inside.”
Lestrade scratched his head as John and Sherlock left. “Now, that was bizarre,” Lestrade remarked aloud to no one in particular.
Sherlock’s eyes looked so wise and sad that John swallowed. “Whatever you say John darling, I am just repeating something Irene told me.”
Sherlock sighed in relief as he laid back on the mildewed floor for as the drug coursed through his system Sherlock forgot what it was like to be him, forgot what it was like to be a genius, forgot what it was like to have a mind that moved at the speed of light 24 hours a day, and most of all he forgot the look on John’s face every time Sherlock hurt him with a careless word or gesture. The room felt hot and stuffy, so Sherlock slipped his shirt off, rolled it underneath his head, curled up and let sleep take him, for as long as he was high Sherlock didn’t have to dread the crazy, circus dreams that plagued his mind every night.
I stand up and wash my hands off. Then I look at you and I want to hurt you like you hurt me. “Why John, you are a proper genius. However, did you figure that out by yourself?” I ask as I do a quick mock parody of a man getting off with my hands and hips.
The music had shifted into another sultry tune, “The Kiss of Fire.” Laura leaned back in a suggestive pose and lit a cigarette clearly enjoying John’s discomfort. “John do you believe that there is such a thing as a kiss of fire?”
“Sherlock, you are my heart, my love, my strength, my best friend. When you hurt, I hurt, when you cry I cry,” John said as a tear slid down his cheek.
Sherlock looked skeptical. “It sounds like the Biblical legend that speaks of the four men of the apocalypse.”
Sherlock didn’t doubt that John would surrender his sword to protect him, but Clare? Sherlock looked over at Clare. She was calm, cool, not a hair out of place. “Clare, you surrendered your sword too?” Sherlock asked skeptically.
John frowned as he spoke to the Shaman, “So, if they aren’t fully generated wouldn’t they be less powerful?”
John looked at Sherlock with questioning eyes. Sherlock didn’t turn to him. He just sat staring at the plush, cream carpet beneath his feet. John shivered, wondering why he suddenly felt cold.
John turned into Sherlock’s arms and smiled, “Sherlock…” John whispered and then cleared his throat before he totally lost it. “I didn’t get any sleep last night; I’m scared but excited too.”
John looked down but not before Sherlock observed the hurt in his eyes. “Right, then everything’s back to normal.” John said as he stared at a pattern in the blanket that covered Sherlock. “Hospital blankets are so ugly,” he thought.
Mycroft put his fingers together and rested them just underneath his nose. “The statute of Bastet is thousands of years old but is worth very little, due to the fact that it is an undocumented ornament that would have been used as a decoy piece.”
Sherlock remembered that he had often become irritated with John because he was so solicitous during their previous bondage games. “For God’s sake John, stop talking and get on with it,” Sherlock had growled at John in the past.
“Sherlock, can you hear me? It’s me, John. Sherlock, answer me,” John’s frantic voice called Sherlock into the present.
Sherlock knew that John was not himself and that he should precede with caution, yet Sherlock craved anything new.  “New, God new was wonderful,” Sherlock thought as he gave John the go ahead.
The next morning Sherlock shook John awake. “John, I got a text from Lestrade, there’s been a murder in China town, and John the only witness told the police that the murderer was a giant.”
Little wisps of snow stuck in John’s beard as he and Clare led their small army to its place of Armageddon.  John hardly noticed as the cold covered his face with an icy sheen, for he would soon be in battle and his skills he acquired as a Yoma would be put to the test. Even before they reached their future battleground, John could smell the enemy. Raising his hand, John ordered the army to stop for the night and once it was dark, he would order a scout to size up their foes.
John licked his lips with just the tip of his tongue. It was a gesture that never failed to undo Sherlock. “So, we’ve left Mycroft and a troop of mercenaries somewhere back there and now we’re going to make love in the desert?”
John couldn’t hide a giggle as he looked away from Mycroft out the window. The rest of the drive remained shrouded in silence.
His hands shake when he takes the cup from me. I steady them so he can swallow. He takes a few sips, then looks at me, resting his head against my shoulder. “Talk to me, Sherlock.”
Sherlock was in one of his black moods staring moodily out the window. John watched Sherlock as he shifted uncomfortably in his chair his brows knitted together.
John lay in Sherlock’s arms content and relaxed. Sherlock smiled as he blew on the small hairs on John’s arm, noting with satisfaction when they stood up on end. John nuzzled into Sherlock’s chest enjoying the game. After a few moments of playing around Sherlock sighed. “We have to be ready tonight. I don’t want any mistakes. There’s a lot at stake,” Sherlock said as he gripped John’s hand in a firm grasp full of tension.
“Sherlock, come on stay with me,” John said softly as he moved his hands over Sherlock’s bare back, adjusting Sherlock’s hips for a perfect fit. All fear then left Sherlock’s face as he became immersed in the rocking motions that made him and John one.
Anderson takes shelter behind his menu. I pounce on him like a tiger. “I mean this place looks expensive and it’s not as if you’re going to get lucky. You’re a fool, Anderson.”
I see you struggle with the clues I have given you. Then you look me in the eyes. You frown, then you look away. When you glance back into my eyes I hide nothing from you. You take a sharp intake of breath. I smile. “Ah, John Watson finally understands. He finally observes. Don’t look so scared John. For a machine can’t seduce you, only a man of flesh and blood can make you throb, make you burn, make you scream. So, see no need to worry John. It’s only me the cold machine. Now get out.” I spit out the last words like an animal facing death after its paw has been caught in the steel jaws of a trap. Then my heart beats in anguish. What if you leave? Then my heart beats in fear. What if you stay?
“You’ve put me in danger before and it hasn’t bothered you. Now give me your phone so I can type out a list. Give it to me.”
John laughed until the tears rolled down his face, “No, it’s a movie about a guy who is stuck in a wheelchair and he witnesses a murder. It’s a famous movie by Alfred Hitchcock.”
As John stepped further into the room, Confetti jumped off the bed and ran out into the hall. John called to Confetti. “Come on Boy, it’s me John.” Confetti whimpered and then ran and hid in the living room. John shook his head. “What the hell is wrong with that dog?”
You come into the room, stopping when you see me frantically looking for a Benadryl. “Sherlock, you took one of Anderson’s pills, didn’t you?”
John opened the case and whistled, “I know just enough French to be embarrassed, this is frightfully intimate. It says something like,”Thank you for the four nights aboard the Gabriella.”
“Sherlock, right here, “John whispered as his warm breath tickled Sherlock’s cheek. “Now prepare yourself, for you have been a very bad boy and you need to be punished. “Then Sherlock felt the slight sting of the riding crop against his thigh as he began to shake with anticipation. Usually in these types of bondage John would constantly check with Sherlock to make sure he was still okay.
Sherlock made his way across town, melting into the darkness until he made it to his destination—a palm reader, a palm reader that owed him a favor. A red neon lit giant hand blinked outside a shabby building. He looked both ways, then made his way through the fog to the entrance. When his hand turned the knob a bell announced his arrival. A sullen looking girl looked at him with disinterest. Her dark make-up accentuated her deep resentment of everything and everyone around her. “What service do you want?” she asked then pointed to a sign listing the different services offered.
John wheeled them both to a secluded place near a life boat. He then reached down towards Sherlock’s lap until he found what he wanted.
Sherlock felt a feeling of dread when he looked at John, for it seemed that John had gained a whole new level of energy in Clare’s world. “Was Clare correct? Was John turning into some sort of monster, and if so what was the cure?” Sherlock thought as he struggled with the facts of their situation. Nothing was as it seemed anymore and Sherlock’s powers of deductive reasoning seemed to be failing.
John’s hands were starting to shake, partly in anger and partly in excitement at the prospect of walking again. “What do I have to do?” John asked as he clenched his hands in his lap.
Sherlock sat down in the courtyard, folding his legs into a meditative pose. He closed his eyes, accessing his mind palace. The peeling paint of the walls seemed to regenerate as Sherlock remembered. He gritted his teeth in order to keep the visions within his mind organized, shaking his head when images of needles, maniacal laughter, crying and restraints threatened to overwhelm him. His lips moved slowly in a chant. “I must remember the day the Doctor took Daniel, nothing else just that day.”
Sherlock laughed and kissed the top of his grandma’s head. “I still do if I don’t get my way. Oh by the way I painted something for you grandmother.” Sherlock handed a brown paper wrapped package and when Sherlock’s grandma peeled the paper back, she gasped. For it was a picture of her late husband.
Sherlock hated the sad, frightened look in John’s eyes and so he jumped off the couch and ran outside into the snow. John frowned, “What is he doing?” John thought as he watched Sherlock bending over in the snow. He didn’t have long to wonder, for at that precise moment a snowball hit John on the side of the head. John jumped off the porch yelling, “I am going to get you Sherlock Holmes,” John said as he made a snowball to rival Sherlock’s. Sherlock and John played in the snow like children. They squealed with delight as they pelted each other with snowballs. John threw a couple of snowballs in the direction of the dragons and he and Sherlock oooed and awed when the dragons spurt streams of fire from their mouth. Clare watched Sherlock and John, her face expressionless. She watched as a snowball that John threw flew through the air and then as it met the dragon’s fire, it dissolved into a hot sizzling puddle at their feet. Jake came up beside Clare and for a moment neither spoke and then Jake asked a question, “Clare, does Sherlock know what is required of John?” Clare turned towards Jake, her eyes wise beyond the youthfulness of her body. “No,” she said softly.
The Asian man shook his head. “No, I am An’s brother. I don’t mean to be rude, but things are escalating quicker than expected. There was another killing in China Town last night. How long will it take you all to get ready to explore the Chislehurst caves?”
Anderson and I look at each other and then laugh. He then holds out his hand to help me up. I take it aware that Donavan is still watching us. When Anderson is convinced that I can stand he asks for my phone.
Sherlock nodded sadly, ate his rice and then prepared to get a shower. A few hours later and he and John were making their way through the snowy mountains that their companions had traveled before them. John had to constantly slow down for Sherlock, but he didn’t seem to mind as he cheerfully pretended to rest with Sherlock at each stop. As the sky darkened John stopped at a cave, “Come on Sherlock, let’s set up camp for the night.”
We are both breathing hard. I am the first to speak. “Anderson, I am impressed. I really am, you are so clever. I underestimated you.”
Sherlock licked his lips with one nervous swipe and said, “Umm, I know of a better way to relax that is umm if you want to.”
The fake assignation was to take place in the one of the darkened booths. Hugh would shoot John in the stomach with a silencer. Sherlock would scream for help and Hugh would slip away in the crowd. If per chance someone were to notice Hugh leaving, Sherlock would be his alibi. Sherlock took John’s hand as they were shown to John’s staged booth of death. After placing their order, they both waited for Hugh’s set to end. Sherlock jiggled his leg in nervous anticipation. John placed his hand on Sherlock’s thigh. “Relax, Sherlock, everything is going to be fine.” He whispered then he mouthed the words “I love you.”
“Oou, this is the exciting part. He’s reconstructing every detail in the room just as it was when he last saw it.” Irene replied in excitement watching Sherlock. John wheeled closer to Sherlock blocking Irene’s view. “Ah, how cute he’s attempting to protect his mate.” She cooed.
Sherlock resisted for a moment, then laughed and snuggled closer to John. “John, I don’t want this to be one sided, however, I’m not sure if…”
You approach us, putting a hand on each of our shoulders. “It would be nice if he could all get a bath together.”
“John, you know what I need. I’m bored. I need a case,” Sherlock snapped back, not caring how every harsh syllable cut through John’s defenses.
John handed Rosie over to Molly, then traced another errant tear that had squeezed out of a duct and down his face. “You have such beautiful cheek bones, Irene was right about that. Sherlock, I would never leave Baker Street. Why would I? It’s home. You’re family and family sticks together, right?”
Clare moved in front of Sherlock, “Sherlock, this demon is not John and why it hasn’t killed you by now is puzzlement…”
John wheeled over and took Sherlock’s hand, “Sherlock calm down, everything is fine. This man’s just doing his job.”
Then he entered the room where John lay and smiled. John returned his smile and if someone would have asked him at that very moment what heavenly body the earth revolved around, he would have to answer, John, John Hamish Watson.
“Yes, how come you never told me about this place? It’s huge and has enough supplies to last for months, perhaps years. You and Mrs. Hudson are full of surprises. When are you coming home?”
Sherlock watched in fascination as John sucked at the trickle of black blood that dripped down his thumb. “John, does your blood still taste the same?” Sherlock asked curiously.
John took Sherlock by the shoulders and shook him. “Why do you have to defile yourself like this? Sherlock, what is wrong with you?” John cried out as he took Sherlock’s pulse.
John nodded and then looked down at the ground, “Sherlock, I can’t marry you. I mean how do you expect to keep up with your active lifestyle toting a cripple around?”
“Four murders and two disappearances on this cruise line, all different genders, all different ages, all different races, all different socio-economic backgrounds. The only thing they have in common is that a black orchid was sent to each of their staterooms shortly before they were murdered or had disappeared.” Sherlock mused aloud as he drummed his fingers on his laptop and then he stopped for this case did have similarities to another case that Sherlock had solved. “Could this be a copycat?” Sherlock thought as he looked down at John’s blonde hair fear clutching at his heart, for the case could be dangerous and,” John was helpless in that wretched chair,” Sherlock thought bitterly.
“Sherlock, it’s alright you are safe. When I count to three you will open your eyes, remembering everything. One, two, three…”
I flatten myself against the wall when you walk by. Once you have left I breeze into the kitchen. “Good morning, Mrs. Hudson, how are you?”
In order to keep his mind from the exhaustive boredom and anticipation of the fighting ahead of them, John thought about Sherlock and chuckled to himself, for he knew that even though he had left Sherlock behind for his own safe keeping, he also knew that Sherlock was bound to be boiling mad. Well, he would have to make it up to Sherlock at a later date. John smiled hoping that his punishment would involve a riding crop. “God, life had been so dreary before he met Sherlock,” John thought, as he practiced defensive moves with his sword. He thought of Sherlock that first day in the lab and he inwardly smiled at the memory of Sherlock winking at him and saying, “The name’s Sherlock Holmes, 221b Baker Street.” As John continued to train, he felt a chill of foreboding pass over him, “John, you are just imagining things, for Sherlock is safe back at the village,” he thought as he thrust his sword in front of him in a virtual killing strike.
I watch you pace in the front room. Everything looks the same in the flat, but everything is vastly different. You want to forgive Mary for her dishonesty, but you can’t find it within yourself to do so.  She has lied to us yet again. “John, I don’t see the problem. So, Mary lied to you about being pregnant. It’s not as if you wanted a baby, right? I mean how would it look? Sherlock, the world’s greatest consulting detective, running around town with you and an infant strapped to your back.”
John laughed uncontrollably as Sherlock dove under the covers like an errant puppy, rustling the sheets and throwing around the blankets in disarray. John laughed until Sherlock touched his thigh. Then John’s sigh of laughter morphed into a sigh of ecstasy as Sherlock’s lips teased and seduced John into a state of aroused frenzy, thus proving Sherlock’s brilliant powers of deduction to be correct.
John wheeled his chair over to where Sherlock stood. The squeaking of the wheels put Sherlock’s teeth on edge. “I’ve got to fix that squeak. It’s a distraction…”
Sherlock looked down at John. The gurney washed out the features of his face, only his eyes seemed alive. “Sherlock, everything is going to be alright.”
“Well, it depends on what you consider illegal, Doctor Shaw. My partner and best friend John Watson has been in care for the last year. He isn’t getting better. I have determined that it is a result of inadequate medication and substandard therapy. I’ve studied your record and it is impressive. Your advances in PTSD are remarkable and new. It’s too bad you fell in love with a patient and that you had an affair with said patient and then said patient committed suicide after you lost your medical license. What a waste of a once brilliant career.”
Then he rolled up his sleeve, and injected the golden liquid into a vein. “Okay, John, your turn now.”
“Come on small warrior. Give way to the awakening that courses through your body. I will let you enjoy the pleasure for a moment before I kill you.” The Golem roared and swung the mace at John’s head.
Sherlock swallowed as he forced himself to drag his gaze away from John’s wriggling bare toes. He then looked over at Lestrade and said in a bored monotone voice; only John heard the slight tremor that made his normally dulcet tone slightly off key, “Murders aboard the cruise line that I met John on? Sounds boring, but I guess it would be a chance to go away.”
“John, my entire focus will be on you and do you know why?” Sherlock whispered as he unbuttoned his shirt. John shook his head mutely. “My focus will be entirely on you John Hamish Watson for tonight you are my case. Whatever it takes to solve you, thrill you, arouse you, whatever undoes you, whatever makes you scream in ecstasy, John that is my goal and I never lose my train of concentration,” Sherlock said softly as he undid the buttons of John’s shirt. He then reached over and turned on a small lamp by the bed, so that he could observe every expression on John’s face. He then slid in the bed next to the love of his life, sliding his hands over John’s skin until his mouth opened as he gasped for air and Sherlock marveled at the power one individual could have over another. He marveled at how John leaned into his touch. He marveled at how he was suddenly unafraid of physical intimacy as John’s hands and mouth explored his body, but most of all he marveled at the joy he felt when John became part of him, clinging to him, thrusting into him, holding him, until Sherlock’s eyes became as round as saucers as he watched John writhe in pleasure underneath him and then without warning a hurricane of sensations came at Sherlock so fast that he couldn’t analyze or compute them and then John reveled when Sherlock arched his back and screamed out begging John for release.
“A mission that was not meant for you little brother,” Mycroft says as he steps into the room. “Did you honestly think you could make a move without me?”
Then as if reading his mind, John pummeled his target again and again until they both moaning, Sherlock’s extensive vocabulary silenced, replaced with guttural grunts and whimpers.
My smile fades, making my facial muscles relax into their normal state of disuse. I roll up my sleeve. “It’s time, Molly.”
The young man looked around, anxious to be off, “Well, sir is there anything else I can do for you?” He asked and John smiled at the impetuousness of youth, for he could see that the young man’s muscles quivered urging him to move on.
“Sherlock, easy, you probably have a concussion.” John whispered gently as he took Sherlock’s pulse.
They made their way up the stairs, then he stopped before a door and knocked. “John, I have someone here to see you.” John gave them a blank stare, until he took him in his arms. “John, this is Doctor Shaw, your new therapist.” He then looked up at her with an expression in his eyes that few had witnessed—desperation. “So, can we count on you?”
“Oh my God,” John said as he thought of his friends. “Well, I thank God Sherlock is safe here.” John said aloud as he breathed a sigh of relief.
John frowned. “Well, I know one thing she was definitely attracted to me. It’s nice to know I am still desirable to someone.” John snapped spitefully.
Mrs. Hudson laughs. “Oh, Sherlock what are you up to now? Clean your own kitchen. I’m not your housekeeper. Also, if John is bringing a baby home he would never bring it here.”
Sherlock smiled at Clare sadly, “No, he won’t hurt me, my warrior, my blogger, my friend, my doctor, my love, for John is my heart, he is my soul and if darkness overtakes him, then it shall overtake me as well. We shall face it together, in for a penny in for a pound,” Sherlock said as he rang his fingers along the demon’s bubbly, rough skin. He then turned away from the group and looked the demon-John, straight in the luminous orbs that it called eyes. “John, let’s go save London, let’s go save the world, the game is on,” Sherlock shouted as he held his wrist up for the creature to take. The demon took his wrist in its claws and squeezed so tight that Sherlock gasped, for if he kept up the pressure, Sherlock’s wrist would snap like an old tree branch. As if sensing its own strength the demon relaxed its grip and then raised its claw in the air, jerking Sherlock off the ground as it did so. After it let go, Sherlock fell to the ground in a pile, he then jumped up, demanded that Jake give him his crossbow and that Clare give the demon, the cross bow that hung across her shoulder.
I hear you shout. “Mycroft, this isn’t good for him. I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want him locked up.”
Sherlock, I am not a poet or a scholar, or a genius like you, I am a soldier, so I hope you will cut me some slack as you read this letter. It is possible that you and I will not see each other again in this lifetime, so I will begin by telling you that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me and that no matter what I love you. I chose to let myself become half Yoma and I hope my sacrifice will not be in vain for I and the warriors of the city have gone to do battle against the three horsemen and their minions, the white horse of disease has already laid siege to London and the other three must be stopped, or they will destroy the earth and everything in it. Sherlock, there are so many things I cannot explain in this letter, but my heart is at ease knowing you are safe, therefore I beg you not to follow me Sherlock and know this if we do not meet again in this lifetime, know that I have been privileged to give and receive love from you.
Mycroft smiled. “No, that was my nickname for her. She was a terror, much worse than you. Her name was Sherrin Fordham Holmes.”
The rain pounded against the panes of glass that looked out onto the observation deck as Sherlock paced back and forth hour after hour, growing hurt and angry with each step he took. Around midnight a guard came over, “Sir, we’re closing. Sir?”
“Look, it’s no use our being seen together,” John said as he backed away from Sherlock. “My fiancée wouldn’t like it.”
Sherlock barely had the strength to sit up as he nodded in enthusiasm. “Yes, John, that was something new and you know how I love new.” Sherlock said slyly as he winked at John.
When Sherlock looked around, finally noticing his surroundings, it was dusk outside. “Molly, Mrs. Hudson, I’m off to see John.”
I do as you command. You look terrible. Your face is white and the skin underneath your eyes is swollen. I reach over and run my thumb along your bottom lip. “You’re dehydrated, John.”
Laura rolled her eyes, “Devin, you know how I hate that nick name. Now pay attention for our dear Doctor Watson is bored.  So, why don’t we relieve his ennui and let him play our little game?”
Sherlock grinned when he left, then concentrated on setting up a first-rate lab. On one table, lay clear lab equipment, on the other lay black lab equipment. “So, why the two different colors?” Wiggins asked.
My words are slurred. “We?” My heart leaps in my chest. There you are-John. Your face is pale, your eyes puffy. “Jesus, you are beautiful, John,” I think as I smile at you.
Sherlock looked away and then stared back into John eyes, “No, John Hamish Watson, you saved me and will continue to do so every day for the rest of our lives.” Then Sherlock clapped his hands together and said, “Come on, enough of this emotionalism, the game is on and we have  a potential case to solve.”
Sherlock was about to ask how Jake knew what boiled dog crap smelled like when everyone in the party froze. A large reptilian creature lay curled up in their path its sad eyes looked at them with indifference. “John, wait,” Sherlock shouted as John pushed himself in front of Jake. He stood before the creature studying it. After a few moments John laid his hand on the creature’s muzzle. He then turned to the rest of the party.
When Sherlock woke up the next day it must have been about noon, judging from the light the shone in through the windows. Sherlock held his head in his hands, “Jesus, what happened?” Sherlock thought and then he remembered John jabbing him in the neck with something. Just as Sherlock was about to jump up and leave the room, the Shaman came in with a servant, “Sherlock, you must rest. The headache will pass in a few hours, but until then rest.” The Shaman said as he motioned for the servant to put a cool cloth on Sherlock’s forehead.
Molly’s brow furrowed and she chewed on her nails. “Has he been to see John since he was discharged?”
The limo arrives at Mycroft’s house. You and he argue for a few moments and then you both reach an agreement. You help me out of the limo, your hands are warm on my cold skeletal frame. I love you dearest, John.  I am not sure in what context; I just know that I do.
In that moment I hate Mycroft, for I know nothing about the human heart other than its physical attributes.  The average male heart is 300 grams.
John stopped talking when he saw Sharon coming through the double doors and he shook his finger at the girls, “Now, I know why you tried to hold me here,” he said as Sharon approached him.
My body tightens as Anderson holds me. “I need another fix,” I gasp as the muscles in my neck feel as if they are going to snap.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going through turbulent waters and we request that you stay off the main decks until we navigate through the storm.” The voice was pleasant as if announcing the time of day and John scowled up at the speaker in annoyance. He was just about to wheel back to his cabin, when he heard the faint sounds of Elton John singing, “Crocodile Rock.” Though the song was upbeat and cheerful, something about the sound of the notes being torn away on wind gave John the creeps, especially when the,”La, La, La,” part of the song rang out. Then John heard a violin playing the theme from, “Romeo and Juliet,” by Nino and the sound was so sweet that it could only be Sherlock playing-his Sherlock.
I enter the room to find you taking his pulse. “We’ve got to call an ambulance. His pulse is thin and rapid.”
It is early morning when I return to Baker Street, I open the door and move to make a mad dash to my room, but Mrs. Hudson is on my trail like a blood-hound. “Sherlock, wait.”
I slap his hand away. “Of course I am you twat. Why else would I be talking to you?” I smile as I stand up and let the sheets fall where they may. Anderson’s cheeks flush as I stand naked before him. I yawn and stretch. Then I scratch my navel. “So, what do you want?” I ask in satisfaction as his eyes trail down to where my fingers have just rested. I smirk and scratch a little lower.
“John, god, John, that’s it, yes. JOHN…” His legs began to shake, when he felt John’s movements increase.  A few moments later, his trembling insides received John’s come, while his own shot on the crisp sheets beneath them. He let John roll him over on his back, then looked up into his blue eyes. “John,” he whispered.
Sherlock leaned forward in his seat. “So, Clare what brings you here? Talk and please be quick I bore easily.”
I have texted the institution. They will have a John Watson, primed for me. I walk into the lobby of my “getting off palace” and approach the front desk. Without a word I hand over your shirt and coat. Then I make my way to the proprietor’s office. I knock on the door. It is opened and I am shown into a spacious office. It is cold-sterile, all chrome and glass. The woman behind the desk smiles as she comes forward. “Well, Mr. Holmes what a pleasure. Do I take it that you are on the case?”
Tears form in my eyes as I look away from your prying gaze. “No, Molly, John’s feelings aren’t as vested in our relationship as you would think. He’ll mourn me and then he’ll move on. That’s what people do, Molly. They move on.”
“Oy, because you bloody jumped off a roof in front of him. Well, at least we know he moved on. After all you’re not a very reliable friend or lover, are you?”
They all watched Mycroft when he again pulled out his hankie, placing it over the palms of his hands and lacing his fingers together. Sherlock smiled and his eyes tinted with malice when he ground the souls of his shoes into an unidentifiable pile of muck. Trudging forward he stopped just in front of Mycroft. For a moment they stared at each other, then Sherlock looked away placing his foot into Mycroft’s interlocked hands. Mycroft sighed when Sherlock pushed off his hold, dispersing the once white handkerchief into the foul air. John watched its descent in fascination. It floated through the air, then fell to the ground expelling more mildew.
I lean back on the couch, satisfied that I made something rise in you, even if it is only your ire, it will have to do. An incoming text takes my mind off of you. I sit up, for it sounds intriguing. The institution that I visit now and then when I need to satisfy my carnal needs has a case for me. I can’t tell you about it, so I run up to my room. Once there I rim my eyes in kohl, put on a netted shirt that shows off my nipple ring. I then sneak into your room, grab your stripped shirt and one of your jackets. I put the collar of my jacket up, pull a scarf around my face and run down the stairs. Before you or Mrs. Hudson can question me I am out into the night air-alone.
Lestrade looks at me in speculation before he replies. “Well, get in there so I can send Anderson in, for I know he won’t work with you.”
You are by his side in an instant, the doctor, the friend, the lover. I note the curve of your back when you bend over him. Your shirt comes untucked revealing a bit of skin. I take a deep breath, resisting the urge to stroke myself.
