“Dunno.  You just walked back into the tiger park, carrying a casket of jewels and wearing dragon clothes.  I remember thinking, ‘Good, a bit more protection when you’ve been kidnapped.’”
John could see Lestrade’s discomfort and hurried to wrap up.  “Of the metaphorical kind, maybe.  The Chief Superintendent would've had Sherlock out on his bum ages ago if not for you.  So thanks.”
“Therefore, we need to disassociate the discipline -- including spanking, as that is oh so pleasurable -- from anger.  Isn’t that the way of discipline with children anyway?  The parent who is angry puts discipline aside to deal with later?”
“Brand me?” he asked.
“Immaterial.”
Holding John’s gaze, Sherlock resettled himself in the chair, which, with its high back and intricate carvings and very Sherlock-ish occupant, was looking more and more like a throne.  “Oh,” Sherlock continued. “I’ve looked at this the wrong way, haven’t I?  Seen but not observed.”
“I’m never letting you chat up a suspect again if that’s your idea of flirting.”  Sherlock pushed up and kissed John on the nose before falling back to the mattress again.  “Yes, I really want to do that.  With you, in particular, because I’ve deduced you would be very good at it.”
“Come.”  Sherlock patted his own thigh, and John kept himself from keening by the barest of margins.
“I’ll say.”  Now they were coming to the important bit.  John could feel the corners of his lips pulling up, purely from nerves.  Time to dive in.  “You’ve deduced who I was?”
deserve it.”
John had to pause as well.  “Hm.  I don’t know.  Carole-Moriarty’s shape kept changing from Carole to Moriarty and back again, but it seemed natural for that to be the case.  Does that happen to you in dreams?  What you’re looking at keeps flipping and you just accept it.”
Lestrade’s face drew up, and he exhaled loudly through his nose.  “Did it have anything to do with the string of robberies that’s been driving my team crazy for the last month?”
John tugged at his sleeve and wished Gemma hadn’t layered on the makeup quite so heavily.  There needed to be some, of course, for this costume of David Bowie from the ‘Life on Mars?’ video that his sister Harry and her friends had thrown together for him, but the caked-on foundation was making him sweat.  And he’d never attract a woman to win this stupid bet if he was sweating too much.
“Oh, sure; these are broad options that you and I will work through the details of as we go.  You’ll see when you hear them.  Ready?”
“Hard to imagine it.”
Not a surprise.  John knew full well that Sherlock would generally be in one of two moods after a case:  torpor or frenzy.  Torpor John could stand to have in the flat for a bit (he’d just walk around the lump), but frenzy he would often push right out the door, with a suggestion to go visit Bart’s or NSY or the guy with the dog John could never the remember the name of.  The guy, he could never remember the name of.  The dog, over whom Sherlock has waxed rhapsodic many, many times, is Toby.
“The one who was in love with him.”
that their relationship was.
With a twinkle in his eye, Lestrade was back to himself.  “It’s actually not that bad, Mycroft’s, when you get a fire going, but still, if everybody took the stay-at-home order as seriously as that, we’d be much better off overall.”
Sherlock nodded regally.  The git.
Yeah, the blighter gets to keep doing his own bloody intake.
“A --”  John’s breath caught in his throat momentarily.  “You thought I was transgender?”  At a nod from Sherlock, he went on.  “And the reason I wasn’t used to makeup was because --”
That this brilliant, remarkable man would make himself vulnerable to a rather Plain Jane like John was nothing short of amazing.  He wanted to prove himself worthy of that, and fortunately he had an idea right at hand.  “Well,” he told Sherlock, “you don't know, do you?”
“Option five.  We go on as we have been, you adopt Rosie, and you and I share a bedroom because we’re in a romantic
John moved the nurse doll down to aid the doll in the three-piece suit with the dislocated shoulder and hip.  “Uncle Mycroft, too.”
“Considerably depleted compared to what it used to be and thus in Mycroft’s iron fist, but yes.  It would cover renovation.”
John manufactured his politest smile, but the stranger barely glanced up as he took the phone from John’s hand.  “Is NHS not prioritising veterans for dysphoria services?” the man asked, sounding perturbed.
The bunny and hatter continued to glare, but Alice’s face softened.  “Oh?” she asked, cradling her left wrist with her right hand.
Those stunning eyes of Sherlock’s fixed back on John’s for a long moment.
“No!”  John took a long breath to cleanse any irritation out of his tone, as he wasn’t a misogynistic prick and didn’t want to sound like one.  “It would be fine if I was, but I’m not.”
And yet.
Soft lips touched John’s.  Sherlock laid his hand lightly on John’s left hip, mirroring the move John had made.  Mirroring was an excellent tactic for learning kissing skills, John had found out a few decades ago, and it seemed Sherlock was employing it now, following the gentle presses John made against first Sherlock’s top lip and then bottom lip with presses of his own.
“So you're a slag.”
He seems above all that.  Rarefied.  But nope, just like you and me (well, not

“And if you ever suspect I’m angry, you can stop things.”
It was awkward and awful and stretched across three days and might as well have been in an outer-space alien language for all it resembled how two British men typically talk with each other.  (Yes, they are neither of them typical, but they
It was a rollicking case, far outside London, and involved startlingly brilliant brainwork from you-know-who and a few medical insights from yours truly and multiple chases and a dead satisfying tackle of the culprit, who did not anticipate John coming in high and Sherlock low.
, I have never been attracted to any part of Irene Adler other than her mind.   Because I am attracted exclusively to men.”
Not the reaction John had expected, to say the least.  He followed Sherlock into the kitchen (and fetched himself a glass of water while he was there).  “You choose the last option?”
That wanker.
knew how to pick
“I had the weirdest dream last night,” John said to one of Mycroft’s minions, looking square into the lens of the not-as-hidden-as-was-probably-intended camera in the ground-floor foyer of 221.
“Not much, but I’ve put together the probable plot of your dream based on my knowledge of your thinking process, such as it is, and the throughline of the original documentary.”
“The one who was swept off his feet from the very beginning, dazzled by the man’s charisma and energy, and never stopped being charmed by someone others could find abrasive and over the top.”
He knew somehow that Sherlock wasn’t questioning John’s orientation so much as testing it.  Making sure John was certain of and committed to it.  Luckily, John was.  “Right.  I’m attracted to a lot of women and not a lot of men.  Still counts as bi.”
Sherlock took John’s hands in his, looked deeply into John’s eyes, and said, “Partners. I want us to be partners.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly, then seemed to catch himself and sat up straighter.  “You’re saying that…”
“Oh, that.”  After a quick wink aimed at his partner, John continued walking down their stairs in their flat to go get their daughter and start their day.  “I deduced that ages ago.”
“You must have told me.”
“So, then see, Sherlock, most people would’ve assumed John was a man, and that’s why we’re confused.”  As Sherlock opened his mouth, Mike continued, “Oh yes, you don’t assume, do you?  You make a… what do you call it?”
John opened his mouth to reply, and then realized he had no idea what to say.  “What?” he settled on.
leave my pig behind again.”
John, not finding the matter settled, not least because he had no idea what the matter was, called him back to the lounge.
“And,” Sherlock continued, “thus I feel compelled to ensure that you have everything you need.  Mary has proven herself eminently suitable, with just this one piece undetermined.  Does she use you, John?  Have you shown her how to use you?”
Fuck it, I’ll finish this tomorrow.  Sherlock actually wants to watch something on telly (it’s about poisonous snakes), and he’s actually asked me to join him, and I feel a bit of a cuddle on the couch is in order.
That was a bit of a surprise to John, not minding a bloke being cuddled up to him as he slept.  It was impossible to know if it was not minding “a bloke” or not minding Sherlock, and really that question was pretty much moot, given the small likelihood of any other man crawling into bed with John.
A wave of revulsion ran through John from head to toe.  “No!” he shouted, and then lowered his voice.  This was a conversation that no one else could hear.  “No,
Sherlock’s lips zipped shut, his eyes grew a fraction larger, and his chin dipped.  Oh, he clearly knew he deserved this!
Mike nodded; Sherlock’s face was blank.  “Who is that?”
tempted, but he bulled his way forward regardless.
the bananas out with the homeless teens, however; he saved exactly four peeled bananas in the fridge. “Two for you and two for me,” Sherlock said.
“Please do,” Mike piped in.  “A lesbian bar, you said?”
That encounter in the bar last month had been an oasis of
“Despite how --”  He couldn’t think of the proper adjective for the brothers’ relationship. “Despite how Sherlock can get, and how Mycroft can get, I know that deep down they do love each other.  Maybe even more than me and Harry.”  He thought for a moment.  “Nope, definitely more than me and Harry.  But that’s a story for another day.”
John was halfway up the stairs by the time Rosie’s joyful shriek trailed off.
After a few minutes, John pulled back. If he could see his own eyes, he was convinced there’d be stars in them.  That was a hell of a sweet, gentle first kiss.
“Maybe?” John murmured.  They were just inches away from each other now.  John put one hand on Sherlock’s hip and reached up with his other for the back of Sherlock’s neck.  Soft hair.  “I can work with that.”
I’ve finished my lager, and the shower’s just shut off, so off to bed we go, for a well-earned night’s rest.
“You are definitely a keen observer,” John replied. “I’m not bad at collecting evidence myself, though.”
“I prefer to text.”
1 - So easy a monkey with brain injury could solve it.  The prospective client gets a form email lambasting them for being an idiot and billing them 1,000 pounds for the minutes I wasted reading their email.
.  Just a bet, not a date.
“I suggest 'Vatican cameos' to mean we’ll take a pause and see whether both of us want to continue.  If not, we’ll stop.”
“Our relationship is a whole?” Sherlock asked, voice faltering, and John wished a little more light was leaking into their cocoon so he could see Sherlock’s face better.
"The bit you might find interesting is that your boss was a Las Vegas hustler whose wife would regularly invite other women to join them in bed.  Threesomes, can you believe it?  I find it hard to imagine Mycroft being anything beyond moderately cordial with one person, let alone two."
“Huh.”  John shook his head.  “I’d noticed we’d not had many cases but Sherlock didn’t say…  Well, anyway.”
“I’m brilliant at collecting evidence,” Sherlock noted.
John sat up.  “Rosie’s monitor.  I forgot to bring it upstairs.”  He climbed out of bed.
“Absolutely fine; it was just a little bug, gone in under 24 hours, but better safe than sorry when the coronavirus is about.  I should be cleared for work by next week.”
The wake-up the next morning was much slower than the go-to-sleep, as John felt truly rested for the first time in a longer time than he wants to think about.  Uni?  No, now that he considers, definitely
John felt that ‘pique’ might best describe his reaction.  “I could’ve been the lead!”
John  picked up the nurse doll and looked it over, head to toe. With a big breath, he shifted to the point of the conversation.  Well, not conversation, exactly.  More like a monologue with occasional interjection from someone else.  Bit like the blog, actually.  A
“See you then.”
“You hadn’t had a chance to try it before,” Sherlock interrupted.  “Right.”
As if Sherlock can’t strop for days when he’s in the mood!
In the end, Nixi got her remuneration and headed off home; Sherlock got loudly reminded that he’s to leave John to take care of his own sex life, thanks; and John got a blood-pressure induced headache that was relieved somewhat by the long hot bath he took and finally wiped away by the apology massage Sherlock provided after Lestrade’s case was solved.  “An
Oh, god, the kiss.  John had somehow managed to put it out of his mind, and now…  He was going to put it out of his mind again.  Yes.  “Shut it,” he said to Mike, who chuckled.
John shook his head and finished his pint.  He felt like maybe
“You have a trust fund?”  John had suspected but not known for sure.
Cha-ching!  Option five for sure.  Awesome and amazing and… perplexing.  There was still something going on with Sherlock; John was trying not to frown but he could feel his lips pulling down.  “Then--”
“Oh, you’re busy.  It’s nothing important; we can talk another time.”
“My intent was to make you so focused on demonstrating your sexual prowess that you wouldn't notice…”  He trailed off.
“You’re changing your name to Ella?”
Remember the Monty Python bit where they’re clacking coconuts and pretending they’re riding horses, and then the two guards are arguing what kind of bird would and could bring a coconut to Medieval Europe?  That’s what Sherlock and the ornithologist sounded like, back and forth until the train pulled into the station, and then we were off, running toward one of the colleges, into a lab and through it, back to a huge dusty storage room, sheets tossed over everything like they were about to start painting twenty years ago and then forgot it entirely.
“Just like in real life, but with tigers?”
“I won’t, if you wish it.  I only thought you might like to reconsider any new data before I put my findings to you.”
“From last night, certainly.”  I watched his hand spasm faintly.  “You remember last night?”
.  When I caught his lips again he kissed me back with all he could without otherwise moving a muscle.  And so I kissed him until he calmed and softened completely against me.  And then I kissed him until the shape of his lips and the taste of his mouth and the heat of his tongue were things as familiar to me as every other part of him I made a study of over the years.  And then, as he grew drowsier and more pliant still, I kissed him until he slept.
“That only one of them can be true.”
If the way he had been looking at me- the way he looked at me still- made it difficult to concentrate, that made it even worse.  It was a good thing long experience had rendered the stitching of a wound relatively second nature to me, for I might have botched things badly otherwise.  I loved every scar on his body from the times before me, as I loved every other hint of his work from the old days.  Proof both that he needed me and that, technically, he didn’t- but he seemed to want me- in some capacity, at least- all the same.  But I would not leave some ugly scar on him myself for anything.
He presented his arm for perusal and let me lift his sleeve, but seemed to only just tolerate my examination.  I missed the way he had looked at me the night before; I would certainly have drawn much needed strength from the love in his eyes.  But I knew he could not look at me like that always; it simply wasn’t possible.
“I should not wish to trouble you.”  His tone was dismissive now as he made for the door.
joyful; I might have been feeding on crumbs, but they were the finest, I fancied, any man ever knew- that three things further transpired in the case which had so changed things between us.
Holmes had huddled into the corner of the sofa- a concession, I suppose, to his altogether natural desire to be as far from me and my needle as possible- but even so there was hardly enough room for both of us there.  I tested it, all the same- stretching out along the length of the sofa, my body softly against his, my face so near that I saw every quicksilver flash of his eyes and every quirk of his lip, bitter or sweet.  He tolerated this examination for longer than I would have expected, but eventually he said, “What are you looking at?”
The third was merely a postscript to the whole matter, nearly three months after we had Captain Crocker with us at Baker Street.
“No indeed.”  His voice cracked down the middle.  I would not have thought he could be so moved- I would not have thought any of this possible only a few days ago- and I felt I should say something more.  Before I could think of anything, he robbed me of speech altogether.  He laid his hand over mine on his knee and then lifted it to his mouth.  I had had men kiss my hand in jest once or twice- but none of them were him.  None of them had seemed so keen on memorizing every sensation of skin, bone, and muscle beneath their lips.
In his normal black moods- such as a period, lasting sometimes for days, in which one of the finest minds in existence was utterly at the mercy of some painful paralysis I could not even begin to understand, could ever be called
.  No, he had dreaded it.
I could not take pleasure in the death of three men- even three criminals- but I did feel some relief, and some guilt to go along with it.  I was sure Holmes did as well.  In me, the guilt manifested as more interest in my medical practice, which had never been too robust and had dwindled since Holmes’ return, such that by then I saw only a few personal friends.
He looked a little startled, and he surprised me in turn by swallowing heavily before he lifted his glass for me, allowing me to sip without touching it.  My lips were over his as I drank.  He must have noticed.  He was watching me too closely to do otherwise.
“From this... new data, as you call it, I am afraid we may draw two different and sadly opposite conclusions.”
Hopkins’ eyes lit.  “But you may not have heard that there was another such robbery- committed by three men, and so on- also in Kent just last night.”
“When I said what, Holmes?”
“My dear Watson,” he said in a voice a trifle weaker and flatter than usual, but still the voice I loved as well as any in the world.  “I can see that you are awake.”
Holmes read aloud to me from the paper one morning that Captain Crocker’s ship had been involved in the rescue of some civilians at sea.  “It seems,” he said, “that our friend will return to his lady with many accolades.”
“Forget about it.”
“No, my dear fellow,” he said.
, and it filled me with considerable warmth.  Yet I wished there had been more
*   *   *
“I was not aware I had any new data.”
Hopkins still had questions about the silver he had found just where Holmes said it would be.  It was Holmes who suggested that it had only ever been stolen as a blind.  Though he might take it upon himself to shield those whose guilt he had uncovered, to lie outright to a policeman- especially one so promising as Hopkins- was not something which came easily to him.  Together he and Hopkins came around to the idea that the objects might have only been hidden beneath the water temporarily.  The gang might have intended to return for the fruits of their labor once all was quiet again.  The inspector liked this idea so much that my friend would have had a difficult time working him back around to the concept of a blind- and the robbery as a cover for the death and nothing more- again if he wished to.  Since he did not wish to, Hopkins went cheerfully on his way and Holmes returned to his reading of the paper.
“I don’t think that can be true.  I am looking a man who has borne such unwarranted insults far more patiently then I deserve.  I never mean it, you know.”
His eyes fluttered briefly.  “Besides the wound itself, I admit that after it was inflicted I experienced a great burst of energy when I thought I might shortly die.  The men in question have all been arrested now, at any rate.  Are you sure you would not prefer to hear how I dealt with them?  No?  Well.  Another time.  In the aftermath I felt rather as if my body had caught fire.  And my arm...”  His voice cracked very slightly.  “I saw your worry, you know.  For a while I too wondered if I might lose the use of it.  And...”
His smile sweetened.  “I believe so.”
Holmes moved again, suddenly, and perched on the foot of my bed.  “The more I think on it, the more this matchmaking grates on me, Watson.”
“I remember...”  Holmes appeared to run out of energy very suddenly.  He was near the mantle again and he leaned against it.  I wished he would lean on me instead and so got a little closer to give him the option.  He turned his face away and fixed his gaze to the wall.  “You spoke of our agreement.  You told me to forget it.”
*   *   *
I was close enough to him that it was nothing, nothing in the world even though it was everything in the world, to bring our lips together.  He was still for a moment, but then his lips moved against mine, and the whole of him shifted.  I let my hand slip from his cheek down his neck to his chest, and there I put pressure.  “Do not move,” I told him.  “I’ll not have my fine stitching ruined.”
is. Just... Before. He was on the phone. It- it wasn't clean. He hit me with his car, first."
“You may have to.” He murmured, keeping his voice low and his ears open.
There was no light in his cell- of all the myriad of complaints he had about his current situation, the all encompassing darkness should have been the least of them, surely? He was a grown man after all; not some whimpering child crying in the dark for fear of the shadows and the shapes they made, for heaven's sake. The cool, blank nothingness weighed on him heavily none the less. It felt too much like being wiped from existence, like becoming some none-being, shrouded in shades of onyx and night and beyond even the slightest hint of warmth; it was too close to death. And, by god, he was close.
After another week of silent surveilance, Sherlock could feel the urge to act crawling under his skin like ants; but still, he waited. He reported to Anthea the barest amount of details he could, and kept the rest to himself. He didn't tell her about the orphanage the Russian frequented on the weekends, or the quiet sums of money slipped to a certain soup kitchen staff member whenever the Russian felt he could afford it. He didn't inform her of anything that could possibly be used to harm any innocents. He may have become nothing more than a common murderer, but that didn't mean he didn't have his principals. And so, the time passed and Sherlock got a feel for the Russain and his routine. It was much better than the two page dossier with screen shots of locations and timestamps that he had been given on his arrival in the white winter of the Ukraine.
It took him far longer than it should to realize that he was hyperventalating; he tried to calm himself, knowing that he was expending far too much energy as it was, energy he just didn't have, and that he would likely fall unconcious if he didn't stop acting like a child and fucking calm down-
When it had finally finished, they had drug him back to his hole and slammed the door behind him, leaving him to the dark and the quiet. Selfishly, childishly, Sherlock allowed himself a few tears; it was fine, really, he was fine. He could handle this. It was just a natural release of pent up chemicals whirling around in his head; besides, he was alone, and no one would see. It was all fine.
Mycroft shifted, the two ice cubes in his drink clinking loudly, louder than they would have had any of this been real. It felt like a warning.
, but instead he murmurred that he would text it to the Angler. That awful fucking woman.
It wasn't Mycroft.
The bravado Sherlock had been feeling moments before leaked out of him, but he forced his mind to still. So far, they had been about as frightening as a low hanging doorjamb, but if they were to get truly ugly, now would be the time. And, if Sherlock were to act, it had to be while the stronger of the two was out of the room. He raked his eyes over the smaller man, noting any details he might have missed on the first time around. He noted a spot of grease high on the man's cheek- lipgloss, a girlfriend? Clearly on the outs, as she hadn't bothered to kiss him on the mouth, and the smell of sex didn't linger on him the way it did on John after he had gotten a leg over, despite the fact that the man hadn't showered before carting himself here to do god know's what-
He caught a wiff of it on the breeze, and it nearly stopped him in his tracks. Had he been followed? He cursed to himself as he zig zagged through the unfamiliar terrain of the forest, barely noting the whir of a distant helicopter.
But it wasn't enough.
“What do you know about Moriarty?”
He couldn't be certain how long it had been since he had last choked down anything close to resembling a meal, and in the days he had been in the tiny cell, he hadn't had anything to eat nor drink. Even if the room weren't too small to even crouch in, he wouldn't have been able to pull himself to his feet with how dizzy he was becoming. And oh, how very cold everything was- hateful in it's normalacy, for all that it was bound to get much, much worse. Enforced starvation, as it were, was, in fact, the least of his problems, if he was right. They hadn't done much beyond capturing him and tossing him in the small, windowless room; but that meant they were planning on something far more dangerous. Perhaps they were going to try and ransom him back to the British government?- but that seemed unlikely, especially given that he was off the books in every respect; the man he had been was dead, and he had become a non-entity, a blank page with a gun.
Sherlock only realized he had fallen asleep when he was awoken with a bucket of water tossed in his face. He gasped and struggled upright, only to be captured by the meaty fists of his tormenters locking around his biceps once more.
As well as he expected- no matter how injured, how
The next few hours were spent curled into a miserable ball in his cage, the pain of his swollen mouth keeping him from sleeping in a hellish sort of demimonde; not enough pain to pass out, but too much to do anything other than suffer. Sherlock felt that that might be a sort of metaphor for his entire life, up to a point. He pressed his blazing cheeks to the filthy floor, relishing the cold against the throb of his mouth, and seethed. How asinine he had been. How utterly, magnificently naieve. He wasn't just being an idiot, he wasn't thinking- of the two, the latter was the worst insult he could think of.
“I know.” Sherlock replied, and he swallowed and swallowed and swallowed.
Now that the two men weren't bracketed by blinding light or busy dragging him all about creation, he could visibly confirm his earlier deductions about them. He was right on the nose as to their heights and weight (the smaller one may have been slightly leaner than he had previously assumed, but he hadn't been able to see how heavy the bag he had been carrying was with sound alone- he was brilliant, but he wasn't psychic), and from what he saw of their pant legs and shoes earlier, combined with the full picture, he felt he had a decent grip on the two as people. Awful, murdery, torturing people, to be certain, but people none the less- and people had weaknesses.
“Whatever happened to one week?”
The door opened.
Pride was another luxury he couldn't afford.
, he would argue, much like a child who didn't understand the world just yet,
if he didn't get out of that hut soon.
“You simply cannot keep ringing whenever-”
Mycroft shook him three times in quick succesion, before releasing him with a grunt and tossing his hands in the air. Three minutes.
There was a beat of silence.
“Indeed.” Sherlock replied, spotting the river. He vassilated for a moment, before fishing his gun out, followed by the silencer and slipped them beneath the icy waves of the rushing water.
Later, in the helicopter, when Sherlock was wiping the blood off his face and neck and a medic had stitched up what could be stitched and applied medicine to what couldn't, Sherlock couldn't resist asking.
Sherlock smiled and waited for the morphine to kick in. He was going home.
“Helicopter.” Mycroft answered, nodding to the men and pressing to the wall on the side of the door.
Sherlock felt like spitting in the man's face, but instead he affected a look of hopeful terror and nodded with all of his might. The man laughed, then motioned for the bigger man to bind him to the floor instead of the ceiling. Ivan, Sherlock thought. The smaller man had called him that the day before- something to remember, at the very least. It was good to put a name to a face.
But god, was he tired. A few weeks had turned to a few months, had turned into two years. Or was it three? He couldn't remember. He was too dizzy for that. The dizziness- was it from blood volume loss, or perhaps something more mundane, like forgetting a few too many meals? He couldn't recall. He was just too damn tired. At least the biting cold would stymie the blood flow, so there was that. A small silver lining.
“You think you are going to fool me with this shit, eh? You think I am some fool?” Mycroft paced, before crowding into Sherlock's space again. He flinched backwards, dragging his shoulders up by his ear and catching the slim metal rod between his shoulder and cheek. Mycroft grabbed him by the opposite ear and wrenched him up, allowing Sherlock to curl further inward on himself. There. The rod slipped into his sleeve. He writhed as if in pain, moving it to the bend of his elbow. Almost, almost.
“Oh, you stupid,
It was less than an hour later that he revised his previous opinon. They had dragged him by his arms, their hands an unbreakable manacle wrapped around each bicep as they carted him through winding tunnels. Sherlock had the presence of mind to memorize the route they had taken, and all doorways were thoroghly disected by his knowing gaze (that's another cell, there's a latrine, a shower, a breakroom that was filled with the stench of cigarettes and cheap libations); it was quite obvious he was underground, from the layout and lack of windows, to the caged lights on the walls, yellowed with age. Perhaps this had once been mining quarters, or a nucular fallout shelter- at any rate, it did make the situation far more dire. There would be no filching a phone and messaging Mycroft; there would be no reception in this cess pit. If you haven't heard from me in a week...
The dancing one seemed to be excited, judging by his goodnatured, glib reply and his odd half dance down the empty hallway. Sherlock rather thought that whatever had the smaller man in such a good mood didn't bode well for him at all; the jingling of the tool bag drew nearer. Sherlock swallowed, then scooted back on his rump back to the matress and covered his eyes so as not to be blinded if and when they opened the door. He didn't have to wait long.
The smaller of the two men dropped his bag on a low table, not far from the dangling chains, and began to neatly lay out gleaming tools; no doubt in an attempt to intimidate Sherlock as a form of psychological warfare, to heighten his fear, making the act itself worse, in the long run. It, unfortunately, was working rather well. Sherlock took a careful breath, then another and another, until he was no longer on the verge of unconciousness... more or less. The drumming of his heart slowed as he breathed, and he struggled to find something, anything to work in his favor; he carefully did not look at the table.
Sherlock sighed this time, rubbing his shaking hand over his brow.
Were you the man who killed Kratidese?
“He's a

. He fished out his phone, ignoring the messages ("Hawk?", then a few minutes later, "Ostritch."), instead, pressing the number's to his brother's direct line by memory. Mycroft picked up on the first ring.

"Why in god's name didn't you tell the Angler?" Mycroft broke in, quietly seething. Sherlock tried not to feel like a child being reprimanded. It was, so far, a spectacular failure. Another to add to his list, he supposed.
Sherlock had eventually settled on a quick and dirty plan- a silencer, the key card, and a quick run to his hut. He would shoot as soon as the Russian got to the eye piece, open the door to confirm the kill, then leave and dispose of the gun in the river near to his shack. Afterwards, he would text Anthea and meet up at the rendevous point, and then.
There was, of course, no usual place. He didn't know his extraction plans until he got them. Anthea controlled all of it, away from any prying eyes. It was need only information, and neither he, nor Mycroft were privvy to them. Anthea, being the paranoid MI6 agent she was, most likely didn't even tell her combat team the information.
Kratidese drew long pulls off his cigar, waiting for his limo, no doubt. Or perhaps something else. Whatever it was, he didn't see Sherlock, of that he was certain. Sherlock was roughing it, dirty and disheveled as he had ever been, hair long enough that when he bathed, it brushed at the soft flesh beneath his shoulder blades. What he wouldn't give for a hot shower- or better yet, a bath; a long soak to ease his sore, trembling muscles. But even if he had managed to finish up the last two names on his list tonight, that wouldn't be possible. There were his stitches from the name before Kratidese- the man had tried to run Sherlock over with his Bently, the
The perfume on the breeze grew stronger, along with the musty scent of sweat. Whoever it was must be very close indeed. Perhaps he could stage an ambush? He ducked behind a tree, breathing heavily. There was no time! Where could he run, where could he hide? It all had gone so badly so quickly. He had charted out an escape route beforehand, of course he had, but it was all rather useless with Anthea out of the picture, wasn't it? Stupid,
Sherlock awoke later that night to gunshots. He raised himself as far as he was capable, wincing as the scabs on his back cracked and stretched, and listened. One shot, then silence. He waited for something else, anything else, telling himself he wasn't hoping for any sort of outcome, that he wasn't actively imagining Mycroft swarming this hellhole with agents armed to the teeth and that he would soon be free, finally, finally, free-
The smaller man was tricky, even Sherlock had to admit. On face value, he had very little in the area of tells; his face was carefully bland and partially obscurred by a thining beard, and his clothes, while not threadbare, were clearly worn and a cheap brand. His hands were hidden by leather gloves, but the creasing patterns showed he had held several slim objects for long enough a time that the leather was forever marked. The tan hide of the gloves had also been scrubbed, and smelt faintly of industrial bleach. That, in itself, was telling. He was the torturer then. No wonder he had been so excited. His boots weren't nearly as clean as the rest of him, splattered with mud and had woodchips stuck in the grooves; (carpentry as a hobby? No, he wouldn't have the patience for it- look how he's practically vibrating out of his skin right now. Need more data.), but for all the man's blank facade, there were chinks in it, chinks that Sherlock could see, could pull at- things that Sherlock could use.
no, that wouldn't work at all. What was he thinking? That was a trope out of one of John's terrible spy movies. The man was Mafia for christ's sake. No, no, he would have to be subtler-
He made his way back to his hut.
“Who?”
boy,” Mycroft breathed, voice low.
}), he had gotten his riches the hard way. The hardest way.
The taller one had the tell tale scars of a brawler or a bouncer, but none of the finess one would need for fine tuned torture, as it were. The hairs on his pants legs showed he had two small dogs (wirey fur; terrirer?), the spots of unshaven hair behind his ears and in the rolls of the back of his neck showed he was unmarried, and the loose sole of his left shoe showed he had a gambling problem. The drinking problem was probably a result of the gambling, or perhaps the other way around? He had wise eyes, however, and that made Sherlock pause; smart enough that doing anything risky while he was in the room was inadvisable. Another thing was clear, by looking at him, at his dialated pupils and quickened breath- this man, he liked to watch. Sherlock repressed a shiver.
He had never been so glad to see him in his life, truly. What happened to letting me go after a week, brother mine? Sherlock thought with more gratitude than he thought he had in him. He could have danced. He was so elated, that he didn't mind the first hour of the pipe. Or the next. By the time it was nearing the fourth hour, he was starting to get a little peeved, to be sure. But, he was going to live, to go home- a little lead pipe on his back was worth it, wasn't it?
"Not... by the Russian." He offered. He lit his cigarette and took a drag.
The reply felt like a physical blow. If it hadn't been the Armenian after all- then
All the better for a hitman, he supposed.
All that was left was for him to take it.
“So, my boss- well, let's just say my boss's boss, wants you in one piece, more or less.” The man sighed, lips pursed in a moue of petulance. “Which takes a lot of fun off the table, but that doesn't mean I can't get creative, now does it?”
Sherlock hummed in agreement, stubbing out the last of his cigarrete in the snow and pocketing the filter for later disposal. Mycroft rung off, leaving Sherlock alone with his guilt. He dallied for a few moments, before texting Anthea the address to the nursing home. He slid the phone into his pocket without looking at it, hating himself just that little bit more, and lit another cigarette. It was going to be a long night.
“He's dead.”  Sherlock spat, his Russian coming out immpeciably despite his missing molars, and wrinkling his nose in disgust at the mere mention of the Spider's name. The thin man blinked owlishly for a moment, then threw back his head and laughed and laughed and laughed. Sherlock untwisted his mouth and stared. Once the man had finished, he wiped fake tears from his eyes.

-but no, the larger man had the keys, Sherlock knew this, of course he knew this, but he still hoped, hadn't he, because if he was busy hoping and thinking then he wouldn't have to pay attention, now would he? He wouldn't have to see oh god, are those bloody pliers?
The bigger man and the smaller one exchanged a few quiet words that Sherlock couldn't quite make out, but that had included the words, “play”, “not yet”, and, perhaps most worrisome, “tenderize the meat”. Then, the brute who had likened him to a sort of rabbit, began punching him. It was all very... cliché, really. Sherlock was a little irked at himself for getting so worked up; perhaps the items on the table wouldn't be used at all. It certainly seemed that he had given this criminal duo more credit than they deserved. Perhaps the Russian he had shot was their proper torturer, and this was an understudy? Whatever the case, Sherlock was more than capable of handling a miserly beating.

The questions they asked, were of course, unanswerable for Sherlock, which meant he spent a good portion of the next few hours with his head underwater.

According to his dress (rich suit, shining oxford leather shoes, extravagant fur-lined coat), he was richer than what a simple meat butcher should be (a butcher!

. His bearded face couldn't hide the nasty scar through his lips, turning the thin, pale things into a permanent sneer; it was the scar that led Sherlock to him. Too noticeable to hide. He was called Kratidese, which Sherlock rather thought sounded like a particularly vicious curse. His hands were as big as boxing gloves.
Sometimes, though, he couldn't help it- the thoughts came unbidden, like a creature in the night stalking some unsuspecting prey. Thoughts like,
“Soon.”
No code. No mention of confirmaton. None of the usual replies he had become so accustomed to in his years of clandestine shadow work. As a test, he thumbed out the reply.
Sorry about the weird font problem! Reuploading to try and fix it. for those of you who haven't read this chapter last time I tried to upload it, some depictions of torture within, and this is where I start diverging from canon. I'm not gonna rehash all of s3, just putting in some backstory for the plot. Hope you enjoy!
“And you? Are you not?” His brother replied, raising an eyebrow. He was, of course, referring to Sherlock's own words to Irene Addler, after all the mess she had brought behind her had dissovled like so much smoke. Sentiment, a defect found on the losing side. Sherlock found he couldn't respond, so instead he looked into the flames of the fireplace that looked so similar to the one in 221B; a momento of home. When he finally had the courage to look up, his brother was long gone, with only the ring of moisture from his glass left behind.
He tossed the stone at the dense ivy he had piled on the shack, praying for it to strike wood. He, for the first time that night, got lucky. The resounding crack was enough to get the cabin found, and enough like movement inside to tempt a single soldier into opening the door.
“No, don't tell me.” Mycroft responded quickly. “This

He used everything he had learned about the slim man, with his little patience and cheating girlfriend to get him out of the room, if only for five bloody minutes-
He didn't need to deduce which room was the torture chamber, as it were- the stench was deduction enough. It hit him when they were still three rooms down the hall from it; it was a wall of blood, sweat, piss and shit, a foul and malignant odour that was strong enough to have been a physical thing. He had been stoic up to that point, wordlessly appraising his surroundings and allowing himself to be half carried, half drug through the empty corridors, but that smell. It triggered something animalistic in him, some deep seated need to get away, as if he were a lamb to the slaughter- as if he were prey. He began to struggle mindlessly against his captors, drawing laughs from the two men as he tried to dig his heels into the worn concrete beneath his feet, tried to yank free from their hands, tried to do anything, anything at all to get away.
), he made his escape quietly and assuredly. He didn't bother mulling over it, letting the niggling sensation fade to the back of his mind palace; still something in him told him to mention it to Anthea. He let out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding as he thumbed out a text.
What were your plans, before you got caught?
Two minutes.
“I'm ditching the phone. I'll find a way to contact you within the week. If not...” He trailed off, but his meaning was clear. He swallowed past a lump in his throat. “You'll take care of him, yes?”
It was the middle of the next week before a decent opportunity presented itself.
Anthea contacted him well after five that morning, the two words in her terse text weighing on his chest.
Mycroft grabbed him by the shirt front and hauled him in the air, finally allowing the lock pick to slide into Sherlock's waiting hand. He raised his fist to strike, then- another gunshot, and the mafia thug fell. Sherlock heard faint sounds of gunfire in the distance.

And it worked.
Who do you work for?
He allowed small bits of the bread between sips, tearing strips off of the roll and dunking them liberally in the soup to avoid chewing altogether. It was a working process. Any piece of veg he came across, he mushed to the roof of his mouth with his tongue, then swallowed as best he could and little by little, the bowl was drained. He didn't feel the slightest twinge of embarassment when licking the dredges of the bowl like a dog- his pride had no place here, really.
And in a way, it was.
“Moran? He's a ghost in the wind. It's done.”

“It depends,” the smaller man answered, a smile beginning to stretch across his face, “on how long you take.”
"The last one- the Armenian."
[Hawk.]
“Aw, it looks like our little rabbit is having a tough time, eh, Ivan?” The smaller one laughed, prodded at Sherlock's bruised side. He groaned, limbs twitching, before falling still.
“Are you alright to stand, brother mine?” Mycroft said, shooting out the two cameras lurking in the corners of the room.
“And the last name on our list?” Sherlock slurred, his eyelids weighed down with narcotics and too long without sleep.
It took her nearly another hour to reply, the weak light of dawn starting to push away the boundary of darkness from his shack in the wilderness of the Ukraine. The soft buzz of his phone against the carton of cigarettes he had nicked nearly startled him into dropping the needle he was using to repair his stitches, and he quickly tied off the knot and snipped away the excess thread, before picking it up and reading the message.
and are
“You know how this works, yes? I aks you questions, and if I don't like your answers...” He trailed off with a shrug. Sherlock nodded, though it wouldn't make much of a difference. He didn't have the answers that the man would like, and the answers he did have would mean death for those he cared about if he was foolish enough to spill the beans. It was going to be a very trying next few hours indeed.
“Address,

There was no one in that direction, thankfully, so he carefully directed his eyes to the departing limo, making sure to peek from beneath his lashes, and through his hair for safe measure. Obfuscation was better than decapitation, by any means. He had a moment to watch the car come to a turn, then take a left before it disappeared.
arrested, they will be eager to disavow the Abbey Grange crime, as that would be a hanging job.”  It went unsaid between us that if Hopkins did not believe them, Holmes might have to act.
“You?  Lack courage?  Never.”  I could tell that Holmes was buying himself time with that remark, but that did not undermine the absolute conviction in his voice.
Holmes, I knew, would not take it further.  If lying to the police, even by omission, was difficult for him however noble the cause, then to push Hopkins in a direction he knew to be wrong would be much worse.  I said, “If it had been some other housebreakers- these new men or others not yet known to the Yard- at the Abbey Grange that night, it would explain why that crime was committed so close to an earlier one.”
"I thought he was-"
[The usual place.]
“Feeling up for a bit of a chat?” The small man chirped, his glaringly sunny disposition at odds with the tools he was holding. When Sherlock's eyes fell on the pliers, the man shook them at his paling face and winked co-conspiratorily.
The next week, Anthea texted him one word.
“Please,” he mock begged, not flinching when he felt something metal slipping behind his ear, just below where Mycroft's hand was still lodged in his hair, “I know nothing, I swear it to you. I am just the middle man.”
Sherlock made a note of it, because it might be useful. When the man had pulled the belt from his waist and judiciously applied it to the swelling of his shoulder blades, he seemed to be taking out his frustrations on Sherlock's back; though the skin had split and ruptured in several places, it was worth it for more information of his captors. He kept telling himself that as blow after blow landed, until he had screamed himself hoarse.
-and the bulge in the man's pocket might have been a phone, or if Sherlock was very, very lucky, they could be the keys-
He had forgotten how draining it felt, having a full stomach. He felt weighed down, like an anchor skimming the bottom of an endless ocean. He rarely afforded himself the chance, even before the Fall; his relationship with food had always been tenuous at best, and he'd be lying if it didn't chafe a bit, even now, being slowed down inexorably by the food in his stomach. But there was nothing for it; he had no clue when his next meal would be coming.
was plagueing him, he could still recognize a mob member. He still had that much presense of mind, at least. The Russian mafia, to be specific- it wasn't a very hard deduction. The coloring, the rough consonants; it all added up. It didn't, however, make it any easier. He had hoped, oh he had hoped, that for once things wouldn't get over complicated as he boarded a plane for the Ukraine. Worse than just complicated, this was going to be
, Sherlock's thoughts sung. He had filched a key weeks before, before the limo had turned left, almost before the Russian had checked in. The conciere hadn't noticed until much later that the master key had gone missing. Sherlock had checked it on an empty room earlier that day, after stealing in through an unwatched fire exit, and the staff hadn't bothered to replace the Master Code. He had the proverbial keys to the kingdom. All that was left was the act itself.
Then back to London, to the last name on the list, and John's open smile.
Mycroft said, deliberately indifferent. Sherlock heard the double meaning, clearly- You're reinstated, for now, but there are hoops you will have to jump through.
He clenched his fists to stop them from shaking, and held his needle over the flame of his little candle to sterilize it, then set about rethredding the needle. He splashed a bit of vodka over the jagged cut zig zagging it's way up his side with a hiss, then, after small bit of hesitation, downed the rest of it. Then he set to work stitching himself back together again.
Of course he had been followed, because
That was all he needed.

Kratidese's limo pulled up, as Sherlock knew it would; it shielded him from viewing the man duck in, but when the engine grumbled and the thing pulled off, Kratidese was gone. Sherlock, though, being fastidious, looked the other way first when he crawled out of his box in the alleyway. He had made that mistake too- it was one of a depressingly long list of mistakes he had made, his carelessness nearly getting him killed more often than not. It also, most likely, had been part of why this list was taking so very long.
, with the American, she-”
His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it, keeping his eye on his prey. He wouldn't be making that mistake again.
Still, there were some worrying aspects. The Russian was armed at all times, the telltale bulge of the gun hidden well, but not well enough to fool Sherlock. He was also rarely alone. Four men, on most days, swarmed around him, peering at any and all passerbys as if they would attack at any moment. Clearly, they were alerted to a threat- Sherlock hoped it was something trivial, like a turf dispute or perhaps even another hit against the man that had them so preoccupied. If it weren't, and the true reason was more nefarious than the normal goings on of a small criminal empire, then Sherlock would undoubtably be removed. He wasn't certain what would happen them, but his instincts told him that it was nothing good.
[It's done.]
But, Mycroft, they know where I've been staying.”
Mycroft inhaled a sharp breath through his teeth.
The room was small, not quite as small as his cage, but small none the less. There were shackles bolted to the floor and ceiling, chains dangling in the stale air. Bloodied hay was spread methodically throughout the room, soaking up the worst of the stench and the fluids from his predecesors- easy to clean and dispose of. Maybe they weren't so amateurish after all. Somehow, this thought brought him no comfort, and as they shackled him to the dangling chains, he tried with all his might to affect a mask of indifference.
He lit another cigarette, ignoring the burn in his throat, and the harsh beating of his heart as he typed his reply.
Go time.
The response took less than a second, and sent his stomach tumbling to his feet.
"You are
And it was, for the first ten minutes or so.
The next week, the Russian had resumed his normal routine, but the Angler was still pouring through the CCTV records, trying to parse why they had gone to the Mafia's head quarter's that night, and wouldn't allow Sherlock back on the streets. “Ostritch”, she said.
, and, most often,

When they bound him with his arms up again, Sherlock had to use all of his considerable acting skills to not give the game away, not let the smaller man realize who sat in front of him, bundled in furs and cigar smoke.
. Though the first two were perilous, terrifying things that would circle in his head like sharks, it was the last that left him weak and trembling- because, as ruthless as Sherlock is with himself, it was the one with the highest probability. He had faked his death in front of John. He had watched him, crying in that graveyard and walked away, knowing his death was killing John.
Sherlock didn't bother with a snarky reply. He instead fished in his pockets for a cigarette, trying to ignore how his fingers trembled. Mycroft blew out a low sigh, the sound of his chair squeaking as he settled back into it tinny and distorted.
, nearly there) on his little list.
[And?]
“Take care.” Mycroft intoned with all the solemnity of a soldier on his death bed. Sherlock couldn't reply, so he simply hung up the phone. He slipped the battery from the back, and then the SIM card. He smashed the sim to tiny shreds of microfibers, then paid the same attention to his phone. Once it was an unrecongizeable blob of wires and electric acutrement, he slipped the lot beneath the water and watched it flow downstream, out of sight.
He pressed a shaking fist to the hole in his side, feeling the red rivulets of warm blood drip over his fingers. He grimaced, wiping his hands roughly on his bedraggled pants. Their dark color should hide the stains (for now) but the ripped stitches did pose an immediate problem, he had to admit. He couldn't afford to leave any trace, any careless bit of himself, here.
So he did. He sat in his hovel and ate tasteless military rations and slept when he could and was going to lose his fucking
meant to be phoning me directly-"
A clang in the distance. Footsteps; heavy, left shoe scraping against the concrete floor. Were they back for him already? Unease coalesed into his stomach, a frigid lump of malaise twining with his lower intestine. But, instead of hearing the jingle of keys and the click of the lock turning over, instead there was a scraping noise of metal on concrete, then a small opening at the bottom of the door, flooding the tiny room in light. Sherlock blinked before pulling himself to a sitting position, watching warily as the man's knees came into view, and then-
Then, after exactly ten minutes, the brute stepped back and wiped his bloody knuckles on a cloth the smaller man provided with a smirk. Sherlock felt something nervous flutter in his stomach, like a jittery bird.
Sherlock timed his retreat with the boom of the trap he had set, hoping that the noise and confusion would be enough to cover his escape, and he was very nearly right.
He had to improvise, before the smaller man came back- there was not way he could transfer the lock pick like thing. So, he did what he could- he headbutted Mycroft in the nose. Mycroft staggered back, like a reeling fish, then roared just as the door opened again to reveal three men in suits. Two, Sherlock recognized, one he didn't.
Or so he thought.
- and stitches this fresh couldn't be soaked for a goodly period of time. Then, there was the debriefing. And paperwork. After all this time, he still despised paperwork, but he had gotten better at it. Suprising what being dead could do to a man.
“So, I was thinking, why not start with something small? Something you won't even miss if you're as valuable as my boss's boss thinks you are. Won't that be a laugh?”
The smaller man placed a large basin of water in front of Sherlock as Ivan securd his arms to a u-shaped metal protrusion in the floor, then cracked his knuckles. Sherlock knew where this was going, and it wasn't very good for him, but that was something of a pattern of late. He made note to inhale as little water as possible; in his weakened and malnurished state, if he contracted pnuemonia, it would be the end of him.
“Well, it's not like the misses was going to use this anytime soon anyways.” He had muttered, then softer, to himself. “At least not with me.”
no. He wasn't sure he could effectively hide the stitches and molted bruises along his side, wasn't sure he could even convince the man to take him upstairs; he hadn't seen the man with any partners, so-
Not long after, it became clear he would have to make his own opening.
How much do you know about our operations?
Fifteen minutes. That wasn't a hell of a lot of time to do any preperations. All of his files were there, all of his information; he had to get it before the person imitating Anthea got there and used it to their own ends. He ran, ignoring the stitch in his side, but keeping to the back alleys and residential roads that were more or less abandoned. As he ran, he dialed Mycroft's number, holding the flip phone between his shoulder and cheek as he hopped over fences and filth tinged snow drifts. Mycroft picked up on the third ring.
“Little frightened rabbit, struggling will do you no good, yes?” The drunken man's breath washed over his face, mixing with the putrescence of the room and making Sherlock gag. The man purred, his Russian turned low and soft, a weapon in of itself. Sherlock pried his eyes open (when had he closed them? He couldn't afford to close them, he had to see, he had to know-) and fought the panic welling up in his throat.
} and inner palm {
There were over a dozen men approaching his hut, but luckily none had spotted it yet. Sherlock sucked in a slow breath, and thanked his lucky stars that he had been prepared for all contingencies before making his move. The nestled gas containers by the front door were all the accelerant he needed. All he had to do now was to strike the proverbial match. He held a rock that he had pried loose from the river's edge, brushing his thumb over the surface as he shivered in the cold. He had stripped off his old clothes at the river's edge and had donned a new outfit he had filched and stored near the river for this eventuality. Then he had scattered the old clothes as far as he possibly could afford to travel in the woods, to throw off his scent. And it was a good thing he had. They jangling of dog collars was loud in the otherwise silent forest.
“Well, this was more of a introduction anyhow.” He grabbed a handful of Sherlock's hair, dragging his head upright as he smiled that bland smile he had first worn- his eyes, though. His eyes burned. “Tomorrow, little rabbit, the real fun begins.”
. His nostrils filled with the perfume as a woman's laugh filled his ears, and pain slammed into the back of his head- then the world went dark.
And it was true that, the moment he saw how affected I was, Holmes’ manner grew more even.  His look turned very kind.  He leaned just a little closer, let his hand come to rest on my knee as mine had on his that night, months ago, when I misunderstood him so completely.  His touch burned.  How could he not know?  The question rang stubbornly in my mind even now that he had been so good as to give me the answer.  I laid my hand over his and gripped him tightly.
“The inferences are either reinforced by any new information, or they are not.”
“Ineffectual, aren’t they?”  Holmes’ tone was dry.
His eyes held mine very seriously, and it flooded through me like ice water that Holmes had not failed to observe me after all, and that I might not have heedlessly stumbled out onto dangerous ground but, rather, followed him there as I would follow him anywhere.  For a moment, suspicion ran rampant in me.  That he was trying to trap me, that I would shortly be ejected from Baker Street with nothing but a bag and a broken heart, that all this pretext was nothing but a cruel trick.  It was in this humor that I attempted to debate him as if we were still having an abstract conversation about love, and not my very life.  “Such feelings, as you term them, might not be so easily found out as that,” I said.  “They are not... the dirt beneath a gravedigger’s fingernails which announce his occupation.”
That, I thought as I finished clearing up and finally felt myself tired enough to sit down, was what I couldn’t believe.  Like Holmes on a case I understood what must have happened well enough now, but a few points of motive still eluded me, and only one person could explain.  I sat on the chair opposite the sofa and regarded that person as he slept.  It seemed to me impossible that I lived in a world where Sherlock Holmes believed I was not his, body and soul.  Certainly I had meant to hide the strength and precise nature of my regard; evidently I had succeeded.  But certainly there was also breadth enough of difference between his not seeing- as I had long been afraid he would- in every look that I loved him, and his thinking it was impossible.  For how could the most brilliant man I knew believe it?  Surely even the most foolish of men, looking at that stunning face, considering that remarkable intellect, and standing in awe of that great soul, would know that Holmes could have anyone he desired in a heartbeat, including me.  Especially me.
“No?”  I had known Holmes to look impatient when I told him I did not understand something, and to look amused, and to look tired- as if he was keenly aware that his observations were beyond most men and that, in those moments, he was as weary of being different as anyone.  The expression he wore just then was a little of all of them, but mostly it was gentle, if a little melancholy.  “Let me see.  You must know if not firsthand than certainly second that having stitches put in without anesthetic is a curious sensation.”
“Is there a reason I should not?  I drank only a little and the injury, you recall, was to my arm- not my head.”
“I am glad of it,” I replied, though indeed I only spared a few thoughts for either of them.  By then the matter- however much it had sculpted relations between my friend and myself- had slipped from my mind almost altogether.  It would hardly have captured my memory at all, in fact, had Holmes not mentioned it directly before a much more profound- and violent- reordering of our lives at Baker Street occurred.
to see, precisely, but certainly what I anticipated.  Everything was twisted to fit the form I had already imagined in my mind.  That was, as Holmes always said, the trouble with personal investment in a problem.  I would not trade this particular investment for anything, and I hoped Holmes felt same, but nevertheless it was so.
Holmes took a pull on his cigarette.  I was not immediately sure if I was moving in the right direction or not.  But then he leaned forward with some interest on his face, and that was something.  “His failure to observe her love for him, you mean?  And to make a proposition which might have saved them both some suffering?”  Just as suddenly he sat back again and looked tired.  “Do you have a theory as to why he did not try?”
I watched as he unfolded his arms and lit a cigarette.  In his hands and in his eyes I saw a tension different from the night before.  Then I had been reminded of his behavior while on a case he thought might be hopeless, all grim energy and sharp determination.  Now I was reminded of his behavior on a case that was not hopeless as such, but nevertheless out of his hands.  He was waiting, as he always waited when he had done his utmost and knew what happened next would be determined by another.  Usually what he awaited was a criminal’s mistake.  Today what he awaited seemed to be me, and that sent a thrill through me which might have been pleasure, but if it was, it was the sort of pleasure not readily distinguishable from fear.
He was not eating.  “It’s not the inspector that troubles you, though, is it?” I said.  Holmes had not eaten even before Hopkins arrived.  I sat back in my chair, considered him a while, and finally resolved to return to our aborted conversation of last night.  “It’s this pair of lovers.”
This was a problem I had not foreseen but should have.  I so rarely discussed the softer emotions with Holmes that I did not take the ground beneath my feet for quicksand until it was too late.  I had got too near a subject too close to my heart.  I knew all about advances that could not be rebuffed because they had not been made, and to discuss the subject with Holmes- all as if it were a new treatise on botany which was of interest to him- was remarkably dangerous.
“Why would I do that?” I asked, when his hand- which gripped me in turn with equal strength- had grounded me enough to manage it.
involved in the actual business, enough that I might be the one bleeding and he the one whole.
After a while, I managed, “Oh.”  And then, “My dear Holmes.  I do not know if I should be offended or not.”
He smiled again, and kissed me.
Holmes froze and hissed softly.  The hiss reminded me strongly of a goose, and it would have been amusing if the line of his back was not so painfully straight.  I felt I had unknowingly got to the crux of something, but because it was unknowing I felt no better informed than I had before I reached it at all.  “Goodnight, Watson,” he said gently.  He opened the door- the light beyond caught briefly on his hair- and then he was gone.
“Why did you argue with Mrs. Hudson?” I asked.  That lady, who I had sent to bed once I arrived, had seemed unusually unequipped to argue with either of us.
to do something else.  “Valued indeed."  he swallowed.  "So.  Friend will do," he added in such a low voice that he seemed to be testing out the idea in his own mind more than putting it to me.
I did not know how to respond, so I did not.  I focused on my work.  I was as careful as I have ever been in my life.  Even annoyed with him I could not be otherwise.  I was aware as I worked of his eyes on me.  When I finally mustered the courage meet them, I do not know what I thought I would see.  Him watching me like a hawk for some sign that I was so intoxicated by his nearness that his pain was not enough to keep me from becoming aroused, possibly.  If so I was disappointed, because instead I saw... I didn’t know what I saw.  The expression on his face... “It is very difficult to concentrate with you looking at me like that,” I said.
I had been with a patient who keeled over in his club for most of the afternoon.  It was beginning to be dusk when a message arrived summoning me instantly to Baker Street.  It had long been Holmes’ habit to call upon me just the same in circumstances both grave and trivial, and I can honestly say that the trivial calls never made me fail to anticipate the grave ones.  I did not linger in the club, therefore- and when I saw Mrs. Hudson’s face I was heartily glad of it.
