The three of them shared an uncertain look. “That… certainly makes things easier for us”, Dean said, stepping through.
“Well, reality is safe. You can get out now, right?” the Shadow asked, making a gesture for them to leave with its hands.
He tumbled out of the room, faster than his legs would allow him, towards his bedroom. Eileen was almost knocked out on her ass by Hurricane Dean as she came out of her room – well, Sam’s room, rather, but there was very little difference.
”, he corrected. “We’ve been relocating people, providing food supplies, helping during the full moon… we started out on Kansas City, cleaning up the mess Michael left, but Garth’s been getting in contact with some people he knows, and I got in touch with Mia, that grief counselor we met… We’re trying to figure out ways we can help each other thrive, even studying the possibility of using vampirism or lycanthropy as a way of curing disease, providing the person takes the cure right after…”
”, Amara cleared her throat. “That she is doing a fairly good job, keeping Hell in line – so you better fall in line as well. Understood?”
“I was in a memory with your father, yeah, but… I never found him here. After everything, I’m not really sure he
are”, Charlie corrected, stepping forward. She kicked Ash’s couch on the way. “Wake up, sleepyhead.”
“They let me out on good behavior”, Bobby joked. “It wasn’t like they had enough juice to keep the lights on over there on my prison sell, either.”
Michael didn’t say anything, but the corner of his lips twitched in what could almost have been a smile. “Thank you.”
“If God doesn’t know the spell, why would Rowena? One of them is supposed to be All-Knowing, and it’s not her”, Dean said, gesturing downwards.
happen here. We figured it was probably from someone who was resurrected, except, according to our adorable redhead over there, the guy it belongs to has never actually died, so that doesn’t seem to be the case.”
“One day at a time, I know”, he said, picking up a stuffed giraffe from the floor on the way upstairs. “How’s mom?”
things. I’m talking about you, dear”, she said, brushing her fingers against his chin. “Think of all the good you could do, Sam. Not having to worry about hunters dying because they have resurrecting hexbags made by you with them; protecting charms, locating spells, cloaking incantations… think of all the good you could do for the monsters as well.”
“We don’t owe you –” Anael started, but Amara raised her hand. She had a smile in the corner of her lips.
He was the first to fall through. The others came, one by one, with Sam being the last – he had to give a boost to some of them so they could reach the ceiling, which for him was the least humiliating thing that had happened that entire afternoon (but certainly not for Rufus).
”, she corrected, pointedly. “In my personal opinion, everything in the universe needs balance, and this job was clearly not one meant to be done alone. This way, things are always… even. Unless of course either of you have a problem with that.”
“It’s because…” Dean hesitated. He felt the pressure in his chest; building, growing, expanding, suffocating him. He exhaled. “Because I love him. And I need him back. And you’re going to help me, because you owe it – to me, to him, to everyone.”
They moved on to – another – throne room, where Amara had taken residency. In her brother’s old chair, she looked right in place; on the other hand, the two people perched at her side, Naomi and Anael, were… not an encouraging sight.
“Hi, Mrs. Winchester”, the boy said, looking at his feet. Tears were already swelling up the corner of his eyes. “I’m sorry.”
“I see you put what I’ve left you to good use”, she said, with a smirk, looking back at where Eileen had just been.
, Samuel. They don’t mean anything to people like you and me”, she said, with a dismissive hand-wave. “I meant it when I said you are the closest thing of a seasoned witch I’ve seen in a while, and you could be good at it, too.”
“You can try”, Dean teased, dropping all the stuffed animals he’d picked along the way over the bed. “How are you, by the way? How’s your new enterprise going?”
“You already have an in with Heaven and an in with Hell, Samuel. Why not build that last bridge? Wouldn’t it be better than just playing cop with your fake badge?” she asked, caressing his cheek.  “Go on, now, your brother is waiting.”
“So what, now? Are we just supposed to leave Cas rotting in that place forever?” Dean asked. He could feel the anger boiling inside him – that red hot furnace brimming underneath his skin, ready to explode.
– were tending to the bar. Jo and Charlie, the original Charlie, were swapping notes in a corner, lost in thought, while Mary Winchester and Kevin Tran sat at the counter, each with a beer in hand.
“It’s cracking. The whole place is cracking.” It said, flailing its fingers. “Soon enough it’s gonna break apart like an egg, and all the things in the other side are gonna spill over.”
“STOP!” Jack shouted. A blast from his hand released the grip it had on them, and they fell to the floor again. “Is this – is this my fault? Did I do this?”
“Doesn’t matter. At least it means we came to the right place. We’re looking for something – a doorway, maybe, or a crack. A way out of Heaven, and into the Empty.”
It all felt distant. Like a different life altogether. “I’m retired, brother. I have a beautiful house in California. I have my toes in the sand. I have my fruity drinks with as many umbrellas as I want. I have my kid. I have my ball and chain. The auto-shop is coming along nicely…this stuff, over there, it’s not my life anymore. It’s yours. You’re the Big Boss Man, now. It’s your legacy. And if you think what you’re doing is helping, if you think what you’re doing is making things better…”
The sudden commotion attracted Amara’s attention. She opened a passage from Chuck’s study room to the throne, as soon as the first of them began to pass through, lest they ended on a pile up. Seeing who was seated on God’s throne was a shock to many – especially the archangels, even more so Raphael, who’d been out of the loop for a while, and barely understood what was going on; but he remember his aunt, and what he and his brothers had to do to her, and that was enough to go on.
“We’re looking for a way into the Empty”, Dean explained. “We know there’s one. It came through here last time it invaded, so –”
The rest of the family had come closer. Ellen and Jo came in for a hug; Rufus was less warm and fuzzy. He settled for a firm handshake instead. “Good to see you boys are still getting into trouble”, he scoffed.
The words reached him and into him, echoing in his ears, again and again until it was all he could hear. A single word, like a beam of light, pulling him through the darkness until he emerged, breathing in a gush of air he did not need, in a place where oxygen didn’t exist.
“They are… still adapting, I guess. Each at their own pace. Oh, yeah, Kevin left two days ago. He’s gonna stay with Jody and the girls while we try to find out where Linda has been hiding.”
Light from the cracks illuminated his surroundings, and all the bodies on the floor – his brothers and sisters, friends and enemies, all the people he had loved and lost over the years, some by his own hand.
“There may be another way”, Jack pondered. “Nick… when he tried to bring Lucifer back, he used a spell. I don’t know the spell, but I know it used my blood. Blood of a relative. Maybe if we have some of Cas’ blood – I guess Claire’s counts, since she is his daughter…”
The Empty was far from what Dean had envisioned from Cas’ and Jack’s descriptions: it looked more like a place of torment than hell, with the cracks widening and the people – many of whom he recognized, for better or worse – slowly sinking into black quicksand. Some were up to their knees, or their hips, or their elbows, or even their chests. Many tried to grab upwards, towards something that wasn’t there, pleading for help.
For those angels, up until that point, they had only inhabited vessels – a necessity rather than a want. There had always been, whether they liked or not, some disconnect between their own selves and the bodies they occupied, in the same way a puppet and a hand are not one and the same.
“Yeah, that’s one of the things Aunt Amara wants to fix up. She keeps saying how Chuck was not a very creative writer”, Jack grimaced.
“That’s different. The Empty… nothing is meant to get out of it. Especially not more than once”, she folded her arms. “What is it about him, anyway? What is it about this one defective angel that makes you want to bend the laws of reality to him?”
It stepped closer, until they were face to face. Cas could feel its hand – cold, colder than a dead man’s grip – wrapping around his throat. “Let me go. I can talk to God. We can fix this”, he pleaded.
“Charlie and Bobby are still coping with having doppelgängers, and that is going… well. She’s still around, the two Charlies have been updating Ash on new tech. They’ve been trying to explain Windows 10 to him.”
. Let’s be real, you could do better”, it dismissed, with flicker of its hand. “But you fell, for love, and you took everyone down with you. Literally! Insane, isn’t it? Your kind existed for billions of years, but you get one little crush and in ten years, they are completely wiped out. The guy in the desert took, like, four times longer to get to the Promised Land.”
“Last time, it was around here”, Ash said, pointing to an area full of green pins. “Near where we found Charlie. We could take this route here, skip through most of the B’s, but then –”
happened”, it said, spitefully. “He blew up, all over me. Took a while, but the place started to crack up, now look how it is! The other one – God – he promised he’d fix it up if I let him take Lucifer out, but you people don’t know how to keep your promises, do you?”
“It’s better in real life”, Eileen said. In the confusion, she didn’t manage to understand what most people were saying, but she had at least caught that – much to Sam’s utter embarrassment.
“Nice to see the mission was successful”, she said, approaching the bunch. “Thank you for bringing back the angels. I was supposed to create more, but I was still trying to figure out how to do that without eating their souls in the process…” her eyes fell on the boy on Castiel’s lap, who had somehow managed to fall asleep despite all the ruckus. “And I’m sorry about Jack. I wish… I wish there had been another way.”
But if there is one thing Cas very rarely did was listen – and before the Shadow could raise itself from its little chair, he had already awaken Gabriel, and moved on to the next. And the next. And the next. There was an ocean of people as far as the eye could see and beyond, and he had all the time in the world.
He stepped aside, letting the Shadow approach. “Yay, let’s have some fun!” it said, grasping both sides of Jack’s face. As it sunk its fingers in, they tilted their heads back in sync and screamed; bolts of bright white light exploded out of their eyes and mouths, spreading forward and around them, until they consumed all of their surroundings.
“Oh, please, don’t tell me you’re gonna start crying on me”, she rolled eyes. “Yes, I died. Brutally. Not so much fridged as bath-tubbed. At least you took care of those sons of bitches for me, didn’t you?”
“Hard to say. But to me, he looks… human. Maybe it will regenerate over the years, maybe it won’t. If anything happens, we’ll help. Now…” she smacked her lips. “I think it’s time for you to head home.”
Naomi stepped to the side, opening a door for them. The angels looked around, reluctantly; did they have any other option? One by one, they went ahead.
He turned around. The Shadow was there once again, its arms folded against its chest; it had taken Cas’ shape, except not…quite. The cracks seemed to have reached it as well, and half of its face kept switching between Castiel’s and others – Gabriel’s, Michael’s, Meg’s, Ruby’s, Hannah’s, Billie’s. Either it could not decide… or it could not stop itself.
“We found a lot of people”, Ellen corrected. “We’re not the only ones realizing this heaven situation isn’t ideal. People are grouping up. The thinner the walls are, the more people pass through.”
“Hey buddy, this is a one-time only deal, let’s make the most of it”, she gesture to Anael. “Take him to Abel. And Colette, if she’s on the way. It’s Colette, right? I’m not sure your mother would be particularly thrilled to see you, all things considered, but…”
choose to skip over; no reason to wake up Lucifer again, or Zachariah, or Bartholomew, or Efram or Ishim. He was certainly not going to wake up Belphagor. There were many other options to choose from.
He hurried back downstairs, with the plastic rake at hand, to rejoin his face. The sun was setting in the sky, but they could stay a while longer and watch the stars. There was no hurry to go anywhere.
I was sent to hell in the first place, but since she couldn’t exactly send me upstairs… she gave me a job. Beats being tortured, doesn’t it, Dean?”
But instead he puts the plate in front of Dean and sits opposite of him and starts to eat. After a few seconds Dean starts as well.
“It is like you are not even trying. I hope you liked the conversation with Aaron” His stomach turns as he says the words and feels himself lose some of his anger, defeat and bitterness taking its place.
He is numb, dragging himself to his room, his muscles ache and he wants to scream but something has deserted him. He wants to be angry but he doesn’t have the strength to feel anything. He removes his clothes hastily as if they are burning him and he gets into his bed and cries.
Jack is doing well, better than either brother expected adjusting to being human. He is his usual eager, blunt, ball of sunshine self. He does deem a little bit at times and they both know it’s because he misses Cas.
“We are working on a case” He finally starts and he is still looking at the ceiling. “A man died last week. He was a sex worker.” He pauses.
He takes a deep breath and a sip from his coffee, for a minute he doesn't know how to answer her question, his thoughts are a little fuzzy. He tries to get them in order and when he starts to speak he looks down at his cup.
He calms after that for a bit and looks around. What draws his attention is the fridge, where the rest of the kitchen in clean and tidy, the outside of the fridge is full of various magnets and post-its and a sheet of A4 that has, what Castiel guesses a schedule, in the middle of all that mess. He likes it, it makes the kitchen look lively, like somebody or somebodies, there is a roommate if he remembers correctly, actually live here.
They cold air feels good against his skin, almost freeing. He leans against the wall, puts his hands no his knees, cursing under his breath. He collects his thoughts and starts walking towards the motel.
“Dean” he blurts, and he doesn't know why. He turns in his seat and looks at him. Novak turns as well and stares at him for a few seconds.
“Yeah” he sighs, his eyes narrow at the headache forming at the front of his head. He leans against the door, breathing slowly.
Benny sighs next to him, and then in a serious tone says “Don't get sappy on me. I can deal with you moping for hot guy, but not that look on your face”
Here’s the thing, Dean doesn’t know how to love him this close like that and openly, when he is right there, within reach. So, he doesn’t. He still loves him, he still aches a good ache, in his chest, that means Cas is alive, he is with them. He still loves him in the morning when he goes to the library with a cup of coffee and Cas is right there across from him. He loves him when they go grocery shopping, and Cas picks up boxes, reading at the back with a slight squint and a head tilt and Dean nearly drops the packet of pasta he is holding. He just doesn’t love him to him.
“Yes. We believe it’s a man” he responds taking a sip of his coffee. Hands tight around the cup. “Late thirties, early forties”
Anything. He has been feeling hungry for some time now, but he isn’t gone to make Cas feed him too. The muffin is enough.
It's on Thursday evening, when he gets inside the elevator at the library, that he realises how wrong, and perhaps naïve, he is. He was meeting there with a few others for a project in management, which lasted longer than they initially had planned, which through him a bit off schedule. He sighs, texting Sam and waiting for the elevator to reach his floor, it was a long day at work again and all he wants to do is go home shower, eat and sleep.
Dean splutters and coughs, turning around with wide eyes, his heart beating rapidly in his chest, cause what the hell? Cas just takes the bag and sighs exasperated. “Thank you Gabe, I’ll see you later”
different, if he would have a chance with Castiel. Probably not knowing Dean, he is certain that even in another life he would probably be the same. Not good for anyone. He can’t help but resent Castiel a little too, he knows he feels this way because it’s easier, but still.
“You still on for Saturday?” she asks excitedly, sitting up straighter. Something passes in her eyes, fast, Dean pays it no mind, he is too busy trying to think what they are doing tomorrow.
He finally looks up and stares at Dean, whose breath is suddenly stuck in his throat. God, is he hot and his eyes are so fucking
He rolls his shoulders, trying to rid the tension in his back and puts the bowl on the counter to dry. He goes to the bedroom and gets his clothes out from the dresser. He thinks about taking a shower but dismisses the idea, the water is going to be cold (its always is) and he will shower when he gets back.
Dean groans. “Man, come one I, I-” and now he can’t continue because Cas has pushed his finger in, all the way, making Deans’ breath hitch and he starts to move it. He is careful, Dean notes and warmth spreads through him.
Dean nods in reply and walks out past, the smelly corridors and the man on the counter. He puts his hands in his pockets, because now it’s really cold and looks down as he walks, back towards his apartment.
Dean thinks about Violet and Esme, he turns their words and half-finished phrases in his mind and says, “It’s about their love.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but doesn't fight his smile “I thought you were a healthy eater and I was suppose to eat healthily too”
After the session Castiel decides to go to the library. Looking at books makes him feel calm and protected. It also, helps him think. He hopes he can work a bit on the case as well. They haven’t made much progress. Whoever came in with the man, had hacked the cameras. It frustrated all of them to no end.
He looks at him as if he is considering something and Dean hopes it’s what he thinks it is. Castiel opens his mouth to say something, but before he can say anything a loud, “hey” startles both of them. He turns at the source, it’s the short guy, that marches towards them. He can see Castiel, roll his eyes and Dean smiles slightly.
This Saturday he spends in the park, reading, which really isn’t that different from what he does most mornings, and people watching. He eats a burger and feeds the ducks and wonders if there will be an after for him. He doesn't want to keep doing this job and live in a shitty apartment with thin walls and neighbours who almost always fight or don't know where they are going, either because of booze or drugs.
When he gets to Billie that late afternoon, his nerves are on edge and he can’t get his right leg to stop tapping. Billie notices, but just raises her eyebrow at him and he just shrugs.
Cas frowns at him and doesn't say anything for a while. “I just wish… you would see yourself, give yourself more credit” Now he sounds like Sam and something in Dean is boiling hot, and ready to spill. “Don't get angry”
“I don't think he wants to get to know me” he finally says. And it’s not like I can contact him, he thinks.
“I am sorry” he says before picking it up, then “Hello,” his tone clipped, he turns and faces the window on their left, his free hand playing with a napkin idly.
“Work?” Sam needlessly asks, when he sits down and Dean knows he wants to say more but restrains himself. Good, he can’t deal with it now.
“We knew each other for more than a decade,” he takes a breath that rattles his chest and doesn’t help at all. “We- we screwed each other a lot through those years but yeah.” He doesn’t know why he says that, he also doesn’t know why he adds “We fought a lot of wars together. I spent an entire year looking for the fucker in Pu-” he stops grimacing, “in a foreign-” he struggles and flutters. He used to be good at this, smoother.
Cas gasps above him, cursing and he slowly starts thrusting into him, picking up the pace gradually, until he is moving hard and fast. And Dean never really understood how much he wanted Cas until now. How this thing that flattered in his chest and up his throat threatening to suffocate him every time he looked at Cas, and that impossible pull that he felt towards him, is nothing compared to what is happening to him now. He feels drunk and dizzy and losing himself to the feeling of Cas on top of him, but there is an absolute clarity of everything around him as well. Dean moves to meet him, clenching around him and making him moan. There hands and mouths everywhere, and Cas props himself in one hand and with the other he takes Deans’ cock and start stroking him and Dean is lost.
Dean frowns at her, anger simmering in his stomach and something else, something he isn’t going to admit. “Whatever.” It’s meant to be dismissive, but from the looks they are giving him he knows he didn't succeed.
“I want you to know this won’t affect you academically. I can be impartial” Castiel eventually says after a moment, a little thickly, that he masks with clearing his throat. And Dean pretends that it’s as hard for Castiel as it is for him.
“I think I’m going to go now.” Castiel cuts him of standing up. “I’ll see you in the court on Monday” He adds as he wears his trench coat.
He opens the door to the lecture hall and sees some students already seated, a few are around the professors’ desk talking with her. He moves farther into the room and choses a seat on the third row towards the middle, he sits down with a huff and takes a minute to breath.
And then the door opens with a loud thump at the wall, making everyone jump. Dean turns his head, and that beep sound coming from the machine is because he got scared from the door.
Sam asks if they can see the living room and Dean cringes more, inwardly this time, and she nods, gives a raspy
“I’m fine” he says after a moment, shrugging, turning to look back at the other man, who looks like he wants to say something but thinks better of it and presses his lips into a thin line.
When he started doing this he wasn't exactly sure how to shop customers, but thankfully they did know how to approach him. He knew, he had learned it since he was a teenager, that he was fairly pretty, not handsome, as someone told him once, he doesn't remember who. And he had learned how to use it to his advantage, but this was different and it didn’t have to do with a pretty face, that was just an advantage. Just a way for people to remember him, though Dean wanted to be forgotten.
“It’s just you make it sound so… indifferent” the last word she says in a question and Dean wants to tell her
He pushes himself a little deeper into the pillows and sighs softly at the man in front of him, who has been apologising to him for the last five minutes. Dean had tried to interrupt him, but he was determined to finish his long apology. Which Dean can understand, when he was nineteen, he had almost hit someone with Baby, but he was more nervous about what dad was going to say than anything else and he doesn't want to think what that means. So, he lets the man do his thing and just lays on the hospital bed and waits. Not that he can leave, he tried.
“Lily, had been nudging me for ages to read it. Though I didn't think I’d like it, not what I would go for.” He says, tone more open. And his eyes, Castiel notes, seem greener than before, again it could be just his imagination.
Dean reaches for his wallet and gives him a five-dollar bill and takes the receipt and change from Benny. He goes and waits in the corner, like he saw the other people do. He sees a bald guy with a beard, coming around the corner with a tray, and as he heads towards the coffee machine, he says something to Benny and they both laugh.
He sighs, placing the glass down with the rest of them, he knows Benny is right and yet- “I know, ok. It’s just-”
Dean thinks about Singers’ auto shop for days. He considers going back and asking for a job, but he knows his chances of being hired are slim to none. Besides all he has is a high school diploma and he doesn't even want to think about work experience. So, he goes to the library and works and thinks about Cas.
The envelope is left on his desk and it’s the first thing he notices when he gets inside his office in the morning. His heart jumps in his chest and he tries to ignore the chill that goes up his spine, say it’s nothing serious. But Castiel isn’t a great liar or really, good at calming himself and judging by the looks Hannah and Inias gave him when he walked in, he knows it’s nothing good. Well, it could also be because he isn’t supposed to be here today, but its not like he had anything else to do. He absolutely despises the days he in on call.
Benny bumps his shoulder with his own, as Dean is wiping a glass and he shoots him a glare. “Cheer up, cher”
“I also think you are not angry at Sam, like you are not angry at me right now. If you are angry at all”
Dinner is good recipe wise. They all make an effort to keep the conversation floating, it seems to be an unspoken agreement not to let the silence stretch for too long. They all say something, even Dean, Claire is the one that doesn’t utter a single word. She throws him these looks a couple of times though, full of anger and grief, that have Jody clear her throat pointedly and Donna babble more.
He spends the whole day in bed either reading or browsing Netflix and Amazon Prime. He finally got around finishing Good Omens; he still likes the book better, he texts Eileen as much and she agrees. Then asks him if he wants her to bring him anything, but he refuses. He doesn't want to see anyone.
Castiel swallows, for a moment he doesn't know what to say and he just sits there staring at him. He lets emotions pass through him, hate, anger, sadness, until he isn’t sure what he is feeling. So, he says exactly what he sees.
“Ok” Bobby tells him simply in a tone filled with too many meanings that Dean can’t decipher half of, but it makes him feel good, accepted. And he thinks there is an undercurrent of pride under Bobby’s tone but Dean doesn't search too much, he doesn't think he can handle what he will find there.
“He is a prostitute” he says at last and then adds hastily. “I met him, when I went for information down town and then in the library and then we short of see each other at places.”
He places his hands on the other man’s thighs and nudges them just a little bit more apart, enough so he can fit comfortably between them. He feels as Castiel stills and he waits there, breathing heavily through the scent of musk and something that is so distinctive of Castiel that he is getting drunk and mad from want but he is going to wait. He feels him relax and then he slowly drags his tongue from the base to the tip, making goosebumps erupt in his body and he suppresses a shudder; the taste is good in his tongue, full, just a touch too salty.
She glances down at the paper and up at his eyes again making his frown deepen. He turns the paper on the other side and he blinks for several seconds.
A moment later the door opens. Dean watches as his feet get closer to him and then comes face to face with him.
“Fine.” he exclaims louder than he meant to and Jo grins at him. “But this is the last time until Benny comes back. I mean it Jo”
“You know the beginning” he says and shrugs. It’s true he did tell her about mum and how dad put them in the impala the next day and after they were all over the place. She knows about the guns and knives and that he took care of Sam. The important things. The landmarks or just the ones Dean can voice.
“Yeah, I do.” And then, because he does love him and he does want him in his life, “It doesn’t excuse me.”
Dean watches him walk down the corridor until he turns right and loses sight of him. He finds himself exhale and closes his eyes momentarily. He then hears a sound and opens them to look at Becky, who has an odd expression in her face. He raises his brows in question and she just shakes her head and says something that is entirely lost on Dean.
“Yeah” Dean says distractively, opening the back door and throwing his bag inside, he looks up at her ready to tell her he will never get used to it or just get better, but the words die in his throat as his eyes catch on something or someone.
After the initial shock passed, he hollered at Sam, who came into the kitchen looking all kinds of apologetic but with a determined look all the same. Because the thing is, Dean send an application for the community college, and never ever did he remember sending one at the university of Chicago. His stomach still turns at that and he still can’t, for the life of him say he is a student there. They had requested an interview with him, because they
What kills him is that he understands why Cas did what he did and knows that if the roles were reversed he would have done the same.
He takes a breath and washes his want with coffee and Castiel does the same. They stay like that for a while, until they are both half way through their cups, just drinking and glancing at each other.
He gets off along with another girl that walks towards the other direction and Dean finds himself feeling relived for whatever reason. He reaches Novak’s office and sees Hannah looking intently at her computer screen while typing, who stops and looks up as she hears him approach, recognition flashing across her face. She smiles at him and he stops in front of her desk, body half turned towards the closed door, but still looking at her.
He sits down next to Michael and doesn’t say anything about the mess on the table. Dean hands him his fork, pushing the plate with his half-finished food away from him. Sam takes the fork without question and Dean dreads the conversation that is to come when they are alone.
“It’s not for everyone. But, you like it” he says seriously, with that tone he uses when he wants to get something through to other people.
He feels heavy, has been feeling this way since yesterday. It was a particularly long night, then again, most nights seem long these days and Dean has a strange, he wouldn't necessarily call it bad, feeling in his chest.
When Dean continues to look at him Novak adds “I don't know what else to tell you.” Dean frowns at him, and Novak looks troubled “Your points are good, and what you are trying to say is insightful, but you need to work on they way you write it.”
“Hello Dean” it is said quietly, almost matching Dean’s tone, with a certainty that doesn’t match the disbelief in his face.
When he returns, and he feels heavy and there is lump in his throat. He lays under the covers. After a minute or two, he feels the need to get up again and check. But tells himself he is being paranoid, there is no one there.  Eventually it passes and he just lays there breathing, hands still shaking, mind numb.
“I-” Novak starts and upon meeting Dean’s eyes, he stops yet again, seemingly to collect him thoughts “I need to-, if you-” but Dean stops him again when moves to stand in front of him, “Dean”.
“Sorry, but I’ve never seen him before” And even if he had, Dean wouldn't remember. He keeps to himself, doesn’t interact. He knows a couple of names, maybe about a dozen faces, but that's it. He learned a long time ago, that in order to survive around here, he needed a wall between him and everyone else.
Gabriel is staring at them amused and sizing Dean up and he tries to ignore it. He chuckles at them and then gives Cas a look, that Dean again can’t read and moves to retrieve a chocolate muffin. And though understandable, he feels a little left out with their silent conversations, but he doesn't let it get to him much.
“Here,” he says passing the phone to Castiel, having already pull up Gildas’ number. “I hope she helps” he adds watching Castiel typing in his phone. “Just call her tomorrow and ask. Probably after eleven”
“Like they are asleep” Castiel says and they all turn to look at him. “That’s what I keep thinking when I see them”
Raises his hand and Dean doesn't flinch, but his face much do something, because Cas looks at him with eyes full of grief and takes his face in his palm, moving his thumb across his cheekbone and Dean realizes he has been crying.
“No” he breaths and raises from his seat abruptly. “Thank you” he tells him and walks out the office, without waiting for a reply. He closes his eyes once the door closes behind him and sighs. He opens them and finds Hannah looking at him with a raised brow.
“No” Hannah responds and walks to stand next to him. “No form of identification on him” she sighs softly and continues. “The room wasn't booked. It was going to be occupied today, the cleaning staff found him. Also, nobody saw him going up.”
Perhaps it was something he had said, perhaps it was that stupid, so stupid comment he made about Philip in calculus class, in passing during their sorry excuse of a dinner.
“It’s alright.” He doesn’t think he will be able to keep anything down. He intertwines his fingers on the counter, drumming his thumbs together.
“I know you two go jogging together in the mornings, but this will never happen with me,” he says gruffly and because his voice is too melancholic and he was meaning to cheer him up he adds, “Just take the days off, dude.”
“Am I supposed to make it?” at Castiel’s unwavering expression he adds “Is this how you treat all your guests?”
Castiel stares him for a second too long, so he adds, “We, ugh, we are going to be exclusive if you want”
It feels good. And by the time they are laying side by side on the bed, with a mattress that’s much to soft for Dean’s liking, he feels satisfied and with a certain clarity in his head that last for all of ten minutes, because Dean closes his eyes and sees deep blue, and hears a deep rumble talking about Camus, making his heart start racing again. He sighs softly and suddenly feels heavier than before. Andy tells him he can stay till morning but Dean refuses. He needs to leave and the other seems to understand. He gets dressed and at Andy’s concerned look, Dean tells him he is fine and not to worry about it.
“You don't think it’s-” he looks at Castiel like he will find the word in his eyes and then he finally says “I don't know… laughable”
“Everything alright?” she raises her eyebrows at the man in question, who takes a step back in reflex and nods, looking him up and down.
. So, I just need you to drop that heroic martyr act you have going on, because it’s just making you mis-”
his brain supplies. He shakes his head and focusing back on Novak, who is looking at them expectantly.
“I knew you’d like the kitchen” he says with a smirk, rolling his shoulders. He is nervous too, Dean realises and somehow that makes him relax and not feel totally helpless. He is not alone in this.
He doesn't realise he has been staring, so when blue eyes, that are a lot closer than before, meet his, he freezes and inhales sharply. He sees Castiel’s steps falter, but he soon composes himself, as oppose to Dean, who is standing frozen in place. They soon reach him and pass him, all but him who just stops there and looks at Dean, like he is studying him, which is not that different from the other two times.
He pulls back the shower curtain and gets in, opens the shower the hottest it will go and lets it burn his skin. It’s good, his legs tingle as he regains some feelings of them.
A silent fall between them then, Dean desperately wants to break it but doesn’t know where to start and Castile appears to be on the same fate.
He moves a bit in his seat, the silence is eating him, it’s almost as bad as when he had the radio on. He never had a problem with silence, he always enjoyed it. Growing up in a house with Gabriel, was chaotic, so when he had a few moments of silence he soaked in it. Now though, it was like the first week after what happened. A deafening silence, that sat in every corner as if it was taunting him. He was suddenly so alone and couldn't do anything, couldn't have done anything. Not that he could have prevented that man in the hotel room from being killed, he knew that, it was just the shadow of something else.
He thinks about how out of all the universes they only had one chance and they didn't even get that one.
"I-" he sucks in a breath as Cas walks to stand directly beside him. His right hand coming up to touch the side of his face. It's warm and big and something swells in Dean's chest, bursts and spills over so much euphoria, so much goodness, so much love. He can barely breath through it.
“Oh, don't be prudist now” he says smiling. “It’s a profession and what I am trying to say is, get a PhD if you are either in the first or third category. Now, let’s start”
They take a shower together. When Castiel hands reach for Dean’s back, moving to wash him all soapy and slippery, he freezes, taking half a step away, ignoring the hurt in Castiel eyes, that is gone as quickly as it comes. It feels too much, too intimate, too much of something that Dean can’t touch, can’t be. So, they each wash themselves silently and go to lay in the bed next each other.
“I can’t believe you thought you couldn’t have me.” He whispers, biting on his lip and really it’s the most absurd thing Dean has ever heard, because Cas is this incredible being that Dean’s mind can’t comprehend, that he so full of goodness and Dean is just-
“Permanency, or the absence of it” he says and looks up at Dean. “and loneliness” this conversation is getting heavier than Dean expected. “I mean, I like living alone. It’s just sometimes, I get this feeling, like I will
“Fuck you” Dean pants and Castiel just shoots him an unimpressed look, removing his hand. He reaches, somewhere on Dean’s left side and takes something in his hand, and then he hears the familiar tear of a condom wrap and he thinks,
The talk with the wife gives them nothing but a description of a great, quite, small town life. Big surprise there.
“Well, I was kissing you” he says and smirks softly at him, running a hand up his arm, “and I did want to ride you,” then, “but if you are in a hurry and since you
“No, I am good” He looks at Dean and smiles, a wistful smile. A little sad, Dean thinks. “You know, it’s been a while since I last went to the movies”
Dean hums, leaving chaste kisses on his lips, his hand behind his head running his fingers through his dark hair tagging softly and Castiel grips his side in answer. Then says against his lips,
“Aphrodite?” Dean picks up a coffee cup, taking a sip. It is exactly how he takes it when he lets himself have it. Two sugars, two tea spoons of milk. He relaxes his shoulders as the hot liquid runs down his throat and doesn’t acknowledge how Sam knows about it even it is something he hasn’t done around him. Well not to Sam’s knowledge but apparently he was wrong.
Castiel nods and continues. “And it’s the way he leaves them. In a hotel room and under the sheets. They look like they are sleeping.”
He doesn't know when they moved, but suddenly he feels himself laying on the floor, and he spreads his legs so Castiel can fit better on top of him. He feels the weight of him and he releases a moan between them, that Castiel takes in his mouth and releases it in Dean throat. They remove Dean’s flannel and then his shirt, that he places behind him because the floor is cold, and he stares up at Castiel who is looking down at him in lust, as though Dean is all he ever wanted, causing the younger man to swallow. He feels a pressure behind his eyes and he blinks; everything is heightened and Dean is burning through it all and he is not nearly satisfied enough; he wants more, so much more.
He is calling the number again and listens as Cas voice fills his ear. It’s a sort, awkward message, like the first one he recorded years ago, that conveys a resentment for the act.
They drive in silence, Pink Floyd playing in the background quietly, the only thing interrupting is Castiel telling him where to take a turn. He parks outside the shop and Castiel asks him if he minds coming with him, since he has to wear the suit one final time and Dean, despite knowing that it’s not a good idea, says yes. It’s how he finds himself sitting in a plush chair, while a someone is choosing a suit for another wedding on his right and a sales assistant,
But fortunately for him and his sanity, they have made progress on the case. And now he has something else to put focus on. He runs a hand through his hair, messing it up even more and watches the man on the other side of the glass as he darts his eyes around the room nervously. A security camera captured him carry, more so than support Mark Anderson, in the hotels’ hallway. With that they learned that the victims are still alive when they enter the hotels, but they are drugged and can barely walk.
has asked him twice if he’d like a glass of water, in a tone like he has personally offend her. He moves his feet; his shoes squeaking in the overly shiny floor and he closes his eyes for a moment. There is a perfume in the air that is bothering him and he has to stop himself from scrunching his nose for the tenth time, in the last five minutes.
When he gets home from work, Sam is already there on the living room floor, with his laptop in the coffee table and a notebook full of notes next to it. His hair is messy and he is staring at the laptop screen, scrutinizing whatever it is there.
“Your love.” At the words something cold goes down his back, makes his head throb and he balls his hands into fists, his nails digging into his flesh.
Something is changing between them or it already has, Castiel can’t tell and he doesn't think he minds.
He smiled and a bittersweet feeling overtook him. He thought about the people in the photograph and felt like all those things happened a lifetime ago and maybe to someone else. He doesn't know why he had that thought, it troubled him, made him feel like he was becoming a distant memory, maybe he was or more precisely the person in the photograph along with Mick was. He knew he was completely different from that twenty-two-year-old. And the thing that made him feel a bit guiltier, was that he was happy about it. He, also, wondered idly if the person he was now was someone that Mick would have liked, not that it mattered now, but it was just a thought that he didn't care the answer for.
“You love me,” he says it like a fact, an unmovable truth and all Dean can do is turn his eyes to his and gruff,
They get undressed, almost methodically and Dean looks at him in that way they all like, as if he has been waiting for that moment all week.
They look at each other for long moment, until he moves to sit next to her. He tries to keep his expression as neutral as possible but hers makes it hard to, it’s all raw emotion and hard eyes and behind a loss, carved into her, all across her body. He has only ever seen her like this when her mom died, the only thing different is that this time there is no desperation.
“The papers and exams are graded by an external examiner as well as me and if the grades are not close to each other they are reviewed. So you don’t have to worry” he continues assuring.
“Are we done?” He asks trying, and probably failing, to not look exasperated. “Everything is in the report, that we have gone over about fifty times now”
“Oh, yeah Carmen. I’ve forgot to tell you about her” he says thoughtfully, taking a box in his hands and turning towards him, giving Dean a small self-conscious smile. “I found her a year ago outside my door when she was a kitten and well, she decided she wanted to live here.” Dean nods, not knowing how to respond and follows Cas, as he walks towards, actually he doesn't know where Cas is going.
There is no need for him to feel guilty about anything, about moving on because its normal, it is expected, it is what Mick would have wanted.
Oli makes a sound and Dean presses his lips together. Yeah ok he misses him too but this is ridiculous.
Benny tells them their sum and Castiel takes his card out and can see Dean reach for his wallet as well but he just pays and moves towards the waiting area, without looking back at him. He knows Dean is going to be more irritated, but he doesn't care. He has come to find that he gets annoyed whenever someone gives him something, so Castiel has come to ignore the scowls.
He swallows, mules it over in his mind. Sam is going to be pissed, Michael and Adam too. He runs a hand across his mouth and says, “You have my word. And the killings they stop.”
“He asked if-” Dean’s voice is wobbly and throaty, sounds as if it’s ripping him apart, looks that way too. He runs his palms up and down his thighs, fingers moving as if to close around his palm but stop mid-way over and over again. He is staring down on the floor, his shoulders drop. “If I-”
It happens like this, Dean goes to a bar just down the road the following night. It’s crowded but not to the point where it gets suffocating. The atmosphere is nice, Christmas songs on the side and even if Dean thinks if he smells even more nutmeg he will gag. He is on his third glass of whiskey, just feeling a pleasant buzz under his skin, still in control of his thoughts, when she take a seat on the stool next to him.
When the lecture finally finishes, he stays on his seat until most of the students leave, apart from the ones that are talking to Castiel by his desk. He sighs, rolling his eyes at himself and packs his staff.
He takes a magazine from the coffee table in front of him for a lack of something else to do and flips through it mindlessly.
Dean swallows trembling and he can’t stop looking at him. Novak looks up and their eyes meet and Deans’ ears are ringing as the world stops and shifts at the same time, and he looks away before something embarrassing happens, because the look that passes through Castiel’s face for just a second is enough to ignite something in Dean. Something dark and heavy and full of want, like that night a week ago and Dean is too small to handle all these.
Castiel unlocks the door on his second try and they stumble in. Castiel grabs him and pushes him against the wall kissing his lips, then moves down his throat, hands travelling under Dean’s shirt. Dean bulks, hands going to grip Castiel’s shoulders, who kisses him again, hands inching higher. He runs his thumb across Dean’s nipple making him hiss, heat pulling on his lower belly, and Castiel does it again and again.
He hears Cas breathe beside him, his breaths becoming more even by the minute and he is dosing off, when he feels something painful push in his stomach. He grunts, his eyes flying open and so does his hand at the source of pain and he finds himself pushing at something… furry? He hears a hiss and Cas grumbling under his breath.
He mutters under his breath as he walks down the street sipping his coffee, at least she didn't charge him extra for this shitty milk thing.
This was Cas and if Dean was nervous at all, it was because this was his first time with the person he loved. The person he had desired long before he had allowed himself to think along those lines, long before he had even realized he
They took all of three steps, his students still in his back as well as the crowd of gossipers, when two things happened at once.
“So, Dean,” she began, tucking her feet under her tights. “I hear you have joined your daughter and Cas in their daily meetings.”
Dean felt as if Cas’ had slapped him right in the face. He wanted to strangle him, wanted to yell, wanted to shake some sense into him. Did he not know? Had he never heard how Dean had lost Lisa? How Gracie had lost her mom?
He was pulled from reminiscing about that and stopped in his tracks down the aisle to Ruby’s bay when Cas whispered, “Hey, Dean. I left my phone at home. Could I use yours? Or could you text Michael? Let him know I’m alright?”
“Yeah. But that was a long time ago, okay? So please – don’t judge him for what he did. Or if you have to, always remember what I’ve told you: that it takes a lot of bravery to do what he did. To tell someone what you feel, even though it’s already too late.”
“You got it,” Michael replied and while he laughed with the rest of the room, Dean could see an understanding shine in his friend’s eyes. Yep, certainly a topic the two of them would have to discuss at some point in the next three years or so.
So not complaining, he let his two best friends do as they pleased and simply went along for the ride… spending the rest of the day daydreaming about a faceless person in angel attire.
Their things were quickly packed thereafter, Dean’s duffle mostly untouched and Cas’ suitcase never really unpacked. So really, the hardest work was to try and keep their hands
Hope to see you tomorrow - if not, have a great start to the new year and we'll see each other soon.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. For what, exactly, he was unable to say. All of it, most likely. But he couldn’t name it all and by the way Cas’ gazed at him, he was sure he didn’t need to.
The only good thing to be said about it was the swiftness. Before he really knew what was happening, they were already over New York – or at least it felt that way. What would’ve taken him between two to three hours of driving, if not even longer due to the road conditions, was now a thing of about forty-five minutes.
Wrapped up warmly, and with his usual reflective jacket and some lights on Cherry’s harness, Dean started on his ride.
“You sure about that?” she asked, before turning to Charlie. “What Dean’s neglecting to mention is that
Another thought came to him, unexpected and unbidden. Of someone else by his side and for the briefest moment, he saw a vision of dark blue eyes and a soft smile, both framed by wrinkled skin and salt-and-pepper hair...
He had also often imagined, had wondered about how brash and bold he, himself, would be. Now though, that the situation was here, there was no question, no hesitation.
As the laughter died down, Chuck continued with, “Alright, alright,” and Dean turned his eyes back to the front to pay attention to him.
He knew Andrew had a hard time with focusing for too long, and the doodling around mostly helped him to keep himself focused.
One moment, Dean was still asleep, the next he was awake, eyes opened and fixed at the darkness above him.
“Shut up,” he ordered, his hands already roaming over Dean’s body. “Don’t you dare apologize. We have all the time in the world.” His lips were so close to Dean’s ear as he promised him this, the dark voice, the hot breath against his skin, the implication itself… the implication of ‘forever’... it all made Dean shiver. “And if you’ll never be comfortable with it, then that’s alright as well,” Cas still went on, this time even letting his tongue run over Dean’s earlobe. The shiver running through Dean’s body intensified and he had to wind his arms around Cas’ body to hold him tight.
Dean’s heart broke in that moment. It seemed no matter what he did, his friendship with Cas was gone. What good did all the pushing of his friends do when there was no reason for Dean to even think about maybe feeling more for Cas? What good would it do him if he figured it out, only to realize it was too late? And it really was too late. Maybe he should just let go. Let go and be glad that Cas now had a happy life in New York.
Once he reached the upstairs landing, he forced himself to slow down and keep calm. Quicker than his mind had time to catch up with the moment, he was already standing inside the door that led into Cas’ room – only to be greeted by the sight of all the Shurley siblings and some of their spouses littered around the room.
“You mean this with us?” Dean clarified, just to be absolutely sure. When Cas nodded, he didn’t hesitate to cup Cas’ cheek in his hand, holding on tenderly as Cas leaned into the touch. “I love you. And I want to be with you. I want this to be a real relationship. So, I guess… we’re
? What if he was still angry and would send Dean away? Dean would certainly understand that – hell, up until a few hours ago, he had still been angry at Cas, himself. Who was to say what Cas had done these past two days and how he had handled it all?
“Oh, come on, Mr. Winchester,” Andrew exclaimed, being the first to break this time. “The whole school’s talking about it.”
There, he said it. Had voiced the truth he’d known for so long. It hurt and Dean could feel tears well up in his eyes. Still, he kept talking. “And I felt guilty about that. So utterly guilty because Lisa... she was a sweet soul and she deserved only the best. She deserved to be loved by someone the same way I love you.”
! He knew it wasn’t going to be a problem, it was only Cas he reacted to like this… but then again, maybe it
Sure his eyes were screaming about the emotions he was unable to tell Cas just yet, he still didn’t try to rein them in as he looked back at Cas. He simply couldn’t and found he also didn’t want to try. Not anymore.
Their chuckles showed that no one believed him and Dean didn’t press it. Maybe they would know better in a few weeks’ time or maybe they would be right in the end. Either way, it wasn’t something he wanted to waste time thinking about now. Besides, he could hear Patty and Babette draw closer, their excited voices echoing across the square. When he looked up, he could see a little crowd surrounding them.
BUT, thanks to so many of you asking for it, I decided to add a little something to the beginning of this chapter 😁
for it in some ways - it still annoyed him the moment Sam brought it up. Or maybe it was just this pussyfooting around it. “What do you want to hear?”
“What?” Dean asked, dragging his eyes back to his friend as he took a sip of his drink. Thankfully, Naomi was involved in her conversation with her friend.
“How many more pages?” Dean asked, sighing deeply. Was he the only father in the world not immune to his daughter arguing like this? The room might be dark, but it wasn’t as if this was the first time they had this conversation. Dean knew exactly what Gracie’s face looked like in this moment. This moment when she pulled out her
All of a sudden, Gracie was gone, and Dean still stood in the middle of the diner, staring at Cas, not able to move an inch or even avert his gaze. A few heartbeats later, Cas’ eyes were on him, staring right into his soul, leaving him breathless.
in the summertime so much so that you can hardly walk around and we should totally all come back here in summer and try it because, honestly, it’s the best view, you can see all of Paris from there and the Eiffel Tower and–”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, ears burning up. Not really a topic he’d wanted to discuss with his kid. At least not at such a young age.
Cas wasn’t calling him by his last name because of their brief history as teacher and student. But how else could he approach the topic? His brain certainly wasn’t helping in finding a solution. As Cas didn’t react, not even in a negative way, Dean collected all his courage and went on. “And I actually thought you saw me as your friend long before you saw me as your teacher.” He swallowed but did not stop. “Is it so hard for you to do that again?”
This was simply Cas, and Dean could finally and fully let himself accept that he was more than just attracted to him.
“Grace, it’s not that easy,” he finally tried, but he could tell that his daughter wouldn’t accept that.
Without his conscious consent, Dean’s feet carried him over, not giving his brain any time to come up with something clever to say. Which was his only excuse for what actually came out of his mouth.
“Guess we didn’t know him as well as we thought,” Dean said, throwing more fuel into the fire, before he swallowed hard to keep back the bile he was tasting.
He admitted, there had been a moment where he’d wondered how he would feel to out himself to them. Not that he planned to do it in class – but this was Stars Hollow. News like that… there was no way his kids
Still, he had to put some perspective in here because yeah, Dean would take a lot of shit and a lot of blame, but, “It’s my fault you got wasted and almost killed yourself?”
Before he could say anything else, Gracie was done with putting away her shoes and jacket, grabbed her bag, and pressed a kiss to Dean’s cheek.
When all that came together, and on top of that, he heard Lucy exclaim in glee, “Ohh, look. Uncle Dean and Uncle Cas are standing under the mistletoe. You have to kiss now.”
The whole ride up, he kept his eyes closed, willing himself to stay calm, rehearsing what he wanted to say – what he
This was a time to revel in sensation and wonder, and Dean wanted to feel so much more than he already did. Which was why he soon reached for Cas’ belt buckle.
“Honestly… I have to agree with her,” Cas told him, his smile still wide. “You even knew C and I both had a job interview the same day.”
“Then why did you act like that?” Dean went on, not completely able to switch off his protective dad mode.
As he looked up and into those incredible blue eyes, he was thrown right back into the darkness of the theater. Right back to the moment where his sense had left him and his brain cells had begun their packing for vacation.
Somewhere in the far back of his mind, a voice whispered to him that this was not really the way to solve all the misunderstandings that were still between them. He should probably
In hindsight, Dean was glad he had long before decided he would allow Gracie to stay the night at the stables as long as everything had gone alright. Thanks to that, he didn’t have to feel like a bad father who wanted his daughter out of the house for the night for one reason and one reason alone. So when, around three in the morning, it was evident everything had all gone smooth, Dean counted down the minutes until Gracie’s begging would start.
None of that mattered because his princess was amazing and Dean didn’t even try to pretend not to be tearing up. Especially not when Gracie took her final bow and the crowd jumped to their feet, going crazy with applause and cheers. Dean was so ecstatic, so thankful for this moment, for Gracie dancing again, and for how the people of Stars Hollow supported his little girl. He had no words for it, could only laugh and clap and cheer, not caring for the silent tears of happiness still leaking from his eyes. And when his baby girl ran off the stage and directly into his arms, he lifted her up and held her tight, whispering, “I’m so proud of you,” into her hair, and once again thanked God and her guardian angels.
When his eyes landed on his friend, he was unable to hide the turmoil of his feelings from Gabe - who, for once, did not joke or even crack a grin. There was nothing but seriousness in his demeanor, for once showing that the guy was, in fact, an adult. And a responsible one at that.
Dean didn’t even know if he replied anything to that, too far in his head as this strange combination of worry and relief washed over him in waves, again and again. He had to get up and walk around his apartment, just to ease some of the nervous energy coursing through him.
“No, of course not,” Dean sighed, “but it was a nice compensation to balance out all the numbers and laws and whatnot I have to drill into my head.”
“I love both,” Dean assured before a grin tugged at the corner of his lips, “But with a meat lovers, your friend certainly just earned a lot of bonus points.”
He was unable to stop his frown, desperately wanting to know what was going on in Cas’ head. It seemed his terrible charade had at least convinced Gracie - which Dean would think impossible under normal circumstances. His kid was way too perceptive for such a terrible display to fool her. Seemed like she wanted Cas’ approval so desperately she was purposefully overlooking any negativity.
Tears were softly running down Cas’ cheeks but before Dean could even attempt to wipe them away, Cas had already moved to lean over him, sinking into a deep, heartfelt kiss. He all but crawled into Dean’s lap to straddle him and Dean didn’t hesitate to hold him tight, pulling him impossibly closer as he felt him shiver. The water was getting too cold, Dean could feel it as well – but there was no room in him to truly care.
started to open up to him, he would certainly not jeopardize that by crowding in on him, like a stalker. Instead, he stayed in bed, his hands crossed behind his head, eyes following the shadowy pattern on the roof of his room.
“Ready for dinner?” Dean asked once his lips were free again and when Cas simply nodded in reply, Dean looked over to where he had spotted Meg Masters just before his world had solely fixed on Cas. Judging by that satisfied grin she wore and the sheer lack of surprise, Cas had told her about them. “Want to join us, Miss Masters?”
Soft noises filled the room and Dean wanted to hear more of them. Once the dress shirt was finally open, he let his lips wander lower, his tongue swiping over the freshly exposed skin.
He never thought he’d ever have this conversation with Grace. Never thought she’d ever find out about her parents’ wedding day. He’d probably been naive, knowing that the chances had always been high. Hell, there was a whole article in the Stars Hollow Gazette, published the day after Christmas, the incident the leading story of that day. Dean had been furious when he’d seen it once he’d returned from their honeymoon, even thinking about suing the newspaper. Michael had asked him not to, reasoning that it would only keep the story in the spotlight for weeks, if not even months to come.
of the barn door had them both jump apart, the bubble suddenly burst, reality crashing back down on them. And it had the voice of his own brother, the biggest cockblock in history.
, he was unable to tame his cheeky grin. But the way it made Cas chuckle was so, so worth it. Even more so, when Cas kissed him again and again and again. Somewhere in between, Dean was finally done with all these terribly annoying buttons. There was no denying how incredibly sexy Cas was in these vests – but Dean could already see that those buttons would kill him one day. That, or he might ruin one or two of those vests in the future simply by being too eager.
He could tell she didn’t buy his bullshit but mercifully, she did not say anything, but simply helped his students with the cookies. Handing bags out to waiting customers.
It was soft, almost no distraction at all - if it hadn’t been for Cas’ eyes moving to the object, the corner of his mouth twitching up.
Gracie’s head snapped up from where her nose was buried in her book again already and even out of the corner of his eyes, he could see his daughter’s eyes going wide.
Pressing a soft kiss to Cas’ unruly hair, he leaned against his head, breathing him in. Under their blanket, Cas’ hand squeezed his in answer and Dean’s smile ticked up that little wider. Yes, he truly was part of the family now and there was a sweet sense of rightness in this.
So instead of tasting a man’s dick for the first time, Dean moved back up and caught Cas’ lips, keeping their kiss slow but all the more sinful. Cas was pressing into the kiss but at the same time trying to wiggle out of his dress pants without taking his hand out of Dean’s hair. Dean couldn’t suppress his grin – someone was eager. But so was Dean, and he was all too happy to satisfy and help with both, never breaking their kiss while still somehow getting Cas out of his pants. Once that was taken care of, he began working on his own jeans. As usual, that stupid thing wouldn’t budge, Dean unable to open it with just one hand. Of course. Damnit. Huffing out a laugh at the stupid situation and his own clumsiness, he used both hands, hovering over Cas for a moment without being able to steady himself.
The sale was planned to last at least two hours, maybe a bit more if need be. Or less, if they were sold out before then. The way the first half an hour of the sale went, Dean was pretty sure that second one was going to be the most likely option.
Dean wasn’t stupid. He had known her for most of his life and he knew what Lydia wanted from him. A few months ago, he might have considered her as an option. But really, Lydia was not someone he could see a future with. Not that she wasn’t lovely and all, she was nice enough, but Dean knew she could not make him happy.
“Hard?” Dean interrupted, trying not to get too distracted by how close Cas was standing to him. The task at hand needed his full attention. “Cas, that’s like comparing apples with cherries. They are both perfect in their own way and they both make a hell of a filling for pie.” Yes, Dean Winchester would always find a way to bring pie into a conversation. “But they’re still completely different. It’s not that it’s hard, it’s that it’s not possible.”
Some weird feeling instantly spread inside of Dean, but it was gone the moment Cas replied with a nonchalant, “No,” not giving Dean a chance to examine and name the feeling. Most likely, he was just saddened that he didn’t know the answers to these questions about Cas’ life anymore. He really did miss his friend.
Yeah, that was one rambled mess. No wonder Cas was squinting at Dean now, eyes full of questions. If Dean was lucky, it was only curiosity about the present itself. If not, Cas was most likely able to read all his emotions, all the feelings he had for him.
Once they made it, Cas stopped to catch his breath and Dean carefully let go of him. He kept one hand close, just in case Cas toppled over or collapsed or something.
He liked Michael and Gabe’s Fallen Angel as well, even though he was pretty sure it hadn’t been their original plan. Not that he would ever know for sure – the three of them might be friends, but when it came to things like these contests, their friendship ended, the design of their snowman a well kept secret. But he knew his friends well enough and if he had to guess, he would have bet that they’d tried to build a real angel. Not one with broken wings, but oh well.
That night, Dean sat down with the first book of the series Gracie loved to pieces. He’d read it once before, many years ago, just to check if it would be okay for Grace to read at such a young age since it was actually meant for young adults. He’d deemed it alright for her, thankfully. Back then, he’d only skimmed over it, and still, something had caught his attention here and there, planting the first seeds of suspicion into him.
“Shhh,” Dean soothed, never stopping his slow kisses. If that was really his only worry, Dean could take that away from him easily. Pausing between each kiss, he mumbled against Cas’ lips, “No one will come. They’re all at the main house. This here is Gracie’s and mine and she won’t leave her foal tonight.”
Dean swallowed hard but chose to ignore Michael. For now. He knew if his friend really wanted to talk, there would be no hiding from him. He simply hoped it wouldn’t be today. Not before he had been able to have another serious talk.
Dean felt a knot form in his own stomach, bile slowly rising. Still, he didn’t interrupt as C continued to write.
But yeah, of course he was not telling the full truth either. But, there was no need to ruin his friends’ trip. They had been looking forward to this for many years, saving up every penny they had. Now they had even reached Germany and Dean knew Jo had been looking forward to this stop of their trip in particular. If Charlie would let her, Jo would spend the weekend trying one German beer after another, along with all the great food they had heard so much about.
“I- think I need another drink,” Dean finally decided, pulling them all out of their thoughts. “Anyone else? Harry - how about a decent whiskey? And Alice - cup of tea?”
“Point being,” Claire continued as if he hadn’t said anything. “The whole situation was pretty funny to watch, especially when your two uh...
It didn’t matter, because he had loved Lisa, he had done right by her, and that was all they needed to know.
“Cas!!” he yelled out again, panic, frustration, and fear beginning to fuel him. “God damnit! Answer me!”
😘 I love you, thank you so much for being my alpha-reader and for kicking my ass to bring this story to an end 🥰
This was worse than his personal life influencing his mood to a degree that he was an asshole to his students.
“Eileen, it’s been thirteen years. Do you really think after all this time, he would still harbor those feelings for me?”
Cas would hate him to all eternity if this man caught them like this - caught them in a situation that would definitely bring gossip down upon their heads - on Cas’ head! All before they could have a chance to actually talk about… whatever this hopefully could be.
enjoy them once he was gone again, of that Dean would make sure. Therefore, instead of thinking of the man, he let Cherry fly over the snowy path and enjoyed the refreshing and cleansing sensation of the cool wind blowing all around him.
Dean had a hard time getting up the next morning. Last night’s revelation - while not a concept completely foreign to him - was still mind-boggling.
. These things are in the past and Cas is only here for the holidays. He’ll be gone again in a month.” Ignoring how his heart squeezed at that thought, he lowered his voice even further as he went on. “I’ll just have to live through the few times we run into each other, and that’s it. So stop blowing this up and out of proportion, got it?”
It wasn’t until his jaw began to hurt that he slowed his movement. Very soon the change seemed to register in Cas’ mind, Dean finding those beautiful blue eyes on him once more. The grip in his hair tightened and right away, Dean understood that Cas was pulling him off of his cock, reacting to Dean’s growing unease.
close. Maybe it wasn’t that much of a surprise that Cas would trust his siblings with such a secret.
“Alright,” came the whisper and somehow, it calmed him even further. “I got you,” Cas promised. “Just relax, I got you.”
He hugged her close, knowing she only needed the reassurance, not the actual confirmation. Harry and Alice had not yet booked their tickets home, planning on staying a bit after their trip without the worry of an expiration date.
The only reason for Dean to get up and go for his ride on Saturday morning was the thought that maybe now, on the weekend, Cas might go for a run again. It was stupid, he knew that, but he still couldn’t stop his heart from hoping.
The moment I wrote the last word (which happened to be for the scene at the town square in chapter 29), I started laughing hysterically until I cried and then laughed some more 😂
Tears were welling up in Dean’s eyes as he read all that C had to tell him. He had been so close to losing his soulmate, so close to losing the one person that meant more to him than anyone else. He was shaking with emotions, with fear and relief, tears now running freely down his face.
Dean took a long sip from his whiskey. When he looked back up, he saw Sam’s worried gaze on him. Sending him a silent warning, Dean drained the rest of his drink.
Dean’s brain was obviously not fully awake yet, it took him longer than it should have to take the entirety of the situation in. Then, he stepped forward, pulling Amara into a short hug.
Satisfied with his idea, Dean got to his paperwork to at least see what needed to be taken care of before Monday. It wasn’t as much as he’d feared and soon enough, he was able to finish for the day without feeling guilty.
Dean looked at her, reaching to cradle her face in his palm, pulling her closer to press a kiss to her forehead. Closing his eyes, he uttered one of those typical grown-up sentences he had always prayed he would never have to use on his kid. “You don’t understand this yet. It’s– it’s not always this simple.”
There were chuckles all around the room, Cas and Dean joining in. Thankfully, his daughter had given him an out and Dean was more than happy to take it. He raised his hands once more and muttered, “Can’t argue with that, I give up,” - apparently much to Cas and Gracie’s delight.
Not questioning himself or his decision, Dean leaned back down to capture Cas’ lips in yet another kiss. “I want to feel you,” he whispered against them, hoping against hope that he didn’t sound as shy as he suddenly felt, even though there was no need for that. “All of you.”
Thankfully, this wasn’t a complete lie. He could have lived with waiting for a bit longer to talk about it, but this moment was probably better than most.
“It’s just…” When she fully turned towards him, body and all, Dean knew he was in deep trouble. “I really,
somewhere in the general direction of the bathroom and the next moment, the bed was sinking with Cas’ weight as he crawled back into Dean’s waiting arms. Shuffling around enough to not only get them comfortable but also pull the blanket out from under them, Dean made sure they were both covered before he pulled Cas impossibly closer. Yes, he had always been a big cuddler and no, he was not ashamed of that.
A warm towel brushed over his stomach and then gently cleaned his softened dick and maybe he let out a quiet moan, maybe not. Dean wasn’t sure. He couldn’t be sure of much anymore, barely holding on to consciousness. Still, he noticed when Cas’ presence disappeared and blindly, he reached out for him, catching his wrist in one lucky strike.
Neither did Gabe say anything. He had given him a worried gaze when he returned, but when Dean shook his head minutely - a clear notion to keep his mouth shut and not say anything - Gabe did just that. He handed Krissy a bundle of money, telling her to keep the change as a donation for their trip - for which all his students thanked him, like the good kids they were - and wished them fun on their trip to New York. With a clap on Dean’s shoulder, he left his place behind the tables, took his ten bags of cookies - apparently, he had been busy while Dean was gone - and left.
“We just wanted to say… we know that you loved Lisa and she knew that as well – but we’re also sure that she would want you to be happy
Speaking of his little devil, she was just coming back, Cas in tow, and while she seemed to be the perfect sunshine to probably anyone else, Dean could read right through her, of course. His daughter was
Gracie’s babbling did not stop on their drive back to Stars Hollow, her need to have Harry and Alice clued in on all the happenings in her life seemingly endless.
I have to admit, I personally love that scene in the town square even more now that we saw Dean's side as well - and all the people who were there 😁 ... how about you?
“Exactly! He was there, opening his heart and I … I just let him run away without even apologizing.” He had arrived in the kitchen and got their mugs out, having to force himself not to bang the cupboard shut. He really didn’t want to wake Grace.
, Dean kept the catching-up to a minimum. With a final hug for Emma, he said his goodbyes and made his way over. He couldn’t tame his smile as he finally joined Gracie and Cas at their usual table.
All further thoughts were silenced the moment he opened the drawer of the bedside table because… alright! Cas had… wow, he
“I think I can handle my granddaughter, thank you very much. Now, quit stalling, I’m sure the movie’s about to begin. Chop-chop.”
With his senior class, it was even easier. He simply let his students get distracted by the Christmas cookie sale they had planned for the Friday right before Christmas. If they really wanted to go to New York for their final field trip, they needed all the money they could get, hence their campaigns to raise money needed to be planned very well.
It was only then that Dean paid attention to the phone call, sure that Cas hadn’t really been able to follow it. Still, the man replied with an even sounding, “Miss you too, Gracie. Bye,” before holding the phone back and for Dean to take.
What was he even doing here? It was Christmas Morning and his family was at home and probably worried sick. Worse yet, his girl was waiting for him.
By the feel of it, Dean suspected that there were two items wrapped up, so he put the bundle in his lap and then carefully began ripping the Christmas paper apart, uncovering indeed two items. They were wrapped again but obviously more for protection than suspense.
Aside from his own resolve, it was pretty easy to keep any thoughts at bay through the morning, since Sam and Eileen kept their promise and showed up just as father and daughter had finished their late breakfast.
And if that meant going through more pain because Cas would ultimately reject him – then Dean would be brave and suck it up and maybe at least feel lighter in the knowledge that Cas knew.
“Nope,” Dean confirmed… but then couldn’t help himself to add with a tiny smirk, “Even though I would have had a few options, let me tell you.”
“Merry Christmas, jerk,” Sam replied with a grin while Eileen simply rolled her eyes with a fond smile on her lips, standing up on tiptoes to press a kiss to his cheek.
Gracie’s voice was softer again and Dean loosened the embrace so they could look at each other once more.
Barking out a bitter laugh, Dean shook his head. “After thirteen years? Come on, Jo. This isn’t a Nicholas Sparks movie, okay? In the real world, people actually
There was a long pause before any words came back. So long so, it had Dean worrying his lips until they hurt and still he didn’t stop. Needing the pain to distract him from the fear slowly bubbling up inside of him. When the reply came, it wasn’t what he had expected – even though he probably should have. He should’ve known his soulmate would be understanding.
Getting his daughter to bed that night was hard, as she was constantly babbling about how awesome Castiel was and the fact that she would get a signature from C. S. James. In the end, it was only his threat that he would keep Cas from doing exactly that for her should she not go to bed
“Remember senior year?” Michael finally broke the silence and Dean had to think about the question for a moment. There had been a lot going on back then. Before he could ask, Michael clarified, “Rhonda Hurley.”
Damnit indeed. He remembered those days. Remembered being a young, good-looking teacher. The weight of the parents’ concerns, something that was hard to forget. The guilt never far, no matter how hard he pushed it down. There was no reason to feel guilty, it wasn’t like he was actually
There came a happy little noise from Cas, but otherwise, they stayed quiet for a moment, just soaking up each other’s warmth. That was until Cas leaned back and looked at him with a raised eyebrow. “So, how exactly
When the shock about all this shot through him, when he even looked up to see it there, the innocent little mistletoe…
Dean thanked God every single day for having every guardian angel in Heaven watching over her that day.
Meanwhile, Dean made his way around the car, patiently waiting for his daughter to recognize his presence as well. Once she did, she flung herself into his arms.
“Well,” Claire finally began. He should have known she would be the first to man up. “You see, Mr. Winchester... we. Well, we...”
Dean’s eyes went wide, his mind going back to the evening in question. Had it really been only two weeks? It felt more like two years, to be honest. So much had happened since then and when Cas twisted his head to look up at him, Dean could see his surprise reflected in his boyfriend’s gaze.
“If only he would find a nice young man. It really doesn’t do him good to still be crushing on a man that is so unreachable for him.”
“Come on, Dean. Just because you wouldn’t admit to them back then or might not have been able to name them, the feelings for Cas were already there. Are you really going to deny it?”
, Jo,” he greeted them back in what little German he had picked up. Really, having two enthusiastic friends who had wanted to at least
Pulling his thoughts back to the present, Dean looked around – because for his daydream to become reality, he actually needed to find his boyfriend first. Which turned out to be a much harder quest than he thought it would be. Aside from his search, he also had to keep a close eye on Grace, who was looking around to find their favorite Shurley as well.
Letting Cherry fly over the snowy path really did help clear his mind. His stomach only dropped minutely when they came to the crossroads but there was a feeling in him that pulled in the right direction, just as Eileen had predicted. He didn’t hesitate when he lead Cherry on the right path.
Thankfully, Charlie soon had to get back to her apartment to have a quiet environment for a Zoom meeting. It meant she wouldn’t bother him with more questions Dean didn’t have any answers to. With no interest in sitting alone, Dean soon packed up his stuff and followed suit to his own car. Stealing one last glance at Mr. Novak.
Looking back at his daughter, Dean could only stare for a moment. His girl, wise beyond her years. Somewhere in his life, he must have done something good enough for him to be gifted a little angel.
Dean couldn’t help it, his smile only stretched further and he half-heartedly hoped his blush wasn’t all that noticeable through the screen. “Thanks, guys.”
Cas looked as though it didn’t matter anymore what he was about to say, or even that he was saying it.
The second was over all too soon as Cas turned towards the stairs, keeping his head down. It didn’t keep Dean from staring.
“Maybe. But the reasoning still stands: ask a teenager on the street and I bet you fifty bucks more of them will know the name Jane Austen than the name Kurt Vonnegut.”
“Oh, oh. Do we need to keep an eye on you, boy,” Miss Patty was the first to speak, the whole panel of judges chuckling.
When Cas nodded and then seemed to study Dean’s face – or most likely his reaction – very closely, Dean did the same for a moment, all the while contemplating how he was going to answer. Could he simply tell him not to worry about it? That they would talk about it eventually but maybe not right now? That there were a lot of things they really needed to discuss but it all could wait for later?
Cas was nowhere in sight and there was no way for Dean to know if he was even here – had Cas even been the one to allow him upstairs? Had it been Zar? Or worse yet, had Cas let him come upstairs only to let Zar rip into him?
Given the late – or early – hour and all the stress of the day, it took Dean a moment. Once he saw Gracie’s grin in Cas’ direction and his answering one, Dean connected the dots. Right. One of Cas’ main characters was named
came Gracie’s sweet voice and Dean instantly smiled again. His daughter simply had the effect on him
Dean’s smile widened at her words and the pure delight in her voice. Throwing a last glance around his classroom, he picked up his things, switched off the lights, and left the room.
God, he fucking loved his students. No matter how annoying, and tedious, and all-around hell they could be sometimes - they were truly little angels in disguise.
It had nearly killed him, but Dean also understood Michael’s reasoning. He was just watching out for his brother, Dean knew. He would have done the same for Sam.
Inias – well, yeah he certainly was good looking and he had some of Cas’ dorkiness. But again, no feelings that Dean could think of.
“Auntie, do we still have some Angel Cookies? I’m really craving them right now,” she explained, one hand on her belly.
The smile on his lips pulled wide as the memories of last night came floating back to him. He might not know what woke him this early but he also didn’t care when it meant he could cuddle close to Cas again and fall back to sleep with his arms wrapped around the man of his dreams.
Half climbing, half sliding down the hillside, Dean concentrated back on where he put his feet, every few yards stopping to search for Cas.
There was none of that now – and still, those eyes were lacking all the warmth and the feeling he had come to see over the last couple days.
Dean jerked his head around, watching as a young girl, maybe eight or nine, jumped into her father’s arms. She didn’t even sound like Grace… but the happy screech was enough to finally pull Dean fully back into himself.
There was still a slight possibility that Cas’ aunt didn’t know everything about his life - but she looked like she knew what she was talking about, so Dean wouldn’t question it. For now.
. He made good use of the elevator ride, crowding Cas into one corner and pressing as close as humanly possible. He had to keep him warm, after all, even if that meant kissing him breathless.
While Dean had been distracted by that captivating gaze, Cas had lowered himself back over Dean and for the first time, their cocks touched without thick jeans in the way and
“Cas?” he asked, putting on a bit of his teacher-voice. “Don’t you wanna try?” he added, gesturing meaningfully down at his daughter once he had caught Cas’ attention.
The movement pulled another moan from Cas and it was only when Cas’ hands wandered from Dean’s hips to his shoulders, his fingernails digging into them, that Dean became aware of himself again. Of his heavy breathing and the beating of his heart; of the slight tremble in his legs and how his hard cock was painfully pressed against the confines of his jeans. Of the feeling of another man’s dick in his hand. There were too many sensations and emotions engulfing him all at once, too many to pick apart and name individually. So he gave in to the most prominent one, leaning in to kiss Cas again, deep and full of need and passion.
When they reached the place reserved for the Stars Hollow High Cookie Sale, Dean hugged Gracie before he sent her off with Cas, sending him a thankful smile. He didn’t trust many people with his daughter - everyone knew that - and leaving her at Luke’s with Cas was one thing. Sending her off to explore the fair with him… it
Since Harry and Alice were staying in Bobby’s guest room, they had decided to have dinner and family time in the main house tonight. This was also so Dean and his in-laws would not have to worry about keeping anyone awake with their conversation since Bobby slept on the third floor - in the old attic which he had rebuilt to his own liking.
It didn’t matter though because Dean quite liked it this way… and his heart squeezed painfully when the unbidden question popped up if Cas would have liked it too. Too tired to keep his thoughts and desires in check, he picked up the pencil again and quickly wrote under the picture what was deep in his heart.
They were so quiet, he was certain he could hear a pin drop. He had made sure to keep his tone light so as not to scare them again. He didn’t
For just a second, he could read Cas’ face like an open book – screaming of hurt again, of disgust, but worst of all, screaming of a deep feeling of betrayal – and it choked him right up. Unable to move, he could do nothing when Cas took a sidestep, pushed past him, and rushed from the room; noticing only as an aside how he had actually caged him in during their exchange. No wonder Cas hadn’t moved before. No wonder he had kept staring at Dean.
Thankful to have his daughter as a safe haven, his gaze wandered towards her, trying to ignore Cas’ presence.
They stayed in their bubble of happiness and warmth until the clock had almost reached midnight. If anyone had asked Dean, he would’ve gladly stayed in this spot forever, watching the fireworks go off in the distance. But Gabe’s nagging and begging was the needle that burst that bubble. Well, partly. There was hardly anything that would cease their happiness that night. As for the warmth, Dean decided to take the blanket with him as they all stepped off the porch and into the garden. Following Gabriel, who of course insisted they had to shoot their own fireworks.
Now with Cas in the picture… yeah, Lydia didn’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell. Even if nothing ever happened between them.
Dean didn’t need to think about that before he nodded. “I’ve been falling for them for years now, yes.”
Dean was seething at this point, trying not only to reign in his anger but to calm his heavy breathing. The more he did, the more Cas’ scent engulfed him and as much as he liked that, right now it did not help him keep a clear head.
Seeing his daughter hugging Cas to an inch of his life before smacking a kiss on his cheek and then taking his hand to pull him over to the stage – it all made Dean’s smile grow impossibly wide. He was sure his face would be hurting later but he’d stopped caring about all that somewhere along the way. Instead, he clapped along with the others as first Gracie, then Cas entered the stage. Grace had a mock-serious gaze on her face and Dean quickly schooled his own to match his daughter’s, making the crowd laugh. But hey, if his Pumpkin wanted to make this a serious affair, who was he to deny her.
Once again, the old yearbook was in his hands as was the letter of recommendation he had written for Cas. After a while of simply staring at them, he put all of it down and picked up the shopping bag next to his desk. Quickly, he pulled out the card and the DVD - glad once more that his daughter had insisted on finding a present for Cas.
Because the man in front of him – dressed in only a fluffy bathrobe with a very clearly naked chest underneath – was definitely
Despite the little detours against various walls, they made it to the bathroom eventually and – okay, now
Cas was really here, he was safe, he was in Dean’s arms, he had kissed him back, and God damnit, why did Dean have to be a responsible adult? Carefully, not wanting to startle the wonderful man in his arms, Dean leaned his forehead against Cas’, hand still cradling his face.
But Cas’ blue eyes were still fixed on him and there was no way Dean could think clearly right now. Especially not when Cas murmured his next words, his soft breath ghosting over Dean’s neck.
Smiling like a fool, he let out a little shriek of happiness, before getting up and getting ready for the rest of the day. For a day he would probably walk around on cloud nine.
Swallowing hard, Dean forced himself to take three calming breaths as he killed the engine. Cas’ Camaro was still in the driveway, he hadn’t left yet, so that was good. Dean still walked a bit quicker towards the entrance. He needed answers but mostly, he needed to know Cas was alright.
“Pass,” he rasped out, turning back to the board. He cleared his throat, needing a moment to be able to collect himself. He could hear them, of course. Could hear all the murmuring and suppressed reactions to what he had just inadvertently revealed.
“Besides: why would I choose a British snob when my high school teacher that I’ve been crushing on my whole life just confessed his love for me?”
Getting up from his bed, Cas carefully made his way over to his desk, still mindful of the injuries he carried away from the accident. He had downplayed it a little bit for D – no need to worry his soulmate too much. Sitting down at his desk, he pulled out the notepad with the colorful sticky notes, scribbling down the words and the date before adding the post-it to the little box where he kept some of the most wonderful things D had ever written to him.
Shifting his hips slowly, he let their cocks brush against each other while he still leaned down, devouring Dean’s mouth. Strong hands, rough from years of work, gripped and guided him and he easily gave in to the rhythm they set. Only breaking for a moment to lean over and get some lube from his bedside table, one of Dean’s hands already sneaking its way over to his ass, grabbing it tightly.
Nothing to influence your own destiny. Nothing that might help you actively search for your other half. It was mean, it was unfair, but those were the rules of soulmates.
“How about you go for a ride, then? Clear your head. And if Cherry leads you on the path to the Shurley mansion, then maybe it’s decided for you.”
Next Chapter will be up tomorrow and you might wanna keep the tissues stocked for that... just saying 🥺
Since they could be sure they were far away from prying ears, Dean was not surprised when it didn’t take long for Alice to steer the topic towards Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, almost hugging his daughter for breaking the weird spell that had been put on him. With one last nod towards Cas, Dean hurried after Gracie, taking a deep breath of fresh winter air the moment he stepped outside.
Giving in, Dean’s arms tightened as he switched the reins into just his right hand, letting his left one wind around Cas so he could hold him tightly against his own body, forcing himself to ignore what the close contact did to him. He relaxed his body into Cherry’s pace, forcing Cas to do the same.
This was from Gracie’s favorite stationary. But as the stains on the back told him, it was from the set that got ruined about two years ago when she had spilled her tea all over her desk. She had been so upset that Dean had bought her the same stationery the very next day.
It stayed that way for most of their drive until they had almost made it all the way back to the ranch. As he took the turn from the main road onto the sidestreet that would lead them to their home, Gracie turned towards him.
By the time she finished talking, Dean had pulled up into the driveway. Switching off the engine, he stayed like that for a moment, hand still on the keys in the ignition, taking a deep breath.
He could see him taking a deep breath while he also leaned heavily against the suitcase. It looked as if he was bracing himself and he looked so… so
Any further words were stuck in his throat, because all of a sudden, wide blue eyes were looking right back at him, very obviously startled.
“Okay, first, while I think your agreement with C is kinda cute and romantic… have you ever thought about these details? Like, at all? How are you supposed to find each other when you don’t ever give someone a chance?” Dean didn’t reply to that, so Charlie went on. “And second, did you realize you just solely talked about meeting a guy? What gives?”
When the movement slowed, Dean became aware that his eyes were closed, falling shut as he’d taken it all in. But it meant not being able to see Cas and the glorious picture he displayed and that was simply unforgivable. So Dean forced open his eyes, gazing at the vision right on top of him. Cas seemed like he enjoyed every second of this, which gave Dean indescribable pleasure in return and when Cas was finally fully seated in his lap, pausing for a long moment, Dean followed his urge to touch and to map out those gorgeous features.
Deciding that he had pondered enough about the topic - enough to last him a lifetime - Dean got up and started on his morning routine.
“Amen,” the room replied as one and Dean lifted his glass, along with everyone else, toasting Chuck before they all drank to that.
It was always fun to get ready for Sunday dinners with the Shurley clan. Grace had the opportunity to dress up every other week and feel like the princess she really was. Since Sam had brought Eileen into the family, the ladies would usually spend a while in Gracie’s room getting ready, the only thing to be heard being giggles and gushing noises. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean would sit in the living room and watch football, Bobby usually joining them “just because the screen’s bigger.” They let him believe they didn’t know better. Soon enough, the men would get ready as well, Dean always picking one of his nicer suits, letting Gracie decide on the tie. Maybe it sounded weird to some, but Dean actually liked this family tradition of dressing up for Sunday dinners. Especially during the holidays, it added a nice touch.
“Three?” Grace replied, her voice turning hopeful. It had long since become a tradition between them that Gracie would be allowed to finish up to the next chapter break. After all, Dean wasn’t unreasonable. He was a bookworm himself and he knew how terrible it was to leave a story in the middle of a scene. However, chapter breaks didn’t always guarantee reasonable breaks.
Eileen began, before shortly reaching for his hand with both of hers. He hadn’t even realized that he hadn’t been able to look her in the eye, but he did now. As soon as she had his full attention again, she let go of his hand and continued to sign.
“No! Dean, stop!” Cas demanded, pain once again written all over his face. But there was also… disbelief? “I am not mad at you. And I never was.”
He could tell that this wasn’t answer enough for the kids but he didn’t care. If they wanted him to elaborate, they would have to use their second question.
There was that itching feeling again, but Dean ignored it now, knowing that he should give these two people much more credit than he had. Not shying away from their gazes, he took a deep breath before answering.
“This place totally suits you,” he commented after a while, still looking around instead of at Cas, who was currently working in the kitchen heating up their pizzas. He didn’t see it but he was sure he now had the man’s gaze fixed on him, so he continued. “It has style, looks classy, and still has a touch of coziness.”
Within a heartbeat, he stepped back from Cas, putting space between them once more, as much as it hurt to do so. Before his thoughts had even caught up completely - before his mind could process what he was doing - he was moving for the end of the alley. All he knew was that he had to defuse whatever this old student of his might have seen. Needed to steer him away. Needed to protect Cas.
Looking down at his desk, Dean was happy to find it cleared of any immediate papers. Obviously, anything important towards the reports had long been handed in, as the students had all gotten their cards today. So all that could have been left were minor stuff, long-term projects that would count towards the final grade. But even that was all mostly gone. There was only one stack he had gotten out in the hopes of
Watching him closely, Dean was sure he saw something change in Cas. He saw him slam up some inner walls and Dean didn’t know what to make of it. He stopped trying to interpret every little piece of body language when Cas’ next words slammed into him like a wrecking ball.
“That still influences literature and even the cinematic world to this day,” Cas interrupted, his hands flying so quick to sign along that he could have been Italian, wildly gesturing with his hands.
Even without this technicality… it wasn’t as if a simple ‘I love you’ always guaranteed a happy ending. This wasn’t a movie or one of Gracie’s books. This was real life and sometimes, feelings simply weren’t reciprocated. No matter how Dean wished he could shield Grace’s innocent view on the matter – there simply was no way to do so.
“Dean, every New Yorker knows that the best pizza is just around the corner. A small, local business. Some family-run, hole-in-the-wall corner shop. I mean, you’ll never have all New Yorkers agree on which one that is exactly, but every true New Yorker will tell you that they
“Uhm,” he said, dumb as he was. Thankfully, he remembered the map in his hand, finally holding it out.
matter to Dean. It felt like he had been cheating on C and that was something he couldn’t live with and he was dying a little inside every day that he couldn't talk to them about it.
Smiling at the thought of being surrounded by his family, Dean nodded. “That sounds like a perfect plan.”
Ever since they had crashed into each other a little over half a year ago, Dean kept running into the man. Which, of course, wasn’t that uncommon, seeing how frequently Dean had to use the campus library and how Mr. Novak had gotten the job he’d interviewed for, apparently. It was a job at the library where he was responsible for a lot of supervisory tasks as well as taking care of the books, ordering new ones, throwing out some old, and restoring broken ones. Dean was impressed by the passion the man put into his job – which, yes, he might know because he had talked with Novak now and then. Not often, not even enough to be on first-name terms… but enough to know the guy was one bright one. He was smart and had a quick wit and was genuinely a nice guy who loved to help all the students around.
“Because despite all his show, the guy’s still no true New Yorker. Even if he has lived here longer than I have. But again, I think he was just hoping to get some rise out of me. As if I had the energy to care about something trivial like food these past few days,” he added in a small voice, evading Dean’s gaze.
Castiel gently squeezed his waist. “I have to put the fire out,” he murmured, slightly muffled. “And as much as I’m enjoying how nice you are when you’re sleepy, you should actually go to sleep.”
Dean held back an exasperated sigh with difficulty. “Well, if you’re gonna pull an all-nighter, so will I,” he said.
Dean felt a white noise in his head, a fuzziness in his ears and a glowing hot happiness radiating from his entire being. He kissed Castiel as Castiel had kissed him—patient and bold all at once.
“Good to know.” Castiel held out his hand. “It was nice meeting you, Dean,” he said. “And thank you for helping me with my classroom.”
and pulled a towel off the shelf, wrapping it firmly around his waist before stepping out of the shower basin.
He and Cas chatted idly while Cas scrubbed the glass and wiped down the interior, talking about the next semester, or the chickens, or family. Dean asked about Castiel’s trip to Illinois, and Cas went off on a tirade about his brothers and their shenanigans. Dean mentioned he was reading one of the books Castiel had given him, and from the way Castiel’s face lit up, you would’ve thought Dean bought him tickets to the Tinley Park Reptile Convention, which Cas had talked wistfully about before.
Castiel found Friday evening....stressful, to say the least. Question after question, request after request, nonstop “hellos” and “nice to meet yous” and “My name is”s. Castiel recognized a few of his own past students, now in high school, roaming around with their friends or younger siblings.
“Yes, Dean, it’s called Samhain, and, like most Pagan holidays, was stolen by the Christian church and rebranded as their own,” Castiel grumbled, pushing himself more upright. The tiredness hadn’t left his face, but there was a lighter glint in his eyes.
Castiel chuckled. “I do that too. If I don’t—well, Kaia doesn’t interact with anyone else and Claire—”
Only to be interrupted by Dean bounding into his room, hair sopping wet and shirt soaked, dripping water onto his floor.
He stared at his phone, barely believing his luck. Then he rolled out of bed, shivering, and heaved a duffle from under the bed, stuffing random clothing articles into it and grabbing his phone to text Castiel back.
He was flipping them in deft circles around one finger, catching them in his palm before tossing them around again. Their faint clinking echoed in the quiet stairwell.Castiel blew a puff of air out. “More tolerable than middle schoolers.”
“It’s korma. The naan is homemade,” Castiel said, folding his legs underneath him and peering over Dean’s shoulder at the paper.
It was strange: Dean had thought constantly being around Cas—always nearby, brushing elbows and slipping gently past each other, shoulder to shoulder on the couch—would make everything so
Dean pushed the door to the stairwell open, holding it for Cas. “So, how was it?” he prompted as they descended, running one hand down the railing, the other toying with his car keys.
Neither of them moved. It was freezing, Castiel’s ears were red with cold and he was shivering; Dean’s thighs were soaked from slushy snow and they really should get up and finish whatever they were previously doing—

drunk-texted him about wanting to make out!” Sam burst out. “And don’t pull the ‘kiss someone at midnight’ bullshit again,” he warned, when Dean opened his mouth to rebuke him. “I know what happened; I know about the texts. That wasn’t stupid drunk guy stuff.”
FallFest was in full swing by the time Dean swung Baby into a spot near the downtown library, far enough from the festivities that there were ample parking spots, but close enough the walk wouldn’t be dreadful. Castiel tucked his precious thermos down in the footwell before getting out of the car, making sure the lid was securely screwed on tight and wrapping it tenderly in the thick cloth.
Castiel was looking at him, his face barely a foot from Dean’s own, close enough he could almost feel every one of Cas’s exhales. Dean saw his pupils flare wide when they caught his own.
He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but there was something about Cas that just... intrigued him. Sure, he was definitely an attractive guy (and somehow single—not that Dean had asked). But buried under the sweater vests and trench coat and messy black hair, Castiel was completely, utterly different than anyone Dean had ever met—and Dean worked in public education.

He shut his phone all the way off and buried himself farther into his blankets, letting out a long (only slightly regretful) sigh and picking up his book again.
“What music were you playing earlier?” Castiel asked as they rinsed plates and measuring spoons in the sink. “I liked it.
“Huh,” was all Dean could say, before unlocking Castiel’s room for her and flipping the lights on. Dean thought maybe he’d been here and then left for some reason—did Dean miss an email about a staff meeting?—but Castiel hadn’t even arrived yet. His leather briefcase wasn’t hanging on its hook and his tell-tale beige trench coat wasn’t slung over his desk chair.
with one hand on Dean’s thigh and one moved from his shoulders to his cheek, his lips to Dean’s own.
“It’s unfortunate school got cancelled,” Castiel murmured, gazing at the hearth. The last glowing embers reflected beautifully in his eyes, giving the blue a glassy, glazed look. Dean hadn’t noticed it before, but the bags under Cas’s eyes were more pronounced than ever, accentuated by the low lit room. He hadn’t been sleeping at all, at least for a good few nights.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. Dean was starting to hate how he could do that. “You didn’t hear Petunia yowling at nine this morning?”
Dean realized he was staring and blinked a couple times, giving his head a little shake and returning to his lunch.

Castiel’s stern face looked like it was taking too much effort, though; his throat bobbed when he swallowed and his eyes flicked down more than once.
Dean sighed to himself, hanging his jacket on its peg and tossing the borrowed gloves in the designated basket.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “What do you want me to say? Congratulations? You’re probably the last person on the planet to figure it out, dude.”
Dean had resumed his regular spot on Castiel’s living room couch, laptop and papers arranged around himself as he worked through his second block’s United States History.
“Well, Cas hasn’t made a move, so I’m assuming you did.” She said, very matter-of-factly. “So, what have
Dean stopped by the school the next day after realizing he’d left a few boxes of backup books at home the day before—books with

was also hilarious, which sort of ruined the lovely post-coital glow they had going on when Dean told him.
“It was the first time we kissed,” Castiel murmurs reminiscently, leaning into Dean just a little more.
The clock dinged quarter-passed and Dean heaved himself out of his chair, checking one last time that the hallways were devoid of students.
However, reading the exact same thing over and over again, just in different words, wrung the brain out more than Dean had predicted. By their third break, Dean was regretting offering to help Cas out, and too tired to feel selfish about thinking it.
“The power’s supposed to be back tomorrow, right?” Castiel murmured after a few long minutes, occasionally filled by the last few feeble pops of dying embers.
Fuck, who had he texted last night? He couldn’t remember too much past….champagne? The countdown? Daring Jo to chug the expensive shit Ellen brought?
“I do feel a bit odd about making pie today,” Castiel mentioned, chopping chocolate bars into bite-sized chunks while they discussed the
“Both, but mainly the dogs.” Castiel swirled soapy water around a coffee mug. “It was a fitting death, though—this is the last mug—but I don’t think I’d wish it upon anyone.”
“Yup.” They fell into step again, walking to their own cars across the parking lot. “See you in... twenty minutes?” Dean said, when he reached the Impala. “Everyone’s been dying to meet you, you know, officially.”
It was a good deal less crowded than the downtown area, but still busy. Most of the tents were those Dean recognized from the Saturday markets (Sam had wheedled him into going to one a few years ago; he didn’t know Dean kept returning every weekend) and, of course, there was a large collection of bright orange pumpkins displayed on wooden pallets .
Castiel opened his mouth to answer, closed it, and then sighed, drooping in his chair. He rubbed his face with his hand and groaned, “I had to give Marcy a bath.”
“That’ll get the gossip going,” Dean muttered to himself, but pulled the shirt on anyway. It was a little tight in the shoulders, but otherwise fit nicely.
Dean dropped his gaze to the mug in his hands again, the burning, boiling riot of feelings finally bursting forth in his chest, a tidal wave of terror and solace and truth and a million other things flooding him, racing like flames down his skin.
He was about to knock on Castiel’s half-closed door when he heard the hiss of angry voices from inside.
“Glad you could make it!” Dean said jovially, clapping him on the back and sitting down, scooching aside so Castiel had a spot. “This is Cas, everyone!”

Sammy, “useless artifact” his ass), otherwise he’d have no updates about when the heat was due back on.
“There’s coffee and bacon in the kitchen, if you’d like some,” Castiel said, still standing awkwardly in the doorway. “I can fry up some eggs, too. ”
Cas was gazing back at Dean, sleepy-eyed, lips parted just a little, hair rumpled on top and pressed flat from where it squished against the sofa pillow. His cheeks were pink, and the dancing glimmer in his eyes shone bright from the firelight and something purely
Dean shrugged, finishing the last bite of his sandwich. “Might see if I can get him to watch Friday the Thirteenth.”
“’M getting up,” Dean grumbled, rubbing his eyes and blinking blearily. Petunia leapt to the floor when he wobbled upright, yawning and stretching deeply, feeling a wave of
Dean swallowed, feeling a lump in his throat. “Thanks, Cas,” he croaked, because who knew such a small kindness could do such wonders?
Dean glanced ahead, where his brother and Cas were milling around one of the tents. “Yeah, I guess,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck.
It was only when Dean got back to his room after lunch that he realized he pretty much just asked Castiel out on a date.
“If you’re ready to go, I’ll walk you out. I just got to lock up,” Dean said, and Castiel heard his footsteps heading across the hall and the loud
not staring at Castiel’s forearms. “So—try not to touch the dough so much, the butter’ll melt—you’re saying that failing once doesn’t mean turn tail and run?”
Dean chuckled. “’Course he did. Alright, thanks, Donna. I gotta go, someone lost their Chromebook charger.”
“Dean, hello,” he said, quickly standing. He’d ditched the sweater vest and slacks today, wearing a navy blue knit pullover—
“Mm-hm.” Sam repeated. “So, Jess and I in my car, Charlie and Gilda in theirs, and you and Castiel—”
Sam was quiet for most of the time, watching Dean out of the corner of his eye while they sorted binders and papers and files into differing stacks by class. He could still feel Sam’s eyes on him when they flopped on the couch after the organization, Sam with coffee and Dean with a beer.
Although he did enjoy spending his lunch with Cas nearly every day, Dean’s Wednesday lunch blocks were solely dedicated to eating donuts with Donna and ignoring their jobs for the half-hour period. Donna got the goods from the bakery in town and Dean brought loaded sandwiches from the deli, side of chips and a drink included.
It was after midnight by the time he resigned himself to the fact that he wasn’t getting to sleep that night. He sighed, glaring at his clock in the dark (thank goodness for analog), and reached for his phone. “If this fuckin’ backfires,” he grumbled, forcing his stiff, frozen fingers to type, “I’m moving to Greenland.”
Castiel hummed in approval, nodding slightly to the beat. Dean watched his lips murmur along to the words, smiling, before yanking whatever dish was in Cas’s hands out of his hands and spinning him ‘round. Castiel yelped, gripping Dean’s shoulders, before starting to laugh as Dean twirled him to the song.
Dean scoffed. “‘Course! You know how much I love spending my week with teenagers who have no respect for authority and think they know everything—”
It also helped that Cas joined him for lunch almost every day, and brought with him whatever delicious leftovers he’d made and a kiss on the cheek. Granted, of course, that the classroom was devoid of high schoolers—Dean knew any sign of
Dean snorted, tipping his own crumbly flour and butter mixture onto the countertop and starting to shape it into a disc. “Believe me, I can tell. Just be gentle with it—pie dough ain’t like bread; it combines on its own.”
“I think I was passive-aggressively insulted nearly every day,” Castiel said, frowning. “Either that, or flirted with—are you alright, Dean?"
He was young, probably Dean’s age or just slightly older, but the sweater vest and black slacks ensemble he was wearing made him look ten years older than he probably was. Messy black hair curled behind his ears and swept every which way. Strong, angular features with a hint of scruff around the edges of his jawline contrasted with his eyes—blue in the overhead lights and sloping downwards at the outer corners, giving him a permanently sad, somber expression.
Dean watched him from collecting eggs from the other coop, his chest clenching a little watching Cas compliment one of the chickens on her feather patterns.
“Castiel coming?” Charlie said from his elbow. Dean jumped, whacking his knee on the cabinet under the countertop.
“Seriously though, thanks a million, Cas,” Dean said softly, straightening up and wincing slightly at the twinge in his knee. “I really appreciate it.”
Dean thought he knew Castiel rather well, considering how much time they spent together. There were things he’d picked up over the months. For example, Castiel preferred Columbian coffee to French roast. He didn’t like overly-crispy bacon, preferring it crunchy just around the edges. He mumbled things from encyclopedias and dictionaries and The Economist when he napped (Dean wasn’t the only one falling asleep during Saturday work sessions), most commonly something from the most recent environmental article he’d read. He liked baking more than cooking.
heya, so, chapter two! Small disclaimer: This chapter DOES have one small chunk of Castiel POV. There was supposed to be more, but...life happens, and what can ya do. It
Jess thwacked him with her napkin from across the table. “Hey, we’re trying to help. Don’t be a bitch.”
“So, any plans today?” he asked, sitting down across from Castiel and snagging one of the pieces of toast off his plate.
Charlie shrugged. “You break it, you buy it; you bake it, you can eat as much as you want without facing the consequences.”
Cleo slipped out of his arms and settled primly on her cushion by the hearth when Dean sat down on the couch cushions. Petunia, who hadn’t moved since Dean left for his shower, slinked over and curled into a warm, purring donut on his lap.
He finally settled on saying, his mood somewhat dropping. Enough for him to get up and throw himself together some quick dinner before going back to their conversation while eating. They didn’t stay on that topic for much longer though and by the time Dean was back on the couch, it was light conversation again.
“Did I, now? Well, it was a late night,” Dean replied with a quick glance to the clock on the wall. It was indeed closer to eleven than ten but Dean couldn’t find it in him to mind. “And I guess I’m getting old,” he added with a grin as he pushed himself from the wall to saunter further into the room.
“Because you kept an important promise. You promised him not to tell anyone - and you didn’t. Not even your Dad.”
“Nope, not what I said. I said it’s the right thing to do if you promised someone else to keep their secret. And, of course,” he added as an afterthought, “if you know it’s not something unjust you have to keep a secret. If it’s a secret that makes you uneasy, hell, I expect you to open up to someone.”
“Yes, hello. Ehm… my name’s Dean Winchester and I’m a… ehm… I’m a friend of Castiel James? He lives here, right?”
Before Dean could find an answer to this absolutely weird question – why was his head coming up with these thoughts today? – Cas all but ripped his hands away from Dean, as if the coat had just burned him. Dean didn’t want to let go. For some reason he wanted this moment to last a few heartbeats longer if only to find the answer to his damn question. But just a second later, his hands followed a silent command and let go of Cas’ elbows. The man stepped back hastily, giving him just enough room to step out of the space between the cars.
A kiss was pressed to his lips, tender and sweet, calming him down and only now did Dean realize that his lips had been trembling. He kissed back, chasing him when Cas moved away too quickly. His warm breath was back against Dean’s ear, sending a shiver down his spine.
Dean was quick to join into the general ‘love you’s and ‘goodbye’s but internally facepalmed himself for missing so much of the conversation because he had been day-dreaming about something that most likely would never happen.
They sat like that for a small eternity but Dean had no idea how to let go of her. Not now. Not with all her written words still burning into his mind. Into his soul.
A hand over her mouth finally stopped Charlie’s flood of words. While she was still mumbling behind Jo’s hand, the rest of them were unable to hide their laughter at their friend’s antics.
It was that small gesture, to be honest, that gave Dean… hope? Maybe? Probably? He couldn’t be sure.
The whole time, he tried to stay calm. Tried to really give his daughter the attention she deserved. Tried to ignore the way Cas seemed completely unaffected by Dean being there, other than maybe being annoyed or even uncomfortable.
Under such close scrutiny, Dean had to look away, unable to hold Michael’s inquiring gaze for much longer. Still, he replied in a soft murmur. “Did you really think I slept with your brother because ‘I felt like it’ that night?”
Dean must have spoken louder than he thought, for there was a telltale shushing-noise from somewhere behind them. Ducking their heads, Dean was glad to find that Cas was grinning at him, just as he was grinning at Cas. Still, they both sank further into the chairs, keeping quiet for a while.
He could feel Cas’ hand run up and down his side but didn’t let it distract him as Cas shook his head ‘no’. No, Dean hadn’t read it wrong, they
After thirty minutes, the second shift took over and Dean was amazed by how the time flew by. Looking up and around, he tried to maybe get a glimpse of Cas and Gracie. They should be back from their sleigh ride by now. But the town square and the streets around it were packed to the brim, leaving him no chance to see anything.
Chuckling, Dean checked the clock once more and then grabbed his backpack and hastened to the door as he kept scribbling on his arm.
“Ah, Dean, good thing you’re here,” he heard Taylor call out after he’d already been there for at least an hour. Looking up in confusion, Dean could hardly suppress his laughter when he saw Sam standing in front of Taylor, the most annoyed bitch face in full power.
“And why not?” she asked, sitting back so she could look at him, a challenge in her eyes. “Have you tried it yet?”
“Not like this,” Patty protested, leaning in as if to examine him closely. “There’s something about you. Like a glow or something.”
No matter how hard he reminded himself that his soulmate’s gender didn’t matter, that he would love them either way, that he knew he would still be attracted to them… more and more he pictured a young man. After talking to D all this time, it was what his heart and his gut told him, and who was he to question both those feelings? His soulmate was a man, of that he was sure.
“Noted,” Dean said, throwing a loving gaze at his daughter who was beaming up at him. “We’ll make sure to put it on our list.”
Cas had thought of him again, only this time, it had been all the good memories they’d begun to build. Stealing another kiss from Cas, Dean finally ate his own Angel Cookie, savoring the sweet taste of vanilla and sugar and Cas’ gorgeous lips. Dreaming of the future, hoping they would always work out their misunderstandings, and knowing that this was only the start of many, many more memories to come.
Satisfied, Gracie skipped away from him, calling a, “Bye, Castiel,” back at him. A second later, the whirlwind that was Dean’s daughter had left the patio and Dean was sure he was the only one that heard Cas reply with, “Bye, Gracie …”
Jesus had he failed, he thought as he slumped back in his chair, sure that he had reached his limit of open talks about feelings.
“Mhh, well, yeah. Might have something to do with the fact that I just spent three weeks away from here. And I wasn’t really in the mood to go grocery shopping once I came back home. So I survived on the things Zar brought with him or what we ordered. This is New York, after all.”
Once more looking at his students, seeing all their expectant faces, Dean knew there was no way out of this short of downright shutting them down, maybe threatening them with a pop quiz. The more fuss he made around this, the bigger the issue would become, telling his students that there
That something was what made Dean get up after all, ready to take Cherry out for an earlier ride than usual. True, yesterday he had thought about not crowding Cas and not coming off as a weird stalker… but he
Snorting softly, Dean ducked his head to get back his bearings, his heart swelling with love and appreciation for these two wonderful people.
Despite that, Dean was unable to keep his hands off of Cas. He was finally here, finally with him and while Dean was tired and emotionally drained – not only from the past few hours but also everything that transpired over the past few weeks – he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he fucking
This certainly hadn’t been his plan. No, his plan had been to show himself that that dream had been stupid. That it didn’t mean anything. That he was still only craving Cas’ closeness as a friend and certainly not …
“Did you drive here?” he asked, barely able to stay calm, not even trying to hide his anger. “Completely wasted?”
“Wha– ahahaha,” both women laughed, almost forcibly, as if it was an absurd and funny thought. “No, nonono, we–”
? Or the fact that I confessed my stupid crush on my very straight teacher in front of the whole town?”
A soft smile spread over Cas’ lips but instead of leaning in for a kiss as he so often did when Dean made him smile, he ducked his head. “I see. Well, yeah. I guess our communication hasn’t been the best in the past, has it?”
Headphones in place, Dean searched for one of his favorite porn sites. One he knew also had a section for gay porn. He took his time scrolling through the videos, completely unsure of what exactly he wanted to see. Or even
“Why not?” Charlie answered, looking affronted. “Maybe my theory is true and they can’t survive without us.”
It took a moment for them to get settled, thanks to Cas’ wrist still being in a cast. He could feel Cas’ reluctance as he moved away from where he had sat between Dean’s legs, trying to rest against his chest. Dean was just as reluctant to lose the contact, so he quickly followed and simply settled between Cas’ legs instead, leaning back against his chest and resting his head against Cas’ shoulder. With a content sigh, he let himself settle down, enjoying the feeling of being the little spoon for once in his life.
For that reason alone, he was grateful when a familiar voice called out his name, distracting him from his thoughts. Looking up, he smiled as he saw his old friend Lydia and her daughter Emma step up to him.
“I shouldn’t have pushed you,” Jo mumbled out, only going on when Charlie poked her with an elbow. “Sorry.”
It really wasn’t. He shouldn’t let seeing Cas again distract him to the point that he wasn’t listening to his daughter anymore.
What was he even doing here? Was he seriously running away from this? How would he be able to look his daughter into her eyes like this? He hadn’t even really
Hastily grabbing his phone and his keys and an extra pen, he hoofed it out the door and into his car. Technically, he could run to the park but that would cost him precious minutes and he would be out of breath by the time he got there. He also knew they both faced getting into trouble, the park being closed this time of night – but that thought quickly flew out of his mind and five minutes later, he parked his Chevy right next to the entrance, rushing inside.
“I was about to,” Dean admitted in a quiet whisper and a moment later, Cas moved back just enough so they could look at each other, Cas’ gaze enquiring, searching.
Grace answered with her typical sarcastic, “Ha ha,” yet after rolling her eyes, she actually joined in when Cas started to chuckle, apparently neither of them feeling the need to let Dean in on the joke.
Dean wasn’t even done composing his message to Michael by the time his daughter had moved on to the next topic from her list of ‘things to tell her grandparents’ - Dean had seen her making notes in the car.
Finally though – way too late in the eyes of most of the kids – the whole family and their friends were seated around the living room, the excitement buzzing and the anticipation high.
Gracie’s babbling went on and soon, she was on to another chapter of their lives - Ruby and her expectant foal this time. But not before mentioning that Dean joined them at
“I’m not –” Dean stopped himself, realizing right away that he wouldn’t sound very convincing if he was snapping at Sam. Taking a deep breath, he tried again, forcing himself to stay calm. “I’m not biting your head off, Sam.”
To his amusement – and immense pleasure – sleepy Cas reached for him the moment Dean leaned back up, blindly grabbing for him. He couldn’t suppress the chuckle as he already moved to the door.
“You okay?” he asked, just able to refrain from pulling Cas back into his arms when he saw him shiver. Forcing himself to concentrate, he knew what he had to do. “I just need to get Cherry.”
By the time he shut off his Baby’s engine in the teachers’ lot of Stars Hollow High, Dean had explained the incident to himself. It was actually pretty obvious:
It wasn’t long before Cas came walking down the aisle, eyes on Eileen who was signing something in his direction Dean couldn’t see. But Cas’ reply was a simple,
There was his conversation with Charlie and Jo and how he kind of, somehow, almost, maybe admitted that he was thinking about Cas as more than just a friend. There where those dreams that were downright amazing. Confusing, yes, but also amazing. They gave him a warm feeling and he liked it.
But Michael had never been able to say no to Gracie, just like Dean was unable to do so with Michael’s kids. That’s what uncles were for, right?
Sam only rolled his eyes and then moved over to the booth that sold refreshments. Once he was gone, Dean turned back around to finish up with the fairy lights, chuckling to himself. Neither of the brothers had ever thought they looked much alike. At least not to the degree that one could be mistaken for the other. Yet Sam learned the hard way that most citizens of Stars Hollow didn’t care. Dean had been the older and the louder of the two of them, and most people had known his name by the time he’d been a young teenager. So when quiet, studious Sam had started to get more involved in the town’s activities, he’d most often only been “Dean’s brother”. To some, he’d even only been “Dean”, for whatever reason.
“Well, if Vonnegut is as good as you say,” Cas argued back and Dean could see the challenge in his eyes. “Shouldn’t he be able to beat every other book? Not just those in his own genre?”
“And since we’re being completely honest right now,” he rasped out after a short while, “I haven’t been with anyone at all since–”
“No,” came Jo’s reply instantly, her hand still making sure Charlie couldn’t say a word. “Tell us about the opening. Sam sent us a link to the video last night. Looks like Gracie was amazing.”
Taking a deep breath, Dean tried not to remember that moment all too closely. Then again, he hadn’t thought about it in a long time. He thought about Cas now and then, thought about how he was doing and what had become of him. If he was happy. But it was never much, only little stray thoughts. Now, with Michael calling just to let him know that his little brother was coming back to Stars Hollow for the first time in thirteen years … it seemed to have opened a floodgate.
“So… how do I react to such a question? I shouldn’t lie, but I also can’t spill the secret. So… what do I do?”
Dean could feel the instant desire inside of him spike up from where it always simmered under his skin whenever Cas was close. By the looks of it, Cas saw it too and it took every ounce of willpower for him to not pull Cas into a filthy kiss when he quickly pecked him on his lips. Instead, he let the love of his life get pulled back into a conversation by Gracie, who had just finished her ice cream and was apparently ready to talk about the draft some more. Once again just happily sitting by, Dean watched the two people who were his entire world dissect every part of Cas’ book – knowing that this was the first of many, many family dinners he was now allowed to finally look forward to.
Dean had never known how hypnotic shadowy pattern on the roof could be in the middle of the night. Then again, he’d never before just been lying around awake, night after night, only catching some sleep here and there.
And Dean did just that – wondering if maybe he would meet a group during pride that would be dressed in a similar attire as them.
Dean himself always had to swallow hard to get rid of the tightness in his chest and the lump in his throat.
Well, okay, that was a lie. There had been plenty of opportunities, but Dean had never really felt it. It was weird, actually, thinking about it now. He’d been with so many girls during his teenage years and all the way through college right up until he’d met Lisa. Yet after she’d been gone, he’d never even really tried.
“Max, come on man. Wanna tell me something?” But Max just shook his head. “Krissy?” he went on and once the girl just looked down, he added, “No?” before moving on. “Lily, what has you giggling all morning? Andrew, is my shirt backwards? Is that why you keep staring at me?”
“Ah, they have a night out with Gracie at the fair.” That was not a lie, nope! Not at all. “I... remembered this movie was playing tonight and here I am.”
She stepped up to him and tugged on the lapels of his coat, straightening it out - like he imagined a mother would do to her son before sending him off for the night.
“Get it together, Winchester. Cas coming back is a good thing. Be happy for Chuck and for Michael. Your best friend is happy to have his brother back.”
His climax wasn’t even over when he slammed his laptop shut and squeezed the last of his release from his twitching cock. Still breathing heavily, he rolled out of bed and moved to the bathroom, cleaning himself up in record time. Clenching the sink tightly with both hands once he was done. Damn, he was still trying to catch his breath.
Shutting off the alarm before it would go off, Dean moved to the bathroom quickly while he tried to stay calm. That had
While the others were getting ready, Dean went upstairs to Lucy’s room to pick up his daughter. Only, she wasn’t there.
“Good,” Dean said, nodding. “Because if you go down that path, we all would have to agree that J. K. Rowling is probably the greatest author of all time.”
Dean raised an eyebrow at what he read on his arm and huffed a little laugh. He was about to reply when new words formed on his skin.
Gracie’s calls were somewhat able to pull Dean back to the moment, just in time to open his arm as she pressed to his side, hugging him sideways so they could walk together towards the cars. Dean followed his brother and sister-in-law as if on autopilot, letting his daughter babble away happily.
By the time Sam and he had cleaned up the table, Eileen had already gotten them two beers and a glass of red wine for herself.
Instantly, Cas’ lips were gone, the man looking at him, appalled. “Oh, hell no, nope! Not gonna happen.”
“I guess it would be fair if you spend some time with your family, right?” Dean finished the thought Cas was clearly mulling over in his head.
Dean raised an eyebrow, hoping Cas would understand that he had lost him – or rather, that Cas wasn’t making sense in the slightest. By the way he rolled his eyes, Cas seemed to easily grasp Dean’s confusion. “We only had it yesterday because I let Zar order. He knows how much I hate that pizza. Speaking of,” he added with a frown, mumbling as if talking to himself, “I’m pretty sure he only did it to get some sort of reaction out of me.”
But he couldn’t. Because Cas didn’t care anymore. Because it would only open old wounds and Cas had made it very clear that he didn’t want Dean anymore. He didn’t want his reassurance or his comfort or anything else.
Anyway! Remember: starting tomorrow, I will post five AC one-shots that are set in the future and while I know it's not ideal because Lumberjack Cookies isn't finished yet, I still hope you'll forgive me. I promised to post them in 2020 and I plan on keeping that promise 😘
His warm shower didn’t really help to get rid of the sour mood and when he accidentally ripped one of his favorite shirts on a nail that was minutely sticking out of the wooden closet, Dean knew it was totally going to be a bad day.
Giving Grace a kiss goodbye once they’d gotten out of the car, Dean made sure people he knew were wandering around the square. Technically, he wasn’t allowed to be here, but he’d be damned if he would leave his Pumpkin alone without checking that she’d be okay. Of course, he didn’t need to worry. Not in Stars Hollow.
Seeing as I'm a native German, I know I could have used this as an opportunity for Jo, Charlie, and Dean to have a full conversation in German. But I figured that would get tiring for you all 😂 and I also wanted to keep it realistic and since I know how hard it is to learn this language, I'm sure they wouldn't be all that fluent in it in such a short time.
“I had a few talks over the past weeks about it,” he continued when he was sure his voice was steady again. “With my closest friends and even with Lisa’s parents; that one really got to me. Because they want nothing more than for me to be happy, saying they knew it would have been what Lisa wanted for me as well. The whole conversation with them started because Gracie had told them about you and they remembered your name.” The lump in his throat grew bigger and bigger and Dean swallowed hard in an attempt to chase it away, fighting against the tears that wouldn’t stop welling up. “Told me I should follow my heart...”
The porn wasn’t the worst he’d ever seen, but it also wasn’t the best. Not that it mattered. It only took a few minutes for him to get him fully hard and then a few more to really let go and sink into the feeling of his hand around his dick, jerking himself off rough and quick.
Dean chose not to comment and instead took Sam up on his offer to help carry all the presents for their friends to Sam’s car. Once the packages were loaded, they joined Bobby in checking on the horses one more time, especially Ruby. She was still doing good, though Bobby had half a mind to stay behind and keep an eye on her. It didn’t take much for Dean to convince him otherwise though, and when the brothers left the barn to get ready, Bobby did the same even as he grumbled a little.
“I’ll make it,” he said as he stood. “I want to see what Bobby has in stock before I settle on a brand. And you,” he added, pressing a kiss to Alice’s hair. “You talk to our boy.”
And still, the man wouldn’t even look at him and Dean couldn’t bear it anymore. Not knowing what possessed him, he reached for Cas’ chin, keeping his touch soft. He didn’t want to hurt Cas, but he needed answers. Carefully but with purpose, he turned Cas’ head, making sure he had no other choice but to look at him.
It seemed like Anna and Crowley were joining them, saying something about their kids getting tired, but the rest stayed and ordered refills from Dean.
! But he also couldn’t help but notice that Novak was exactly his type. Exactly the kind of guy Dean would’ve asked out on a date if it hadn’t been for C… and the pandemic.
It was not the first time Dean wished he could do more for Max. He hated not being able to carry all his students’ problems for them. These were kids -
Hauling Cas with him as he got up, he stopped the moment they were in a standing position, giving Cas time to readjust. Time to slow his pained breathing and unclench his teeth.
Together, hand in hand, they walked towards the first Pride Parade they would finally be able to celebrate together for real. The first of many, many more to come.
