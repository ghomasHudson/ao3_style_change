The rest of the evening passed in relative peace and he managed a rare full night of sleep in spite of the unwelcome reappearance of Mycroft Holmes.
“Why, the men he dated after, well, after you, dear,” she explained and her voice went soft. “He was so heartbroken after you left, Sherlock. It was like living with two ghosts in this flat for the longest time. A little over a year after he started dating again. I’ll admit it was partially on my behalf that he did. He was just so sad and I hated to see him that way. I thought maybe dating someone would help him. I ran into Mrs. Turner’s married ones one afternoon, you know, and they were having a little get together and they invited me. Told me to bring along John. So I did. I tell you, that was quite an undertaking, convincing him to go with me somewhere that wasn’t the shops. But he went with me and he ended up chatting with this nice gentleman for most of the evening. Tall and strawberry blonde, he was. They went out a few times after that. Never came here, though. I don’t think John liked the idea of bringing his dates here.”
“Men. He dated men,” Sherlock said. Molly nodded confirmation.
“Yes, and I was on a case.”
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, attempting to hold back the smile he felt tugging at the corners of his lips until he finally gave in to it. He glanced down, biting on his bottom lip to get his smile back under control before he looked back up at him.
In a rare moment of clarity, Mrs. Hudson seemed to realize she had just revealed more than she meant to.
“Looked similar to what others?” he asked carefully.
“I’ll be there in a moment. You two go ahead,” the taller man answered, not quite meeting John’s eye.
“Yes, I believe we are. If you change your mind-”
Luckily, most of his possessions were already packed in boxes and ready to be moved. Unfortunately,  there was simply no way that Sherlock could move all of his books and laboratory equipment, not to mention his clothes and case files and papers he needed for his work, on his own. He considered calling Mycroft to help, or rather have him send some people to help, but quickly shook off the idea. He didn’t need anything from his brother. Instead, he made his way out the door and put out feelers through his Homeless Network. Anyone who helped him move would get 50 quid.
They sat beside each other quietly for several minutes, just enjoying the simplicity of blue skies, sunshine glittering off the sea, the gentle breeze, and Rosie’s determined hunt for more sea glass and shells. John breathed in deeply and let out a happy sigh.
“Yes, John,
He sighed, running a hand down his face, before letting his gaze flick over the surrounding area. The flowers were placed there recently. He didn’t expect to actually see anyone, but he wondered all the same who they were. He had thought of Molly originally, but maybe they were from Greg? Though perhaps they were from some random fan.
Nostalgic over chicken noodle soup made with tender care by his flatmate. His friend. His John.
It was after a case. A rather grueling one. They had been after their suspect for over a week before they finally caught him.
As he was passing by a cafe that was boasting seasonally festive drinks pretending to be coffee, he noticed him. A man, about twenty yards ahead and walking through the crosswalk, with dark hair and a billowing coat. John felt his body come to a standstill in the middle of the crowd, causing several people to swear at his sudden lack of movement, and one body slammed into his shoulder, jostling him forward and into motion again as his brain kicked back on.
“For cold tea and someone else’s biscuits?” John joked weakly. “Hardly worth thanks, I think.”
His brother was quiet for several moments. “Well, I look forward to meeting this person,” he eventually replied.
“Oh. You two just seem so attuned to each other. I assumed that you were.”
“I do,” he said simply. Sherlock had held up a mirror to John’s heart and revealed what was reflected there. What more could he add?
“You weren’t around the clinic any time today, were you?” he asked before he could stop himself.
The nurse, he suddenly remembered her name was Mary, laughed like that was the funniest thing she had ever heard. He supposed she had a nice enough laugh. John gave a small self-deprecating smile and turned his attention back to his lunch. They were quiet for a couple of minutes while she sipped her tea and John ate.
It was when the jealousy started that ‘It’s all fine’ became harder to maintain. Just small flashes of it at first. A twinge of possessiveness when someone stood too close or held Sherlock’s attention for longer than five minutes. Moriarty had held his attention and there had been an almost obsessiveness about it that rubbed John wrong in many ways. Then The Woman happened and John felt moments of panic and jealousy through that entire interaction. And she had seen it, which scared him most of all. She had looked at him and knew John’s heart the way that Sherlock looked at him and knew his life.
He watched as a blush rushed up into Sherlock’s cheeks, pinkening the pale skin, which only added to the beauty of the man. In lieu of a reply, though, he turned and rummaged in the beach bag for another towel. He found one and stepped up to John, brought the towel up, and dried his hair with a tiny smile.
As he stood under the spray, the hot water relaxing his muscles and his brain, he took himself in hand and gave a leisurely stroke, just to test out the situation, and wasn’t at all surprised to find himself go from half-interested to fully hard in a couple of strokes.
John’s eyes and mouth were soft and full of affection as he looked at him.
“Nothing,” and Sherlock silently cursed himself for how quickly he replied.
“Mrs. Hudson!”
“Yes, you’re right,” he agreed.
“Don’t you want breakfast first?”
A sudden vibration came from his pocket and went down his leg. He pulled the mobile from his pocket and glanced at the message signed by SH. That could only be Sherlock, and he had no idea how he knew John’s number, but then he realized that he wasn’t at all surprised. The message was straight forward.
Then there were the traditions that he hoped to add to their celebrations. Ones that Sherlock enjoyed, and there were a few no matter what fuss the man made about it, and even Mrs. Hudson had a couple traditions she had gleefully pushed on them. There was an orange to be placed in every stocking at her insistence, and a pickle hidden in the tree.
A distant ping! came from his bedroom, drawing his attention from the laptop again. This case was going to take him forever if he couldn’t make himself focus. Unfortunately, everything in his life seemed determined to pull his attention in every direction but the one he needed to be in. At least at the moment. When this was done with he would let the entirety of his considerable brainpower loose on the problem that one John Watson posed.
The lump in his throat grew, blocking his oxygen as he tried to breathe.
When he met John later that evening, he was in an almost giddy mood. He had ended his previous lease with no issue, had managed to convince Molly Hooper to save him some fantastic specimens down at Barts, it was only a matter of time before DI Lestrade came to him for help with these serial suicides, and now he was going to sign a new lease with his new flatmate in his fantastic new flat. Honestly, it was one of the better days he had had in quite a while. The only thing that could make it better would be a triple homicide in a locked room, but he was content enough to not be greedy at the moment.
It was John’s turn to roll his eyes. “You aren’t going to give me a real dare are you?”
The kettle started to whistle, and John swiftly pulled it off the hob to keep the sound from waking Rosie. He prepared their tea, then walked into the sitting room with both cups, not surprised to find Sherlock sitting on the sofa, his nose buried in what looked like some kind of gardening book. He reached a mug out and Sherlock took it from his hands without even looking up.
The presence of Sergeant Donovan at the tape didn’t help his mood, but he breezed past her and brought John along without much trouble. They made their way up to the scene, and it was another moment with Lestrade to ensure that John would be allowed in, as if the detective inspector would actually make a stand against him, and he couldn’t help the smile that rose to his lips when the DI gave in even quicker than he expected. He must be truly desperate.
John was stretched out on a blanket, a paperback abandoned in his lap, as he watched his best friend and daughter as they played in the surf and small tide pool that had formed as the tide shifted. Rosie’s high pitched laughter carried on the wind back to him as she ran and threw herself into the waves while Sherlock kept a steady eye on her should she need his rescue.
“Yes, actually.”
Sherlock tried not to laugh outright at her antics, though he found her enthusiasm rather amusing and it took more self-control than he would have expected. This was her first year with a real appreciation for the idea of an imaginary man breaking into her home and leaving presents, and as ridiculous as he personally found it, he couldn’t deny that watching the wonder in her face as she saw the gifts that were now beneath the tree held its own appeal.
“I mean, it’s Christmas, and that’s supposed to be a time for friends and family, yeah? And I’d honestly rather not see Harry if I can avoid it, which is easy thanks to the postal service and mobile phones, but I really haven’t got any friends to see this year. Mike and his family decided to go off to the States to visit some friend of his, or something, and-”
"Lestrade?" He slurred, blinking several times, "w-when did you g-get here?"
"I feel sick."
"Well, I suppose I should see what the fuss is about." They began walking back to Bailey court, books in hand and the night sky pulsing with music above them. "But, I can't promise anything. Clubs are bound to be overcrowded on a Saturday..." He shuddered. "I might have to start off with a slow Monday."
"Ms. Hooper –"
"You've been really poorly," he told him in soft tones when he had finally calmed down. "Really poorly. God, you scared me half to death." He pointed at the tubes. "You're still going to need all these for a bit."
The kettle whistled. He made the tea.
"Do not," he countered feebly, but he put it on again nevertheless. They sat in silence for a minute, and then John asked something he'd been meaning to ask for a while.
John chuckled, and then found he couldn't stop. Grinning madly, he took his friend by the hand without thinking, and dragged him further into the mess. "Just dance!" he screamed, barely audible over the noise of other students following along.
"Shit," John breathed, ignoring him. "It's fine. Don't worry, we'll be out in a minute." Sherlock shook his head, closing his eyes against the advancing walls.
"The last time I saw him eat was yesterday breakfast," the doctor supplies, hands pressed into fists. The DI closes his eyes, forlorn. "Your glucose level is 1.2, Sherlock. Are you actually insane?"
"Do you remember the last time you ate?" Lestrade asks, and the detective faces him again. There is Gary, to his rescue again, catching him as he collapses like some woozy maiden. He's angry at himself for letting this happen, especially in front of a handful of the police force. Not that it would be the first time. "It's none of your business," he snaps, but his voice is weak and has less bite behind it than he would've liked. Lestrade rolls his eyes, and John clenches his teeth, irritated.
"How many of you in there?" A paramedic asked while someone got to work on the lock. There was clicking and scraping against metal, and Greg flinched at the sound.
It's five to seven when -
of –"
sick," John clarified, and when Sherlock opened his mouth to argue - "Ah! No. Keep it closed while the thermometer is doing its job." The taller man could've killed John with the look he shot him next. The doctor smirked, pleased that he caught Sherlock out at an opportune moment.
The DI positioned his hands on Sherlock's chest and back, and a few seconds later the poor man leaned over and vomited into his lap. "It's alright, get it out," Lestrade comforted as Sherlock dry-heaved, and pulling off his jacket, climbed into the tub with him. John returned while the Inspector was attempting to get a response from the detective, and, sighing, handed him the cloth.
Holmes grunted where he sat, eyes closed. "How... morbid."
John considers this. "Uh, I beg to differ." He smiles cheekily. "I think I can coop you up in here as long as I want, if you're sick."
"You going to have some?" He urged, pointing at the tea. Sherlock grimaced, paling even further, if that was possible. But, if he was to keep up appearances...
In this AU, we're going to forget about the fact that Sherlock was an avid smoker, because that would literally not make any sense.
hasn't said anything.
He sat down in the chair, eyes wide. He felt as if his chest was collapsing. His throat was numb and he brought a stray hand up to check if it was still connected to his jaw. John met his gaze. He breathed noisily, hunched slightly over his knees.
"Semi-skimmed is fine." She smiled softly. "Thank you, detective."
"Matter of opinion," Sherlock retorted, referring to Sally Donavan.
Grabbing his mobile from the armchair, he punched in a number, eyes trained on Sherlock as the dial tones played out. After a few rings, a husky London accent broke through the speaker.
"John!"
John hung up the phone, taking a few seconds for himself before returning to the room. Sherlock was leant lopsided against the doorframe, inhaler limp in hand. "I don't... need... a BiPAP."
Sherlock snorted.
"Because!" John exclaims, throwing his hands up, "you're getting on my bloody nerves!"
Both his mother and father had resolved to sitting by their son's side, stroking his hand with the soft pads of their thumbs and murmuring quietly, when Sherlock finally took a breath. Mycroft nearly wailed with relief when he turned his brother on his left hip as he choked and eventually heaved onto the old Victorian rug. Lydia had gripped his shoulder, frantically telling him to let it all out, they would clean the rug, they would
Sherlock is happy; happier than he’s been since leaving hospital. He’s even started some experiments, thankfully not in the house. There’s a large shed in the garden, which I assumed contained tools and such – which it does – but Sherlock’s also managed to stock it with lab equipment.
“Sherlock… Hey, I brought you some hot chocolate. I figure you might want to warm up a bit.”
“I assure you Dr Watson, that while there are similarities between the two crime scenes, there are no monoliths within.”
Sherlock examines the labels. “They seem to have put all the boxes with the same content together for us. Let’s start with the ones labeled Cults. The information may give us some insight into the killings.”
Out of habit, I check to make sure all the doors and windows are secure, then turn out the lights and make my way up the stairs. There’s a tightness in my chest, but it’s not severe enough to take another pill.
… You… Look, you know I’m not good at this stuff; never have been. But I want to be perfectly clear on this point – I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and when we promised till death do us part, I meant that with every breath in my body. And I plan on spending the rest of my life with you… if you’ll have me.”
“I’m afraid I’ve gone and done something rash without discussing it with you or Dr Johansen first.”
“Good night, love.”
“I’m not sure, but my brother has requested that we meet him.”
“Oh, John… you look terrible.”
I hope you've enjoyed it. Constructive criticism is always welcome.
Wiggins has managed to gather quite a number of Sherlock’s Homeless Network. “I spread the word, just like you asked Dr Watson. When folks heard that Sherlock was missing, everyone wanted to help.”
No one moves except Sherlock. He raises his hands above his head and yells again. A loud buzzing noise fills the cavern, rising in pitch and intensity until I think my head is going to explode. I don’t know how long it goes on, because, thankfully, I lose consciousness.
I slide to the floor and gather Sherlock in my arms. There’s a slight tremor running through his body. He doesn’t frighten easily, so whatever he experienced in that place must truly have been horrifying.
“You’ll have your answer just up ahead.” Greg replies.
I answer with my middle finger and head off to take a very hot shower.
. “I’ve read through all the documents connected to his case, and I have to say, that if I didn’t know better, I’d think that someone was having me on. Cults, paranormal activity, blood sacrifices, monstrous creatures… they sound like something out of a bad horror film. But as it turns out, I’m quite familiar with the entity known as Cthulhu.”
; and the
I take a cab back home after filing the paperwork on Sherlock. Mrs Hudson comes up a few minutes later. She’s carrying a tray with tea and biscuits. I take it from her and set it on the table next to my chair.
Baker Street was absolutely perfect. It was central to everywhere he could possibly want to be, it was already furnished, and he knew for a fact that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t mind the odd hours he kept. Thanks to her evening herbal soothers, he could commit a murder in the flat above her head and she would sleep right through it. Not that he would, of course. But he could.
“How? Why? What are you doing here?” he asked the man, this stranger who wasn’t a stranger at all, that stood in his kitchen.
“I told you, those were for an experiment,” Sherlock explained for what felt like the hundredth time.
It was silent for several moments while John quickly scrubbed his body. Then the shadow outside the curtain spun around.
They stayed there for several minutes, their quiet breathing and the muted traffic outside the windows the only sound in the room.
“Yes, ‘he’,” John confirms, his heart beating wildly in his chest. “He was just running late.”
“You make more of a mess than Rosie,” he said with a chuckle as Sherlock frowned.
Sorry this one was so late! It's been a busy day here. Enjoy! 💖
But no. No, that was a terrible idea. They didn’t do that. That wasn’t their relationship.
John smiled and obliged his daughter, whisking her up in his arms and giving her a hug and kiss. Sherlock followed her into the kitchen and was watching them both.
He had needed to buy measuring cups and spoons and utensils, and since he had been in the shop anyway, he bought brand new pots and pans to help him in his quest for domestic domination in the kitchen. Nothing super fancy or anything, but definitely better quality than the pans he had used when he was in university.
“I asked if everything was ok,” she said, indicating the mobile still in his hand.
He pulled his head back down and leaned down to kiss Sherlock, his tongue delving inside without preamble as Sherlock’s hand began working on him more purposefully. John’s thighs began to shake from the strain of standing and he let his hands fall to Sherlock’s shoulders and began to push him down onto the mattress. The kiss broke as Sherlock let his hand fall away from John and they both panted heavily at the loss of contact.
"It's c-cold," he muttered, shuddering. There was another moment of silence, until Sherlock looked around quizzically, eyes more lucid. "Why are we in the bath?"
"Good news," the doctor began, and both Sherlock and Molly instantly relaxed. "As you know, the CT scan we took following your second cycle showed a positive response to the treatment, and it appears as though that was consistent. As of today, there are no visible signs of cancer on your imaging."
"Redbeard," he sobbed, his cheeks sticky with salt. "No..."
The detective's fist clenches, knuckles turning paler than his face. "You can't coop me up in here for a few days, let alone a few months!"
The cab pulls up outside Sherlock's flat, and the DI shakes the detective awake. "Sorry Sherlock, but we're here. Let's get you inside." The younger man opens his eyes blearily, blue irises clouded. "Need any help?" He shakes his head, raising a sweaty hand to his face. "I'll be here if you need me."
"Very well."
One evening, with the fire lit and casting sunset shadows over the walls and furniture, Holmes turned to him with bright eyes and a small smile. "Dr. Watson," he said, voice much stronger than it had been several weeks prior, "I must thank you."
John turns to him, confused. "What? Why?"
Except, despite only knowing Sherlock for a week, he felt he had formed a bond with him. During Fresher's Week, meaningless conversation after meaningless conversation had left him exhausted and lonely. His mingling had been a hopeless endeavour – and then Sherlock had waltzed in wearing nothing but a towel; and John wasn't so scared about this big thing called
"Not good, not good mate," John said, squeezing his hand tighter so that his flatmate had something to ground him. "Slow it right down. Now."
At 6 AM the next day, Sherlock's temperature spiked, and he went into a second seizure. The doctors suspected meningococcal septicaemia, and took another blood sample. In a flurry of activity, the antibiotics course was changed, and increased in strength, and Sherlock was put into a medically induced coma in order to better fight the infection. It was suspected that Sherlock's body had shown resistance to the cephalosporins, and John laughed at the irony of it – of course he would be stubborn about the whole thing.
He didn't see much of Sherlock the next day. He awoke late, at approximately fifteen minutes past twelve, and got twisted in the blankets in his rush to get out of bed. He shrieked loudly when he hit the floor with a loud
John stood up and turned to stare at her, exasperated. "For what? What are you talking about?"
Sherlock smiled gently at his fate, something John found uncanny, and resolved to sleep until the next day. When he awoke, bleary-eyed and quiet, he looked John sadly in the eyes and spoke three words.
"I'm not going through it again." Her voice suddenly took on a sharp edge. "I'm not. Because Sherlock isn't going to die."
Knowing the detective would want to be back in 221B as soon as possible, he called for a car and, with some effort, helped an incredibly woozy Sherlock into the back seat. Sherlock was so exhausted, in fact, that he leant his head against his older brother's shoulder and began snoring softly, much to Mycroft's disgust.
He nodded gratefully, and after a few minutes of companionable silence, they clambered into her car. She turned the ignition, the radio burbling lowly, and swivelled to face him.
"How long until someone comes?"
It took him a while, but he found the bar. Pulling out a handful of cash, he ordered five jaeger bombs – but by the time he'd turned around to share them, John had disappeared into the crowd.
The doctor asked and, at the shake of Sherlock's head, relayed the message. "He used to have a BiPAP for this time of year when he was younger, because the cold caused so many flare ups. I don't exactly recall when he got rid of it..."
John's jaw dropped. "Sherlock, are you
Sherlock is a long-term sufferer of asthma. Glimpse into his daily life, and childhood, with the illness.
And she was right. A week later, he had made a full recovery, and after some bloodwork, was back on course to finish his treatment.
Around one o'clock, he was stopped by his name. Weak, Holmes reached out with a hand, and instinctively, Watson took it. "Dr. Watson," he wheezed again, only to be wracked with violent coughs, hardly able to lift a hand to cover his mouth. When he was finished, the good doctor wiped the blood from his chin quietly, still taken by his frailty, before hushing the detective when the man tried to talk once more.
When they're finished, both are out of breath for no particular reason. John closes his eyes and leans his head against his flatmates before sitting up and looking around the room. "I'm sorry."
It was a simple statement, but it snapped John out of his trance. He cleared his throat, nodding. "How so?"
"Hmm?"
"They'll be here soon," Donavan informed him, blinking at her phone. "Huh. Service is gone again. Must of been a satellite passing overhead or something."
The first-year held back a pathetic whine as he took up the spot next to the door, jumping up and down as if such an action would prevent him from wetting himself. He had just taken to wondering whether he should break the rules and use the bathroom the girls shared on the floor below, when luckily, the shower shut off, and John heard someone scrabbling around inside for their things. Moments later, a dishevelled, skinny youth appeared, shivering in an oversized beige towel.
"How dare you worry your parents," she had said, furious. "He will be
"For everything you have done," the man continued, "both in the last few months, with this awful sickness, and even before then."
The detective's only response is to allow his knees to give way - Lestrade lurches forward and catches him before his head can slam into the floor, before slowly lowering him down and moving him into the recovery position. John, bewildered, can barely move - he just stands there, staring, feet glued to the concrete. Sherlock's eyes flutter wearily, skin pale and sweaty. The DI finally pulls out what he was storing in his pocket, and John just frowns at the high sugar juice carton.
"Maybe later." She dragged a hand down her face, blinking wearily. "Gasping for some tea, though – if, um, that's alright?"
The door slammed with a crude finality.
Ironically, it's Donavan herself that offers up a chocolate bar, and for once, her eyes don't possess any spite. Using his teeth to unwrap it, the DI hands it to Sherlock, who begins to chew it with a morose expression.
They sat in companionable silence thereafter, the fire soothing them both.
"Where's who?"
Warning for minor depictions of vomit.
The ambulance arrived two minutes later, earlier than predicted, and took Sherlock away on a stretcher. When asked if he was family, John replied within a heartbeat - yes, he was his fiancé, and he would sit in the ambulance with him, goddammit.
Dr Johansen is there when Sherlock is discharged, as well as several nurses and staff members who helped with his treatment and recovery. Sherlock thanks each one of them by name before he takes my hand and says, “Let’s go home, John.”
I don’t know how long we stand there, but eventually I pull away and ask, “Tea?”
Mycroft ends the call before I can get in another word. “Bollocks!” Well I’ll be damned if I’m going to just sit at home and do nothing. Mycroft isn’t the only person with resources. I scroll through the contacts on my phone and call Bill Wiggins.
It’s easier to wash Sherlock from inside the tub, so I undress and join him. I try to concentrate on the task at hand, but I can’t help but place a few tender kisses over his body as I clean it. After he’s washed, rinsed, dried and dressed, Sherlock works on his hair while I get dressed and put the kettle on.
I’m just finishing the second box on Cults when Bill Wiggins calls. One of the members of Sherlock’s Homeless Network was grabbed off the street and taken to a warehouse on the Limehouse Basin, and is currently there along with the cultists.
“I told you once that your loss would break my heart. I meant it then and I mean it now. If anything should happen to you or John… Please reconsider, Sherlock, for both your sakes.”
“John…“
“Would you mind clarifying that statement, please?” I ask.
“Almost too convenient, if you ask me.” Mycroft replies, eyes narrowing.
“But not when I was captured. There were between 20 and 30 others in that cavern. They were chanting in some bizarre language, and they were terrified of Sherlock, or whatever it was that possessed him. And judging by what you’ve told me, they had every reason to be. Look, Mycroft, I was never one of those people who believed in the paranormal… but I’m beginning to now. I don’t know exactly what we’re dealing with, but I do know that Sherlock is in danger. And the longer he’s being controlled, the harder it’ll be to get him back. Maybe Dr Abernathy can help us.”
I hesitate before answering. The last thing I want to do is upset Mrs Hudson, especially after her last declaration. But I don’t want to lie to her either.
“John, Sherlock… please take a seat. I must say I was quite intrigued by your phone call. Please explain this process of deleting information to me.”
“The British Government may not, but you know who does, and my guess is that they’re in the Occult Collections Vault of the British Museum. A place so secure, that it would be easier to access the vault in Fort Knox than there. And you will get me access. Come along, John.”
After telly comes dinner and sleep, at least for me. Sherlock stays up to do some research on his laptop. He does eventually come to bed because he’s there when I wake up in the morning. We shower together a little longer than usual (Sherlock doesn’t often initiate sex, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to refuse him when he does), dress and have a leisurely breakfast. At 10:30 we leave the flat, hail a cab, and head for the British Museum.
I pull out a few more weeds and check for insect damage like Sherlock’s taught me. He really does have a wealth of information stored in his brain.
Sherlock clasps my upper arms. “That must be it, John. Both locations are in deserted warehouses near bodies of water. I’ll need to reference a map to be sure, but I think we’ve gotten our first solid clue. Well done!”
“Yes, well as to your brother’s condition…” Dr Johansen picks up a folder that’s clearly labeled
“I’ve gotten you some things that should last a few days, but you’ll need to do shopping. And I’ve started a fire and aired the place out a bit.” She looks us over with a critical eye before wrapping us both in a hug. “It’s so good to have my boys back. Now go upstairs before I start crying.”
“Also ten, but as you saw, only the bones remained.”
Mycroft chimes in at this point. “There are things we must discuss, brother mine. You and Doctor Watson, as always, rush in where angels fear to tread.”
“You belong to me! Do you understand? Do you?
, Professor?” Sherlock asks. “I assume you have a copy here.”
“I’d be doing everything in my power to find him. You know I would.”
I bury my face in his groin and worship him.
We exit the hospital and are immediately whisked away in one of Mycroft’s chauffeured cars; Anthea is noticeably absent.
We take a taxi from the train station directly home. Mrs Hudson greets us with open arms.
“Thanks, Wiggins. That means a lot.” I clear my throat and turn to address the crowd. “Thank you all for coming. Now as most of you know, Sherlock Holmes is missing. He’s been taken by a group of cultists… a dangerous group of cultists who we believe are responsible for the rash of killings that have happened around London recently. Now all I’m asking is for you to keep your eyes and ears open for anything unusual. If you see Sherlock or hear anything about him, don’t approach him or the people he’s with. Contact Bill Wiggins or myself at Baker Street. Any information, no matter how trivial it may seem, can be very helpful. Also, this group tends to favour deserted buildings on or near the Thames. Thank you, again. Oh… and of course you’ll be compensated for your efforts.”
“Not particularly, no.”
So I explain, in great detail, the events – bizarre as they were – as they unfolded. I also tell Mycroft and Greg about Sherlock’s dream encounter with Cthulhu. Neither man says anything.
Sherlock lays his head in my lap and I stroke his hair and lightly massage his scalp. I can feel him relax under my ministrations.
“Condensation?” I ask to no one in particular.
There's still
Dr Simondson and Professor Abernathy are waiting for us. They introduce themselves, then the four of us go inside.
“Where have you been?”
I freeze in my tracks. That voice… it’s the same one from the cavern.
“West Sussex…”
I get one of Sherlock’s smiles at that. “I love you, John Watson.” He hugs me again. “Now let me get back to work.”
“That’s amazing! But tell me something I’ve always wondered Sherlock… why the fascination with bees?”
“It sounds like you plan on making this a permanent residence for us. What about Baker Street?”
I pull him close and kiss him again. If I don’t, he’ll ramble on for hours.
He’s already in the tub when I walk in – eyes closed, but a look on contentment on his face. I grab the shampoo and conditioner and kneel on the floor.
“Shhh… it’s alright, John.”
“John, we need to talk.”
We both agree and Greg texts Sherlock the address after he leaves.
When Sherlock wakes, I make dinner for us, but he doesn’t last long after that, and we end up making it an early night. I leave the dishes and we both get ready for bed. Sherlock wraps himself around me and settles his head on my chest.
“Stop... Stop right now. I need to take responsibility for some things, and this is one of them.” He takes another sip of tea. “I know I haven’t been much of a husband to you since my release from hospital. And I’m so grateful for your patience. Physical intimacy is important in a relationship, and I’ve denied it to you for over seven months now. And that doesn’t even take into consideration the six months I was actually in hospital. That’s a long time to go without sex, especially when you’re used to having it regularly. I’m surprised you haven’t sought companionship elsewhere.”
I hurry to follow Sherlock, and we both exit the club.
I turn a few more corners and come across the wall with the hole in it. Just as I’m about to step through the opening, someone grabs my collar and yanks me back. All I manage to see is a big, beefy fist coming towards me before everything goes black.
“I dare you to kiss me.”
left unsaid, and John couldn’t help the grin that came to his face.
“Damnit, Sherlock,” he sighed. “I want to believe you.”
Sherlock took a deep breath, opened his mouth, closed it again. “I missed you, John.”
“I’m so happy for you two. It really is time. Have you made plans yet? Will you get married in a church?”
“I couldn’t take a chance that I was wrong, John. I didn’t want to lose you and Rosie. I didn’t know if our friendship could survive if I took the chance and you did not feel the same way. I never expected you to be the one to make a declaration.”
as John went back to the kitchen and prepared the two cups of tea. He brought them both out and placed one on the table by Sherlock’s chair before he sat on his own. He sipped his tea and watched his friend play.
“Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock and I were not…,” John began, as he always did when she started in on him, and as ever, she cut him off before he could finish.
John turned away from the window, suddenly remembering that he was completely naked except for his pants.
When he was halfway through his circuit of the park, his phone pinged with a text message. He pulled it out, glancing at the screen, then sent back a quick reply. Long fingers tapped at the screen in a random staccato as he briefly considered texting John, but then he shook his head at himself and shoved his mobile back in his trouser pocket.
“I already told you I forgive you. I do. Forgive you, that is.”
The beast slithered upon him, plucking at the seams of his defenses and he watched in horror as they lost any semblance of structure. Of rational thought. Of sanity. The threads were snapping and he was flying loose, buffeted in nightmare winds, scrabbling for purchase with bloodied fingernails against his own mind.
Naturally, he was to be denied that because John Watson never got what he wanted out of life. As soon as his feet hit the pavement outside the clinic, he felt that tingle on the back of his neck again. That old instinct that told him he was being watched. He turned to walk towards the closest Tube station, his headache receding as his senses kicked into overdrive.
He smiled. “Yes, alright. I’ll get you some lunch, then.”
John walked back to the black car and let himself in, not surprised when the woman from before was sitting inside, still tapping away at her phone. “We’re to take you home,” she spoke as he settled on the smooth leather cushion, and he nodded.
John slipped the key in and unlocked the door, then gathered his boxes again and they made their way up the seventeen steps to 221B. They dropped off the boxes and suitcase just inside the door and John glanced at him before he took a step closer. He reached around him to push the door to the flat closed, his body pressing against him as he leaned forward. Another step closer and Sherlock took a step back, eyes locked on John as he crowded him against the door. The heat between their bodies and in John’s eyes was scorching as the smaller man reached up to run a thumb along his cheek. Sherlock’s hands fell to his hips, holding lightly, thumbs circling absently.
“I suppose I can’t argue with data,” Sherlock replied, lips quirked in a smirk, and John gave him a lopsided smile.
“We can’t both look,” Sherlock explained with an eye roll.
John took a moment to take in the sight before him. The always impeccable suit, the aubergine button-down that showcased milky skin and dark curls, and those piercing, intelligent eyes that saw everything. What did he see now, John wondered.
“We should probably get back soon. It will be Watson’s nap time soon,” he suggested, his eyes following her as she knocked on a tree trunk with a stick she had found on the ground.
“Brilliant,” John smiled, and for a moment Sherlock wasn’t sure if he had spoken his deduction about Mr. Campbell’s motives aloud and he was reacting to being actively pursued in such a way, but no, John was simply commenting on his deduction of the case. Just as he always did.
John suspected that it had far more to do with the man beside him than the physical address that woke such sentiment in him.
“No. I meant after that. When you came back when Alex was here,” John clarified.
“Up the bed, Sherlock. Hands and knees.”
They sat there, an uncomfortable silence suffocating them, as they drank their tea and observed one another. At this range, John could easily notice the rings dark as bruises under Sherlock’s bright eyes, his cheekbones sharper than two years ago, a cut through his eyebrow that hadn’t been before, and John wanted to know. He wanted to know what happened. Why he wasn’t sleeping, how he came to be thinner, why he was holding his weight like it hurt to stand. Why why why.
“So I hear.”
She turned to him with a large smile on her face. “Daddy look, S’lock looks pretty now too. He has a crown! Pretty ‘Lock,” she squealed, turning back to face Sherlock and squeezing his cheeks with her small hands.
“Left foot green,” he called out, then looked around him to try and figure out the best way to actually get there with Sherlock’s arm between his legs.
He finally managed to make his stiff fingers bend properly to unlock the door and made his way into the warmer and significantly drier foyer. He pulled off his coat and soaked scarf and hung them on their usual hooks, then made his way up the stairs. The open door at the top of the stairs was a surprise. Perhaps Mrs. Hudson had gotten a bee in her bonnet about the state of the flat when she had come up earlier and was cleaning.
“You can’t be serious,” Sherlock’s baritone rumbled by John’s shoulder.
“How are you here?” Sherlock asked, his eyes closing again as he breathed in all the scents of John.
“You’re such a romantic, Sherlock.”
“Well, who am I to stand in the way of tradition?” Sherlock groaned and John smiled as he felt Sherlock harden against his stomach. He pressed more kisses down his body as he shifted further down.
“John, you’re a doctor. You know you don’t get colds from walking in the rain.”
Rosie nodded her head vigorously in affirmation.
“When have I ever been angry because I was hungry?” he demanded and John bit back a snort of laughter.
“Which one?”
“You’re looking,” John defended himself.
“It was my treasure as a boy. You’re my treasure, now.”
“John.”
Sherlock hadn’t looked away from John. He wasn’t even sure the other man had blinked. There was something in the way he was staring that made John’s muscles clench, his belly swooping low.
On their walk, Sherlock had told him about where he had been these past two years. How he had tracked Moriarity’s network and people with the aid of Mycroft, infiltrated operations, been captured a handful of times, and escaped with some injuries. It sounded like a bloody Bond film, which John loved as an observer, but the reality had always seemed a bit far-fetched. John had been a military man, but the story Sherlock wove wasn’t straight-forward and had so many twists and turns in the dark and shadowed places of the world that John almost wished he would stop talking.
“Sorry, had a leg, um, spasm,” he quickly lied, glad of the darkened cinema that hid the furious blush he could feel warming his cheeks.
“Dull”, Sherlock retorted to John’s assertion that people didn’t have archenemies in real life. That they had friends, people they liked and didn’t like. Boyfriends and girlfriends.
“I got an earlier flight,” he quietly replied. “I texted you a few times, but you didn’t answer. I thought you might be working a case.”
It was the site for the latest fundraiser where Mr. Campbell’s clinic was a recipient. He had just finished reading the “About Us” section when his mobile pinged and he went immediately to his texts.
Rosie cheered in delight at the prospect of a bath and nearly ran off before Sherlock managed to snatch her off the floor in his arms.
“I do not spoil her.”
He looked down at the man before him. The expanse of smooth milky skin, the delightfully disheveled curls, the peaked rosy nipples, the lines of muscle, the beautiful hard cock. His heart pounded in his chest at the beauty of this man, his best friend, and he couldn’t wait any longer.
“It’s a classic, Sherlock,” he replied. “Besides, I know you like this one.” John sat down on the other end of the sofa and leaned back into the soft leather. “Pirates, poison, torture, sword fights. True love. You can’t fool me. You love this movie,” John teased good-naturedly.
“The one that’s in all those other films.”
Mrs. Hudson blinked in surprise. They usually didn’t talk much about Sherlock, and never without Mrs. Hudson being the one to bring him up, but she smiled at him after her surprise faded.
Sherlock took in all these details and made his deductions within the seconds it took for the man to fully enter the room.
John finally looked up, his eyes meeting Sherlock’s directly for the first time since he came back into his life, and Sherlock looked away. He turned and rushed past Mrs. Hudson without another word.
“Now what?”
“What is this, sixth form?” John grumbled.
“Sure.”
He was wearing his fucking coat.
“Oh right. Do you have a boyfriend, then?” John questioned. “Which is fine, by the way.”
“No, you didn’t. It’s how you get your kicks, isn’t it? You risk your life to prove you’re clever.”
“Why must I?
The grass was springy and cool beneath his fingers as he raked his hand idly through the green blades. The remnants of a last-minute picnic lunch lay scattered over the patch quilt that served as their tablecloth and dry spot to sit. John watched Rosie as she capered about through the grass in her bare feet, blonde curls bouncing, as she bent down periodically to gather the yellow flowers that dotted the park. He already had a small collection in his lap and had begun tying the stems together as he kept an eye on his daughter.
The door opened up into a delightfully warmer climate than it had revealed the past three days, as well as the sharp scent of fresh evergreen garlands. It appeared that the wreath that had decorated his door wasn’t the only addition that Mrs. Hudson had made to the flat while he was out.
“Just a matter of time, yeah?” one of the doctors, Potter or Prewitt, something with a P, anyway, replied and then everyone nodded their heads in agreement, just as expected.
The bottle of scotch was less than half full and John and Sherlock were over half way drunk. At least, John knew he was. He was fairly sure Sherlock was. The soft pink flush to his cheeks and his easy smile definitely helped John reach that conclusion.
John felt his balls tighten at his words and bit his bottom lip as his hips fucked into Sherlock’s large fist.
The sound of Sherlock’s voice hit him with the force of a lorry to the chest. He had nearly forgotten how deep it was, the cadence and posh accent, and he had to close his eyes a moment to breathe. By the end of the all too short video, Sherlock promised to be with him soon, and John wished that were true.
It was a small dog, some kind of shepherd mix if he had to guess, and rather young, he thought. There was no collar and though John was no veterinarian, he was a doctor. He had already decided that he was going to take care of the dog, at least until he could find its owner or get it somewhere.
A little over 20 minutes after he had sent his texts, John strolled into the apartment, cane banging against the floor in counter to his soft-footed steps. A few minutes of inane conversation took place, including John’s doctorly concern regarding his rather unorthodox use of nicotine patches, but then he gave him his phone and he sent a text while John crossed over to the window and glanced out.
“Oh. Yeah, it’s great. Haven’t had anyone projectile vomit on me yet, so can’t complain,” John joked, and everyone laughed as expected.
The man rattled off an address, then turned to go, his gaze passing swiftly over John without comment. John watched him head down the stairs before he turned his attention back to Sherlock, who waited until he heard the sound of the door closing downstairs before literally jumping in the air with a delighted grin. Mrs. Hudson chose that moment to come back up the stairs.
“Angelo’s?” Sherlock asked with a quirk of his brow and John let his smile grow.
“Please, John. I’m ready. Fuck me.” He was breathless and sounded completely wreaked already and John was forcefully reminded of his own cock, heavy and so far neglected.
“Hey, didn’t hear you come in,” he smiled warmly, then his smile fell as he took in Sherlock’s rather waterlogged appearance. “Did you walk home? You’re soaked!”
“Might as well answer it. It’s for you,” he told John, and the smaller man pushed off the wall with a questioning look thrown over his shoulder before he went to the door and pulled it open.
He walked down the familiar corridors of his Mind Palace until he stood before the wing devoted to John. He was somewhat hesitant to open the door out of fear of the chaos he would find in there, but when he pushed open the door, there weren’t drawers thrown around, papers scattered haphazardly across tables and the floor, or an elephant standing inexplicably in the middle of the room. The lack of disarray perplexed him. This area should be in pandemonium with the new intelligence he received, but it simply was not. It was exactly as he had left it the last time he was there.
We both stand and hug each other tightly, and Sherlock kisses my cheek. When we pull apart, I take a good look at his work table. There are test tubes filled with plant cuttings, flower petals spread out in neat rows, jars of dirt, a high-powered microscope with a box of slides, a couple of open notebooks that contain Sherlock’s sketches, and what looks like an ultraviolet light hanging from the ceiling.
“Um… I’m testing the soil from the garden. It can’t be too acidic or too basic. The balance has to be just right. Again… chemistry. I was also thinking of installing a bin behind the house so we could make our own vermicompost. We would just need to invest in the purchase of several varieties of earthworm.

Life returns to normal, or what counts as normal in the Holmes-Watson abode. Sherlock has agreed to some down time, which means he’s looking over cold cases for New Scotland Yard. He seems fine, but I’m still concerned about what he went through – especially when he was possessed.
“Chemistry?”
Greg walks off down the hallway with Mycroft close behind.
That doesn’t necessarily reassure me, but I go to work despite my fears.
“Where to?” I query.
“What about the cultists?”
“I’ll do everything in my power, Dr Watson.”
“Thank you, Mycroft. John and I will be there.”
“After Cthulhu took control, several prisoners were brought before me and I was handed an ornately carved knife. I didn’t hesitate, not for a moment. I simply reached out and slit their throats, one after the other. I bathed in the arterial spray, relishing it… Once they were all dead, I handed the knife back to one of the cultists, then seated myself on the statue between Cthulhu’s feet. Then… then one of the female cultists came forward, knelt before me and brought me to completion with her mouth. I never had sex with any of the cultists, but one of them serviced me every day I was their prisoner; sometimes multiple times a day. I felt disgusted, but there was nothing I could do to stop them. Cthulhu seemed to know exactly what effect this was having on me, and encouraged the cultists to continue. I… I…”

-	H.P. Lovecraft,
The Inspector jumps up, shoves me out of the way, and stumbles to the loo. The sounds of retching follow soon after. I go to the kitchen and put the kettle back on.
The blanket is tossed over Sherlock’s chair and I get up… or rather, I attempt to get up. It takes a couple tries. I’ve got a stiff neck and my back muscles are screaming. Ah, the joys of growing old.
It isn't long before they've reached the alleyway they're looking for - it's hard to miss the streams of yellow tape and the glare of whining police sirens - and they're greeted by a sober and weary Lestrade. The DI nods to both doctor and detective before leading them into the gloom, where a body lies motionless and pale on the pavement.
John looked up so quickly he felt a rush of vertigo; shaking his head, he focussed on the man looming over him. He wore a neatly pressed suit, completed with a silver-blue tie, and leaned on an umbrella with his right hand. There was something about his face that John recognised, but no, his eyes were too wide-set, and his nose too rounded...
A five-year timestamp. He'd be twenty-seven. It evoked, distantly, the thought that he'd be joining a club – a morbidly famous club – but that he was unlikely to be remembered that way. Or remembered at all. What right did Sherlock Holmes, unknown to all but a select few at Scotland Yard, have to share a list with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain, respected members of a cultural phenomenon?
"Redbeard..." Sherlock shook his head, eyes distant. "I'm tired."
"Alright," he agreed, sitting across from her, "then you can call me Greg."
"Molly," he began again, tapping a finger against the edge of his mug nervously, "I just wanted to uh, thank you. For being here. God knows no one expects it of you."
"John...?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Mostly because he was seizing.
She scooped him up, and brought him to her chest. His long black tail reared up to tickle at her chin, soothing her ragged nerves. "I'll bring you to meet him one day," she muttered, pressing a kiss to the top of Aragog's head. "I think he'd like you. But not today. I think, unfortunately, you'd do more harm than good."
John watched with a frown as the younger man consistently opened his mouth and closed it again with a slight
The doctor felt his friend shift as he came to, stretching out his legs and sighing, before he opened his eyes sluggishly and looked about the room. A slow arm came up to grope at the foreign object on his face, before realisation dawned and he turned stark blue eyes on the man beside him.
John stood still for a second, before the steady dripping of the leaky tap in the bathroom brought him to his senses. "Fuck," he hissed, darting into the toilet. He really needed to piss.
John scrabbled anxiously for his friend's hands, his own trembling - he lifted one gently, examining his fingers. The nails had begun to take on a tinge of blue, and it looked like his lips were going in the same direction. John swore, letting Sherlock slump where he sat as he darted across the room for his phone. For a frightening few minutes he thought he'd lost it, then there it was, underneath one of the case files, and John misdialed 999 almost twice before he got through.
"Am not," the detective countered, angrily brushing a curl away from his face in order to take a look through the microscope properly. He couldn't see through it right, it was out of focus. There must have been something wrong with the lens...
Mycroft circled around the desk, hands already reaching forward. He didn't bother calling out his brother's name - simply laid his hands upon the younger man's shoulders and gently guided him down to the floor, his blazer folded under his head. As expected, the consulting detective began to flail a minute later, saliva pooling around his lips. Petty argument forgotten, the elder Holmes began to clear the floor as thoroughly as possible in order to prevent Sherlock from hurting himself on any hardwood. Thankfully, the rug wasn't at all abrasive, and his arms and legs were of course covered by his thick collared coat.
, small."
Sherlock could go quite long periods without them, if he took his medications and looked after his lungs and airways, but every once in a while he'd go down with a bout. John was usually there to help him fumble for a rescue remedy, and other than the sickness before Christmas, John had never been truly scared of Sherlock's condition.

"Because we need it to survive," John mutters under his breath, ever the physician. But he trots after Sherlock anyway, ignoring the uncomfortable grumbles his stomach emits.
"Wrong," Sherlock replies quietly, sliding down onto his knees and inspecting the carpet. He raises his magnifying glass to his eye, only to have it catch the light and explode in a millisecond of pure white; the detective clutches his head, groaning.
"Well open it then!" Sherlock snapped, thrusting a hand forward. John looked at him in surprise. The detective opened his mouth and shut it again, shrugging moodily. "It-it smells enough as it is."
So I've done a few short-term illnesses, and would like to get into the deeper stuff. As you've probably noticed, none of these stories are connected (or else Sherlock is a very sickly guy) and so I'm going to have a go at some chronic illnesses. Enjoy and please let me know if I ever get anything wrong. Thank you!
John reached a hand up and brushed the detective's hair back, uneasy. "Sherlock?" The man in question whined. "Are you in pain?" It was then that his friend retched, shoulders hunching as he dribbled onto the bed. "Oh..." John reached up with a flannel and wiped down his face. Sherlock mumbled incoherently, turning into the cool cloth.
The suspicion increased in volume when Sherlock returned from a case stiff and bone-weary one evening. John had been working monotonously at the clinic for the past week, attempting to earn some wages in order to pull his economic weight in the flat, and had been paying little attention to Sherlock between shifts. That Friday, as the night grew an eclectic blue, the detective stumbled through the doorway with a wince, falling onto the sofa with a stubbornness exceeding his mental capacity. The older man had observed as the younger massaged small circles into his neck and lower back, groaning like an individual of greater age than the athletic soul he was. He had even offered to help, and was surprised by the hesitation before Sherlock's dismissal. It was rare for the man to even consider such trivial medical help.
"Sherlock!"
Sherlock nodded, taking John's arm and allowing the doctor to pull him up. "Woah," John said when the taller man almost fell against the side of the tub, "easy."
"So you'll never believe me again?"
And then suddenly, it had all become clear. The drug habit – something that had been considered nothing more than a quirk to everyone other than Watson himself – could be the only explanation. Such prolonged use could only have weakened him, made him more susceptible to this plague, and now, acted as a catalyst, rushing the poor man into an early grave.
"Right," John replied, dropping it. A few heavy seconds passed.
The detective smirks. "Well, it's called the kissing disease for a reason."
"I know, I know," John said, squeezing his other hand. "Calm it down. In and out. Do it with me."
fine. I'm absolutely fine."
John shook his head, solemn. "Not as much, no. Less running about. More attention paid to your bodily needs, please. And you'll be seeing this place... a lot more."
"Trust me to further incapacitate my lungs," he laughed, and then coughed. John shook his head, pushing him back down onto the pillows. "You should go b-"
"Thanks Sally," John said, eyes trained on his best friend, ears listening out for sirens.
Sherlock couldn't answer. His body went rigid against the door, eyes glazing over.
Over tea, the morning of this revelation, Watson had almost let his anger overtake him. Had almost bellowed this new information to Holmes whilst he shakily drew a china cup to his lips. But it had quickly dissipated. The detective was a wraith, not half the man he was, and there would be no sense in admonishing him for who he had once been. Instead, the good doctor had poured his friend another steaming cup, and returned to his reading of
"How can you be so sure?" Watson queried almost desperately, hands gripping the arms of the chair so tight his knuckles were at risk of bursting forth. "Surely, there must be a mistake?"
"Sherlock -" The detective dropped his reliever and it hit the floor with a dull thud. His shoulders began to hunch again, and the doctor was struggling to hold him up. He wanted to tell the detective to
"Lestrade's coming Sherlock," John said, rubbing his back and holding him upright. "We'll get you cleaned up and try and get your fever broken. It'll all be fine."
"Don't make me say it again."
"Yes," he said through gritted teeth, unable to supress the violent shudder that worked its way up through his legs. "John, please –"
?" John stabbed a sausage with his fork, shaking his head and huffing in disbelief. "Mate, that was bloody incredible."
The detective looks almost apologetic as he meets John's gaze. "You never asked," he provides, before placing the last piece of chocolate in his mouth and crushing the purple wrapper in his fist.
He wanted to be a doctor. He could not – would not – be frightened.
She breathed harsh through her nose, sitting up quickly. "Oh," she said, looking around. The sun was setting. "I didn't mean to sleep so late."
"Pull yourself together man," he muttered to himself, walking stiffly through the flat, "what in the bloody hell are you so
The sound of the paramedics at the door appeared to kindle something in him. As Molly stood to answer them, he threw a hand out to grasp her arm, starkly lucid. "Please don't," he panted heavily, words hardly louder than the cool London air. She shook her head, face crumpling. He did not let her go.

“That’s all that happened. The cultists moved me around a lot, but we always kept close to water. That’s important… water is important to Cthulhu.”
We have 20+ more years together – the happiest days of our lives.
We chat for a few for minutes, then Dr Johansen states he’s releasing Sherlock from his care. He doesn’t feel he’s a threat to himself or anyone else, and I, as a qualified physician, should be able to care for him.
Greg calls to tell me that the Caird and Rayner building has been demolished, after the statue of Cthulhu was blown to bits.
“Horrific is what it is, Sherlock. Beyond horrific, actually. I… I can’t even begin to describe it. We’ve been at the scene all night, and... You’ll have to see it for yourselves. But I can’t ask you. Not this time.” He stares down at the cup and takes another sip of tea; his hands are shaking. Whatever Greg saw has got him terrified.
Sherlock manages to eat a few biscuits with his tea, but I can see he’s fading fast. I finally just put the dishes in the sink, manoeuvre him into the bedroom, tuck him under the covers, and slide in next to him. Sherlock wraps himself around me and falls asleep almost immediately.

you’re family. Let us help you.”
He continues to see Dr Johansen twice a week. After his last visit, the doctor asked to speak to me privately.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
He turns at the sound of my voice. His eyes, gratefully, are normal and he begins to struggle against his captors.
I glance at Mycroft, and he nods. One of the MI6 teams chauffeurs us back to Baker Street, then sets up watch around the building, while I usher Sherlock upstairs.
“You said several things. What else are you working on?”
There’s another path for me to follow, with a much slighter grade than the one I just rolled down. As I make my way up the incline, I notice a pale blue luminescence which gets brighter as I approach. The creatures have failed to follow me into this cavern; perhaps this was my intended destination all along. A few more steps and I’ll be at the apex. I take a deep breath and walk forward.
Mycroft is leaning against the boot of his car. He straightens his shoulders, pulling himself to his full height as we reach him.
. It was its will against mine, and with your help, I was able to wrench free from its control long enough to retreat to my mind palace. I had no idea if it would provide a safe haven from the entity, but thankfully it did.”
“Morning gents. I… um… I…”
“I won’t bore you with all the trivial details, John. After I was taken by the cultists, they immediately brought me to the Caird and Rayner statue room. Once there, I was forced to drink some vile tasting liquid that contained an opioid derivative. After I was compliant, they stripped me, drew designs on my body, then began chanting.”

“How did you know?”
-	H.P. Lovecraft,
Directly in front of us is a monolith, at least 30 metres high, carved from some black stone. I don’t know if I can accurately describe the horror sculpted into that cyclopean monument. It’s a being – a representation of something from out of a nightmare – vaguely humanoid in shape with a head like an octopus, and tentacle-like appendages extending from the facial area. The body is scaly, positioned in a squat. Gigantic claws decorate both hands and feet, and long, narrow wings jut from the creature’s back.
The cultists seem to have gone to ground, but Mycroft isn’t taking any chances. There is now a permanent security detail assigned to Baker Street and the surrounding area. We’re given photos of all the team members, and each day a new codeword is assigned in case they need access to the flat.
fault.”
“I know… I didn’t expect things to change overnight. I’ll talk to him when we get home about the possibility of a short holiday. Maybe he just needs a change of scenery.”
“Do you recall that I once told you that my brain was like a hard drive, and it only made sense to put things in it that were useful?”
Anthea joins us as we finish eating. Mycroft disconnects his call and she leans down to whisper something to him.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how much I missed your playing until now.”
“Nope,” I say as I take a seat and cross my arms. “That’s what your husband wants me to do. I can’t just sit and do nothing, Greg. I’ll go barking mad if I do.”
Sherlock’s voice rises in volume, and he punctuates each question by slamming my head against the wood until I pass out.
Mycroft arrived half an hour ago – he’s remarkably subdued. After inspecting all the medical equipment attached to his brother, he pulls a chair next to the bed and just sits. There’s no smugness about him, no arrogant mien; he’s obviously concerned about Sherlock, but there’s an underlying current of something else going on.
I should know better than to ignore my gut feelings.
Sherlock calls ahead and notifies the caretakers, James and Margaret Hastings, when we will be arriving, and they meet us at the cottage. Cottage… when Sherlock told me he owned a cottage, I was thinking of a single level residence with a couple of rooms, much like his parent’s home. But, no, it’s a beautiful two storey brick dwelling on five acres of land – including a burbling brook – with an absolutely gorgeous garden filled with flowers and flowering plants. It looks like something that should be featured on the cover of an architectural magazine, or
