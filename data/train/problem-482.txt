“Thank you,” Sherlock says, accepting the offered glass. He takes a sip. It is light and crisp and tastes almost of nothing at all. He takes another sip.
John shifts his pillow down a bit lower, rearranges the placement of his backside, unable to get comfortable. He turns on the closed captions but leaves the thing going.  It’s better, but the reading is making him tired.
, as he’s taken to calling it since… well, since his pregnant wife shot his best friend in the heart.  Jesus Christ.
Sherlock blinks again but recovers more quickly this time. “Right,” he says. “Right, indeed.”  He leans forward with a jerky, tentative movement that he corrects almost instantly, standing tall and sure, just a bit too much in John’s personal space. It’s enough that John can feel Sherlock’s warmth ghost over his own skin before he pivots them by placing a light hand at the small of Sherlock’s back for barely a beat as he guides them back the way they came.
All he sees is colour, a sickening blur of blues and blacks, glowing off and on and off and on, a garish grin, all teeth.  Pinpricks of white, smears of red so bright they could be blood. He can’t stop falling. It’s so loud. He needs quiet to think. He has to get down from here.  He tries opening his eyes again, but the noise grows louder, blaring like an alarm of white static, like a heartbeat that refuses to regulate. Colours swirl. The clock is ticking.  Tic-tock. Tic-tock. Tic. Tic. Tic. Tic.
“Oh, hello dears,” She says, looking down, fitting the little cloth envelope that holds her coupons into the front pocket of her handbag. “I’m just off to the shops. Do you need anything?”
John reads another chapter like this—bodily pressing against his mad flatmate and pretending not to be bothered in the slightest as Sherlock tests varying tactics of reclaiming the sofa to (John is pleased to note)
“Shut up,” he says, lungs burning as he tries to fill them. He gets a sharp pain in the sinus just behind the corner of his left eye, so he presses into it with two fingers. It doesn’t help much.
so kind... except for the drugs things.  But that’s more general, isn’t it?  That’s not about her--specifically.
At the house, Sherlock hangs Rosie’s bag on its hook by the door, and John tells Rosie to play in her bedroom for a minute so he can get dinner on the hob. Sherlock rattles on about the website cases he’s considering taking up next. John interjects from time to time, and in this conversation, things feel so normal, so ten-years-ago
John lets out a breath through his mouth. “It’s all rather unglamourous around here, I’m afraid,” he says, laying it out. He steps forward anyway—hoping.
“What do we do now?” John wonders.  How do you start a relationship that is already nearly a decade in?
“Good bye, Molly.”  He bends to kiss her cheek, but she pulls away.  Instead, he squeezes her arm just below the shoulder.  Her own hand comes up to wrap around just above his wrist, and she cannot help but close her eyes for just a moment.  When he drops his hand to leave, she lets him go.
“John,” Sherlock says, deep voice steady, but he can’t stop blinking.  John breathes deep and reaches out, fingers brushing just at Sherlock’s temple, thumb smoothing first under an eye and then over the lid until Sherlock is still.  Sherlock’s breath is on his wrist, and Sherlock’s hands unclasp to rest lightly on his knees.  John feels something inside himself unlock.  He drops his head down to Sherlock’s shoulder, and though his mind is clearer than it has been in weeks, his still-uncoordinated body falls out his chair, leaving his face to plant directly into Sherlock’s belly.
They take a taxi from Victoria station, and Sherlock catches himself staring at John in the setting light angling through the window. It turns his eyes a deep blue and lights on the highest points of his cheeks. When John looks up, Sherlock turns away, feeling that heat come into his cheeks again. He clears his throat.
John lets out a humourless chuckle. “Oh, yeah. ‘M having to beat them off with a stick. Women absolutely love coming back to a flat that reeks of noxious gas or is filled with the stink of putrefying muscle tissue. Really sets the mood.” John realises his drink is done, so he goes off to get one last round for them.
Sherlock thinks about it. He’s not particularly hungry, but perhaps if he and John go out, the rain will pick up enough to try again. “All right,” Sherlock says.
“You’re pretty good at this, you know,” he says, stretching out his leg, resting his foot on Sherlock’s thigh. He didn’t mean to do that, and he considers pulling it back, but Sherlock’s hand comes to light there, holding him steady.
Sherlock doesn’t flinch.  He sighs, leaning forward in his chair, and when he clasps his hands together between his knees, John can feel air shifting over his own knuckles.  He has an impulse to reach out, to grasp Sherlock’s hands in his own, but he doesn’t.
Sherlock chuckles, mirth spreading even to the lines around his eyes, and John lets himself believe that the stars might finally have done something right for a change.
Sherlock presses his lips together. He knows this. He has, of course, endured much worse than day-old hunger pangs, but it doesn’t stop him being uncomfortable. “I know,” Sherlock says, turning his gaze to a straight-ahead middle distance.
enough.” His breath hitches. John touches. Silvery lines and red ones and dark ones that now look like birthmarks but aren’t. “Two years,” Sherlock says. “I’d got captured—twice on purpose—the sadistic are more free with their information when they think they’ve got the upper hand. And once—
much more closely. Sherlock blows a raspberry against Rosie’s cheek before kissing it, and she giggles blowing a very sloppy raspberry against Sherlock’s cheek in response. John exhales. Sherlock steps back, just a bit—but the warmth in his eyes is still there.
Sherlock doesn’t protest as he lets John manhandle him up to the flat, supporting his cold weight against his side as Sherlock’s frozen feet fail to master the gross motor skills of climbing the stairs. Sherlock’s leg is like a block of ice against his own, even through the thick fabric of his jeans. The arm around his shoulders is a dead weight, and when Sherlock tips his head toward him, an icy trickle of water drips from Sherlock’s fringe down John’s cheek.
displaying the smiling face of his wife as it rang, the shirt that wouldn’t button up straight as he dressed one morning. Everything is in pieces, and he is thankful for the weeks of solitude. He’s never been so broken.
The outside chill hits him like a physical blow, stealing the breath from his lungs as it curls in front of him like smoke. He wraps his scarf tighter, does his jacket buttons up the rest of the way. His normal bus route has shut down for the evening, so he walks quickly to the Tube station, thankful for the warmth as he descends the steps. His phone pings with a text alert, and he checks it, expecting (hoping) Sherlock, but it’s from Mike Stamford.
wanted. And, then John stops thinking at all, opening his mouth, taking Sherlock’s bottom lip between his and sucking—moving to his upper lip, tongue tracing the soft skin behind it. Sherlock groans, and John feels it in his bones. Nothing is cold now, not Sherlock, and definitely not himself. His hands move back to Sherlock’s arse, this time to haul him closer, and Sherlock complies, thigh moving to exactly to the right spot between John’s thighs.
trying to tell you.”  He can’t keep the sorrow out of it.  It creeps into every syllable. He tried every way,
The world feels oddly quiet when the song is over—just the hushed sounds of the pub around him as the jukebox sluggishly searches for something else to play.  By the time the music starts up again, John’s thoughts have found him.  They are coming on much too fast, chaotic and confusing as they smack clumsily into the patches of cotton wool inside his drink-addled brain.  He really should go.  He needs to get out of here.
“Go on,” John says.  “What’s yours say?” He leans over to close up the box of beef and broccoli, knee bumping against Sherlock’s now and then under the small kitchen table as he shifts.  How often over the years have they sat right here--sharing a meal or hovering over case notes or chatting through tea and the morning paper,
Sherlock frowns at the evidence before him on the microscope slide. This is not what he’d planned for.  He sighs, rolling his shirtsleeves to his elbow.  He’ll need to think, to work out the best way to proceed from here.
Sherlock smiles, small, trying a bit to soothe the ache he sees there, a reflection of the ache he has lived with for too many years; he knows how it hurts.  “It’s always been true, John,” he says again, this time stepping in to John’s space just a bit.
.  John groans in pleasure as his jaw works around his mouthful.  He looks up at Sherlock, and at first, his eyes are bright, still brimming with the playful mischief he’d had trained on Rosie and her growing puddle of pastel goo, but they darken quickly into something else, something new.  Sherlock’s breath catches.  John’s expression is not unlike the one he has whilst steadying his gun.  Deliberate.
The fingers in his hair play music to the tune of worn brocade fabric, soft leather, honey on toast. The music in his hair keeps playing.  The player strums, and the light glows gold, warm, dry, safe. It goes along in time, the light, following now, going where it’s directed.
“You’ll need at least four changes of clothes and your phone charger and laptop, and Watson will need the only cup she’ll actually drink from.  Oh, and your own shampoo and soap so you don’t
John sniffs and steps into Sherlock’s space, hunching over to watch the dance to its lilting end with him. When it’s done, YouTube brings up its rabbit-trail suggestions on the sidebar. One of them is the Andy Williams version of the song, so John reaches across Sherlock’s arm and clicks it.
So, that’s where he’d gone off to. John finds himself blinking at Sherlock’s thoughtfulness, and his gooey chest warms a bit.
He clears his throat before speaking.  “This is very nice, Sherlock.” There is definitely something of sadness in the small smile he gives.
Rosie claps when she sees him, reaching up from her place on the play-carpet where she’d been stacking blocks. She can’t say his name yet, but she tries, getting the “Sh” and the “k” in there somewhere.
“Was hoping to get one for each of us, but this was the last they had,” he says, heading directly to the kitchen for a cold glass of water, stripping down to his vest as he goes.
telling you,” he says, now sounding a bit irritated, a bit more normal. It’s a small comfort. “You called it ‘playing hide-and-seek.’ I wasn’t.” He falls quiet again, and John’s fingers twitch; he wants to touch. He traces the line of a nearly perfect three-inch circle behind Sherlock’s left rib cage (drill bit?). This one is raised and red, shiny smooth at the highest points of the scar. John’s fingers trace the line of it and then the ridge before pressing into the centre, where it is just skin.
“It’s just allergies,” John says, voice like wet gravel. He takes a sip of his tea, and the warmth smooths over some of the jagged edges a bit. He hums with pleasure, but that
“Please,” he repeats.  He presses his upper and lower lips together.  He isn’t flirting.  He’s not trying to trick her.  At least—she doesn’t think he is.  But, this is where it always goes wrong, isn’t it.
“Good.”  John clears his throat a bit.  “Yeah, good,” and then it is so easy to run a hand along Sherlock’s back as he passes him on the way to his bedroom, to call softly as he pulls sheets from their packaging, shaking them from the cardboard that kept them so tightly in place, “You have anything in for dinner, or should we call for takeaway somewhere?”
The room has grown dark enough in the late afternoon that he has to blink against it, and he comes back to himself a bit. He should switch on another lamp.  He hears music start, coming in tinny through the vent over the hob, funneling in from Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. Carols. She’ll likely be up in an hour or two with some biscuits or mince pies.  He can’t smell them yet, but he will.
still--”  He takes Sherlock’s other hand, and the pounding of blood in Sherlock’s ears is nearly deafening.  “I never did stop,” he says. “Not really.”
He did not account for the small, needy sound John makes as he presses even more fully into Sherlock’s palm.
“Sorry,” he says, barely registering the little line of disappointment between her brows as he runs a hand roughly over his face.  “Sorry, I—” and he doesn’t even try to make an excuse—just shakes his head and tries not to laugh or shout or break something.  They lost at least four mugs and two plates in his first week back.  This might be progress, but it doesn’t really feel like it.  He is so tired of fighting this all the time.  The air rushes out from his nostrils, and his feet walk him to the door.  He’s on the pavement outside before he’s even got both his arms in his jacket.  He looks up to the window, but Mary’s face isn’t there this time.
, made somehow louder by the metallic hum of the fridge, the monotone ticking of a clock from the other room.  His head drops into his hands so he can pinch his eyes between his thumb and forefinger, letting out a quiet groan.
In the end, it was a busy day.   She barely had time to stop for lunch, and only then was she able to check her phone to see if she’d missed any calls or got any texts.  She hadn’t.  She wills herself not to be disappointed.  When she leaves for home after her shift, out of the morgue, the world feels like it’s moving too fast.  It’s hard for her to make too much sense of anything.  She feels tired.
Sherlock leaves his sodden coat on the hook downstairs before climbing up to the flat. His hair is dripping, his toes are rubbing together uncomfortably inside his wet shoes, and the case that should have been a seven turned out to be a two. Well, one and a half. Dull. Disappointing. Solved.
.   “I can’t do it, John.  I don’t know how.” He takes a shaky breath.  He is higher now than he was before, farther and farther away from where he needs to be.
John turns back to his programme, and Sherlock heads to his room. He towels off his hair and changes into his pajama bottoms and a tee shirt. He won’t be going out again today. Or tomorrow. Or possibly Thursday. The world is boring, and boring is bad enough.
John collapses onto his chest, breaths hot and wet against his neck.  Sherlock gasps, getting his breath back as well.  He looks up to John’s perfect face, sweaty and open and plastered with the cheekiest grin he’s ever seen.  He can’t even imagine what his own face must be doing.  He can’t be remotely bothered to figure it out.  He leans forward, and John meets him with a sloppy, open mouthed kiss.  John slides off of him with a quiet groan.  Sherlock kisses him again.
In a lull, John rolls his glass against his wrists.  He sighs with pleasure, eyes falling shut, lips parting, face falling slack.  All of the moisture in Sherlock’s mouth evaporates.
Sherlock shakes his head once and steps over the threshold smoothly. “Won’t be necessary,” he says, trying to recover with a crooked smile. John points to the bottle in his hands, and Sherlock holds it out to him stiffly. “I remembered that this was your favorite,” Sherlock says. But how much has changed since then? Is it still? Perhaps John’s taste has moved on to some new variety in the past two years.
hate the suburbs, but he likes John’s off-tune humming as he puts the coffee on, Rosie’s baby nonsense noises, a house full of life from waking to sleeping.  He likes being able to think better, to feel more…
There is water in his eyes, causing him to blink. He notices that his own heart rate has risen exponentially, his own breath catching at the back of his throat. “Yes,” he says, stepping back, clearing his throat. “Fine.”
John breathes out long and slow, letting his head drop to the middle of Sherlock’s back. He rocks his forehead there, at a complete loss of words. His hands move up, sliding over muscle and raised flesh, inverted flesh, bone and tendon, a million different textures.
Sherlock frowns. “No. All the pieces are there; I just can’t seem to line them up to make any sense.”
Mary shoos them out of the kitchen as she does the clearing up, and Sherlock and John return to their previous spots in the living room. John hands him a scotch, and they drink in relative silence. From the kitchen, there is the distant sound of the tap running, the clink of silverware and plates. But it’s easy to tune that out, to focus on this, the rich flavour of smoke in his mouth (makes him want a cigarette), the relaxed smile on John’s lips, the focus in his eyes (all on Sherlock now), the evenness of their breaths, the way their feet are not touching (but
,” the voice says, breaking through, and the noise quiets again.  Everything stills.  The tone is different this time than last, softer--an explanation rather than a demand.  “You never told me.”
At the daycare, John arrives just in time to get Rosie from the play park, and once they make it to her classroom for her things, she hands Sherlock a piece of sugar paper with glued-on pasta. “Fantastic work, Watson,” he tells her with a professional nod. She lifts her chubby three-year-old arms for John to pick her up, so he does, shifting her to one side so he can loop the strap of her bag around his other arm. He struggles with it, not quite able to catch it before it falls to his elbow.
There is progress, but it’s slow. The up-the-street walks become to-the-park walks, and those become around-the-park walks. The air grows colder, cleaner. Sherlock is gaining stamina, needs less medication, is able to work small cases. John can tell he’s working on something bigger, but he refuses to comment on any details when John asks.
It is indeed a real one next time.  Client.  Kidnapping.  Jealous ex-lover.  If ever there was a case tailor-made to test John Watson’s mental health, this would be the one.  In the end, as usual, John was right.  He was ready.  The child was returned mostly unharmed (physically, anyway), and the jealous ex-lover will spend the next twenty years rotting in a jail cell.  A job well-done.
, John,” Sherlock grits out through chattering teeth. John sets the towel and clothes on the coffee table.
“To make sure you actually do it.” Under his breath he swears, muttering something about “last time.”
They wrap their scarves close around their throats as they leave.  Tube there, taxi back--because of the bags, and if they hurry, they might miss the worst of the weather.  John will call an estate agent for the house on Monday at work, but he and Rosie will need a few things before the movers can get the rest.  John lists them off, planning--and Sherlock
Sherlock eyes him sharply, glaring, but wipes at his face.  Then, he plops back down, right in the centre of the far cushion—where he
Sherlock makes a small noise of acknowledgement, meeting John’s eyes, and he feels the press of his own lips against one another.
He promised to text John when back at Baker Street, so he does, fumbling embarrassingly much with the keypad. He drops fully clothed and face first onto the sofa, shuts his eyes, and listens to the quiet, to the nothing that surrounds him. Two years of running was too long, and even here, mission accomplished and finally home, nothing is right.
It is, John realises. He turns his wrist to check his watch. He’s got to get Rosie from the daycare in forty minutes. As he places a lid on his own cup, John’s brain starts organising his evening: there’s a load of laundry in the washer at his house that needs hanging before it mildews and chicken that needs cooking before it goes off.
When he returns to his bedroom, John is still on his bed. Only now, he is face down and snoring softly into a pillow.  His towel has come loose, revealing the very top of his buttocks, and Sherlock can’t help but stare for a moment.
“Is that why you went away?” Sherlock asks.  “The worst things about me?” He hears a waltz, but his feet won’t move to it.  They can’t find the grounding.
Surprisingly, Sherlock offers to help with packing (likely at Mrs Hudson’s urging), but John declines; this house business feels like something he has to do on his own.  And it is cathartic in a way, all the sorting and binning and packing and cleaning. He occupies himself with going through wardrobes and cupboards and drawers, creating piles: sell-donate-move.  The move pile is always small, easily fitted into a neatly-labeled box or two. He has a couple of Facebook friends over each day to take a chair here, an end table there, and slowly but steadily, those things are gone, leaving more and more blank space, bare walls and empty corners.
“What?” John asks, forcing his attention back to Sherlock. It takes a moment for it to settle; everything feels blurry and dull.  His thoughts are sloshing around inside his throbbing skull. He sniffs.
John rubs wearily at his eyes, closing them tightly against the fluorescent glow of his computer monitor.
“Yes,” he lies.  “Fine.” He fights the urge to fling the thing out the window.  Instead, he takes a shaky breath. He nods.  He could keep lying, dismiss the whole thing as a mistake, but he doesn’t.
They move together and quietly next door.  John is once again blown away by the delicate beauty of this space, by the careful attention Sherlock took here, right down to the soft music playing from a discreet speaker he’s tucked away somewhere.  John walks over to watch the rise and fall of his daughter’s chest, to listen to the sweet sound of her breathing, and after a moment, Sherlock comes to stand next to him.
“You should,” she says.  She knows all too well the pain of this unrequited mess.  She has known for years who really holds Sherlock’s heart.  It could never be her.
John blows through the opening in the lid of his paper cup before taking a sip. “Too right.”  He sips carefully, not wanting to burn his tongue. He can’t help but hum in satisfaction as he takes his first taste. “Thank you,” John says, raising his cup a little. He means for the tea of course, but he could just as easily mean for the case, for the run, for the
“Then, why?  Are you really that cr-“  She shakes her head once, forcing herself to finish the word, "cruel?"
).  He starts for the kitchen, dropping his hand on John’s shoulder, a benign gesture they have shared hundreds of times through the years.
She opens her mouth, trying to find some way to respond, but the world has gone fuzzy— warm and slanted and her heart is beating loudly in her ears and—
It’s not terribly loud or crowded in the bar, but the opening strains of the song are quiet, a bit difficult to hear well, but it doesn’t matter.  He recognises those familiar rolling drums easily enough.  John snorts into his drink, and though he has had this song memorised from the time he was about ten, he listens to the lyrics like they are brand new.
. The only logical course of action is to perform a trial. Luckily, they live in London and are out in the weather rather a lot.
It’s still fairly early, but Rosie is down for the night, Sherlock is now back at Baker Street, and John is here, alone.  There is some comfort knowing that Baker Street is ready and waiting for them whenever they’re ready. Logically, he knows that it’s just a matter of sorting all the moving house mess over here, but who knows how long that will take? The house feels cold, empty and gaping in a way it hasn’t done in ages.
sentimental.”  John raises his glass.  “Cheers, Sherlock.” His smile could light the room, is as warm as the liquid in his glass.
“That’s no good at all,” John explains, frowning. “Did they find the most nasally-voiced man in the world on purpose?”
Sherlock looks at him, not talking now. Has he solved it? Or maybe they are meant to go to the library, or something about concrete scrapings? John blinks and tries to clear the goo from the back of his throat. That
Lestrade is just behind him as John follows the sound of Sherlock’s footsteps, pounding wetly down a darkened alley. Less than half an hour ago, after two days of near-solid investigation, they’d finally tracked down their murderer to a derelict flat above a butcher’s shop in Hackney. But it was never going to be
. In the rain. It meant something important. And besides…” John pauses to smile a bit (to himself?). “Kisses in the rain always seem a bit more—something.”
Molly wakes before her alarm and blinks up at the ceiling.  Her eyes hurt.  She rubs at them a bit, presses cool fingertips to the heat of the swollen bags underneath.  Oh, she knows so much better than this.  She should have had more water last night.  Less wine.  She sighs.  The sun isn’t even up yet, but neither her brain nor her bladder care much about that.
“John,” Sherlock says, and really—it’s just a breath. It’s just a breath that puffs against John’s cheeks, warming his neck under his collar. It’s just a breath that makes his palms sweat until he has to open and close his hand to stop it shaking. It’s just a breath, but maybe—maybe it’s
Sherlock remembers his own hands when he feels John’s slide from his neck around his back, pressing them closer, flinging their towels to the floor, aligning their bodies.  Sherlock mirrors him, arms around his back before trailing his fingers down the line of his spine to the crease of his buttocks.  He presses a bit into the warmth there, at the very base of his spine, and John moans into his mouth as he wraps a leg around Sherlock, pulling their groins together. Sherlock strokes that spot again, needing more pressure from John’s body, needing that sound from John’s mouth, wondering how he has ever lived without hearing it before.
They move slowly over the floor of the lounge, neither of them either leading or following; both are simply drifting (two drifters, off to see the world), and it’s as fluid as water, as natural as breathing itself.
, he thinks), looking up, flaying himself open, letting it all show.  He takes one of John’s hands and places it on his own cheek, holds it there quietly, thumb stroking against John’s for a moment.  “I fucking love you, too,” and then he takes him as deeply as he can, makes it wet, sucks and bobs and uses his tongue, one hand to make up the difference, the other to tease and press.  He gluts himself on it, smiling around his mouthful at the grunts and
Sherlock nods.  “Of course it’s okay.”  Something softens then, tension breaking, and both of them exhale.
John tries to protest again, but he can only sniff around the blob of snot that has suddenly decided to escape his right nostril. He catches it with a serviette. Jesus.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says. He pops the pill and swallows it down. John watches the line of his throat as he does. He lets his hand light on Sherlock’s shoulder, gives it a little squeeze. Sherlock’s eyes close as he brings his own hand, large and warm, to cover it. John lets the moment linger, brushes his index finger against the skin of Sherlock’s neck as he pulls away.
John jumps a little at Sherlock’s quiet voice, unexpected, from the direction of the sofa.  He hadn’t noticed him there.
And then, John opens his mouth and eats it. He gets a bit of cream on his nose. Mary wipes it off and laughs. They both do. (Hand, arm, shoulder, leg, nape, cheek, knee) Sherlock puts his plate down on the table and sips again from his scotch. This time, it tastes a bit bitter—probably something to do with the sweetness on his tongue from the toffee. He sips again.
Sherlock stands beside him and peers inside.  He feels the breath leave his lungs, his face blanch.  The shoebox.  His fingers reach in to touch the surface of it.
Sherlock retrieves his phone from his pocket at the sound of the text alert, reading as he dodges foot traffic along Baker Street, heavy now in the early evening commute.
John’s arm twitches again before his hand comes up. “It’s—” John stops himself and hesitates, hand paused halfway to Sherlock’s face. John seems to have a little think, and then, John’s thumb is swiping just below his lower lip. It is startling—but warm, nice. “You had a bit of crust just there.”
He pauses in the doorway, raking his eyes over the entire room before running a hand on the wall next to the sofa.  “Still can’t believe you managed to find the same wallpaper,” he says. He walks around the living room, inspecting both new additions and the items salvaged.  “Wow, this looks really great. Really good.”
“Wh-what are you doing here?” she asks, trying and failing to keep her voice steady as she stares steadfastly into Sherlock Holmes’s infuriatingly handsome face.
It happened this time, as it so often seems to, in a moment of utter domesticity.  He’d heard the whistle of the kettle in the kitchen, the clinking of mugs set down on the worktop, the opening and shutting of the fridge.  Mary waddled heavily into the living room, her pregnant belly reaching the area seemingly ages before the rest of her, and placed a steaming mug of tea on the table in front of John.  He looked up at her, and she smiled at him with a pretty little curve of her pink lips, and like the crashing of a tidal wave—he
John doesn’t even wait for Sherlock to not reply before scooting Sherlock’s feet out of his way on the sofa.  Sherlock, for his part, doesn’t react other than to stay where he was placed.  His bare toes and the balls of his feet press a bit against the outside of John’s thigh once he’s settled in, but John doesn’t much mind.  He simply balances his plate of takeaway on the arm of the sofa and tucks in as he switches on the telly.
“I’ve got a kit at home. Antibiotics, too. I really don’t fancy waiting four hours at hospital for something that will take me half an hour to tend to on my own. At home.”
John shifts, his nose brushing Sherlock’s back, lips finding a raised scar, and his entire body thrums with the answering shudder beneath it all. “I’m still here, Sherlock.”
dead, don’t you see? And I—I would rather you lived, you lived and moved on. I never intended to return. You were meant to be happy, meant to live, and I—was meant to die.”
“I hope you know what you’re doing,” Sherlock says, eyes fixed to where John is tearing at the foil.
.”  He laughs, and Sherlock cannot help but join him, so full of joy and relief, he doesn’t know what to do with it all.  John lifts a hand to his arm, squeezing, just like the kitchen.
“What?” John asks, voice sleep-rough, still shaking the grogginess of the morning off as he waits for the tea to steep.
John’s eyes open immediately, and Sherlock feels like he’s been caught.  His breathing goes rapid as he fights every instinct he has to flee.  But John smiles—the softest, most open thing—and he rolls back off of his belly, turning to face him.  Then, John reaches for Sherlock’s arm, tugging him in gently, and Sherlock relaxes into it, doesn’t resist, and John doesn’t let go.  As he lies back, Sherlock’s own towel shifts almost completely open as faces John a bit more fully.  He considers righting it, but leaves it.  He honestly has nothing he wants to hide.
,” and John turns enough to bury his fingers into Sherlock’s damp curls, nails sliding against a sweaty scalp, and he opens his hot mouth against Sherlock’s, chasing the cool tongue, the drip of melting ice they now share.
Sherlock exhales, his trail of mingled smoke and misted breath nearly opaque in the lamplight. “Smoking,” he says. He flicks his ash, and the entire thing breaks from the damp of the paper. Sherlock frowns, nearly a pout. “They’re all wet now.”
This chapter is unbeta-ed, so apologies for lingering mistakes and typos. I've no one to blame but myself! :-)
Sherlock looks up to John and clears his throat. “This was one of the waltzes from last year. They don’t use traditional music, so I wanted to see it.” He clicks a bit at the mouse, starting it over again. “It’s… nice.”
.  Sherlock observes two large blue Ikea bags over one shoulder and a rolling suitcase with one small box perched on top, leaning precariously against the handle.  It threatens to topple as John stops briefly to say hello to Sherlock in the sitting room before unceremoniously turning to haul his things up the flight of stairs to his bedroom.
Sherlock can’t find his voice; his throat won’t work.  John is gaping at him. He presses his lips together before trying again.  “I tried for one a week,” he admits, “but sometimes it was more.” He doesn’t like thinking about it.  “Sometimes I was--indisposed.” His eyes burn.
John blinks at the space where Sherlock had been. He sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face as he gives his body a moment to calm down. He feels his throat pull tight, blinking against whatever is making his eyes sting. Though his cheeks are very warm under his fingers, he feels colder than he can ever remember being.
The drizzle is wet, just shy of freezing.  It stings Sherlock’s cheeks and too-easily seeps under his scarf, clings to the wool of his coat.  His icy fingers cramp around the key in his hand as he lets himself in to his flat. On the door, Mrs Hudson has hung a wreath that smells of pine.  The droplets that cling to its edges shimmer and then fall as he opens and shuts the door.
“Well,” John says, clearing his throat as Sherlock’s fingers flutter beneath his.  He stands, tightening his grip enough to guide Sherlock to stand with him. “Dinner’s done.”  He smiles. He steps in close. “Telly’s boring.”
When John returns, he has two wine glasses in his hands—white, not the red Sherlock brought. “Mary said we should save the red for dinner.”
A final 221b to round out this series. Real Life got in the way of me doing all of the prompts, but before the new year, I wanted to finish this sweet little story.  It's all going to be all right.
“Fine,” Sherlock says, and he’s standing, turning toward the door that leads to the corridor—to his bedroom. And, that’s when John sees. He feels the breath leave his lungs.
John meets Harry at Speedy’s for Rosie.  The smell of her baby shampoo head is like heaven, and he’s so glad to see her again.  He doesn’t get to savour the moment long; she’s squirmy, hyped up on sugar and has that look in her eyes like she hasn’t slept enough.  It must have been a good weekend, then.
Sherlock’s skin itches, the cooling sweat along his arms an odd contrast to the heat gathering in his gut.  Patches of his shirt stick to his back, and perhaps he should lean away, let the air circulate around him, but he hasn’t the will to make himself move.  Right here, he and John are physically
She pats him on the arm as she leaves, and whatever moment they’d had before has totally evaporated.
“Shower’s free,” John says, sitting on the bed next to him.  To break the tension a bit, he sniffs loudly in Sherlock’s general direction, making a face.  “Ugh—get
Sherlock sniffs. “You asked me me why—that first night.” There is another pause, and John lets it be what it is, waiting for Sherlock to continue. He does. “But, Mary was there, and I decided—”
“John,” Sherlock says, and it sounds like perhaps it was meant to be a warning, but it’s resigned—desperately sad. “Please. I don’t...” He clears his throat, and it’s emotional, more emotional than John is accustomed to from him.
With some effort, John manages to get the door of the flat open and Sherlock on the sofa with a blanket. He finds a towel in the bathroom and some fresh pajamas in Sherlock’s room. In the living room, Sherlock has finally started shivering, hands clutching tightly to the blanket as his entire body convulses as though he’s having a fit.
“John.” It’s barely even a whisper.  Sherlock’s face won’t stop doing that thing, and John’s heart clenches inside his chest.
Sherlock fits his hand against John’s nape, thumb brushing the soft skin under his ear, deepening the kiss, becoming something brand new.
John clears his throat. “It’s fine,” he says, and he takes their plates back to the kitchen. He does the washing up, letting the rush of running water drown out the sound of the music and cheering coming from the lounge. When he returns, the couple is different, one of the pop stars, and they are dancing a not-too-bad salsa. If he sits closer to Sherlock this time around, Sherlock doesn’t mention it. And if Sherlock rests his head against John’s shoulder, John doesn’t say anything either.
His stomach reels; he can’t shut his eyes against any of it:  the noise, the colour, the never-ending kaleidoscope of falling too fast.  His head sinks deeper into his pillow. It is not a comfort; it feels like a hand clamped tightly round his nostrils, sealing his mouth shut.  It feels like suffocating.
“What?” John manages, witless, watching Sherlock wrestle with his trousers until he can pull the mobile from the pocket.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say, so he follows John’s lead, sitting in an armchair when John sits on the couch. “Any, er… any news on the elephant thing?”
Sherlock is not at the flat when he arrives, and he’s almost glad since he is wheezing like an old man when he reaches the top of the stairs, soggy and miserable. He feels like he’s moving under water, slogging through an ocean of snot. He might need to call Dr Howe at the surgery for something stronger than Lemsip, but the thought of all that effort only exhausts him further. For now, he only wants comfortable pajama bottoms and rest.
Sherlock shrugs.  It’s possible one of John’s would have got mixed in with his.  He shifts the top box to the floor and hands John the pen he’s been using to break the tape.  John takes it and stabs through, dragging it along the seam, lifting the edges with a slight pop to break the rest.  His brow furrows.
. He inhales like it will save his life. But, he is not in the right place, not in the right time. The smell of Claire de la Lune is sickening in the back of his throat. It is hard to breathe around it; he is choking.
, of John’s bare skin against his bare skin, hot under his palm.  He did not expect the smooth surface of the scar ridge to fall directly in the centre of his thumb pad, enabling him to feel it in tandem with the rougher skin below.  He cannot contain his gasp.  He cannot pull away.
Sherlock makes sandwiches.  He piles on cheese and mustard and pickle and lettuce, even slices a tomato to make a proper job of it.  He flicks the switch on the kettle and plops teabags into two mugs.  There is an unopened packet of crisps in the cupboard.  He pours a mound next to each sandwich, nicking one from the bag before he closes it.
“No,” John says, shaking his head.  “That’s not what I mean.” He reaches out to brush his thumb along the back of Sherlock’s wrist.
Sherlock rings the bell and waits. He fiddles a bit with the wine bottle in his hands, fitting his thumbnail into the edge of the foil around the base of its neck. He doesn’t wait long.
cold or uncomfortable. John’s hands are on his neck, in his hair, at his back, at his waist, and every single place they go, sliding easily, they leave an aching sort of heat in their wake.
Sherlock wipes the tips of his fingers on a piece of kitchen roll and lays his forearm on the edge of the table, rolling it so his palm faces up.
He has no idea which route this is, and he doesn’t care.  He stays until the driver announces the last stop.  And, what do you know—there’s a Tube station
Sherlock presses, presses, presses in closer, hands under his jumper, dipping just below the waistband of his trousers at the back.  Sherlock is pouring in and around him like liquid home, filling in all the cold and empty spaces.  John drinks, greedy, until he will, he will, he will
The park is dark, but Sherlock knows his way. His eyes miss nothing, gathering data in case he needs it later. And after what seems like an age, he finds John. John, who is not injured but is simply sitting on a bench as though he were waiting.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice is a warning, a plea, a breathy growl, and he knows he should temper this sort of thing, maintain the status quo they’ve been so careful at keeping, but—
It’s dark outside when he wakes.  The lounge is dimly lit with only a couple of lamps. Sherlock is sitting sideways in his chair, facing him with legs dangling over the arm as he reads something on his phone.
He scrubs a hand across his face, dimly aware of the rising sound of the water heating in the kettle.  Okay, yes--he
Lestrade catches up then, shouting into his phone for the rest of his team, and he pulls the man from his oily puddle and hauls him away.
Sherlock can follow the light too, like a beacon, and he does, and he sinks.  And he’s scared, so he goes slowly, but he follows the light and sinks and sinks and sinks.  It doesn't feel like falling at all.
After nearly half an hour, they locate the cable. Sherlock sighs with relief. This ordeal is finally,
John takes Rosie’s little hand, leads her upstairs.  She takes the steps slowly, but when she gets to the landing, Sherlock is waiting for them both.
John finds the right channel and settles in.  The programme is interesting, and John comments through it from time to time.  Sherlock does turn his head to watch after a while, occasionally grunting in agreement or derision in turns.
“But yeah.”  John shrugs. “New start and all that,” and together, they work at getting the duvet into its cover.
He turns the corner just in time to watch Sherlock duck a blow, but as he’s crouched down, the murderer nimbly tumbles backwards to avoid a hit. John sees the flash of metal, and he charges forward, but not quickly enough—the blade catches Sherlock at the side before John can get there. With a rush, he disarms him with a swift kick and slams the man into the pavement, knee on his back, hands pinning his wrists.
easy. Knife in hand, the man lashed out immediately, nearly catching Lestrade in the face. John had pulled Sherlock back, which gave him just enough time to jump from the window and shimmy down the fire escape. Sherlock sprang after him, leaving John and Lestrade working to simply keep up.
For two hours, Sherlock pretends to look at things under the microscope while he listens for any sign that the rain will pick up. John reads in his armchair.
“I’m starting with Bart’s on Wednesday,” John says as he removes his coat and scarf.  “Mike put in a good word.”
Despite being cool for the first time in a week, Rosie fusses and squirms almost constantly.  She hasn’t slept well or long enough for days.  She very much does and then extremely does
After it’s done, John takes his used plate to the kitchen and considers going on up to bed, but he’s not quite ready yet, so he puts the leftovers in the fridge and finishes his washing up.  He hears the sound of the television cutting off and half expects Sherlock to be up and moving (finally), but when John returns to the lounge, Sherlock is back to his official strop position—taking up the whole of the sofa, toes near to pointed so as to occupy as much space as possible.
John sighs, pulling the scarf from his own neck. He presses it to Sherlock’s wound and moves Sherlock’s hand, pressing it over top, in a silent instruction for him to hold it in place. Some things never change. He pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “All right. Fine, but—like
“She’s sleeping,” John says from his side, and there is no small amount of relief in his tone.  “Properly zonked this time I think.  I hope, Jesus.”
coming to an end. And, he’s hungry. It is lunchtime on a Saturday, and the shop is filled with other customers. When he steps up to it, Sherlock groans at the state of the queue. There are fourteen people before them and only one working till. His stomach growls audibly.
John smiles, huffing against the stiff, chemical-smelling bundle of new fabric he’s gathered in his hands.  This is a variant of a conversation they’ve had dozens of times over the past weeks, so often in fact, that it has long since stopped surprising him when Sherlock deigns to shop or cook or eat.  Things this time are definitely not the same as at the Baker Street of the past, but this is where they are now. It’s taken quite a journey to get here, to get home.
Outside, John walks close enough that their hands brush. He looks up at Sherlock with an intensity that Sherlock rather enjoys, and neither one of them can seem to stop smiling entirely.   The clouds overhead swirl in the wind, the air thick with moisture, but the rain refuses to fall. Sherlock wonders now if it really matters.
Data: He cannot stop picturing John’s lips—the way they wrap around the rim of his teacup, the way they part with his laughter, the way they press together in annoyance, the way they go hard and firm when he’s ready to throw a punch or when he’s drawn his gun. The shape they make when he says Sherlock’s name—sometimes soft with affection, other times turned up with a joke, often set firm in annoyance.
It’s busier than usual for a day so cold, but it’s almost Christmas, and tourists and Londoners alike are there to take photos in front of the tree, to listen to the choir of carolers.  John slows and then stops before them, watching. His eyes narrow against the cold, and he sniffs, but his lips move, only just, silently forming the words along with them.
He observes the delighted look on Rosie’s face, the soft posture of his best friend.  He notes the warmth of John’s fingers through the fabric of his shirt, the solid weight of his hand on his arm--and suddenly, he is light-headed, absolutely sure that if he were standing, he would wobble.
Next to him, Sherlock inhales, just under his ear. “Smells good,” he says, and his breath warms John’s neck. Sherlock doesn’t move an inch, and John swears his voice goes even deeper. “I can’t wait.”
Sherlock’s breath is in his hair, against his temple. John’s cheek is just below Sherlock’s jaw, chin resting at Sherlock’s shoulder. His heart is not at the ceiling; his head is not swirling.  He feels more grounded than he has ever been. His heart beats against Sherlock’s chest, at the core of his very being, and Sherlock’s answers back in a steady rhythm, warm and sure against his own.
as he presses closer, giving Sherlock some relief by dragging his belly against him as he straddles him fully, and good God, now it is Sherlock’s turn to moan.  John bends to suck on his neck, and Sherlock bares even more of it for him as he lets his hands roam over shoulders and collar bone, through the hair covering his pectoral muscles and pressing into perfect nipples.  John slides their bodies together in a slow rhythm as he traces the shallow spaces between Sherlock’s ribs, dips into his naval, massages into his flanks.
“Here,” he says, handing John a glass of water and dose of the Lemsip capsules he’d left unopened on the coffee table before. John swallows them with a painful grimace, throat screaming at him for the effort.
John takes Sherlock’s hand and leads him back to Baker Street, and when they make it inside the door, John pushes him, wet and squelching against the wall as he closes the door. This kiss is louder, wetter even than the ones outside, and John smells of green things and rain.
Rosie drains the rest of her cocoa and hops down from her seat.  “Sh-lk,” She says, shimmying her little bottom, dancing. “Shk, sh--loooook.”  She knows this place.  John smiles.
“Jesus,” John breathes, pressing back.  Sherlock’s answering gasp sparks and sizzles against John’s skin just as Sherlock’s lips find his neck.  Jesus.
Nearly a week later, Sherlock wakes in the middle of the night to the sound of his text alert. From John. Specific location in Regent’s Park.
By the time he’s finished, it’s late, and he can hardly keep his eyes open. He dumps his half-drunk cup of tea down the drain before climbing into bed feeling knackered, but happy.
John shifts a bit on the bench, clears his throat, and the exhale from his lips is a sultry summer breeze against Sherlock’s jaw.  Sherlock turns his head, chasing it, leaning in just that much closer, and that humid warmth is now as present on his lips as the sweet cream he can taste there even still.  His mouth opens without him telling it to; his eyes fall shut.
Like John, he’s divested himself of his tee shirt, but he’s also rolled his pajama bottoms to his knees.
Sherlock’s got the telly on but pauses it when John enters. “There’s a curry for you in the microwave,” he says.
John lets his own hands continue to roam down Sherlock’s back, his sides, his arms, building friction, heat beginning to rise. And, Sherlock continues to nuzzle at John’s chest. Oh, God—John’s really feeling it now,
John’s eyes are closed, breath soft–slow, deep, and even.  Blue, wintry light catches at the very tips of his eyelashes, and Sherlock thinks that if he were to touch, they would leave traces of silver on his fingers.  Tiny whiskers glitter along John’s jaw, and Sherlock imagines running his cheek there, gathering diamonds along his skin.
want her snack or her drink.  She refuses to stay seated for more than three minutes at a time.  Sherlock walks her up and down the main aisle, letting her slowly navigate the stairs on clumsy legs, and then he walks them to the lobby as she
Sherlock moans, thunder in his belly, and drags John up with him as he stands, hands sliding along the back of John’s sweaty arms, fingernails gathering sweat along the small of his back, and what he needs more than anything right now is to press his chest to John’s, bite his earlobe, and feel the exact contour of his gluteal muscle against his hand.
John isn’t in yet when they arrive at the house, so Sherlock begins the evening routine as he has observed and participated in throughout his weeks here.  He washes Rosie’s hands and prepares her tea, cutting up strawberries and sweet potato and bits of chicken for her.  She smashes them into her tray and into her face and into her hair, and Sherlock sits at the table to tell her about the case he’s working, smoothly retrieving her cup every time she drops it to the floor.  She enthusiastically interjects with her own thoughts on the matter in between bites of her supper.
how silly this is becoming, but he has also chosen this battle.  He does not yield his space in the slightest.  He clears his throat and makes a show of turning a page of his novel even as he pushes back against Sherlock.  He can hold his ground, and Sherlock can
“Sherlock,” John says, throat full of gravel. He tries to swallow around it, but it doesn’t work. He coughs. “
nice,” John rumbles, eyes dark and smiling, mischief back again but in a way now that reminds Sherlock of curling smoke.  Heedless of his dripping, rainbow-coloured hand, John reaches out and pulls at Sherlock’s wrist, guiding the ice cream back to his lips for another bite, this time with eyes on Sherlock’s eyes as he does so; lips and
John hums in the affirmative as he looks through the choices.  Sherlock fills the kettle, switches it on, and listens as John tells him about his day as they wait for it to boil.
His lips wrap around the chocolate and then purse as he lifts up, cheeks hollowing with the effort, and Sherlock cannot tear his eyes away.  This is indecent.  This is
He presses against the sides of the cut a little to see what he’s dealing with, and then he begins to clean it, fingers gentle, pulling back every time Sherlock sucks air in through his teeth. He doesn’t bother with
John’s hands come up to Sherlock’s nape, fingers threading through damp curls as Sherlock exhales long and slow, hot and wonderful, against his solar plexus. Sherlock’s body against his is still cold, as he moves a leg over to straddle John’s lap, but the weight is…
.  It would ruin everything.  He spent so long pushing this feeling away because what else was he going to do?  It’s just--it was much easier to keep it buried before Sherlock came back to share his day-to-day again, was once more in his space, breathing his air, filling his thoughts, his dr-- No.  It’s better, yeah, to let a good thing stay a good thing-- a
“Very good,” John replies, letting his own face reflect the gravity here. He is serious about this, too. Sherlock shifts closer first before stepping away, a silent promise, and then he’s gone, giving John a moment of breathing room.
Sherlock’s recovery is slow. And, if for nothing else, John is at least able to be a little grateful for the time it gives him to begin sorting himself out.
John gives it up, pulling his scarf over his mouth as he walks. And it’s started drizzling. Perfect. He walks faster.
Sherlock’s nose brushes his cheek when he leans in, and John closes the distance, kissing him.  Why did it have to take them so long to get here? Something this new shouldn’t feel so familiar: the sounds of their shared breath, the small, wet noise of lips-on-lips, the pounding of his own heartbeat steady in his ears, the rustling of fabric as they shift closer, closer, closer.  His hands slide over fabric, along Sherlock’s waist, ribs, chest, nape, and he opens, opens, opens his mouth to drink in the warmth, taste the lingering spice from dinner. He could do this forever.
.  He mentally pens each rise and fall of John’s voice as notes on the page, circles and dots gliding along the manuscript staff.
John coughs, doubling forward. Sherlock is at his side instantly, hand hovering just over his chest but not touching, all humour evaporated. And, with more gentleness than John thought possible of him, he lifts John’s left foot where it’s trapped in the tangle of his trousers and boots. Sherlock lifts the soaked fabric as best he can so he can undo the boot laces, sliding it off first, and then the trouser leg, and then his sock.  His fingers brush the top arch of his foot, and John shivers a bit at it—but it’s nice, soothing. John drops his foot to the floor with a soft thump and Sherlock taps his other leg at the calf—a silent instruction. John lifts that one, and Sherlock repeats the steps down to the caress of his foot, this time a thumb smoothing over the length of his big toe.  “’S’nice,” John mutters, and he realises that he’s closed his eyes again.
By the film’s end, it’s close enough to her regular nap time that Rosie does doze a bit, and Sherlock hopes her routine is restored well enough to allow her to sleep through tonight.
He stands, thinking it’s past time for him to get away from this little slice of suburban domesticity, but when he does, he sways a bit on his feet. John reaches out, standing, steadying him, arm around his waist. Sherlock suddenly longs for Baker Street—for dark wallpaper and smooth leather and soft sheets and silk dressing gowns and the smell of tea and the feel of the fire warming his skin, and when he drops his head onto John’s shoulder he feels it
John returns that evening with a small fan under his arm from the shops.  A drop of sweat falls off the tip of his nose to the coffee table as he bends to set it down.  His work shirt is soaked through under the arms and along the centre of his back.
John watches Sherlock watching his computer screen, his eyes following the lines of the dance that John can’t see. The light from the monitor makes Sherlock’s eyes light up, bright turquoise.
“Let me,” Sherlock says, taking it and fitting it over his own shoulder. He presses his lips together in a smile as he meets John’s eyes and then—he leans in, close. John’s heart pounds in his chest, and he can
“That footwork is abysmal,” Sherlock says, watching a professional dancer do his best to lift his lumbering celebrity partner off the ground.
John smiles as he stands. A drip of water falls from the tip of his nose down to his chin. Has it been raining this whole time? Sherlock hadn’t noticed.
in those books and trinkets, clothing and furniture.  Far too much of this loss has become, in Sherlock’s mind, an overwrought metaphor for the entirety of the past four years, singed and scorched, reduced to ash.  He knows ash.
Though it’s midday, the grey outside keeps the flat darker than it should be.  He hangs his coat over two pegs so it will dry, opens his scarf over the back of his desk chair.
John has been by with Rosie throughout the renovation to help decorate the downstairs, to put things right, to build it all back.  He has not been upstairs, but not for lack of inquiry. (This must be a promising sign, Sherlock hopes.)
John squeezes his shoulder before moving toward the fridge as Sherlock continues to speak, interjecting only once Sherlock is finished.  “Back to square one then.  Fan
John kisses him, wrapping his leg around Sherlock’s and pressing even closer.  They are both tacky with sweat and semen and saliva from their toes to their knees to their bellies.  They will need to clean up soon, but not just yet.  Not yet.  Sherlock settles his head in the crook of John’s neck and shoulder, nuzzles in, and hums.
Sherlock tastes salt, following the line of John’s collarbone with his tongue, lipping him where it juts.  He presses fingers along John’s ribs, thumb pads into nipples, and he slides, sweeping hands down to John’s waistband and back up with lips now around a hardened nipple.  John groans, pressing into whatever part of Sherlock he can.  Sherlock slides his hand down again, dipping just below the elastic, the texture of coarse hair under his fingers, first against the pads, then back again with knuckles.  He purposefully avoids John’s penis as he traces the elastic again, drawing chemical equations with his tongue over John’s sternum.
,” he says again, voice raw, desperate.  He runs the tip of his nose back and forth, breathing, tasting, higher and higher from shoulder to neck to cheek, and John kisses him then, guiding them until the backs of Sherlock’s legs meet the bed.  They fall together.
, he thinks), hands brushing lightly over flanks and thigh, stroking up and back as he spreads John’s legs, relaxed bend to the knees falling outward as he settles between them.  His thumbs trace the crease where John’s arse curves into his thigh, sweep over his perineum.  He feathers a trail of chaste kisses from inner knee to the soft skin high on John’s inner thigh before moving up the other leg in a mirrored path.  He dips down, lowering himself slowly, and places his tongue against the slit, tasting, curling the leaking fluid into his mouth.  He presses his lips into an open mouthed kiss there, and he takes a moment to suckle, thumbs tracing light circles at the base of John’s penis and then before and behind John’s testicles, stroking, petting, breathing in musk and soap and sweat.
Sherlock stays in his pajamas the next day. His mood seems to be placid rather than bored, which is good. They move around each other easily. Sherlock spends a little time at his microscope, more time on the sofa reading or just being. John potters about with laundry and a bit of writing. Late in the evening, John lifts his head from his computer at the sound of Sherlock tuning his violin.
John follows him into the kitchen, and they chat about the appliances and when Mrs Hudson will be moving back in from her sister’s.  Sherlock feels the weight of his question, unasked, like lead in his pockets.
, John thinks as he can actually feel the sweat gathering in his leg hair.  Sherlock shifts just so, and the light from the window behind him catches the edges of his curls, the curve of his shoulders, lining him entirely in a moonlit halo, cool blue.
After he’s made his choices and squishes several puffy bags of bedding and pillows in the boot, he steers toward Baker Street rather than the house.  It’ll be time to pick up Rosie soon anyway, and if he can drop this stuff off now, it will be a few less things to pack for the movers.
It’s shit.  The flash has made a bright blank spot in the middle of the photo, and the place where his bum had just been is unattractively sunken and wrinkled.  He can do better than that, so he makes a proper job of it. He switches on the overhead light, cancels the flash, smooths fabric, pats cushions, and snaps a new photo.  This one is much better.
“I know we often work late hours, and if you want, if you and Rosie would like to, I mean--there’s room to grow, but I’ll understand if you don’t want to upset--”
), so Sherlock complies by rote.  He finds his lightest weight pyjama bottoms in the dresser and puts them on, already hating every place they are in contact with his skin.  He rolls them to his knees.  He cannot abide the thought of a tee shirt
Sherlock makes a sound of agreement.  “Probably specifically to annoy you,” he says, but the sarcasm is soft, and Sherlock’s eyes are smiling at him in earnest.
John’s smile quirks, chin lifting at Lestrade’s team coming round the corner, just now catching them up.  He smoothly stows his gun behind him before they arrive, shifting then just so his head blocks the sun.  It momentarily gives him the appearance of being lit from behind, a golden halo.  The breeze that cools their faces carries the scent of John’s aftershave and fresh sweat with it, and Sherlock breathes it in on instinct, hoarding it at the bottom of his lungs like cigarette smoke.
,” and John turns fully toward him, pressing their lips together, fingers threading through his hair, setting sparks along his scalp where blunt fingernails scratch.
She’s drying her hands on a dishtowel when she hears the doorbell.  Instinctively, she turns down the music in case it’s a neighbor complaining at the noise.  It isn’t.
Pleased to once again have his spot open, John nods once, sits, and fits his thumb between the pages where he’d placed a post-it note to mark his place.  Slowly, Sherlock’s feet come again to press against his thigh, and John does his level best to ignore it, flicking pages and focusing entirely on the words in front of him rather than the toes which are now kneading to the point of pinching his leg hairs under his trousers.  He can stand his ground.  He
John answers with a bright smile. “Sherlock! Come in!” The skin around his eyes is crinkled, irises shining, and Sherlock doesn’t even realise he’s staring until John cocks his head a bit. “Or, you could stay out there. I’ll pass you a plate when dinner is ready.”
He unfolds it and brings it to Sherlock’s still-dripping hair as he moves next to Sherlock on the sofa, kneeling on the cushion for a little extra height, leaning in close so he can see what he’s doing. Sherlock presses a freezing, vibrating shoulder against John’s belly. John tries to ignore it as he fits his hands around the shape of Sherlock’s skull and moves the towel gently front to back as he dries Sherlock’s fringe and forehead, then crown, then nape, dropping his height as he goes.
“Hello, Mary,” Sherlock says. She’s got flour under her fingernails and a fleck of sauce on the front of her blouse.
Of course, the nephew isn’t missing at all. Not in the least. Three minutes on his phone’s browser show that he is on a cruise in the Caribbean with his mistress. But John is much more likely to abandon an itinerary of dripping noses and skin conditions if there is a
“Fuck being safe!” John growls, cutting him off.  He sets the glass down heavily on the table and puts his hands on his knees, breathing deeply.
Sherlock knows he’s asking, that despite the key he still carries, he doesn’t feel like he can simply come in--which of course, he can.
The programme ends, and Sherlock switches the telly off. John takes his plate to the sink and just leaves it there. He’ll do the washing up later. He returns to the lounge to the sound of music. Not Sherlock’s violin this time, but a lady’s voice singing “Moon River,” coming from the speakers of Sherlock’s laptop. John cocks his head in a silent question.
At the bottom, he lifts a heavy ornament, a polished piece of fire-coloured glass in the shape of a phoenix.  A gift from a client, from that long-ago life. He lets the weight of it settle in his palm, brushes a thumb over the curved edge at the arc of its wing.  It stays. He crosses the room to set it on the mantel, letting his hand run along the back of John’s chair as he recrosses the room, returning again to his task.
