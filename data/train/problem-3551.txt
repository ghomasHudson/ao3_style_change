And on his last morning, Castiel pretends he doesn’t hear the alarm going off, keeps his arm tight around him and looks sad when he hands him his cup of coffee for the road. Later he texts him
Dean tries to nod and smile appropriately for the whole time and when they finally manage to escape him, Cas leads him to an empty corner where they can take refuge.
Castiel doesn’t understand the exchange, nor what he’s implied but he thinks that asking for clarification would show his ineptitude. He stays silent and lets his gaze travel on Dean’s body, his legs, his arms, his hands, the freckles on his cheekbones, the space between his nose and his upper lip.
Dean stops in his tracks and Cas stops with him to face him.
“Good! I’ll book it then,” he said throwing his hands in the air.
“Alright, listen,” he starts, gruffly, avoiding eye contact. He keeps his voice low, so as not to be heard from the other room. “I know it wasn’t really up to you, but I still - I guess I wanted to say thank you for bringing my boy back in one piece.”
So when the reaper comes again and asks “Are you ready, Dean?”, he says, “Yeah, we can go now.”
Sam looks up and makes an horrified face: “Wait. Dean, what are you wearing?”
“Alright, well, I thought I’d give you my number, just in case uh -”
“Something else decides to attack me?”
He covered his face.
It’s not that Dean wants to be a hermit or something, but he always feels like he needs to be wary of who’s gonna be at these sorts of things because some may treat them like Hollywood stars, but some may want to shoot them on sight. Anyone could come up to them and call them out for starting the end of the world, letting monsters out of Hell and Purgatory, cosmic beings out of their cages, getting their family killed, destroying their lives.
a little unsure, like she is asking about the shopping but also like she is worried that he is going to start talking about monsters. Cas says
But Dean insists, says, “Look, you don’t know me, but I know your boss -”
and Dean laughs and says
If he’s had a long night, sometimes Dean dozes off with his head on his hand and his gaze in Cas’ general direction. Bitter thoughts drift him away, like, how Cas probably shouldn’t be there, and how this was never a place for an angel.
A feeling of contentment took over and smoothed the lines on his forehead. Something inside him broke free, sprinted forward. It was okay. Sam was fine. Cas was there. Cas. He could feel all of their points of contact and he was afraid of them and he wanted more of them. He laid there and allowed himself to think about wrapping his arms around him and his stupid red towel until Sam came back and he was forced to sit up because Sam trying to fit next to his other knee was like a baby giraffe trying to squeeze himself into a birds’ nest.
“Good. Hope that means you’re gonna stay. Cause I’m kinda sick of you getting out my sight.”
When he got back to the bungalow Cas and Sam were sitting at the table playing cards.
Carol fusses over him and Sam in the hall, scolds them for taking so long to visit when they live in the same state, then Sam makes the introductions, and it’s only his shifting a little from side to side that betrays his nervousness.
and nothing else so as not to scare her.
Packing was never a problem for Dean, even when it was him and Sam and just one duffle bag. They didn’t need much. But with Cas, they couldn’t just share everything. Like, he had to have his own beach towel, Dean had thought, staring at those that were available at the bunker. He didn’t really see Cas showing up on Thursday with a trolley on tow. So he'd asked Sam and Sam had suggested they fixed him a bag and gave Dean one of his old backpacks. Dean had put in a red beach towel, and later Sam had dropped by with a couple of short sleeves shirts that he’d found in some old closet. Dean had contributed with the spare toothbrush he always carried in his own duffle bag, and a couple of t-shirts and sweatpants to use as pyjamas.
Dean shrugs and takes off his jacket to shove that in his arms as well. “It’s not gonna take long. I just want to take the worst out of it.”
They both take a step back from each other like something just dropped at their feet and Dean realizes they were standing far too close than he thought. Suddenly, unprotected by the counter, he feels a little weird and seems like Castiel is feeling awkward as well.
“New York,” he replies, a little reluctantly, and that picks up Dean’s interest even more.
Sometimes Dean relaxes a little too much and he’s woken up by the sound of the coffee mug Cas puts down next to the book he fell asleep on. His brain register a looming presence and his insticts tell him to jerk away, but before that can happen, there’s Cas’ hand on his shoulder, heavy and familiar.
, after seeing what Michael did to their world –
“Good to see you, boy,” he says in the same gruff voice.
Dean feels him slipping from him once again. He sighs, “You wanna go out, check the garden?”
Sam shrugs. “There are all sorts of things.”
Dean feels ten pounds lighter all of the sudden. He lets him go, widens his arms, “Alright, then. Should we make it right? I can come pick you up in a couple of hours and we’ll go grab a bite or something.”
“I am feeling well. I can do it.”
And Dean closes his eyes and focuses very hard on the weight of Castiel’s hand in his, on the familiar smell of his couch and on his voice the last time he picked up the phone and said “Hello, Dean.” He focuses on the silhouette of his shoulder against the light of the sunrise when Dean wakes up before him. He focuses on the sound of Sam’s laugh that time he’d seen him wearing an apron at Castiel’s and then they all went down to that weird spring event and Sam had won a salt and pepper set with little bees on them and how it’s now sitting in Castiel’s cabinet. He tries to pretend to be in his kitchen, with Castiel in the other room calling his name and telling him to turn down the radio. He thinks about those things and soon a wound is closed but another is open.
Dean pats him on a shoulder then.
“Yeah? This was the easy stuff. I’ll have you fold sheets and sofa covers, we’ll see what you think then.”
“What are you doing here?”
“I know you, Dean. But without Chuck, things have changed. You’re just like everyone else now.”
Dean doubted his child self could be capable of the piece of art Sam was describing, but it felt nice to know that that’s how his brother remembered it.
And then comes the summer and Castiel takes a few days off from work and drags him up to a hiking trail but it takes them all day because Dean keeps stopping at all the perfect trees to snog against – and that’s every tree. And in the end they are sweaty and sticky and Dean’s body hurts all over and would take a nest of vamps any day over something like this, but the way Castiel smiles in the summer sunset makes it worth it. He snaps a selfie and sends it to Sam and Eileen and his brother writes back
Castiel’s eyes widen, “Right,” he says, as if he’d forgotten again that he was supposed to leave.
Then Robert Singer walks in. He throws a look his way then turns on the lights and Castiel watches him as he opens and closes the cabinets and starts preparing dinner.
to go spend it with a bunch of strangers.
“My name is not Steve.”
Dean pales. He feels the ground giving in underneath him.
“Would you like to go for a walk?”
“It sounds good,” whispers Cas, his hand in his hair.
the windshield. Today there’s something different, he feels, in the familiar, comforting smell of the Impala, something fresh, new, something that whispers to him that he’s got the whole day ahead and all the time in the world after that.
donuts! But now shoo Romeo, or Juliet here is gonna be late, and I’m the one they’re gonna blame,” he says, disappearing in the backroom.
“Bye then.”
Castiel quickly turns around once again, and this time he pushes open the door and exits but Dean’s pretty sure he saw a smile on his lips.
But some other times when she talks about Dean she says
The jacket that he used on Sam is still hanging to dry so Dean has to make do with just an extra shirt. Thankfully the snow has let up and he is only planning on making a quick stop to the vending machine he saw outside earlier.
She stops in her tracks as soon as she sees Dean. “Morning,” she drawls in a melodic voice, eyeing him up and down. Dean is on his second donut. Sam can’t miss what he never knew he had, after all.
and Max and Stacy wave at them from the corner table and keep sneaking glances at them and whispering and Dean notices but doesn’t mention it, just fiddles with the menu longer than he usually does and keeps his elbows off the table where he’s sure he can’t touch Cas’.
At least they are spending time together. It’s rare for Cas to stay around after a hunt these days. He doesn’t need the down time they require, or so he says. He gets bored in the bunker, starts climbing the walls the second the door closes behind them. He gets restless, and then there’s Heaven and always bigger things to deal with, and Dean imagines that that beats staying behind to play foosball with him and Jack.
He closed his eyes and held tighter and tighter.
“I don’t.”
Cas’ lips twitch for a moment and then he smiles back.
Dean does his best not show how uneasy he feels.
and he goes back to Castiel who’s waiting for him.
But Castiel just looks thoughful and in the end he just says, “You told me there were things I wouldn’t believe nor wanna know about. You were telling the truth.”
“Adorable” she mouths at him. He rolls his eyes. “He just likes to joke”.
It was three in the morning when they finally had the call that the nest had been wiped out and everyone had made it out alive. Dean had guilt gnawing at his brain and doubts tearing up his intestines. They had been waiting for the news watching reruns of a comedy show that he didn’t find funny at all, Sam was too anxious to concentrate on and Cas seemed completely disinterested in.
Dean’s smile dims. Maybe he made a mistake, maybe he got it all wrong. Maybe it was all sleep deprived induced fantasy he entertained himself with? He tries to see it from Castiel’s perspective. He is a man who showed up in his motel in the middle of the night with a half dead brother offering no justifiable explanation, someone who then hanged around him till morning, flirted heavily with him and then followed him to his workplace. Okay, it sounds pretty bad put like that.
“I don’t?” Steve says, surprised by the question. His gaze is drawn to the freckles all over his face and Dean feels his skin heat up.
Sam felt his heart expanding. He smiled back and went back to bed.
Castiel answers the door with a smile.
But Castiel frowns and says “Dean?” and Dean doesn’t mean to be hopeful but he says it like he’s said it a million times before, like they’ve known each other for a lifetime and he only ever spoke this word to call him. Castiel squints and tilts his head to one side, “I don’t understand.”
Sam dragged himself in the kitchen to get a glass of water a couple of hours later and found Cas trying to turn the pages of his book with one hand while the other was tight in Dean’s grip, curled on the bed heavily asleep.
“That’s actually a great idea” said Sam, rubbing his eyes. He hit send on yet another text and pushed his phone away on the table. “I’m starving. I can’t believe you guys only got a pizza yesterday.”
That gets him out of his chair and out of the shade of the porch, under a sun that is not too warm, nor too cold. “Thanks Bobby,” he looks back.
“Yeah.”
“You know what, we shouldn’t ruin it for him now, should we? Troy, you say? Of course I remember him,” he says and throws in a wink. The guy beams at him and thanks him and gets a little chocked up because Troy might have been a liar but he swears he was one of the good ones.
” she signs, then answers her own question: “Date night.”
Sam exchanged a look with Cas, then sighed again and walked away.
Before he turns around to go his eyes stop somewhere behind Dean. “Cas?” he asks, and Dean remembers then that Cas is there too, just a few steps behind them.
This is all wrong. What did he do?
So he sees his funeral.
Then a wave covered their feet and one of Cas’ flip flops remained stuck on the wet sand, so he stumbled, lost his balance and let out a hand that Dean promptly took, and held, while he regained his ground.
Steve stays silent.
“What am I looking at?”
He opens the passenger door and lets Sam up, slinging one of his arms over his shoulders to carry him more easily.
“So you are in
And Dean mows Castiel’ lawn and they go out with Meg and he gets so drunk that Castiel has to drive them home and Dean keeps nuzzling his neck and jaw, making it difficult for him to walk to the door and later in bed he whispers in his ear things he never thought he’d say to anyone like “I missed you” and “I think about you all the time” and the morning after he doesn’t even freak out cause Castiel said it back and it’s all fine.
“I’m cold” he said with no hint of apology in his tone.
“She is still thinking about Kaia” he adds with a tinge of a sadness in his tone.
Cas seems reassured by that, but it only lasts the time it takes for him to make his way around the car, because even before he can grab the car handle, Claire speeds past them shouting, “See you, dorks.” Now he looks truly alarmed.
and, after a moment,
“Slipped into a lake. Just an accident” Dean gets closer to the counter, and clumps his hands together on the wood, trying to make it sound like it’s not a big deal. "He’s a little clumsy."
, to which Cas responds earnestly,
Crunch. It’s different” he says affronted, as seriously as if they were talking about matters of life and death.
Dean doesn’t care. He says, “You should dry your hair,” but Cas shrugs, “There’s no need.”
One time, on the bathroom tiles of a smelly motel, Dean is grinding his teeth, trying not to scream as Sam sews a gash on his leg.
Her eyes focus on Cas and her expression speaks of wonder and surprise.
Dean’s brain shut down completely. He tried clearing his throat, looking away, rocking on his feet. He thought about anything else he could say and said: “Want me to help you pull out the bed?”
“This is a lot of food.” He says as he selects and passes on.
And it’s winter again and the front garden is covered in snow. Dean lets himself in with his spare key knowing that Castiel is still at work and toes off his boots at the entrance. He places the wrapped boxes he brought under the little Christmas tree that Castiel has left up for him even if the holidays have already come and gone. He turns on the radio and starts their dinner. A few hours later, as he hears the keys turning into the lock and he’s filled with anticipation, he realizes, not as a surprise but more as a confirmation, that he doesn’t want to leave anymore.
Castiel is standing in Robert Singer’s kitchen.
Castiel says something back that Sam assumes sounds like
A long time passes before a distance sound startles them apart. Dean pulls back and says,
, unless it’s very early in the morning and she still has sleep fogging her eyes or late in the afternoon and she looks bored with her schoolbooks open on her lap.
and her face melts into a soft smile, she pats his hand and says
He always passes by the front windows of the post office and when the place is empty and she is not busy, Marta catches his eyes through the blinds and waves at him to come inside. He doesn’t mind spending a few minutes chatting with her. She is kind and nods understandingly and never makes him feel like he’s speaking in tongues. She always asks after Dean at some point, she says
And then he just keeps coming back.
Cas hesitates but Dean cuts him off before he can say anything.
Sam has the funniest reaction. His face goes blank and he starts staring into the distance as if he’s processing a word he is not used to hear. He snaps out of it right when Eileen is wondering if she should wave a hand in front of his face. “No,” he says, “it’s not like that.”
Dean really didn’t want to have that conversation at three in the morning. He closed his eyes for a few seconds and tried to keep his voice under control.
He makes his bed, carefully smooths out all the creases. He takes a long hot shower, humming a song he got stuck in his head, styles his hair, puts on some clean clothes.
He feels Cas’s gaze studying his profile and tries to relax his face as much as possible. Then he can’t resist and sneaks a look his way that Cas intercepts. They both open their mouths at the same time but nothing comes out.
“Yes?” he says then, in a wary tone. His voice is deep and husky, as if he just woke up, and if you were to ask Dean in another moment, it was like the bow on an already rather attractive package, but right now Dean is too irked by his attitude to pay him that kind of attention.
Dean says, “You up for a ride after we drop Sam off?” and all his worry melts away from his face. He says a soft, “Alright,” and disappears into the backseat.
“I still don’t understand the rules” he confessed to Dean while Sam was getting up, visibly frustrated. He announced that was going for a swim and that they were almost out of groceries.
She smiles back, nods and waits for him to fill her a mug.
“Well, from what I’ve seen, I think you did a bang up job with the place,” he says, “Might even see myself sticking around for a couple more days. If something interesting to do comes up,” he says and grins suggestively.
While they research, they’re quiet for the most part. Some days, the table between them is covered in books, in pizza boxes, in weapons, in blood. Some days, they argue and storm off and some days, Cas makes Dean laugh and Dean makes Cas do that face that Dean likes.
Dean insists Sam takes it easy and stays in for the rest of the morning – he complies, not without putting up a fight - while he drives back to the hiking trail. They fear the vetalas might have attacked again while they’ve been away, but there are no signs of them anywhere.
and Dean says
But it doesn’t matter now, because they’ve piled up in the Impala and driven to Carol’s.
There are so many different people that Cas doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb, and Dean finds himself thinking that if they were just two regular hunters in a crowd and nothing more, perhaps some things would be easier.
So he looks down at the items he is holding and he hands him the bucket that Cas promptly steps forward to take and without another word goes to fill in the sink in the corner. Dean walks around the car trying to decide where it would be best to start.
Dean keeps his eyes closed.
“Dean and I can lend it to you.”
“Damn it! I don’t have time for this.” he says making eye contact to try and get through to him. What is he, some kind of robot? Does he even blink? “You don’t understand. My brother is sick -”
“Somehow I doubt that.” Steve says but he has his lips stretched in a half smile and Dean is gonna take it as a win. “But it’s nice to finally know your name, Dean.”
Dean shrugs, embarrassed to be called out. “So what? You spent all your time with Eileen,” he says and he regrets it immediately, especially as Sam purses his lips like he’s holding back a laugh.
“That was nice of you.”
about me. And I said, I get it,” he shrugs.
“You feel something inside when you listen to it. Or you never get tired of listening to it. Or it seems like it tells your story or something.”
Dean meets his eyes and gives him a smile to see if he can prompt one in return without saying anything.
“Thank you,” she signs, blushing a little, “I’ll try to come by.”
Dean scoffed. “You choose.”
Cas yawned his way through lunch and Sam insisted for him to take one of the beds in the bedroom while he sorted out their bags for the journey. Cas tried to put up a fight like a child that while rubbing his eyes said that he wanted to keep watching tv but it didn’t last long. Dean on the other hand had no intention of helping, he sat on the porch while his brother busied himself around.
As the glass door swings open and he lets a swirl of cold air inside, Steve looks up. He is sitting on a high stool behind the counter now, and has his book on his lap.
“Hey, Baby,” he says, touching her hood affectionately. He leans against her, closes his eyes and concentrates. “Don’t worry. We’re gonna take off in a minute. Just wanted to know if someone wants to come along for a ride?”
He nods and says, “Hey, when you’re done, come over at my place. I’d like you to meet my Karen,” and Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen such happiness in his eyes.
Cas nods and heads out and Dean can’t do anything but follow, past the hunters and the patio. They walk the perimeter of the small square of grass, wet and glistening with old rain. The sun and the clouds draw patches of light on the ground and they move from dark to light to dark again in an irregular rhythm, chasing the warmth of the sunlight and the relief of the shade. Dean feels uncomfortable in both, but there’s no middle line he can walk on.
“Well, as I said, I’m not here to endanger anybody,” he says, rolling his eyes. "Alright, look, I can answer some more question if it’ll make you feel better.”
A few hours later the sounds of Cas and Sam in the other room woke him up again. It was still raining.
“But, Jack…”
“No, thank you. I'll do it later.”
“How are you doing anyway? With the human stuff.”
Dean dumps the groceries on the kitchen table with a sigh right when Castiel pokes his head in.
He turns to face Dean “What else?” he asks matter-of-factly.
Dean heart slows down, he sits up and drinks his coffee.
“Dean, are you okay? Have you, like, slept enough?”
There’s Max and Alicia, sprawled on a couch, nursing the worst hangover Dean’s seen in a long time. They say they’re happy to see him, but then they eye Cas up and down and Max says something along the lines of, “Oh, I see now why you keep him hidden from us,” and that prompts Dean to quickly move along.
Dean sighs and then plasters a big grin on his face. “My name is Dean Winchester, I’m from Lawrence, Kansas and I’m a Sagittarious. That’s it, really, it’s all there is to know.”
Cas finally returned the smile. “You are right. We could do that.”
He says,
They had an unplanned encounter with two vetalas they were hunting a couple of towns back. In the last few weeks the vetalas had lurked on a hiking trail, casually bumping into tourists to steal something valuable from them, only to attack them once they returned on their steps to search for it. Being the middle of winter, they’d been feasting undisturbed, favoured by the small numbers of people that braved the paths and by the sun setting early.
in his stomach. Every second is too long and not long enough to decide. Sam doesn’t ask what they’re still doing there, even if Dean killed the engine and it’s starting to get cold in the car.
“Have you asked her if she wants to come here? Be part of the Lebanon squad?”
Sam mouths back. “It means nothing”.
One time when he’s walking to pick up Castiel from work to go out to dinner together, his phone
Dean is on his second slice by the time Sam walks in and complains that Dean didn’t wait for him. Sometimes he comes in with a news or wants to talk about his latest research. And Dean rolls his eyes and points at the pizza, and with his mouth full says,
He’ll take this quiet moment instead.
“As I was saying” he starts again, as he dubiously picks up another kitchen rag from the unfolded pile, this one with white daisies embroidered on the hem, “now that Sam is mostly the one who passes hunts onto her, I’m glad that we can direct her towards things that are not as dangerous as they could be. I know that when you were her age you were thrown in all sorts of situations, but you had your father, and then you had Sam. She is alone and -”
Steve doesn’t break eye contact as he says “I did,” like he’s asking him not to make him regret his decision. If Dean had a collar now it would be a good time to tug at it. Man, the guy can be a scary son of a bitch with those eyes and all.
He showed Cas the pictures he had taken and then he told a story of the last time they had spent time on a beach. Neither of them remembered where they were and why they were so near the coast but John had left them at the motel for the afternoon and they had sneaked out to see the sea up close. It was too cold to go into the water so they had stayed on the sand even if it was almost freezing and Dean had built for Sam a giant sand castle.
and Cas says
Cas’ face immediately softens at her name. “Surprisingly well. As you know she -”
, he can tell, and he never had anyone like Dean with whom he could talk about booze for hours.
Then Dean, still with his head thrown back, catches them watching.
Castiel looks upwards in a matter than suggests annoyance, but he is pressing his lips together as if he’s keeping a smile at bay.
At least it’s a nice day, at least it stopped raining and the sun is breaking in from the clouds; the chilly air that comes in from the window that Cas is in the habit of keeping rolled all the way down brings in the pleasant smell of wet leaves.
nothing. I wish I was -” he sighs. “I wish I could do more. I never seem to be able to help you when it matters.”
"Back to the Future is on. Bring the plates" said Sam.
His brother looks up at him, his hands bloody, his forehead covered in sweat. They don’t have any booze left, and Sam was never the best of them in that kind of things.
When the door opened again, Cas was wearing the light green swim suit that had belonged to Sam and one of the weird old shirt he'd dug up from the bunker, this one light blue with white flower-like shapes that formed a pattern. Cas had kept it open like some mobster from a movie.
Dean frowns, “What about it?” he asks, and it comes out sharp and defensive.
Cas makes a face but doesn’t say anything else. Apparently Jack is not the only one who he seems unable to refuse something to and that makes Dean feel good. He trails after him around the room as Dean stops to say hello from familiar face to familiar face.
“What should I do?” he asks.
She smiles reassuringly and tells him, “He will be.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but then he can’t restrain a smile, especially with Sam’s eyes that nags him to talk.
“Wh-when did this happen?”
Dean snatches the instant noodles from his hands. “Away from Sam,” he says holding the little plastic cups against his chest like they are puppies. “He won’t ever make me hear the end of it.”
Dean really didn’t have the energy to fire anything back, he just said that he was going to bed and as soon as he laid down, he fell asleep.
But Steve doesn’t seem in the mood to indulge his curiosity. He ignores his question and stands up to stop right in front of him. Despite the counter between them the guy is suddenly at a distance that Dean would deem a little too close for comfort for a stranger, and from where he finds himself now, he is forced to look up at him a little. But there’s a challenge in the way he confidently entered his personal space and Dean is not going to be the one who backs down.
“It’s our job,” chimes in Dean slipping the blade in his jacket. “We kill ‘em.”
“I’m staying with Dean.”
“Dean,” he says in a breath.
Dean was feeling awesome, lying on his towel and enjoying all the sensations and the smells of that day, knowing that again soon it would only be sulphur and old books and death. Sam was a few feet away wearing a long sleeved henley that Dean had no idea why he'd brought in the first place (“I thought I’d get cold in the mornings.”) and going around snapping pictures of the horizon and Dean had no idea how could he even see what he was taking pictures of with his hair covering his face the whole time.
He shakes his head. “You are wrong.”
Steve frowns. “I don’t want anything.”
So, for the last time he leaves and for the last time he comes back.
Eileen meets his gaze briefly and holds back a smile.
“And why would you - ” Sam cuts himself off and silence falls upon them. Sam clicks his tongue. “Unbelievable.”
“Yeah, man, you know I’m a slow reader.”
Steve searches his face with an inquisitive look for a long moment in which Dean can feel his heartbeat speed up. Then Dean sees him reach under the counter and he holds his breath. He may have a shotgun or one of those buttons that calls security or something. Instead what he holds up and slides over the counter is a room key.
“Hell if I know,” is Dean’s reply but his tone is evasive and thoughtful and Castiel feels Dean’s thoughts tugging at his grace for the rest of the night.
Dean is not too bothered. Outside the weather is bad, but the place it’s nearby, the job seems easy and they can be home in time for dinner. And if they hit the traffic, well, Cas will be there. They will be fine.
“I could recommend another establishment three miles ahead. They are less selective with their guests. I’m sure they’ll be happy to welcome you.”
“Yeah” Dean takes a breath. Better cut this short. “So, can you point me to the local history section?”
Dean is taken off guard but he’s determined to not give him the satisfaction of seeing him bothered, so he doesn’t move, says nothing and keeps challenging his gaze. Steve has an unreadable expression on his face, but judging from the lack of sirens swarming the place he hasn’t called the police. At least, not yet. He is staring at him as if he’s trying to see inside of him and from that distance, the intensity of his blue eyes make Dean’s skin tingle.
Dean goes over to him and stops right behind his back to look over his shoulder. Maybe he takes a step or two more than it is necessary because when Cas turns his face on the side to catch his eyes he find himself a little too close “Perhaps is best if we hide this from Sam as well,” he suggests conspiratorially and his breath brushes over Dean’s cheek.
” he says wiggling his eyebrows in a way that has his brother close his eyes in embarrassment, “you’re always welcome.”
Cas steps foward then, covering the distance in a few strides and stopping right next to him by the sink. Dean hands him one of the towel, their fingers brushing, their eyes meeting. Dean’s smile is a little strained after his little speech but it’s there, cause
Steve squints at him, confused. “How do you mean?”
That is why Dean had been pleased when Cas had expressed his intention of staying with them for a couple more days. In that moment Dean had been busy keeping his lunch in his stomach - he’d just found the shredded skin of a shapeshifter in a
Dean exhales in relief, looks at the key, then up at him. In a second he’s grabbed it and he ran out again. The cold bites his bare arms but he’s almost at the Impala and he doesn’t care.
“Yeah I don’t miss those douchebags.” Dean frowned and added: “So… the more time you’d spend away from Earth the more you would, like, forget how to feel?”
Cas turned back to the movie and Dean spent the following few minutes staring at Cas’ hand on the mattress without really thinking anything. He was feeling a weird sense of premature nostalgia for that very moment. Then, even if it looked like Cas hadn’t moved an inch, Dean blinked once and when he looked again his hand had the palm facing upward.
“How did this happen?” grumbled Sam, sipping from his cup looking out of the glass door like a puppy that wanted to be let out. The rain was so violent and the wind so strong that Dean felt uneasy watching him standing there with only a door to separate him from that.
The sight makes him smile and as he keeps towelling the hood, he walks around the car to get closer to Cas. When he’s within reach he holds out a hand to grab his tie and tug a little at it, forcing him to stop and turn towards him.
“I understand what you mean,” says Cas with a sigh and Dean extends his arm to offer him his beer, and even though Cas usually refuses, this time he takes it.
Castiel meets his eyes again and something stirs in him.
Cas’ eyes sparkle like shimmering water when he says, “Okay.”
She groans as if she’s heard that same speech about a thousand times, but Cas cuts off whatever she was going to retort with and says, “We weren’t planning on coming either. Sam and Jack are here too.”
Sam shifts his gaze towards the blotches of blood on the windshield and the doors, on the windows and the headlights. They had been surprised by the pack during their stake out when they thought they were well hidden in the woods. That was also the reason why they opted out for an extra night in town. The police would have knocked at their door in the morning for sure if they’d parked that bloodied thing out in the open.
“But it could,” insisted Sam taking the bottle offered and taking a sip. “There’s no harm in looking anyway.”
Dean’s heart started thumping loud in his chest and he thought that maybe he had done something wrong and he had to take it back before he could hurt Cas. But his body wouldn’t move and his heart knew that it was too late to take anything back.
Dean shrugged and averted his eyes: “Right.”
Silence falls then and fills up the space all around them. There’s only the tired whirring of the computer informing them that it’s still alive and kicking and the hands on the wall clock that ticks away the night.
“I think I prefer nature. Animals and leaves and thunders. Those give me all the things you said.”
“You could ask me.”
. Only, some case turns up later than night and they are gone all week and miss it.
It’s a rainy afternoon and they are keeping busy cleaning their weapons and filling shotgun shells of rock salt. At some point Sam looks up from where he is sitting right next to Eileen.
He asks with his eyes wide and stunned expression if he is Dean Winchester,
Sam draws out the gun from his inside pocket and moves quickly on the sidewalk towards the noise. Dean takes out the silver blades he got hidden in his right boot.
He usually wants to say,
He sits down next to her and closes his eyes, lost in the smell of the coffee.
As he does so he looks up at Cas, who is standing like a pillar of salt now, and if Dean didn’t know that he didn’t need to breathe he would have been worried.
and Cas looks around and reads out loud the first sign he sees. He says,
Castiel nods. “I’m fine, I guess I’ll need some time, but I’m fine.”
“I need you to help me stay on the couch all day, how does that sound?”
Fortunately, Cas suggested they played cards so Sam stepped back. It was no fun really, playing with them. Sam took things way too seriously and it took Cas a billion of centuries when his turn came. Dean distracted himself watching tv and tuned out all the conversations about game rules. Yes, there was more than one.
Three hours later, Dean can’t sleep. He is sitting at a little table against one of the walls and he is watching over Sam, finally asleep on his stomach, clutching his pillow. He promised him he wouldn’t do that, but he can’t help it.
She sends a rolling-my-eyes emoji. Dean snorts and Cas looks up.
The vetala growls one last time as Dean twists the blade inside him and pushes himself up to watch the body whiter and crumble under his eyes.
“Okay.”
Instead, he steps back and looks away. Dean’s hand has to let go of the hem, and he feels a pang of disappointment that surprises him. He hadn’t even realized that he was expecting something.
“I didn’t know you could swim like that” said Sam. “Can you teach me?”
His own hands grip the back of the trenchcoat, and when he moves his head a little so that his lips brush against Cas’ neck he says “Dean” in a breath. It makes him smile.
“How did you - ” he looks between them. “How did you know they were here?”
“It’s better to visit during the summer. They even have concerts up on the mountains. They come from all over the world to see them.” he says and his voice gets a dreamy tone. “You get to meet all kinds of people.”
Dean shook his head and mumbled a reply. He laid down on the side with his arm bent under his head.
Dean sighs and gets his legs moving, picks up the bucket and goes over to the sink to empty it and wash out the dirt. He says “Cas, come on, it’s nothing.”
“Why don’t you just – come in now?” he asks hesitantly.
“No. I- I moved here recently.”
. But if he asked Cas, he would be asking for himself, wouldn’t he?
“Alright,” he says, sounding profoundly sad and again the same shadow passes on his face.
Dean rolls his eyes in the exact same way, “Right. Well, you know it wouldn’t kill you to stay with us for a while. We could get you a bit of training.”
Bobby clinks his bottle against his in agreement.
The sun has already set and the temperatures have dropped significantly again. Dean is not in a great mood. He can’t wait to finish this job and get out of there and forget all about this town and this cold and those stupid vetalas.
“I thought I’d never see him again,” he adds and lets out a shaking breath.
“If it makes you feel any better, we’re not bad guys.” Dean adds, going for charming, trying to melt the ice a little.
and it’s a text from Sam saying
Steve lifts a shoulder. He seems to have relaxed as well.
But of course the guy – Steve – does the opposite of giving it a once over, like anybody else would. In fact, the asshole holds the ID next to the credit card and, upon inspection, clicks his tongue.
in a friendly font and has a pair of little wings and a halo to blink with it.
But he’s got a text from Carol while he was about to get in the car after wrapping up a case, and Sam asked who it was, so it had become a Thing to discuss.
But Cas doesn’t have time to answer before they get interrupted and soon surrounded by hunters Dean’s seen on the road, worked with, heard about. Some share their epic tales of escapes from impossible dangers, some are curious and some are brave and blunt and they ask Cas questions and address him without fear and Cas is polite and just a tiny bit awkward.
to match the theme of the place.
Dean huffs a laugh and lets go of the tie but his hand refuses to retreat and it goes and pokes at the wet spots on Cas’ white shirt, right above his right pec, and all down to his side.
“They had – fangs,” he says more to himself than to him, as if he’s still processing what he saw.
Castiel sighs and goes back to his magazine without another word.
They would have still managed to overpower them if only one of them hadn’t pushed Sam into a lake and fled and Dean had been too worried getting him out of the freezing water, to worry about the other one fleeing as well.
Dean does his best not to follow his hand bringing the bottle to his lips. And he does his best, later, not to wonder if the wetness touching his lips when he drinks is just beer or something else.
Dean gives him another of his patented dumb grins. “See? An angel in the flash right there,” he jokes and he even makes a show of ringing the little bell . “This must be the real deal. I mean, I rang for an angel and you showed up, didn’t you?”
"Sam is teaching me to lounge" replied Cas to his confused look. Sam looked amused.
So, yeah, if Dean was completely honest with himself – something that he generally tried to avoid – it’s not like he wanted to waste a whole day of
Castiel throws a “Yes,” over his shoulder as he disappears once again into the backroom.
"Jack is riding with Claire,” he says as soon as he’s within earshot. He sounds like he doesn’t think it’s a good idea and it’s a little funny.
He looks unsure, troubled, as if he is not quite certain this is a good idea. Dean breathes out a confused, “What?” that he himself can barely hear.
“Yeah. I’m hungry.”
Castiel shrugs, “I’ll manage,” he says, but he hasn’t time to add anything else cause someone pushes open the glass door behind Dean and with a way too cheerful voice for that hour of the day exclaims: “I’ve got the kielbasa you ordered!”
Dean stays silent, looks down at his hands, smirking slightly.
Dean feels like his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He’s not ready for this.
before shouting for Sam to join them. Jack doesn’t need to be called, he comes stumbling immediately after Cas, drawn by the smell of food that fills the hallways.
“Yeah,” laughs Dean, pulling him along, walking backward towards the car. “You sure I’m not keeping you? I heard you’re big shot now.”
Sometimes, when he is at the bunker and things are quiet, Castiel goes out and ventures in town.
He makes a sympathetic face. “You are going straight to work after this? No hours of sleep?”
With the corner of his eye he can see Cas dubiously looking out at the pouring rain and back at him.
On an off day like today, he usually puts on his robe and makes his way down the chilly hallways with only the sound of his steps and the faint buzzing of the generator for company.
“The town seems nice. The reviews are good. So?”
Cas stopped with the trash bag dangling from his fingers and looked at him, suddenly unsure. “I assumed it would be fine for me to leave it with you and Sam.”
Dean was drying the last glass when his eyes fell on the brown paper bag that was still on the kitchen counter where Sam had left it. “Have you thought about where are you gonna hang that?” he asked, going for casual, nodding at the bag and hoping that Cas remembered and he wouldn’t have to further explain the question.
“Got family here?”
Dean and Sam waited the early hours of the morning to cross the police tapes and track them, but the trail was long, it was dark and cold and the vetalas had the advantage of being familiar with the grounds.
He nods, “I see your point,” he says diplomatically, stressing the
Dean leans over on the counter and lowers his voice. “Hey, you know what they say about freckles?”
Dean throat is tight. He only nods.
In response she signs: “Love.”
He writes,
He breathes heavily and looks back at Sam, who’s doing the same, catching his breath with a crumbled body at his feet. He meets his eyes and they nod briefly at each other, to let the other know that they’re alright.
Castiel is turned mostly away from the door and he is busy with a visitor so he doesn’t spot him right away. Dean hovers around the entrance, takes a peek at the newspaper rack by the door, until he sees the visitor passing him by towards the exit.
But then the group of hunters out in the patio erupts in laughter and Cas’ gaze shifts on them and then lingers on the glass door.
“Yeah,” conceded Dean “Very nice.”
He had stripped him of his heavy jacket and shirt, draped his own jacket and flannel over him, trying to dry him as best as he could, and cranked the heating at its max, but Baby could only do so much. Outside the windows, it looked like it was about to snow.
“The weather here is nicer,” he says, and Dean snorts softly next to him.
, with his eyes on them
But the whole thing at the library still burns and it’s made pretty clear what was what.
“Yeah, I’m rewarded enough on the ground where I am, thank you.”
there then. Dean doesn’t stop hitting the damn bell.
“Excuse me?”
He rounds the counter and opens the box, angling it toward Castiel so that he can grab a napkin and a donut. Dean almost shouts “Ha!” as he discovers his predictions were correct. Those donuts look as delicious as they smell, and he can’t take his eyes off of them. He catches Castiel giving Gabriel an insistent look that prompts him to say, with a sight: “And does the gentlemen here have breakfast included, by any chance?”
Sam tries to take a step but his legs give out under him. “I can’t do it.” he says. “It’s too cold.”
She doesn’t expect to find Castiel standing next to the coffee machine. He is in his usual attire, looking exactly as the last time she’s seen him. He looks up as soon as she enters and smiles politely at her. “Good morning” he says, “Would you like some coffee?”.
The guy says loudly and obnoxiously, “Good morning everyone!”
It’s the middle of the night.
“And I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Steve and he needs the shift tonight, so – I wasn’t gonna make it either.”
“I understand very well that I won the bet” she says challenging him.
Castiel focuses back on the very same scene and tries to see what he sees, feel what he feels. Or anything. But there’s nothing growing in him, only scorched earth with just poor imitations of weak seedlings.
Dean’s heart starts pounding. He tries to swallow but his mouth is too dry.
Dean has to admit that it’s an endearing sight. He looks at his sturdy frame, his messy hair, what he can see of his features from this angle, as he keeps his head low and his actions meticulous. It’s just –
He makes an annoyed face back. “Yes. It’s not like that,” he repeats.
to his ears and he can read hurt all over Cas’ face. He needs to explain himself. He takes a breath, says a lame, “I mean, if you don’t -”
“Not for me.”
Castiel kisses him again then smiles. “Dean, this is your home since the first time you came through that door. Of course it’s all right with me.”
Then one night Sam called him into the war room to show him a booking website and way too good to be true photos of bungalows on a beach.
Sam’s nod is weak and his pale face is not at all reassuring, but Dean knows it will do no good to stay in the car. He needs to get him inside.
“Yeah, Sammy, come on, I need you to walk now, can you do that? We’re almost there.”
Dean likes doing laundry. Not exactly the time he spends collecting dirty clothes from dirty hunters that understandably - after years of living in an apocalypse and in a constant fight and flight mode - didn’t prioritize washing their clothes regularly; and not really the part when he has to grab handfuls of wet, blood smeared, smelly towels to dump them in the washing machine, but he likes
“Watch the sand” warned off Dean. His brother rolled his eyes at him but rid himself of it as much as he could, before going through the doorway. Cas stood by Dean’s side, with his red towel on his shoulder that the wind made fly about like a cape. Dean watched him with the corner of his eye, his silent, unmoving figure, with his eyes on the sea and the goose skin on his arms. Cas let out a content sigh.
“Dude, lose the outfit.” said Dean.
Dean doesn’t want to think about that, so he stays away. He puts himself in charge of all the things that need to run smoothly in the background to make sure the hunters don’t need anything. He fixes pipes in some bathrooms, air vents in some bedrooms, opens up some more rooms to accommodate researchers and nappers alike.
They hold each other for a long time and Dean thinks of what Bobby said and wonders how many years are going by and how many more could go by before he gets sick of that.
“Hey,” protests Dean, but she just laughs and disappears down the hallway.
Dean huffs a nervous laugh and looks at him. “Yeah. No. I mean, I don’t know, maybe you wanted to talk. Later.”
“I don’t need anything,” he says.
“Castiel and your brother,” she signs, hoping that that’s enough input for Sam.  Clearly it isn’t, because he keeps looking as if he’s expecting her to go on. “Are they… together?”
“What just happened?” Sam is asking.
Sam stopped his blabbering and looked at Dean like he was the one to blame if Cas thought they did not include him in things.
He couldn’t ask that. He couldn’t risk hearing something that would keep him awake at night and make him grind his teeth in his sleep. He didn’t say anything and they kept going for a while. Cas pointed out to every bird he saw gliding in the distance, but they stayed quiet until Cas said: “I don’t regret it.”
So it’s just the two of them again and Dean is tapping on the screen of his phone every two seconds as if he doesn’t trust that it will let him know if he has a new notification.
So they decide over lunch that Sam is gonna drop him off at the library so that Dean can check the archives to see if there’s been attacks on different hiking trails in the area, see if they’ve got another habitual spot they might have switched to. Dean is paying for their lunch when on a whim also pays for a coffee to go.
By the time he got back with dinner Sam and Cas were sprawled on the sofa. The tv was on.
He got up when he had enough of tossing and turning. He found Cas on the pull out bed sitting with his back to the cushions and his legs stretched in front of him, watching tv.
“Well if you ever change your mind - ” he says smirking, looking at him up and down. Sam scoffs behind him.
And Dean’s main argument was “Why would we go?”, but Sam’s was “Why not?”, which was objectively stronger. And it got worse because from the backseat Jack kept interjecting with, “Go where?” and, “Who are these people?” until Sam paid attention to him and explained that hunters meet up sometimes to “get a drink, exchange stories”, and that had made him light up like a Christmas tree because Jack
Castiel meets Dean’s eyes in the rear view mirror and looks torn, like he’s about to say something. Then he seems to think better of it and just nods briefly. “Well, then, stay safe. And again: thank you. Both of you.” And with that, he gets out and walks away.
Meg mutters something after him but he’s already out of the door and he can’t hear her.
“Have you? When?”
is what she wrote back.
Dean takes a deep breath. “So, what are we gonna do?”
Sam is waiting for him at the bottom of the stone steps. He is still wearing his FBI suit and his heavy coat and scarf but he’s got his hands buried in his pocket and his shoulder drawn together as if he’s still cold. As Dean approaches him he coughs a few time and Dean’s irritation for that case flares up again.
Dean wonders how pathetic would be if he walked out of there saying “Let’s just pretend I never came in here.” Maybe it’s too late for that, but he needs to let him know that he’ll stay away, cause he caught the drift.
“Why, do you think I got plans you don’t know about?”
“Uh? Your vest says it is.”
He grumbles: “They watch movies together all the time, they are friends!”
Sam laughs again and slips in front of the steering wheel with an amused sigh. “Whatever. Don’t know what he did to you but as long as you’re sure he’s not a witch.”
So Dean passed out three plates and took the beers and the bag with the food. He made sure they both carved out a space for him on the couch to let him sit in the middle.
Most of all, he feels lighter than he’s felt in ages.
Sam made him and Cas clean their feet and calves from the sand before going in. He had set the table properly and even washed the pots already. It made Dean wonder how long they were gone.
“Jesus. Look, I don’t need this right now. I got a medical emergency. The card works, just give me the room.”
“Uh, was thinking, maybe more than that. I mean, if it’s all right with you, I -”
Going on hunts with Cas is always fun, but it’s also a run against time and there’s death and guns and fear involved, even when it’s an easy-peasy salt-and-burn. And it’s the four of them crammed in a motel room, so they don’t get much time to be alone. And Dean likes when they are all together, but likes it more when Sam and Jack disappear in the maze of the bunker and he gets to have his best friend all for himself.
Eileen looks his way in time to see him put his arm around Castiel’s shoulders and pull him close. His lips read: “What? It was adorable. Wanna win it for me later?”
But she shakes her head and gestures dismissively. “Nonsense. No one will start trouble if they don’t wanna see the end of my rifle. A friend of yours is a friend of mine,” she reassures him. “Plus, Eileen vouched for him.”
Dean pulls back. “See you later, Steve,” he says, but all he receives is a confused look back.
So he braves the cold in only his t-shirt for the short jog it takes to get to the lobby. It’s a little inviting square of bright light. Mostly glass doors, which is an unusual choice for a motel, and especially not in a place of the country where it gets this cold. But the glass turns out to be thicker than it looks and the room, surprisingly warm. Dean finds himself exhaling relieved, as the door closes behind him.
“Oh,” Castiel hesitates, “so this is goodbye?”
Now, Sam is in a sticky diner with his brother who is across from him and can’t seem to sit still. A couple of days before they got two calls in a matter of hours and they’ve gone north while Eileen has gone south. Coincidentally Cas has been contacted about a lead on God’s position so he’s gone too.
. This is
“You know that me being here means I’m dead, right?” he jokes, but accepts the beer Bobby hands him and sits next to him.
“Just passing through,” she replies, putting on airs, “Finished up a job a few miles north. I thought I’d drop by Carol’s before moving on.”
“It just doesn’t sound like us.”
The wallet is closed and the credit card and ID have been put back inside, meaning that with every probability Steve has seen all the other stolen credit cards.
“Hey, coffee is free, right?”
“I could show you around. I thought I was offered a ride?”
“Good morning to me” she reads on his lips, with his eyes still closed, as if he’s talking to himself.
“Seriously? You’re a faster reader than I am.” Sam is one bitch face away from losing his temper. He exhales, then says: “Dean, what’s going on?”
Castiel on the other hand has not really familiarized with the space yet. He knows only where the basic stuff is: the coffee, the cups, the glasses, the beers. He knows where they keep their cutlery. So when there’s nothing more to take out of the bags and he tries to be helpful, he ends up opening cupboard after cupboard and then looking at Dean to ask “Where do these go?”
The library is a small edifice of just a couple of rooms one after the other and Dean sees Castiel right away, behind the circular desk at the entrance. He is wearing a thick blue sweater, with a zipper down the front and snowflakes across his chest. It looks soft and warm and Dean wonders would it would feel like to press his face against it and how it would smell like, most likely of candy, fresh snow and herbal tea. Then he tells himself to get a grip because he is feeling way too happy to see someone he met less than a day ago.
On their last day, the wind didn’t relent but the white clouds running in the sky were a nice sight and at least the sun was warm.
“…I think she’s grown a lot. She misses Jody and Alex, I can tell, but I think she found her balance. I may be worried about her but I’m happy that -”
Every other day, Sam walks in and wants to talk about a weird dream he had and what it could mean. Rowena tells him he’s got a gift he needs to learn to control, but Dean is not sure there’s much to interpret about a cart full of expired food. Sometimes Sam talks about a case he heard about or an article he read.
“It’s not bother. I’m not reading tonight anyway. I’m watching a movie with Dean.”
Eileen likes the bunker. As a hunter you learn to be grateful and appreciative of things that others give for granted. Like waking up feeling safe, knowing that nothing can jump right through your window and attack you. Like pressing your cheek on a soft pillow without having to worry about bed bugs and filth. Like opening your bedroom door and smelling coffee.
stories and the idea of expanding his pool of knowledge on hunting and creatures appealed to him greatly.
“Cassie, what are you doing still here? I told you, you could leave early. You’re gonna be late for work.”
“It would be a little difficult to explain.”
Then she sits at the table and watches as Dean appears on the door, his eyes sleepy, his hair messy, the belt of his robe loosely tied. He waves lazily in her direction then goes straight towards Castiel, holding out a hand to grab the mug that he was already offering him. No words between them, just soft smiles, as if it’s a thing they do every day. She has not been around the Winchesters that much but she is fairly sure she’s never seen a more content expression on Dean’s face.
Dean doesn’t like the bright light, it makes the place look like the reception of a corporate office but he likes the way it smells, sweet, sugary, almost like – candy? It’s nice and Dean doesn’t want to go back to his room just yet.
Jack wins her over immediately with his wide smile and polite hand shake, “I look forward to exchanging stories,” he says and she huffs a laugh and says:
Cas smiled a little smile, said “Later then” and went after Sam. Dean watched them dive into the water, point at the clouds and splash about for a while. Sam had tied his hair in a loser ass man bun but it was all wet already. He laughed at something Cas said and fell back into the water.
“Doesn’t really change my life. And it’s a good story,” he huffs a laugh, it comes out bitter, “Better than some of the true ones anyway.”
He gets back around noon to pick Sam up and go get something to eat. As they drive around Dean gets a chance to take a look at the town, the little shops, the tidy sidewalks, the nice little houses with their nice little gardens. “Hey, this place’s not so bad, uh?” he says.
Cas had opened his mouth but nothing had come out, so Dean had laughed and slapped his back. “Just kidding. We got you, buddy.”
But Dean is not ready yet. Sometimes, when he’s alone with Cas like this, he feels something grip his insides and tug at him to say something.
For now, they are just walking around in the crowd, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. They have a duffel bag full of salt, shotguns and blades but from the outside they just look like four people that have come out to enjoy the fair on a fine evening.
The kitchen rags are all gone and there’s a moment of silence. Castiel rests his hands on the edge of the basket and looks up as Dean folds the last of the bathroom towels.
“Well, you should look it up and let me know what you think then.”
“It’s quieter.”
Dean finally turns towards him, flashes him a smile. “You know what I think? I think we should look at some books,” he says, like he’s had a revelation.
Dean felt a pang in his side.
He walks quickly towards him, slipping a little on the snow covered grass.
It’s nice there - someone’s turned the music on in the other room, but here it’s muffled by the walls, and the light is just right to make Cas’ eyes look like sapphires. They don’t need to move.
He said yes, that he was going to watch some more tv, read Sam’s book and wait for him to wake up.
It’s dark outside and the lights are off. He doesn’t mind. He’s been standing there for quite some time now and has barely noticed the change.
“Do you carry a gun?”
They move in synch and stealthily reach the alley. Just a look is enough to recognize the vetalas even with their back turned, the blonde woman that had thrown Sam into the lake and the young guy that had attacked Dean. They’ve got someone pinned against the wall and the man is whimpering and imploring them to let him go.
But when Cas’s expression blends into confusion and he blinks, “Dean?”, he shakes his head.
Dean looked at him frowning – had it been that easy? –  but Cas gave him a hint of a smile and his frown melted away. It had been. “You coming with us or zapping away?”
He drinks his coffee and watches him as he walks towards his car. Then he loses him from his sight as someone in the room calls his attention back.
Cas looks at him expectantly for a moment, then frowns slightly and drops his gaze and it takes Dean a beat or two to follow it and realize that Cas is holding out the box for him to take. He was too focused on his face to notice it and when Cas says “Dean?” his eyes go to his lips and it makes things even worse.
Sam sighs and signs. “There is no bet. And it’s not like that.”
A titan of the sky, confined in a human body, squeezed on a chair in an underground box. How his skin must prickle, and his wings long to be stretched. How long it will be before he won’t take it anymore.
“Yeah, you know, get to know more about the local history, see if we can spot a pattern. Maybe these vetalas have been around for years. We should check for robberies gone bad too. I’m just saying,” he raises his eyebrows. “books always served us good.”
“But I guess the reward is the feeling you get when you reach the top or something.”
Dean said goodnight.
Dean felt panic mounting inside him, he wasn’t ready for any part of that conversation but he had to say something. “Are you…? You don’t need to…” he sighed “… look for another place. It goes without saying, Cas. You can stay at the bunker.”
“Hey Cas,” he says “remember that book that you were reading last week about sigils? I wondered if I could borrow that. I wanted to scan it and send it around to other hunters.”
During the night it started raining.
each time and Dean squeezes his hand. He says,
“Cas! You got your own towel.”
So the fact that Dean had tried to point out that, “This is stupid. We are hunters, not a book club,” had sorted no effect whatsoever. No, instead, Jack had said, “That sounds nice. We should go,” and when Dean had met Cas’ eyes in the rear view mirror, all he had offered was a shrug.
Dean uses his thumb to rub the suds on the blue fabric. “You’re gonna need a wash too.” he says.
On the other side of Cas, Sam gets more fidgety; he says, “If you think uh – we don’t want any trouble.”
And anyway, with him everything always seemed to be temporary. Dean knew that he was going to get his juice back and everything was going to go back to how it was.
It happens again and again. Eileen looks pointedly at Sam when Dean pops into the kitchen to say “Me and Cas are going out. Need anything?” or when they find them engaged in a serious conversation or sharing a drink. She looks at him whenever Dean calls Castiel “Sunshine” and whenever Castiel asks “Where’s Dean?” before he even gets both of his feet in the room.
. Cas is pleased to hear that. Eliot starts talking non-stop, about things he read and things he knows and asking about Jack without even giving him time to answer and Cas is only saved by Caitlin who hands him his pile of pizza boxes. Eliot follows him to the door and keeps it open for him and says
“And one for my brother,” he says, quickly snatching another before the lid closes on his fingers.
Steve nods, blinking rapidly, and he seems a little shaken too.
“… like deep sea creatures.” Cas was saying when he entered. “Dean. Do you want to join us?”
“Really, they – they are like brothers.”
Eileen laughs at the exchange so Sam addresses her. “Eileen, please tell him.”
Behind him, he hears Cas say “It’s
to warm him up before he dies of hypothermia. I’m not lying, I’m begging here. I
So Sam wanted to go and Jack wanted to go and Cas didn’t seem to be able to say no to the kid even if he tried, so Dean had to bite his cheek and wake up early the next morning to drive across the state.
Then Sam’s gaze flies somewhere behind his back and something twists in Dean’s stomach as he remembers that Castiel is still there, his body against the wall and his eyes frantically going from the crumpled bodies of the vetalas on the ground to Sam and Dean and back again.
He takes a few steps from the Roadhouse but when he turns back again, the pub seems miles away and then there’s the Impala right beside him.
Dean, on the other side of the table, lifts his gaze for a moment at the sound of his name then goes back to his gun.
“No,” said Dean, “we don’t want you to use your energies like that.”
Cas thinks he doesn’t -
“You’re safe now.” he says and tries to lighten the mood. “So, can you stop going full Spanish Inquisition on us?”
Dean downs the last piece of donut and eyes the coffee machine in the corner.
Sam closed the call and sighed heavily. “This was stressful.”
. So Castiel had walked out of there and into the kitchen, from where he could still hear them and keep an eye on them like he’d been instructed for the night.
He raises his eyebrows. “You okay there, angel? Need something?”
“Alright” Sam concedes “I’m gonna grab a shower and get something to eat. I’ll leave you a sandwich in the kitchen, then I’ll head straight to bed.” He yawns again. “I’m exhausted.”
Dean walks beside him down the empty streets, swinging the bag with the pies with one hand and touching the back of Cas’ hand with the other, once, twice. Then he grabs it. He says
“And you’re going to answer truthfully?”
“Either works.”
Cas looks back at him from the passenger seat, and it’s a sight Dean knows very well, but this time it’s different. This time he smiles and says the most amazing thing Dean could hope for.
“It’s all the same for me, I swear. I don’t care,” he adds, but saying that hurts a little, for some reason he can’t quite determine, and he finds his own frown mirrored on Cas’ face.
“She is a friend. And the bookkeeper,” he explains.
It stays there as Cas says, “You are in no better condition” and reaches up, unsure, to brush his fingers in his hair, right above his ear.
Eileen makes a disgusted face and signs: “Brothers?”
, he wants to say
It was weird to see his calves. It was weird to realize that they were always there, hidden underneath the fabric of his pants. Like his nipples and his tummy, like his elbows and his heels. It was not the first time he was seeing them, but it was always weird.
. And right after,
Cas is beautiful. Dean has seen him powerful, and he’s seen him determinate, but he’s never seen him so peaceful and ethereal. He looks like home and like something so out of Dean’s reach – except that’s not true. He told him himself that he was wrong about that. The light shines on his face and he’s got a little smile that reminds Dean of one time on the side of a darkly lit road a lifetime ago.
“Is it something you ask?” Cas said, honest confusion in his tone. “Isn’t it something that should be spontaneous?”
Dean grins and shots back,
“What do you think? For next week.”
“I have to go.”
He doesn’t expect it when he puts down the knife, turns on his heels and addresses him.
under her breath. He extends one hand and says
Dean simply cannot sit around all day, not since Michael, not since they’ve turned the bunker into a shelter for hunters from another world, not since his brother is working his ass off day and night. He is not into the whole hunter network thing, but he knows that it’s a good thing, it’s the right thing.
“Got all night.” Dean shrugs, then still sensing resistance he insists. “Hey, I answered your questions. Seems only fair you do the same.”
“Oh, you know. I’m sure he’s dealing.”
And Dean keeps coming back.
“Yeah?”
“Wh-? Oh, right, I always forget you have the superhearing,” then he has a thought and adds, “Hey, you gonna tell me if you hear someone talking shit about me, right?”
Only when they are left alone she nudges him with an elbow and Sam knows immediately what she is going to address.
He was in the other room before, the room where the lights are on and Dean and Sam and Robert are around the desk, trading books and discussing unimportant matters. He was in the room with them, until Dean said he was making him
Sam opens his mouth but Dean cuts him off before he can retort.
Pretty tacky, if you were to ask Dean in another moment. But right now, he doesn’t give a rat’s ass how the place is called. Right now, he’s got Sam slumped in the passenger seat, wet like a fish and shaking with cold.
He looks over his shoulder at the rest of the space, the heavy carpet at his feet, the fake plant in a corner, and his eyes linger on the pamphlet rack on the far end of the counter, stacked with local spring events brochures and hiking trails maps. He picks one up and gives it a once over.
He remerges a moment later wearing a tan winter jacket and a wool beanie while Dean is still trying to figure out which damn button to press. Shouldn’t latest models be simpler? He turns back to Castiel who’s shouldering his backpack.
Castiel is still wearing a frown as he turns the box in his hands and looks at the ingredients. “I suppose Jack will like them anyway. There is a dangerous amount of sugar and chemicals in these as well.”
“How about a mountain?”
They get to the cars and Dean follows him to his pick-up and Cas lets him push him against it and press his body against his. Cas slips his hands under Dean’s jacket to rest them on his hips, and kisses him slowly and the bag swings and drops from Dean’s fingers.
She turns her face to look at Sam and finds him next to her.
“Sam,” she interrupts whatever he was saying on some magical old stones. “can I ask you a question?”
When the guy walks away, Cas moves to lean on the counter by his side. Dean feels the familiar weight of his arm against his and he wonders if they could pick up the conversation where they left it. But Cas says:
“What about… feelings? Like, are those from time to time too? I never got that.”
"Alright, then why haven't you called the police?"
The guy invites him to join his friends for a drink but Dean raises his half-empty bottle and says “I’m fine, thanks.”
Dean flashes him a big smile. “That’s me.” He gets closer and confidently slips the coffee towards him. “Brought you coffee. For helping with Sammy and – not calling the police, I guess,” he says.
But then a sunbeam decides to cut through the clouds in that exact moment and has Dean looking up again. The lazy sunlight of an early afternoon shines on Cas’ face. He’s not bothered by the sudden change of light, unlike Dean, who has to squint and bring a hand to his forehead.
They were moving about in the victim’s house looking for clues and talking about other stuff, when Cas had said something along the lines of, “I could work on it once we go back to the bunker,” and Dean had asked, half distracted, “So you’re going back with us?” and Cas had his back turned and Dean had opened the drawer in that moment, but he’d heard him when he’d said:
“Good,” Cas smiles and then says, “You should make burgers. She loves them.”
help you?” Cas asks taking a step forward.
. He fights the need to look down. He doesn’t know why this is so hard for him. It’s just Cas. But that’s the point, isn’t it? It’s Cas. It would hurt ten times more if he were to say no. It’s nothing like with Claire, he asked her for
Later, as he gets to his car with Sam, he says, “Hey, you know, you were right. It was a little fun,” and his brother looks at him in disbelief.
aggressively hitting their desk bell and coming in from the snow with his arms bare and probably dirt smeared across his face, it’s not exactly the best first impression Dean’s ever given to someone. But who cares? He just wants him to do his job.
he asked.
His eyes widen slightly at the scary and uncontrolled feeling that has him unbalanced. It’s bad.
is, must be powerful stuff.
“Not going anywhere,” smiles Dean.
As soon as he says it, he turns around again.
Eileen calls his attention back. She makes fun of him saying, “Sam told me you didn’t want to come. Getting too old to leave the house?”
something something
Dean laughs then, puts a hand on his shoulder and says “Yeah, good idea.”
He floated around on his back, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his face, then went back to the beach to lay on his towel and to watch his two dorks waving about their arms and legs.
He puts it back in his pocket right as Castiel comes out of the heavy doors and happily bounces down the stairs asking “How was your journey?”. He is about to lean in to peck his lips like he always does when he takes in his expression and pulls back, asks what’s wrong.
Castiel’s mouth is still hanging open: “Venom? Dean, what -?”
One guy in a baseball cap stops in his track as he sees Dean.
And - they may not be just two individuals in a car going nowhere and nothing more, and things may not be easy, probably never will, but maybe, Dean thinks, it doesn’t really matter in the end.
It was still early but he felt tired already. Maybe he should have taken that nap like Cas.
Steve doesn’t seem like he trusts him even one bit. In fact, he doesn’t seem to appreciate at all his evasive answers.
He had missed half of the movie already and the burgers were lukewarm but it wasn’t bad. Cas laughed a few times and Sam dozed off leaning in on him like he did when he was a kid. It wasn’t bad at all.
They were stuck inside because it was raining again. It turned out to be another hunter, wondering if they were anywhere near Minneapolis because there was a vampire nest he wanted to take out that night.
“Precisely. That is what makes us able to go on for centuries. Sorrow, loneliness, regret, you cannot carry those with you for eternity.”
The air around them lightens up a little and for the first time Dean takes in Steve’s mussed hair and broad shoulders, his strong arms, his tights trapped in his jeans. Dean realizes he may have checked him out a little too obviously when his eyes snap up and unsurprisingly he’s being stared at. He covers up his embarrassment asking: “So, whatcha reading?”
“Hello, Gabriel.” Castiel greets him.
"You can say it's cause I'm handsome," he adds, teasing, breaking the silence.
and he waves awkwardly. Cas smiles and gets into his pick-up and as he drives right behind the Impala, the town, quiet and empty, rolls by outside his windows and he thinks,
“Don’t worry, he’ll be here soon.”
The case, the hunt, the long drive; the things he can’t say, do, want they all catch up to Dean at once, in that moment. He dumps his towel in the sink and takes a step to the side, crowding Cas’ space. Against him, Cas feels as solid as a statue and Dean wants nothing more than to rest his whole body against his. He feels worn out, he longs for closeness. He searches Cas’ eyes for some kind of warning, a stop sign, an I’m-about-to-flee sign, but there’s none of that. It’s just Cas. Maybe, if he had a breath, Dean thinks he would be holding it, but it’s just Cas.
The guy stays impossibly calm and that just adds to Dean’s anger.
Cas pressed his lips together but finally looked up at him.
Steve recedes of a few steps. "Your brother needed help," he says plainly, resuming his position on the stool, “I wanted to help.”
, left the room, fantasized about it for a while that night, and then didn’t think about it anymore, because there was a case and then another case.
Dean starts to relax as he sees Steve’s face lights up with curiosity and for the first time since they met it’s the kind that it’s not suspicious, just genuinely interested. Then with a hint of saracasm, Steve asks, “Why are you here?”
“Yes, and it was really cheesy. Like, very low level cheesy.”
