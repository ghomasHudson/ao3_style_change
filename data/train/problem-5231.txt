It was only when he felt a warm weight settled across his midsection and press into his side that he realised Steve had finished, and was snuggling down into bed with him. He must have fallen into a doze while Steve had been finishing up. He smiled to himself and then smoothed a hand over Steve’s arm, curling into the heat against his side until his forehead hit a solid chest. Steve smelled like the apple bathwash he’d used, and Tony wanted to bury himself in it. Stay here forever, where nothing was difficult or scary or wrong. It was all just
Tony shrugged underneath him. “They’re a good bunch. Some of the ones I can actually tolerate, you know. We used to have some fun, back when I usually hung out with them, But I missed you. I’d been expecting a date, and then it all kind of fell through.”
“Listen to your friend, Steven,” Tony nodded over to him and then took a step backward- only to be tackled from behind by an enthusiastic Thor and hoisted into the air with ease. Steve jumped again, startled by the sudden presence, but Thor just gave him a grin and then twirled Tony around a few times, happily ignoring the boy’s annoyed cries.
John talked for a few more seconds, eventually ending with the fact that they were going on a second date next week, and Steve smiled at him. That was great. He was now the second one in the group who’d made a move like that, and Steve was proud of the guy. He talked for a little bit about coping methods, told them all that this was the point in the exercise: moving on. “Seventy years ago, I thought I’d found the love of my life,” he said gently, turning to look at all of them, “then I woke up here. Thought it was all over. That I’d lost my one shot. But then I met Tony, and at first, it was hard. It was difficult to move on ‘cause I felt like I was betraying her. But I know that she would have wanted me to be happy. And if your partners loved you, then you know that’s what they would have wanted too.” He paused, before smiling softly and looking down at his lap. “I’m happy now. I never thought I could be. And it took a lot of time. But I found love again, found reason, and there is not a damn thing in the universe that I would trade that for now. And I believe that all of you will too.”
The man closed the door with a gentle snick, leaving Tony and Steve in the living room. Steve was already in his pyjamas- it was already 11pm by that point in the night, and Steve was tired. Unfortunately, it seemed he was actually going to have to do as Paul said and get to bed soon.
But he knew they weren’t things that Steve wanted to hear. They weren’t things that Steve would agree with either- despite Tony’s crippling self esteem issues, even
He banged his fist against Bucky’s door and waited by the front steps, stuffing his hands into his pockets and watching as Bucky’s familiar figure began to loom through the frosted glass.
Of course, though, Tony was nothing if not tenacious. Often to the point of intolerability, actually, as his father liked to point out. But either way—Tony had decided that he wasn’t going to give up. He could get his friends into the Halloween spirit, for sure. All he had to do was introduce them to the fun.
There was always the chance that Tony had just been planning ahead. But honestly, Steve doubted it. He’d have no reason to go into that much depth- Steve had ended things before Tony had truly gotten started with his Iron Man gig, and even if he hadn’t, he figured Tony probably would have had to tell him about it once he did. It’d be hard to hide that sort of thing from a partner, after all.
She remained quiet after he was finished, and it was only when the heavy silence enveloped the room that he realised he’d been shouting. His breath was coming in heavy and he could feel his heart racing, a panic response to the yelling in the room. He’d never used to shake when he’d argued with people before.
And now he scrambling to his feet at lightning speed, sprinting over to Steve’s unresponsive body as it lay on the floor and feeling desperately for a pulse that was no longer there.
Steve shrugged, eyeing the bit of brownie swaying around in Tony’s hand. “Only if it’s you,” he commented, grabbing Tony’s wrist and then stilling the spoon. Tony just rolled his eyes as the other man manoeuvred it in his direction, and didn’t even fight when Steve popped it into his own mouth instead. “Not so great when Norma the nonagenarian is doing it at a fundraiser for sick kids.”
Steve shut his eyes for a second and curled a hand tighter around his bag. He’d been mugged three times before- they were never particularly pleasant experiences. Left him with more than a few battle scars to prove it. But he’d survived- although that had been when he’d known the area, and how to get back somewhere safe. This was foreign ground to him, now. Just to add an extra level of danger, you know? Because this wasn’t fucking unfortunate enough, obviously.
So Tony had slid them on without a second thought and then trundled downstairs, pretty much still asleep. Mornings, especially early ones like this one, were most definitely not his forte.
He knew the little dream wouldn’t happen- realistically, they just weren’t built for that, and there would always be another emergency they felt obligated to help out with, but… well. It was just nice to wish, that was all.
“It’s not just about me and you. If you stay, you’re not going to be living the easy life, exactly. I’m Iron Man. I have to get to the bottom of whatever it is HYDRA is planning.”
Tony groaned into the tablecloth, hearing Steve’s grin in the way he huffed. Some things never changed, of course.
“Sleep, Steve. It’s 3 in the morning.” Tony patted his cheek. “blowjobs can wait until I’m a little more coherent.”
Steve hesitated. “I… about that. I was—just for today, I could really really do with a surprise doctor’s appointment or illness or something, just so I could—”
It wasn’t even a full minute before all their clothes were strewn messily over the bed, Tony pressed into the mattress as Steve lay on top of him, skin to skin, mouth to mouth. It felt heavenly; Tony’s hot skin pressing up against Steve’s deliciously cool body, keeping things from getting sticky or uncomfortable. Steve knew what he was doing, he knew how to make it all seem easy, keeping Tony laughing and relaxed and pliant through it all, up until the laughter turned to gasps because
Steve laughed, looking over at Sam as he pouted. “What was it this time? Did Clint set her house on fire?”
“You wouldn’t be having an anything if it weren’t for me! The least you can do is respect my wishes!” Peter argued, grabbing his dad’s foot and pushing, jerking him out of Pop’s arms and sending him rolling off the bed.
Seven days later, and the two of them were simply sat curled up with one another on the couch when it happened. Tony had just been watching the reruns on TV, Steve reading War of the Worlds next to him, when his mind ended up wandering over to the new coding updates that he had yet to apply to the new suit he’d been working on. They were fairly simple, really, but it’d help to regulate the stabilization of the repulsors even when working on emergency power. He’d probably need to rewire the thrusters a little, but he could probably get it done tonight if he concentrated-
Steve watched, still a little dumbfounded by the whole situation as Tony vaulted over the reception desk and began trawling around underneath it. “Are you- uh, is that allowed?”
A scared, seventeen-year old boy, who just needed his friends to be there for him, not fucking cause him even more Goddamn grief. Fuck, Steve was supposed to be the one comforting him right now, not the other fucking way round. What was he doing?
Tony cut in with a hand coming up to smack over Steve’s mouth. He’d abandoned the suit a while back, after it had stopped being useful, so Steve was feeling the warmth of Tony’s skin against his lips. “Don’t bother. I’m not going to have our last words being about…
“Nope,” he popped the ‘p’ through tight lips and then looked back up, “not yet. Which is fine. Absolutely fine.”
“It really is. Bit of a mood-killer, but I think you’ve made the message clear enough. How did you say it earlier-
“The School was full to capacity, last I heard,” Natasha piped up, but Tony just waved a hand and turned back to the coffee machine, plucking his mug from the shelf.
Bucky just nodded soberly. “He can stay over here tonight if the Wilsons can’t host him. My parents won’t mind.”
The lid was on the top of the pen, as opposed to the nib. If Steve were to guess, Tony must have been writing out a list of things to buy while he and Steve were out shopping, chewing on the lid while he thought. Then Steve would have called him down, told him they needed to go, and Tony would have sighed and dropped the pen and notebook back down on the bed, intending to come back to it later.
Steve lunged at him again, and Tony barely managed to dodge away from the suit-denting right hook sent his way. “We have a set of Adamantium cuffs, although they may be difficult to place on him while he’s still conscious. All other stun grenades and gas would probably be ineffective on him.” Tony flew backward again, not wanting to risk taking a hit from Steve at this range, but the soldier was fast, and it was hard to get a good amount of distance between them. When Steve launched himself forward and spun a kick in Tony’s direction again, it caught, and Tony felt the impact reverberate through his body, the suit managing to absorb most of the blow, but still leaving a little for Tony’s midsection. He gasped in pain and stumbled, back hitting the wall. That was going to bruise. “Sir,” JARVIS said hurriedly as Steve moved forward once more, “I think perhaps we may have to use more traditional methods for this.”
Well. At the very least, that was what Steve was assuming. According to Thor, Tony hadn’t really talked since arriving, beaten and bloody at Thor’s doorstep. Just given the guy a smile and then collapsed forward into his arms.
Tony agreed. He was wiped, and fell into the mattress easily with Steve wrapped around him. Tony could still feel the tension running deep within the other man, but he could hardly be blamed for it either. It’d been a rough night on both of them, but Tony hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d said that Steve doted on the little boy. For all his drooling and loudness and general baby-behaviour that definitely should have put off the entire team weeks ago, Peter still seemed to have managed to wheedle his way very firmly into every single one of their hearts anyway. It was his gummy smile; the way he held up his hands for cuddles whenever one of them passed. It was how he always cackled when Steve whizzed him around the room and how he adored the reactor’s light in Tony’s chest.
Math was first, and so Steve used that opportunity to have a nap- not because he didn’t care, but because he’d already asked Bruce about the subject they were studying the day before, and he’d explained it to him better than the teacher was ever going to be able to. Bruce was remarkably patient with him- with everyone, for that matter. Even though Tony said he had a very extreme temper if you managed to bring it out in him, Steve could hardly believe that at all. The boy seemed mellow to his very core. This was further proved during break, when he came to sit on their table for a few minutes and then ended getting his own salad thrown in his face by Clint (‘accidentally’, apparently). And what was most unusual is that, unlike the rest of the table would most certainly have done, Bruce didn’t even bother to hit him. Just sighed and then demanded Clint buy him a new meal, which, begrudgingly, the boy did. He didn’t even complain when Clint ended up buying him a burger cooked in peanut oil, which was what he was allergic to.
“Steve,” he murmured sleepily, rubbing his eyes and then stroking a hand gently over the arm that was stretched across his stomach and curled into his waist, “Steve, baby, I’ve gotta get up for work.”
He tried to focus on the details, but they were already too far away for him to reach, whatever temporary link or final waves of frequency having dissipated for good. Underneath him, Tony shifted a little, aware of Steve’s movements. He hummed, mostly asleep. “You okay?” He slurred.
Jan snorted, before curving off to head up the stairs and leave Steve on the bottom floor. “I really don’t have to- you make it obvious enough.” she called after him, spinning around in her little heels and then jumping up the stairs, waving to him from behind. He watched her dumbly as she reached the top of the stairs and then slipped in with another group of people easily, her smile stretching naturally over her face before disappearing around the bend.
“Okay,” and back Steve went to the kissing thing again, a finger gently tilting Tony’s head back toward him before bringing their mouths together again.
He moved his other hand, curling at around the side of Steve’s face and leaning in until they were almost nose to nose. “I love you. What happened in 2016 is something we’ve already worked through. You don’t need to bring that back. This is here and now, with a different set of circumstances that were totally out of your control. I’m never going to hold that against you.”
All of them kept walking. They were going to go around the corner in a few seconds. They weren’t going to listen.
Tony grunted, jerking his head and taking the spanner from Steve’s hand. Their fingers brushed for a second, and Steve felt the static zing all its way up his arm like it did every time they connected. “Robots, huh? Not a bad idea… or maybe I could just invest in one of those extending-claw things that cost like five dollars and are ultimately far less hassle than an entire robot.”
Tony stood there, rigid as a post against Steve for another second or two, before eventually giving in and melting into him in the way Steve knew he would. His hands came up and curled tentatively around Steve’s waist, and his head fell forward, resting upon Steve’s shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, “Steve, I’m so so sorry-“
His legs buckled as he slipped and fell to the floor. It smelled like cleaning fluid and the dust bunnies clung to his clothes as he slumped against the surfaces.
She moved jerkily, cutting out the video, and he seethed in his chair, trying to remember how to breathe. A second later, the next clip popped up. Tony blinked, recognising the ensemble she was wearing. They were the same clothes she’d worn when the police had found her, shot in the room of a motel.
There was a beat of silence. “Mr. Rogers, this is not anything you will have dealt with before. Sir has been preparing for an attack like this for a while. You have not.”
“I want to,” Steve told him simply, sitting up and brushing the stray bits of popcorn from his shirt, “come on- where do you wanna go?”
He smiled up at the other man—the one he’d loved and lost, then found again. This time, he wasn’t going to let him go for anything. Not the government, not SHIELD or HYDRA or whatever tried to come up against them. He knew the truth now. He knew Tony for the hero he was.
Steve smiled at him, and Tony smiled back. Then Steve kissed him, so Tony kissed back too. He tasted like mint toothpaste. “Thank you,” Steve repeated when he broke away, giving Tony that earnest look of his once more, “I… You don’t know how much it means to me that you care so much.”
He ended getting distracted from the question in the end (Steve was very good at doing that to him, especially when his mouth was in places that managed to shut 90% of his brain functions off completely), and by the time he’d woken up the next morning, he decided that he was going to just keep it all as a surprise. He could work on the ideas on his own, perfect it all, and then when that had been achieved, he’d ask. And Steve would hopefully say yes, and Tony would probably start crying or something, and then Steve might start crying too, and oh, yeah, there was another thing that Tony could add to his ever-growing list of ‘Things that will make The Proposal perfect’: Tissues.
“Tell that to the pockmarks on his arms from where he shot up last night in a drug den,” Thor snapped, before just raising his hands in defeat and sighing. “Sorry. Sorry. Let’s not talk about my wayward brother tonight, hmm? I’ll yell at him tomorrow. For now!” He raised his sippy cup (Steve didn’t even want to know why he had that in his house) full of mead and then beamed. “Let us drink and be merry!”
“I’ve gotta let the ingredients stew for a little,” Tony murmured, angling his face so it became pressed into Steve’s neck instead, hot breath ghosting across bare skin, “how about I show you just how much I love you while we wait?” His hand dropped lower, skimmed the front of Steve’s jeans and okay, yeah, he could definitely accept that offer.
Rhodey came back into his line of sight just then, carrying a green bag that was covered in a layer of dust. “First aid kit,” he declared, “there are some painkillers in here. Anyone got something he can wash it down with?”
Tony huffed, making absolutely no move to go and do so, instead pushing forward and licking into Steve’s mouth hungrily as his hands slid down Steve’s glistening abs and then tugged at the towel around his waist.
Tony let Steve slip Peter into his own hold and then gently carry him over to the cot backed up against the opposing wall. Peter was pretty much already asleep by then, his eyelids drooping adorably and his tiny body engulfed by the yellow duck-patterns of his sleepsuit. He was definitely cutest little kid Tony had ever seen—and that wasn’t even biased, it was just true. No other baby even compared, most of them were ugly and looked all weird, like aliens. Peter was perfect though. Obviously.
“See?” Tony made his presence known as he stepped fully into the room and beamed, “not so hard, is it?”
Steve laughed, and Tony looked slightly surprised. Like he hadn’t expected Steve to find him funny. Sensing that Tony might want a bit of time to himself, Steve realised he’d sort of just welcomed himself into Stark’s home without a second thought, and he hastily stood up, an apologetic look on his face. “I should probably be getting gone,” he said, “don’t wanna hold you up. There’s probably a million and one things you need to do now, huh?”
No, no. It would be fine. Steve was a fighter. And Tony was almost certain he was still alive. If they’d killed him, they wouldn’t have bothered to take his suit from him first, and so the flatline would have shown up on Tony’s update. And it hadn’t, ergo, Steve must still be alive. Anything else—it was secondary. The point was, Steve wasn’t dead. Tony just had to focus on that.
His thumb brushed over Tony’s contact, debating whether or not to bother. He’d be back from his lecture thingy by that point, and if Steve asked, he was sure Tony would come. But he still felt like he was being a nuisance to the other boy all the same. Tony was always so busy and fast-moving, he had so many things to do. Steve couldn’t help but feel as if he was holding him back sometimes.
Bruce asked, looking at him with deep concern, and Steve opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say it. He couldn’t even force the words out into the open, too terrified of the answer they would bring.
“It wasn’t- he doesn’t-“ Steve spluttered, but Sam jumped in this time, pulling a face as he patted Steve on the back again.
She chuckled and rolled her eyes. “No. You’re just lucky that I happen to be in New York, is all.” She stepped forward and then pressed a finger into his chest, pushing him back down onto the bed. “You were in quite a bad way when you arrived,” she said, as if discussing the weather. “Fortunately, I am very good at what I do. The regenerated tissue is healing nicely, and your body accepted the new cells remarkably well. You won’t even scar.”
Tony found his eyes trained on Peter, watching in fascination as the child curled his fingers again and again, trying to catch what wasn’t there. It was confusing to Peter, but not in a way that appeared to distress him. He was inspecting his own hand and then dropping it, looking at the window where the rain fell. Tony could almost
Natasha’s face was blank, but her eyes flashed. There was sadness there. “You may want to, and I respect that,” she murmured, “but no one else can. This happened, Tony. And whether you like it or not, it was a big deal.”
Steve, in response, just rolled his eyes and then nudged Thor in the ribs. “If you hadn’t noticed, so are you,” he told the other boy firmly, “you don’t need to burn yourself out to make other people feel better, Thor. I’m your friend. And I’ll still be your friend when you’re not feeling like yourself, too.”
“Oh good,” Tony said from the other side of the room, sitting up as he held a small green bag in his left hand, “nice to know you’ll live to see another day, Rogers.”
Steve blinked a few times and then sat up from the tub, looking over at Tony somewhat analytically. Tony looked back with a tired smile, letting Steve pull him in for another kiss, even when the other man’s hands were uncomfortably damp around his neck. Things you did for love, huh?
He pulled on his uniform hurriedly and grabbed his kitbag, stopping by Tony as the man sat on the bed and watched. There was still a small frown on his face, and Steve ran his thumb over it in an attempt to smooth it out. “I’ll check in every two hours,” he said, like always, because both of them knew how hard it could be to go about your day knowing your partner’s life was on the line. “I love you. Try not to kill anyone at the summit today.”
Steve continued to glare at the two brothers for a moment, before turning back to Tony and helping him to lie back down on the couch without another word from his pursed lips. If hospital was off the cards, then Steve needed to get to work. Tony’s face was at least clean of blood now, so he could start on sticking butterfly bandages to the worst cuts. “Thor, get some ice,” he ordered bluntly, “Loki, get Tony fresh clothes. These are—” he looked at the blood splatters that covered them and swallowed down the bile that he tasted on the tip of his tongue. “These are ruined.”
He wasn’t sure how much time passed before Tony stirred. He was usually restless in his sleep, moreso now than ever, but Steve was so caught up in his own head he didn’t really register Tony was awake until he heard the tentative “Steve?” Get whispered into the room. He blinked, turning away from the wall he was boring holes into, and tried to smile.
There was a second of silence, and Steve thought that maybe Tony was going to catch him out right away, not even let him get past the first stage of this stupid plan. It was very surprising, then, when Steve heard a buzzing, and the gates started to slide apart. “
Steve’s heart soared, and inside his head, he laughed with relief joy. They’d both done it. Steve had been right.
“Is there something in my room?” Tony turned around quickly, trying to spot the incriminating evidence, “because that’s totally not my fault and you should just ignore any dirty underwear you see in here, I don’t even spend much time-“
Tony resisted the urge to shut his eyes and thank whichever deity it was looking over him just then. “Yeah,” he took another tentative step forward, “yeah, sweetheart, it’s me—”
But when he did slip through the entrance to the living room, he did in fact see Tony. Safe and well, sleeping peacefully on the couch with the blanket curled over his shoulders.
They all looked at one another, their faces dubious. But it was right and they knew it- Peter was just a stranger’s kid who’d been dumped at their doorstep, and they needed to do the right thing and put him somewhere he could be safely relocated.
Yeah, it didn’t in Steve’s ears either- but he just shook his head and brushed it off. It was there, and that was all that really mattered. “I’m good,” he muttered, “but we need to work out what the chamber is doing. I think there are people in there.”
Worse, though, was perhaps the fact that sometimes Tony would spot Steve looking at him with a face so fucking desolate that it punched the breath straight out of his lungs. He’d watch Tony when he thought Tony couldn’t see; keep his eyes glued to the stupid leg or the mottled bruising across his face. Fuck, he barely even
Steve looked up and smiled at his entrance, rolling his eyes softly and then turning back to the morning newspaper. “Trying to see what all the hype is about. So far, not so good. You have shit taste.”
“Sorry,” he muttered, putting back the little gizmo that he’d knocked off the side, and then looked at it in confusion when he discovered it wasn’t actually a gizmo, but a weird troll-doll thing. He made a face. “What the hell is this?”
me. Just saying— Dads are a universal disappointment. I know what it feels like to never be enough.” Steve watched the dark set of eyes meet Thor’s light ones from the couch, before Loki quickly turned away, shoving his hands into his pockets nonchalantly. “Anyway, you’ve picked me off the sidewalk more than once, so I probably owe you one.”
Like a flash, Steve had crossed the room and boxed Tony in on the counter, hands pressing flat on either side of Tony’s thighs. He didn’t use many of his enhancements much, especially not in public. He loosened up around other Unhumans, but as it went, Tony often forgot that he was even a vampire at all. On rare occasions, though- like when he moved across the expansive kitchen and ended up not even half an inch away from Tony’s nose in the space of a second- it became impossible to ignore the fact that his boyfriend was, in fact, a superhuman.
Goddamn it, he just needed to get his head working properly again. Once the memories came back, he didn’t even have to worry about whatever it was that his stupid mind had decided to latch onto. Maybe he just needed to rip the bandaid off. Work through the Cognitive block and try force his way through the pain until he reached the other end.
It was a mess. But it was their own, and after two years of nothing except occasional dark motel rooms and blowjobs, it was more than Steve could ever have hoped for.
Tony rocked them side to side gently, letting Steve cry quietly into his jacket for another minute before they receded into smaller little hiccups, and then silence as Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and over to the view spun out in front of him like the finest silk.
Pepper was looking at them both in confusion, and Rhodey was nodding to him assuringly. Steve hesitated another second, before breathing in sharply and then looking down to the floor.
With an embarrassed groan, Steve pushed himself off the bath and wandered forward, his hands wrapping around Tony’s waist. He rested his mouth against Tony’s bare shoulder, kissing him absently. “It’s been
now- and before either of the scientists knew it, Thor was calling them both for dinner. They looked up from their work in surprise, before laughing bashfully. “I forgot about hunger,” Bruce said with a yawn, “and sleep, I guess.”
Steve felt himself blush. “My bad,” he whispered, and Tony laughed again, his hands reached around Steve’s neck and pulling his head upward before kissing him, quick and messy from both of their grins.
“Clint!” Jan shoved a pillow over his face and then sat on him, turning to look at Steve. “But seriously, how good
Bucky huffed, but jumped off the counter all the same. He eyed Tony as he walked back into the living room, but didn’t say anything else. Sam followed a few seconds after, leaving Tony and Steve facing off on opposite sides of the kitchen.
Now, though, it was all up in the air as to whether he’d actually get it, or whether he’d die before he could utter a single word along the lines of ‘I’m crazily, stupidly in love with you’.
“He showed me what life would have been like without me,” Steve cut in, whipping around and turning to face Tony, hands clenched so tightly that the knuckles were stark white. “He showed me what your life would have been like without me, Tony, and you know what?
The New York roads were busy as ever, and Tony watched the lights of the city pass him by while Steve drove them home, one hand on the wheel and the other a firm weight against Tony’s thigh. He briefly looked sideways, checking the other man was wearing a seatbelt. He was. Steve was a stickler for road safety. Not that a seatbelt would help all that much if, for instance, a truck was to lose control and hurtle into the side of their car right now. The model Steve had picked wasn’t reinforced. Just any other company car. Could probably withstand an impact of about 30,000 Newtons, if his math was correct. And Steve was going two miles above speed limit. That lowered the number to about 29,000 Newtons, actually. Would that be the difference between life and death? Probably not.
“A few months ago you took a Chronal Energy Distorter back to the Baxter Building after confiscating it from the Tescillian Race of super-assassins who’d been trying to erase The Avengers from history,” Steve cut in firmly, voice level and unmoving as he reeled off the facts. He could be strong in this. “When I asked what it did, you said it was a time machine. I need access to it.”
“Oh Jesus.” Tony’s face creased in amusement as he leaned his head back, finger tracing the rim of the glass. Steve watched it intently. “I had to get that car deep-cleaned, you know. He got his naked ass all over my favourite fucking Audi.”
The question, just like every other he had asked that night, was out before he could stop it. Genuine curiosity more than anything; an almost desperate desire to just know all he could about Tony Stark. There was so much he would never even have imagined- the boy was a fucking
Steve did, slowly, warily, and Bruce’s eyes were firm. “He is alive. You did not hurt him. He knocked you out and then we arrived, and we got you home, and you’ve been here for a few days. We’ve been running some tests to make sure nothing that happened has a risk of permanence. It doesn’t. There wasn’t enough time for it to even attempt to take hold of you fully. The restraints were purely to be extra safe. Do you follow me?”
Rhodey didn’t bother wasting another second. He leaned in, and Tony practically fell into the hug that Rhodey offered him. It was gentle, but the other boy’s eyes were clenched tight shut and his lips pursed as he wound his arms around Tony’s delicate frame. Steve could see the pain in his actions—how much this hurt him to see. Rhodey had been with him through everything; MIT, the death of his mom, the whole collapse that had happened after. Their friendship was one that had seen a hell of a lot of ups and downs, and it was clear from the way Tony seemed to just melt into the other boy that this was an unwavering trust he felt. This was the one person where he truly allowed himself to feel it all.
“I could probably get a good idea,” Steve said, looking down at his feet as his hand rested against the car roof, “I’m just the stupid new kid who you keep having to pull out of trouble,” he muttered.
DUM-E beeped his confirmation, rolling off to go and retrieve his special Dummyball immediately (Tony had coined that particular name). It was made of a thin flexible metal that was easier for the bot’s claws to grip to, and he had taken to dropping it at the feet of anyone who passed through the workshop in an attempt to get them to play. Tony said Steve had corrupted his worker robot and turned him into a dog, but Steve was pretty sure those attributes had been coded in by Tony himself.
Steve hadn’t touched him. Not once, since he’d come back. Tony had held out his hand, asked Steve to come lie on the bed with him when he was going to sleep like they always did, but Steve hadn’t once said yes. He’d made a flimsy excuse, given Tony a weak smile and just remained exactly where he was, hands shoved into his pockets or stuffed under his legs. He was pale and washed out, disturbingly fragile. When they’d first found out what was actually going on,  Tony had realised that it was the stupid transmission that had been making Steve look so unwell. It messed with his brain chemistry, and that was bound to affect him in a detrimental way. Another thing that Tony had been remiss about. Steve had been slowly goddamn wasting away, and all Tony had been thinking about was himself.
“You could say that. But I’m fine. I’m managing. Probably gonna call it a night soon though, I’m fucking exhausted and Steve’ll yell if I stay up too late.” He huffed and consciously relaxed his hands, but when he looked up at Natasha her face was just more strained. Like the mention of Steve alone was causing her discomfort. Tony resisted the urge to glare. “You good, Romanov?”
There was another scream and a laugh as Bruce undoubtedly tug him, and then an eerie silence. Tony paused, trying to listen in.
“Yeah,” he said quietly, “took a while to find it, considering it was- well, it was technically gone, but you know-“ he wiggled his hands a bit, “magic fingers, what can I say. You don’t have to listen to it now, I underst-“
And we have an update! I hope y'all had fun with this.... let's see what happens in the next chapter, hmmm
There was a heavy silence in the room, as everyone looked at one another. Tony observed Clint and Thor, both of whom were also sporting some injuries too. Clint had a cut bleeding its way down his forehead, and Thor’s eye was swelling up a little in the beginnings of a black eye. This, Tony suspected, hadn’t even been a proper hit. AIM had just been scouting, using the LMD’s to confirm what they were suspicious of. But if this was what they were sending for preliminary reports, then God only knew what they were gonna do next time.
Sam sometimes warned him about making rash decisions in the heat of his emotion, always saying he would regret it later. But this was not something he would ever do differently, if he was given the choice. Whether it was a day or a decade between Tony dying and Steve discovering he could change that, Steve would always choose this path. Always.
“Tony, dammit, you shouldn’t be looking at that stuff!” Steve grabbed his arm and tugged him out of the store cupboard, shutting it with a click before turning back to him. “Are you feeling okay? Do you need to see a doctor?”
He was cut off by the hard press of Tony’s hand against his mouth, and was pushed into an upright position when Tony tilted his head up and looked at him deeply, a horrified expression on his face. His brow was furrowed so deeply that Steve could’ve stuck a coin between the creases. “What?” He whispered, shaking his head wildly, “Steve,
Truly fucking awful. The new Advertising Manager turned out to be a complete fucking asshole, and the whole reshoot involved her trying to push him into acting sleazy on camera the whole time. The VR headset was something Tony wanted to put into the world because of the imagination it inspired, the people it allowed to help- and she tried to make him promote it like it was some sort of techno sex toy, which was totally not the angle Tony had wanted to use. He’d refused to say any of the jokes she’d given him, and when she’d handed him a martini for him to use as a prop and then told him to drink it in order to loosen up, Tony had had to just walk out. His issues with alcoholism were public knowledge, and most people at Stark Industries were very much aware that he’d been sober for nearly a year now- he didn’t usually have a problem being told to have a drink these days, but it just… hadn’t been the right time, and Tony couldn’t deal with it.
But Steve just had to keep going, calmly and collectedly, until he reached the meeting room where he was headed. It was a small place, tucked away in the corner of the 1
heart?” Jane asked from inside Thor’s arms. And no, if you’re wondering, that hadn’t taken long at all. He really hadn’t expected Jane to be quite so… forward. Not that it was
“She was still alive,” Tony whispered, eyes shutting for a second as he breathed in, “they both were, and they both visited when they could. Kept me mostly under control, I guess.”
Tony nodded, understanding dawning. “Oh. Yeah. I figured.” He paused, and then explained. “You sometimes… in the night. I hear you. You usually stop when I-“ he pulled back a little, looking at Steve questioningly before he raised his hand and settled it over Steve’s heart. “I’m here,” he said softly, leaning forward and kissing Steve’s forehead, “I’ve got you. You’re okay.”
Tony sighed, shutting down the holoscreens and then rolling back out of the workshop. The doctors had ‘strongly recommended’ staying in the wheelchair for at least a few weeks, but honestly, Tony couldn’t stand the thing, and figured it would take about two more days for him to just give it up entirely and start using the crutches. Until then, though, he was resigned to wheeling his way around the tower. It took double the time for him to make his way up to his and Steve’s room than it would have done without the stupid wheelchair, but he supposed that would’ve been the same with a crutch as well. Either way, it sucked. He hated these sorts of injuries- the ones that stuck around the worst possible ways.
Tony hummed sleepily when Steve shuffled into the bed next to him five minutes later, and Steve smiled, gently pulling Tony into his arms. His eyes fluttered briefly as he rolled into Steve’s hold, but he didn’t wake and a few seconds later he was back to snoring gently into Steve’s shoulder. He’d probably wake up covered in drool, which should really be a gross thought but honestly, Steve couldn’t say he cared. His fingers curled around the back of Tony’s head and he played with a little loop of dark hair for a second before letting his head rest back down upon the pillow. He probably wasn’t going to sleep that night—not when his emotions were still running haywire in his head—but for now, he was just content to hold Tony in his arms and try and imagine that it helped in any way at all.
Clint rolled his eyes as he too swiped his own gun from a nearby corpse. “No point saying that to him. It’s Tony on the line here.” He pointed at Steve. “Also, can I just mention that you’re paying for my skis when we get back. I got these specially designed and everything.” He attempted to tug the dark purple ski from within the chest cavity of the man underneath him, but sighed when the thing wouldn’t even budge. Admittedly, Steve had thrown it at a pretty rapid velocity. They’d been the only thing available to use as a weapon at the time, short of throwing Clint himself, which probably wouldn’t have gone down very well.
“I don’t care, Tony, seriously,” Steve told him seriously, looking up at him through his eyelashes and noting the way Tony’s own eyes were blown wide, how his cheeks were tinted with pink and his throat working as he swallowed nervously. He genuinely was scared that Steve thought that little of him. It made his heart hurt, just a little bit. “I know who you are. I see you. And I’m not going to change my mind.”
What he hated most, though, was how even after everything had come to light- even now Tony knew that it hadn’t been Steve, it would never be Steve- he still wondered whether one day it might be. Like the curtains had been pulled back and the floodgates opened, Tony had gotten lost in the thoughts of how much it would take to push the real Steve Rogers to his limit. Make him snap, lash out, hit and scream like the other version had. Tony wasn’t, at his heart, a good man. He pushed and pushed and pushed, it was in his nature, and not only that, but he did it in the most asshole-ish way possible. He could probably turn God himself into a fit of violent rage. Steve, if it ever happened, would be entitled to that. Tony was someone who deserved a punch in the face occasionally.
He didn’t know why he cared that much. Maybe it was the fact that Steve couldn’t quite look at the Tony he was seeing up ahead of him and correlate it to the one who’d eaten ice cream with him the day before. But whatever the reason, it was enough to make him keep his distance.
He smiled at the ceiling as he slipped from the doors, knowing that JARVIS’ cameras would pick it up. “Get one of the good-for-nothings upstairs to put a hot-pocket on for me, will you?”
“If you were about to tell me you’re ‘not good enough for that’, or anything along those lines, I’m going to throw myself right back out of that window,” Tony jerked his head to the left, crossed legs bumping Steve’s when he moved. He shook his head again, sighing and knocking his forehead gently against Steve’s as he glanced downward and then closed his eyes. “Sweetheart, I promise, I
“You’re not fucking invincible, Steve,” Tony told him, fingers flexing against Steve’s heart worriedly, “you always- you always talk about yourself like you’re just this… this piece of meat that can take as many beatings as you throw at it, but you’re
And if Tony was right—if what he said about HYDRA, Rumlow, everything—was true, then it meant that Steve had handed him right into the mouths of the hungry lions, and then walked away. Whatever happened now, he knew Tony would never forgive him. He didn’t deserve it. Not after everything he’d done. All the lies-that-weren’t-lies he’d told to get where he needed to be.
“He’s alright,” Steve told him quietly, nodding at Clint as the boy leaned backward and raised a concerned eyebrow in his direction, “it was—last night was bad. He wasn’t in a good way. But me and Thor patched him up best we could—”
“Love you,” he mumbled absently, feeling Steve pull his socks off with a small tinker of laughter. He got another kiss for that.
Steve took the phone apprehensively, looking through Bucky’s contacts until finding James Rhodes and hitting dial. It only took a few seconds for the response, the boy’s low voice filling Steve’s ear. “Hello?”
He stopped briefly at Clint's side, unaware he'd even moved in that direction until he was booping Peter gently on the nose. "Be good, wretch," he muttered, not looking at Clint as the man sniggered, "I'll see you all this evening."
Tony winked, before turning back around walking over to the wall again. “The branch from the tree over the other side hangs down onto this part of the wall. You can climb up part of the way from the footholds in the wall, and then use the branch to pull yourself the rest of the way,” he explained, pointing to a particularly gnarly and old branch and then leaping high, catching hold of it without another word. He’d scrambled up and was sat on the wall faster than it would have taken Steve to say another sentence, grinning down smugly at him.
The door on the other side of the room suddenly burst open before his train of thought could finish, and Tony jerked in surprise as he watched Thor- clad in the most grotesque festive jumper Tony had ever seen, and reindeer ears atop his head- stride into the room with a smile the size of his face. He was also carrying a huge turkey on a tray. “MERRY CHRISTMAS!”
“I don’t… I don’t want you to punch him, Bucky,” Steve said irritably, rubbing his face, “and he will come. He’s probably just busy or something.”
Bucky yelled for mercy and called on Steve for aid. He glanced sideways, watching Peggy dig in under his armpits and tickle mercilessly as he lay flailing on the floor.
"I don't know what the context is, but I hear Clint's shins are going to be removed and I'd just like to say I'm in favour," Sam slid into the seat next to Steve and opened up his lunch. When he looked at Steve, he wordlessly handed over a cookie. Not even willing to politely argue, Steve just mumbled his thanks and then shoved it all in his mouth at once.
Steve was on his feet like a man possessed. Tearing across what was left of the deck, he ran and he ran and he ran.
Tony was shaking violently, and Steve, feeling like the most useless person on Earth at that moment, just made some stupid noise in the back of his throat and then pulled Tony into his arms, wrapping around the boy like he could just push all the broken pieces together if he pressed in hard enough. “Hey,” he said softly, fingers finding Tony’s hair and then beginning to curl through the soft strands gently, like his own mom had used to do to him whenever he’d cried, “hey, it’s okay. I’m here. I understand. Tell me a little bit about her, huh?” He asked gently, feeling Tony’s fingers flex against his sides, “tell me what she was like.”
Did Steve think that was weird? Was he wondering whether Tony was getting too clingy, or reconsidering the fact that—
“Because he knows how much I know about him. More than anyone else does. He won’t talk if he knows I will.”
He didn’t stop to listen to whatever stupid crap they tried to throw at him; instead kicking the chair he was sat on over and storming out of the room angrily, ignoring their calls and running up into his room before they could bother him.
He paused, looking at her and shutting off his phone. Her face looked unimpressed, and it made something sink in his stomach. “He jumped in before Ty could swing at me,” Steve said, hoping that would sway a little favour Tony’s way.
“Oh, darling, you wound us,” Peggy dived for him, tugging him back down on the bed, where he was sat on by a pouting Bucky. “Yeah, Steve, look at how wounded we are.”
“Steve, does it matter?” Tony’s voice got a little snappier as he glanced back and frowned, pushing a hand through his hair. “It was years ago. It’s a fucking sex tape, I’m famous and they were probably offered a shitload of money for it, so they accepted. That’s all you need to know.”
“A grown-ass man who never got to actually be a kid,” Steve raised an eyebrow, and looked back out on to the horizon.
those bastards were up to something.” Tony shoved his pants on and then stumbled out of the door without looking back, and with a noise of surprise, Steve shoved the blankets off and followed him. He thought he must have misheard that—a giant robot rising out of the sea? What? For a moment, he wondered why SHIELD hadn’t alerted him, but then he remembered that even if they knew about it at this point, his work-phone was currently on the other side of America. He knew there was a West-Coast division of SHIELD, but he had no idea how long their response time would be, and JARVIS had said there were already casualties. This was not good.
Steve watched his face flicker for a second, eyes dimming. And then before Steve could even ask, Tony was shutting down and closing off, stepping a little bit out of Steve’s space as his real smile left and then came back different. Brittle.
“Well- I promised, didn’t I?” Tony replied delicately, and when Steve looked up, he was smiling downward at Steve. It didn’t last long; gone once he realized Steve had caught him- but the memory lingered in Steve’s mind, and more than anything he wanted to put it back there. It was an almost irrational desire- even after what had happened, even though it really shouldn’t matter that much- Steve just wanted him to smile.
He’d been on some stupid talk-show, doing the usual PR rounds that he always had to do when a new big Stark Product launched. Also on that talk-show had been another celebrity with whom Tony may or may not have had a tremendously large crush on in his younger years, and now merely swooned over whenever he saw the man in movies. Steve knew that. Steve had always laughed and rolled his eyes and said Tony’s starstruck face always reminded him of a teenage girl.
"What happened to piss you off so much, then?" Clint turned to Steve curiously, and Steve just huffed again.
Yeah, he figured- they held hands at school. Tony kissed him on the forehead before he left sometimes. He didn't go for the contact when they were in full view of a lot of people, no, but Steve just figured that was because he didn't want people getting up in his business about it like they usually did. Life of the rich and famous; barely anything was private.
On the other end of the fort, Tony and Bruce were engaged in what sounded like a highly scientific conversation, talking about carbohydrate levels and the sweet/ savory balance of a topping. Steve, meanwhile, was teaming up with Peggy and choosing to use guerrilla warfare in order to subdue Clint- the constant barrage of peanut shells at his head was going to wear him down soon, and when it did, team Pineapple-Should-Die would be victorious-
Beside him, Thor coughed and raised his hand. “As someone who is decidedly interested in fashion and takes multiple online courses on the subject, may I interject with my opinion?”
Steve spluttered for a moment, before landing with a solid “what the fuck? Uh, since when could you even drive? Since when did you even have the money for this? Since… why?”
Without even meaning to, Steve suddenly found himself an inch and a half from Tony. He barely even registered it; hands going up for the ring and then slipping it back onto his thumb where it belonged, feeling the cool metal against skin like a long lost friend.
Her chair went back to four legs as she grabbed her notepad and then began to scribble quickly on it. Steve frowned in curiosity, watching her for a few seconds until she lifted up the pad and showed him a very bad stick-figure drawing of what appeared to be Tony, with a massive downturned face. There was an arrow coming from him, leading to the words
“Tony- it’s the guy Steve’s been spending an awful lot of time with lately,” Darcy informed helpfully, shooting a sly smile over to Steve and nudging his elbow.
Actually- scratch that- yes he was. It was Clint. All bad things in the world happened because of Clint.
“I won’t be responsible for killing you, Steve,” Tony told him, so small and fragile as he wiped a hand across his face and scooped up the tears, “I couldn’t live with that.”
In his head, he heard the voice of his girlfriend from back when he was twenty, looking at him in surprise when he’d said no to marrying her. They’d known eachother for two fucking months, but hey- being the next of kin of a Stark paid pretty well, so she’d taken her shot. Then, when he’d rejected her, she’d left the next day. That was it. He’d fulfilled his use, he’d bought her the expensive rolex and the Gucci dress that she’d always wanted, but once that’d dried up, there was no point in keeping him around.
Steve’s thumb smoothed across Tony’s wrist. There was nothing accusatory there. But Tony… Well, Tony had never thought of it that way, and suddenly he felt like scum. Unaware of this, Steve continued. “He’s only just found some sense of stability, and kindness, and family. Do we really want to take that from him?”
“I stay well away from trouble, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Steve called out to his turned back. Tony shot one last grin over his shoulder at Steve, and his stupid hair fell into his stupid eyes as his head moved. Steve really wished he didn’t find that quite as hot as he did.
“Your cigarette,” Steve leaned and kissed him lightly again, because he just couldn’t help himself, “sorry, I put it out again.”
Steve’s eyes widened in surprise at the aggressiveness of Tony’s words, and his hand reached out, tugging him back the same way that Tony had done for him a few seconds previously. Zeke was staring at him, his mouth a little agape as Tony stepped back and continued to glare unwaveringly at him.
Steve turned his head away from Tony and over to the area he was pointing to, and he felt his mouth falling open at the sight he was met with.
“Pretty sure that wasn’t what Doctor Erksine wanted you to be, bud,” Tony waved off Steve’s self-deprecation easily while Steve just stared at him, confused. When Tony saw the look, he shrugged. “My dad was part of rebirth, remember? He told me everything that happened. Told me what Doctor Erksine said to you. ‘Not a perfect soldier, but—”
“Eat,” Steve told him, and Tony could admit to himself that he wasn’t feeling particularly hungry, but the resolute look in Steve’s eyes told him that the command wasn’t exactly up for discussion. So he caved and chewed slowly while Steve texted on his phone, to whom, Tony didn’t know. His face was set determinedly, shoulders hunched up as his fingers moved. He made sure to keep his ankle wrapped around Tony’s as they both sat at the table, though, and as soon as Tony was finished eating, he dropped the phone and looked back up with a smile. “Bed?” He asked, voice hopeful.
“I’m scared, Tony,” Steve cut in with a sigh, clearly wanting to rip the bandaid off and just blurt it out, “I am scared of touching the baby. It’s not-- it's absolutely not that I don’t think you’re a person I’d want to settle down with, that’s completely insane. I love you more than anything. Starting a family with you would be…” he looked down, blushing a little. “It’d be perfect,” he finished softly.
Frost cocked her head a little, and Steve caught Ty smirking across at a few of his friends. “Hmm,” she said after a while, turning her eyes back over Steve’s head and across to Tony instead, “so this is our replacement then?” she asked, her voice soft- dangerous.
“Well, it’s been so many months since anyone even fucking invited me to one I’ve forgotten about whether or not they even exist-”
There was a long silence, only Steve’s breath filling the room that he had turned away from. He didn’t think he could bear to look at any of it.
Steve glanced at a clock on the wall as he crept into another section of the freshly abandoned corridor. He’d only been here for twenty minutes, but he had to admit, he was kind of bored. When you’d saved the universe a handful of times and the world a dozen more, taking down shitty AIM bases was just lame.
His teeth chattered as he watched Natasha and Bruce quietly begin to move around the room, talking in low voices and picking up seemingly random bits of old junk from wherever they could find it. Admittedly, there wasn’t much, but they managed to make a small pile after ten or so minutes of pilfering and dismantling of various pieces of furniture. A few minutes after that, Rhodey came back in and Bruce went out, presumably to take over the shift. His best friend’s eyes zeroed in on him immediately. “You’re awake.”
Steve stopped, the high-pitched voice not registering as familiar to him. He turned, hand still at the handle of the door which led out to the parking lot, and spotted the Parker kid panting slightly, a few feet away from him. He must have run to follow Steve out of the room.
His head rested against something. It was warm, but solid. Steve tried to focus in on it. Golden, maybe. Angel? Was he dead?
Steve sat on the edge of the tub and looked at Tony in the reflection of their bathroom mirror, head cocked. Tony smiled at him, clearing his throat as he brought the comb up to his damp hair. “Yeah,” he said easily, “yeah, I was just… tired, that’s all. Wanted a shower. It was goddamn sweltering in that restaurant.”
Tony laughed again, and his hand slipped from Steve’s forearm to hand as he pulled them through into the studio, “how sweet. I could say the same thing about you, art-boy,” Tony’s gaze flicked down to Steve’s chest before coming up again, “and I expect to see all those drawings of me at some point, too. Just saying.”
it was his fucking fault, it was all him. But if he raised his voice, Tony would hear him, and if Tony heard him shouting, God only knew how he’d react. Steve didn’t want to find out.
It was more than just sick. It was… something else entirely. Something Tony couldn’t even put a name on. Inhumane, maybe. But even that just seemed too trivial.
“M’tired,” he said quietly, before looking at Steve with the most helpless expression Steve had ever seen on the other boy, “I’m scared. I don’t… now what? What do I… what—”
They’d hit him over the head with a stuffed toy and called him a loser. Steve had wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and kissed the back of his neck until Tony got distracted enough for Bruce to slam himself into Tony’s front and declare a group hug. Everyone had laughed, and it had been the happiest Tony had been in a long time.
“PETER PARKER, YOU BETTER GET YOUR BUTT OFF THE CEILING RIGHT THIS INSTANT OR NO TV FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT!” Steve yelled, arms folded and giving his best ‘
Steve kissed him again, and again and again and again, simply because he could and he never wanted to stop. “You’ve already done so much,” he promised with a sharp nod, “so much, Tony, I don’t want anything else-“
A short chuckle, and then Tony shuffled again. “Wait and find out,” he told Steve casually, although it was near-impossible to miss the tentativeness behind his words.
,” Tony shook his head sharply, voice getting harder, “it’s not… it’s just complicated. But this is what I’ve got, so I just have to deal. It’s not that bad, anyway. I’m gonna be out of there soon, and once I am-“ something flashed behind his eyes. Something sharp and vindictive in a way Steve hadn’t ever seen before. “- I am going to burn my father and everything he ever built to the ground. And then I’ll salt the earth.”
“What else would I do?” Steve replied, kissing Tony’s temple softly, “I couldn’t just leave my best fella to struggle alone, could I?”
He looked down, suddenly feeling disastrously close to tears. “Never let people hurt others. Don’t let them hurt you either. Not even if you love them. It’s never,
“Your word means nothing, Stark,” Zeke called out as they both walked down the corridor; Tony’s hand curled tight around Steve’s arm, “you’ve lied too much for anyone but Rogers over there to believe you.”
But Steve was looking at him with his calm face and his questioning smile, and he quite clearly wanted this for Tony. Even if Tony didn’t want it for himself. So he nodded instead, and without another word, Steve took them both up to their room. It was dark when they got there, only the pinpricks of light from the city below them shining through the windows to guide their path. But Steve led them firmly and confidently, and Tony followed without question. He eventually flicked the lights of the bathroom on, handing Tony his toothbrush.
Steve just paused, his face turning sour for a moment. “Seriously?” He asked, voice hard. “You’re gonna fuck around with someone else all night and then come home and push your own boyfriend away?”
“So where have you been these past few days?” Steve asked, licking at the rather grim-tasting soy-milk icecream and trying not to pull a face.
“That’s not… Thor, he’s 7 months old,” Tony squinted at him, “he barely even has a concept of reward, and bed-time isn’t something he’s discovered he hates yet.”
By the time the team had all woken up to go for breakfast, Tony had a stack of new things for all of them. He nodded to himself in approval and then brushed his hair off his face, standing up on stiff limbs to go and join them all. They should like all this- at the very least, they’d appreciate the work he’d done. Gathering all the bits and pieces up into his arms, he scurried out of the workshop and then tapped the buttons on the elevator with his toe, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet as he waited to get taken up to the communal floor. The team were all sat in sleepy silence around the counter while Bucky cooked something in the frying pan, but they all looked up at him and smiled as he entered. Tony smiled back, his heart warming. “Santa’s arrived.”
“Shhhh,” Steve smoothed a hand through Tony’s hair and kissed him again, “don’t worry about it for now, alright? You just sit there and let me look after you. It’s all gonna work itself out.” Thor came back with the ice pack in that moment, and Steve snatched it out of his hands and placed it delicately against the angry bruises that flared up across the side of Tony’s face. Steve worked meticulously, going over every one of Tony’s injuries and fixing them up as best he could while Thor sat next to the other boy and just talked—about anything and everything he possibly could think of. Loki came back after a while, dropping the clothes on the side of the chair.
He slipped through the doors of their room, toeing off his shoes at the threshold and then running a hand through his hair, thinking of warmth and covers and soft pillows. He could do with falling straight to bed by that point in the night. It had been a good time, but a long one too. Although, unfortunately, he knew he was also probably going to have to shower before-hand too. He smelled like alcohol and sweat
who got this, who was lucky enough to see Tony Stark for who he really was: not the carefree asshole with too much money and a half-formed deathwish- but a clumsy, brilliant inventor with a heart of gold and a smile that made Steve want to do outrageous things in order to keep it there.
“You’re so beautiful Steve, so so beautiful, I could never look away and I wanted- but then I found out you were with Barnes and I thought I was gonna die-“
The man only grinned, dropping into a roll and then slamming a molten fist into Tony’s chest, sending him backward again. “We have different skillsets,” Cass informed him, “I’m freelance. And prettier.”
,” Tony said harshly, jaw clenching, “not now, Steve, please, just go back to class, I’m meeting my friends, I don’t have time to hear about how you conveniently forgot to mention your angry boyfriend waiting back home for you while you were with me- and I don’t care either.”
“Shut up man, Bruce Willis is about to fall down the vents and die!” Sam threw a pillow his way, hitting Tony in the face and then turning back to the screen. Steve just rolled his eyes, taking the pillow from Tony and then hurling it back at Sam before flopping back down on his spot on the couch. When Tony looked around slightly bewilderedly, Steve just tugged on his wrist and pulled him right down next to him.
“If I get him to say Bruce’s name in the next week, will you rescind that statement and let me groom him into a little baby genius? He can be like Tony two-point-oh.”
Strange place to go, really. Bath, shower, sink, toilet- hell, Tony had even installed a little foot bath thingy for when he went into the workshop barefoot and ended up with grease and dust and dirt all over his feet. But basically, what Tony was trying to get at, was that the place was full of water. Absolutely full of it. And that was the very same motif that was causing this rather spectacular panic attack, actually, so if he’d have had any sense when he’d been trying to make his tactical retreat, he really would have gone somewhere else. Anywhere else.
“Yeah, I know,” Mr. Wilson sighed, “that’s exactly what I’m worried about. Look, we’ll talk about it more when you get back from school, alright? I don’t want to do this down the phone.”
He couldn’t stop imagining the way Steve had just been so… lifeless, underneath him. There hadn’t been any blood, any twitching. Steve hadn’t even cried out. His heart had just stopped, and his body had stopped with it. It had been like looking at a corpse.
“Oh, s’alright Nat, he’s coming around,” the man said above him, and Steve moaned softly as he dragged his eyes open. The light burned into his retinas, and so he quickly rethought his decision and snapped them shut once more. The buzzing still rang out in his ears. “Jesus, Steve, how do you manage to propel yourself into the most dangerous objects you can find, huh?”
“Oh by all means, inform me,” Steve said, equally as cold. He wasn’t going to back down to a bully like Ty. Not now, not ever.
, fine, but you’re totally doing all the work,” he groused, folding his arms and then finally letting himself smile as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled him in close for a kiss. They made out easily against the chrome walls of the elevator and Tony may possibly have asked JARVIS to slow down the ascent up to the top floors so that he and Steve could engage in some heavy petting, which proved just how effective that so-called ‘Tony Face’ actually was, really. By the time they exited into the common area a few minutes later, they were both a little more dishevelled than they had been by the time their friends had seen them last. Luckily, Clint was thoroughly engrossed in whatever children’s comic he’d picked up to read and Natasha simply let them off with a raised eyebrow and a small glance over to the elevator.
“Does it bother you?” Tony’s voice was firm up until the next part, when it started to waver just a tad. “Does it—freak you out, that that’s the sort of person you’re in a relationship with?”
Steve just hummed his reply against Tony’s mouth and let his arms wrap tighter around Tony’s waist, teeth biting gently on his bottom lip. Tony shuffled a little for a better angle, legs and arms tangled together on the sofa as they kissed.
Wandering into his room, he shut the door and then flung himself onto the mattress, getting comfy amongst his pillows before turning his phone back to Tony’s messages, a soft smile on his face.
"Yes, you're supposed to be fucking be," she grumbled, tugging out her hair from the fancy updo and then flicking the band at Bucky's ear, "ugh, I think I'm going to give up on this. Let mum and dad think I'm some sort of undateable witch, I don't care. Hey, maybe I could date some random guy for like a week, just to get them off my backs about it. That might be an option."
Settling back down on the bed, he shuffled his head just a little bit closer down toward Tony and then took one long breath, filling up his lungs so he wouldn’t need to breathe for a minute or so. He stared up at the ceiling, letting his body go still and his ears focus on the expansive quiet of the room. For a few seconds, he couldn’t quite focus on it properly, but then-
But Steve couldn’t just stand by. If he’d gotten this wrong, which he was becoming more and more convinced about as the seconds ticked by, then he needed to make it right before something terrible happened. And at his core, Steve was a man of morals. He knew he needed to make this right. Needed to know, in his heart, that he had done the correct thing.
Steve stayed there for a second before pushing off. Everyone in the room was looking at him in surprise.
He grabbed an antiseptic wipe that Thor had laid out on the coffee table behind him and then wiped over his shaking hands thoroughly, before pulling out another one from the pack and shuffling closer to Tony. “This is gonna hurt a little,” he said, thumb stroking reassuring across Tony’s jaw, “but just hold on for me, okay?”
Steve froze, and then blinked incredulously. “What?” He asked, “No, that's not true. I’ve always wanted… I just—”
He caught it absently in his fist and then popped it into his mouth, much to Clint’s annoyance. “Sometimes people do this thing called work, Barton. It’s actually pretty productive, you should try it sometime.”
“How do we know he’s the only one?” Thor asked solemnly, looking over to Natasha. But it was Tony who answered.
But, hell, he wasn’t going to reject a Christmas fucking miracle when one came along. He grinned to himself and leaned even further sideways to kiss Steve’s cheek, because that was allowed now, and maybe he was a little doped up on painkillers and it was making him more impulsive, but whatever. Steve’s cheek was
His phone rang, and Tony nearly jumped out of his skin, splashing coffee everywhere as he jerked. The scalding liquid stung where it stained his arm, but he ignored it in favour of reaching for his phone and looking at it through tired eyes. When he saw the caller ID, he ended up dropping the coffee entirely in his haste to answer. “Steve?”
“That was exhausting and terrifying and you’re not allowed to leave me alone with him ever again,” Steve muttered, letting his eyes close and head rest against Tony’s shoulder as the man walked forward to pull him into his arms.
Steve huffed and jerked free of the obstruction, and then caught Tony just watching him, eyes soft. Aware Steve had spotted him, he quickly shook his head and turned back to Natasha and Clint’s continued argument, but whilst he watched them, his hand found Steve’s on the table and his fingers started tracing lines into the back of his palm absent-mindedly. Steve smiled again. He loved when Tony did that- the thoughtless contact, the easy touches- it was… it was nice.
He checked back at Steve, watching him put his serum-enhanced reflexes to use as he dodged out of the way of a double attack from two high-paced enemies, body twisting and rolling like water. He’d already got a solid hit to the first one, but the second was still holding strong, keeping up with Steve’s pace and nipping out of the way of any hits before they could land. Even so, Tony didn’t doubt that Steve would come out on top any minute now. And Natasha and Clint seemed to be doing okay as well. The cyborg was strong, but the pair of Avengers had years of experience on their side, and after working with Tony for so long, they’d become used to the tricks of the robotic trade.
“I know. I think I’ve found a way in though, if that helps.” Tony spun around the robot until he hovered over the sea, and the robot turned to face him. “JARVIS finished his scan; he’s telling me the barrier around it is concentrated energy—it moves to follow where the attack is coming from. I’ve been flying around too much, that’s the problem. But if you and those army nuts over there concentrate a round of heavy fire at its front, then the energy field will be strongest on your end. Maybe I’ll be able to get through the back of it, where there’s less of a barrier.”
“The classic red Mustang parked rather shoddily on the other side of the sidewalk,” JARVIS informed him helpfully, and Steve nodded, the model springing into his mind. Tony had driven him out in that once; it was one of his favourites.
His first instinct was to throw it in the trash, just to spite him. Of course, that didn’t last long- he hated wasting things, and the jacket probably cost a hell of a lot of money. Tony would want it back, and Goddamn it, Steve owed him at least that much. He felt morally obligated- stupid fucking principals, couldn’t just let him be a petty bastard for a single second.
God, his ribs hurt. Tears were burning in his eyes, and he felt like his heart was going to sink through the floor. Everything was just so
Tony made as if to grab it, but then gave up halfway through. He settled for just looking shifty. “It’s… kind of interesting,” he admitted, before adding defensively “there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m not- you can’t tell anyone anyway, they won’t believe you, so there’s not much point.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, unable to stop himself, “I know it wasn’t real, I know, but it felt like it was. I felt like I was… doing that. And I’m so sorry. I’m so so-”
Tony didn’t bother with a speech; he chose instead to just slap Steve lightly around the back of the head and then snatch the cup from his hand, taking a sip before Steve could stop him.
“You’d have to marry me before we can get divorced,” he mumbled through a warm smile, “and I feel like that would be a bit of a waste of time.”
Except… he goddamn had to. He couldn’t just leave it like that- Tony had totally saved his ass last night, and Steve hadn’t even thanked him. That was just unacceptable- his mom had raised him better than that, dammit.
Yeah. Steve definitely didn’t like him. He turned back around again, looking at the place he’s last seen the both of them and grimaced.
Tony let Steve’s hand drop, and then just stood there silently. His breathing was harder now- whereas Steve felt his had stopped completely.
“We’re gonna need to take a detour first though.” Steve nodded up the stairwell and started moving, Tony following along behind him. “You can’t walk around like that. You’re way too noticeable.”
Eyes still shut, he nodded and then found the hem of his shirt, tugging jerkily. Steve, however, gently pressed open-palmed hands into his wrists and then slid down, taking Tony’s place and doing a far more efficient job. He’d gotten the shirt off quickly, and then to Tony’s surprise, he felt a shuffling a moment later as Tony was pushed away slightly, and then a soft warmth falling over his neck and pooling around his collar. It smelt like Steve.
. He was touching Steve, after all this time, after all those battles, after Steve had questioned whether or not they’d ever be able to bring Tony back home.
“I am going to fucking fire Delaney Collins,” he responded instantly, knowing that Steve had no idea who that was, but needing to get the words out anyway, “fucking idiot sent me these stupid prints that I can’t make any fucking sense of, it’ll take me hours to try and work it out from scratch and I don’t have time, he cut his day short and I can’t even get ahold of him now, fucking Christ, I’m firing him. I’m firing him.”
of course he shows it, that’s the only thing he ever can do well- but then his goddamn mouth just has to run off and say something stupid and they’re right back at square-fucking-one again. He doesn’t know what to do, and he just… he doesn’t feel like one of them. It hurts.
“Are you sure that you know what you’re doing?” She asked softly, her voice strangely poignant in the silence of the early morning.
Tony was yelling at Steve, because Steve had decided to go out on a fucking SHIELD callout that morning without telling Tony, had walked out of it with a knife sticking out of his fucking thigh and then hadn’t even bothered to tell Tony as much until he’d jostled the man’s leg and heard him gasp in pain that evening.
“Oh ha ha,” Steve said, feeling a buzz in his pocket that signified another message. Probably from Tony. With a quick hand, he slipped out his phone and checked- the smile on his lips coming automatically as Tony’s name read on the notifications in front of him. “Shut the fuck up, both of you,” he clicked a finger toward Sam and Darcy, stopping the inevitable teasing before it could begin, and heard the stifled sniggers in response, but chose to ignore them. Bigger person and all.
Tony didn’t seem to mind either, because as soon as Steve’s mouth touched his, he melted right back in again, a soft hum of happiness vibrating in his throat that turned into a little giggle a moment later. “Steve, I have to- I have to get ready, Jesus-“
But what choice did they have, really? Like Natasha had said, they couldn’t fucking keep him. That was just absurd.
“Shhhh,” Tony said soothingly, and Steve had no idea how Tony had even known to come in, whether JARVIS had alerted him or it’d just been a lucky coincidence, but God, Steve was glad he was here, “Shh, it’s okay, it’s alright, don’t apologise. I’ve got you. You’re safe.”
Steve narrowed his eyes a little as he gave him the once-over. He’d seen the guy around; hung out with Tony and his group sometimes. His hair was a dirty blonde, longer than Steve’s and slicked back. He dressed expensive- designer clothes without a stain or thread loose.
“I need to talk to Steve about this,” he said eventually, voice low, “I’ll get back to you in a bit, okay? Yes, I’m aware. No, Natasha, Jesus Fuck, I’m not saying… look, I’m not having this conversation with you right now. Just remember that it’s not only my fucking life on the line any more. I’ll call you later.” He ripped the phone away from his ear and then pressed end-call, tossing the phone onto the coffee table. Steve, who’d been listening in to the conversation they’d been having and managing to piece together most of what was going on, simply took in a deep breath.
Tony didn’t want to open his eyes. He didn’t trust himself to see what was actually in front of him if he did. And on any other occasion, he would rather have died a thousand fiery deaths than ever try and let Steve coddle him when he was like this- he was a capable hero and absolutely able to deal with this all on his own, thank you very much- but now wasn’t any other occasion. Steve was already in here with him, and Tony… Tony trusted him, dammit. He’d be useful. He wasn’t going to hurt Tony, and so Tony couldn’t quite find it in him to say no.
Steve made a face, finally looking down at the sidewalk. He made a humming noise, and after a few seconds of silence, jerked his head over to the house. “I should probably…”
Tony nodded, turning back to their wardrobe. He still hadn’t picked out a belt. “Busy day,” he said lightly, “people to meet, products to launch, casual homophobia to deflect, you know that drill. Do we have Avengers Training today?” He turned back to look at Steve, now sat up on the bed fully, his feet planted on the wooden floorboards. He was looking at Tony with a small frown.
There was a nudge against his mouth, and someone— Natasha, maybe—placed the rim of something against his bottom lip. Cool water trickled onto his tongue, and he drank gratefully, hearing her talk to him in soft Russian, a hand running back through his hair. She looked at him, and then glanced down to the watch on her wrist and smiled. “Two minutes ‘til Christmas,” she informed him, shuffling until her back was pressed up against the wall.
Steve turned away and followed his friends, heart up in his throat as he pushed through the crowds in order to catch up with them. By that point, the teachers had finally seemed to catch up with what was happening, and he could see a few feet away as Principal Fury himself marched down the corridors and grabbed Tony by the arm, pulling him out of the area as he yelled at the other teachers to go check on Tiberius. Tony swore at him viciously and shoved his hand away, but followed him a second later all the same. He turned his head, looking through the crowds for a second in searching, and Steve tried to push through and make himself seen, but before he got the chance Tony had disappeared around the corner, heading into what was undoubtedly the Principal’s office.
Tony looked at him for a moment, before making a face. “Uh, maybe something to do with the fact that he immediately tried to start a fight with me after I drove you home and told me to stay away from you on pain of death? And you told me you loved him?”
Tony looked down to where their hands were connected, before smiling a little. “Don’t you find it remarkable, just how similar our stories are?” He mumbled, mouth forming the word ‘destined’ without ever actually adding sound to it.
It was perfect and thoughtful and by the time he got around to Steve’s envelope, he was already feeling pretty emotional.
“You know what I mean.” Tony rolled his eyes and ducked his forehead into Steve’s neck, kissing him softly as he wrapped his arms around those wonderfully muscular shoulders underneath him. “It’s a great excuse to cuddle and make-out with each other. Gets the adrenaline pumping and all that.” He pulled back a fraction and looked at Steve hopefully. “I usually watch them with DUM-E, but he can’t fight off monsters or ghosts as well as you could, so I don’t feel quite so soothed.”
Steve just smiled and nodded along, listening as Tony explained how stars were made and something about dark matter. Steve didn’t really follow it. He was more interested in how Tony’s hands moved, and the way the moonlight illuminated each curve and crease in Tony’s face, and the fact that he hadn’t thought about bombs even
A second later, and he was looking at the separate parts and mechanics of the Iron Man suit. From a scientific point of view, he saw how it all worked, and as he pushed through the horrible throb at the back of his eyes, he almost managed to piece a few of the bits of information together. But as soon as he looked away and attempted to remember it, the knowledge slipped away. He cursed loudly and then looked back, starting again.
Steve stayed. With Tony Stark, of all people. Director Fury sure had been surprised when Steve had informed him that he would no longer be requiring his SHIELD barracks, because he was living with the same guy he’d been spitting at not only a few weeks ago.
He towelled himself off and then wrapped the fabric around his waist, grabbing his toothbrush from the sink and running it under the faucet. His reflection stared at him as he brushed his teeth, and he couldn’t help but curiously run his fingers over the faint lightning-strike pattern that had raised itself up onto his skin, running from his wrist all the way up to his shoulder. The Doctor called them Lichtenberg Figures, and they were usually found on folk who got struck by lightning. Steve figured they’d probably go down soon as his body healed, but until then, he had to admit that they were pretty cool to look at.
It stopped about twenty feet away from the edge of the compound, hovering in the air for a moment, bright enough that Steve could hardly even see a thing. He lifted his hand to shield himself from the light, but a moment later it dimmed back, revealed something…
“No, Thor and Natasha ruined a mannequin mountain before we could do any actual shopping and we all got kicked out,” Peggy told him, fiddling with the dials on his dash, “does this piece of shite not even have any heating?”
Tony looked up, blinked a few times, and then looked back down again. But still, the empty screen stared back at him. “JARVIS?” He murmured, “is my phone malfunctioning?”
All of these things went around and around in Steve’s head as they flew back to the East coast, and continued to do so on an endless loop right until they touched down. It was easier that way. He couldn’t let his mind stay blank; it was a skill he’d never been able to master, much to Natasha’s despair. But he could distract himself. Think about wall panelling and chest infections and Agent Leonards’ home life so that he didn’t have to think about the man he’d just heartlessly betrayed sitting in a cell a few floors beneath him. It was like the stupid grandfather’s clock in Fury’s office all over again. Anything to take his mind off what was really going on in front of him.
“Come on Steve, before the sun sets completely,” Tony’s eyes crinkled at the edges as he smiled and tugged Steve further out, walking backward in order to face him. Steve let himself be led, and then held out a hand for the helmet as Tony threw it his way and slipped his own on.
“I swear, Cap, if you make me run through this exercise again I’m gonna fucking lose it.” Natasha pointed a threatening finger toward Steve on the other side of the large room, red hair falling in damp strands as she caught her breath. Tony had to agree with her sentiment. People might have thought that the armour helped him conserve his own strength, but the metal got goddamn
“Hey, whoah, I can totally still make traps!” Tony tried to sit up again, but he moved too fast and suddenly everything was spinning, pain erupting in his leg and forcing a gasp from his throat. He felt himself tumble sideways, body threating to spill right off the cot, but a pair of sturdy hands caught him and Rhodey held tight as he gently lay Tony back down.
Shaking his head softly, he focused back on the matter at hand, thinking through possibilities as they drove over to SHIELD headquarters. Would it be an extraction? A raid? Steve specialised in hand-to-hand, so it was probably not going to be anything covert, but you never knew. Spending time with SHIELD agents like Natasha Romanov had rubbed some things off on him, so maybe they thought he was capable enough now.
“When I said ‘you can’t make me’ it was not an invitation for you to try,” Tony grumbled as he nestled his head into Steve’s neck and frowned.
Steve looked at him somewhat suspiciously for a second, before reaching a hand out for the coffee. “Thanks,” he said, wrapping his fingers around the hot mug.
Steve bit his lip. Tony sounded too easy going, too nonchalant. Steve felt like he wasn’t being told something. “Please?” He asked again, “please, just tonight? To ease my own mind more than anything. I don’t… this was all my fault anyway, and I couldn’t stand the idea that-“
He feels like he’s doing nothing. Like he’s helpless. So one night of yet more insomnia, he decides to put the ball on his side of the court.
This time it was him who found himself being shut up, and it was quite possibly the first time in his life in which he was happy about someone cutting him off mid-sentence, because it meant more Steve-kisses, and in the space of roughly 1.2 minutes, Steve-Kisses had managed to become his most enjoyable practice in the world. Which was saying something.
Steve looked at him, unimpressed. “If you think I’m just gonna stand around and let him treat me like shit until he eventually gets bored of doing that, you got another thing coming, buddy.”
Tony paused. He opened his mouth and then shut it again a second later. "Zeke's an ass," he said in the end, paired with an uncaring shrug, "and it was a while since I got in a fight."
Fuck, he’d probably gone too far. Sighing, he turned on his heel and walked back the way he’d come, glancing up to the street names as he did so. But none of them were particularly recognisable and he frowned deeply, wondering where the hell he must have turned.
Steve’s smile was soft, worn, a little sad, and he pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead before slipping away, heading off in the direction of the doors once more. “Think about it, okay?” He called out behind him, and then with one last glance in Tony’s direction, he wandered out of the workshop. Tony watched him jog up the stairs and disappear from sight.
What, did he think Tony was going to flinch or something? Fucking hell. “Just take the fucking shoe off, Steve. Please.”
Tony walked down the path, hands shoved in his pockets. Steve just watched from the door, noting every glance behind him Tony made until the moment he rounded the corner and disappeared from view completely.
By the end of the morning, there’s pages and pages of data- Clint’s triggers, his history, his likes and dislikes and his mental state- all cross-referenced with one another and neatly sorted into workable piles. He tells JARVIS to scan the work and track it with Clint’s behaviour; flagging him up in either amber for medium risk, or red for immediate.
He cursed quietly and sat up, running his hands through his hair. His clock read at 1:12am. It had been hours since he’d last seen Tony. Anything could have happened to him, and it’d be Steve’s fault. And he could try and say that he was a terrorist, that he’d killed innocent people, but the crux of the matter was that he just didn’t believe that any more. Somewhere along the line, his mind had changed.
“Nice day for it,” someone muttered by Steve’s right, and he felt the movement in the air as someone came to sit by his side amongst the rubble.
“Oh, great timing, Stark, you might just get in for the credits if you’re lucky,” Clint called out to him, chucking a peanut across the room as Tony wandered further in.
“Does that mean we’re going to get to go to a wedding?” Thor asked in delight, bouncing up and down on his heels like an excited puppy. “I’ve never been to a Midgardian wedding before!”
He tilted his head up, fingers curling around Tony’s jaw, and then after a beat of stillness, he leaned in and slotted their mouths together. It was messy, awkward for a second until Tony slanted his head and then—then it was just like nothing was wrong any more. Like everything else had melted away, and there was just Tony. Kissing him, holding him like he had before it had all fallen apart. The butterflies exploded through his chest, beat at his ribcage. He felt his hands move of their own volition, desperate to try and relearn every inch of the man's body, and up against him, Tony shuddered into his touch.
He looked away and swallowed down the nausea, and instead just gently helped Tony back toward the compound. Tony was home. That was all that mattered.
“Pepper might disembowel me, but sure.” He shook his head and then laughed once more, dipping forward and kissing Steve again, his face freezing against Steve’s. They’d been walking through the city for nearly an hour, window shopping for gifts they were going to buy for Christmas, but now Tony was due for a business trip and Steve had to go back to the tower alone. Excursions abroad for StarkIndustries business weren’t that uncommon, although it had lessened over the last year or so as Tony stepped back further and further from the CEO elements and become more invested in R&D. Steve definitely preferred that. Not only did it make Tony happier, but it meant that he didn’t have to be on the other side of the world for extended periods of time.
to his wildly homophobic father in revenge, knowing exactly what would happen to Tony when he did!” Steve ground his teeth and looked the older man right in the eyes, ready to battle it out once more. “Is that good enough for you?” He asked, voice turning into a hiss.  “Does that make him worth your fucking sympathy now?”
“Nothing,” Steve shrugged him off viciously, turning away and hoisting his bag a little higher on his shoulder. “Nothing, Clint, just… just leave it, alright, I have to get to class.”
“No.” That was Natasha who spoke, walking into his line of vision and then sitting down on the cot beside Bruce. She lifted a hand and settled it in Tony’s hair immediately, then began stroking her fingers delicately from forehead to crown. It felt nice. A wonderful contrast to everything else his body was experiencing. “There’s no signal, and the storm has started up again. Rhodey’s patrolling the cabin in case of another HYDRA attack, which is likely, seeing as they came far more prepared than we did.”
Like he could sense it—which, thanks to Steve’s rather uncanny ability to smell emotions, was probably the case—Steve paused, pulling away and looking down at Tony. “You’re nervous,” he said with a small frown, brushing his thumb over Tony’s lip, “what’re you nervous about, huh?”
“Apologies. But if you could stay within the mansion until Sir arrives back, I’m sure he would greatly—”
Tony made another pained sound as Steve coughed on another sob, and his fingers gently stroked down Steve’s cheeks, wiping the tears from his face and smiling. “See, Steve- the great thing is- the people who mean the most to you?”
Stepping tentatively around the car as Bucky grinned through the window at him, he wrapped his hand around the handle and tugged. Then tugged harder when the metal refused to move. Finally, it let him in with a worrying groan, and he frowned deeply as he lowered himself in.
. “I hate Christmas,” he hissed, feeling the back of his head hit the pillow, “I fucking hate Christmas, I hate—”
. Steve would rather die than hurt him. He wouldn’t be prepared for HYDRA like Bucky was, he wouldn’t know that it was Steve who was the threat, not until it was far too late.
They sat there in quiet for a few minutes, shivering in the cold but warmed by one another’s presence as they all huddled together. Tony wanted to say something about how he was glad that he had them, not just in this situation—although God knows he was, they’d saved his life ten times over today—but in general, too. He’d hated Christmas for as long as he’d been alive, but these last few years when it’d been spent with them, he could finally understand what everyone had been going on about when they said that the Christmas period was the best time of the year. Turned out, it was more about who you spent it with than what you did. Who’d have thought?
“We can’t deal with it any more!" Bruce admitted, running a hand through his hair, and then looking down to his sheet. “It was okay at first. When you first got hitched, we were willing to let it slide. it would only be when you two were caught up in each other, and that was
A hand landed softly on his shoulder, and Steve jerked his head up to see Thor staring solemnly down at him. “We need to head back down to the hotel and call for help,” he declared, “we cannot get any signal here, and if we leave it too long, we put Tony’s life at risk.”
He tapped his hand rapidly against the hard surface of his phone and then took another breath. Fine, it was fine, he was just antsy. Nothing would happen. The likelihood was slim to none, and he knew that. He knew the math, the statistics. He just wished his brain would fucking listen to them for once.
“I never thought I’d be able to feel things again after my mom passed away,” he murmured, thumb brushing delicately across the back of Tony's ear, feeling the raised edges of the small scars there, “not properly, anyway. I felt like I was doing everything on autopilot. She’d gone, and I couldn’t find much in anything after that. Things just sort of existed around me.”
Steve jerked to a stop, taking a deep breath. He’d already got a warning that very day for fighting- he wasn’t going to start again. So instead he just turned around and glared at them as they raised their eyebrows at him. He couldn’t put a name to either of them- they weren’t relevant to him in any way- but if he were to guess, it would probably be something like Troy. Or Chad. Or Jace. Or perhaps an obscure one, like Twist or some shit-
On the surface, nothing seemed wrong. Steve was fine. A little ragged, maybe, but fine. He acted in the same way, smiled at Tony no differently, scolded Clint no less.
“JARVIS,” he called, shoving Steve off him and then blasting a safe distance away, watching Steve pursue him like a predator would its pray. Tony mentally calculated the height of the roof, wondering whether Steve could jump up and grab him if he just flew to the top. Possibly. “What can we incapacitate him with?”
That’s how he’d put it to Steve, after they’d left the underground levels and sat back in Fury’s office. Steve was probably lucky to even keep his job at all. Being emotionally compromised- especially toward someone as dangerous as Iron Man- was something that really should have cost him his position. It was probably only thanks to the fact Iron Man was in their custody because of him that he’d managed to get away with an extended period of leave and not a sacking.
“Then why are you here?” He asked again, glancing over at the Pepper girl who was still stood outside the door and looking at him with an observant gaze. Because he was polite, he opened the door a little and made a notion with his hand, gesturing her in. She smiled briefly and then stepped inside, her heels clacking on the tile and emphasizing just how much taller than Steve she was.
Tony blinked, looking behind him and then turning to the rest of the room, where the remaining conscious friends were all sat. “Has he seriously just fallen unconscious on my ass?” He asked with a wave.
Steve had watched as Tony focused in on a group of people to their left- five of them, altogether, and not any more than a few years older than him- and then felt with surprise as Tony snatched his hand back and pushed Steve out of his space hurriedly, landing him a solid and safe two feet away.
Steve pushed through the crowds that had moved on, cutting him off in order to horde around the two other boys that now seemed to be about to scrap. He felt either Sam or Clint’s hand try to pull him back but he shoved them off, ducking under arms and then pushing people off before he joined the circle again, hand reaching out to grab Tony’s shoulder.
“Steve?” Sam prodded him with his elbow gently, and when he looked up, Sam was shaking his head a little, “Word of advice. Don’t get involved with the ones like him. All of them are just… they’re not the type of people you’d wanna be associating with. You’ll end up with a criminal record by the end of the week. And if you get on the wrong side of them, they’d tear you apart. People like Tony Stark are not there to make friends with.”
Bucky didn’t say anything; just stared at him in shock as he passed through the door. Then his head jerked back to where Tony was sat at the bottom of the little driveway, and a truly foul stream of curses fell from his mouth as he raised a finger and pointed it accusingly at Tony. “Oh, boy, you are
“Is this a gentler way of you telling me to listen to you in the field?” Tony asked, settling down into Steve’s hold and tucking his chin against the meat of Steve’s shoulder, “because honestly, I’m liking it better than the yelling.”
The woman drew closer, and Steve didn’t know her name, but he knew her face. Knew from before he’d even arrived here- she was one of HYDRA’s enhanced. Stronger, quicker, fitter than the average human. Not at his level, but Steve knew it was what they were working up to. And until then, she was obviously just being used as an interrogator. Which she seemed to be enjoying, by the looks of it.
Of course, he only got about five seconds into the hall before he heard angry shouting start up in the room he’d just left- not even the friendly kind of angry, the
Tony looked at him. Then he grinned, and just for the hell of it, he kissed Steve again. “No promises, sweetheart.”
Steve stood in the empty hallway for a long time after that, before nodding his head and turning on his heel. The weight inside his chest dragged him down like an iron weight with every step forward.
“What happened to her?” Tony asked, voice gentle, and they were still standing together on the middle of the pavement, which felt weird- felt like they needed a more serious setting to have this conversation, yet here they both were.
“That’s not the fucking point,” Tony hissed, hands balling into fists, “it doesn’t matter, I still flipped my shit at something ridiculous and I just – I just want to say that it won’t affect-“
“You’ve been looking after me ever since I turned up here, actually,” Steve said before he could stop himself, and when Tony glanced up at him with a raised eyebrow, Steve hastened to continue. “You said- about not starting to look after me yet, but… but you have. For ages. With the party and the ride and- and stuff. I- I’m not sure why I said that? I just- yeah. I… yeah.”
“Nice ride, Rogers!” Someone yelled over the parking lot, and he turned curiously, noting Ty lounging against his own expensive Audi with a group of his friends and smiling sharply over to Steve.
Dad raised an eyebrow, taking a sip from his coffee and watching Peter with a look on his face. Peter just sighed. He knew what was coming.
A hand came to settle in his hair as Steve moved forward, and Tony subtly switched the tablet off and placed it on his lap. “I was saying that you told me you’d never climbed a tree before, right?” Steve said. “Well, I think that today’s the day you should tick it off your bucketlist. There’s a lovely oak tree just at the perimeter of the field, and if you poke your head out of the top of canopy you can see the whole valley as the sun sets around it.”
, he could do what he wanted obviously, and they were just talking. But that was pushed aside very briefly for the rather… less sophisticated side of him. This guy was kind of an immature dick, and he didn’t share.
He waved awkwardly at Bucky as the boy pulled up, open-mouthed and staring at him through the window. “Hey,” he muttered.
“I don’t think any of that, don’t be stupid,” Steve rolled his eyes fondly and smoothed his hand over Tony’s collar, “I just want you to try and help yourself, that’s all. Maybe think about seeing a therapist again. They could help sort through everything. Help you.”
She wiggled her eyebrows and then laughed, smiling her lovely smile as she jumped up and down next to him. “He kissed you!” She said with a squeal, and Steve felt the infectious excitement buzz inside him as he joined her in jumping around the room.
Wheezing in audible terror, Steve gauged how far away Tony was. “Oh god, okay- Tony! Tony, sweetheart, just hold on, okay, hold on, I’ve got you, I won’t let you fall, I won’t, I swear-”
“It’s fine,” he’d whispered, shaking his head in assurance, “I promise, Tony, it’s just my shitty head that blew it all up out of proportion. You don’t have to do this.”
Of course Steve didn’t mean it like that. God, he’d only been awake thirty seconds and he was already fucking everything up. “I think the God-damn world of you,” he answered throatily, head shaking back and forth, “you risk your life out there, doing the right thing even when you have the whole world not believing in you. You didn’t even hesitate to let me back into your life when I needed your help, even after the way I treated you before we split—”
Bucky sat back, lacing his fingers together and propping his feet on the bed. He looked so calm, so collected; but all Steve could see was the version of him that was seventy years younger, screaming in terror as he fell from the train-
“I’m sorry,” Steve said again after a while, shaking his head and pulling away, looking at the floor, “I… for everything.”
Sighing, he walked a little faster down the artificially lit streets, turning the corner and then spotting Farborough Street at the bottom of the road.
“There we go,” he whispered to no-one, to nothing, his smile tasting salty on his lips, “that’s better, ain’t it, ma?”
Of course, that being said, there wasn’t a force on heaven or earth that would stop him now. Tony needed someone. Tony needed someone to look out for him. And Steve might be 5’4 and weigh about the size of a small puppy soaking wet, but damned if that was going to stop him stepping up to the role.
“So we were like- what do you do for a guy who has everything?” Clint cut in theatrically, before whipping an envelope out of his pocket and grinning. “Why, you do him favours, of course.”
“Yeah yeah, whatever, glad you’re here etcetera, now can you be here quietly? Steve muttered, flopping back into the pillow and curling in around the bedsheets, “I don’t want to have to kill you just after sleeping with you. That would be really impolite.”
“Anthony- you’re gonna go out there, an’ you’re gonna do what I fuckin’ tell you, understand me?” Howard asked, his voice low and so full of venom that it actually took Steve back a little, “you can just ad-lib it. You think you’re so fuckin’ smart anyways, might as well prove it. But lemm’e tell you… this deal better go right, or I’m gonna fuckin’ kill ya’.”
Fury’s face didn’t change even when Steve waited a few more seconds, and his silence sat heavily in the office. Iron Man had been a thorn in SHIELD’s side for damn near a year now, blowing up government facilities, stealing classified information and weapons to use for god knows what, stirring up trouble by inciting rumours about SHIELD & the US army and then leaking them to the public. There had been no official deaths yet, not as far as the general public knew anyway—but pretty much everyone in the government was aware that Iron Man had been the one behind the tragedy in Gulmira which has kickstarted that sick bastard’s little career, and once he got bored of blowing up empty buildings on US soil, it was only a matter of time before Iron Man started getting people killed over here too. Hell, he’d already cost near billions in property damage and put multiple men and women out of jobs. He was a nightmare and a menace, seemingly determined to bring the government down to its knees, and Steve knew damn well that if he ever got what he was after, it wouldn’t be long before they had a new totalitarian rule on their hands.
“Oh, I understand plenty,” Cass told him with a sickly smile, and Tony was going to throw up, his heart was going to stop, Steve was holding onto his arm so he wouldn’t step forward and get obliterated by the energy field but Tony was pushing against him blindly, unable to just stand there and do nothing as the team of mercenaries slowly backed off, sealing their fate without a second thought. “I understand that at the end of this, we’re all gonna be 40-thousand dollars richer, and you’re gonna be pretty fucking embarrassed. That’s good enough for me.”
“Widow, Hawkeye, let them through to the basement,” Steve said suddenly, stepping over another body with a wince. Tony spotted movement through one of the doors and quickly took point in front of Steve, hands raised defensively. “Fighting Enhanced in a small space when all you have are scientists and agents with minimal training is gonna end in a bloodbath. Tell them all to retreat.”
give me permission to threaten him with death if he hurts you, seeing as you just moved up a stage in your relationship and I’m allowed to interfere again.”
“Tony?” Steve turned to him, looking in concern as Tony stood abruptly from the table, trying not to sway when his vision went blurry for a moment. He was so fucking tired. His head hurt from thinking about the Goddamned armour too much.
“Tony,” Steve pulled away and settled his hand across Tony’s cheek, “I don’t give a single shit. I’m incredibly angry at the person who did it, and they’re going to pay for it, but I promise, I am not upset with you.” He pulled Tony in again, fingers stroking across Tony’s jaw and into his hair as Tony just sagged into him. He was so, so tired.
Steve watched Tony fall; slamming into the remnants of the ship, hands flailing wildly for purchase as the floor fell apart around him.
“Race you there,” he said to her, and then flexed his palms and shot off into the Swiss sky without another word. In his mind, he saw the blank screen of his phone, the lack of a heartbeat that should have been there.
“Well, we’re fighting for the same cause then, pal,” Steve responded, finally letting his shoulders relax a little as the tension began to drain from the room, “I understand. I mean, I’d have appreciated if you could have left it a little later, and maybe not acted so… intimidating, but-“
They called Clint and Natasha in, which took a bit of wrangling, but eventually they were all in the kitchen. Clint looked wary again, hands working nervously against his legs. “So,” he began, “not mine, right?”
Fuck. He’d definitely overreacted there. Tony wasn’t… he wouldn’t be ashamed of Steve. That just wasn’t the type of person Tony was. Steve knew that; of course he fucking did, and he’d gone and abandoned Tony in the middle of their date anyway. Because he was a selfish asshole like that, obviously.
Steve grinned down at his phone and then looked back up, trying to focus back in on class. Truthfully, he wasn’t actually going to think about it- there wasn’t a hope in hell he’d get anything out of it, and so what was the point, really? He wasn’t good enough. He could accept that.
JARVIS was quiet as he ran through numbers, variables, outcomes. His program told him that Steve was trustworthy. His code allowed him to see how the variable of Tony’s death may skew that. His judgment allowed him to decide on which was the stronger motivator.
Steve could admit, he made a pleased sort of sound in the back of his throat at that. He was pretty sure he was going to love retelling it almost as much as he’d loved living through it. “Sure will,” he said, giving her another hug. She returned it with enthusiasm before kissing him on the cheek and then wiping away the little lipstick stain.
them. That’s why I flew over there. They… it was my first flight out as Iron Man. I saw them on the news. The Ten Rings. They were… they had
“I am so sorry,” Tony was speaking before he even knew what he was going to say, the words tumbling out of his mouth like waterfalls, uncontained, “Steve, I never meant… I phrased my words in a shitty way, and I didn’t listen to what you were trying to tell me because I was being jerk, and I get it now, I do, and I- I swear, I won’t ever bring it up again. I’ve thrown all my Halloween junk out. I don’t want to celebrate it if it upsets you and I
There were muffled sounds on the other end of the line, and then whispering voices. Steve just made a face and then rolled his eyes, until another voice came up on the line a few moments later. Steve recognised this one.
That day was no different. Steve still had a good forty minutes before his bus came, so he was absolutely fine with getting comfortable on the bench and pulling out his sketchbook from the folds of his bag.
truth to Tony’s words. Stark Industries really had been double dealing without Tony’s knowledge. But that didn’t… that didn’t change the rest of it. The village—Gulmira— that had been totally wiped off the map by Iron Man. The attacks on SHIELD facilities; targeted hits to information banks that held classified and crucial data. Tony had still done that, which didn’t match to his weapons-collecting agenda he’d been talking of.
Pulling out his own phone and running a hand anxiously through his hair, he pulled up Tony’s contact and began to text out a message, deleting and retyping a few times before eventually coming up with the final piece.
He blinked, and then turned away hurriedly before he could become too invested in observing Peter. His hands flexed, unused to seeing the little boy and not ending up with him in his arms. He tamped down the urge. “Maybe next time you’ll listen when we tell you that he needs to keep to his routine,” he told Thor, tugging at the blanket around the man’s head before starting to walk back over to the kitchen. “Want me to make you a coffee?”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, even though it really hurt. “Yeah, really,” he said, “I guess I was kind of exaggerating how terribly evil you were in order to save myself from uh- going too far the other way.”
With a deep sigh, he turned around. Carol had said room eight. He assumed that was somewhere down the science corridor, which wasn’t so bad. Thirty seconds away, tops. In and out. Didn’t even have to look at him, if he didn’t want to.
“Even that feels too kind,” Steve muttered, voice twisting in disgust, “too merciful, after what they did to him.”
“Thank you for coming, by the way,” Steve told him quietly, “I know you probably could’ve been doing a ton of more interesting things.”
Deep down, Tony knew he was right. Steve was good at this; the tactical evaluation, the cold hard facts and logic as opposed to Tony’s emotionally driven responses. It was why they complemented one another so well on the field- Tony was the heart and Steve was the head. And where Tony would cling on to this, desperate to try and have Steve as close as possible and try and just pretend none of this shit had ever happened, Steve looked at it logically. Steve knew that it
After going back to bed and then spending an hour or so lazily making love to one another, they’d whiled away a good few hours afterward simply lounging around in their room, watching episode after episode of New Girl (Tony’s choice, not Steve’s) and curled into one another. He could count the amount of times they’d been able to sleep in late together on one hand, and so Steve let himself revel in the simplicity of it; let his arms lay across Tony’s body in a comforting embrace and his head dip low, relearning all the parts of Tony that he’d been remiss about- the parts his mouth never usually touched. Tony always laughed at him when he did it; when he rolled Tony over so he was lying on his stomach and then traced each bump of the other man’s spine with his lips. It was simple, but it felt intimate. Steve loved learning and relearning him. It felt like a ritual that wouldn’t ever get old.
He shut his eyes again, concentrating on the noise of Tony’s heart and the gentle beat of a pulse against his thumb as it settled against Tony’s wrist. The dream was nothing but a distant memory. It was fine. Tony was fine. All he could hear was the sound of his lover’s beating heart, not his screaming voice. Not any more.
Below him, he felt Tony shiver. “Oh my fucking god,” he blurted quietly, “Jesus fucking Christ that was hot.
Steve sighed, turning back to Thor. “Alright, alright, let’s go.” He crouched down and got eye-level with Peter. “Behave yourself,” he told the boy solemnly, while Peter leaned forward and then grabbed his nose with a podgy fist. Steve huffed, tugging Peter’s hand away gently before ducking down and pressing a kiss to his soft head. Tony watched the interaction with a bitten-down smile, then pulled Steve off in the direction of the elevator.
Steve hummed, seemingly satisfied with the answer. He scuffed his foot back and forth along the bath-mat absently while Tony got himself sorted, occasionally sparing quick glances his way with a small smile on his face. Tony knew what he was thinking, and it made him roll his eyes fondly. “Really that desperate?” He asked. “I’m shaving, Steve, it’s hardly pornographic.”
They stopped at a roadside diner for more food along the way, stocking up on snacks while Tony dressed Steve up in a pair of ridiculously big sunglasses and an obnoxious baseball cap in order to help him blend in. No one noticed them, thankfully- or at least, if they did, they didn’t care enough to comment, and once their pancakes had been scoffed down they were back on the road again, bickering about the quickest way to reach the town where they were supposed to be staying. Steve called Tony names while his hand held onto the other man’s thigh, and Tony swore he regretted ever agreeing to the trip while he rested his fingers over Steve’s knuckles and drew absent patterns against the skin there.
He blinked once, and then nodded. “I- yeah,” he breathed, walking forward a few more paces until he was stood next to Tony’s side, “so this is where all the genius stuff happens, huh?”
Tony laughs, and it tastes bitter in his throat. “You don’t care about me. Not really. I don’t know how to love people. Dunno how to even tell someone I… I…” and he can’t even
“Who were they?” Steve blurted, the words falling out of his mouth before he could help himself. When Tony looked at him in confusion, Steve awkwardly waved a hand. “The people in the video. Do you remember them?”
The next morning was better. Not quite as oppressive. It was a relief, honestly- sometimes those episodes lasted for days.
He stopped, turning around again and looking over to Tony. There was a sad smile on his face, and when he looked at Steve, there was so much behind those eyes, even if it was only fleeting.
Tony laughed, but this one was harsh. Steve had heard it only a handful of times before. “Howard Stark doesn’t give a single shit about anyone but himself,” he spat, the slur of his words, the drunken rage only adding to his feeling, “the last half a fuck he gave died with Mom, and I was left with the weight of all his focus, all his goddamned anger- what was a fourteen-fucking-year old kid supposed to do with the weight of all that blame? ‘Cause he did- he blamed me,” Tony giggled, shaking his head and sighing like he’d heard a good joke- and Steve didn’t know why he did that, why he kept bursting out into laughter, but maybe that was just the way Tony dealt with things. Or maybe he just found a sort of morbid amusement to all of it.
“JARVIS, does this thing have weapons?” Steve asked briskly, searching the dash for anything that could cause some damage.
“Misunderstood?” Sam raised a hand to his heart and fluttered his eyelashes dramatically. Steve kicked his leg under the table, and he coughed a bit, before looking over to his mom placatingly. “Don’t worry, Mom, he’s not so tough really. Or at least, he’s got a hell of a soft spot for Steve.”
Tony was angry. Rightfully so. Steve remembered back in 2015, the first time Tony had told them all that this would happen. The previous mission had made him erratic, scared, frightened enough that he’d made some stupid calls. Steve had been so angry that Tony hadn’t just talked to him about it first, and Tony had desperately tried to tell him that he was doing it for them, for the greater good. Steve had just thought Tony was afraid, and acting irrationally because of it. He hadn’t listened.
Tony grunted, flexing his hand and wincing. He should have kept the ice-pack on. He really hated when Steve was right about things.
Bucky looked at him like he knew everything Steve was thinking- or at least, the self deprecating parts anyway. He was uncannily good at that sort of thing, and Steve had very often received smacks around the head because of his mind-reading abilities.
“Well then you can take Mr Compulsive Liar.” She rolled her eyes and flicked her hair off her shoulders, holding back a sigh. “I’d say next time we make Clint and Bruce do this, but then we’d probably end up with a national incident on our hands, and I really don’t have time for that.”
be close, he couldn’t, he had no idea whether HYDRA had got to him, Tony was in danger, in danger from
He felt strong hands curl around his biceps, the fingers splaying over his back. He looked up as Steve knocked their foreheads together. “Breathe,” the man whispered softly, “breathe, relax, just think. We’re going to get to him. It’s going to be okay. Just breathe.”
For a moment, it seemed like time slowed, crawled entirely to a stop. Steve’s mind attempted to wrap itself around that statement, but it couldn’t quite find the right footholds and the meaning behind it kept slipping away. Tony couldn’t be serious. He was talking like there was still hope, and there wasn’t. There couldn’t be.
Eventually, Steve stepped back. Tony plucked up the courage and stared at him, feeling blood trickle down the side of his face. His ears were ringing and his whole body felt like it was burning, too hot and too cold at the same time.
Tony just nodded calmly. He didn’t say anything else, just squeezed Steve’s hand a bit and then looked back out toward the sea. Feeling like he could barely even breathe any more, Steve dialed his answering machine and then slid the phone up to his ear.
that the SUV had blown. That Tony’s whole life had crumbled around him and then been rebuilt from the ashes. This day three years ago had changed Tony’s life forever.
“You’re a menace,” Steve informed him after he’d opened the window to blow out some of the smoke, “please never try and cook your own meals. You’ll burn your house down.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “He’ll come down when he’s good and ready. Just give him a distraction or something, I dunno.” Peter’s head turned to look at Tony, and Tony couldn’t resist pulling a face at the kid, watching with a grin as the boy cackled in a way that only babies ever did- loud and carefree and without a single weight upon his tiny little shoulders.
“You’re so weird,” Tony said, before kicking off the brake and revving the engine. Steve cackled, feeling the pull in his stomach as Tony drove out of the parking lot with his engine growling loudly.
Steve glared, but after a moment it softened a little. Bucky was only trying to look out for him in his own stupid way. “I don’t even know him that well, Bucky- he was just kind to me. That’s all.”
He gripped Tony tighter. Looked down at his lover, who gazed back at him, empty. His soul had gone elsewhere, to a place Steve couldn’t pull him from. His body, underneath Steve, was still warm. Of course it would be warm. Steve had made sure he wrapped up properly before they went out—Tony got sick easily and Steve didn’t want him to have a cold over the Christmas period. It always made him grouchy.
He’d told Steve that he was sure Howard wouldn’t find out, but he’d lied. He’d lied so Steve wouldn’t stop him from going home and rescuing the oldest friend had had from within the mansion walls.
you- but whatever it was, Steve, you need to clue me the fuck in, because I’m stood here and I assure you I’m not dropping this until you-”
Steve simply gawped at him. He wasn’t sure what else to do. Tony… Tony had really meant that. Steve knew when Tony was just blabbering for the sake of filling a room with noise and when he was telling the full, earnest truth. It was always in his eyes. The sincerity. The raw soul of him. And that was here, now, as Tony kept his hands curled firmly around Steve’s and he nibbled at his lip.
get in the trash!” Tony yanked the janitor’s cap off Steve’s head and then stuck it on his own. “I’ll be the janitor, you get in the wheelie-bin.”
Steve chuckled, tilting his head and kissing lightly across the underside of Tony’s jaw. “You mean the world-famous Museum of Modern Art? That one?”
