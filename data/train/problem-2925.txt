“Stop. No one lays a finger on this sweet little boy. Sam, I see you got the snack I sent you,” the old man says, most of the sentence incomprehensible.
“What?” the young man asks.
“Shit,” he muttered. He sighed. There was nothing worse than finally letting your muscles relax, finally letting your bones sink into a mattress, and then realizing you’d forgotten to grab something.
Dean toed off his shoes and dug into his duffel bag for his toothbrush, locking himself in the bathroom before Cas could say anything more. In the mirror above the soap scum sink, his cheeks were mottled red. It almost blended in with his sunburn—the blood in his cheeks. Thankfully.
“You know you’re a good man,” Benny said. Dean took a shaky breath and set down his beer. Why did everyone seem to think that he needed a pep talk? He could count on one hand the number of people he knew well that
“I don’t—”
“Man, I don’t—”
The bunker, which never quite seemed to be silent, had a quiet hum to it that was like a roar in Dean’s ears, a mocking, empty sound buzzing in his head. His footsteps echoed against the tiled hallway, his footfalls slowly growing faster.
The sales associate presses a button on one of the screens and it freezes on a screen. She continues to push it, and eventually channel 3 appears on every screen, Dean's face multiplied across the wall.
“What are you doing here?” Dean said slowly.
Dean blinked.
about finding something like this, after so long, in a place like this.
The door jingles and Castiel drops behind the counter, wondering why he feels hungry. He never feels hungry, only ever occasionally bored enough to eat. A tray full of ground beef, waiting to be cooked, beckons from the counter and Castiel slides it down to himself, quietly gorging himself. He ought to leave, of course, but he's so hungry...and curious. There are quiet footsteps behind Castiel, in the kitchen, and he hears several thumps and a gun's click before two of the suited men walk by, dragging a third men into the main area.
“What’s wrong with the spell?” Charlie asked. “There’s something you’re not telling us, isn’t there?”
you, right?”
Dean sighed, but let it rest. Fine. Fine. If Cas wanted to be stubborn about this of all things, then fine. Of course he would be unyielding and resistant when it came to leaving, when it came to not being here.
Cas’s voice was a little too innocent, and Dean took a deep, deep breath.
“Were you saying something?” Sam whispered.
Sam looked nervous. Like Dean might storm off. But there was something bright and shimmery where Dean might’ve expected to find betrayal. Where Sam clearly expected there to be anger.
“Fuck off,” Dean said. He forced himself to move and reached for Benny, grabbing him by his broad, heavy shoulders and pulling him back to him. He pulled with too much force, and he stumbled back, pulling Benny along with him until his back hit a wall. It was—it wasn’t quite—something wasn’t right, but something heavy and magnetic was sinking down in his chest, pulling at him, tugging, settling in.
“Glad you didn’t,” Dean said.
When Dean walked over to their picnic table with a tray of pie and set it down in front of Sam and Eileen, he couldn’t help but let out a slight sigh. Both of them looked borderline panicked, watching him with wide eyes like they expected him to combust.
He decides to change clothes again- he realizes that his suit has a small bit of meat stuck to the lapel, not to mention the gash over his heart, so he puts on a pullover and a pair of jeans he snagged back in 1975.
“Cas, I know you like to not tell me fucking anything, but you need to tell me the truth. Did you bring Benny back to try and...replace you? Try and shuffle me off onto someone else? Try and…
” Dean said. Cas blinked, and Dean shook his head with a grin.
Dean couldn’t help the way it sounded like an accusation. Sounded pitiful. Lonely.
“Did you just—”
“I said,
,” Charlie said, sounding relieved.
“As much as I appreciate this whole—” Dean waved his hands indistinctly. “Whole...protective parent routine, I’m the one who gets to be mad, not you. And I am. And I also think I get to decide for myself whether or not I forgive Cas.”
Dean huffed and shoved on his shoes. "Don't we have something important to do today, more important than this stupid conversation?"
“Jesus,” he muttered, sitting up and scrubbing at his eyes. Helen’s face flickered through his mind’s eye. She really was beautiful. But her eyes—blue, and dark blue at that—he couldn’t look at her and not...not…
“Your fault?” Jack asked. He frowned. “Dean, I know everything now. I know what happened. That wasn’t your fault.”
Dean flushed red; pulling his eyes from the mirror as his face flooded with heat.
His earliest memory is of standing in a dark woods, with no idea of how he arrived there. In the next moment the brief image of a waterfall flashed through his mind, and he was suddenly standing by one, the water flickering onto his cheeks. He had realized quickly that he could move through space, and it took him only a few destinations to realize that he was not bounded by time, either. He did not have memories, but the smallest echoes of images lingered in his mind, and those pushed him to move, to seek out the things that found shelter in his nearly empty mind.
“Or did you not want to sleep on this, and assumed I would make you, if I knew it was here?” Cas asked. He shook his head, dismissing that idea.
It was like weights slipped from Dean’s shoulders; ropes untwined from his heels. He stumbled forward, reaching for Cas with hands whose course felt as familiar as breathing. He clutched at Cas’s coat, breathing heavily.
Benny shrugged. “You’ve saved a lot of people already,” he said. “I’ve seen more hunters come through this place in a month than I’ve seen my whole life. You ever think about hanging it up, letting some of the younger ones do it?”
“Why,” he said, tossing the motel key onto the little dresser by the door. “So you can try it without having to commit?”
Sam found it a little strange that his brutish brother, who considered that kind of contact 'wimpy', would be leaning on the angel, but he didn't mention it. He simply returned to the motel room and waited for Dean to enter. Castiel hadn't noticed Sam in the parking lot, so it took a while, as Dean was a moderately heavy sleeper.
“We’re a good team, man,” Dean said the next morning as they climbed into the impala, cleaned off after showers at their motel and in blissfully un-bloodstained clothing.
“You’re holding everyone up,” Garth said. “It’s time.”
“You should be here,” he said. “Jack, too. I’m sure Sam would’ve made him ring bearer.”
“Who else is there?” Dean said feebly. He pushed himself to his feet and offered Charlie his hand. “Care for a dance?”
firsthand
Cas was sprawled across most of the bed, laid out on his stomach, holding a worn-out laminated brochure with a photo of a burger splashed across the front. His fingers of one hand braced the brochure open, the other hand busy propping his head up under his chin. His fingers played absently at the corner of the brochure where the lamination curled away from the paper and the soft, pulpy inside of the thick paper was torn, the paper split in two, pulled in both directions by the divided layers of lamination. His shirt was rucked up in the back; two dimples at the bottom of his spine standing out in the yellow motel room light; his spine a shadow carving up and under his shirt.
Castiel weaves in and out of Biggerson's for as long as he can stomach. Eventually, he finds himself wanting to take a break- not out of exhaustion but because of sheer boredom. Dean has not surfaced yet, so Castiel finds a slightly cleaner than usual Biggerson's and sits to actually eat.
There was a long pause before Cas spoke again, and Dean’s eyes were getting heavy.
Dean shoved the vamp away from himself and his hands flew to his side. There was pain, sharp, blindingly bright and unrelenting pain, and his hands came away silky with blood.
“Yeah, I—your girl pushed me out of the way of becoming a shish kebab,” Dean said, grinning at Eileen. “Hurts like a bitch.”
“You don’t get enough credit for being kind, Dean,” Cas said. Dean stopped, closed his eyes. Counted to three.
Charlie sighed. They both stared silently down at the table for a moment before Charlie let out a laugh.
“No, I was definitely not,” Dean says, rising. “What are you?”
“You’re not gonna leave again, are you?” Sam asked.
The call went dead before Dean could conjure up something to say to that. He took a deep breath. Sometimes...sometimes, Charlie was deeply exasperating. He’d said she was the little sister he’d never had, and sometimes she took that sentiment a little too far in the ‘annoying Dean’ department.
“Aw, you're so full of crap,” Dean replies.
“I thought you wanted space, Dean,” Cas said, pressing a hand to his brow. “You
“Yeah, I...I’m good,” Dean said. “Let’s go.”
When they climbed into their respective sides of the bed, Dean’s fingers had a warm, buzz to them, restless and wanting, but when his head settled into the pillow, the exhaustion sank into him faster.
“Why’d you even ask?” he said. “Obviously yes. It’s not like it’s my bunker, it’s ours.”
Dean frowned, glancing between the both of them.
There are loud footsteps coming towards him, and Castiel rises, wiping the residue of beef from his chin.
should go to bed.”
“Don’t lie to me,” Cas said, his chin tipping up slightly as he stared down his nose at Dean. “You think I can’t tell? You think I can’t
But he couldn’t not feel the tight panic that was working its way out of his chest and up his neck and clutching at his jaw and cheeks, standing in the middle of the bunker staring up at his brother.
“He looks different, is it really him?”
There was a pause. It probably was a weird thing to say, admittedly. But Dean didn’t feel like qualifying it. Maybe Thomas would assume he was in a cult or something.
"So?"
Cas lifted his head to look at him. “I think that’s fair,” he said.
“Just don’t do anything stupid in an effort to not feel something,” Charlie said.
He starts arriving in the bathrooms, deciding to stick with that for a few thousand. After a thousand of those he's halfway out of the stall when the door flies open and two people stumble in, arms grappling around each other, faces pressed close. Kissing. One, a man, pushes the woman he's with onto a sink counter, and Castiel chooses then to leave, knowing what is considered “private”.
used to try and tell him what was wrong with him, tell him he was empty inside or so fucked up that no one would ever love him. Was it that obvious? Were the cracks all the way through to the outside?
“Sorry,” he said.
” Dean said. “What are you expecting to find in there, loose change?”
He thought firmly, holding his fork more securely this time.
“What is it?” Cas asked.
But that was immaterial. His mouth was dry.
“Dean? What did they say about the room?”
Before Dean could step back and let Cas’s inevitable confusion and cautious rejection slap him across the face, Cas’s hands gripped back at him, and Dean stumbled slightly, dragged closer in, and Cas’s mouth opened slightly under his, searing and wet and overwhelming.
Cas smiled slightly. The sun wasn’t as bright as him; it sank into his skin and clung there like it didn’t know how to act around something like Cas.
A series of images of skin and taut longing flickered through Dean’s mind and he pressed his hands to his eyes.
“I have you,” Dean said honestly, cracking open a beer. “And everyone’s always coming through. It’s fine.”
Dean twisted, yanking away from Benny and turning towards the voice, his gun already out and pointed. At the door, up above them, standing there with his eyebrows raised and a bulging bag of fast food in his arms, was Sam.
He remembered lying on the floor, the clinking of beer bottles like ghostly chimes around him as he stirred and dragged himself upright. Saying something to Sam. He didn’t know what. There was nothing important to say.
Sam’s eyes slid to the empty field in front of them and the dumpsters behind them. He nodded.
“Yes,” the old man says. “I see. That's one deep dark nothing you've got there, Dean. Can't feel it, can you? Not food, nor drink, not even with sex?
She pursed her lips. “Twenty three is a double,” she said, pointing at the screen, not that Dean could see it.
“The week before you showed up I went on a hunt with this guy Paul,” Dean said. “He was a nightmare. I thought he was going to get us both killed before we even found the damn thing we were hunting.”
“Just gonna sleep in my car,” Dean muttered, standing up and putting on his jacket. “Nothing new.”
“Dean?”
“What, you’re too good to get angry?” Dean snapped, and he stepped back slightly, his fists curling at his sides. “Wouldn’t stoop to that level? Wouldn’t just hit me back?”
"Me either," Dean said. "But I'm not that tired, so I don't really care."
Dean gritted his teeth. Of course he was lonely. Of course he was lonely! How could he not be? He wanted to just scream at Cas sometimes. Everyone was doing good at this whole normalcy thing. Charlie was engaged, for god’s sake. And Dean was just—wandering around talking to a voice in his head like that was a good way to spend your life. And the worst part was, he didn’t mind that part. That was the part of his life that
Cas looked back towards the bag, towards the couch. Glanced back at Dean. Reached for the bag.
“Ow, Jesus—”
“Harrond,” the bartender said. He grinned, his cheek dimpling under his scruff. “Want me to call you a cab?”
Dean couldn’t say exactly what was different that let him get past the barstool for once. Maybe it didn’t feel as real; felt more like a strange and over-heated dream. But in the motel room, locking the door and turning, feeling the doorknob at his lower back, it felt very, very real.
His life became confusing at that moment, when his empty heart suddenly was pierced by this stranger's green eyes. It took him six thousand visits to Biggerson's to find the man again, and has been to four thousand more moments in Biggerson's since then. He's kept a log of the visits, a fat notebook in his coat pocket, bulging with the records of Castiel's whole life's purpose. He did not know where he was when he first found the man, but he does know where he found the man the second time- but he doesn't know the
,” Cas purred, and he crawled over him, straddling Dean and sitting on his thighs.
Dean spotted Cas in the crowd and watched as he bashfully let Garth spin him by one hand in a small circle. As Garth released him and turned to dance with his wife instead, Cas continued on his path and landed in front of Sam’s little family, Eileen and Josie, and he crouched slightly and offered his hand to the girl. She wasn’t the infant Dean still imagined her as; she was nearly ready to start middle school. Cas shook her little hand, and even from across the room, Dean could hear the low rumble of his voice as he introduced himself.
As if that helped. But somehow, the horrors of childbirth—and Dean did not use that word lightly—almost managed to distract from the fact that there were very real, very normal risks associated. Sam seemed almost calm by comparison.
He swung the impala into the gravel by the bunker forcefully, coming to a quick and hard stop. He clutched at the dark, furious fire burning in his chest. It was enough to keep himself going, he knew it was. He burst into the bunker, half-breathless just from keeping himself from coming apart at the seams as he barreled down the stairs.
“You'll stay with me tonight, right?” Dean asked.
“Dean Winchester,” Castiel says.
This begins to bother Castiel. He is not usually one for hypotheticals, but he starts to wonder if Dean partakes in the sort of carnal pleasures that Castiel has inadvertently glimpsed in his travels. He considers following Dean the next time he finds the man- just to learn more about his life. He certainly is not an ordinary man, Castiel knows. Ordinary men do not stab strange creatures in restaurants, nor do they look like Dean.
He could feel Cas’s breath ghosting at his back; prickling pleasure skittered from that warmth down his spine.
Dean only dozed fitfully, waking up in starts, flashes of Hell flickering on his eyelids. He wasn’t headed there, he knew that. You didn’t have God for a sort-of step-son without at least going to heaven, right? But he was afraid nevertheless, which was actually...relieving. Sometimes, sitting in the bunker alone for the twelfth night in a row, he’d imagine what it’d be like to die out of the blue, and part of him couldn’t help but think that it wouldn’t even matter, that he wouldn’t even be upset and neither would anyone else. But the house peered down at him, looking for all the world like the house he’d spent the first few years of his life in, and his stomach was queasy and his heart was thundering in his ears.
“What the hell are you talking about, man?”
Cas shifted back upright behind him and jerked him through it as he kept slamming into him, his thrusts growing rapid and unsteady as Dean’s body lit up, as his nerves went bright and obliterating all at once.
When the waitress returned and Dean ordered the godforsaken thing, Cas was grinning when she walked away.
“An intervention is the minimum?”
Dean’s stomach twisted. His hands had never stopped shaking. But he—
Cas fidgeted and glanced up at Dean, catching his eye over his shoulder.
Cas started to pull away, and Dean reached out quickly, holding him from moving. He nodded, but squeezed his eyes shut, waiting for the frantic thudding of his heart to slow.
Dean drove down the ramshackle street the bar resided on until he came across a motel. Seashell themed. In the middle of Nebraska. Whatever.
wanted to talk to
Dean stared at the phone and shook his head.
Castiel knows that he has a nearly infinite amount of time to play with, as he has not aged in all of the years that he has wandered. He wonders sometimes if he is a mutated human who cannot remember where his origins lie.
“You remind me of me, like ten years ago,” Thomas said. “I was thirty, trying to pretend like I wasn’t going to end up just running the bar. Trying to pretend like I wanted to marry my fiancee even though I knew I didn’t love her. It’s poison, man.”
“Get off,” he gasped. Thomas immediately slipped away, kneeling just beside Dean. Dean scrambled to sit up, his knees pulling in towards his chest.
“Even once I couldn’t see your soul, you never stopped glowing, Dean,” Cas said. Dean pushed his plate away, his stomach tight. Cas frowned. “It’s a complement, Dean.”
“I said, why did they give us a single room?”
“Here’s one,” Dean said. “Seriously, man. Stay as long as you want.”
Dean forced his eyes up, and watched as something clicked in Helen’s eyes.
“Let’s do this inside,” Dean said. “I don’t think standing at the damn funeral pyre is the best place to catch up.”
At worst, his love for everyone else in their life would poison them, too, and undo anything good Sam had been able to accomplish. Open, heartfelt Sam. Sam’s love wouldn’t send someone into the cold grip of death.
Above everything, above the stimuli the dream gently pushed at him, even more than the cool, heavy feeling of a fishing pole in his hands, he felt familiarity. He felt at ease. He took a deep breath—it was always easy to tell if a dream was a dream; breaths weren’t satisfying the way they ought to be. It was more like taking a sip of water when you weren’t even thirsty.
“Is it because using a straw seems too feminine?” Cas asked, and Dean’s head dropped back down like a lead weight had been tied to his chin.
The thing that pissed me off about the finale maybe most of all was Dean dying. Dean gets to live to be old and curmudgeonly on a beach!!! Non-negotiable!!!
Confusion flicked through Sam’s eyes before his face turned into one giant pout.
“Hope you didn’t hurt yourself,” Benny said. Dean chuckled.
“What, if any of them could be my long-lost cousin?” Benny asked dryly. “Naw, I’m good.”
It took moments for Dean to fall asleep then, and Castiel was quite amused by how quickly Dean managed to curl around him, one leg shifting free of the blankets to tangle itself with Castiel's legs.
“That’s not what Benny said.”
“What?” he said.
Dean frowned, staring up into Cas’s worried gaze. “What—pretend this never happened?”
Cas took a step closer, and Dean felt his heart in his throat. For all the time that it had been since they’d first met—face to face, anyway—in that barn, sometimes it felt like they were still there, standing toe to toe, staring each other down. Cas’s eyes sometimes had that same cold burn to them, the inescapable feeling of being seen past the walls other people couldn’t see past.
“Yeah,” he muttered.
“What the fuck,” he muttered, pulling at the rope, and suddenly hands were on him, dragging him down, and the fabric around him was gone in a series of hard tugs and pulls.
And Benny was quiet most of the time. Not overwhelming. Easy company. Sam had shifted awkwardly the first time he swung by the bunker and Dean had to tell him that Benny was back from the dead and human this time. Old tensions died hard, Dean figured. Even if Benny and Sam had mostly worked past the stiffness in the end, it wasn’t like running into an old friend with the two of them. But it didn’t matter, it wasn’t like Sam was living in the bunker anymore, and from the way he gave Dean an overly-serious half-smile as he left the bunker that day, Dean could tell his brother was relieved someone was around full-time.
“I think so,” Charlie said fondly.
“What’s that about?” Dean asked. He bit into a breakfast sausage, eying Sam warily.
Dean could still remember the way Cas’s eyes had flicked up from where they’d drifted towards the ground when he’d said
His eyes flicked open, and that blue, blue, blue made the shadows seem pale and grey. Dean flinched, feeling as though he’d been caught at something he shouldn’t be doing.
Cas stayed against the wall, his arms hanging at his sides, and he considered Dean with a steady gaze. Dean felt his heart thudding in his ears, and he cleared his throat.
Only twice has someone said anything to him about the pictures- the first time a waitress tapped him lightly on the shoulder and asked if he was a journalist, and the second time a pot-bellied man eating a cheeseburger tried to shove him against a wall and tell him that he had not agreed to have his picture taken. Castiel had disappeared immediately, and the echo of an image of the man gasping lingered in his mind as he slipped into a broom closet of a new Biggerson's.
“What are you saying?” he asks, backing away.
“Cas—”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Dean asked, his voice coming out a little hysterical. Something was splintering apart in him, something heavy, and its shards were making his hands shake and his breath come out fast. This was real now. Cas was alive, and they—they’d said it, or Cas had and Dean had nearly said it, and they weren’t...they weren’t toeing around it like they had for...so long. So many years. How did you—how did you even deal with that? What did you say to someone you’ve loved like that for so long without saying it, once it’s all out there? Once you’ve spoken it into existence?
Sam couldn't help but wonder if something…more had developed between his brother and Castiel while they were in purgatory, but he dismissed the thought. It didn't really matter. He had his brother and his friend back, and that was what mattered. He would probably ask, though.
“It’s too much,” Cas said, his hand curving along Dean’s jaw. “You have to be in control all the time, don’t you? That much pressure on your shoulders? Is it enough to feel helpless? Or is it something else you want?”
“So this is your big trick?” Castiel recognizes the voice as Dean, but he cannot seem to drag himself away from the tray of meat to look at him. He takes a spare thought to note that Dean's last name is Winchester, a perfect last name for him. Dean Winchester. “Making people coo-coo for cocoa puffs?”
"I think I'm going out, actually," Dean said. He stormed out of the motel room, slamming the door rather loudly. Castiel stood up, giving Sam a confused glance before following Dean out.
“Ah, you can smirk and joke and lie to your brother and lie to yourself, but not to me. I can see inside you, Dean. I can see how broken you are, how defeated. You can't win and you know it but you just keep fighting, just keep going through the motions. You're not hungry, Dean, because inside you're already dead.”
Dean slept better than he had the night before. But no dreams—or, at least, no not-dreams like he would like.
“And...there are maybe more hunters than there are hunts, now,” Sam said slowly.
“I wasn’t sure if—if you’d want to...”
“You come here often?” he said, tilting his head towards the woman. She leaned her arms on the counter and smiled at him.
"What is it, Cas?" Dean asked gruffly.
“Can you believe he won’t let me use the throwing stars?” Dean muttered as he shut the impala’s trunk and trudged after Sam and Eileen towards the barn, nothing but a stupid machete in his hand.
“What took them so long giving you back?” Claire asked. Dean shot her a glance.
“I told him...I told him I felt the same way,” he said. “And that was...that was what killed him.”
he wanted to say,
Sam’s eyes immediately darted over to Charlie, who was standing with a hand pressed over her mouth off slightly to the side. They held each other’s gaze for a second before Sam’s eyes dropped to the ground. Dean tried to catch Charlie’s gaze with a frown, but she looked innocently up towards the night sky.
“Hello?” he said, his voice croaky and horrible.
Benny shook his head slow. “You’re roundin’ on fifty,” he said. “Could be a good time to do other things.”
about two men who are—who are like ‘brothers’ as you say, sharing a bed. And if you think there is, that’s ridiculous.”
He led the way to the bunker; the door hanging open from Jody’s trip inside to get water. Another ten years pinned onto his life. If he didn’t die again barreling into a hunt head-first. Who was Cas to say how many years Dean was required to live before he was allowed to die? He could die any time. He could trip walking down the bunker stairs and—
Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Cas laugh like that—like for once, everything was right in the world. He leaned down to kiss the proud smirk off Cas’s face. Maybe, for once, for now, everything was.
Then Sam took a deep breath and his frown deepened slightly, and he punched Cas in the face with a guttural crunch.
Dean took another step, making it to the floor. Human? His mind raced, a thousand different thoughts bottlenecking together.
Dean thought, staring at what felt like the hundredth dusty old book.
“And he just happened to rematerialize on my front porch?”
“So you weren’t kidding about the whole no divine intervention thing,” Benny said.
, didn’t you?”
“Well, I would’ve just gotten a different burger if you hadn’t said anything.” Dean spoke too fast, and it came out sounding almost angry. He tore off the paper around his straw and blew the other half at Cas, who looked down and watched it hit him in the chest. “I’ll try some of your meatloaf, anyway. Gotta make sure it’s not poisoned.”
him. He knew him better than Sam ever had. Dean knew he and Sam had, deep down, a fundamental misunderstanding of one another. He’d never known how to fix it. With Cas, even when things went wrong or they had misunderstandings, there was always that deeper knowing. Like they’d met before, like they’d always known each other.
Benny reached towards him, and Dean stayed where he was sprawled, boneless and placid against the couch cushions. His hand was huge and as it pressed to Dean’s cheek, Dean realized he felt almost
Cas leaned down over him, one hand pressing into the bed beside Dean’s head, the other still gripping Dean’s hip to hold him up, to make sure that when his hips snapped forward, every inch of him drove deeper into Dean.
“I understand,” Cas started, a frown creasing his forehead.
Castiel blinked a few times at the offer and glanced over at Dean, who was practically swaying on his feet from exhaustion. He nodded, following them into the motel room and planting himself on the couch. Both of the Winchesters went to their respective beds almost immediately, Dean barely sparing time to kick off his shoes whereas Sam showered and changed into sweatpants first.
“I’m sorry I let you,” Cas said.
“Sam!” Charlie hissed, tugging at Sam’s arm. “I told you not to—”
with him? He slept again, ate again, watched more shitty television, and was back at Porky’s. And again. And again. His phone kept buzzing, always Charlie.
“Wha—well, make him a—make him a…not...that,” Dean sputtered. “Make him here. He’s
Castiel regroups in a hotel room, sinking onto a bed. He hadn't even taken a picture. All he'd done was get himself actually
“What are you doing here?” Cas asked urgently, almost shaking Dean with the hands at his shoulders. “You’re supposed to be alive.”
“Hey, Cas,” he breathed finally, the words slipping out of him so easily it was like he’d never stopped praying. “I hope you got your ears on."
“No, I don’t—”
Just to appease those lingering thoughts from that other era.
“Yes, Dean?”
Charlie just hummed in agreement.
Dean patted his pocket to make sure his wallet was still there and gave Cas a nod. He wasn’t sure what the nod meant exactly, so he couldn’t imagine Cas did.
"You should sleep," Castiel said. "You must be tired."
Dean, until Dean was fully on the bed, his legs flung out akimbo and his arms tangled in the sheets. He pulled Dean’s t-shirt up and quickly wrenched it over his head before nodding darkly at the headboard Dean was now inches from. Dean’s hands moved before he could process, before he could wonder what the nod meant, and they gripped the cold metal rods above his head.
“Go get water!”
And extremely rarely, only when he began to get bored with his locations, he would arrive just outside the restaurant, by the dumpsters. When he felt extremely daring, of course, that was when he'd arrive in the restaurant itself, tempting fate and checking how observant Biggerson's customers were.
Benny paused, looking at Dean with weight behind his gaze.
Castiel arrives in an Indiana Biggerson's, only a few months' time after the last incident with Dean Winchester, and raises his notebook-heavy right hand as he walks to the main area to take a picture. As he snaps it he realizes that in the farthest corner of the restaurant, Dean is sitting, talking to Sam as he chews a mouthful of fries. Castiel backs slightly around the corner and snaps more photos, barely waiting for each picture's Polaroid to print before taking another.
He flipped back his sheets and slid into bed slowly, like maybe if he moved slow enough, he wouldn’t scare Cas away this time. And he stared at the dark ceiling, the minutes ticking away in the back of his mind even after he took his clock and put it out in the hall. And then he slept.
Dean’s hands froze, awkwardly hovering above the bed.
“Cas, I—” words failed Dean, and he leaned into Cas, catching his lips with his own, just the ghost of a kiss, before pulling back and watching Cas’s expression shift.
“Cas,” he said. “I—”
“Anyway,” Dean said. “You’re probably tired from the whole...being dead thing. There’s plenty of rooms.”
Cas’s eyes flicked down to where Dean’s hand clung—not pushing or pulling Cas away, just clinging—and his face flickered slightly, his mouth twitching at the sight.
Charlie’s mouth was steadily widening, and she seemed about to say something. Dean shook his head.
But then he was holding the baby, the tiny, fragile baby, and he realized he didn’t even know what panic was. The baby would be moving soon and walking and thinking and going out in the world to get hurt.
By the time Dean had retrieved a few beers, after telling Jody that there seemed to be no more brawls going down inside, everyone was crowded around the table talking. It didn’t feel all that different from the night that Dean had left the bunker, although there was a bit of a manic mood in the air. Probably something about going from a funeral to a miraculous rebirth to a reunion all in one night.
The bathroom door swung open and Cas puttered out, stuffing things away in his bag before taking the bag off the bed and setting it on the floor. Dean closed his eyes, not wanting to see Cas approach the bed, not wanting to let himself watch, when his fingers twitched around nothing. He’d forgotten to grab his gun out of his bag to stick beside him for the night.
Dean choked, the dry edges of the crust catching in his throat. “What?” he said, reaching for a glass of water. “What do you mean, me?”
“Divine intervention, I guess,” Benny said, gripping Dean in return tightly for a moment before stepping back with a sigh.

ago and bit the dust then.
“You didn’t deserve what I did to you,” Cas said. “I won’t leave again, Dean.”
“Dean, you’re, uh.” Sam shook his head slowly. “You’re younger.”
Dean bit at the inside of his cheek and lifted his glass, taking a long sip.
Dean’s boots were lead weights as he trudged out of the room. Through the bunker. Up the stairs. Out the door. His boot was heavy on the accelerator, too, taking him to the location texted by Sam amidst hours of other texts.
without it turning deadly. They could’ve died together; faced Death and gone out with tear-damp faces and their hands...their hands clutched together. And instead, he had to open his mouth and summon the Empty where Cas’s confession failed to.
“I’ll get it,” Cas said. “In your bag?”
Benny nodded slowly, and he looked down at the ground for a moment, thinking.
“No, I will,” Thomas said. “Why not.”
It was clear once Dean got on the highway what Sam meant by
“You’ve been camped out at this bar for long enough, man,” Charlie said. “Are you ever gonna go back to the bunker? Seriously.”
His system is flawed, of course. His obsession with this stranger combined with his desire to remain separated from humanity leaves him in a strange limbo- he does not simply want to snap pictures and leave, he wants to
?” he snapped.
Dean stumbled, his feet still caught in shreds of fabric, and he caught himself against what felt like wood. A pyre, he realized, twisting around to see what it was he’d been dragged off.
“Hey, tacking ten years onto my life is a hell of an apology, though,” Dean said.
As they walked back towards their room—towards the bed, the only bed, as far as Cas knew—Dean tossed the container into a garbage can. He realized Cas was no longer beside him a few steps later, and he glanced back.
“I had to tell him, Dean!” Charlie said. “He noticed something was weird on his own, anyway, it’s not like you were subtle, always drifting off into corners to talk to yourself for a few years there.”
Sam made his way down the stairs, and when he reached the bottom he held out the bulging bag of food. Dean’s hands moved robotically, taking the warm bag and clutching it to his chest.
Castiel waits until the two men sit down to walk up to them. He knows that he shouldn't, he knows that he should just take a picture and leave again, but he's curious.
Castiel shifts away from them slightly.
When Dean finally surrendered her back to her parents, his hands were shaking and he went out into the hall.
Had Cas ever had rhubarb pie when he was human? Dean couldn’t remember ever giving him any, and it wasn’t likely he’d have gone off and found some pie on his own.
Dean stood up.
Somehow, the thing Dean lingered on the most about that trip to the future—more than who Dean had become, more than the way things unfolded—was that version of Cas. Was it Zachariah’s idea of a joke? ‘Look at this angel who lowers himself to respecting humans, this is how I see him? This is what he will become?’ Or was it a real future, the way the past Dean had seen a few times was real? Could
There are police records the author found of both boys- Dean has been arrested for attacking a woman, there are records of Dean's death, followed by records of his arrest for murdering a woman, along with Sam for suspected association, the arrests from which they suspiciously escaped and a police officer named Diane was accused of releasing them, Dean has several other charges- mail fraud, credit card fraud, grave desecration, breaking and entering, armed robbery, kidnapping, and an extra murder count. Castiel is confused by the whole list, and barely can comprehend the time-line that the author presents.  Castiel goes back to the search page that the helpful boy had pulled up, and a new news story about the boys has appeared, announcing that they have murdered more people.
“What do you mean?”
“Cas,” he said finally, talking at the ground. “I know I told you to fuck off. But...I hope you’re listening. I assume you are, you’ve never...never ignored my prayers when I needed you to listen. Well, I guess you have, but you always thought it was for my own good.”
He was dead. Right.
Castiel wonders sometimes if he ought to create some kind of system, progress slowly through time and look for the man. But he can't bring himself to do that- it would take too much effort. It would take thousands of visits for every day in Biggerson's history, and he wants to get lucky for once, find the man with just a shred of good fortune. And besides, chances are, the man hasn't been to the future or the past, and only has a small window of time during which he's visited Biggerson's, maybe forty years. When he thinks about it, his whole modus operandi doesn't make sense. He's relying wholly on the idea that he'll stumble into the man again- he's managed it twice before, after all. He sighs again, wondering why he even bothers. He ought to stick to the location he found the man before, shovel through the debris of time until finding that same moment. But he could run into himself again, that's the whole problem.
“You know,” he said, “sometimes it’s like you’re still Castiel.”
Castiel twisted them around so that he was pressing Dean into the car, and the movement caused Dean to let out a quick breath. The car was fairly low, so Dean's head rested almost on top of the car, making his whole body arch out slightly to accommodate the angle. Castiel pressed harder into Dean, moving back up to his mouth, pushing into the man to relieve this tension between them that he hadn't really known was there.
Then, sudden and frigid as an unwelcome breeze, Cas stepped away, and Dean’s shoulder and cheek and lips went cold, and he fell forward, catching himself on one hand before scrambling up as Cas turned and walked away.
When the bar was starting to empty out—much later than the last few nights, close to two in the morning—Dean was biting at his bottom lip and...wondering.
Sam sighed. “Dean, I don’t know why you felt like you couldn’t tell me, but it’s okay. It doesn’t matter to me. It’s a little
The young man sits him down in front of a screen similar to the TVs. Castiel vaguely understands computers- he recalls a time in the 90s that he stumbled into a strange lab full of people working at bulky contraptions called computers to perform tasks. This thing in front of him is much sleeker and smaller, similar to the laptops he's seen people using at Biggerson's, but hadn't made the connection between those and computers. He frowns, wondering if his assumption is correct.
Dean nodded. “That’s...true.”
“Figured we’d crash here,” Sam said. “Josie fell asleep.”
Dean pursed his lips, watching his brother gently spin his new wife.
Cas squinted at him, and Dean was back to feeling the glass of the microscope slide, pinning him in place. Finally, Cas shrugged and took a bite of his meatloaf. As he chewed, a smile curled his mouth—one that he seemed to try to hide, looking out at the rest of the diner so he wasn’t facing Dean.
He turned his laptop towards Dean. The words all blurred, but Dean nodded.
They slipped into the barn, quickly finding the boys and shooing them outside. Eileen ran with them, pulling them out the door as figures quickly surrounded them.
Dean blinked. “Shit.”
“I’m best man, right?” Dean asked.
“Can you at least put a blessing on her or something?” Dean asked frantically, earning him a sidelong glance from a nurse.
Benny crossed his arms slowly. “You’re in love with that angel of yours,” Benny said. “I don’t know why he’s not down here with you, but...I know love when I see it.”
And not a single woman within a remotely acceptable age range in the place was someone Dean hadn’t already tried to push himself towards and then bailed on. He raised his eyebrows and blew out a sigh. Maybe he
Benny followed after Dean as he headed down the hall to one of the spare bedrooms.
Benny stood there for a second, considering Dean with a long gaze. Finally he nodded and slipped into the room, looking around at it for a moment before sinking to the bed.
“Well, I saw Cas,” Dean said reluctantly.
“It’s kind of lonely here by yourself,” Dean said, shutting the bunker door as the latest passersby-hunters filed out.
Dean tended to only have dreams late in the night, in the early hours of the morning just before he started to get restless and sleep only fitfully in small, light bursts before throwing himself out of bed. Usually, once he managed to sleep, it was just darkness and incoherent thoughts—ideas he thought he would remember tomorrow even if he didn’t write them down (but never did remember).
“I’m getting some cider,” she said, and walked away. A little suspiciously quickly for someone supposedly getting cider and not just trying to escape a conversation.
Dean’s stomach dropped, and he set down the burger he’d been about to take a bite out of. ‘With Benny.’
“If we rush off with some half-cocked plan, that’s no better for the families,” Jody insisted. “We need to figure out what will actually work and get it right. The first time.”
was that made him push and strike out like a cornered animal—that made him want to see something other than placid, steady
“I can’t read your mind, Dean,” Cas said, and it felt as though a heavy, grey cloud pulled downwards at Dean, his stomach twisted, and he started to lean back, away from Cas—he couldn’t put it into words, Cas had to
“I’ve done it before,” Dean said. Charlie shook her head questioningly. “I mean, I was in hell for forty years. Came out, barely any time had passed. I felt like I should be an old man, but I was still young. Had to try and forget what I’d felt for forty years and act like I was the same person.”
“What?”
“You didn’t see that, did you? Or hear that? How does this work, man?” Dean said.
“That’s a good idea,” he said. “I was thinking that I could be a good antiquities dealer. Check if things are authentic, you know? I could get started with some of the stuff we’ve got in the bunker, and it wouldn't be a forty-hour a week thing, so I could still help with hunts and research and—”
Dean smiled, and watched as Sam melted with relief, tension flooding out of him.
Dean shouldered his way through the door back out into the fading heat. There was no way that shitty little couch’s pull-out bed was halfway decent. It was probably the sort of thing that was filled with hard, sharp springs that squealed every time you so much as twitched. But Dean had seen worse, and slept on worse. And the mattress was uncomfortable, too. The sofa bed would be better than—than—
He pushed out into the cool night air and glanced back to see the bartender locking the door behind him and tugging the neon
He stuffed his feet back in his shoes and stumbled out into the early afternoon light, answering the call. It was the least he could do.
“Oh,” she says. “Well, if you need any assistance, I'll be-”
He didn’t take much. Just a couple weapons, the bare minimum. The clothes on his back; a flask full of whiskey in case he needed any...extra encouragement. The spell book. He lingered near some of the scrap papers from their research. He could write a note to the rest of them; tell them he was going to take care of it, but they’d figure it out on their own in time. He didn’t know what it was he could say anyway.
Before he could talk himself into a corner Cas grasped his face and pulled Dean back to him, coaxing Dean’s mouth open and making a small, satisfied whine into the kiss.
“Who are you looking up, dude?” he asks.
"I don't really care."
Castiel stumbles towards the door.
Standing at the door of the bunker, looking back at the dim, quiet space he’d called home for so long, Dean couldn’t help but sigh, feeling a bit like Sam with the overdramatic sighing-every-two-minutes. Sometime in the last few years, the bunker had started feeling like a purgatory of its own.
Sam stared after them, the glance from Castiel confusing him more than anything else.
“Sorry,” Sam said, standing in the doorway. “Just—is everything OK?”
“Do you think you deserve to be punished?” Cas asked, and his hand carded through Dean’s hair, palming up along the back of Dean’s scalp. Suddenly, his hand went tight, grabbing at Dean’s hair and pulling, hard enough that Dean’s head tipped back into the force, his neck stretching long as a gasp wrenched out of him. “Or is it...nostalgia? You just want to see me as I once was?”
“Oh Jesus, Cas—”
Then, with a fluttering roll of her eyes and their accompanying eyelashes, she lolled her head to the side to stare at the computer screen beneath the counter and typed something in, her pointer finger pecking one key at a time.
When Cas released him, Dean swayed on his feet, his head spinning.
“Are you really okay?” she asked.
There was a moment there—on his knees on the concrete, staring up at the woman he barely recognized from some past life—that he wondered if he and Sam were about to go out in the lamest way possible. Slaughtered by some overdramatic mimes.
Castiel takes only a moment in each one that he visits, long enough to take a breath and a picture. It's something of an obsession of his, the only thing that he can think about anymore. He's careful- very careful, of course, as he has cultivated himself to be- and he has not yet been noticed. After twenty visits, he changes clothes, parts his hair differently, and begins to place himself in a new position during his visits. It's easiest to start in the broom cupboard: dark, private, and
Dean tore his eyes away so he could breathe properly; his eyes lingered on the wall behind Cas.
Dean cleared his throat and grasped blindly at Cas, grabbing hold of his coat. Sam looked over his shoulder a little nervously, like he was worried there would be some public indecency happening down on the bunker floor.
this time, and Cas knew how to love after all. The tin man really did have a heart in
And he slept, and ate, and watched shitty daytime television, and then he was back at Porky’s. Another glass in his hand. And then he was at the motel, alone again; another woman lured in and pushed away. What was
“Ah,” he said, and his fingers tightened on Dean’s jaw, hard enough that the points where his fingers dug into the skin burned. “I didn’t say you could touch.”
“Regardless, Dean, you should’ve at least tried to live a normal life.”
“No, no, let me—” Dean swung his legs out of bed.
“I told you, I would return to earth once—”
Dean gaped at him. Did he have a glowing, neon sign on his head that said
Sam cleared his throat after a long silence. "Just, uh, curious," he said. "Is there some kind of…relationship I should know about?"
“Tell me what you want, Dean,” Cas murmured. His eyes seemed darker—was it the angle, or was it...something else?
“And Sam is usually kind to people’s faces,” Cas said. “He would’ve told the waitress he was all set, but explained to her that everything was great and he just wished there was a fridge in his room.”
“Cas—”
one more goddamn time he’d throw his drink, glass and all, across the bar at the hipster-looking college kid hovering possessively over the jukebox.
Charlie hummed, smiling to herself and looking up toward the ceiling. Dean could
He finds it impossible to travel more than a few years at a time- he didn't realize the shortcoming at first, but after many small jumps forward, humans began to publish newspapers with the year noted on them, and realized that if he stretched himself he could only move two years forward or back at a time. He'd tried moving fifty years without any pauses once, and found that he required sleep at the end of the exertion. The only times he needs the strange unconsciousness is after long travels of time. He finds the limitation to be simple, scarcely a weakness at all. He does not care so much about traveling far in time- his true love was going to far away places, at least until he started the hunt.
“They just messed up,” Dean said. He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. “Charged me for a double.”
“So you can’t come to Earth and...intervene in person, but this is fine?” Dean asked. “You want me to just go about my life for a few decades but I have you in my ear?”
“There you go,” he says. “His whole life story, really.”
“I was worried about you,” Charlie said. “Benny said you—”
“Be yourself?”
Dean sighed in relief and prodded one of the heads with his toe. It slid away a little too easily, the ground beneath it soaked in blood.
Then the fists stopped landing, and he was panting and Sam’s arm was tugging at him to stand upright. To face God, bloody and broken and let Him see that they were better than Him not despite their bruised and battered bodies but because of them. And that was…. Maybe a good thing. Maybe it was good that there was one being in the universe that Dean could spit down at and not just say but
“Guess so,” Dean said. He couldn’t even picture the waitress’s face. He gave Cas a small smile though, before picking up his menu and flipping it open to the donut burger.
Cas didn’t say anything as he flicked off the light by the door and slid the chain into place, or as he climbed in beside Dean and their arms brushed. It produced the exact swooping sensation Dean had buried away no less than eighty times in the past two hours as he imagined this moment.
Dean’s elbows went wobbly and he slipped, falling down until his arms braced against the bed and cheek pressed to the sheets.
Something creaked in the bunker, louder than the thundering pulse in Dean’s ears, and Dean’s hand went to the gun in his waistband, lingering near the handle of the gun. The bunker made lots of noises; thumps and bangs and creaks and groans of pipes and walls shifting and a million other things. He kept his eyes on Benny; tried to feel out what the hell the feeling pulsing in him was. Was he just frustrated, or was there—could there be something?
“Charlie,” Dean said warningly. He adjusted his arms around Cas, who had one hand gripped to his cheek. “You didn’t…”
A young man behind the desk stands up.
“You think it’ll work?” Jody asked, leaning even closer to try and read the tiny font.
“I like to think it's because of my strength of character,” Dean says, and Castiel smiles into the meat. He recognizes a hint of humor.
“But, Cas,” Dean said, his voice cracking. “What if a ‘bit of time’ turns into more? What if it’s...years? Decades? In a few decades, I’ll be—old. Maybe dead, it’s not like I eat rabbit food and run all the time like Sam.”
Cas become that one?
Castiel feels choked, and he stands up, abandoning the computer. He frowns, wondering if he misunderstood something that he read, wondering if this is all some hallucination. The guy at the desk shouts something casually to him as he leaves, but the words blur into blackness and he doesn't really hear them, let alone comprehend them. He feels a hand on his shoulder, and turns. The librarian is standing there, his chestnut hair mussed, glasses crammed into the curls.
“It’s not.”
“What?” he said. “About what?”
“That’s what you’ll have then,” Jack said. He drifted away, following the path Sam had taken through the crowd, and Dean swallowed around the cottony feeling in his mouth. A normal life. Even the bad parts.
Cas gestured at the diner around them, the tired motel guests and the truck drivers passing by before sleeping in their cabs.
Sitting in the diner, feeling the sticky vinyl bench beneath his legs, watching the other customers eat with haggard faces bent down towards their plates, Dean felt like he and Cas stood out like sore thumbs. The heavy, dull feeling that usually settled in after long drives, that he’d just been feeling a few minutes ago—it was gone. Something anxious and quivering and eager perched in his chest instead, and when the waitress came over with waters and the same faded menus Cas had studied in the room, Dean greeted her with a smile that he hadn’t put on for waitstaff in years.
Dean’s feet moved faster than his brain could stutter through thoughts and frustrations and—Benny was standing there, looking at him a little curiously, and Dean grabbed him by the lapels and kissed him, a little too hard, a little too needy, a little too
Cas reached out and gripped the front of Dean’s t-shirt tightly, his fingers twisting the fabric so it pulled forward and the collar tugged at the back of his neck.
Sam perked up from where he was slouched on the couch, texting Eileen--she was just in their bedroom down the hall, but you’d think she was in Siberia for how pouty Sam was in her absence.
“I’m not ‘normal people,’” Cas said, raising his hands and finger quoting as he spoke. A pang of fondness swam through Dean. He was the same dorky angel he’d always been. "And time in heaven does not pass the same as on earth, I don't know..."
“Seriously, are you two okay?” he said, stuffing his mouth with the pie.
“Cas,” he said softly. His head turned slightly more; tipping up until he could see the angel’s face.
The last word was so low it was almost a growl, and an odd, high noise hitched out of Dean’s throat as he fisted his hands into the sheets above his head.
“What are you staring at me like that for?”
"Drop it."
“Closing time,” the bartender said, rapping at the counter in front of them. Dean glanced over his shoulder at the rest of the bar—almost everyone was cleared out.
Cas tilted his head side to side. “Like you’ve gotten good news but you don’t know how to break the news.”
Dean cracked open his next beer and pushed at the swelling feeling in his chest. Resentment? Or maybe just plain fear. Maybe Cas hadn’t meant what he said that way, but now that he was a full angel again he could feel the desperation rolling off Dean in waves and needed some space. Maybe—
Dean shook his head. “What? No,” he said.
Dean lay awake for an hour before he finally sat up, staring across the small room at Castiel, who was sitting uncomfortably on the couch. Dean swallowed hard, not liking that he had to ask for help, especially in this manner.
“Well, uh, anyone want a beer?” Dean asked. “And I’m going to tell the others they don’t need to hide outside, unless you want to get any punches in first, Charlie?”
“If something goes wrong, you’ll fix it, right?” he said the night of the birth. He’d said the same thing a million times, every time Eileen so much as sighed. And every time, Cas said the same thing.
Cas squinted slightly and his head slowly tilted, like he just
“I can stay here?” Cas asked slowly.
...when you long for something?”
“Dean,” Cas said finally, the smile twitching wider. “I heard your prayer.”
“You tell your brother about Castiel?”
He cut himself off. He knew what he was thinking—that if he’d been any worse off, he’d have gone into a fight a little too recklessly
Cas didn’t reply, but there were three soft knocks at Dean’s door, and he threw it open.
Sam glanced up from his position at the stove and stifled a smile.
and Dean laughed. The idea of Cas being a brother to him—he wasn’t sure if he’d ever believed it, when he’d said it. It
“Are you okay?” Eileen asked urgently.
She shrugged. “They do the job.”
Castiel sat silently throughout the conversation, looking down at the floor.
“Dean,” someone gasped.
“No. You know what? No,” Dean said, his voice raising, his throat scratching. “That’s bullshit, Cas.”
Castiel tugs the knife out and hands it meekly back to Dean, understanding the concept of belongings.  Dean's eyes widen, and his mouth drops open. Castiel realizes that the man is older than last time, with tiny wrinkles beginning to spawn on his cheeks.
There was a long pause on the other end, like she was taking a deep breath.
Sam squinted. “Well...yeah. I do. Exactly.”
Nothing filled that silence. Not the music he cranked loud in the car, not the roar of the engine, not the dull, muddled cacophony of the bar he ended up in. Someone kept playing Elton  John on the jukebox, and if he heard
“Hello,” he says, standing beside their table.
“I’ve touched every cell in your body,” Cas said, running a hand along Dean’s ribs. “I stitched you together. And you’ve hidden yourself from me ever since. And for what?”
He swallowed, his eyes caught by Charlie’s reluctant, anxious gaze now.
With a sigh Castiel shifts into a Biggerson's restaurant. Santa Fe, Denver, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Tucson, Lincoln, Reno, Bangor, Portland, Hartford, Medford, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Palm Bay flicked by, and he collects those images. He pauses in Palm Bay, labeling all twelve of those new photographs before he could forget. The man is not in any of them, of course- Castiel had been looking around each restaurant, so that if the man were there he could have taken more pictures, and taken a chance to really stare into the man's eyes, see if the photographs had exaggerated the grassy green of his eyes.
He settled back against the pillows and stared up at the ceiling, his heart thundering. Any second Cas would emerge and—
“I didn’t know you knew what a pull-out couch was,” Dean said weakly.
Thomas frowned. Frowned like he was pitying Dean. Like he was offering because he wanted the guy to stay and not because it seemed like the courteous thing to do.
“What is the matter with you?” Cas said. “You were supposed to—”
Thanks for all your comments; it's really been a joy to see people's reactions and feel a little more connected to other post-finale grievers and in general feel more connected to new people during covid. Hope everyone's staying safe, and if anyone else has fled back to tumblr since the finale fiasco, I'm @sgtjmsbrns on there.
“What about you?” Sam said.
“It’s Castiel,” he said, lowering his head in close enough that Dean could feel his breath against his cheek, and a shudder ran through him.
“You—”
“So you’ll have to tell me if you want me to stop,” Cas said, and Dean’s vision blurred, a heady wave of heat rushing through him.
Maybe, he thought, and immediately reached for the whiskey—maybe when he died and showed up in heaven, Cas wouldn’t even be there to greet him. Wouldn’t even care anymore, would’ve gotten tired of the idea of Dean and moved on to bigger and better things.
“So, uh, guess we’re bunking up,” Dean said. His voice cracked and he winced.
“It doesn’t matter anyway,” Jack said lightly. He stepped closer and patted Dean’s shoulder. The touch sent crawling, nauseous waves through Dean’s body, and he couldn’t pinpoint why. He'd never been a big fan of the idea of God in the first place, he figured. Even before he knew Him.
than he was used to having, or expecting.
“That doesn’t seem like the cheerful, optimistic Dean Winchester I remember,” Benny said. He stood still at the bottom of the stairs, staring around at the bunker. “Where’d you find this place?”
“What else am I good for?” Dean said, the words spilling out too fast to stop.
Castiel's records are growing out of control- he carries a string of small notebooks, looped together at their spines by a piece of twine. They are filled with thousands of small passages, like “Butte Montana, 2007, June 6, 5:00 pm—no” and “Black Rock, New York, 2007, October 18, 8:30 pm—yes”.
“I’m sorry I’ve told you to leave so many times,” Dean said. “Pushed you away.”
“Yeah, alright, thanks,” Dean said. “Do you have any actual doubles? With beds?”
“Yes, he happened to rematerialize within spitting distance of the bunker?” Dean said.
“Yeah, I really am not looking for one of those,” Dean muttered.
“So, Benny,” Dean said as he made toast for the both of them. “I was thinking.”
“Sounds like our kind of thing,” he said. If Sam asked a single question about what Dean just looked at, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
“He…” Dean trailed off weakly. “Yeah, that sounds like him.”
prayers?” Sam asked indignantly. “I’ve been telling you for years what you were doing to Dean.”
“Okay, good!” Charlie said. “I’ll tell Sam you’re heading back to the bunker, that you’re okay.”
“I should’ve known,” Cas said, and he pushed forward slightly, finally, and Dean closed his eyes to better feel the slight burn and stretch and heat. “That moment in the alley—you’d have let me do this then, wouldn’t you? I felt the longing, I thought you wanted death, but you wanted
“Can I help you with something?” the larger one asks politely.
He couldn’t bear to—couldn’t write out anything else. Couldn’t explain. That wasn’t what he was good at, clearly. Saying what he needed to.
“There’s nothing near this place,” Dean said, shaking his head. “I’m not leaving the bunker just to go be a grease monkey for some asshole in Junction City or something.”
The first time Dean woke up to find himself curled up beneath the coat, he sighed and stood up with the coat, returning to Castiel wordlessly. The next time Dean had a chance to sleep, he would again insist that he didn't need the coat and end up waking up underneath it.
Castiel stared at Dean, noticing that he was breathing heavily despite not really having exerted himself.
“Why don’t you use your straw?” Cas asked, stabbing his own down through the ice thick in the glass.
Dean showed the others back to their guest quarters, even though they all knew their way around. Even if the reason for them all being here was grim, he couldn’t help but feel a bubbly lightness in him at the number of people who’d been in the bunker for almost a full week now.
“No! Cas!” Dean reached out, trying to hold everything to himself; the grass, the tree, the sky,
“I’m real,” Benny said, raising his arms in a shrug. “Far as I could tell. And, uh. Human, far as I can tell. Woke up next to the Impala.”
The streetlights overhead clicked on as it turned to dusk, and Dean’s stomach growled. He was too nauseous to eat, maybe because he hadn’t eaten, maybe because he knew he was going to die.
“Are you okay?!”
rarely visited.
“You okay?” Charlie asked, sidling up beside him.
There was...there was planning. Sam did most of it. Always was the brains of the operation. Dean was nearly mute, words echoing in his head. Things he said. Things he didn’t say. Things Cas said. After all this time…
Cas slowly leaned forward, one knee bracing onto the bed beside Dean’s waist, and he reached for Dean’s jaw, grasping it tightly in hand.
“Uh huh.”
“Cas,” he said as he shut the door to his bedroom behind him. “If you and Jack are hands-off, wanna tell me how Benny is back from the dead?”
But he turned around anyway to see the paper wrapping resting on the shoulder of the elderly woman sitting in the booth to Dean’s back. He hadn’t liked that they’d been seated where he had an occupied table at his back, but the woman had seemed harmless and there were no other tables open, anyway. It hadn’t seemed worth fussing about at the time.
"So, you don't do that with someone who's just a friend."
“You seen Cas?” Dean asked.
By the time they were back at the bunker, trying on the feeling of normal, Dean could feel the creeping feeling of something missing. Sure, there was a dog there now, and he could focus on hunts and cars and things that were simple, but...there was still a gaping space.
On the rare, quiet nights, Castiel would sit next to Dean as he tried to sleep, always a foot away as Dean insisted. But within a few minutes- and Castiel wasn't sure if Dean was ever asleep by then- Dean would roll closer and curl into Castiel's side, a pleased hum eitting from him as he wrapped himself around Castiel's warmer body.
“I saw it online,” Cas said. “In a list about toxic masculinity behaviors.”
Neither of them answered, and Dean stabbed at an apple pie.
"I'm not going to drop it, I told you, I'm curious!" Castiel exclaimed. "I don't understand why you won't tell me why you're angr-"
Every Biggerson's is the same. Perfectly identical, nothing defining one from the other except the strikingly similar staff working there. Waiters with the same personality, the same fake smile, the same uniform. The same type of plates, the same level of beverages in freshly poured cups, the same wallpaper. Even the views outside the small windows were similar- they gazed out at vague, unrecognizable roads. The pictures hanging on the walls were all the same, too- abstract pictures of hamburgers and ice cream, as if that would make the lukewarm, mildly tasty food any better. Even the smell of the rarely-used floor cleaner is the same, mingling with the scent of deep-fat-fried onions, dropped in whole.
Dean just hummed reluctantly for him to go on, staring fixedly at the TV screen even though he couldn’t for the life of him say what was on.
Castiel immediately returns to the Biggerson's main area, pulling Dean's hands off of his tie and leaving again. Dean cries out a wordless shout when Castiel yanks his hands, and the scream bothers Castiel as he returns to the hotel room.
“Just—”
Dean felt himself slipping, pulling away. Maybe on purpose. It was something in him cracking now. Hope, maybe, shattering apart. And he was waking up, the dream crumbling apart and slipping through his fingers. He couldn’t hold onto anything, it seemed.
Cas’s frown deepened.
“No,” Sam says.
“You know, I’m sort of the older brother now,” Sam said. “Maybe
Both men look up at him, and the larger one, the one he's seen in the pictures with
“I look ridiculous,” Dean said. He was standing in front of a mirror, tugging at the cuffs of an overly-fancy suit. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been to a wedding. Had he ever been?
The cold concrete floor was unforgiving. There was no yielding pressure there, no room to let his body sag or slump into resignation. The only option was despair.
Even Miracle nosed at him nervously, trying to prod some sort of comment out of him.
“No,” Dean said. He glanced over his shoulder towards the hallway Sam had gone down. He needed to tell Sam not to bother, not to worry over that when it was already fixed.
“This is—this is where you left,” Dean said, recognizing the room. “That’s where it—where it came for you.”
was the one who needed to be nervous, and something unwound slightly in Dean’s gut.
but has never paid attention to, lowers the top of his laptop slightly.
Every breath caught in Dean’s throat. He couldn’t—couldn’t put it into words, couldn’t say the things he’d imagined, quietly at the back of his mind where he could pretend that he wasn’t thinking of it.
Dean huffed and finished his drink, throwing back the dregs. “I can relate to that.”
Dean shrugged. “Didn’t want her to think I didn’t like it. I did. Just didn’t want the rest.”
“That’s why you ignored me for so long?” Dean asked. “What, decided you’d answer maybe a third of my prayers?”
“Hey, did you find everything you were looking for?” he asks, shoving his sweater sleeves up his arms. “I wasn't sure you had full control of that computer.”
There are a series of crashes and odd whooshes garbled by gags, and then it is quiet again.
“You know,” Cas said thoughtfully, one of his hands sliding down Dean’s sweat-slick spine as the other held him up by the waist. “When I’ve imagined you like this, I always thought you’d be controlling. Mean, even. I never imagined something like this.”
Helen frowned, but stood up, sliding off her barstool.
He took a deep breath before pushing through the group and passing a beer to Sam and a new bag of frozen food to Cas, taking the original one to put back in the freezer. People kept patting Dean's shoulder, like they wanted to make sure he was real and not a group hallucination.
go back to the same restaurant to see
“What is that?” Castiel asks.
Birds were chirping. The sun was warm across Dean’s face, and bright enough that the first thing he saw was the lurid red of his own eyelids. He let out a sigh. The grass he was lying on was the perfect texture, not scratchy or damp or slimy.
“You’re...here to stay?” Dean said slowly, his tongue heavy and slow in his mouth.
She made a face. “You’ve been dead, like, two weeks. It took forever for us to get your body back from the feds. The real ones.”
“Sort of,” Dean said. “You’d be surprised.”
“I—the metaphysics of existence were damaged badly in the aftermath of Jack’s ascension,” Cas said. Sam shifted, crossing his arms, and Cas winced. “It’s not an excuse, it’s just...time passed very quickly. I thought it had been two, maybe three years, and I...I told Jack that we needed to find another way for me to help.”
When Dean huffed, Cas shifted lithely up onto his knees, settling to sit on his feet in the middle of the bed. He was so—so un-self-conscious about the way he moved. Doing what felt right. What felt good. What he wanted.
Dean unlocked the door and stepped in. “So they said—”
“I know,” Cas said, and Dean blinked.
Cas nodded. “I told Jack he has to visit often and update me on what he’s doing, to make sure he’s not ‘losing one of his marbles,’ as you might say.” Cas’s fingers quirked through air-quotes, and Dean's breath caught in his throat. “And I know it doesn’t count for much, after leaving for so long, but…”
“That’s wasteful.” Cas took another sip and Dean looked up at the ceiling. It was water stained and yellowed, large rectangular, pockmarked white sheets.
Dean sighed. “Listen,” he said, glancing at her nametag, “Maria. I may be tired, but I’m not blind. There’s only one bed in there.”
Cas reached for Dean now, his hand palming Dean’s throat and nudging Dean’s chin to tilt into Cas.
“I’m just...thinking about Cas,” Sam said hesitantly. “And Jack.”
He opened his eyes again. One more glimpse—from so close. Closer than he’d allowed himself in years, since back when they were both still unfamiliar with that sharp, constant tension between them and had let it drag them too-close so often.
“Hey, wait,” Dean said, reaching for Jack’s arm but pulling his hand away before he could touch. “You’re the new God...does that mean you’ll be...pulling the strings down here? Writing our story?”
This is only sort of an ending. I plan to add a little sequel fic with more fluffy now-that-Cas-is-back content (what's that guy Thomas up to?? When does Dean get to go to a beach??), but it seemed like tone-wise it should be separate from this (which very much accidentally ended up being angsty).
“No, Cas, you know what?” Dean said. He pushed himself upright and jabbed a finger in Cas’s chest. “That’s bullshit. You and I both know I was always meant to go out this way.”
“Well, yeah,” the librarian says. “Laptops are just portable computers, man.”
Charlie hummed.
His lungs were starting to burn, and he breathed in deeply, dragging in air through some sort of barrier. He shifted his head and felt his skin move against something rough, some kind of fabric.
Then, in the dream, he opened his eyes. Light glimmered off tiny ripples in the water in front of him, shading against the impenetrable dark of the lake at his feet. His boots were laced perfectly, like someone had knelt down and done it for him without the brutality of his usual triple knots. His jeans were sun-soaked, heat lamps pressed up against his legs, and he had to squint against the brightness of the sun in the cloudless sky. He’d been here before.
“Oh, god,” Dean muttered, throwing his head to the side. Some small, still-thinking-coherently corner of his brain fixated briefly on the bedroom door that hung open and said
“Cas,” he muttered, striding past the edges of the pie festival and pausing at the edge of an empty field. It was easier to—talk out loud. Made it feel a little less crazy, even if being a random man talking to himself at a pie festival looked crazier from the outside. “How are you in my head?”
He first stumbled across humanity in a church, a behemoth stone thing adorned with crosses, colored glass leeching across the walls. There were hundreds of the creatures kneeling, some kneeling in rags, others kneeling in colorful robes that spilled across the gray floor.  A man adorned with an extravagant hat and robes stood at the front before the prostrate crowd and spoke to them, his voice growing in a crescendo before sinking slower and quieter, a ritardando and decrescendo. The humans listened, rapt, and seemed to worship the man as he spoke of “God”. Castiel did not understand the concept at the time, and it took him many more experiences to learn of what the word meant.  He witnessed wars and genocides over the word, but understood only when he slid into a building full of sick humans and found a woman crying out for God in her deathbed.
“You know, if you could come to Earth, you could wipe out a nest like this in ten seconds flat,” Dean said, a warm
“So, Benny?” Sam said finally, as Dean swallowed his first bite of burger.
“That tiny couch?”
Dean pressed a kiss to the corner of Cas’s mouth. “You can have me,” he said, barely more than a whisper. He kissed him again; their mouths fitting against each other softly; simply. Cas’s hands finally moved, reaching around Dean to hold him tighter; hold him like nothing in the world could make him let go. Not again.
Dean realized their faces were closer together than...than he really got with anyone. This was like, borderline
“You saw them?” Sam asked, his eyebrows shooting up. “In heaven? You went to heaven, right?”
Dean watched him head for the garage. Part of him wanted to rush after him, tell him which ones were off limits, but it wasn’t like he’d ever drive them. He had the impala. They were nice cars; beautiful cars, tempting cars, cars he’d never driven but maybe would’ve liked to. But they weren’t the impala.
“What about you?” Charlie asked encouragingly. “You said you were looking into jobs as a mechanic?”
“Can I get a Sam Adams, please?” the woman said as the bartender drifted over to slide Dean another drink.
that.”
He swallowed, sliding his hands along his face until they were clasped at the back of his head.
“What are you doing over here?” Sam asked.
Dean shrugged. “It’s weird,” he said.
“Above your head,” Cas said, and his hands suddenly dropped away as he stood up straight again. “Grab the sheets—like that.
, like crunchy peanut butter. “You had that same creepy trench coat on, and then you disappeared.”
“Who did?”
“I’m going to bed,” Sam said. “I want to get an early start to—”
Sam threw up his hands and muttered something. Dean was pretty sure it was something along the lines of ‘fucking profound bond.’
"Curiosity killed the cat, Cas, just drop it."
“I think you should get on the bed,” Cas said, and he turned them around, manhandling Dean with a heavy hand pushing at his hip and a hard shove until he was sprawled on his back, staring up at Cas.
“Go to bed, Sam,” he said.
"Why are you so angry at your brother?"
“You stared at us in a Biggerson's last week,” he says, his voice creamy with just a crackle of
“Whoa,” Benny said, pushing Dean back. “You alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You look chipper,” Sam commented as Dean shuffled into the kitchen in the morning.
He threw open a storage room door and was already jerking away to keep moving when a flash of beige caught his eye.
“Can we—” Dean’s voice came out hoarse, and he cleared his throat. He’d never seen Cas stare at him quite like this before. It wasn’t the salacious hunger he’d seen in 2014, or the cold curiosity or disdain from those early days, or the fondly inquisitive stare Dean had grown accustomed to. It was something else, and Dean’s chest was full with it, warm and dizzying.
Sam’s face went through the five stages of grief, and Dean bit his lip, fighting a smile. He probably oughtn’t to keep gaslighting Sammy and making him think he was either imagining things or make him think he was quickly losing his brother to complete insanity.
“Even though you piss me off,” Dean said. “Even though you...left. Left me. I know it’s not gonna go away. Even if you forget to ever come back.”
stupid. Ridiculous.
So he nursed his drink, staring down at the patterns in the wooden bartop, and listened to the drivel people kept playing on the jukebox. Tonight it was a whole lot of Taylor Swift, which he wasn’t too mad about but it just wasn’t hitting the spot.
still.
. Dean was stumbling as he fought it, and he only barely registered the sound of the barn door opening again and Eileen’s feet hitting the floor to his right. Sometimes it felt like the only time he could get a clear head was when he was fighting something—that was always when he could suddenly think things through without getting caught up on stupid hang ups.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Dean said. “No. You always assume I don’t—I don’t care. But I do. You said you couldn’t have me, but you can. You can.”
“And what, take them to somewhere we think is safe and just hope?”
“I can see it in your eyes,” Charlie said, leaning forward over the table to squint up at Dean. “Go pray. Never thought I’d say that phrase, but do it. Go pray to your gay angel lover. Never thought I’d say that either.”
“And yet here you are,” Dean said faintly, raising his beer slightly again.
He took a deep breath and walked back past Eileen’s room, peeking in quickly to see that the couple was peering down together at the baby that slept in her arms. The fire under his heels snuffed out and he found himself standing there, staring, feeling heavy and lost.
“Tell me something only the real Benny would know,” Dean said.
“Please, be my guest!” the old man exclaims.
“It’s a lot,” he said hoarsely. “I’m afraid...”
Dean glared and touched a hand to his reddened lips, still breathing heavily. "Not exactly," he said, licking his lips absentmindedly.
“Eileen found it,” Sam said. He pointed at something written in jagged, brown ink. Probably aged blood, Dean figured. It was always blood.
“Or,” Cas said, his chin lowered as he stared at Dean. “Is it that you just want to feel...something.”
, and his hand held Dean’s hips upright, kept him flush against Cas.
“Dean,” Cas said. “I would face the wrath of heaven and hell if it meant I could be near you for a moment.”
Sam walked straight to the big table in the bunker and sat down heavily. Dean trailed after him and sat across from him, turning the bag over to dump out wrapped burgers and boxes of fries. He shoved some of it at Sam and unwrapped one, trying to act like normal-Dean, the Dean that Sam knew, even though his hands were shaking a little.
If Cas, or Jack, wanted Dean to have a friend around, then so be it. By the time Dean woke up, he knew what it was he wanted. Purgatory had been strangely good, strangely pure, and if there was one thing he knew, it was that he and Benny had been a goddamn dream team of monster slaughtering.
He shakes his head and leaves, moving to a new hotel. He sits down on the bed, staring down at his hands. He doesn't understand anything he has experienced, from the electronics store to the alleyway, and he feels strangely emptied of emotion and comprehension.
. Unless he’d—unless he’d known for years after seeing it in Dean’s memories somehow, as an angel. It wasn’t like Dean had ever worn anything like that since that incident with Rhonda all those years ago. Or, well. It wasn’t like Dean had done so
“But what?” Claire asked. “If it’ll work, let’s do it. If the pattern we figured out is right, there’s gonna be another family dead tomorrow night.”
Six months passed in purgatory, and towards the end, it was eerily quiet and empty, so nearly every night they would lie together as Dean slept. Dean even stopped leaping away in the morning, he would just disentangle himself from Castiel and lie next to him, their sides pressed together until one of them finally stood up.
Charlie, all on separate occasions, before Sam could spit it out. Engaged. Every time Dean thought about it, or saw the ring on Eileen’s finger, or the barely-contained glee just under Sam’s every expression, it felt like he was getting injected with a touch more helium and drifting a little bit lighter on the ground.
, Dean,” Cas said, shoving Dean hard enough that he stumbled back. He smacked against something hard, but the feeling of it was bright and pungent in his nerves, like cinnamon and cardamom and not like real pain. He glanced down and saw the shiny black surface of the impala holding him up.
“What happened, Dean?” Cas said, nearly a growl. He stalked closer, looming over Dean where he was sprawled half-collapsed against the car.
“I’m plannin’ to go pretty far,” Benny said.
“Regardless,” Charlie said. “You can’t just drop the L-bomb and vanish into another dimension, never to be heard from again. That’s just bad etiquette.”
Cas nodded and shifted again so he was sat on the edge of the bed, his legs off the side. He was always moving now—adjusting, fidgeting. Effortlessly human, but still a little overly aware of his body, his skin.
“We will,” Cas said, and Sam let out a choked laugh at the 'we' before going back down the hallway, his footsteps thumping loudly.
"Dean!" he called, watching Dean's spine stiffen as he slowed to a normal paced walk before stopping at the car.
“Sammy?” he said, his voice hoarse. “What’s going on?”
Cas reached towards the bag, and Dean let out another tense breath. Did he have anything weird in the bag that Cas could find and blame all this on? Probably. He probably had condoms in there, not that he’d found any occasions to use any in years. Probably expired. He could pretend to be embarrassed about that.
Cas glanced over his shoulder at the wall. “It is,” he said. “I don’t know why...I needed to see that it was just a room, just a wall.”
“I, uh…”
“What?”
town, but that seemed to be immaterial to their sign makers.
“Cas?” Dean said. His feet felt like they weighed a hundred pounds. He took one heavy step down the stairs, one step closer.
How much time had passed before he managed to stand? The screaming pains in his hips and back—never letting him forget that he was no longer young—said that it had been hours. Had it? Or were the pains just his own body recognizing that he deserved pain and discomfort? Couldn’t even save the guy he loved? Couldn’t even—couldn’t even say the words that killed him anyway?
“Congratulations!” a man screams, and a little bell goes off before some singing starts and balloons careen from the ceiling. Castiel lowers his camera and stares, and watches the host of the restaurant hand a large check to two men.
“Maybe—” Cas turned back towards the couch, and Dean’s heart leapt into his throat.
The old man lets out an odd growl and the whooshing starts again, lasting only a few seconds.
Castiel was suddenly pressed into the side of the car, his back arching against the rounded angle of the side. Hands pressed against his arms roughly, fingers curling into his coat tightly. Dean's body was pressed against his, and Castiel could feel Dean's chest as he breathed. Their faces were close, not touching for just an instant before Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's, surprising him for a moment before he started pushing back into Dean, his hands finding purchase at Dean's back in the fabric of his jacket.
Cas smoothed his shirt down carefully, and Dean watched his hands drop back to his sides. Dean had wondered, when Cas was a stuffy, stick-up-his-ass angel in eighteen layers of business attire, what he was like underneath those jackets and shirts. Was he soft, like a human? If you touched his skin with cold hands, would it prickle with goosebumps? Would he be cold to the touch? Could he feel at all?
Dean smiled. Benny almost looked...nervous, looking up at Dean’s slightly-manic grin. He didn’t know what he was in for.
“Uh.”
"I can't," Dean said truthfully. "And I figure it's better to wait out the night in the car than to toss around in my bed and risk waking Sam."
“You’re not driving home, are you?” the bartender asked.
The dream started shimmering and sliding into layers of blurring and dust, and Dean awoke, blinking into the darkness of his room.
“Cas,” he said. “What the fuck is going on.”
He set the key down on the counter.
Then teeth dug hard into the meat of Dean’s shoulder, sharp and unyielding, and Dean cried out as sparks flickered behind his eyelids and pleasure punched through him.
Towards the front of one of the notebooks is a small section of notes on encounters with Dean- there isn't much to write, but there's a notebook dedicated to him nonetheless. Six pages describing the encounters, plus twelve pages filled with terrible sketches of Dean. The scratched lines and attempted sparkly eyes are a miserable failure at capturing Dean. One has managed to depict his mix of delicate features and masculine facial structure, but his eyes appear dead and far too small.
good. Maybe that was why he couldn’t bear to tell Sam—it would make it too easy for Sam to realize that Dean had nothing except for that one good thing. And it made him guilty to even think that it was the only good part. It wasn’t. He had Sam, he had Eileen, his niece, Charlie, so many people he loved. But the almost-having was like a bruise he couldn’t stop poking, and it was so much
“He told me he loves me,” Dean said faintly. Charlie trailed off, and part of him thought, no way she heard that. It came out lighter than a breath, the first time he’d let himself say it. But she was staring at him with the wide, fallen face of someone who suddenly understood.
“No,” Dean said. His fingers twitched at his side, and he dropped his hand from the gun at the small of his back.
“Just needed some air,” Dean said.
It's easy to slip back into the constant grind of flipping through Biggerson's like pages in a book. It barely takes any effort at all, really. Once the adrenaline of being chased into a broom closet wears off, the only driving force in Castiel's mind is the desire to find Dean again.
Charlie laughed. “No, I’ve kept certain details to myself,” she said.
So Dean shoved him again; the thud of Cas’s skull against the wall echoing in the pit of Dean’s stomach.
Dean picked at the label on the beer.
, the way Benny was leaning over him.
man, and he's smiling hugely, and his eyes aren't the same as the pictures, they're better- they're a olive toned, bright green, much better than the grassy color they take on in the photographs.
“Wait,” Castiel exclaims, stepping towards one of the screens. “Go back!”
“Nothing, just forgot to grab my gun.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the soft beige of the coat, the simple suit that had become so synonymous with Cas in his mind that sometimes when he was out on a hunt and saw a man with the right build in the right sort of suit, he almost had to sink to his knees just to stay upright at all.
it surprising? Were you not the one standing next to me when I acted like a damn fool because a Dr. Sexy lookalike was talking to us?’
“Oh,” the larger one says. “I remember when you told me about that...I thought you were hallucinating, Dean!”
“Oh,” Dean said, letting himself be gently pushed backwards until they were both sitting on the bed.
“Yeah, I’m fine.”
“You need a ride?” Dean said, turning around.
man narrows his eyes slightly.
“I—I don’t trust you,” Dean said, the words heavy as they tripped off his tongue. “And I’m—I’m angry. Really, really angry.”
He groaned, barely audible. “We’ll both fit.”
He cracked one eye open and saw just the same quiet room, nobody but himself.
“No,” Dean said. “I don’t...let’s stop. I don’t want to think about it. This is heaven, right? We can just pretend the last ten years never happened. We should’ve died together that day, we can pretend we did.”
“Dean, you’re in Harrond, Nebraska,” Charlie said. “Did you even know you crossed state lines?”
Dean shivered; something that started low on his spine and crawled upwards.
“What are you—I’m already dead, Cas,” Dean said. He gestured at his body. “The deed’s done.”
“Aw, you don’t have to let me stay—”
“Not him, either,” Cas hummed, and a second finger pressed beside the first, and Dean yelped. Cas’s other hand gripped his ribs tighter, hard enough that Dean knew he’d be bruised, pale blue ghostly smudges of fingerprints across his ribcage.
“You know, Cas,” Dean said as he halfheartedly made his bed. Miracle would muss up the covers anyway. “Just because you’re on prayer speed-dial now doesn’t mean you can’t drop by a dream or two once in a while.”
“It’s a pull-out couch,” Cas said dumbly. Dean felt a breathless laugh bubbling up from somewhere in his stomach, but it shriveled up and went cold by the time it got near his throat.
“He went in here?” a man asks. Castiel is certain it's Dean, it's the same golden-inlaid, gravel-strewn voice.
“I, uh. Heard from Jack a while back that you’re out of the empty,” Dean said slowly. He kept his eyes closed, but couldn’t help but listen for any shift in the air, and slight rustle in the stillness of his bedroom. “I’ve been...waiting for you, I guess. I figure you’re pretty busy up there, uh. Helping Jack. I’ve been...hunting, sometimes. Trying out a new way to cook steak.”
“Wanna tell me what’s lit this fire under you?” Benny asked, sounding half-amused and half-worried.
And he remembered Cas’s voice on the phone; the clanging weight of the stairs beneath his feet as he ran—all as sharp as a knife in the gut, twisting and twisting and twisting into the open wound Dean couldn’t figure out how to close, the kind of wound he'd never learned how to suture.
with humans, humans that didn't find it baffling for him to have disappeared.
“I know,” Dean said. It didn’t matter that it had been...a year? A year and a few months, maybe? Since he’d finally prayed to Cas, finally gotten at least to talk to Cas and see him in his dreams. Sometimes he’d still hear Cas make a comment and turn towards where his mind tried to pretend he was standing, or he’d hold out a piece of food for Cas to try and realize only when his hand hovered awkwardly in space that there was no one there to take it.
“I...yeah, I guess I was.”
“Did something happen?” Charlie asked finally.
There were other footsteps up at the door, and Dean leaned away, his heart thundering in his chest. It felt like ripping a part of himself just to look away from Cas and up towards the door. Sam was facing away, talking to people in the doorway, and Dean couldn’t help but smile at the idea of his little brother trying to protect Dean’s privacy. Or, actually, he wasn’t so much his little brother anymore, now that Dean was newly young, just barely past forty, and Sam was freakin' balding.
“Christ,” he muttered, and stalked over to the bed, throwing the covers back and sitting down. It was late already—eleven thirty. He huffed. ‘Late’ was a subjective term, after all. His alarm was set for five. He didn’t use to have to set alarms, but he wasn’t the same Dean he was back in the day.
“I apologize for being fascinated by you,” Cas said amusedly.
The young man reaches over his shoulder and starts tapping at the “keyboard” carefully.
“Sure thing,” Benny said.
Eileen nodded.
“I don’t need a straw,” Dean said.
“Seriously, dude,” Sam said. “What is wrong with you?”
“Tell me what you’ve been up to,” Benny drawled, holding out his beer to clink against Dean’s. “I’m sure it’s something good.”
The first night back in the real world, Dean found that he couldn't sleep. It was strange, to be unable to sleep in a warm, safe bed in a motel away from monsters. After trying to sleep for an hour, Dean got out of bed and left the motel room, glancing at Sam, who was sleeping in the other bed.
Dean blinked and took a step forward so he could lean against one of the chairs at the table.
“I don’t—” Dean gritted his teeth. The talking part was hard. “I never just wanted—that. I mean, don’t get me wrong, that part—that part’s great, but it’s you. It’s just you. It’s
Castiel feels horrified at this- Dean is certainly not dead inside, he can't be.
Dean laughed.
Dean pulled off his jacket with shaking hands, walking unsteadily over to set it on the chair with Cas’s coat. Seeing them piled together—something quiet and small in Dean crept further from its hiding place, something greedy and wicked and wanting.
“Does that line ever work?” she asked, grinning and twisting a finger through the ends of her hair.
“I was thinking, we were a pretty good team once upon a time,” he said. “Would you want to come on some hunts? There are still some, every once in a while.”
“Cas?” Sam asked, frozen at the door of the bunker.
after—after being like
Dean nodded. The wad in his throat was back, and he took a deeper gulp of water, almost draining the glass. Part of him wanted to say, ‘
“I'm a horseman, Sam, your power doesn't work on me,” the old man says, and Castiel frowns, not understanding again.
“Huh?”
“I do not have a home in which to store a television,” Castiel says.
“Hey, Jack,” Dean said. His tongue was woolly and cumbersome, like he hadn’t spoken in days. Jack turned, his eyebrows raised, face placid. That was the other uncanny part. Jack felt like a puppet now, even if Dean knew it was nothing but Jack’s own power and knowledge tugging him along.
The door creaked open, and Dean half-lifted his head enough to be sure it wasn’t a stranger creeping in while his guard was down. But it was just Cas, backing through the door with his duffle bag cradled in his arms like a bride. As he turned, lifting up the bag like he was about to toss it down on the nearest bed, he froze, his hands going tighter on the fabric of the bag, the skin at the edges of his fingers and fingernails bleaching pale.
“Gay?” Sam said, blinking. “Bi?”
“Okay,” Cas said, and he dumped his bag on the mattress above Dean’s head, one of the nylon straps hitting Dean on the forehead. “Sorry.”
“Nah,” Benny said, and headed straight to grab beers before Dean could say anything.
“It’s not bad,” Sam said, looking from beside her. He stared at the jagged post sticking out of the wall. “Could’ve been.”
It turned out the answer was age two.
"Cas," Dean said. "Can we leave this alone, please?"
Castiel leaned down slightly and whispered something to Dean, finally waking him. Dean sat up slowly, drawing away from Castiel with a yawn. He rolled off the bed with a loud thump and stumbled over to the donuts. Castiel moved to sit at the end of the bed instead, and nobody said a word for a long time.
Castiel watched Dean as he leaned into the seat, closing his eyes. It made him smile when a few minutes later Dean's head slumped to the side, revealing that he'd fallen asleep.
“You’re acting strangely, Dean.”
He scruffed the top of Charlie’s head—it was the closest he could get himself to a thank you—and went back to his bedroom. He sat on the end of his bed, tipping his head down, eyes squeezed shut. God, this was awkward. Maybe they were...better before. Pushing and pulling at this invisible something between them, but never making it real. Then again...
“Dean,” Cas said simply, looking up at him with an open, unguarded expression. Dean wasn’t sure if he wanted to punch him or run in the other direction.
His words trailed off, sticking to a leaden tongue.
“Even if I tell you to go?” Dean asked. He’d shoved his hands into his pockets, the sudden relief at seeing that Cas was still in the bunker turning his nerves fuzzy and leaving his hands shaking again.
Cas went easily, like he couldn’t just break Dean’s spine if he wanted to, and smacked into the wall Dean pushed him towards, his head throwing back slightly, bonelessly, as he reached the wall, and Dean’s hands were left hovering there, ghosting over Cas’s chest as he glared at the angel.
Dean shifted slightly closer—until he could feel Cas’s warmth; could feel the cold of his feet, the brush of his skin. He couldn’t help it—wanting. He’d imagined having—isn’t that what wanting is?
