." Sherlock husked into John’s ear and sucked the lobe into his mouth.
.’ and then tossed John into the back of the car, face down on his belly, quickly following behind and jumping in after him to straddle John’s hips, making sure to slam the car door shut.
"I did, very much. Thank you for that."
"Trust me; we’ve had more heats here from guests than you’d believe so I have an idea of what state the room will be in." Gary assured him, it didn’t ease John’s guilt.
When he was done preparing his ‘
are you doing here?" Sherlock called causing John to wince and shake his head in exasperation. That was his Sherlock; always the charmer.
"So you got it wrong." John pressed casually.
seen a hound, there was no mistaking it, he saw it with his own two eyes and his eyes had never and would never deceive him. John was the one with something wrong with him, John was the one making accusations and making out that there was something wrong with Sherlock and John... was only trying to help.
"You were taking too long so I got cleaned up in the pub bathroom. Hurry up and get out, you need to clean up too... and take our bags up to our room while you’re at it." Sherlock said coldly, not once looking at John. That was right, he couldn’t bond with Sherlock because Sherlock didn’t want to bond with anyone, especially John if the speed he took off at earlier was any indication. John nodded sadly and slid out of the car to grab the bags Sherlock had dumped on the ground, he tried not to wince when Sherlock backed away from him. As John was walking away he heard a loud hissing sound and glanced around to see Sherlock spraying a can of air freshener around and inside the car with his scarf held up to his face that he only pulled away to address John.
"Hi, I’m looking to book a two bed room for my friend and me." The big Alpha’s nose twitched and he looked at John knowingly, then his eyes followed Sherlock who was wandering about the place being nosey.
sink their teeth in and claim him as their own but when Sherlock’s teeth had gripped at that tender skin below his hair it was...
"Then
"Oh, I bet John here fifty quid that you couldn’t prove you’d seen the Hound." Sherlock taunted but Fletchers eyes never moved from John’s, he winked at the Doctor then jabbed a finger at Sherlock.
"Minefield? Technically Baskerville’s an army base, so I guess they’ve always been keen to keep people out." John hypothesized.
"That’s your plan?!
Half an hour later and the silence was deafening. John and Sherlock had avoided eye contact so far and apart from the occasional sigh or cough, hadn't made any sound. John wasn’t sure how much more he could take so when he saw buildings in the distance he did an internal happy dance, it wouldn’t be long now and then they could get back to being the consulting detective and his blogger.
That was another horrible mistake Sherlock had made, he remembered stepping into the bathroom behind John and catching sight of the damage he had caused in his anger and
"Oh! For the love of…!" It was a Foot. There was a foot on the table. A bloody foot! A bloody male foot on the table… and the toes were missing.
"That was you unconsciously sensing that I’m a bit weaker than normal and asserting your dominance by holding me down and scent marking me, it’s what Alpha's do when they choose a mate." He saw Sherlock twitch at that.
"Well? Aren’t you going to tell me that was amazing?" Sherlock asked smirking, eyebrow raised, he was wholly unprepared for the punch to the face.
"Fine." Sherlock gritted out and John licked a strip up his throat, pleased. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut at the sensation and John pushed him gently over toward the chairs they’d sat at last night to nudge Sherlock down into one before plonking his arse in the other.
"Can't help, sorry." He gave Sherlock a look that said he really wasn't though but it changed to expectant when he saw Sherlock suddenly straighten up a bit with an idea clearly forming in his genius brain.
"Maybe we should just look for whoever’s got a big dog." John huffed in the end and that’s when Sherlock finally spoke.
with the bloody milk?!" John groaned and rolled onto his back before replying.
"You’ve never been the most luminous of people, but as a conductor of light you are unbeatable. Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others." John scoffed and rolled his eyes to the sky, yeah, Sherlock was back to his old self, he supposed it should be nice but he hadn’t made up his mind on that yet, he thought on it as he and Sherlock stopped in front of the pub.
don’t want children." John slumped again, ignoring Sherlock’s shocked gaze.
"Wait, wait, what bet?" He asked, looking John up and down. The Omega in John was enjoying the attention and the urge to bare his throat was overwhelming but the
"Okay...okay..." John stood to face the smug Alpha smiling at him, then proceeded to retrieve the hidden cigarettes from under the skull and toss them to the prat, who just tossed them over his Shoulder.
"No need, I hired a car before we left the flat. The gentleman should be waiting for us with the keys." John stopped dead in the middle of the pavement and stared at Sherlock’s back wide eyed. Now, John could drive but he hadn’t renewed his license since he’d returned from Afghanistan so he wasn’t legal to drive and if the amount of money spent on cabs was any indication Sherlock couldn’t drive at all so who the hell would be driving?
scientific, laboratory conditions – well,
this afternoon I realized that the only Alpha I’d ever want to bond myself too was
"How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her?"
When John entered the pub he looked around curiously for Sherlock but saw no sign of the man in the main area, Gary spotted him looking around and pointed over to the little dining room with the fire place in it, John nodded to the man and made his way through, Sherlock was sitting at one of the big chairs in front of the fire with a brandy at his side, John frowned, that was odd, Sherlock never drank, still, John made his way over to join the man.
"Sherlock stop." And Sherlock did.
"Cabinet reshuffle?" John teased and Sherlock growled.
’ John may have developed from their little lapse of control earlier.
When Sherlock strode through ‘
would you feel to know that as soon as my heat begins, you will be able to sink your teeth deep into my neck and press yourself deep inside me, lock us together so that no one but you will ever,
?" Mycroft answered testily.
!!" He yelled and slammed the harpoon against the carpet to emphasize his frustration and making John wince from the noise before he looked down at the Omega and pulled his shoulders back to take on a dominating, Alpha stance.
people have.
John ruffled his hair and swung his legs over the side of the bed to sit for a moment before jumping up and heading for the shower, making sure not to take too long as he didn’t know how much quiet time he had before Sherlock came charging in again to either drag John off on this case or continue his moaning. After showering and getting dressed save for his trademark jumper John headed downstairs to the kitchen whilst trying to decide what to have for breakfast.
"I’ve read all the books, John. Not to mention the fact I could practically build one if I so chose." The man snapped and once again made a lunge for the pocket his keys were being held hostage in.
"Yeah." He sighed as if put upon, John couldn’t help looking over at Sherlock and raising an eyebrow, was this man serious, he’d kill for a place like this, Sherlock looked away quickly, unable to hold John's gaze, even for appearances sake.
"Holy shit! What is
"Yeah. Okay. Okay." John mumbled to calm his distress at Sherlock’s venom, sitting back in his chair and trying to relax. He had to relax, less the cramping he could feel in his lower abdomen get worse.
"No, nothing like that. Just curious. Have you seen it?" He persisted.
The Hardest Part is Always the Most Unexpected
"MINE!" He snarled and drove his face between the cheeks of John’s arse to lick and suck and nip and the Omega’s dripping hole, growling in pleasure all the while and causing vibrations to travel through John’s entrance making him yell.
"John?" Sherlock whispered when he notice the Omega’s breathing had evened out but there was no reply so Sherlock just wrapped his arms tightly around John and rested his cheek against the soft blonde-grey hair on top of the smaller man’s head, closed his eyes and sighed deeply.
', when an Omega began scenting for a strong, fertile Alpha to claim them.
"Jesus Greg! Little more gentle next time, yeah?" John moaned, rubbing the sore area, Lestrade just smiled and sat across from him.
Sherlock listened to John re-tell the story and felt guilty for how he’d acted at the time.
"Never are." Sherlock tilted his head to the side smugly and Fletcher narrowed his eyes and lifted himself up further into more domineering stance, John shamefully felt drool gathering at the back of his throat at the image.
never do anything to put our child in any danger, I will love and protect that child when they’re inside of you and I will do the same when they enter this world because that child will be
However on the other hand, his heat was close and he could feel his body preparing for the days he would be lost to his instincts, not to mention his hormone levels were changing and fluctuating at this stage so he was emitting a scent to draw in Alphas. That could only mean that his heat could come at any time in the next five days and if he and Sherlock didn't get this case solved quickly and without incident well...
! Can we not do this, this time?" Sherlock looked confused.
"Fine. Now how about I prove to you I can drive. If I can manoeuvre us out of the car park will you let me drive us to Dartmoor please?" John frowned at the suggestion but still threw his hands up and agreed.
"Finished?" Sherlock blushed, John giggled and they shared a kiss.
"Bloody hormones." He sniffed and folded the piece of blue cloth carefully and gently placed it back in its bag so it could join the others in the closet. John looked back at the closet door once more before heading out of the bedroom; he took that sign of that little scarf as a good omen that things were only going to get better from here on out for all three of them and he smiled in anticipation for what their future would hold
, I just want to care for you, please just let me." Sherlock pleaded, laying kisses on John’s face and down the side of his neck. John’s eyes closed for a moment before he nodded and turned his face back to capture Sherlock’s lips again and God, isn't that just gorgeous!
but he just couldn’t help turning his head and kissing Sherlock softly, The dark haired man hummed in appreciation and deepened the kiss, sliding his tongue past John’s lips and stroking along the doctors. John’s hands unconsciously started stroking the soft, pale flesh beneath them and shifted around to grab at Sherlock’s plump arse, Sherlock gave a filthy moan, proving that there was no way he could keep quiet. John was just about to pull back but Sherlock whined and ducked his head to bite at
"I found the footprints; they were-"
"Hm. At Buckingham Palace." John said in his ‘
“Oh Sherlock, I’m so glad you’re ok-“
Sherlock’s mind was completely ruled by domineering Alpha now and there was nothing that could make him stop... or that's what he thought anyway but then he wasn't expecting the little cry John gave when his left shoulder came into contact with the wooden frame and the now palpable stink of fear in the air. The loud growl that had been tearing through the air from Sherlock stopped and his eyes that had dilated to black cleared, he jumped back fiercely and John gave a sigh of relief.
. Then John had gone all pliant and lovely and started telling Sherlock all those wonderful things and just melted like hot chocolate to let Sherlock fuck his mouth; he hadn’t been expecting that.
"I knew something wasn't right! I've been feeling strange all morning! Why didn't you tell me it was your time?! When did it start?!" Sherlock yelled with a disgusted look on his face, John tried hard not to show his hurt at the look, he told himself it was just the hormones and not the fact that his best friend found a part of him, something he couldn’t control, disgusting.
.’ and most importantly ‘
"That's because I usually piss off to Harry's or to whomever’s I'd been dating at the time, for a week to run through my heat so as not to bother you with it and since you’ve never noticed I suppose it worked out quite nicely." John sighed, he was already fed up with this conversation so when he saw Sherlock start to open his mouth and held up a hand.
and left. When the door closed behind him John shut his eyes and took in deep breath, Henry's little question, appropriate or not, reminded him of a small flaw in Sherlock's little jaunt to Devon. John was due a heat in the next week and that could happen when they were in Dartmoor, where John couldn't just pick-up and take a thirty minute cab drive to Harry's.
"Shop!" Although, maybe the detective was just subconsciously acting like that because of the change in John’s scent seeing as he hadn't taken the birth control that morning, he hadn't seen the point at the time since he’d assumed he was heading back to London, Sherlockless.
couldn’t do that,
. John had always wanted children, he had always seen himself in the future with three or four kids wrapped around him and to have Sherlock’s children would be a dream come true but to his knowledge and by Sherlock’s own admission he
"I don't need those anymore. I'm going to Dartmoor." He said victoriously and then started to head out of the living room to pack some overnight things, this shouldn't take more than two, three day's tops.
"No." John answered shortly.
John had never been happier in his life and he loved Sherlock all the more for the gift of the heartfelt surprise, especially since he could later appreciate how hard that must’ve been for Sherlock to ask his brother for any sort of favour pertaining to his personal life. Mycroft hadn’t made it easy either, acting all high and mighty with his smug attitude and fancy umbrella regardless of the fact it was a special occasion. After all those smug looks and jibes about domesticity from Mycroft that had Sherlock nearly hitting the roof, John had made sure to show his
, couldn’t have come at a worse time. Harry was on holiday, Sarah had a boyfriend, all my other backups weren’t interested in taking me through my heat and you were, well,
"John?" Sherlock called, panicking when he noticed his mate’s absence at his side, he breathed a sigh of relief when John’s head popped around a corner of rails filled with baby clothes.
Just as they were approaching the door a military 4x4 pulled up and a soldier jumped out and addressed Sherlock.
! I’m on holiday, would you believe?"
"Really? You can't think of one recurring scenario that happens to me on a monthly basis?" He asked sceptically.
"Well, I hope not, Corporal, I hope not." He drawled.
"Sorry, Sherlock. My heat must be closer than I-" Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and hauled him forward, just managing to choke out ‘
"No, wait. What happened last night ... Something happened to me; something I’ve not really experienced before …" John scoffed, if last night was all Sherlock was going to explain himself for then John didn’t want to know.
"I thought that the drug was in the sugar, so I put the sugar in your coffee and then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore. It was all
"Too late! I already know and am in the process of deleting it vigorously, you and my brother doing half of what John and I were doing is enough to put me off eating for life." Sherlock drawled as he sat back down beside John, closer than he had before so Lestrade knew to keep his distance and he tossed an arm over John’s shoulder just for good measure. John rolled his eyes but leaned his head on Sherlock’s shoulder making the Alpha rumble out a pleased noise. Lestrade let out a groan both at Sherlock’s words and his possessive gestures.
"Well then, let’s get this over with shall we?" Sherlock called grinning and John grinned back and jumped in the car too.
smeared across it. Thankfully the little leather bag sitting on the counter behind the taps appeared to be clean and untouched but John was still wary as he manoeuvred through the mess to grab it, he was just about to turn and bolt back to the safety of the mattress when something silver that had been hiding beneath the bag caught his eye.
"No. That’s not right, is it?" Sherlock asked aloud his growl disappearing, he had been rotten to John all day, had been
"Mmm... 92.7% I think." John’s eyes closed at Sherlock’s sleepy drawl and he reached out a hand to open the door, only opening his eyes when he heard the door thump against the wall and...
"Do you want me to get some pain killers?" Sherlock asked but John frowned and shook his head, pushing Sherlock to lie on his back and then proceeding to drape himself across the other man.
The explosion rocked the entire area, debris was scattered all over the moor and four men stood and watched the whole thing with expressions of disappointment and horror. John was kind of stuck between the two, on the one hand he was horrified that Dr. Bob Frankland had just exploded into thousands of little pieces; on the other hand, he was disappointed and pissed off that the murdering bastard wouldn’t be punished for his crimes, that he got away with it, so instead of having to choose between the two emotions he settled for disgust since it covered all of the above.
John just focused on making his tea, minus the milk, and made a note to get some fresh shopping later before he shuffled into the living room to see if Sherlock had got today’s newspapers. He was pleasantly surprised to see that all three of his favourite papers were sitting on the arm of his chair ready and waiting for him to plop down and read them, seeing this, John had a moment of weakness thinking how thoughtful the tall Alpha was before he caught and pulled himself back from the instinct driven train if thought.
, John." Sherlock finished, blushing and on the edge of running away, the look on John’s face is what kept him grounded, the look of awe and, dare he think it,
.’ that’s if we don’t get shot." John mocked and grumbled, Sherlock was about to reply when the guard came back over to return the ID card.
"It's not in the rules!"
“Two seconds.” She assured him and Sherlock nodded, watching Molly quietly open the door and stick her head around, it was such a relief when she looked back at him excitedly and gestured that he head in. Sherlock gave her a grateful smile and slowly made his way into the room, afraid that is he wasn’t careful he might shatter everything.
Whilst he concentrated on the task of removing John’s shirt the blonde seemed content to just nuzzle and snuffle at Sherlock’s hair, however as soon as Sherlock had worked John’s shirt off from his Shoulders to rest on the bed sheets he was startled by a loud moan of relief from John and pulled back to check on him. John’s head was tossed back and the man was panting in quick short breaths, Sherlock just stared until John’s hand started pawing at Sherlock’s, trying to get the detective to continue his task of undressing him.
"Yes... No. Well I had an idea..." John mumbled, then jumped when Sherlock growled loudly and pulled him close.
"That’s his name." John told Sherlock incredulously. Sherlock had known Greg all these years and never once bothered to ask for his first name?
there something wrong sir?" Lyons asked and Sherlock maintained his dominate aura.
voice can only mean one thing. The answer is no Sherlock, not in Buckingham Palace.
He had just pulled a jumper over his red button up and was reaching for his jacket when he remembered to take the birth control pill. He took a pack from his bedside table and popped one out to swallow, slipping the rest of the pack into his jacket pocket, he'd need those if he was going to Sarah's when he got back anyway. As a doctor John found that Omega birth control was severely lacking, it would only be effective against pregnancy if you took it right as you were going into heat, that's why John always kept a pack of condoms next to the pills, you could never be too careful.
"We already
"Sorry what?" The blonde asked confused but went ignored.
"Not that it’s your business Henry, no offence but Sherlock, doesn't do,
"Because it's not actually possible for the victim to have done it Sherlock."
"So where’re we off to next?" He chirped and Sherlock didn’t know if he was happy or aggravated at John’s interruption, then again who knew what might have come out of his mouth.
? How could you be certain of something like that Lestrade?" Sherlock asked in a terrifying voice, although he feared he already knew the answer. Greg looked over at John for help and Sherlock took a menacing step forward, it seemed to be Greg’s lucky day when Billy chose that moment to bounce up to the bar.
because of this and that was just unthinkable, there was obviously some sort of misunderstanding here and he was determined to get to the bottom of it.
." If there was one thing Sherlock had learned it was that apologizing was painful, even if it was necessary, however he’d always make the effort for John. They stood there together for another moment before pulling back completely to get back to business, walking closer together than normal as they left the cemetery.
! Always been yours.... Always... Gouuhhh... please don’ sto’!" John panted shoving his arse rhythmically into Sherlock’s face as the Alpha ate him out. Sherlock’s hands shot out to grab John’s cheeks and spread them so his tongue could travel deeper into his little love but soon it wasn’t enough and he needed more so he brought his hand over into the mix and pressed two fingers into the loose opening up to the second knuckle so he could spread John wider and get
"Where’re you going?" John asked when Sherlock stood and put his cup on the table.

." Mycroft’s eyes narrowed.
"Don’t be strangers... and remember, stay away from the moor at night if you value your lives." The man called and John licked his lips. Sherlock could feel the growl starting to build in his throat but he absolutely refused to lose control again, it had happened way too often today, instead he swallowed down the possessive sound and pulled up his coat collar. Sherlock almost glowed with happiness when the movement drew John’s attention back to him and not the little piss ant Alpha, except that John was looking at him funny.
“John, Molly, take me to John.” Sherlock snapped, he didn’t mean to be rude, after all he owed Molly a lot but the only thing on his mind right now was getting to John and his daughter, Molly seemed to understand this because she didn’t take any offence and just nodded frantically at him before leading him in the direction of the lifts.
"No! I don’t want Lestrade, Sherlock, I want you. You’re my Alpha, just you, no one else." John soothed as he nuzzled his lovers neck, if there was one thing that surprised John, it was how aggressive Sherlock could be in regards to his ownership of John. He hadn’t expected a man who suppressed his Alpha instincts to be so, well,
"Three hours? Maybe four?" He confessed looking guilty, Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the expression shifted John gently in his lap so he could get a good look at the Omega.
’ as an Alpha should, and yet he was ‘
"Thought so." he sighed and Sherlock swallowed, moisture finally returning to his mouth from the shock, of course he didn't want a bond... or maybe. No. He
The good doctor was having a hard time keeping his amusement off his face and looked left and right a couple of times to distract himself, then his eyes landed back on his lover and he frowned and tried to glance around the sheet before looking off to the opposite couch.
John pulled back from his snuffling mission and grinned like he was high, that was the solution to all his problems; he would bond with Sherlock.
"JOHN! John,
It was another awkward silence in the car whilst Sherlock drove up to Baskerville, only this time the tension was much worse. When John had come back, sliding into the passenger’s seat and asked where they were going, Sherlock just ignored him and started up car that now smelled of ‘
"We, We’re not..." He tried, gesturing over his shoulder at Sherlock but when Gary looked at him oddly he just gave up and handed over the money, what was the point denying something that no one would listen to after all.
’" Sherlock growled firmly and the man nodded apologetically.
"Sorry. Hold on, I’ve got stuff in my toiletries bag for that sort of thing." He said before clambering off the mattress and standing, Sherlock had tried to pull him back but he ached all over and it was too much effort, he sighed grumpily instead.
"No, I’m sure what you’ve bought is just fine, I can see them when they baby uses them." John shrugged; he wasn’t really expecting Sherlock to be enthusiastic about that.
.’ and no more fear that John might finally get fed up and leave him. Sherlock’s eyes widened a fraction, he wasn’t actually considering-
This was intolerable, Sherlock was just one more coy smile away from stomping over there and punching that woman in the face and he didn’t give a rats arse
"Why, are you joking?" That set the Omega off, now he was trying to draw out Sherlock’s protective Alpha instincts by bringing up his deceased father and not trying to hide any upset or control his hormones indicating distress, it made Sherlock want to throw up at such a pathetic display.
"Can you
detest
tasks that under pre-bond circumstances he would’ve balked at and that was clearly agitating him. Still despite the never ending bitching, Sherlock had been a surprisingly affectionate and loving mate both in the privacy of their own home and in public, Sherlock had even organized a surprise
want him! He wanted Sherlock. Sherlock who was loyal, strong, innovative, resourceful and a freaking genius! And if John was honest, the best looking Alpha he’d ever come across. Any babies born from them bonding would be perfect!
"I wonder what set my heat off like that anyway. I haven’t had one like that since I’d just returned from Afghanistan and that was because I was having panic attacks. I wasn’t especially upset the other night... well I was angry about what happened but not distressed in any way so..."
Mind made up, John stood up slowly and started making his way over to the flashing light in the distance, this time without Sherlock striding by his side.
"He’s already carrying the next Holmes."
"Really? You really believe that?" Henry sniffed loudly, his spirit elevating at the kind words and John nodded encouragingly and then had a silly thought that he knew would cheer the other Omega up.
you inside me, now!" He strained and John’s eyes went wide but he nodded all the same, Sherlock reached beneath his pillows for the bottle of half-empty lube he kept there and John raised an eyebrow when Sherlock tossed it down to him .
"Same as living with him except now there’s orgasms and good God! What orgasms they are." John whistled and laughed when Lestrade went green, he decided that since he’s had a mostly lovely morning he’d spare the man any further teasing, providing Lestrade did the same of course.
"So, okay, what have we got? We know there’s footprints, ’cause Henry found them; so did the tour guide bloke. We all heard something." John elected to leave out Fletcher's name so as not to aggravate the man but frowned when Sherlock let out a shaky breath.
"Please, John,
"I see, and Mr. Holmes is an Alpha. I knew that the moment I walked into this place, how can you both cohabit so easily without, uh, well
"You don’t have to, I think it’s lovely and our child will love it." Sherlock swallowed and blushed.
As far back as John could remember, he could never recall submitting so quickly and easily to anyone, he had always fought against the Alpha trying to dominate and claim him, this was why he had managed to stay unbonded for so long. He’d never trusted an Alpha to
." Henry snarled and got up to leave, Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him, the ignorant bastard, how dare he ignore John, it was a valid question.
"No Sherlock, the question is: What the fuck are we still doing in this bloody pool?" John asked then started giggling hysterically, Sherlock looked down at John concerned and padded over to help his friend up but when he reached his hand out John jerked back and fell out of the crouch he was sitting in.
After he’d hung up, Sherlock glanced at John, sleeping peacefully beside him, warm, safe and most importantly; alive. It was in that moment that Sherlock realized, he nearly lost this man tonight. This incredible, kind, loving, glorious man who had infinite amounts of patience with Sherlock for things that normal people would have committed murder over by now.  This man, who only knew him for a day, yet shot a murderer to save his life, this man whom he had thought had betrayed him when he first walked into the pool. This man that
John, hearing footsteps, looked up and his face fell when he saw who it was, he didn’t have time to deal with another one of Sherlock’s mood swings right now, he had to catch a train due in an hour and he still had to get his things and call a taxi, he stood up from the monument he was sitting on just as Sherlock cleared his throat to address him.
"No." Sherlock drawled, they both turned to look at the other and burst into hysterical giggles.
.’, ‘
"It’s me. It was me. I’m sorry, Gary – I couldn’t help it. I had a bacon sandwich at Cal’s wedding and one thing just led to another..." Sherlock smirked behind the man’s back and Lestrade looked off to the side to hide his own amusement, it would be terribly unprofessional if he didn’t. When he looked back over at Billy it was with a face of incredulity.
"Then we can go home and have sex on the couch?" Sherlock asked hopefully and John blushed, thanking every God in creation that the hallway was empty, this was one of the downsides to Sherlock’s newly discovered libido combined with his lack of social cues but still that addictive personality his mate had could also be very satisfying when the need arose... especially since the need arose quite often. John cleared his throat to chase away the filthy thoughts that were clouding his mind and braced himself from the massive blow back of bursting Sherlock’s bubble.
"Oh yes I do! You were using
Because
"Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it." John stopped and turned to face Sherlock curiously.
"What is it John? What’s wrong with you?" Sherlock growled frustrated that he couldn’t help his partner.
"You were expecting us?" Sherlock asked suspiciously and the Omega flicked his gaze between him and John.
"I’m sitting here in nothing but a sheet and all you’re tempted to do is lift an ashtray?" Sherlock teased and John looked at him and blushed. That was when Sherlock got the most brilliant idea, he had only meant the comment as a joke but as he did mention it and since they’d been sitting on their own for ages now with no sign of anyone coming, why not?
"Oh! Sherlock you nearly gave me a heart attack!" She gasped jumping back; Sherlock rolled his eyes at her and apologized quietly.
"Enjoy that?" John asked sounding a bit rough and Sherlock let out a huff of laughter.
"Mean anything to you?" He asked gesturing to the words written in his notepad, Sherlock looked as if he wanted to say something else but held his tongue, sticking to the case.
NO! Sherlock’s eyes went wild and feral at the thought, there was no way John would let himself be bonded to another Alpha, he had told Sherlock that not five hours ago but then... John might not have a choice if the Alpha was dominant enough. The growl vibrating through the room at the thought was utterly terrifying, and the Beta couple in the room next door fled from the sound of it, Sherlock heard them but he didn’t care, all he cared about was John and John was missing because Sherlock had made one
"... Then the next morning Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of forced entry...Ah! What am I saying? This is brilliant, phone Lestrade, tell him there's an escaped rabbit." John looked at Sherlock like he'd finally gone mad and to be honest there was a good chance that was true.
. It wasn’t John’s fault about what happened, not really, the poor man couldn’t control what was happening to him but still who else could Sherlock be angry with?
"Bugger." He groaned then grabbed John by the front of his jacket and tugged him over the seat to sit in Sherlock’s lap.
"What happened there?" John panted.
"You were gone a lot longer than expected." Sherlock mumbled.
"You know what I mean." John once again went back to his food but a curious look Sherlock didn’t like came over his face as he took a bite, Sherlock ignored it in favour of taking another sip of his coffee.
"Think I might have taken care of that already." Sherlock snorted at John who went back to his food yet again and caught sight of Gary out the corner of his eye filling up another couples drinks. The man gave him a nervous glance when he caught Sherlock looking, the detective could see from the scuff marks on the inside of his left shoe that he’d been in to see the damage they’d done to their room. He bet the man was sorry he didn’t take up John’s offer of paying for the damages.
"None of the cabs would take me." He replied and then dashed off to wash up, leaving poor John gaping at where his flatmate stood seconds earlier.
or Cluedo." John's heart stopped. Not Cluedo. Not again. John slammed the laptop shut and stood up to put it on the desk.
"Do you want me to help you with that?" Sherlock asked as he approached John but the little Omega just smiled and shook his head.
"Is there an Alpha back in London?" Sherlock asked softly still too relaxed from his Omega’s closeness and the soft huffs of breath against his skin to sound demanding but was pleased when John shook his head against the detective’s neck.
"It’s not true, is it? You haven’t actually seen this... Hound thing." He grinned in a friendly manner and Fletcher turned to regard at the other him suspiciously.
"Even if the rest of the village and Britain don’t know you and your dad aren’t crazy, the most important person that counts does;
." John begged and pleaded with Sherlock through his eyes, the detective just nodded and smiled at the doctor before rising to his feet. John attempted to follow but his legs weren’t ready for it yet and he stumbled, he would’ve fell back on his arse if it hadn’t been for Sherlock who grabbed him and held him up, one arm around John’s back, one locked across his waist.
It was big! 7" if John’s calculations were correct, that meant 11.5" during a heat including a knot. John stroked up and down the gorgeous length so he could admire it a bit longer, then just lunged forward and swallowed it down in one, Sherlock howled and shoved a hand in the back of John’s hair pressing the Omega down and choking him. It wasn’t the first time this’d happened to him so he’d built up a bit of a resistance to it, it seemed to be an Alpha kink; even female Alphas did it, in a manner of speaking since they
"JOHN! WHERE ARE YOU?" Sherlock called from his the living room, frightening the life out of John who was just outside the door.
!’ and it didn’t matter that Sherlock probably didn’t realise what he was doing, this was just what happened to Alpha's and Omega's in and around heats; primal instinct just took over.
to. It was an experiment." John’s eyes went wide with rage.
"Too bad. Did you get any information?" John smiled a little and glanced over his shoulder but kept walking.
"I was terrified, Sherlock. I was scared to death." John continued quieter but still furious, Sherlock wanted to hug him and nuzzle at his hair but he didn’t think his pregnant lover would appreciate that right now.
Washed, bandaged and dressed in some fresh clothes, Sherlock and John made their way downstairs where they were greeted by a smiling Gary.
just made me admit to something I’ve been denying since I met you. Now I don’t expect your reciprocation so don’t worry. You don’t want any kind of bond anyway." The last part came out unintentionally sounding like a question and John took Sherlock’s shocked silence as an answer and smiled sadly.
’ and what his ‘
So in honour of me finally writing the next part of this series I’ve actually gone through this and tweaked it a bit. Sometimes sorting out my own mistakes and sometimes adding bits here and there, either way it’s still the same story just a little… remastered shall we say ^^
"Yes you did, don’t you remember when you-"
"I didn't know, I noticed." Then he started rattling off his deductions to the startled man who was now sitting back down, John tried to stop Sherlock from showing off but was unsuccessful and despite the fact that he tried to stop Sherlock, John still look amazed when Sherlock had finished, Henry did
"That’s so cheesy John." He cried out with mirth and John joined in.
"Yes, thank you-"
Sherlock released the back of John’s head so the man could pull back once he had finished and John climbed up into his lap to place kisses and licks all around Sherlock’s face and neck whilst running his hands through ebony curls.
"Your ID Showed up straight away, Mr. Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security.
"Um. We aren’t quite sure, can you book us up for three nights? We can always book an extra day or two if our stay goes well." Gary nodded.
Sherlock had let himself doze lightly, fingers never stopping there stroking motion through John’s hair all night and only reopened his eyes when the sun had begun to rise. He thought about it long and hard for about a half hour before he decided to slip out of bed, get changed and leave, he didn’t want to but he knew John too well. If John woke up cradled in his arms after last night’s fight he would punch Sherlock’s lights out and on the verge of heat or not, would
"So, you believe him about having the dog destroyed?" Lestrade asked, trying to change the subject and stop Sherlock from getting all protective.
Sherlock pouted at the text and glanced back up to Dr. Mortimer, She was a Beta, average looking but definitely John’s type, Sherlock didn’t like it but he sent a picture of her to John nonetheless, after all, when John turned up to schmooze her, Sherlock would be hiding in a corner out of sight, making sure she kept her dirty Beta hands to herself.
Sherlock sent the text as quickly as he possibly could and grabbed his things and car keys, practically flying down the stairs of the B&B he was staying at and barely managing to get the car door open of his Audi before jumping in and tearing off in the direction of the field Mycroft had told him his transport was waiting in. Sherlock’s hands trembled on the steering wheel and he was panting in quick rapid breaths, he wasn’t sure whether he was excited or terrified but that didn’t matter at this point, all that mattered was getting to the field so he upped the gear and slammed his foot on the accelerator, thankful for the long stretch of empty road he was traveling on.
"Sherlock! You stop that, you’re going to ruin your teeth love, now what can I do for you?" The old lady mothered and Sherlock cleared his throat and gestured to the bags at his feet.
He had found a way to control his instincts so no more incidents of dominance took place, however it seemed that Sherlock had miscalculated his instinct as a
"Henry’s right." John looked at him.
’ like on the telly?" Sherlock gave an internal scoff at the DI’s poor attempt at a cover story, did the man really think that if he kept on pretending he was here by some sort of coincidence, Sherlock would believe him? Did he honestly believe Sherlock was stupid?
"No you don’t."
was he angry? Because he was confused, he was being pulled back and forth by his own mind and because he couldn’t decide what he wanted, John had paid the price, paid the price for only being who he was. Although, when he had wrapped his arms around John’s body and pulled him against his own, he hadn’t been confused, it was the first and only time in his life he had willingly given into his instinct to protect any Omega in distress and why? Because John was
children was repugnant.
"Told me what?" Sherlock smirked again and gave Lestrade a positively evil look.
"That’s an
After thinking really hard, John knew what he had to do, tomorrow he’d go over to Henry's and apologise to the man, tell him that Sherlock was on his own and then head up to London, back to 221B where he could suffer in peace, by the time Sherlock was back in London, John’s heat would be over. As John was sitting on his knees, trying to calculate when he’d get a train back home a flashing drew his attention out the corner of his eye, John looked up curiously, someone was signalling again! Maybe John could go and find out what the UMQRA business was all about before he left, maybe he could give Henry something of use before bowing out gracefully.
"You go on ahead Henry, we'll follow later." He instructed to the man behind him who was even more confused than before and looking up at the door the detective just left through and scrambling to his feet.
A dark head of curls flew back against the cushioning beneath it and the owner moaned loud and proud at the burn in his thigh muscle, he loved the feel of  the burning stretch, combined with the feel of John’s cock it was just heaven. It didn’t take long for them to work themselves back up to the edge and John’s hand flew down to start tugging at Sherlock’s cock. Only another ten seconds past before Sherlock let out a shriek and blew his load up the side of John’s jumper, the rhythmic twitching and clenching around his cock set John off a moment after Sherlock and the man beneath him sighed at the feel of John’s hot come filling him up. Sherlock’s leg that was suspended over John’s shoulder fell to the floor when John pulled back to sprawl in the space behind him, somewhat mimicking Sherlock’s position.
"How? Can’t pull off the ID trick again." John asked, Sherlock smirked at him and hit dial before lifting the phone to his ear.
’ and he didn’t like it. Not one bit.
“No Mycroft?” Sherlock asked once the car was in motion.
"So what are you still hanging around here then?" John asked, changing the subject.
"John, stop." Sherlock growled, when the man tried to tug his hands away, John keened and flicked his eyes to Sherlock, looking suitably chastised and miserable. When John’s eyes locked with his he noticed the Doctor’s pupils were already dilated and this was worrying Sherlock, John had told him three to four hours until the beginning of his heat but the Omega’s pre-heat symptoms were happening too rapidly for that to be that case, he had to get John inside and now so he could find out what was happening.
??////
"What now, then?" The posh man asked nervously and John honestly didn’t know, with all that had been going on today he hadn’t really been paying attention to the case, he supposed he should feel bad about that but... well. He did remember Sherlock saying something about a plan when they were talking to Fletcher though so he’d go with that.
"No." Sherlock snapped and John tilted his head, confused at Sherlock’s sudden aggressiveness.
The guests
"Can you hold onto me so I can get us out of the bath?" He asked the man and John hummed an affirmative and gripped onto Sherlock as tightly as he could, which admittedly wasn’t very tight at all but it would suffice. Sherlock made sure his hold on John was firm and then slowly stood up to step over the rim of the bath and carry John back into the bedroom to lay him on the bed. Once he was certain that John was comfortable he pulled away to head back to the bathroom but was stopped when John’s hand snapped out to grab his wrist.
"John’s pregnant." All that could be heard in the building was a dull thud of a rather pricey umbrella hitting the floor, Mrs. Hudson’s cries about her carpet being ruined by a stream of tea that had flew from Mycroft’s lips and the deep, rich sound of Sherlock’s laughter.
"Right, get in and let’s go." Sherlock ordered and stormed back to the driver’s side and got in but refrained from starting the car until John climbed in after him, once John shut the door behind himself Sherlock cleared his throat to get the Omega’s attention.
’ as they walked up and down the aisles at ASDA. He was about to just sneak off and leave his husband to it having reached his limit but when he looked at John, he looked so happy, so content and so reassured that with Sherlock there to battle with the chip and pin machine he would be able to get the shopping done in peace for a change so the detective once again resisted the urge to phone Molly and tell her to prepare a body for a good whipping.
"Any time." The man replied and left John and Sherlock to head back to their car.
"Come On!" He called over to John who rolled his eyes and jogged over.
"John? What’s wrong? Are you injured? Did I hurt you?" The Alpha questioned, frantically running his hands along John’s body searching for any injuries his little love might have sustained, when his hands brushed over John’s lower abdomen the doctor gasped and grabbed at Sherlock’s hands, holding them there and moving them to stroke gently at the area.
To be honest it wasn’t even necessary for his Alpha to be here but Sherlock had insisted he go with John, proclaiming ‘
And he had solved a twenty year old murder about an imaginary hound.
genius. To show his pleasure for John’s quick thinking he leaned over and planted a sweet kiss on the man's lips, taking no notice of the choking noises that Greg was making. When he pulled back, John was smiling at him with a blush staining his cheeks, the shorter man turned around to hit the bell on the countertop, making sure to hide his joy at the fact Sherlock had just kissed him in front of another living, breathing human being, something he was convinced Sherlock would never do.
"It’s my heat Sherlock, it’s here." John panted out and Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“James Bond, Sherlock? My, my, John
’ had been telling him since they left that morning for the doctors was
"Not until you answer my question about the shopping. You and John sneak out this morning, disappear off my radar and then you come marching in with bags of groceries minus one pretty little ex-army, Doctor. So Sherlock,
That had been better than Lestrade and way more satisfying.
, just like that." John gritted out then buried his head against Sherlock’s neck to sniff along the white column of flesh. Sherlock frowned but did as he was told, moving his hands in soothing circular motions along John’s belly, this was fine for a few moments, in fact it looked as if John was recovering but then he felt the doctor tense in his arms and let loose a whimper. Sherlock, who was getting very worried for his companion, gently lifted up John’s jumper and Shirt to see if there was any damage but all he saw was toned, tanned flesh twitching and tensing in pain. When he rested his hands on the bare flesh to continue rubbing, John arched up and gasped loudly, the man’s skin was on fire.
"...Three times a day, tell your, friends, tell
"Sherlock! Please! Fuck me, breed me and give me your knot!" John cried and any control over the Alpha instinct that Sherlock had was tossed out the window violently.
"I'll take the case." He said and John's head shot up.
Once he realized what he was doing however, Sherlock jumped back and cleared his throat, avoiding eye contact with John and instead turned to pack away the shirt he was still holding, John sighed sadly behind him, he had been enjoying that but he knew it wasn’t right to give in to is Omega nature and he really had to let Sherlock know what was going on.
"Morning." John replied once they broke the kiss, Sherlock watched as John stretched, wincing at his sore muscles and the sting of barley healed bites and scratches being reopened from the movement.
." Henry apologised for his forwardness, recommended a B&B in Dartmoor called
Sherlock didn’t even dignify that with a response, mostly because he didn’t want to make a promise he couldn’t keep. The car had barely stopped before the staff entrance near the back of Bart’s hospital before Sherlock was out like a shot and running towards Molly who was grinning at him with tears in her eyes.
"There’s Baskerville." He said pointing to the buildings they had seen in the distance, and Sherlock glanced at them whilst John looked around.
"Oh Yeah? Then where's your licence?" John prodded and Sherlock pulled back and looked away, clearing his throat.
"No, of course not. What's that got to do with... that
"Can’t, I’ll come." John groaned back.
doing here?!" Mycroft raised an eyebrow at him and took a small sip of tea before replying.
"Very well, I need to get back into Baskerville, today and have unlimited access to the labs." Sherlock heard his brother choking on the other side and smirked at John as he reached his hand out to pull the man against his side so he could press his ear to the back of Sherlock’s phone and listen in.
?!" Sherlock hissed and John sighed, things were going so well, he nodded at Sherlock and braced his body.
"John, did you know your heat was going to start today?" He questioned suspiciously.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
smell that too but there is another scent beneath that one originating from here." Sherlock insisted as he sniffed and nuzzled John’s belly, John sat up on his elbows and looked down at Sherlock.
All Sherlock had done since they had left the flat was bitch about how unnecessary this test was, which technically
"Stupid idea, who's idea was that anyway?" John cleared his throat and looked pointedly at Sherlock who just narrowed his eyes.
"Sherlock, what was
"None at all. You’ll be fine once you’ve excreted it. We all will." He assured and John gave him bedroom eyes when he replied.
"Why didn’t you tell me then? Is it not my job to care for you when you’re in heat? Is there another Alpha? Is it
"So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?" John asked, Sherlock eyes left the departing figure of Lestrade and locked on John.
. You’ve nearly driven a man out of his mind." He snarled and then marched out of the place followed by John, Sherlock hung back to see the couple exchanging guilty looks and then proceeded to follow his companions out. When he got to the front door of the pub and looked out he saw John and Lestrade standing way to close and sharing a joke, his eyes narrowed at the image and he stomped over quickly to slide his body in front of John’s slightly, John sensing Sherlock’s discomfort at his closeness with the other Alpha took a step back, nodding for Greg to do the same.
“Love you too.” Sherlock replied to his unconscious mate and leaned in to kiss him gently on the lips before finally getting up and leaving the room as quietly as possible so as not to disturb John and Charlotte again.
"Mans or women’s?" John asked interested.
"I don’t do that." He said eventually as he opened the driver’s side door and just before John shut his he called out.

Conclusion, you finally notice that you haven’t taken any birth control since we left London and that there is a high probability that you are pregnant. Which you are." Sherlock deduced in his usual quick fire way, by the end of his speech John was no longer avoiding his gaze but staring wide eyed and open mouthed at his Alpha.
"Do what?"
things? Is that all you and Mycroft did because that love bite on your neck that wasn’t there four days ago had to come from somewhere." John ended in a singsong voice and watched with glee as the man blushed and cleared his throat.
. It really was a wonderful surprise to wake up to; Mycroft had even provided them with a pair of beautiful wedding bands as a gift and stood in with a still twitchy Lestrade as witnesses to their union.
"There." Fletcher shoved his phone into Sherlock’s face and Sherlock snorted at the perfectly, normal looking dog shaped blur, walking across the moor.
"Sherlock! Wha-" John never finished before Sherlock lips crashed down on his and he trailed off into a moan instead, Sherlock hummed in approval and deepened the kiss, pushing John back against the steering wheel and accidentally honking the car horn. They giggled at the sound and kissed passionately, grabbing at hair and biting along each other’s necks but always going back to the sweet press of lips, Sherlock was about to try his luck at getting John naked right this second in the car when the little Omega pulled back from the kiss to hiss in pain, startling the detective.
John hissed at the image he made and started looking around for some kind of soothing cream or balm Henry might have lying around, he was too busy looking through the cupboards under the sink that he didn’t hear the bathroom door open and close softly. The only warning he got that someone was in the room with him was the hot puff of breath of the back of his neck before two long arms surrounded him and pulled him back against a strong, lean chest.
“I miss you too but you have to close your eyes. You need to rest so you can look after Charlotte.” Sherlock tried to coerce and started stroking over John’s arm, John just gave him a sweet smile and turned his head towards his daughter.
"Oh! Listen, on the moor I saw someone signalling. Er. Morse, I guess it’s Morse." Sherlock started blinking rapidly as if to clear something from his eyes.
Grimpen for all its faults and off putting surroundings, like Baskerville and the prison, could be absolutely breath taking. Henry Knight had put it best;
"Why not?" John walked back to his chair exasperated.
"Yes Sherlock.... anything you say, I’ll do anything just don’t stop!" John’s eyes where clenched shut at the pleasure he was experiencing but it wasn’t enough, he needed that knot, his heat demanded it. John waited until Sherlock drew back before thrusting back in and pushed hard so he could flip Sherlock on his back and ride him. Sherlock obviously wasn’t expecting John to do something so dominant like that so naturally it pissed the big Alpha off but just as he was about to snarl and push John off he caught sight of his cock disappearing into John’s arse over and over again and instead ended up grabbing John’s hips to help him along, thrusting upwards against every one of John’s downward thrusts. John’s head fell forward as he bounced up on down on the Alpha beneath him who was hitting his spot with every thrust at this point and Sherlock wished he could see John’s face but the man was facing away from him.
, I’m Sherlock Holmes and I notice everything. You’re pregnant John. I’m not lying and I wouldn’t tell you unless I was 100% positive that I had all the data." John swallowed and fell back, Sherlock was right, he wouldn’t have said anything unless he was sure.
John looked up when he heard the front door open, Sherlock must’ve finished his packing which meant John had better hurry since Sherlock never had any trouble hailing a cab with his magic arm and most London cab drivers hated waiting. After one last check to make sure John had grabbed everything he would need for the week, he quickly snatched up his bag and started jogging down the stairs, noticing that Sherlock had left his bag at the bottom of the stairs just as he had asked so John could grab it on his way out, which he did as he strode out the door of 221B.
"Sorry but I only have three queen sized rooms left, would that be alright?" John’s eyes squeezed shut for a second but he nodded and gave a tight smile, he was
assistance whist I am able to give it to you, I won’t always be able to give you such luxuries Sherlock, enjoy them whilst you can.” Mycroft gave Sherlock one last pat on the Shoulder and turned to head back to his own car but stopped when Sherlock called for him, back still turned.
"Aren’t you going to invite us in?" Sherlock asked warningly when he sensed a question brewing and Henry swallowed and nodded.
"Listen; what happened to me at the lab?" John asked and Sherlock gave him an odd look before turning to grab a basket of sauces, trying to figure out a way how to explain that to his mate without it ending in him being neutered.
." Sherlock got a nip to his collarbone for that making him yelp, his skin was still sensitive there from John gnawing at it throughout the heat. The Omega startled at the sound and his head shot up concerned, he blushed when he saw the state of Sherlock’s neck and the surrounding area.
Sherlock proved he was in fact a very apt driver like he'd said and had them on their way in no time. It was the most awkward drive in history.
"Did you, er, get anywhere with that Morse code?" Sherlock asked and wasn’t that the greatest opening line ever. John huffed and started to march off, was this man actually serious?
"Yes." He chirped and Henry nodded eagerly.
"And why would you listen to me? I’m just your friend." John choked out sarcastically.
"Just go straight up those stairs and take the first left, Dr. Watson. You’ll come out into a sitting room that’s used for meetings." John nodded absentmindedly to the palace attendee, too busy looking around to properly thank her and began slowly ascending the stairs. He was inside Buckingham Palace. Bloody
"Yes. I remember." Sherlock replied hoarsely. John smiled at the Alpha and dropped to the floor, crawling forward on his hands and knees like a prowling lion to situate himself between Sherlock’s spread legs. Sherlock watched the Omega’s every movement and relaxed back into the big chair with a sigh.

Sherlock had hissed as the nails tore over his skin and all but snarled when John grabbed him, he shoved John down hard to the bed in an effort to make him let go but John gave a growl of his own and held firm.
"Eh, sorry we couldn’t do a double room for you boys." Gary said loudly and handed over the keys, John was never happier for a distraction in his entire life, he hated this part of his heat. All unbonded Omega's went through it, this sort of '
"Everything we did, all that I’ve gone through, it was all for nothing. He still got away with it and people still think my father and I are crazy fools, I’ve no way to prove them wrong." John firmed his grip on Henry’s jaw and tipped the man’s head up to lock eyes with him again.
"Well, hopefully there’s no harm done. Not quite sure what I’d charge him with anyway. I’ll have a word with the local Force. Right, that’s that, then. Catch you later. I’m enjoying this! It’s nice to get London out of your lungs!" Lestrade called backwards as he left and John smiled and made a point to buy the DI a drink once his heat was over, when he glanced back to Sherlock he was pleased to note that the man had relaxed from Greg’s departure.
Thank you to every single person who has supported this fic with comments and kudos and of course if you’re new to this then welcome  I hope you all enjoy this either way.
Omega and Sherlock was better than his base instincts so he pushed that feeling away and tried a different route.
"Nothing, just a passing animal molesting its mate. Now back to my request, look I have no interest in doing anything that’ll destroy your lovely army base but I suspect there is someone in there experimenting on the residents of Grimpen village so I need to get in there and run a little experiment of my own to prove my theory. I’ll do two cases for you?" Sherlock bargained and he could practically hear Mycroft thinking, Sherlock estimated at least two minutes and thirty seconds of silence so he gestured for John whom he was still holding on to, to hold the phone to Sherlock’s other ear. John frowned at him and did as he was told but nearly dropped the phone when Sherlock tipped his head back and dropped his own to lay a kiss at the skin just at his Shirt collar.
"Don’t be silly John, your arse is as perky as it normally is." Sherlock teased and chuckled when John growled at him and flipped him the V.
"You’ve got ID for Baskerville? How." John whispered breaking the silence at last, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief; it seemed that John was doing that thing where he pretended to forget when Sherlock had done something wrong.
Sherlock could have done without the blinding stream of sunlight that hit him square between the eyes, disturbing his much needed rest after four days of near non-stop shagging. The consulting detective groaned softly and squeezed his eyes tightly together as if that would somehow shut the sunlight off but all it did was cause little bursts of light to flash behind his eyelids to join in with the suns piercing yellow glow. Sherlock growled and gave up fighting it, opening his eyes and blinking rapidly ‘til they were used to the light and
"Are you alright?" Sherlock asked tiredly, raising his head to look at John now he had retained his rational mind in a momentarily release from his violent instincts. John’s head lolled back lazily so he could look up at his new mate in awe.
"Gosh! His symptoms are moving at some ruddy speed ain’t they?" Billy exclaimed from the door, Sherlock looked over at him surprised that he was still here; well he had a great opportunity and like John says ‘
John calmed down after a few minutes but he didn’t raise his eyes up to Sherlock’s, instead he just cleared his throat, his walls coming down to protect himself.
looking forward to this conversation.
"John, you’re my friend but I want nothing to do with this, do you understand?" Sherlock said coldly and John winced but nodded.
"John, it’s only me." Sherlock said gently but John wasn’t listening and his panting was getting heavier, now Sherlock was starting to panic, he had to calm the man down and fast or he might just fall into a panic attack. The detective fell to his knees softly and moved slowly towards John so as not to spook the already panicking doctor. As he got closer Sherlock could see that John’s eyes were unfocused and a keen sweat was building up on his still tan skin, clearly the man wasn’t all here right now, how could it have slipped his mind that John suffers from PTSD.
"Mm, another photo of you in the..." Sherlock groaned whilst John smirked.
"Mr. Watson-Holmes?" John and Sherlock both looked up at the small, plump woman who stuck her head into the door of the waiting room.
The confusion was overwhelming, his brain was shouting two arguing points at him and he didn’t know which one to listen to. On the one hand Sherlock had never been interested in bonding or heat, hell he’d never had any interest in
"You’re brown as a nut! You’re clearly just
"They’d be for sale. I mean, that’s how it works." John finished but then realised he hadn’t told Sherlock about the Morse code.
"Hey Sherlock!" John cried, the grin never once leaving his face.
"Got any proof?" Sherlock taunted and Fletcher scoffed at him and smirked challengingly making Sherlock growl lowly.
, in fact he was Sherlock’s
"Look John this is the only time I’ll ever say this but... I know I’m not the nicest of people; in fact I’m well aware that I can be absolutely abhorrent. I’m reckless, irresponsible, lazy, I can be downright disgusting when I want to be, I’m not the most affectionate human being on the planet and yet somehow despite all of that you’ve managed to fall in love with me and I you. You’re absolutely right to be wary of me taking on a parental role because you’ve seen no evidence that I can be anything other than a failure at it but I want to make something quite clear. I
Sherlock looked closely at his lovely Omega, his lovely
"We never speak of this, understand." It wasn’t a question but John nodded anyway.
"Yes. I know you don’t. As long as I don’t challenge you and we keep a safe distance, this won’t happen again. Promise." John assured and Sherlock nodded once.
the sugar." John said after swallowing, Sherlock knew what he was trying to and it wasn’t going to happen so he defended himself.
John groaned and snuffled into his pillow when he heard the high pitched chime coming from his phone, for a moment he contemplated just ignoring it and going back to sleep but after some considerable time thinking about it, decided against that option since it hadn’t paid off for him thus far in life so he reached over blindly and grabbed his mobile off of the bedside table. It took another moment before the lazy Omega bothered to open his eyes and lift his head from where he’d buried it in the pillow to read the text that woke him up.
Sherlock strutted down the corridor towards the room where Lestrade was like the cat that’d caught the canary, he was positively radiating satisfied smugness and why shouldn’t he be after that lovely little interlude John had provided him with. The dark haired Alpha was man enough to admit he went in there with every intention of pouncing on John and marking him in a way that meant no other Alpha would come near him again,
"I'm here! Jesus, did you have to shout so loudly?" He grumbled but Sherlock just ignored him.
insisted on knotting me anyway?!" John screamed.
"John-" Sherlock began.
"Funny doesn’t suit you. I’d stick to ice." John replied and Sherlock panicked inside, John wasn’t responding to him at all.
If you asked Sherlock how he had gotten up those stairs so fast, he honestly wouldn’t be able to answer you, all that he knew was, he was sitting downstairs contemplating this nightmare and the next his ear was pressed to his own room door, listening for sounds of anything untoward going on. When he didn’t hear anything, Sherlock gently eased the door open, stuck his head around it and breathed a great sigh of relief. John was alone, sound asleep on the left side of the bed facing the right, Sherlock slid his whole body into the room and closed the door just as gently as he’d opened it. He then toed of his shoes and tossed his coat and suit jacket over a chair by the bathroom door. It wouldn’t do to climb into bed like he would do a runner if John twitched.
"What are you talking about, you’re busy? You don't have a case! A minute ago you were complaining-" John started frantically, he really didn't want to have to run down to bloody Devon all on his own, especially with a heat so close but Sherlock interrupted him smugly.
"Sherlock, I’m serious. Not here." John gritted out, begging his raging erection to disappear. Sherlock pouted again and lifted his arms so he could trail his  hands up John’s belly and chest before wrapping around the doctors neck.
a sociopath after all.
"Are you still apologising for last night?" John asked gently and Sherlock got the most brilliant idea.
