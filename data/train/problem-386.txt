Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad. I am so sorry this chapter took so long to publish.
"You made yourself sick..." She frowns, trying to solve a puzzle in her head. "So you could go to hospital."
His name was Terrance Noland. He had worked a low income job and police found evidence of other robberies in his flat. But on that specific day, a little after five o'clock, he had robbed a bank and was being chased by three police cars. He jumped a curb and hit three people before crashing into a light pole. Without a seat belt, he was ejected from the windshield and killed instantly in oncoming traffic. Of the three people he hit, only one survived. After multiple surgeries, her broken leg would be usable, but her left eye could not be salvaged.
She had glared at him with such a look of hatred that he felt himself shrink. An angry film of tears brimmed in her eyes, but did not fall. He had never seen her shake with anger before, not even when he started using again after Mary died.
Sherlock once fell off the Thames bridge. It was a long way down, with time to think. But oddly, the only thing he could hear in his head was a high keening as he braced himself for impact. The landing was like hitting concrete, and knocked the breath from him.
Dr. Molly has to leave though. Her eyes and nose are pink, and she does not look at Mr. Mycroft. She kisses Rosie. "Bye-bye love. I'll see you soon."
The door won't open any wider. Something heavy is blocking it. She can fit her hand through the opening, and the first thing she sees are his bare feet. On the floor. She throws her shoulder against it, pushing hard and she hears Beebee groan.
Beebee is up faster than she's seen him in weeks and he grabs her arm before she can get away. He pulls her out of her chair and over his legs. He spanks her legs and she screams and kicks him.
He will be like a bright comet zooming through the sky. Daddy took her to the museum once and they saw all the stars in the sky. He will be the brightest one of all.
A part of Rosie wants to burst into tears. She's never seen Beebee like this. He needs a doctor. And normally her father would be his doctor, but he's not here right now.
ways one can die, after all. But the lives they led, the people they loved, the ones they betrayed, are always complicated.
Song eases back into the chair again. "There's not a goal of when we need to reach that. But it's a goal that we have. So when you feel like you're ready to leave, you have the tools to continue on your own."
sad because John - because your daddy's gone." His throat tightens. It is difficult to get the words out. "I thought I was alone. My brain was sick, and it made me forget how much I care about you, darling. I care about you so,
Bedtimes are hardest. Beebee will try to do it like Daddy did, but she can't snuggle with him for a story. He'll kiss her forehead and turn on the moon shaped nightlight. She has to have the nightlight and the hall light on, because she's started wetting the bed again, something she hasn't done since she was a little baby.
Sherlock covers his eyes and shakes his head. He does not want Mycroft to doctor him. He wants his doctor.
Something is wrong with his eyes. They look too big for his long face. He touches the bow and his frown softens. He bends down and picks her up. Beebee is all bones, not like Daddy. Daddy is best at snuggles in his chair. She said so, and Daddy made her go sit with Beebee because she hurt his feelings.
He doesn't expect her to answer. The heavy weight in his stomach lifts when she does. He is still not comfortable on the phone, but they talk for twenty minutes. He has never been good at talking to her about her more mundane interests, but it is good nevertheless to hear her voice. They ignore the more pressing issues, leaving that to a face to face meeting, which she agrees to more enthusiastically than he feels is necessary. He would prefer to text her, but he knows that will not be received well, nor address the issues properly.
Rosie rolls to her side and takes Sherlock's wrist between her tiny fingers. "I'm going to pick you now. You tell me 'No, I'm such a pretty flower!' "
"I've told them not to..." Uncle Greg keeps his voice low. "Anything you don't feel like doing, you know."
, and he supposes he is, compared to the boy in front of him. He, after all, can remember a time when Walkmans were still popular. Luis barely has memory of dialup.
Sherlock gulps and shuts his eyes, the darkness comforting for once. He has this. He curls into himself and presses his forehead on his knees. He still has time.
He finally shakes his head to the circle of eyes. His shame is his secret, not to share with strangers. Even strangers who may have done worse than him.
It thoroughly kicked my ass. I started writing this story about a year ago, and I got through the first two chapters fine, but this chapter, from Sherlock's pov, has put me through the wringer. I have edited, dropped points, re-edited, deleted scenes, and have generally been so dissatisfied with it that I've put off publishing it until now.
A blue bow with a flower in the middle. She smiles for real because it is such a pretty color. It's better than pink, because her cast is pink and she is sick of that color. She wants it off her leg. She tried to take it off a few days ago with scissors, but Nana caught her and spanked her. She is not allowed to handle scissors without Nana or Daddy present.
The cards tumble from Sherlock's limp fingers. Why? He was... they always did this. Always together.
The doppleganger tilts its head. "It's like flying," it says in a rough version of Sherlock's voice.
Mycroft pays her handsomely to visit him while he's stuck here. They hold his sessions in his room, or a cramped, artificial imitation of what a doctor believes a room is supposed to look like. Of course there is the squeaky metal frame, the thin mattress he is convinced is stuffed with newspapers, and a small bedside table. Everything is bolted to the floor. The window will open a few inches to let in a breeze.
She tucks a daisy behind her ear. "I complained so much to Mr. Wannop that he had a little gamble with me. A good sign. We used to gamble each other quite a lot in our younger years. If I take the poster down while I'm here, I have to leave him my china cup I nicked from Buckingham. My prized possession you know."
She stomps her foot hard, pain ratcheting up her leg, and he is blurry because she's crying. "I hate you!"
Sherlock bangs his elbow on the bottom of the tub. He has managed to contort himself enough so he's lying on his side with his knees tucked into his chest, but that leaves his toes under the faucet, which has been leaking for weeks now. He has attempted to patch it thrice now, and the drips stop for a day or two, but they always return when the flat is quiet.
His breaths start shuddering. He coughs again and more drool leaks out. Rosie strokes his hair like Daddy did when she gets sick. He feels sweaty, or maybe that's just the water on the floor. Her thoughts drift to darker images. Will his gravestone be black too? Would he want white flowers or red?
Beebee tosses the plate and fork in the sink with a clatter. It makes her jump and she knows she is making him angry, but she's even angrier. She crosses her arms and turns away from her plate, because if she looks at it any longer, she'll throw it.
The circle is silent for a moment, then the moderator leans forward. "There's an emptiness there, isn't there. How did you fill it?"
A few nights later, when she comes down for a glass of water, she hears Mr. Mycroft talking on the phone. He says Beebee's name. All traces of sleep flit away and she bursts into his office and pulls on his arm.
She twists her head around to try and grab her Beebee again but he is gone. She turns to Uncle Greg and wriggles. She can usually get put down if she squirms enough, but he's got a tight hold on her this time. If she was bigger, she could punch him and make him put her down. But hitting is bad.
Steam has fogged the mirror. Sherlock swipes a hand over it, revealing a reflection of himself that is years older. Age lines crackle across his forehead and eyes. Salt and pepper hair curls over the receding hairline. He squints and leans closer, touching his face at the same time as the reflection, confirming that it is his own. He almost looks like -
Rosie gets rainy days too. On those days, she doesn't want to eat, because food tastes funny. And she doesn't want to play anymore, no matter how much Dr. Molly tries to get her to. So she watches the telly, and colors. Sometimes she just sits with the crayons in her hand because she doesn't know what to color.
So Sherlock manically dove into the Work. Anything to keep the loneliness at bay, and his stash hidden.
He feels his stomach twist and thinks hard before answering. Even then, the explanation is clumsy. "I had to go to hospital because I hurt myself on the inside."
She is coloring when he sits down with her. Lestrade decided he would stay outside to give them time. When she realizes who it is, she goes unnervingly still. She sets her marker down.
It's so sudden and unexpected that she's not quite sure what's happened. A sharp smack to her right cheek, just under the eye patch. She blinks for a moment, her head snapped to the side. She raises her hand to touch the burning patch of skin.
He tilts his head back and closes his eyes. He would give his heart for a cigarette right now, anything to relieve the tight feeling in his throat. His chin wobbles.
Perhaps if he goes home, tomorrow will not come. It shouldn't. People living their ordinary lives, going to the shops, riding the tube, clocking in at work... none of it will happen because the world cannot possibly keep turning.
Later that night, long after the lights have shut off, Sherlock lays as flat as he can on the cold linoleum floor. John raises an eyebrow from the edge of the mattress, looking down at him.
The world keeps turning. The sun still rises. Cars vrooming down their street. People going to work. Dr. Molly and Uncle Greg visit on their days off. Rosie wishes her world would start turning again.
John sniffs and shoves his hands into his pockets. "That's all well and clever, but do I have to go to another funeral? I mean I did go to that fake one. Where you abandoned me."
He was given a way out, but he couldn't leave John behind to deal with the rest of Moriarty's mess. But now, with the world safe once more, only Sherlock keeps Jim alive, for these exact reasons, after years of trying to erase him.
Sherlock remembers her little voice, hurt, on the other end, hushed because Mycroft was certainly breathing down her neck the entire time.
Mycroft has dressed down. No suit jacket, and his vest is unbuttoned. Big Brother is not so informal as John though. Mycroft has not taken off his shoes in Sherlock's presence since they were children. Although, Mycroft never really was a child. Sherlock is convinced Mummy and Daddy found him fully dressed in a miniature suit in the dusty attic rather than actually birthing him.
Tears prick the corners of her eye. "I want my daddy." She throws her cup. It bounces off his hip and rolls across the floor. She doesn't see where it stops.
The eyes shimmer and shadows swallow the face, and the hands dissolve around Sherlock. Light breaks through the darkness. Sherlock reaches up towards it. He just has to swim.
Sherlock swallows hard and shakes his head. "Once, after I was admitted." Though he hadn't called to specifically talk to her, she just happened to be in the same room as Mycroft. She should have been in bed. Though he doubted Mycroft was keeping track of her sleep schedule, letting her run about the maison like a wild child.
, Sherlock corrects. Griefs. A grievance implies something to complain about that can be fixed. Griefs are personal, ones that drive a person to addiction or more severe methods of managing internal pain.
She wipes her thumb on her jeans and her mouth twists in a snarl. "Losing a limb." She shakes her head. "It's not. You're going about your business, and you get a call saying a piece of the planet suddenly fell off into space. And it's gone forever."
to like her. She got his attention in a way that did not irritate nor intrigue him. Sherlock was correct in his observation. Brides tend to favor plain bridesmaids as an unconscious contrast for their "big day." Janine will likely gather even duller women for her wedding. But if his deductions are correct, she will remain single for many more months, possibly years, because of her high stress job.
She reaches across to wake her daddy, but feels the cold empty side of the bed, and she remembers. She curls her legs in and hugs herself. She wants to go back to sleep, but she cannot stay like this. She can smell the pee.
The little gardener heaves on the stem of his arm, dissolving into belly gulping laughs when her strength perseveres and he flops to the floor, having successfully been uprooted.
She shakes his shoulder. His eyelids flicker, and she sees a flash of pure blue, before he closes them again. He mumbles something.
She felt a hand at her back and somehow her legs started walking. Cold air lifted her hair off her shoulders. The sounds of cars and people shouting. At last they stopped next to a bench.
The desire for companionship drains from him. Sherlock nods in return and does not look at Janine anymore.
John had altered his entire world into an unfamiliar territory where he forgot what it was like to be alone. His doctor had inserted himself into his life and memories, part of his beating heart.
Rosie cranes her head to try and find the curly black hair. Beebee has such pretty hair. But he doesn't like when she plays with it and pulls too hard. She puts pretty clips in it though.
Rosie peeks between the bars on the stairs that lead up to her and Daddy's room. This is where she and Nana play Spy, and they sneak up on Daddy and Beebee when they come home from the work.
"It's not practical," Sherlock admits, sounding abhorrently like Mycroft. What was the point in thinking about what might have been if it never was? "John is dead. There's nothing I can do to change that."
One night Beebee had to make food because Nana was out and Dr. Molly couldn't come over. Rosie tried to help. He almost had to call the fire truck. So they went to a restaurant instead. Angel's. He's a man with a beard that gave them a free slice of pie. And Beebee wiped off her upper lip because she made a mess, and he smiled. "No mustaches for Watsons," he said.
He holds out his hand for Rosie to take, and the door shuts behind them. But this time, it doesn't feel permanent. A strand of thread has been left for him to take, thin and fragile, but it will inevitably guide him back to Rosie's half of the world, where, one day, it might become whole again.
John nods. "Why do you think no one reported him? No missing persons, no one to interview. He had enough money to live on his own for two years. Why am I here again?"
It's still not good. Beebee is stiff and his shoulder digs into her cheek. All hard edges like a countertop. She squeezes her arms around his neck to show that she still loves him. She wishes he would hug her like Daddy.
"No. No, darling please don't." He slides from his own seat to kneel next to her. "Listen to me.  Rosamund. Are you listening?"
Rosamund has been to the cemetery before. It was during the day, when the ghosts were all asleep. She and Daddy walked down a path to a black stone under a tree. Daddy said her mummy had passed away when Rosamund was a little baby, and that she was in Heaven. Rosie knows that her mummy is under the black stone, but her eyes got put in the sky. Daddy laid flowers on the black stone and Rosie set a card next to the flowers. It was a piece of pink construction paper from her daycare on which she had drawn a rainbow and a smiling sun. It's what Heaven is supposed to look like.
Lately, Sherlock has felt absent. Not physically. Physically, he knows that he is present in this room, at this party, surrounded by a hundred people he does not know. But there is another absence in him. It has been growing for a while now, spreading like a sinkhole, hollowing out his entire being without remorse. Some nights, he feels it ache.
Mycroft shakes his head. "He doesn't need you. No one needs you." His eyebrow ticks up and he tosses the leash into the fire.
A loud clatter jolts her from sleep. It takes her a moment to remember where she is. Back sore and legs cramped from sleeping curled up. There is faint light coming from outside the windows.
Mr. Mycroft was here today, and he only left after Beebee shouted at him and threw something. Rosie peeked through the slats in the stairs and watched him go. He spotted her as he was stomping down. His eyes were like ice, and he sniffed before continuing.
Crime scenes were strictly off limits, but they played detective sometimes on his days off and he showed her how he solved a crime, censoring some of the more grisly ones. It was a game she adored, especially if she could solve a case with him.
A circle of plastic chairs have been set up in the middle of the rec room and sweaty rehabitants fill them with second day clothing. They're all users of some variety or another. Alcohol, cocaine, heroin... it all comes up, along with their personal grievances.
"You don't have to keep them up." He had taken his down and stuck it in the alcoholic's room next door.
He grabs something off the table and Rosie doesn't see it leave his hand because she squeezes her eyes shut, but she hears it
He clears his throat. "Rosie I know you must be confused, and that's my fault," he says. He presses his palm flat against the metal table. "I left you, and you needed me."
Luis tries to cut him in the ear when Sherlock turns to look. He catches the boy's arm and pushes him back into the ropes.
I wanted his point of view to show how he is healing. Grief is messy, and is different in an adult than a child. Sherlock's journey through dealing with depression and addiction in itself is so complicated that it had to be longer than the previous two chapters, so the final part will hopefully feel organic with how he and Rosie come together, and they can each move forward.
"Always keep me -hic- kept me right," he says. He snorts and giggles. "You know you do." And he laughs again, his shoulders hitching up and down like the chair is bucking under him, but then his chin drops to his chest and Rosie realizes that he isn't laughing. His mouth curves down in a mangled attempt at a smile and he wipes his wrist across his eyes and his shoulders buck again, this time with a choke.
Her breath hitched. "I thought... Daddy..." She broke off with a wail. Nana's face came into focus again.
Uncle Greg squeezes her tight and looks her right in the eye. "Honey, you are so pretty," he says. "But you are also so smart like your Beebee and so brave like your Daddy. And we need princesses like that."
It's good that he can't remember. So achingly good. Sherlock always remembers even when he so desperately wants to forget. It is his curse. He promised himself he did not want to forget Serbia, no matter how long he went without sleep. No matter how much he wanted it, he did not want John's disappointment even more.
Sherlock had been expecting a client at five o'clock, so John took Rosie for new trainers. Her old light up Rainbow Dashers had been ruined by a daring trip through a mud puddle at the park. And without the lights, they were just regular old trainers. And they couldn't have that, now could they?
"It's not so bad," he whispers to Sherlock, his soft voice slithering into his brain. His voice just as clear and eerily pleasant after three years. "You might like it."
She holds Grandma's hand and helps her walk. She and Grandpa stop. They look confused. A man steps out of a black car. He's not wearing black. His suit is blue. An umbrella hangs from his arm, even though it's sunny out. Rosie scrunches her nose. She knows this umbrella man.
Two people in green finally arrive. They carry Beebee down the stairs on a stretcher. Rosie follows barefoot. It is cramped inside the ambulance with four people. She doesn't remember her first time in the ambulance, so it's brand new to her. Halfway to the hospital, he starts jerking. The doctors cut his shirt away and when Rosie starts crying, the lady doctor tells Rosie to close her eyes and count as high as she can.
She is a terrible dancer, with poor judgement in men's personalities, but she talked to Sherlock. The first time to play coy. She was looking for a date. She came alone to the wedding, so she hoped the best man would be interested. A deep shame seeped under her confident spread of makeup and push up strapless bra.
Uncle Greg follows behind Dr. Molly. He carries white flowers. Nana takes them from him and adds them to the growing pile on the table.
The rest shuffle up to the box one by one, and leave in the order they come. In the end, Rosie and her family are left.
heaves a sigh from the other room. Sherlock frowns, forehead lines crinkling like clay, and turns away from the mirror. What could possibly be ailing his brother right now? Probably had an aneurysm from climbing the stairs. Too bad it didn't kill him.
One day he just laid on the couch with his back turned to the room for the entire day. Nana laid a blanket over him and told Rosie to leave him be. "Rainy days" Nana calls them.
Beebee's eyes snap open and he blinks slowly in her direction. Rosie opens her mouth, but doesn't know what to say. She suddenly feels like she has just seen something private, like walking in on someone when they are in the toilet.
Sherlock rubs the space between his eyes and tilts his head up so he doesn't have to look at him. He will stay until morning. No amount of morphine or whiskey will make him float away like his other problems. He's tried.
Mycroft frowns and stands to his full height, miles and miles above Sherlock. He throws the flannel back into the sink and shakes his head. "What a stupid little boy."
"No!" Sherlock cries, reaching for the leash, but Mycroft is too tall. "I-I'll take care of him," he pleads. "He needs me."
The crack widens considerably in his chest. He wonders for a moment if she is merely mimicking Lestrade, that Bee-Bee is still in her vocabulary somewhere. But then he realizes that this was inevitable. Children learn to correct themselves when disapproval is met by authority.
Uncle Greg's head turns, and the room hushes. Rosie twists and at last sees the curly dark hair. Beebee wears black too, but he always wears black, because that is his work suit. Daddy says he likes to be fancy for his clients. This time though, he wears a necktie. Nana must've made him. His face is smooth again. At breakfast he still had a scratchy beard, and it tickled Rosie's cheek when she hugged him. He frowns at the room, eyes scanning corner to corner.
Sherlock blinks slowly, the tears drying on his cheeks, and stares into the flames. He curls into himself. Mycroft is right. Redbeard ran off because he didn't like Sherlock. He wasn't his real friend. Everyone at school hated him. Even when he thought he could have John, he was still meant to be alone.
Beebee has never spanked her. That was Daddy's job. She never kicked him though. She's never wanted to hurt him before.
She hears a scratching and screeching sound like nails on a screaming chalkboard from downstairs. Goose flesh prickles down her arms.
He retreats a step, then another, Lestrade coolly watching him. He backs away until he is just outside the door, struggling to breathe. He cannot do it. Cannot face what he has done.
"There's my flower!" Uncle Greg growls playfully and hauls her into his lap. Rosie squeals and twists and wriggles to avoid tickles.
Sometimes Mycroft makes out 'Redbeard' amongst the ramblings. Sherlock's glazed eyes follow something Mycroft cannot see. He sinks back into the wonderland that frees him from he torments around him. Mycroft holds him closer. It comforts him to think that Sherlock is happier there.
Sherlock frowns. How on earth did John get in here? Perhaps they've changed out his doctor again. At last, he will have some competent help. John has helped him plenty in the past. Although he doesn't feel particularly comfortable with him in here during his session with Song. Since Rosie cannot visit him, John has taken it upon himself to appear at the most inopportune times. Sherlock will have to talk to him about that later. Boundaries of course.
Through his blurring vision, Sherlock sees Mary Morstan swaying in front of the coffee table. He was quite certain he locked that door, and yet here she stands.
They are alone for the first time in a week. Dr. Molly had to leave early tonight. The other doctors needed her. Nana is gone today and tomorrow, and the day after that. Rosie didn't want her to go. Beebee didn't even say goodbye.
He washes his hands and presses them, still dripping, to his face. It feels far too warm. His mind is racing, forcing him to confront the last twelve hours, when all he wants is quiet and nothing.
He wonders who dressed her. A closer look and he spots a missed button at the back of her neck. Either an elderly nanny, or someone who couldn't bother to care about her appearance.
She threw that magazine at the wall and hit him three times with her hand before the nurses were able to lead her away. She nearly hit them too. She glared at him over her shoulder.
Those are the bad nights, where he must play his violin so loudly to drown out his thoughts that point him to the hollowed out tile in the loo, or the secret bottom in the middle drawer. He knows there is enough to take away the ache, but not enough to numb him in the days after.
Sherlock strokes the neck of the violin. "John does." He doesn't know why, but he feels proud that he can name at least someone, while Mycroft cannot. Of course Mycroft would not see that as an achievement.
She and Grandpa were at the hospital the first few nights. They took turns reading her books. Then Beebee made them leave. He's not very nice around Grandma. Rosie likes their house out in the country. They got a swing for her for when she stays with them over the weekend. And Grandpa reads to her with all his funny voices, and Grandma makes the best pies. She always smells like the food she bakes. It's a good smell.
Stupid question. Most of her questions were stupid. Of course he couldn't say that, not to her face. That would be rude. And Mycroft told him he had to behave while he's here.
Sherlock's head is too heavy to keep up now. He lets it rest against Jim's shoulder. His eyes search wildly for Mycroft, but logic has fled. Only his heart remains, bared raw for the empty room. Always empty. No one, not even Mycroft is allowed to be present with this part of himself. Because this part is shameful, and never allowed to see the light of day. In the dark, it is the only comfort he has.
It had been a bigger case involving a security scandal with an art museum. Four paintings had been vandalized and the security guard was under fire for allowing it to happen. The security tapes had been wiped. It was intriguing. Nothing stolen, no one harmed. It seemed to be nothing more than a case of extreme art criticism.
and John's forehead is covered in blood and Sherlock is falling. There is a moment of panic, and the air rushes out of him. He reaches out for John's hand, but he is gone when Sherlock hits the ground.
Lestrade's brows furrow. He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, then gently squeezes Sherlock's wrist in return.
She's looking somewhere in the middle of the floor with a deep frown. "Why'd I... I dunno. I wouldn't do it for shits now would I?" She straightens up. "I tell you what I'd do. You see that surfer girl who got her arm bit off? She went back to surfing. She's quite good. You can do lots of things one handed." She looks down at her hand. Her cuticles are bright red from where she's chewed them. She flexes her fingers. "It's just a hand. Doesn't make me laugh. It doesn't know me. It writes. It texts. Helps me speak. Helps me open doors. But that's what the other hand is for."
Mr. Mycroft takes Rosie back to her house and Nana helps her pack a small case with her clothes and toys. She falls asleep in the car. She wakes up when they arrive at a new house. It is bigger than anywhere she has ever seen. A lady shows Rosie a new room. The wallpaper is yellow and brown. No purple or blue.
A wave of longing swells in him, the months she has been absent from his arms. His legs twitch, wanting to carry him to her. He almost reaches out for her, to hold her again and feel her heartbeat against his like how he cradled her as a baby.
She returns to her room and sits on the window seat. There is no moon out tonight. Sheets of rain pelt the glass. There is no nightlight, so she keeps the light on in the closet.
After, he had requested permission to open an investigation with Lestrade. Murder, he hoped. Malicious intent upon him for some grievance he'd caused. It must have been. At least then, fault could be identified. But, as he'd been told many years ago, he could see through everything, except when there was
Is anyone ever well enough? What is the rating system to deem someone well enough? You must be this well to ride on this coaster. "Just out of shithole" seems to be where Sherlock would put it.
A wave of reality crashes over him. At some point in their visit, he forgot that they would have to return to the world of sobriety.
She wriggles down from Uncle Greg's arms and hobbles to her Beebee. He blinks and looks down at her, eyebrows making a squiggle and his mouth tightens. Rosie hugs his leg because that is as high as she can reach. She can reach her arms all the way around. Beebee is very tall, but also very skinny. Daddy says he's not as tall as he seems, but Rosie knows better because Daddy is very very tall and Beebee towers over him.
He pauses, on his hands and knees, staring at the little hill of white. His very bones are aching for just a hit of it, but a small voice orders him to scatter his hand through the powder and send it into every nook and cranny of the loo so he can never find enough to fill even a thimble full.
This is what they will see when they find his body. This is all he will be. Just another corpse, another specimen left behind for Molly to examine.
Mycroft stands and yanks the umbrella back and whaps Sherlock again. He stumbles back into his chair and sucks in a breath to shout, but chokes because his brother is gone, and in his place is... him.
Rosie puts one finger on her chin like she's seen Beebee do, and watches her uncle's eyes. Beebee taught her that whenever Uncle Greg lies, he tends to bite his cheek and look away from the right answer.
Mr. Mycroft is an odd fellow, like Daddy says. Beebee says he is a nuisance. Rosie thinks so too. He always carries an umbrella with him, even when it is sunny. Rosie knows he doesn't like her. He never smiles, and looks at her as if she's annoying him even when she's just sitting and not making any noises. At Christmas she drew a picture of him and he told her that her lines were not straight and that it looked nothing like him.
Grandpa is frowning. Beebee is sitting on a stone bench beneath a tree talking with a general. He looks like a soldier. Blue hat on the side of his head, and fancy gold shoulder hats. He has medals over his coat too. Rosie's daddy was a soldier. He fought the bad guys.
Laughter behind him. The pews are filled with faceless mannequins, except Mycroft, who watches with a grimace.
"You'll always end up here, with me." He rises from his seat. The tea cup tumbles from his hand and it smashes onto the floor. He steps over its remains. "It's okay though. We can be broken together."
Sherlock stabs his finger at him, only to lose his balance when his elbow slips off his knee. He grabs hold of the armrests and waits for the room to stop swaying.
a second chance with her, no matter how thin that chance might be. As badly as he wanted to be with John, he now wants to be with her more.
Once, she laughs out loud, and Sherlock feels goose flesh on his neck it is so haunting. He hasn't heard her laugh in ages. Her voice has haunted his memories, drugged and foggy as they were, by screaming that she hated him.
Mrs. Wannop, in her usual grey dressing gown, is trimming some flowers along the fence line. She sits down with group discussion every Wednesday in the rec room. Her daughter killed herself eight months ago, and she has been in and out of programs for substance abuse since. Her husband sent her here after her second overdose. Mr. Wannop visits every Monday and Friday and weekend during visiting hours.
Before he loses the chance, Sherlock suddenly pinches Lestrade's sleeve between his fingers. The DI turns, brow raised.
His slow movements freeze. His entire body winds itself tight and tense. She waits for his reaction, almost hopeful for something over than this bland apathy. For a moment she thinks he is going to crawl back into his shell like the turtle he is. He opens his mouth then closes it, and gives himself a hard shake.
She stays on the phone with her the entire time. When Rosie starts crying, she tells her to hold Beebee's hand. She doesn't know if it comforts him, but it helps her. He's cold.
Rosie giggles and rolls onto her back and stretches her arms high above her head, copying him. She is two, with her curly blonde hair bouncing in the two pigtails on either side of her face, still round with jiggling baby fat. Both her big, blue eyes blink lazily at him.
A few nights later, Nana is giving Rosie her bath, and the door suddenly opens. Beebee, dressed in his blue dressing gown, crouches next to the tub. He never intrudes on bath time because he says everyone need their privacy. This time, he takes the flannel from Nana and tells her that she can get ready for bed.
Sherlock sneers and leans forward. Mycroft is trying to trick him, trying to tell him that he's a waste of air like he did when they were kids. But he's
Rosie isn't brave enough yet. Instead she turns the mirror sideways so it faces the wall. The sun is shining through the window by the time she falls asleep. Even then, she dreams of her reflection chasing her through a hospital. No matter how many doors she tries, she cannot find the way out.
But apparently that was a not good thing to say because she frowns. "You can be starved of other necessities. From what you've told me, it seems like you and your brother are distant."
That he could have a few at the bar and take her home on his arm for a night cap, too drunk to understand that she wasn't who he really wanted. That he could be satisfied with anyone other than him. But, as Sherlock is reminded amidst the mass of moving bodies, he is not normal. Something he has known since he was a child.
When Nana shakes her head again, Rosie huffs and hobbles to the green chair. She likes Daddy's chair better because it's soft and warm, but after Rosie came home from hospital, Daddy's chair was gone. She asked Beebee where it went, but all he said was that he would get her a new one. He hasn't.
He crouches at Sherlock's side, presses close to him. He smells of cinnamon and he is warm where Sherlock is so cold inside. "It's how it's supposed to be," he whispers. "No one else would understand." He wraps his arm around Sherlock.
Rosie has trouble sneaking now because the pink cast on her leg makes too much noise. Even now she thumps, thumps, thumps down the stairs in an awkward rhythm. She keeps both hands on the railing so she won't fall. She falls a lot because she gets dizzy and her head hurts and she can't see very well, but she's getting better. She can make it down the stairs by herself now.
He sees Rosie and she twists her body and hides her face in the chair. She can smell Beebee's perfume in the leather. A heavy weight drops down beside her.
Sherlock uses the edge of the sink to heave himself up, but his arms give out, and there's a moment of weightlessness and heart stopping fear when he catches a flash of overcast sky, and suddenly he is on his back. His head lolls to his shoulder, cheek pressed against the cold tile. He can see under the door into the hall.
But whatever case he could have possibly brought to interest Sherlock is erased from existence because of the blonde curly head sitting across from him.
Sherlock knows it is illogical to see life as a balance sheet, to "scratch backs" as John put it. But he knows he owes his fiends, especially John. He will forever be in John's debt, and the ledger weighs heavily upon his shoulders.
He taps his fingers on the arm rest in time to the music. Song, a fifty seven year old second generation Hong Kong descendant, knows he enjoys music rather than stone silence, so now there is always music playing during their hour together. She married young, in her early twenties, but only for four years before she decided to return to school. She has remained single ever since, and works alongside her mother in a flower shop. Deductions flit over her head much more clearly than they have been the last few weeks, like stretching an old muscle.
Sherlock's eyes flutter open. The overhead light blocks out the face above him, but he can smell the aftershave. Sherlock shivers. It is far too cold in here.
He turns and holds out his hand. Mary, in her wedding gown, steps up to alter and takes his hand, smiling at Sherlock.
He gave a shout of surprise, which meant he was there. He was really there! She was hugging him, even after everyone tried to tell her that he was gone. It would take a giant to pry her away. She made sure to grip him tight so he couldn't escape her and Beebee. He would finally smile when he saw who Rosie had found. He would smile for real!
Sherlock slinks through the crowd. No one says goodbye, so neither does he. He changes out of his tuxedo in the men's loo. He brought an extra suit for the taxi home. He stuffs his wedding attire in the bin. He can get another tux. Hopefully not for another wedding. He's had enough of weddings to last a lifetime.
She recognizes Sherlock from group session, when he decides to go. He would much prefer to talk in private, or not at all, but it's not as though everyone speaks at once. The moderator gives everyone a chance to speak, and only them. Sometimes Sherlock listens. More often he enjoys deducing the patients and pointing out their obvious problems before the moderator can intervene. He has been kicked out twice.
"Well John isn't - " He flings his fork down and scoots his chair back with a rough scrape. He stands and grabs his plate. "Molly made it, so you will eat it."
She squirms in place. "You read... and telly always tells you, it's like... losing a limb." She sucks in her cheeks and shakes her head. "It's not." She shrugs. "I could cut off my own hand and be sad or angry, but - "
At a quarter to four, Lestrade looks at his watch. "We'll have to get going. The aquarium closes at 6."
He is back in 221B. Soft leather presses into his back, and Jim, with his blank, dark eyes, smiles warmly from John's chair. He holds a tea cup to his lips. the firelight flickers off his face.
"She thinks I'm ill with the flu." She had sounded confused. Understandable. Mycroft had probably explained it to her in his limited way. It was better that she did not understand what had happened on their last night together. She is so young after all.
"You know that's not true, little brother. I have your best interests at heart." Mycroft smirks and twirls his umbrella handle. "I'm the only one who does."
They sit at a table in the visitor's area, two cups of earl grey tea breaching the space between them.
The loo rocks back and forth like the inside of a top when its lost momentum. Sherlock stuffs the paper into his dressing gown pocket. Those are the rules, but right now, he can't remember why.
Sherlock blinks and suddenly he is staring down at his own body, as if he were someone else, but he's not. John stands beside him, dressed in his wedding tuxedo. The body at their feet wears a blue military uniform, and a white belt with gold clasps lying limp at his sides. The corpse's cloudy, pale eyes stare up, unseeing. Dark red stains his midsection where the belt clasp would rest against.
This close, she sees how dark the circles under his eyes are. He looks sleepy, which is odd because he sleeps so often. She rubs her thumb across his scratchy beard.
Rosie gathers what little bravery she feels below her heart, and eases the door open. It creaks and there is the sound of shifting, tinkling glass. Her eyes dart down at her feet and broken glass litters the space where she would step. She freezes. Daddy tells - telled her that broken glass is dangerous. She could cut herself.
The kitchen is silent except for the fridge's humming. She is sick of his stupid face, with the scratchy hair and his pink eyes. She wants to hit him. She pushes the plate side ways and it clatters off the table.
And she falls on the floor and covers her eyes and screams and screams until she is sure Daddy can hear her in Heaven.
"Playing dirty again," he tuts. He turns and glares at the attendant with the note. He bites the velcro of the glove and rips it off. "Please tell me I'm being expelled."
and he couldn't even give her that. He has failed her. Failed John in the most unimaginable way. Before, he would have done anything for her, and now, with John gone, it's as if his vows died with him.
It was a special day, because it was normal. Beebee has never liked the shops, so Rosie always went with Daddy or Nana. She helped push the buggy until it got too heavy.
Grandpa says it's time for the funeral to start. So he leads her away from them. Everyone gathers around the black box above the deep black hole in the ground. A man in a white gown gives a speech and reads from the Bible, which is a book about stories of God and Jesus. He talks about Heaven, and Rosie likes how he describes it, and why her daddy was brave and will now watch over his loved ones.
A low droning flies past his ear. A blur of yellow hovers over the flowers, passing over one to the next, the cycle of nature present before his eyes. He follows it through the garden, crouching on his hands and knees. At some point, Mrs. Wannop leaves him.
The legs bend, knees beside his head, the coat just barely brushing his cheek. A leather gloved hand turns his face side to side. The light blocks out the face above, but he can see the outline of frazzled hair.
Hands tighten around his biceps. His back is killing him, pressed into the cold, hard tile all night. He's getting too old for this. His head feels like he hit it on the toilet, pounding in time with his blood pressure.
Beebee does not like being around people. Daddy says he's just not a people person. Rosie likes that word. It makes her think of a person with a bunch of people stacked on top of them.
"I.. yes," he sighs into the phone. "Yes love. I did. But I have to stay in hospital for a while. They're going to help me stay better."
Song leans forward slightly. "There's a difference between knowing someone is dead, and accepting it, and dealing with it in a healthy way. That is what this," she gestures vaguely between them, "is about. Helping you move forward to acceptance."
She still feels sorry that she said she hated Daddy. He took away her favorite toy because she made a big mess in the kitchen. He put her in time-out and she couldn't have screen time for several days. She told him she didn't mean that she hated him, and Daddy said he forgave her. Hating wasn't unforgivable.
She grins and grabs his arm and pulls as hard as she can and he grunts and puffs, but Rosie knows she is strong and pulls his hand out. His hand is clenched tight around the prize but Rosie pries his fingers open and there it is!
Grandpa crouches in front of her. He taps her nose and she looks right at him. "He took very, very good care of your Beebee for us."
She looks up with a small lift in her mouth. "Every time I'm happy, I get to draw a smile face. And then when I get cross at Uncle Mycroft, I look at them smile."
She looks him up and down, and frowns at the wrist with his hospital tag. She looks back up, not quite meeting his eyes.
Zach, a young addict in the middle of his gap year, raises his hand. "Why'd you cut off your own hand?"
child, and he has lost the privilege of Bee-Bee. Instead he is another name to her. Plain, and forgetful.
"That's very clever of you," he says instead. She beams. "But I don't want to hear of you breaking anything else."
"I haven't told her why we're here. She thinks we're on a case, top secret stuff, y'know. I figured it'd be like a plaster. Just rip it off." He squeezes Sherlock's shoulder. "Yeah, it's gonna be rough, but you're all she's got."
Sherlock rips the flower chain. "It's easier than you think." After all, how easy was it for him to choose the needle over a child.
This was the exact reason why a wedding was a stupid ceremony. Best Man: origin/ Germany 16th century - Not only was it just another tradition to add to the plentiful that symbolizes society's obsession with celebrating love, but a man was almost murdered. That, in itself, should be plenty of reasons to never marry.
He gives the phone to her. She presses it to her ear, clutching it with both hands because it is expensive and she does not want to drop it and get in trouble.
She is halfway back up the stairs when she realizes she didn't tell Beebee that she loved him. Part of her wants to turn back, but the bigger part is too tired.
She wants her daddy. He could calm Beebee down. When he's angry, he attacks his violin, and he yells at Nana, but he doesn't look angry now. Rosie doesn't know what is wrong with him. She has never played pretend like this. He seems to think there is actually someone there. Daddy would know what to do.
Mr. Mycroft never says hello or goodbye or please or thank you. He said it wastes time. Daddy would say he is rude.
She peeks between the door and the jam and sees Beebee by the window, twirling and spinning while stroking the stick for his violin up and down in rapid movements without any rhythm.
John smirks and rolls his eyes. Sherlock has to bite his smile off in return. Really John. You must know better. He can't giggle; he's in therapy!
She manages to drift off, and wakes when she hears Dr. Molly. She keeps her eyes closed because it sounds like she and Mr. Mycroft are arguing.
Dr. Molly is quiet. But then she raises her voice. "Don't you dare dump all on me. You're his brother. Why didn't you look after him if you were so worried?"
Song hands him a tissue. He presses it to his eyes and sits there shaking. Eventually he calms down enough to wipe his eyes and nose. He tucks the tissue into his pocket.
"Don't you see John? I clearly wasn't meant to be a person. I am adapting to nature and becoming an organism dependent solely upon my vegetating mind."
He had John, that was all that mattered, and Sherlock did not want to lose him. Promoted to best friend and best man, he made sure John would remember his wedding fondly. A man only marries his wife once.
The moon is a thin sliver in the sky. Out here, the stars shine brighter than in the London smog. Only on rare occasions can one see even a few stars above the city lights. But int he country, they light up the dark roads.
He takes her precious face into his hands. She blinks owlishly at him, fat tears sliding down her face. Sherlock feels his own tears as well.
It is better that she did not dance with him. Better that she understand that they could never be. But the wound remains because he dared to hope that he could be normal.
Dr. Molly, in her black dress, carries a pot of something steamy and it smells good, but now this is getting out of hand. Why is Dr. Molly wearing black? Rosamund is truly starting to hate - H-A-T-E - the color black. Daddy always tells her that HATE is a big word. He says it is okay to have big emotions. He gets big emotions too. But Rosie has to think about them before she says something that she cannot take back. Someone might get their feelings hurt.
The late May air is refreshing from the stifling heat of the packed bodies inside the chapel, and the blasting music finally dampened. He stands there for a long moment, letting it wash over him, wash the wedding away like grime on his feet. But the tension has been present for the last six months, a constant squeezing pressure around him that is both comforting and bloody straining. Now that it is over, he feels as though he will come apart. His insides give a horrible lurch and he cannot breathe properly and he knows he is close to death.
But even though John is gone, the smallest parts of him are coded into Rosamund Watson. Echoes of him left in the world, like ripples finally reaching the shore of a pond. The mug he left on the table in the living room. The last bill he opened. The last text message.
Mycroft grunts and presses his hand to Sherlock's forehead like used to do when they were little. His hand is cold too. Why isn't he yelling at him? Telling him that he will burn down 221B to search for his stash? Tell him that he's going to send him back to Mummy and Daddy's until he gets clean again? Tell him what an idiot he is?
She peeks up. This close, she sees that there is something wrong with the soldier's face. The skin is wrinkled and pink on one half. His eyes look like clouds. Sad.
She wears a lavender dress with blue flowers. When she hugs him, he can smell eucalyptus on her. She's been burning those aroma candles in her apartment then. She feels much smaller than last time he hugged her. Her hair is greyer.
She wipes her nose but still doesn't look at him. He knows she doesn't believe him, but that's normal. It will take much more than words - and more time - to convince her that she was not to blame.
There are tubes in his arms and mouth. He looks like a ghost. Like he's dead. A machine beeps in time with his heart to tell them that he is still alive.
Beebee looks away and his shaking hand grabs the bottle from the floor. He sways a bit when he stands, like he's on a boat, and drags his feet as he walks down the hall. Maybe he is going to get the smelly cleaning spray. She hears the door slam. And the house is quiet once more. He doesn't come back.
Rosie keeps her hand on Grandma's skirt. She tries to stop her from hugging Mr. Mycroft. She might turn to stone. Grandma hugs him, and he winces and does not hug her back. He shakes Grandpa's hand. He does not look at Rosie.
Suddenly, a hand clasps the back of his neck. He flinches, but he recognizes Mycroft's plain aftershave. He turns and he is in his childhood bathroom, old claw footed bathtub and green tile floor to ceiling. Mummy's blue flannels hung on brass hooks. He sits on the edge of the tub, knees bloody and uniform dirty. Mycroft kneels with his sleeves rolled to his elbows in front of him, hand on his shoulder, and presses the flannel to Sherlock's knee.
Her first thought is how ugly she looks. And she wants to cry. But then she remembers the soldier from Daddy's funeral. She didn't think he looked ugly. Daddy would never have said that he was ugly. The soldier looked strong. Brave. Brave enough to look at his reflection. Brave enough to go to a funeral.
More out of habit lately, he found his thoughts trailing back uselessly to what happened. Useless to think about if John had left only two minutes later. If the bus had been slower, if the damn client had shown up when he was meant to. It seemed the entirety of London was in-tune with itself to result in that exact moment.
Now, she looks up at him, still smiling, and uncaps a purple marker. She pulls down her sleeve and draws a smile. Sherlock watches her, completely entranced.
It started raining on the way home, so he covered them with his big coat. And he let her curl up in his chair and watch
He blinks slowly, feeling his breathing even out. He presses his palms into the cold floor. He wants to sink through it into the water below. He can hear it lapping at his toes.
Sherlock frowns. He can see his reflection behind the cloudy eyes. He opens his mouth, but cannot find the words. John raises his eyebrow and nods to his hands. Sherlock blinks and is startled to see the notecards.
He is so confused. How could she possibly think this was her fault? He rubs her shuddering back, feeling the knots in her spine. "I don't understand," he says helplessly.
Rosie, still in her pee stained nightgown, creeps to the mirror and opens her one good eye. She touches the eyepatch, and her reflection does the same, so she knows it is her in the mirror. The pink, wrinkled lines across her forehead and cheeks from where the window burst open. The fuzzy patches where her hair is still growing back after the surgery because her brain got too big.
"This was in his dressing gown." She hands him the folded piece of paper. He looks at it, brows furrowed.
John crouches down and lifts the medals, just over the space where his heart would be. There is a hole, carved through the muscle and bone, and the smoldering cavity is empty. Smoke trickles out.
of what he did swells in him like a tsunami, threatening to consume him. He needs to leave before she notices, before it all comes back, before she demands to know why he did it...
Sherlock grins, which turns into a giggle. "The dog's - excuse me -" he snorts, and composes himself. "The dog's owner was a very wealthy old woman with stage three cancer. After she died, all the money would go to her dog. The groomer had worked for her for nearly twelve years, with all her show dogs, and didn't feel he was adequately compensated." He smiles at the memory, feeling the cracks widen. "That was her first, and last case."
Daddy's eyes are in Heaven too, is what Nana said. Rosie drew a picture of him, but she got his wings wrong. So she keeps it folded up so no one can see what it looks like. She doesn't know how to write yet, so she asked Nana if she would write her letter to Daddy. Rosie signed it though. She knows how to write her name. Her letter and picture will be buried with him.
Sherlock tips back and drops into his chair. Mycroft sniffs. He hates when he does that. Wrinkles the trousers.
Sherlock drags his feet into the kitchen and glares at the back of Mycroft's thinning head poking up from John's chair. Premature balding set in at twenty five. It's a wonder he hasn't lost all his hair at this point.
He nods. "I want you to know, I am sorry. For everything Mrs. Hudson. For Rosie. For... everything."
Days, filled with their meaningless distractions, pass by easier than the nights. All of the patients here suffer from the constant distracted insomnia that plagues them during withdrawal. Sherlock only remains here so the doctors can deem him well enough, by Mycroft's standards, to get back to the work.
He giggles and something in his eyes makes Rosie's stomach tighten. They're too wide, glimmering, like underwater.
She turned her face into Nana's leg and shut the world out. In the darkness of her trouser legs, she wept. Soaking the fabric with hot tears. She could hear Nana's biting, sharp voice above, and another man's. It sounded like they were arguing.
Sherlock sits cross legged next to her. The ground is damp from the sprinklers. He plucks some weeds away and absentmindedly ties them into a chain, like he used to for Rosie. Though she always took her flower jewelry off because they attracted bees, and the little darling, no matter how many times Sherlock explained to her, could not let go of her fear of being stung.
Sherlock remains an island in a sea of dancing and smiling guests. Molly with her Tom; John with Mary; and Janine...
Light from the chair room seeps into the hallway, lighting the way. She pauses on the other side, the screeching is making her head hurt, and she can smell something sour from the chair room, like it has seeped into the walls.
He curls into himself and lets the fake Mycroft heave his upper body off the floor and into his lap. He sits with Sherlock, using the door to prop himself up.
Sherlock looks at his hands. His dressing gown sleeves slip down to his wrists and the bruises are stark purple against the pale skin.
Rosie hobbles downstairs, and the screaming gets louder with each step. She holds onto the railing so tight she digs her nails in.
Sherlock, still retaining a semblance of gentlemancy in this luney house, walks with her to the exit when their hour is up. He takes advantage of the rare sunny day, and walks through the garden.
"Well..." Sherlock refuses to acknowledge the heat in his face as embarrassment. "We are brothers after all."
She twirls a flower between her thumb and forefinger. "He knows how much I hate that poster though. How easy it is to ignore a slogan just to spite it all. But I won't lose that teacup, mind you."
She traces a line on her drawing and shakes her head. Her silence, while not a protest, is unnerving.
She came close to understanding, because she lives with loneliness as well, but hers is a different loneliness. She did not ask, so Sherlock did not tell. Sherlock will never tell.
Up close, she could see who it was, but this face was a stranger's. It wasn't right. But why? Had her father been gone so long that she was forgetting what he looked like? Of course this stranger wasn't her father. Her daddy had blue eyes, and this man's was brown. His face was too long, nose too big.
The Watson wedding ends without a hitch. One nearly murder, but Sherlock counts that as a success. Months of planning, of denying the Work, and he was not going to ruin this, nor let anyone else interrupt John's "biggest and most important day."
At the very back of the crowd, Mr. Mycroft and Beebee stand. Mr. Mycroft looks bored, but Beebee looks like he will crumble. He looks lost.
I love writing from the point of view of a child. Hopefully done right, it conveys the confusion of a world they are just starting to navigate, especially when confronted with such complicated events.
The doctors allow them to stay with him for an hour. Rosie crawls up on the bed, careful of the tubes, and curls up at his side.
He sits down next to her and scoops up a forkful of pasta and points it at her mouth. "Finish your dinner. You are a big girl now."
Mrs. Wannop is there as usual, in the chair to Sherlock's left. She chews her thumb, and keeps rubbing her forehead. Bad night for her, Sherlock deduces. The moderator says it's her turn.
A bloody present. Sherlock will have to investigate once he gets out. Find out exactly what present his brother had used to wheedle his way into her good books, something he swore he would never let happen.
Everyone smiles, but the smiles are crooked, like Beebee does when he doesn't want to get in trouble. Their eyes don't wrinkle.
. How had he not seen it? All the signs were there, and yet he had not prepared, too occupied with preventing a catastrophe at her wedding.
Flashes of glass sprinkling against the asphalt next to her hand, and screeching metal leave her shaking in the cramped hall. The walls are closing in.
Something is missing from him. He doesn't smile much. He yells a lot. And when he looks at Rosie, it's like he's looking over her, or something is separating her from him. Maybe she's not really there. But she can hold his hand, and hug him, so she knows she is still here. She wonders if Beebee knows he is there.
