"True." Dean pauses. A sigh. "Yeah. Jody invited me here for some company. Sam's with his fiancee, so."
Dean manages to straddle the one he's struggling with as they hit the floor, throwing a few punches at his jaw for good measure, before he reaches up to try and clutch his throat. Dean grasps his wrist and twists back, hard, which earns a loud scream from Bastard #1. With a moment of opportunity, Dean throws himself in a flail for the gun that's just out of hands reach, balancing precariously on the edge of the landing.
Dean shrugs, despite Cas being unable to see. "Hey man, it's no problem. Guy seemed like a creep. Hope you don't have too much trouble with him."
in Lego. It was like a rainbow had decided to regurgitate itself up on half of Castiel's house. He sighs. He's not sure if even
. He’s far too petty for that.  So...when the time comes, you know what you need to do. And you don't tell a
He opens his mouth to say something but is cut off by the wave of panic that rolls through the rest of the arena. Cas looks up, seeing Lucifer.
Straight to the point, as normal. Dean glances at the nightmare mountain of crinkled glitter hearts spread around him.
“Fortunately,” he says, seeing the students collectively exhale. “We can provide a safe space for you to develop your skills.”
Anna and Castiel give another brief glance at each other; then Anna reaches out to Jack. “C’mon, Jack. Aunty Anna needs your help with something very special that only you can help with.”
Dean stood beside Sam as they waited for Eileen to walk down the aisle. He can't hide the grin from his face as he glances to the side, watching the tears drip down Sam’s cheeks as Eileen emerges, robed in white.
Sam starts sprinting to the arena just as the shield flickers into place, shouting as he comes to a stop in front of it. He pummels a fist against it a few times, before sensing the crackle of magic directly behind him. Sam twists around and pulls his own wand out, deflecting the spell aimed at him. He stares.
The sound of ceramic sliding across metal comes from Dean’s left, and the plate garnishing a cheeseburger and fries shows up. Dean grins at Ellen, sticking a hand in his pocket to throw down some notes. “Keep the change.” Dean winks, and pulls the plate towards himself.
Students line up either side of him on the pitch, facing each other. Brooms sit on the floor to their right hand side, and Dean grasps his hands behind his back.
Castiel glances up just as he’s about to reach for the snitch, and Dean feels panic rise as he realises that Cas isn’t moving out of the way.
Dean nods, lost in thought. Castiel steps aside his desk and motions to the door. “I’m assuming you’re also heading to the Great Hall? The Headmaster has his announcement to make over supper.”
Azazel doesn't respond for a while. He takes a quiet sip of a whiskey glass. "I think death would be too light a punishment."
Dean can’t help himself. He reaches a hand forward, places it on Cas’ shoulder. “You’re one of the best teachers those kids have had,” He says, earnestly. His hand lingers too long, words left too empty. He withdraws, with Cas still watching him. “I mean, heck of a lot better than our Professor ever was.”
Crowley stares at Castiel. He slowly slides the envelope over to their side of the desk. Sam looks at him, before quietly placing his finger on top of it, and dragging the envelope towards him. He tucks it into his coat pocket, staring at Crowley the whole time.
"Auror Michael, to you." He mutters. "I entrusted responsibility of this duelling club to you to run, Castiel. I am disappointed that you gave such a lacklustre demonstration of what is expected for Duel etiquette."
He hands Jack a plush Gecko, made up of a vibrant red fabric and bulging eyes. Jack stares at it in wonder.
"Sure. I'll tell her that," he mutters, before opening the fridge. He quickly calculates something in his mind, before pulling out a bottle of beer. He opens it with the bottle opener stuck on the fridge, some cheesy magnetic moose that Jo had bought him as a joke one year. Everyone cracked up when Bobby remarked how
Mr. Shurley leans down, and pats Jack on the shoulder. "Why don't you go and find Claire? She should be here somewhere."
He stares down the aisle. “First, we will be demonstrating how I expect you to act during these sessions. Master Winchester has gratefully offered to assist me.”
Azazel gently places down his glass. "What would be the point of removing an entire family with no one remaining to speak on the legacy of my threats? No one to tell the story of what exactly happens when you mess with Azazel, even retired."
, I swear if you keep hovering around me like some sort of fretful mother, I’ll put you into a state of paralysis.” Crowley growls at Dean, who folds his own arms tightly.
“He’s affecting the judgement of your duties, Castiel. You’re already aware in our field what a danger that—”
As they begin cleaning, Cas is rather more effective with his adult motor skills even with Jack's enthusiasm and the brush and pan. Cas still allows him the honour of dumping it into the plastic tub therefore known as Lego Jail.
His phone vibrates from a phone call, persistent, and he has no choice but to duck into the back room, eyeing the security camera as he pulls his phone out, just in case.
He feels Castiel considering him. “Claire had already asked for me help, but,” a tone of amusement in his voice, seeing Dean deflate. “But I passed her along to Professor Mills. Jody would prove best for mentoring her. So yes, I suppose that’s possible. What would you—”
Dean hesitates for a moment, before taking a few steps towards the table. "Hard, huh? What's hard about it?"
“You’re not like Lucifer, so you’re sure as hell don’t need to be like the rest of the family either. Bet you could do whatever you want - you’re really smart, wouldn’t be an issue for you—”
"She isn't wrong, but Dean already knows that. And that will make him arrogant." Cas sighs. "So I'm not holding any expectations."
Dean, still grinning, walks his way to the centre of the platform. “But this is just a demonstration, yeah?”
“That’s kinda what happens when several dozen Dementors decide to throw a surprise party where the cake is
Sorry for the delay in uploading this! I got caught up with another fic challenge and life happened to me orz. Enjoy!
, Dean realises, and he pulls himself to his feet. He glances to Meg who has taken a few steps away to stand beside Lucifer. She pulls her wand out.
Castiel sighs, puts down his book, places his hands on the table. “I’m sure you heard the rest of the statement Professor Singer said. There were to be no questions on this.”
Castiel’s footsteps echo down the suspension bridge as he walks alone. The sun has long since set, and Cas stops for a moment to close his eyes, listening to the rain as it drums on the roof above him.
Eileen smells it before she can see it. She'd become distracted, folding away the hurricane of notes that Sam had in his folder. She didn't let herself read them, but oh my
“Hogwarts is the safest place for anyone. Is that why you’re here, Chuck?” He starts, “You’ve hardly been in the post two minutes. Most Ministers get snowed under for the next six months when they assume office.”
He didn’t have long. A quick trip for some old friends along the alley, before he’d have to make his way back to Hogwarts.
, she was introduced as) nods. "Very well. While there has been little evidence so far that Castiel has failed in providing the basic amenities and caregiving that a child of Jack's age should provide, we can rule into investigating such a thing."
"Silence," Billie speaks, holding a hand up to Crowley. "I think you may have a point. It indeed does not look good in Lucifer's favour to be put under investigation so soon after being released. Do you have anything to say?"
"So detached from your own humanity, can't even reunite a father with his son." Lucifer sniffles. "I can't believe you."
Dean grins. “Jury’s still out though. Unless you could aid my love for the Grindylows like Professor Naomi could, then you still got some work to do.”
"Yeah, they're tricky little things, those a's. I betcha they won't get away for long from you, though."
His keys hover over the keyhole, lingering in front of the door. He closes his eyes and takes a deep sigh, before pushing the door open.
Dean scrambles with his phone, opening it up to see who Sam had been texting. He feels his cheeks heat up when his eyes settle on the name.
Hesitantly, he holds up his own wand. He manages to glance at Cas with a small smile but doesn’t catch Castiel’s eyebrows suddenly raise. He turns back, swings his wand down beside him, then turns around. Dean counts his three steps towards the edge of the arena, staring at the ground to make sure he doesn’t overstep the boundaries – swinging towards his competitor;
To Dean's surprise, Cas just stands there. He'd have expected Castiel to raise his hackles or something, growl back at Lucifer—anything like the proud, stubborn father that Dean had seen previously. But he doesn't. His expression is hard, but his shoulders are hunched, as though he's forgotten how to stand.  Lucifer leers over him.
Sam laughs a little wryly. "Yeah, well. He practically brought me up, so I think he thinks it's all he knows how to do."
Sam quietly places the now rather crumpled envelope on the desk, with all the receipts inside. Crowley stares at them.
He’d only arrived at the family home – which was mostly occupied by Sam and Jess these days – late last night.
a detention I’m giving you. With the sort of attitude you’d been demonstrating, I think you’re simply making my teaching much more clear.”
Cas does nothing but glares as the room echoes with the screech of chairs and polyester bags being dragged along wax floors and both boys shuffling out of the room.
Despite his derailing thoughts, muscle memory serves him well, and he skids round the perimeter of the pitch, getting a feel for the pitch, the air, and the team that are flying around him. He looks around and—
Cas forces his gaze to look at Dean, eyes wide from the strain. He stares at him for a few moments, and despite himself, Dean can’t help but give a reassuring wink.
He's an older man, which Dean expected. There are deep crow's feet etched around his eyes, and a profile that once would've been seen to be quite dashing. And then Azazel looks at him.
" Cas is yelling, sprinting towards the end of the pitch. He turns to person closest to him, which happens to Michael. "Get me a broom, I have to --"
“Grounded. She’s been suspended from playing for the rest of the year.” She smirks. “What’s wrong, Winchester? Have I thrown you off your strategy?”
Dean barely acknowledges a hand, firm, grasp around his arm, pulling him to the floor, as the muddled outline of a figure stands in front of him. They raise their wand, and as the soft ethereal glow of a dove glides before the creatures, the spell echoes across the quidditch pitch.
” Castiel snarls. Lucifer raises his hands up in mock surrender. They fall silent. Lucifer looks down.
He passes it to Bobby, who opens it. His expression becomes more and more steely the longer he looks.  Dean feels his chest tightening.
Castiel rejoins them as everyone jumps on their own brooms to get into position, stopping beside Dean with alarming speed. The movement has ruffled his hair up already, and Dean tries to not look at it too long.
Cas feels his hand start to hover towards his wand, hidden in the pocket of his waistcoat, until the figure walks underneath some of the candles lighting up the bridge. It’s Michael.
He’s still trying to look at Jack, but upon having no other choice, glances at Dean. He forces a smile. “Of course.”
Dean slams Chuck against the wall again, not unlike how he'd had to watch Lucifer do to Cas. "You wanted to kill off Sam because he was dangerous, like you killed my mom, and my dad, 'cause he was a marine--"
Dean frowns, glancing at Castiel. “I mean, that’s what I’m tryin to do. With various levels of success, as you’ve seen.”
He looks over to the concentration of people gathered round one of the beds, and blinks when he sees Cas stood there. He’s leaning over the figure in the bed. Clearing his throat, Dean opens his mouth to call for his brother.
“I didn’t want to draw attention to ourselves.” He remarks, “You’re not supposed to know explicit details about the challenge before you turn up to them.”
"Magical would be easier," Dean acknowledges, tilting his head ever so slightly down, "But personal is
Dean stares down at his own hands. "I'm the only one of my family you haven't tried to kill." Dean remarks. He hated shitty pretenses, and he'd spent too much time lingering in courthouses. He has no clue how Sammy puts up with it. "Even though I'm the one who was lookin' into stuff. Why?"
Bobby moves the saucepan, banging it in his frustration. "He carted you boys around for years, dumping you in motels and our laps because the insurance ruled it as an electrical fault, but he damn well knew it wasn't the case. Someone had killed her." Bobby scrambles for a bowl, opening and slamming cupboard doors as he does so. Eventually he pulls out a faded pink bowl with painted flowers on the side. The china has started to crack. "Mary was a lawyer, just like Sammy, and yer Dad was sure that she'd found something out she shouldn't. He'd never tell me much though." He glances down at the journal. "Y'might wanna spend time reading through it if you haven't already. What has Sam had to say 'bout it?"
Dean casts a glance to the journal on the seat beside him. He should at least show Sam that. Take out the last page? Yes. Maybe. Dammit.
Castiel is silent for a long, long moment. “Lucifer is a selfish, egotistical little bitch.” He mutters, and Dean raises an eyebrow.  “He’ll only want Jack just to further himself, and considering what I’ve seen him do to other relationships of varying kinds, I--” Cas squeezes his eyes shut for a moment, and takes a deep breath. “I… I can’t let that happen to Jack, even
He stares at the bottle of beer as Dean opens it for him. He notices the slight shake in Dean's hands.
Cas waits until he's close enough, stepping beside Dean. He nods. "Hello, Jack." he says, and then nods at Dean without smiling.
The hospital wing is quiet. The sun filters through the window, highlighting particles of dust as they float, suspended. The sun filters through the window, highlighting particles of dust as they float, suspended. Mid afternoon. Twilight would be sinking in soon.
Crowley had warned him as much. He knew as much himself. And if Lucifer couldn't do it by any means necessary, he sure was going to impart an example on those who
"Hello, Dean." Eileen greets with a smile and a slight lisp. Castiel squints a little, until she turns to him. He notes the slow way that her eyes scan him in the manner that one would to someone who has been aptly described before would be. "And you must be Castiel."
Jody and Cas watch from the ground, arms folded against the stubborn breeze. Somewhere in the background, an announcer - some 6th year student - is commenting on what is happening. Neither of the teachers aren’t really paying attention, eyes following the small figures in the sky.
Sam and Cas both look at Dean with some surprise, but he doesn’t take his eyes off of Michael. Michael stares at Dean with an eyebrow raised.
"Dunno what you're talking about. Anyway, nothing happened, dunno if anything will. His kid is still my student and you're still helpin' him, so I'm sure I'll see him around at some point. No big deal."
Dean lays on his bed, arms behind his head. He stares at the picture framed on the wall. A woman with long flowing hair and a chubby cheeked four year old, their heads pressed together as though there's nothing else worth feeling.
Castiel walks in stride beside Michael, and he’s certain Michael is trying to keep him just under his pace. Michael, with some indignation, glances around the pitch, then looks up. Castiel is talking.
“I’m sorry about the other day, Cas, at the gas station. Shouldn’t have brought anything up, specially you bein’ in the middle of work and all.”
"Yes — I'm getting married in a few months." Sam remarks. "I'll move out after that, then Dean's going to have the apartment to himself.”
Dean watches Cas for a long moment. He turns back to his coffee, staring into the murky brew. “You loved her.” He murmurs, barely a question.
Castiel was pale, alright, but he was clearly a step above death. Not by much, if the whimpers, and the cold sweat on the forehead said anything.
. He now found it hard to sleep anywhere else—any lady's bedroom or motel room he'd ended up in these days he'd found himself tossing and turning most of the night.
Castiel stands up beside Dean, wand ready. He places his right foot in front of Dean, shielding him. Somewhat childishly, Dean shuffles, and they stand side by side.
Dean doesn't even bother knocking, instead pushing the door open and entering the house. He peers into the pokey landing.
Castiel slides a book across an old, marred desk. A few seconds later he drops some coins into the shopkeeper’s hands.
Dean shrugs. “Hey, even if it is your dick bag of a brother, I’m sure I could handle him. No biggy.”
,” Jody manages to catch Castiel admonish as they walk by. “You need to stop with the posturing. It’s looking apparent that you’re compensating for something.”
I am not going to evade the severity of this; if you come into a confrontation with Lucifer or any of his followers, you will enter into a life or death confrontation.”
“Hey, brother.” Sam acknowledges. Dean smiles at him, before another question drops in his mind. If Sammy was here, then…
“The final challenge, the one that will conclude whether or not who is the ultimate Champion of our small tournament here, will be going head to head in a series of duels. The rules are this – a winners are declared once one contestant has been made incapable of defending themselves, or they are removed from the marked arena. Only disarming and defence spells allowed. Any that do so will be disqualified. The one to come out victorious shall be our Champion. So, to begin:” Bobby shuffles around some papers, and then looks out at the others. “As he is in last place currently, Dean Winchester shall be duelling first.”
When Castiel returns to the bunker, he finds an unfamiliar woman beside Sam. Though his nostrils seem to pick up a faint scent he may have come upon one of the Winchesters before. Begrudgingly, he thinks that perhaps this could have been one of Dean's past flings. Castiel is surprised out of that thought when watching the woman slip her hand into Sam’s and interlock their fingers. A part of Castiel swells at the idea that Sam may have found himself a mate. Sam for the most part sounds content as he introduces Castiel to Eileen - the hunter that should have died long ago. Castiel can't help but to chuckle at Eileen's use of sarcasm as she says "I got better."
Castiel nods, swallowing a lump of nerves. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel’s middle, sitting the not too light omega into his lap. He nuzzles Castiel’s neck, laying butterfly kisses upon the newly formed mating mark.
Dean swallows a lump in his throat, his scent turning sour. They both knew Mary drew the short straw in a messy world. That no matter what they could have done, Mary would still have her own grave to go back to. The knowledge didn’t make it hurt any less. Castiel feels himself be lifted into Dean’s lap, shudders when Dean rests his head in the crook of his neck. A drip of something wet contrasts against his skin.
Dean finds him outside. As best man he'd been running around most of the day looking after things so Sammy didn't have to, and this was one of the first moments of reprieve he'd found to go outside, tucking his blazer over his arm and sighing gently at the breeze bringing relief.
They remain in silence for some ways down the corridor, walking side by side with rucksacks and satchels slung over shoulders. Their footfalls patter down the hallway ahead of them.
She pauses for a moment, looking away as someone talks to her offscreen. She signs at them, before glancing back down. "There was a fire in the house. In the bedroom, Sam--"
He catches something out of the corner of his eye. As he turns around, he sees Castiel diving down towards the bottom of the pitch. He sees the snitch, having just been released. For a few moments Dean forgets to even move, so lost in how quickly Castiel managed to spot the snitch, and then his brain kicks into gear. He pushes at the end of his broom, and swoops down to meet where he can now see it, flickering around with a low buzz.
“It was… a lot, to ask me to alter her charm on the blackboard, just for a small advantage. I could’ve helped—”
excited," she states, before turning to look back at Chuck. Chuck looks at Bobby. He holds up a whistle.
I know headlines have looked a little daunting, and I’ve heard that you’ve had some incidents happen here at the school very recently… but as you can see we’re all trying to do our best to keep you all safe. This is part of the reason I’m here.
“Hello, Mr. Winchester--Dean.” Castiel - Cas (why’d the guy have such a long name, anyway?) notes, a plastic bag hanging from his fingers.
Dean slides on the bench next to Cas, and leans against him. He slides an arm along the back of the bench, and ignores the ache in his thighs.
The evening has found itself clear, stars hanging above the valley of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. They are huddled in a corner, by a misted window. Cas is gazing into his butterbeer as though it’s about to climb in his throat of its own accord. Dean inches his mug across the table, until it lightly taps his.
“No, it’s alright. I think I overreacted a little. It's understandable you would know it from being his teacher."
“An Anti-Paralysis potion is the aim of this challenge. Better hurry up, you have 30 minutes before their body starts thinking the paralysis is more than just a temporary estate. You don’t want to know what that might look like.”
“Thanks for coming, everyone. I’ve chosen you all specifically, as representatives of the Ministry. Uh, I’m still getting used to this, sorry - there’s a lot of people in the Ministry! But we’re going to Hogwarts to celebrate a new era and reassure the students in light of recent events, and I feel you’d all be most qualified --”
The room is neatly arrayed with various toys, unpacked with the efficiency of a pro ikea-assembler. Crafts and activities have all been prepared across the classroom tables, walls stapled in new various motivational posters, such as
Castiel stares down at the plaque for a few moments. Jack tumbles off, distracted by something a little further down the row. Normally, Castiel would let him wander a little, but today he grips on.
Dean grunts as Cas manages to kick the end of his broom, jerking him into some of the scaffolding. Dean untangles himself from the stand, adjusting his balance, and he looks down.
“And surely, as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, it should have occurred to you, Castiel, what true danger the Ministry considers Hogwarts to be in if it feels the need to send such creatures. You should be advising the Headmaster to implement further curfews, restricting anyone from being on the grounds alone, especially once it is dark.”
Castiel slowly looks at him, deep enough that Dean feels like his childhood is being scanned. Cas sighs, and turns back towards the door. “I hope so.” He murmurs. “He’s a lot like his mother.”
Castiel frowns, but shakes his head. “She died in childbirth. It became clear early on that it would be incredibly risky for her, but she always insisted on following through, no matter how many times people told her to get rid of him and save herself. Always said it'd be worth it, no matter what." When Cas looks at Dean, Dean almost loses his breath when he sees the tears in his eyes. “She was right, more than she’d ever know.”
Dean sighs against Cas's lips, and holds him close. Cas reaches, fingers brushing against arms. He hums. "And I'll choose mine."
Dean whoops and cheers louder than anyone. He holds Sammy close, closer than he would have done a few weeks ago, if that was even possible. He lifts up Eileen and spins her around, her small stature with arms stronger than you'd possibly imagine out of such a small woman. Sam would be in good hands. As would she.
The other man chuckles, and it Dean turns to look at him with his eyebrows raised. Cas frowns at him. “What?”
"I'd like that." he murmurs, and Dean realises he's tearing up. Surprising even himself, he doesn't panic.
The night sky, previously littered with hundreds and hundreds of stars, are now blocked with its own cloud of darkness. One that is big enough to cover most of the pitch. One that is descending very rapidly to Dean.
“Professor,” he nods, glancing at the student. Kaia looks at Jody, who dismisses her. They nod and run off, grabbing a broom to join the game. Jody turns to Dean, and Dean smiles.
Visiting the cemetery always feels grey, and damp. The mood always feels reflected in the weather, even six years later.
Michael observes Dean for a few moments, and glances over at Sam. “Well, if only Dementors were weakened against quick wit.” He glances at Castiel, “I’ve wasted enough time. I should be returning to the Minister.”
. Eugh.” Meg scoffs, and drops the book beside Castiel’s body, whimpering. She steps over him, standing next to Alastair. “Let’s go.”
And it’s here, Cas backing Dean up against the wall in the darkened corridor, hands pressing to shoulders, blue eyes staring up deep against his own, breaths mingling and fingers tugging at collars—
It’s a quiet part of town that Cas directs him too, tucked away in one of the older suburbs of the area. To his relief, the lights are on when Dean pulls up.
Jack stops and stares at the small plaque that is in front of them. The fresh bouquet of flowers is only just starting to wilt, no doubt revived by the recent rainfall. Castiel stares at them for a moment, eyes narrowing. He looks at his own fresh bouquet.
Jack’s lip wobbles a little as he looks at them both, before he gently takes Anna’s hand. “Okay, Aunty.” He nods. “If you really need my help.”
“Hey,” Dean soothes. “It’s gonna be okay. I’m not gonna let Lucifer near him again, and something will work out, I’m sure of it. Hey, uh.” Dean swallows, debates on removing his hand. “My lil’ bro actually just graduated from law school. Passed his bar exam and everything.  If I ask, I’m sure he’ll help out. This sort of thing is kinda why he wanted to get into it to begin with.” Dean chuckles. “Was always a smart kid.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters, stuffing his hands in his cloak pockets. Wizarding society loved their Victorian-era fashion, but like hell was he walking around without any pockets in his clothes. “Guy doesn’t know when to quit. Did you notice he wasn’t at the second challenge? I wonder-”
Dean falters. “… So you were protectin’ us.” His voice lowers, and he directs it to the ground. “Again.”
Sam, but he can sense him hovering in the kitchen on the other side of the room. The rest of the apartment is dark but for one of the lamps in the kitchen silhouetting his figure. It was like Sam was
finding yourself under investigation for links to a murder inquiry--especially after what you may have just confessed to me this very moment. I think saying that this puts your appeal for custody on shaky ground is an
It’s Jack, sat at the table, hunched over. He doesn't seem to notice that Dean is there, gripping the pen tightly and writing on paper that Dean recognises as the extra homework he gave to some of the kindergarteners. Jack is concentrating so hard his tongue is sticking out.
“Fine.” Lucifer says, voice suddenly hard. “I wanted to be civil. We’ll see how long it takes for Jack to know how you've lied to him, then. It'll be sooner than you think."
Lucifer comes to a stop. Dean has his eyes squeezed shut as he tries to gather his breath (unable to hide the grin)  and then...
They were stood watching Cas, stood at the edge of the radius of rubble that had surrounded him Even if the children had no concept of how to control their magic, they certainly knew how to prevent the magic from hurting themselves. He pants.
It's one of Lucifer's loons making that exclamation, and it's panicked enough to stop his assault. He turns around slowly.
There were still some kids running around, pent up energy from a day of staying inside, twisting among tables still covered in glitter and paper from crafts time earlier. It was his first day back at work and

.” He warns. “Read it, then come find me. I’m patrolling the Grounds this evening in preparation for tomorrow. Come and find me if you want to discuss it further.”
"Hey, Sammy. Cas," Dean notes, and Cas finally looks at him. They stare for a moment. "How're things?"
Dean stares at the revolving doors. "Yeah, but he ain't Cas," he mumbles. "Pretty sure I know what Jack cares 'bout more."
This is my first time creating something on this scope and nursing this baby unseen for so long, so I'm nervous and excited to put it out into the world finally!
As he opens it, he pulls out scraps of paper - and realises that they're all receipts, or invoices. Confusion bubbling in him, Castiel opens his door (glancing around to see he's not being watched), before sliding in and sifting through them.
Dean shuffles his hands in his pockets, before slapping two notes onto the counter. “Keep the change,” he murmurs. He takes his items and leaves. Castiel pretends not to watch him go.
He feels Sam stare at him, eyebrow raised, and something in his subconscious wriggles uncomfortably. Dean wheezes.
Castiel stares for so long at Dean, Dean can’t help but find himself wanting to look away, for the sake of both of them.
Dean rubs at the back of his neck. He’s in his regular quidditch attire, but there isn’t any mud on his boots. He hasn’t been out onto the pitch, then. “Yea, good. Well, y’know.” He pauses. “Not a great nights sleep, but what can you do, yeah?”
Dean reaches the end of the platform and swings round, wand poised. To his surprise, Cas is already waiting, and hasn’t cast a spell. Yet.
Cas gives a nod, before grasping the bottle and touching the neck with Dean's. It clinks and they both swallow more than they intend. Dean coughs.
Quiet nods, some murmurs, and Dean motions to the line he is looking at. A chorus of ‘up!’ echo, brooms flying to hands, and the shuffle of positions being taken. The acquired grace of flying makes it very obvious what students had been brought up as a muggle, or at least rich enough to own a broom. Even though he’d picked it up remarkably quickly, he remembers the pre-teen shame of those first few lessons.
Sam glares at him. Then throws a soul piercing stare, the one that only a younger sibling can graduate with, one that has seen you through every goddamn awkward and regretful moment of your life. A sibling that equips the insight that comes with knowing
He remembers the day before, when Cas had entered his cramped office after the school's sessions had been done for the day. Dean had smiled at him, until he'd spotted the envelope clutched in the Professor's hand. It had been the details of their challenge.
He tries to look down, to see if anyone on the stadium has spotted, tries to see if Cas or even Michael is there. Sam and Claire are still ahead of him, thankfully. At least the Dementors haven't gotten to them yet.
Pulling the hood up on his robes, he pushes the door open with a small creak, the bells on the door tingling as Cas leaves.
, his body urges, and he suddenly wants to do nothing but to curl up and never move again. His training throws itself against his conscience.
The chalk long dismissed, the board simply reads ‘Two full pages on the characteristics of Grindylows.’ Naomi spends just enough time staring at the board for Dean to shuffle uneasily in his seat.
. Things were manageable. Had to meet and get a few contracts signed every now and again, but what of it? Sometimes I'd have to go visit him
as my elder brother called him, left when I was young. All I really remember is that he loved to play the guitar. But I... know what it is to grieve, Dean, I can--"
He cringes at the silence that follows, but is surprised when he forces himself to look up at Cas. Castiel is staring at him, mouth parted. He blinks at him.
They come to a stop at the top of the Grand Staircase, soft groans of wood as the stars shift throughout the hall. Castiel gazes at him.
The audience ambience suddenly drops a level, and all of them turn to see what the reason is. Chuck has stepped onto the pitch. Michael and Meg are at his side, along with the Headmaster. Cas stiffens considerably.
"Dean." Sam sighs. "You should've seen how he talked about you when I met with him earlier. He also said yes to the date."
The door is ajar as he approaches. He pushes the door open and peers in, quietly. The furniture is well-worn but good quality. The wallpaper hasn't been replaced in some time. Whole house needs a fresh lick of paint. Dean pulls out his phone. Blinking reception. Typical.
" Eileen exclaims, urgently. She grips under his arm and tugs hard as she can. They both stumble out, tumbling onto the landing. The flames were beginning to crawl around the door-frames, and while Eileen attempts to go out to close the door she hisses as her hand burns on the handle. Too late, too much.
Dean nods, and hesitantly removes his hand. He reaches back for his coffee. “Jack will too, when he’s old enough, trust me.” Dean denotes, finishing the rest of his drink. “There’s a big difference between a father and a dad—” Dean glances at him, and their knees brush. “— and I know I ain’t just looking at a father right now.”
“Nah, she could’ve caught us talking. Besides, isn’t it way more satisfying knowing that you could counter the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor’s own charm?”
Chuck smiles uneasily as he takes a few steps forward, stepping over the markings to enter the arena. Castiel stares down at the boundary line, then back up to Michael. He frowns.
“How’s the kid doing? He runnin' with mom this weekend?” Cas glances up just to see Dean’s face fall, as though he regretted the words falling from his mouth. Cas simply shakes his head, his hands scanning the items purely from muscle memory.
“… Grindylows?” Castiel questions, and to Dean’s surprise Cas is trying not to laugh. He blinks at him for a moment, unsure how to respond to the brevity that was surfacing within the most serious wizard and teenager he’d ever met.
Dean nods, and doesn't move his gaze from him. "Well, lemme treat you. Both of you. Wherever you wanna take Jack for the day, my treat."
Bobby had given him leave, later that day. Take a long weekend, he'd said, with a knowing look. It had only been a few days since their kiss outside the infirmary, but word travelled fast.
Castiel sighs. “I am. Or, as much as one can be that has a brother breathing down his collar at every opportune moment.” He places his piece of chalk down, dusting his hands. “I’m assuming this is about the tournament? Congratulations.”
All the staff members were gathered around in the staff room, looking curiously at each one. One or two of them held grim faces; they seem to know what the news was about.
Jack's father stares after Jack as he disappears. He expels a long sigh, closing his eyes for a moment, before turning back to Dean. He looks at him, and hot
Castiel lays his heart on the table, gives Dean what he asks, but as he speaks and anger curls at his chest, all Dean can find himself doing is… looking. Looking at Cas, the soft laughter lines against his eyes creasing as he frowns, the way he rubs calloused fingers against the stubble on his cheek. The way he curls over his drink, his waistcoat and grass-stained robe dwarfing him for once in his life.
The news was not what he was expecting. He’s staring at the cursive, written in the slightly shaky curl of Professor Singer.
Dean nods, smiling down at him. "Be fine. This isn't my first babysitter rodeo." He tilts his head, kissing Cas. Cas closes his eyes, humming. He feels him sigh against his lips.
of you up to the Headmasters office on claims for expulsion. These are very dangerous times were are living in, and we have to take precautions and be aware of the dangers and possibilities of the world we are in.”
Dean stands at the back of the classroom, hufflepuff tie sliding from round his neck. He clenches his fist.
Dean walks up at that moment, holding out the piece of paper that Jack had handed to him. Castiel blinks down at it.
“I’ve met him on a few occasions, when certain investigations have brought me to the Department of Mysteries. He’s a good man.”
With a sigh, Castiel dumps Jack's slightly damp schoolbag in the hallway, and hangs up their coats. By the time he rounds the corner into the kitchen, Anna is already pouring Jack some apple juice. Cas frowns.
Sam waits for further deliberation, but there is none. Instead, with a sigh, he tucks the letter in his desk drawer, chair creaking as he unfolds himself from behind the desk. He nods at Michael.
He reaches to his chest. Chuck's expression flickers from one of anticipation to one of confusion as Dean reaches not for the gun, but his shirt pocket.
Sam writes quicker than anyone Castiel has seen, and he leaves him in silence until Sam places his pen down with a sigh. "Definitely seems like we can have something to argue. You've cared for Jack all his life; Lucifer is still on parole, there's evidence of prior abuse. He probably has some extremely good lawyers he can afford, but we have a lot to use." Sam frowns. "And I'm not terrible, either."
Crowley raises an eyebrow as they all shuffle in, and Crowley looks pointedly at Dean, then to the door. Dean blinks dumbly for a moment, before pushing it closed with his foot.
Eventually, Dean looks over to Cas; the dipping sun has kissed long shadows across his cheekbones, and the orange hue draws out the particularly deep blue of his irises. In other words:
She grins, shuffling some lego half heartedly into a pile with her foot. "New year, new you, Dean. Hark my words."
“Cas?—” Dean murmurs, dazed, while Cas reaches for his wand. He raises it above him, and a shimmer disperses from it, encasing all four of them together in the arc of a shield.
Dean is so busy staring at the space that Lucifer once occupied he doesn’t realise he’s still holding onto Cas, until he feels a hand on his own arm. He blinks, looking to Cas gaze up at him, appearing drained.
He grabs his broom (feeling incredibly cool) and leaps off the roof, landing on his broom in mid-air. He restarts his place in the race, realising he's now in last place. He isn't worried.
"He's right," Cas says, sighing deeply, holding in a dry sob. "I'm not his father. I can't keep lying to Jack like this."
“A Dark Wizard is someone who uses their magic to gain followers and gain a following and use their magic to inflict harm, on both other wizards and muggles. They also use the unforgivable curses”
"You okay there, Dean?" She asks, hurriedly. Dean nods weakly, before he pushes himself to his feet. He turns, staggering.
We made it, folks! Welcome to the end of Part 1 of this series. Keep an eye out for the next segment.
“A toast, to a graceful loser.” Dean remarks, taking a deep drink. When he lowers the mug Cas is glaring at him.
“S’pose you’ve got a whole heap more portraits in your office, eh?” Bobby asks, when the pause becomes too long. Chuck almost startles, head jerking back to the Headmaster. He quickly shakes his head.
Dean takes a step forward, forcing Cas to trip or follow through. Dean holds onto him tight enough that Cas takes a step back, and they fall into a soft sway, gentle strings floating through the Hall's doors towards them. Dean's hands slowly slip down the other's waist.
Castiel stops, and stares at Dean, surprised. Dean feels himself flush, and tries not to trip over himself in what he suspects might be a one-chance only before he blows it all over again.
“Bye! Bye, Mister, Mister Winchesteeer,” Jack sings, voice drifting down the corridor as Castiel, with one last nod in goodbye, turns and carries him out.
The stadium that is facing Chuck as he turns around reels in shock, and realisation falls into place for Cas at that moment.
“Oh,” Dean mumbles, a bit stunned at the simplicity of it. Had his fate really just been hinged on this man’s idle thought?
They look at each other. Castiel glances to his right, where the corridor leads to where the rest of the Aurors will be. The corridor is now filled with debris and is almost impassible without the use of magic and some skilful dexterity. He’s unsure how they haven’t heard the commotion, and the first strike of panic clenches at his stomach. He holds onto it, and buries it deep.
“I like to see and feel what I’m writing, Minister.” Bobby simply replies, tilting the glass back against his lips. He places it back on the wooden desk with a soft chnk. “To what can I owe the visit?”
"This is a matter to resolve inside the courtroom," Sam says, testily. "So I think this conversation can continue there, when properly due."
Jack looks up suddenly, blinking very hard in surprise at seeing his kindergarten teacher there. "Mr... Mr Winchester?" He tries, after a few moments. Dean gives him a large grin.
He halts as he feels something jab in his chest. He looks down to see Cas scowling, wand pressing against his ribcage.
"You can give 'em whatever name you like. They don't mind. And if you ever get scared or frightened, you can hold onto them and they'll help you be less afraid. They can even tell me if you're not feeling good, without you ever saying a word."
"Jody needed some help lookin' at her car. Couldn't find her and found Jack looked like he needed some help with his abcs."
Castiel squints at her, before reaching for a towel. He dries his hair for a moment. "I won't need you later."
There’s silence as Jack leaves, before Dean, who'd been frozen the whole time as though watching the Gods themselves work in front of him, clears his throat. “You’re really good with him, y’know?”
Dean nudges Charlie as he shuffles his way into the great hall, which had been cleared of its usual contents for the latest challenge. Charlie, who was trying to pry away one of the students with a notebook, manages to shoo him away before turning to Dean. She raises an eyebrow.
Castiel still isn't sure if Jack really understands why he’s here. He knows that he recognises his mother—he can point at pictures and say her name and who she was, even to people who visit the house. Jack is a smart kid, and in some ways a lot more perceptive than he let on, even as a six year old.
"And how are we sure that Castiel is capable of providing a stable living environment? If this is not the case, then surely Jack's ultimate upbringing would be best with his
Castiel stares at it, then stares at the other bouquet that was there before they were. He looks at Jack, who was looking at him curiously. He hands the bouquet to Jack.
He crawls under the sheets with a sigh of relief. They'd been recently changed. He feels himself lulled to sleep, too tired to wonder where Eileen is.
Castiel says nothing. He marches behind Lucifer as he leaves. Lucifer gives one last look. Castiel doesn’t take his eyes off of him until he sees the car disappear out of sight. He lingers a few more minutes just to be sure, before eventually stepping inside. He locks the door, leans against it, and drops his head in his hands. He lets out a long sigh, tries to ignore the shaking in his hands.
He hears Claire’s very loud shout, but is too busy trying to keep his own temperament. He glances to Sam, who is simply staring at Jess.
Dean makes it down one hall before he senses the quick paces of someone behind him, and stubbornly refuses to let himself turn around, no matter how much he was anticipating their arrival.
Dean spends the next hour on his drive home with the name thrumming through his mind. Does he tell Sam? He should, he
but he slowly gives it up. Cas leans over and deposits it safely on the couch, pulling an intense ab crunch to lean that far without falling into the lava pool of the Lego. He is
incident at the gas station, and then if Gabriel hadn't called in a last minute favor to pick up some stock for the bar, and then if the rain hadn't called everyone and their godmothers to sit in the highway, then he'd have been
Castiel is not finished speaking yet. “Please… Please, don’t make my last moments be spent watching you die. Just run. Save yourselves. And I will hold Ramiel off as long as I can…”
Castiel meanders his way through the kitchen, slowing his step as he hears a rather loud bang from up the second story. He briskly walks toward the sound, pausing at the top of the stairs when he realises that this is Sam and Eileen’s wedding night. An image of Dean winking and making some lewd comment about ‘bumping in the night’ causes his face to pale. When he turns his head, ready to leave the newlyweds in peace though he notices two figures at the bottom of the stairs. Eileen in her white dress has her head tilted in confusion, looking unsure between Castiel and her new husband.
Castiel knows he shouldn’t lash out at Eileen but if the brothers were comfortable around Castiel in heat then why should her opinions matter. So what if Dean left him in the hotel room alone the first time Castiel was threatened with heat or that Sam wasn’t there at all in Rexford. Maybe Dean – Maybe Dean helped him through that time but it didn’t mean anything. Castiel knew this. Didn’t Eileen understand?
“You’re the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless loving human being I will ever know.” Castiel smiles a wet curve of the lips that causes Dean’s heart to sink.
“Cas…” Dean kneels beside Castiel, wrapping his arms over his shoulders and pulling Castiel's head to his chest.
Castiel craved day in and day out, seeking out comfort of any kind. He yearns to be close to an alpha but unfortunately the one he wants is nowhere near him and Castiel can't bring himself to contact his friend. Not for something so small. However, the woman he works with, Nora… she smells faintly similar to Dean. Smells like pie but, instead of apple, it's cherry. She doesn't smell heavily like leather but she does own a brown faux leather jacket that Castiel has the urge to sniff. At one point, there was the one incident where Castiel had accidentally spilled motor oil over her. The odor she wore brought back memories of sitting in the backseat of the Winchesters’ impala. Flashes and glimpses of what Castiel would call simpler times; days where he didn’t have to worry about the mundane. Demons and monsters, they were familiar, much like the pride that bubbles in his vessel's chest whenever Dean pat him on the shoulder. Nora would pat his shoulder as well when she thought Castiel did well in the store but… she was an omega; not an alpha and it wasn’t the same
He is kicked out of the nest he helped to build; confusion fogs Castiel's train of thought. Shouldn’t it be customary to sleep in a nest made for an omega; one that Castiel had mistakenly believed was for his own comfort, his own little home on Earth?
Castiel knows relationships haven't come easily for Sam since the loss of his first mate. The one he would have proposed to if Lucifer hadn't had other thoughts in mind. The two of them - they deserved better than what they got. Perhaps now, Sam could properly move on.
It’s at that point that Castiel chooses to no longer defend his own life. He gives the choice to Lily, relaying his condolences and letting her know that if she could not forgive him then she can find him again. The compromise leaves an unsettling feeling in Dean’s stomach. Castiel will not spare Dean a glance. He remains silent during the whole ride home – no snappy comments or a fight to bicker.
Concern grasps at Castiel’s mind instantaneously, a fatherly urge to wipe away that frown overcomes him. Castiel wishes to grab Jack by the cheeks and push the ends of his lips upward but the child pulls away before he can. “Jack? What is wrong?”
in a way he could not explain nor comprehend. Castiel had a yearning. A certain longing for something more, something special. Something with Dean Winchester in mind.
Castiel struggles to come up with anything at all and Dean provides him with the perfect excuse: "You miss Jack?"
His chest feels heavy, his arms falling without strength to keep them up. Dean walks forward, closing the distance between him and Castiel. His last moments would be spent with the angel that had fell for him time and time again. That saw Dean as the ‘righteous man’, as his human weakness. Dean could at the very least bring him comfort, knowing that not once has Castiel ever been able to watch Dean be hurt without giving himself away to protect the hunter. It’s a luxury Dean didn’t deserve. He destroyed everything that he touched.
“Don’t be.” Mary hushes Castiel. “You did your best. There wasn’t any way you could have known what would happen.”
This was all fine and dandy until Castiel began to feel hot and bothered. His body would ache in ways the falling angel was unused to - a dull pain in his hips causing his legs to wobble. He would sweat when under no other circumstances had he done so before - as if the sun was burning him alive from lightyears away. He would crave and give in to burying himself under hotel blankets - a habit that has earned Castiel many scoldings from Dean, whose bed he occupied the most. Castiel would carefully take a chance at sniffing Dean's leather jackets when the alpha wasn’t around or pulling Sam’s larger fitting flannels over his shoulders - any clothing they discarded was free gain for the angel. These things brought comfort to him but they could also rile Castiel up.
“…why does that sound like a goodbye..?” Dean tilts his head, a drowning feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“But...” Sam opened his mouth in disbelief, unable to put into words what he was feeling in the moment.
Dean scoffs, a tint of red on his ears. He doesn’t respond to Castiel about the risk that he takes by laying the way he does in a pick-up truck. Dean will be careful he tells himself, allowing Castiel to use his legs as a pillow and easily slip into unconsciousness. Shuddering a breath, Dean settles a free hand in Castiel’s unruly hair. His other hand grips the steering wheel firmly, eyes locked on the road.
Castiel sniffled. He wondered how long Dean had been sleeping in the bunker bedroom. If the room held all of Dean's little trinkets he stole, if he personalized it with all of his favorite things. Castiel thought that perhaps if Dean slept in it long enough, the bed would smell like the alpha. And he hoped that his alpha… that Dean wouldn’t bring any other omega into his new home.
“No. No, you’re not.” Dean’s fingers brush upon Castiel’s when he takes the fabric of his shirt and hides those dangerous marks. Dean’s nightmares are coming true. The images have haunted him for nights, the thought that Castiel would cease to exist one day. That something does him in and sends Castiel back to Heaven or worse… Where did angels go when they died?
“What I mean is,” Dean hisses at the sting of a scratch, “I’m not trying to get cozy with the woman upstairs. She was coming onto me. I can’t blame her though.”
Castiel squeals, his eyelids popping open. His mouth opens wide in surprise, toes curling at the new sensation coming from behind. Castiel fists the sheets in his hands, bends his forehead to the mattress in prayer.
Dean releases a breath neither of them thought he was holding, as if knocked in the stomach with a sucker punch. Dean growls, roughly flipping Castiel onto his stomach. The omega hisses at the velocity, his hips dragged up by firm hands. Castiel can’t see Dean, can’t tell what he is doing. He hears the rustle of fabric, feels the cool air hit his bare ass as his boxers are removed. Castiel bites his lip, eyes screwed shut in a moment of panic.
In all of his existence, Castiel had never felt the way that he does now after resigning from the word of God. He is still new to Earth and human kindness; he is an angel lost to everyone except for the Winchester brothers. Castiel has had no one to fall back on save for Sam and Dean, the humans that he defied Heaven for. The angel didn’t know it then but the brothers were family to him, a little group closer to himself than the angels ever were in the past millennium. Castiel nearly fell midway through the first apocalypse he fought in. For the first time in his breathful years, Castiel began to feel what it was to be alive. He felt the connection – the bonds – that humans formed. Their friendships. Their compassion. Their love. It was the first time he ever felt remotely human.
For the moment, Sam ignores his brother. He opens the trucks' passenger door, all of Castiel's belongings conveniently sat in one box on top of the seat. Sam's eyes soften, an uneasy feeling in his stomach. To think that every little thing that made up Castiel's self fit in a small cardboard containment did not settle Sam's remorse. Picking the box up with two hands, Sam nearly jumps backwards as he turns face to face with Dean in his own personal space bubble.
Castiel rests his hand on Dean’s shoulder. The same hand – the same shoulder that Castiel had first laid siege on his soul and pulled him out of hell. Dean can’t lose Castiel.
“Hey, hey. Slow down.” Dean nibbles on Castiel’s ear, “You’re looking for the wrong dick, my sweet little angel.”
. Castiel sniffs himself as if he doubts her but it’s true. He stinks of wanton lust. The ache in his head extends to his hips and if Castiel paid it mind he would realize that a dribble of slick coated the back of his underwear. Castiel frowned as he wiped away the sweat that was sticking to his neck.
Castiel obeys, his eyelids sliding shut. He wants this. He truly does but it’s not the same. Castiel submits underneath Dean, arching his neck in hopes of being bitten.
Part of Castiel didn't want to look at Dean after that but his omega won out because Castiel began to feel hot. Something stirred within him as they rode in the impala. He purred and mewled, rubbing his cheek against the leather seats. If he had paid more attention then maybe he would have heard Dean swallow a growl, or seen the way he adjusted his pants. Castiel mewled and Dean told him he wouldn't let Castiel sleep out in the cold that night.
“Cas, no.” Dean says. Mary places her hand on Castiel’s arm, lightly pushing against the angel to keep him in place.
Currently Castiel resides in the bunker's kitchen in wait for the Winchesters to awake. They have hopeless brainstorming to do, an oncoming apocalypse to attend to. Anxiety prods at Castiel’s chest, words catching in his head about worthlessness and guilt. Guilt for allowing Jack to go unattended, for saying nothing as Castiel watched his soul be eaten away. The angel is guilty for Mary, knowing that without the visible wall between right and wrong, Jack had gone too far and yet his powers unleash themselves in a whiplash. Maybe if Castiel had sat Jack down after watching him put the Gorgons snake out of its depression, Castiel could have helped him. Could have kept both Mary and his son alive. Then perhaps the angel’s friendship with Dean would still be intact…
"No. No, that's not what I mean." Dean groans, the noise too sultry for comfort. "Cas can get his own crap. Why are his things even still in the truck?"
Castiel’s canines dig deeper into his bottom lip, his grasp on Dean’s hand strengthening. This is it, he thinks. Castiel widens his mouth on a gasp, eyes flashing a bright blue. Dean will be his. Castiel’s chest rumbles, his heart beating faster. Not from their activity alone but from who Castiel is spending his first heat with.
It’s Sam who prys Dean away when Castiel is not strong enough to, wiggling his way in between brother and mother to hold on to Mary. Castiel knows by the way Sam’s arms are lax around Mary that he is ready to let go, that he’s been ready for a short time now. It’s equally as painful to watch yet Castiel cannot turn away.
Sam’s scent was a familiar presence. He brought a similar attachment to how Castiel felt around other angels, a stronger kind of bond that surpassed those of his siblings in Heaven. Castiel felt protective and protected around Sam. He could allow his walls to crumble down, allow Sam into his broken soul to help it mend and rebuild. Castiel felt no pain, no anger or resentment from Sam. Perhaps he had seen Sam as nothing but an abomination at one point but that was before they had grown closer together. Before Castiel entrusted Sam with his life. Before the hours spent cramped in an all too small car on long drives. Before struggling with addictions such as drinking demon blood and scarfing down raw red meat. Before Castiel felt a pull towards Earth. Before his travels with the Winchesters disgraced the heavens above.
Dean's groin rolled along Castiel's most sensitive spots causing more fluid to leak from the omega’s behind. Castiel bit his lip trying to hold back noise as he felt Dean’s hard cock, as he pictured Dean ramming his knot into his virgin ass.
“Of course I want to go with you, Jack!” Castiel is baffled that Jack would think otherwise but then the rest of Jack's question is heard and Castiel's confusion turns to awe. His face whitens, drained of a sentiment he can’t quite name.
Castiel buried his nose into the crook of Dean's neck, inhaling deeply. Castiel kissed Dean's mating gland, secreting erotic scents of his own hoping to hold the attention of the alpha. Castiel must have succeeded as Dean groaned, biting deep into Castiel's neck. Mere centimeters from the omegas mating gland. Castiel dugs his nails into Dean’s back, his own fangs digging into the alpha’s shoulder.
“I know.” The knowledge that Jack couldn’t - wouldn’t - stay hurt. Castiel tucked away his feelings, used to hiding the emotions he shouldn’t feel. “Your strength is needed up there.”
The transformation into something new was difficult. It was happening over a slow stretch of time, almost unnoticeable. A new sweet scent seeped from the neck glands on Castiel’s new body that once secreted the muted scent of redwood and cocoa. Those were familiar smells, aroma’s that have grown with Jimmy Novak as he aged. Now for whatever the reason, these scents were changing to form something of Castiel’s own. Forming a concept that shouldn’t apply to Castiel. He shouldn’t feel the warmth of his body or the tremble of a purr in his throat when someone –
"Omega," Dean responded through gritted teeth with vigor. "Gonna treat you right, Cas. Gonna show you a golden time."
Castiel watched Sam pick up a necklace that carries a simple loose banded ring from the box of items and pocket it into his coat. The angel remains uncertain of its significance. When Castiel sniffs the trunk, he leans forward. He recognizes two of three scents, able to differentiate between the old leather of a bound book (Sam) and the leather clad with sweat that sticks to the back of his trench coat when he sits in the impala (Dean). The third scent, however, is something he hasn’t smelled before. It’s faint, mixed with Sam’s omegan smell. It’s purely alpha, furious yet gentle. Perhaps the fragrance was that of rain in the midst of a thunderstorm. Castiel shifts as Sam pulls a grey scarf from the trunk, the scent more prominent now. The scarf is well-worn and carries the intricate lace of Sam and the alphas scents bonded together – the scent of a lover. Castiel's heart sinks as he remembers how Sam once had a simpler, much more normal life before having been hauled back into hunting.
Castiel grits his teeth as he tucks himself into bed after defeating the Djinn. Wrapped in his arms is the stuffed bumblebee, tucked close to his chin. He'll rest for four hours then in the morning he'll return home- he'll return back to Dean's- he'll visit Sam. At the bunker. The bunker that is just a bunker and nothing more.
The omega’s voice raises in alarm, his toes curling as he wraps them around Dean. Suddenly, Dean doubles his efforts, hitting the sweet spot inside Castiel in rapid succession. A stretching knot nudges Castiel’s entrance, breaching him but not yet large enough to stick.
“Woah? WOAH! You can’t lay there!” Dean’s knee bucks on instinct, the car screeching unceremoniously as his foot lifts momentarily off the gas pedal. “What are you doing, man? You’re gonna get yourself killed down there.”
Castiel can’t catch his breath. Not with the tongue shoved up his ass, greedily consuming all of the omega’s slick. Castiel’s dick bounces in glee, his hips rocking back in encouragement.
April had taken advantage of Castiel’s trust, using his body which at first seemed enjoyable. Though after learning that April was a reaper who found him with the intention of killing him, the sex no longer meant something special. Part of Castiel was disgusted; part of him wished he could remember their interactions in ignorant bliss. He was an omega after all, a new human with bodily functions he could barely contain. Sex… Sex was good. Sex was satisfying, but as a means of weaponry awfully hurt.
Sam stands in a sea of worry, his feet rooted to the ground. Unsure whether to chase Dean or not, knowing how snippy the alpha can be during rut, Sam clicks on Castiel's contact number.
Love? Is that what their bond is made of? The hidden meaning behind being somebody’s ‘human weakness’.
He once thought Dean to be Heaven’s savior as well but there was nothing the humans could do alone to rescue them now. Chuck – God was in control of the story.
Castiel felt lonely. He wanted his sleeping bag and his bumble bee that were still locked up in the Gas n’ Sips storage room. He wanted to feel at home - be at home. But he had no home; he only had Dean.
Castiel is no longer human, not in the flesh anyway. His grace keeps all of Castiel angelic glory intact for the time being but he's afraid his heart has already been far too damaged. The years have gone by and with every new trial and error, Castiel has come to understand that he is in love. That Dean has been his one and only since pulling him out of hell. Of course, he has cared for Sam and for Jack. He cares for Claire and Jody. Castiel keeps a special memory of Kevin and Charlie and everyone else they have lost along the way. But it was Dean that caused Castiel to care; that gave the world new light and gave way to Castiel falling in deep gratitude for the things that once seemed so small. And for that, Castiel loves Dean with all of his being.
Dean leaves that night. The room gets left open to charge on a fraudulent credit card, giving Castiel just enough time to recuperate then get out. Castiel is grateful for the time he has spent with Dean and the care the alpha has provided him.
So Dean gives him a mission, a role to follow that will keep him from trailing after Dean into death. Because Dean knows he will never be able to earn Amara’s trust or throw in the towel if Castiel is with him. Since carrying the mark and unleashing the Darkness, Castiel was the only one able to obscure Dean’s connection with Amara. Dean cannot save the world with Castiel blinding him and so Dean entrusts his brother’s life in Castiel’s hands. He uses it as a distraction to keep another one of his closest friends alive.
Castiel didn’t hear from Dean for hours after waking up that day. He had tried several times to call Dean, having not succeeded, he felt sleep pull him back into unconsciousness. He hadn’t slept for so long before; had hardly slept at all in prior months. Though due to his weakened state, Castiel had finally fallen ill to the behaviors of an omega. Castiel next woke up to the ringtone of his phone. On the other line, he heard the voice of his alpha Castiel’s omega purred at Dean’s gruff voice, his mind numb to what Dean had had said. If he concentrated enough, Castiel thinks he might have heard Dean mention smelling “sweet”, ripe enough to go into “heat” and so Dean had left. Dean explains some things about humans to Castiel that he hadn’t thought about before but when Castiel asks about the phallic toys, Dean refuses to give him a straight answer.
That’s another thing, though Sam was more courteous and thoughtful of others' reaction to his omegan scent, Dean didn’t care at all to cover his glands. He would allow his scent to overbear the bars they frequented, luring in women of all secondary gender to coitus for the night. Dean preferred that the impala - his first home - retain the smell of leather, motor oil and warm apple pie. There was something in that last fragrance that caused a fuzzy feeling in Castiel's stomach. Something about mouthwatering apple pie that caught a rumbling purr in the back of Castiel’s throat.
Castiel narrows his eyes, brows scrunched together. That was rather rude of her to say. Why did it matter if he…
Dean leaves to shortly return with breakfast, electrolytes and enough snacks to last any normal being a month. (It’s an honest miscalculation on Castiel’s part because they only last four days for the omega in heat.) Along with those goods, Dean has picked up supplies similar to what he bought him years ago, including the silicone 'dildos' Dean had tried to pass off to him the first time. Not only that…
If Castiel thought he was unlucky in the morning, his luck only grew worse as the day went on. Realizing that the monster at fault was a
Castiel mewled as Dean tightened his hold around Castiel’s waist, and all of his thoughts faded aways as he felt overbearing fatigue take over him for the first time in a millenium.
Dean lifted the pants from the outreached pile- beige pleated and from the looks of it clean (thankfully). They were definitely not something Dean would voluntarily wear. But it’s not like he had much of a choice.  “So, 1958, huh?” Dean looked to Castiel who answered with a shrug.
“Oh, I gotta take a leak.”. Getting the sudden urge, he scrambled to find a button or something to call for the nurse. But there was none. The hospital equipment in the room did not look like the modern stuff Dean was familiar seeing all those times he was laid up from hunts gone south.  Not even a t.v. (disappointing) graced the little room with its presence.  A small white nightstand stood flush against the wall to his left.
He turns to the line of students to his right. “Remember, you’re here to help each other, not to bully or tell them how to fall off even further. If I see any badmouthing you’ll be banned from flying and being part of any team for the rest of the year. Do I make that clear?”
Sam topples onto the front lawn in their neighbourhood, and is left to stare up in horror as Eileen disappears back into the building, flames beginning to roar from their bedroom window.
Dean realises he’s been looking but not watching. He squeezes his eyes shut, and with a long inhale he pushes away from his bed, straightening up. “M’ goin’ for some air.”
As they leave, Dean ignores Cas’ gentle protesting of ‘Grindylows can’t survive outside of water, you should know that Dean-’,
“Evening after the Flying challenge. I’d just come from the owlery, and Cas had just come from visiting you.”
They find themselves at Bobby's. Castiel hadn't known what the conclusion of the hearing was going to be, so he had sent Jack to Jody's for the night, just in case. Dean had come back from a call from Bobby after they had exited the courtroom, and claimed that Bobby had invited everyone round for drinks to mark the 'end of this sodding mess'. With nothing else to do, Castiel had agreed to join them for a few drinks.
Dean stretches his torso, pulling away from Castiel far enough to grin. “I’m a catch. You come on to me all the time, you know.”
Dean’s knot catches, plugs Castiel full with spurting seed and Castiel comes, his back arching off the mattress. Castiel screams, nostrils flaring and Dean… Dean burrows his teeth into Castiel's shoulder, just inches away from the omega’s mating gland.
Dean continues to shake his head. He refuses to believe this – to believe that Castiel is sacrificing himself for Dean once more.
Because when Castiel says “You’re my family… I love you…” he looks away. There is guilt and a shyness Dean has never seen in Castiel before. This confession is something he is insecure about. A vulnerability that doesn’t share the same sentiment in his next statement. “I love all of you.”
A heavy silence filled the space between them, and Dean felt the familiar panic rise in his chest. He cleared his throat. “We should, um… we should find a store, get some supplies for the 'salt and burn'.”
Dean gulped down his drink and ordered another round. He caught the glaring eyes of a group of men, squared shouldered and beefy, from across the bar. They looked ready for a fight, and him and Cas were their targets. Dean tried to ignore it.
I wanted the ending to seem like an episode with a mystery still to solve. How are Dean and Sam connected? Will they ever find the anomaly? Please leave comments if you enjoyed, or even if you didn't enjoy. Is it worth writing a sequel????? Let me know.
Deep gash vamp held Claire by the throat with one hand, her legs frantic, trying to make physical contact with the big guy’s torso but she couldn’t reach. Sam laid unconscious in the mud outside the train car for a long two minutes from a brutal whack across the chest, his shirt torn showing the bloodied slash of vampire nail.
From the back of the room, a short man with cropped dark hair lifted a beer towards Sam in recognition. “Is that Cole Trenton?” Sam mumbled more to himself.
He’d been sifting through old newspaper articles on an old microform for the past two hours. The screen of the old machine was giving him a headache. What he wouldn’t give for an actual computer and some internet service.
When they stepped outside, Dean’s immediate thought was, “so this is what Marty Mcfly must have felt when he stepped into Hill Valley for the first time”. The song Mr. Sandman began playing in a loop in his head.
Like taking the time to be with friends and loved ones. Dean once told Sam that he wanted a big funeral- big and loud and everyone there together. Well, Sam may not have been able to handle the big and loud just yet, but he did owe his big brother the ‘together’ part.
Dean cleared his throat, trying simultaneously to clear the unease but failing dismally.  He broke their gaze and dared to step over the threshold that is the doorway and sat on the edge of the bed.
He stopped dragging his feet through the hall of the bunker’s barracks and stood in front of Castiel’s door. Though the poison left his body, the angel was still weak, and recuperation was a slow process. The brothers offered up a vacant bedroom in the bunker for Castiel to rest in. Not that he really slept. But at least it was more comfortable than sitting in one of the library’s chairs all night.
Dean finally looked up at the town that surrounded them. Women in long wool skirts; men with cardigans and neutral-colored shirts with button-down collars passed by them on the sidewalk. And the hats. So many hates. Some of the people even gave him odd looks (Dean was not quite sure why- two men standing super close to each other in an obviously heated and private conversation. What’s so strange about that in the 1950’s?).
“Well,” she gulped. “We’ve been renovating the second floor, so it has just been an unruly mess up there. You see, we’ve just moved in a week ago and we have only gotten to settling everything on the first floor. Anyway, I was going through some of the boxes filled with kitchenware when I heard Hubert start to shout from the second floor. Only, it sounded as if he was having an argument with someone. Well, my goodness, I thought. Sweet Billy here was sitting just a short distance from where I stood, practicing his alphabet- the dear boy. I thought, ‘oh, how silly could I be’ when I heard another voice shout back.”
“Yea well, it’s strange. After I died and I was in heaven, I missed him, but I knew he was okay. He didn’t need me anymore and I was alright with it. But being back on earth now, being alive again, which by the way I still don’t get. I don’t know, it’s like that self-assured feeling, that inner peace or whatever, it’s like it’s slowly leaving me.”
“Dean, last I saw you I opened my heart to you in the most… bare and vulnerable way a person can…to a man I know could never reciprocate those feelings.”
From that heart-wrenching moment back in the bunker, Dean had not been able to get that eloquent declaration of love out of his head. No one had ever spoken with such deep devotion for him before. He honestly did not believe that anyone could love him like that. And then Castiel disappeared, seemingly forever, leaving Dean alone and lost. He never fully processed all that was said.
t started with a rumble and a growl from somewhere high above the clouds. Billowing white cumulus turned into dark nimbostratus clouds that hung low and angry. The rain followed a few days after and decided to prolong their visit.
Castiel was clearly over his jealousy from Dean’s earlier interaction with the librarian. After the third round of pink squirrels, Castiel, was subconsciously bouncing his leg along to the rhythm of the music, a pleased smile replacing his earlier frown, blue eyes crinkled in the corners. Dean could not help the warmth that spread through him.
“So, princes of hell, huh? Azazel, now Ramiel. Two down. Two to go. I’m guessin’ it’s probably too much to hope that they’re on a Disney prince level of bad.” Dean chuckled at his own joke.
Instead, Castiel tilts his head. He glances down at Jack, who grins up at him. "Yeah! Mr. Winchester helped me not strangle the pencil!"
, was the Gecko's name. Dean had given it to him on his first day at school. When Cas had still been so afraid, and Dean told his son there was no need to.
Cas rolls his eyes, steps over the broom, and kicks off the ground, launching himself into the air and around the stadium in a practice lap. Students cheer after him and Dean doesn’t lose his grin, not taking long to follow up after him, hovering above the students.
Michael doesn’t reply for a moment or two, as he’s too busy scanning his office; Sam had gained enough respect in the Ministry to have his own, private space - but as far as ministry offices go, it was still pretty… lacking. There are notices, post it notes, stuck all over the walls. He feels Michael linger at them with some puzzlement. Hey, magic didn’t need to do everything, after all.
Despite being ready, Castiel delays himself. He opens the door, still deciding what expression to wear, when he sees Dean in front of him.
As Dean wanders through, he has to force himself to not get distracted perusing through what’s in here. At random, he opens the box nearest to him, wiping off some of the dust. It's a collection of files, all letters, some legal shit, about some of the coroner's reports and insurance claims on the house... John never seems to have followed it through.
“Glad to see Jack is still good friends with Tony.” Dean notes, holding it at him. To his surprise, Cas chuckles as he joins him, placing two cups down in front of them.
It’s not someone he recognises, but that wasn’t always unusual. Sometimes parents got lost from other classes. Slapping his Best Teacher Smile on, Dean steps up to the tall, blonde haired male.
Dean looks away. "Yeah, well. We were sharing secrets at the time, slumber party style. Felt like a good time."
Castiel looks at Dean for a moment, who gives him a steady gaze of green eyes and unspoken reassurance. Cas nods before glancing back at Jack, adjusting him. “Say bye to Mr. Winchester, Jack.”
The wand goes flying out of Michael’s hand, losing itself among the grass. Bobby steps in view behind Michael, his own wand pointed at the Auror’s back.
Jody shakes her head. “That’s not the reason. He told me while he was flying that he’s sure he looked up and saw a Dementor. It freaked him out, he lost his balance with the broom, and that’s why he fell.”
Dean rolls onto his feet, (trying not to topple the chair on his way up,) and motions to get their attention. He sticks out a hand to the man as they approach.
"Sorry about the timing for this meeting, but it's urgent. Diagon Alley was under attack reportedly just an hour ago."
"Castiel, it's Eileen. I tried to get a hold of Dean, but he isn't answering his phone. It's Sam. There was --"
“You’re an Auror.” She states. Castiel nods, eyes flickering to the other child, the boy. He was holding tightly onto the girl’s hand. The younger, shy, child, he can only assume.
Dean looks down at Cas, one hand tangled in dark hair, another running fingers down a spine curved towards him. Calloused pads of fingers press against Dean’s jaw and Cas exhales, watching.
The spell never hits, and he opens his eyes (not realising that they were closed to begin with) and sees the outline of Castiel’s shoulders in front of him, and a haze of light in between them and Lucifer. It wasn’t light. It was
Dean’s grin draws quiet at that, glancing at Cas with a soft look in his eyes. “Yeah. Glad she was around when I was a kid."
“Well I didn’t, and I think the moment has passed on whether it would have been helpful or not, yeah—?” He looks up, suddenly staring across the pitch. “And speaking of the devil—”
I used to hold the rank of Captain in the U.S Navy. And I have a crime boss for a brother. I think I'll manage," Castiel remarks, steely. He stares at Dean.
Dean swallows the cheese cubes, hard. He winces as they struggle down his throat. “Dean,” He repeats. “You can just call me Dean. Told you that before."
Castiel sighs, puts down his book, places his hands on the table. “I’m sure you heard the rest of the statement Professor Singer said. There were to be no questions on this.”
“Yeah, that’s what I say about all the girls.” His attempt at a grin falls flat, and the Qudditch Master shrugs in resignation. He starts to stand, slowly.
He feels the tension in Castiel’s shoulder soften, and he looks up at Dean. With a small trickle of elation, he watches a smile bloom across Cas’ lips.
a height inferiority complex—immediately draws a gun on him, pointing it at Dean's head. He cocks it.
Castiel is still looking at the door, and for a moment Dean fears the worst. Then Cas sighs himself.
Castiel runs towards the Leaky Cauldron, wanting to ensure that the barrier had been put up if the wizards in there hadn’t been notified already. No one could get out.
Dean is quoting Macbeth at the end there. Specifically, Act 3, Scene 5: "He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
He wildly swings an arm out, grasping haggardly for the phone on his desk. He blinks blearily as he sees Bobby's disgruntled scowl on the front, the picture taken at one of the various birthday get togethers that Bobby was dragged to at The Roadhouse to celebrate with Ellen and some of the others.
The tips of Sams fingers play at the letter in his hands, delivered to the owlery this morning. Suspicion rose when he’d found the Hogwarts seal pressed in wax on the back; letters weren’t uncommon from Dean, but the seal had been a first.
Mr. Shurley just nods, glancing down at an approximate point on the carpet. His whole posture is almost rigid, though, and something uneasy settles in Dean that he can't quite place.
while he was surrounded by baby books, desperately researching on the best way to handle a child. He remembers how soft her hair felt when he'd tuck it behind her ears while she was vomiting, rubbing gently at her back.
"More than my face that's injured," He murmurs, adrenaline leaving his hands to shake. He falls quiet as he looks down at Cas' hand, firm on his wrist.
With a sigh, Castiel drums his fingertips along the top of the counter, before leaning down to push the wastepaper bin along the side of the back of the counter. He’d been kicking it accidentally all day.
Dean can feel the glare before he even opens the door, lingering on the other side of the small apartment that they call their home.
He’s halfway across the pitch when he finds himself coming to a halt. Hairs stand at the back of his neck, and he instinctively clutches at his wand, in hand, of where the end of it is currently lit up so he can see where he is going.
"We all got enough on our shoulders, it's what I'm trained to do. Practically taught my own little brother how to read and write too." Dean remarks, waving a hand at him in dismissal. Castiel looks a little uncomfortable.
Professor Novak merely wrinkles his nose in response, and pauses as they approach a bench in one of the long, extensive corridors, one that no student should be wandering down after classes end. He turns, and gently props Dean down on the bench, kneeling in front of him.
He feels Cas turn to look at him, but Cas had glanced away by the time he raises his head to meet him.
“He’s trying to reach Jack again.” Dean concludes, “and Jack will start remembering him at this age, too.”
“I’m sure your brother is more than capable.” Castiel states. He stares at Dean. “Aren’t you concerned for your own safety?”
"Congratulations," he says, with as much sincerity as he can give to a man he's just met. Sam acknowledges it with a nod.
they'd been talking about him. He wouldn't be surprised if they'd been coordinating emergency response from the kitchen in case it went
scream, thank you very much), flailing desperately for the last remnant of dignity he may or may not have.
Castiel turns around and leaves, without turning to look back at him. Dean still has the envelope clutched in his hand, unopened, when he disappears out of view.
Dean’s clapping goes to wild waving when he realises who else is part of the group — a wave back and Dean hops down to go greet his brother, clasping him on the shoulder. “Dude, why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
Dean lets out an involuntary snort, crossing his arms. “I ain’t distractin’ Cas of anything. Also, it ain’t Michael’s business what Cas gets up to anyway.”
"Unfortunately, one of our staff members were caught in the middle of the chaos. I've received news that Professor Novak is in a critical state, and has been taken into St. Mungos emergency care."
Dean’s too stunned to make a retort, exclamations bubbling against his mind; only siphoned through with the cool voice of Jody’s, edged with the same incredulity that Dean wanted to punch a wall with.
Castiel leans down, and ruffles his hair. “You will, but Aunt Anna really needs your help. Think you can do it?”
"We have reason to believe that the receipt of those invoices is linked to a murder inquiry, your Honor."
“There’s something I’ve been wondering. Actually, there’s a lot of things that have been nagging at me…” Dean started.
One thing Dean could say- Jaybird and the Squealers put on a good show. They played mostly covers, sticking with upbeat numbers even he could dance to. Some of the songs that he recognized (‘jailhouse Rock’, ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Sha’boom’) were mostly Elvis Presley renditions and that song from ‘Clue’.
“It is February, ma’am,” the second officer mumbled. The first officer cleared his throat and scolded his partner with a piercing stare. “Um, continue. Please.” At least he seemed ashamed of his own comment.
“On behalf of Jaybird and the Squealers, I would like to thank you for spending this night with us. And now, we’re going to end the night with a little something for the lovers out there.” Jaybird winked to the crowd. The mood of the music shifted from loud and bouncy to soft and smooth.
Castiel’s blue eye darted to Dean. “I haven’t actually found the occasion to.” A hand moved to rub the back of his head; cheeks flushed.
Now, all that baggage started to trickle back in. His old fears and doubts were slowly making their way back to the surface. He mentally shook his head to try to push them down and looked to his friend who he now realized was walking away from him.
“What? That’s not enough?” Dean was having a hard time keeping up. Too much at once. He really was back on earth.
Castiel found the grave marker for Arthur Munchin shockingly easy and they got to work digging up the coffin right away.
The rain pelted down like a Gatling gun with infinite ammo, the sound of it hitting against the windows echoed through the stuffy train car.
The fear and desperation in Claire’s voice was enough for Sam to force himself onto wobbly legs. Rain bullets bounced off the blade Claire had dropped during the scuffle. Sam slowly limped toward it, grabbed it by the hilt, and mustered all his residual strength for one last swing.
“The song that you were humming is “That’s the Way”,” Castiel said. “It is a beautiful song. I might go so far as to say it’s my favorite.”
Dean leaned over the front seat to unlatch the side door for the angel who quickly placed the bags in the backseat, then climbed into the passenger side.
The sky ripped open once more, lightning collided with the Bel-air, sending electric shockwaves through its chrome exterior. Inside, however, was empty.
Sam folded up the map. The two hunters got into the car, Sam behind the drivers’ wheel. He turned the key in the ignition, bringing Baby back to life. The engine’s sound of purr meets roar pervaded Sam’s ears. Sometimes, it was as if the car was weeping, missing its true owner. He gave the steering wheel a comforting pat.
They stopped a few passers-by for directions who seemed all too genial to help a uniformed officer in need. Why Castiel did not like this era was something that Dean questioned. Although, he figured, that probably had something to do with the fancy ‘costume’ he wore.
ean was cruising down the empty road- if you could call going 90 mph ‘cruising’. The classic rock tune of ‘Carry on My Wayward Son’ was blasting through Baby’s speakers which seemed somehow more amplified than Dean remembered.
A glint of light from the street lamppost shone onto a clothing department’s window display. “You got any more cash on you, Cas?”
“I’m sure he’s busy”, Dean said. Still, seeing Bobby, having Baby, and driving down an empty road with no real end in sight was a beautiful thing.
Jack had said he planned to be hands-off and Sam knew he meant it. Jack was in everything- from every grain of dirt to every single molecule in the air- and Sam believed it; felt it in his bones. Even though he was not there physically, Jack was there. It was comforting at the time.
Dean felt concerned and was about to vocalize said concern. But Castiel peeked at him over his raised glass of water, a smile tugged at his lips crinkling his eyes, and Dean forgot what he was about to say.
A crackle in the sky caught Dean’s attention. In front of him, the sky turned an angry shade of dark A lightning bolt crashed, splitting the sky in two. “This isn’t supposed to happen!” Dean risked a glance out the window at the brewing storm while quickly rolling up the glass.
The door creaked open, revealing a rumpled looking angel. He was dressed in borrowed sweats and a solid black t-shirt that Dean gave him. It was to replace his usual suit and tan coat until the angel got his mojo back up and running to magic the torn and dirtied outfit back to pristine conditions.
Castiel pulled some change out of his pocket and slid it over to Dean. There was a small jukebox flush against the wall on the table. “Why don’t you play something?”
“Of course,” he said out loud hoping someone was listening. “I’d be happier if I had an angelic sidekick to keep me company.” He turned his head to the right, towards the empty passenger seat, and sighed in disappointment. “It was worth a shot.” He stretched his right arm out against the seating as if the space beside him were occupied.
“Maybe he found Castiel,” Claire said hopeful. “Maybe they finally got over themselves and shacked up. Livin’ the domestic dream life in heaven.”
If Castiel understood Dean’s reference, he did not acknowledge it. “It’s a long story.” Castiel chuckled lightly. “I will tell you, but that story must wait. This anomaly has been leaving small traces of residue, or energy, in their wake. Almost as if it is bleeding. It’s how I was able to find you, Dean. We should get you out of here. This time-period is not…. overly pleasant.”
It was just a little square room with two windows on the left wall. Looking out, Dean saw white clouds across a white sky. Typical.
The music suddenly crackled like bad reception cutting in and out.  A moment of fluctuating static interference passed before it was replaced by white noise. Dean scrunched his forehead.  He played with the dials on the dash, to try to fix the signal. “Do I even need a signal in heaven?” he thought. “How the hell does that even work here?”
Sam lowered his hands and opened his eyes to the sight of Claire standing before him unblemished and otherwise healthy. But she was not alone. Standing right beside her, in all his glory was Jack, smiling and waving at Sam.
“You know,” he started thoughtfully, “at first I did. But lately, I don’t know… I just keep getting this… feeling. Something isn’t right.
The ghost’s look of rage turned to that of anguish. An unearthly scream bubbled up from the spirit as it burned along with its body until it was finally gone.
“Do you think Dean went to heaven?” Claire asked curiously. Sam knew that she didn’t mean any harm bringing the painful topic up. To be fair, Sam was also plagued by those sorts of questions- did Dean go to heaven? Is he revisiting his best memories? Or, since Jack is basically god now, maybe he let's Dean roam the entirety of paradise, visiting other people's heavens, like Bobby or their parents, or Charlie. These questions and dozens more ran laps in Sam's head, yet never coming around with any solid answers.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief for a job well done. The ghost of an unrestful spirit can rest once again. Castiel stepped towards his friend, sharing in the respite.
Dean cleared his throat. “Uh…Hey, Dead body burning. We should probably pack up before anyone decides to pick a fight.”
“Dean.” The song cut out to a low gravelly voice, only to go cut back to the song. Dean’s breath hitched.
Dean’s eyes lit up. “Thanks!” What to choose? Sifting through the choices, his smile slowly faded. “Right, the 50’s. It’s all doo-wop and jazz”.
“No,” Castiel said resolutely. “I wasn’t ready to face you because I didn’t know what to say. And, at the same time, I knew exactly what to say to you. I have thought of countless ways you would react and respond, Dean. I suppose, in the end, I just… got cold feet. But, Dean, I would never take back what I said. Because I have never meant anything more profoundly.”
“Sam!” Jody exclaimed. “Oh, look at you. Get in here!” She moved aside, holding the door open to let Sam pass through. He shook himself from the excess raindrops falling in his eyes.
“Don’t get me wrong. It is damn good to see you, man. But what the hell is going on? One minute, I’m driving down some no-name road, then a lightning storm hits me, and I wake up in the whitest hospital room I have ever seen.”
Dean saw a glint of guilt in the angel’s eyes. His anger subsided. For that moment. “My head’s pounding. You’re gonna have to give me a minute to get all this straight. So, time rift- what does that mean exactly? Are we in a ‘save the clocktower’ type situation? How
The hunter fell silent, lips slightly parted. He slowly picked it up. The corner of one side of his mouth turned up as he read the label:
Dean was lost in the sensation of heat and passion, skin against skin as the kiss became more demanding. A moan rumbled from one of the two. Dean was not quite sure which. He didn’t really care either. Kissing Castiel felt like he was back in heaven. Except this was better.
“Any updates on the anomaly? And are we really stickin’ with that name? I feel like we could do better.” Dean wondered aloud.
Okay, well, now Dean was getting extremely anxious for this “unspoken thing” to finally be spoken. “It’s cool, buddy. Er, Cas, whatever it is, you can tell me.” He gave Castiel his undivided attention.
Sed rose from the ground on shaky legs. He and assbutt #2 collected their other hapless compatriot and shuffled back through the cemetery gates.
A ‘scrunch’ sound.  The screeee noise lowered in volume until it stopped completely and disappeared. The light dimmed until all there was left was the dim light from the sun.
