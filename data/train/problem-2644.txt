“It’s no trouble.” Camael ushers. “Castiel has done so much for the angel kind. It is only appropriate we give both of you the respect you deserve.”
In the grand scheme of things, not much has changed. But, Castiel thinks he’s not the same anymore. He doesn’t know if it’s for the better or the worse—sometimes it’s simply
“Hello, there!” A man and a woman, both dressed in matching shades of teal that looked dark green under the harsh lights sprouted in front of them, grinning wide and blocking their path. “You boys from around here?”
"Okay, that's six whole hours," Sam noted to himself. "Thanks for the help, Nadia. I'll call you soon."
“Well, it would take me awhile to explain my origins. ‘You’ is a term humans used to refer to a corporeal form but I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent and cannot be pinpointed to a tangible form, but my vessel here helps me present myself among humans as a perceivable self.”
"I'm not doing jack," Dean barked. "You don't have your powers anymore, Cas. If something goes wrong—"
"Castiel," Tamoah urges him on, with a hand on his shoulder. "There is no point in dwelling on who we have lost."
“They’ve both got their issues,” he shook his head, dejected. “It’s honestly sad how they think they don’t deserve each other.”
"Sorry," Dean finds himself saying, snatching his eyes away from Castiel's steady gaze. "You don't gotta explain shit to me."
Zoe waves her hand and Dean loses his voice, air straining against the walls of his throat as he struggles to speak.
Sam snorted so hard he almost had a piece of pancake coming out of his nose. Dean looked not even a bit amused.
“I’m not sure.” Castiel hauls him to his feet, scanning for any visible injury. Castiel taps into his grace and uses the energy to null any aches on Dean’s body. The hunter shudders softly, his soul letting out a gentle flare. “Let’s go check.”
“Yes, thank you, Dean,” Cas reached out and squeezed his hand, and Dean had to hold on to every last nerve in his body to stop himself from chasing after the touch. He sighed, squeezing Cas’s knee one last time before swinging his legs off the side of the bed to stand up.
“If he stayed there any longer, he’d have been just like me.” Ruby continues, “I mean, he’s already full of misery, and has enough blood on his hands. Don’t need black eyes to be a demon.”
“Of course. Being friends with Dean is really boring, so I would love to be your friend,” Cas assures her, letting out a quiet yelp when an elbow connects to his stomach.
“There’s the whole Jamie and her husband thing,” Dean said. “Same neighborhood, same motive but different cause of death.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, something he had caught himself doing a lot lately, and pressed one palm to Dean's shoulder and the other to Sam's arm before flying them to the car. Sam landed in the driver's seat and Castiel and Dean in the backseat, crumpled against the left side door.
“Touche.” Dean leans back against their weirdly soft bed, laying his head on one of the metric fuckton of pillows. He couldn’t help feeling like things were finally starting to look up.
“Yeah, because that’s how you deal with stuff.” Sam calls behind him as he makes his way to the kitchen.
“You’re staying back, Dean.” Sam says, firmly. “I literally just got you back and I’m not sending you out there again. Give yourself some time, man. Take a vacation or something, please.” The tone of desperation in Sam's voice seems to be getting to Dean. “You need some time to pick yourself up.”
"You wanna fuck me against the wall, Cas?" Dean murmured, dropping his voice low, rolling his hips forward. "I might moan but you could shut me up-"
He senses the righteous man’s soul from miles away, the bright gleam of it spreading warmth through him as he pinpoints its location in Sioux Falls. Castiel flies, chasing the warmth and positions himself in the middle of a large ground covered with vehicles.
Castiel was sitting on the couch, his legs in a crisscross applesauce, hands wrapped around a pink mug.
"Sorry," Castiel tried to access his grace to provide some comfort to Dean, but even when his essence was clawing at him to reach out to Dean, it was not enough.
Dean pushes past him, turning around to face Cas as he walks backwards, "We discussed our cover story!"
Dean grinned, tapping his fingers softly on Cas’ knee. “I’m starting to think you need me only for my cooking skills.”
Dean chuckles, reaching out to grab Cas’s hand that he forgot is still resting on Dean’s knee, “Well, what says ball and chain better than shared mortgage?”
"Is there something you wanna share with the class?" Nadia raised a brow. "I just watched someone get shot and run away like it was nothing."
Castiel turns bright red at that, blue eyes widening a little. Duck chuckles, smacking his ass and walking away, filing that little information away for later.
"You want Dean and Cas to pretend to be a couple about to buy a house," Sam repeated, just for himself to hear. "Fine, I'll talk to them, but what do you want them to do?"
Castiel shook his head, "It's the middle of the night, Dean, and the weather is terrible." He said. "You don't have to worry your brother. The guest room is already made, you can stay here for the night."
"Enough, I believe," Cas says. "Though, humanity has changed tremendously since the last time angels walked the Earth."
Castiel caught a glimpse of Sam smiling at them through the mirror, amusement and surprise dancing in his eyes. He wasn't blind to the similarities. Where Achilles wanted revenge, Castiel was trying to protect Dean from the reach of all the angels wanting him to burn away for the sake of an age old prophecy. Where Achilles was led to self destruction, Castiel was burning a piece of himself, and the weakened grace within him was always a reminder.
"We can work with that," Sam walked back in. "The exit is this way. We're in some building abandoned halfway through construction."
“There’s no way she can spy on us while we’re here,” Dean muttered, seemingly disturbed by the thought.
Dean’s sad excuse of a brain manages to scratch two brain cells together and remind him that he should look away, because Cas could turn any second and see Dean sprouting rose petals out of his eyes or whatever.
The details only get more gruesome and unsettling as he reads on, which to Castiel means a case. A monster to kill. Few lives to save, if he’s lucky. The crime scene is only a few miles away from his motel, but not close enough to walk, and Castiel groans at the thought of getting his abomination of a car to start. It used to work well, but Cas has never been the one to maintain it in good condition, simply because he doesn't know what a car maintenance entails. Warm laughs and amused green eyes flicker past his thoughts and Castiel quickly shuts them away. He is truly tired of every little thing reminding him of the pieces he had to leave behind.
Now thinking about it, Castiel feels stupid for not realizing how plainly obvious where Sam might be. Keeping Sam Winchester hostage wouldn’t prove convenient to Raphael or Zachariah. So, it would be much easier to keep Sam locked up in one of the personal heavens specifically fabricated for him, perhaps in a set of artificial memories that might make Sam think he’s back at home on Earth rather than in heaven.
"Perhaps I could," Cas says, a soft smiling accompanying the words. "I see how easy it is to fall in love with life when you are a human.
"And secondly,” Cas continues, “If I had known that the angels were working against everything I believed was right, I would have given up on them a while ago. You don't need to take blame for my choices, Dean. I can't let you do that."
I will be back with something new very soon. Until then, leave a line or two in the comments about what you thought and check out my other works.
Castiel nods, never having felt more unsure in his life as he lets his feet carry him to Dean's room.
“Far from it,” Cas replies without missing a beat, and it’s nice to hear Dean laugh at his poor attempt at a joke. He’s aware there is no point in arguing with Dean over the subject of who owes an apology to whom, so he tries a different distraction tactic. “I have never changed the oil of this car,” he says.
"It doesn't matter if you get the job or not," he tells Ivan. "I'm congratulating you for clearing your interview well."
, Dean couldn’t get enough. He couldn’t genuinely decide if this felt like a dream or his biggest nightmare. He always prided himself for the tight grip he had on his emotions—being able to keep his hands and mind to himself no matter how much his heart clawed against his chest. But now it was all melting away quicker than he could say take back the reins.
“If that’s how I did things, I’d be six feet under by the time I was twelve.” Dean says, “Tell me who you are and how you got in, or would you like a bullet to the chest?”
“I don’t know who that is, but I despise myself for it,” Castiel says, too late to stop the words from spilling out of him. “I’m no hero, Dean. Everything I ever wanted was to let the angels live following their will and yet here I am, giving out orders.”
“Dean.” Sam Winchester’s voice says, tone full of disgust, “Don’t chew and talk. Were you raised in a barn?”
They pull up next to a small house off the main road, with an empty dog house. It takes several knocks for the resident to open the door and Dean utilizes the time to ceremonially fix Cas’ tie. It's easier to pretend they’re fine when he doesn’t have to look Cas in the eye.
Those words are his to bury deep inside his heart and cherish, and they're his to echo in his ears during cold nights where his blood is drowning in alcohol and everything around him is numb.
"Yes, Commander," Camael gathers the weapons and heads outside, the rest of the angels following him.
Now Castiel knew that was a lie. He had seen the same man drink a whole bottle of whiskey and still stand upright on his legs. Castiel wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist, using the grip to pull his hands away from his shoulder. Dean’s eyes widened and before the edge of panic could creep into them, Cas stepped closer, cupping Dean’s face in his palms.
"No, he's actually an angel," Dean leans forward, catching Sam's attention. "Remember the stories mom used to tell us about grandpa Samuel meeting one."
Castiel wakes up to the undesirably loud banging on his motel door for a change. He peers at his phone through once cracked eye and sees it’s only ten minutes past four, which explains the darkness outside, but does not explain why someone is waking him up this early.
Dean was in a great mood altogether, from not having dropped the ball on his presentation and just being around Cas in general.
Something flickers behind Dean’s eyes, something conflicting and profound. A slides hand around the back of Castiel’s neck, pulling him forward.
The house is similar to others in the neighbourhood—generously furnished and neat. Castiel likes the abundance of houseplants that line the corners of the living room, lush and green leaves reflecting sunlight from the window. He hears Dean mutter something about the wallpaper and quietly nudges him to remain quiet, to no avail. They sit side by side on the couch as Linda sits on the loveseat opposite to them.
“No. All I heard was that it was messy,” she replies uneasily. “Now, where’s my manners! I should get you both something to drink.”
Dean has been cataloging it since the moment he saw Cas again, the habits of his that have changed and the ones that are still the same. The new habits are a lot more in number than the old ones, and while it’s good to see this version of Cas, Dean silently wishes he could’ve been there for Cas when he was learning to adjust with humanity. Dean wanted to be the one to have taught him how to use a toaster or how to iron his shirts, but it’s the price he has to pay for turning Cas away. He’s lucky that Cas at least talks to him, all things considered, but when Cas adds a shit ton of sugar into his coffee or crosses his arms when he’s pissed, Dean can’t help the little spark of happiness that bounces around in his chest. He’s a selfish bastard like that.
"Dean," he called softly, pressing a hand to the hunter's chest, a sigh of relief pushing past his lips as he felt Dean's heart beating under his hand. "Dean, can you hear me?"
“This might come out as a little weird.” Castiel said, abruptly, “Do you believe in soulmates, Dean?”
wrapped around him and his legs clad in pajama bottoms with pineapples printed on them. Castiel revels in the beauty of his soul for a moment; the light in him swirls around like a whirlpool of conflicting emotions, though Castiel doesn't have to watch his soul to figure that out when he can see them in Dean's jade green eyes. There is fear, disbelief and confusion there, but the most prominent one he sees is immense relief. That itself is enough to leave Castiel weak.
"Come on, Cas, I'm not some man whore," Dean grumbled. "I wasn't feeling it, okay? 'Sides, I'm over that kind of thing..." he waved his hand in a vague gesture, "meaningless hookups and shit"
Perhaps, it is time for him to introduce himself to Dean. In the previous briefing, Zachariah made it clear that Lilith was not far behind in breaking the next seal and Dean’s choices are going to matter. Waiting until Dean comes back from the hunting trip is not advisable.
“Yeah, the last thing we need is a group of grouchy all powerful gods,” Dean sighed exasperatedly. “It’s only been a day since the last death at the party hall, she must be running on full tank right now. She won’t hunt soon so if we’re gonna get her, no other time like the present.”
"There you are." Nemiah calls, grinning. Castiel rolls his eyes, even as he smiles at her. Nemiah has always been one of the rebellious ones and probably the only angel who has spent more time on earth than Castiel. They both disbanded from their crowd for the same reason, but Nemiah was willing to cut ties completely for the one she loved. At one time, Castiel never really understood the motivation behind the decision, but now he knows. "Apparently, Raphael just nuked us."
“Dean, you will have to come out of there at some point,” Castiel called, rubbing the back of his hand to his tired eyed. Exhaustion was one of the most unsettling parts of being a human.
Dean ran a hand through his damp hair, pulling off his wet clothes and chucking them into the empty laundry basket, only leaving his relatively dry underwear on. He pulled on Castiel's sky blue sweatshirt and black track pants, glancing at the mirror one last time before heading out.
“Relax, Agent,” she snorted, rolling her eyes. “I’ve been blowing my own brains out since morning and coffee’s my only source of motivation now.”
Their dad was an absolute bastard, Castiel could say that confidently. He charmed, and sometimes paid his way upto the top of Novak Constructions, shoving away anything that stood in his way. The man’s moral compass was a roulette wheel and Castiel feared he was falling down the same path of corporate whirlpool. The meeting went on for another twenty minutes and Michael talked about project reports and legal implications.
"There's these bunch of shops down the road, sells the weirdest shit you'll ever see, you're gonna love it. It's all good stuff, and supports the local business so why not," Dean says.
“Dean is right.” Sam scowls at him, but Castiel presses on, “We know nothing about Lilith’s plans, and she could be anywhere. Besides, my orders are to help you prevent the breaking of seals, not finding Lilith.”
Dean runs a hand through his hair, eyes falling shut as a soft breath bubbles past his lips. He could see the picture painted behind his eyelids; white picket fence, two and a half kids and a dog, the perfect family. The warmth seeps into his heart, growing, growing and swiveling akin to a soft summer breeze. He's holding a hand, a familiar warm hand. Somehow Dean knows the hand belongs to Castiel. For once he wishes it would hurt, just to remind himself how out of his reach his dream was.
Irene ducked her head, tucking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear, “I would’ve gone off about how great this neighborhood is if you two weren’t investigating two deaths that happened here.”
"Castiel!" Tamoah jogs over to them, "The building seems to be lacking any movement inside. If you wish to go and search yourself, it can be arranged."
"Mainly because you two only talk to each other," Sam provides helpfully. "Still don't know if I buy his story, but, if he's been an angel all this time and suddenly he's gotta eat, sleep and walk, that might throw a guy off."
Nevertheless, he flies into the bunker, hearing a startled shout and the scrap of a chair against the metal floor in welcome. There is a gun pointed in his direction, but the wielder of the weapon is the younger Winchester.
“The slow destruction of the heart looks almost deliberate,” Cas notes, almost to himself. “Like someone wanted him to go through-”
It hurt him to realize how much those words meant to him, and how much he wished to hear them, just from seeing the momentary glaze of tears in Dean's eyes before he blinked them away behind a grin. "You're weird," he mumbled, lips twitching.
Really sorry for the messed up update schedule. I'll try to update every two days from now on. Hope you enjoy!
“I mean, if something killed him then I sure as hell would be able to figure it out,” she huffs. “And I’m pretty whatever the guy’s body did, it’s not natural.”
Camael puts his hand on Dean's shoulder and he slips his eyes shut involuntarily. When he opens his eyes, he's standing in the same forest in Finland, now in broad daylight.
“Look Rowena, if this is some trap you’re sending us to, you better know once we’re out of there, and we
“No, don’t worry,” Sam says, and to think this is the guy Dean sold his soul for. “Listen, did you talk to him yet?”
Seconds stretched into seasons as they kissed and kissed and kissed like the world was ending; and it was.
"Sammy, what the hell–" Dean's voice dies out, and Castiel raises his eyes, the rest of the world turning into a wall of white noise at the sight of his hunter.
"Alright, John Keats," Dean laughed softly, coming to sit down next to him on the floor, their shoulders pressed close. "You're gonna end up hating it if you catch pneumonia."
"I don't see nothing but good in you," Cas sighs. "Perhaps it's not my image of you that you should be worrying about."
The small smile that graces Dean’s lips falls away, replaced by a weary sadness that Castiel never wishes to see on his features. It’s quite odd, being the one in the driver’s seat while Dean sits next to him, and Dean too looks suddenly out of place.
Of course he saw it. It was not like his eyes weren’t glued to Cas at all times. He never failed to notice how often Cas smiled, and how he pressed a hand on Dean’s shoulder whenever they crossed paths or how he would stand a little closer than necessary even with the complete knowledge of what personal space is. Those little moments were everything to him.
Dean knocks on the door, preparing himself for the onslaught of holy water, salt and silver and whatever other monster repellent Bobby has been cooking in his basement.
When he looked back up, his entire family, including his dad was staring at him with different levels of amusement on their faces.
The figure grows closer to him and he wants to run face first into its warmth. Alastair is nowhere in sight, neither are his demons. Dean’s knees give out and he crumbles to the floor, unable to move or breathe or blink. The warm light gets closer by the minute. It swirls and spins, slashing and dodging whips and chains in its path, bright light and dark wings twisting together like a hurricane. Dean reaches out, knowing he would disintegrate right then if he doesn’t get closer to it. Whatever it is, it might have sensed him because it’s vigor increases, slicing its way towards Dean.
Human relations are a mystery to Castiel. They live among thousands of their kind but a certain someone is chosen by them to stay by their side for the rest of their lives. They procreate with this partner and build a life, not being bothered by the insignificance of their minuscule lives in the vast frame of things. It’s intriguing how humans tend to care for one another in different ways. A stranger doesn’t care for another the way he cares for his own.
"Cas?" Dean's voice cracks at the single syllable, and Castiel wants nothing more than to close the distance between them and hold the man in his arms.
Dean's body shook with laughter, "Bump, sweetheart." No matter how many times it had been, Castiel's chest still tightened pleasantly at the term of endearment. "Well, we better find something 'cause so far we’ve got goose egg,'' Dean mumbled into his shoulder.
“What you did to protect your brother does not define you,” he replied simply, rolling up on his elbows to look at him. “Come here, Dean.” he murmured.
Dean shakes his head, “I don’t think that would do anyone any good. Besides, we gotta get Sammy out.”
"The cost of a thing," Sam nodded in understanding. "How does that even correlate to whatever the hell is going on?"
“Shut your damn mouth,” Dean cut his brother off, glancing in the direction of the bathroom door. “I’m a professional. It’s just a milk run,” he said quietly.
"He loved the guy a lot, I guess," Dean said, forehead crinkled in a thoughtful expression. "It's pro’bly why he was stupid to do that. Love's always stupid."
"Is that what you would have done if one of us were in your place?" Cas asks, eyes fixed somewhere on the wall past Dean's shoulder.
“It was not so much of an escape, Castiel,” he recalls. “Had you not showed up, I would have joined the same fate as others.”
“Oh, I know ways to get him to be loud,” Dean waggled his eyebrows at Claudia and Henry, letting go of Cas’s hand to wrap it around his waist.
The silence is too much. Dean never thought he'd be famous enough for some ethereal being to be his pen pal. The coal mining in his skull eventually fades out so he keeps walking. What feels like a week later, Dean sees the familiar 'Singer's Salvage' sign. A ragged breath escapes his lungs.
“Actually,” Meg stopped him with a hand around his wrist, “I have someone you can chat up with. He’s over there,” She pointed to her far left where a dark haired man sat on the arm of the couch, sipping something from a cup, a five o’clock shadow lining his jaw. “That’s Castiel. I dragged him along because he hates parties and I like watching him suffer.”
"A huge improvement from tasting molecules," Cas replied, only after he finished swallowing. That wasn't going to last much longer with the table manners he was going to pick up from Dean.
joke with. It’d hit too close to home) in his hand and the man standing next to him. Cas’s scruff has grown a little darker and his brows were scrunched up in a frown like a pissed off (and very adorable) cat. Dean knew he was being such a chick but they were alone, and Cas would never have him the way Dean wanted him to, so he could indulge for a minute just to keep him from spiraling with the intensity of everything he was feeling.
Dean dips down, licking a strip along his cock, making Castiel's hips stutter. Dean's hands pin his hips down, biting and licking at the skin on the underside of his thigh. Castiel keens under the touch, carding his hands through Dean's hair. Dean moans headily into his skin, the vibrations travelling all the way to his nerves.
Cas turned around in his arms, catching his lips in a sweet kiss, "You look amazing, Dean." He said, "Almost edible, in fact.”
“You had a panic attack,” Cas answered like it was the simplest question in the world. “Do you need more water?”
Castiel didn’t say anything and held onto Dean like a beacon of warmth. He didn’t know why, but, with Dean, everything felt right.
The two victims lie there, very much pale and dead. They were nothing out of the ordinary, suburban golf dads maybe, and with a shudder Dean remembered he used to be one of them back when he lived with Lisa and Ben.
"All right now, don't gang upon us," Dean muttered, smiling despite it all. He reached out and pulled Sam to his feet. "What happened?"
Castiel doesn’t take long enough to decipher what Dean is hinting at. He leaps to his feet, wincing when his wounds protest. In a swift motion, Dean is right by his side, an arm curled around his waist.
Castiel closes his eyes, letting out a deep exhale, "So be it." He turns to Camael. "Brother, I need you to lead our best team to rally a raid to the remaining crypt and retrieve the weapons."
"It is, in all it's sense, overwhelmingly huge." Castiel sighed. "I don't even know if I'm ready for such a responsibility."
"Not too long. I did not intend to wake you up, Dean." Castiel says, preparing himself to leave if Dean asks him to.
"'M alright," he lied, a part of him wishing Cas would buy it and the other part desperately hoping Cas would stay.
"Everything seems to be in place." Camael declares, turning to him. "I'm going to guide you out if this-"
“You can try,” Zachariah laughs, “They are just pawns, Castiel. A little nudge here and a little push there — that’s all it takes.”
"Before you met me did you believe in angels?" Cas asks, the abrupt change of subject giving Dean whiplash, even when it's not the first time this has happened.
"I think I get it," Dean nodded sagely. "You gotta push through no matter what or it'll all come crashin' down on you."
Dean strips off his shirt and pants, pulling his robe on, all while keeping his back to Cas. He’s so goddamn exhausted and the warm press of Cas’s body against his—the way Cas’s hands held his face in them—is fresh in his head. Dean feels weak with the need to wrap himself around Cas, just for a minute. He sighs, leaning a pillow against the headboard and falling back until his head hits the wood. He closes his eyes and pats the bed next to him.
Cas sighed, shaking his head, “When you were a demon, you said the same words to Sam. You asked him to leave you alone but that’s not what he did,” he said. “You can’t keep making our choices for us, Dean.”
Barely five minutes of reckless driving later, they are bursting in through Cindy's front door, guns in hand. A plate misses Dean's face by nearly inches and clatters against the wall.
"Whatever." Dean got up, squeezing between the seat and Castiel's legs to get outside. Castiel moved inside and Dean claimed the seat next to him. Castiel fidgeted with his seat belt clip, trying not to be obvious as he glanced at Dean.
He has an idea regarding Dean’s intentions here. Dean’s apparent need to explain himself to Castiel seems to be nothing more than the beginning of a goodbye. Everything that had been left unsaid between them are the final strings that hold them together. Once those are cut out, Dean can be on his way without any grievances holding him back. Perhaps, it is good for Cas too. If they ever cross paths again after this case, they could pretend to be two hunters working together, and not Dean and Castiel, who were once good friends.
“Hell yeah.” Sam exclaimed. “I saw the way he looked at you, Dean. If any of my friends looked at me like you guys look at each other, we both would have some things to hash out.”
"If you're questioning the legitimacy of my claim, I'm afraid to let you know that I have no means of proving it to you," Castiel snaps.
“You’re safe, Dean,” Cas murmured, suddenly standing next to him at the sink. He felt a hand on the nape of his neck, a thumb rubbing soothingly at the skin. “I will always keep you safe.”
"Apparently Eileen's been having contractions since late at night but she thought it was the baby kicking or something," Sam says, handing him a cup of coffee.
Dean shakes his head, a mirthless laugh spilling out of his chest, "I'm a wreck without you, Cas. Every time I lose you my life goes to shit," he says, blinking away the tears. "You tell me the things I've been wanting to hear from you ever since we met, and then you fucking die on me even before I can wrap my head around it."
"Yeah, but I can fix it." Dean said. "I've been fixing her since the day I could hold a wrench. She was my dad's before I got her."
A HUGE HUGE thank you to everyone who stuck through the ride and left kudos and comments. I'm so thankful for y'all. I hope you all enjoyed this! Let me know your feedback in the comments!
Cas huffs a tiny laugh and dives forward to kiss him but stops in his tracks, a thin line forming between his brows. Dean opens his mouth to ask Cas if he’s okay but right then, the ground shakes beneath them so vigorously, tipping Dean’s balance. Cas grabs his hand, fingers iron grip around his wrist.
Dean finds his footing on some soft grass, hearing crickets chirping before he opens his eyes. It’s cold, dark and the woods around them obstruct any moon light. Though when he looks up, the sky is painted with stars. Ahead of them, the forest ground has cleared to make something like small a crop circle, the ground underneath the surface shimmering white.
“Guy had a secretary, one Zoe Duncan.” Dean says, “Last person to see him before he, you know. Who’s on the call?”
"Sammy, stop," he cuts him off, not having it in himself to think about anything other than Eileen and the baby making it out healthy. "She and the baby are gonna be fine, don't work yourself up before you even know what's going on. I'll get tickets for the next flight, just hang in there until then."
"He’s fine, just a minor injury to his shoulder. He will be back in a few days." Cas replied. "The workload might increase for some of you until then, especially Dean."
"Cindy, your daughter hasn't found peace yet." Dean grabs the bottle of salt strewn on the floor. "She's a vengeful spirit. You need to tell me if you are holding any of her possessions with you."
"Do you think whoever is doing this will be at the event?" Cas asked, picking at the buttons on his shirt.
Dean peered at the flap of tissue Cas was holding back. A weird shape was etched onto the flesh, like two tangled fish hooks pulling against each other with a circle in the middle. “Huh, never seen that before…”
"It ain't rocket science or anything,"Dean shrugs. "You look at the people in your life and realize some among them makes you feel like you're home right where you belong, and that's pretty much all it takes to love them."
Dean leans against the door frame, rocking back and forth on his heel, the tray in his hand pouring sweet aroma into the room. It takes only a couple of seconds for Cas to stick his head up from under the blanket, eyes still close and nose crunched as he sniffs the air like a cat.
Sure enough, Naomi was glaring intently at Gabriel as he ate her ear off. Cas shot him a helpless look and Dean tried his best not to laugh. Naomi and her staff left eventually, the rest of the office sighing heavily.
After what felt like not long enough, they pulled apart, since out of the two of them, Dean needed to breathe. He leaned his forehead against Cas’s, putting the rest of the world on the back burner for a moment.
There were way too many emotions swimming behind Dean’s words, and Castiel knew how the man saw himself and no answer would douse the feeling of unworthiness burning him to ashes. Still, none of it mattered because that was the promise Cas had made to him—that he would stay no matter what. He turned his head to the side to see Dean turned away from him, curled into himself on his side. Even without his grace Castiel could feel the guilt and misery rolling off Dean like waves. It took everything in him to not go over and just hold Dean for a moment and help him shoulder some of the weight he so adamantly decided to carry on his own.
“Kind of a douchebag move if you ask me,” the younger man from the pool table says, holding Castiel’s eyes in the mirror. “But I gotta give it to you for your commitment to the act.”
Castiel knocked on Dean's door twice, getting no reply. He turned the knob, slipping into the room and shutting the door behind him.
Less than ten minutes later, Castiel is pocketing four hundred dollars while an angry six foot three man looks like he would like nothing more than to beat Cas up.
Castiel sucked in a sharp breath, meeting Dean's gaze over her shoulder, who stared back at him, eyes full of confusion and doubt. "More than anything," Castiel replied, with as much reverence as he could conjure.
Sam frowned, pulling out his cellphone and turning the flashlight on, "Dean, buddy. Open your eyes."
Dean tightened the grip on his mug, drawing warmth from it. "Yeah, we should." He took another sip, and damn, it felt really good. "Starting simple, I don't think we can date."
"Got that from a hallmark card?" Dean scoffed, ruining the moment. Sam sighed and Cas simply rolled his eyes, flopping back on the bed.
"About that," Zachariah slides off his chair, "We have stopped the search. Tracking her down is serious work and if we keep doing that, the seals will keep on breaking." He waves his hand in dismissal, "That will be all."
"Music feels different," Cas replied. "I used to hear the sound before...but now I can feel the rhythm and vibrations in my bones."
Castiel stiffens, his hands reaching up to his temple. He whines softly, clutching his head and staggering on his legs. Dean doesn't hesitate this time, reaching out to study him with a hand on his shoulder.
"You don't love me, Cas." Dean swallows the lump in his throat, something in his chest snapping like a dry twig. "You deserve better than me."
Dean couldn't help but smile at that, wanting nothing more than to crawl back into bed with Cas and go to sleep. But he had two days left to leave and his clothes hadn't even made it out of his closet. He got off the floor, the cool air in the room slamming against his bare skin. Cas looked so adorable when he slept, lips slightly parted and body buried under a mountain of blankets. Dean was always the one to sleep with one pillow and a blanket, for which Cas called him a psychopath and said they'd sleep in his room all the time. The clock on the nightstand said twenty minutes to seven and Dean figured they had some time to spare. He peeled the covers back and climbed under them, instantly having an armful of Cas. Dean pressed a kiss to the top of Cas' head, inhaling the familiar scent of vanilla that seemed to follow Cas everywhere and had become a part of Dean's life too, so much so that he sometimes felt it on himself. Everything about the man had become a part of Dean's life, always giving him a hand when he needs one. He would hate to lose it.
As frustrating as it was, sometimes Dean couldn't help but think that Cas's clipped and concise answers were a blessing. It was a minuscule pause—a moment where he could rest his eyes—before the inevitable kamikaze mission of tying up the loose ends came up.
above me," Dean says, his voice sounding several pitches high to his own ears. "I'm just a guy, you're—"
Castiel spent the rest of his first day at work signing documents and reviewing budget reports for the newly acclaimed tender and local construction projects. It wasn’t tedious, as he grew up around all of this, hearing and learning from what his father and Michael spent their lives building. Once in a while he would catch sight of Dean, running back and forth between his desk and the printer, or getting a snack from the break room. He wished circumstances were different; an alternate scenario where they could be just more than friends or coworkers. But reality was a fickle bitch.
“Maybe he’s more like you than you’d think,” Sam said, and continued before Dean could ask what he meant. “I’m tired, you wanna keep watching?”
“No one knows the extent of harm that knife can inflict upon Lilith.” Castiel says, “It’s not worth taking a chance.”
The fact that he’s driving to the morgue bizarrely does not dwindle his mood, nothing but the sound of a familiar voice pouring in through the stereo. Taylor Swift, he thinks. The lobby of the coroner’s office is empty except for the man sitting behind the reception. Cas pulls out his badge, making sure it is open the right way, before placing it on the table and tapping a finger against the plastic.
The first sigh of relief comes as he touches the man's arm, the skin cold but not frozen under his touch. He mustn't have been here long. A deeper sigh of relief floods through Dean as he sticks a finger under the guy's nose, warm air hitting his skin.
Cas is leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed in front of his chest, and the last time he’s seen Cas
He can hear the wheel turning in Sam's Stanford polished brain. Finally he indulges Dean, "This one case is driving me up the walls."
"You're not 'people', Dean." Cas looked up at him, "You're my escape from said 'people' and the rest of the world."
"It's not that dramatic," Cas rolls his eyes, another habit he may have picked up from Dean. The way his whole body moves with the action is so goddamn endearing. "It's the reason why I am restless. We managed to close three of the gates before my…"
"You let me die." Jenna sneers. "I only wanted someone to look out for me, but you… you and dad were busy fighting. You did this to me."
Cas goes around to sit back on his chair and continue his research, but Dean’s heart is dead set on leaping out of his chest. It’s not helping that Cas is dressed in a leather jacket and ripped jeans, after years of hiding himself away in the stupid trenchcoat. He’s got that squinty expression, the one he gets when he’s on hyperfocus, and Dean can’t help but smile at these little things about Cas that haven't changed in the past three years.
“I don’t know, Dean, but consider this,” Sam muses, “Maybe, I mean, this is just a suggestion, but, just maybe,” Dean’s already halfway through rolling his eyes, “you’re a good guy and deserve to live longer?”
"Is this who you're sending us to our deaths for?" Elijah barks, and Castiel is sure the angel has made his way on Dean's
"You can shout at me all you want, Dean,” Cas said quietly. “I’ll understand if you want me to leave.”
Dean splashes a handful of water on to his face, watching it grip down in the dirty mirror. He never looked in the mirror while he was a demon, terrified of what might look back at him. His eyes might be green now, but his heart still feels dark like ink, blood tainted with the lives lost by his own hand. Back then it didn’t feel anything. His mind was hollow and the lines between right and wrong were all blurry. As things got clearer, the walls came crashing down, suffocating him.
"Because the only way to survive in this world is by having faith even when you're not sure about certain things." Cas replied, simply.
"Fuck." He dropped to the floor, rubbing his foot. Dean was by his side with a few steps, kneeling down next to him.
“Just not here.” Dean said, “It’s a total douche move to pull at someone’s wedding, let alone your brother’s.”
Dean rubbed his upper arm where Cas just punched him. Cas just smiled at him innocently. They exchanged numbers silently, the typing of keys echoing in the car.
A good part of his worries faded away as Dean cupped his face and kissed him full on the mouth, one hand working with the button on his pants.
"You don't understand," Castiel scrambles to his feet, swaying unsteadily. "I don't have my grace anymore. I'm human."
“I have, let’s say, a source.” Castiel watches Sam visibly shrink into himself under Dean’s scrutiny. “Ruby gave me the intel.”
“What the-” Dean turns to him with wide eyes, only to snap his mouth shut. “Nice try, asshole. I’m not gonna fall for the bait. No comments about your car whatsoever.”
Fuck. Right. Dean didn't mean for it to come out the way it did, but guess he dropped the ball on that one too many times. Dean just—he likes his routines. His palm curled around the hilt of a knife—not to kill, but to make sure his family is well fed. It's the kind of thing that safeguards his remaining bit of sanity.
“Yeah, but witches turn the whole schmuck unnecessarily gross and complicated,” he scrunched his nose. “Anyways when are we getting these details?”
He couldn’t help but watch Cas walk down the hallway and feel all gooey and sappy, it was honestly stupid. It’s just Cas, former angel of the Lord. Dean’s only best friend other than Sam who has gone cut and bleeding to the ends of the Earth for him. Except this time Cas was here to stay. When he turned back to the screen, Sam was watching him, a sly grin on his stupid face.
“Deny all you want, Dean. You and I both know it. This is what you are.” A crash echoes from the distance. Alastair looks over his shoulder, the wicked grin on his face fading for a moment. “Hurry Dean, you still got a lot to learn.”
With every passing second Dean felt his heart thud harder against his chest. He kept his eyes ahead as Sam went in depth about the different signs of people who were in love, and Dean knew his brother well enough to know what he was trying to do.
“I promised you I would do the right thing, Dean.” The heaviness in those words makes something snap like a dry twig in his chest.
"Eileen's in the hospital...it's probably nothing but I can't help but worry," he mumbles, turning to rest his head on Cas' shoulder. Strong arms wrap around his middle, holding him closer against the sturdy warmth of Castiel's chest. "Sammy might be losing his mind, can't blame him."
The words feel so wrong in his tongue, Dean needs another drink to swallow it down. The familiar sense of
“Remind me to buy Ivan something nice,” Cas comments, lowering his gun. He holds out his hand and Jaime places the hilt of the machete into his palm with a scoff.
Cas leveled him with a look but he must see something in his face and his gaze softened, “Dean, I rebelled against heaven and chose humanity for you and I don’t regret any of those decisions. Why would I regret kissing you?”
“Awh, don’t be like that, Cas,” she punches him on the shoulder, but doesn’t say anything else as she climbs into the car.
Dean grinned so wide his cheeks hurt when Cas laughed at that. "I thought we were refraining from reusing lines."
Sam whipped his head up, the surprise in his features fading away only to be replaced by confusion, "Cas, you, um, you said you loved him," he said, gesturing to Dean. "Did he know?"
He picks up his phone and calls Sam, knowing it won't be much long before the two bars of reception fades away.
He blinks up at the ceiling and then dedicates some attention to the bare walls of Sam's guest room too until the neon green digits on the table clock blinks to six. He pads out of his room and heads for the kitchen, finally having something to do with his hands and his mind. He's almost positive about not finding anything other than granola and kale but thanks to Eileen, there's bacon. Jo's passed out on the couch with one leg hanging off it, and Dean grabs his phone to shoot a text to Ellen to let her know her daughter is safe and probably dreaming about throwing axes or hammering a wall down which is obvious from the concentrated scowl on her face.
“Thanks for all the trouble, Cam.” Dean gets off the rock and dusts his jeans, offering a hand to Cas.
"What about Rowena?" Sam interjected, feeling like he should contribute something to the conversation. The sour look Dean sent his way prompted him to add, "I mean, no rush. It's not like she's gonna get up to trouble when she knows we're tailing her."
“No, Dean, you don’t understand,” Cas crossed his arms across his chest. “I was an angel for billions of years and now I’m living aimlessly. I have no goal to achieve-”
"I love you." Cas said, the words never seizing to make Dean's heart flip in his chest. "I honestly can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."
“We should get you to the toilet,” Cas says, and yeah. Nothing like ugly puking and dry heaving noises to serenade such heartfelt words.
Before Dean could answer, Cas spoke, “‘When’ doesn’t matter so much as ‘who’. And, I hope I have the latter locked in.”
Zoe and Ester chant and fling stuff into the fire, the air around them static and murky, having nothing to do with the candles and smoke. Zoe drags the guy’s chair forward, his screams muffled by the cloth tied around his mouth.
Dean didn't remember crossing the distance between the bar and Baby, but as soon as his head thumped against the cool metal, he felt himself shatter. Once the dam broke there was no turning back, and there was enough alcohol in his system to push through another night. So, he drove back to the motel, pulled up into the parking lot and stretched out in the front seat, hoping Cas was asleep enough to not be woken up by the rumble of the engine.
Cas stops his speed walking, turning around to look at Dean. He looks pissed, and Dean could’ve lived with that if it wasn’t for the hurt in his lightning blue eyes. Dean swallows past the lump in his throat.
“Dean, looking good, son.” John clapped him on the shoulder, turning to Cas with an apprehensive nod.
Dean has two servings of bacon, eggs and toast ready by the time Cas shuffles into the kitchen, his hair sticking out at every turn and pajama bottoms bunching up at his ankles.
“Do you have something to tell me, Dean?” Cas asks, blue eyes wide and blown back, “If not, can we please keep doing the kissing?”
He wearily smiles at Dean and wakes past him in the direction of the shower, leaving Dean feeling his gut flip in the most strange, but pleasant way.
“Love can be scary, especially when there is the chance of losing someone for good,” she smiles sadly.
"That's where you are mistaken, brother." Castiel says, "I'm no leader and no one is expected to follow me."
"I was out walking and found this guy lying unconscious in the snow," he rushes out. "And we're not a thing or anything, that's not gonna happen."
"Hey," Dean's hands came up to cup his cheek, "it doesn't matter if you're not like any of them. You're a whole other individual, Cas. You gotta do what fits you the best, and if anyone objects, well, fuck them."
Camael stares at him but raises a hand and illuminates the wardings on the wall surrounding the crypt.
"I believe since I told your brother, it's only fair that I tell you," Cas began. "The spell to remove the mark took some intricate ingredients...one of them was my grace."
"Sweetheart?" he questioned, his own voice sounding barely audible. The memory of Dean calling him that was enough to fill him with warmth.
They wash and dry the dishes standing side by side, yet it feels as though they’re a whole world apart.
"Because we humans feel like we owe shit to the people who gave us a shelter and put food in our belly," Dean replies. "Not that John helped much in either of those but I still wanted that son of a bitch to be proud of me."
“So, how does this whole God thing work?” Dean asks, finally getting the nagging question out of his mind. “I mean, there’s your dad and then there’s these other Gods…”
"You're gonna be fine, Cas." Dean reassured him. "This whole thing is hilarious. Out of all the guys in Chicago and all the construction firms, I ended up liking my boss."
Castiel knows it has been well over eight years since they met, and he isn’t sure why Dean is choosing to forget the three years they were apart. The words
"I found a radio," Dean says, picking up the metal box and holding it in his lap. "Signal's not all that good up here."
“It’s like someone gouged into his chest,” Dr. Robinson says, echoing his thoughts. “The cut is not clean enough for it to be a knife or a blade but it's messy enough to be a…”
Few minutes later, Nadia pulled into the parking lot, looking very much angry before her eyes settled on them and her expression turned into relief. Dean had substantially recovered from his haze by then and was standing upright, though leaning against Castiel's side on occasion, which he was sure was more out of comfort.
"Nothing new. I called for a favor actually," he replied. "Could you find out where Irene is right now?"
helping,” Sam tried to reassure, his heart aching at the way Cas’s frame shifts as though to make himself smaller. “You being here...he needs that. Just don’t take off on him.”
Dean expects Cas to jab at everything wrong with the morphology of dinosaurs or whatever, but Cas is enthralled in the movie, only occasionally grumbling about how improbable it is that the characters manage to survive this long.
Oops, sorry for leaving you guys on a cliff hanger. I'll see you next week! Leave a kudo, I appreciate it a lot.
Days pass and there is absolute tranquility in heaven. No orders are given forth, no briefings are held. After nearly a fortnight, Castiel receives his first message.
"Here, let me show you," Dean guides Cas hand to peel a stripe of skin down the length of the potato, looking up at Cas who just smiles widely like he cracked the Zodiac killer's code.
“I felt like shit. ’S why I left,” he mumbled, screwing his eyes shut. “Felt like the universe had it out for me.”
“Earth to Cas,” Dean snapped his fingers in front of his face. “You look like you’re about to poop.”
Dean lifted his head, “Big talk coming from the guy whose girlfriend threw her job out of the window to hang out with him.”
"Yes, the waitress there kept calling me 'blue eyes'," Cas replies, fiddling with the stereo. If it was anyone else the cops wouldn't have found their body, but Cas gets a pass. He always does.
Cas nodded minutely, eyes still watching the floor with newfound interest. Dean really wanted to hug him.
"You think you know squat about me, don't you?" He snaps, pushing Cas away. "I don't know what the fuck you're looking to get from me but I got nothing, Cas."
“Looking at the tissue damage, it wasn’t a quick job,” Dr. Robinson says. “The victim must have gone through intense pain before cerebral ischemia.”
, trees are awesome. Dean just sits cross legged on the floor of the clearing and breathes for ten whole minutes, fresh air without the stench of blood and rotting bodies. He looks around for as long as he wants, making a mental note to beat the shit out of Sammy for burying him in the middle of nowhere. He wonders if his funeral party had strippers.
“Screw the plan, Cas.” Dean says, eliciting an amused look from Sam. “You know if killing Lilith is the next best thing, we will go ahead with that, don’t you?”
“That’s my excuse too,” Dean sighed, nudging Cas to get him to look at him. “You’re sure you’re gonna be okay?”
"He won't leave, Sammy," Dean said with such conviction in his voice that Castiel, for a moment, doubted if he would ever be able to leave Dean's side. It didn't matter. This was just Dean's concussion talking. When he woke up next morning, Dean would remember why Castiel was in his life to begin with, and what he represented.
They clean up together, moving around the house in practiced ease. Dean takes up dish duty having found the motion of washing and drying the dishes somewhat therapeutic. Once he’s done, he snags two beers for him and Jo, and settles on the couch, absently flipping through the channels. Jo walks past him, hitting him on the back of his head before taking a seat next to him.
They were gathered in a hall with only two exits, each on the opposite sides. It wasn’t easy to slip past the people but once someone managed to, it wouldn't be much trouble to weave through the crowd outside and escape. He spotted Dean and Cas on one end, talking to a man and a woman leaning heavily against each other, their drunken states pretty obvious from their wide smiles and hazy eyes. They talked animatedly and Dean and Cas nodded along, but their eyes were flitting around cautiously.
Sam rolls his eyes, "But then," He continues, "There are mentions in here about the heavenly host organizing rampages to hell, but that was like thousands of years ago."
“Winchester!” A hand lands on his back and Dean turns around to see Aaron, Victor and Gordon. “Made it out of your den?”
He nods, grabbing a scalpel from the tray as soon as the pathologist has her back to him. There is no ectoplasm in the victim’s chest cavity either, which is expected since most of the blood must have pooled at the bottom of the body by now.
When John drank too much and cursed up a storm leaving Sammy teary eyed and shaking—to when the world was just a nudge away from ending, Dean said those words, no matter if he believed it or not.
He pulls into the driveway of the house, the yellow police tapes making it stand out from the rest of the neighbourhood. The streets are empty, the eerie stillness of an untimely death clinging to the air. After one quick look around, he ducks under the tapes, twirling his lock pick between his thumb and middle finger. Gone were the days when he could rip open doors from its hinges with a touch of his finger, so Castiel crouched down next to the handle and started unlocking, glancing behind his shoulder every now and then.
If a soul could blush, Dean's would have been red by now. Cas must really like what he sees because he's never heard the guy speak in anything other than full sentences. Before he could come up with a snarky comment, he was being pulled into a kiss by the back of his neck.
The hand that falls on him almost makes him reach for his gun, but there is that split second familiarity where Dean thinks he knows the shape of that palm. He closes his eyes, swallowing past the lump in his throat. He’s at the bunker. He’s at
"Maybe the man was scared," Dean breathed out. "Maybe he was afraid there'd come a day when no one cared enough to offer him water, so he had to learn to hold his own."
"Yes." Castiel stares at him like it's a blinking contest, "You were in distress and I had to help."
“I was hoping to take some of that weight off your shoulders,” he said as they made their way over to the coffee machine. “I’m here about the two deaths,” he peered at the case file as though he hadn’t memorized the details by then, “Issac Trenton and—”
“Their cherries haven’t popped yet.” Sam makes a face and Cas continues to stare at him. Dean sighs, “Virgins, Cas.”
“I don’t need to be praised for basic human decency, man,” Dean replied. “He’s my best friend and I’d do a whole lot for him. Don’t need anyone singing praises for that.”
They pull up next to the tail end of the row of shops, deciding to work their way up. A look at the man next to him and Dean feels his heart climb all the way up to his throat. Cas looks like a kid in a candy store on Christmas and New Year and Halloween all at once, blue eyes bright and sliding past everything around them.
“Boyfriend.” Dean corrects, partly to see Cas’ reaction. The angel’s face breaks into a grin as never seen before.
"Sometimes you remind me of that mole," Castiel said. "You are always doing what is necessary regardless of the circumstances or the consequences."
“Yes,” Castiel says, mirroring Dean’s smile, finally able to give him some good news. “Come on, let’s talk in our tent. You had a long day.”
Dean felt a pang in his chest, the feeling of something good slipping right through his fingers. The night grew colder and Dean felt his eyelids drooping. Castiel escorted him to the guest room, murmuring a goodnight before closing the door behind him.
"I don't need to," he replies. "From everything you have told me I know how much you care for your brother."
"I don't regret what I did, Dean, no matter how much you try to make me regret my decision," Castiel glanced at Dean, making sure he understood the conviction in his voice. "It's different, I won't lie. It might take me a while to adjust but I have been human before. All I need is to get accustomed to the idea of remaining so for the rest of my life."
“Lord knows I’ve tried to get it past your thick skull that you should give yourself more credit,” Benny mutters. “You’re a damn good man, Dean.”
Cindy knits her brows together, realization slowly dawning on her face. "I have nothing other than a pendant she used to wear."
"Then why won't you even look at me?" Cas asks, the words hanging heavy in the air. "You are the only thing I have left, Dean. It hurts to be next to you and still feel like a stranger."
“You do know what you’re getting into, right?” Sam says, “Kick starting the apocalypse is not going to do you any good.” He’s clearly stalling, giving enough time for Dean to disable the warding. Dean is scratching at the wall behind him blindly, hoping some bit of the red paint —
Someone is pulling the man away and helping Dean up from the floor. Probably the bouncer, Dean thinks.
They walk through the forests, Dean making several double backs as he drinks in the beauty of the place. As they moved further in, the forests slipped away as something similar to a rural town formed ahead of his eyes. Cas moved with purposeful steps, explaining the different parts of heaven to him. Dean followed silently, enjoying watching Cas in his element.
“How unfortunate,” Cas says dryly, earning a chuckle from the two. He sighs, turning to Jaime, “So, how is the job going?”
“Walter was on facetime with a client while he was attacked,” Sam says, leading them over to an empty corner of the room. “The sheriff talked to them. Apparently, there was someone behind Walter and the client asked who it was. Walter turned around and saw something and started screaming, and that’s the last thing they heard before the phone was dropped.”
“I would appreciate it if there wasn’t a next time,” Cas said softly. “You were drunk when you drove back here. You could’ve gotten into an accident–”
“Didn’t know you were a romantic at heart, dude,” Sam laughs. “Sounds like you’ve been thinking about this a lot.”
“Dean,” Castiel pulled him in by his hand, “The washroom is down the hall to the left. Go dry up, I will be back in a minute.”
"We're simply checking all the boxes, ma'am," he said in that gentle voice that could calm even a hungry Wendigo. "It's all just a part of the routine questioning."
Blue eyes like storms stay locked with the green of his own, the world around them fading into a muted blur in the back of his mind. The thud of Castiel's heart under his palm grows harder, matching Dean's own, like canaries trapped in a cage, wanting to be set free.
Castiel opened his mouth to tell Dean to hurry up, only to go still as approaching footsteps caught his attention. Not one, perhaps eight pairs of them approaching from every direction all around him. Castiel tensed, braising himself for the fight. A moment of silence later, a cloud of smoke erupted in the middle of the room, a figure emerging from amidst.
Cas has the blanket wrapped around him tighter, his legs folded on the couch in a crisscross applesauce, cocooning himself in the fabric. His dark hair is haphazardly pointing in every direction, and Dean's fingers itch wanting to smooth it down, or maybe mess it up a little more, who knows. He sets the bowl on the coffee table, pausing for a moment to see if the furniture's legs will buckle.
"Cas," Dean pulls him forward by the lapel of his coat, "It's gonna be fine. I'll be back before you know."
“Don’t flatter yourself, dick,” Dean’s hands comes up to cradle his face, pulling him into a soft kiss. When they pull apart, he asks, “What did I miss?”
"Dean," he said in reply, completely ignoring Sam’s existence as always. Dean never failed to revel in that little act of
It’s quite true, Castiel thinks. Every day could be their last day for a hunter, but thankfully, there is not much Castiel wants to do. It’s a little jarring to think of himself as an age old celestial being full of grace and glory now. Castiel doesn’t remember or know that person, that
“This language has been extinct, and I mean it was used even before the currently known extinct languages were used,” Cas said. “This language is so forgotten, it took me a moment to recognize the symbol.”
Castiel had heard bits and pieces about the man John Winchester was, and the weight he made his sons carry from such young ages. But, with every mention of him, Castiel found himself revolted by the man's audacity to treat Sam and Dean like they were his hunting equipment rather than his children.
"No, your face is too distracting to enjoy the view outside." Castiel was not lying when he said that, even though his intention was to get Dean away from the window.
Dean lets out a groan, a hand coming up to rub his own forehead, “Uh, yeah. What the fuck was that?”
Yeah, Cas really likes Billy Joel, what about it? How do you feel about Cas's little found family? Let me know in the comments.
"If you are wondering how I am here, Jack brought me back," he explains. "He wanted my help in rebuilding some of this world where Chuck had 'messed up', and since my work is done, he informed me I'm needed here."
“She’s weird,” Dean says, as the assigned groups split away. Three angels excluding Castiel remain with them, and they head for the entrance.
Castiel is not sure how ducks correlate to the matter at hand but Dean is right. This is a chance they have to take. If there was any way they could get Sam back, it was to launch an attack without giving the enemy any time to speculate their plans.
Months pass by and many of his brothers and sisters get wasted away in hell as they continue their search for the righteous man. Castiel silently observes humanity in the meantime, new life being born and old souls making their way back to heaven. Humans living their lives under the vision of free will, making choices with such confidence, believing they can shape their destiny. Castiel does not envy them, as choices lead to disobedience which in turn leads to fall; and that is a fate he does not wish upon anyone, let alone himself.
Dean jumps, nearly knocking himself off his chair. When he turns around, he does so with a gun in his hand, pointed straight at Castiel’s chest.
He grabs a cue from the side rack and twirls it around in his hand, locking eyes with one of the men at the pool table. He’s the youngest of them all, dressed in a red flannel with a black shirt underneath and washed out dark jeans. Castiel grins at him, pulling a hundred dollar bill from his pocket.
"Will you boys quit murmuring?" Nadia walked over, an amused smile on her lips. Her hair was pulled into a bun and she was wearing a t-shirt with a batman logo on it and matching sweatpants. She was beautiful. "Hey, Sam. Couldn't stay away, could you?"
“Touché,” he chuckles, the smile fading away as another thought crosses his mind. “I was kinda hoping you’d have chosen to give this life up. Live out the rest of your days without being elbow deep in ghoul guts.”
“She’s not gonna hurt us,” Dean says, not believing the words falling out of his own mouth. “She’s a...
The man opens his mouth to speak, but is pushed aside by a burlier man wearing denim from head to toe, “I’ll take pretty boy here.”
“Trust me, putting your life on hold for your kids is the wrong way to go about it. You gotta let them get adjusted to the way things work for you,” Benny says.
"Holy shit, this can't be real." Dean sucks in a sharp breath, his fingers curling through Castiel's feathers with gentle precision. His feathers bristle under Dean's touch and Castiel sighs softly. It's an act of trust to let anyone touch an angel's wings, let alone a human. But Castiel trusts Dean with his life and will until eternity.
“I’m great, Jess.” Dean fixed her with a stare, him being the one booking it out of the room faster than he could say ‘fuck’.
“It can get pretty frustrating when you aren’t used to this sort of weird on a daily basis,” Dean said.
When Dean blinks his eyes open the room around him is still dark, the quiet chirping of crickets and a pleasant weight on his shoulder filling his senses. Cas has his forehead pressed to Dean's bicep and his palm resting flat on Dean's chest, eyes moving wildly behind his eyelids, probably lost in some dream. With a familiar churn of his gut, Dean realizes how well they fit together, like two pieces of broken glass mended close to be one. With every passing minute, the moment when Cas finds his grace and sets off to work out whatever it is that heaven usually does looms closer and closer over them. Dean can only wish he could stop time, just hold Cas close to him and forget the world around them.
