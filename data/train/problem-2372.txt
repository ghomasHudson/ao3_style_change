How could it be possible that this boy allegedly shared a campus with him, but he had never so much as heard his name? Surely he dreamed, right?
“So…” Charlie started, her bubbly demeanor fading as she sensed his energy shift. “Do you want to tell me what’s been going on with you?”
Charlie’s jaw snapped shut as she nodded slowly, clearly not happy with dropping the subject, but doing so anyway.
The voice in his head chanted as a weight descended in Castiel’s chest. Guilt bubbled in his stomach-- or maybe that was hunger?
There are many others who call him by his first name, but none of them say it with such gravity. No one else could speak the one syllable as though it were a coveted prayer, the low timbre making his spine tingle. No one else has ever said his name like-
Stunned, Castiel realized that Dean’s fluttery feeling was directed towards… him? Castiel, of all people? Not only had Dean seen him but he had felt
He wasn’t rooted to the ground this time, which was relieving. He was in a large clearing in the dead of night, surrounded by a wooded forest. Castiel inhaled the fresh air deeply-- this was definitely an upgrade from his usual stuffy emptiness.
Castiel was struck motionless as images flooded his mind: a boy, joyously dancing in a field as sparks showered around him, and his older brother looking at the sky with eyes practically glowing. The fireworks could have been going off in Castiel’s mind for all he knew, but the burning sensation in his gut returned at the mere memory of Dean’s smile, and he couldn’t continue ignoring it.
As Castiel’s body continued striding confidently through the entrance to the library, he felt his head turn and his mouth open to speak to someone.
“It sounds familiar because we’ve met before, Castiel. In fact, we’re practically old friends. After all, I was the one who trained you personally on your 18th birthday.”
As he tried to crane his neck to view around the corner of the room’s entrance, there was a loud crashing sound from where the boy’s shaggy hair had just disappeared, followed by several annoyed swears.
Out of nowhere, he was blinded by a bright light and a splitting headache-- an image of Dean shackled to the ceiling of a cellar burst through his mind’s eye.
“It started as a chance, I think. I just kind of ended up in one of his dreams a couple nights ago. He couldn’t see or hear me, but the dreams felt like memories, in a way.” Castiel glossed over the emotional aspect, as he couldn’t even articulate to himself what Dean made him feel without ever having spoken a word to him.
“Why don’t we go with the rest of them and work on making that study guide for econ?” she asked brightly.
To his (Dean’s) right, a tall man was matching his pace as they walked through the library. Castiel instantly recognized him as Sam, but as Dean continued speaking to his brother, Castiel felt an overwhelming sense of love and pride, but it wasn’t his emotion.
Part of him wanted to let go and funnel his frustrations into a rant towards Charlie, but even in his altered state he couldn’t let himself say anything that could hurt his best friend.
Castiel scrubbed a hand over his face as he paced, ignoring the scenes strewn around him begging to be sent out. People were just going to have to go without dreams for tonight, he supposed.
From what Castiel could gather through hearsay and eavesdropping, it had been about five days since Dean was last seen on campus.
“What’s up bitches?” Charlie said a bit too loudly as they approached the table where their friends were seated.
Castiel looked up in awe at the explosion of colors, slowly walking forward to get a better look at who had set them off. As he crossed the clearing, being sure to stay in the shadows despite the darkness, he could see two figures standing next to a large black car in the distance. One was significantly smaller than the other, cheering excitedly as fireworks continued to fill the sky.
Something was wrong, but he brushed it off, not willing to engage with even more confusing emotions.
Castiel glanced up from his textbook for the first time during the conversation and placed his pen on the table, scanning the room quickly for any unwanted listeners before leaning in to reply, lowering his already deep voice.
“Well, yeah I guess. I know it bothered you so I wasn’t going to say anything but I just…” Charlie trailed off and pointedly avoided making eye contact with Castiel.
Charlie smiled and all but dragged Castiel up the hill towards the main campus library. Castiel still felt a bit out of it as he watched his warped reflection in the tall glass windows that covered the building.
Castiel looked down in confusion at his arms which were now pinned to his sides. He had heard of sleep paralysis happening to others-- hell, he had handed out quite a few paralysis-inducing nightmares, but this was entirely new to him. Since when did sleep paralysis occur while dreaming?
Some part of Castiel knew that whatever was happening was for a reason and that Dean’s missing status was likely involved, but the rest of him was inclined to be selfish for once.
As they met up with the rest of the group, Castiel remained more subdued than usual as his brain fog didn’t allow much processing through, beyond the occasional contribution to their studying. He stared around the library and appreciated the soft hum of chatter that surrounded them as well as the unique smell that accompanies large collections of books. He had always loved the library.
“Since forever! He was practically written for you, man. And you can be both. Unfortunately, my best friend contains multitudes, or whatever” Charlie laughed and Castiel could hear her voice on the other side of his door as she approached.
Cas’ face fell and he stuttered, “Wh-what do you mean? The doctor said he’s doing really well. He- he should wake up! He will! H- he- he'll wake up any day now!”
“Who's… the Sandman?” He asked, only just remembering to remove his hand from his hair and crossing his arms over his chest.
The posters covering the library hallways advertising the week’s events looked far too familiar. Not only did Dean attend the same school, but he was also a senior-- this had been Castiel’s move-in day as well. He racked his brain to remember what he could have been doing during this time, but he didn’t have to wonder for very long.
Castiel’s brow creased even further as he found himself chewing his fingernails, a habit he typically only fell into when he was deep in thought. Without any way of controlling when or how he entered the dream, there was no guarantee he’d be able to dream walk again, let alone use it to gather any clues as to Dean’s whereabouts.
Castiel tried not to get frustrated as he began to realize Charlie wouldn’t magically be able to fix this. “I have no idea. I was barely there for a minute-- I don’t even know how he could’ve gotten down there, let alone why.” He took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut tight, willing his mind to bring back any useful images. “I think there was an IV hooked up to him, or something. He had lost a lot of blood.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean grabs the mug and takes a scalding swig, groaning in appreciation. Sammy may be a smartass but he buys the good stuff. “Mmm… so you get any sleep at all, kid?” he grumbles.
but ultimately it’s just that. A shiny, pretty penny, sitting in Dean’s palm when he already has a belly full of food, his brother by his side and no flying objects nearby ready to take him out. Completely useless.
get excitable, jump on their parent’s (or long suffering big brother’s) beds at ass o’clock in the morning because they can’t wait to get started on a day that’s all about them. Dean gets it, hell, he thinks it’s cute, and in some ways he thinks it’s a damn good start to the day. Just two little problems:
The small child giggles with energy befitting her heightened blood sugar content, and Castiel watches the strange ritual closely. Watches the child’s sibling take a coin from the mother’s hand and repeat the motion, smiling inanely as it disappears beneath the rippling water of the fountain. Watches the little gathering wander away, not waiting to see if their ‘wishes’ come true or not. Not seeming to care much either way.
With a thoughtful hum, Cas turns back to look at the fire and takes a cautious sip of his beer. His nose scrunches a little. His grace must be stronger tonight, fucking with his sense of taste. Or maybe he just doesn’t appreciate the Gas ‘N’ Sip’s cheapest beer like Dean does, who’s to say. Whatever. Dean smiles and lifts his own bottle, knocking back the last dregs-
Jack is staring up at him, silent and watchful and knowing in a way most three year olds definitely aren’t. Dean tries not to shrivel under his gaze. “But I’m enough like him.”
Dean does, and bursts into laughter at the picture that comes into view; a little cartoon guy giving a big thumbs up, right under writing proudly proclaiming: ‘HERE COMES COOL DAD’.
Sam babbles some shit into his chest- about Dad, about hunting, about greasy diner food and leg cramp from the car rides and all the other shit he complains about all the time because hello, he’s an eleven year old who basically lives in a fucking car and it sucks- and for once, Dean just lets him. Doesn’t try and defend it, sweet talk him, distract him. Just lets him rant and rage and cry for once. Maybe if he’d let him vent a little earlier, before he decided to get the hell outta dodge…
Cas smiles, all fondness and love and the most gorgeous crinkles around his eyes. Age lines, Dean supposes. He’ll add laughter lines to their number if it takes the rest of their goddamn lives. “You will.”
Dean manages a weak laugh, “Yeah, buddy that’s kinda my point.” After a moment, he adds, “So, how was the ceremony?” Really,
And how did Dean get so goddamn lucky that he gets to straddle an angel who tastes like strawberries and smells like
thing ever. Dean’s heart flutters and fuck, Cas is gonna be the death of him. He doesn’t know what makes him do it, he thinks maybe Cas swallowed a magnet. A really, really powerful magnet that draws him in and makes him peck the angel lightly on the lips.
, because Sam thought it would make him less anxious. Castiel had informed the younger Winchester that a six-pack would actually be much more effective, but Sam had only rolled his eyes.
Ketch looks thoroughly pained, and Dean thinks he might apologize, but instead he croaks out, “Kinky, angel.”
Dean's mouth curls and he doesn’t answer, just stares daggers at Ketch. Needless to say, when they get to the motel, he’s in an exceptionally crappy mood.
Dean finishes with Cas’ buttons, then swallows hard before taking his shirt off all the way. Cas is suddenly very aware of the fact that he’s alone with Dean. Dean, who is wonderful and stunning, who just took Cas’ shirt off, and who seems to be shamelessly checking Cas out at this very moment. Dean suddenly clears his throat, stands up quickly, and goes to get a wet rag and a roll of bandages from the table.
on the other hand, blushes his ass off. “Um, Dean,” he starts. “I don’t know how you’ve- who told-” Cas clears his throat. Dean’s smile grows wide as the angel stumbles over his words because
Well… ok that’s true but… that might be because Dean and Cas really don’t spend too much time together. Cas is always zapping off on missions to Heaven or wherever, and Dean’s not bitter about that. Or hurt. At all. That’s just fine. Point is, they just don’t get the opportunity to hang out too much. But, Jesus, would it be nice if they did.
He squints up at Dean, his face now unreadable. (This may not have been the best idea.) “What do you mean?” Cas asks slowly. He doesn’t even look at the magazine, so Dean is forced to explain everything.
. Logic and evidence? No, why would that change Cas’ mind? But as soon as Sam insults his pride? The angel bounds to his feet and determinedly marches away.
Meanwhile Ketch is looking back and forth between Cas and the Cupid and then he grins, “My pleasure.” And he actually
Cas is just gaping at him, apparently speechless. Somewhere in the back of his head, Dean is aware that he should probably be freaking out, but Cas’ lips are even softer than they look and all Dean can do is grin, and plant another kiss on the top of his head.
Cas gulps and squints at the wall. “What do you mean?” he asks, even though they both know exactly what he means.
, thankfully, as Dean whips up the batter and fries up a bunch of pancakes, which he shapes into big hearts. It’s actually pretty cute.
Cas tightens his grip on Dean’s waist. At some point his hands had slipped underneath Dean’s shirt, and Cas slowly starts stroking the bare skin there. “I fell for you. In every way imaginable, and I wouldn’t take back a second. Of
Then, probably as a last-ditch effort to try and save herself, the Cupid shoots something at Cas. Or at least, that’s what it looks like. Dean can’t actually
“Yeah, and you also got hitched. So, what- you two gonna move in together? Half the time here, half the time in Syria, what’s the deal?” Dean just says it to hurt Cas, but as soon as it comes out of his mouth, his heart sinks and he wonders if maybe Cas actually
Sam is pouring milk into his Raisin Bran when Dean saunters in, looking happier than he has been in a while. Possibly ever.
Dean literally gags hearing those words outta Cas’ mouth. He looks around for support, but Sam gives him a helpless gesture and Rowena is busy muttering something under her breath. Dean sighs, “Cas, look,
“Um…” Cas is frozen in place. He can’t answer, or move, or do anything other than stare completely transfixed at Dean’s soft red lips.
“Dean,” Cas says, and he looks ashamed for some reason. “Who do you think? The only people I know are you and Sam.”
“Oh, trust me, I do,” Dean snorts. Cas doesn’t answer. Fuck, he needs to stop. He’s not some friggin possessive boyfriend, and he’s got no right to act like it.
When they finally, reluctantly, part, Cas gives a weak smile as he heads off to his room, and Dean watches him go forlornly.
ok if u watched the show u prob get that i mostly just paraphrased mishas big love confession so like, credit to the cw
The two of them roll around on the floor a little while longer before Rowena suddenly gets real loud with her mumbo jumbo, and a flash of bright purple light shoots towards them, enveloping the angel.
, he won’t,” Sam cuts him off hastily, shooting Dean a sharp glare. “But, seriously Rowena, can you fix him?”
Cas’ nostrils flare as he headbutts him, then grabs Ketch by the collar and forcefully chucks him halfway down the hall.
After a lot of unnecessary swallowing and looking at each other’s lips, Dean finally breaks the silence. “Whoever it is, Cas, they’d uh…” he clears his throat. “They’d be lucky to have you.”
. It’s pure… and funny and caring-” he breaks off suddenly. Dean can’t tell for sure in the dark, but he thinks the angel is blushing. He whispers, “Even if it’s unrequited,” and Dean wonders if he was meant to hear that part.
When Cas pulls back (why is he pulling back?), Dean is literally left panting. “Uh, wow,” he says dumbly.
Dean frowns too, looking back up (trying not to encourage the desperate ray of hope fluttering around inside).
Cas turns and puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. It’s comfortable and familiar, and Cas looks Dean in the eyes, and maybe he gets caught up in them for a moment too long before he swallows and says, “Thank you, Dean.”
, and not Dean. He’d always thought maybe… but it doesn’t matter what he’d thought. Cas wants to kiss
other than the fact that he’s ‘checking up on them’. Whatever that means, Dean doesn’t like it. And he doesn’t like that some asshole with an irritating accent can invade their space whenever he feels like it.
really good too. When Cas bites his lip gently, Dean gasps. Cas takes that opportunity to slip his tongue into Dean’s mouth and
“Cas! The hell you doing here? Are you ok?” Dean asks, rushing towards him. Cas smiles weakly, and a stupid part of him melts at the look of frantic worry on Dean’s face.
Sam hears the unmistakable sound of Dean kicking something, then cussing viciously. Oh yeah, he’s totally fine.
The ever growing lump in Dean’s throat explodes and before he can stop himself, he’s taking two steps towards Ketch and swinging. The loud smack that fills the room is satisfying, and even more so is the sight of Ketch’s head snapping back as red blooms from his nose. Dean considers punching him in the gut, too, just for good measure, when Cas grabs Dean’s wrist from behind and shoves him away.
Sam just rolls his eyes. “I’m happy for you- both of you,” his brother says honestly. He could at least
Cas scowls. “I’m fairly certain I’m never going to see her again, it’s just a formality. Unless you would prefer that I take up residence in Syria?”
, here, has found himself a true love.” Dean says, his voice strained as he claps Cas on the back. The angel just frowns at him.
And now, after they got so close to… a kiss maybe? Hopefully?- there’s a crazy impulse that’s getting harder and harder to ignore, and he thinks if he opens his mouth just a tiny bit all his stupid love will come pouring out, so he grits his teeth and keeps driving.
Ha! Point- Dean Winchester. Not that this is a competition. If it was though, he would be winning. Just saying. Because Cas remembers everything.
Cas’ heart skips a beat. A couple of lightbulbs spark above them and Cas feels his face heat up. He curses inwardly.
“Cas,” says an all too familiar voice. Castiel’s favorite voice, coincidentally. He turns around slowly.
Sam looks up when he hears the bunker door slam shut. His brother and Cas are coming in, both looking pretty tense. So… they didn’t hook up, then. Damn, these idiots. There’s only so many times Sam can tell his brother take Cas on a hunt…  and spend a few nights in a motel room with him. Alone. Together. You know?
, but Cas is so close and he sure looks like he wants this too, and Dean doesn't think he has it in him to stop.
Dean doesn’t know why he feels a sharp pang of jealousy in his chest. (Ok, well, he does know why, but whatever.) Who the hell is Cas writing letters to? Why didn’t Dean ever get one?
. “No, Cas, that’s- stay. It’s fine by me.” Well that’s gotta be the biggest lie he’s ever told, and his voice sounds awfully tinny. “Does he know?”
imagine Cas rubbing himself against Dean and leaning in… That’s fucked up, anyway- Cas is under a spell, he doesn’t want this. And Ketch- the arrogant
Dean rolls his eyes. “Get outta here, Sammy,” he grumbles, without looking away from Cas, whose face is flickering through several different emotions with unnatural speed.
He risks a glance at his friend, who’s glaring out the window, the letter clutched tightly in his slightly shaking grasp.
Cas looks up with wide eyes, but he doesn’t deny anything or play dumb, which Sam appreciates. “I can’t,” he explains after a moment.
Dean laughs softly. “You’re such an idiot,” he sighs, and starts fixing Cas’ backwards tie. It’s not the first time that Sam’s wondered if Cas purposely puts it on wrong. And of course Dean takes his time, straightening it as inefficiently as he possibly can.
Cas smiles though, just a little bit, just with his eyes and the corners of his mouth. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Yes, I… wasn’t supposed to tell you this, but… there’s a mission,” Castiel blatantly lies. “A top-secret mission that requires my immediate attention.”
“Hey,” he mumbles. “You’re back.” Dean reaches a hand down to help Cas up, and after studying him for a moment, Cas accepts the help.
Cas tries to take off his trench coat and immediately exclaims in pain. The movement of his arms tears something and more blood flows down his back, seeping into his layers of clothing.
The hunter sways slightly into Cas and asks, “Kiss for the road?” Dean is starting to seriously question Ketch’s sanity.
expression, just shrugs. “Hey Cas,” he calls. Cas turns around. “You’re not, uh, in love with… Ketch, are you?” Sam asks.
Dean glares at him, wanting to start a fight. “How many times do I have to tell you not to do anything
on sitting in the back with Ketch. Even though his mojo is a little iffy, Dean doesn’t really want to risk getting smited, so he very reluctantly allows it.
the second Dean leans back, so. No, Dean will not be letting him go, instead he loops his arms around Cas’ neck. Because he needs to hear that sound again, and he needs this stupid trenchcoat off. He needs to feel the scratch of stubble and the hot, wet slide of lips and tongue against his own.
“Oh,” Dean mumbles. “That’s…” he clears his throat, blushing hard. “Good to know.” He opens his mouth to say, like,
Dean ignores him and continues feverishly exploring Cas’ mouth, but the angel pulls away. When Dean shamelessly chases his lips, Cas turns his head and Dean’s sloppy kiss misses and lands on Cas’ stubble. Asshole. Dean sighs loudly and rests his forehead on Cas’ shoulder.
Cas sees the pained expression on Dean’s face and hangs his head. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he apologizes. “It doesn’t have to change anything, but I can leave if you feel uncomfortable.”
“You’re mine,” he whispers, before crashing his lips against Castiel’s again. Damn, Cas smells good, and he
Dean starts towards him immediately, unsure if Cupids can actually inflict any damage, or if all their arrows do is make people fall in love. Ketch moves at the same time, taking one of his fancy gadgets and thrusting into the Cupid’s chest.
that he completely forgets to kiss back. After a moment though, he finally processes things enough to participate. Enthusiastically.
Cas punches him in the face. Ketch just smiles. Jesus Christ, if Dean didn’t absolutely hate him, he might actually be impressed with his courage (or maybe audacity is a better word for it).
Castiel obliges while Dean digs through his closet for something. “Here,” he announces finally, holding out an excessively creased piece of paper. “I wrote one first.”
is not a good sign. Sam definitely recognizes the overly cheerful tone. It usually means that Dean’s mad as hell.
Dean marches into the library where he knows Cas is, and maybe he’s smiling a little too much, because Cas takes one look at him and asks what’s wrong. Sammy just wearily says, “What did you do.” (Rude.)
He subtly looks over again. Cas has a really nice jawline. And his long eyelashes are casting shadows over his face. And his hair looks especially dark and messy-
“Oh… um. Claire sent me the same one.” Cas looks up smugly, “Obviously I didn’t take it so seriously that I came onto you immediately after reading it, but…”
“Cas!” Dean yells, trying to stop Cas from pummeling his face in without actually hurting his friend.
Dean bristles angrily, “So help me, Rowena, you’re gonna fix him right now, or I will put a goddamn witch killing bullet through your-
Ok, does it count if Dean hypothetically kinda drags the guy around and doesn’t really give him a choice? Probably.
The lights flash tellingly overhead and Dean smiles and cups Cas’ jaw with one hand, pulling his face up until their lips meet. Cas inhales sharply and wraps his arms around Dean as best as he is able. Dean’s lips are as soft and perfect as they look, and he tastes so deliciously good it makes Cas dizzy. Dean’s other hand is traveling down Cas’ bare spine, making him shiver and moan, which Dean seems to appreciate. When they finally pull apart, three of the dumb bulbs have shattered, Dean’s face is flushed and he looks both pleased and delighted, and Cas can’t stop grinning. Dean laughs and taps Cas’ nose, “Stop smiling you dork."
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Let’s get this show on the road,” he urges, desperate for Cas to stop looking at Ketch like…
“Oh, don’t you dare,” Dean growls. He grabs Cas’ hips and slides him up against the wall, and a thrill rushes through Dean when he remembers Cas is a goddamn angel, which means he’s
considered PDA nowadays? Because honestly, the angel is free to engage in way more friggin public affection than that. (As long as it’s with Dean.) Yeah, Cas can… he can do
Sam winces a bit, and contorts his face into that expression that means Dean’s not gonna like whatever he’s about to hear. “Dean, hey, I don’t like him either but… he could be helpful.”
Dean broodily traipses down the stairs, which actually isn’t that unusual. “Hey, Sammy! Guess what?”
Cas looks up at him, smiling affectionately, and Dean hurriedly drops his eyes again. Cas turns around and Dean starts wiping away sticky blood, swearing viciously at goddamned angels who hurt his best friend and what he’ll do if he ever catches them. For all his harsh words, Dean’s touch is surprisingly gentle and intimate, and when he finishes up, Cas misses the warmth of his fingertips.
“You…” Cas growls at Ketch. Castiel doesn’t continue, not wanting to let his mind linger on his inappropriate behavior, nor Ketch’s vulgar touch, nor the dirty words that had been whispered to him.
he can’t believe he just thought that). Well, except for the fact that Cas is also attempting several blows to Dean’s head, but still.
He thought he was the fucking expert on hiding your feelings, God knows he’s been keeping this shit in for
Before Ketch can even open his slimy mouth, Cas twists his arms behind his back in an uncomfortable looking grip, knees the guys hard in the balls (Sam and Dean wince simultaneously), then smashes his elbow into Ketch’s ribs.
Dean glowers at all of them for a moment before accepting that he’s not gonna win. So he turns on his heel and marches up the stairs dramatically, yelling over his shoulder, “Fine! But you’re sitting in the back.
Dean feels like someone reached into his chest and is squeezing, and squeezing- and he can’t take it anymore. “
Soon enough, his wishful thinking turned into doubts and eventually bitterness. It was easier that way. Low expectations couldn't cause disappointment.
He belted out in amusement at the man's innocence. The fallen angel was completely adorable, and Dean was totally fucked.
He didn't know if Dean even noticed the closeness, but Cas was acutely aware. It seemed like every move or breath he took would set off an alarm, and make Dean go running. Like there was a firework tucked inside the space, ready to burst. He was sure if he dared another inch to his right, the other teen would move away and all the electricity would be lost.
Instead, this strange system targeted his weakness and turned him into even more of an outsider than he already was. He would never know the first words his soulmate said to him. He was stuck just making do with a guess and hope. Even if he didn't wholeheartedly believe in the idea, he secretly wished he knew what the fuss was all about. At night, in the quiet of his room, he would imagine what his tattoo would say, or act out scenarios of his first meeting with his soulmate. The wonder and eventual satisfaction must feel like flying, or maybe falling. These bouts usually ended in puffy eyes and broken glass.
Dean took a deep breath, and stepped forward. He cornered the man against the freezer door, and placed his hands on either side of his head. He leaned in so he was inches from the man's ear.
Cas leaned into his touch and closed his eyes, stars be damned. The real view was right in front of him.
That was honestly the most remarkably cheesy and predictable comeback he could have come up with. Cas nearly laughed out loud, but quickly muffled himself, forgetting for a second that it would disturb other students.
A minute went by, then two, then three, and the other boy still hadn't written back. He may not be the best with social interactions, but he thought he had been doing okay. He replayed the conversation in his head over and over, trying to figure out where he went wrong. Maybe he shouldn't have drawn a winking face. That probably made him really uncomfortable, and now he was sitting there regretting ever reaching out to him.
It was like that simple contact ignited something in him, and, before Cas could think twice, he tucked his head into the crook of Dean's shoulder.
Dean's mouth twitched up, and his face blushed scarlet. He would be lying if he said that it wasn't the cutest thing ever.
Cas squeezed his hand, and Dean completely forgot he had to squeeze back. He could only stare at the floor and hope his face didn't appear as red as it felt.
"Then, perhaps, we should have more platonic fun? I mean, since we've been missing out on it all these years." He smirked and carded his fingers through the other boy's hair.
The man pressed on, “No, no I totally get it. You’re obviously impressed by my career potential and obvious sense of style.” He gave a toothy grin and waggled his eyebrows, as he gestured to his mop and green apron. Underneath the latter, he noticed the presence of a flannel. Shouldn’t that be against some sort of employee code?
"No, no, I get it. You can't help it that you're attracted to me." Dean blushed furiously at that remark, obviously meant as a joke. He forced himself to look anywhere but those big dumb eyes, but even so, he could feel the man's gaze on him.
The older Winchester smirked at him, "Well, that's the only size left in the store. Maybe your hands just too small." Okay, maybe he was exaggerating. Cas' hands might be a bit shorter than his, but they were stronger, smoother, and utterly beautiful, lacking the years of wear and tear that Dean's held. He caught himself staring, and immediately snapped his eyes up, reverting his face back to a cocky grin.
Dean blushed furiously at his insinuations. He fought to look anywhere but the pools of blue currently burning holes in Dean's forehead.
at him, apparently forgetting they were laying in the middle of the grocery store. "Right, of course. Anything for you, Dean."
The green-eyed man snorted and leaned against the counter. “My bad. I didn’t take you for the angry-at-his-deranged-stepmom type.”
After the way Dean looked at him, open-mouthed and blotchy cheeked, he was definitely going to find more ways to make that boy blush.
The younger man stiffened and looked around precariously. “No dead bodies everyone. Nothing to worry about.” Cas nearly laughed out loud as the guy carelessly backed into the mop bucket, cursed, and hurried into the back room.
After parking in a slush pile, he stumbled into the coffee shop with his blue tie astray and snow sticking haphazardly to his pant leg. The aroma of freshly-ground coffee was instantly therapeutic.
The dark-haired man stared back wide-eyed, nearly tripping on his own feet. He watched intently as the barista realized he exclaimed that to a room full of people, and his expression immediately transformed to one of humility.
"Here, let me." Dean stood behind him, his chest practically inches from Cas' back as he undid the knot. It was all he could do not to lean into the touch.
long week, and all I want to do is go home, and eat this pie. Now, I'm sure you can understand that, so if you don't mind, I would
The former angel stepped closer as he placed his palm against Dean's gently, aligning the bottom of their hands up to the tips of their fingers. They stood so close Dean could smell his own aftershave on Cas, and see every fleck of deep blue in his eyes. It was easy to view the way his chapped lips sat slightly parted, and how every inch of stubble was suddenly on display. Dean's breath hitched, as he held Cas' gaze, both of them refusing to look away.
Suddenly Cas' hand was no longer under his chin but cupped the side of his face. Dean swallowed as Cas' head inclined toward his.
This only prompted the other man to move closer as he laced their fingers together and dropped them by their sides.
"Shut up, and come enjoy this with me." He sat down on the blanket, and tugged the other boy down with him.
"Hey, I'm not kidding." He kissed the top of Cas' head. "Just-" then his forehead "-platonic-" now his cheek "-fun."
“That would be me.” He snagged the paper cup, and turned toward the other man before he ran out. “Thanks for… cleaning that up. And you know.” He smiled sheepishly.
“It’s… understandable,” says Cas diplomatically, petting Jack’s hair and not making eye contact with Dean. “I would like it if he could grow up without certain burdens, too. But I will miss the moments we’ve shared.”
And it may feel like carving his own chest open to talk about but Cas has waited so long, been so patient and Dean doesn’t wanna drive him away again, or poison this
He can’t quite bring himself to elaborate. It’s one thing to say he hopes this kid doesn’t carry guilt over what he did to Mary all his life- he thinks that’s pretty normal, not wanting your kid to shoulder that kind of burden. It’s another to admit the selfish reasons; like he doesn’t want Jack to remember Dean at his worst. The resentment, the anger, how unfair he was, how callous. It shouldn’t have taken him this long, he shouldn’t have needed to have Jack shrunk down to his actual physical age and thrust into his arms to see what a goddamn jerk he was for taking out his feelings on the kid, but here he is. And now if he has to admit to Cas that he’d rather their boy forget everything than know what a piece of shit his old man is, he may just crumble from the shame.
He almost says it’s nothing. It’s fine. It’s none of his business. But it isn’t, and it isn’t, and it
Next to Dean the covers shift and a dark, ruffled head of hair pops out, followed by a pair of groggily squinting blue eyes. Cas’ voice rumbles from under the blankets like aftershocks to Jack’s earthquake. “Jack… what time is it…?”
, and he deserves to know the mess he’s about to get himself into. The more times Cas left Dean behind, the more times Dean had to learn how to function with the only goddamn good thing besides his brother in his life gone, the more he realised maybe the only things truly separating Dean and John Winchester were a few bottles of whiskey and an unchecked void of howling grief. And that’s the kind of shit Cas has to know before he gets himself or his son tangled up in Dean’s mess for good- before he does something stupid like trust Dean to hold the fort if he gets left behind again.
He walks over, bends down, picks up what turns out to be a shiny nickel and turns it over in his palm. He’s never
He takes Dean by the chin again, turns his face upwards and waits patiently for him to open his eyes and meet his gaze.
He angrily scrubs at his eyes, willing the tears away. Stupid. What good did crying ever do anyone? Crying is for when you’re so drunk you can’t see, like Dad gets sometimes. The kinda drunk when you’re past the anger. Dean has more important things to do than cry- he has a punk-ass little brother to catch, for one. Shit, he couldn’t have got far… right?
“Yes, I think he does,” says Cas, soft and a little wistful. He could pull up a chair to sit next to them, but he doesn’t seem to wanna be away from Jack’s side for a second. Or Dean’s, for that matter. “But I’m not sure how long that will last. I’m given to understand that children retain very few memories from their first few years; if he grows as a normal child would, those memories may fade.
“See a penny, pick it up,” he drawls, scooping up the coin with a smirk. “How many pennies d’you think I gotta pick up to cancel out all those mirrors we broke with Bloody Mary?”
But they make do. Give the kid some syrup, a drink, Cas gently dabs down his little baby brow with a cool, damp cloth. And when the kid's still whimpering pitifully, Dean brings out the big guns, softly singing under his breath and letting old reliable
“Okay, check ‘em, I’m pretty sure Sam threw in some medicine and stuff good for kids Jack’s age while we were getting him clothes. If there’s any syrup grab that, it’ll go down easier. I’ll get him as comfy as I can, lay him down somewhere darker.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean pulls Jack’s tiny hand away from his face and wraps it in his palm. “Okay, okay, point taken.” He gives the kid a serious stare. “You better not take his side every time, man- you’re the tie break vote, you gotta be unbiased.”
It isn’t long before those eyes are flickering up, away from the fire and to the sky, and Dean follows them to find an infinite map of stars stretched out above their heads.
Dean shrugs, tapping his fingers on his bottle. “I mean… I think so. But memories, man. She could’ve sounded like a chainsmoking bullfrog, and I’d still think she had the voice of a fucking angel. Uh- you know what I mean. Hey, can angels actually sing?”
The mental image of that shopping trip is funny enough to crack through Dean’s grouchy morning sulk with a smirk. “Aww. You get me somethin’ too, Cas?” he teases.
“Given the circumstances, I think Sam is doing very well for himself, actually.” He swipes away a tear from Dean’s cheek. “And you’ve come a long way, too.”
Hell, maybe they’ll see a signpost for a circus on the way to the lake and toss that entire fishing game plan out the window anyway- why not, it’s their day and for now at least they don’t have Sam’s clownphobia to consider.
hand- covers his own on Jack’s back. He stares at it for a hot second, until he feels Cas’ other hand cup his cheek, tilt it up, turn Dean to meet his eyes. It takes effort not to shy away under the intensity, but Dean steels himself and holds his ground as those old, old eyes pin him in place.
Jack pauses and thinks a moment, brow wrinkling. “Yeah. A little. I was excited- can I give you my present now?”
“Dean,” he says softly. “You never have to carry on alone again. You have safety now, family, a big one that cares for you, for
He’d rather be sat in the warm, familiar Impala than out on this cold, shitty park bench, but tough shit; what he needed more than a warm place to cry was for Dad to not be in eye or ear shot while Dean quietly broke down like some lovesick teenager. He'd said something vague about scoping out the area to explain himself, give him some cover, leaving John in the car listening in on local police radio and none the wiser. He'd never know why Dean really peeled off. Never know his son, his
If he was hoping to catch Dean off guard with the quick subject change, he’s outta luck. Dean’s pretty used to his weird tangents these days. He shrugs and fumbles around in the cooler for another bottle. “Just one of those nights.” He pops the cap with his ring and passes it to Cas. “Nothin’ to be done.”
Instead he leans back a little, scuffing his heels in the dirt and gesturing up at the sky with the bottle in his hand. “Bet you can name ‘em all, huh?”
He doesn’t get an answer but he finds the kid anyway, hunkered down behind a dumpster. He’s not quite a grubby-faced Victorian orphan yet but he looks about as sad and lost as one. Dean drops to his knees on the gross asphalt in front of him and crushes the little dummy in a hug, letting him ugly snot-cry into the front of his shirt because he’s too goddamn relieved to complain. Much.
In his left, a shiny coin, held so tight in his fist it leaves perfect little pink indents in his palm.
He watches it sink, watches it settle and become one with the mass of coins below the water’s surface, and tilts his head. Very interesting. No perceptible physical or magical effects, and yet the motion is… calming. Satisfying, even. The journey of the coin, the sound of impact, the lightning fast flicker of his thoughts as he lets his mind alight naturally on whatever he might choose to ‘wish’ for. No evidence to be found that the action had any effect, or that his wish might be granted.
Fuck, his mouth feels dry. His heart’s pounding, he can hear his blood rushing in his ears. Is this how Cas felt, holding out his weird little heart in his hands? No, he’d been
“Well, I did. Someone had to keep an eye on Sam, pick him up when he cried, keep him fed. Sometimes it was just easier to stay awake, ‘stead of waking up five times a night.” He shrugs it off like it’s no big thing, even though he knows Cas disagrees and Sam would too. Even though he can feel something tired and bitter lurking in his chest. “Sometimes you wake up the second time and it’s harder to fall back asleep so you just say fuck it, we’re done. You get used to running on four hours or less, if it’s easier. Not like anyone was gonna read me a damn bedtime story.”
He’s twenty-three, and he’s still not got over that super gross and annoying urge to cry sometimes. Go figure.
Cas' eyes flutter closed and he melts into the touch, and Dean's chest fucking caves in. All those times he held himself back from reaching out, too goddamn scared of how he felt, of what other people would see, and all this time he would've found Cas reaching right back.
They’ve got a ways to go. Dean isn’t naive enough to think they’re all gonna slide into the apple pie life without some pushback. They have things to figure out, decisions to make about what they are, where they’ll go, what’s best for Jack and best for this thing they’re just now starting to call a relationship. They’ll wanna move, probably, raise the kid somewhere with natural light and less dangerous magical crap. They’ll wanna be close enough to Sam that he can visit, but far enough to get a little distance- Dean has some old habits and patterns to break out of and he figures step one is making sure him and his brother aren’t living in each other’s pockets anymore. They’ll wanna make sure Jack’s got all the shots and stuff he needs, make sure they’ve got the papers they need to send him to school, kindergarten, whatever. They’ll wanna make sure their
A thought, a memory, hits Dean then like a punch in the gut. The thought that the last time he had a little baby hand grabbing at his fingers like this, his own hand was barely any bigger. Four years old, and somehow he was all that little kid had to hold onto. Four years old, small and traumatised and as nonverbal as the child in his hands right now.
It stings because Dean doesn’t know. He can’t know, not really. The mom he remembers from when he was a baby, she’s a collection of faded memories and sketchy impressions and details from his dad’s drunken ramblings, all smooshed together into some kinda fucking collage of the perfect mom, the perfect wife, apple pie and apron strings. And the mom he met when she came back, years later, with no idea what happened or what her kids had been through, she was just… a person. A person
"Hey! That's my-" Dean spluttered as he glanced up. A pair of deep blue eyes greeted his with such intensity, like Dean just hung the moon or some shit.
He trudged his way to the counter and, with utter confidence, he ordered his usual. “Um, yeah, I’ll just, ah, wait, shoot. There goes my wallet. Hang on, let me just- oh fu-! My bad ma’am. Could I actually get some paper towel? It seems to be quite the difficulty ordering coffee!” He tried to make light of things, but it just ended with more embarrassment when met with the barista’s silence. He swayed nervously, and sighed. “Just give me a vanilla latte. Small, or tall, or whatever.”
"Really? You planned a surprise night of stargazing just for platonic fun?" Either Dean knew the implications of this, or Cas had been very wrong in judging normal best friend behavior.
The entire way home, he never let go of his angel's hand. Not when they crossed the parking lot, and not when they nearly ran through the bunker in front of Sam. Not between silent gasps and open-mouthed kisses, and not when they fell asleep to whispered promises of forever.
He looked over at Dean, but the boy was pointedly staring down at his desk and absentmindedly rubbing the back of his neck, chagrined.
He half-smiled and retorted, “Hey that lady was not sweet. You should have seen the evil eye she shot me. As far as you know, she deserved it.” He gave a menacing eye raise. If freckles wanted to play this game, then so be it. Castiel could flirt, too, right? Social interaction couldn’t be that difficult.
Twenty minutes into class, and Castiel was already finding the tiles on the ceiling more appealing than Mr. Shurley's lesson on derivatives.
Fruit Loops exploded everywhere, as Dean struggled to stand up. His efforts were in vain, however, as the guy pinned him to the tile floor. What had he done to deserve this? All he wanted was a nice night alone, before this ridiculous guy came along and got sugar cereal stuck in his hair.
“Vanilla latte for Castiel.” A voice from behind the counter interrupted their reverie. He jerked up, not realizing how much he had gravitated toward the worker.
Dean babbled incoherently as he tried to gather himself, "I'm- you're- you're the one who ran down the fucking aisle!"
"Dean, they don't fit." Castiel looked utterly offended as he glared at the 2XL sized gloves. "How am I supposed to wear these?"
"Hey! Hey, what the hell, man?!" The guy stopped to smirk just long enough for Dean to accidentally plow right into him, knocking them into a cereal display.
"Maybe we should continue this elsewhere." Dean grinned brightly at that suggestion, eager to leave the crowded clothing store.
His stupid, strong, calloused hands, Dean noted upon further examination. As his eyes wandered upward, he noticed the toned, yet lean muscle of his upper arm, leading up to his perfect soft pink lips. He paused there for a moment, reveling in the idea of what they would feel like against his own. Wait, what the hell was Dean thinking? This guy just tried to steal his pie! Goddammit Winchester, pull it together. There's no time for attractive men with eyes like the fucking ocean and wild sex hair, if they're out to ruin his Friday night.
The only nickname that had really stuck throughout his childhood had been 'Cassie' by his siblings, notably Gabriel. While he didn't hate it, he much preferred this.
“I really didn’t mean to.” He shrugged his shoulders sheepishly and examined the floor’s tile patterns.
“I didn’t take you for the flirtatious type.” Cas swore it was the trick of the light, but it looked like the other man was blushing. “And besides, this is just the start of a long narrow road for her.”
His hands were beautiful. Callouses dotted his finger pads, and cracks connected them like constellations. They looked strong and had so much character. He envisioned what kind of work lead to them. Landscaping, perhaps? Maybe carpentry or auto repair.
Perplexed, he stared at the sheet, until he realized- oh. Dean was passing him a note. Perhaps, he needed assistance understanding the math.
“Name?” The employee glanced up uneventfully as he waved someone over to clean the mess. The woman whose drink he spilt gave him a side-eye so abhorrent you’d think he’d knocked the whole damn coffeemaker on her. The dark-haired man thought about apologizing but instead stood there sullenly, thinking to himself he should’ve gotten a large.
They reached a grassy cliff overlooking the city. The buildings looked like toys from so far away, and it made Cas feel impossibly large. The most remarkable part, however, was the stars.
Before he could get any more carried away, a folded piece of paper made its way to his side of the desk. Dean's expression was unreadable.
His heart trembled when he thought about the world that hid from him. After reading countless tales of hearing one's heartbeat, or listening to silent breaths of confessions, he couldn't get enough of the possibilities. He dreamed of sound, and all that it could offer. He imagined singing was an ink splattering, and whispers were the cracks between the bricks on a wall. Yelling was, of course, fireworks that lit up the sky and demanded attention. His favorite fantasy though, was the 'I love you's.' Those were the soft reassurance of pillows.
Cas broke apart before it could get any further. He breathed raggedly. "This isn't just platonic fun anymore, right?"
"That-That's my pie." What was supposed to be forceful came out closer to a squeak as Dean tried to steal it back from the guy's hands.
He knew he didn't have a tattoo-couldn't, really-because listening to his soulmate's voice just wasn't in the cards for him. It would have been so much easier if the markings had been, like, a picture of his match, or something.
The barista continued, his face becoming more animated as he talked, “Ooh! A revenge plot! What’d she do? Take your cat? Steal the last handicapped parking spot?” He chuckled to himself, and Castiel allowed a full-blown grin. One-upping the light-haired man would be easy.
"However, you have to catch it, first." Before Dean could process any of what he said, Blue Eyes was sprinting down the aisle toward the cash registers.
Dean couldn't believe it. The last pecan pie sat there waiting just for him. After a long day at the auto shop, he drove straight to the grocery store still in his mechanic uniform, grease and all. He couldn't wait to marathon Dr. Sexy with a mouthful of his favorite dessert. He bounced down the aisle with a stupid grin on his face, ready to grab it, when another hand reached for it first.
Apart from the huff of an elderly man, an encroaching silence stretched among the café. He supposed it could have gone worse.
That was okay, right? This shouldn't be too hard. Just... Communicate like a normal person. This was especially problematic, seeing as Cas was definitely the opposite of that.
, he thought. This pick-me-up was seriously needed if he was going to push through grading his grad students’ finals.
As Sex Hair was further explaining his point, Dean made a grab for the pie. Unfortunately, the man was too quick, and held it behind him. He backed toward the freezer section adjacent to the pies, as Dean tried to reach around him.
He waited for what seemed like hours, but eventually, a strong arm wrapped around his torso and squeezed.
"Hm, what kind of ice cream do you think would go best with this pie? I was thinking chocolate, but, then again, I've always loved the taste of vanilla." Nope, he did not need
Carefully sidestepping the puddle of liquid, he cautiously advanced to the younger looking man dutifully mopping the catastrophe. As he cleaned, Castiel noticed the freckles spattering his cheek bones, and how every arm movement accentuated his muscles. He hadn’t even begun to apologize, and his face was already heating up. Wonderful. Castiel told himself it was from embarrassment, and not the striking flecks of green in the man’s eyes.
"You're really cute when you're flustered, Dean. I couldn't help myself. And I would also really enjoy hanging out with you." Cas beamed, and it was all Dean could do not to kiss him then and there.
Cas tried to appear placid. He rested his chin in his left palm and let his right dangle at his side. Even with his relaxed posture, he was sure his face gave away his mental freakout.
Castiel didn't put much stock into soulmates. He couldn't fathom why such a plethora of people would rely so heavily on the concept. The tattoos appear from
Dean struggled not to fumble like an awkward teenager as he spoke, "Dude, no! Give me the damn pie." He reached around his back, but the guy backed into the freezer door, trapping the pie.
Alright, Dean and Cas are now staring at each other. They’ve clearly forgotten that Sam is literally right here,
Dean is in the middle of a heated argument with Ketch (stupid British bastard) when Cas flies in, much to his relief. It’s always good to see Cas, especially right
Cas wonders what he should do now, but who is he kidding? There’s only one person he really wants to see, a beautiful man who he trusts to take care of him. For better or worse, Cas is utterly in love with Dean Winchester. Somewhere along the way, between the tender looks and the stupid jokes, Cas had fallen for him. Maybe it was because of how genuine Dean is, and kind, even though he acts so tough. Well for whatever reason, Cas had recklessly committed himself to loving Dean- wholly and unconditionally. He doesn’t care that Dean makes mistakes (who doesn’t?) and he doesn’t care that Dean will never feel the same way (well, maybe that part hurts, just a tiny bit). Anyway, no matter how one-sided Cas' love is, Cas still knows that if he asks for Dean's help, he'll be there.
out of his league. That thought almost makes Dean back off, because Cas really does deserve better, but he freakin
at him Cas! We hate him, remember?” he snaps, feeling a little betrayed (and no, he’s definitely not overreacting).
“I’m sorry Dean.” He doesn’t even sound remotely apologetic. “But I don’t need to be ‘fixed’ (bless that idiot and his
Dean can’t help thinking about how, even though the whole panty thing is just an impossible fantasy for him, there’s someone else who might get to have Cas like that. Someone who definitely does not deserve him. He grits his teeth, his stomach twisting uncomfortably.
“Hey, Rowena,” Sam says. Dean can only hear one side of the conversation, but he can more or less guess at Rowena’s responses.
They corner her in an alley and Cas starts closing in, angel blade in hand. Good thing Dean is an awesome hunter, so he’s 100% focused on the task at hand. Yep. And he’s absolutely
He hears someone’s throat clear behind him and whips around to see none other than his gigantic brother ruining the moment. Typical.
Cas glares at him, blushing harder than ever for some reason. “I wrote a letter. To… someone…” he mumbles hesitantly.
. Dean, of course, entirely misinterprets this silence, steps even closer, and starts unbuttoning Cas’ shirt for him. Cas stares at him, heart thumping so loud he’s sure the goddamn King of Hell can hear it. He vaguely wonders why Dean’s hands are trembling. Then the door bangs open and Sam comes in with the medical supplies, sees Dean undressing Cas, and freezes. A smirk slowly spreads across Sam’s face and he raises his eyebrows at Dean, who in turn blushes furiously and glares daggers at his brother. Cas looks between them, confused.
But not even the stars could keep his attention right then. Every minute or so, he couldn't help but sneak glances at Dean. Every time, his face was unreadable.
Castiel intended to swiftly get his coffee and return to his office without any additional obstacles. It seemed the universe had other plans. Since none of the roads were plowed, driving proved an immense difficulty. Not only that, but there was an accident on the road he takes to his usual place, so he was forced to settle for an alternate further away. But dammit, he was going to get his latte if the world depended on it.
"Then why did you make me destroy all this cereal?!" Dean squirmed under Cas trying to get up again, to no avail. He finally gave in, and searched Cas' eyes for answers.
That must have been the end of the conversation because Dean's pen was nowhere in sight, and he was turning back to the front of the room.
"If I run into a tree, it's all your fault," Cas deadpanned and squeezed Dean's hand tighter. Hopefully, the other teen would chalk it up to nerves.
"Sorry." He closed his mouth and shifted positions, so his left arm was barely an inch from Cas' right arm, but not touching. Never touching.
So, he sat. He focused on breathing evenly, and only spoke to point out constellations. Dean somehow thought they all looked like food.
"Maybe- maybe that would be a good idea." He barely managed a whisper, fearing the outcome of his voice if he were any louder.
After a few minutes of utter silence, a warm arm pressed up against his. Cas immediately stilled and waited for Dean to shift or pull away. Nothing happened.
With a chuckle, Castiel shuffled outside with a new sense of optimism. A childlike grin spread across his face, and he thought that maybe today wouldn’t be so bad.
After what felt like only seconds later, they broke apart panting and blotchy. He failed to notice he was gripping Cas' hand like his life depended on it.
, laying stagnant on your arm, and, yet, everyone is so apt to become a slave to the string of words. Sure, it'd be nice to find someone with compatibility guaranteed, but c'mon. It couldn't be all that it's cracked up to be. Maybe he was bitter because he grew up without a mark, or maybe because he couldn't hear his soulmate, even if he had one.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and looked down. "I just, um, know how much you enjoy all that astronomy shit, and I thought Kansas looked okay for once from up here. I mean, if it's too cold or whatever, we can go. Actually, yeah, this was a really stupid idea. I don't know what I was thinking, you're probably not even-"
This time they kissed intensely; years of tension and passion boiled over, exposing itself among their lips. Their tongues danced around each other, and Dean sighed into his mouth.
"That's great, but I would really appreciate it if I could stand up, and get these damn fruit loops off me."
While he was scurrying out of the shop, the other man called back, “Tell me how that whole revenge thing goes! If you end up killing her, I’ll help you hide the body.”
“I wasn’t-” He furrowed his brows and crossed his arms crisply. It was only then that he realized how disheveled he probably looked.
"Just a few more steps, I promise. And don't you dare think about peeking. That blindfold ain't there just to look pretty." The blonde-haired teen tugged at the other boy's hand and briskly lead him through the woods. The smell of moss drifted through the air.
"Dean, this is very inappropriate behavior to be displaying at a grocery store. I might have a mind to call the manager on you."
Just as his face turned back to a normal shade and his pulse slowed down enough to breathe, a warm hand brushed the back of his, and all his attempts at remaining calm were shot to hell. He glanced under the table just as Dean threaded their pinkies together. His hand was soft and pliable, in contrast to its appearance. Castiel quickly got with the program and curled his finger around the other teenager's.
Dean swallows, rubs Cas' cheek with his thumb. "Stay with me," he rasps. "I don't think deserve it but- I want you here. I want you to wanna be here, I-" He laughs, choked- "I should've asked you years ago, but… I'm askin' now. Stay with me, Cas. We can stay here, or go somewhere else, I don't care just… I'm done pretending my life isn't better with you in it."
Tearing his hand away from his face he looks at the ground, hunting for tracks on the grimy tarmac as if his baby brother’s another monster on the run. Not that he’s expecting anything that obvious- Sammy’s smart, smarter than him and fast, too. He could be on a bus and out of the goddamn state by now.
“Good, thank you,” says Cas, but he catches Dean with a hand on his shoulder before he can go far. “And Dean?”
“I think I’ll know, somehow. When you’re thinking of me.” He flicks a thumb across Dean’s eyebrow, following the shape of it, like he’s learning his face through touch. “But maybe you could tell me, talk to me. Just in case.”
Dean smiles, and rubs the back of the fussy, formerly godlike toddler whimpering into his shirt. “C’mon, kiddo,” he whispers, gently tucking Jack’s face and sensitive eyes into the crook of his neck as they step into the brighter light of the hallway. “It’s
Sam and Ketch both shoot him unimpressed looks. Dean cringes. (Ok, yeah, not his best, but he’s worked up.)
. Because of Dean. He leans in. “Hey Cas?” he whispers. “Um… you- me too. You, you know, also- for me…” Fucking
Dean looks at the open sincerity and affection on his face and his breath catches in his throat. Then he
They stare at each other for a moment, until Dean can’t hold back his burning question anymore. “So,” he starts, going for casual (and missing by a mile). “You’re, uh, taken now? I mean, can you ever get laid? Or will an army of djinn attack you for, you know, adultery and high treason?”
Cas frowns in thought, but after several long moments, his eyes widen comically. Then, just as quickly, he’s scowling and snapping his head towards Ketch. (Oh yeah, Ketch.)
Sammy immediately starts snickering because he’s a dick and Dean really should’ve just left on the side of the road a long time ago. “What are you, a 13 year old girl, Dean?”
Dean softens against his will. He sighs, “Look, Cas, I’m not mad at you, alright? You just- you can’t go off marrying strangers every chance you get.”
“Of course, Samuel,” she grins as she eyes Dean and Cas, standing a little too close (but it’s not like that’s unusual). Rowena lowers her voice to a very loud, very audible whisper, and tells Sam “You know, if I were you, I think I’d invest in an additional motel room.” And with a smirk and a puff of smoke, she’s gone. Dramatic friggin’
looking for you in Purgatory. He could have gotten out, remember? He didn’t even know if you’d be able to go home with him, and he still wouldn’t leave you for anything. No offence man, but
his thumb over Cas’ cheekbone. “My, I do enjoy an angel,” he drawls. “And such a pretty one, at that.”
Dean freezes, wondering if he heard the angel correctly. If he wasn’t jealous before, he fucking is now.
Dean has decided to simply stop looking at his best friend. What he doesn’t know can’t hurt him, right?
Maybe they’ll stay out by the lake all day, whiling away the hours just soaking up the air and each other, sunrise to sunset. Then they might come back here right away, eat with Sam and Eileen and whoever else they can rustle up, or maybe they’ll go grab dinner somewhere, or get take-out and check out that new drive-in movie theatre he’s been seeing flyers for. Maybe Jack will be hopped up on fresh air and soda and wide awake for the whole movie- or maybe he’ll doze off in the previews and Dean can stop pretending he isn’t more interested in looking at Cas than whatever dumb leftover Christmas flick is up on the screen.
His eyes open just a crack, peering at Dean across the pillow and the messy crown of Jack's mousy hair.
But they barely made it out alive. Against all odds, they’re here. Together. And they’ve wasted enough time already.
and is now Dean's son. The fact that his other dad is Cas, former angel of the Lord, Dean's best friend and now… Boyfriend? God, no, dumb word. His
any goddamn thing in the world for this kid to have it better than I did. Have a good life. Have the confidence to stick up for himself, go his own way.”
It doesn’t take long for the conversation to devolve from there, Sammy dropping his case about Dean’s mysterious power in favour of playful insults, but Dean keeps turning the penny over in his fingers, feeling the smooth, pristine surface with hands smoothed of all their past cuts and callouses. New coin, new hands, new start. Kinda. New start to fuck up everything again in a new, more spectacular way than before.
and the weirdest thing about it is it doesn't feel weird. None of it. Jack fits in his arms like he was meant to be there, Cas' lips fit with his like they were made for it, and it may be a squeeze but the three of them sharing space in Dean's bed feels natural.
Cas' eyes flicker up to him, and Dean fights the impulse to look away and pretend he wasn't staring. Cas' eyes are soft and sleepy, and still just a little uncertain, like he's waiting for Dean to turn him out of the room. Maybe he's just worried Dean's gonna spiral again. Either way, Dean doesn't like it.
“I brought you coffee!” Jack cuts in, pointing at the bedside table (or the cardboard box currently serving as one) and- huh, yeah, that’s a mug of coffee, still steaming. Probably made by Sam, since it’s in the mug he bought Dean as a joke a few weeks after he and Cas became ‘official’. The one that says ‘Mr. Right’; meaning Cas probably has the matching ‘Mrs. Always Right’ one waiting on his side of the bed.
to make, on behalf of a man who seldom entertains wishes for his own sake. A man who scarcely believes himself worthy of life, let alone pleasure, let alone peace or plenty.
It’s kinda hard to think, when Cas looks at him like that. Waxes lyrical about humanity and then looks at Dean like he’s the ultimate culmination of it. But he manages a follow-up question, after some fidgeting and throat clearing. “So, uh. You didn’t get their new names Johnny Mnemonic'd in the mega download, then?”
way a little, first. He’ll submit to the mortifying ordeal of being singled out for affectionate humiliation once he’s clocked some time with Cas and the kid, doing something he wants to do. Something peaceful, relaxing, maybe something that gets them out into the fresh air...
“Well, the birthday boy sure ain’t waiting round here for people to start singing,” he says. Sam’s probably already put in calls to whoever’s in the neighbourhood to show up for an ambush, and Dean’s down for seeing some friends but he wants to do this day
No good response to that. How the hell do you explain you're too chickenshit; so goddamn scared of your own feelings that you can't bring yourself to touch your best friend until you're convinced it's your last chance? Dean nods tightly. "Yeah."
He breaks the kiss, presses his forehead into Cas’, willing him not to pull away with no hands free to hold him in place. Cas deserves eye contact for this but Dean keeps his closed for now, too overwhelmed by all the thoughts fighting to escape and getting caught in a bottleneck, but there’s one that
He does find the things a lot. He never really thought about it, ‘till Sam pointed it out, but all through his life, at some of his lowest moments, the coins have always been there. Sometimes just pennies, sometimes quarters or dimes- once even a goddamn silver dollar, the kind they don’t even make anymore. All of them shiny and new. Sometimes showing up right when he needed it; when he needed the cash, when he needed to stop and look at his surroundings, once at exactly the moment he needed to
to come out now before he chickens out and pushes it down again and it’s bursting through the blockade like a goddamn wrecking ball-
Cas takes a thoughtful sip of coffee, still half-asleep. “I believe, traditionally, that is a choice for the ‘birthday boy’ to make,” he says, fingers twitching to shape the air quotes around his coffee mug.
Though it’s undoubtedly the song that does most of the work, Castiel likes to think his presence has some impact. Dean Winchester does not trust easily, and to not only fall asleep beside Castiel but pressed close to him, almost on top of him…
“Yeah, just gimme a sec, I’m…” Dean blinks, catching up to the kid’s train of thought- and to the fact that he’s holding a small wrapped object in his hands. “Jack, you didn’t have to get me somethin’.”
He may be a coward, but Cas’ eyes crinkle up in amusement so at least he’s an entertaining one. Cas takes pity on his awkward ass, though, and turns his attention back to Jack and the conversation back to practicalities. “Three listed parents will raise eyebrows, especially if two are brothers. But unfortunately even two parents won’t be welcome everywhere if they’re the same sex. Perhaps Jack’s best chance at a ‘normal’ life is with Sam and Eileen. Or a single parent, even if we’re all involved in his upbringing unofficially.”
a coin so bright, like it’s never been touched. It was practically hollering at him from the ground, begging to be picked up. He wonders why no one else had already.
, anymore. All the times I’ve lost you, it’s- it’s the closest I’ve ever come to… somethin’ stupid.”
not leaving you, buddy. Just moving a little, ‘kay? Here.” He carefully shifts, making sure Jack is well supported on one arm (with a little help from Cas), and raises his hand, clenched in a loose fist with his little finger extended. “Pinky swear.”
love me, and it wasn’t ‘til Mom died that things got bad and he started…” his throat works, a lump lodged in there he can barely force air past. “I don’t think you’d trust me with Jack if you could see me when you’re gone. If you’re not here with me-”
But, thankfully, not so tired that he can’t appreciate the little things. Like sneaking salt into Sam’s coffee when he’s distracted and watching his brother’s entire face screw up in disgust. Or the great tunes crackling from Baby’s cassette player as the two of them perch on her hood, eating their crappy fast food while they watch the sunset and mull over their plan of attack for tonight.
Cas smiles, eyes glistening in the low light, and hell if it doesn't put the 'happiest moment of his life' smile to shame.
“I love you,” he says again, experimentally. It comes out smoother the second time. The words still feel foreign on his tongue, tripping over awkwardly, but it feels… good. Feels
He’s twenty-nine (or a little under one, if you count the day he hauled himself outta the grave as a re-birthday), and he’s tired. So goddamn tired.
Cas looks at his hand on Dean's face, contemplative. "You've touched me like this. Several times now."
Every moment they share is brief. Every conversation, every look, every touch. In the grand scheme of the universe, in the course of Castiel’s long lifetime, each precious moment he shares with Dean is shorter than the blink of an eye; and yet each contains, crystallised, a shard of infinity, glittering like the dewdrops on the grass beneath their feet, or the ancient stars above their heads.
Sammy’s gone, took off again. A goddamn eleven year old kid out alone on the streets. If Dean doesn’t find him, if he goes back to the shitty motel they’re calling home without him, back to
He’s forty-two and sitting between two nerds who love him more than they should, and one of those nerds is his three year old kid and also a grown man and also God, and the other one is his best friend and the love of his life and a man and a former angel.
“Let’s get you to bed, okay?” Dean murmurs, shuffling about as he gets ready to stand. “Been a big day.”
