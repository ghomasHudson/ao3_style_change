“I’m sure it isn’t the first time your precious office has been sullied like that.”
“That means you’ve got ten seconds to back out,” John informed him, sitting up straighter and thrilling as the detective approached him.
"Could you...uh...put your fingers just..." John went quiet, flushed through embarrassment as well as exertion, and took Sherlock's languid hand, guiding it down and encouraging him to grip his backside as he began rapidly stroking himself with delicious liquid noises. He prodded the wet tip of his cock hopefully against the smooth, sticky skin of the detective's belly.
"I don't want to be the fucking
The detective laughed, his face beginning to exhibit a gorgeous, telling blush. Swallowing self-consciously, he settled back a little bit, reaching behind him to take hold of John's prick. He nudged it pointedly against his own backside, raising a querying eyebrow.
He had no idea what this could be, was trying to figure it out but was coming up with nothing. It was worrying. Fingers shaking slightly, Sherlock reached into the stained mug for the last cookie, took a deep breath, and opened it.
Sherlock looked at it and then rolled his eyes, “The fountain pen,” he said, flicking the empty thing aside without a second thought. It bounced off the wall and was lost somewhere under the bed.
It came as a shock, then, when the very tip of Sherlock's finger glided inside, a teasing pressure, coaxing John to open and then withdrawing. John sighed, muscles he hadn't realized were locked easing. He groaned, his long-lashed eyes fluttering shut as Sherlock slowly, gently, acquaintanced himself with his insides, his own eyes wide and rapt as he stroked along John’s inner walls.
Except...
"You knew..." Shaun breathed. "You knew it wasn't loaded...the whole time...you cock." He dropped down onto his hands and rolled onto his back, giving John a lazy, satisfied look. "Fuck that was incredible."
Something warm and delicious curled in Sherlock's chest. "Can I do it again?"
John almost sobbed with relief, laughing giddily against his bedmate's supple mouth before he arched into the kiss, one of his hands already having surged deep into Sherlock's crisp curls, kneading happily.
"What-?" The rest of Sherlock's sentence was cut off as John pressed angry lips against his, snogging him breathlessly in front of the entire pub and his friends. Sherlock's eyes went wide in shock and he tried to pull away but John's fingers knotted themselves in his hair, refusing to let him.
"Yes." Sherlock whispered- the idea of John taking him, fucking him, making him impossibly harder. He impatiently pushed his cock against John, grunting eagerly as John kissed him. And John was agreeing, was going along with it. John was going to fuck him. Sherlock's head spun. Would he do it here- on the floor of the sitting room? Sherlock on his back, his legs wrapped around John's waist while John thrust into him? Sherlock could almost feel the way the carpet would scrape across his back, leaving stinging burns that would only heighten the pleasure. He kissed John back, as hard as he could, hips moving faster against him, frotting against him fervently.
The small room was filled with his co-workers, most of whom had a salad or sandwich in front of them, sipping diet drinks and water, and all conversation died as soon as John walked through the door, leaving an oppressive, uncomfortable silence.
! I-" Sherlock shouted as his orgasm suddenly hit, body jerking and bucking beyond his control. He sobbed weakly as his cock twitched, come pulsing out in a feeble trickle to spatter against his stomach.
"You still randy?"
Still riding on glorious tides of endorphins, John settled into a lazy, but attentive, rhythm of small, curled fingers on the taller man's shaft, staring at it with hazy, and grateful eyes, thankful that Sherlock was, for once, not trying to hide himself.
"Oh...wow...that's...very good," John managed, before whining in panic, finding himself suddenly on the brink of a monumental climax. "Sherlock...I'm gonna come...ah, fuck," he whispered, trying to force himself over the edge, panting exhaustedly.
"……Sure. I can do that. Of course. Need anything else?"
Sherlock stared up at John, surprised, angry, and more than a bit turned on at being so thoroughly outmanoeuvred by the ex-army doctor. He jerked at his wrists, testing the bonds, and moaned in pleasure when they held. Of course they held- John had been the one to tie the knot. And in classic John-style: not too tight, nothing to cause Sherlock pain, but just enough to hold him firmly. Sherlock knew, from previous experience, that he wouldn't be able to escape until John released him.
John grabbed him before he could spin away and, apparently, kick John from his room. "I'm not going to laugh." He said, eyes dropping once more to the evidence in front of him. "I think...Yeah, that's one of the hottest things I've ever seen."
He sucked in a sticky, laboured breath and distractedly blinked sweat and lingering tears from his pale eyes, gritting his teeth in anxious anticipation as John drizzled more lube onto the toy and rubbed it around the shaft with delicious intent. John shifted back on his knees and easily slipped the vibrator back Into Sherlock's hole, shivering at how easy he had taken it, before flipping it back on and leaning forward to take Sherlock's cock in his mouth.
Greg shrugged. "Eh. Not too great. I knew what I was getting into when I let Elaine set me up with her friend. Blind dates always turn out the same." He chugged some of his beer and sighed, giving John a mischievous look. "You always end up with either the dull woman out of her flat for the first time in ages or the unapproachable ice queen who lets you know you're miles beneath her. Guess which one I ended up with?"
"No, thank you, I'm perfectly healthy enough to go on this case."
Following his small chuckle with a look at his watch, Greg turned back to John still smiling.
At all.
It wasn't too far to the pet store, which, according to Sherlock's speedy background check, had unusually late opening hours, sometimes staying open till 9pm. Could be important. He was sifting efficiently through some slim but detailed files in his Mind Palace regarding commercially available hybrid spider breeds, when he was disturbed by a slightly-stubbled kiss on his knuckles, followed by a cheeky sequel on his jaw, accompanied by a soft, smiling huff of breath.
"Yes, I am. Come on, Sherlock, it’s 5 in the morning. Just...turn back over and hold me so we can both go to sleep."
"Just...go out and mollify Molly." Sherlock hissed, opening the door and grabbing John by the shoulder, shoving him outside and locking the door behind him.
Sherlock snuggled closer to John, sealing their bodies warmly together, and sighed contentedly. He was tired. Exhausted. He felt that, for once, he could immediately drift off to sleep.
Sherlock's body had immediately slumped against the bed when the toy was removed but his cock, blood red and swollen, still twitched between his legs with every beat of his heart. He whined quietly at the feeling of still being aroused, of yet another orgasm curled tightly in his abdomen, demanding to be released. He hadn't known it was possible to get aroused so soon after having an orgasm, hadn't known his body was capable of it, and it both thrilled and terrified him. He trusted John to make it better, though.
have to get off."
“I haven’t had sex in nearly a year!”
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" He hissed while Sherlock rolled his eyes up at him and kept sucking, swirling his tongue around John's thickening cock.
"Sherl...Sh...Near..." John's words deteriorated into harsh curses, the viciousness of their integrity making itself known via a violent snarl and a few telling, sharp thrusts of John's hips as he neared his orgasm. The headboard of the bed knocked noisily against the wall with the power of John's animalistic thrusts. He jammed his cock between Sherlock's thighs one last time and stilled, gasping in a high breath, before moaning. Warmth seeped against Sherlock's skin and dripped down onto his stomach as John came, his semen splattering against Sherlock's pale skin.
"Death by sex...there are worse ways to go," John pondered, nuzzling aside dark tendrils of fringe and smooching Sherlock's heated forehead.
"Sherlock, I don't believe you. If you're trying to sway me with morbid histories, you'll have to give me some proof." John replied to these morbid deductions, lugging their bags through the slightly sideways doorway of their hotel room. The room was about as passable as could be expected for a dirt-cheap, temporary residence- the wallpaper was hideous, the bed looked lumpy, and there were dubious stains on the carpeting that John didn't want to contemplate and which Sherlock looked all too aware of what had caused them.
?" He asked, before pulling John by his belt-hooks into one of the grubby cubicles and locking the door, but something in his voice gives John pause. "I can't take all the credit."
“That collar is years old and digging into its neck. It’s practically ingrown. I don’t care if it belongs to someone. That ‘someone’ is clearly negligent. Bring it inside.”
"Want to tell me what this is all about?" He asked, leaning forward so Sherlock could hear him and their conversation would stay private. "I would've thought after solving the case you would've been...happier."
Sherlock, curled into a tight ball on the sofa in his PJs, heard the front door open barely half an hour later. He was surprised John was back so soon. He'd expected his boyfriend- flatmate? were they even together now?- to stay at the pub with Greg, drinking and joking and probably making fun of him behind his back.
He could see Sherlock's excitement ramping up exponentially by the fact that he was only getting hints of what he was actually doing under the covers. The imagination was one of the greatest sexual tools, after all.
Staring daggers at the Irishman, Sherlock was startled by John's warm breath at his right ear, whispering comfortingly to him, as quietly as he could in order for the detective to hear him above the yells, clinks of dozens of glasses, and piped classic rock music of the pub. "Are you alright, sweetheart?"
Sherlock cringed down in discomfort and smiled at John meekly with a short laugh of his own, “
Sherlock pulled a face that was half-grimace and half-smirk, his pale features crinkling delightfully, his sharp cheekbones stained a wonderful rosy pink.
"No." John jerked away, and then sighed, giving Sherlock a half-apologetic stare, half-murderous. "No that's...that's ok. Thank you."
“You’re forgiven in advance.  It’s all good. Please…feel free to continue.”
"You watch it all the time."
"That I'm a fucking queer!" John hissed at him, quaking with fury as he shoved Sherlock back down flat on the bed with a lot more force and bitterness than he'd intended.
Shaun rolled his eyes, snorting. "Yes, John. Christ, you're worse than my last boyfriend. My arse is all yours, dear. If you could ream it later, I'd been entirely grateful."
Sherlock laughed, startled, and for the moment pushed the repulsive, horrid thoughts from his mind. He devoted himself to the task of kissing John, sliding his tongue between his lips for John to suck on. This did, however, require further thought.
how I saw my day going when I woke up this morning.”
"Keep your eyes closed." John teased. "You'll get soap in them otherwise."
"No more!" John yelped, scooting further away and glaring. "Not tonight." He shook his head. "I know you want to try that...the uh…the milking. But just...another time, yeah?"
Sherlock raised his head, glanced down, and then let out a noise comprised of frustration and utter lust as he watched John’s ash-brown hair tickle his pale thigh. Letting his head fall back, he panted, closing his eyes and suddenly shuddering hard, before going relatively calm again.
"You weren't able to engage in the kinky types of sexual activity he wanted-" Sherlock blinked, derailed in his deductions, and swivelled his head to stare at John. "You weren't damaged. He...He shouldn't have...I'm glad he left you."
John had long known that, as he got older, his refractory period had got longer and longer. In his teens and twenties, he'd been able to get hard as often as he wanted, whenever and wherever, without a thought. Now, in his late thirties, twice in one day left him totally knackered but he'd not really cared about it, never felt stymied by it.
"What?" John asked, glancing up from testing the warmth of the water, brow furrowing.
John laughed, rummaging one languid hand through Sherlock's beautiful curls. "Sometimes I'll need to get off by myself, sweetheart."
John glared at him from beneath lowered brows. "That won't be enough- Sherlock!" He yelped as Sherlock tried twisting away from him, managing to slide his slick hand along his own shaft once before Sherlock sank onto the head of his cock.
Sherlock pulled an inadvertent, irritated face, casting his icy eyes upon his doctor. Wincing against a rogue spear of sunlight, which was struggling to shake off the bland, blank dawn, Sherlock sighed, as if put-upon, and leant down beside his sleeping lover. He gave him a long, yet chaste kiss, before swallowing audibly. "Love you, John. If I don't come back, then...well...I guess that's that," he chuckled quietly. "But know that I care for you. Beyond belief. And...I really hope to come back, because...I would miss you...so much."
"You know what I mean. I'm just saying, I wouldn't fancy my chances with him. Like
The man loomed over Sherlock, a forkful of meat in his hand and a leery smile on his face.
"You looked overwhelmed. You looked like you were at breaking point. Utter desperation. There were tears in your eyes. I...I know that's not good, but...it...I liked it," Sherlock admitted quietly. As he finished speaking, he extended one spidery hand to the bedcovers, ready to peel them back and get an eyeful.
"John? I can't wait much longer." Sherlock admitted throatily.
"Are you all right, Mr. Holmes?" He'd asked, eyes trailing down Sherlock's body and Sherlock nodded, flushing. "Well, it's a very lucky bloke you've purchased all these lovely things for." Chaucer winked and Sherlock had been glad John was outside and hadn't seen. "Your bit of rough has probably never handled silk before. Make sure he knows it needs to be treated…gently."
The doctor adjusted himself a little better under Sherlock’s surprisingly heavy weight, and pulled in a grateful lungful of warm, dirty-tasting, comforting London air as a lazy breeze sluggishly managed its way through the open window into the stuffy bedroom.
John’s grin widened as he continued to speak to his flatmate. “Since you’re incapacitated, I’m going to talk at you for a bit, is that okay?”
With the tiniest flick of a thumb inside his trouser pocket, Sherlock activated the wire he was wearing, a signal that this man was a potential suspect.
"No, no. it's…fine. Um…do it again." Sherlock uttered awkwardly, his cheekbones blooming a delicious, rosy pink. John smirked and reached for Sherlock again and Sherlock watched those hands, so skilled in so many ways, come closer and closer. He stared down at them as they came up and framed his face, going almost cross-eyed to keep them in his line of sight as they cupped his cheeks, rough and warm against his skin. John's thumb brushed over Sherlock's cheekbone and only years and years of pride kept Sherlock from arching into the contact. His throat went dry at the sensation, a hot fluttering swooping and diving through his chest as John slowly leaned closer...and closer... Sherlock's eyes widening the closer he got.
“Come on, you wouldn’t know rudeness if it smacked you in the face. Besides, you know I’m right,” John teased, as he slowly pulled off his own underwear and lay back with a teasing grin. Sherlock was going to take him, and John liked it rough, therefore an angry Sherlock was entirely conducive to his needs.
As John replied, Sherlock undid his own shirt as quickly as his long, dextrous fingers could manage. "John...I can't wait, take everything off. Now," he panted beautifully.
And, for his part, Sherlock didn't seem to mind.
"Because it means that
Adjusting his grip, spreading Sherlock even wider, John dipped his head and licked a swipe directly across Sherlock's hole. It clenched beneath his tongue, opening and relaxing before returning to its original state, and a fine trembling began in Sherlock's legs.
Violently shaking with a series of wanton thrusts, Sherlock shifted with a low, fervent grunt, and the next push of his mouth to John’s neck was followed by a sucking bite. Abruptly possessive and eager, he bruised and marked John as they slipped dangerously on the edge of the creaking bed, and John became instantly aware of the hard, hot, twitching shape of Sherlock’s erection as it was dragged up his hip.
“So…wanna go out with me?”
“I rather think I live dangerously enough already.”
"Oh John. I'm overcome. Your place or mine?" Greg laughed, slapping John warmly on the arm.
"Thank you." He explained when Sherlock stared in bewilderment at him. "I needed to get out of the hotel for a while." He offered Sherlock a smile before tugging him forward and slotting their lips together.
There was a loud metallic clatter as Sherlock dropped his cutlery, the fork bouncing off the table and landing somewhere out of sight. The tinkling crash was almost drowned out by Sherlock's shaky grunt of desperation, his ordinarily talented hands scrabbling weakly, and without familiarity, at John's nape.
"Because, believe it or not, I actually
"Do I know you?" Sherlock asked coolly, rapidly trying to remember where-
He lubed his cock up quickly, before lining up and plunging inside in one quick thrust. He seized Shaun's throat, squeezing to compress his trachea, and the brunette gasped airlessly, putting up a token struggle just to feel how fruitless it was. John gripped him, hauling Shaun up close to his chest. He fumbled for a split second- Shaun shuddered- then pressed the barrel of the gun once again between Shaun's lips.
John moaned around Sherlock's cock, slicking two fingers with the residual lube he could feel around Sherlock's arse before pressing two fingers down to the knuckle inside of him. He moaned again, because Sherlock was so open it would be so easy to just slide himself in there. John took Sherlock deeper into his mouth to the point where he nearly gagged, bringing his head back up and lavishing the tip with his tongue.
"Plotting how to get you naked. Watching you strip. Fucking memorizing every curve." John's hands raked down Sherlock's body, possessive and demanding. "And then wanking that night when he went home, imagining the way you looked that day, fantasizing about you wearing whatever it was you'd bought..."
," John hissed, suckling mindlessly at the base of his lover's neck, relishing the tickle of soft, damp, near-black curls against his face. He nudged a shaky hand from Sherlock's heaving, blood-hot ribcage to his cock, which bobbed happily, as if glad to see him.
Chuckling, ignoring the shuddering detective whose ebony curls were a sweat-soaked, wilted mess upon his overheated, damp skin, John moved to the dresser on Sherlock's side of the bed. Pulling it open, his eyes fell instantly upon the lifeless vibrator.
“…You really believe all that? Or is that just your biggest fear right now?”
It feels rather…nice, Sherlock thought, shivering at the sucking sensations against what was apparently a sensitive area of his body. It felt like what he supposed an octopus's tentacle might feel like as one pulls it away-
To be fair, Sherlock didn't need to be there at all, shopping with him. In fact, John was probably finding it slightly suspicious that he would even choose to accompany him on so mundane a mission when before he’d declared he never wanted to set foot in a store again. The noise. The crowd. The tediousness of it all.
"…Sherlock, you proposed two days ago. And that was just after our anniversary…how long were you thinking about this?"
He stroked Sherlock's cock reverently, not trying to get him hard but realizing he needed the comforting touch. He dipped down further and fondled his sac, carefully rolling his testicles in his hand and feeling Sherlock shake minutely against him. It was only after long minutes of this that John felt the change in Sherlock's body. The growing rigidity. Sherlock canted his hips forward, the movement almost totally obscured by the blanket. John nearly didn't feel it at all.
"Fuck yes." John breathed, flinging out an arm to fumble beside him for lube.
You can get yourself some water. Obviously. The glass is on the desk. Next to the pen. – SH
"…Late?" John repeated, nonplussed. "
benefit, Sherlock, it's for
John let out a small giggle, glad he held his pint so that his hands wouldn't be searching for something to do.
“Mm.” Was Sherlock’s response as he leaned over him a little more, pressing into John’s back with a hush of fabric and a blossom of warmth. “You’re disconcerted by this? Why?”
"God-
John didn't say a word, giving Sherlock's knee a gentle squeeze, before carefully sliding one slickened finger into his arse.
"Shaun."
Sherlock had got nothing done by the time John returned, and was just dreamily reclining on the bed. With endorphin-pumped delight, he twisted his still-flushed face to his doctor, cleared his hoarse, overworked throat, and offered his most endearing, grey-green puppy eyes.
"AH!" Sherlock cried out, spine bowing, and he fumbled to grip his cock, finger clenching at the base implacably. He moaned when John repeated the motion teasingly and a drop of fluid appeared at the tip of his cock.
"Jo...
John hummed, still moving the toy at a slow, measured pace. "I know how much you love fucking me, Sherlock. I don't often let you...but when I do...oh, Christ, it feels
"I..." Sherlock blinked, features contorting in a visage of confusion.
He couldn't even concentrate on what John was saying, what he was asking him. All Sherlock could concentrate on was the slow, agonizing slide of John's hand and his elusive orgasm.
"I haven't even taken these off yet," John laughed, thumbing at his own waistband. "Hang on...you haven't been doing anything...
"More than that." John instructed. "More. Bit more...You're not taking me almost bloody
"You do. I mean...yes, I was having a wank…but it's not because I'm
Wordlessly, John turned to face him, splaying one hand upon Sherlock's belly, whilst the other braced him on luxurious white pillows. He gave him a few small, quick kisses, pulling back each time to enjoy the dizziness in Sherlock's grey-green eyes, though rapidly the kisses became longer, harder, and noisier. It was addicting, like the man himself. John had been addicted from the start.
know it's not appropriate to say things like that in public, Sherlock. To someone's
Sherlock's eyes closed at John's words and he scrabbled at John's body, seeking solace amongst the hot, wet skin and beautiful racing pulse in the arteries of his throat and wrists. "John, you know...I love you? Properly?"
"I...liked you being forceful." Sherlock admitted quietly, sitting back on his heels and staring up at John.
The clink of a plate being set in front of him let Sherlock know John was nearby and suddenly, warm lips pressed against his cheek and a hot, swooping sensation fluttered in his chest.
I’m gonna put this down to too much caffeine and J-pop. XD
," came the sudden, aggressive demand and John quickly leaned down, kissing Sherlock as passionately as he could, trying to pour all his emotions into the kiss. He felt Sherlock tense, then he cried out against John's lips, his muscles clamping down on John's cock as he came, come slicking between them and sending John juddering into his own orgasm, leaving him panting against Sherlock's mouth.
...you beautiful...thing," John whispered, overwhelmed, sweat stinging his eyes and his own muscles shivering from exertion. He pulled out gently, then managed to crawl to lie beside Sherlock, feeling totally shattered.
That was more than enough. With a high-pitched, anguished growl, John bucked hard, squeezing crushingly-tight around Sherlock's finger as he came, squirting the taller man's already-wet stomach with pearls of hot ejaculate. With a gruff, pleased-sounding grunt deep in his chest, Sherlock moved his mouth to John’s and breathed against him, as if sharing in the moment with John, before he kissed him affectionately, stroking him through his orgasm with a flex of his trapped finger and a swipe of his other hand, drawing it up John’s back.
The detective grimaced as if he had tasted something intrinsically poisonous, scowling and folding his arms.
They were doing surgeries at adjacent beds (in far less sterile conditions than he was happy with), and John was ignoring Shaun as best he could, avoiding meeting those big, dark eyes that always seemed to be smiling, even under the most dire circumstances. But the more he resisted, the stronger the temptation became, until it was an infuriating itch that he couldn't scratch without ripping open an artery and dooming himself.
Sherlock shuffled lazily until he was close enough to kiss him, “I’m
"No more of that." He said seriously. "Putting yourself in those situations. I don't think I could take it if something happened to you."
my arse."
are you always pulling away from me? I may be inexperienced but I'm not a child.
"Otherwise why would I stay interested in you?" He asked gently. Sherlock jerked the duvet out of John’s grip and smothered himself in it again, despite the sweltering, sticky London heat. After he had swamped himself totally in the duvet, he wriggled one hand out into John's line of sight, to flounce an 'I'm done with you now’ gesture.
- John to say his name, to prove him wrong that he wasn't thinking of Shaun. Surely...please...he wasn't.
Sherlock coughed quite dramatically as a result of a shocked inhale, and John grinned and patted his broad back in a motion that started as a hefty, masculine fix for a blocked throat, but which ended in a firm, tender rub of the younger man's scapulae.
He was still sitting there, eyes swimming from the pain, when Sherlock pushed his way into the room, a nurse flapping behind him, looking very put-out. Sherlock's eyes immediately found John's and his worried face softened.
“Formalities are a waste of muscle contractions.”
Greg finished his pint and called for another round with a wave of his hand.
“Yes, but not from the people I was actually interested in.”
John smiled. "We'll talk about it later. Right now, how about you hold me for a while?"
." He said, scowling forbiddingly. "It's just for me...and I'm more than willing to see it again," Sherlock added, smirking, ruffling his hair with a hand which had gone slightly numb after leaning on it too long.
"Cuddling you when I'm unconscious really doesn't count as a sexual act of
He didn't want to wake John.
John smiled down at his stunned lover. "What would you like, Sherlock? Would you like a kiss?"
John chuckled, sending tremors through Sherlock's body. "Couldn't you have just deduced it?" He asked, pushing Sherlock's shirt from his shoulders and skimming his hands along the smooth, pale chest in front of him. "It was there...plain as day for you to see. For anyone to have seen, probably. How much I wanted you." John licked at Sherlock's nipple, sucking it into his mouth and laving over and over it with his tongue as Sherlock's already nervous composure began faltering even further.
"Just now. He wore me out." Shaun admitted. "But look, if you still want...find me later. Wouldn't want to disappoint, and you look gutted." He laughed openly, eyes twinkling as he took in John's gobsmacked, hurt expression. John realized his mouth was hanging open and closed it, heart thudding in his chest with something akin to dread. He should've known better, he berated himself. He and Shaun hadn't decided anything, nothing had been said. John had just assumed.
Sherlock glanced down at where John touched him for a moment, adjusting his stance, and he then lifted his arms and pulled John in for the hug John had forgone, looking away as he did so and soothingly, if a bit clumsily, he then rubbed between John’s shoulder blades. He was toasty warm and smelt of chemicals, honey, and his own musky and natural scent, and it was instantly calming. Heart wrenchingly so.
It was the work of some minutes- and failing a few times as memories of Sherlock rutting against him in the sitting room and Sherlock asking John to fuck him kept intruding- but finally, John was soft again and he breathed a sigh of relief as Sherlock snuggled closer, snuffling against John's skin. He pushed his head against John's scarred shoulder, rubbing his cheek against it like a selfish cat and John made another attempt to shift himself away (though he was running out of mattress).
He was still at the stage where he still had a series of tests to conduct, and had not completely given up on 'reasonable' tactics to get his doctor to take the final step.
"You don't deserve it," John leaned forward, biting down sharply on his detective's nipple for his own selfish satisfaction. After soaking up Sherlock's deep grunt of pleasure, he spoke again. "Want to hear what happened after that?"
“There is nothing logical about this, Sherlock. I would say that you’re overwhelmed by your heart ruling your head for once, but you don’t ha-”
“Cushy,” he commented cheekily, bouncing on John’s arse playfully.
"Well, it was a nice thought but I suppose-"
" Sherlock forced out, losing his balance and helplessly tumbling back against the radiator, his body hitting it with a loud
John groaned partly with shock, wishing he could reach to muffle his lover, who yelled loudly enough to ruin eardrums. Sherlock gritted his teeth and writhed sensuously through his lengthy orgasm, before abruptly sinking to his knees, shivering.
"I fucking loved it." Shaun pulled John down and gave him a heated kiss, sloppily twining their tongues together and forgetting about John's 'no kissing' rule of earlier. "That was...
Mrs Hudson's whole demeanour seemed to come to a stop, her entire body turning to stone as she set her gentle eyes on Sherlock. Although he noticed they didn't look so gentle any more.
And the rub of it was, John seemed totally unaffected.
"Greedy. Not until after you've taken all I can give you." John moved back, pouring the near-empty lube from his fatigues on his fingers generously. "Such a slut."
"Watson...John...do it, come." He huffed, sucking in fevered breaths, shoving one hand roughly into John's hair and tugging at it.
John, unaware of the carnage at his feet, grinned into the kiss, kissing Sherlock back to within an inch of his life, tugging at his dark, glossy curls selfishly. Sherlock took a deep, shuddering, gasping breath and drew away just far enough that John could see his eyes which were huge and glassy.
, I want to have you," John whispered harshly, blinking briefly in the sallow light, and then staring at his detective openly. "
"I might be 'worse' than your last boyfriend, but God knows I'm
Sherlock tried.
"Okay. Fair enough. I won't ask any more," John soothed him, kissing him briefly. "I'm going to...just try something. Tell me if it doesn't feel right." He trailed his hand pointedly down Sherlock's body until he reach his hips once more. Drifting across, and down, he used his knuckles to gently push the detective's thighs further apart, and then pressed the reassuring weight of his fingertips against the other man's perineum.
for a reason…and you
He watched the door close with a loud click and then exploded into action, hurriedly sequestering himself in the bathroom and locking the door tight. He rammed a hand down between his legs, gripping himself eagerly, gasping as he selfishly envisioned John taking the place of the fist mauling his shaft. It'd been months since he'd done this and his traitorous body was already close to the edge. It was only a few more pulls on his cock before Sherlock was coming, muffling his cries against his forearm. He awkwardly smeared away the copious, white evidence of his climax with tissue, then stood straight on trembly long legs, panting.
Molly moaned, twisting her head to the side and encountering something soft and warm. She panted against it, distantly aware of the sound of John shouting, obviously coming but easily ignored- focusing on the rising tide of her own pleasure, imagining herself begging Sherlock in such a way…
I don’t hear movement toward that pen. – SH
“Shame.”
Sherlock treated him to a small, amused smirk. “I’m fairly sure. It may astound you to know that I do know what sex entails, and I’m pretty certain I haven’t had it. Not even accidentally.”
"Well, obviously you
"Still at it?" John asked coolly from the doorway, raising an eyebrow at Sherlock's dark scowl. "My answer is still no. But go ahead, give the walls a pounding."
"My scalp is your receptacle for as long as you want it. Anyway, isn't it supposed to be good for your hair?"
get me wrong Sherlock, I would love you to meet my parents...I just know you would hate it."
Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he tried to remember where he'd heard that name before. It was stunningly hard to concentrate at the moment, hard to even
"...Never seen this one before, Sherl...special occasion?" Sherlock didn't answer, though he blushed tellingly, before yanking a white shirt and a fresh pair of trousers from the wardrobe, then ransacking his sock drawer.
"...Oh,...oh," Sherlock swallowed back further words, looking flustered, and awkward, and overcome in the low light. John could tell he was holding back, and frankly, he didn't want any of that nonsense.
"Careful, queer," Luke muttered, frowning at the phone as he slowly thumbed through it, "Photos, yeah?" he laughed, nabbing the bottle and wincing through a few more deep swallows.
something I’d hear when people talk about male genitalia. Not heard one be called ‘lovely’ before.” He laughed and his stomach muscles tensed attractively, erection bobbing. “Yours is really quite nice too.”
Sherlock deflated a little, was notably hesitant for a few seconds. "Um...yes...if, um...yes.” He trailed off, fiddling with the calloused fingertips of John's right hand.
John was about to punch the cars' console, when the tinny vocals from Sherlock's wire made themselves known.
"Christ, Sherlock." he exclaimed helplessly, tongue coming out to lick at his lips, throat bobbing with a desirous swallow. He reached out and brushed his fingers against the wet spot, lips parting as he felt the damp warmth of Sherlock's release. "I did that." He murmured, rather stunned Sherlock had come so quickly, just from John muttering filthy things to him.
With an indulgent, strained gasp, Sherlock managed to get up on shaky legs, shrug on John's discarded dressing gown, and wander out in the living room, yawning mightily. His stomach rumbled and Sherlock, massaging it curiously, discovered that he actually felt hungry. He frowned, suddenly realizing John had left without first cooking something for him to eat.
Greg choked on his swallow of beer and immediately set about coughing, pounding on his chest, his eyes streaming. John looked shocked, eyes wide in horror, and Sherlock frowned, looking from Greg- who now had one hand planted in his silvery hair, giggling uncontrollably, his dark eyes crinkling in unrestrained amusement- to John, who looked incredibly angry, his jaw tight.
I would be somewhere else," the doctor retorted, sounding more harsh than he'd intended.
Sherlock whined. "John,
"I was exaggerating. You're likely to get molested by head rubs and dribbling. Nothing more. But I can't promise anything," John said, sounding more carefree than he felt. "You chose to take this risk," he huffed gently, pulling back his leg from Sherlock as subtly as he could, feeling hot blushes tenderise his face.
John felt his vision narrow in sudden anger, a rushing sound in his ears muffling the din of his co-workers laughter, and his jaw was clenched so tight he could hear his teeth grinding together.
to deal with?"
"John..." Sherlock's throat clicked as words failed him and John recognized the signs Sherlock was about to come. He stepped back, taking away his hand and smearing the remnants of Sherlock's (deliciously copious) pre-come on the velvet seat in the corner of the changing room. Grinning maliciously, he glanced back at Sherlock, whose arms were extended feebly but needily in his direction, like something from a bad zombie film.
"You…you can still fuck me...if you want." Sherlock offered tentatively, feeling like a fool. How pathetic was he that he couldn't even last through the preparation it took for sex?
He was short also- no debating where John had gotten his height from- with grey hair and a weathered, lined face. His brown eyes were observant and keen and from his bearing and the way he dressed, Sherlock knew he was a man to be taken seriously. A direct counterpoint to his bubbly wife. No doubt John had called him "sir" as a boy, and not "father."
Frantically tugging on his cock with quick, jerky movements, Sherlock chased his urgently needed but fading climax. Failing to come, Sherlock, growling, levered himself up on his elbows once more, hurriedly removing his vibrator and shaking it, before retrieving the batteries from their compartment, peering at them to check for flaws before re-inserting them…and still finding no joy.
"I was just...acting in such a way that I knew would be conducive to our needs..."
The gesture was like a spear through Sherlock's heart. He was very much aware of the fact that, were it not for him, John would still be well. Healed. He wouldn't have almost bled out while being operated on because he wouldn't have been stabbed in the first place. Sherlock let John hold his hand until the doors opened onto their floor.
"…But…you chickened out?" John asked fondly, a wide smile on his face.
"You mean, where did I learn to disappoint?" He spat, more acidly than he had intended.
?” he asked.
“That’s a bit harsh. I thought you were in love with me.”
"Let her check you over." John murmured, giving the nurse an apologetic glance while he openly ogled. "I won't go far."
“Feels warm…” John said, and the brunette frowned in slight bemusement.
"We're just going to browse for the moment, Chaucer."
"This is what happens when you're bad, Sherlock." John replied calmly, letting loose a quick series of smacks on Sherlock's arse, painting the white globes a glowing red. Lovely. Greedily, John leaned down and licked the hot skin of Sherlock's left buttock, gleefully absorbing every little twitch of muscle and every strained whimper from his partner.
John, unprepared for the sudden change, yelped, hips brutally thrusting upward into Sherlock's grip.
times, he admitted. In the darkness of his room, wanking, when his fantasies of big-breasted women would suddenly turn into broad-shouldered men...
"Fine. I thought...I really enjoyed what you did earlier- when you used your hand and your...mouth." John's eyes strayed to the object in question and, for the first time since his disastrous blunder in the sitting room, Sherlock felt faint stirrings of interest again. "I thought you might...do it again?"
Pen. – SH
"Sherlock, get on your knees." John stated tiredly. When Sherlock's mouth opened in surprise, John flicked his pointed finger toward the carpet, as if commanding a dog to sit. Sherlock blinked rapidly, obvious confusion suffusing his face as he slowly walked closer to John. He gave him a searching, puzzled look before gracefully sinking to his knees, wincing slightly when he made contact with the semen-stained carpet.

!" John exclaimed throatily, giving Sherlock another reprimanding spank. "Oh, that's
He began to fortify the (comfortable, reassuring, beautiful, delicious) rooms in his Mind Palace marked 'John' with Mission Impossible-style laser beam traps and motion sensors.
Thanks for all the lovely support and comments! We greatly appreciate them and hope you enjoy the rest of the story!
In a spontaneous act that expressed his gratitude at Shaun's ministrations over the last nine weeks, John seized Shaun in a fierce hug.
Sherlock was squirming as subtly as he could on his seat at the scarred, wobbly table made sticky by years of ineffectual wipe-downs with a damp dishcloth. It had been an hour and a half since his and John's little rendezvous, and after acknowledging with some shock that he had ended up staying in the toilet for nearly twelve minutes to reduce suspicion, he was reluctant to make his way back there again.
"God, look at her!" John nodded instructively towards a bleached, fake-breasted gold-digger who was staggering against one of the old MP's.
A faint, annoyed huff, and a long pause. "…A bit."
pens right there.”
it, it’s a chore.”
John's blog immediately sprang into life and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Trust John to leave their bed and check his sodding blog when there were better things to be doing- such as cooking Sherlock breakfast. Sherlock felt he had earned it after last night and-
"I...I don't...know?" Sherlock's hips shakily thrust up, cock bobbing with the motion, and John's hand wrapped around it, stroking quickly.
'Consulting Genius'
Sherlock blinked dizzily and swiped a quaking hand across his tear-soaked eyes, disrupting the pretty wet cobwebs of his eyelashes. He sat up in a wobbly fashion, groaning faintly at the complaining twinges of pain in his arms, thighs, calves and abdomen. He was sore all over, muscles he rarely used throbbing in protest at his sudden change in position, and the idea of actually
"Your...excessive use of flattering adjectives is...nice," Sherlock laughed nervously before it suddenly occurred to him that he should repay the compliments. "You...you're toned...and strong, and your skin is like saffron."
"Oh," John wheezed, his chest rising and falling with a rate that might be seen as a medical emergency by a casual observer. "...Oh...you...
Sherlock grumbled as he strode around the flat at 7 in the morning, moody and irritable, glaring out the smeared window at the torrential spring rain which battered the glass like handfuls of pebbles thrown by an angry deity. He'd been hoping for a more desiccated atmosphere for his latest experiment involving salamanders and carbon monoxide in Mrs. Hudson's small garden out back. The sky outside was dark, though, massive clouds heavy with rain, and Sherlock's mood darkened when he realized his experiment would have to wait.
"Do I what?"
His phone dinged and he sighed before snatching it up, flicking it open and expecting to see Mrs. Hudson's usual
"You're fine now, Sherlock." John whispered, even if he sounded angry and Sherlock could feel the tension radiating from him. "You're fine."
John was afraid to speak, afraid he'd break whatever tenuous peace Sherlock had gained from his touch. He held his breath, watching a flush stain Sherlock's cheeks, the knowledge that this mad genius had almost been taken from him hitting particularly hard.
"Down near the end." John giggled, inordinately pleased seeing Sherlock at a loss and hunting for something. It was so rare and, if John were being honest, rather endearing.
Sherlock thought about refusing. He was still angry and hurt and, while he accepted John's apology, it still didn't solve the problem.
"Tell me how exactly how you found her."
Sherlock wasn't one to be squeamish but the feeling of the dead weight of his would-be murderer upon him made him antsy. He bucked, squirming his body to make him move, breaths labored and panted from exertion. All around him bodies fell in a spray of bullets.
At the reminder, John froze, his eyes going shuttered and he pulled away from Sherlock. "I'd forgotten about that." He sighed resignedly, sitting back on the bed and staring unhappily at the laptop. "All right. Show it to me, Sherlock."
"Go on then...tell me the story," John mumbled, leaning down to suckle on Sherlock's pale, pulsing throat, whilst grinding relentlessly, yet agonisingly slowly, against him.
," Sherlock swallowed a few times, huffing a sharp exhale as he started a deliberate, slow, hard rhythm. His sore hands twitched as he sought the anchor of John's shirt.
Sherlock scowled childishly and opened his mouth to complain further, when John leaned close to his ear and murmured in a deep, sultry tone that he had frustratingly little experience with. "I promise I'll make it worth your time if you go."
"Mm... maybe you don't need me for this mission then."
Sherlock shifted on the sofa, his bare feet and hands making clammy sounds on the leather upholstery.
Sherlock swayed forward, letting his cock, which had started getting hard at the memory, brush against John's hip, breath hitching at the pressure. John's fingers dug in harder.
Gasping with discomfort and impatience, Shaun leaned back and effortlessly hooked John's legs over his shoulders, giving him a feral grin before he started pounding into him. John winced faintly but was more entranced with the beads of sweat dripping onto his over-heated chest like oil on a hot pan. He jacked himself harshly as Shaun had told him, pleasure coiling slow and reluctant through his body. He was distracted by the odd sensations of being fucked- of being stretched and used. Luckily- thanks to the alcohol- his inhibitions were down and John distantly thought he'd have a crisis fucking tomorrow over being fucked by a guy. Tonight...he just wanted to have fun.
He still had hope that Shaun loved him back. He rather thought he did. They spent a lot of time together and Shaun seemed to like him. It didn't sit well with John to think that all Shaun thought of him was as a useful cock.
"Fine, I owe you new trousers." John paused for a brief reflection, and then laughed, suddenly and sweetly. "This could become an expensive habit."
John was quite frankly still dumbstruck by Sherlock's protective actions, and in the next few seconds, he felt a surge of three powerful, competing emotions. One was utter thrill at the detective's blank-faced physical defence of his own honour. The second was the burning, buzzing, illicit euphoria that his subconscious churned out in anticipation of taking Sherlock at his word, and to his bed, very soon.
“…Ah. Yes. Sorry,” Sherlock babbled, blushing hot under John’s gaze, picking and twisting the duvet between his fingers.
Raising his hands slowly, he temporarily plonked a few antique hardbacks on top of the bowl for added security.
"Oh?" She glanced at John, still smiling and flushed from Sherlock's antics. "Well? What news?"
"I know you're going to check for yourself anyway so…yes, I like bondage. As much as you like getting off in public." John grinned. Sherlock smiled in return.
"Good one," John smirked, stroking through Sherlock's crisp curls with slightly tremble-y fingertips. "I tell you what, if this year carries on like this..."
John ignored it, seemingly intent on kissing every inch of Sherlock he could. His mouth closed around one of Sherlock's pebbled nipples, mouth warm and wet, and sucked gently at it, not nipping or biting as he usually would have done. Sherlock shuddered, legs falling open, knees coming up to bracket around John's hips, cock nudging insistently against John.
"I know what it's like to be a virgin, Sherl. My memory is actually functional considering my age." He chuckled weakly, but the humour didn't reach his eyes, and his impish smile was absent. "You're going to be a bit...rubbish your first time. Not just you. Everyone is always rubbish their first time. All this shit you see about the first time being perfect and magical and everyone came and no one was embarrassed is just that...shit. You're going to make mistakes and you're...you're going to be oblivious about things but guess what? You're going to get better at it."
! I'm gonna send you home if you don't behave. Right?" Lestrade ordered voluminously, placing a heavy, stern hand on his shoulder.
The detective succumbed to a massive yawn as he thought about answering, and then nearly choked on it when the door was gently opened, John’s innocent face peeking around it.
Kept it on. Wearing his own ejaculate like apparel. Sherlock nearly lost it.
"It's the...it's the...Oh, God," Sherlock uttered, gritting his teeth, and planting long hands into John's short, ash-brown hair. "We need to go there…pet shop...because..." John gave a vindictively-deep suck and Sherlock's throat emitted a desperate, high-pitched noise that John hadn't heard before.
Sherlock allowed himself a brief glance at John, wishing he could just clean up and snuggle in alongside him and share in his languidness. Have John sling an arm around his body and share his heat. Sherlock had never woken up beside anyone before, he'd never even slept with someone, and he wondered what it would be like. Uncomfortable? Crowded? Strangely erotic? Stiflingly hot?
Sherlock smirked. "I know what you think of my hair, John. You love it because it's soft and tactile and shiny. You only want me to cut it because of some misguided social rule."
"Sh...Sher...Need to...god, please!"
"He's always been good at playing the tart, yeah?" Lestrade said, taking a sip of his coffee, not aware he was pushing John Watson to homicide.
"John..."
"How have you managed," he asked breathlessly, wincing in apparent discomfort and hissing in a sharp inhale through his teeth as John bumped his impressive, blood-flushed hard-on against his own.
wanting to…Do
"Yes, sir." John replied cheekily, pulling away long enough to shed his own clothes and grab the lube from the bedside table. Sherlock eagerly scrambled back on the bed, his heart thrumming in his chest as John crawled up his body, his eyes dark with want but his face open and smiling.
Okay, something that occurred to me, and I want to see if anyone else noticed it/agrees, or whether I’m just sad and seeing everything through powerful slash goggles XD
John suddenly shouted, hunching forward, semen erupting from the tip of his cock in strong, powerful spurts. Splashes of musky, hot liquid decorated Sherlock’s pale face in a barely-noticeable white patina. His enviously-clear skin glistening with John's release, Sherlock abruptly grinned with glee as he licked off the lukewarm seed from his front teeth, and knuckled a fist fondly into one of his damp eye sockets. He darted his tongue out to catch a few extra renegade drops as it slid down his face.
"Be specific. Although God knows it's hardly necessary. I'm
. That’s…
..." John muttered feverishly, closing his eyes and trying to get control of himself but he'd reached the limit of his patience. He couldn't believe what Sherlock had done. Everything that day came tumbling back, raising his blood pressure and making the ringing in his ears worse.
"John...feel good," Sherlock murmured vaguely, sighing. "Rub me."
"Enjoy it, Sherlock," John smirked, kneeling on the bed and giving the brunette a quick, but hard and wet kiss. He pulled back and got dressed with alacrity.
if you don't want-"
John frowned and whipped his head behind him and then back, utterly confused and very worried. "What? No, I mean yes we're alone. What's going on?"
Sherlock hummed, the sound throaty and deep and resonating, “Good,” he all but purred. “I’ll take that as an open invitation and happy permission to climb into bed with you more than ever.”
he comes back, Sherlock thought depressingly. He tensed as he heard her footsteps on the floor below, preparing to mount the stairs to 221B, and texted back quickly.
"Don't want steady." Shaun almost slurred. "Want…you to
were a different person. Definitely not out as queer, if I recall," he smiled, not caring when John glared at him. "Come on. We could still have loads of fun.”
"It's ok." He soothed, smiling fondly at his wreck of a lover. "I love you when you're coming too quickly, when you want me so much and you're enjoying what we're doing so much that you can't help yourself, you can't control yourself. You…can't control yourself. I love it."
John quirked his brow, almost ready to laugh and childishly poked his tongue out at his detective in playground-style retaliation.
“…Yes?” Sherlock asked when John hadn’t expanded on his thought. He was breathing a little heavily and heat was pouring off him in waves. It was enchanting.
"Ok then."
"Okay, I think you're going to last alright. For me to take you. One more finger, honey." John was teasing his ring finger against Sherlock's damp, hot entrance, when he stilled at his own words. "
"You still...you've still pissed me off," Sherlock uttered a little tremulously, eagerly stepping forward, his dormant, righteous anger currently being swamped by utter desire.
to know why I phoned?...I did say, 'life or death.'...or is that less important than your idiot colleagues conjuring little pictures in their heads of you being fucked by a man?"
Molly sighed heavily at the self-conscious words from the beautiful detective in the next bedroom, spreading herself with her left hand whilst simultaneously inserting the vibrator even more deeply, using the tip of her right forefinger to stimulate her clitoris.
He could hear John humming in the kitchen as he prepared dinner and he realized, like a bolt of lightning, that tonight, John would be staying in the flat. He wouldn't be going out on a date with one of his women because he and Sherlock were now together. Disregarding any potential complaints John might possibly have, Sherlock made his way to the sofa and snuggled onto the well-worn fabric, determined to sleep off his orgasm for an hour or two.
?" Shaun purred, teasing John's cock with a finger, dragging it along the large vein on the underside, tracing the mushroomed head delicately.
A minute later, John entered the front room to see Sherlock crouched over the cat, calmly and easily nicking away at the rough fabric of the collar with a scalpel until it fell away, showing an oozy, sore necklace of skin.
of it. If you're not...used to it," John tried, sounding flat. "We
need apparently. Did you manage it? To get off again? Or have you been rolling around in frustration for the best part of eight hours?" John asked, a suggestive, dark grin on his thin lips. Before Sherlock could answer, John smoothed his left hand through the considerable mess of clear stickiness that covered his detective's flat, white stomach, and proceeded to suck on his tainted fingertips in a display of pure filth.
John followed him as he continued to look at the rest of the shop's storage and Sherlock let him. He was being quiet, unobtrusive-
If John Watson kept fucking him like this, he didn't need anybody else.
"No – Sherlock! That's not needed." John tugged Sherlock back down and cuddled the agitated man to him. "All this about
"Not so bad yourself," Shaun murmured, sounding shattered, and John kissed his shoulder. Affection swelled inside his chest and he hugged him tighter.
"Ready for bed?"
"John...I-"
." Sherlock uttered out of the blue, his deep voice strained with dread and John hissed in pain as Sherlock's fingernails, unexpectedly sharp, dug viciously into his sides. Sherlock tensed beneath him, his breath ceasing for a few stunned, worrying seconds, before a grating, wet wail eased itself past gritted teeth. A familiar, hot musk scented the humid air of the flat as Sherlock bucked hard a few times against John, sobbing in what sounded like frustration…as well as a brutal climax.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. He didn't need John to point out how appealing she was. He could see it for himself. It was rude besides, for John to be ogling her in such a fashion. They were together now. Did John...did John want her? Sherlock swallowed thickly against the well of jealousy.
John would have preferred to take refuge in his admittedly chilly office all day and avoid the inevitable confrontation with his co-workers, but he was starving. Bracing himself, clenching his fists stoically in a habitually comforting motion, John exited his office, avoiding eye contact as he walked down the hall and trying his very best to appear nonchalant.
"...I...I just...ah,
Sherlock hissed, clenching his strong fingers around his doctors’ biceps.
"Christ...Shaun...you were spectacular," he heaved, hugging the younger man to himself and trying to stay inside him as long as he physically could.
"Oh, Sherlock...kiss me, you fucking bastard," John wheezed fondly, grasping the detective's diamond-cutter cheekbones and kissing the lips that were, by contrast, soft and pink and plump as rose petals.
By the time Sherlock had managed to wrap his head around the relative enormity of what John had done, thirty-three minutes had passed, and he was alerted by the sound of John's key in the flat's front door, and footsteps on the dusty stairs. He snapped the laptop shut and raced for the door, intercepting John just as he walked through, arms full of bags, face smiling.
“You’re actually never going to ask me if anything that happens in
“One compound can be easily extracted from a reasonably common plant, wolfsbane, which is also easy to cultivate in the Northern hemisphere, especially if you happen to be a degree-level horticulturalist who is employed by this woman to maintain her extensive acreage of land. She wouldn’t recognise it; I doubt she would have known a nettle from a nasturtium. Long story short, the toxin collected from the plant was applied via the acupuncture needles. The therapist who gave her the treatment is looking distinctly awkward, but it’s not fear or shock, it’s guilt. I suspect that it’s his partner, the gardener, who supplied the poison. Her heart suffered arrhythmia, and this soon led to asphyxia and death. I imagine the motive was money, she made an effort to bequeath substantial amounts to her loyal staff upon her demise. I suspect they couldn’t wait any longer,” Sherlock panted, clearing his throat with finality. Lestrade, pen poised over his notepad, stared openly at Sherlock, looking dumbfounded, and John grinned.
To Sherlock, mouth dry in arousal and fear, it seemed to take much longer than it should have.
"What? Yeah- pub night sounds great." John tried pushing Sherlock away but he suddenly latched onto his cock and voraciously sucked at it.
! Have you been eating enough?" Mrs. Watson asked, patting John's jacket and unnecessarily smoothing out wrinkles. "You look as if you've lost at least ten pounds. It's not healthy to starve yourself, John. You're a doctor- I shouldn't have to be telling you that."
John wasn't buying it.
"God, you're fucking gorgeous like this." John breathed. "Jesus. Look at you. You're taking it so well." John moved his finger in and out of Sherlock's arse, almost all the way out before pushing it back in. "You're so...tight."
"John." Sherlock reprimanded softly, voice choked, his skin flaming with colour, and John chuckled, nosing his way into the soft baby curls at the base of Sherlock's neck and breathing in the warm, sleepy-softness of him.
!" Mrs. Watson was just as effusive in her greeting of Sherlock as she was of John, giving him a bosomy hug and engulfing him in a cloud of sickly sweet, flowery perfume. "I'm so glad to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you." She turned to John and gave a vulgar, exaggerated wink. "He
"I'm sure you can manage that much," John grinned, nodded pointedly toward the considerable, sticky, white scabs of dried semen on Sherlock's body.
"Well…now everyone knows what your face looks like mid-orgasm."
John, feeling suddenly too tired to try and usurp the detective, staggered out again, picked up the godforsaken red fountain pen, and held it out to Sherlock upon his return, sitting down heavily. "Satisfied now?"
John could still feel Sherlock's lips against his cheek, his hot breath ghosting over the doctor's flesh. It was when he felt the tip of his cock pressing against something that was definitely not a mouth that his eyes flew open.
His stomach gave a little queasy roll at this thought, and a few random muscle pangs seem to mirror the sentiment. Huffing a quiet laugh to himself, he took another drag of his cigarette, his long, strong fingers curled awkwardly around the little stick in what appeared to be an almost arthritic display of paradoxical size.
"Oh." Sherlock looked down at the crumpled piece of paper in his hands. There were still crumbs stuck to it. "What did it say?"
Sherlock secretly hoped John would be done soon. He didn't think his legs would support him for much longer and it was with relief that he heard John's breathing catch, stuttering out of his chest in a sigh. The slick sound of his hand rubbing at his cock was loud in the stall and Sherlock listened as John sped up, hands grasping at Sherlock- then the hot splash of his come jetting onto Sherlock's arse.
terms-“
Sherlock, though, took his arm and towed him forward, propelling him into a world of power and money. John could practically
Yes...
Licking his heart-shaped lips, a rogue spring breeze almost immediately cooling and drying them, Sherlock took a few deliberately slow breaths and
"You know, I could get used to this," John admitted quietly, grasping Sherlock's warm arm to himself and groaning faintly at the comfort of it.
Molly winced.
Trying to deduce whether or not John was mad from the timbre of his voice, Sherlock rolled off the lilo, pulling on his clothes from the previous night with slow, methodical movements. He didn't look forward to facing either John or Molly in the kitchen. But mostly John.
…me.” Sherlock seemed to be stuck on a loop, dazed and overcome, his eyes wide and unfocused.
"I have a physiological problem," Sherlock murmured in his own defence.
Said throat bobbed as Sherlock swallowed and he nodded. "I’m...surprised you managed that." John added cautiously.
"If I had a date,
A frighteningly violent rumble of thunder helped John wake abruptly from the distressing dream he'd been suffering. He blinked in the darkness for a few seconds, gasping for breath, the dream replaying over and over in his head. John propped himself up with a tired sigh and rubbed his face- immediately freezing when he felt liquid on his nose, cheeks and chin. . He knew what it was like to wake up with tears on his face, but this was different. An irrational surge of panic flared in his gut and he tensed, the remnants of his dream rushing to the fore, half-expecting to smell the coppery scent of blood, taste it, metallic, in his mouth….before a cold drop landed on his forehead, making him jump.
, seriously. You're so...
With a contortion of his mouth, clearly stifling an answering smile, Sherlock took hold of the offered end, “I greatly dislike you for this. I thought we were through with the crackers at Christmas.”
Huffing irritably, he yelled indiscriminately, not entirely sure where John was, or whether he was even in the flat. "JOHN! Put my rose in water or it's going to die!"
"You'd be so good for me. Taking it. Begging for it. Your cheeks flushed, mouth open and panting as I took you." John ground down again and Sherlock shuddered helplessly, gasping just as John had said he would.
." Sherlock flicked his gaze briefly to John's before taking up a fresh pair of latex gloves and setting them nearby, sliding a sharp new blade onto his scalpel.
Sherlock blinked at John, trying to work out what he meant.
"I don't want to." Sherlock blurted standing up and moving away from John.
He shuddered, self-hatred warring with fear until he finally got himself under control. He scrubbed at his face, squaring his jaw, refusing to give in to weaker emotions again. The sound of the door opening barely registered. He was sure it was one of the nurses, checking on him.
Sherlock shook his head. "That's not...even after we started having sex again-"
any more. But you were here."
, that was. John smiled at the sight of Sherlock sprawled on his back like a pale starfish on the bed, mouth parted slightly and emitting the tiniest of snores as he slept. The room was barely illuminated by a weak, watery yellow light from outside which penetrated the net curtains. The sun had yet to rise and the air held a breathless hush as the entire world seemed to wait for the first rays of sunshine.
"John...it's not enough...please...I'm ready now, let's do it. God, let's do it," Sherlock panted, fumbling a wet hand through his doctor's short hair, thumbing lovingly, encouragingly, across his temple and brow.
A choked, sharp cry heralded the penetration after a few breathless seconds, and John fought not to grin smugly as the fingers of both of Sherlock's long, elegant hands fisted in his too-short hair, scratching for an anchor as Sherlock’s damp hips gyrated like an practising belly-dancer.
He was wondering if Sherlock were going to stroke him to completion under the table and make him come in his jeans and wondering if he would care...When Sherlock stood and leaned down to murmur in John's ear. "Meet me in the loos."
"I was thinking...some..." Sherlock bit his plump bottom lip before continuing in an impossibly deeper, quieter voice, his stunning cheekbones colouring a beautiful pink as one large hand alighted on Molly's shoulder. "Some...lubricant. I don't have much experience and...I want to make sure it all...goes smoothly. As it were." he added, with a charming, self-conscious chuckle.
"Why...why did you..."Sherlock stuttered, at a loss for words. "I saw...your blog and the...our picture…"
"Lovely?" John asked with a grin he'd been hoping to restrain. Picking open his shirt, he tossed it aside and sat on the bed beside Sherlock, nonchalantly moving his hands to his flies. Predictably, Sherlock's eyes jumped to the movement and John watched pink suffuse his cheeks as he worked the fabric off his hips and down his legs. Sherlock rolled to his knees and shuffled forward on the lilo, placing his hands on John's hips. He was at the perfect height to nuzzle his nose against the rapidly forming bulge in John's pants lovingly, but John pulled away.
Sherlock shrugged "That's his job. Clothes don't fit right unless all the appropriate measurements…"
“I could ask the same question.”
"One of the...one of the bloody fortune cookies," John uttered, scrubbing a hand across his forehead in anxiety, his face devastated.
John frowned, not sure the detective should be laughing over what he'd just revealed about his former co-worker. "That he's got something- been infected at some point..."
"Uh...yes, it is." John admitted, glancing around at all his preparation, suddenly feeling self-conscious. "It's...well, it's our 3 month anniversary."
John winced at the off-hand way Sherlock dismissed someone else's grisly end, dumping the bags beside the double bed, sighing heavily. He scrubbed his face and ruffled his hair in irritation. "So...'uninspiring'...I take it you weren't involved with any of them?" John's face was still stoically expressionless, his features tense and blank after the episode with Molly earlier that morning which had necessitated their move from her flat.
The next thing John knew, it was morning, and the intermittent tapping that, in his dream, had been hailstones against a car window as a T-rex stalked closer to his hiding place, slowly revealed itself to be the sound of rapid fingertips racing over a keyboard.
John's eyes softened predictably and his lips went a little less pinched. "Sherlock..." He reached down and grasping Sherlock's hand in his. "I'm not mad. Well, actually, yes I am mad but...I'll get over it. And listen, just because I was with him doesn't mean I still want to be. Okay? I want to be with you. I'm fucking stunned that I'm with you, all right? Stop being jealous of the past."
"...You've borrowed my toothpaste. Knob," John murmured affectionately, whilst trying to remember exactly how much leeway he had to shuffle backwards without actually tumbling out of his rather humble bed. "This must be a dream, because you shun all my cheap stuff."
, Molly frantically thought to herself, her mind already spinning another fantasy, placing herself on her back with Sherlock kneeling between her spread legs, his eyes keen and penetrating, staring at her and planning his next move.
“You daydreamed about us shagging.”
Sherlock growled. "Why?
"He doesn't want to consummate the relationship. Such as it is. We came
"Wait, wait! Finish the rest of them!" John panted, trying to tug out of Sherlock's grip.
bed?"
Before Sherlock knew it, he was in his designer shoes, being shoved out the front door by a firm, strong hand on his arse, onto a pavement drenched in the abated rainstorm that had pounded Baker Street just ten minutes earlier. John took a deep breath of the damp, strangely-comforting pollutant taste of the London morning air.
Sherlock ignored him. He heard John sigh, and then hesitate. He thought John would walk away, decide Sherlock was being too difficult and put the whole thing from his mind. He was rather counting on it- John opened the door, his face weary and patient.
Now that Sherlock had cut him off from sex, and by extension wanking...it only stood to reason he would be on the prowl. If John was going to try it on with someone else, Sherlock wanted to be there to see it. Well...he didn’t want to be there of course, and he didn’t want to see it at all- the pain of John finding someone else to have giggly, rough sex with was too painful to contemplate-…but he wanted to be proved right.
"Hmm...I wouldn't be opposed to doing it again...should you want me to."
have a row- a bad one- and break up. Then she could comfort Sherlock. She'd be the good friend, the shoulder to cry on, the one to offer comfort, and Sherlock may fall in love with her.
Sherlock slowed his hand to a tortuous, snail-pace. "Slow enough?" he murmured, his wrist bumping awkwardly against John's in the dark as they both attempted to maintain their rhythms on each other's shafts.
And what did this mean for them now? Did they go back to being just mates? Shaun had said to look him up if John ever needed help...
"I...That's not...
"Ah, yes. Sweet little thing. Sweet meat." He smacked his lips appreciatively. "And it'll make
could walk in and see him practically buggering one of his mates, panting into the back of his neck while he frantically rutted against him. Shame burned deep in his gut at how people would look, the shock and disgust on their faces, if they saw how he was behaving-
“I trust you.
"Is that all you're going to say to me?" John sighed, squinting up at the mussy-haired detective and scowling when Sherlock merely stared at him in reply. "What the hell are you doing in my bed, Sherlock?"
John followed Sherlock into the kitchen, fuming, his chest heaving with furious breaths. He was about to vent more of his anger, when Sherlock, peering into his microscope, spoke in an unnervingly quiet, steady voice, though spots of hot pink on his cheekbones betrayed his anxiety and frustration. "You know what I'm like, John. You know what your parents are like. You told them of my...particular nature. They probably would have been disappointed if I hadn't done something flamboyant or odd. Your mother now has a fabulous story to tell all her friends… It's guilt that's troubling you."
John sighed again. "
Sherlock was married to his work.
"You've got nice eyes," he said finally, feeling a little prickle run down his neck. This was ridiculous, and yet he couldn't shake the sudden rush of guilt as if he were being watched. "And you're funny, you're easy to talk to. You make people feel comfortable, and you have a charming smile."
Bring me the pen, John. – SH
"John-" Sherlock started, wanting to explain but John cut him off.
"Sherlock...do you...want to see it?" John asked, grinning his genuine, clown-like grin in the imposed gloom of the living room which was rapidly being invaded by early-morning London sunlight - eye-watering and welcoming. John hinted wordlessly by hooking his own thumbs teasingly under the waistband of his boxers and tugging at them.
"Fuck...give me a minute love...and then we'll go to the crime scene." John huffed tiredly against his shoulderblades. Sherlock heard his phone ping, and craned his neck to see where it was.
Nothing in Sherlock's demeanour changed but the slight quirk of an eyebrow, and the sharp focus of his green-grey eyes.
"Oh, shit..." John's hips thrust forward as he came, come dribbling from his prick and spattering down to decorate Sherlock's hair in thick, fat drops. He stared down at the mess as he came, eyes dark.
"I'm inside you." He whispered, awed, eyes wide and admiring. John whimpered faintly, teeth biting down on his bottom lip hard. His hands stuttered over the floor, before raking across his own thighs, and he huffed out a few sharp breaths. Distantly, he reminded himself that Sherlock would benefit from some gentle instruction.
"...I...want you to..." Sherlock huffed out a quick, breathless noise, before panting heavily a few times, and forcing himself recklessly, without grace, inside his lover. "...I want...this...I want you to fuck me. Can't...wait for the first time."
"A bit like couples shopping for saucy underwear?" John asked, laughing awkwardly, still looking hesitant, but now lightly flushed and intrigued. Sherlock nodded, feeling flushed himself at the idea.
Sherlock blinked. "I don't...isn't that what I'm supposed to say?"
Sherlock pulled a face, looking depressed and sulky all at once. “You should let go of my hand as well then. Leading me on and toying with my…vulnerabilities.  I didn’t have you down for a cruel-
!," John exclaimed as he attempted to sit up. "What..." he paused for a second whilst he frowned, birthing troubled, telling crinkles in his brow that would stay with him forever.
Sherlock appeared instantly ashamed of his lack of experience and leaned back against the mattress, turning his head away, “All right…”
Sherlock's mind buzzed with a fevered, haphazard mantra of immediate actions to be taken as soon as they arrived at the flat.
"......Down there," came the very quiet murmur, after an anxious pause.
"Get out of bed, you lazy bastard!"
“It’s called ‘kissing it better,’ Sherlock.”
"Is there anything else you would like me to do for you? Something...you might have done before?" Sherlock asked, his mind on full deduction mode, his eyes cold, his body unresponsive.
"Uh, yeah. It was." Lestrade confirmed. "So wait. You're saying we're looking for someone else?"
Sherlock watched John's back as he retreated into the little attached loo, a heavy feeling in his chest as he realized the extent of his inadequacy.
John smiled serenely, closed his eyes and rolled over, nuzzling into the pillow with a soft noise of appreciation, and flexing his naked back enticingly. Sherlock swallowed audibly and quickly shed his own dressing-gown.
"I don't fucking care - did you see him touch him?" John snarled, looking back at where Sherlock was flirting, slapping the man's hand away with a giggle.
Sherlock seemed to pause and almost seemed to stop breathing at John’s words, remaining still and silent for what felt like hours, before he shifted forward and soft, warm, lips edged in the faint rough scratch of stubble, brushed up to press a chaste kiss to the bridge of his nose, and then to his cheek and jaw. Sherlock didn’t speak, and when he had given John a last, lingering, peck to his throat, he pulled back and stroked his hand from John’s lower back to his shoulders.
Sherlock crawled over him immediately, his nose and mouth pushing to rest under the hinge of John’s jaw while he got comfortable, aligning their bodies so that when he lowered down, their stomachs, hips, pelvises and finally their crotches, touched. He exhaled a shaking breath of pleasure and bracketed John with his arms and legs, stroking the fingers of his right hand up John’s arm to lustfully trace the ridges and bumps of his scar. John flinched, not being used to such (or indeed, any) attention to his scar, even in the dark. He was well aware of the raised, keloid mass, the damaged topography of his shoulder and chest, and the unpleasant texture of it. He tried to direct Sherlock down, towards his nipple, which equally sensitive, but more pleasurably so.
John clasped Sherlock's chin in his fingers, marking him with his own bittersweet scent, and proceeded to use his other hand to shuck down his own waistband, whispering all the while. "It's okay. Look. It's fine. We...do you want to finish together?" At his husky query, his own sticky penis bobbed free, pulsing with every frantic heartbeat.
John treated him to a glorious, clownish grin, and proceeded to resurrect the unseen fairy. “There we go. All is right with the world.”
*Warning - elements of non-con.
"...I...um...yes..." Sherlock nibbled his bottom lip and squeezed John's hand tightly, bringing it to his lips and pressing a couple of gentlemanly smooches there before releasing it. He inhaled deeply, steadying himself, and, determined to be brave, led John into the over-priced Korean restaurant.
"Molly."
"I've managed to repress my gag reflex so it's only 12.2% efficient." Sherlock murmured seductively, before suckling with genuine pleasure on the base of John's shaft.
"...it is in actual fact a bit not good to flirt with someone else in front of your partner," she heard John enunciate.
Nothing but porn next time, I promise :3
“Don’t force me to ruin my plans for you John. I want to try and use as much of you as I can before I actually give in and have to kill you.” The detective pouted, and then pouted harder when John playfully bumped him with his shoulder.
. That sounded dishonest. He would just...obscure the truth. Keep some of it hidden. A bit. For a few days, until he could finish the case and come back to tell John all about it. There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
, Sherlock...that's it...
John inhaled slowly, a tactic Sherlock knew he employed when he was trying to remain clam. "Okay. He touched you...there. And when you said he wanted to eat you...you meant your...?" He trailed off and Sherlock, shivering from the memory, nodded.
Sherlock followed him quietly, appearing quite contemplative. As he lingered in the doorway of the bathroom, he took a halting breath, and then paused. John gave him a querying look.
“That’s a cat.”
Sherlock could barely wait. He was practically vibrating in nervous excitement. He wanted John's semen on his face, he'd decided, and had announced it to John over breakfast that morning.
By the time he had located the man in question- a gay Irish brunette in his late thirties- and started trawling through every Facebook profile detail and post, John was back. He distantly heard his questioning voice.
The sound threatening to leave her throat was quickly swallowed back, and even though her cheeks were blazing, she still nodded.
“Because you’re in love with me.”
...that was brilliant..."
-" Sherlock pumped his hips up, eyes slamming closed as he felt himself tipping over the edge-
. Heat. Wetness. Pressure. Sherlock's hips made tiny, abortive little thrusts into John's mouth and John, for the most part, let him and- oh god. He was going to come. Sherlock could feel it, tingling at the base of his cock, surging through his testicles-
"Sod that." John hissed, careful to keep his voice lowered so Chaucer wouldn't hear. No doubt he had his ear pressed to the door, hoping to get some vicarious thrill. John realised, belatedly, that this could actually manifest in twofold results. Raising his voice, he demanded. "Open your fucking trousers."
"Can you not...look?" Sherlock murmured, his large hands unconsciously, irrationally, raising up as if to block an assault and not just John's view of his still-clothed body.
"Please, John...please come." Sherlock begged, hips losing their rhythm altogether, gracelessly shoving his cock inside John in halting, delayed thrusts, each time afraid the next one would make him climax. "Please come...p-please..."
"Make it sound like what?" John asked, rubbing Sherlock's cock through his trousers, his fingers dipping down further to tease at his balls through the thin fabric. When Sherlock's thighs began to tremble, flexing to either side of John, he began undoing Sherlock's belt and flies, pulling the fabric from Sherlock's hips.
“You say that every time, you can’t still be surprised. I appreciate animals. When they act aggressively, when they kill, it’s for self-sufficiency. It’s innately coded in their DNA. They don’t understand malice or jealousy or greed. Not in the way people do. And they certainly don’t ask or deserve to be mistreated.”
Sherlock, looking from John to Greg, clamped his mouth shut and desperately tried to look as if he knew what they were talking about but found it utterly beneath him.
"John? JOHN!" Sherlock bellowed, before twiddling his three-day-old rose in his fingers, scowling when a wilted petal fell off and fluttered to the carpet. He strode to the bathroom door and banged on it. "YOU KILLED MY ROSE!"
"You asked what I need?...I'm more interested in what
Sherlock sighed resignedly as he watched a red-faced John drag the lilo from Molly's bedroom into the spare room.
John stared at Sherlock in disbelief, feeling the blood drain from his face, his fingers unconsciously tightening on the detectives’.
"Good, Sherlock. What else?" John prompted, pulling away. He knew he'd have Sherlock coming with just a few bobs of his head and he wanted a full apology before he let that happen.
"Hmm?" Sherlock asked innocently, eyes wide.
With a lewd, and extremely loud, groan in reply, Sherlock deepened the kiss with gripping hands, and lurched up in excitement. The movement was so strong and so sudden, that they ended up tumbling across the bed and half hanging off it. By the sounds of it, Sherlock had knocked his temple into the bedside table, yet it didn’t seem to discourage him, as he scrambled to keep them from falling out completely and dived clumsily for John’s throat, lavishing the skin with wet butterfly kisses and a slight nip of his teeth. John urged the detective's body directly on top of him, yanking impatiently at Sherlock's T-shirt whilst simultaneously trying to get him to bite harder, mostly by scratching through his hair and vaguely thumbing at his injured forehead.
"Bad man." He whispered teasingly, before lunging back down to kiss Sherlock some more, delighting in the sheer filthiness of it. John felt the brunette's hips bucking and twitching beneath him, and decided that Sherlock shouldn't endure another clothed orgasm. Licking his thin lips, grinning at the taste of his own release, John beamed down at his dizzy-looking lover. "What can I do for you?"
“…What?” Sherlock asked in a soft mutter and sneakily curled his fingers around the t-shirt collar to touch the bare skin of John’s spine, following the dips and curves with his fingernails.
Sherlock sighed, and stubbed out his dead cigarette in the egg-cup that he had been using as a makeshift ashtray. Their actual ashtray was in John’s room, and since it had been a present, it seemed a bit wrong to be filling it with ash and crumpled stubs, even if that was its sole purpose.
Screaming, John staggered, then nearly collapsed when the five-inch blade embedded in his already extensively-scarred shoulder, was
"Touch- touch yourself, Watson. Show me how much you want it."
Slowly, John felt Sherlock going boneless beside him, his breathing evening out and turning deep and languid. John smiled to himself as he finally allowed himself to drift off, hoping Sherlock would love what he was going to do.
"No. Not the most sparkling endorsement of lifelong partnership," Sherlock mused, oblivious.
"Just...fucking touch me. T - touch me...."
in me."
John moaned, hands fisting tight into the duvet again to prevent him from reaching out and taking what Sherlock was offering so sweetly...and naughtily. "That's...that's good. Good place to start." John rambled, cock jumping as Sherlock stuck out his tongue and ran it up the side of the hard flesh. He rolled his tongue in his mouth, analysing the flavour, and John dropped onto his back with an agonized groan.
Sherlock's face was flushed a dull red and he refused to meet John's eyes. "I...no. That's not what I want. Not anymore. You carry on as much as you want, John. I'll watch you reach orgasm if you want."
"J-John..." He panted, all rational thought gone, the heavy thickness of arousal stunning in its ability to strip away all his reserve and higher intelligence. "P-Please..."
John, slurping at Sherlock's arse, didn't respond, instead giving his cock another blazing stroke, nose nudging beneath Sherlock's tightly-drawn testicles. He hummed, the vibrations translated to his tongue, and Sherlock spasmed on the bed.
John responded with a little choked noise, batting the oil bottle away impatiently, and licking his thin lips. "...Fast, but gentle," he instructed with as much decorum as he could muster, considering the tenderness of his shaft and the demands of his animal brain yelling at him that he needed to come. He distantly hoped Sherlock wouldn't notice...or at least, wouldn't be offended, by his softened cock.
Sherlock managed, with a reckless and desperate effort, to insert the toy fully in one go, with a strangled groan. He writhed for a few seconds, adjusting to the sensation of having something in his body, of being so very
Sherlock, though, had no words to answer John with. He shook his head, hands coming up to grip at John's arms as if to stop him from moving away, wanting to pull him closer and never let go. He didn't understand how John thought
He didn't, however, fancy shuddering into an embarrassing comatose death in the freezing London gutters, and besides, John had enough irritated vitriol to fire him to confront his bastard, son-of-a-bitch, sulky, fucker, beautiful, irresistible lover. The rain had long since abated but the air was still bestowing a vicious, burning chill he wanted to get out of.
"I- I would still like to make you orgasm."
Everything else fell away and Sherlock's entire world narrowed to the point of contact between his body and the toy. It was vibrating harshly, perilously close to where he needed it to be…
John and his ex had done this...and more. A
"Maybe we should ask for another room." John said, leaning on the cheap, scarred dressing table as innocuously as he could. Sherlock saw through the ruse, observed the way John’s bad leg was shaking, threatening to give out on him, and wished John would let him help him.
is that going to help anything? I thought we were making love."
"He gets bored of
"Do you…do you want me to...?" Sherlock reached for John's cock, trying to make his message clear.
"Stop right there, Sherlock." John said sternly, pulling away and giving Sherlock his best no-nonsense frown. "I don't want you to be 'grateful' for me...putting up with you. I love you. You're a mad, impossible man who..." John smiled fondly. "...who does ridiculous things to get angry, rough sex when he could just ask...who wants to monopolize all my time and- as much as I complain about it-I'm flattered. It's...incredible...sometimes when I think about how much you love me." He cleared his throat uncomfortably and gave Sherlock another stern look. "So no more talking about being grateful, you idiot. If you want to tell me you love me...tell me that and leave out all the rest. Ok?"
online. Why did you ask me if you don't want some kind of ceremony? Thought you'd love having the world revolve around you for a day."
Rolling his eyes in reply, Sherlock tried to once again tug it off, “I can’t
John snorted. "They don't read my blog, if that's what you're getting at. Harry tells them enough to keep them worried, though. I think she does it just to be mean. She knows what mum's like." He shrugged. "Anyway, I'm off. Don't try microwaving that baboon's liver-"
A watery sigh.
. Human bodies, John. I've often wanted to experiment with his technique myself- on small animals first, of course, before I attempt anything larger. I'm sure Molly would be able to-"
Sherlock pressed closer to the door, wondering what Melissa was saying, breath coming in short little puffs as he strained to hear.
"S'fine." John gave him what he hoped was a confident grin but it felt more like a pained grimace. "You ok?"
He nearly choked when John's hand unpredictably grabbed his own and forced his long finger deep inside, twisting the axis of Sherlock's wrist so that his fingertip hit John's prostate with almost disturbing accuracy.
“Problem?” Sherlock asked even as he reached across to brush the side of John’s face, trailing the tips of his fingers along his jaw, and down his throat, digging almost instantly into the knotted, throbbing muscles with expert precision. The instant he touched John, something changed, something shifted, and it felt like the very air around them throbbed with it.
“Oh, John…oh,
bored (he'd been bored the whole time)- when John brought their still-joined hands up and kissed Sherlock's knuckles.
"I was asleep." John protested but Sherlock didn't appear to be listening to him, opening another video and tilting his head to the side as the action on the screen intensified.
Not bothering to say anything, anticipating a stubborn acknowledgement of perfect health, John grabbed Sherlock’s surprisingly cool hand, and immediately caught sight of the angry-looking, but uninfected scalpel cut on his palm.
"No, wait. Sherlock...put them on here. I want to see you."
, have you?" he asked, looking slightly perturbed.
"No, thank you." Sherlock replied snidely. John waited until Greg had left before turning to Sherlock, eyebrows raised.
John smiled, his heart turning over in his chest at Sherlock's sudden shyness. It always amazed him, he thought as he started slowly undoing the proffered buttons, lowering his head to kiss each newly exposed patch of skin, how Sherlock would provoke him and behave sluttishly in the most blatant of ways to get what he wanted- which was usually rough sex on any horizontal surface of the flat...but when he wanted something sweeter, something gentler and more loving...he lost all his nerve. He reverted back to the way he'd been the first time they had sex, when he'd been innocent and awkward, stuttering out what he wanted and blushing over saying those sorts of things out loud.
"Why am I not invited?"
"Your feet are cold." He muttered and John promptly stuck them between Sherlock's calves. He laughed, holding on to Sherlock as he bucked and hissed, churning the sheets like a restless sea as he tried to get the icy digits away from his sleep-warmed body.
"What're you doing?" John asked suspiciously, eyes narrowed. Molly's mind was suddenly inundated with the mental image of John stroking Sherlock's -what she imagined- gorgeous cock and she felt herself flushing hotly. "Sherlock, you are, right now, looking incredibly guilty." John muttered warningly. Toby, the visibly over-indulged cat, started licking his ear fondly.
John was stunned, not sure what to even think of that new information, his mind already spiralling down a not-very-pleasant train of thought- when Sherlock giggled heartily.
"Oh. Ok. Right." John nodded. "That's…that's good to know." He smiled at Sherlock, his face creasing with warmth. Sherlock smiled back at him before shifting on the sofa, letting go of John and extravagantly spreading himself in his well-worn grey T-shirt, silk pyjama bottoms and dressing gown, on the leather. He gave John what he felt was a 'come hither' look…but John only chuckled, blushing, and moved away.
The voices were louder and Sherlock, knowing the jig was up, that ignoring them would only antagonize them more, sighed and turned. The young men were loosely grouped together, a few holding broken bottles, others armed with just their bare fists.
"Oh." Sherlock blushed and his cock, trapped in the too-small briefs noticeably got harder. John grinned wickedly at him.
?" Sherlock asked, his angular face crinkled deeply in confusion.
“…Sherlock…”
John's breathing hissed out, fingers carding through Sherlock's curls, directing his head into a slow bob over his erection.
as he mapped out his body to his satisfaction. Even though he knew John would be less than cogent in his current predicament, Sherlock thought it might be conducive to get some honest answers out of him.
“You just kissed me.
"Dull." Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. "Why waste my time helping you with the suitcases when you doing it yourself gets the blood pumping. You're angry- but aroused. Good combination. Excellent things have happened when you were both angry and aroused. I can think of several new things we can try off the top of my head."
Sherlock hauled the sheet over his head completely, taking a few deep, grounding inhales, before peering out again, glancing up at the edge of the bed beside him, which seemed miles away, and cocked his head to better listen for John's breaths.
"...That's why I was late," he managed, settling back on the bed and eyeing his lover before relenting and giving Sherlock a few powerful, bruising kisses to his hip.
John stood up on fiercely protesting legs, and groaned, heading to the bedroom door in order to go and make some rejuvenating tea. He paused on the threshold to glance back at the shagged-out detective.
"Might want to pull off." He said hurriedly, tugging lightly at Sherlock's hair but Sherlock sucked his cock deeper, swirling his tongue over and over the head- and John was lost. He shouted when he came, a wordless expletive, spilling into Sherlock's mouth in short, quick bursts that left him shaking and gasping for air. He twitched and shivered through his orgasm, breathless and wordless for thirty seconds before blinking his eyes open. Sherlock's mouth was still on his cock, his eyes closed, tongue lapping up every molecule he could acquire from John's ejaculate, his hands traversing from John's body to his own temples, fingers poised in their 'Real-Life to Mind Palace transition' position.
"You okay?" John asked, extended his right hand in supplication, and wincing as he unconsciously attempted the same movement with his left hand.
"Christ, no."
"I'm going to surprise you," Sherlock replied ambiguously, still breathing hard, but eyeing his doctor ravenously. "Take it out right now. I want to see it."
John gave Sherlock a stern look and employed his brook-no-nonsense Captain's voice. "Fuck me, Sherlock. Right now. Fuck me like it's the first and last time.
Sherlock was beginning to feel the distracting and unhelpful burn of honest panic under his skin, and he struggled to keep his breathing measured, as he jerked as far away from his antagonist as possible. The man in question was remarkable in that his appearance was utterly
Even as John gritted his teeth, his expression clouding frighteningly, Sherlock appeared to calm suddenly, and raised a long, pale hand for silence. Remarkably, silence fell, and all eyes were on him.
So were the feelings: Foreign bed. Painkillers flooding his system. The deep, insistent throb in his shoulder...
"Nope...planning on it...Was planning on sucking your cock...take your trousers off."
"I know that you know you're a genius. That's not news. But I bet you don't know that you have a cute little mole behind your left ear. That you sometimes talk in your sleep. And...God, if I'm going to tell you how gorgeous you are, we'll be here all night," he laughed, before his eyes darkened. "I'll pump up your ego when we're done. Right now, I have other things on my mind. Let's keep kissing."
"Trojan horse!"
"No, no!" Sherlock threaded his fingers more gently thought John's hair, as if in apology. "It's fine. You can...do whatever you want. I won't
"I wish to..." Sherlock searched for the right phrase- then remembered John wanted him to use his own words. "I want to pleasure you manually as well and I believe the best position for that would be you lying down on the sofa." He tried to keep his voice firm and in-control, as if he knew what he were doing, and, from the way John's eyes went dark and his mouth went all pursed, Sherlock thought he achieved it.
"Sherlock, can I lay with you? This lilo's really fucking me over and to be honest, it'd be nice to hold you."
"Look, you should stop. I'm really...sensitive," John confessed, wincing in the dark, and swallowing down the little noises he needed to express at the firm and knowledgeable fingers rummaging in his muscles.
," Sherlock seethed in a delectable deep voice that made the curse sound doubly sinful. His imperfect teeth gritting, his pale aquamarine eyes struggling to stay open, Sherlock yanked needily at John's ashen hair. "Need y- up here," he heaved.
Sherlock would be above him, slicking up the insides of John's thighs, smoothing over the sensitive flesh with the added glide of lubricant. He'd avoid John's cock- of course he would, not yet, too soon- and tell him to hold his legs together so he could fuck them. And John would as Sherlock pumped in and out between them, his cock sliding against John's perineum-
Sherlock's heart-shaped mouth closed, before opening again wordlessly. He cleared his throat with a deep, strained noise that he struggled to keep under control, and spoke quietly. "You came."
Sherlock smirked at him, noticeably having enjoyed the reaction, and then pushed up to sit, “All right,” he murmured, reaching to undo his trousers with unsteady fingers. The moment they were loose and open, Sherlock sighed silently in relief and gave John a shy sort of peek as he crumpled them down his thighs and kicked them off, sitting back close in his clinging underwear and opened shirt.
Sherlock smirked at the memory, jiggling his foot, waiting until John said it was time.
“I want a muffin,” Sherlock declared quietly. Before John could respond, Sherlock nodded through the window of Speedy’s. “That young woman on the till. It’s her first day, she’s feeling pressured. Distract her, ask her questions about what products are gluten-free. I’ll grab something for you as well.”
John was going to strangle him.
"I'm just heading off anyway," he mumbled, getting to his feet.
"I don't need your fucking sympathetic mouth! I just want..." John seethed in frustration, levering himself up clumsily from the cheap armchair, his shoulder and chest protesting.
"You're a bloody narcissist," the doctor told Sherlock firmly, grinning openly. He tilted the brunette's pale angular chin towards his face for a kiss, before using his hands to pull Sherlock's body inelegantly upwards.
John continued his slow, deep, sensuous massage of Sherlock's supple back, fingering his neck with purpose, before smoothing down Sherlock's spine to his backside, which he squeezed playfully, rewarded with a strangled yelp. "Let's be brutally honest with each other right now, Sherlock. I would move heaven and earth in order to keep you with me. And I think you have full cognizance of how bloody important you are to me. As well as how incredibly gorgeous and fucking desirable you are," John winked, before smooching Sherlock softly.
John carelessly shed his dressing gown as he left the kitchen, baring himself to kith and kin, and most importantly, to one very aroused consulting detective.
, John, I just said-"
“Wait a
John heaved out a tremulous exhale, hardly bothering to hide his excitement at Sherlock's blunt, intimate pronouncements. "Well. I got you something," he murmured, going to his discarded trousers and rummaging hastily through the pockets, pulling out a few packs of various types of batteries.
“…Did you know HP sauce was named after them?”
,” he whispered, words pushed out with each rough and audible exhale. Sherlock was pliant and yielding under John’s hands for several moments, moaning lowly, lasciviously, until he began rocking back into John, his hips angled and his back muscles bundled as he met each of John’s thrusts with his own.
John ignored him, forgoing the Champagne and instead pouring a finger of Sherlock's favourite whiskey, "I
!" John jerked, not having expected Shaun to do...to do that. He squirmed as Shaun plunged his tongue past his loosened ring of muscles again and again, swallowing enthusiastically. Guttural groans and sharp, breathless gasps of air between his thighs truly bewildered the inebriated doctor. He was edging beyond 'drunk enough to enjoy and accept and remember,' and nearing the state of 'I'm not really sure what's going on but it feels alright, but now I'm getting tired.' His indigo eyes blinking heavily, he nudged at Shaun's short black hair. "Wha' you doing?"
"Struggling for air, wings fluttering feebly-"
“You revel in your debauchery.”
John was shaking his head before Sherlock said the last word and at that, he winced. "Sherlock, no. Just...don't."
He abruptly rolled over and crossed his arms intransigently.
“If you want to thank me properly, a few distinct suggestions are forming in my mind.”
"Not hungry at all? Not even something little?" John looked a tiny bit disappointed, but not particularly surprised. He scooped up a fingerful of sauce and suckled it showily, before nudging the anomalous little bowl of fortune cookies towards his petulant lover. (Actually, 'bowl' might have been an overstatement - the cookies John had ordered had in fact been deposited as artfully as possible in one of their larger mugs.)
John listened with a maddened ferocity, hearing the suspicious man groan pleasurably, and a few faint squeaks of a mattress.
“Hello boys!” she exclaimed cheerily, waving through the semi-open door.
John wasted no time in settling himself between Sherlock's legs, spreading them without decorum, and suckling lovingly on the soft skin of his testicles, his hands distantly massaging the hard, impressive muscles of the brunette's thighs.
Sherlock remained stubbornly silent beneath the duvet, but John could feel the anger radiating out from the cover.
“We can snog properly now?”
"Ung...Sherlock...oh Jesus..." John gasped, rocking his hips up to meet Sherlock's perky arse before biting back a moan. Sherlock continued to whisper in his ear, sweet nothings that made his heart flutter and groin clench. "Oh my fucking
don't have to have full sex."
"Touch yourself." John whispered, pulling back to tease at Sherlock's perineum. "Touch yourself for me."
"Turn around."
Sherlock's heart thudded in his chest, sudden dread swamping him as he waited for John to finish his words. What had he been about to say? Sherlock...or Shaun?
"Fuck! Yes!" Shaun yelped, moaning. "Yes...I'll j-just come to y-you."
!" John reached up and pulled Sherlock closer, tangling his hands in Sherlock's curls and mashing their lips together. The move almost bent him in half and John could feel his muscles protesting but the angle allowed Sherlock to go deeper, harder, faster, and he couldn't be arsed to care. He'd worry about it fucking
Sherlock opened his mouth to ask his question...but promptly shut it, losing his nerve.
, John belatedly realised. Not a tent. An actual hospital. Christ, shit must have really gone down.
your spouse already."
"Absolutely...stunning," John muttered, ravenously nipping and suckling at Sherlock's pert cupid's-bow, playfully avoiding the detective's searching kisses, instead pumping his crotch slowly, inexorably, between Sherlock's legs, hissing at the blood-hot friction of their groins.
"I...ah,
The man on screen choked on the cock, spit dribbling down his chin messily, but the hand at the back of his neck was implacable, kept the bound man forced into the position, forced him to keep sucking.
"Well?" John asked, nicking a wedge of Sherlock's muffin. "Tell me."
Turning away, John stretched indulgently, adding in an elaborate, staged groan, much like the other night when Sherlock had been wanking beside him in the dark, and calmly plugged in the old CD player that dwelled behind Sherlock's armchair. He turned it on, knowing that if they were going to do what he was planning on them doing, he didn't want Mrs. Hudson's breakfast disturbed. The music would hopefully drown them out.
Without another word, Sherlock pushed open the door and swept upstairs.
He still couldn't resist peering one eye down at his own chest and abdomen, despite the knowledge that he hadn't been penetrated by a bullet. He attempted to glance upwards, towards his saviour, but was blind-sided by the image of his captor's arterial blood pulsing out over his crotch, drenching his underwear, a deathly-pale head smacking lifelessly down upon his thighs.
"...John," he said, only a little above a whisper. "What about you?"
From his position, curled in the bed, he could hear the shower running and made a moue of discontent that John had already left the bed, that he would be prevented from morning cuddles- something he would deny he loved to anyone who asked. He listened to the sounds of John showering, drifting in and out of sleep, but perked up when he heard the water cut off.
"We could always try that dirty talk thing from last night." John spread his legs, still working his hand under the duvet, getting harder the more Sherlock's eyes darted down, almost without his volition, staring at the movement like an impatient cat.
“No you won’t,” Sherlock said in a somewhat arrogant tone, sliding closer with a huff of soft amusement. “You’re a cuddler, John Watson.”
“No. How can you ask me that? You saw me moments ago when you put the light on. Did I look naked to you?” Sherlock huffed between a short, quick series of chuckles. “I only sleep naked in the summer—Well, actually, I should say that I typically sleep naked in the summer. I don’t always.”
“Sherlock, you don’t stand for anything except self-glorification.”
was not enough. Perhaps it was his own denial, but there was a snippet of doubt, a niggle in the back of his mind that he hadn't quite put all the pieces together correctly. Maybe some external input would be useful.
"And exactly when was the date of conception?" Sherlock only blinked irritably at the smart clip round the head that John gave him. "Sorry, John was domestically abusing me. Continue."
After a few minutes, there were no further sounds from next door and Molly had decided to quietly retrieve her laptop from across the room when-
…” He huffed out a small, throaty chuckle, and bent his legs up with a roll of his hips, arching his spine.
"No, you just want something up your arse," John muttered, already turning away. "Really, just...just fuck off."
"S'very nice. Get your penis out."
"Why can't I?...Oh...does it not...please you if I talk?" Sherlock asked, beginning to make tenuous plans in his Mind Palace for extra-strong, bedroom scenario brain-to-mouth filters, if need be.
Before John could start to argue on the inappropriateness of keeping fruit in a morgue, Sherlock shoved their trolley back down the aisle. "Might as well stock up on other things while we're here, John. What do they call the sex section these days? 'Personal items?' 'Intimate cosmetics? Where's the lube?" He gave John a cheeky wink over his shoulder.
“Oh. Well then. Good.” Sherlock cleared his throat and sat up straighter, but he cast a sidelong and still semi-suspicious eye at the smaller man nevertheless.
John's expression hardens and he gets up, walking to the coat rack angrily. "Clearly you want to be alone. I'll be at
I see a flash of gold in the corner of my eye, followed by blue. Ah. It's already starting then. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, I may as well enjoy my last high.
Doesn't matter now.
After having a cup of tea and a piece of toast, I hear the door open quietly. John doesn't acknowledge me as he gets a cup of tea. "Morning." I say quietly to him as I put my cup into the sink.
John realized a few things as he talks with Sara.
I know someone wouldn't me find this time.
I woke up when the nurses tried to come in that morning, hitting my barricade as I held onto his hand even tighter. I pleaded for him to wake up, my heart caught in my throat. I at least wanted to stay with him for as long as I can, even if he couldn't wake up and if this is the only way I can stay then so be it. I held onto his hand like it was my life line as I heard the nurses panicking on the other side of the door, I just wished I had more time with him.
I nod my head slowly and take a moment to compose myself enough to form words. "Fine, I'm fine. Just... I didn't think that..."
"Alright?" John asks softly, taking our now empty plates to the kitchen. Funny, I don't remember finishing.
"Never said I was, John." His name feels odd on my tongue. Wait. I know that look on his face. He's about to do something impulsive.
I don't know what I'm doing and I don't even know what to title the chapters, so if you have any ideas for chapter titles feel free to tell me. And as always kudos and comments are appreciated.
Sherlock just calmly opened his eyes.
I didn't want it to stop until he was awake.
But I was glad for it.
"I do know that. There's a way soul mates move around each other and talk, with you two that isn't it." Am I getting angry, it sounds like it.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, just come back! Like you did before, right? This is just some cruel trick!"
I've always hated this bloody soul mate system, doesn't help that my mark is so noticeable even before I met John. I mean, a black dot about the size of your fist over your chest is pretty noticeable even with this system.
John left a note, isn't that what people do, leave a note?
He seemed to be trying to take a deep breath.
I heard the door opening from where I was on the couch.
I storm out of the flat so Sherlock will realize he needs to actually work out his problems and not just let them fester until he can't work them out anymore. I hail a cab and only talk to the cabbie to tell him where I'm going, trying to seem like I don't want to talk.
"Morning Sherlock. Look I'm... I'm sorry that I stormed out yesterday." John says hesitantly as he gets a cup of tea.
"I honestly don't see why you are so angry about it, I kept them out of the way of food and they are in bags."
"Into battle."
"No, it's not. You're at a vulnerable point and need someone to talk to about your soulm-"
"Worth a try, wasn't it?" The vision of him becomes blurry, but his smile is as clear as ever. God it was beautiful.
"That's not what I'm trying to do at all, I just want to help you work through this Sherlock. You need to tell him." John's staying unbearably calm through this, his tone like he's trying to soothe a small child in a clinic and goddamnit it's almost working.
There was another fight in 221b that day, Sherlock couldn't really remember what it was about in all honesty, either that or he just deleted it as soon as he could. But he remembered yelling, oh yes, it was about severed fingers in a plastic bag. Sherlock thought he was being considerate, he kept it in a bag and away from the food. He didn't really see the problem. But John did. Sherlock fiddled with the syringe in his hand and thought back to what else happened that morning.
For the past week he just shook his head.
"Why, you can clearly see she isn't the one. Just ask her, I think she knows it to." It's the truth, and it probably hurts.
"You're not a good liar, you know." He puts the plates in the sink and comes back out again, sitting across from me, unconsciously mirroring my position.
John was finding it harder to keep calm, he knew both of them were being prats but he just couldn't bring himself to care.
Now I heard a voice, but I couldn't understand it. I couldn't understand anything beyond his petting, like he was beckoning me to him farther into the water like a siren. Too late to turn back now anyway. So I waded into the stream and let go.
"For what? You were trying to spare me the heartache. I would thank you but it might encourage you to do that to other people." He smiles at me and chuckles, and when I look at him questioningly he smiles even brighter. "I'm fine, really, I just... I don't know what to do now."
I walk into the bedroom and look at Sara's half asleep form, nightshirt hanging off her shoulder. My eyes try to focus on the designs on her chest only to find nothing.
"Who... who is it?" He seemed almost sad, or timid. I couldn't tell from his tone.
"Do you need something?" I move the door slightly to keep him from seeing so much of my torso. He still seemed to be dazed while he stared and slowly dragged his eyes up to lock with my own.
Flatline.
"I don't think so, can't we just leave this off and get to why you came down here?" I will deny till the day I die that was a whine.
"John, we both know this isn't exactly important or as you say, eating at me. You're just curious." My comment doesn't exactly come out as harsh as I want seeing as I'm facing the couch back and curled up like a child, but I try.
"I'm sorry Sherlock, I love you. I'll be with you soon."
Drumming into my skull.
It takes me a few moments but I (clumsily) kiss back. This is what I've been waiting for my entire life, this release, this... catharsis. I now understand why people are so happy just... like this.
It's been nearly a year since that case, that bullet left him in a coma. The doctors wouldn't allow me to visit, no matter how much I pleaded with them, visiting was limited to family. Mycroft visited once a week, and if I asked he would tell me if Sherlock was any closer to waking up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now we wait.
I take a moment to gather up my words and my courage to ask a question. "Do you, I mean, are you-"
"Oh, so now I'm difficult to deal with? How do you deal with yourself every day then? Pretty well, I assume since I think you're the only one that doesn't find you to be an absolute arse. You know, I think more people would at least try to tolerate you if you stopped being such a freak and acted normal for once!"
John closed his eyes and looked away from his, currently insufferable, flatmate.
"He. And I don't know, he gets really irritated and won't tell me. Apparently his soulmate doesn't know they're soulmates." I say with a tinge of sympathy for him, taking a sip of tea. "I'd hate to be in his position.
John's face fell as he sighed, kneeling beside the sofa and taking Sherlock's hand, gripping it tight. "I want you to say whatever you feel you need to say, okay? I want to hear you tell me you're not comfortable, or if something hurts. I want to hear you tell me to stop if you need it or tell me exactly what you want, what feels good. I want to hear the noises you make when you're so far gone you can't even vocalise anything except 'yes' and my name." He grinned. "But I
Sherlock shrugged, wrapping his hand back around John's slickened length. "Rarely. Last night was the first time I had felt the urge to do so in...six months."
Sherlock snorted, feeling a pang that John wasn't going to use him. He wanted more data, more experimentation to figure out why he'd enjoyed it…but he shoved it to the side when John, still looking contrite, knelt and kissed him, curling his hand around Sherlock's now-soft penis through his trousers.
"Yes." John breathed fervently, grinding his cock against Sherlock's hip. "Yes. Fuck yes. Take me to bed."
Sherlock looked flummoxed, his mouth open, eyes wide and blinking and he let John tug the sheet away from him, sliding it down his body, revealing him in all his naked glory with a flourish. Sherlock's nipples hardened in the cool air and his hands fluttered nervously, obviously wanting to cover himself up. John loosely clasped his wrists, preventing him.
This is the penultimate chapter, and it's short and super-fluff XD
By the time the kettle had boiled, a small spread had been placed on the table consisting of a delicate tea set and the rest of the cheesecake. Sherlock helped himself to another slice as his landlady set down a tea pot and joined him on the opposite chair.
"Maybe not." Sherlock grinned, sliding his foot beneath the table until it encountered John's leg. John narrowed his eyes as Sherlock toed off his shoe and inched his socked foot up, up, up John's leg. John couldn't help giggling, his face creasing in honest amusement as he tried to maintain his sultry composure while Sherlock’s toes kneaded at his thigh.
"I..." Sherlock cleared his throat nervously, musician's fingers twiddling with his silverware, making the spoon and fork clink and chime together loudly. "A...a..." Sherlock brought one hand up to toy with his bottom lip and John's eyes jumped down to the movement. He smiled in understanding.
"I'd like to see you try." Came the low, unmistakable rumble, laced with bitter resentment. The tiniest tremor caused the heavy duvet to quiver slightly as it cocooned Sherlock's long, lithe frame. It must have been practically suffocating him in the muggy heat of London.
Looking up after a few moments, John flushed, looking a little sheepish. "I can taste your heartbeat," he said softly.
"He wanted to eat my...my...."
. What the guy had done with his hands… What could he do with his mouth, John wondered, before blushing and realising that he was actually, seriously entertaining the notion.
"He's been living under my roof the past few months- I think I know a good deal about him." Mrs. Hudson protested, crossing her arms. "Now. What is this about, Sherlock?"
Sherlock nipped his bottom lip carefully, his eyes glittering dangerously up at John, and John was immediately worried. Sherlock chuckled naughtily and wriggled ever closer to his doctor in the hot gloom under the delightfully-stifling red blanket to whisper in his ear. "I have an even bigger one," he admitted in a fiendish whisper.
"John." He whispered again, thrilled when John's mouth turned up into a sleepy smile at the sound of Sherlock's voice...but remained steadfastly, annoyingly asleep.
He smiled around his mouthful of cock, loving his ability to make Sherlock go breathless, stealing his words away with the smallest of licks.
“You’ve wrecked my life, but against all logic and reason, I can’t bear to be rid of you.”
, as his special guest-"
"John, hold my hands please," Sherlock beseeched, his spidery white fingers grasping for John's. "Could you have sex with me without your hands?" he chuckled, his dark curls troubling a gorgeous pale brow.
"Course I think about sex, what kind of man would I be if I didn't?" Greg laughed again, wiping his chin with his palm. "I meant whether I'm attractive or whatever. Back when I was younger, I knew I was good-looking, you know? It all went kinda soft the past couple of years." Greg tapped his belly briefly before picking up his drink again, feeling a little uneasy discussing his personal views - even though the beer was certainly helping him 'open up'.
John's jaw fell open slightly, his brow crinkling. "Is this…? For me?" he asked rather redundantly, fingers already tracing his own initials in awe.
Unlike his partner, John didn't feel the urge to rummage through other people's things on a regular basis, and therefore he'd never pried into this particular drawer. Sherlock might have had this toy for years, for all he knew.
He panicked briefly as Sherlock's strong, heavy hips bucked, his thigh muscles flexed and jerked, and a deep, throaty shriek sounded out somewhere above him, but he managed to hold on to his detective through his brief, violent climax. He nipped and kissed at Sherlock's inner thighs, massaging his backside and hips, as the detective came down with massive, heaving, noisy gasps, swallowing deeply every few seconds, all his muscles twitching with exertion.
“You don’t seem to get much physical pleasure out of anything. Food, sleep. You don’t like being touched. You don’t date. Stands to reason you wouldn’t waste your time on orgasms.”
"You taste like me." He whispered reverently, fingers tracing the swell of John's lips. John snorted.
John swallowed thickly, aroused beyond belief at the sight of Shaun's anus clenched around him. His own prick pulsed, bobbed between his legs in want, and he licked his lips, wanting to bend down and lick around the stretched, taut, skin but afraid of hurting Shaun by moving.
Stepping out of the flat onto a bright, sun-baked pavement, John glanced back at a faint noise of discomfort as Sherlock pulled the door closed behind him, frowning down at his hand. As the detective straightened and turned to face him, his expression was schooled into exactly the sort of blank calm that never failed to tell John that Sherlock was hurt.
Sherlock was drifting into a comfortably dreamless doze when his phone beeped noisily from his trouser pocket. Groaning, he dragged his upper body from the bed, scrabbled for it in the crumpled mass of expensive fabric, and retrieved it. John glanced at him and huffed at the sight of his naked hips and legs anchored on the bed, whilst he balanced awkwardly on one hand on the carpet.
John jogged upstairs, grinning to himself at the novelty of running around the flat completely naked, and soon returned to his detective, promptly hauling himself onto the bed in one smooth movement, landing mouth-to-mouth on Sherlock, pump-bottle in hand.
John honestly had to think for a few seconds about what Sherlock was talking about before it hit him. Then, his eye widened and his cock, which had been mostly soft and lax, twitched. "Oh. I thought you said you didn't-"
