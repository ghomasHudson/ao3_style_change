Steve’s eyebrows and his shoulder lift in the universal sign of “yeah, so?”
to wear the suit to dinner. Why didn’t I wear the suit to dinner?” Tony bends forward, pressing his palms to his legs and ducking his head between his knees, sucking in short, harsh breaths. He can see the headlines now,
The red on Steve’s cheeks spreads quickly to every inch of skin on display, and, Tony hopes, all the parts that aren’t.
“Tony…”
Steve’s toothpick arms tremble alarmingly as he struggles to push himself to a sitting position. He sighs tiredly. “Gone back to wherever it was before it became the rest of me in the first place, I suppose.” He rubs his eyes, blearily.
Tony’s hands cup Steve’s ass, taking his weight as he stands, swallowing down the soft gasp of surprise as he carries them toward the elevator. He can spare thirty seconds of their twenty minutes to return to his room, where he can take Steve apart properly on his king-sized bed. Steve’s legs lock around Tony’s waist, grinding desperately against his belly, and Tony almost abandons his plan in exchange for taking him up against the wall of the elevator. He breaks the kiss with a gasp. “...Fuck, Steve, if you keep that up, you’re going to kill
Tony groans as Steve grinds in his lap, the lithe
. It was
Steve rolls his shoulders before pitching forward, a thin arm emerging from the blankets, reaching for a tissue. He blows his nose into it loudly before tossing it atop the small, white mountain on the table in front of the couch. Tony grimaces, silently calculating how many germs are currently crawling through Mount Kleenex.
Steve’s face is so close to his, that the rush of air carrying his words brushes over Tony's lips like a warm caress as Steve murmurs, “I’m always off-balance around you, Stark.”
Steve nods. “Looks like.”
Tony’s eyes flicker open, zeroing in on the way Steve’s teeth are trapping his lower lip in some kind of obliviously erotic gesture.
overreacting, this is the perfect amount of reacting. Is there anything else I should know? Any other ailments I need to prepare for?” He can feel his heartbeat picking up pace in his chest, racing his brain toward the hazy shape of a panic attack looming large in the distance.
“Why the hell did you put robots in your medicine?”
“Are you sure you’re up to this, Tony? If you’re still--”
“Are you okay?”
Steve’s gaze traces Tony’s. He frowns at the slow-moving objects in question. He pinches an animated tissue between his fingers, bringing it to eye level. Tony grimaces as Steve shakes his crumpled, white prize, expecting the worst, but when nothing untoward falls from its folds, Tony’s face relaxes.
Tony shifts his weight on anxious feet, trying, but failing, to accept that the small figure drowning in a sea of blankets is, in fact, Steve Rogers, and not some dial-a-twink skilled in impersonations, called in by Barton just to mess with his mind.
“Careful, Stark. People will think you’re a genius if you keep up those astounding feats of observation.”
Tony’s eyes jerk straight up to Steve’s. “I - uh - what?”
Tony blinks incredulously. “Seriously? You have ripped tree trunks in half with your bare hands and pulled a helicopter from the sky, but you can’t open a water bottle?”
“I don’t remember, I was drunk."
Oh, god. Clint is suddenly at the crossroads of trying to decide whose wrath he fears more: the hulking national treasure and the tin man’s or Nat’s. He sighs. There’s really no contest. He thumbs open the SI app linked to his hearing aid, and presses the purple and white target icon to start the recording.
“Has to be. If it’s not wet, it’s not good.”
The gears in Clint's head, lubricated by his extremely active imagination, pick up speed. His eyes go wide as he fumbles in his pocket for his phone.
“Tony?”
A small shiver runs through Steve’s body, making him shake like a leaf on an active fault line. He pulls the blanket more tightly around him, and Tony frowns. It’s hardly arctic in here, but what little of Steve’s skin he can see looks waxy and,
. I just wanted to know what to do when it happened again. I wanted to be able to help.”
“If you really are
. You can’t just blow things up in Canada.”
“Asthma!” Tony jolts to his feet, wincing at the high pitched note of panic ringing loud in his voice. He clears his throat. “Since when do you have asthma?”
“I can’t lie and say I haven’t been waiting for this day. Or, hoping for it at the very least. Hardcore hoping. And dreaming. Lots of dreaming, and very often the liquid variety.”
Steve rubs his nose with his free hand. “Must have been a draught.”
Bucky’s face winks up at him.
Clint’s thumb bounces across the screen as he grins broadly.
He ignores the thirst emojis.
Steve clears his throat --a rough, uncomfortable sound-- and rubs his fingers over his neck. “You’re a pain in the ass.”
The small laugh from Steve becomes a loud, wracking cough. Tony closes the distance to the couch with three large strides, perches atop the mess of blankets, and rubs Steve’s back awkwardly. He tries to ignore the unfamiliar feel of bones pressing out where there used to be endless swells of muscle. The coughing subsides but leaves a dragging wheeze in its wake.
Tony can feel his eyes edging wider as each new entry of
“Twenty minutes, give or take.”
Tony curls his fingers around the bottle and frowns down at it with vision that is darkening around the edges. “You’re seriously at me to hydrate right now?”
“What? I think we can both agree that this was almost entirely your fault. It was on my
“You really don’t know?” Steve’s voice is soft, and his eyes waver like they want to fix on anything but Tony.
The flashing inside the bottle stops, and Tony carries it over to the couch and holds it out, victoriously. “Told you. Easy.”
Tony pushes Steve back, grinning as he falls on his ass and his back thuds against the wall of the lift, soft strands of hair flopping down over his forehead. Tony surges forward, climbs onto Steve, and seats himself on ridiculously thick thighs.
Steve bites his lip a moment before answering. “It was a bit saltier than I was expecting.”
territory?”
“Is this actually,
Steve’s large hand comes up to rub at the back of his neck. “Is it always so… wet?”
Steve’s glassy eyes are looking the wrong side of wild - feverish, and filled with entirely too much self-satisfaction. “I couldn’t sleep. I was going to watch some television, but, uh, Bucky and Clint had already commandeered the couch for other purposes, so I came down here.” The blanket-burrito shifts up as he shrugs. “I was feeling a bit queasy from dinner, so I had some of the pink stomach stuff you’re always sipping on. I was feeling a bit warm so I stripped and crashed on the couch. And then… this.”
“Well, should I expect the cutting edge tech to stop doing whatever it’s doing before it kills me? Or is my death certificate going to read,
As Steve's fingers wrap around him, Tony’s brain glitches. Sweat beads his hairline, his vision fills with static, and his heart is doing hurdles in his chest - all the usual warning signals that herald an impending meltdown. But this time, he’s pretty sure the only melting that’s about to take place is his brain liquefying and getting pumped out of his dick by
“You tell me. I give you blanket permission to lay your hands on me and find out,” Tony murmurs, noticing how fetching Steve looks with that splash of red high on his cheekbones.
Tony bends quickly, retrieves the blanket and throws it back at Steve. “Yes, yeah. Right. It’s just big, I mean, we have big, uh, bigger problems then.... Huh. Sorry, what am I doing? And why do you find the current conversation so…stimulating?”
Bucky’s message pops up followed by three knife emojis.
“Tony! We can’t --”
it was about turning us into their little puppets to use as they pleased. It's not
"No! Steve, hey, don't say that!" Tony immediately cut in after Steve's confession. "You're so much more than that. You're selfless, brave, passionate, infuriating sometimes but in the best way possible. Fighting doesn't define you. Your heart does!"
To distract from his sudden shame, Steve actually dared to trail his fingers along Tony's crotch. He gently brushed his knuckles over the tip of Tony's erection, teasing him, until finally wrapping his whole hand around it. He pumped a few times, from bottom to the tip, circling the tip with his thumb to spread the wetness all over. "Steve! Your hand!" Tony groaned, bucking his hips into the tight heat of Steve's palm. The blond pressed just a bit harder, making Tony moan out his name once more. His free hand reached for the lube and Steve squeezed some of it on Tony's length, the rest on his hand. He went back to jerking Tony off, the liquid making everything so much better, easier. Steve teased every vein, alternated in pressure and flicked his wrist around the top. His free hand went down to fondle with Tony's balls. They felt heavy in his palm, fitting right there. Steve was fully concentrating on the task at hand for a few minutes, until Tony tensed up. "Yeah you're gonna have to stop now, big guy." he breathed out, surprisingly still very articulate. Steve let go off Tony's dick, not wanting him to come yet. They had more in mind.
"That's not true," he choked out, "It's not—"
"Wanna talk about it? 'Bout what you saw?"
The house was unassuming. Quintessential white suburban mom exterior— a brick porch, a barely off-white vinyl, good curb appeal. It was the type of house where you wouldn't be pressed to see children playing in the front yard, laughing as they ran through sprinklers, their parents, most likely named Bob and Sheryl, watching on fondly. Maybe a sign in the corner of the lawn that would say to vote for the Republican governor. Or something like that.
Tony laced on his last shoe, before he opened the door, paused, and walked out— the door closing with a pointed click, leaving Steve behind. It was the afternoon at that point, the cool air wafting against his still heated skin.
"Oh fuck you," Steve spat, and woah, he was right up close and personal, caging Tony against the door, "The Accords are just to control us and you know it. It was never about
"You know I'm not gonna make fun of it. I'm just worried about you."
After cleaning himself off with a towel and some water, Steve wet a washcloth and walked back to Tony on the bed. He gently wiped along his chest, down to his crotch and then lifted Tony's legs slightly to clean his entrance as well. The sight of his own come drooping out of Tony made his mouth water, cock jolt in an attempt to get hard again. He had to resist pushing the come back in with his finger.
slid inside, somehow thicker and
"Nope."
Steve didn't deign to respond, and only huffed in amusement. His lips trailed hot, wet trails down to his nipple, sucking the nub in, laving his tongue over the hardening peak.
Tony slid his arm through the arm-hole of his shirt, and glared, "Don't tempt me, Rogers."
Tony hated it.
He wanted more. He was so close, so close, "Fill me up with your cum, mark me, c-claim me—"
"Impatient" Steve tsked, shaking his head as his finger teased the puckered hole.
"Y-you feel so good inside me," he gasped, the heat in his abdomen and groin coiling. His ass felt loose, gaping,
That was Tony's first impression. Or well, that was a lie. His first impression was simply a feeling of wariness, of his hackles raising and body tensing— because he still remembered
He slowly peeled himself away from the door, forcing his legs to cooperate. He pushed past Steve, ignoring the searing pain as he grabbed a rag from one of the baskets in the kitchen. He wiped away the mess from his face, chest, and ass before throwing it into the nearby trash can. Steve zipped up his pants.
Steve's brows furrowed in anguish, and he opened his mouth, but Tony interrupted him, "It's fine." His breath hitched, "I don't know what I would've done in your position, maybe I would've done the same. But… we're over. We can't pretend that this didn't happen. Just— leave me alone, please."
Now… what now? Did he just have to go back to how it was before though?
Tony whimpered. It felt strange, a dizziness overcoming him and melding with the need. He then started spitting out whatever saliva formed, and it dripped down his chin, making a mess of himself and
Steve leaned in further, towering over Tony with his height and bulk but for some reason, the inventor didn't feel overwhelmed. At least, in a way he didn't want. Steve's other hand fidgeted, before resting lightly on Tony's hip. His thumb caressed his cheekbone.
It was quiet again, and Tony felt unease trickle up his spine.
His way down continued, by kissing along the skin around the reactor, Tony's abdomen, his hip, the V shape before the hem of his pants. Steve hooked his fingers underneath them, as well as Tony's boxers. "Can I?" he breathed out, his dazed eyes searching for Tony's in the darkness, only slightly lit up by the faint blue glow coming from Tony's chest.
Now it was Steve's turn to be dumbstruck. "Love language?"
Tony shut up once he saw Steve spit into his hand again, and then reach down, only this time not to his ass. The wet noises were obscene, echoing throughout the hallway as Steve stroked his own cock. But then, he stiffened, looking down at Tony with an indiscernible expression.
God, it stung. It really did. Tony didn't even want to talk about it, he wanted to act as if it never happened. Steve was… He was so happy last night, fulfilled. He 𝘸𝘢𝘴𝘯'𝘵 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘭𝘺. Yet he didn't press for any answers. He couldn't do that to Tony and really, he couldn't fight with what would essentially be a broken heart.
"Yeah?" Steve panted, and Tony licked his lips, whimpered, watching as a bead of sweat dripped down Steve's neck. He wanted to lick it up, taste his neck and bite his own marks into the porcelain skin.
"I'm gonna kill you if you stop now, gorgeous." Tony argued, lifting his hips demonstratively. Not wanting to aggravate Tony, Steve slid the last pieces of clothing off of Tony's body, but right before he could throw it Tony sat up to grab Steve's wrist. "Back pocket." Tony mumbled, pointing his head at the jeans he wore just a few moments ago. Steve reached inside to feel a little tube. He pulled it out and that was…
Steve sighed, and before Tony could scowl two long fingers pressed against his lips, sliding down his mouth and into his throat. He gagged for a moment, before he moaned around the digits.
Steve spat in his hand again, and pressed his fingers inside. It wasn't enough, even the girth of three fingers not enough to satisfy the emptiness inside. Once Steve slid out, he could only clench needily on the copious amounts of saliva. He could hear the small splatters as Tony dripped, from his ass or cock— he didn't know, onto the floor, "You've done it before."
Everything turned white. Tony screamed out his release, convulsing in Steve's arms of thick ropes of cum shot out of his dick, making a mess of both their chests. Steve moaned quietly, before his thrusts turned even more erratic. One thrust, two thrusts, and then Steve had to lean against Tony to hold himself up, practically collapsing.
The kiss had an entirely different quality to it now, just as passionate but now full of a visceral need. It was rougher, their teeth clacking against the other, and there was the coppery tang of blood now. Tony couldn't tell who's lips they were from at this point, they felt too interconnected.
At first Steve was shocked to hear all that from Tony. When they first met they insulted each other and now Tony gave him all these compliments, seemingly out of nowhere. Then his stomach started fluttering, butterflies letting loose. "Do you really think that?" Steve asked quietly, his gaze averted down, unable to look into Tony's bright eyes. Until hands suddenly cupped his cheeks and forced him to look up into those deep oceans of liquid gold. Tony's eyes were gorgeous, easy to lose yourself in.
"Tony, we don't have lube."
A heavy breath escaped the genius, a fierce pain now radiating from his lower back. It intensified as soon as Steve carefully lowered him down, and he only had his shaky legs and the wall to keep standing. His pants subsided, his pounding heart rate slowing, and all that was left was… regret. His body ached, his heart ached, and by God he wanted to smack the concerned expression off Steve's face.
"Is this what you want?" Steve asked, a hint of need in his tone, a need for an affirmative answer. He didn't wait for it though, and he leaned down to suck at Tony's collarbone, at the bruises there, at the ones that are obviously a day or so old, "Not a scratch, huh?" he murmured, voice reproachful. A finger traced the marks, before they went back down to Tony's ass, caressing and squeezing him through the jeans.
"That frown tells me you're still gonna need some time to think." Clint retorted, grabbing one of the sandwiches and handing it to Steve. He thanked him half heartedly, before biting into it dutifully. There was no appetite right now, but he needed something in his stomach. Who knew when they'd have to fight once again. There wouldn't be any time to make a 'feast worthy of mighty warriors such as the Avengers' as Thor had suggested. Laura quickly made sure to dismiss those thoughts, telling Thor to stay away from her fridge.
"They aren't scratches," Tony gasped, "Didn't lie." His nails dug into the soldier's back.
And not even a second later, the door opened. Tony startled, face to face with Captain America, the golden boy himself, Steve Rogers.
However, it couldn't last, especially when Steve shifted, and Tony winced as it jostled his sore rim. The cold returned.
"Yeah," Tony whispered back, "Take this off," he demanded, gripping at Steve's shirt, "Right fucking now. I need to see you."
aching with the need to be loved, to be cared for. It would hurt all the more because this taste, this sample of affection, no matter how brutal would stand to tease him of the unattainable.
he felt so dirty. Steve was enraptured though, watching him like he was the only thing in the universe.
"I don't care," Tony stressed, "Fuck me Rogers.” Steve's lips thinned.
It was wet, was the first thing Tony's molasses-slow mind came up with. Slow, but deep, an exploration and a desperation to taste and to cherish. It was quite salty, too, tears making its way between their lips and the saliva. Steve gave a low sob, and his hand clenched tighter on Tony's hip, only to lift him up, and press him flush against the door. The hand on his cheek left to hold him up by his buttocks— Tony had no choice but to wrap his legs around his waist. Steve pressed closer, pinning the genius against the wood with his strength.
Promptly found Tony pacing around in an uncharacteristic nervous manner. "Steve, there you are. I was just wondering what side of the bed you wanted to have, because I don't really mind. I never really had a side you know, I usually just sleep in the middle of the bed and it's a lot bigger too usually, so people would fit on my side nonetheless but-"
Either way, it wasn't good. Especially since the only message was to meet at this location— at an eerily pristine house straight out of a sitcom.
There was a moment of silence, but then Rogers broke it with a ragged breath. Steve's face crumpled, and Tony gritted his teeth, hating the way that the expression tugged on his heart strings. Like a fucking kicked puppy. Tony could never say no to that look, and that was the problem.
"Fuck me," he said breathlessly, trying his best to push into the touches on his ass, but he had no leverage, "Come on, fuck me Rogers."
"Just accept it." Tony sighed, gently patting Steve's shoulder. The blond let out a huff, but nodded. It was no use arguing to Tony about things like that. There would never be an end to that.
he wrapped his hand around Tony's cock. He didn't need any lube, the mess of precum leaking out of his dick more than enough.
After a few more minutes, some deep breathing and also turning off the lights, Steve finally walked inside of his temporary room and…
Then there was light.
like Steve's cock belonged in him, opening him wide and making room in what felt like his
Tony's face reddened at the obvious squelching noises. He buried his face in Steve's chest, panting hard, letting out the occasional moan. His nails scratched down his back as he grappled for any sort of grip. Merciless, Steve's fingers went right back to his prostate and his world was enveloped in flames, in pleasure.
Steve let out a predatory growl, and holy fuck that was the hottest thing Tony had ever heard. He shook, and oh god he was close, he was so close. He tightened around Steve, almost painfully, breath leaving him in a pained exhale as he curled in on himself.
Hopefully the droplet on his cheek was sweat rather than a tear. He doubted it.
Tony pulled away, entering a living room that vaguely looked like a grandma threw up on it. An inhale, exhale, and somehow his voice was still shaky, "What do you want, Rogers?"
Tony suddenly felt tired, slumping against the door-frame, "That's just it, Steve. You didn't trust me."
"Hot damn," he said, awed. Steve looked down at Tony with an uncomfortably soft expression. The atmosphere died a little.
“Very good, Captain Rogers.”
“You talk too much.”
Steve rocks forward again, catching his mouth. Tony moans into the kiss as slender arms encircle his neck and tug him closer. Steve tastes exactly the same, as it turns out.
“Maybe that’s the plan, Stark. To take my revenge on you for turning me into a science experiment.” He rolls his hips again just as the elevator opens to Tony’s room.
He presses send and turns his attention back to the couch.
“1918.”
Tony’s laugh carries to him easily. “You’re being too hard on yourself. You did fine. You just need a little practice.”
” hangs in the air between them.
“Of course, sir. Consider it done.”
“Tony, no, I --
Steve pushes the blanket off Tony’s lap and takes its place. “Hmm, then you give and I’ll take. It’s the least you can do after almost killing me.”
Steve’s face falls, and Tony has the decency to feel a little bad. He sinks down next to Steve, takes the bottle, breaks the seal, and hands it back. Steve turns his baby blues Tony’s way, a begrudging
“How are you feeling? Any better?”
Steve nods.

is added to the list. He's grateful when Steve trails off,
“How about this time I help you? Just open your mouth and I’ll put it in for you.”
Clint watches the app’s soundwave graphic pulse on his screen as Tony’s smooth voice sounds from the couch, travels through his hearing aid and is captured in his phone.
Wringing his hands together, Tony mutters, “It might.” He doesn’t need the suit to assess his bio-data and let him know that, no, he’s very, very
Steve flops back on the couch. “I would like to register some concerns.”
The reassuring warmth disappears from his hand, and Tony barely resists the impulse to reach out and grab it back, because wow, that would be embarrassing. Steve reaches into the bag slung low around his hip, retrieving a rectangular foil package and a small bottle of water. Tony’s eyes feel wild and flittery, like ocular hummingbirds, as they dart around the small box that is getting smaller by the second. The sound of Steve cracking what Tony now realizes is an icepack, activating the endothermic reaction, makes him wince. His focus catches on Steve’s hands as he continues his sharp ascent into hyperventilation.
. Seizing the thread of denial with two hands and pulling desperately, Tony’s eyes narrow.
Steve struggles back to an upright position and eyes the bottle suspiciously.
Tony smiles, his eyes flickering over the test results as they compile on the holoscreen. He moves to his computer. His fingers fly over the keyboard, reworking the bot code. “Sushi is high in Omega-3, which is essential for optimal brain function, which is how I was able to come up with G-TEN in the first place. It’s going to, eventually, be able to chomp down on Banner’s DNA and temporarily ix-nay the ulk-Hay, should the need arise. Much easier than dealing with the whole HulkBuster suit, the maintenance on that is ridiculous.” Tony picks up the Pepto-bottle, pops the cap and peers inside. A soft glow of white light rolls over the tiny pink specks: the firmware update being uploaded into their tiny circuit heads. “It turns out my itty, bitty bots like the taste of the particularly super portion of your super-soldier DNA, too. But it’s an easy fix, there’s no cause for concern.”
Steve shakes his head, his eyes opening, the wheeze finally fading from his chest. He hesitates, eyes sliding from Tony’s before answering. “Nothing that should be a problem.”
“You weren’t talking about… uh, oh.” Clint scratches behind his ear and cocks his head. “But… wet and salty? Sliding down your throat?”
Tony jolts into action, spinning on his heel and retreating to the refrigerator, glad he had gone with the full-sized, entirely impractical cooling device for his workshop over the tiny barely-fits-two-cheeseburgers-inside-at-the-same-time contraption Pepper had suggested. Sticking his face into the cold box, he sighs at the brief respite for his panic-filled face before grabbing a bottle of water. He pushes the door closed before returning to Steve, and pressing the water into the jumble of blankets. Small hands snake out and grasp it before twisting uselessly over the cap.
“Yeah.”
Steve is suddenly extremely interested in the tissue in question, but Tony thinks his cheeks look a little brighter than a moment ago. And damned if he isn’t seven shades of adorable when he blushes like that. Tony’s smile pushes higher as he comes and takes the tissue from Steve’s grasp.
know.”
territory without brakes or airbags.” A slight tremor is the only warning he gets before his legs buckle, and he's sliding down the elevator wall to the floor.
Steve’s eyelids fall closed, his absurd lashes fanning out over his skin: the only thing apparently not affected by the mysterious smallification. He sucks in a slow, calculating breath as he nods. “Just asthma.”
Tony can't help but revel in the fact the virtue of patience has rewarded him his biggest vice - the one that is working on sucking a bruise into his neck with eager lips, setting off bright white sparks of pleasure behind his closed eyelids. He's not sure if he's climbing to heaven or headed to hell in a hand basket, but for the first time ever in an elevator, he isn't thinking about the destination, he's just going to enjoy the ride.
Tony feels the first wisp of cold air waft over his skin. Steve grumbles and snuggles further into his blanket. A flash of pink swipes over cracked lips.
Steve had been researching for him. So that means... “You wanted to see if it makes me a liability in the field. To the team.” Tony says flatly, flushing hot for all the wrong reasons.
. In my
there’s more to Steve’s list, but also
Steve doesn’t answer, just wraps the blue and white pack around the bottle.
Clint waves a hand dismissively before hurrying to the coffeemaker. “It’s all good, Cap.” He sets about filling his super-jumbo flask with life-giving bean juice. He has more than earned every drop. “And for what it’s worth, try not to stress too much. I think some of it comes down to new partners… new bodies, you know? The first time I was on my knees for Bucky, I--” Clint spins on his heel, coffee acquired, and stops dead at the open mouths and wide-eyes shining over at him from the couch.
Tony’s smirk is back, fixed firmly in place as he dips out of view to grab something from the table in front of the couch. Clint takes a few steps forward, pushing past the thick air of humiliation determinedly until he can see the large platter Stark is lifting into view.
Tony corrects himself silently. Steve is almost entirely pink now, but remains silent. Tony nods and claps his hands together. “Of course we’re not! So, clearly, you did something to, uh…” His head quirks to the left, eyes narrowing on the table. “Why is Mount Kleenex reforming of its own accord?”
Tony snorts. “And let him know his accuracy extends beyond flying projectiles and reward him with a cash prize? Hell no. He’s insufferable enough as it is.”
patient, Steve. Hell, if patience is a virtue, I’m in line for sainthood. I’ve been waiting for you to get with the program since you sauntered onto that damned hellicarrier. Listening to you telling me to put on the suit when all I wanted to do was rip yours off.” Tony lets his hands trace over Steve's body with abandon - making up for lost time.
annoyingly righteous bastard with a high nazi kill rate. And those lips… Tony flushes, watching them wrap around the mouth of the bottle, technicolor memories of them wrapping around something else last night bursting bright in his mind. He drags his eyes away, the panic-fuelled blood pulsing in his cheeks suddenly acquiring a new target.
“The first time is always a disaster,” Tony says to a gloomy Steve.
, he eyes Steve cautiously. “So, uh, would this be a bad time to tell you I’m more than slightly claustrophobic? And by more than slightly, I mean
did…” His mouth snaps shut again and he grinds his teeth, dismayed at the shocking lack of genius in his current line of questioning. He settles for raising his hands again, splaying his fingers and gesturing at Steve’s new-old body. “Explain.”
“Do you want to?”
“So, I’m starting to get dizzy. Are you starting to get dizzy? It could be the carbon dioxide. Oh, I should have worn the suit to dinner. I was
Clint is grateful when Sam’s face pops up on his screen, relieved to put his eyes anywhere but the men on the couch.
out of his voice.
Tony folds himself down on the couch next to Steve. “Scientifically speaking, cravings indicate your system is unbalanced and requires additional ...nutrients.” He closes his fist around the blanket and pulls it from Steve’s lap to his own. Steve watches it slide away without protest. “It would be a shame to deny your body what it needs.”
Tony licks his lips nervously. “So, uh, they all sound like things that will not play well with this current flu… cold… thing you’ve got going on.” His eyes catch on his leg, bouncing up and down rapidly, like his foot is acting as a grounding wire, pulling the anxiety from his body to the floor. Good thing his body just keeps churning out more, otherwise he’d be at risk of handling the situation in a calm, confident manner. “JARVIS, contact Happy, tell him we need vitamin C, echinacea drops, Advil, ibuprofen, zinc lozenges, chicken noodle soup, apple juice, a mountain of Kleenex, and enough Purell to fill a bathtub.” Tony’s eyes sweep over the sweat-damp hair clinging to Steve’s forehead. “And can you drop the temperature in here to a suitably fever-quashing number?”
Clint thumbs the lockscreen away and presses on the cropped picture of Nat smirking up at him. His fingers dance across the screen.
Steve’s anger-pinched face goes lax. He stares at Tony for a long moment before he spits out, aghast, “I drank your tech?”
“So make one.”
Clint’s eyes dart from the couch to the phone like a surreal tennis match.
“Oh.” Steve wrings his hands as he shrugs sheepishly. “Uh, distractions are meant to help.”
Tony mentally curses his traitorous AI, resolving to send a small power surge his way later. Just enough to trigger a reboot, send him to the virtual naughty corner, and give him time to think about what he’s done. “I am
a deep breath, Rogers.”
“Patience is a virtue, Tony. It’s not going to kill you to wait.”
Steve nods again.
Tony resolutely ignores the way his blood vessels dilate, funneling unwanted color to his cheeks. “You weren’t complaining at the time,” he grumbles. He takes two steps forward and stalls. “When did…” Tony’s mouth clamps closed, his lips twisting, resetting his words. “
“What the actual fuck, Rogers? Where--” Tony gestures to Steve’s now very small body lying on the workshop couch, “--is the rest of you?”
Steve covers himself… mostly, and whines, “
“Well, when sick, my body craves… other things.” Steve’s skin, already looking healthier --a signal the update is taking-- burns a little over still too-sharp cheekbones.
scrawled across the label in permanent marker?”
Steve’s eyes lift to the ceiling, and he shakes his head. “There’s no hatch.”
“Give me one good reason why we can’t; one that doesn’t involve the word Canada.”
There's a long silence before Steve says slowly, “It’s not because I have them; it’s because
Steve’s face remains frustratingly neutral. “What would you say if I was?”
“Did you like the taste, though?”
-whatever it is between them- for a while now. And if Captain America’s secret kink is panic attacks, Tony might as well roll with it. It can’t be said that he doesn't seize opportunities with both hands. And he’s more than willing to lay hands and mouth and more on this particular opportunity. “I’d say we would probably wrack up more damage to this box than my repulsors could ever dream of achieving.”
Reaching up an impatient hand, Tony jabs at the
In his blanket-nest, Steve is still focused intently on his carefully measured breathing,  though something sounding very much like an annoyed huff reaches Tony’s ear. “Ignore him, JARVIS. I’m fine. Stop overreacting, Tony.”
Tony drops a kiss on the end of Steve’s nose as he carries him to the bed, enjoying the role reversal of being the one doing the man-handling for a change. “You were a science experiment long before I met you, Rogers.” Tony smirks at the dark look that crosses Steve’s face. “Oh, don’t be like that, or I won’t let you be my adorable little guinea pig next time I have tech in need of testing.”
Steve pulls his knees to his chest inside his blanket bubble. “You ordered us sushi for dinner.” Steve’s nose wrinkles at the memory. “You ate mine, and then we went to your room... for dessert.”
His eyes dart back to the towering tissue pile before returning to Steve.
Steve’s gaze falls and locks on to his lips, and Tony can’t stop from swiping his tongue over them, watching as Steve’s eyes darken in response. Reaching up to run a tentative thumb over Steve’s pulse point, Tony smiles when he feels the erratic thumping of Steve's heart a mirror of his own.
“--it was a makeshift home for my colony of nanobots.”
Steve is the first to recover, snapping his mouth closed, his eyes dropping low, suddenly finding Clint’s shoes fascinating. Tony blinks a few times, gradually bringing his eyes back to their normal size. He coughs but remains uncharacteristically quiet.
Tony can feel his mouth moving though no sound is coming out. He blinks stupidly, like a flashing cursor on a blank page, waiting for words to appear. “Uh, is that a, uh--” He clears his throat. “Are you
“Well, would you look at that? Captain America, off-balance. I never thought I’d see the day.”
“I haven’t been sick since the serum.”
Tony’s voice drops conspiratorially, leaning in like it isn’t just the two of them --well, three of them, but he doesn’t know that, Clint thinks-- in the room. “So, are you still hungry or have you had your fill for now? It’s okay if you need a break before round two. Your secret is safe with me.”
“You were trying to distract me from a racing heart and sweaty skin with thoughts of things that induce a racing heart and sweaty skin? That doesn't really hold water, even for a guy walking off sixty-odd years of brain freeze. I think your distraction for me was just an excuse for you.” Oh please let it be an excuse. Pretty please, with sprinkles on top.
Steve snorts derisively. “You really want to risk half of me disappearing again?”
“Maybe it will teach you not to order bait for dinner.”
“You’re sick?”
“Oh, uh, no, it’s not--” Steve stammers.
button once they're re-cocooned in the metal box.
“There’s nothing in it.”
“Helpful, yeah. But why are you using it to research this, specifically? Most people just use it for porn.”
Tony stares at the beautiful eyes in front of him. Blue, of course. Bright blue against equally bright white. The hysteria creeping around the edges of his brain realizes that when Steve cries, his eyes must be red, white, and blue. He fucking cries patriotism. Tony makes a strangled noise in his throat and shakes his head wildly, trying to clear the random data dump in his brain. “There’s not enough air in this box to
He turns back to Steve with a forced-casual, “Hmm?”
Tony waves Steve’s words away impatiently. Good ol’ Steve, if he didn’t have the serum coursing through his rather attractive veins, his superpower would be oversimplification. “That’s different. My suits are comfortable, like metal pajamas with life support. That and they have the added benefit of being a form of voluntary confinement.” Tony’s words leave him in a rush, like rats abandoning a sinking ship, as if they can sense his lungs are about to collapse. “This is not voluntary. This is very much the opposite of voluntary. Extremely involuntary. And is this box shrinking, or is it just me?” He presses two fingers into the seam where his neck meets his shirt collar and tugs frantically.
Steve hums thoughtfully. “How long until your bots finish their task?”
button before drifting down to engage the large, red
Tony’s nodding now. “It’s just a personal preference, and after a few times you’ll get a feel for it. To start though, it’s best just to use your tongue, slide it down your throat.”
“Yes, yes, we can. I’ve
“JARVIS! Scan the tower, find an inhaler! Or, uh, call Doctor Cho!” Tony’s voice is riding the edge of hysteria, but it’s an entirely valid response to the current situation, so he’s not going to get cringey about it. He twists on the spot, eyes darting around the room, wishing that Barton or Barnes, or any one of the freeloaders living in the tower, always choosing the most inopportune moment to appear, would show up when they were wanted for once. But of course, that would be expecting too much. His eyes fall back to Steve’s cheeks, the red tinge only serving to contrast how pale the rest of him is. “JARVIS, both! Do both!”
Steve’s soft chuckle sends the nerves down Tony's spine jumping up like they’re doing The Wave.
“Nothing you can see.” Tony takes the germy playground to the high powered magnifier nestled amongst his other shiny toys. He slides the tissue into place, and sends the holographic display projecting toward the couch. He fiddles with the controls as he calls to Steve. “Tell me, step by step, everything you remember about last night.”
He just never thought he'd hear Steve voice out their now broken love ever again.
"Don't worry too much Steve, we'll get through this. You might want to check up on Stark though. He was restless when I passed the room earlier." Clint proposed. With that he was gone, leaving Steve all alone in the living room.
"No," he snarled, "Don't start with that tone. I don't want to hear it."
The two men went back to kissing each other, feeling along planes of skin, exploring one another. Every dip and curve of Tony's body seemed perfect, the arc reactor was the most beautiful piece of technology Steve had ever seen. He had to convince Tony of that a few times, but with a few caresses around the edges Tony finally relaxed. Steve slid down along his body so he could feel everything with his lips as well as with his fingers. His mouth closed around Tony's nipple, teasingly rolling it around, blowing on it and then scraping his teeth along until Tony was writhing underneath Steve. He went through the same procedure on Tony's other nipple, leaving them both cold and hard after a while.
"Fuck," Tony gasped. He shuddered, pulled away from the kiss, hand reaching up to grip at Steve's hair, the other clenching in the soldier's shirt. Steve made a displeased noise at the interruption, merely moved his kiss from his lips to neck, sucking and biting there as well, almost as if he's proving that Tony's there, that he's in his arms— and marking him for all to see.
Their eyes were glued to one another, as Tony's thumb started caressing Steve's cheek, wiping away the stray tear. The blond gulped hardly, but didn't want to break their moment, didn't want to lose that intimacy. It was surprising but welcome. Steve had been touch-starved for so long and he really forgot what it was like to be held gently by someone else.
Tony's heart throbbed at the sight, before a large, yet gentle hand gripped his shoulder and tugged him inside. The door closed with a click, and the silence turned awkward. They were just… staring, eyes roving over each other's features— guarded, but desperate to see for themselves that the other was alright. They were barely an inch from each other, the tight fit of the hallway leaving no room for personal space. Steve's hand twitched like he wanted to feel Tony for injuries.
"That was…" Tony finally broke the silence. Steve nodded as an answer, pulling Tony just a little closer to his chest. It felt right, laying like this, with Tony in his arms, fitting perfectly along Steve's body. As if they were made for each other.
Tony's breath hitched, and he thumbed at his watch, letting the feel of the cool metal slow his racing heart rate, because no matter what happens; he has a defense. Against what ever may be on the other side of that maroon red door. Even if it wasn't the complete suit, just a gauntlet, the activation would call the nearest suit over to his location.
"I… Well, I was back in the past. My past." he started cautiously, looking for any signs of discomfort in Tony's body language. When he was sure there were none, Steve resumed. It was weird, but he really did feel like he could talk about it to Tony, here in the darkness, in the privacy of the night.
Being here in Clint's home with that exact life showed Steve that no, he could never have that. It was an idle dream. He wasn't someone who could just settle down. Much like Clint he'd always go back to fighting the good fight. He'd always go help people. As long as he had these powers - and it didn't seem like they'd go away any time soon- he was responsible, to help. He had to or otherwise he'd feel guilty for the rest of his life. He couldn't just abandon his family though either. He couldn't put them through the constant fear of losing him. No, Steve Rogers wasn't meant to have a family life.
Steve blinked away his tears. Tony turned his back, the aching of his lower back nothing compared to his heart.
"I really think that. Steve you have to see that you're a wonderful person and I don't want anything to happen to you ever." Tony added with an intensity, honesty that made Steve shiver.
Tony couldn't help but interject. This time, the glare was full of anger, rather than exasperation.
"Tony…"
thought you'd sell me out—"
"Oookay," he said slowly, "I'm gonna get going now…"
"Don't question it and come back here." Tony grinned, wagging his eyebrows at Steve. The blond didn't have to be told twice. He quickly shucked off his own pants and boxers before finally taking a good look at Tony. He was beautiful like this, laying completely naked and vulnerable in front of, no, underneath Steve. There was a sheen of sweat surrounding him and his skin was flushed in the most attractive shade of red anyone could think of. Steve was currently straddling Tony's thighs, taking in his beautifully flushed cock. The tip was purple, the whole length incredibly hard.
As a second finger pressed against Tony's hole, Steve simultaneously leaned down to lick at Tony's slit once. He wrapped his plush lips around the darkened head, caressing the skin with his tongue. Right when Tony moaned out in pleasure, Steve pushed his second finger in, along with the first. While he scissored them, pushed deeper and stretched Tony perfectly he kept licking along his cock. Tony tasted so good, musky, manly, perfect.
Tony blinked, and he watched as a tear trailed down Steve's cheek, "I love you," he said vehemently. He brought a tentative hand up, and he cupped Tony's cheek, "I hurt you so goddamn badly, and I want to fix it."
"Just because you made me something doesn't mean you like me." Steve retorted with a shrug, chewing on his lower lip. Did Tony really like him, when all this time he thought…
It seemed as though he did. While Steve got up, trying to get closer to Tony, maybe bring him to talk without forcing him to, Tony had already moved to the door. He took a deep breath, giving Steve a look that came way too close to pity for him and then he left.
Steve crouches down next to him, resting on the balls of his feet. He pushes the disposable pack back into his bag, now resting on the floor, strap hanging limply from his shoulder. He untwists the cap from the water and presses it into Tony’s hands. “Drink.”
“No, I heard you the first time. I just meant... ah...” Tony’s pretty sure he’s just suffered acute mental whiplash. Or... a dislocation? A dislocated brain. Is that a thing? It must be a thing because he’s pretty sure he has it and is going to need some form of mental traction. “Uh. Um. No…?”
"... You won't, will you?"
He plucked his boxers off the ground, sliding them on. Steve watched with a pained expression.
After another 20 minutes of silence Steve was pretty sure Tony had fallen asleep, when suddenly he spoke up once again. His voice seemed a lot closer now, but Steve didn't dare looking away from the ceiling.
Steve let out a long breath, snuggling into the warmth a little more and tightening his arm around what he suspected to be Tony. He opened his eyes only halfway, reaching out for Tony next to him.
Steve was
Tony gulped, and apparently that was answer enough, because Steve's eyes went half-lidded, and he crossed the final inch or two of distance between them.
Their lips met, and it was heaven and hell at the same time. Tony could only let out a soft groan, and give into the kiss, giving into
"Cap, Stevie-O, making and buying things for people is my love language. Not everyone gets something from me." Tony smartassed.
"Move." Tony choked out after a while and Steve slowly started to slide back out, only to slam into Tony once again. Both men moaned together, while searching for any skin available to kiss. They were both littered with marks of each other. Steve's would probably go away, but not Tony's. It made something utterly possessive well up inside of him, taking over every one of his movements. He snapped his hips forward at a brutal pace then, eliciting moan after moan, swear word after swear word out of Tony. It was so good, so unbelievably good.
Tony knows that Steve loves him, God so much. And Tony loves him too— that won't ever change. But… the love was too
"Come for me," Steve demanded, his voice low and gravelly. Not even a moment later,
Steve shook his head, and Tony couldn't tell if the soldier was trembling or it was simply the film of tears over his own eyes, "No— please. I'm so, so sorry. I was just, I was just so scared, for Bucky— I didn't mean to hurt you. I wanted to tell you, but
A scoff, "You can't keep running from your problems, Tony."
Tony gave a soft moan, and the tears started forming again. He was just too overwhelmed, too suffused with sensation, with emotion. But he didn't have the heart to say no, of course not— not to Steve. And besides, it felt too good, a welcome change from the numbing monotony of day to day life. It was like he could see in color again.
"I refuse to believe that."
"I don't want to talk about this," Tony said, voice blank, "Let's just… forget for a while."
Tony pretended to consider, "Hm— yeah."
he was here. He remembers the vibrations in his coat pocket quite vividly, signalling that Rogers,
He leaned in, and Tony's eyes widened, lips parting ever so slightly. His fingers slipped down from the metal door handle, dangling limply on his side.
His tone was venomous, but Steve didn't seem to rise to it, only thinning his lips, his baby blue eyes piercing Tony's very soul, "I saw what happened on the news. They say it was a miracle you didn't die."
"I don't know if I'm fixable, Steve," Tony confessed, voice gravelly. Steve shook his head.
"Well sorry for being considerate." Steve grumbled, taking off his socks first, while Tony was already getting under the covers. There was no answer so Steve figured Tony was probably too tired for an argument right then. Good for Steve, because he wasn't sure he could hold back screaming at Tony at that point and it really wouldn't be very considerate towards the kids anymore then. The Captain leaned over to turn off the faint light above them, before laying down as well, pulling the comforter up a tiny bit more. It was really warm underneath, with Tony's body warmth heating him up even more. It was a weird feeling, sleeping next to someone else again. To tell the truth, he kind of enjoyed it though. It felt a lot less lonely and after the vision… He could probably need some company.
"Me too," he said shortly.
Steve's hand snaked in between their bodies, swatting Tony's hand away to get a grip on his cock. He tugged on him in the same rhythm as his thrusts that went deeper than ever before. Soon enough Tony's whole body stilled, before shaking and then he was spilling in between them. Hot spurts of white come tainted both of their chests and Steve just kept on thrusting inside of Tony's loose and pliant body. "So… Beauti-ful." he murmured, feeling Tony's walls tighten around him and that was it. Only a few more half thrusts later, Steve was coming inside of Tony, filling him up on the inside.
The fingers made a filthy sound as he pulled them out. Tony immediately lifted his hips as if he was trying to get those back in, but Steve used his hand to slick himself up instead. "Tony." Steve shuddered, as he stroked himself a few times, having any sort of friction for the first time since they were making out.
"Oh hell yeah," he breathed, "Fuck, you feel so good." He grunted, a bead of precum forming as the rough fabric of Steve's khakis (God, he was such an old man) dragged against Tony's sensitive cock.
"Not really." Steve grimaced, finishing off his sandwich, with a quick glance at the clock. It's been about 20 minutes since Tony went to the room they'd be sharing - 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘥- to go get a shower. He should probably be done by now. Natasha and Bruce were already off, also bunking with each other. Laura and the kids were probably upstairs and Steve figured Clint would leave soon as well. Leaving Steve with Tony.
Clint meanwhile took a seat next to Steve, looking at him with concerned eyes. "You sure you're ok? You look like someone kicked your puppy and spit on it." the archer tried again.
"You gonna just look or actually do something?" Tony asked after a few moments, but his eyes were obviously glued to Steve's own hardened length. "I'm gonna need a lot of prepping for that thing." Tony added and for the first time since they've started Steve actually felt a blush forming on his cheeks, all the way down to his navel.
"Steve, yes, please. Hurry." Tony begged, making Steve's cock jolt once again.
had decided to reach out.
He'd suggested sleeping on the couch, it wouldn't be a problem, but Tony insisted. Nobody approaching a fight like this should sleep on a sofa. He was right, of course, but Steve doubted he'd be able to get a lot of sleep like that anyways. Sure, he shared beds with his comrades during war as well, but it was different. They weren't Tony! Infuriating, extravagant, impressive Tony.
"So that's it?" he said, dully, "We talk for five minutes, fuck, and then you're leaving?"
"But seriously Steve. You're my friend. I'm worried about you and I know how fucked up these visions are. If you need someone to talk to, well, I might not be the wisest choice, but I'm here nonetheless." Tony's voice dropped to a soft whisper when he talked and Steve felt his chest heat up. When was the last time someone directly told him they were there for him? Probably years… Decades ago.
"Fuck, look at you," he whispered, "Fucking gorgeous." Steve moaned around the nipple, his fingers tightening on his ass at the praise, before he bit down. Tony will forever deny that he had squeaked.
him, his large, strong body enveloping him and Tony felt small. Their chests were flush against the other, but Tony's was noticeably smaller, less wide than Steve's. Tony had to tilt his head up in order to kiss him, still shorter even with the boost of being lifted up— and then
He applied more of the lube on his hand, before finally tracing a finger down Tony's crack, until it caught on the rim of his entrance. With gentle hands Steve forced Tony's legs to spread. "I'm gonna prep you now." Steve whispered, for the first time aware of his own throbbing erection, begging for attention.
and Tony keened.
He licked his lips, "Can I?" he asked, voice hushed.
Steve just looked at Tony, sad and unimpressed. But there was nothing to say, nothing to do. He could either continue, or leave. It was that simple. There was nothing affectionate about this, not anymore— if you're not counting the tainted love that brought them here in the first place. It wasn't enough, especially compared to the distant memory of the warmth, the happiness, and the way they fit together like pieces of a puzzle.
Animated dots bubble across the screen, and then:
Clint watches the tips of Cap’s ears turn red enough to stop traffic. His phone vibrates silently in his hand.
Clint freezes before taking a silent step back and flattening himself against the refrigerator. He taps the aid behind his ear and winces as Steve’s voice stabs into his head like an auditory ice pick. Fucking Stark tech, as temperamental as its creator. He slides his finger over the hearing aid gently, adjusting the amplification, finding the sweet spot.
“So that’s what all this was? You helping?”
Steve’s tight shoulders drop visibly as tension leaves him. He blows out a relieved breath. “Oh, good. I thought I did something wrong.”
“Hey, Tony?”
up for this. He’s already making a mess of his favorite suit pants as it is.
inside the unforgiving jeans, throbbing for more and he needed them off, like, yesterday. He shifted in Steve’s hold, his hands grappling up to pull his delectable mouth away. He tugged on his hair a bit and Steve raised a questioning eyebrow.
He left Steve, vulnerable, hurt, confused.
"Maybe Ultron was right. Maybe I can't live without war, without a fight. That's all I am, a soldier."
"You seemed shaken up today. Was it the vision?"
you, Tony."
He wanted it more than life himself. His mind was gone at this point, replaced with a primal thing that wanted to be fucked.
Steve stayed shock still for a moment, licking the mark he bit almost as an apology. It was almost as if he could tell just the moment Tony fully adjusted, and he pulled out, the slick slide making Tony moan, bereft and empty.
He punched the bridge of his nose, "Well, you've seen me. I'm doing just
The blond couldn't hold himself up anymore and only barely caught himself so he wouldn't crush Tony. He rolled on his side, cradling Tony's head to his neck and kissing the top of his head affectionately. They were both panting and unable to speak, maybe unwilling to speak.
The tight heat that engulfed him was perfect and imagining that around his cock was enough to push some pre-cum out of his tip. He gasped at the way Tony bucked off the bed, taking his sweet time to explore Tony on the inside. The brunet was quieter than before, but he soon moved against Steve's finger so he was sure there was no pain left. "You're doing so well, Tony." Steve praised him, caressing Tony's thigh with his free hand. That seemed to make Tony's cock react, pre cum leaking steadily out of the tip. So Steve kept on praising him for 'how well he was taking Steve's finger, how beautiful he was, spread out like that for Steve.' Tony was a mess once again and Steve gave him some time to calm down every now and then, keeping him just there on the edge for a while.
"Of course I am!" Tony answered, mildly offended. "You're my friend!" he added with a confused expression visible, even in the dark of the room.
His voice was small, "Please believe me. I never wanted this."
Steve had to stay considerate for the team. Selfless.
Steve's lips screwed up, and he let out a soft groan, head tilting back and Tony couldn't help but give his adam's apple a wet, messy kiss.
Could he live without it though, if it weren't there? If there would be peace in the future, where would Steve fit in? He was Captain America, fighting for freedom, equality and justice. The man with a plan. Did he really have a plan for himself though?
"What was it about?"
Steve had nothing to say to that.
Steve just waved his hand, shaking his head. "I'm perfectly fine. That girl shook me up, but it'll be alright."
Tony let out a disapproving whine as Steve pulled out his fingers, only to watch as he spat into his palm, and went back down to press a third finger. The burning sensation returned, and only intensified as he began to scissor inside of him, loosening his hole methodically.
The constriction was getting to be too much, too much too quick. He
Ah, there it was. The dreaded 'L' word. Tony's lips twisted into a grimace. He thought they were beyond that at this point, their relationship had long since sailed. Tony was almost surprised to hear it, he would've been if it wasn't 100%, quintessentially Steve. It still dumbfounded him though.
"Me too, we needed someone to get us out of there."
(He didn't deserve it, after all.)
He threw his hands up in the air, exasperated. God, Steve fucking Rogers. Somehow, he had been expecting that.
Tony's jaw
Asking if he was okay. It would've warmed his heart if it wasn't so painful.
than he remembered, splitting him in two but Tony wanted it, he wanted it so bad. He wanted to be forced to take Steve's prick until he couldn't take it anymore, and then some.
Nonetheless Steve extricated himself from Tony when he could breathe properly again. Steve slid off the bed landing on his feet, only for Tony to tug on his wrist. "Where ya going?" he asked, voice hoarse and an incredible vulnerability in his eyes. Steve's heart clenched at the sight.
Tony's hips bucked wildly once Steve's fingers stilled inside of him, and then pulled out, leaving him hanging there, right on the edge and clenching down on nothing.
"I am?" Steve asked once more, but figured he should add to that. "I didn't think you saw me as a friend. Bruce, yes, but not me." he elaborated further.
"Hey Steve, I took a shower already so it's free for you now." the voice came from beside the bed instead. Steve quickly schooled his face to hide the disappointment of not waking up next to Tony. "Uhm, yeah. Thank you." he rasped, running a hand over his face.
Out of everything, this was why he messaged him, oh so mysteriously, to meet him in the buttfuck nowhere. To see if he was okay. Not… asking for intel on Barnes, Ross, or help in general.
Aside from the soft pants, and the whir from the air conditioner, it was silent. Tony hummed, resting his forehead on his shoulder, mind blank aside from the scent and feel of Steve. This is where he wanted to be. No fighting, no betrayals.
"Good," he said.
A trail of saliva began to drool out of Tony's mouth, and Tony felt the fingertips all the way in the back of his throat. Finally, they slid out, brushing against his swollen lips and spreading the spit there.
Steve looked at him, eyes wide and mournful, "Tony—"
The blond let out a sigh. "If you've got that big of a problem sharing the bed I can really take the sofa. Tony I wouldn't mind."
"I don't wanna talk about it Tony."
They weren't connected anymore, and anytime they tried to do so they wouldn't fit— too broken, and too misshapen to ever connect just as strongly as it had before.
Tony waited by the door, hand on the doorknob. His fingers clenched, "That's it? You're letting me go?"
why you texted me?" A glare. Tony rolled his eyes, "Well, uh— not even a scratch. I'm okay, I promise."
Tony let out a scoff, and said, "I don't care."
"Contrary to what you think, I don't assume the worst of you. I
"It's Steve," he muttered, and Tony could only manage a strangled hum, "It's Steve." His tone made the importance of the statement obvious. But Tony didn't hear it.
"It's not?" Tony whispered furiously, "It's not?!" He let out a hysterical laugh, eyes burning. He couldn't pretend to be unaffected anymore, "What's not true? That you left me in Siberia? Alone? Or that you're a hypocrite? Or that you don't care? At all?"
Thankfully, it was in the middle of a dull as fuck meeting, so it was genuinely a life saver. Looks like death by brain bleed would have to wait another day.
Steve shakes his head. “That was nice. Kind of… plump.”
“Oh.” Clint nods, awkwardly. “Right. Well, that makes sense.”
“Have you met me? It’s a king. But I believe you said something about sex in an elevator, Rogers. Captain America wouldn’t go back on his word, would he?”
“The most important thing,” Tony continues, rubbing Steve’s shoulder, “is whether or not you liked it.”
, so share with the rest of the class, would you?”
Tony bristles. “If you could see yourself, you would give me a pass. It’s not every day I go to bed with the Hulk and wake up to Banner, and oh, that really wasn’t the best analogy. I’m not getting that out of --” Tony breaks off at the weary look on Steve’s face. He twists his hands together. “The thing is… I don’t do well with
me, Rogers?”
“My gamma-targeting, epigenetic nanoswitches are not asinine. They’re cutting edge.”
Steve’s eyes snap to Tony’s, defiance pushing through exhaustion. “Surely, you read my file, Stark. I had a lot of…” He pauses, sighing and drooping visibly. “High blood pressure, heart palpitations, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever…”
“I’m not sure, Tony. Do you think we could try again?”
you left my room,” Tony grinds out in a strangled voice.
“Are you okay?” Steve’s voice is still rough despite Tony’s best rehydration efforts.
his eyes are going to pop out of his head if Steve keeps going... followed in short order by some kind of massive coronary event.
“The water?”
“And I never knew this, how?”
have been labeled,
So, Steve’s lashes weren’t the only thing to survive the size purge. Tony’s eyes drop low, and his thoughts, and his blood supply, obviously thinking this is a good idea, follow suit.
“The internet. It’s so --”
“You drank the Pepto that was on my workbench?”
Steve clears his throat. “How are you feeling?”
Steve huffs. “I’m so sorry, Stark, that I didn’t come and wake you from your post-orgasmic stupor to ask if I could have some of your precious antacid.”
Tony blanches. “We’re stuck in here for an as-yet indeterminable amount of time?”
Tony flops Steve down onto the mattress, and crawls over him, stopping to feel the erratic thumping under his lips as he presses a kiss to Steve’s chest. He lifts his face to stare into those familiar blue eyes: desire, trust and love shining up at him. He cups Steve’s chin and smiles softly. “Doesn’t matter, the bits of you that matter are all still here.”
counterpart. His hand wraps around familiar flesh, and the resulting noise it pulls from Steve’s throat sends throbbing pleasure spiraling south. “I will admit to being intrigued how the original flavor compares to the new two-point-oh version I’ve already had a taste of.”
“You’ve thought about this?” Steve’s unspoken “
“My - oh.” Tony’s head notches to the side, just realizing his panic attack has subsided. Or, perhaps more accurately, now that the blood that had been inflaming his brain is currently swelling other parts of his anatomy, his focus has seemingly shifted with it. Tony peers at Steve, suspicion slowing his words. “How do you know about anxiety attacks?”
-And god if Steve's voice moaning his name isn't the best sound Tony's ever heard- “we can’t --”
Tony’s gut clenches painfully, but it’s too early in the crisis to take a time out to examine the unsettling mix of fear and grief that Steve’s comment has stirred up, so he shoves it down under his always-ready supply of crushing guilt and heavy denial. “I am not killing a national treasure, if only because it would land me on a murderous ex-assassin’s kill list. I need to run a few tests, but in theory, it should be reversible.”
Clint peels himself from the fridge and clears his throat. “Uh, hey, guys. Hi.” He waves as Tony and Steve swivel toward him. “I couldn’t help overhearing, and that’s your fault, Stark,” Clint says, gesturing to his high-tech hearing aid. “I’m happy for you, really.” He pauses, considering. “Mostly,” he corrects himself with a shrug. “I had money on you getting together a month ago. As it stands, Nat’s gonna take the pot. But, if you could put a pin in the blow-by-blow, and any subsequent blowing until after I get my coffee to go, that’d be great.”
“You could have warned me it would be so messy. I think I still have some on my chin.”
Aww, fuck. No. Steve leans forward, his head disappearing from view, and Clint’s brain calls chicken. It's one thing to accidentally --and then kind of on purpose-- overhear your friends talking about blowjobs, it is entirely another to hang around and wait for a private showing. Nat can kill him for tapping out, at least it will be quick.

“Seriously? We’re not going to talk about the elephant trunk in the room?”

place to blow things up. I doubt they’ll even be mad. I bet they don’t even send me a bill. They’ll probably apologize to me for their stupid elevator putting me in this position in the first place, which, come to think of it, they really should.”
“Is that an ice pack? I don’t have a pulled muscle here, you star-spangled boy scout. Just let me blast us out of here. It’ll be fine. I’ll buy the hotel a new elevator. Hell, I’ll buy the whole hotel and install an elevator that actually works.”
Clint leans forward slightly, cocking his head. From his position in the kitchen on the communal floor, he can see Stark and Rogers perched on the L-shaped couch, their backs to him. The chair’s big enough to fit all the Avengers on it at once --well, maybe not Banner 2.0-- and yet they’re sitting close, legs pressing together, no space to fit even the skinny arachna-kid between them. The wheels in Clint’s head start turning.
Scrubbing his hand through his hair, Tony snorts out a humorless laugh. “Steve, that wasn’t for you to drink--”
“That’s called saving some for later, Rogers.” Tony’s laugh is low and husky as he swipes his finger over the aforementioned body part.
Steve presses his lips together and reaches for another tissue.
, in some super-secret, superhuman trial?”
“Have you ever had sex in an elevator?”
Lifting his mug, Clint shakes his head. “Coffee and oysters? Not a great mix.” He starts backtracking, his cheeks on fire. “You enjoy, though. Sorry about the, ah, well, you know.”
The sounds of soft laughter and wet kisses reach Clint just as the elevator doors slide closed.
“You know what they say: it’s important to face your fears. So how about a little, or, uh--” Tony groans as he grinds in Steve’s lap, “--or not so little distraction? The water was great and all, but I can think of something else I’d rather have inside me right now.”
The corner of Tony’s lip pulls up in a smirk, while Steve’s brows furrow, confusion scrawled across his face. He turns to Tony who throws him a knowing glance, and understanding and embarrassment spread over Steve’s face like a time-lapse sunset.

Steve’s eyes, a little less glassy now, lift to meet Tony’s. “You know how when you get sick, you get all whiny and sulky and crave donuts?”
Tony’s eyes roll at his own words being thrown back at him, his fingers tapping the air over the holographic screen, setting the parameters, and starting the diagnostics on the mucus-covered nanobots. “Maybe this will teach you not to take things that don’t belong to you, Steven.”

Tony’s brain is reeling, trying -and failing- to follow the abrupt u-turn in conversation. They’ve been dancing around the edges of this ...
The garbled noise in his throat is somewhere between a laugh and a scream. “I’m pretty sure we passed okay about ten minutes ago, Cap. We’re rapidly speeding into very
“Stop being a baby. I’ve reprogrammed them. They’ll meet up with their friends, infect them with the new code, and they’ll switch to repair mode.”

as terrifyingly as before. He squeezes his eyes shut, trying desperately to resist flopping onto the floor and curling up in the fetal position.
“Tony?’
Ordinarily, he gets along fine with elevators - when they’re moving and the amount of time required to be encased in one is limited. Right now, however, given that neither of those qualifiers remain true, the object in question has become an enemy combatant and shall be treated as such. He reaches for the band around his wrist that will unfurl into his gauntlet. “So. I’m going to blast us out of here now.”
, you’ll be able to tell me something only
Tony walks to his workbench. There’s a jumbled mix of metallic noises as determined fingers go searching through the organized chaos before he turns, triumphantly, one black nitrile glove snapping its twin against his wrist. “Want to bend over and cough, Rogers?” His eyebrows twitch up suggestively.
Steve made quick work of his ass, another finger squeezing its way inside the constriction, spit making a barely sufficient lube. It burned a little. Tony liked it though, wanting it that way. It detracted from the intimate nature of the activity. "More," Tony got out, quaking in his hold, especially when he found his prostate and mercilessly took advantage of the spot inside of him. It was always sensitive, almost painfully so, "
Tony could only tighten his legs around Steve's waist as the soldier began to rut against his erection. Steve pulled back, only barely, their lips brushing with every exhalation.
"You lied to me about how your best buddy murdered my parents. You're a fucking hypocrite, Steve 'sometimes my friends don't tell me things' Rogers. You left me there because you didn't trust me." Tony felt a chill settle in his blood, in his bones, and it was like he was back there— in that godforsaken Siberian bunker, raggedly breathing while having to listen to the roar of the wind, the screams of his mother, "So yes. I don't doubt that you have an ulterior motive, because there's no way in hell you care if I'm injured or not."
"I'm ready! Get in me now, Steve. Please. I'm so ready for you." Tony begged and really… Steve would've never been able to say no to Tony begging him for something. He would've preferred to prep Tony a little while longer, but he was so needy already, so ready to finally feel all of him.
"Wanna keep me safe from any robbers. Oh how noble of you Rogers." Tony remarked. Steve rolled his eyes somewhat fondly as he made his way over to the bed. He sat down on the side at first, testing the firmness of the mattress and pushing up the pillows a bit. He could feel Tony's eyes on him, Steve saw the way Tony twisted his fingers, anxiously darting his eyes around. Why was he that nervous? Did sleeping next to Steve sound like such a hardship?
"Ah, the vision, huh? I'm glad she didn't get me."
So yeah. He felt somewhat safe, but somewhat wasn't absolute and it didn't mean that he didn't feel apprehensive as hell.
He positioned his tip on Tony's entrance, locking eyes with that beautiful man beneath him and finally pushed in. He couldn't stop the moan from escaping his lips as he was engulfed by Tony for the first time. Steve leaned his head down, pressing his face into Tony's neck and kissing all over. His hips pushed in further and further, Tony's legs wrapped around his waist to make it a lot easier to slide right in. Tony wasn't making any sounds but he was breathing heavier than before. As much as Steve would've wanted to look at Tony right then, see his reaction to their connection, he just couldn't get his head back up.
The men moved in a synchronized rhythm for what felt like a perfect eternity, until Tony's moans grew more frequent and louder. Steve felt his stomach tightening as well, the heat rising more and more. He was close, but Steve wanted Tony to come first. He wanted to see Tony fall apart and be the one to catch him, put him back together. Steve wanted to be the reason for Tony to come apart, but he also wanted to fix him, he wanted to be there for him, be his anchor to the world.
Steve stiffened, and in the totally unsexy way. He then pulled back, and Tony immediately felt the air begin to dry the now aching and wet marks on his throat and collarbone. Despite the close proximity, Tony felt cold.
A pause, and more hesitantly than before, Steve leaned in, only to scoop his ass with a single strong arm, his now free hand reaching to pull at Tony's shirt. Tony obligingly lifted his arms up, and it was left forgotten on the floor.
I was a coward. I was afraid you'd hate me, or worse try and… find Bucky."
No, Peggy was wrong. The war wasn't truly over. It never would be. Anywhere Steve went, war followed him. He woke up in a new time period and the first thing he had to do was fight a fight that was not his. He couldn't even imagine a world without war. Not even for Peggy.
"Peggy was there, and many others. They were dancing, drinking. Peggy said the war was over and that… That we could go home. It's just… Tony I don't have one. A home. I don't have anywhere I truly belong and I always thought I'd end up with a dame in a farmhouse just like this, but now…" his voice trailed off and he shook his head gently, forcing the moisture in his eyes away, the lump in his throat back down.
Tony's eyes widened slightly in comprehension, oh. That's what this was about. Yeah, that wasn't fun— your arc reactor shutting off in the middle of the air. Luckily, he figured out whatever electromagnetic pulse that week's villain used, and it shouldn't be a problem any more.
"You left me there. The video continued playing, you know that? I was stuck in that deactivated suit of mine, courtesy of you, and I had to listen to that. For hours, barely able to breathe because you fucking caved my chest in."
"I wanted to see if you were okay," he said, deceptively evenly.
, fucking in and out like he
Tony moaned brokenly, his quivering entrance clenching around the cum that was being fucked into his ass. It burned a little, perhaps he's been fucked too hard, but it was just too good to care.
To his own shock, a tear suddenly ran down his cheek. It was a tear for everything he had lost, everyone he left behind, all those dreams he could never make come true.
“Pants,” he panted, “Off.” Tony gyrated some more, feeling ridiculously wanton and desperate, and Steve understood. He squeezed his ass before his fingers caught on the waistline. He began pulling them down, letting Tony stand for a moment to fully pull them off along with his boxers; then finally leaving them forgotten on the floor. Tony didn’t have time to mourn for the expensive jeans dirtying on the dusty hardwood when Steve captured his lips again. Tony groaned. A jolt of arousal shot through him when he realized that Steve was still fully clothed, while he remained buckass nude.
"Liar," Tony breathed, fascinated,  "You never thought I could do anything right. That's the thing Rogers, you pretend to be inclusive, trusting, and maybe you are, but not to me. Never to me. You never once trusted me, not when it came to the Accords—"
"I would never." Steve answered quietly, running his hand through Tony's hair with a tenderness he wasn't even sure he had in him still. The blond couldn't think about how true his statement was, that he would never leave Tony. It was scaring him that those feelings he had tried to suppress ever since they met on the helicarrier were all laid out on the table now. "I've got you." Steve added instead, wanting to at least give Tony this one night of security, evening Tony didn't want this the next morning. Soon enough Tony was asleep on Steve's chest and the blond followed suit, being lulled into the cottony feeling of sleep.
"Steve we have an Ultron to worry about right now. Can we...can we not do this?" Tony cut in, making a sour face as he straightened his tie for the umpteenth time.
Steve felt fingers scratching at his shoulders as he swallowed almost all of Tony down, while pushing yet another finger inside. "Holy fuck, shit, Steve!" Tony moaned louder than he probably should. "There it is. Yeah, right there." Tony added and Steve brushed against the bundle of nerves with his fingers over and over again.
A sigh, "If it makes you feel any better, sure."
Another searching look, and Steve's shoulders loosened. It was like a whole weight had been lifted off of him.
Tony gave a lecherous grin, but there was a hardness in his eyes. Something that wanted to be hurt. He licked his lips, and pushed his ass back. He let out a soft moan as the tip of Steve's cock brushed up against one of his cheeks, leaving a smear of precum. He bit his lip at the soldier's strangled breath.
