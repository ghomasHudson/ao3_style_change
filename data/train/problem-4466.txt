“Come,” Cas whispered. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”
“Why don’t ye go do somethin’ useful?”
Maggie stepped closer to Claire, unconsciously seeking comfort. "Are there really monsters out there that are
And I waited.
"Will you let go and move on if it doesn't work?"

"And we didn't really mean the first stuff we said?"
Michael’s eyebrow twitched. “I’ve been trapped inside your head.”
"I'm not— I mean,
Claire blinked in surprise. "Because I like you."
Sam looked up at the two of them, standing side by side. “You two did this?”
Castiel smiled and relaxed in the feeling. He found a tune buried somewhere inside, something new and strange and exciting. It came out in Enochian, syllables harsh then smooth, jagged on his tongue and honeyed in Dean’s ears.
"Obviously, yeah."
And Michael sobbed.
Dean couldn't hide his smirk. "So, what makes someone human?"
“It was gonna be a surprise!” Sam responded, laughing and letting himself be led. “I found it after practice yesterday!”
"He's Sam," Dean responded, as if that was a response, as if that was the ultimate answer.
"I… yeah," Dean responded, surprised. "I found a baby one that had fallen out of its nest and it was just so… small, I guess, so I took care of it until it could fly. Kept it hidden so Dad wouldn't find it." Why was he doing this. He was supposed to be
The box hitting the bottom of the ocean did not thud. It did not bounce, or rattle, or even disturb the two men singing old songs together where no human had been before.
For Castiel.
Castiel crossed his arms across Dean's chest, resting his head on them. "He was a plain man, impossible to pick out in a crowd. But he was loyal and kind in a time where I was just learning what those words meant." He glanced down at Dean. "Are you okay?"
"You want company?" he asked Dean, eyebrow raised.

Gabriel hugged him tighter.

Dean breathed out, almost like he was relaxing again.

When Claire's well-meaning hand connected with his shoulder, wings cracked out of him.
"I didn't think you'd be with me," he whispered, eyes clenched shut now. "I thought I'd be able to scream about it. And I can't." Dean reached out one shaking hand to Castiel's cheek. "Why did you follow me in here? Why did you sign your own fucking death warrant, huh?" His hands clenched into lazy fists.
Cas squinted at him. "Are you okay?"
I'd keep you dry
Mary wiped at her own face. “And this Rowena? And Gabriel?”
Sam picked up almost immediately.
"I will
Sam shook his head. "We everyone."
"Though' it wasn't a game? Ya said it was just—"
“You need this,” Sam told her.
I fought and I fought, and Patroclus stayed at camp to help with the wounded. He was a good healer. He was the best of the men there.
The door slammed behind her.
Cas shook his head. "Nevermind. Yes, go ahead. I suppose it can't hurt."
"And you didn't mind tagging along on their date?"
Gabriel watched as blood flowed down from Sam’s closed eyes. “I don’t understand…”
Claire blinked in surprise. “You never told me you and Bobby had a thing.”
Dean ran a finger over a computer, frowning. “They’re not even dusty.”
It’s more — It’s gutteral.
Castiel mouthed.
"It's not that I don't want to—"
Claire grinned. "It was worth a shot." She kissed Maggie again, again, again. "But ya know, in Kansas, it's enough to just say it so much that everyone agrees."
“It’s not okay,” Jack sobbed. “It’s not okay! That doesn't make it
“Will you two keep it down?!” Jody yelled from Donna’s room.
Claire grinned at him, leaning against the door jamb. "I've seen it all before, it's okay. I was actually coming to ask if you wanted to finish that map we started making a while back."
"I am not your enemy," the voice begged.
“Ye do that?”
"Dean?"

They were giggling, hands muffling their mouths.
"I... I imagine... I imagine God sits high and mighty on his throne, reigning terror. Or did, once. Haven't seen him in a while."
“Nope-a-mundo, kid.”
“He loved you. Didn’t he?”
"And you know what else, Sam? If Dean wants to stay in a box with his angel, then
Cas shook his head. "No, I need to stay awake."
Sam's eyebrows raised. "Wait seriously?"
I… I held on to his body for so long. I prayed and prayed, that they would bring this human back, that they would allow me this one thing after they had taken so much from me.
Sam gave her a small smile, reaching out to squeeze her hand. "Thank you, Rowena. You're right. I just have to find something else to fill my time."
I'm coming!
“Can’t… breathe…” Claire told Sam, tapping on his shoulder.
Both of us, so many times! And we’re just going to let her run?!” The air around him was crackling.
The trees parted, and… there he was.
"Yer welcome." Rowena took a deep gulp of her coffee, closing her eyes as if to savor it better. "Can I ask why ye think yer a bad person?"
He snorted, pulling Castiel close. “It seems to

Dean loved him, goddammit.
Claire stretched out over Maggie’s stomach, eyes closed. “Whatcha doin?” Claire asked sleepily.

There were those strong arms around him again, holding him, caressing him.
“Yeah,” Charles responded, frowning. “You can’t store people’s memories in a computer, though. They just stay in their brains.” She pressed enter and stopped cold. “Oh. Oh, fuck.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. "I really think acting out Tombstone together is unnecessary."

reason why Maggie and Claire and Donna and Jody can't—"
“Yeah, don’t worry. It’s easy. Just… grab the soccer ball and the Uno cards.”
Dean scoured his brain for a way out. "Are you… Are you serious? Let me castle, no way you're gonna win."
“Yes. It seems you have a short supply of angelic pick-up lines.”
Dean was suffocating.
“Can I tell you a secret?” Dean asked, scrubbing at his stomach.
“I know.”
“Not a chance!” Charlie responded, shoving him gently. “They really just had people in those weird suits pretending to be the wolves in
"That'sh adowabwe," Gabriel told her around his sucker.
The water was clear, but even in the pool Gabriel could tell tears were floating from Dean's eyes.

"Donna and Maggie are too much like Dean."

Dean coughed slightly and his heart rate spiked. "We can't talk about this."

"That's not entirely true. I once sat close to him at a library for lack of space."

“We can’t. They’re gone, Dean.”
"They needed the rest. Sam's been running himself ragged, especially lately."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Besides that."
"Alone. Nothing personal, I promise. I'll be back soon."

Rowena simply took a sip from her drink, averting her eyes.

did?"
“I’m already here, Jack.”
Gabriel wouldn’t have stopped. Really. He knew Sam had had a long day. But he had to halt when he realized it wasn’t Sam’s room at all.
“Which, congratulations, by the way. I’m happy for you two. We can have a party of some kind when we get you out of here.” Sam smiled fondly. “You know, he’s always been in love with you. I guess he just needed this to finally tell you. Gosh, you know once he had a
With a simple tap, the overwhelming number of sensations were blissfully muted.
“Seems a fair way to go. I doubt he’d mind.”
“A little magic,” Rowena offered, smiling softly.
She smirked at Castiel. “I, Castiel…”
Dean snatched it from her, fake-offended. "I'm getting it then. I can't expect you to grow up into a good person without hearing Folsom Prison Blues."
There was no smile, but no frown either, and Dean sat in the rickety stool beside him.
"Do you even know how to talk dirty?"
"MY FATHER IS
"Yes. And, pray tell, where is that lumberin' lumberjack?"
Dean kissed Castiel deeply, tongue roving. He shrugged his shoulders, and Cas laughed into his mouth, pulling away. Dean grinned at him. “I’ll let you pick.”
Castiel began moving, slowly, too slowly, and Dean used his heels as leverage to set a better pace.
"I can erase every memory from your mind."
“I was hoping you would sing for me.”

Neither said anything.

Claire huffed. “And Gabriel over there’s got the fuckin’ Sistine Chapel of pools.”
"What about Summerland?" Gabriel said behind them suddenly.
Sam was quiet for a long time, staring at the dusty door and thinking of nothing at all.
“A scooby snack, then?”
“You’re jealous,” Sam teased, running backwards just so he could flash that childish grin at Dean.
Jack shrugged his wings up awkwardly, spreading them out over the top of the bed.
I always used to sign us up. Did you know that? As long as we were competent, Dad didn't actually care if we went or not. But Sammy always loved school, so I'd sign us up.
"I'm fine," Sam responded automatically, not thinking. He closed his eyes again.

"Yes." Castiel breathed, and it felt like the first breath in ages. "I want to hold onto you."
"Still there," Cas whispered. "They may have taken up permanent residence."
The things grew, slowly but surely. Or perhaps they grew very fast. I couldn’t tell you. God did not invent time; that was an entirely human invention.
“I was— am,” Dean corrected himself, moving forward, because he knew he would turn to salt were he to look back. “I am irrevocably in love with you.” His feet moved slowly, his eyes dropped further. “And you deserved better than me.”
Rowena was silent a long time. "That's not possible," she finally said.
"Of being human? The sex," Cas deadpanned.
Jest that it feels emotions, really, and things change dependin' on them."
“Are you and Sam together?”
"Here," Michael held up a small, spiral shell, "is Castiel."
Sam raised an eyebrow, schooling his smile. “Yeah, I’m sure she’d love to dance with you, Jack.”
"Well there's — I mean, it depends on how you're feeling. If you want wholesome, there's always Queer Eye and any number of cartoons. Moomin has kinda become this giant thing. And then you've got the action shows like I dunno… Yeah, here, Kim Possible and Adventure Time."

“You can’t say that for sure.”

"Oh, no. Dean wasn't dating M—" Sam stopped with the mug halfway to his lips, eyes widening. "Oh my god.
Lord of the Rings, and she even agreed to watch Harry Potter with me! She introduced me to the Twilight Zone, which I never really watched until recently.” She laughed. “If only bad things were as simple as that show, huh?”
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
“A counterweight,” Cas gasped out as he felt his wings unfurl from wherever they had gone. “We cancel each other out.”
He used the now-hot table to push himself up. "Hello?" he called out to the high-tech room, blinking in the harsh light.
When it landed back in the pan perfectly, she was speechless.
Go to the ends of the earth for you
He shook his head, frowning. “Monsters are nasty business. I’m glad to be done with them.”
“I’m afraid your voice can’t quite do what is required. But, I can form one you could use, yes.”
Dean struggled to stand up. “Then I’ll go ask Cas what he wants to—”
Maggie broke into a fit of laughter, which she quickly silenced. She grabbed a hat from somewhere off-screen and used the phone to aim, throwing it at the tower like a ring toss.

Castiel shivered. “You heard that?”

I felt it in my heart when he moved on, as well.
or, he was once. Now there was a creature crouching on the floor before him, horns twisted and gnarled, busting up and out of human skull, half-formed faces covering every inch of skin.
Gabe lifted his arms and lowered them. “Then we pray Sam doesn’t have a relapse.”
Castiel smiled, and it was like the sun had come out on a rainy day. “I love you, too, Sam,” he said.
The burn was blissful and terrible and too much and not enough. It felt like Dean was being pulled in every direction, when the only direction he cared about was
There was silence, and then Castiel chuckled. "I'm sorry. You couldn't see that. I shrugged rather dramatically. I was imitating an image of an old man in a red shirt— nevermind. I don't know, in your case. It's usually just a species versus subspecies thing. But we're talking philosophically."
here. Fault don’t matter now.”
“Of course not, because water is not wet.”
Dean snorted, shaking her hand. “You’re an absolute dork, you know that?”
Dean was doubled over in laughter in the line outside the theater. “Are you fucking kidding me?” he asked.
Mary couldn't help but chuckle as the entire tower collapsed and someone shouted angrily from off-screen.
Gabe stuck his tongue out. “You were saying?”
"Only if you're gonna say yes," Claire whispered back.
Mary came forward to hug Sam tightly. “Happy birthday, my baby boy,” she whispered in his ear.
Sam let out a breathy laugh. “It worked,” was all he said, smiling tiredly.
"Dean?"

Everything was so, so cold.
With Gabriel on one side, Rowena on the other, and family spread out across every available surface, Sam felt content. He felt happy.
Castiel's lips twitched up as he patted Dean's shoulders comfortingly. "There, there, Dean. I know it's a difficult concept for you to grasp, but there's no shame in losing to an angel. Perhaps one day you might be so good as to tie with me."
I don't want to live my life alone
I'm coming with you!
Cas had found out. Of course Cas had found out. And he had researched and researched until he knew the name, knew the cause, knew the cure.
“May not death part us.”
Jack yawned. "This is Jack," he said, snuggling farther into his pillow, repositioning his wings over Sam.
Besides feeling guilty for what he had done, the mere thought of that many people made his skin crawl. He had spent three thousand years with only one person, and now there were — what? Eleven? At least?

it's right in the end and we just have to trust Him because... because he loves us and..." Michael’s hand rubbed against his own face, leaving a bloody trail in its wake.
"So just choose what would make you happiest." Dean's lips were against Castiel's cheek.
"Haven't seen you in a while," Dean started, immediately wishing to rewind a few seconds to avoid breaching that subject so soon. He swerved into a new lane. "How are you?"
Castiel breathed in shakily, like he wanted to ask, to clarify, but Dean kissed him softly.
"I know."
Where would you choose to be?
"A… friend of yours brought her back."
"What's wrong?" the baker asked him, dusting flour off his apron.
Jody shook her head and grinned. "We're growing old, Donna."
“You want me to torture you, Castiel?” Dean muttered, arms braced against the metal coffin.
Bobby held the lid in place as Claire soldered on the hinges. “So you’re Sam’s kid, huh?”
She grinned at him. "I promise to complain the entire time."
Rowena cursed under her breath, looking back at Sam. "What do we do?"
“It will be.” She smiled at him momentarily before beginning her painting.
Dean sighed and ran a hand over his face. “Just… Look. I’m not saying I believe you. But like… if I… if I

would stay here indefinitely, yeah. Yeah, I do."
Tears rolled down Dean's cheeks. "I don't know."
Yes. Yes I did.
“To be entirely fair: where would I have gone?”
“And it is eternal,” Castiel agreed, tightening his hold on Dean.
Cas was suddenly grateful he had gone to Heaven’s meeting today, because this many people would have destroyed him the day before.
“A few minutes, tops!”
“I thought he was you,” Dean whispered back. “But it wasn’t… It wasn’t a normal kiss I didn’t mean to—… I don’t…”
Naomi jabbed her finger in his direction. “That was a threat!”
He looked back suddenly, as if someone had tugged on his wing.
Claire elbowed Maggie. “Ow, hey,” Mags grumbled. “Okay. Alright. Um, bad timing again but… would you… walk me down the aisle?”
Thank you all so much for sticking with me til the end. It was a long time to get here (almost a year!!!) and I'm so, so grateful for friends like y'all. This fic changed so much since when it started as a simple one-shot over on Tumblr. Now it's the longest and most popular fic I've got, and I'm very proud of how far both it and I have come. Special thanks to sassysousa and Rauko, who let me send them scene ideas and let me ramble about this late at night. I love you guys <3
He was the first human to ever kiss me.
Dean’s hands took Castiel’s gently, and Castiel looked back to him. “Hey, Cas,” he whispered.
"To return to your original question, Tithonus wasting away sparked within me two great fears: that, one day, I would cease loving him entirely, and a second, new fear: that I never would."
Castiel rolled his eyes and sat the phone back down, grabbing Dean’s hands and leading them to the water. The lake was warm, and Dean dove under and back up, pushing his hair out of his eyes.
Jody had carried Claire to the table and patched up her heavily-bleeding arms.
But he was wrong.
"Sam," Dean said, ignoring Sam's warning. "Sam."

And Dean looked around because all the teachers were glaring at them, and Mark smiled at me and said, “You’re a wholesome kid, kid. Never change.”
Castiel’s lips twitched into a smile. “Not even for Sam?”
"You can tell me anything."
He could feel the paper in his hands, could feel the age wearing at it. The ink on it was three years old. He knew that by the way it had faded. He could see each individual molecule if he looked close enough.

Michael knelt down, knees on either side of Dean’s legs, and smashed his face with a tome. “If you’re going to say something,
"Everything... Everything
Thunder rumbled. “Sam, I…” Castiel’s feathers ruffled, his heads turned every direction, looking for a way to say what had happened without causing Sam harm. “I lost him,” was all he managed.
"I… I physically cannot do that. I'm piloting his body."
"Let me go."
"Specially the bad ones."
“You were thinking something.” God, that was stupid.
And of course she did, because the sun was warm and the grass swayed against her calves. "Don't let the other gods hear you," she warned him. "You know how they feel about shit talk like that."
Dean rolled his eyes. “There ain’t nothin’ to forgive, but if it makes you feel better, yes.”
“I know. I know. You’ve got four extra right now. But Sam…” Dean ran a hand over his face, looking on as his younger brother gave the camera a gap-toothed grin, holding his first lost baby tooth. “I’m pretty damn old now. I’d like some peace and quiet.”
"We sure as hell ain't friends, either," Dean grumbled, going back to pushing at the walls. "Where even are we?"
"As much as I want you to move on from this trap," Cas said slowly, choosing his words, "I also want to be sure you've considered every possible angle."
"Good! It's their own fault for calling fucking 'fusing'!"
And a stalemate, a punch blocked, was the entire situation.
There was silence, then a calloused hand met Dean’s cheek. “It is not your fault, either.”
Maggie sighed. "When Jack and I freed Dean and Castiel, there was a… moment."
“Completely full.”
Donna nodded. “Ya know, when ya asked for my help, I thought these computers were gonna be… newer?”
And she climbed the stairway to heaven, three steps at a time, bow slapping against her back. "Apollo!" she yelled out, and Sam turned to her.
Oh god I’m such an idiot…
Dean blinked in surprise. “I… Yeah?”
Maggie raised her arms over her head, inhaling deeply. “And Rowena?”
In a flurry of shattered remnants, the shell was gone.
Dean huffed. "Yeah."
“A birthday present,” Sam said flatly, as if it were obvious. “The Bunker wanted me to find it.”
“I am ignoring that reference, and… maybe. Oberon was fun.”
Will he ever say goodbye to me
Gabriel sat slowly beside them, fingers tented against his lips.
But I can’t stay. I think you know that.
Cas studied him curiously. "Do you consider yourself still human?" he asked with genuine surprise.
Fergus held up a hand, his other firmly in Rowena's. "That uh…" He laughed once, not meeting Sam's eyes. "It seems that won't be a problem anymore. For anyone."
“What?”
The man before their door turned around just in time to be almost bowled over by Rowena.
Okay.
“Tell me a story?” Dean asked quietly instead.
"You'd lose that bet."
King of the fairies?”
Dean hugged him hard, burying his face in the crook of Sam’s neck. “I missed you I missed you I missed you,” Dean sobbed.
Dean looked around the empty, lifeless Bunker. "What's going on?"
Castiel weighed his words carefully. It was uncharted territory, Dean rethinking his relationship with Sam. “I think… both of you know what a healthy relationship is now. He has Gabriel and Rowena romantically, and a great deal of others platonically. And you and I spent decades discussing us, and what we expected, and how things would work. I think the only relationship you two have left to repair is your own.”
sounded by their ears.
The next day, however, when he got to the tree, the city had put a fence around it! How could he get to James now?!
Sam let out a low breath before nodding. “I promise.”
It squeezed at his heart, kicked his lungs.
“What happens if we don’t succeed?”
I don’t know what else to tell you. Everything in me wants to rip this up and just go, just drive, but I’ll leave it here. I know you love me, maybe not the same but still love, and I want you to know I’ll be okay. In the darkest dark in the world, under millions of pounds of ocean water, I’ll be okay, because I’ll be thinking of you.
all of me"
Maggie nodded. "I can understand that. I wouldn't mind learning more from Gabriel. It just seems… practical, given our circumstances." She glanced around them, making sure they were alone. "Are we ever gonna tell them what we did?"
Dean tried to push Castiel off, but Cas grabbed that wrist and pushed it against the wall behind them, beside Dean's head.
But he knew it.
Sam was quiet for a long time, staring off into the distance, eyebrows furrowed.
Sam's mouth fell open comically. "Reallllly?"
"Thank you," Jody responded, holding it to her face. "So."
“Exploring isn’t a side quest.”
Dean looked at the bags under his eyes, the frizzy hair, the jittery stance.

Charlie nodded. “Yeah, that’s what it looks like. But there’s no need to push the plan off. We can just regroup in a few hours, if you want. You just pop in, say hi, and tell him we’re getting them out. And then we do. Simple.”

“Well, who else was going to quote the entirety of Tombstone with me?”
"You don't know how many times I wanted to come get you," Sam whispered.

He, Dean Winchester, was happy.

“They sound lovely. I couldn’t have asked for better grandkids.”
“I agree.”

Sam looked at the next photo, Dean holding a shotgun at age five.
Sam leaned back in Dean's arms, reaching out chubby, shaky hands to smush Dean's face. "Come home," he begged.
Gabriel leaned against the counter beside Sam, eyeing the bacon warily. “Hey there.”
Sam was hiccupping against his chest, tears still rolling freely. "Y-you said yo-ou'd prot-tect me from the mon-monsters. I'm sca-ared."
"You were—" Dean cleared his throat, "You were talking about Patroclus."
“Aw, drat. We forgot to file them for three thousand years.”
Sam couldn’t say anything, either, and merely sobbed with him.
The feeling of being human wasn’t alien to Cas, but it was unnerving, the way his lips tingled against Dean’s, the way his clothes felt sliding off his body. Dean’s hands wasted no time in mapping the curves on Cas’s body, all worry gone. Because this was not an angel and a demon, this was two humans, deep in the woods, and that was something Dean could understand. There was no angry hum in the back of his mind, no burning on his arm. There was just the smooth feel of Castiel’s skin as he removed every layer of clothing separating them.
“Of course,” Castiel responded, doing the same.
She made a few last movements before standing on her tiptoes to kiss him sweetly. “Then yes.”
And when Castiel said, "Dean," it was the most beautiful sound Dean had ever heard.
“Aromantic-asexual. Maybe you can find some solace there.”
“Take you, Dean…”
Updated early this time bc why not!
And I think you think so, too."
And I called you. Because he listens to you.
"That sounds fantastically fun," Sam whispered, mischief in his voice.
Claire snorted, leaning back and handing a drill to Jody. “Well said.”
“Because he
Sam laughed bitterly. "My dad? My dad—" He thought back to his childhood, to all the major moments and memories that shaped him. "My dad was actually the coolest dad ever."
"I didn't HAVE to even think about it! I
Sam's eyes were flooding and spilling over. "I can't just leave him."
Dean reached up, wrapped his hands around Michael's wrist. "If you break that, I won't be suffering anymore. I won't remember."
Gabriel leaned back, admiring his work. “Are Mary and Bobby coming or naw?”
"Oh."
"Like… like a grizzly bear or a teddy bear?" Sam teased.
Dean shoved the phone at Cas, barely making it to the bathroom before he was coughing and hacking, water turning pink then red then maroon. He gasped in breath after breath, only to have it forced out of him again.
“I can strip myself, buddy,” Dean said shakily.
“No, water
Dean pulled out a few different books, shuffling them in his arms until he was forced to sit everything onto a table. "I thiiiinnnnk," he drawled, yanking one out of the stack, "this one." He held out a tattered paperback.

I took a step towards the town.
Sam laughed. "Yeah. Yeah, he was my brother and my mom and my dad all rolled up into one. And he still managed to make it work."
“You think you have to earn love.”
Charlie had yelled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. I did. Though, I prefer to see it as we got to spend a thousand years together.”
"Crowley," he whispered finally.
Sam giggled as he laid down on his bed, pulling Gabriel and Rowena to either side of him. “It was a good night, yeah?” Sam said, slightly slurred.
"What did I do wrong?" he asked softly.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean said. “We’re taking you to prom.”
Donna furrowed her brow. “Building— oh. Oh, yeah. The second Ma’lak box. So does that mean—”
Gabriel watched all the emotions pass over Jack’s face. “I don’t know.”
"If you want me to be happy then
Rowena motioned her over to give her a list as Claire and Jack finished setting up the last tent.
Castiel laughed quietly, smoothing out Dean's shirt where it had been rucked up. "Where was I?"
is phase two?" Maggie asked incredulously, staring at the piece of space. "How many phases are there?"
“Thank you.”
"Fuck you," he told the ocean.
thank you very much.”
“That’s… valid, I suppose. But uh… no. It was really me.” Sam winced. “Is he mad that we haven’t seen each other? I know he… he pulled me back but I was too far away.”
The thought crossed Cas's mind. He could lean in and taste those lips that had teased him for ten years.
“Nothing can break this box. Not even ancient, eldritch beings.”
It was as if everything snapped back for Dean, and his hands caught Cas’s. “What…?”
Sam stared around the park, face red and hand covering his mouth.
Jack sat in the soil beside her, and Maggie couldn't help but think how much like a tree he was. Tall, almost as tall as Sam now, with thick arms and feet firmly rooted in the ground. Just now, he wrapped his arms around his knees, looking for all the world like a bloom not yet opened. "What's in store for you guys next?"
I've stared at your lips and dreamt of nothing more than simply being able to kiss you? Or even hold your hand?" Dean propped his head up to try and see Castiel. "This is already so much more than I ever thought I'd actually get, Cas. It's already more than I dared to want. I'm okay with just this. Really."
But Dean, Mark, and I all sat in the bleachers and commented on the whole thing until I decided to get us all some punch.
Cas chuckled low under his breath. “I admit, it does drag on.”
Michael chuckled to himself. “You were always a good soldier, Castiel, and an excellent commander. What can I do for you?”
“Did I answer your question?” she asked carefully.
And then I get a call,
Gabriel raised an eyebrow, arms crossed. "Waiting for the big reveal here, guys."
"Someone told me long ago
“Heaven’s open,” Sam mumbled, falling asleep slowly.
Claire landed a hit to Charlie's side, quickly following it with a kick that got deflected.
Sam, who had been busy setting up the picnic, dropped a loaf of bread. "Hold the phone—"
"Hey, Cas," he responded, tongue stumbling over syllables like it had stumbled over flesh.
There's just too much that time cannot erase
“No, no, no. You’re doing it wrong,” Dean said, demonstrating again. “It’s all in the wrist.”
Gabriel pushed it open gently to see Sam sitting cross-legged on the floor.
Her family had grown. It had grown so much, and she still had people to meet. She still had another on the way.
Castiel kissed his neck, his chest, anything and everything he could reach as his stomach turned to fire, or at least felt like it did. His hand grasped desperately at Dean’s shoulder which, though it no longer held his mark, had always felt like
He was out the door before either had time to process.
"I agree. We could start a garden, if you want. I want to contribute somehow here."
Charlie snorted. “Ugh. Yes. I think a couple of them have Oregon Trail on them.”
Til the day that I die.
"Yeah. 'Cause even with the apocalypse n shit, it all led me to here. An' I like here," Dean whispered.
"Sam," she said, hand covering her mouth as Orion's blood marred the water. "Oh my god. What have I done?" She turned to him, wide-eyed. "Bring him back."
"No."
Gabriel jumped. He couldn't remember the last time some had
"It would be a dangerous drinking game."
"I was unaware that breasts had their own physics," Castiel said, suddenly beside him.
“Well, he kissed me, so. If not, I think we’re headed there.”
with a spoken solemn vow
“Your palms are scarred,” Dean said. “Why do I know that?”
“Oh my god.”
“I am.”
to believe you, you’d have to tell me how long I’ve been down here.”
"Go ahead. You wanna say something? Then say something. I'm giving you your damn chance so make it count, demon."
"Sam…"
"I don't know."
Castiel linked his fingers through Dean’s. “That’s why you have me. I’ll keep you from doing anything…
“He did.”
“You’re… petting me,” Dean half-accused.
Castiel led her dutifully down the hall, to the right, into the map room. An arch had been set up, with chairs facing, chairs filled with so many of their family.
He looked up again, suddenly unsure whether he was irritated or incredibly, incredibly proud. "You're both dumbasses and I couldn't be more proud."
“How did you know?”
Cas kissed Dean's fingertips as they passed by his lips. "No anxiety? No worries?"
Rowena tilted her head to one side, then the other. "Well, I wouldn't say
"God's plan is always... It's always right even if... Even if it seems
Dean yelled, shoving Castiel away. "What is your fucking
“Why?”
Dean pushed him out of the small bathroom, closing the door and locking it just as what he dreaded most crawled up his throat.
"Thank you!"
"Sam?"
"I thought you of all people would—"
"How the fuck-"
There was a… hand? against his cheek, soft and forgiving. The softest thing he had ever felt, and littered with hard, jagged scars.
Gabriel was making a spell ingredient list as Rowena read it out to him.
“Mmhm?”
“Ye have some?”
“For better or for worse…”
“By just skinny dipping with her?”
You want to know how I got here, Dean? I
Sam was staring at him, wordless.
"I want you to know that Heathcliff and Catherine are both bitch-ass hoes that were toxic as fuck."
Dean said, "Okay."
“No,” Michael said. “NO! HE IS MY

Charlie cleared her throat. “We’re online, Sam.”
"And you can knit with me!" the old lady said.
Claire threw her hands up. "I always thought she would've been great with Bobby!"
Jack squinted. "So is Colonel Sanders a girl?"
He laid down on the bed, head on the blanket at the foot of it. “Hey, this still smells like you,” he told the blanket. “Weird. You never moved this. Said it was for vanity.” Sam took in a deep breath and let it out. “I think I’m gonna sleep here tonight, Dean. And I’m stealing your blanket.”

“Thank you, Mom,” Sam whispered back. “But, not your baby for much longer, huh?”
She nodded. “Your views are acknowledged and respected. However, you are outvoted in this regard, it seems.”
So we stole the car.
"I don't know what— oh. Moose." Gabriel snorted. "Sam doesn't have one because this all was
She rubbed her thumb against the back of his hand. "Aye. Maybe ye can teach a yoga class in town or somethin'?"
“Gosh, that doesn’t seem right. But, okay. You’re twenty-five, and you’re trying to figure yourself out. So, from adult to adult, do you want me to help you?”
Gabriel would wait until we were far enough away from Heaven that it was unlikely anyone would pursue, then he would fly upside-down and let me fall out of his wings.
Dean shook his head. “God wanted us to kill each other. I’m done doing what God wanted me to do.” With a harsh hiss, Dean doubled over, hands over his stomach. “Wha…?”
Castiel found himself drunk on vocal cords alone.
And Gabe thought now would be a bad time to mention that Castiel had once asked him the same questions, eons ago, about God. “Because the world isn’t fair, and it asks us to make decisions that have no right answer.”
Another.
Every now and then I try and just make it by"
“Of course I missed you. Of course I did.”
"Ah, yes. I noticed that, too." He spread his arms wide. "My glory days, I suppose."
Dean glanced over from where he was looking for a weapon, looking at the small object between Michael's fingers. "Seashells?"
“Jerk. You gonna sit down or…?”
“Yeah, really. Surprise me.” Dean stood up, stretching. “I’m gonna go take a shower. Pick one out by the time I get back?”
They left their drinks there, unfinished, and Dean led the way. "I take this route sometimes on the way home from work. It's... serene, I guess."
Sam put his hand on his door handle and went inside, still smiling.
She could just pull that one out, close her eyes, and pretend she was riding back with Dean. She could remain stuck in the time loop for as long as she wanted.
"I… Yes. I'll be there soon. Please, for the love o' God, stay put until then."
There were no more questions within Dean’s mind other than if Castiel’s skin still felt the same against his open lips, if his dreams had diminished or enhanced the memories, if that voice still quaked and rumbled like the raging sea when his head was thrown back. “Lead the way,” Dean managed before he was pulled through a grove, deep into the park and out the other side. Leaves still clung to his jacket in the way his hands would soon be clinging to Castiel.
“I was wrong to lie to you like that.”
to you…”
“Maybe we can even change both our names to Sean or Dam, huh? What do you think? Since we’re obviously supposed to be stuck together until the end of time.”
Dean sat down on the floor, head in his hands, focused on his breathing. Because he could feel the sharp stings of roots burrowing out, finally out, into diaphragm and stomach and intestines. Petals filled up his lungs, piece by piece, until they stuck to the back of his throat.
“Everyone misses you, in one way or another.”
Dean winced. “I mean, we—”
"What about Jody?"
Bet he can't even play anymore with those long-ass limbs of his.
Sam and Claire watched the moon rise sullenly over the horizon, casting strange reflections on the water's surface.
"Lead me to him."
Dean lay at the bottom of the pool, in just his boxers, staring at the ceiling.
Rowena placed a hot tea before Sam, sitting down across from him. "It would do ye well to drink somethin'," she said softly.
"I'm… I'm a shitty parent." Sam dragged his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them.
“Yes, ma’am.”
It was cold outside.
There was silence between them.
“You’ll… You think you can shut
“Ew.”

“How?
Well I don't know, I don't know
Michael forced Dean's hands open, pressed his fingers between Dean's, leaned down to whisper in his ear, lips brushing against it. "There is nothing I want from you," Michael whispered.
"You saying you'd worship me, Cas?" Dean asked, voice rough with sleep. His fingers trailed across Cas's jaw, down his neck and back up.
Dean made a slicing motion with his hand, finally revealing his eyes.
"Say my name," Dean whispered, pulling Castiel closer.
"How domestic," Rowena teased. "I need wormswort…"
"No fair

"I swear myself to you, Dean Winchester. Now get some sleep."
"Muscle to muscle
Let’s go find Charles and Gabe and Wena.”
“You have any children of your own?” she asked, pulling back and holding Sam’s face reverently.
Cas walked quietly over to their box of movies, slowly going through them. He knew which movie he was looking for. His favorite movie.
From that old hunched woman who lived inside a shoe
Blessed be the mystery of love"
When Sam and Maggie got back to the Bunker, all was quiet.
Gabriel rolled his eyes and tossed another ball. They were almost out. “That all ya got?”
"Every time my back hurts."
"Do you… want it to be?"
I was making my way through the crowd and I saw her. Isabelle, with another guy making out in a corner. I was as heartbroken as a kid can be. So I went to go back to Dean and Mark, but they weren’t in the bleachers anymore.
Castiel sat down beside him, leaning in close enough that Dean could smell the ozone on him. "She's your favorite, right?"
Dean's hand slipped as he fell asleep, coming to rest on Castiel's cheek.
Jody looked between them all. “You two may now take your seats,” she said, gesturing to two empty seats in the front row.
Forty was what Sam hoped for in college. Forty was what Sam was sure he’d never see before or after. Yet, here he was. Old.
"If you tell me what you fear, I'll let you hold me for ten seconds. It's super obvious you want to."

“Don’t.”
He shot her a grin. "I'm not gonna get to sleep anyway."
Dean rolled his eyes, well aware of his own face heating up. “Hey, Jude,” he began half-heartedly.
Dean splashed him. “Shut up. You know what I meant.”
Those days were glorious. We laid in the hot sun, splashed naked in the spring water. I found a love for the earth that Naomi had attempted to train out of me. Later on, under the blushing sky, I found a love for humanity, as well.
"Negatively how?"
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
"Fortnite?"
“I mean, we got Gabriel out, so how powerful is it really?”
I didn’t know what happened. I hoped maybe you had stopped him in time, that maybe the reason you weren’t calling was because you had an emotional car ride back.
Or, perhaps, he should just read a book.
“Still trying to beat Breath of the Wild.”
Naomi paled.
Michael got another deep gouge into Dean’s shoulder. “He
that brought our dead back to life. It was fine for a while, but then they turned on us all.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “That’s what got me into hunting.”
Dean blinked in surprise. "Did… Did you just call me Dad?"
Charles shrugged. “I’m told it’s like… black goo shaped like a person.”
"Ah, yes. Olympus."
When Dean could finally take in air again, he looked up through blurred eyes to see Sam, hair a mess and eyes red-rimmed.
Sam looked back to the pool, back to them, to the pool, to them, and suddenly he was hugging them as tight as he possibly could. “Yes!” he exclaimed. “I love it! How did you—?”
Maggie had gotten stronger, and, even though her pace was faster because she was shorter, she kept up with Sam.
Not even, not even football! Just soccer, for some godforsaken reason!
“I think I’ll just give you a long list of questions, and we can go through them as needed,” Dean deadpanned.
Sam met Gabriel’s eyes, who smiled wickedly. “Oh. Oh, you’re
"Then we'll do a picnic."
“I am Sam.”
"Yeah, I did." He glanced the list over and sighed. "I know all this stuff is in the Bunker somewhere, but shit keeps moving so much I can't find any of it."
Gabriel shut his notebook decisively and walked over to Jack. “Ice cream?” he asked softly.
You’re literally talking to me from somewhere on dry land!”
“To be my lawfully wedded husband.”
Rowena brushed a strand of hair behind his ear, frowning. "Do ye think it was the end?"
Claire plodded down a hallway, Jack right beside her. “Yeah, maybe. That’s— what? Coupla days? I don’t think we have the time or money for that.”
"It's like I'm laying on Bobby's couch."
back,” Dean told him, legs shaking. “I only need to look wherever you are.”
"Sammy?" Dean tried to say, but it came out raspy and grating.
"Say it again," Dean begged in a breath of air.
“Do the kids know?”
Sam laughed. “Sounds fantastic. Let’s go eat some. I’m starving.”
Dean almost laughed, a soft sound escaping his lips. "Hey, Cas?"
"And I'm human, fully," Jack whispered. "The last of my grace was used to do that."
"I'm not sure what that says about him, truthfully." Fergus eyed the pudding cup suspiciously before opening it. "What about Feathers? Isn't he around here somewhere?"
"He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
He padded silently to his room, pulling on his work boots and a jacket.
Dean pushed frantically against Michael's chest, to no avail.
"I have Gabriel for both of those things," Sam said off-handedly.
“I did it,” she finally whispered in awe.
Michael pressed one hand to his nose in shock, eyes narrowing at the blood. “You wanna play dirty? Fine. Let’s play dirty.”
"What about Jack?"
Charlie turned her chair towards Donna, keeping an eye on her own screen. “Uh, yeah. Unfortunately. Michael deleted his memories.”
Gabe shrugged, circling his hand in the air. "Did you not wanna know? Your doctor was an idiot. It's a girl."
Sam and Rowena shared a glance before Sam walked over to Gabriel, grabbed his shirt, and pulled him in for a kiss. “Date me,” Sam said.
That was Cas, Dean thought. So in love with Earth and everything that inhabited it. He was beautiful, inside and out, even with the cracks Dean could see, the cracks that had showed he had been broken again and again, and yet still found wonder in something as small as a winged insect.
It's time for
"I felt it. Inside. Like Castiel was yelling through me."
"One at a time."
"I'm glad I found you, too," Maggie whispered back, leaning down to give her a sweet, soft kiss.
Dean groaned. “Oh my god Castiel we are
I’m not even sure Gabe
"It's not so bad, 'losing'."
Claire gasped. "This one's my favorite!"
"Do you still love him?"
"She's fine," Castiel mouthed against his lips. "Everyone is fine now." He kissed him, gently. "How long?"
So Claire hit shuffle and let the world choose.
“That’s the second time I’ve heard that today,” Castiel said back, smiling softly.
Raphael turned to the angel, face blank. “Ah, yes. Naomi. How wonderful of you to voice your opinion. Is there anyone else?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know.” Sam gave her a smile. “And I will.”
God, the sunlight lasted so long. When was the last time he had been outside for more than just a run or an errand?
Sam, this isn't permanent. It's forever, yeah, but not permanent. One day the sun will collapse in on itself and become a black hole, and the Earth and everything on it will be destroyed (though, I doubt much will be left). And on that day, my coffin will open, and I'll be out. On that day, I will see you again. You and everyone else. And you can tell me all about what adulthood was like. You can tell me what beautiful things you did with your life.
He'd be lying if he said it wasn't relaxing. No stressors, no anything. Just the gentle pressure of water and the kaleidoscope of colors before him.
Claire’s bottom lip trembled.
I'm thinking of you.

Dean snorted, leaning back in his seat. “I hope you all get dodo chickens.”
Did… Did you blame me for this? For not noticing sooner? Is it somehow
Sam took in a shuddering breath. “I want that, too. I’ve never… I never really had a mom.” He sat down beside her. “I didn’t even remember you for most of my life. All I had was Dean and Dad. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
“And now he’s

Man, he must really miss Dean to be angling for soft bullying.
"I'm not… following."
Something passed over Sam's face, something new and terrifying and beautiful.
Glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door to the bathroom was firmly closed, he ran his thumb under the lip of it, the old glue giving way easily. He knew the handwriting before he had even unfolded it and glanced at the signature.
There were thunderclouds and lightning, and the earth jolted a second time.
Dean nodded, sobbing slightly.

“Absolutely not,” Castiel responded, shoulders shaking.

Claire’s face fell. “Aw… damn…”
an answer,” Gabriel snapped back. He took a breath. “But if it helps at all… he did tell you goodbye.”
Castiel was slouched, blood flowing freely from his many wounds, face contorted in pain.
Her eyes widened comically. “Wait. Fairies exist?!”
And the angels have the same
“Yeah, okay. What are we gonna do instead?”
“What are you—
"I know."
"Not so sure about that…"
Dean sighed, readjusting his hold on the kid. "I miss you, okay? And I love you very much. But this is how it's gotta be."
Dean nodded. "I mean, yeah. Ya know. This isn't real, Michael tricks, yadda yadda. I've gotten better at figuring them out since the bar incident."
"Really? Why?"
Maggie snorted, tossing her book aside. "He thinks you're after his territory!" She lunged to grab Colonel Sanders, catching him easily. "That's Jack!" she told him. "That's your dad!"
“Sam?”
"Yes. Quite tragically, actually. I'm old. You know that. I was made to be old, to live forever. He was not."
Dean nodded, tilted his head to the side a little, and swallowed hard. “So you ain’t gonna tease me if I cry all over you right now, then.”
But he didn’t want to be alone, either.
“Wha—
He walked silently to his door, opening and closing it as quietly as possible.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Bitch.”
Claire huffed after she had gone. "I swear," she told Maggie, "this is the most secretive group of people in the whole damn world."
The universe is ever-expanding, which I suppose is proof that God started creation and then left. The deists, I suppose, were right in that regard. Or perhaps He is out there somewhere, charting new courses.
"Yeah," the baker agreed. "Why, I bet he's even got himself another squirrel friend."
“Exactly. I don’t necessarily think I should have to console you about a few wet dreams about your tormentor.”
Dean kissed his cheeks, kissed some tears away. "I am home," he whispered, eyes screwed shut.

“Maybe.” Gabriel pitched another, slower, and Jack hit it. “Talk.”
Bobby walked over to them, resting his forearms on the back of Mary’s chair. “Gonna impart your wisdom to them?” he teased.
Maggie winked at him. “Yeah. I know.” She stepped out to the side with one leg and Gabriel copied. “You’re invited, by the way.”
She'd have seen him find Castiel's phone laying on the dock, with a small goodbye note open on the screen.
"Wena! It's me!" Gabriel whispered loudly.
"I'm aware."
"Pathetic. You know, I really thought the Sam thing would work. I mean, who could say no to those precious baby eyes?"
Sam sighed. "I know."
Castiel stilled, and then there was a soft, heavenly laugh. “Oh, don’t tell me
Rowena took in a deep breath and let it out. These were the hard words, the stone ones she knew. "That's the most terrifyin' thing about losin' someone. The day you don't think about them anymore."
Sam's hands slammed down on the table, his face unreadable. "What do you mean?"
"We've got some contacts."
I know you are not implying we commit…
And praises of God were overrated and old, so Castiel took a few liberties.
“Castiel,” Jody teased. “Dean’s gotta say his first.”
“Yeah.”
He couldn’t remember the last time he was truly happy. Of course, he knew now he couldn’t remember a lot of things. Dean was positive he had been happy with Castiel before. And here he was, happy again.
“Everyone…?”

I ah… I almost stepped on the first fish to crawl onto land.
“Yeah? I—”
Sam grinned at him. “Dude. Get your own place if you want. Maybe I used to be obsessed but…” He looked out at the gathered crowd, all close together and chatting and laughing. “Things have changed.”
Charlie ignored her.
Maggie kept her eyes firmly forward. To look over at Sam would be to acknowledge that this conversation was raw in their hearts. "You know we love you?"
The look in Castiel’s eyes spoke volumes.
"A blue fruit, used mostly in dishes such as the ratatouille, from France," he informed her, spinning and rolling to behind her.
Castiel was staring down at his shoes, which were black, or at least they looked that way to Dean. He was afraid to look into Castiel’s eyes, afraid that the only thing that had ever held color for him would be that same godforsaken grey.
Sam sank his head into his hands. “I really, really don’t know, Dean. If I did, I’d tell you. I’d tell you in a heartbeat.”
guys?!"
“Of course!” Dean responded, whole body shaking. “Mr. and Mr. Castiel Winchester, Bottom of the Ocean, Big Box.”
Castiel looked around the giant Void, spread his sparse wings as far as he could. "I see."
Castiel met his eyes. “I have learned much in my time in the depths.”
Blood trickled down the stems onto his chin, his shirt, the floor.
Castiel looked up from his phone. “Yes?”
“What are you doing?” he asked softly.
“Hey, Sam?” she asked quietly, not wanting to break the silence but having to anyway.
Sam sighed, putting the food onto another serving platter. “Sure, but who’s to say I’m even
Sam grimaced. "Yeah. I know. I'm not— I'm not incompetent, you know. There are stages of grief and you three are…" He sighed. "You three are in the anger stage. I get it."
Those moments of realization made Dean’s hatred worse. He wanted to strangle Castiel. He wanted to rip the bones from his flesh. He wanted to shove his tongue so far down his throat that he couldn't breathe. He wanted to know what unearthly sounds demons made when they were as close to Heaven as Dean could feasibly bring them.
Not Castiel 2.0.
"Then I hope she wins."
The fear has gripped me but
"What about Claire?"
“We do?” Cas asked, letting himself be pulled. “Why?”
"I don't know." She turned her head to the nearest door, behind which she could hear snoring. "But I intend to find out."
"Wanna listen?" Claire asked, voice scratchy.
"Always is with the Winchesters," Fergus sighed. "Did he open the Empty or something?"

And there Sam was with that look again, like wonder and awe all mixed in together.
Maggie cradled the still-damp egg in her hands. "On it!"
Maggie shook her head. "You were listening to us yesterday, weren't you?"
She stuck a finger into his chest. "You need to let all these people help. We
“And that bothers me.”
Sam's little fists had wrapped themselves in Dean's shirt. "No."
He does!” Michael gritted out, blood spurting between his fingers.
You stopped by, asked where he was. I said I didn’t know.
Dean smirked and leaned in for a victory kiss.
She resisted the urge to glance over, focusing instead on her breathing. "And you're at bargaining."
Sam began shaking his head, but Gabe pressed his hand to the side of it, halting him.
“Eh? I think so?”
wait, no. Oklahoma. It was in Oklahoma, and Sam and I were little kids. Dad was hunting who-knows-what, and we were in town for a couple of months. So we signed up for school.
Dean held still for as long as he could before letting his watery breath out. “Not in your lifetime.” He waited for his fingers to stop shaking before splaying them across Castiel’s chest. “Hey, Cas?”
Let me go."
"Sure you were. Admit it: I always win in these little banters of ours."
Castiel took a beer out of the fridge and handed it to Dean. “They mean well.”
I want you to know there's nothing you could have done.
“Sam, do
Dean saw it, then. A beautiful bird, glorious and colorful, flying from tree to tree. It was his bird, he was sure of it. It warbled a sweet song.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asked softly.
And Sam wanted so badly to ignore his own hurt, wanted so badly to just not be
Rowena opened the door onto Sam having crawled onto the foot of the bed, half-covered by wings. It was Jack that was snoring, face smushed into a pillow and one foot lodged firmly in Sam's side.
And you're the sky"
"Teenagers scare
Sam held out his little baby hands, making a grabby motion. “Up.”
I would see his eyes, desperate for my return, and wish I could shake off my mantle as angel of God. That I could step out of my vessel and stand before him, that I could be human.
Dean couldn’t breathe, pushing uselessly against Michael’s arm.
Because I want to see people and I
“So?”
I tried to get Dean’s attention, but his eyes were closed. Mark saw me, instead, and he gave me this like, shy smile, sorta. So I smiled back at him and headed their way.
She grinned at them. “Showtime.”
Charlie pursed her lips and nodded to herself. "Alright. I see how it's gonna be. You wanna do this all yourself, right?"
"If we could just get a fucking
Jack popped his head out of a tent. "It's gonna be Claire, Maggie, and me in this tent. You, Jody, and Donna can have that other one. Sam and Rowena get the little one."
Gabe snorted. “Amen, sister. I’m guessing Jody’s gonna conduct it?”
Castiel frowned. "To torture me, I think."
Rowena looked pointedly to Jody, who told him, "Two days."
There was a brief surge of light, and Dean felt different.
"You're just the gay manager next door to me."
“Well, that’s not true. Sam said you used to sing for him.”
Sam snorted. “Very funny. I was thinking, I want to tell him you're my girlfriend. And I want to ask you if it’s okay if that’s true.”
“This isn’t… weird?”
Dean looked down through blurry eyes to the red shirt which didn’t used to be red, to the jeans which weren’t always this dark. He saw the faces on his arms in passing, like they were in one eye and not the other. “Fix me,” he begged.
Michael blinked in surprise. "I… no. I suppose you wouldn't."
“No kidding. Now, showers? Showers I would do for fun.”
He made note of the few inches he had above them before resting himself fully on Dean. "There were gods, and there were men. Among the former is where most put me. Among the latter was Patroclus."
Maybe next we can read research books and program computers!”
Rowena stopped, turning to raise an amused eyebrow at him. "Are we what?"
his son…” Gabriel threw the ball. “I would be pissed. I’d probably hate him, actually.”
"What's wrong?" Rowena stressed each syllable.
And he was like, “It’s Texas. No one’s gonna bat an eye.”
Castiel’s smile was blinding as he held his arm out for her to take. “I’m honored to be walking you down the aisle. I love you very much.”
The song faded to silence, but his heartbeat remained.
And the sky rumbled, and a face Artemis had never seen was beside them, attached to a formless body.
Getting colder, colder"
And Castiel felt human again, for how many emotions were pouring out of him. “Dean doesn’t remember me. He thinks… He thinks I’m Alastair.”
Dean opened his eyes long enough to see Sam smushing his own face. "You get a kish now," Sam said between his squished cheeks.
Sam took out his phone and opened his notes. "Maybe we can order some seeds for them, too? And then Maggie and Claire can plant them."
"When everything's made to be broken
"But what if I really can save them?" Sam whispered.
Cas hid his smile in Dean’s collarbone, then rolled his eyes and kissed Dean softly on his lips. “Then it’s settled. I’ll come home.”
“No?”
Castiel glanced over at Dean, whose eyes were wide with worry. "I'm a bit tired," he admitted.
Dean pursed his lips, looking at a young Sam in soccer gear. “Cas talked to Michael.”
"And if it doesn't?"
Sam looked down into his coffee, like he could read the nonexistent grounds in the mug. "Thank you."
like someone that loves you?!” Michael looked away, so Dean grabbed his face harshly and turned it back towards him. “I
"Me, too."
"Bottom of the ocean, I'm afraid."
Dean looked over at Cas. "Like… at all?”
She laid a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “Call them sometimes, too. They love you.”
“Now, ya said we were lookin’ for…?”
Mary smiled softly. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Slept for more than—"
Because all that you are
"Dark magic, I'm sure."
“You need them in case you hit the ball to third base while the catcher is still trying to organize a deck of cards.”
"Beg me," Michael crooned, caressing Dean's face with his fingers, clenching them around his jaw, his throat. "
“Can you see in here?”
Charles shook her head. “I don’t know. I think… I think this re-established the link. One is before where you just went, and one is after.”
“Yes.”
“Maybe I would if you ever had anything interesting to say,” Dean snapped back.
“ENOUGH!” Michael snapped, shoving them both into their seats with a wave of his hand. He glared at Gabriel. “There will be no ultimatum.” He turned to Naomi. “You are free to dissent. You are free to try to stop us. We are not holding the past against anyone.” His eyes flitted briefly to Castiel.
And Castiel could hold on no longer.
They looked at each other, both frozen. Jack wanted to call out, but what could he say? Was it Uncle Gabe? But Sam was his dad now. And that would make that weird.
Dean’s cheeks were ten degrees past red. “Alright, filing you saying ‘fuck’ away for later.”

“That is fine. Simply let them know it is allowed now.” Raphael turned to the other archangels. “Brothers,” she said, addressing them. “It is time.”
He picked up the jar at his feet, relaxing at the smooth touch of glass.
“Oh.” Jack walked around the perimeter. It was blue-tiled, obviously old. “He didn’t have a problem at the lake.”
"And it was like…" Jack made a grasping motion. "Like we could move whatever we wanted and see the ripples, could see what would happen and why and how."
The two stared at a dark room filled with computers.
“I mean, we could clean it up. He likes to exercise.”
Castiel rammed him into the wall again, desperately.

"Come now, you didn't think it would all be this easy, did you?" Michael studied Dean's face, grinning. "Oh my. You did."
"It might be good to hit them up."
When humans look up at Polaris, I can't help but think, 'No. That is not Polaris. That is Gabriel.'

"Yeah? Thought I was your sister. Thought Jack was your kid. Guess family really does end in blood, huh?"
There was something sad in Dean’s eyes, something that told Michael,
They left the kitchen as Claire went back into the map room.
Dean held his sides, trying to calm down. “Hey, Cas? I know how to solve all of this.”
Castiel shook his head. “The truth has been amended over the ages, but there is a reason many indigenous tribes believe the world to be carried by an animal. They are bigger than you can imagine, and far more primal and ravenous.”
Sam was pushed and shoved to the side of the room, and everyone but him laughed as a baby photo of him in a duck suit came on.
to Heaven? We don’t even know what happened to the Hell souls.”
Dean listened in the silence to Castiel's deep, even breathing and smiled to himself.
"It's where angels and demons go when they die. I've been a few times, though I only remember once. I'm afraid I took after you and made a deal with it to ensure my son's safety."

But I need more than myself this time"
He cried grace.
“I, Castiel,” Cas repeated, lost in Dean’s green eyes.
"What?"
Jack sniffed. “I don’t hate that.”
Charlie waved at someone off the road, and by the time Claire had turned to look, they were too far off to see.
"Oh."
"Right now I'm talking to you, asshole. What's your greatest fear?"
Castiel leaned his heads back and roared, and Sam couldn’t have smiled harder if he tried.
with the archangel Michael?” Castiel’s hands were shaking against Dean’s face. This wasn’t what he planned on coming back to. “What do you mean you thought he was me?”
“You’re gonna be twenty-five years older than it. And it’s gonna be your superior.”

"Of course not," Cas deadpanned. "This is reality, Dean."
"It's your consolation prize," Cas rumbled, angling his head to press another kiss against Dean's open mouth.
“Some. I can’t see perfectly, but I can see pretty well.”
Sam blinked away the void, taking his palms off the now-hot table. “Was I gone too long?” he asked, turning to Charlie.
Rowena laughed softly. “Aye, it was a fantastic night. Yer gonna have one gale of a headache tomorrow, though.” She laced her fingers through Gabriel’s, resting their hands on Sam’s chest.
Sam declined drinks, doubtless still nursing the very edges of a headache from the night before. He made breakfast for everyone (or brunch, really) and served up pancakes before setting to cooking the veggie bacon.
We would fly in droves and watch the swirls in disbelief, for out of nothing there came Something. We circled time after time, watching as the rock hardened, as dirt formed, as the first microscopic organisms began their equally microscopic journeys.
your fault, buddy.”
“Oh, it was a Christmas present from Bobby last year—”
Dean blinked, and he was in a room with a table for two, a locked door, and tons of blinking computers.
'Cause everything looks old and tired when she leaves my side"
Which left Mary.
He sighed, and when he opened his eyes, he wasn't in the void anymore.
And Dean sighed. “Tell me anyway.”
I will always love
"It's so cold down here," Castiel whispered to Dean's unhearing ears. "Was it always this cold?"
"Am I not?" Dean asked, surprised right back.
Castiel led Claire to the arch, kissing her forehead. “I believe this is where I take my leave,” he whispered, making to go.

"Yeah, I didn't get that reference. C'mon. You're an angel. Lay some angelic wisdom on me."
Dean ran his hands along Castiel’s bare chest, feeling every inch he could, memorizing him. “We’ve been together for a thousand years. I forgot you for a thousand. And you’re still here.”
“They seem fantastic,” Mary whispered.
Gabriel enunciated, “he took you in as his own. You.
Goodbye, Sam.

Sleeping now to rise again"
"Ye got all that?" she asked, looking up from her grimoire.
“No,” Sam said seriously. “That only happens if you get three home runs in a row.”
"Right."
“Shush. When I was a bad person — an' I was — I would never have woken up wonderin’ whether I was doin’ the right thing. An’ I never
I remember flying out to the clouds with Gabriel, before solid form existed, when chemicals were swirling mesmerizingly and we wondered to ourselves what could possibly be more beautiful.
“Right.”
He was not a bad angel.
Sam shook his head, eyes shining in the moonlight. "How did you not
It had come from Dean.
There was Jody and Donna, Mary and Bobby, Claire and Maggie, Gabriel and Rowena, and Charlie.
“I’ve hurt a lot of people. You know that.”
Jack nodded at the two of them. “I’ll go now. Goodbye, Dad.”
“Sam,” Gabriel said, almost laughing. “No crying while we’re trying to fix your dumbass-ed-ness.”
"What did I ever do to you?"
deep inside you. You'll feel something missing from your life and have no way to find it." Michael opened his hand and dropped the shell, and Dean was quick to catch it. He cradled it in his hands, examining blue swirls with the madness of a desperate man.
Gabe snorted, turning his face away from her hand. "You're one to talk. Where have you and Claire been for the past thirty minutes?"
Hoo, hold on. Give me a second to stop laughing. I've got this.
Castiel was shaking his head, the setting sun haloing his hair. “I don’t know that I want that, either.”
“I think… I think I’m broken.”
Castiel made some un-nameable sound.
"Isn't here. Just us. Just our consciousnesses. We ran every scenario. You and I can't stay long, but... You're safe, Dean. You're safe here."
There was a calloused hand against his cheek, a soft smile he couldn’t see. “I have told you that I have seen Creation. I have named stars, watched humanity from both afar and up close. Do you not have faith in me?”
“I love him,” she said gently. “More than anything. He understands me. We’re two birds of a feather. We’ve been through so much of the same stuff and came out stronger because of it. I couldn’t imagine life without him.”
