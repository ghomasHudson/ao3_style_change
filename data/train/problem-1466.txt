"John. Oh. Hell. Would you believe a barbering accident? No. I wouldn't either, just put that, hmm - on the desk? Damn. I didn't think he'd actually -"
"I didn't expect him to be kind," John said simply, as he pulled out his wallet. Greg shook his head and mumbled, "On the house." John nodded his thanks, slipped from the stool, and headed for the door. "Night, Greg. Thanks." Greg nodded him a good night and watched as he walked out into the night.
At a casual glance, they appeared to be an odd couple: one, sleek in black from head to toe, save for the slash of cobalt blue - the other, a bit on the shorter side, in shades of tan, and yet, if one looked closer, one might catch that moment when their eyes met, see a smile shared between them, and recognise the rarest and truest of love stories.
They both froze at a knock on the door. "Yeah, what is it?" Dee growled out as Sherlock opened the door. "Sorry -" She kissed Donovan's forehead, and got up from her chair. "I need some crappy coffee." She looked over at Donovan and said, "I'll be back soon, okay?"
Greg sighed and rubbed his face with his hands. "There are reasons I don't talk about -" John nodded. "Mycroft and I - we had been together before I joined up, but we had one of those stupid arguments that young couples have, and I left, and then joined up. Mycroft found out that I was hurt and helped me through rehab, and eventually we got back together. Sherlock had been in boarding school, and Myc and I got married the summer before he went to Cambridge. Sherlock hasn't really forgiven me for leaving how I did. I just left. It was stupid. I've always regretted it - one day -" He stopped speaking and put the glass away, then met John's eyes. "You're a good guy, John. He's a bit lost right now, trying to find his place in the world. He doesn't have to do it on his own, and I know you -"
Greg rubbed at his nose, then shoved his hands into his pockets and blew out a breath before the words tumbled out."When I - returned, the first time I opened my eyes and found you sitting there next to me, I don't think I ever said what it meant that it was you." Mycroft blinked at him for a moment and watched as Greg moved into the room then knelt in front of him. "I never said."
Somehow he knew he didn't want to talk, so he put on CD of some classical stuff, he should know it, it sounded familiar, violin and piano. He allowed himself to take a deep breath and slowly let it out again as the drape was placed over him, and he closed his eyes for the first time in a couple of days. When he opened them again, it was as if there was a different person sitting in the chair. He looked and felt at least five years younger. He had no idea what -
John nodded, then got to his feet, picked up Sherlock's tea and tossed it in the closest bin. "I'm starving. Let's get something that approaches actual tea, I know a place -" He paused and met Sherlock's interested gaze, then watched as he got to his feet and shrugged into his jacket.
"It's been a few days since I washed my hair, and it's about to drive me 'round the bend, do you think you could, I mean, if -"
“It was a warning. There must have been some reason James didn’t want to tell you he came this kind of wealth, the books in Tad’s rooms - yes, he was a scientist, a chemist and a lover of poetry, but he also had shelves of books dating back to the American Civil War, histories of families, including his own that made a fortune from slavery. Tad lived with the past, reminded himself of it on a daily basis, while James tried to escape it. In the end -”
"Yes, no. I don't know - I just know I'm going to lose my mind if I have to deal with Mrs Hudson dusting every hour - and moving is -"
John placed a single finger on Sherlock's lips and shook his head. "Let me finish? You are the most brilliant, compassionate, and by far the most beautiful man I've ever met."
John dropped to his knees across from him and examined the corpse. "Strangulation. Probably a scarf."
"I was just walking," John muttered, but walked up to the bar and dropped onto a stool, then picked up the pint and drained half of it before setting it down again. "I went over to Baker Street to see how Sherlock was coping."
He leaned in and stole his next words with an awkward, but sweet kiss, and sighed as John's hand settled into his hair and pulled him closer. He sat back after a moment to catch his breath and studied him as if seeing him for the first time all over again. "From the very first moment you walked into the shop and sat down in that chair, you changed me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I decided that I would do my very best to one day be enough for you."
John let out a shuddering sigh and let Sherlock ease the cup of coffee from his hands. “I was back - Afghanistan.”
“John. It doesn’t matter.” He pulled his phone out of his pocket and turned it off without letting go of John for a moment. “Look at me.” John looked at up him and breathed out a sigh of relief. “It’s done. Are you hungry? You must be hungry.”
Sherlock huffed and pulled out the first file. "It took us a year to become partners, besides, I don't think anyone else will work with me." He looked up shyly to find her trying to stifle a laugh. "Whatever it is, I'm sure you and Dee will be fine."
"Wish I could see you at a crime scene, I bet you are something," John answered, then abruptly got to his feet and walked into the kitchen in search of tea.
“I see that,” Sherlock squinted at the one whose hand was still hanging in the air. “And why exactly are you here?”
He does it on purpose, John thought to himself as he watched Sherlock work the crime scene, not a curl out of place, and he was wearing the purple shirt that always made his eyes go a bit more green.
“No - I met him and his brother, his twin brother, Thaddeus, at Uni - he went by Tad, they were -” He paused and turned to look at Sherlock. “There’s no way James did anything to Tad, he never would have hurt him.”
“It was a warning - no, more than that, it was a death threat, Doc. I found this on the desk next to him, his body - or what was left of it.”
"For Donovan. Dee said romance novels, and chocolates are the things that she likes when she's under the weather. So, which cover, modern or 'historical'? And I'm sure by historical they mean as accurate as a Daily Mail headline."
John lowered his book, and looked over at the elegant figure who stood at the window. He hadn't spoken in two days, his curls were in disarray, and he hadn't eaten anything but toast with honey since the last case had ended three days previously. John set the book aside, and considered getting up to turn on the kettle, but saw the slender shoulders slump in resignation, and he knew tea wasn't what was needed.
"Is it just as a man and his barber, which is one of the strongest relationships a man can have these days, or is it, if I may be so blunt, made of stronger stuff?"
"Not really, probably would have been better if you'd interrupted a few seconds earlier." She took the bag and peeked inside. "Chocs and romances? Dee." She rolled her eyes and pulled out the first book. "Must have taken you hours to track these down."
John felt his face warm slightly at Sherlock's words, and he coughed, then cleared his throat. "I've known them a long time. Donovan and Dee. If the world was fair, Donovan would be DI, not me, but the world isn't fair, and she hates the politics and -"
He sighed and considered shoving it in his pocket and beginning again, but what he had written was the truth, and he thought Sherlock would understand better than most. He picked up his jacket from the chair, and turned towards the door, but stopped to cover Sherlock with the throw from the the back of the couch, and placed the note on the coffee table where he was sure to see it. He paused as Sherlock made a slight sound then settled quietly again, and he moved silently to the door and with one last backward glance, walked out and closed it behind him.
John once again wrapped his arm around him, and more or less half-carried him to the front room, where Mrs Hudson had indeed left dinner for two, including a bottle of wine that had been decanted. Sherlock laughed as John helped arrange the pillows again for his ankle then settled on the chair across from him. "She has taken a liking to you or she's just appreciative that she doesn't have to try to nag at me to -"
"Not many people understood him, he was always lost in his own thoughts, James was the only one he would listen to. He did his best to help him keep his balance - Tad had always expected something like 9/11 to happen, so it didn't affect him as it did James, he wasn't close to his parents, and when James joined up, they had stopped speaking -"
John stood in front of the bookcases and studied the contents closely for the first time. Some he knew had to come with the flat itself, surely Sherlock had no use for the dusty volumes of Dickens and Austen -
"Yeah, I was at Cambridge, and I tried out for the Footlights - I wasn't quite funny enough," Sherlock muttered as he turned his attention to the last of the dumplings. "You know Greg."
"These last couple of days," John began, then stopped and bit his lip. Sherlock waited and watched him carefully. "I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and I'll be back in my bedsit, and you - all this was just in my imagination, but I woke up and you were there, still asleep, and I couldn't bear to wake you up. So, I've just been watching you. I have the feeling that once you get back on your feet, you won't need much sleep or me for that matter, and I just -"
He shrugged, and rumbled quietly, "Reading was one of the few things that got me through the 'fidgets' - especially when you read me to sleep." He didn't look in her direction, but down at his hands, and she remembered the 'fidgets' all too well. The days and nights when she would sit by his bedside as she did her paperwork, and he couldn't sleep, or wouldn't, even though it was the best thing he could have done for himself then. The times when he did manage to fall asleep, it was never a peaceful rest. She knew he was fighting something, what it was exactly, he could never tell her, when she was finally able to call him back to full awareness. She watched as he turned the monitor back round again and thought back even further.
John tried to smile, but failed and Sherlock held his face in his hands and kissed him lightly, then sat back and studied him for a moment. “Let’s go to the house - might be dangerous, up for it?”
John nodded. "People think they have a right to know, think they will 'understand'. They won't, they can't." John put his emptied container down and cleared his throat. "Thank you, for this. Been a long time since I really laughed."
both young and stupid," Mycroft answered quietly, then waited for Greg to look up him. "We are still here, love, older and wiser, hmm?"
"John." He held out his hand and John hesitated for a moment, then took the offered hand and shook it, he couldn't remember the last time someone had shaken his hand.
"I interrupted something," Sherlock said as he took Dee's seat, then handed Donovan one of the bags he was holding.
"Breathe," John murmured against his chest. "Just breathe, some days if that's all we can do, that's enough. Just breathe, for me?"
“No, he is dead, that is a fact, Mr Holmes, what I find hard to believe is how it happened, but the facts as they stand are that either he killed himself, or I killed him and cannot remember doing it.”
"Your scars do not define you, John. You are more than what happened to you, and you are beautiful." He pressed his lips against the worst of the damage, and pulled away as John froze. "I'm sorry."
"Maybe not, but we're partners, and I needed to be sure you were okay. Besides, I had nothing else on at the moment." He managed a lopsided grin and she rolled her eyes at him.
"You did all you could do, and you made it home, and I, for one, am so very grateful you did. I'm going to put the kettle on."
Lestrade dropped into the chair in the waiting room and watched Sherlock pace in silence for a couple of minutes, then got to his feet, blocked his path, and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. "You know -" he began in his most avuncular tone.
John blinked at the long cold plain toast and tea on the bedside table, then looked over at Sherlock as he slept. He could tell from the darkness under his eyes that he had been sleeping little the last couple of days. He knew he should get up and shower and try to do something, he had cases to write up, and he should go to the shops.
"My dear, that's simple, you wouldn't still be here now, if he didn't. Now, do try to get some rest, your room is made up, it's small, but it's a good room, I think you'll find."
"On the contrary." John waited for him to go on, but he stopped and bit his lip. "I need a bit of assistance -"
John nodded as he leaned his stick against an empty chair, then froze as the barber - no barber he'd ever met looked like, well, he'd only seen photos of Michelangelo's David, but he could imagine someone like the man who helped him out of his jacket could have served as the model. Dark curls, the piercing green eyes - sharp angles leading to the fullest lips he had ever seen. "Hmm, thank you."
"Dinner has arrived if I am not mistaken and I'm rarely mistaken. She's taken to making things that I can easily stab at, even though she knows the likelihood of me actually eating -"
"Is that an offer Dr Watson?" Sherlock grinned back at him, then groaned as he tried to sit up taller.
"Sally asked me to marry her. She always said she didn't need a ring or a piece of paper, and after all this time, she's just changed her mind."
When he returned with a mug in each hand a few minutes later, Sherlock hadn't moved a muscle. John placed the mug of tea where Sherlock could easily reach it, then sat down again, and sipped at his tea.
“Hmmm?” He looked up from the crossword puzzle in his hand and wondered when he would get used to the way Sherlock would look at him, as if memorising him as he was at that moment in time.
Sherlock walked over to the ancient fireplace, picked up a poker and explored the half burnt remains. “He was worried.”
They walked in companionable silence to a small shop tucked away from the regular tourist routes. John held the door open for Sherlock, and watched his reaction. Sherlock stopped short and took a deep breath in, then let it go slowly as he felt his shoulders drop for the first time all day. The small space seemed to glow; the walls were of a soft yellow, and the scent of apples and cinnamon were the very antithesis of the environs of the hospital. He dropped into an ancient leather seat he closed his eyes and sighed. "Brilliant."
"No, it's perfect." The shampoo was worked through slowly, rinsed, then conditioner - he wondered what John thought of his one vanity, at least when it came to his physical appearance, but then John's fingers were in his hair again, and he couldn't care less what John thought at the moment, as long as he kept doing exactly - he sighed as the conditioner was rinsed out and John helped him to sit up.
"No, I don't mind," John answered, then dropped into the chair next to the bed and watched as Sherlock closed his eyes, even as he fought to stay awake. He wondered what to say that could be of interest to the man who seemed to know everything about him, when he realized it was more that Sherlock felt like he needed to give him a reason to stay, and he understood at that moment that he'd stay as long as Sherlock wanted him to. It startled him for a moment, but as Sherlock opened his eyes again, he settled back further in his chair, and began to tell him a story, a story he had started to write years ago, but had left unfinished, perhaps now he could find an ending for it.
John stared at his computer screen. He was exhausted. He should be soundly sleeping as Rosie was in her Moses Basket. He looked at her sadly and then back to the flashing cursor next to his meager bank balance. He couldn’t keep taking advantage of his friends as he had been. Rosie was not quite a year old yet, but she would need her own room and a larger bed very soon.
Sherlock held up his hand and waved it impatiently. “No, no,” he interrupted. “It’s as apt of a description as any. My brain is a giant hard drive. But, unlike a real computer that performs only one function at a time, my mind is like a whirlwind, like twenty different automobiles in a huge circle chained to some part of my body in the middle of it all. They are all pulling me in different directions at the same time, and sometimes I’m terrified that they’ll eventually pull me apart, that I’ll fragment—go utterly mad. That’s why I need the puzzles, The Work. The more of my mind I can focus on one, single, complex task, the more the cars are all pulling in one direction, the more stable and sane I feel.”
She gestured to the copies of her medical records. “Every time, she was sorry. She promised to get help and never do it again. She’d call you and tell you that she needed to go to rehab, and you’d send her to private clinics and get her help, and then she’d get out and start drinking again within a few months. And then she’d hit me. Or she’d get into a pub brawl or something, and then the whole cycle would repeat.”
“He told you this?” Mycroft asked, eyes narrowed as he attempted to get to the crucial events of earlier that evening.
One unsuspected benefit of having Nora around was that she enjoyed cooking. John was grateful for the home cooked meals as take away was both unhealthy and expensive.
“John, I initiated this relationship, set out to seduce you, not because it was at all in your best interests or what you needed but because it was what I needed. I was acting wholly with my own best interests in mind. I needed to keep you, you and Rosie, here with me, so I offered you sex. My motives from the outset were far from altruistic.”
John chewed his lip for a long moment. God, this was insane and becoming even more so by the second. “How experienced are you Sherlock?” he asked softly. When he saw the detective’s brows knit in confusion, obviously searching his memory for some sort of scale to qualify his experience, John clarified. “How many sexual partners have you had?”
Sherlock cocked his head slightly as he considered John’s words. Chemistry made sense to Sherlock in a way that life never would, but there was the very real chance that Sherlock [i.e. Big Brain] would take the analogy a bit too far.
This was fuller…deeper…naughtier, and as he began the rhythmic fucking motions, his body finally relaxed fully and he began to brush against and then lightly rub his prostate gland.
John giggled softly. Poor Sherlock--the big head and the little head couldn’t seem to function simultaneously, let alone do something so simple as coordinate the removal of his pants.
He quickly opened the white box and then the black leatherette case of his new toy, the thing he had paid nearly a week’s salary for, the exorbitant sum of £400: The Real Cock II A.
John started to object again, but before he could his conscience put in an appearance of its own as it metaphorically stuck its tongue out and called him a hypocrite. Hadn’t he just typed up his blog/therapy notes? Hadn’t he just bemoaned the fact that Mary hadn’t been more honest and accepted help that would have been freely and willingly offered? Was he brave enough to follow his own advice? Rosie had a wonderful life here, and if she couldn’t have her mother, wouldn’t having an Aunt Nora, a grandmother (Mrs. Hudson) and another father—let’s face it, that’s really what Sherlock was to her, be fair compensation?
He sent one blunt finger to drag teasingly across his perineum, stimulating his eager prostate from the outside. He continued to caress and massage the area until he could feel his prostate throbbing inside, silently begging for relief.
“Really, John?” Sherlock chuckled softly to himself. Using Rosie’s date of birth as the password for his laptop. “You could at least have made it a little challenging,” Sherlock mused under his breath.
“Perhaps. It will increase the security clearance you currently enjoy, but I cannot promise that it will always get you access to everything.”
John dragged himself out of bed at 11:25 when the alarm blared its obnoxious wake up reveille. He didn’t want to have to rely on Sherlock to wake him up; that seemed childish. When he was eight his parents had given him a Mickey Mouse alarm clock for Christmas. From that point on, he was responsible for getting himself out of bed and ready for school when the alarm rang at 6:30 each morning. Taught that responsibility at a young age, the thought of depending on someone else to wake him and get him, a grown man, ready for work…well, it rankled.
“Okay,” John said indulgently as if that statement was an answer to anything. “Why is 2009 so important?”
It felt surprisingly good…forbidden…erotic….as he began to slowly work that timid finger in deeper and out again, slowly, fucking himself with increasingly confident strokes as he got the hang of this. The angle was bad, and his fingertip a bit short of his goal. If he was going to do this, he would need to insert his slightly longer middle finger as well.
“No, Sherlock. Sexually, what would you want to do to… with me?” John was hyper aware of his sweaty palms and his ragged breathing as he waited for the answer.
It was perhaps the fourth or fifth Friday they had all met at the Red Lion that an offhand, slightly slurred remark by DI Greg Lestrade changed the course of John Watson’s life forever. John had never known Greg to imbibe more than he could handle, but that morning had seen the arrival of Lestrade’s final divorce papers. And, despite the fact that Lestrade’s now ex-wife was a ball busting bitch, at least in John’s humble estimation, the DI was taking the divorce harder than anyone had anticipated. As Greg raised his fifth shot and chased it quickly with half of his second pint, he bitterly remarked something to the effect that if you didn’t meet 100% of your partner’s needs, it was inevitable that she’d leave you eventually. No one, not even Sherlock—at least he denied it vehemently -- remembered precisely what Greg had mumbled that night. But, whatever it was, it set off a chain of events that got Big Brain thinking, which was never, ever, anywhere in the realm of good.
Sherlock’s eyes continued to glitter, and in the dark he looked like a half-wild Fae thing, not of this world. He was both beautiful and maddening.
He continued to watch the lights recede into the distance as they left downtown and headed into one of the residential districts.
John had furiously shucked his tie and yanked off his coat before the door at 221 Baker Street had completely closed. He threw both at the newel post at the base of the stairs before trudging up the steps at a steady clip, each footfall radiating a sort of heart sore anger that Sherlock could not begin to fathom.
More lube, and the second finger pushed in along the first. John hadn’t done this in a while, but it was like riding a bicycle. His body knew what to do, and soon he was working three fingers in, fucking himself a little roughly, a little urgently.
John hit speed dial and called in his order to Speedy’s, a loaded pastrami with oil and vinegar dressing and a bag of salt and vinegar crisps. He was going all out tonight, cholesterol levels be damned. His gourmet sandwich would be paired with a nice pilsner microbrew and an uninterrupted DVD of Casino Royale; he would almost miss Sherlock’s snide remarks and scoffing as the genius derided the physics, the logic—or lack thereof—of the plot, and the inane dialogue. The key word there, of course, was
John had opted for the A or average model, 7” long and a circumference of 4.5.” They made a larger, more popular model, the Real Cock II X, which was 9” long, 6.5” in circumference and 2” in diameter; because of the ‘testicles’ attached at the base, only about 8” was actually insertable…but still. John shuddered visibly at the thought of trying to shove that into his arse.
“The other thing John said to me was that he wished he were more like Mary. That gave me the answer I needed regarding the pieces of the puzzle that didn’t match—why some of the victims had their faces removed, some had burns, some had acid poured down their throats, etc. Our killer is not some random impulsive serial killer who is out of control, but rather an extreme sadist who let his interests select his profession. Our serial killer is a hired assassin. The variations in motive are done either by him to prevent his pattern from becoming clear to the police or done at the request of the individual who took out the contract. He spaces out his kills far enough in time and location and changes enough of the torture details that the investigating officers never saw the pattern that linked an African-American female accountant in Sheffield with a retired male Anglo country doctor in Cardiff.”
“Yeah, I wondered why Harry, an alcoholic for more than twenty years, would be so affected as to pass out with a blood alcohol content of .19%. That’s enough to put me down, but not someone like Harry who’s built up a tolerance over decades of hard use. Add in the heroin, Jesus, that would cause heart palpitations, paranoia, … and, of course, the sudden loss of consciousness now makes sense.”
“Why didn’t any of this turn up before? I had Lestrade pull your medical records before I ever approached Harry about getting her legal counsel and trying to work out a plea deal for aggravated assault and rehabilitation,” Sherlock demanded.
John came awake and blearily tried to focus on the glowing numbers of the alarm clock, attempting to force them into some semblance of clarity. His phone chimed again, and he groped for it clumsily, trying to answer before it woke Sherlock.
“So,” Sherlock said, every line of his body radiating a tightly coiled tension, “what, if anything, do you plan to do?”
Sherlock huffed in frustration. “No physician should ever be a party to such collusion,” he ground out. “If law enforcement cannot rely on accurate medical records…”
Sherlock looked adorably confused. “No, I was attempting to understand our society’s complete fascination with sex and tried to randomly sample as broad of a base as I could for comparison purposes. Sex is the motive for approximately 31% of all murders, over 80% of all blackmail scams and a significant portion of other assorted crimes.”
At first John thought the dog might be a problem, but he discovered it really just wanted to spend most of its time snoozing on the couch or in its bed by the fire. It firmly cemented itself in their lives when it replaced the skull as Sherlock’s erstwhile John replacement. Sherlock would deposit it in John’s chair and run deductions by it. Peppy yawned occasionally. Sherlock pronounced it an excellent stand-in for John. John was never sure if he should be amused or offended by that.
“Come here,” he whispered on a soft murmur as he scooted toward the center of the bed, giving Sherlock a spot to sit next to him.
“Take off your clothes,” John commanded as he continued to rock himself on the dildo, the soft, wet sucking sounds adding to the heated urgency.
John yawned and seemed to come to some realization. “Sherlock, why was Lestrade there? It seems like too much of a coincidence for the one DI we know well at NSY to get this case.”
John looked confused for a moment but settled gently into his chair and began to sift quickly through the documents.
“So, why didn’t you stick with sex? I mean, God, Sherlock, why would someone as intelligent as you risk an overdose, addiction, disease….?” John broke off at a complete loss.
“Accurate,” Mycroft interjected smoothly. “Have you never stopped to ask yourself the simple question ‘why’?” Mycroft asked sharply before resuming. “Why is it that in the two years you were residing with Sherlock you were never able to secure a solid, long term relationship with a woman? Why it was only after his alleged death that you were able to form a relationship with Ms. Morstan, despite the fact that you dated many talented, intelligent and amazing women? Could it be that so long as Sherlock was alive that you had nothing left emotionally to give them, that they were nothing more than…how shall I say this?...friends with benefits? And despite what they may have wanted, they could never be more to you, because you were and are completely and irrevocably in love with Sherlock,” Mycroft concluded with a slight tilt of his head, like a magician awaiting applause. Ta da!
John rolled his eyes at him, but replied quietly, "Ask me again when you are feeling better, hmm? Now, I think -" He stopped as he saw a light flash in Sherlock's eyes, then vanish. He cleared his voice then tried again. "I think I can manage helping you to your room, maybe tomorrow, I can return the favor, must drive you round the bend not to be able to wash your hair, been a couple days, hasn't it?"
Sherlock slipped out of the Belstaff and carefully eased himself into the space John had made for him on the hospital bed, and let out a long sigh of relief as John rested against his chest. "Don't scare me like that again, please?"
If he weren't so busy just trying to keep up, he might have paused for just a moment to watch Sherlock become more or less airborne as he dashed across the rooftops. As it was, when Sherlock finally came to a stop, without a curl out of place, and breathing easily, it was all he could do not to fall over.
John saw a mix of emotions on her face, and wondered at the history between her and Sherlock. From her stance, it probably wasn't good. "He's - I was going to say resting, but -"
"Yes. I am, in fact, human," Sherlock muttered as he placed his fork down on the plate and picked up his glass of wine and took a sip. "I don't - as a rule - not really a rule, I don't usually have company, for reasons that must be obvious to you, so I don't normally drink, however." He closed his eyes and sighed. "This is one of her best bottles. As I recall, she was saving it for an
John blinked at him, then sat up and looked down at his hands, as his breathing returned to something close to normal. "That day - during the day, I keep replaying it in my head, the things I should have done differently, at night, it's just sand - nothing but sand and noise. It's -"
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he pulled off his fake beard and moustache and threw them on the desk. “Need to keep up a presence, since we haven’t had a case in a while, and with you being a bit under the weather, I thought it a good time to take a walk, see if I can still blend in.”
People were easy to read, at least people in the general sense of the word, Sherlock mused as he considered the man next to him, still fast asleep.
John nodded, then helped him from the bed, and settling his arm around his waist, they slowly made their way through the connecting door. He turned away and closed the door, and minutes later, as he once again found himself considering what he was doing there, Sherlock was leaning against the door frame, watching him curiously. "Mrs Hudson."
John nodded, and got out of the cab, then walked over to the door, and nearly jumped as the door was opened even before he reached for the antique bell pull. The man who stood before him may have been fifty or seventy, it was impossible to tell. “Dr Watson, I presume? Please come in.”
John grinned at her, then remembered Sherlock's comment on the wine. "Oh, and the wine was appreciated."
Sherlock had considered stopping by the restaurant before heading home to Baker Street, but it was far too early in the day, and he had promised Donovan that he would go home. What was that all about, he wondered with a snort as he climbed the seventeen steps to his flat. Making a promise to her, to anyone - he hadn't done that since - hell. A shower and maybe some crap telly - he got to the top of the stairs and groaned as the door was slightly open and Mrs Hudson was sitting in his chair chatting away to DI Watson who looked perfectly at home in the overstuffed chair that usually held his recently laundered clothing. He rolled his eyes and pushed the door open.
John watched as Sherlock settled into his seat, and Sholto carefully maneuvered himself onto the straight-backed chair that they used for clients, then he turned towards the kitchen to find Mrs Hudson studying him. Already she knew him too well. She knew he wanted to bolt, but she didn’t say a word, but simply finished making the tea, and with a nod, silently left the flat, closing the door behind her.
“Ears. They both wear their hair so they are usually covered, but one of them, Helen, I think, has that nervous habit of playing with her hair. I also saw a brief look of recognition in John’s eyes, he recovered quickly enough, they had never met him, so it didn’t much acting on their parts -”
For reasons she now understood, he had made her his medical proxy at some point when they were at Cambridge together, and the issue hadn't come up until his return from Serbia. At the time, she had been frustrated, almost angry that he had put her in that position especially when the doctors couldn't give her any straight answers for nearly two months. But it had meant that she could be by his side, and Mycroft for once, had no say in determining his brother's future. There had been times during his recovery when she wondered if she had made the right decisions, but the day he had finally taken his first step on his own and grinned up at her, she knew why he had chosen her. He knew she wouldn't give up on him.
Watson blinked at him for a moment, then nodded. "I am partial to the Thai place around the corner."
"I think you'll find, though it's hard to believe at the moment, that I am usually quite indestructible."
"Just needs time to heal, but I think if you have any cold cases stashed anywhere, that would help him the most."
With a sigh, John knelt down and began picking up the pieces of broken mug from the floor, then answered, "That first day I walked into the shop, you saved my life that day."
Greg shrugged and pulled a pint, then set it down on the bar. "You don't end up here without a reason."
"Why you choose not to sleep as often as you should?" Sherlock suggested gently, then laid his good hand over John's and waited for him to look up.
He left Baker Street and started walking with no direction in mind until he lost track of time and ended up at Greg's restaurant. Greg was drying glasses when he walked in and he squinted up at the clock. "Shit. I didn't realise the time."
Donovan nodded and watched as Dee left the room closing the door behind her. "Hell." She glared up at the ceiling, then at Sherlock. "Sit, then."
"Obvious." John rolled his eyes, and the smirk gradually became the smile that was for him and him alone. "Dinner, John?"
Dee got to her feet then leaned down and kissed his forehead. "Chocolate. And terrible romance novels. Now, go home. I'll see you tomorrow."
"She asked for you," He said to Dee as he gracelessly dropped back onto the world's most uncomfortable chair.
An awkward silence settled between them before John walked over and picked up a single weathered snap from the mantelpiece. It was of better days, at Uni, of the three of them, their first year, when everything seemed possible. “He wants you to remember him as he was, John.”
John took a deep breath and unclenched his hands before sitting back down. “Sorry,” he murmured softly. “Not sure why I did that.”
“I don’t think I can have intercourse yet. I’ll need to work up to that, but I am familiar with the basic equipment,” John said as he gestured to his own groin area, which was seemingly beginning to take an interest in recent developments. That more than anything convinced Sherlock that John was serious. “I think I can manage a hand job, maybe a bit of frottage,” John said, a little uncertain. Would this be enough? “You need to understand, though. I still haven’t worked through all of my anger issues, Sherlock. Please, you have to promise me that you won’t let me hurt you.”
John sighed. “In Lestrade’s defense, she did actively try to conceal it—even went so far as to use her friend’s medical card. And, I know of several doctors who are known to treat victims of domestic violence off the record. They’re terrified that their abusers will kill them if there’s a record of the abuse, so they use fake identities, lie about the injuries….”
“Don’t come. I know this is rubbing the head of your cock, but don’t you dare come!” John moaned loudly.
Sherlock allowed John his need to restore a semblance of order but felt strangely bereft without John’s warm weight in his arms.
“I can only imagine he wants something. My guess is Scotland Yard will need the additional resources available to me to apprehend the killer.”
Chapter End Notes: The violent physical assault John recalls in this chapter is based on an actual case that occurred in the US. If you want to look it up, google Abner Louima. In 1997 three New York City police officers handcuffed Mr. Louima, beat him, and sodomized him with a broken broomstick handle. Mr. Louima survived his ordeal and sued the city of New York and the police officer’s union. The case settled out of court for $8.7 million, although Mr. Louima has to live the rest of his life with the debilitating physical and psychological after effects of the trauma.
In honor of my birthday on Sunday, my gift to you is the final 2 chapters of this story.  My thanks to those of you who stuck with me through this journey, watching John and Sherlock grow and become men who could succeed in a committed relationship.  I hope you find the conclusion most satisfactory.
“You asked me to, remember? We clearly needed to do more for Clara than the counseling and medical care she is currently receiving. I have secured Mycroft’s assistance in getting a service animal for Clara. It will allow her to reclaim some of her independence, and he is going to make sure Anthea finds her some sort of flat share situation so she can remain in London and live, at least, semi-autonomously. He has also found himself in need of a part time secretary, which will become a full time secretarial position as soon as Clara is medically able to work the additional hours. I have no doubts she can pass the background checks. She seems the loyal sort.”
“I’m not angry, Sherlock,” John admitted softly. “I’m … I’m jealous,” he said at last. Sherlock’s face screwed up in adorable confusion.
“C’mere,” John offered as he sat up and lifted a corner of the afghan. Sherlock wasted no time in settling himself against John’s warmth and tucking the afghan around himself. John shivered.
“When you moved back in here, you said that we would raise Rosie together. Did you mean that or not?” Sherlock interrupted his voice clipped and tight.
Sherlock removed his hand and placed it over John’s, waiting silently as John began working the dildo out, learning the correct motions by feel. John jerked his head toward the nightstand.
He wasn’t quite certain when or how Anthea was getting back to England. Privately, he was amazed that Mycroft had managed to do without her for this long; John had secret suspicions that she was a lot more than Mycroft’s personal assistant and Gal Friday. Hell, Mycroft had probably already ordered *The English Electric Lightning back into service to fly her absolutely lethal but cute little arse back to London post haste.
Since being shot, he no longer had the dexterity in his shoulder to tolerate a prolonged fingering of his prostate. The few times he’d tried, it had begun to ache horribly, which was why he had begun using the toys; twisting around behind his body was even worse. He couldn’t even use a toy on himself when he was on his knees—that was a pleasure he could have only with a partner now. Some days he wished he were more ambidextrous, at least with regard to fine motor skills.
“Why didn’t I see it before?” Sherlock demanded grabbing his phone. “Lestrade, I need access to the NSY criminal database. [Pause] What? Yes, all of it. I think I may have solved the serial killer case, but I need more data. [Pause] Well, then get me clearance!” Sherlock shouted petulantly before hanging up. The game was on.
John hesitated then patted the spot on the bed next to him. Sherlock sat, still staring at John as if he had grown a second head.
Chapter End Notes: Euchre is a card game for four players, two partners per team, who attempt to either make their point, if they have named trumps for that hand, or to set the other team if that team has named trumps. It is popular in portions of the US, most of Canada, New Zealand, and Great Britain. It is generally fast paced and can be extremely cut throat. A Farmer’s Hand is commonly referred to as ‘no ace no face’ and is almost always grounds for a re-deal.
“I know, but I didn’t want you to know. I didn’t want anyone to know. I was so ashamed. How was I supposed to admit that I let my female partner, who weighs two stone less than I do, beat me up?” She began crying in earnest then, fat drops rolling down her cheeks, and she wiped, viciously, smearing her mascara. “When you visited me in hospital to tell me about Harry’s surgery, you blamed yourself for not going more ‘tough love’ on Harry. And I could see by the way you behaved today that you’re still blaming yourself for her choices. You thought her behavior was your fault. And your partner thinks that this mess is his fault. It’s not.”
“You know, don’t you?” John asked, “Or at least you think you do. You said before, “I do know.” Bloody Holmes’ and your deductions. Go ahead then,” John said bitterly, “Enlighten me. Why does Sherlock make me completely lose my mind?”
“It’s not the same thing, Sherlock. You’ve relapsed a few times since I’ve known you, but you try. You really try to stay clean, especially these last months.”
Now, she just needed to select her agent for the evening… Sherlock, no he was certainly not gullible enough. Perhaps that nice Molly Hooper. Yes, she would do nicely.
John gazed at his comatose older sister in a mixture of horror and pity. She was hooked up to every machine known to western medicine, except a ventilator. At least there was some small consolation that she was breathing on her own. John counted no less than eight bags of blood, antibiotics, and fluid support. A small pump at the side beeped every few minutes as it pushed in the benzodiazepines that kept Harry’s addicted body from going into DTs.
He looked forlornly at the cooler containing the bottled water on ice. Sighing, John scrubbed his hands over his face tiredly. He didn’t want to, but he needed to have the rest of this conversation face to face.
“I’m serious about this, Sherlock. You’re bigger than anything I’ve ever taken. You can really hurt me if you don’t do what I tell you to do. Understand?” John demanded firmly.
Long, manicured fingers raked their nails delicately over the quivering flesh of John’s thighs. His legs spread wide of their own volition, the need to be filled, to be fucked becoming increasingly urgent. John blindly sent one questing hand toward the nightstand where it mercifully located the warm heating pad. A quick fumble, and he was squirting heated lube across his fingers.
It was too much to hope for that John would find another Mary Morstan, or whatever her real name had been. Lightning generally does not strike the same place twice; while not impossible, it was highly improbable that John would ever find another intelligent, thoughtful, daring mate who would actively encourage John’s dangerous pursuits with Sherlock. No, the more likely scenario was that John would settle for a woman who would subtly or not so subtly push Sherlock out of John’s life a little at a time until John was firmly ensconced at home, a dried up husk of a man yearning for excitement and adventure. Therefore, it was up to Sherlock to save John from himself. Why, it was practically Sherlock’s duty to do so, he reasoned, as John’s best friend…best man even.
Apparently Clara had had the good sense to use the belt from her dressing gown and a spatula to create a tourniquet, which had unquestionably saved Harry’s life, but the amount of time it had taken for the ambulance to arrive and for Harry to receive appropriate medical attention had deprived the limb of necessary blood flow for long enough that it was 50/50 as to whether the hand would have to be amputated.
4) I also discovered during my research that the majority of men, who blog about/discuss prostate orgasms, indicate that while there is a fair amount of leakage during the stimulation of the prostate itself, the orgasm itself is usually dry. The majority also report that unless there is actual penile or nipple stimulation, they do not achieve more than a partial erection. There is some variation here as a fairly large minority report that they get rock hard and ejaculate copiously until their testicles are empty. The general consensus among all of them is that a prostate orgasm is far more intense and is of a much longer duration than a penile orgasm. A high number also reported that multiple orgasms were possible as well.
As the assistant medical director in charge of supplies at one of the three London clinics that catered to veterans, no one would question the delivery. On most days, John loved his new job. He had only been here four months, but he was already settled in. He admired his colleagues and their support staff, respected his patients, and had built a solid rapport with both. He was doing important and fulfilling work. His position allowed him to both see patients as well as oversee general patient care. He had ostensibly gotten the job on his own, but he still had niggling suspicions that Mycroft had had a hand in getting John this job, one that provided him with a higher income and very flexible working hours. Both were important to insure he could meet the needs of his daughter, Rosie, who he was raising alone since Mary’s death, and Sherlock, who, on any given day, John was also, ostensibly, raising single-handedly.
Sherlock paused in the act of bringing his own mug to his lips and set the heavy, ceramic mug on the coffee table.
John shivered again and belatedly realized it was a cold draft and not arousal. He had closed the heavy curtains; there shouldn’t be a draft unless the door had opened…but John had shut the door before bed. Sighing loudly he continued to work the Real Cock into his eager, clenching body, but the draft was just sufficient enough of a distraction to put a damper on things—no pun intended. He needed to buy a lock tomorrow.
"At least the chocolates will be easy, I'll just go to that place -" he stopped speaking and bit his lip.
“I know, me too,” John said quietly. “Some days it still catches me by surprise. I am, I was used to being alone, and now -”
"221 B Baker St. This is where my brother chooses to reside, just knock, his landlady, Mrs Hudson will answer, there are steps, I do apologise, though it appears you no longer use your stick."
John stood and helped him to stand, then wrapped his arm around his waist and together made their way to Sherlock's room. John settled the blankets carefully around him, then sat on the edge on the bed and looked into his eyes before he cleared his throat. "I haven't slept with anyone, in any way, shape or form since Afghanistan, partly because of the nightmares, but also -" He began to unbutton his shirt, but Sherlock stopped him with a look and he nodded at him, then closed his eyes tightly until he heard Sherlock ask quietly, "May I?"
"I don't know anything," Sherlock replied in a resigned voice that he'd never heard before, not even in the darkest days of their friendship.
"No, I know. But you were the one constant in my life that I could count on. It's a rare thing these days. So I am at your disposal, for as long as you want me to be here."
Charley cleared his throat and started to explain, “Look, it wasn’t a prank, they needed help, and have the means and I knew you were having a bit of a dry spell, ever since -”
"Yes, I know what I said, he had changed, but his brother was his only family, and they were twins, they had been inseparable -"
"Six hours in a waiting room chair at Barts, then three hours on my couch, three more in bed last night. Something is wrong with me."
." He put the glass down, then picked up his fork again, and glanced over at John. "I suppose it is. I've found the one person who can tolerate my presence, and -" he blinked at him then, and turned his focus to finishing his dinner. "Convince me that sleeping and eating aren't such intolerable activities without so much as a stern look or sharp word. Clever indeed."
He nodded and without another word, a black sedan appeared, and a young woman stepped out and opened the door for him. He had no idea why he settled into the seat at that moment, but in the back of his mind, he knew his life was about to become interesting again for the first time in years.
The warm, sleepy voice drew him safely away from the spectral images that visited on those nights when the past came to visit. He let out a relieved sigh and settled once more into Sherlock's gentle embrace.
Sherlock nodded, replaced the violin into its case and crossed the room, then settled on the couch, his head in John’s lap, legs outstretched, fingers pressed together, eyes closed. The puzzle was set aside, and Sherlock smiled, then opened his eyes. They had now known each other for all of three months and two days, and there were moments like this one, when John couldn’t understand how he had managed to breathe before the day they had met.
"I promise," he said quietly and watched as she closed her eyes. He placed her hand back on the bed and silently left the room.
John rolled his eyes and opened the door to Mrs. Hudson and a tray full of scones and a fresh pot of tea.
Sherlock's eyes twinkled at him and for the first time John saw his lips curve up into an honest smile. "Seriously. Can you make a note of it?"
"You asked for my help. For two years, once a week, you made my life bearable. You listened when I chose to speak, and let me be when I preferred silence. You are the first person to treat me with kindness."
"Tell me a story, John?" John kissed his shoulder, and told him the story that his mother would tell him on nights when he couldn't sleep, of a prince who spent most of his life searching in vain for his one true love.
"No. She was caught by one of Lestrade's, by Donovan," he grumbled under his breath. "I'll never hear the end of it - I was lucky she was there, though. Look. I - I was going to tell you, I just. I became accustomed to, I looked forward to our time every week. You didn't seem to mind, and I, hell -"
"What the -?" He stopped short as he realised the door to the barber shop was locked, shades drawn, to all the world appearing to be closed.
Another near miss, a moment when everything went silent as the bullet whizzed by, half an inch to the left and - no. He wouldn't think about that for now, not when John was safely in his arms, nearly asleep.
He made his way down the stairs, missing the creaky step that he had encountered in previous visits, and was nearly to the door when Mrs Hudson opened her door, and smiled gently at him. "You play beautifully, DI Watson. Thank you for seeing to him. He isn't the easiest person on a good day, and I know it wasn't a good day."
“Right.” He cleared his throat, then let his eyes flicker over Sherlock’s face for a brief moment. Nothing. He could read nothing from the angular features he knew - had known so well for the last six months.
"Positive. Stay for another cuppa." Sherlock bit his lip and wondered what it was about the man opposite that made him want to drop his defenses.
John studied his face for a moment, then saw the tension in his hand that was tightly wrapped around the umbrella that he used for support. Stress. He's under stress, and he normally doesn't show - no, he can't show emotion.
He had those days that were simply too heavy, when memories visited too sharply, and the only saving grace was the strong arms and legs that reminded him that he was home.
"Sorry, I wondered why you let me off so easy the other day, and I did a bit of research, none of my business -" he turned towards John and went on, "You were lucky, she wasn't, sometimes life is like that. I was in a relationship. Once. He left." He shrugged again, then returned his gaze to the fire, as if nothing more needed to be said.
When he opened his eyes again there was a fire in the fireplace and a plate of scones and a pot of tea in front of him. "Sorry."
"I know, I always said I didn't want it - didn't need it, but I do. I want everyone to know how important you are - how important you've always been to me, and I want -"
"How you are with Mrs Hudson, you loved your grandmother, respected her, learned from her - sorry. I'll stop."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Mrs Hudson, but she gave him a wink as she handed him a mug and a plate of biscuits, then went back to the kitchen to retrieve the teapot. He realised then that John was drinking from her best tea service, and he nearly fell out of his chair. He couldn't remember the last time she had used it. A Royal wedding, possibly? Whatever the occasion, it seemed this evening had deserved her very best, so he relented and cleared his throat. "I was going to order some take-away, I don't usually order it just for myself - if you have nothing else on - thing is, I'd rather not be on my own for an hour or two."
Mycroft looked up from his book to find Greg standing in the doorway. He took his time replacing his bookmark, then set the book aside and waited.
“It’s fine, James,” John said quietly as he carried his tea over to his chair and sat down. “I have days like that too.”
"Yes. I'm not sure I want to know how you know -" For the first time John looked up, and studied the barbershop properly. There were cameras on the corners of the building - not old, maybe two years old. As he watched, they swiveled and seemed to focus on him.
"Yeah, I think I could do that," John replied, and smiled as he saw the relief in Sherlock's eyes. "Give me a minute, 'kay?"
"Yes, you," Sherlock answered with a impish look on his face. "You took a chance on me, you didn't have to, not really, but you did, a year ago now, and if you don't mind, I'd like to, well, I'd like to return the favor."
Sherlock looked up from his industrious scrubbing of the fridge, and John stopped his slow two fingered typing at footsteps entering the flat.
"And he plays the violin. Played me to sleep. Left me a note and left me to it. Sent me a text this morning."
DI Watson glanced up and moved to get to his feet. Sherlock shook his head and watched in resignation as Mrs Hudson popped up from her perch on his chair and headed for the kitchen. He closed his eyes and breathed in the air of his flat. She had baked ginger nuts. She always baked them when she knew he wasn't in the mood to eat anything. She knew the scent of them worked miracles. For him, at any rate.
"So -" Lestrade muttered under his breath as he shot a sidelong glance at John, and let out a low whistle, then went silent as Sherlock looked up at him.
“Enough,” Sherlock murmured then opened the door and walked into a room that was as devoid of character as his brother’s had been all too telling.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shifted carefully, then leaned in close and kissed him in a way that no further words were necessary.
John rolled his eyes and turned to face him, then let a sigh escape as he felt Sherlock's nimble fingers begin to work on the buttons of the purple shirt.
"Basically, he had a lovely evening, and he didn't want to wake me up -" She raised an eyebrow at him and he huffed, but took his wallet from his jacket pocket and pulled out a raggedy piece of paper that had been neatly folded. He unfolded it and read it aloud.
For all that he had learned about him over the months, John was still a mystery, not for who and what he was, but what it was about him that calmed the storm of thoughts that usually occupied his mind. Since the day they met, he had come to depend on his companionship, his steadiness and the stillness that lead to tranquil moments like this one. He studied the cryptic smile of his partner in all things, and as he kissed him, he was reminded that some mysteries were meant to remain mysteries.
"Apparently," Sherlock shrugged. "Dee was just as surprised as you are, I'm thinking there is a story there?"
As Mrs Hudson opened the door to them, she could tell they were in no mood for her gregarious landlady bit. “I’ll bring up a nice tea in a bit.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and Sholto shrugged, but then refocused. “Right. Apologies. It’s still difficult to believe -”
As Sherlock walked around the spacious room, filled with the latest scientific equipment, as well as the ancient tomes that had a home on his own shelves at Baker Street, John knew he and Tad would have been kindred spirits had they met in life. He watched as Sherlock settled onto a stool and switched on the microscope in front of him.
“I black out sometimes, and I find myself in places -” he shrugged, then sighed as he stood up from his chair and walked over to the window. He cleared his throat and straightened up, then continued. “Three days ago, I woke up in my brother’s room, and had a dreadful headache, concussion, and I searched the house for him, but couldn’t find him. Eventually I just went to bed and a day later--”
"Older, at least," Greg muttered with a sheepish grin then groaned as he tried to get up from the floor. Mycroft shook his head then got up from his chair, and gently helped him to his feet.
"I'm hungry," John muttered, then nearly swore at his bad sense of timing, as Sherlock's hand dropped away as if he had been stung and he turned towards the doorway. "Take away. Must be something you like. Stop. Please?"
"He is a bit lonely, I think, Dr Watson. Though he usually finds the company of others intrusive, from all appearances, he seems to find your presence less irritating than usual." John felt his face heat up, but after she handed him two servings of sticky toffee pudding, she went on, "I'm glad he has at least one friend, Dr Watson, I have found that life is hard enough without doing it all on one's own. I made that because if nothing else, he will always eat his pudding. Now scoot before he starts throwing things again."
Sherlock smiled at him and tried to stifle a yawn. "Sorry, I don't usually drink. But today - today was a good day. Haven't had many of those lately. So, thank you, for today." He finished his glass of wine, placed it on the table and moved to stand.
"Yeah." He poured himself another glass of wine and drank half of it before setting it down carefully again.
"Sherlock, just take it, it doesn't help if you try to pretend you're not in pain. I can see it in your face, hear it in your breathing. I know it doesn't help all that much, but it will take the edge off."
"No, he's not the most clever man in London, that would be my brother, but he knows people, and he's known me longer than anyone else, other than my family, so it's a fair assessment." He carefully made his way to the couch and propped his ankle on the pillow, steepled his fingers together and closed his eyes. John shook his head, then walked into the kitchen and plugged in the kettle for tea, and realized he wasn't exhausted for the first time in months.
"No, I - uhm. I know - I mean - I want to, hell, this hurts. Here it is. I trust you, and you, until today, seemed to well, like me, you kept showing up -"
"Before, she was set in her ways, everything had its place, life was - I knew what to expect, and now -" Sherlock watched as her mouth worked itself into a smile, then she grabbed his face and kissed his forehead. "She asked me to marry her." Sherlock couldn't help but smile as she let go of his face and quickly strode off in the direction of Donovan's room.
Molly sighed as she flipped on the light in her office to find Sherlock at her computer. At least he wasn't on one of her tables this time.
It was the sound of the wind he remembered more than anything, even more than what had been done to him. Yes, of course, there were the scars left behind to remind him if he tried to forget, but it was the whistle of the wind and then the moments of silence that he dreamed of on the rare occasions when he closed his eyes and allowed himself to sleep.
“He died last month, we had been living in our father’s home - he left it to Tad, thought I wouldn’t need or want that monstrosity, and he was correct of course, but when I was invalided out, Tad invited me to live with him - we had our own rooms, and we rarely saw each other except at breakfast -”
His eyes were gleaming, and John knew it would be just another moment - yes, there was the slight smirk, and the solution to the case tumbled from his lips, the same lips he could barely keep his eyes from.
John pulled up to the door of the home of his friend, and realised how little he had known about him.
Sherlock studied him carefully for a long moment, and finally nodded at him. "I'm a bit too used to being on my own, like you." He sighed as John grinned at him, and said, "Yes, there is Mrs Hudson, but sometimes she can't hear me over her stories and music - not classical, or her constant hoovering. And there is more to being alone than being on one's own. In a room full of people is when I feel most alone." John got to his feet and helped him to stand, though they were a bit unsteady, eventually made it to his room. "As I said, a good day, John. See you in the morning." Sherlock said in way of dismissal as he limped into his room and closed the door.
“He wouldn’t want me to know,” John replied quietly. “He destroyed whatever it was that he and his brother couldn’t escape from, and left me the one thing he had kept that reminded him he had once been happy. I don’t think he would want us to investigate further. I think he was hoping - I don’t know - I think he wanted to see me one more time - he knew I was settled, and happy. Two things he was never able to achieve for long.” He pulled his wallet from his pocket, placed the photo inside and replaced it in his pocket. “Let’s go home.”
“Mrs Hudson?” John opened the door of the flat and invited her in. Usually she had no qualms about entering their rooms without regard for their privacy, but this morning, she seemed nervous about something, and he helped her to a chair.
"You obviously needed it, so did I. She's out of surgery, and awake, at the moment. Wants to see you."
He let out an impatient sigh. "You were in the medical corps. I can tell by your dog tags, the patch on your jacket. You are essential, and yet you are home, invalided. Horrible word, I think, to invalidate one seems rather harsh. Please, have a seat."
"Well, something's got to be bloody wrong with you if you've willingly shackled yourself to a freak like him." Anderson said, his face pulled in a sneer.
It had been two weeks since Sherlock had received a letter, a call, or a notification of any kind from John.
"Oh thank god." At that, Sherlock nearly ran the few feet of distance that separated them until he could wrap John in his arms.
"Yeah," Sally clicked her tongue, "this area's closed off though, innit? Authorized personnel only."
"Hm?" Sherlock took a moment before seemingly remembering why he was there in the first place, "oh, no not quite, would you like to help?"
"After, you know we tend to work up an appetite after a search," Sherlock said, a fondness in his voice Lestrade had never heard before, as they began to walk towards the doorway.
He stared at his phone on the end table, cursing its silence. He could always call Mycroft himself, but even in the near delirium his worry had sent his mind into, he knew that if Mycroft thought he needn't worry he would've received word.
"Sherlock," Lestrade started, hesitant to interrupt Sherlock's process, "Anderson says there's a military officer here to see you."
"I'm just glad you're home safe now, John," Mycroft patted John's hand with his free one, "I'd much rather you two get into trouble here, together, than thousands of miles apart, much easier to keep an eye on."
"What are you two?" John asked, his tone almost amused, "a pair of middle school bullies? 'Freak' really? How positively juvenile. I was under the impression the Scotland Yard was exclusively hiring grown adults, I suggest you start acting like it. Also, I'd appreciate you lot not insult my husband to my face, or at all really, if you don't mind.
"My brilliant detective, I got tired of waiting for you to deduce if I'm dead or not, sorry to intrude."
"I'm sure," John smirked before turning back to Lestrade, "you're Inspector Lestrade, I presume, I must thank you for allowing Sherlock to assist you on cases, it's good for him really, especially since I've been away."
"No, no, I know you'd have my head if I let that happen and we can't have that now," he sent John a fond, apologetic smile, "I don't envy you, he's a lot to keep up with."
It wasn't the first time word from John had been infrequent, he was used to going a week without word, maybe even a week and a half. But whenever it went beyond that, Sherlock had always received word from Mycroft that all was well and that he need not fret.
"Well, lucky for me then," John dug into his pocket for a moment, producing a badge with a Developed Vetting clearance level that he honestly had no business having, a gift from Mycroft of course, "I believe this makes me authorized, doesn't it?"
"So, instead you let him worry himself sick," John frowned, "god, he's probably taken up smoking again."
"Will his meddling never cease?" Sherlock asked as they passed through the doorway, never sparing any of the room's occupants so much as a glance.
So there he stayed, crouched beside the body of a woman, deaf to everything beside his own reeling mind. Which is why he did not hear the sounds of uneven footsteps, accompanied by the intermittent click of a cane and the frustrated protests of Sally Donovan.
He had been wrong before. Living with the unknown was so much easier than it would be to live a life knowing John would never return to him.
Sherlock scoffed at that, releasing John and pulling the left lapel of his coat aside to rummage in an inside pocket, "really, Lestrade, I'd think even you lot could figure this one out," he said, his tone relaying exactly how much of his attention he felt the conversation deserved, which was minimal at best, before finding what he was looking for.
Lestrade thought momentarily about calling their bluff, not sure how anyone could glean so much information off so little, but thought better of it, "Why Cardiff?" He asked instead.
"I'm sorry, are we just skimming over the fact that the freak has a husband?" Sally cut in suddenly.
"Pleasure," Lestrade smiled, still in a slight state of shock, mostly at how completely normal the man before him seemed to be.
"Right then," Sally said, her eyebrows drawn as she put her talkie to her mouth, "Anderson, tell the freak there's a military bloke here to see him." Sally turned back to him, "are you actually here to take him off to some high security loony bin?" Her voice too eager for John's liking, "it's 'bout bloody time."
“Correction,” Sherlock’s snide tones cut through the tense air. “Do we have any real honey that does not come in a small, plastic bear with a ridiculous painted grin on its face?”
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, more alcohol would increase the effects of inebriation only on a linear scale. The addition of the heroin would multiply the effects of the euphoria exponentially. More bang for the buck,” he said, lips popping the ‘b’ and the ‘k’ sounds to emphasize the point.
“What the fuck does this have to do with me and Sherlock?” John asked belligerently. He was no longer cold, but he ached from the prolonged chill. He was tired, sleep deprived, and heart sore in addition to having been on an emotional roller coaster earlier that evening. The euphoria of telling someone you loved them for the first time had turned into a raw, aching, open wound, and Mycroft’s attempt to fill the quiet with scientific ramblings was too much of a reminder of Sherlock just then.
John had already begun to shake his head when she interjected, “Yes, it is my fault. Listen to me,” she demanded, enunciating each word very clearly, as she reached over to grasp John’s forearm tightly. “I went to see her before they discharged me.”
He noted vaguely that, at some point during the conversation, Sherlock too had gotten up and begun to dress.
“Mmmmm…yes,” John moaned softly into the gentle, sucking kisses, realizing immediately that while Sherlock had used the same words, the nuances were different, creating an entirely different question. It dawned on him vaguely as Sherlock sent questing fingers under his jumper that it had been close to a week since Big Brain and The Hard Drive had had their necessary re-boots. While John had been incredibly stressed this past week with funeral arrangements and such, physical intimacy between the two of them had been mostly non-existent. He was almost surprised, in a way, to realize that he needed this as much as Sherlock did, maybe more.
But Sherlock was already peeling the gray t-shirt over his head, leaving him clad in nothing but a faded pair of plaid flannel pajama pants slung low on his hips. John’s jaw dropped as he was presented with miles of pearlescent alabaster skin crowned by two dusky pink nipples the color of warm strawberry cotton candy, tight and firm in the chill morning air. Sherlock was speaking; John was certain of it, yet he couldn’t make out a single word for the sound of the blood rushing into his ears.
“Oh,” John said softly, chagrined, before turning and leaving the other man’s office to the quiet chuckles of the elder Holmes brother.
“Sex,” Sherlock repeated calmly. “The basement of the Diogenes Club houses a brothel, one that caters to pretty much any sexual fetish or proclivity you can imagine.”
Mycroft ignored him and continued as if John had not spoken. “One of the first things the professors teach you is to state your assumptions and define your terms.”
John immediately began to fill Sherlock in as he fumbled through his wallet, rooting around for his medical ID badge that would get him onto the surgical ward since visiting hours were long over, and he didn’t particularly feel like answering a lot of stupid questions as an emergency contact.
“Well, that clinches it. My daughter just said her first word, and it’s not 'dada' or 'papa'; it’s Sherlock. Story of my life,” John muttered, but the rueful grin on his face belied any upset he may have projected.
"Box of files for Holmes. DI asked me to bring them, ordered me to. I'm Donovan." He opened the door and after he walked through the doorway, pulled it closed again. "How's he doing?"
James laughed, but it was wild and without humour as he ran his fingers through his hair and mumbled, “that’s about the sum of it.” John started, and quickly came to the inevitable conclusion that his friend and former commander was quite certainly mad.
"Not too often these days, it's been a while since DI Lestrade has let him on a crime scene -" She narrowed her eyes at him and nodded. "You know -"
Mrs Hudson nodded. John walked into the kitchen, put on the kettle, then returned and sat in his chair. “Things might have been different if not for 9/11. He was brilliant, a historian, was going to spend his life in the ivory tower teaching - but that day changed him, his parents were in New York that day, an anniversary present, twenty-fifth. They never came home, he had to identify them by their belongings that were found in their hotel room. He left Cambridge - I didn’t see him again until I got to Afghanistan. He had a bad war. He was a good officer, but - war changes people, and he was already broken when he went. Mrs H - you know I’m with Sherlock. I love him and I would never do anything to hurt him.”
“That’s good, Doc. I’m glad you were able to find someone, you deserve to be happy.” They stood in silence at the window for a moment until Sherlock broke the silence.
"Oh. Dr Watson. I could've -" Mrs Hudson stared at the two empty plates in surprise, then smiled at him. "How did you manage it?"
"Definitely older," Mycroft whispered in return, and as he felt Greg shiver against him, he pressed a kiss into his hair and tightened his arms around him. "There was never anyone but you, you were all I ever wanted, and the day you came back to me was the day my life started again." Greg sighed against his shoulder and soon he felt tears dampening his shirt.
Sherlock nodded. “I am certain. I made sure this interview is private. No one else will know what you say here. I promised you would be safe. Please continue.”
John shook his head and nodded wordlessly in Sherlock’s direction as he watched one tall and lanky red-headed woman drop into their couch. He blinked as another woman, identical to the first strode over to Sherlock, who was slowly removing his rubber gloves as he got to his feet.
"Not ridiculous. He knows you would fight to get back to him, if you were in his place, now come and sit down, it's gonna be a long night."
John blinked at the shiny, well-scrubbed floor, then rubbed his eyes. “How long did the surgery take?”
"Oh, Dr Watson, apologies, I just thought I'd -" She paused and smiled at him. "You got him to sleep. I'm sure I've never believed in miracle workers but you just worked one, young man. He rarely sleeps when he's in one piece, and when he's banged up as he is now -"
Donovan opened her eyes to find Dee sitting quietly by her bed. She studied the strong, beautiful profile for a few minutes and reached out to take her hand. Dee startled, then smiled and lifted their joined hands to her lips. She looked into Donovan's eyes and raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"
"Damn." John muttered to himself, and sighed as he glanced at the plates and glasses, and the remaining glass of wine left in the decanter.
John stood up as straight as he could and almost wished for his stick again, just to have some sort of protection. "Yes. Do I know you?"
Sherlock shrugged and slowly got to his feet, then squinted at the clock on the wall. He'd slept six hours. He couldn't remember the last time he'd slept so long. He looked over at Dee again and she pointed him forward, he sighed, but had nothing else to do, so he started walking until he found himself in a chair by Donovan's bedside.
John shook his head, then leaned down and pressed a kiss to the worried crinkle between Sherlock’s eyes. “It’s nothing, just - you are happy, aren’t you, still?”
John slowly stood up, carried the big pieces of the mug into the kitchen and binned them - he looked around the kitchen and wondered what exactly he was getting himself into, as he realized how little he knew about the man he'd spent so much time with the last couple of years.
John looked into the ever-changing eyes and seeing the truth of his words, walked to the other side of the bed and slipped into the empty space and carefully curled around him. He marveled at how easily they seemed to fit together, as if two pieces of the same puzzle.
He was taking a stroll - well, not exactly a stroll. A stroll implies he was relaxed, not in pain, not feeling as if everyone he passed looked at him like he was less - less than he had been, when he noticed a barber shop he didn't remember. Of course it had been four years since he'd been home, and he wasn't sure he even really remembered what shops were in his neighborhood before he had left for Afghanistan, since he was rarely home when it wasn't dark. He ran his hand over his face, he could use a shave, and he always felt better after a haircut, so he pushed open the door and limped into the shop, then nearly walked right out again.
"Eat?" John suggested mildly as he poured them each a small glass of wine, and turned his attention to dinner. Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, but picked up his plate and after glaring at it mercilessly, picked up his fork and began to eat, possibly simply as an experiment, but after a moment, John couldn't help but grin to himself as Sherlock realized he was in fact hungry.
Sherlock blinked at him. “You know I am, from the first moment I sat across from you downstairs at Speedy’s. Maybe even before that. I know it’s only been three months and a few days, but -”
"The world is a bloody awful mess most days, which is why we have jobs," Sherlock replied with a snort, then glanced over at him again. "But there are days, moments when the mess seems to fall away, and I can see the good that exists. Donovan and Dee - you -"
She snorted and offered him a smile. "Thank her please, and thank you." She looked down and nodded at the other bag, and what is that then?"
John nodded. "He was my superior. He was the best. A good man in a bad war. None of us should have been there. His humvee hit an IED, and he got out."
Mrs Hudson nodded and finally met John’s eyes. “I know - well, I know that there were rumors, - before you were hurt, that you and he -”
John heard something in Sherlock's voice that made him back around. "You don't know," he said with a bit of surprise.
Relationships of any sort had always been a puzzle that he realized early on were a waste of time. Well, that is, until now. From the very beginning, in fact from the moment John offered him his phone, he had felt something unloosen in his chest, he stood a little taller, breathed a little easier. It was simple, though he understood after many days of contemplation, it wasn't something he could untangle with logic. They weren't logical, there was no reason at all why they should work as they did, they simply were.
Sherlock nodded and switched off the microscope, then got to his feet. "Come, we should look at James' rooms." He walked over to John and offered him his hand and helping him to stand said softly, "Give me the word and I will walk away from this case, John."
James let out a groan, then held his hand to his face, but went on. “Doc. Tad - he had been working on something in his library, you remember - when he was researching - nothing could distract him, but he had been different the last few months, as if he was worried about something, or someone, I don’t know -” He reached into his pocket and pulled out an old envelope, then shook out its contents into his hand.
"Definitely historical. Accuracy isn't the point." Molly thought of the current book by her bedside and took a sip of her coffee to hide her blush, then said, "It helps the reader become more distracted from reality, which is the point, after all."
"Honestly I don't know, I had forgotten about Tad, to tell you the truth, James never spoke about him when we were in Afghanistan, and he received no letters. They must have come to some agreement when he came back to live here." John looked around the room again and shook his head. "James never wanted for anything when he was at Uni, but I had no idea about this place, he and Tad never went home for the holidays -"
As he opened his eyes that morning, he could distinctly recall those endless days of smoky grey, then forced them from his consciousness as Sherlock rolled in his arms and studied him silently for a long moment before he opened his mouth to speak, then changed his mind.
“Nothing with regard to her legal matters. I did, however, call Mycroft and arranged for the best reconstructive surgeon in Europe to have a look at Harry—Dr. Josephina Keener. She was one of the doctors who treated me…after Serbia,” Sherlock finished quietly.
John stared at Sherlock, who looked like some strange Fae changeling by firelight and burst out laughing.
“Sherlock isn’t in love with me,” John blurted, at a complete loss as to how this conversation had gone so far out of control but struggling to re-assert some modicum of sanity into the mix.
Was he really ready to replace that ring with another? When the immediate and resounding answer his heart supplied was not a definite “NO” but a tentative “Maybe Soon,” he sighed again. That response should have terrified him for more reasons than one; it did not. There was a time when his colleagues even suspecting that he was seeing another man—romantically—would have terrified him to the point of emotionally crippling him. Now, it made him blush…stammer a little and look down at the floor. In short, it made him act like a fifteen year old with a crush; he thought that was infinitely better than the sense of deep, homophobic shame he had felt just three months ago. He made a mental note to report this as progress to Dr. Wallace.
Unknown to John, Sherlock was about to take Lestrade’s casual, drunken analysis of marriage, a comment that Lestrade would no longer remember he had ever uttered when he sobered up the next afternoon, to a place even other high functioning sociopaths fear to tread. And he would do it all with impeccable logic and deductive reasoning based soundly on the scientific method. John Watson was doomed.
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow, but constitutionally unable to let a mystery lie unopened, he did exactly as John expected.
“The real one in the dungeon or the one upstairs where everyone thinks you’re a minor government employee?”
John felt an ache bloom deep in his chest at the sheer kindness Sherlock was capable of, when he wanted to be kind. “Thank you,” John murmured softly. “Oh God, I’m going to be late for work,” John cried out as he attempted to lever himself into a standing position.
“It was a simple cost-benefit analysis. I was a university student with limited access to funds. For fifty pounds, I could stay high for two days, before my tolerance developed, of course. A two day reset would secure several months of optimal mental functioning. The same amount would only purchase an hour, two at the most, with a prostitute. If I elected to choose a partner from a club, there was still the expense of a room somewhere, the risk of being robbed or killed if I had chosen badly—it’s very difficult to make accurate observations and deductions over the pounding noise and flashing lights, and there were other complications—the ones who fancied a relationship or wanted to talk for half the night. A few orgasms will ensure a week or two, at most, of optimal neural functioning. I need sex more frequently than heroin, as the neurochemical release isn’t for the same sustained duration as the high from heroin, but it is just as effective if done on a fairly frequent basis. However, given the drawbacks—the escalating costs, the time and trouble to secure a willing partner,” Sherlock shrugged nonchalantly, “it just wasn’t worth it.”
John flinched at the crass euphemism. It was rare for Sherlock’s posh cadences to devolve into common street slang, but Sherlock did nothing more than raise a slightly amused eyebrow at John’s startled reaction as he continued. “People seem to think that emotions alter the equation, make sex more than just a satisfying release of neuro chemicals.”
"John,” Sherlock shouted before bounding up the stairs two at a time before slamming the door. “It was like Christmas and my birthday all rolled together. The murder/suicide that the police thought was a murder/murder was actually a suicide/murder. The perpetrator made it appear as if he was actually the victim….” Sherlock trailed off as John failed to muster the usual enthusiasm for The Work.
“As I said before, there was a target painted on the back of your head. If you had tried to accompany Sherlock, you would have led the assassins straight to him, and you would both be dead. For what it’s worth, I am sorry for the pain and grief this caused to you, but things had to play out in this manner. There was simply no other way.”
Lestrade’s callous, drunken remark had scared him, a cold, icy knot forming in his gut and radiating tendrils of emptiness and despair. It would be so easy to lose this—this niche he had carved for himself in John’s life…this happiness. He had to make sure John was happy, that all of his needs were being met, that John had no reason to leave. Hence the breaking and entering he was currently perpetrating upon John’s laptop. Fifty-one minutes later Sherlock closed the laptop with a soft snap after reading the last ten private blog entries and wiping all traces of his electronic fingerprints from the computer’s hard drive.
He racked his brain for information and settled on an incident that occurred when he was six. He had been flying his kite when it had become entangled in a tree; he had tugged gently at the string to see if it would drop loose, but the kite had torn and come down in pieces at his feet. He had run to mummy sniffling, dragging the corpse of the now deceased kite behind him.
Mycroft studied the man in front of him, damaged, proud, angry, guilty, and just a little bit desperate. “If I thought you really wanted to know…”
John fidgeted in his chair, crossed and uncrossed his legs and tugged the collar of his oatmeal colored jumper away from his neck, sweat beginning to gather at his nape.
“Mycroft is…more intelligent than I am,” Sherlock admitted with his teeth gritted. “If he saw a way to salvage this mess, then he’s very likely right.”
Afterwards, John had stood on legs as unsteady as a newborn fawn’s, rinsed himself off and fallen into bed where he slept for nine hours straight.
His breath raspy, and his body tingling, John muttered a “who the hell will ever know” to himself and slipped a soapy fingertip inside the rim, working gently to loosen the tight ring of muscle.
“Come on,” John said as he tugged Sherlock to his feet and headed toward the bedroom after banking the fire and ensuring that the safety screen was firmly in place. “We’re not canceling,” John said decisively, “especially not at the last minute,” he said as the bedroom door closed. “Bed, sleep, now.”
As he turned to thank his erstwhile benefactor, the words choked in his throat as he met the blue-grey eyes of Mycroft Holmes.
“And I’m telling you that I didn’t label my profile “Endlessly Horny and Desperate,” John seethed. “What sane man would put up a profile like that?” he asked in a low hiss.
“Look, Sherlock, you don’t have to…” John began, uncertain as to how he was going to end that sentence, but Sherlock interrupted swiftly.
Things were working out even better than she had planned. After trying for years to get her boys together--after all, Mrs. Turner had married ones, and she had no intentions of being outdone by Ida Turner--she’d finally hit upon the perfect plan.
“Yeah, I do,” John said with a smile. “C’mon…it’s nice, and…well…think of it as additional data to analyze later,” John cajoled softly.
Hands clutched tightly around his chipped blue mug, he finally asked on a sigh, “Do you want me to move out?”
“I understand your reluctance to assist Harry with her legal matters, and I know that you fear she would be able to manipulate you emotionally as she has done before. That would be detrimental to your psychological well-being and, therefore, could affect Rosie and your patients.” John nodded, wary now. “I, however, have no emotional relationship with her and cannot be manipulated. So, I am proposing that you allow me to see if something can be done to assure that she does not spend what effectively amounts to the rest of her life in prison.”
“What does it matter at this point?” John asked tiredly, a tinge of irritation lacing his tone. “I bare my fucking soul to you, bleeding and raw thing that it is, and your takeaway is some obscure comment Mycroft made?”
“You realize that the British legal system is inadequate to set up and enforce such a program?” John said softly, waiting for the shoe to drop.
John snapped his fingers twice in front of Sherlock’s glazed eyes causing the detective to jerk back and his eyes to…finally…focus on John’s face.
The pressure returned. Sherlock began rocking gently. A few minutes later there was a strangled whimper.
He had been on edge for hours, and regardless of how embarrassing it was going to be to come in under five minutes, it was going to happen—he could already feel the telltale tingles at the base of his spine, spreading out in long, slow, rolling waves deep into his abdomen.
Rosie snuffled as if she were preparing herself for a good cry, and both men held their breath as she settled back down with a whimper.
When John’s heart rate and breathing returned to normal, or no longer in danger of cardiac arrest normal, he closed his eyes and sat back to think. He’d need all of his energy to deal with Sherlock on a tirade.
“Well, then get up and help me get dinner on,” he said as he delivered a sharp slap to the vicinity of Sherlock’s arse, which, thanks to the thick duvet was really no more than a love pat.
Sherlock looked like someone had kicked his puppy. Muttering “fine” in a low voice, he exited the flat. A few moments later John heard his deep baritone calling out for a taxi, then silence.
John looked at Clara and offered her a fond, sad smile. “Sherlock’s right. He usually is, but never tell him I said so,” John said as his smile widened. “This isn’t your fault. This was all on Harry, all of it. I hope, at the very least, you can find some peace now,” he offered with a tremulous note to his voice.
“I know, but I came to the realization that manipulating you, even if it got me what I wanted, it would ultimately hurt you when you found out that I had manipulated and deceived you. Regardless, I failed you.”
Ordinarily his conscience would niggle at him for something like this, and for some reason, his conscience sounded like John repeating over and over, “bit not good, Sherlock.” But, needs must, he supposed.
“Yes, I know. I know how people look down on addicts, how we are judged, how people say, ‘well, you should have known better than to inject that filth, that poison, into your body.’ And in the event of an overdose,” Sherlock mocked, “just another dead junkie. Isn’t society so much better off? And almost no one wants to look with compassion and see the people behind the addiction. If society could just give one moment of thought to how much emotional, physical or psychological torment a human being must be suffering to actually inject that filth, that poison into a vein? I know the legalities as well you do, but it doesn’t make it right.”
John arched an eyebrow, crossed his arms and settled back into the seat, drawing the blanket snugly around him despite being almost overly warm at this point.
He had led “Mr. Smith” flawlessly through the script, which eventually necessitated “the patient” disrobing for a prostate exam. John had exited the room to allow his “patient” to change into a gown and returned to find the young man standing by the exam table nervously clutching the gown together in the back. John had reassured the young man, and the first part of the exam had been textbook. “The patient” had leaned over the edge of the examination table and John had gloved, squirted some of the warmed lubricant onto his fingers and gently inserted his index finger.
“John,” she whispered in a throaty rasp as he turned toward the door. He turned back and approached the bed carefully, movements consciously mimicking Lestrade’s as he came to her bedside and offered his hand. She grasped it tightly. “I’m pressing charges this time. I had a restraining order, and she came anyway. I was so careful to keep my address a secret,” her whispered rasp of a voice began to shake, and John realized she was sobbing now, her body shaking jerkily with each gasp and cry.
“Because then I would seriously have to question your sanity. You know what I’m like, John. I won’t remember your birthday, or anniversaries. I’ll forget to buy milk and bread. I’ll sulk and whinge and will, undoubtedly, shoot a new face into the wall the next time I’m bored. I’ll walk away when you’re talking and in a strop; I’ll leave you to hare off on my own to chase questionable leads, and the pancreas in the refrigerator is non-negotiable as are the fecal samples in the ice cube trays.”
“I wasn’t going to get high. I promised you when you and Rosie moved in that I wouldn’t do that anymore. I have kept my promise. I cannot guarantee that I won’t relapse, no addict can, but I will do all in my power to keep my word to you.” Sherlock’s affect was nearly flat. His words cool, detached. This, whatever it was, was clearly a subject that he did not want to discuss.
“Last night…if things had gone the way I hoped…over the wine with the fire going… It was supposed to be romantic.”
Although cashing in this favor prematurely irked Mycroft to no end, it did give him an opportunity to speak with Dr. Watson alone before Sherlock could make a muck of things—a most definite certainty, and Mycroft shuddered to think how that conversation would have gone. Allowing tactless, socially inept Sherlock to actually proposition the good doctor…Mycroft shuddered again as he considered the potential for disaster that could only be measured on the Richter Scale…, which is how Mycroft found himself currently seated on a bench outside of the penguin exhibit at the London Zoo.
John made no argument, clumsily following along on stiffly frozen joints until he was deposited into the back of Mycroft’s car. Two sharp raps to the dividing glass, and John felt the strongly purring engine pull smoothly into the light traffic around the square. The warmth was both a blessed relief and a curse as extremities previously numbed by the cold began to ache with sharp, tingling needles as blood flow was restored.
