"Yes," Mary said. "It cost my friend her life."
Only five days ago, if he'd been asked, he would have said that romance was irrelevant, that their bond of friendship was more than enough, but just now, seeing John's stricken face, the confusion, embarrassment, and disappointment that he'd imperfectly covered with anger, he couldn't say that in good conscience any longer. Perhaps somewhere out there, there were a thousand iterations of Holmes and Watson, and perhaps nine hundred and ninety-nine of them were content with the bond of friendship. But not here, not now.
"Real IRA."
"No," Benedict said, and then realised how sharply he'd spoken. He opened his mouth to apologise and stopped.
"Fine," Sherlock sighed. "Tell him I'm here." He went into the library, thumped into a wing chair next to the glowing, deliciously warm fire, and glanced round indifferently. This room, indeed Mycroft's entire house, was a paean to traditionalism and self-conscious, infinitely dreary good taste. No doubt Mycroft had sensibly scorned the services of an interior designer and selected most of the furnishings on his own, having memorised the contents of his club and a hundred other great houses, but there wasn't a single scrap of whimsy or idiosyncrasy to be seen, unless he was as prudish as one of their Victorian forebears, the sort who never so much as sneezed in public but who had a locked cabinet full of pornographic books and photographs. That might almost make him bearable, come to think of it.
John grunted and squeezed his eyes shut.
"Mm," Sherlock said.
"On the two occasions that we've gone to a pub, you had to intervene before I was beaten to a pulp. Though I'd have thought it was fairly obvious that those rugby players were there to buy cocaine, and that incident with the MP and the under-aged girl was even more painfully obvious."
"Angelo's?" Benedict suggested, and saw John's face contract a little, as if he had a sharp pain. "Or maybe not. You two probably eat there all the time."
"In that case, if there's been no change following the confirmatory testing, we'll get her to a private room on a ventilator so that you and your daughter can have some time with her before we begin surgery."
"No," Benedict said hollowly.
Sherlock's only reply was a negative shake of his head.
"That's right," Moran said. "There are still a few reputable people who are willing to be seen with me. You seem to have taken care of the rest."
Bag of thumbs. Big one.
long legs, for one."
It was all simple chemistry, really – a surge in the body's production of bliss-inducing dopamine, that reward circuitry – oxytocin, serotonin, phenylethylamine, adrenaline, endorphins –
"I can't simply whisk him away from –"
"Fantastic," Sherlock said. "I guess that's it, then."
“We’ve got to go dancing or something. That’ll give you an excuse. Hang on.” Janine moved out of the changing area toward the rack with the fluffy dresses.
John came back from the loo, and Benedict arranged his features into an expression of deadpan boredom. He would have preferred to give John a friendly smile, but he didn't want to break character, and oddly, he didn't want to unnerve John, who already seemed a bit suspicious that something was amiss. Unless that was Benedict's paranoia. Maybe.
"Okay," John said evenly. "Thanks for staying with her. You ready, darling?"
"Obviously. Yeah." John exhaled. "You and your sodding ego." He was quiet for a moment, then said, "You were different."
"Now you remember!" Moriarty chortled. "God, you're easy to read, Sherlock. It was all very mysterious. He was terminally ill, poor man, even if he was a serial killer, and some heartless person shot him. It was a good shot, but still – awful." He clucked in mock dismay. "And the gunman was never found. I expect they still have the ballistics report, though, don't you think, Sherlock? What do you suppose the police would do if the weapon turned up and they dug up the owner of record? I mean, it was two years ago in Afghanistan, but there are recent prints on it. Ooh, I don't know. What do you think?"
occasional helplessness seemed to arouse John's more protective and affectionate instincts, though obviously Sherlock would have never mentioned that aloud.
'Sherlock' sighed and rolled his eyes. "Look, I don't know who you are and I don't really care, but the fact is that we've obviously been thrown together as a result of some sort of…anomaly. Temporal or spatial, I don't know yet."
"Oh, God, so do I," John mumbled. "I don't know what the fuck she was thinking." He pulled away and rubbed his eyes. "Sorry about the bottle."
"I know. 'He Made Me Wear the Hat.' 'Shag-a-lot Holmes.'"
Sherlock.
"It wasn't locked," she said indifferently. "I was here, on the sofa, and a man and a woman came in."
He went to the cupboards and threw the doors open. What was
"All right," Sherlock said quietly. "I will." He bit his lower lip. "Is John okay?"
"Uhnf."
"Stephanotis," Mary said, heading upstairs. "I'll be back to help you clear."
"No?" Benedict typed in the first set of digits. "That's a very pretty dress you're wearing."
"Please leave a message at the tone," Mycroft's voice said smoothly.
"See you in a week, Ben."
"Oh, Lord. If I must."
John shrugged. “Who knows. Barbecue tongs?”
He liked the adulation, the gifts, the squealing. He ate it up. Even the paparazzi could be managed, to a degree. They weren't following him everywhere, not yet at least, and maybe he'd never achieve that level of fame anyhow, but he hadn't signed up for this at all.
The sun was setting when the squad car pulled up in front of 221B, and Benedict felt as if he'd been awake for three days straight.  He got out of the car and held the door open for John, then dragged himself inside. He smelled something nice – a combination of roasting chicken and baking bread. Mrs Hudson was cooking.
Benedict brushed his fingertips across Tom's right nipple, then bent to suck at it, teasing it with his tongue, feeling it harden in his mouth. He moved to the left nipple, swirling it with wet warmth, then traced his tongue upward until he fastened his mouth on Tom's throat. "Missed you, love."
"Of course. Thanks," Mary said, fastening the belt and setting the bag down.
"I wasn't lying about the phone. It's my protection. Without it, I've got nothing, nothing at all."
Mary hit the snooze on her phone, half-squinted at the gloomy dawn, and listened to the patter of rain on the roof. She rolled over, burying her face into John's pillows. Ten minutes, and she'd get up, start breakfast, get Nora to school, head to work. Tim had a complicated rhinoplasty at ten, and she was leaving straight away afterward to come back home to chart possible itineraries. The next few weeks were going to be slippery, and she couldn't afford to fuck up. Fucking
Benedict turned to Moriarty. Their eyes were at the same level, and though he was frightened, he channelled his fear into brimming contempt. "Get your dogs to heel, Jim."
"And then will they dump her at sea?"
“What about this?” Janine proffered a silky pink number with a cascade of asymmetrical ruffles down the front.
"You okay, Daddy?"
listen." John threw his book aside and leapt to his feet. He stalked toward Benedict, his face like thunder, and pointed to an easy chair. "Sit down, shut your gob, and for once in your life, you fucking listen."
"Good. He was elderly, but there's still a possibility –" A telephone shrilled from somewhere inside the house.
Sherlock stared at the gesture and drank more wine.
As ever, profuse thanks are due to kimberlite and vilestrumpet for their close, careful beta and Britpicking.
"Your concern is noted," the Under-Secretary said. Tall, with the build of the ageing rugby player he was, he handed the glorified screw a sheet of flimsy. "The code words are correct, I believe?"
"Good." Benedict unscrewed the jar of obscenely expensive seaweed cream and dipped his fingers inside. He moved his hand, grasping Tom's tight round arse for a moment before he worked two fingers into Tom's body.
God damn it.
A little smile curled the corners of Sherlock's mouth. He shook his head again. "No, John."
"Not particularly."
"You think she's going to talk to us? Her boyfriend just died of possibly mysterious causes, remember? She might even be making arrangements for him."
The phone pinged with a text from Mycroft, hot on the heels of the four unanswered calls he'd made. Sherlock picked up the phone.
Sherlock looked down and saw John's hand on the seat between them. What if he were to simply cover it with his own – would that be an extraordinary liberty, or would John appreciate it?
He thought of that other world. Millions of words about Sherlock and John.
. And if you let her wear it now, she's going to want to wear it outside."
"Annalise, in fact." Mycroft offered Sherlock a glacial smile. "It seems she has a rather colourful and chequered past."
"It's a poison," Sherlock said, "derived from a plant, the family Ranunculaceae. It's also called Wolfsbane. It causes the ventricles to –"
"I know it's a lot to ask."
John gave him a searching look, but said nothing.
Sherlock tucked his phone back into his pocket and headed for the pathology lab.
"Yes. Right. True." Moriarty tapped his chin and frowned. "Hm."
killed her. I only have one question, and it's this:  why did she permit it?"
"Jesus," John breathed. "Jesus." He got up, went to the worktop, and poured himself a generous helping of pinot. He took a deep swig. "He was right. The whole time, Sherlock was right. You've been lying to me for – how long? Our whole marriage?"
. It may be familiar if you are a fan of the film
to some Victorian who couldn't bear the thought of not being close to a body of water, never mind that Lough Foyle was no more than three miles away – and what must have been ornamental gardens on the other, though now the shrubberies and flower beds were overgrown, a wilderness. The house itself was utterly dark and in some disrepair – in the hazy and elusive moonlight, Sherlock noticed bits of crumbling stonework and damage to the roof. Evidently Lord Moran didn't spend much time here: judging by his London residence, luxurious and well-kept surroundings were important to him. But that didn't mean he didn't use the place when necessary.
“They’re probably busy.”
John scanned quickly for the nearest weapon. There was an iron candlestick on one of the shelves in the lounge. He left the door ajar and crept toward it, stepping deftly over the creak in the floor near the entrance.
"Yeah, of course. Have a bit of that, then I'll help you to your room."
"Where's John? Mary –"
"Hm. Good deduction." A tiny dart of discomfort struck him, but he ignored it. "So what's it to be? Creamy or teriyaki?"
Benedict waited three seconds after the last footfall had died away, and then, heedless of Sherlock's dignity, rose and hurried toward John. "John."
"All those windows. Gets the eastern light."
"You seem to have recovered from your little mishap."
It had been too easy to manoeuvre the whole thing. He already had access to Bart's – a little bit of efficient hired muscle and a couple of laundry carts, easy-peasy. The pair of them lay crumpled on the gritty grey surface of the roof, snugged up against the ledge (best to avoid satellite snapshots), wrists bound and gobs taped shut, and completely out cold.
"Fantastic," Sherlock said. He'd taken the wine and was easing the cork from the bottle.
The parlour was empty, but there were noises in the kitchen – John was making breakfast. Benedict smelled sausage and simmering beans, and his stomach registered the delicious odours noisily. He tightened his mouth, crept quietly into his bedroom, and put on fresh clothes – a dark indigo-coloured shirt and dark jeans. Thumping to the bed with his socks in hand, he listened to John's scraping and mixing and tried not to feel hurt.
"Negative," came the second agent's voice. No,
Benedict heard the scraping of chair legs against lino tile and the sound of a body settling itself. He kept his eyes closed. "John."
"You haven't, have you?"
"The lawyer read her will to me."
It was lovely to simply sit and watch and listen, no-one to disturb him, nothing that was so urgent as to require his presence at the Ziggurat. This Christmas was no more or less memorable than many other Christmases in Mycroft’s ceaselessly busy existence. His parents were safely at arm’s length, Sherlock was, as ever, failing to maintain regular communication, and all was well at Sherrinford. As was his custom, he’d politely declined the invitation to the yearly Christmas party at Thames House – though, he noted, the invitation had been very late in arriving, almost last-minute. It was silly to be vexed, and yet. Never mind – altogether it was a very pleasant time of year, this peace and quiet. Lovely, really.
"Clearly."
John, feeling suddenly wicked, smiled. “Snail’s pace.”
"So I am," Sherlock said, and got to his feet with a wince. His knees hurt.
April 1999
"John…." Mary got into bed and pulled up the duvet. "Yes, I did. Does that upset you?"
"We're investigating. The car had no identifiable plates, and visibility was poor because of the rain. They couldn't get a clear shot of his face."
"Did you have a good class?"
"She does," Moriarty said. "Years now. But I can tell you she doesn't come cheap. Competent help rarely does. You know," he added, leaning forward confidentially, "you probably shouldn't have told Johnny-boy about her little moonlighting gig. Might have saved you both some grief, huh?"
"He's fine, as far as I know," Benedict said. "I've only seen him twice since this whole thing started."
"Better," Tom said. He grasped Ben's other hand and turned it, looking at his watch. "We have a few hours before we have to meet the RADA gang." Springing to his feet, he stared down at Ben – those intense eyes, the pale column of his throat, his hands.
"That's interesting," Sherlock remarked. "Is that childhood conditioning that draws you to hateful militants, or just –"
John's voice, like Martin's (or was Martin's like John's?) was soft, easy on the ear. Benedict was reminded of car trips to relatives' places – 'Darling, we're at Gran's. Put your shoes on' – and now, as then, he would have been happy to stay asleep in the cab. It could drive him away and he wouldn't have to cope with this madness any longer.
"Can we read a bit before bed?" She held a battered copy of
"Well, finish up and then we'll see." Mary crossed to John and caressed his shoulder. "Merry Christmas, love."
"No," Sherlock snapped. He opened the door, swung his legs out, and carefully exited the car in an effort to spare himself further humiliation. Not a serious injury, the doctor at A&E had said – the staff had iced it and bandaged it tightly and given him a painkiller, and then advised him to use the RICE method of treatment. He would, they asserted, be right as rain in a few weeks.
Sherlock rubbed at his burning eyes and glanced up as the door opened. Two women and a man, all bearing cleaning supplies, stared at him curiously. "Hello," one of the women said.
“Oh, nothing,” Martha said, putting a hand over his, as much to stop the roaming fingers as to convey affection. “I’m feeling wonderful. One or two more of these and I’ll be even better.” She sipped at the cordial. She’d been drinking more, she noticed, when she was with Gautam. Out of simple enjoyment, yes, but there was something else that she couldn’t quite put her finger on. It wasn’t that she didn’t like spending time with him – it was more that everything just felt the same lately.
A little shudder rippled through John's insides. "Yeah. Jesus. He lent that to me…must be five years ago. Six, maybe."
"This is the nastiest trick anyone's ever pulled on me. Those letters – Jesus Christ, it was like something a psychopath would write. Well done you, I guess. Untie me, my hands are numb."
Mary undid one clasp, and Sherlock's hand fell to his side. He let out a small, hurt noise, and though God knew that he'd fucked things up for her more than once, not all of her heart had turned to stone. She was afraid to rub his back comfortingly, so she settled for a steady, soothing stream of talk. "Right, I'm going to undo the other hand. Try to stay upright, okay? It's going to hurt, but I don't want you to hit your head." She unfastened the second clasp, and as Sherlock swayed, she hopped off the bench, caught him round the waist, and lowered him to the floor.
, full stop. He wanted to pick up Nora and…and what, exactly? Take off on a trip around the world? No, he didn't want that – Mary did. He didn't want to go back to work on Monday, he didn't want night after night of comfort and familiarity, not –
"Gauloise Brune."
“My goodness,” Violet said. “This is a first.”
. Only a few months ago, there had been snapshots of the two of them leaving the restaurant together. Looking at them, Benedict had felt sick. Someone had been watching them, had seen them enter perhaps, had waited the entire time they'd eaten. What if the photographer had come inside? Had known, somehow…?
Benedict plucked uneasily at the tines of his fork as he watched John walk rather stumpily off to the loo. He let his face relax and then stretched his jaw and rolled his head back and forth. God, he was tense. Being Sherlock wasn't the easiest, despite the nice reviews about him inhabiting the role. It took a certain physical discipline to maintain Sherlock's facial expressions, and being 'on' with no respite was beginning to take its toll – he felt tired and out of sorts, and more than ready to go home.
"Look, just let them go."
"Are you going to invite Sherlock for dinner?" Nora inquired.
Mary's heart sank.
"Possibly. There was a deliveryman moving past her, and he jostled her, she said. She also reported a break-in during the previous evening. After the accident, her sight began to fail. She's now entirely blind and doctors are blaming it on the fall."
Still trying to gather breath, Sherlock merely met Moriarty's gaze. It was enough, he thought, not to look away at the moment.
"Ah. Nice." Moriarty sounded admiring. "I'll bet he's delighted to be babysitting. What if both of you die? Does he get to keep her?"
"What are you –"
!" Sherlock drew back, swirling his tongue round and round, then bent low again.
Sherlock went back into the bedroom and found Cumberbatch's phone on the night table. He turned it on – oh, ten percent battery, damn it – and scrolled through the messages. He hadn't answered any from the night before, and there were a rash of new texts now as well.
"Yeah. Yeah, sure." Mary smiled. "I'm just surprised, that's all. No, it's great. Why don't you bring him round? He hasn't seen Nora in ages and I'm sure she'd love to meet him. Or see him again. Do you remember him, sweetheart?"
Someone in black interposed himself between them.
he know Sherlock's passcode?
Once more, the game was on.
Not for nothing had Benedict made a really thorough study of the identity and character of Sherlock Holmes in the 21st century. He had his full name, date and place of birth, parents' names, even his NHS number memorised, along with sundry other information that might have proved useful. He paused in the midst of filling out forms.
"Is that a fact? Well, I didn't agree to you running about with Sherlock again. You just decided to do it, out of the blue."
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, John," Mycroft said, his attention diverted for a moment.
"I'm sorry – "
Probably the aftereffect of the drugs.
"Nope."
Mycroft ushered Anthea into the car and stood beside it, regarding Sherlock thoughtfully. "I'm glad you're home. We were all quite worried."
"A cleaning woman found her in the loo of the BA first-class lounge, propped up against the wall. She'd bought a ticket to Marseilles. Cash. Bought a Pellegrino at the lounge bar. Bartender said he tried to flirt with her, no luck." Lestrade grimaced a bit. "Didn't see her go to the loo, but it was about fifteen minutes later that he heard the cleaning woman scream. There were about twelve people in the lounge at any given time. Three flights left between thirteen-forty when she bought her ticket and fourteen-twenty when she was found. We're detaining the first class passengers." Lestrade sighed. "British Airways isn't happy with us, but what the hell can you do?"
John scowled, but got up and retrieved the pack and lighter, setting them on the coffee table. "You know, you'd have an easier time breathing if you cut back a bit."
Feelings. Christ.
Heat rose into Sherlock's cheeks. He lifted one shoulder in a negligent shrug. "I'm rusty."
Sherlock snorted. "What ever gave you that idea?"
Tom pushed himself up to one elbow. "You're – you're as cool as a cucumber. I'm impressed."
"Sorry. How's it going? I'd hoped you'd call."
"Oh, that's perfect," John said, taking the flowers and wine. "We're having lasagna. Here, let's have your coat."
"Get out," Benedict said. "And if John so much as stubs his toe in jail, you'll find out exactly what kind of angel I am."
"Oh, you're going to interrogate me? Well, all right." Moriarty practically wriggled in his chair in delight. "Fire away."
Sherlock patted his mouth with a napkin, discreetly stifling a burp. "No, that's Mycroft's department."
"So how did you know someone was just in the office?" John leant against the wall of the lift, dapper and trim in his smart coat. "Could have been anybody, you know. That girl with the blue hair."
"Five days," Moran said, standing up. "Are you listening to me? Five. Days." He smiled; the smile wrinkled his face into a hundred deep seams and his eyes glittered like chips of ice. "Not that that matters, really. My reputation's been utterly ruined. My wife left me and took the children with her. I haven't seen them in almost ten years. My former friends cut me dead in the street. But I stayed out of prison, and I've got all
He turned on his heel and picked his way through the wet grass toward the brick path, back to London.
"Don't make me come back now, Mr Holmes."
"Yeah, yeah," John laughed, but his face had gone noticeably pink, even in the grey light of the bedroom. "I used to read about you in the papers and online. Not a lot, it was too…but sometimes, yeah. You never worked with anybody else."
Bit sad, really. If it had been 1982 – the most brilliant year of 80s pop, in his opinion, the year of ‘Goody Two-Shoes’ and ‘Mirror Man’ and ‘Don’t Go’ – he’d have been having it off with Nige Lambertson and a pilfered bottle of Hendricks in the broom cupboard of Nige’s parents as they hosted their Christmas drinks party. An hour later, after a lot of groping and pawing, he’d have skulked off, back to his parents’ house as they watched some naff Christmas show on telly. They’d greet him amiably, befuddled by his togs and his smeared lippy but wonderfully quiet on the matter, and offer him tea and a biscuit.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, but as Mycroft leant forward and spoke softly into his ear, he found himself unbending.
Slowly, Sherlock reached up and brushed the pad of his thumb over John's lower lip.
"I suppose so."
Her gaze was blue and innocent. "Phone?"
"About Moriarty. I never thanked you for that."
His face still pushed against Sherlock's chest, John nodded. "Yeah," he said, his voice muffled. "I'm okay. I'm going to…." Carefully, he pulled out and caressed Sherlock’s inner thigh. "Sorry, I'm –"
"That's good news, at least."
Unlikely.
"Yes," Sherlock said abstractedly. He frowned. "Twins."
John gave him another smile. "You're in rare form." He took the food to the newly clean worktop and found plates.
"Don't be." Sherlock flexed his neck from side to side. "I should probably sleep a bit."
"Ooh, don't tell him that," Mary said with a laugh, and winked at John. John chuckled and winked back.
Tom laughed. "Glad I'm driving." He poked Sherlock in the arm. "I'm teasing. You've earned it. You've had a peculiar few days, haven't you?"
"It's her game, Ben," Steven had assured him. "She's got her game the way Sherlock has his. That's why they're so brilliant together."
John sighed a little. The coat had been gorgeous, but he hadn't even given himself the luxury of trying it on. "Oh, Mary…I don't mind about the dress, but…."
"Sorry?" Sherlock repeated. "What on earth for? I failed to speak up so many times that I actually became comfortable with it. I told myself that your emergence in my life was an accident of circumstance and that friendship was perfectly acceptable. I hadn't the courage to hurdle my own obstacles. I declared my adoration for you to a room full of people. What more perfect barrier could there be?"
"Certainly. Certainly." He couldn't bear that. "I'd better be off. You probably have to fetch Eleanor."
Nevertheless, John stayed put, frozen, the feeling of Sherlock's arms around him too exquisite to take in properly. And then his cock started to twitch.
pants. Sherlock might have guessed.
Dr Roche shook her head. "It's all right, Mr Holmes. How could you know? Those little ones – " She gestured with her gloved hand. "They're the reason I'm in orthopaedics, those poor little bones. Okay, one more needle. Ready?"
That was the moment it had coalesced:  something was terribly, terribly wrong with his beautiful girl.
Well, he'd come all this way and he didn't want to just pitch the thing out. It had probably cost a fortune. He pushed the door open and went inside, up the stairs, and into the flat.
Tom removed the whistling kettle. "How do you take it?"
The Under-Secretary peered at him warily. "I'll say goodbye, then."
It was unsigned.
Sherlock smiled and touched the goose egg on his forehead. He couldn't help admiring her, wrong-headed as she was; or maybe it was because she was so wrong-headed that he admired her. He'd meant what he said when he told John that he'd chosen Mary, though it had made him so angry. People were never really keen on seeing own their true colours nailed to the mast.
"I trust this means that my obligation to you is at its end." The Under-Secretary stood ramrod straight; he looked a decade older than he had at the beginning of their journey. "I think my debt to you is well and truly paid, is it not?"
"I didn't."
John followed Mary into the kitchen and grasped the lasagna pan between two oven gloves.
"I guess."
"You can text Lestrade with your conclusions tomorrow. Right now I think you'd better get some sleep."
Or something.
"I can't. I can't. It's over, Mary." He took a deep breath. "You have to leave."
There was a strange expression in Sherlock's eyes. "Oh, John…." He let out a shuddering exhalation, then kissed John again.
"Nope," Sherlock said. "So much for Mycroft's grade four surveillance." He broke a piece of bread and buttered it.
Scarlett beamed up at him. “This is
John sighed. "Mary…."
The bell went off again, and the door began to slide shut. "Oh, dear," Sherlock said. "Guess not. 'Bye, Mycroft." John snorted laughter and put a hand to his mouth to stifle the sound.
"I know you can hear me, you stupid, self-centred arsehole
"Hm?"
, for Christ's sake!"
Tom breathed hard, pulling deep gulps of air into his mouth.
The reply came almost instantaneously.
After a few moments the noise subsided again, leaving only the headache in its wake. Sherlock opened his eyes and saw only blackness. He blinked and felt something soft over his eyes.
much time. Unless he wants to meet in the loo. I'm okay with that." He made as if to walk toward the bathroom.
"Don't care." Benedict closed his eyes again. He felt dampness between his shoulder blades. Was he sweating?
"I wouldn't count on that."
The blood surged in Sherlock's veins. He grinned, ran back upstairs, and began searching Tom's bedroom for the incriminating letters. He tore Tom's room apart – nothing, damn it. Back downstairs, to the much-used front room. Lots of mail stacked on a desk. Just one – ah! There, the one he'd showed Sherlock the other day. Same odours of dog and chicken tikka. Back downstairs to scoop up the little flowered carpet in front of the door and throw it in a bin bag along with the letter and the plastic container of tainted ice melt.
"Thanks," Sherlock said, and went upstairs, slower than usual.
"And you think this is going to be helpful in some way?"
"Yeah." Molly withdrew her hand and sniffled a little. "It's pointless, though."
"Hi, Sherlock. Is this a bad time?" Moriarty arched his eyebrows in exaggerated concern.
"Two."
He turned to exit the room, and a flash of movement caught his eye. "Wh –"
Sherlock nodded slowly. "John, have you ever felt…out of your depth?"
Benedict kept his eyes closed for a few seconds. "Martin," he mumbled, "that's not funny."
Mycroft took a glass. "Thank you." He sipped:  good. Brut, not that sickly sweet stuff. He drained the glass, set it on a table next to a cachepot of fragrant, fragile narcissi, and kept moving.
They both said it, enough to make up for all the times they hadn't.
his subconscious babbled), her forehead slightly furrowed, and her red lips parted as if she were about to speak. She looked almost normal, in fact, except for the raw red-brown wound encircling her neck.
After brushing his teeth, he stripped to his boxers and t-shirt and crawled into bed. He picked up the
Loo shook her head. "You selfish…oh, for God's sake, never mind," she said in a soft, marvelling voice. Climbing down from the worktop, she gathered up her handbag and marched to the door, then turned around and glared. "You know, if you didn't have time, you should have said so, instead of letting me toss you off and then shoving me out the door. What's got into you?"
Productively? What was productive about sex?
Sherlock pushed him into the wheelchair-accessible toilet stall and closed the door. "I need…I need…." He didn't know what he needed, exactly, but that didn't matter either. He sank to his knees and despite the havoc the alcohol was wreaking on his nervous system, unbuttoned and unzipped Marcroft's trousers with expert precision.
John peered at Sherlock, who had gone a bit pink. He'd never thought that Sherlock might have missed him. Their break had been so final. But at their last few meetings, Sherlock had been so….
"Fine. I'm fine. How's the new job?"
John's heart stuttered in his chest as Moran placed the bore of his weapon firmly against his head. Was Mary here? Or Sherlock? Maybe they'd gone already. He hoped so. He prayed that was the case.
Nora nodded, and tears welled in her eyes, spilling over easily. "I miss her too."
"To look at something. I'll be along in a moment." Moving deliberately, Sherlock went into the room where he and Lord Moran had held a brief and unilluminating conversation. He turned on a lamp and smiled as he saw the little inlaid table holding a cloth-covered object.
"I don't want it."
He still had fifteen minutes or so to go. He took out his phone and opened up the web. His last saved page was William Hill, but he didn't want to look at racing forms, even though that had always soothed the itch before. He considered texting Mycroft to tell him Sherlock was in hospital, but hell, Mycroft probably knew already, and there was no guarantee that he wouldn't shoot the messenger. Mycroft hadn't been especially pleasant to him the other day. John couldn't see Sherlock blaming him for their rift, much less telling Mycroft about it, but no doubt Mycroft drew his own conclusions, and John wasn't in the mood to set him straight.
John cocked an eyebrow. "You're sick of me, is that it?"
"That's not necessary," Sherlock said.
"If you get your schoolwork done on time this week, yes. I have a short shift on Thursday. Mind your manners and get your work done and you can see how the other half lives. Well, the other point-five percent." Mary folded a rucked-up woollen blanket. "Kiss your dad good night and brush your teeth. I'll be there in a bit."
Sherlock winked and turned away, beaming at the small crowd that had gathered.
John tried to keep himself from bucking forward like a kid, all untaught force and no control. He forced himself to stay still, but Sherlock was enclosing him, deep-throating, his muscles clenching and unclenching, and at last John couldn't keep still a moment longer. He thrust forward, fucking Sherlock's mouth, until he came in violent, racking shudders that left him exhausted. He sprawled on the sofa, trying to catch his breath and caress Sherlock's hair at the same time.
A reluctant smile stretched Sherlock's mouth. "He's not bad."
Sherlock shrugged helplessly. "Well…I'd still be here." He looked John full in the face. "It wouldn't change my utter adoration of you one iota."
Sherlock sighed inwardly. "That would be perfect. It's rather urgent, you see. Could we go somewhere private?" More people were gathering, and charm was becoming tedious already.
"That's quite something, isn't it?"
"You're a light sleeper, are you?" John asked, his tone considerably less kind than before.
“I don’t…honestly, darling, I don’t know what you mean.”
"I've never, ever,
John watched Benedict's face. "Right. Er…I think I'm going to go to my bedroom and have a kip. I didn't sleep fantastically well last night."
"Would it help if I said the case was personally important to me?"
"Thanks, Mum." Nora embraced Mary, then turned to John and hugged him fiercely. "Thanks, Daddy."
"Tried."
"You'll hear from me before 11:00. Pick up promptly."
"Thanks for the glowing compliment." Tom gave a wry laugh. "I feel…okay, actually. That is, I'm still upset and rattled, and I might talk to a therapist anyhow, but generally I'm doing okay. If you hadn't acted so quickly I might not even be here. I owe you a lot."
"So," John said, keeping an eye on the map on his mobile, "we're going to visit a stroke victim who's elderly, and who in all likelihood won't be able to speak or move."
-level attention. Spying on me. Watching me, listening in on my phone calls. And getting Big Brother to help you out. Every breath you take," he sang, off-key. "Every moooove you maaake…am I warm?"
"Wing4. Let's play connect the dots, Sherlock. Or rather, you play, I'll just sit here and wait." Moriarty glanced at his wristwatch. "You've got thirty seconds. After that I have John's brains blown in as his little girl watches. Start…now."
No. He thought not.
"Tom!"
His phone gave its generic text swoosh.
He got up, retrieved Sherlock's laptop from the desk, and booted it up. He left it on the sofa and went to hunt up a cup of tea and some toast. It was nine-thirty – dear God, he'd slept forever! – and Mycroft's car was due at noon, but he'd skipped dinner and was hungry. Sherlock didn't eat on cases, but in between he must have stoked up like a camel getting ready for a desert trek. He found tea, got the kettle on, and opened the fridge.
Tresler snorted. "Never is. Come in." She held the door open and ushered them inside.
"Oh, not at
Sherlock stretched. "You're becoming silly and sentimental in your old age. There are no ghosts."
"Merry Christmas…."
"I'll text you the address. Same number?"
"I'll navigate," John said, wrestling his phone from his pocket.
"Besides, most people strip before getting in the shower."
"Tell you everything later. Let's get you out of this. Is there a knife nearby, or –?" Sherlock looked round quickly. "Of course not. Hang on, let me go get one." He jumped up.
"Still…bit of a coincidence that it killed him tonight, don't you think?"
Sherlock, utterly stupefied, found his lips mashed against hers, and then she pushed her tongue into his mouth. She tasted of sugar and roses from the macaron. "Mff –"
"Yikes. You're not Parliament's brightest bulb, are you? You
John glanced over at Sherlock, who was still sleeping soundly. His mouth was slightly open, and John swore he saw a bright thread of saliva stretching from the corner of Sherlock's lips to the pillow.
"I'm sure you took wonderful care of him…Fiona." John smiled, nodded, and turned away. "Let's go," he muttered, and pushed through the doors of the Stroke Unit.
"So have I," Dr Roche replied. "There's nothing more wonderful, is there?"
John shrugged. "Oh, I don't know. It's a bit complicated." He focussed on Nora's eyes, dark hazel and alert. "Have you ever felt two ways about a person?"
"Yes, but this is a priority, along with the autopsy. Evidently Lady Howe was a non-practicing Jew, but her will stated that she wanted to be buried in accordance with Jewish law if possible. It's not entirely possible, obviously, but Mycroft doesn't want to delay any longer. He's become terribly shirty about her wishes. Bag this, please." He removed the lining from the dress and handed John the outer shell.
It was so,
"Yeah, probably not." John chuckled. "Anyway, it was a good time, thanks again. Mary was glad to see you as well."
"Anomaly." Benedict got up again and began pacing. "Anomaly. What the hell's that supposed to mean? I think you've got the wrong show, friend."
"Yes, I'm well aware."
John hesitated. "Yeah. Yeah, sure."
"She can call me."
"Eamonn didn't give a damn about art." Tresler seated herself on a sofa and crossed her legs. Her feet, shod in pointed alligator pumps, were exceedingly long and narrow, as if she'd worn restrictive shoes her entire life. "We met on a boat to Holyhead, in fact, in 1968. There was a music festival on Anglesey, and we were both headed there. A bit prosaic." She shrugged.
forfeited upon his conviction and imprisonment. Moran, oddly contented in his small cell, had even signed off on the piece, shrugging ("It's just a
Martha sighed a little. “Well…it’s just been an odd year, that’s all. I haven’t seen much of the boys recently.”
"Got the place in my sights," Farrow said. "No activity."
He didn't want to die. Life was too precious to let go. He had so much. He was terrified. But he wouldn't cower and plead, and even if he did, Moriarty wouldn't care. He looked Moriarty full in the face. "Is that what you wanted,
"Maybe. What do you – I mean, it's early days, but do you think you could stand having a kid around now and then?"
blissful, but often it was a silent, armed détente interspersed with uneasy truces. He'd never expected perfection; his own parents had done battle on a regular basis, and his principal model was unstable. Short tempers and recriminations seemed more frequent of late, though, and it bothered him. There didn't seem to be any solid reason for it. "You finish your breakfast and have a bath. If she's not up by the time you're dressed, you can wake her."
"Back in a flash."
," Benedict nearly shouted. "Don't bother with denials, there's no time. Get him out, get him to a safe house. Have someone you trust keep a close watch over him. Tell him…tell him it's just for a little while." Benedict paused for breath. That had to be enough for the moment. If he couldn't persuade Mycroft, he didn't know what he'd –
"What's the plan, Jim?" Sherlock asked. "I assume you've got one."
- that should do it. He pressed the text function.
"No, not this minute. But soon. If we do, we'll all need vaccinations, maybe visas – I'd like to move on it quickly."
Sherlock nodded resolutely and gathered up the rope. It was heavy and silken to the touch, and he weighed it briefly before taking up one section and fastening it to the brass rail of the bed. Hesitantly, he caught Tom's left hand and wound the rope snugly round his wrist, then made an efficient constrictor knot that Tom wouldn't be able to slip or twist out of no matter how hard he struggled.
"And yet I'm certain you have no issue with showing butchered corpses and other non-consensual acts of depravity," Mycroft said. He clasped his hands behind his back and strolled the length of the grey room. "I'm not prepared to share real or imagined intimate details of my family relationships with a complete stranger. Sorry," he said. "You're simply not privy."
"I saw it," Sherlock said. "It's very smart."
The memory of the last time, though – he hadn't been able to delete it entirely, the terror and nausea, the overwhelming sensation of suffocation.
"Oh, do you dare?" Sherlock mocked, but there was a twinkle in his eye. "You're certain you don't want to make it an hour?"
“You’re Sherl’s friend. You had that smashing yellow frock on at Mary’s wedding! I’m Janine,” she said, holding out a hand. “Janine Hawkins. What’s your name? Sorry, it was ages ago and I can’t remember.”
"And made me choose between two pills, one of which was poisoned."
"Great. You hungry?"
"Oh, God, what are you doing here?" Sherlock demanded.
On his way out of the hospital, Sherlock heard whispers and sudden excited, if swiftly strangled, cries. He saw phones aimed at him, and turned round to scowl at one of the intrusive photographers, but the blonde woman came up and tucked an arm in his. "Come on, love. We'll get you back to the hotel."
"Contained."
The doorbell rang, but he ignored it. Fucking paparazzi – was that even legal here? Fuck them.
John thumped onto the new sofa, concealed by a dust cover. "I have to keep an eye on the time. Have to fetch Nora at four." He grinned wryly. "You had to move us a million miles from Blackheath."
Back to work. He resumed his twisting and tugging, moving steadily and methodically. As he worked at the tape, he mentally calculated what it would take to notify each metropolitan police force in a Dedalus store city, and the likelihood of their rapid compliance. There were certainly some countries who'd be hostile to a warning coming from UK intelligence, but Mycroft would work something out. He'd be doubly willing once he discovered that Moriarty was responsible for Meredith Howe's death. Sherlock supposed he should say something consoling about that, and distract Mycroft from the fact that it was Mary who'd actually done the deed. Surely the attempt at an antidote would be a mitigating factor.
Sherlock's phone buzzed with a text.
"How are you feeling?"
Sherlock opened the bag and scooped up the wallet, tucking it in his jacket pocket. He was still wearing makeup and the filming costume, he realised; oh well, too late now. He leant back, a bit more relaxed, and began to scroll through Cumberbatch's text messages (no password protection – pathetic) to begin discerning patterns.
Violet sniffed. “You would think Mycroft would do something about this absurd scrutiny. Ridiculous. I’m going to have a word with him about it. And about making her room a bit nicer. All that grey and hard angles can’t be good for the psyche.”
"The whole thing, really. Do you suppose – do you think this happens a lot? It's not a completely foreign concept. I don't know if you know about this, but Plato, the philosopher, had this allegory or parable about a cave – there's a fire burning within this cave, you see, and there's a row of people bound to the wall, and all they can see are shadows –"
"Yeah. How'd you know?"
"Does he know that you're – that I'm…you know…not actually there?"
"You play well. Not brilliantly, but competently enough. Your fingering needs work, particularly your little finger." Moran held his glass out. "Could I trouble you for a refill?"
Sherlock shook John's hand. "I'll be in touch."
"Yes." Sherlock leapt up, more nimbly than yesterday as he'd bandaged his knee according to John's instructions, and went to the door. John was in a plaid shirt and jeans, and the smart wool coat. He'd hurried through his shaving – small dot of shaving cream near his ear – and smelled of the hotel's shampoo. "Afternoon, John. Feeling better?"
So there was no guarantee that going back to the set would necessarily improve matters; there were too many unknown variables. And he couldn't know with exactitude what Benedict Cumberbatch was doing at that moment.
But his head ached badly from the drugs Henry had forced on him, and his body still hurt from Henry's heavy feet. Grim reality denied him any comfort.
For one terrifying moment, Benedict thought he was going to faint. He reached for the back of a chair with a slow, groping motion and grasped it firmly. The hasty lunch he'd eaten in the car gave a tremendous lurch and he tasted acid in his throat.
Definitely. He'd definitely have the photographs, and the gratitude of the denizens of Buckingham Palace.
"Why was…why do you think he was attacked?"
"City Hotel," Mycroft said.
"There. Ah – ah…." John slid in, closing his eyes and exhaling a shuddering breath. "Fucking hell. Are you okay?"
He allowed himself to be dragged up, and let Tom lead the way upstairs to a bedroom nearly the size of the front room and kitchen of 221B combined. Tidy and a bit too sybaritic for his tastes, it was done in a profusion of soft greys and greens, with too much unnecessary and clearly unused furniture.
"I could eat something, I suppose."
"What you
John examined the letter, then the card. "Well, I'm not an expert, and that's a long time, but they look similar."
He tasted the second one again. Distinct salty taste. His mind leapt ahead to the possibilities: amitriptyline, captopril, gamma hydroxybutyric acid, griseofulvin, lithium, penicillamine, procarbazine, rifampin, vinblastine.
Cold terror raked his insides as he realised where they were.
Thank heavens. The mince pies wouldn’t go to waste after all.
"Hm?" Sherlock bagged another blond hair.
“He?”
Nora glanced questioningly at John, but John shook his head. "Thanks, Sherlock, but we're just knackered. Besides, our neighbour Mrs Pringle's made us enough food for an army. We'll never be able to eat it all." He smiled wanly. "Another time. Thanks all the same."
Sherlock was momentarily distracted by Tom's smile. How many
, and it didn't last. On average, mutual sexual obsession lasted six months, give or take a few weeks. Half a year of frantic scrabbling and swollen genitalia before the brain came to the rescue and saved the self from immolation. Murders committed in the throes of passion were boring, too, solved in a day, and when one came right down to it he didn't give a damn about Thomas W Hiddleston's aching heart or manly tears. It wasn't his world and he hadn't asked to be brought here.
He was predictable, true. He'd caught Sherlock glancing at him a bit smugly now and then; their banter had been almost relaxed. In some ways it was as if no time had elapsed at all.
The smell was overwhelming. He couldn't keep his feet. The bad knee buckled.
"It's true, I am really good at all that." Moriarty gave Benedict a modest smile. "But you, Sherlock – you're
"Okay. Okay." John took a deep breath and turned. He smoothed back a lock of Mary's hair. "You haven't got any other…never mind. It's okay." He'd spent nearly ten years in silence, and they'd managed remarkably well in that time. And if at times he was resentful, or uneasy, he'd kept his lip buttoned. He'd made her a promise, and he didn't break his promises lightly.
The orderly sauntered into the room. "Was that you, then, or was that him?"
"I'm glad he was there to look after you."
“Sherlock.”
"Please come in." She opened the door wider and gestured for Benedict and John to precede her. They went into the same sitting room – sparsely furnished and yet managing to convey an air of almost absurd luxury – and seated themselves on the sofa.
Perfect.
She leant back in the luxurious leather seat, listening to the discreet whine of the engines. Nice. She'd always appreciated travelling in style, never taking it for granted, remembering all too well riding hundreds of miles concealed in the boot of a car or in the lower hold of a filth-infested tanker. Needs must. No, this was infinitely preferable.
Steenie?
"What a shame," John said sardonically.
"Right, I wasn't sure. It got pretty weird here, though not much weirder than any other week, when I really think about it." John smiled.
"Aw, that's nice," Moriarty said. "Now put the gun down or Seb shatters his head. His skull's thick, but not
"Sure," John replied, bemused. "Where are we, anyhow?"
Beside Nora on the bed, her phone pinged with a text. John lunged for it and snatched it up. Unknown caller. He stuffed it in his pocket. "Now, darling." He kept his voice calm, though he followed the path of her eyes and saw them trained on his left hand – flexing, twitching. Shit. "Come on. Where's your overnight case?"
Sebastian Moran sighed impatiently. "Let's get this over with." He motioned the driver toward the rear of the house, then shoved John up the front walk, keeping his weapon at the back of John's neck. "No sudden movements now. Sure Mary's a crack shot, but like as not she's a wee bit skittish at the moment."
Anyhow, leaving all that aside, what was with Sherlock's snide dismissal of the letters? If he was such a bloody amazing detective, he should have sorted out the problem instead of suffering through a boring lunch. That was his
"And you told him to piss off, I hope."
"Nothing obvious. I thought it was a bit too neat that she was acquainted with…with Charles Magnussen, who was inordinately interested in information that I possessed – information that could only be obtained through you. You don't find that unusual? Bit of a
busy the past few days."
"Mycroft." Tom whistled softly, then his brow clouded.
"Stay long enough for a drink, at least," Tom said. He was glad to be taken out of himself for a moment. "I'll open this up."
people. "I'm fine," he repeated. "Thanks, though."
"Yeah. Yeah." John was grinning now. "Yeah, I think it's going to be okay."
There was a touch on his arm. He looked up.
“Thanks,” Greg said, and crossed the threshold into Mycroft’s palace of a house. Everything looked clean and waxed and perfect. He thought of his bachelor flat with some shame. “Came to return the Koen file.” He handed Mycroft a thick folder. “Thanks. It was helpful.”
come from Dr Watson's phone."
"I'm so sorry about this," Benedict said softly.
"Mind your shoe, it's come undone." Nina gave him another shy smile and darted away.
Tom found himself leaden-limbed, voiceless, and utterly unable to prevent Henry from mashing the stinking rag over his face. He sucked in fumes, choked, and tried to call out. He imagined his struggles knocking Henry to the floor – he was taller, and probably stronger, but he couldn't quite….
"Eventually, I hope."
"Thanks. Slaved all afternoon over it." John smiled.
"Fair cop." Moriarty thumped down into John's chair and stretched his legs out. "You look a little peaky. Everything okay?"
But it was there just the same, those undertones. God, the second series had even more snide in-jokes than the first – wait until the internet fiction fans got hold of the Hounds episode and the double room joke, they were going to run wild with that one. Of course they couldn't do more than make innuendoes – the viewership would plummet. And that was the bottom line, really – yes, it was the twenty-first century, it was stupid, and it was desperately unfair, but some middle-aged homophobe in Swindon would get his pants in a knot over a touch that seemed too affectionate and write letters and complain, and the hatred and vitriol would swamp, overwhelm, and eventually sink the show. It was easier to dismiss the delighted speculation of a smaller set of fans who saw what should have been obvious to the world – even if Sherlock Holmes and John Watson never had sex or even kissed, they were clearly, obviously, madly in love.
"Well, not ordinarily. Anna had an engagement this evening so she let everyone out early."
Benedict turned. John's face was strained; he looked tired too, as well he might; he'd done most of the talking to Lestrade, the officers, the pathologist as Benedict remained mostly silent. Oddly, Lestrade hadn't seem surprised that Benedict wasn't looking Irene's body up and down and crawling all over the lounge searching for clues. He had pulled John aside to speak to him quietly, and Benedict had heard John say, "No. Not possible. I've been with him the whole time." Good old John, probably getting him off a murder charge.
Benedict lowered the instrument and tapped the bow against his thigh. He exhaled, a deep, weary sigh that seemed to come from the tips of his toes. "I've been playing since I was six years old."
"Surgery," John said blankly. "I – oh. Yes. All right." Surgery was a nice word for what really took place, necessary and altruistic as organ and tissue donation was.
before placing the book back onto his shelf.
Though it was satisfying, in a sense, to receive confirmation of his suspicions, Sherlock was heartsick nonetheless. If only Mary had told him the truth the night they'd spoken. If only she'd trusted him. If only John had really listened to him – together, they could have helped her, protected Nora, for there was little doubt that Moriarty had threatened the child, and John as well – nothing was beneath him. If only he'd kept his mouth shut and sorted matters out before blundering ahead and assuming John would be willing to both listen and deal with the problem of Mary's return to her former profession. If only, if bloody only. "So what was it that Lady Howe did that merited a murder?"
"Not today. Not tomorrow, either." Too soon. It was all too soon.
"I said what the fuck are you staring at?"
"The sheep farmer?"
"That's the back of the dress, John."
"So he says." Benedict opened his tightly closed hand, and the little golden spheres beamed brilliantly anew. "I get one of these, you get one, and we maintain physical contact." Sherlock scowled. "We don't have to do anything but shake hands, Mycroft said."
"No," Mary said. "It's not."
Mary stared. "Sorry?"
"Bugger," John said. "What now?"
Ah. That was the source of the pain in his hands and shoulders. He tried to speak again. "Muh." His tongue was thick and wholly uncooperative.
He sent the message, then considered and sent another text.
"Did he do it?"
"That's right. And it's
Resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder, John sighed. "I know we've got lots to talk about, but…I can't right now. Mary, she's…not today, at least."
Kate reached out and stroked Irene's face. She felt tears threatening, but wouldn't allow them to fall. "Why won't you take me with you?"
"NEED MOAR John Watson walk."
"Hi." Sherlock gleamed at the desk receptionist. "You've probably got no idea who I am, but –"
"That sounds good. What about a five-thousand quid cap?"
– bit of overstatement there, Sherlock thought.
"Ooh." Tom sat up, flexing his arms and drawing his knees up. He smiled at Sherlock, then frowned, then looked almost comically concerned. "Love, did you –"
Does Sherlock like that?"
Sudden nausea rose in John's belly. "Well, she's probably asleep right now, and she'll be busy with Tim tomorrow. When I get back we'll call her together, all right?"
"Oh." Sherlock cleared his throat. "Thank you."
Benedict nodded. "He's fantastic."
Mary met his eyes. "She doesn't have any other family, John, and she's got lots of money."
An actor. On telly, on a show about the pair of them. It beggared belief. John had seen some pretty strange stuff as a doctor – his enthusiastic recounting of a soldier's mysteriously glowing teeth had been roundly scoffed at by Sherlock, who explained it as a result of excessive phosphorous intake from a spring near Kabul loaded with the stuff – perfectly commonplace, apparently – and even Sherlock couldn't explain it all (the zig-zagging lights in the sky in a rainbow of colour was met with a shrug of indifference) but this beat all. He wondered if Sherlock was busy trying to work out how to get back, or how it had happened. He couldn't imagine him just sitting back and accepting it.
Lady FitzSimmons clutched her handbag tighter and pushed past Sherlock, just close enough to – yes, perfect. She marched toward an unfussy black sedan. The driver waited beside the car – clearly a hired driver from a limousine service, judging from the plates and the lack of concern for his passenger's security. "He certainly wouldn't permit
Sherlock gave Mycroft a look of mock slack-jawed amazement. "Missing, not missing – your contacts aren't the most reliable, are they?"
"I'm fine, thanks."
It certainly wasn’t because he still felt a bit awkward around Sherlock – not entirely, at least, not altogether. He’d wholly and unquestionably forgiven him for…everything, and he hoped Sherlock had forgiven him as well. It wasn’t easy, though, to go back to the way things had been before. There was the house he lived in, bereft of his wife and Rosie’s mother. There were the new spaces of silence that had welled up between them, nothing like the silences they’d shared in the past – Sherlock cogitating, John waiting – sometimes contentedly, sometimes with imperfectly disguised impatience. These were heavy, uncomfortable silences, aching with suppressed words and feelings.
Cumberbatch's expression grew stormy. "Why?"
"February. Right after my birthday."
"That's okay." Despite their recent warmth, John couldn't help the small dart of relief at the news. A little break would be good – it would help him re-focus. "I haven't got anything on."
"Yay! When'll you bring him?"
"I'm very sorry." Guthrie got to his feet. "I wish I could help, but as I've said, it's confidential. I'll show you out. If there's ever anything else I can –"
Sherlock opened his eyes to see a crowd of people standing round him.
"No," John said, and exhaled again. "I didn't know it wasn't Sherlock I was talking to. I apologise. For that, and for hitting you. I'm sorry."
"'Bye, Nora. 'Bye, Dr Watson."
"Yeah, I –"
He glanced at TWH, who was sitting straight, staring out into traffic, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. "That went south rather quickly. The food wasn't spectacular, though, so I suppose it doesn't matter," Sherlock ventured, trying for some levity.
"He's awfully clingy," Sherlock hedged. "How do you stand it?"
"OH MY GOD!"
"You're a genius. Open a shop, I'll be your first customer. Do you mind if I share?" He offered the tin round at the girl's nod, and thanked her again. "I've got to run, but it was lovely talking with you. One more –? Okay." He posed obligingly, then climbed into the car and shut the door. "My goodness."
John shucked his jacket, then went immediately into the tiny loo to wash his face and hands. He felt grubby and vaguely malodorous, as if the dirt and miasma of Kerstin Tresler's flat had followed him out, clinging to his hair and skin and clothing. As he scrubbed his hands, he lifted his arm to his nose and sniffed the sleeve of his jumper. Fine; it was just his nasal passages suffering, in all likelihood.
"Sausage rolls and Jaffa cakes," Sherlock said.
Benedict laughed. "I'd always pegged him as being really careless about money."
Now he was lying on TWH's couch after yet another very dull stalker letter – it was telling that the writer had chosen to send the missive directly to Tom's rather than the agency, but not very interesting, and his initial excitement had long dimmed. God knew Sherlock had received a good deal of hate mail, some of it violent, and yes, once or twice the writers of those letters had tried to make good on their threats, but he'd always managed to outwit them, or John had been there to help out, and they'd never got the best of him. And those letters had been more imaginative than the deluge of written torture pornography in the two communiques he'd seen. This stalker with his cigarettes and his lonely habits wasn't worth a second thought, though obviously Sherlock had to make it seem as if he cared.
"Shit."
phone pinged with an email. He thumbed in the code and opened up the message.
Crimson-yellow streaks of agony and rage clawed up Sherlock's back, souvenirs of Moriarty, Moran, and Mycroft by proxy. His hand fumbled out and closed on the first thing it found, a covered tray of food, and flung it across the room, where it crashed against the wall. Milk and soup and bright red jelly splattered over pale blue. "Get out," Sherlock hissed. "Get out, get out."
Tom was on his knees, pulling something from under the bed:  a long, flat box covered in green and white toile. He lifted the lid and pulled out fistfuls of glossy black rope, then grinned up at Sherlock. "Just got these." He pulled a white silk scarf from the box and dropped it beside the ropes.
"No! Give up?"
John winced a little. "Well. Thanks all the same."
off sulking somewhere. He didn't seem like the sulking type, but to be fair he had seen the aftermath of what seemed to be some sort of assignation. Sherlock supposed that was a valid reason to sulk, if only for a short while. But it had been this afternoon – surely he wasn't
Mycroft shrugged. "Simple enough. Sherlock's phone has a GPS system. I'm glad you decided to take my advice and keep it," he said to Benedict. "And that Moriarty's henchmen were too foolish to remove it."
God, where had that come from? Well, he
"Probably," John said. "I'll be complaining about how the servants are giving me cold toast and not putting enough of a shine on my shoes in a few weeks." He smiled, but it was a reflexive motion, not reaching his eyes. "Sherlock, did you…."
"You're certain? I can take you home."
John pulled in a harsh breath through his nose, and his shoulders shook. "I should have listened to you. You tried to tell me about Mary, and I –"
It was almost three o'clock, a few hours until dinner at wherever they were eating. He'd forgotten. Well, it was as good a time as any to get the name of the place. He hoped that TWH's friends weren't Cumberbatch fans. He dialled Tom's number and waited one and a half rings.
"I could check on you a bit later. I'm afraid we don't allow food or drinks in here, but if you'd like to call down, I could arrange for –"
"Listen closely, because I'm only going to say this once." Irish accent, not Northern. Western. Galway, or thereabouts. "Go back to London. Stop messing around here. Go tonight."
"That's the one. We recovered a painting there that clearly had been in your home, an Ernst Wilhelm Nay. Degenerate artist, not extraordinarily well-known, but the piece was one of the works lost during the Second World War. Brown paper wrapping, steeped in Gauloise Brunes. I see you've tidied up a bit, good work, but I seem to recall some crumpled brown paper of the same type lying on the floor. You don't think it's a coincidence, do you?"
Reverently, he drew the cloth back, revealing the Nicolò Amati. He drew his fingertip across the satiny golden-russet maplewood and sighed softly. There was a silver bow next to the instrument, beautifully kept and of excellent quality if not nearly as staggering as the violin.
They sat in silence for some time. Sherlock seemed sleepy; his head bobbed forward once or twice, and his eyes were, as far as John could tell, unfocussed. Could have been the effect of the shot, or maybe Sherlock hadn't got much sleep the night before himself. It was oddly exciting to speculate that Sherlock might have spent the night thinking about him.
"There we are." He tore the sheet from the book and handed it to Enright, who stared at the inscription in utter bewilderment.
"Well, if you're not busy tomorrow, we'd love you to stop by for dinner. I'm cooking."
"Oh, Johnny. Come on." Moriarty reached behind him and withdrew a firearm in a plastic sack. "You don't think I'm
"Shh." Sherlock went out to the car and set the box onto the back seat, next to their bags. He got in and started the car. "Now. What?"
Sherlock felt the tape round his wrists give.
"Yeah, what – five? Turns out she had more in a Swiss account. And she had this friend – it's a long story, but this friend, colleague, left her all
But if Mary was guilty? What then?
"Acquaintances," Moran said. "Professional admiration."
Mycroft's headache intensified.
"Sherlock."
"That'd be great." He caressed her hand and got to his feet. "I'm going to wash up. I'll be back in a bit." He gave her another quick, reflexive smile, and fled to the loo.
"Partnership."
"He's…he's really fond of you, you know." Cumberbatch cleared his throat a little. "I thought all those fan fiction writers were projecting….it's built into the show, I know that, but it surprised me."
pyjama outfit, had climbed in without comment and leant back against the seat, closing his eyes for the duration of the drive. While he didn't feel physically exhausted, mentally and emotionally he was at the end of his tether, and he needed to regroup. John, sitting beside him, was blessedly quiet, and before Benedict had time to really rest, John was tapping his shoulder.
Sherlock's heart stuttered into double-time before settling.
"Fine," Sherlock said wearily, and glanced up at John, his cockeyed pupils making him look a little odd, sort of Bowie-esque. "You don't have to wait."
of fanfiction – you do know what fanfiction is, don't you? Piles of romantic, empty-headed drivel in which the two of us are endowed to a point of utter absurdity and shatter headboards on a routine basis whilst solving the most banal cases known to humankind, and I assure you, most of it is not fit to line the bottom of a birdcage – he is not interested in me, either romantically or sexually. I'm his
Sherlock shouldered his way past the hordes of disappointed losers and went into the ticket office, twinkling a smile at the harried-looking ticket agent. "Hi there." He pulled out Howe's phone and scrolled through the calls, feigning mild confusion. "I got a call from…let's see…this number." He showed the agent the phone briefly, covering the RECEIVED heading, and recited the number for good measure. "I'm not sure exactly…is it here? Did it come from this office? I've called it back, but I just got the answerphone and thought I'd…." He smiled again and shrugged, all charming helplessness.
"No."
"Every minute you sit on top of me and crush my ribs is a minute I lose working this mess out. Don't be an idiot, John." Benedict tried to remember everything Sherlock had said. Go to Brighton, call Lestrade – would Lestrade be at the Met on a Saturday evening? It was still Saturday, wasn't it?
Standing in his sock feet in a puddle of chilly, expensive water, he let the empty bottle drop to the floor and sighed. That had done it for his body, but not for his restless brain. Yanking Cumberbatch's phone out of his pocket, he glared at it for a moment and then texted TWH.
The door slid open, and there was Mycroft Holmes, leaning on his umbrella, his coat looped over the other arm, his countenance extremely displeased.
Moran stopped and gave another papery chuckle. "Of course I was. But not the way you think, you bloody fool." He stepped aside as the butler entered the room, a small but efficient handgun pointed at Sherlock's midsection. "And now, I think you had better leave. Melville will show you out."
"Yeah," Tom said wearily. "Look, don't mention that to anyone, okay?"
It was an out, even though it was probably a trap. "Not bad," Benedict allowed with a shrug.
Fee, eight thousand six hundred fifteen pounds. Public sale, purchaser disclosed. Another, Egon Schiele,
John looked puzzled at Sherlock's easy acceptance. "Do you? I don't –"
"Quite a number of connections between the pair of you," Sherlock said. "You were a ground-floor investor in Dedalus Communications and made out very nicely indeed when the IPO took off. There were a number of plundered art restorations connected with Lady Howe when Mr Dedalus emerged into the communications market. He's also an art collector, funnily enough. And you facilitated a number of nameless third-party guaranteed auctions, all high guarantees and high sales." Sherlock took his phone out and pulled up a spreadsheet. "None of your other confirmed clients have sales that match those extraordinary sums. So Mr Dedalus, a countryman of yours, ambiguous background, some years younger than yourself…tell me, Lord Moran. Would Nick Dedalus happen to be a relation?"
"For…." John groped, and got to his feet, pacing. He'd never been good at speeches, at talking about what lay in the corners of his heart. He forced the next words out. "For being an arsehole. I…I never wanted to stop being friends. Even if we didn't have, erm, anything else, we were always friends first. I could have done everything differently that day. I was selfish, and fucking stupid,
And there was no explanation for that, not to John – not one that would satisfy him. Benedict sighed a little. "She exploits people without remorse."
"Jesus," John sighed, and moved to the right, folding his arms and glaring.
Benedict grinned. "He's great, isn't he?"
The answer was long and overly complicated and was easily summed up in two words.
"But where are you going? Why won't you tell me?"
Sherlock turned a page in his book. "What gave you that idea?"
Violet brought Siger a mince pie. She had no idea how they were going to dispose of them all; she’d made enough for an army. The neighbours wouldn’t want any what with their own Christmas feasting. Maybe she could take them to Simon Rhodes’ farm; his goats might enjoy them. “What’s on?”
The message and John's name was in his handwriting; Mary and Nora had added their own signatures.
Vertue shook her head. "It's so late –"
"Yeah, no shit," she muttered, and sent a return text.
"Quite a lot, actually. Shall I show you?"
"Don't tell Mary. Not right away."
"Ah. There you are, then." Faintly unnerved, John returned to his meal, taking up a forkful of lo mein but not bringing it to his mouth. "Did she say anything else?"
Good job TWH was the accommodating sort of boyfriend. Sherlock didn't want to have to fend him off and create unnecessary suspicion. He'd felt Tom spooning him from behind and caressing his belly with a hand; more to the point, he'd felt Tom's sizeable erection against his arse and it was all he could do not to respond in kind. Last night's manual stimulation had been…well, stimulating. But distracting. Sherlock was glad Tom had left. He had work to do.
switched places, John would almost certainly notice at once. "I left something there."
“Mm. What was it about? Something naughty, I hope.” He slid his hand along her thigh, landing between her knees and slowly working his way up.
I'm okay, but it's just possible I might have a conc –"
She froze for half a second, an almost imperceptible reaction. Then she turned her head and smiled up at Mycroft. Shorter than average, she had a trick of imperiously tipping her chin upward and fixing her gaze even further up, as if other people were irritating and deliberate in their greater height. "Mycroft Holmes! My goodness. Here I've been inviting you to my parties for
Birds, at least, sounded prettier.
"No." Stephen retrieved the bottle and poured a triple. He drank. "You don't." Sebastian was right. Stephen had made a deal, after all.
"Yes," said a cold, sharp voice. A hand pulled the curtain aside. "For example, having the courtesy to answer my telephone calls."
"No, it's – I
"I'm going to ask you a question, Benny, and I want the truth now. That was you ringing me from the shop, wasn't it?"
"More art, ideally," Sherlock said. "The man who was here last night didn't realise anything was amiss. According to Mycroft's people, he didn't leave in a particular hurry, and he wasn't carrying any parcels."
. You abandoned everything to chase him, to close his operations down. Your work, your home, your family, such as it was and for whatever it was worth. Even your dearest friend, Sherlock, even John. Good Christ, couldn't you see what Moriarty did to you? He succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. He made you his puppet and fed on every self-destructive tendency that you possess in such lavish abundance. He separated you from everything you held dear, and I swore that despite your own efforts to the contrary I wouldn't stand by and allow that to happen again."
"Why?"
"Oh, come on. There's more to life than
Depending, of course, on what Mycroft had to say. If he'd expedited the DNA search…an entirely likely if thoroughly unpleasant possibility. Where the hell
Somehow, Benedict didn't think so.
"Can't." John shook his head. "Dunno, maybe I will when I go back down there. Couple of hours, who knows. Don't worry about me. I came up to see you. How are you feeling?" He made an abbreviated gesture and then pulled his hand back. "All that was so…erm, chaotic."
"Fine." Sherlock sighed and pocketed his phone. "Thank you again for coming with me." He peered closely at John. "You look tired."
said he'd miss John terribly, it was true.
Virtuosity.
Sherlock's phone pinged with a text. "Maybe that's him…." He thumbed the screen, and John sorted through the post on the side table, determined not to be too eager. Bills. Magazine subscription past-due notices:
"Good! I'm impressed, I admit it. Oh, look, Johnny-boy's stirring." Moriarty stopped moving and stared flatly down at John. "And that's just it, isn't it? That's why none of this is quite adding up." He swung his gaze back to Benedict. "You see?"
"No, that was
John; no wonder Sherlock did too.
"All right." He turned and walked through the library.
Sherlock showed her a photograph. "You don't know her?"
Molly picked up her glass and took a drink. “That’s good,” she said. “Absolutely. Lunch first.”
"Not if he wants me to work on the case. And he does." He smiled at John.
And he'd offered Sherlock a partnership. He felt sick. Both of them, together, oh Jesus Mary and Joseph, it would have been perfect symbiosis, but Johnny-boy, Captain Watson of the whatever Northumberland Fusiliers, Doctor Dull? No, and no. Jim didn't like triangles; there was inevitably, invariably, a lowest point to any triangle, and Jim had no intention of being a low point.
"And is that…is that what you're going to do to me?"
"If we switch back and it leaves a mark, I'll just say I was mugged. Which I was. Kidnapped, that is. By your brother." Cumberbatch lunged forward and grabbed Sherlock's hand. "I had the thought that if we were physically connected when the thing happens again –"
"Sort of," Sherlock admitted.
Molly gaped at him for a moment, then her complexion brightened. "Yeah – yes, definitely! Er – I've got a bottle of red in the fridge, and there's a good pizza takeaway near my flat."
She tightened her grip on her Glock and prepared to shoot.
"Her first husband was in oil. Died youngish, left her everything."
"Of course, your father's more than capable of taking care of himself. I've lost count of the number of times that he's kept me out of danger as well."
"I'm afraid I've lost my appetite," Mycroft said. Two hectic splashes of pink still stained his cheeks. "I'm not feeling well."
She'd replied within two minutes.
"You're a sick fuck," John said. He was standing behind his chair, and Benedict saw his hands curling into fists.
A blazing-hot flush crept up Sherlock's neck. "Naturally. He accompanied me home after my injection."
All he had to do was wait.
Tom's face was irritating in its obvious compassion. "Have you ever asked him?"
"Not yet," Lord Moran said.
"Yeah. Lovely guy." Cumberbatch's voice dripped sarcasm. "The point is, he knows, and he's working on the problem." He hesitated. "You two…."
John shook his head. "How soon is too soon? A month, a year, what?" He swiped at his eyes. "It's just…none of this happened the way I thought it would."
God help Cumberbatch if his stupidity led to John getting hurt. And God help him if –
"Well, I'm not, not really. Sometimes it's convenient though." Moriarty tapped his fingers on the chair. "It really is a special occasion."
! The protective vibe. I dig it." He leant forward. "
Sherlock blinked hard and let out another moan. He focussed on Henry's chin and wet his lips.
---Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five
An idea sprang half-formed into the forefront of Sherlock's mind and he clasped his hands together hard under the table to keep from blurting it out. "I imagine you've picked out a place to live already."
"What, Mycroft? I was sleeping."
"Not bad," Sherlock mumbled around a mouthful of food. It was certainly more interesting than Tom's friends, all of whom had made twittering respectful noises at Sherlock, but that hadn't done much to disguise varying degrees of negative emotion.
Nora swallowed exaggeratedly and took a drink. "Pike position," she said, enunciating clearly, as if John had never heard the words before.
"I'm qualified to speak to my own daughter."
"And this is the first one that's been delivered directly to your house."
white, but that was to be expected after an electrical shock and the nastiest prank anyone had ever pulled on him. He moved closer to the mirror.
Sherlock picked up the cable tie and stared at the man. The forceps were almost directly behind him.
"Any evidence of stress around the date of the murder?" Sherlock sniffed again.
Totally worth it, in Sherlock's opinion.
He did his stretches, then began a slow jog down the street. He'd do three, four miles and then just cab the rest of the way home.
Later, when he'd had a bit of time and space to think, John reflected that although he'd always admired Sherlock's unconscious grace, there was another truth heretofore undiscovered, and that was that Sherlock, unconscious, was anything but graceful.
Tom shook his head, waved his hand, and turned on his heel, leaving the loo without a word, leaving Mark and Sherlock alone.
Little pieces of memory began to click together, like a Lego set. It had been Sherlock and John for the longest time, hadn’t it? But she’d been too wrapped up in her own pointless misery to see it.
Benedict sat back to wait.
Sherlock sat on the sofa again. "Now look at the next message."
"What bothers you so much about this, John?" Mary took a step closer, her hands knotted, mirroring John's. "They're just
"You gave us all a hell of a scare, you know."
"I expect you to fully cooperate with Dr Paisley and her team. A good many taxpayer pounds went toward retrieving you. And I want to hear whatever you fail to impart to her."
"No! Where?" Mary took a bite of her chicken. "Oh, that's good."
"Ben, wait."
Mary grasped his hand and smiled. "I know. I know it is."
An unknown number. Mycroft frowned. Probably a mistake, some drunken twit. He blocked the number and set the phone down. Sipping at his drink (a 35 year Glengoyne single malt, a gift from Mr Trudeau who knew better than to send blended Canadian swill), he gazed into the fire and listened to the heartbreaking beauty of the countertenor singing Handel’s opus.
“Fuck,” he groaned. He set the phone down and turned out the light. Belatedly, he remembered he hadn’t found the star for the tree.
Always something.
It was past time for lunch, but John wasn't hungry, and he couldn't bring himself to go out and speak to Ben, nice as he seemed to be. Though who the fuck was he to give love advice? He didn't know John at all, and he
"Ben…."
"It's fine," John said, unsure if she'd heard. He'd only been filthy rich for a few weeks; he had no intention of turning into one of those snarly bastards who berated the help about every little inconvenience that fell across their path. Though it was amazing, he marvelled, how gently cushioned his life had become in such a short time.
He was glad now he hadn't updated the phone or got rid of the pictures.
"Yeah?"
, Mr. Cumberbatch!" The female voice on the other end of the phone had dropped a half octave into a register the owner no doubt found seductive. "What can I do for you?"
Jim slipped his phone into the pocket of his jeans. "Sherlock, you tattle-tale."
"Well, well, well. If it isn't Mikey Holmes." Behind an expanse of thick Plexiglas, James Moriarty lounged negligently on his cot, swinging his leg back and forth, back and forth. His voice issued through a speaker set into the wall. "Nice of you to come and see me. I've been sort of lonely."
Obligingly, Nora pressed her hands to John's ears. "Better?"
"Why do you think she tried to call you on the evening of her death?"
John waited until he had gone, then turned to his daughter. "Just sit here and watch telly, love. I'll try not to take too long."
Suddenly he wondered if Henry had raped his female victims. He thought of Katie, missing for so long, her parents bewildered, then frantic, then finally grieving, and whoever the young female fan had been. Oh, Christ almighty, poor little girl. Had Henry brutalised her? Would he assault Tom and Ben too? Desperately, he threw a wild glance toward the road.
Wet-eyed, John frowned. "What?"
"I love how your bad knee is suddenly my fault," John said, though he sounded far from upset. "It's not as if I took a mallet to it. Face it, Sherlock, you're just getting –"
A long sigh filtered through his nose.
"Oh, Jesus," Tom moaned, recognising the voice. "Henry. Henry!" There was no answer, but Tom heard cupboards yanked open and slammed closed, and solid, angry footfalls, and a counterpoint of low, furious muttering. "Henry!
And Sherlock wasn't even a nice guy, but John was in love with him – that much was obvious, even given the hysterical denial – as was Molly, and Irene had certainly seemed fascinated with him, though that might have been a physical thing – let's do painful and lovely things to Sherlock's dick. None of them even understood him. Jim did.
"Who cares?" Sherlock turned the light onto the autumn-green lining. "Once you're dead, you don't have to worry about it. All that fuss is for the people left behind, anyhow. Let them take care of it."
"More wine, Ben?" Mark said, proffering a bottle.
"Seb Moran – did you already know about him?"
On the drive into the city, Sherlock filled John in on most of the details he hadn't mentioned the other day. "Mycroft has some personal connection to the case, which explains his insistence. Evidently Lady Howe named him her executor, which leads me to believe he was probably holding something over her head."
