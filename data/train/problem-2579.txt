Sam tapped the edge of the tablet in his hand and said, “It’s a case. At least I think it is. Cas thinks so too.”
“Oh, I left my wallet upstairs though.” My hands were under the drape, and they were sweaty. I started wiping them off on my pants.
Castiel clicked on the next link. He let it play to the end. Jo Harvelle. He liked her. He had spent some time with her at a past social event, drinking a bit too much. She could sure hold her liquor though, and he had struggled to keep up with her. He didn’t want to work with her though. He just wanted to keep doing the friend thing. Forming up a band with her would effectively end that.
Still, she invited him in. “Fine, come in.” She waved a hand at the table for him to join her. Usually, he’d expect food and maybe a little drink. Then she could send him off.
Dean was practically on autopilot as they drove back to Castiel's home. They got to the gate and stopped. “Is there a number I need to punch in?”
“This is odd. I suppose everyone has their kinks.” She leaned in and kissed him. Cas didn’t fight her. He didn’t quite know what to do. After all, he was asking for a lot, and their intimacy would be much more than this if she said yes. “Yes,” she whispered as she ended the kiss.
The others would soon know that she was with child, if they didn't know already. As the departure day drew near, without a hint whatsoever, the old gods made it impossible for them to leave. They separated them, sending him away while keeping her secure in the penthouse.
Dean undressed and got into bed the moment they got into the room. He’d grown quiet. Cas took a seat at the motel table next to the window. “Cas?”
There's a little angst in this chapter, but some resolution for that angst too. Love to you all and thanks for all of the support.
Castiel dropped the condoms and lube onto the bed. Dean sat up on the edge and faced Cas. He reached out and put his hands on Cas’ hip pulling him closer. Dean nuzzled in, peppering Cas’ stomach with ticklish kisses. The goal was there bobbing away, untouched. Dean looked up at him past thick lashes with eyes that Cas couldn't look away from. Dean's smile was at first sweet and maybe a little innocent, and then it wasn't.
Dean had thought about that. He wanted to win, but at the same time he was rooting for Cas. He wanted to be able to celebrate with him afterwards too. It had been implied that they would. Dean's place made sense as it was near everything, but Cas hadn't stayed overnight there yet.
Was it always this nerve wracking? Twenty-four hours is actually a hell of a lot of time to pass. Luckily I had work.The pub was busy with all the usual locals, and the next morning was going to be spent at the shop. It still felt like I was only half focused. I kept wondering if he’d take me seriously and wear the kilt. I’d likely die. We didn’t have to go out. Alex was going to be at Jody’s until Wednesday.
Dean tried to remember any particular dream. Though he couldn’t remember anything specific, he was sure that it had not been PG. Dreams featuring Cas rarely were. “How was that informative.”
“What city are you in today?” It was the same question her asked every time. He knew Cas was in San Francisco, but he asked anyway.
“I, uh, yeah.” Castiel pushed the button to open the gate. He walked past the large mirror in the hall and gave himself a quick once over. “Shit. I look like shit.” He tried to fix his hair, which was a messy mop of unstyled glory. He gave up and stalked toward the door. He decided to meet Dean on the porch, question his life choices, then retreat back into the sanctity of his home, maybe with Dean’s coffee.
Dean delivered the next line over the note Castiel was holding, blending with him like they'd planned this. “I should have known you'd take the out…” And now Dean's voice shook a little. He didn't hold the note. He knew this was about him now. Castiel had rejected him all those years ago, but it wasn't rejection, if this song was to be believed. It was a choice that Castiel had given him.
At this point, Kevin came to the piano and took Dean's spot. He kept playing like there had been no interruption. Dean walked to Cas who was already delivering the beginning of the last verses. They were going to sing them together. Cas was looking at him; worry was in his eyes. They hadn't planned for Dean to come to him. It was getting intimate.
They all laughed at him and at the situation. “I'm not even sure what to do with all of it,” Castiel admitted.
Cas hummed and walked over to him. He too dragged his hand over the fabric that made up Dean’s sacred clothes. “You still like cowboys.” It wasn’t really a question.
Castiel watched him play the guitar like the master he was. The black Fender was perfectly poised in his lap. His long fingers gliding over the strings with a speed that was otherworldly. He didn’t sing. Castiel held his breath. He knew Dean. He knew his style and skill. He knew more than that, shamelessly following the career of the Winchester band over the years. The inevitable break up of that band was a different kind of tragedy from his own.
“So say we all!” Dean snagged the bottle from Sam and tipped back a gulp. It burned all the way down. “What the hell are you two drinking? My God!”
“Yeah.” Dean wondered when he'd become so mesmerized by hands, just hands with gloriously long fingers that conjured music like they were made for nothing else. Cas had so many other attributes on which to focus, but here he was staring at his hands and getting just a little hard.
“Yeah, you said that.” Dean set down the glass on the kitchen counter and moved toward the hall. “Well, good getting caught up with you. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.”
“Oh.” Cas picked up Dean's hand and kissed the back of his fingers. Then he just held Dean's hand there a moment in both of his breathing over Dean's knuckles. “You're stunning, and sex with you was spectacular.”
“Don't be like that Dean. We're fine,” Sam said. He passed the flask to Dean. “Take the edge off Grandpa.”
Strangely enough, opening the portal and retrieving Gabriel's body was easy. Easy didn't equal pleasant though. The vessel had gone through months of decomposition. Rowena, along with her coven, worked a spell to encase the body and keep it from tainting the air in the bunker anymore than it had initially.
“And I just wanted to be left alone.” She held the ax on top of her two upraised palms and whispered a spell that sent it soaring to the neck of the timid vampire. He was dust in an instant. She cast her focus about. There were still two creatures in the woods. The one behind her house wasn’t coming through. She worried about that one. She picked up her ax and headed for the woods.
Dean turned back to him. He walked right up into his space. “Take off your coat.” Cas didn’t know what this was about, but he complied. “We’re gonna spar a little.” Dean laughed for seemingly no good reason. “You wouldn’t want me going off all half cocked or anything would you? Wouldn’t want me feeling all tense and reckless?”
“Dean!” Sam called over. “Ruby and I are going to go listen to Fallen.” Sam was waving toward the distant stage. Thankfully they didn't have to make their way through any of the crowds. Their were paths set out for the celebrity guests. Occasionally, they'd be stopped for some Q and A's, but then they could move on.
last year when they sent a guy to my gate. He was climbing all over my fences to take pictures of my yard.
“Well, guess the kids didn’t exhaust me as much tonight.” She waved him back in. “Took the boys to that gym room. Jack eventually came with Rebekah.” She smiled and added, “You can thank us later for the peace and quiet we gave you for most of the day.”
Dean was leaning against the building, waiting for him like he had all the time in the world. The sun would be coming up soon. Dean walked very close to him. Cas glanced at him every couple of steps to see if he was okay.
“Are we close enough for me to say, I don't want to talk about it right now?” Castiel turned a little so he wouldn't have to face her.
Dean accepted that as he turned off the lights and breathed in Cas, all close and damn near perfect in his arms.
“But I can't tell anyone that I'm with you. I can't hold your hand in public, kiss you on a whim. I've got no hope for a future with you.” He looked like he'd cry.
He glared at her and held out his crucifix, a fine golden one that hung from his neck on a long golden chain. “It tells me that you are being allowed to test me. Depart, devil woman, vile temptress.”
“So, you’re saying we might need to get dinner to talk about how to deal with the kids at Christmas.” He paused a second and tipped his head, and added, “Like a date?”
"It feels cruel. He did this to her before he was tortured. It feels much more wrong because of that. Why would he do that to her?"
The house was more than a house. It was located at the dead center of Main St. Cas had been occupying a room upstairs nearly since their arrival. The place was a bed and breakfast, but it served more than breakfast. The downstairs had a sitting room where guests could play cards and other board games. Along the walls one could find a number of old cloth-bound books on dark wooden shelves. The room at the front of the building was large and looked out onto the Main St. The room was full of linen-covered tables and floral centerpieces. They served meals in this room throughout the day.
He got to the top of the stairs and headed down the narrow hall to the room where Cas slept. He gave the door a little knock as if Cas were awake to hear it. He pushed the door open and made his way to the bed. Cas looked peaceful. His mouth was a thin line, lips slightly parted to let in air.
Dean lifted Cas’ hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles. “Absolutely.” Then he turned to the door, Cas’ hand in his and stepped out into the world, free and eager for what was to come.
“Cute.” He stood out of the lean. “That usually work for you, that cocky little smirk. Bet you get all the ladies dropping to their knees for that look.”
“Fool.” Kali did not stop him though. Dean began firing at another nearby form. The creature shivered and seemed to shrink in on itself. The Colt may not have the ability to kill the being, but it did seem to be weakening it. Kali took Deimos and Phobos’ hands and said, “Time to bring our power together and finish this, before your father and that human really hurt themselves.” The boys nodded. The three of them took aim at a central figure and sent a strong blast of red fire at it. There was a scream that came from it, ear piercing and final. All of the shapes took on human form and fell. Red, like blood, filled the space, covering all the beings within the orb. It looked eerily like the images that the boys had shared not long after they had first arrived.
“You saw the articles. This is our sort of thing. Just because Silas didn’t think we should doesn’t mean a thing. We always do things that seem crazy to other people.”
“Tomorrow, or maybe the next day. It can wait.” Dean rolled his hips a little against the tight press of Cas.
And because I was a little shit, who didn't know what’s good for him, I said, “If it’s not too cold, maybe that kilt.” I winked again. Still got it. And then I went out the door.
"I thought that I was doing the right thing. You two playing your parts was said to be a thing that would restore balance in the world. So, I meddled like a good son."
“Funny thing, they seem to miss you. I tried to move them to my room to sleep, and they did not want that one bit. I brought them back to your room and they were fine. Don’t be surprised when you find Claire, Jack, and I all over your space when you get home.”
Then he met Dean, and he began to want time to explore feelings that he felt bubbling away in his chest. He had Dean's number.
“He didn’t. He did the best he could with what the universe gave to him. I sometimes think that he stopped being himself after mom died. He use to be soft, and kind to us when we were young. Or maybe I just don’t remember. If the universe conspired to bring him and mom together, maybe it also changed him so that I’d change and Sam would change. You know, cosmic manipulations times ten.”
“Guess you were starving huh?” Dean smirked. He poked Cas in the belly. “You’re gonna love these.” Cas took up residence at one of the counter stools and watched Dean work. He could have offered help, but he knew Dean wanted to do this. He’d been talking about it for weeks now.
“I don’t gotta do anything. It’s not in my contract that I have to work with some random person you decide to throw at me.”
“You don’t want to go back to the cemetery then?” Cas’ brow kicked up like he knew good and well what Dean wanted, but he was enjoying the torment.
“Thanks,” he smiled and picked up the edges of said shirt. “Another gift from my son. He has unusual taste. I have to wear each item at least once to validate his gift.”
Dean tensed when Cas fingers moved between Dean's legs. “I'll go slow,” Castiel whispered into Dean's ear. “If you don't like it, just tell me. There's plenty we can still do.”
She squeezed his hand. “I’m an incompetent mother, Dean.” Dean started to interrupt her again, but Mary continued, “And as far as guilt goes, you can’t alleviate that for me. I just have to figure that shit out for myself. When I do that, maybe I won’t feel so empty.”
Castiel walked past Dean into the living room. All of the shades were drawn, except for the one in the corner. The view of the high buildings and the distant street below would have been a selling point to most. Dean didn't like heights though, and he almost chose a less convenient location that was closer to ground level. Bobby was convincing, and now Dean lived in a place that gave him vertigo when he stepped too close to the windows.
“Maybe.” Dean wedged his bottle into the sand and started taking off his shoes. “I got my beer. Maybe I should actually get my toes sandy.”
They got 23 cities in a row after that. The tour seemed to be never ending. Somehow Bobby got Dean's guitar sent out to him before they performed in Vegas. It felt weird to play it, like it was something that wasn't his.
“You haven’t beaten him yet?” Dean considered the possible moves for each of them and saw that Sam was not gonna win this round either. It was odd. He’d played chess with Sam and countless other thinking games. Sam won quite often. He had a tactical bent when it came to certain things.
Dean woke up to an empty bed and the smell of motel coffee brewing into a tiny carafe. “You trying to wake me up, Cas?”
“Not sure. I think we just do what we've been doing, minus the sex.” Castiel got up and stood in his path. “Will that work for you?”
He glanced into the next room where Kelly had been painting a mural for her child. There was a large tarp on the floor to catch the paint.
“Still Father Thomas, but I’m not as I was.” He winked and gave her a grin that showed long fangs in his mouth. “I’m going to enjoy ending you.”
“Yes, and even smaller spaces than the whole planet. The bunker, the back seat of the Impala, the kitchen in the bunker even. I’ve come to appreciate the intimacy of small spaces, the joy that they can bring.” Cas glanced at Dean then back down at his hands. “The people too. They, you, make it better here.” He glanced at Dean again. Color rose into Dean’s cheeks.
Cas’ hand slid across the table and settled over Dean’s.  He gave Dean’s hand a little squeeze. “Perhaps. It would be acceptable for you to ask though, whenever you finally felt like you could.”
Cas leaned down and kissed him quick. Dean wrapped his arms around him, and they moved together, slow like they had all the time in the world. The smell of the Impala’s leather filled Cas’ nose. The warmth of Dean beneath him was everything he wanted. Dean’s mouth was open as their hips rolled together quicker now than before. And words were tumbling out of him as Dean’s thrusts became more frantic. “Cas, Cas, Cas.” There was no mistaking the words Dean had said. He didn’t open his eyes.
“I believe that it will not be sunny at all. They’ve been getting some rather intense snow storms in that region for weeks now.” Cas took him too seriously for the millionth time. Dean pushed down the little laugh that was just about to run free.
"Except Dr. Tran," Gabriel interjected. "All of the information that you've received here is classified."
A week passed before she encountered another supernatural creature. This time it was a werewolf. He too was looking for an angel. It was different this time. He didn’t threaten her or even seem interested in her until he sensed her power. “You’re a witch.” He said it in a matter of fact tone.
“I don't know. It tastes better than usual. Why don’t you use cream and sugar?” Cas took another long sip and seemed happy with it.
Going into the room was some kind of joy. Never was a room more tailor made for Dean’s tastes. Sure he’d take some ribbing from Sam, but Dean wasn’t about to let him rain on his joy parade. This was great. This was fucking awesome. There was even a damn bison head on the wall. He gave it a boop. He turned to the rest of them and popped a little dirty thought Cas’ way as he grinned ear to ear. Cas just smiled right back.
“He’s dead,” Kali said, still looking at Gabriel’s body. “This was your father, boys.” She looked back at them. They moved to her side and looked down at him.
It wasn’t clear who leaned in first, but it was clear that Sam and now Jack too, had the worst timing in the world. Jack’s words rolled down the halls to them. “We’re back!” He was heading their way.
Castiel wrapped up the chorus with, “I should have given you a better route. I should have made you see the way. You were deep inside of me. I still crave the weight of you in my arms.” Castiel turned, and sang the last lines facing Dean, whose arms still held him. “Let me again claim your perfect sin, carve your name again into my skin.”
Dean wasn’t sure that his body would be able to handle the sharp change. He was shivering now more than he had been outside. “God, how cold is it out there?”
The boys hugged her. She looked over their heads to the others in the room. Her eyes held fire and death and so many assorted horrors. Sam chose to speak. “This was the first time they were able to get through to you. I believe they’ve been trying for a long time now.”
“Yeah, that.” Castiel began finishing up the last of the sandwiches. The soup still had a ways to go before it was warm enough. “So, it was awkward. I felt like an ass. I wrote ‘Crushed’ then, because I felt like I was hurting people left and right. It wasn't about hurting just her though. You were in my head then too.”
“Dude’s been gone for weeks. Damn right you lead with that.” Dean stalked past him. “Next thing you know, you’ll be telling me that mom moved back in.”
So, instead of acknowledging what he didn’t know or understand and what he did know and understand, Dean was going with actual avoidance as a plan of action. Cas still spent a fair amount of time in Dean’s room. He also spent time on the laptop researching or pretending to research. Dean wasn’t sure. Dean figured that when he was ready, Cas would talk.
Cas laughed and said, “You're in my neighborhood.” Then Cas rattled off an address that Dean had to jot down. “So I'll see you in minutes.”
Rowena wasn’t like other women. She was clever, but plenty of women were clever. She was beautiful, and that too was a trait shared by many. She was powerful, and that was not so common at this time and in this place. Her father had been a tanner, and when he had died leaving no direct male heir, the land and the house should have been claimed by some male cousin or very distant family member.
“I took care of all of that last night. It’s in the back seat. The bottles have water in them, and when we need them, we just have to mix in the formula.”
“I mean...” Castiel set the glass down and raked his hands through his hair. In any other circumstance Dean would have appreciated the mess, maybe even indulged in open staring. Now though, he just felt irritated. “I mean we have to work together.”
“Shoulda guessed, Utah.” They drove back to the motel and went to their room. They had hours to kill, and still so much shit to fix. Cas saw no way that any of that would be dealt with. He considered leaving. Staying wasn’t helping anyone.
“Only when speaking the truth,” Dean answered with a grin. “Sam ended up being the best of us. He started writing songs and playing things. One day he was playing an early version of ‘Pamela Barnes’, and Bobby heard it. Now Pam was a good friend, another one of Bobby's friends with benefits.”
She walked the path from her home, past the pasture full of wooly sheep, toward the trees. In them she’d find the tools of her trade, plants and tree bark, key items for spells. She waved her arms out at her sides, the sun high in the sky warming her bare arms. She stepped off the path into the woods. She stooped and plucked up a couple of mushrooms from the base of a tree that stood tall in a slight clearing. The mushrooms would go into tonight’s soup.
Dean looked away. He could feel the heat flooding his cheeks. “That's just performance. It's a persona.”
Dean woke up from the deepest sleep he’d gotten in some time. Things were okay, not good, but okay. At least no one was riding shotgun in his meatsuit anymore. That had been dumb. Jack survived, so there was that. And all things considered, it really could have been worse. More were saved than lost, so it was kind of a win. And until last night sleep had been hard to come by.
Sam interrupted his thoughts. “No one said we had to go back.” He paused a moment, then added, “I’m going back, but you have options.”
“Finish eating your burger, and I’ll take you to your damn telescope.” Dean rolled his eyes. “You do know that we have a telescope back at the bunker?”
“Pretty sure Jack thinks that too. It was a Father's Day present.” Inexplicably, Cas seemed to move closer. Yeah, fuck personal space. He leaned into my ear and said, “Can you believe some people don’t wear anything under them?”
By his count Cas wouldn't be home for another three days. They'd been texting nearly every night, most days too. Cas told him about how his band came together, his upbringing, his feelings on everything from bees to guinea pigs.
“Everyone is very much on board.” Cas waited though for Dean to be clear as he could be. Consent mattered to him, even if there was this roundabout way toward intimacy going on between them.
They each just stood there, Castiel staring straight into Dean's eyes. Dean felt his heart stutter. The silence went on too long.
“Not the point. I just want to be alone.” Castiel was about to close the laptop. He could leave. He didn’t have to stay for this. Sure he had a contract, and Crowley would hold him to the letter of it: three more studio albums and two tours. It was too much to even think about. At least he had time. There were no time constraints at all in the contract. He could drag this out until after his first hip replacement, he reckoned.
“Yeah.” Sam smiled and looked a little like he'd float off into the clouds. “Her name's Eileen, and I want you two to meet her.”
Dean slipped away from the heater to go find Cas. It hadn’t been long, but so what. He heard his voice before he saw him. “The band needs the break. You gotta give us some down time.”
“Really?” Dean felt skeptical. “How do you know?” He leaned against the wall across from the door. Meg joined him.
“I shall, but only because the book that I seek is no longer here.” She turned from him. As she passed through his door, she said, “Good day to you, Father Matthew.”
“We should stop.” Dean's heart stuttered in his chest. “We should talk about whether or not things have changed, if this,” Castiel waved his hand between them, “could be okay.” He sucked in a breath and then added, “But I don't want to do that right now. All I want is to feel you, taste you, fuck you into my mattress.”
“She wasn't you.” And that admission wasn't intended, but it was truth. “Dark hair, witty, kind, still not what I wanted at the time. Guess we both rebounded.”
He pulled off Dean's pants, leaving him naked and beautiful. He got off the bed and removed the last of his own clothes next. His nightstand was right there, but all he wanted to do was just stare at Dean, drink in all of the miracle that was him in this bed. Dean rolled onto his side and stared right back.
“No. In fact, I don’t think I’m even close. I figured I’d come home and see what I could do here instead.”
Dean looked away and said, “When we get back,” he swallowed then continued, “I’d like you to stay.” He ate another bite, then another. “At least while the babies are there. I could really use the help.” He glanced back at Cas.
Becky interrupted, “Oh, and don’t I know it. I was so excited to see you guys paired up with so many other talented bands. It’s high time Sam gets recognition on the festival circuit for his amazing voice.” She was practically swooning. Dean wondered how she survived getting to talk with him all up close.
Dean was up late, working on the end of one of Sam's songs when his phone pinged. They were in some middle-of-America motel, and the Magic Fingers were calling him. There were flash flood warnings keeping them from traveling to an actual city, thus the less than ideal digs.
“Five years of plugging away before anything really stuck, but yeah. I think Sam and I decided early on that this thing had to work. We owed it to Bobby.”
Cas opened his eyes. He gave Dean a small wave and took a step back. He swiftly turned away from Dean and moved into the crowds that were making their way to their seats. Dean didn't cry. He couldn't. One tear would unleash the rest and he just couldn't let himself fall apart like that.
“I’ve no intention of coming back. I can also spread the rumor that you’ve met with an untimely death.”
There was another knock at the door. This time the rest of Fallen along with Michael stood on the other side. Cas ushered them in. “We having a party in here?” Uriel asked.
Cas scrubbed his fist over his eyes, wiping the sleep away. “It's 10:30, Dean. You only left an hour ago.”
“You weren't there. You don't know how I was. I drove them to exhaustion. It's the reason that they kicked me out of the band just before the accident. If I'd have been kinder, less selfish, maybe they'd be alive today. I always thought I knew what was best, how to love, how to deal. I was wrong about so many things.”
“Rowena,” Sam started. Then quietly he said, “You know what it’s like to be possessed. I’m a little overwhelmed. Also, how can this be? How can I be his vessel? I’m in Lucifer’s line.”
The grace flowed over Sam's body. He nodded his head as if in answer to a question. Then the blue light flowed quickly into his body. His eyes glowed bright golden. An angel blade manifested in his hand. He raised the blade overhead and seemed to drop into a protective stance.
He heard the whimper again. He considered calling out for Sam, but somehow managed to convince himself that it might be nothing. It could have been a bit of air seeping past a door or something. It wasn’t, but it could have been. Dean walked gingerly up the metal steps toward the door, gun at the ready. The noise picked up in volume just a little. It was more like crying now. Dean gripped the door handle, and taking a deep breath, opened the door.
“It's complicated. She did a lot of bad things, but she thought that she had good reasons.” Sam's gaze slid to Rowena. “She lost someone that meant a lot to her, and she suffered at the hands of someone that was very cruel. This changed her.”
“Add two of them, then test it.” Cas did what Dean said. Dean smiled and asked, “Does it taste like it needs more?”
“So, we going backpacking with babies? Thought you all were just going to the park.” Dean asked as he took a seat next to Rebekah. She passed him the cereal. “Thanks.” Dean winked at her and she smiled back. Sam came in next and sat across from them.
The scene shifted again, and Cas was in his own room at the bunker. It was recent. They’d shared over beers how they each worried, how Dean worried. Sam was always a bit more chill where Cas’ absences were concerned. Dean had told him that he wasn’t mad, just worried. When they went to bed, he’d wanted to talk more, explain what was going on. It would have changed things though.
Miracles happen everyday. They bundled back up, and somehow no one saw them leave. No one approached them on the streets for an autograph. No one seemed to even know that either of them existed. They even got back to the hotel and into the elevator up to Castiel’s floor. Miracles like that don’t happen everyday for Dean, but they happen for someone, and he was glad that it was finally his turn.
“I don't know.” Bobby was really looking at him now, really assessing everything about him it seemed.
Dean could see Castiel setting up. He managed to get closer to the edge of the stage even with Michael hanging off of him. He gave Cas a wave.
There was a room in the bunker where Dean kept clothes, not costumes as Sam might call them. They were absolutely clothes. They were special and to be worn in very particular occasions.
“Make sure to clear some time from your packed schedule. You two will have work to do.” It was said too quickly. Crowley walked out whistling a jaunty tune of his own making. Neither said goodbye. Castiel couldn’t help but feel that he’d been tricked.
Dean focused, and saw the vast field that was around them. He recognized it. Jack stood to his left, hand still settled on Dean’s shoulder. In front of them were Sam, Cas, and Dean. The moment was from over a year ago at least. Dean knew the moment well. They’d taken on a case, and Cas was with them. It was a small thing, nothing too hard. It was just the little sort of thing that they took care of between apocalypses.
Dean sucked in an audible breath. “This is nice. You didn’t have all this stuff last time I was here.” Dean walked around the room, peering at the various pictures on the shelves. The row of guitars got some extra attention. “Shit, is this?” Dean pointed at one of the electric guitars.
Castiel became concerned. He didn't like Michael, but he couldn't put his finger on a good reason why.
Cas licked his lips. He swayed a little. Dean squeezed his hands, anchoring him to this place, to this moment. “Is it working?” Dean whispered.
“Sure. You gonna make me dinner later too. I think you owe me a burger,” Castiel was referring to an earlier conversation where Dean had bragged about how he made sinfully good burgers.
“You almost knocked me out with how enjoyable this was.” Dean watched Cas sink back down on him. Head bobbing away as he sucked, Castiel made Dean feel like everything was zipping away and he was stuck on this small pinpoint of pleasure. Everything was Cas, and everything was so very good. Castiel’s tongue was circling him. His fingers were digging into Dean’s thighs and holding on for dear life.
The air stirred in front of him, a breeze that wasn’t a breeze. It was a movement of air displaced by what had come. His mouth moved through the words, Latin phrases hastily memorized. There was light in the darkness, drawn to the blood upon which she’d feast. She’d speak her peace and be done. Then maybe the world could be set to rights.
“You’d be fine. Most of your life you did just fine without me hovering over your shoulder.” Cas’ face was painted with a sad little smile.
“This didn’t happen, Jack. I don’t remember this,” Dean said as the kiss progressed in front of them.
“Hoping some walk-ins come on by. It’s been a slow week.” He lowered his hand from his forehead. I saw more of his squinty eyed expression. I shouldn’t keep obsessively thinking about how cute he is. He was devastatingly handsome. He had a rock hard body that I wouldn’t mind going toe to toe with. At the same time, he’s just cute.
“Of course.” Cas reached out and brushed his fingers through Dean’s hair. “And this is why I love you.”
Dean walked straight up to Cas, pressed his body to the wall and kissed him deeply. Cas moved his hands to Dean's face then back into his hair. “Missed you,” Dean breathed out as he stepped back.
“You act like you didn’t have any hand in helping.” Mary laughed. She clapped a hand on Charlie’s shoulder. “This one is quite the hunter. Could have taken them all out single handedly.”
It troubled her that there had been no mention of the other young priest and that the book was gone. She walked to the pub at the edge of town. It was no place for polite women, but she did not fear what men could do. She knew what she could do.
“Close your eyes.” Dean complied. “And, yes, you did.” Dean’s body swayed a little, and it brought his own cheek into contact with Cas’. As if to remind him, Cas said, “He told me who I loved.”
She felt confident going into the woods again. She even felt confident just sleeping through the night. It had been a solid month of peace, and surely, any of the exorcised demons would have returned by now in their shiny new vessels if they could have.
“I suppose I was.” Cas laughed too. “I thought that they might benefit from an example, but in the end, it was just fun to see the world from their perspective.”
Dean was at his side in an instant. Sam got Rebekah up onto the bed and leaned down to check her breathing. “What just happened?” Dean asked. Then over his shoulder he called out, “Cas!”
Castiel let the image play out in his mind, Michael having Dean like that. He felt his hands curl into fists at his sides.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t play with you before I consume you.” He was rather confident. Rowena smiled, because she was confident too.
His brain was not his friend. He eventually shut off the TV and went to the kitchen. Dean was already cooking up the first patties. Castiel’s stomach gave up a mighty growl.
“I can adjust our bond. I can make it so that you can hear me, like a prayer. You won’t hear everything, but I can at least send you thoughts, feelings. It would be small, but…”
Dean shared too, but he avoided some things. He talked a lot about Sam and his life on the road, but he spared some details about his dad that might have been too telling. He griped and complained about Sam's relationship with Ruby. He talked about his car, a pristine ‘67 Chevy Impala.
Castiel just hummed and turned his attention back to the screen. There was an epic fight. Somehow, Castiel’s hand had drifted to Dean’s head. He was stroking his fingers through Dean’s hair, giving little scratches to his scalp. When the movie ended, they let the credits play through for the end scene, then it went back to the still title screen. Dean rolled over a little and stared up at Cas. His eyes seemed to glow more in the illumination from the screen. Castiel’s hand had slid away from his head. He could feel the steady drum beat of Dean’s heart under his hand. It was music that Castiel was falling for. His eyes, traitors, swept over Dean’s body. Dean’s sweatpants, rather Cas’ sweatpants that Dean was borrowing, were too tight on him. They revealed more about Dean’s state than Cas should know. Cas couldn’t look away, and yet Dean was watching him not look away.
“Nope. Well, mad that we'd been holding out on him. He had no clue we could do the musician thing. We had to show him all of the songs we'd been working on, stuff we were just goofing off with.”
It was all I could do to just survive. Then we had to go deal with the car, and he just had to keep standing so close to where I was. His arms, shit, I almost let myself stop thinking about his damn arms. They were the sort of arms that make you fantasize all sorts of things. I was pretty sure he worked out, like maybe a lot. God, the things he could do to me with those arms. I’d let him push me around, get me up against some solid walls…
Cas didn’t leave the building right away. Instead he stood in the room a moment first and breathed from within this new body. He moved his own vessel to a small office. Joan told him that it would be safe there. It was one of the few coherent things that she said once he was occupying her body. She was mostly rambling on about the information he was feeding her concerning stars and distant universes. He made a slight adjustment to her telescope so that she’d see something new when she returned to this place, a little thank you for what she’d given him.
The male demon spoke now, “Everything here smells of angel. There’s no way that you haven’t noticed. You sensed us, what we were. You must be lying.” He turned to his demon partner and said, “I say we end her. Even if she knows something about the angel, it doesn't matter. We know he’s here, and killing her will cause him at least some grief.”
It would be a long week. They were back in the studio, and so was Cas. There would be no time to get together. Dean was already trying to work out a way to make time materialize in their schedules. He was failing epically.
“So some of these people might not even want to be involved with me?” It was a question. “Some of these people don’t know their agents are sending these to me.”
“No, no. I'm not freaking out like that. I'm…” He didn't know how to explain it, but he woke up in Castiel's arms and felt like everything was so fragile. “I'm going to ruin this, Missouri. I don't want to ruin this.”
She took the path all the way to the woods, then deviated into the trees to collect a few wild herbs for her evening meal. She stood near the tree with the banishing sigil for a moment and considered her day. The sun still hung high overhead. She stopped and picked a few sprigs of rosemary, before moving deeper into the woods for some thyme. She made her way back out to the path and wound her way back along the stone wall that lined her pasture.
“It is,” Gabriel responded. “We’ve only been able to determine that the orange part of the phenomenon is putting out some considerable energy. The Impala gathered some data before the event. You can see that here.” Cas watched the probes emerge from the side of the vessel. They’d have sent the data back to Calliope immediately, and Calliope would have sent the data onward as well, just as quickly. Gabriel added, “I’m going to fast-forward a bit.” The video jumped ahead by twenty minutes. Apparently, they decided to send one of the crew out in a small pod to get a closer look.
“Not so much. I gathered videos from interested parties. No need for all of the scheduling that in-person auditions take. I got one from a...” he paused like he didn’t know what to say next, then added, “a friend.”
The guard smiled and pushed the button. Castiel felt like he left his stomach at the bottom as the elevator rose.
Dean reached out when the song was done and cupped the side of Cas’ face. It was an intimate moment. They grinned at each other, but Dean could see the confusion in Cas’ eyes. They were always so careful in public, and this was very public. Dean nodded and dropped his hand. The crowd was eating it all up with a spoon.
“I need to get out of here,” Dean declared to his empty house. He made his way to the garage complex. He rarely chose to drive in L.A. It was just so frustrating. Today, though, he was willing to cope. When the engine roared to life, he knew he had made the right decision.
They walked together, but didn’t seem to be heading for the motel exactly. “Where to?” Dean asked as they continued their walk. Cas really had no destination in mind. Neither did Joan. He’d assumed they’d go back to the motel, but they just didn’t.
“It does.” She was writing something on a slip of paper, the number. She slid it to him. “Is there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Winchester?”
“Not sure. I think it means we make it up as we go.” Dean pulled into a long driveway. Eventually there was a gate. He had to get cleared for entry before it opened. There was a nice Victorian house at the end of the drive, large with a wrap around porch, unusual for the Malibu region.
Castiel tipped his head to the side and really considered him. “Intriguing.” Dean wasn't sure what that meant. “Very bold of you.” He turned away to head back into the bus. “I'll see you in the dining room at say, 7?”
“Is that your way of saying that you’ll be trying on clothes and parading around in them in front of me until I tell you something positive about them?”
"Yeah, well, maybe war with dear old dad, looks a lot like abandonment. Maybe he's just casting everything off to the proverbial wolves. If he does nothing, never intervenes, then it will likely all just fall apart.
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean laughed a little, and Cas could feel the gentle rumble of it up his back. “It tore me up though. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t think straight. Everything was just you. I hated everyone and everything. I was horrible to Jack, but you already knew about that.”
“This is likely why you came back. You know this is fun.” Dean did a little twirl and pushed down the thought that this was not the manliest moment he ever had.
"No, I really don't." They got to the car and drove back to the motel with silence hanging between them.
“I don’t know, just different. Like would you ever want to settle down somewhere or go back to heaven? You know change the way things are.”
“Pumped.” Cas gave Dean a wink then looked out at the sea of people. They'd had sold out concerts for months now, but those venues were no bigger than a few hundred people. This was like it was before when Winchester and Fallen were their own things.
“Yeah, it's all out and there's no guitar.” The guy was wearing a headset and holding a clipboard. “They pulled out the white electric for Sam, the red and grey bass for Ruby, and the drums and keyboards. We've even gotten all the rest out, mics and lights. His guitar isn't in there.”
Castiel closed the laptop and set it on the table. He walked to the cabinet and got out the bottle of Jack. He had some glasses stowed behind the bottle and brought two of them over to the table too. He poured a little into each glass.
“Dad was just a drifter. He never could settle into a place once mom died. He took odd jobs in one town after the next. We lived in run-down roadside motels all over the country.”
He sent his grace to him, mending the bone. He didn’t let Dean go just yet. He felt Dean beneath him, growing hard. Their position was clearly not so upsetting. Cas wondered about that. He’d thought they’d need a different vessel for this. Dean’s face fell a little. He moved and pushed Cas off. Cas let him.
“Was seriously considering it. Why?” Dean propped up his head on his hand while he watched Cas ease off of the bed with the laptop.
He seemed to hesitate. Her question did come without preamble. “There is Father Thomas as well. He is still missing.” Father Matthew’s answer came with a trembling delivery. Rowena returned her gaze to him. He was afraid of her, despite his bravado. She could see it now.
Castiel laughed and said, “Then I should definitely consider it.” They got up from the couch. Dean took Cas’ hand in his. There'd be a swarm of reporters between the exit and the bus, questions to answer, and cameras to capture everything. They walked the long hall to the exit door. Dean could already hear the commotion outside.
“Bitch.” Dean took the flask though. “Shit, this more of that ‘shine?” Dean said after choking down a swallow.
They'd have patched things up in time. He knew that, believed it. He'd pushed them too hard. Back-to-back tours and constant studio time were bound to break them. Anna had a family, or at least she did. Uriel wanted to pursue other interests. They didn't want to break up the band. They just wanted to stop being driven like cattle by its leader.
“Couldn’t it have been a path you both took?” Cas’ hand brushed the back of Dean’s hand with each step. There was warmth radiating from him. Cas focused on the sound of his heart beating steadily.
“What’s that mean?” Dean glanced away toward the porthole and caught a glimpse of Cas chatting away with Kevin out on the hill. “Oh.”
“I don't hate you. That song is about me.” Castiel turned back to the sandwiches and pulled them off of the grill. They were a little dark. “Can we not?”
It was then that Sam emerged from the back of the bunker with Rebekah in tow. “Mom,” he said with all the affection of a son that had never felt an ounce of anger at his parents. He stalked over to her and swept her into a hug. “You’re back.”
Dean seemed to think about that for a moment then said, “Nah, we're just going out to Malibu for a bit.”
“Still a musician. Not doing film just yet. And if I do, you'll be the first to know.” He tossed her a wink for good measure.
“I can follow certain feelings, longing for one. You were concerned, saddened, and in that there was a selfless longing for Sam’s freedom. In all of that though, I couldn’t manage to track where you were with only the feelings. I thought that if I could just get words to you that maybe…”
“Calm down bucko.” Dean settled a hand on his shoulder. “You got this.” Cas came over and joined their little trio. Dean leveled his gaze on him. “You ready, Cas?”
“Despite what you think, I'm really entertaining this idea of yours. I feel like I haven't slept in months.”
Cas glanced up at him and then went back to the computer. “Research. I imagine that I’ll be able to narrow down the possible items that she’s attached herself to. Maybe when you wake up, it’ll be quicker.”
Their relationship was still just theirs, and sometimes Cas struggled with that. Telling Sam had been a step in the right direction, but it had been one of the only steps. Kevin knew, but that was only because he walked in on them kissing at the studio when they thought that he'd left for the day.
He turned back to his room. Rowena was in his bed, blanket pulled up to her shoulders where he had left it. She was breathing shallowly, but if he knew her, and he thought he did, he knew that he shouldn’t have to worry for her safety. She was stronger than all of them. He was a little concerned that she returned to the bunker alone. He was also a little concerned that something weakened her. He was also concerned by the feel of her, when he scooped her up in his arms and felt the shape of her pressed to him.
Cas went to his room and he went to his own. The scene in front of him told a bigger story. Cas moved out into the hall. He seemed to be weighed down by something. He came to Dean’s door and just stood there a moment. He raised his hand to knock. Instead he pressed his head to the door and just stood like that for several minutes.
Dean thought about what had gotten them to this moment, and found that he couldn’t remember how Cas got hurt. He could remember other things, conversations from a few days prior but not the injury that landed him in this bed.
“I feel your sadness. I feel your want. I feel everything that you feel. It is the nature of our connection.”
When Cas changed for bed, pulling on a fresh, albeit, threadbare old t-shirt that Dean had given him, Dean said nothing. When Cas opted not to pull on sweatpants over his boxers, Dean continued to say nothing. There were jokes running through his head and admonitions concerning how one should sleep next to another dude. Dean wondered if he’d made a mistake keeping all that to himself.
“There's more than that. He's funny and tender. He's had such a rough upbringing, and through all that he never stopped caring. He has known loss, and it didn't defeat him.” Castiel looked away, a blush rising to his cheeks with the confession. “I sound like an idiot.”
Gabriel could only nod just slightly in agreement. "Sam was impressive right from the start. I watched him time and time again as he tried to fix things, save Dean, and get to a Wednesday. I came to care just a little about him, his well-being. I thought, well if anyone could change fate, maybe it was this guy and maybe that would be good, a different kind of balance."
“We don’t even know what’s causing it.” Sam turned to Cas then and asked, “You getting anywhere with it?”
The camera was as close as it'd get. The final note was held, long and rich and warm. Castiel let go of the guitar, let it hang loose at his chest. His hands fell to his sides. Silence. The crowd erupted with applause. The video ended. It was about to auto play another song, something else from the Grammys. Dean shut it off and remembered to breathe.
“They must have remodeled it since the last time we were here.” Cas took off his coat and laid it over the back of the chair. Dean watched him. It was like the guy was naked all of a sudden with the shedding of just that one layer. Cas caught his eye and raised a brow. “What?”
The day was full and filled with joy and sunshine. Lovewell Park was a bit of a drive. Dean had worried about what the day would feel like with two babies cooped up in a car for so long. It turned out fine though, and by the time they all poured out of the car, the beauty of the place made up for the journey. There was a bit of water and rich green grasses. Rebekah was given an excess of attention, and the babies gurgled and smiled the day away. By midday, they opened up the packages of food, and had a rather large meal on one of the park’s tables.
Cas followed him up the path to the front door. A woman in plain clothes, jeans and a tee, came out to greet them. “Sam's out back meditating. He didn't say you were coming to visit today.” She was all smiles though.
Castiel set aside the phone and got in the shower. He wondered, not for the first time, if this time could be different. Before he left, Dean had kissed him. He whispered in Castiel's ear that he'd be back later, and he'd called him Angel with all the affection of someone who really felt something.
Gabriel came back up to his full height. “It’s about heaven. Sam told me that I was needed, that God was on a permanent vacay. He said he needed me. You know I can’t refuse Sam Winchester. So I set things in motion, made him my vessel, made him forget. I knew there would be sacrifices, these things always go like that. It was the only way though. I had to get to the source of the problem, and leave a little help in my wake.”
Dean rolled his eyes and pulled back onto the road, heading for Hastings. He whispered at Cas,  “Dick.”
“You sound like you're feeling for him.” She stretched his hand and wrist. It felt nice. He carried discomfort there after a long tour, and this was a long tour. “Maybe you can just be his friend. Sounds like he needs that more than anything if he feels like he can't be himself. Guy's what, thirty?”
I'm so sorry for the delay in posting this chapter. I got some writer's block that I couldn't shake. I think I'm over that now, and there's a final chapter count now. Thanks so much for reading and for all the comments you've been leaving.
“I’m a hunter. You don’t go checking up on hunters like they’re normal people.” She slid her gun back under her mattress.
“Oh, yeah. Hey Sam, catch.” Dean threw the keys to him, and Sam reached up by instinct and caught them. Dean turned back to the street and headed toward the Victorian.
Dean took off his guitar and settled into the chair across from Castiel. He strummed the new guitar. “I’m still working on it. Not sure it’s going anywhere.” He sounded shy all of a sudden, this man who could play anything, who could make a crowd fall in love.
“Well Bobby was willing to make the trek with me. Apparently he and Crowley are…” Sam made an obscene gesture with his hands.
“Lucky for me Uriel went off wandering to get away from my brooding. And the rest as they say is history.”
Gabriel suddenly looked sad. His eyes passed from Cas to Dean and back. "I was so wrapped up in my own issues. Cas." This last utterance was sadder still. "You threw it away?"
Anna had already taken a seat next to Uriel, who was playing a guitar. Castiel was at the back of the bus in yet another doorway, presumably to the room containing the guitars. As Dean drew closer to the back of the bus, his eyes fell on the guitar Uriel was playing. “Whoa, that's a ‘43 Gibson.”
“Dean, god, oh god,” Castiel breathed out as Dean began kissing down his throat. “Dean, Dean,” Castiel's vocabulary devolved. Dean felt encouraged.
“Keep reminding yourself of that.” Anna came to his side and pulled him into a sideways hug. “Love ya buddy.”
A sound at his back alerted him to someone else's presence. He turned, and was greeted by the brunette from the bar. "Hey there."
“Are they okay?” Dean was subconsciously slowing down the car. He was ready to flip it around and barrel right on home. Cas’ hand moved back to his shoulder and squeezed it again reassuringly.
Dean didn't feel ready to let the evening end. There were a couple of ways it could go, but all options felt like they'd be too much. Walking bought him time. “You see any paparazzi on the property?”
“Morning to you too.” Dean rubbed at his eyes as he sat up a bit. Everything was still a little fuzzy with sleepiness. Sam was still holding out the tablet. “You know, some of us require beauty sleep.”
“Not sure what the goal is here.” Cas ducked and Dean’s swing missed. Dean was a little off balance for a moment. “I could knock you out easily.”
Dean flipped over one of the flyers on the nightstand to see where they were. They were supposed to be heading into Colorado, but he knew they were nowhere near there. The flyer had a picture of a lake on it. “Ironic.” Dean shook his head.
The first time was after a hunt. Dean said he needed to blow off some steam. Sam said he just needed to sleep. So it was just Cas and Dean out at a bar. Dean even gave him the keys to the Impala, saying, "If I drink too much or you get bored, you can take her back to the motel. Maybe we’ll both get lucky though." Then he elbowed him all good and jolly like this was something they both wanted. After a few minutes scoping out the place, Dean pointed his beer toward a table with a couple of women. "Wanna give that table a shot?" Cas shrugged and got up like he was game even if he wasn't. He had no intentions beyond just following Dean wherever he went.
Dean started playing through the chorus, just getting a feel for the new guitar. His whole demeanor seemed to lighten up as he played. Dean was talented. There was no doubting that. Castiel had been an admirer even long before they’d met in person.
“Is there some other way we can work around this?” Dean leaned into the counter and tried for a different look, one that was quiet and unassuming. “I just can’t think of another way to surprise them without it being all public. Everything we do is always so,” Dean waved his hand around and then added, “out there, ya know.”
Dean tried not to let it get a foothold in him, but the feelings were there just like they always were, just like they always would be.
“You’ve not taken on a young novice, or a replacement for Father Thomas then?” She ran her fingers along the edge of his desk, feeling the dips and ridges of it.
Cas didn’t respond right away. His eyes seemed to darken a little. His lips curled up into a half smile. “I believe it did.”
“You’ve got two. You could spare one.” E’brem clearly didn’t know the danger that he was stepping into with that comment, but neither did Dean or Cas. Samuel started crying then too. E’brem was a mystery.
He still hadn’t moved his hand up to Cas’ chest. Something about the way his muscles felt beneath the thin t-shirt just did something to him. He found himself tracing the lines of muscles in a kind of pattern, letting his fingers fall into the grooves of Cas’ body just there.
Cas moved Dean’s hand again. Dean could feel the wiriness of hair. His fingers raked over the warm skin around Cas’ cock. He didn’t grab him though. Cas didn’t move him there. He let Dean’s hand go. He moved his hand to Dean’s hip and moved his own body a little closer. Dean didn’t close his hand around him even then. He waited.
Cas didn't let him finish. “It was perfect. I've never come so fast.” Cas looked away, a shyness taking over his features. “I can be your friend.”
So two people in all the world were in on the secret. It should have been enough, but Cas wanted more. He wanted to tell everyone. When interviewers asked about his dating life he wanted to tell them all about Dean and how much he meant to him.
Cas sat down on a low, flat rock and patted the space beside him. “Sit with me.” Dean was pretty sure Cas just wanted him to sit because he was worried about him overexerting himself. “Want some?” Cas held out the sandwich.
“I wouldn't go that far, but they are sharing a room at the hotel we're all staying in. I'd avoid dropping in unannounced.” Sam tossed himself in a seat. Dean sat on the couch. There was a bowl of some candy. He pulled one out and ate it. Cas was still hovering at the door, likely processing the new information. Sam gave Dean a look that asked a question. Then he shot a quick glance at Cas.
“Nah, I’m good.” Dean focused on the shiny black of the Impala and waited for words to find him. “Guess we’ll be going home soon.”
And maybe if either of them had been direct the tensions wouldn't have built. They solved their case, they went back to the bunker, and they got a dry patch. Sam seemed happy to have nothing looming on the horizon. Dean looked like he constantly wanted to punch something.
He let his mind linger on that thought for a moment. Virginia wasn’t like this. This was an anomaly. This was part of the problem.
Eyes closed, hands held, Dean let his mind focus on Cas. He was there and maybe everywhere. Only their hands touched, but it felt like his whole body was warm, held even. He almost spoke, made a joke that could lighten whatever this was between them. Cas seemed to sense it and pulled his hands just a little. It made Dean lean forward. Cas’ words tickled past his ear, an embrace of sorts, “Calm your thoughts. Let yourself just be.”
She looked up at him. “I’m sorry. Of course you do. It’s just hard to believe in something that never makes itself known.” She turned her attention back to the book.
Cas took a deep breath and seemed to hold it. He started moving the folded clothes back into the bag. “You have enough help now.”
“Damn.” Castiel settled into one of the stools at the counter. “So you didn't want this?” Castiel waved his fingers between them. Dean just shrugged, and the silence dragged out between them. “Then why'd you sign the contract?”
“I need to remember not to be gone so long next time.” Cas looked to Sam then and asked, “What do you think is causing the hallucinations?”
Castiel slid off the stool and came around the counter. He leaned into the space next to Dean, hoping for some eye contact. “Dean.”
“God, it’s good to have you back.” He was smiling as he said it and was given a return on the investment. Cas looked like he hadn’t heard an ounce of anything good in some time, and this was hardly a deep well of feelings coming out of Dean.
Now Cas sighed and threw his head against the chair back. “We text. We're going to get lunch or something when I get back.”
Sam didn’t share all of his concerns with the others. Instead he just put her into his bed and immediately covered her up. She almost looked peaceful. He reached down and brushed a strand of hair back from her cheek. He sat at his desk chair and propped his feet on the end of the bed. “Let me know if you need anything,” he whispered to her. She, of course, did not respond. Sam closed his eyes and tried to sleep. His thoughts though were all swimming. It was like he was being carried out to sea on rolling waves of senseless doubt. She’d never been taken down before, not really. And she faced Lucifer.
Dean swam over to join him. “You don’t need to worry about him. Not like he’s going to take advantage of me or something. We’re in the same band, and…” Dean paused for effect before adding, “I’m not interested in him.”
Cas wondered if it was right, asking her to do this. It had been his intention, but she was clearly drawn to him, not Dean. He thought of Dean though, and the desire to touch him again, to feel his body pressed to his own, that desire won out. “Would you be willing to let me occupy your body for one night?”
Cas could hear Dean’s breathing increase with his clear worry. “Sam, retreat! Sam! Sam!” Dean was in an immediate panic. Cas could see why. The blackness surrounding the phenomenon seemed to extend toward Sam and latch on, for lack of a better word. It was pulling him toward the light.
“Too late. Claire was already entertaining Jack and the babies with some Zepp.” Sam’s voice grew distant. “Yeah, talking to Dean and Cas.” His voice came back to the phone. “You all coming back tonight or tomorrow?”
“Well, her mom Ellen is her agent, but she was struggling to get bookings. She ended up asking Bobby to help organize her contacts. He ended up doing more than that. He started building a whole network. He was all sorts of charm.”
The door opened. Castiel stood in front of him in a full suit. The color was really something, electric blue and a little shimmery. “Heya, Cas,” Dean said, silently cheering for himself for sounding just fine. And because he was confident, Dean reached out and began straightening Cas’ tie. He even gave Castiel's chest a little pat and said, “Looking good.”
“I might be able to help you sleep if you’d like.” Cas had his fingers curled into the blanket. Dean wanted it to be okay to touch his hand, to be touched by those fingers. It was a fleeting thought, that added to the surprise of Cas moving his hand toward him. Cas settled his hand on Dean’s cheek.
“Thanks. Got to hear a little bit from you all too, before I was getting rushed out. Sounded great.”
“Maybe.” Castiel set aside the guitar and picked up the acoustic that was leaning near him. He handed it over to Dean. “You mind playing that song that Bobby sent in?”
“I am, but only a little.” They fell into silence for a time, and Rowena read. She noted the hidden symbols in the illumination, the sigil that the artist painted into the margin. She copied some things from the book onto a thin piece of hide that she had brought with her. The hide in her possession was not of the same quality as the hides used for this book. Her father would have been impressed. He made the thin hides used for books nearly as often as he tanned the hides for clothing and other things.
She handed Dean the letter. He scanned it quickly and said, “So a few more to add to the Winchester Daycare it seems.” Cas leaned in and read the letter.
Jack added, “She’ll learn to control that. Maybe I can work on that with them.” Jack turned to the others, “Well, let’s go finish breakfast.” Claire and the twins followed him out. Dean even handed off Samuel to Jack as he went.
“Me too. I'm also glad that we became friends. I don't exactly socialize much outside of the band.” Cas took another chip and ate it.
Gabriel came down on one knee. “No, but I missed you. You are a mighty little warrior. I’m so proud of you.” He reached for her and she stepped back. Gabriel stood again. “It seems I have a lot of damage to repair, bridges to unburn. I’m sorry that there wasn’t another way.”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas slid one of the beers over. “I ordered you a beer. Hope it wasn’t too presumptuous.”
“Of course I have the appropriate seats. I ordered them at the same time as the Baby Bjorns,” Sam said as he leaned back in his seat, all sorts of smug. “I might just order some other things that we need too.”
“Geesh, wait a sec, will ya. I still gotta button up.” He fumbled his way through the buttoning and zipping. He put on the jacket and moved past Cas. “Go sit.”
“Getting there.” Dean took a sip from the new bottle. “Sammy and I, we’re simple people. We grew up on the road. Dad was always hauling us from one place to the next. Spent more nights in the back of the Impala, catching sleep, than in an actual bed.”
Castiel was wearing the long black and grey plaid that he'd described. He also had the collar popped. Dean broke away from his band to get closer to Cas. “Hey, buddy,” Dean greeted him.
“You heard me praying when I was in there didn’t you?” Dean had wondered, but he hadn’t asked before.
“We taught them how to fight without using their powers. It was just some simple moves. Jack said that sometimes when you don’t know your own strength, you should go with something simpler.”
“I don’t know how to stay.” It was an admission that didn’t promise anything. Dean let him go a little. He moved so that they faced each other, with Dean’s arms still loosely around him.
“Don't know. I'll ask him later,” Dean said. He stared after Cas though and thought about what they’d been through up to this point. He understood more than he let on.
“I was jealous, and I’m pretty confused about what this all is.” Cas leaned in and kissed him just below his jaw. He gradually moved his lips down to his neck where he nuzzled in a bit.
Cas looked proud, and Dean liked the turnaround so much that he was determined to encourage it at all costs. “So show me how we do this.”
“Doesn’t say,” Dean said as he handed the letter to Sam. He reached into the bassinet and lifted the baby free from the space. She was light and quite confined in her little burrito blanket. “Who brought you here little Ellie?” Dean whispered into the side of her head as he took an unconscious breath of baby scent in.
He didn't know what was right anymore. There seemed to be no point, no light at the end of the darkness, no reward or even peace. "I don't have any love left in me. You took it with you, you goddamn sonofabitch." Dean was losing it more and more. His face was a mess of tears now. His breathing came in rough gaps.
This was working out fine for the most part. They eventually got onto the 40 in Arkansas, and Dean felt like he didn’t have to focus as much on the drive. The rural roads that they’d opted for during the earlier part of the trip had been rife with animals, large deer that seemed intent on diving headlong into the road. The 40 was not going to be a problem. They’d drive through some long stretches of tree-lined highways, but it should be safe enough.
“I sometimes wish I could have words with your father.” Dean glanced at Cas. “I suppose that he didn’t realize just how much you needed from him.”
“You always did like too much cream and sugar.” Dean held his cup between two hands and watched him.
Sorry for the long wait. It's been quite the month. Just got back from a small vacation that kept me from going stir crazy at home. Being mostly bed bound for a month will do that. So glad to be getting back to normal.
Cas answered, “Yes.” He suddenly looked a little unhappy. Dean wondered if Cas still viewed human/angel relations as abominations. Truth be told, he had thought that Cas had gotten over that line of thinking with the arrival of Jack.
“They putting you up at the Ranch?” The Ranch was the isolated hotel a few miles down the road. It had its own airstrip and a price point that guaranteed a certain wealthier clientele.
Cas reached out and pulled Dean toward the bedroom by his belt loop. Cas let him go in front of the bed and said, “You’re wearing too much clothing, Dean.”
Dean got up and stretched out to the ceiling. "Well, this has been great, but I'm going to get some sleep before I get a headache from all this." Dean started to head for the hall. "You coming, Cas?"
“I wish,” he paused again and looked like he was struggling for words. He looked at Dean earnestly. “I’d fall, choose humanity in a heartbeat. I want that. You take too many risks though for me to chose any sort of life like that. You need an angel watching over you.”
“I,” Dean started as he slid in. “I was going to go to a bar or something. Wanted to give you both some space if you wanted it. Then I just came back here instead.” He looked off out the side window and added, “To lick my wounds or something.”
“It’s more than that. I wouldn't be here.” The boy took Castiel's hand. Security started to move in, but Castiel waved them off.
"Too wound up for that. Thought I'd see if you were still up." Cas sat down in front of Jack, curling his legs up in a way that mirrored the boy.
Cas cupped her cheek in his hand. “Not yet. You were trying to heal a very powerful witch. You need to be more careful.”
Rowena laughed. She scanned the shelves for the book, but it was not there. She squinted at them and wondered if the novice had placed it in a different location. “Are you the only man of God assigned to this parish?”
Cas broke free from him and turned away. He took a deep needless breath of air and said, “I won’t leave.” His head dipped down to his chest. “Things have to change though. I can’t keep doing this.” He waved a hand out next to him as if that explained anything.
Dean almost fell off the floaty. “You're home!” Dean paddled over to the edge, just beneath Cas’ feet.
Then Castiel had to go out of town for a weekend, something having to do with an interview in New York to promote the new single or something. This threw Dean into a bit of a tailspin. He had patterns now. What was he going to do now that he had a Cas-free weekend?
The band had done a tour in India and parts of Southeast Asia. While there, Castiel bought all of the furniture that made up the feel of the room. There was the blue and gold puffy couch, the round blue ottoman style chairs, the large intricately patterned rug. The piano that sat at the corner had a large, some would say too ornate, candelabra perched on its lid. He’d bought it in a small shop outside their hotel in Bangkok. Everything had called to him. The piano was something else. It was not from the band’s travels. It was Anna’s. After the accident, her husband said that she wanted him to have it. She’d planned to send it to him after the break up. She just hadn’t gotten the opportunity. He’d also told Castiel other things, things about how she felt, the regrets. It didn’t help.
“Then the crash.” Crowley finished for him. “That wasn’t your fault. And no one knew about the breakup. No one ever needs to know about the breakup.”
“It’d probably help if I returned your calls.” She reached across the table to him and set her hand on his. “I’m sorry, Dean. I can do better, and I will.”
“Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Cas.” He smiled back at Cas. “You feel all of it?” The last question was about everything else, everything beyond this place beside the motel in the dark.
Cas raised his hand up and settled it on Dean’s shoulder as they walked. Dean’s pace altered a little, almost like he’d stumbled when Cas put his hand on him. “The world owes you a great debt. You are a real hero, Dean Winchester.”
“I think so, but at the time, my attentions were elsewhere. Anna said they did.” Castiel kicked off the wall that they had been leaning on in order to float on his back for a few minutes. Dean splashed him. Clearly, this was not going to be a relaxing visit to his pool.
They kept meeting in the studio, and they even came up with a sort of pattern. They practiced one of Dean’s songs first. Next, they’d practice one of Castiel’s half finished pieces. They worked on endings for Castiel’s songs, which took up the lion’s share of the time. It was tedious work, but progress was being made.
Dean turned too. The woman and the child were crossing toward the general store, “Something worrying you?”
“I’d rather go to sleep naturally, if it’s all the same to you.” Cas let his hand fall back to his side of the bed. “Thought you were offering something else there for a minute.” Dean nearly kicked himself for the admission the moment that it came out.
Gabriel sighed. "I was a different class of jerk back then, one foot in heaven, the other on the run." He got up and started pacing. "I met Sam. Messed with him quite a bit." He waved his hand at Dean and said, "Sorry about all the death."
“Some women enjoy trying unusual things, things you wouldn’t expect right away.” Cas moved back into Dean’s space. He tipped his head into the space near Dean’s ear and added, “The apartment is just over there. We don’t even have to drive.”
“I'm glad for us too.” Dean looked to Cas, and Cas squeezed his hand. It was a step, a good step, a big step.
Dean took a deep breath and let it all out in a single gust. “I trust you with my life. I trust you with Sam’s life. I trust you.” Cas’ body seemed to release some of the tension that had been keeping him ramrod straight at the wheel. “What’s this all about?”
"Cas, briefing room, now," Gabriel snapped him out of his thoughts. "Get up!" Gabriel was already heading out the door of the lab. He was abrupt often, but this was extreme even for him. Cas followed him. Gabriel was the mission commander. He directed all of the teams that flew out of Houston.
“Enjoying the moment.” Cas let his thumb do the sweep along Dean’s wrist again. Dean didn’t process the fact that they were still holding hands until then. “Close your eyes,” Cas said. He used a tone that made Dean want to obey.
Kali stood and moved Deimos and Phobos behind her. “Were you keeping them from me?” She seemed to grow larger, more menacing with the question.
Ten years ago, he'd stood in this kitchen. Ten years ago Castiel had moved into his space, crowded him up against that very counter, challenged everything Dean thought he knew about himself. Ten years ago Dean fell, and he'd been a broken excuse of a man since. He ruined good things before they even got started. He regretted so much.
Dean leaned in. He wanted to taste love on Cas’ lips. It was something like coming home. And how he had been going so long without this, was one of life’s great mysteries. Cas deepened the kiss, pulled Dean closer, but not close enough. The items for the spell were still laid out between them. Dean held onto him though, let his fingers cling to the folds of seemingly endless trench coat. Cas lifted him up from the floor. Dean’s body seemed willing to do whatever Cas wanted.
Cas turned back to her. "What could you know about this? You don't know us, and you certainly don't know him."
“You don't have to like me to fulfill your contact. Hell, we could hate each other and make a real rager album. I don't care.” Castiel walked to the door and opened it. “See you tomorrow. Don't be late.” He closed the door behind him and was gone. Dean wasn’t sure what to make of that, but he did know that he was going to try. It didn’t matter if Castiel hated him. He was going to do this.
Sam set a hand on Dean's shoulder. “It's New Year's man. Everyone's going to be here.” They slipped past Dean and headed into the hotel. Michael followed them. They were early enough that they might be able to sleep a bit more. Dean felt too awake for that option now. He'd had so many regrets from that night, not the least of which was forgetting to get Castiel's phone number.
“I’m fairly certain that you have what we need in the car.” He turned back to Dean then and watched him eat. Dean gave up halfway through the burger. Turned out that two burgers were a little much, or maybe it was the way Cas looked at him. Or maybe it was the warm press of his leg under the table.
Dean just stared at him. That was shock on his face. Yes, total shock. Castiel started to shake. He hadn’t meant to throw out so much honesty. It was not what he’d ever intended. He was fine with Dean thinking that the past ten years were just fine for him. He was fine with Dean thinking that leaving was easy.
“I didn't even know we were dating. I thought we were friends. The press followed us. They filled the rags with all the usual speculation. It was so silly to me. I didn't bother to correct it. I thought we were on the same page until she tried to kiss me. Some paparazzi caught the moment that I pushed her away.”
Winchester arrived on the red carpet just after Fallen. “Fuck yeah!” Ruby hollered as the limo came to a stop. She seized Dean's arm then Sam's. “We fucking did it guys.” Michael leaned in and hugged her and Dean all at once.
“Cas,” Dean said. It sounded like a question again. Cas wasn't looking at him. He was fully focused on his cooking, or at least pretending to be. After all, how much does one really need to focus on grilled cheese?
Cas walked to the counter and picked up the sugar jar. “Here.” He took the mug from her and set it on the counter. He began spooning sugar into the mug. He went to the fridge next and got the milk.
It had been weeks of this, this tension. Some days Dean wouldn't even look at him. Cas thought that it'd pass. Actually he never thought that their actions would lead to anything like this.
Anna, thankfully interrupted. “Maybe just make sure he knows that this is platonic. Don’t lead him on if this is just bros hanging out or some shit.”
Castiel closed his eyes and moved just slightly in and out. Dean's breathing was rough. “More,” Dean begged again.
Once he was buried, she picked up her basket and headed back to the path that lead to her home. She hummed a soft tune, a bar song that her father use to sing when she was a wee girl.
“Oh, I see. You're a beer blamer. You gonna try to get in my pants then claim the beer made you do it?” The question was tossed off like a joke, but there was a touch of the serious under the tone.
“Then why is it that every song I’ve ever written since I met you has been about you? Why is it that such a completely ordinary, not-so-very-special man, has managed to fuck with my entire song catalogue so thoroughly?”
“So no special someone to kiss at midnight?” She looked positively sad. “I must find you then and remedy this dire situation.” She smiled at him, and he knew it was all for the cameras. Her eyes sparkled, and her flowing red hair made her look almost magical.
“I guess I have my answer.” Cas scooped the baby up and set him on the makeshift changing table. He began undoing the jumper and laid out the fresh diaper and wipes. Dean stared down at Ellie looking peaceful. She hadn’t changed. Maybe that meant that she trusted him. Maybe that meant that she wouldn’t grow up and leave. It was an odd line of thinking, but he was already feeling rather attached. It had been a week, but again it had felt like so much longer.
They didn’t talk on the way home, didn’t need to. It was warm and pleasant between them. It was as if they each knew what the other was thinking, and they were on the exact same page. Eventually, Dean made the turn onto their road. He was going to pull right on into the garage, maybe call Sam out to help them haul in the baby supplies. Before reaching the bunker, he came to a sudden halt. In the road, just ahead, was a little girl, with long waves of red hair. By the height of her, she was maybe three years old. She was standing stock still in the middle of the road. Dean got out and walked to her. Cas came to his side and held a hand out to arrest Dean’s progress. “Wait.”
“The light was on. Last I checked, that means do not enter.” Castiel kept his eyes on Dean. He apparently couldn't be civil.
“Your home or mine?” That had been something that had been hovering between them for awhile now. Dean spent most nights out at Cas’ place, but there'd also been a fair number of nights that they'd stayed at Dean's penthouse too.
“I can’t imagine what you were looking for in the woods, dressed like that. Perhaps I could help you.” Rowena braced for an attack, but she put on the air of confidence that she felt the situation demanded. She had her hand in her basket. There was a thin silver blade beneath the plants. She had words that could be said in the right sequence that would give her an advantage. Something in her knew though, that this was not a man, despite his appearance.
“Shut up.” Castiel closed his eyes and let his mind wander over the lyrics that he could retain. “It was perfect. One song down, ten or so to go.”
She turned to the young priest, a novice she’d not met before. He was short in stature and seemed nervous in her presence. His dark blonde hair flopped in front of his eyes, in dire need of shears. “I’m looking for a book.” She decided that honesty was for the best.
Dean didn’t ask Cas about what was bothering him, and he certainly didn’t bring up tuning into angel radio. Doing that might be like listening to am radio out in the sticks. If one was lucky, they might catch an errant word or two over the static. It was surprising to Dean that Cas hadn’t known about the dwindling angel numbers. Now that he thought about it, Dean thought that it should have been very obvious. Then he said the thing about not being much of an angel anymore as if Dean would just understand that. He didn’t, but clearly that was something he had been expected to pick up on or something.
Getting back to L.A. was a quiet affair. The bus took them to the studio, then they were driven home from there by private drivers that Bobby had hired.
“Funny story. You see, Crowley asked me to start pulling his recordings each day, around about three months ago. He thought something was up. I mean, a guy who spends that much time recording should have something to show for it, right?”
“This is awesome. I won’t let you down.” There was something to how Michael said it that left a funny feeling in Dean’s stomach like he’d swallowed a hornet's nest or something. He breathed out though and went back to his seat. He could face Ruby and Sam’s wrath later. The glares they were giving him told him that there would definitely be hell to pay if the ‘shine didn’t make them forget.
The building itself was built on a long forgotten temple site. The gods were drawn to the place for the many sacrifices that had been made there long ago. In fact they thrived on the sacrifices made and the continued merriment of the current guests. They’d welcome them into the casino, and send them through the varied rooms full of wine, and bodies, and games of chance. The men and women that roamed the halls felt the distinct pleasure that comes from proximity to the gods.
“If I thought that would get you to sleep, I’d have offered.” Cas smiled and added. “Go to sleep.” He opened his laptop back up and went back to work. Dean kept staring at him, processing all of that.
“Yeah,” Dean encouraged. It worried him, that they somehow were on this topic. It was concerning that Cas’ time there still haunted him. At least that’s where Dean assumed this was going.
“I’ve got nothing better to do.” Dean rolled his eyes and picked up his jeans. He marched off to the bathroom. “I’ll be in the car,” Cas called out to him past the closed door.
“Don’t think I didn’t notice.” Dean paused a moment then added, “Wait, are you saying that you and she, that…”
Dean didn't look at him after that. He just gripped the steering wheel a little tighter. Cas reached up and set his hand on the back of Dean's seat, then let it slip down to his neck. He massaged him there as they drove along.
“Maybe. If they’re developing, that would make sense.” Dean checked Ellie’s mouth a little. “Doesn’t feel like there’s any teeth coming in there though.” Dean set her on the bed and got out the Baby Bjorns. “Here.” He passed one to Cas. “Let’s take them out for a walk. Maybe the night air will do them some good.”
“What can I say, I’m the baby listener.” Bobby laughs. “I’m gonna go get some beer. You want any, Mary?”
Castiel had nowhere to put his one arm except on Dean. So he settled it over Dean’s chest. It felt way too intimate. “I feel like I’m missing back story on this relationship,” Castiel said, directing their attention back to the film.
“Wait until you know what you’re consenting to first,” Cas admonished. “If we’re ever separated again, I want you to be able to hear me, to feel that I’m still yours.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “We will have to take two cars at this point. A mini-van makes more practical sense.”
“Sounds like the crowds are happy.” Uriel flashed a smile. “You look out there yet?” Dean shook his head. He didn't want to know what he was about to face. “It's a bit of a mess. The rains soaked the ground good. Everyone is a muddy mass of bodies. Looks like Woodstock out there.”
Dean headed for the door. It really did feel like home was closer. Stepping out into the frigid New York morning woke him up completely. And if that didn't, the sight of the other bus across from him sure did. Sam and Ruby were behind him now. Michael was stretching, back popping with the effort.
“Wait, we’re just talking a week?” Dean’s hand dropped. “I seriously thought you were going to be gone for months.”
“Well, you did forget to park your car properly. Maybe it was that.” Dean looked past Old Mo to his car and noticed that it was in fact sitting right in the middle of the road. “You also might have been meaning to stake out a space for the parade. Your brother and I have already claimed good seats in front of the general store there. Now of course, we are a little set back from things, but that’ll hardly matter to two tall men such as yourselves.”
Dean stepped aside and put the guitar back on its stand. He unhooked the amp and coiled up the cable. “When Sammy was gone, the band broke up. I wasn’t enough to hold them together, and frankly they didn’t want to work with me if Sam was out of the picture.”
He and Dean had been in the studio everyday for the past two weeks. Castiel worried for a moment that this was how it would start, the slow fall toward him being the tyrannical overlord he’d been before. Dean seemed happy though, for now.
Dean slid his hand slowly across the little chasm between them. He intended to press his palm to Cas’ chest, let him know he wasn’t alone, anchor him a little. Instead, Dean’s hand came to Cas’ stomach. His fingers grazed over the firm lines of muscles there.
“You know what I want,” Dean said as he stretched up to Cas’ mouth for another kiss. “Stop thinking about it all so damn much.”
Dean rolled his eyes and said, “Sure Cas. Let's just table this until after the concert though.” And as if on cue, there was a knock on the door.
“And look at us now. I've got a belly full of beer and steak and good looking company. Winning!” Castiel threw him a wink now too.
“Maybe you should try new things. You might like them.” Cas finished his coffee and set the mug on the counter. “Get dressed. I think I know where we need to go today.”
“If you call me mother of dragons, I’ll throw this flower right at you.” Sam laughed and Dean laughed too.
Sam turned, a bright smile on his face. The wind was blowing his long sandy hair all around. He was dressed in all white linen. “Dean.” Sam got up and marched to them, pulling Dean into a hug when they met in the middle. Cas just stood awkwardly to the side.
“No, you stay. If I don’t come back right away, just assume I went back to the motel.” Dean gave him a little shoulder pat as he walked past and out the door.
“Finding the angel is important. There was a prophecy, and we’d rather not see it become more than idle words. Sometimes it is important to put aside petty differences for the greater good.” The female demon smiled at her, as if that would be enough convincing.
When they left, Cas said as they got in the car, “I hope you know you're coming home with me, and you're staying the night.”
They were together, and from that union, a child came to be. From the moment she began, she could hear her father’s stories. She could hear affection in his voice and in her mother’s too. The first things she learned of were of love, and because of that the shadow girl grew happily.
“You and Sam and your mom. You were sitting at a table together. Castiel was there too. He was human. Everyone was happy. There were no monsters to hunt, at least not really. The world wasn’t ending. There was peace.” Jack looked down at his feet. “I don’t know where the vision came from. It doesn’t make sense to see the future with Castiel in it if he is dead.” Then Jack looked up. “Unless he can come back. Can he come back?”
“Sammy's always worrying that I don't meet people. I haven't told him much about how we've been talking.”
Dean shook his head. “Uh, no. It’s crazy how much they pay for this, plus the travel expenses. Do you know how much is left in my honor bar right now?”
Jack shrugged and Sam made his way to his room. He considered walking to Dean’s door to check on him, but that never felt necessary. Dean had Cas to check on him, and the babies made their needs known enough times during the night that Dean was surely not getting near enough sleep. Still, he walked down the hall a little and paused to listen. All was quiet, then there was the low hum of Dean’s voice, and the rumble of Cas’ response. Sam couldn’t make out the words, but he felt satisfied that all was well.
Dean tried to find the bridge to that comment. “Yeah.” Castiel slid a soup bowl to him. The sandwiches were untouched on a plate near him. Castiel didn't join Dean. He kept the counter between them. “Clearly, that didn't work out.”
Cas took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He had wondered when Dean would want to take up old patterns again. “Okay, Dean.” For now he let Dean hold him in his own body. He soaked in the warmth of him at his back. He let his own hands settle over Dean’s. He traced Dean’s fingers and thought of how much he needed him, even now, even when he shouldn’t.
The rest of the tour was a mess of days. Dean couldn't recall specifically any detail from any of the stops. It was all just yelling crowds, loud, fast songs, and falling back in the bus to do it all again the next day.
“Oh,” Jody sounded like herself again and continued, “Good. I just got off the phone with Sam. He said you were heading that way.” She laughed. “Well, he said that between the babies crying. It was funny.”
Cas snatched Dean's hand. “Come on.” He dragged Dean down the hall. There were some offices that were dark. Castiel went past those. He got to the end as the crowd was getting to three. Castiel pushed open the door and got Dean in the room and pressed right back against the door. The world outside was loud enough to penetrate the walls and glass. There were fireworks, then there was Castiel clutching his face in his hands. “Fuck, you're beautiful.”
Cas seemed to snap out of his shock then. He reached down to Dean and took his hand. Dean stood and had his own shock to deal with as Cas pulled him in for a kiss. The crowd cheered them on.
Cas had taken the laptop out to the car, so all Dean had to really do was just leave. “You figure out where we need to go?”
Sam and Ruby got off the couch together. Ruby reached down and pulled something out of the cushion. She held them up, a little gleam in her eyes. “Don't forget your underwear Dean.” She flung them at him, and they hit him in the face.
The drive felt quite long. It was only about an hour from where they had parked to home, but when babies cry, everything feels infinite. When they finally pulled into the garage, Cas was quick to undo the seatbelts, and free them. Dean reached in and removed Ellie from her restraints. Sam’s car pulled in next  to them. “You all okay?” Sam asked.
Ten years… Time enough to maybe mend the age old damages. Instead of taking pleasure in that line of thinking, Dean laid in Cas’ bed worrying. He could ruin it all again just as easily as he did the first time.
Dean cleared his throat and said, “Let’s play something together, just to get used to each other some more.” And that was how they spent the rest of their day. They played one song after the next. Sometimes they sang, and other times they just rolled through the chords. It was strangely relaxing. It was also easy falling into each other’s patterns. When they ended in the afternoon with quiet
She was somewhat surprised when a man stepped out of the woods. His suit was finely tailored, and not the sort of thing that one would wear in the woods or frankly anywhere near this region. They were all country folk here. “Well, you are not what I was looking for.” His words purred out over thin pink lips.
“Don’t do that. I might end up liking the authority.” Castiel snapped his ass with a towel as he went. Dean yelped, a very manly yelp.
“Look closely,” Gabriel directed. Then, the blackness of space grew bright as if a line of fire was burning in the midst of space. “Kevin has already begun running diagnostics.”
Crowley picked up his glass and downed it all in one go. He cleared his throat and said, “Actually it is. You are a part of a band. I didn’t sign you as a solo act. So you do have to pick someone.” The edge of his lip ticked up almost imperceptibly. He added, “And you have to do it by the year’s end or be in violation of contract. There are penalties you can’t afford.”
Cas set Samuel down in the secondary bassinet that they had hastily made up for him. “They could both use one.” He came back to Dean’s side and sat again, just as close as before. The warmth of Cas’ arm seemed to radiate right through his coat and into Dean. It was comforting. Dean found himself pressing right back into him, sucking up the feel of the moment.
“Less talking. More kissing,” Dean got the words out before Castiel was kissing him. There was finesse to the move like he'd trained for it. He had Dean's head tipped to the side just right. He had his tongue in Dean's mouth. The day's stubble was scraping Dean's cheek. He liked it, a lot.
Dean’s face had occupied a lion’s share of his imagination over the past months. Seeing him here, roused all the old fantasies again, as if they’d ever faded. He shook off the thoughts. He had to get his head in the game. Three interviews and then prep. After that, he’d be performing, losing himself in the songs that would roll over the near-frozen bodies crammed into Times Square.
Everything was off. He thought about the words. He was sure he was hearing them not as a memory but as a type of prayer. He had no business hearing them. He was no angel. How was he hearing them? These were the things that were plaguing him as he drove, as he tried to escape, as he nearly felt his skull burst in two.
Dean could already hear his voice delivering the feeble explanation for their closeness, and at the same time he didn’t care. He thought that maybe he didn’t need to say a word. Sam wasn’t blind. He knew what was going on here.
Cas said, “Didn’t realize romance was a requirement.” Cas smirked back. “The campus also has a building with a forge and a department that practices making both medieval weapons and art.”
Before he could answer a low voice inserted itself into the conversation. “You guys the Winchesters?”
The waiter came over and took their orders. Castiel got a filet, and Dean just copied him. They got another round of beers too. “Do you guys always do the Cali Fest?” Dean asked.
Castiel gave him what he wanted, opening him up slowly. He kissed him through all of it, and when Dean was ready, squirming and begging for him, Castiel stopped and eased back to take in the vision again. “You're beautiful like this.”
In these quiet moments, Dean knew what it was he wanted, needed. He wanted this to be real. He wanted to have this and know that it wasn’t going anywhere. It was damn near impossible to make it a reality though. After all, the union of an angel and a human was an abomination. He heard it in the tone that Cas used. Dean didn’t need that though. He just needed to be close, to be able to freely have the small moments. He wondered if it would be too much to ask for more of that. He wondered if it would be too much to ask for maybe a little more.
“Tummy time.” Dean laughed, and Cas explained, “It’s something that the baby websites encourage. It supposedly will help them build up their core and enable them to roll over and crawl.”
“Alright, alright.” He leaned away when Ruby went in for another kiss. “We’ll be back at the hotel in less than 30. We can hold off a little.”
Jack gave his shoulder a little squeeze. “He knew you loved him.” Dean opened his eyes and felt anger at Jack for forcing this on him, this fake moment. “Look.” Dean looked.
“I bet that’s when they left,” Sam thought out loud. “They thought that Kali would do this to them. They didn’t know that this was different.”
It was an easy enough salt and burn. They found a very important dress, and they burned it. Easy peasy. They got on the road and were ten miles into the drive back, when Cas said, “We forgot the cribs.” They turned around and went back. Even with the extra time needed to drive out and back, they still managed to get on the road again by the late afternoon. They even had a good laugh about it.
I dug deep. I pulled out everything I had in my arsenal on car safety. I talked about how one should never drive with wires that are so loose that they could just fall off by some miracle. I talked about the fumes that the car produced, and how starting it in the state it was in could ignite those fumes. I laid it all on thick, very thick. Almost as thick as Cas’ arms… Seriously, I needed a hobby.
The gear was loaded, and Dean could hear the long drag of notes signifying the start of Fallen’s set. Dean picked out the notes that he knew belonged to Castiel. He was playing the opening to his song ‘Perdition.’ It was one of Dean’s favorites. It was simple and at the same time not. It was about friendship and the lengths one would go through to save someone. It was one of the first songs he’d ever heard from the band.
“You need a friend, just like I did in high school. And Lord knows I need a friend too. You were the only one that kept me sane during the end of that last tour.”
Castiel sighed, and his shoulders fell. It looked like he was resting his forehead on the glass. Dean felt sweat building up in his palms just watching him stand so close to that window, to a fall that couldn't happen.
“Yes.” And with that one word, he let his grace slide free from his vessel into her body. He settled into her, lifted her hands in front of his face and turned them over and back. He looked at his vessel. The body looked peaceful. Cas reached down into the foot well and pulled up a blanket that was there and covered his vessel so it would look like it was just sleeping and not dead.
When the last song ended and the crowd was still screaming, he looked to the wings and saw Castiel. He had his Caddy strapped onto his back. He was wearing a shirt now but only just barely. It was a white button up that had only two buttons fastened near his stomach. There was a lot of skin on display. He gave Dean a little wave and then moved out of the wings and out of sight. Sam was clapping his back and dragging them away.
Dean would say western attire, just to sound respectful. Sam would say cowboy clothes in the way that showed how he thought of the whole thing, like it was maybe a little silly. He’d called it Dean’s fetish a few times, maybe fairly.
“I mean,” he sighed, “never mind. Eat your burger. Maybe now you’ll let me check out the telescopes.”
“Well, Sammy, go get a good seat.” Dean gave Sam a hug on the way out, slapping his back a little too hard at the end.
“How can you tell? They just look like some college guys, probably from a fraternity or something. Those kinds of guys roll in the money, and they’re usually douche bags.”
They checked into their room. Sam got them a single, presumably because Cas didn’t need to sleep. Sam was just rude like that, Dean had thought. They brought in their bags and Cas gathered supplies. Cas did all of the set-up for the spell. Dean sat on the bed and watched.
Dean glanced back toward Cas and Claire. They looked like they were struggling with the boat back at the car. It was a funny little spectacle that made Dean warm and somehow even happier. “Long as he doesn’t do anything stupid.”
Cas smiled. “We’ll find time to talk more.” He leaned back to Dean’s ear and added, “I look forward to hearing more of your thoughts.”
Castiel noticed how Dean still wouldn't face him. “I'm sorry.” Dean didn't turn around. “I'm sorry about that, Dean.”
“Wouldn’t want her damaged by some careless college guys.” Dean opened the door for him. Cas looked at him funny, then went to the other door, the one to the back seat.
“Fine enough. I’m gonna go check up on Cas. Wanna come?” Dean reached out to Old Mo and helped him ease into the seat across from Sam.
It was a pleasant surprise to come home to the sight of the familiar black car parked in front of his house. He got out of the hired car that he’d used to get home from the airport, and the driver retrieved his bag. Cas slung it over his shoulder and tipped the man handsomely.
“Yeah.” Crowley got up and started pacing. “You know his brother’s still in rehab. The band blames him for that and the break up.”
“Who else would be capable of tending to the needs of a nephilim baby? I’m certain that this is the best place for them.” Cas shifted Samuel over to his other arm and leaned into Dean’s side more. He looked down at Ellie and smiled at her. “You want to stay with Dean, don’t you little one?”
Now Castiel just hummed in lieu of an answer. He stared at the screen in front of him. “We used to know each other.”
Thank you all for taking the journey with me. I decided to prune the chapter rather than break it into two chunks, so this is it. Hope you all enjoy it.
“They’re babies, Dean, babies. And don’t act like you aren’t already hopelessly attached to them.” Cas reached out and set his arm across the back of the seat of the Impala. He gave Dean’s shoulder a squeeze. “I’m not saying that there are no worrisome mysteries to solve here, but I am saying that there is no danger to us or your brother and Jack. I’d see it in them.”
He stepped closer. He wondered how many more mistakes he'd get the chance to make right now. Castiel had to know he was there, right behind him. Dean sucked in a deep breath and pressed himself to Castiel's back. Dean lightly set his hands on the backs of Castiel's hands. He breathed, his head hovering just over Castiel's shoulder. Dean's lips were near Castiel's ear.
"Of course," Dean said. He fell into step beside Cas and let his hand fall on his elbow. Cas hazarded a glance at him as they walked. It was getting harder, the shift from intimate to whatever was their new normal. It should have been okay. This was only the second time and just a relieving of tensions, a physical fix, but Cas loved him. He knew even from the start that it had always been more than that where he was concerned.
“We got kinda busy with these two.” Bobby came down the stairs first and threw one arm around Dean in a half hug. “By the way, this here is little Zeke and Mary’s holding little Brie. They came with letters, just in case you lot think I’d name a baby after a cheese.” Bobby turned his attention to Zeke and started making faces at him.
They both just continued to stare. Cas reached out a hand to show that his blade was gone. “Do you have names?”
Cas didn’t answer right away. He thought about the way Dean was, the things he said, the thoughts that sometimes came to him as drunken prayers. Dean wasn’t drunk tonight though. He thought of how warm he was at his side though, even tonight, the way he would casually just touch him for no good reason at all. “Yes, I think he would.”
He reached over to his nightstand and popped open a pill bottle. He poured out two pills and dry swallowed them. They were just sleeping pills. He knew his brain wasn't going to let him rest. He turned off the lights. He was afraid.
Dean pressed in closer. He let go of Castiel's arms to wrap his own arms around Castiel's upper body. “You wrote, 'I Want You Back.’” Dean kissed down into Castiel's neck just a little. “You sang about how profound it was, how being with me was like sparks behind your eyes burning out sleep, or some shit.”
Dean tipped his head back and closed his eyes. “Bobby spelled it out for me. I don't have a band. They all felt like I betrayed Sam when I put him into rehab.”
“It’s a little something my daddy made us. It’s just some ‘shine.” Ruby looked pleased with Dean’s response.
“Now, who would say such a thing?” She glanced away from him back into the room. He didn’t reply right away. “It’s plenty clear I’m alive if you’ve got eyes in your head.” She smiled to make the news of her living more palatable.
“I would. Their thoughts are pure. It’s refreshing to see such thoughts.” Cas was smiling, all soft as he stared out the window.
Cas sighed, “I'm unaware of any spell that would help us with that. Tracking down nephilim and rogue angels was always a difficult thing.”
“Dick move. Took a lot for him to accept the offer and then you just up and tell him you didn't mean it.” Bobby paused and then said again, “Dick move.”
“No.” The one word was delivered gently. Time passed, and Dean kept holding on. Cas muttered a few more words, none of them in English or even Latin. Dean would have known them. Cas’ thumb slipped once in a gentle arch along Dean’s wrist. Dean noticed it. In fact his whole world devolved to that one point of contact. There was a bare chance that Cas might repeat the move, and Dean was going to make sure that he tracked every miniscule bit of it. The feel of Cas there, the sudden warmth that traveled like a mad river up his arm and straight to his chest.
Castiel waited for the chorus and joined Dean’s playing. He didn’t sing. He just worked through the accompaniment. They sounded good together. Castiel wondered if it’d be the same if he took over the lead part, let Dean fall into playing the backup rhythm. Without warning Castiel just started playing the lead. Dean went with it. Castiel didn’t expect what happened next. Dean began singing.
"Sam," Rowena whispered the word, but somehow he heard her and looked at her. "I love you. You don't have to…" her words were cut off.
Dean was halfway to the door. He stopped but didn’t turn back. “I’m driving out to Hay tomorrow. Gonna take a little break.”
“Oh, but they do exist, and they tend to linger near humans that they’ve taken under their proverbial wings.” He stepped closer to her, and she let him. “I think he lingers here because you are here.”
"That it'll get easier. I also said that it was a long night preceded by many long days, and that perhaps we needed time to make things okay, find out footing and all that."
“Maybe that one with the dome.” Cas pointed to their left. “I read a bit about the campus last night while you slept.”
“I don’t know where Jack went, but my mom likely does.” Clark nodded toward the other side of the restaurant. “You need clothes. You can’t walk around with your junk hanging out like that.”
Dean's hand dropped to his, to Joan's. His fingers slipped between Cas'. And Cas couldn't stop thinking, not my hands, not my fingers, hers, hers, hers. They got to the building and stood at the doorway a moment. Once Cas walked through those doors he knew what would happen. They'd go back to the way they were, a thick wall between them.
Jack looked steadily at Cas and said, "I want to help them. I wish I knew the right words." He looked off at the door and added, "When I said it'd get easier, Kaia stormed off. I think I upset her more."
“Yeah.” Dean pulled off to the side and shut off the car. The engine ticked and cooled. “I don't want to mess things up this time, Cas.”
Castiel made short work of the shower and got dressed. Tight jeans and a grey tee seemed like a good choice. As he walked down the stairs he heard the door opening.
“You better believe it,” Ruby smiled as she said it. “Only the best for my boys.” She let out a whoop and got some looks from the more straight-laced members of the crowd. Dean kept the ‘shine. He would drink it all before the ceremony was over.
“I’m glad you annoyed that cosmic entity. I can’t even tell you how,” Dean stopped before the sentence ended. He didn’t know what to really say there.
“I’m a little surprised you don’t already know what’s going.” Cas’ lip curled up a little with the pronouncement. He moved over to the little chair that rested against the nearby wall and took a seat.
By the time he got to the 91 the tension seemed to fall off. Dean rummaged under the seat for a tape to pop into the deck. Finding a Zepp mixtape, Dean smiled. The volume was cranked way up and Dean started singing right from the middle of the song.
“He’s been hard to read lately.” Cas turned from the paper he was looking over. “Sometimes I can’t tell if he’s sad or angry or just bored.”
“I’ve heard of you lot. You are better allies than enemies. I just wanted to, shall we say, keep my enemies close.”
“Yeah, well they didn't begrudge the call to 911. They just didn't think the follow up was necessary.”
“He also told me that he knew who I loved.” He glanced at Dean. So many things can be made clear with a glance. They’d looked at each other a thousand times, maybe more. In all of those times, need and fear, longing and grief had been communicated. This glance was a punctuation mark of sorts, a hard stop on the word
“No all time, all band, all songs considered. It is the best. It’s…” Dean struggled for the right word and settled on, “Pure.”
Dean peeked past the edge of the changing wall. “Yeah, that goes without saying.” He paused, thought about Cas’ words, then added, “What’re you saying?”
He drove for a half hour like that, then his phone started ringing. Dean snagged it off of the passenger seat and answered it. “Heya Cas!” Dean had to yell over the wind and song. He wedged the phone into his shoulder, and turned down the volume. “Can't hear you. Give me a sec.” Dean started rolling up the window. “That's better,” he proclaimed.
“If you say so.” She got up and sauntered over to a different seat. “Can’t wait for Vegas. They’re gonna put us up in one of those penthouse suites. I’m gonna drink so much champagne.”
There was a moment before the end when Cas pulled Dean up to his lips by his neck. He kissed him deeply. Dean came then, gasping and holding onto Cas’ arms. He let Dean slip free of his mouth so he could look at him up close as his own moment arrived. He could count the freckles on him.
“I don’t care what he wants. I did this for him. I’ll wait ‘til he gets out. If he wants back in the life, then I’ve got his back.”
High school for them had been a carefully orchestrated thing. The three of them were all in the same sort of academic path. AP classes, as many as they could squeeze in, four years of math instead of the recommended minimum. Anna was certified bilingual, and Uriel earned his AA at the same time as he had earned his high school diploma.
He could touch Dean’s body anywhere and send healing to the injured bone. Healing Dean was never something he did quickly though. He let the touches linger. Dean’s body stilled beneath him as he dragged his fingers toward Dean’s shoulder, then his chest. He stared steadily into Dean’s eyes, counted his breaths, his heartbeats, the blinking of his eyes. He could lean down to him, kiss him, taste him again. He wanted to. His fingers grazed over Dean’s ribs. He felt Dean’s skin shiver beneath him.
She stepped up close to him and said, "I know his eyes were closed the whole time, and that it was your name he said when he came." She reached out to Cas then. "He loves you. Talk to him."
Now that Cas had said it, it seemed like it was going to be an ongoing mantra. Then Dean realized that the words were just in his head. “You heard me?”
“Wanna hustle some pool?” Dean nodded over to one of the tables in the corner. The group that was playing seemed happy and maybe a little drunk.
Dean leaned out the window a little with a cup of coffee. He smiled in that way that was so broad and genuine. “You gonna let me in? I got coffee.”
Dean didn’t say his name or cling to him afterwards. It seemed like this was just satisfying an urge. They moved onto the next case, and repeated the pattern of finding someone willing in the night. And like that, weeks passed. They were all just vessels, just bodies coming between them. Cas didn’t feel good about any of it. He wanted Dean to be happy though. He wanted to give him what he wanted.
He could see Dean growing more irritated the longer he went without hitting him back, so Cas swung a fist at him, pulling back his strength significantly. He connected with a rib low and on the right. He didn’t pull back quite enough. He could hear the bone crack a little, a hairline fracture, maybe. Dean stumbled back. “Oh, I’m sorry.”
He also wondered if Cas was having nightmares of the Empty. Dean knew that he’d struggled when he first came back human and a little lost. Cas had said that sometimes when he closed his eyes that it was like the world was falling away from him again. There was something like fear in the way he said it, and Dean had never heard Cas sound afraid of anything really.
Nightfall came and they had tried going out. Sam told them to just get dinner on their own and then went back into his room. They found a diner and ate together, then drove around the tiny town. Dean said, “Thought we’d find a bar. Guess not.”
And all Castiel could do now was shut off that thinking part of himself or end this. He didn't want to end this. Dean's tongue was velvety smooth and performing miracles.
Castiel cleared his throat and said, “Bobby said you'd be drinking by the time I got here.” Castiel turned away from the window and leveled his gaze on Dean.
“I bet she’s been waiting for you. You two were good for each other. I didn’t know you were thinking of getting hitched though.” Dean reached across the table. He set a hand on Sam’s. “Congratulations.”
Dean watched him for a moment before saying, “I didn’t know they were that close yet. I mean, I know he liked her a lot. She’s great. I just didn’t know.”
“This here is Dean's address.” He lifted up the notebook and showed it to Castiel. “You're gonna go talk to him. You get to fix this.”
“All of the ways that you left…” His voice rolled like a bit of thunder, gravely, just this shy of wrong. It did something to him. Castiel found himself leaning forward in his seat.
“You don't know her. She teaches at a school for the deaf in northern California. I met her when I was working that charity gig up there.” Sam looked down at his hands. “She didn't have a clue who I was.”
“Maybe. We’ll drag the beach stuff over so you two can sit on the sand, get your toes all gritty and work your way through the beer.” Sam clapped Dean on the back and headed to the car without waiting for approval. Claire followed him.
When Dean got up the next morning, he didn’t check out of the motel. Instead he paid for another night. “You never know. We might get lucky.” He winked at Cas and moved ahead of him toward the little diner next to the motel. Cas didn’t know what to make of the trip, and Dean didn’t seem to be trying so hard to find someone to help with his tension.
Dean dipped in again and kissed him slow, like he needed to memorize every bit of this mouth, the way it accepted him, wanted him. It may not have been Cas’ mouth, but it was Cas’ choices, responses, and actions. He was making this memory. It was his.
“The babies will be fine.” He settled into one of the chairs near the window. “I never thought you’d get attached so easily to babies. Have you always had a fondness for small humans?”
“Yeah, I mean, even I prayed for a reversal on that front. I was a bit more focused on other losses at that time though. She had a lot of regret. And she and Sam shared similar tortures at the hands of Lucifer. They have a little bond between them and the emotional loss maybe brought things to a head while I was out.”
Instead he nursed a beer and watched the people he barely knew flirt and laugh and ramble on about nothing at all.
Dean interrupted, “Yes. I want that.” He thought of all the times he just wanted to know what he was thinking, what he was feeling. He thought of all the times he just needed to hear his voice. He wanted this. He wanted this more than he could say. Cas pressed his forehead to Dean’s and a warm flow of grace slipped from Cas’s mouth to Dean’s. Dean felt all his muscles suddenly stiffen. He slammed back against the rough motel wall.
Dean found himself on the top floor of his complex, surrounded by neighbors he hardly knew. They did these social events at the pool from time to time in the summer. He only went to calm his nerves, find whatever distraction he could. Tomorrow would be Friday, and he was not feeling ready for that. He considered drinking the night away, but that might make things a little too much like before.
Dean wanted to ask Cas what was keeping him up, but he knew the answer. He didn’t need the words to confirm it. He could provide comfort even without words. He looked at him, at the way the blue light coming into the room seemed to highlight his features in a softer way.
As soon as they came into the bunker she walked right up to Sam and took his hand. “Another one,” Sam had said. He stood awkwardly staring between them and the girl. The bassinets were on the table behind him. Dean immediately went to them to see how they were. Finding them sleeping, he returned his attention to Sam and the others.
Cas watched him, lips parted just a little. His eyes were wide open now. Dean kept up his gentle touches. He considered speaking, asking if he was okay. Something in Cas’ eyes told Dean that he didn’t need to speak. Sometimes the two of them said more to each other with a glance than any novel ever written. Dean wondered if he was reading him right. There was a certain heat in the look Dean was getting now.
Instead of crawling into bed next to Dean, Cas opted to just peek in on him. Dean wasn't alone. Curled up beside him were Samuel and Ellie. All three of them snoring away.
“Well, this is going to be a hell of a big deal back home. I mean, we travelled to another dimension. We found other life. They have protocols for all of this. Like protocols that we broke without a second thought. They’ll likely be reluctant to send us back.”
Dean had assumed that he'd ruined any shot at further communication. He sucked in a breath and typed a response.
They'd stopped at a studio door with a red light glowing above, meaning someone was recording. “He's in there.” She pressed a long red nail to the door.”
“You mama hen. They’re fine.” Jody sounded distant for a second, but Dean could make out her saying, “Tell Claire to go to Lebanon, Kansas. Yeah, the bunker. No, don’t tell her about the babies. That’s half the fun.” When she spoke again, it was to them and not muffled. “Was gonna send Claire to deal with the Hastings Haunting. Now I’m sending her to Sam to help out there. You and Cas can take care of a simple salt and burn.”
Cas looked at him steadily and said, “I'm not much of an angel anymore, Dean. However there aren't many of my kind left so I'm tolerated in heaven. I've been so disconnected that I had to be told about the dwindling number of angels, so I doubt that I have what is needed to pick up on the nephilim.”
Sam leaned back and folded his hands behind his head. “Guess you really impressed the guy if he wants to have dinner with you.”
“Do you?” Dean didn’t wait for a response. He huffed out a great gust of frustrated sounding air and moved to the weights to start lifting. Cas moved behind him to spot him.
Dean cast a worried glance around the area. No one was there. He could hear a distant bird call out, and a little breeze that picked up some leaves near his feet. There was nothing else though, at least not that he could tell. The baby whimpered again, it’s little face looking like it was gearing up for a good cry. Dean reached down and picked up the bassinet. “You’ll be okay. You got a mom somewhere out here, buddy?” His voice was low and comforting. He carried the baby into the bunker and set the whole bassinet, on the table. “Sammy!” He called out.
“Breakfast. You haven’t eaten yet.” Cas pointed across the street toward a diner. “That one should do.”
He’d have pursued that line of thinking, but Sam interrupted his thoughts. “What?” It was a question delivered with a bit of dripping confusion.
Dean called back over his shoulder and said, “Plenty of weirder humans than me. Some people,” Dean coughs, “Sam,” Dean coughs again, “obsess over serial killers. Least I just like something cool.”
“Dean! I can’t...It’s got me! Shit!” The blackness seemed to stretch out into several long tentacles that wrapped around the pod. The tentacles pulled the pod toward the rift. The thrusters on the pod were working. Cas could see the pod straining against the tentacles in an effort toward breaking free.  The effort didn’t save him. In seconds, the light flashed, and Sam was gone.
“It's just that, no one could get through all of that in under a year. That's a three year job easy.”
“I wouldn’t say no to that. I won’t hold my breath though.” Castiel got up. The closeness was making him nervous. He immediately regretted the loss of warmth at his side, the lack of presence that Dean’s solid form offered. “Let’s work on ‘Careful’. Dean got up and walked over to the guitars.
“I’ll look at them when I’m ready. Come back tomorrow.” Castiel raked his hand over the strings of the acoustic guitar. He wasn’t playing anything, just filling the room with the sound. He hoped it would be enough to send Crowley away. “You want me to get this album together, right?”
Castiel set a hand on Bobby's shoulder and said, “Please help me fix this. Let Dean know that it was a misunderstanding.”
Claire rushed to Kaia and Jack and pulled them both into a hug. Mary came into the space, holding her grandchild. Bobby moved to the children and checked them for injuries. Of course nothing even came close to them. The relief was palpable.
“'Fraid you can't borrow her. I'm going to need to have her ready for our set, which is right after your set.”
“I’ve passed just fine. Ah, well. It is good that I have shown myself then. The rumors can die out, and I can stop seeming like a ghost to you lot.” She drank down another gulp of her beverage and stood. She fished out a coin to toss onto the bar.
By way of an answer, Cas just waved to the other corner where Dean had set up a kind of changing station. Dean went to it and started the changing process. He’d picked out a nice navy blue suit. It had been a little snug the first time he’d worn it. He was pretty sure it’d fit now. “I’ve crossed many thresholds to come back here.”
Cas worked out now, stomach crunches in the morning, and if Dean let his hands wander to Cas’ thighs, he wouldn’t, he’d feel the muscles there that came from the daily running that he did with Sam. He was strong, maybe stronger than Dean and Sam both. He said he had to be stronger if he was going to be of any use on a hunt. Dean thought that it might be more than that though too.
Castiel clinked his glass to Dean's. “It could have gone better.” He seemed to be trying for a smile, but it was too rye. Castiel tipped back a swallow of the whiskey. “I told myself you wouldn't show. I was shocked.”
“Bucky was his best friend from a long time ago. Cap thought he was dead, but he wasn’t. He was part of an experiment that made him into the Winter Soldier. There all caught up.”
“We do,” Gabriel answered. “Here.” Gabriel dragged a new file to the screen, a still of the phenomenon as it engulfed the Impala. It was very clearly a planet, bright and shining with the light of a sun.
Cas made his way to the door to greet Jack. Before he walked into the hall though, he looked back once more and let his lip curl up into a half grin that made him all the more attractive. Dean thought loud and hard about the affect of that look, and what a mouth like that was good for. He heard Cas laugh as he moved out into the hall. It was nice, and maybe more than that. This was what it felt like to really win.
Dean lowered the gun. “What the hell, Charlie?” Dean got up and moved toward the stairs as they came down. “Mom, Bobby, you never returned my calls.”
“No more so than what you had him do with the lady and her child. You showed him how to handle situations like this. Castiel did what you would have done. He loved you enough to follow your lead.” Jack looked back into the room. Cas was walking out and Dean was still just standing there.
Dean sent another text to Bobby. This one was filled with even more anger than the last. He was pretty sure he was going to be seeing him at any moment. Bobby would try to talk him down. It was how he was.
Cas grabbed his arm and said, "Or maybe you stick around, do the hard thing, try to face this. Don't run away. Don't abandon them again." Gabriel let his head drop a little. Then he nodded. Cas got up and headed for the hall. "I'll see you in the morning. Try working on your vessel for a bit. Fixing that seems like a good start. You can work on the bigger fixing later."
Things were different now though. He told himself that nothing could truly hurt her, but he sat there knowing that she could very well be hurt, and he didn’t like the feeling that stirred up in him one bit.
Dean was charming and kind. He was attentive and sweet in a way that made Cas feel special. He’d had tons of attention over his many years as a performer, but that attention always felt like it was fleeting and shallow. What Dean offered was something deeper, an attention that was selfless and warm.
“I don’t think you get it. You staying is better. You going is the worst.” Dean leaned down a little to get eye contact. “I don’t know how to make it any clearer, Cas.”
He felt the warm comfort of a hand on his shoulder. “You made it back.” Dean turned and looked toward the voice. “You have a nice drive in the country?” It was Old Mo, his weathered face all craggy with age. His head of grey hair was perched on top of a small body hunched over a bit by years.
“And you didn’t know how to teleport until you did,” Dean added. “And did you know that you were able to open up giant holes in the world that would let out evil demon creatures?”
They all agreed. “Let's go back to our room. We can order breakfast over there,” Luc suggested. They all started to head out.
Castiel held the boy's hand in both of his. “I know exactly what you mean. At the same time, I want you to know you are worth so much even without me in the picture. Love is love no matter where it comes from or who you give it to.”
Halfway into the song the platform began rising up behind them. Cas stood on it. He was playing a speedier version of the song. The whole piece changed then into something that was like a 1980’s big hair band, complete with the occasional high-pitched wail.
“I see that now. I just...” Castiel raked his hands through his hair, messing it up thoroughly before finishing, “I was surprised.”
Jack closed his eyes tight, and his nose wrinkled up a little as he did so. “I don’t know how to bring him back, but I didn’t know how to show you those other things until I did. I brought my mother back once when she died.”
Cas started to reach for Dean’s face, but he stopped. Dean was already leaning in, craving the comfort that only Cas could offer. “I promise.” With that Cas headed down the hall and away.
Michael eventually found him and dragged him to their seats. Sam and Ruby were maybe a little tipsy. “Stop drinking. We gotta perform,” Dean said.
“You always were a sap. Listen, me and Cas, we aren’t like that, all chick-flick. We just blow off some steam together and then pal around. Most of the time we spent together was either looking for you or hanging out here while I was healing.”
“Hello, Sam.” She reached out to his head and brushed back his hair. She put a flower over his ear. “For you.” She leaned in and kissed his cheek.
“Sit.” Castiel pointed at the chair across from him. He breathed in the steam of the coffee. It was full of cream. Someone with a heavy hand did this coffee up. He took a sip, and it was exactly the way he liked it. “Perfect.”
Cas looked up then too and seemed like he read into the moment. He started to move away from Dean. Dean could even feel Cas’ arm start to slide away from behind him. He’d been too much in his own head lately, and this moment felt like Cas leaving all over again. He felt a dizzying fear overtake him with that thought. Dean automatically clamped his hand tighter on Cas’ hip, and that stopped Cas’ progress entirely. Dean kept his eyes on the screen now, like he was reading it. He wasn’t. He was just letting the letters swim around on the sea of white.
Halfway through her journey into the woods, the world became silent. She stood and looked into the thicker woods where darkness was almost tangible. Danger was lurking. She could feel its approach. Though she’d had limited experiences with supernatural creatures, she knew of them and how to deal with them, at least in theory.
Jack just smiled at him all gummy and innocent and way too much like Cas for Dean to feel comfortable. “Okay, Dean. I’ll try again in the morning.” He turned then and moved back out into the hall toward his bedroom.
“Funny thing, a friend out in northern Virginia messaged me. He said he had a case, but that he couldn’t deal. He sent me the articles. I asked if he was connected to anyone in the town, and he said that he had someone there, but that none of that mattered. I asked him for more information, but he was on his own case, so he couldn’t get into anything deeper.”
Cas stopped walking a moment and reached up to Dean’s cheek. He was taller than Cas was currently by a fair amount. Cas pulled him down into a kiss. Dean went along with this willingly. He was gentle with Cas. He stroked his back as he deepened the kiss. Cas soaked in all of the little details. Dean seemed to pour kindness into each small movement. When the kiss ended, Dean just held him close, even rested his chin on top of Cas’ head.
Cas said, “It is much easier to tend to the babies at night if you have help. “I’ll go take care of your room.”
“Yes.” Rowena was conscious of her form. She did her best to seem small and a little timid. “I’m seeking information on angels.”
He had claimed or something like that. So Cas didn’t poke at his thoughts even though it might have helped. “I’m an angel, Dean.”
They started playing it together, and Dean crooned out the lyrics like they were meant for him. Maybe they were. Castiel was hard pressed to think of a single song he’d written in the last ten years that didn’t have a bit of Dean in the mix. It was something he told himself that he'd never admit, but in his heart, he knew the truth. Castiel was working through the song, without even noticing that they’d gotten to the part without lyrics. Dean was still singing though. Castiel tuned back into him.
“Sounds good. I’ll get these to you all in two shakes.” She moved off to the order window and put the tag up.
The crowd loved it. Dean dropped to one knee and pulled out a small box. He'd managed to slip a wireless mic into his back pocket. He pulled it out now and sang, “Maybe I'm amazed by the way I love you…” Dean held the last note a little long.
Cas interrupted his thoughts, saying, “I kept putting it off, thinking that I needed to be here to take care of the babies, to help you. There was always something. I have to do this though.” He wouldn’t look at Dean. He just kept looking into the bag at the unfolded mess inside of it.
Dean let his hand stay right where Cas had placed it. Cas’ own hand was warm on top of his. Dean flexed his fingers just a little, feeling Cas’ body a bit more beneath that shirt. Dean swallowed a little, and it sounded loud to him in the quiet room.
Dean tossed him a smile and moved past him into the somewhat dark restaurant. He spotted Uriel and Anna right away in the middle of the place and made his way over to them. “Hey there,” Dean said, all casual and calm. Cas wasn’t with them.
Ruby just shrugged and so did Sam when Dean turned to him. Michael was in the back, quietly brooding. He chose now to pipe in. “I think I should get to do some of the vocals at the next stop. I’m tired of just drumming away in the background.”
“You went behind my back. You,” Dean pointed at Bobby’s chest. “You had no business sending that out. And to Crowley of all people.”
“Will do.” They ended the call with the usual pleasantries. Dean looked out across the yard at the early morning sky. It felt peaceful now. Something in him felt different.
“Yeah, he’s probably right there. Most of this stuff fits me. Some of it won’t even come close to fitting Sam, and I’m pretty sure we just have some modern suits in Jack’s size.”
