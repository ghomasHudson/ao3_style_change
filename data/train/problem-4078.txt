Later that afternoon Cas pauses his work briefly to greet Claire when she comes over to pick up Jack for shopping. He also meets Kaia for the first time, and then watches from the doorway as the three climb into Kaia’s dark sedan together. Loud, thumping music emanates from the vehicle as it starts up and backs out of the driveway and he suppresses an urge to roll his eyes as he gives a cursory wave to them before closing the door. By the time they’re back, the clock is coming up on midnight.
“No wonder dad would never bring us here,” whispered Dean as he navigated around the circle, “He was probably hoping we’d forget how dumpy it is.”
“I love honey,” confides Cas, as if it’s a secret, “but I prefer it on wheat bread. White bread is just so… pasty.”
start by going to the bottom of this page and hitting "Next Chapter". That will take you to chapter two which is actually the first chapter of the story. At the conclusion of that chapter, make note of what chapter you'll be reading next and then use the button at the bottom of the screen labeled "top". That will return you to the top of the page. Then, select the button that says "Chapter Index". That button opens a drop down menu from which you can choose which chapter you'll be going to next. At the end of each chapter it's the same: a choice is presented. Make note of which chapter you're meant to read next and then choose that chapter from the drop down menu each time.
“You could do worse,” Dean laughed, finally able to free himself. It was a relief to release his stream and impossible not to groan in pleasure as he let it go. The two ambled back to their seats at the bar and it was as they settled back in and ordered another round that Dean noticed the place had gotten busier. It wasn’t crowded by any means, but their waitress was much busier now. He began to order the drinks two at a time as a way of compensating for the slower service while the two of them continued talking over old action movies.
“No Cas,” he said firmly, stilling his body for a second to look Castiel in the eye. “It’s different for us.”
Though his position was awkward, Dean laid on the reclined seat facing his friend and kept his limbs to himself with the exception of one tentative hand that he now reached out. He was watching his own hand as it came to rest, palm down, on Benny’s thigh. Neither of them was breathing. Benny didn’t move.
When Castiel finally jumped down from the tailgate, Dean snapped back to reality and returned his attention on the task at hand. He and Cas stood at the rear of the truck and helped boost up as many people as they could fit, each taking a seat in the bed of the truck. It was obvious that no one wanted to be left behind when that truck rolled out because they all pressed in tight and then proceeded to layer themselves higher, sitting on laps and then pulling the small children up on top. Once loaded, John pulled himself up into the driver’s seat while Sam and Jim climbed in on the passenger side. With Sam scrunched in the middle they pulled out slowly, cautious with so many packed into the truck bed. The body of the truck was riding low, wheel wells barely giving clearance for the tires to turn with so much weight on board.
The day is busy and that makes the time pass quickly. It’s already dark when he bids Hannah goodnight and leaves the office. Pulling up to the house he sees an unfamiliar car in his driveway. Rather than pull up beside it and block the garage door, he parks at the curb. Pausing at the mailbox, he grabs the mail before walking up the driveway to greet his possible buyer.
“The fuck?” he whispered, taking it all in as his eyes finally came to rest on Benny. Beaten and bloody, Benny didn’t look too much better than the other men. Sitting on the ground at the base of a dead tree, the man had one leg twisted awkwardly beneath him and the other locked straight. The jeans he wore were torn and stained with blood, especially his straight leg. From thigh to calf, the denim on that left leg was soaked in blood. At the edges of the big stain, the color was brownish while the center was still bright red.
He drives across town then, taking her to the nicest restaurant in town. It’s probably nothing compared to the fine dining she is used to in the city, but the Riverside Grill is part of the golf course and it’s truly the best this town has to offer. It’s cozy too, themed to look like a lodge. She takes his arm when he offers it and they walk inside. They even luck out and get seated in a booth near the hulking stone fireplace.  Starting off with drinks, they work their way through appetizers and a meal.
“Why would you say that she wasn’t herself?” asked Jack calmly, his face innocent and questioning like a child’s would be.
“You in a hurry to get going?” Dean asked him, not liking the idea of being left behind in the room.
As he continues turning pages, Dean finds that Cas will often draw multiple pictures of the same subject, viewing it from every angle. There’s a series of pictures that were obviously drawn at a park, children playing, an old woman feeding pigeons, a couple walking hand in hand, a dog laying in the sun. There are multiple renderings of most, each drawn from different angles. Past that are several images of old buildings, and then there’s a few bridges, some flowers, it goes on and on. They’re all beautiful.
“I would’ve thought you’d have accepted it by now. There’s nothing you can do. There’s nothing anyone can do.”
The lead handler, identifiable by the color of his shirt, which singled him out as an authority figure, looked him directly in the eye and said, “Do you wish to decline servicing him?”
“Not much. We got together and had dinner. We talked. He needed to borrow some money so I lent it to him. When we left the restaurant, he insisted that we go for drinks and took me to a club.”
Despite the oppressive melancholy of his thoughts, it was nice to feel clean again. As he was pulling a flannel shirt on over his tee, Dean couldn’t help noticing how rough he looked in the mirror. His hair was wild from having been wet when he fell asleep on it. After so many days of not shaving, his five o’clock shadow had begun to evolve into an actual beard. The pale skin of his face was blotchy and his eyes were hollow and sunken, red rimmed. With a deep sigh he returned to the bed and sat down cross-legged. He picked up his messy sandwich and resumed eating sloppily. It was good. Surprisingly good.
So, despite the fact that he longs to be deeply bitten and feel his alpha drink of him, Dean could never really consider himself to be unsatisfied. Besides, once he’s collapsed into a fucked-out heap, he’s always tenderly licked and cuddled. Loved. No matter where he and Cas are, when Dean looks into those wide blue eyes, he knows he’s home.
Jack greets the man at the desk as they approach once again. “Hey Garth, you got anything else for us?”
“Not yet,” he answered in a daze. “Crowley keeps saying the cops are on the way, but you know how he is. Doubt he called in the townies.”
With a ferocious appetite, his cock is devoured over and over. Cas’s fear is fading now, despite Dean’s obvious anger. With every slurp from his mouth and groan from his throat, Dean tells him not to be afraid. He might be mad, but he’s not going to bite a dick off in retaliation for being spied on.
“Thanks Dad,” he says gratefully, taking it from him and smiling even wider when he sees a can of Mt Dew being presented. “Are you going to bed?” he asks.
“If we had needed her, she would’ve come,” said Jody firmly. But, since everything’s under control at the moment, her schoolwork was the priority.”
There was nothing he could do about the disgusting mess in his underwear and it was getting worse by the second. So he turned and left with his only hope being that he might get out of the club before the wetness had a chance to soak through the thick denim.
It’s only when he turns off the television that Dean realizes the sun has set. While he’s been preoccupied, it’s gotten dark outside. Basically, he’s been giving a free show to any creep with binoculars.
Sadly, not only did he speak, but he’d answered questions. Even though the information he’d supplied had seemed innocuous at the time, there’s always the possibility that some small thing he’d said would end up bringing the law closer to his family. Realizing that brought a heavy sense of guilt down on his shoulders where it now sat heavily. He was powerless to banish it. And worst of all? He’d shown weakness. Normally, burying his feelings under bravado was second nature for Dean. So the fact that he’d shown such vulnerability today was adding a hearty helping of humiliation to go with his guilt and sense of failure.
Gordon shifts his weight, looks around tentatively. Dean chooses to continue. “It’s because there’s somethin’ out here that they don’t want us to see. Maybe it’s another group of survivors or a secret fuckin’ lab. I don’t know and I don’t fuckin’ care. I come out here for one damned reason, Gordon. ‘Cause they fuckin’ told me not to.”
“Fajitas,” his dad answers with a wide smile. “I thought it might be fun to make my own guacamole,” he adds, nodding towards a bowl of green goo sitting nearby on the counter. “Try it and see what you think?”
She rolled her eyes as she walked away and when she was out of earshot, Benny leaned in a little and softly asked, “Am I right? You got a fish on the hook?”
He was grinning as he watched Charlie and Gilda flit off to hide. Turning his face to the rock, Dean began counting again. Their game was even more fun with the girls playing, and after a few rounds several more maidens had joined in.
“Yes. Last time I was here I got off the elevator on the wrong floor. Basement level. Of course I returned to the elevator when prompted, but I keep thinking about it and now that I know there are armed guards posted, I can’t help but wonder what might be down there that’s so valuable.”
Tears sprang from his eyes and flowed freely as he garbled broken pleas into the mangy carpet, his body screaming for release while his dick held back his spend like a flood gate.
“And we’ll stay for the duration of your meeting as well,” added the security team’s leader, giving a reassuring nod to Simmons as if she were some soft hearted schoolgirl rather than a stone cold shrew Dean had been dealing with from the beginning. Knowing he’d been beaten, Dean gave a nod of agreement and dropped his eyes back to the contracts on the desk.
The best case scenario would be waking stiff and sore and filthy on the nasty floor of this bathroom and having to drag himself back to the facility looking and smelling like he’d been gang raped in an alley. It was hard to even imagine the worst case, but it probably involved waking up shackled in some psycho’s basement.
“He’ll have to stay until he’s had a dressing change with no fresh blood,” John said. “You know the drill.”
“Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention it. We have breakfast reservations at eight. A place called Crystal Palace. Have you been there?”
Soon they were all crowded around the table, building ambitious burgers and complimenting Dean’s cooking. Settling into the seat next to his angel, Dean cracked his knuckles before delving into the double stack he’d made for himself. His mouth was open wide, trying to fit the entire thing in for a bite, when his brother burst out laughing.
"When we've found a place that makes us want to stay, I guess. In the meantime it looks like the highway is our home."
“Damn,” he whispers. As the ringing dies down, Mr. Kline’s breathing becomes audible to him. The man is practically panting. It’s good to know that he’s as affected by all this as Dean is. Just when he’s beginning to wonder what will come next, the feel of cotton brushing over his skin brings Dean’s eyes open again. Cas has once more moved into position at Dean’s rear.
Having eaten his fill of pie, Dean tucked it away in the little mini fridge. But, half an hour later, he was still thinking about it. He tried to reason with himself. The last of that pie would still be there in the morning. But, he wanted it. It was there and he wanted it. So, still awake at midnight, he pulled the pie back out and began nibbling at it again.
Cas tipped his head to the side a little, clearly thinking about what this might mean; wondering about what Dean was trying to tell him.
"No, Sammy," he responded, as he tried to close the distance between then. "No. You can't give her credit for saving your ass tonight. That was us. Me and Jim and Dad. We're the ones who risked everything... put our lives on the line to save yours. This chick... no. This
Caught up in his thoughts, Dean didn’t respond fast enough to the question. From behind him, the agent leaned in and spoke directly into his ear, breath hot on his skin, and said, “Don’t be coy.”
Watching the boy turn the instrument over in his hands, Dean could only think how much it looked like a tiny version of a trident. It was cylindrical, one long line that was smaller in diameter than a finger. At one end, it split into three smaller lines. The tip of each was sharp.
“Yes,” Cas whispers, thrilled by the challenge. He pushes back up onto the palms of his hands, rising up on all fours as the two of them begin a slow grind. Dean increases their pace so slowly that he barely notices it, until suddenly he becomes aware of the slapping sound that their sweaty skin has been making with each thrust. How long that’s been happening, Cas has no idea. But, he knows that there’s pressure building in his groin and that he’s dying to jerk himself. He’s dropped down onto the bedding and risen back up again several times as they’ve fucked, and at this point he sinks down on his elbows. Bracing himself on just one, he snakes his right hand back to grip his shaft but Dean smacks his ass firmly and growls, “Do what you’re told, Cas. Don’t make me get out my whistle.”
Staying to finish with the client was his duty so Dean stayed. But, if he was to hold out any hope of being able to blow cum on this guy’s face for him, he knew he’d have to conjure up a pretty good fantasy.
When he’d finished, Dean felt himself slipping away. Without a thought for how sticky they’d be upon waking, Dean used the last of his energy to wiggle closer to Cas, to tuck their bodies together comfortably, and to kiss him again. Both the men hummed softly as their lips touched and they lingered that way for a few heartbeats.
The idea seemed almost elegant in its simplicity. Dean already knew how it felt to curl up in bed with someone you love, spend Christmas morning with family, ride go-carts, hunker down with a tub of popcorn in a darkened movie theater, play pranks on your brother, tickle your lover, and a thousand other things. And these things, these little things, were what people lived for. And Cas had never experienced anything of the sort. The only human life Castiel had lived had been filled with constant hunger, filth, and fear.
Despite the constant cool temperature of their subterranean lair and the harshness of concrete floors, Dean had always felt cozy in his room here as long as there was soft lamplight shining. That’s why the lamp remained on almost constantly, sometimes even during the night while he slept.
Though angels supposedly didn’t sleep or need rest, Cas had often been the exception to that rule - especially when he was compromised. Watching his angel for a moment, Dean had to acknowledge that he liked seeing him like this. It wasn’t right, he knew that. He should want Cas to be healthy, operating at full power, the most perfect and glorious version of himself. But, it was impossible to deny how much he liked seeing the human side of this celestial being… the one who loved peanut butter sandwiches and juicy burgers, the one who watched television for hours on end and became emotionally invested, the one that Dean could actually relate to and understand. The one that Dean might actually have a chance with.
“Oh yeah?” he replied, craning his neck to try and get a look at the man for the first time. “What bright future am I turning my back on to work here, huh?” His question was genuine. He had absolutely no idea what he wanted to do with his life. Unlike his little brother, who had always dreamt of becoming a lawyer and fighting for justice, Dean didn’t have a noble dream. He often wondered what, outside of hunting or whoring, he might eventually do with his life. Sadly, there were no strong inclinations. So, if he could eat up a few of their ninety minutes listening to a competent man make some viable suggestions, then that was a win as far as Dean was concerned.
“You don’t get to do this,” he griped angrily. “You don’t get to just show up and put this on me. You’re not gonna just dump your shit on me and then skulk off to turn yourself over to the devil. You’re gonna fight this Sammy. We. We are gonna fight this. Crowley may be the devil, but he’s gettin’ his smarmy hands on you over my dead body.”
“No,” he admitted, having now deemed that this line of questioning to be safe. “No, I’ve never been down there.”
“I gotcha,” Dean said, reaching down into the car to wrap his arms around the man at his waist. “Now gimme a hug,” he added, encouraging Benny to hang on to him tightly as he was pulled up and out of the car.. Dean had found that by keeping their bodies tucked in close, the lifting was easier. They’d nearly perfected this stunt by now, Dean pulling the man to his feet and turning him as though they were dancing. Smooth and easy, he then lowered the man into the waiting chair. Benny’s face was contorted in pain when Dean stepped back, but he’d managed to keep quiet as he was moved and even use his arms to minimize the weight on his legs.
When the rest of the group burst out laughing, Cas only flicked the tiniest tease of a smile and Dean loved it. He loved that it was like a secret he’d stumbled upon, the hidden amusement of a very composed man.
The house is quiet downstairs, which is odd. Wondering why no one is cooking breakfast, he heads down. His father and Uncle Bobby are napping in the living room, John stretched out on the sofa and Bobby in the recliner with a book perched on his chest as though he’d fallen asleep reading it. No one else is around and it’s quiet as a grave.
“Someone who can do something for him,” she replied, her coldness returning now that her boss was gone.
Now that Dean was living in the pool house on his brother’s upscale, gated property, Dean had lost more than the degree he’d been pursuing. He’d lost his self-respect as he’d found himself dependent on his little brother for support. He’d begun avoiding his parents because he couldn’t stand the look in their eyes when they saw him now.
“C’mon Dean,” prodded the bearded man. “If I offered to trade your brother for your father, would you agree?”
“That was a wild night,” he ventured, wondering if talking about the only common ground they had might help them move forward.
Headed towards home, Dean contemplated how to save his brother. His mind churned, turning the problem over in his head and re-examining it from all angles, but any plausible strategies evaded him. He was powerless against this foe, having nothing to offer besides his own determination. Dean was simply out of his depth.
Cas didn’t speak. But he dipped his head in a nod of agreement. Simultaneously he pushed back a bit too… letting his ass push against Dean’s package. Encouragement. With fevered fingers, Dean tore Cas’ jeans open, the belt clunking as he jerked the man's pants down to his thighs. Cas picked his head up, looking around the parking lot as Dean cupped handfuls of Castiel’s gorgeous ass.
The young blonde appeared a bit uncomfortable at hearing his admission. To her, the word probably carried a stigma. Admittedly, it did for most people. It must for Dean as well, otherwise he wouldn’t get off on hearing himself called one.
“Scared? Hell yeah. I’m pretty sure everybody feels it, at least a little. If they’re not scared, then they’re fuckin’ stupid. I mean, it’s a big world out there, right? Lots to be scared of. Legit stuff too, not just things like being lonely or being broke. Have you read the stats on campus rape? Yeah, Jack. There’s stuff to be scared of. But we’re gonna do it anyway. We’re gonna go out there and fuckin’ do it because, well, what is life unless we live it, right?”
His hands, he found, had gone limp and now hung at his sides passively as a writhing mass of bodies worked around him. Crowley was stepping back to watch with approval and Dean could feel Alfie trading licks with someone else as they moved over his wet shaft together. They sucked his balls in turn and flicked tongues over his tip while his member throbbed insistently with the urge to cum. At the same time, his crack was being pulled open and licked, fingers toying with his pucker and escalating his want to new heights.
“Weak,” his friend answered. Of course they were. Blood loss. In his mind, Dean was on the fence about whether to try and carry the man out, or concoct some sort of homemade stretcher out of branches.
Because sleep was intermittent, Dean heard his parents when they started mating. This was not the first time he’d overheard them. It had happened before and, though it was a bit gross, he didn’t really mind it. It was just part of life, right? But this time, his body reacted. It was strange to find himself growing hard to their noises, especially since the idea of fucking a mermaid did nothing for him.
“It’s a resting day for me,” he replied, trying to hold the man’s eye rather than be caught checking him out.
“But you are in touch with him. You make up lies to tell him because his opinion of you means everything, right?”
“... Mary…” Amara said to the group, “… mate of John, daughter of the deceased Samuel and Deanna, has conceived…”
Already he could feel his body relaxing from the massage and it was tempting to just let himself rest. Instead of surrendering to temptation he picked up his head and addressed Lydia, peering around Maggie to make eye contact. “Hey Lydia,” he said, “I need to make an appointment to speak with someone in HR. You could set that up for me? I mean, that’d give Maggie a chance to see how it’s done, right?”
But, having witnessed so much through the binoculars, it was safe to say he’d been hooked. Since then, he’d fought the inclination to spy on those he was attracted to. Over the years, he’d managed with varying success. But, he’d never managed to fully extinguish the fire that Meg had lit in him all those years ago.
The school, as part of a daily lesson, had watched as a new prisoner was brought in and bound. He’d been sentenced to three cycles of I and S. That was short for isolation and starvation. They’d all watched quietly as the Prisoner tried to be strong and not admit that he was afraid. But he was. And it was easy to imagine why.
Groaning, Dean continues pacing back and forth across the living room as his brother starts listing off suggestions of how to fight this supposed post-holiday depression, despite the fact that he hasn’t been diagnosed with it. Well, not by anyone with a medical degree anyway.
Slowly dipping his targeted gaze, Cas comes to focus on the man’s lap. With his legs folded as they are, the towel is pulling open. It gapes to reveal a lean thigh and with a slight twist of his wrist, the binoculars are zoomed in close enough to reveal the texture of his tanned skin and sparse leg hair. Cas has to cup himself to relieve the pressure that’s begun building in his groin, and he takes a deep breath to calm himself as he does it. His own body movements cause him to lose the sweet spot where Dean was in his sights and he ends up having to zoom out again just to get his bearings. It winds up being a blessing in disguise.
Knowing he might be on his own for a while before finding his pack, Dean takes a pistol with him. Sneaking over the wall and out onto the plain, he starts whistling as soon as he’s far enough from civilian homes to not be heard. Tonight the tune is Misty Mountain Hop. He hikes for at least ten minutes before hearing the first answering howl and that seems to indicate his furry friends had been quite far away. Cresting a rise, Dean catches movement in his peripheral vision on the left. Immediately he draws the weapon, relieved to have it. Whatever’s moving out there in the dark is no friend of his. If it were, it would’ve announced itself.
Pumping his hand relentlessly, the soreness setting into his bicep is easy to ignore because he just wants to get there. He’s rocking rhythmically on the buzzing toy now and the way it tugs at his rim with each repetition is sending pulses of pleasure up into his groin.
“It’s coming,” he whispered hopefully. Sadly, the extraction wasn’t an immediate success. It wasn’t until after he’d hit bone a third time that he successfully got a clamp on the bullet. “I got it,” he said, stilling to steady his hands. “If you fuckin’ move an inch, I’ll lose it.”
“Cassie,” she said, using Gabe’s pet name for him, “You’re a wonderful young man. You’ll meet the right one someday… it just takes time. There’s a lot of A-S-S-H-O-L-E-S out there to sort through.”
Anger turned Crowley’s face bright red in the blink of an eye - the man was visibly seething. Until now, the ringmaster’s confidence and calm demeanor had made him seen unshakeable, invincible. But in the space of a few seconds, Dean was starting to see cracks in the man’s poised exterior. He was leaning into Ruby’s face as he shouted, “My mother? You’ve betrayed me to my witch mother? You ungrateful demon whore -”
“Well, Cas,” Dean coaxed as pressed kisses into neck and shoulder, “I just need to know if you’re my good boy or my bad boy.”
No one says anything that first morning when he comes in after sunrise. His mother seems curious, but doesn’t ask. His father and Bobby share a look, but also don’t ask. Based on the demeanor of the older men, it would seem that they assume he’s been out getting laid. They’re not wrong. But, since they seem unconcerned, they are probably imaging Dean as having had a far different kind of night from the one he really had.
Entering the gallery was the same heart pounding experience it always was, and as he scanned the room looking for someone who piqued his interest, Dean’s eyes wandered slowly over the crowd. There was a man who caught his attention sitting near the back. He was obviously trying to blend in and doing a terrible job of it. Practically swimming in an oversized trench coat, he looked nervous and ready to bolt for the door the moment that Dean locked eyes with him.
In response to the sound, Castiel’s attention snapped from the young man in front of him to land on Dean. Through the mask and from this distance, it was impossible to tell if Dr. Cum Control was looking at Dean angrily or just looking at him. But just to be on the safe side, Dean dropped the bottle to the floor and tried to look repentant. In response, the mask changed shape to accommodate a smile which seemed to be spreading over Castiel’s face. Dean smiled back and tried not to feel the loss when his Dom turned his attention back to Kevin.
Dean’s green eyes blinked, and Cas could see him searching for something to say. Rather than wait to see what the man came up with and risk it being lackluster, Cas stood then and gave Dean a heavy handed smack on that perfect ass. The sound of it was muffled by the covers but it brought laughter easily from both of them… a lighthearted moment as Cas moved the half dozen long strides to the door. He forced himself not to look back as he stepped out.
Dean was limp, holding on by a thin thread, hoping not to cum before they even started. He’d talked a big game to her. It had been foolish, he realized now, thinking that he could orchestrate and enjoy a threesome when he’d never even had sex before. Now, praying for the strength to hold on, he tried to find himself. He flexed his fingers, curled his fin, picked his heavy head up from Pam’s shoulder and looked over at Cas.
“I think I’m adorable,” he preened, loving their comfortable banter and allowing himself to relax a bit.
As though the lightbulb has just come on in Sammy’s mind, the kids face lights up. “For the wolves,” he breathes excitedly.
Yesterday when Dean had received his first paycheck, he’d told Cas he was ready to look for his own place. It should feel like good news. After all, they’d been sharing a bed that was much too small for them. Unless they were spooning, someone’s knees and elbows were hanging over the side. Additionally, they’d been stepping over Dean’s boxes and struggling to share an efficiency bathroom. Cas really didn’t have enough space to be sharing with anyone. So why was the thought of Dean moving to his own place so unpleasant?
As she takes a deep drag, he turns away from her and watches the water roll past them. Here in the shade, it looks dark green - almost brown.
In shallow water, the changes that occurred as the high tide swelled or receded were obvious. Here, in the deep water, it was barely discernable. That’s why their society needed the Singers, who felt the change and then swam through the community, announcing the arrival of a new cycle, with a song that all could hear. Singers also, because of their sensitivity to their environment, were an asset to the Watchers who vigilantly patrolled the waters of their Community for any sign of danger.
There were times when Dean thinks that Sam might have been wise to him. Honestly, that was fine. Dean didn’t give a shit if his brother knew he’d quit hunting. He just didn’t want to have to admit what he’d really been doing with his life. It was one thing to accept that sex was all he’d ever really been good at and embrace it. It was entirely different to come out and admit that he’d embroiled himself in the world’s oldest profession or, worse yet, that he fucking loved it.
Yes, this was someone to fear, he felt it in his bones. The fact that she'd saved his brother from Crowley didn't make her any less of a threat than her predecessor.  "You see," said Rowena, turning her attention back to the group, "for all my son's failings, he had a brilliant idea. This enticement-on-wheels was a perfect venue to mingle with humans while their guard was down and sniff out the most desperate among them."
Dean was stunned. Not only was he floored that Benny was so openly discussing something so taboo, but that he didn’t seem put off by it at all. There was zero judgment on the man’s face as he stepped away.
When they finally called it a day, Dean suggested they go “someplace nice” for dinner to celebrate the tremendous progress they’d made. Claire quickly agreed and suggested a trendy steakhouse. Upon arrival they were seated in a round booth. Dean had to turn his head and laugh discreetly when Claire ordered a frozen margarita with a shot of Jose Cuervo on the side. The waiter asked for an ID and in response she flashed her FBI badge at him. She sold it with such a put-upon expression that it was impossible to keep a straight face.
Pulling up to the curb, Dean nodded stiffly to acknowledge the things his brother had said and then turned off the car. When they climbed out, Sam made a run for the door, but Dean didn’t. He took his time and let the rain soak him. Heavy in his wet clothes, he let the torrent rush over him and tried to imagine that it had some kind of cleansing power.
That declaration had him spinning around. It was followed immediately by a barking voice that answered, “Don’t call me Cassie. I’m not a mermaid.”
The lion's share of his income was automatically divided between a savings account and a retirement account. Those balances were considerable, but they were inaccessible to him at this moment. He wasn’t worried about his money, though, because the accounts were legitimate. His money would stay put, even if Dean didn’t. It would even grow with the interest it earned.
Dean lay there underneath his lover, his belly and cock pressed heavily into the mattress, throbbing between his legs as Cas rolled his hips smoothly down into him, sucking the back of Dean's neck the entire time. He'd never felt so possessed in his life… so completely and fully owned by another person. It lasted a long time, and when they came, Cas held Dean tightly.
While Sam was speaking, Jim's words began having their desired effect. Dean watched as Ruby bent under the weight of the magic and began to cough black smoke. Looking back across the void at Cas, Dean tried to keep his eyes there. But, it was too difficult. He gave up and let himself watch as his brother’s face flicked back and forth between love, pity, and anger, while Ruby fell to the ground writhing and begging for mercy.
When the song changes, Benny strip his shirt off and flings it carelessly to the ground. Following suit, he peels his off his own. Before he can even drop it to the ground, there are hands on his bare skin. Swept up in the wave of bodies, Dean moves to the music and lets himself be touched. Every touch is amplified now that it’s skin to skin and Benny is looking at him hungrily as they move sensually among the others. Fingers tickle down his back, flutter at his sides, tickle over his nipples. He’s sweating now and the displaced air from his movements cools his pasty skin. When he opens is eyes again, he’s looking into Benny’s blue ones. There’s a hand cupping his cock and he feels it clamp down. He loves it. Pushes into it.
That following week, Dean put in a request for time off from the restaurant in hopes of not being scheduled to work on the night of Jimmy’s big party. But, when the schedule was posted, his name was there. Apparently everyone else had put in a request too. So, as one of the least senior of the staff, Dean was stuck working. He, Jo Harvelle and a few others wound up closing that night and afterwards they all caravanned over to Jim and Cas’s place. When they arrived, the party was already in full swing. Jimmy hadn’t been kidding - the party was epic.
He passed off Gabby to his brother when his phone alert went off, unable to hold back a smile at the possibility of another message from Dean. His attitude didn’t go unnoticed by his big brother.
“So anyway,” says Dean, “After I’d gotten the report from Singer, me ‘n Sammy talked about it. I told him that you’d been deemed relatively harmless, well, so far as stalkers go anyway. I explained that I’d actually met you a few times and that you’d never really set off my ‘creep-o-meter’ or anything. He basically told me to still be careful. I think he was afraid I’d let my guard down and wind up chained to a pipe in somebody’s basement.”
“If I need to see something scary,” teased Cas, “I’ll just hit the showers when the bearded lady is in there.”
“It’s the first day and I haven’t even walked in the door yet,” he retorts. “Be proud of me when I’ve actually done something.”
Dean nodded, his eyes dropping to the floor as he schooled his expression. The weight of the emotions settling over him now could have easily forced tears from the corners of his eyes and that was not something he’d allow his friend to see.
Last time they’d been at Jack’s mercy, he’d spared the brothers. But, it seemed doubtful that kind of mercy would be extended again. This time, Jack would likely kill them.
Hearing that, Cas was stunned. Had they been there at the same time and not even seen each other? “We ate at Crystal Palace this morning too,” Cas said.
On the highway leading out of town, the car was quiet. The air hung heavy between the brothers, both of them lost in thought. John had moved all over the country in the years following Mary’s untimely demise and Dean couldn’t help but think how ironic it was that when they’d finally put down roots somewhere, they’d done it less than three hours from her resting place.
Jimmy opted out of pie, choosing instead to nurse his beer as the other men dug in. He only stayed for a few, heading out when Benny did and leaving Dean the rest of the pie. After they were gone, Dean gave himself a pass on cleaning anything up. He settled in the couch with second piece of pie and a tall glass of milk and started flipping channels. He caught the tail end of an old movie he loved and when it was over, he got up.
He’s got days and days left here in Florida, and it would have been so fun to spend that time with Cas. He’s enjoyed every moment he’s spent with Cas so far. The guy is fun to be around. He’s smart too… but not so smart that it’s pretentious. He’s also sexy as hell; even his voice inspires lust. And the guy knows what he likes, what he wants, where he’s going. Cas is certain of things. In a sea of young men and women who measure their life by the number of likes on Facebook and devote way too much time to taking selfies, there’s Cas. The guy sticks out like a sore thumb from his peers who constantly talk themselves up. Cas is genuine. It was so nice to spend time with a guy who never once looked at his phone while they were talking. And he’d managed to blow it.
“I’ve held up my end of the bargain,” he reminds them, “I’ve been honest with you guys about things that are very personal to me and it only seems fair that in return, you cut me some slack.”
The response from Benny is a stinging slap, first to one cheek and then to the other. Over the din, Dean hears the man shout back, “That’s right, you take it how I wanna give it, brotha.”
The friends continued on, seeing several other schools of fish as they drew nearer to the Big Garden. They could see the ocean floor now, dappled with the glow of illumination from above. There were patches of grass here, billowing as the water moved in undulating patterns. Life stirred around them; crabs moving through the grasses, fish darting this way and that.
Hoping that it wasn’t too late to do so now, Dean covered the last few miles of two-lane asphalt promising himself that he’d do better this time. No matter what state she was in when they entered the dungeon, he’d approach her with understanding and love.
Once his hole loosens up, the burning abates and in its wake is a buzzing sensation that slowly envelopes him from the waist down. Then, as his cock starts to fill again, Dean loves to feel it swinging beneath him in time with the thrusts. Always now, he looks around to see the eyes of those watching him from nearby and when the mood strikes, he has taken to showing off a bit. He throws his head back and arches his back, pushing back into the heavy thrusts he’s taking, allowing his own pleasure in that moment to drive them wild. None have ever dared approach him for a turn, probably because they know better. Dean’s dark wolf likely keeps them observant of some invisible boundary.
“That’s my Lizzie,” he said affectionately. “Elizabeth. She ain’t blood, but she may as well be. She’s got no daddy so that’s what she’s lookin’ for, if ya know what I mean. I make it my business to run off all the fools that only want the job for one night.”
Locking eyes with Dean, as though his private thought had been heard from across the room, Mr. Crowley cut through the bodies to approach and practically purred as he said, “Well, well. Hello Cowboy. You ready to be rode hard and put away wet?”
Considering how dumpy the exterior had looked, the inside was impressive. The crowd was young and fun. Country music was blaring and the there were rowdy whoops and hollers coming from the opposite end of the bar. Following the chaos, Dean cut through the crowd and found that half the dance floor had been temporarily given over for the purposes of setting up a mechanical bull. Dean couldn’t help but smile as he paused to watch from a distance. The bull was surrounded by air cushions, both on the ground and in a circle around the bull. Anyone thrown would land softly. The name of the rental company was imprinted on the cushion which had the look of a giant inflatable kiddie pool. The only difference was that instead of being bright blue or green as pools usually are, this plastic was done in shades of brown. The ground was dark brown like dirt and the inflatable walls were printed with the image of fence posts. The effect was a cartoonish bullpen with a very real-looking mechanical bull at its center.
"Oh no," he whispers, waggling eyebrows at his alpha. "Don't go thinkin' you get a night off just 'cause it's Christmas."
The girls were already three drinks deep when Dean was paraded in, so they were extra loud as they greeted him and playfully turned him over a barstool for birthday spankings. The crowd was boisterous and bawdy as they counted along, the girls taking turns to deliver playful swats with a wooden spoon. It was all in good fun, but by the end of thirty licks, Dean’s ass was stinging. He joked about it as he made his rounds, accepting well-wishes from all his guests. Thankfully, John Winchester was conspicuously absent.
He’d still prefer that other people not know the full extent of his relationship with Cas, but he’s come a long way from being the kind of man who would kill to keep his secret safe. Hell, these days even if people found out about him and were disgusted by what he’s been doing, none could argue that they hadn’t directly benefited from it. As such, Dean is considerably less worried. He’s not going to tell anyone, of that he’s certain. But if he’s found out, he wont deny it.
“Naw,” the man answers. “I kinda need a hand with somethin’ in the garage… came to see if ya had time to help me out.”
“No,” sighs Gabe as he stretches and lets out a yawn. “I think I’ll head up to bed. We’ve got a big day tomorrow.”
Sure, the alpha is his. But that doesn’t stop the females from going into heat, and it certainly doesn’t stop the wolves who are second and third in command from following the example of their leader. Jumping at the opportunity afforded them, the two fuck like stallions. And sure, there are a few horny wolves in the pack that prowl around the precocious females in hopes of a turn, but they’re quickly put in their place by the younger, healthier, and more dominant males. The strongest in the pack are the ones who get to breed.
“I think there’s been a mistake,” he told her calmly, “I’ve been on for two days but they’re telling me it’s been three.”
“They were just little reef sharks,” Sam explained. “I guess I don’t really know what provoked the first bite, but once there was blood in the water, they all started in on us. There were so many.”
“Good to know,” says Claire, flicking her hair over her shoulder. “Only a week of prison rules and then we can start skipping classes.”
Rounding the corner and approaching Mr. Winchester’s classroom, Jack finally falls into step with Claire. “I’ll hit that with you after school though,” he adds, wanting to make sure that she still plans to walk home with him as usual.
Cole opened his mouth to argue and Dean cut him off. “No way. This is my thing. She ain't comin. Pick someone else.”
Cas. Cas who had kissed him and accepted him and wanted him. Cas who had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen. Cas who he’d thought of and dreamt of and wished for ever since. Thoughts of his blue-eyed boy pulled Dean to the admission gate like a moth to a flame.
“Hollywood Studios has a playground that’s themed after the movie ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’. It’s really fun, and there’ll be other kids there she can play with. I thought we’d start there.”
Leaning into his son affectionately, Castiel nudges the young man and gives him a wink, “You were slow to learn in that area,” he teases. “You were almost four and still pooping your pants all the time. I was at my wits end.”
Less than five minutes later, the men are both leaning back with a hand on their stomach, and Dean can’t help the mournful tone in his voice as he says, “I can’t fuckin’ believe it. I’ve never stopped at two pieces of pizza before.”
Having worked together, he and his wolf have managed to expose his the flesh of his ass and now that it’s bared to the room, several wolves begin to growl aggressively from nearby. Dean’s always liked the way they watch him get fucked, especially the aggressive noises they make as it happens. Eager to take things to the next level, he pulls his knees up under him and arches his back. This new position is intended to entice. Dean’s eager as he continues to suck more urgently, bobbing his head up and down on a perpetually growing canine cock.
Judging by the suns position in the sky, Dean’s pretty sure he's got enough time. Looking up to the place where he'd last seen his mate, Dean finds the magnificent creature sitting proudly as he watches Dean bathe. As their eyes connect, Cas gets to his feet and walks to the waters edge. Rising on his hind legs first, the dark wolf executes a flawless flying leap into the water nearby. Upon surfacing, the ware and paddles leisurely over to him.
“Mitch” he replies, reaching out for a quick handshake as though they’ve just been introduced. And, technically, they have. Though the man’s face is familiar to Dean, they’ve never actually spoken to one another before. Racing around to jump back in the cab again, they pile in together to return to the gate. Dean drives wildly through the empty streets and Mitch looks over at him in the dashboard lights and says, “Your old man must be in a bad way.”
Sam's posture is defensive, but Dean knows it isn't because he doesn't want to hear what's being said. It's because the things Dean is saying ring true. Perhaps his own wife has said similar. Knowing that his message has been received, Dean gives his brother more thing to think about. "You've grown up to be a good man, Sammy. But your kids don't need the memory of a good man. They need
“See you for supper,” he called out as they exited.A home cooked meal at Jody’s place sounded far better than nuking taquitos at the Gas-n-Sip. Cas didn’t say much as they got into the car and drove. Dean watched the road signs, selecting the truck route which was usually the best way to locate a cheap motel room.
“Great,” he said acerbically, remembering their recent escape from a government stronghold and into the Rocky Mountain National Park. “It’ll be good to get back to the woods,” he added sarcastically. “It’s been too long since I was covered in mosquito bites and chiggers.”
“You’re such a goof,” teases Claire from beside him. Returning his attention to her, he gives her a smile and she hooks her arm through his. Bending his arm to cradle hers, they lean into one another for a step. They’ve only gone a few more paces when she gently pulls him to a stop. Turning, he sees her peering around him to look at the mill so he turns too. They stand together arm-in-arm for a moment and just look.
He laid on his mattress for a long time, fuming and frustrated. Then, when he’d finally calmed enough to trust his temper, he called for a handler.
Dean relaxed incrementally as Cassie worked on him, losing himself in the predictable steps as she went about her duties. He didn’t miss the way her eyes roved appreciatively over his naked form while she spread warm wax over the traces of his bush and laid strips of paper onto him. Clenching his jaw and closing his eyes, Dean tried not to flinch as she ripped them away because he always wanted her to be impressed with him. He absolutely loved being her favorite.
“It was too much,” he repeated, more firmly this time. Indignant now, anger began welling up inside of him and it made him strong. “You made me think you were after my family. You used my brother against me. It was too fuckin’ much. And now, what, you think I’m gonna just join up on your side? Testify against my boss even though it’ll lose me every penny I ever earned and possibly get me killed?”
He had also enjoyed spending time with the other chaperones, turning acquaintances into friends as they lingered on the periphery of their children's activities and got to know one another. Now that they are back home, Cas finds himself feeling renewed. It’s almost as if he’s had a real vacation.
A swell of joyous celebration rose from those gathered and Dean watched in awe as merfolk launched themselves up into the circling bodies above. It was pandemonium for a while as everyone eagerly moved into position and began to spread out over the area.
The response he gets is predictable. A soft nickering in the back of the wolfs throat that signals contentment and a single happy thump of his tail. Drifting off to sleep together is bliss.
“You’ll get your turn,” he grins. “And so will you, Spazzy. I just wanna get a minute with this little guy before he eats himself to death.”
There was no shortage of assholes either. Apparently, everyone thought that spending an assload of money to come here entitled them to behave as abhorrently as they cared to.
His body bowed as it was filled up, and his legs tried to spread wider but couldn’t because his jeans were still wrapped around his knees.
Sam nodded his agreement, and then Dean pushed the door open. Dean had been thinking about this moment for hours. His mind had wandered through dozens of scenarios about what they’d find on the other side of this door. Not once had it crossed his mind that when he entered this dungeon, he’d find Jack waiting for him.
“Ya hear that?” Dean whispered into Pam’s ear, “We both want you. You’re so good that we both want you.”
“Naw, man,” chuckled Benny, “I’m pretty sure there are clubs where people with whips meet people who like to be whipped. Seems a pretty safe bet that you’d find somethin’ like that in Chicago. Hell, there’s probably more than one or two in a city that size.”
They walk in silence for blocks, Jack trying to enjoy his time with her. He takes in the color of the trees that tower over them, paying special attention to the way sunlight filters through them, shafts of it flickering and dancing as the leafy branches sway. The golden beams seem attracted to Claire’s beautiful hair, bursting with warmth on contact and leaving behind a glow that seems to reach her skin. Her blue, crystalline eyes are contemplative as the two of them walk, and there’s a few times where he’d swear that she’s reaching for his hand, only to pull back at the last minute and mindlessly push her floppy sleeves up.
As expected, Dean’s schoolmates were thrilled for him. Everyone he passed was cheering for him. He received many “reach n slaps,” which were the universal sign of accomplishment - two merfolk reaching toward each other to slap the palms of their hands together as they swam past one another. But, despite his newfound fame, Dean’s eyes were searching the waters for one particular merman. Castiel.
“Singer’s Automotive,” he answered. “And a couple nights a week at a restaurant in town. Get to rotate in as bar tender once in awhile and the tips are awesome. And, well, yeah. I might’ve met someone too.”
With a view of Jimmy’s hairy, toned legs, Dean found his stomach growing warm and his lower body flexing as he watched his new lover’s toes curl. With one hand twisting into the sheet and the other clamped around the back of Jimmy’s neck, Dean arched his back and let his mouth go slack as his attention focused solely on his own pleasure for a moment as his partner let him thrust into his throat. Then, wanting to reciprocate, Dean doubled his efforts on the man’s rock-hard shaft. Moving his free hand to Jim’s ass, he clenched hard, gave a swat that echoed through the room, and then let his touch turn teasing as he slid fingers along the crack. He felt Jim’s full body shiver in response and zeroed in on the pucker, wiggling his fingers down in and pressing a fingertip to the tight folds of skin there.
Anyone who knew him would probably consider him a success story. Despite growing up the way he did, he’s still managed to make something of himself. These days, he’s a successful tattoo artist. And, his baby brother is a law student. Dean has his own apartment, a cherry ride, and a respectable bank account. Yeah, if anyone knew his story, they’d likely think of him as a survivor… someone who had overcome adversity to make something of himself. But really, it was hard to feel like a champ right now. Not while he’s standing half naked in public with his arms bound over his head and his body preparing for a gang-bang.
“Aw Sammy,” croaked Dean, pulling his brother into a one-armed hug and slapping his back fondly, “You wanna take me to the carnival?”
Gesturing to the little dot he was following on his phone, the one currently settled over nothing but blue water on the map, Benny replied, “Naw, brotha. I think we’re goin’ for a swim.”
“Mom,” rebuked Cas as he turned back to her, “you can’t keep baby-talking him. He’s not a Suckling anymore.”
But still, it’s hard to complain. He loves the feel of heavy breath panting at the back of his neck when he’s mounted and he lives to show off for his pack as they watch him be serviced. He eagerly explores new forms of sexual expression with Cas and constantly craves the wild carnality of their sex.
The two don’t need to hold hands or embrace for Jack to understand that there’s something intimate growing between them. The spark of it had likely been present when the girls first met and he'd failed to notice it. However, in a matter of days that spark has grown into a burning flame that can be seen from twenty paces. Eventually the growing fire will consume them in love and lust, keeping them focused on each other above anyone else and leaving him with no one.
“You don’t need an appointment for that,” she said. “Just stop at the desk where you check in and out. They can take you down anytime.”
Suddenly, anger overtook him. It was sweet relief. He’d choose anger over vulnerability any day of the week. Feeling himself harden, Dean held the man’s gaze as he growled out another truth. “I want you to get the fuck out and leave me alone, that’s what I want from you, agent.”
He didn’t actually lie, he just gave her the shortest answer and made sure there was a harsh edge to his words to avoid seeming vulnerable. Because he liked her, Dean tried to cover the coldness of his words by delivering them with his most charming smile. “Sweetheart,” he said, “are you tryin’ to tell me that my dad’s gonna come around one day? That at some point he’s gonna be cool with me blowin’ dudes? ‘Cause I gotta be honest Mildred, I don’t think you’re gonna live long enough to see that day.”
Castiel nodded dumbly, his lungs already full of smoke. If he hadn't known any better, he would have thought Dean almost sounded earnest—like he wanted him at the shop just to visit, rather than to update him on his progress. Whatever his motivations, Castiel didn’t need to be asked twice.
Dean felt breathless, and he wasn’t sure if it was from the thrill of being nearly manhandled by Castiel or because he was drowning once again, but he wasn’t sure it was a feeling he was prepared to give up yet. Castiel leaned in and pressed a kiss against his neck, and Dean tilted his head back and closed his eyes as his fingers curled around Castiel’s.
Castiel stared after him and didn’t say anything at all. He might have stepped in even if it hadn’t been Sam that had been being harassed, so he wasn’t sure he deserved thanks, but it was nice to hear. He didn’t know. The passenger door on the truck opened and slammed shut after Sam got in, and Castiel took a final drag from his cigarette before he put it out on the pavement next to his hip.
“That’s really rich, Castiel. Talking about what you owe me. Like you’ve been concerned about anything to do with me since you left. Don’t bother. I’m fine.”
Dean doesn’t have to wait too long. He comes out a little behind the others, the straps of his leotard pulled down, so that he’s bare to the waist. The sight makes Dean’s heart trip all over the inside of his rib cage, and he has to remind himself to breathe as he steps out of the shadows to make himself known.
“There’s no rush,” Castiel told him. He had finished putting the leftovers away and was leaned against the kitchen counter. “I’d rather you two stick around here than go back and end up worse off than before.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes, “We had a plan. I waited for you. Almost an entire week, I waited in the next town over. I called. And when I couldn’t wait any longer, I wrote to you. Tell me why.”
Hermes had laughed, a bright, tinny sound, like rain against a shield, and with a wave of his hand produced the gift of a new lyre and the suggestion that Castiel learn the boy’s language from someone else if he wanted to communicate with him so badly. “You’re clever enough for it, aren’t you?” he asked. “Use your gifts where you may.” Presently, Hermes explained, Castiel held favor among most of the gods, and so long as he didn’t disgrace himself, it should be easy enough to keep it. Then, as swiftly as he had come, he was gone.
Dean looked momentarily puzzled, and he clarified, “Of me. You said I’m not what you thought. So what did you think?”
“Well, I mean, it’s just that Sam’s not gonna be home for me to get dinner ready for, and I kind of owe you for helping him before… I’m almost finished up here, so I thought if you wanted to wait around, I could buy you a drink. Or… you don’t have to, I mean, I just thought I’d ask. I don’t go out much, so it’s probably not really a good idea anyway.”
By the time they made it to the bed, Dean was hardly thinking at all, and when Castiel pulled his own shirt over his head, he might as well have never had a single thought in his entire life.
Castiel didn’t miss the discomfort in Dean’s voice when he mentioned his father. Castiel remembered the way Dean had looked bruised and bloody in his own living room, and thought it was probably for the best that he wasn’t around.
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s middle and tucked his chin over his shoulder, “Anna isn’t my ex.”
“You cheated,” Castiel grumbled. And he had, Dean had gotten him to agree to that deal under duress. He’d had his hand down Castiel’s pants at the time.
He set his portfolio aside, and once again took in the space, how utterly neat it was despite the fact that it could have been an easily justifiable mess. Which was the argument Castiel generally used when Anna complained that it was time for him to clean his apartment. He took time to examine the tool cart, where he caught sight of a filthy, but obviously embroidered kerchief sticking out of one of the drawers.
“Uhm, well, I’m in school. Pre-Law. I’m going to a local school right now, but I’m transferring to Stanford in the fall. I’m really excited. Their legal program is top-notch, and if I play my cards right, I could end up interning with some pretty impressive firms. Going there could really help me jumpstart my career.”
He finished smoking, picked up the paper, decided he wasn’t quite ready to wade through classifieds, and instead went to take a shower.
“In a minute,” Castiel told him. “I’m scared too. I’m afraid you’ll wake up one morning and realize that you made a mistake with me. It’s what I’ve always been afraid of with you. When you told me that you loved me that last night we had together, even though… even though we had danced around it for so long, I was so scared, because it was fast and I knew that you meant it. And I knew that I felt the same, but I was such a mess back then, I didn’t have any skills, and there was the Garrison, and I knew you deserved more.”
"I don't want to stop," Dean said fiercely. "Just- just give me...I want this. You. Please." Dean's tears fell, and Castiel kissed them away.
Sam laughed and nudged him with his elbow once he had recovered, “It’s not my fault if you’ve been drawing the repairs out so we could hang out with Cas more often.”
Castiel went to get cleaned up and dressed, and made sure he grabbed the candy from the nightstand to keep in his pocket. Dean’s ass for his cigarettes. He drove a hard bargain, but sometimes you just had to suck it up and fight the good fight.
He could swing by the shop every other day. He could be like the friends his grandmother had entertained when he had been a boy, and drop-in “just to chat.” He could get to know Sam, who seemed pretty interesting, even without the added perk of being a direct source on his brother. He could do his damnedest to get Dean to notice him the way he noticed Dean. Even if it didn’t lead to anything, or he ended up not liking him, maybe they could be friendly. Maybe he could make him part of the Garrison. The guys would like that. Someone who knew about cars could probably get them better deals on parts or might at least know who they could go to for this or that. Maybe all of that would put an end to the wanting. All of the daydreams where he had Dean’s hands everywhere, and there were freckles everywhere, and hardly any space between them. He’d shatter his own fantasy by getting close to it. Maybe that could work.
The performance site was oddly bright, apparently illuminated by an assortment of lamps and torches. People were moving all over the place, in seemingly senseless directions—like so many black ants, scurrying about in ways Dean had no knowledge of—but right before his eyes, poles were being erected and seating constructed. It was a marvelous sight to behold.
There was an awkward silence that passed between them, and Dean had no idea how to make it so that he could excuse himself without looking rude, or what to say that would break the tension between them, so he just bit his tongue and hoped Castiel would beat him to it. He didn’t want to ask any more questions because he didn’t think he wanted the answers to them.
Eventually, Castiel had littered Dean’s neck and chest with lovebites, and it grew difficult to ignore, not only their mutual hard-ons, but Dean’s soft whimpers and moans. He wanted him so desperately that it hurt. He drew back to look up at Dean, and he already looked nearly wrecked. His face was flushed, his hair stood at odd angles, where Castiel had his fingers in it before, and his lips were parted so that Castiel felt himself throb at the memory of having had them around his length only a short time earlier.
Castiel blew out a cloud of smoke and continued to watch Dean from where he was. There was a grass lot and a narrow street between them at the moment, but Castiel had gotten good at picking out important details from a distance. It looked like Dean was changing out some sort of part. He had worked there, in his father’s garage, for as long as Castiel could remember- at least as long as he had been running around with “The Garrison,” the name Anna and Castiel had come up with for their gang when they had still been kids and their fathers had been off to war. Now, it was emblazoned in gold lettering across the backs of their jackets, and any guy or girl who was accepted into their circle ended up with one.
Five minutes later, he was sitting against the wall, ice across his knuckles, new cigarette between his lips. “I know.” His jaw was throbbing, and he didn’t feel much like talking, but he sort of liked Sam, so he didn’t want to chase him off just yet. Besides, he wasn’t entirely sure the two jerks that had cornered him weren’t still hanging around somewhere, so he wasn’t comfortable sending him on his way anyway. “What’d those guys want with you,” he shifted the ice from the back of his hand to his jaw and turned his head away from Sam to blow smoke.
Sam turned to face the lot too, and hesitated for a moment before carefully putting it to his lips and taking a drag. He looked sort of awkward, but for a second, Castiel thought maybe he had managed to do it successfully on his first attempt. Of course, that was right when he started to cough and sputter, and he held the cigarette out for Castiel to take as he tried to recover himself. Castiel took it and placed back between his own lips before he patted Sam's back firmly a couple of times in an attempt to keep him from coughing up a lung.
Dean was staring at him like he had never seen him before, and when he reached out to put his hands on his knees, Castiel couldn’t help but flinch.
Dean knows the score, knows how these things work, knows that Castiel will go when the circus goes, and he’ll probably never see him again. But he doesn’t stop himself. He feels good for a change, feels like he could forget the way his body aches more than it should after a long day of work, or that his stomach is never full, and that most of the world is miserable. He’ll take his hope where he can get it, and right now, Castiel’s mouth on his, the way he leans back and opens his robe just for him, feels like hope distilled, and maybe, if he drinks enough of it, it’ll tide him through the worst of his bad days for a while.
Coffee uncrossed his arms and turned his body more fully in Castiel’s direction, his lips pursed, “Doesn’t sound so bad. I can think of worse ways to be welcomed into adulthood than a fancy party with free food and alcohol.”
“Happy Birthday,” Dean said, a small smile on his lips. “It’s- like I said, it isn’t finished. We’ve still got some work to do on it before it’s road-ready, and we gotta do some body work, but it’s not bad, right? I figured you could paint a new pair of wings on it if you wanted. And it’s bigger than your old one, so, you know, more room for two or whatever.” Dean blushed faintly. “Believe it or not, the reason Jack doesn’t know a thing about cars is ‘cause the kid’s a bike wiz. Worked on the stunt bikes when he lived in Hollywood and helped me get this one for a pretty good price.”
“Wait, wait,” Dean said, laughing as he grabbed his arm. “C’mon. I’m just teasing.” He leaned in and tweaked Castiel’s nose playfully, “You know, like The Flamingos song, ‘I only have eyes for you,’” he crooned the lyric into Castiel’s ear, probably as close as he dared getting to a kiss while they were standing in the middle of the shop. He straightened up, “Now, let’s go, I want to show you something. Close your eyes.”
“All right.” Castiel took a drink of his coffee, fully aware that if Dean asked, there wouldn’t be much to tell. He had never been in any kind of relationship, and any romantic encounters he’d had with other people had been exceedingly brief. “He wasn’t Castor, was he? Or Casper, maybe? ”
Also, quick note: the chapters have titles now! I'm not good at this, but since the fic title is a Sinatra song, I figured I'd follow suit with the the chapter titles. I tried to make the songs semi-relevant and period appropriate. So, here they are so far:
Castiel could have lost his mind. He grabbed Dean roughly by the arm, for once unconcerned with the intimacy of contact between them.
“Dad, there are leftovers in the refrigerator,” Dean said, already headed for the door. He was halfway there before Castiel ever moved.
Castiel was looking at Dean though. There were things, almost always, that Dean didn’t let himself say, and Castiel couldn’t keep himself from searching Dean for whatever it was he felt like he needed to keep bottled up at times like this. Asking to kiss him was probably the closest Dean had ever come to saying what was on his mind, and even then Castiel was fairly certain that the kiss hadn’t been what he really meant to ask for. Maybe it was just the closest thing he had been able to come up with at the time.
“I’m sick of Lucky and his boys thinking that they’ve got a leg up on us because there’s so many of them. He doesn’t care who he recruits so long as they’re willing to do what he says and don’t mind playing dirty. We need to move hard and fast against them, and all the rest will fall into line. If we need to, we can get few more recruits we can trust, but there’s nothing stopping us from making a definite move to cement our status,” Josiah was usually hot-headed, and was almost always willing to fight before he was willing to use his words. Castiel had a soft spot for him only because Josiah seemed to idolize him somewhat, and rather than the disappointed big-brother look he had gotten from Gabriel when he had come in with his split lip and bruised jaw, Josiah had looked almost awe-struck.
“Yeah,” he said as he looked across the room at him. It was the first really good look he had taken of him since he’d realized who he was. It was easy to mark the similarities between the Castiel he had known as a teenager and the one that stood before him now. His hair that still seemed to stand out in every direction, those soul-piercing blue eyes, and the cross that hung around his neck, were all exactly the same as Dean remembered. But he was different too, in ways that made Dean’s mouth go dry with desire. He’d been a little awkward when they had been in high school, kind of skinny and without any real sense of fashion—Dean had found it cute back then, had liked the way he almost seemed to swim in the clothes he wore. He had clearly put on some muscle since then, broadened in a way that made Dean wonder how it would feel to be held down or pinned against a wall by him, and now sported an unnecessarily attractive amount of scruff. He’d always looked a little worn out, and that hadn’t changed, but in loose sweats a t-shirt, the effect was enhanced, and he looked more like a guy that had been made to look tired for a movie than one that actually was. He was gorgeous, and all Dean knew was that he had absolutely no business thinking those thoughts about a guy he hadn’t seen in over a decade, and would have liked to avoid entirely.
Dean cleared his throat, “Don’t be such a stick in the mud, Sammy. We’re all adults here.” He smoothed his hand over the sheets in an obvious attempt to save face, though Castiel was certain that his mind wasn’t anywhere near pancakes anymore.
“I’m not a soldier,” Castiel said. “I’m a photographer. I’ll be quieter.” He didn’t bother to wait for a response and instead shut the door, and pressed his back against it. Eventually, he slid to the floor, where he tried and failed to get the awful images of Sam and Dean’s bloodied and dying faces out of his head until, eventually, he fell into an uneasy doze.
Dean looked into his eyes again, and all he could see in them was his own pain, years of it, reflected back. How did it feel to drown in your own pain? Pain that you had created? Dean thought maybe it felt like heartbreak.
“Swing back by in a couple of days, will you?” Dean was asking him this as he unlocked the garage, and Castiel was painfully reminded of Dean asking why he hadn’t come by the week before.
By the time everyone had gone, and Sam and Dean had more or less cleaned up the apartment, Castiel was just drunk enough to fall directly asleep once Dean had helped him clean up and tucked him in. He rarely drank, had never much cared for it, but he’d wanted to enjoy himself, and he liked the look on Dean’s face when he’d stolen a swig of his beer without asking. “Was a very happy birthday,” he’d muttered as he drifted off, the feel of Dean’s lips still warm on his forehead.
He was out of the car before it had finished moving, and was halfway to Alistair and his goons before Gabe caught him around the waist to hold him back. Al had also jumped out of his car and was ready for a fight, his look one of smug victory, despite the fact that they had lost the race and, as a result, their car.
Castiel could barely hear him let alone answer because there was Dean, possibly looking as shocked and terrified as he currently felt. Sam stood close behind him so that he was practically boxed in between the doorframe and his body, and Castiel was certain that if that hadn’t been the case one of them—either Dean or himself—would have bolted.
Castiel ran his hands along his thighs uncomfortably and averted his gaze from Sam’s face. He’d hoped they could avoid the topic of his departure and Dean for a majority of the night. He didn’t really want to talk about either of those things.
Sam put his hands up defensively, “Don’t blow up, Dean. I just wanted you two to talk. He and I had dinner last night, and I realized that probably wouldn’t happen unless I forced you two to see each other. I thought you’d be happy to see him, but he looked like he’d seen a ghost when I mentioned you lived nearby, so I figured it was possible you’d have a similar reaction. Two stubborn, emotionally-constipated peas in a pod.”
Castiel climbed back through the window, and then turned to grab the laundry basket. He ignored Dean’s use of his favorite phrase, because he’d get himself in trouble if he let himself think about it too long.
Because he was friendly. It had been one of his selling points when he was trying to get himself hired. And on the rare occasion he was asked to man the store when Claire or Jody were sick, he could sell something to almost anyone who walked through the door.
“Did you need something?” Castiel blew smoke out of the window. He knew he was probably walking a thin line with her, but they hadn’t spoken in almost two weeks, and he was a little irritated that she had shown up on the last night Dean and Sam were planning to be in his apartment. Her timing was awful, and though he was used to dealing with her fits when she was in them, he wasn’t really in the mood for it right then.
By the time he reached the shop, the sun was at its peak, and Castiel had mostly sweated through his shirt, which was a light blue button down with cap sleeves he wore open at the collar. The curl that rested in the middle of his forehead was a little limper than it had been when he had started out that morning, but unlike a lot of the guys, he didn’t wear a D.A. or a pompadour, and instead preferred a messier, comb-over that worked without him having to maintain it too much throughout the course of the day. He still kept a comb in his back pocket, just in case, but on the whole, he never used it and he liked that he never had to do much to keep up with it after he did it in the morning. The garage bay was open and Castiel could see Dean’s legs sticking out from under the old Ford he had in there, his Levi’s just as snug over his thighs as Castiel remembered.
Most of the guys respected him as much as they did her, but it wasn’t often that he put the power to any real use. It was nice if you needed a few guys to back you up in a scuffle, and Castiel was hardly ever on his own. It wasn’t like anyone was willing to mess with you if you were wearing a jacket and were also backed up by five other guys with the same jacket, so he supposed it kept him out of trouble for the most part. At least as ‘out of trouble’ as you could be when you ran around getting into fights and racing illegally. Mostly, he hung around with them because he had been friends with Anna for as long as they could remember, and because it gave him a place to belong. When his father had failed to return home after the fighting was done, he hadn’t known what he was going to do with his life. The Garrison gave him a purpose, and he was grateful enough for that.
“In the kitchen… was it true? About your friends wanting you to bring me around? Or were you just saying that to keep dad from getting angry about dinner?”
A shudder ran through Dean, and Castiel squeezed him briefly to let him know he wasn't going to have to face this sort of thing alone if he didn't want to. Maybe Dean had started as his mechanic, but the more time he spent with the Winchesters, the more he found himself wanting to maintain their relationship, even once Dean was done with his bike.
Castiel didn’t move, and even though Dean’s face was still bruised and a little scraped, he couldn’t help thinking he was still the best looking thing for miles. They really hadn’t been alone since he had let Dean kiss him three mornings ago, and there was a slight awkwardness between them now as they looked at each other from across the fire escape.
For reasons Dean still had yet to discern, after their dad died, Sam had decided he wanted to take over the motel he’d owned, and because Dean could never say no to him, he had agreed to help. It wasn’t like he’d been doing a lot at the time anyway. Odd jobs by daylight, playing dive bars and seedy clubs by moonlight. It made him feel like a fraudy shell of an adult not to have any actual stable source of income, so it made sense to sign on for something that seemed a little more long-term. It also seemed less pathetic to stumble into a motel room, half-drunk, at 2 am, at almost 30 years old, if he lived there anyway.
Dean glanced over his shoulder at their waiting opponents, both getting ready for what was about to be the easiest 100 bucks of their lives.
Castiel finished cleaning the scrapes along Dean’s cheek, and smoothed a bandage over the cut on his brow. Dean wasn’t exactly being transparent, but he had a pretty good idea about what had gone on before they had turned up at his apartment. He was nearly in tears, and it was evident to Castiel that physical pain wasn’t the cause.
Castiel had already determined that Sam was touchy about their dad for whatever reason, and it seemed that Dean was too, so he didn’t push the subject any further, and instead directed Dean to his apartment.
Castiel reached up and kissed him, his hands on either side of Dean’s face. Dean shifted, and before he knew what had hit him, Castiel felt Dean begin to lower himself over him, a steadying arm still wrapped around his neck while the other guided Castiel into him.
“We could stop at that place we went to last time we visited,” Sam had closed his book and put it in his lap in order to focus his attention on the task at hand. “It’s not far from here, right? C’mon, Dean, it’s already so hot today, it’ll be fun.”
Castiel scowled, “Don’t be ridiculous. He looks like he’s half my age. I’m just making an observation”
“‘Atta boy,” Dean leaned up enough to give him a brief kiss, which, of course, was enough to melt away any irritation he might have felt. When Dean pulled away, he settled back against Castiel’s chest, and looked up at the sky again.
“You're stronger than you look,” Dean pointed out as he swam toward them. “Faster than I expected too.”
“I have a life outside of The Garrison.” It wasn’t the right thing to say, certainly not the most diplomatic, but he wanted it to be true. He wanted to leave town one day. He wanted to find whatever it was in life that was supposed to make him feel like he knew what he was meant to be doing. He wanted Dean Winchester. And even if he never got any of that, if he was stuck in his apartment until the factory killed him, and all he ever got from Dean was a friendly touch and smile, he still wanted there to be something for him outside of the Garrison. Even if it was just a cat or a place he could go where none of them would follow him. Until now, his bike had been a solace in that way. And in the absence of that, he had gained a tenuous relationship with the Winchester brothers. He’d take it for what it was worth right now.
“It smells good,” he admitted as he picked up his fork. It looked good too. The crust was golden brown and flaky. And it was stuffed to the brim with beef and vegetables. It was like an entire meal condensed into one convenient slice. They had left the windows open, because it was just too hot in the apartment otherwise, particularly while Dean had had the kitchen in full use, and Castiel was certain that anyone else who also had their windows open would be jealous just from the smell.
Sam’s brows lifted, “Ah, Dean sold it. Not too long after you left, actually, he moved the two of us into your old apartment. I guess he wanted to get away from dad, but he told me it was because it was closer to the shop and school. You know how he is,” Sam rolled his eyes. “Anyway, about a year, year and a half after that, dad got into an accident. He’d been drinking, and I guess he must’ve lost control or something. I don’t know. But eventually, Dean packed everything up and then sold the place.”
Castiel's hands had stilled on the equipment he'd been cleaning, and it took him a moment longer than it should have to answer him.
In the time since they had been apart, Dean had picked up a few tricks, rarely having been too shy to try something new with the people he slept with, but it seemed that Castiel hadn’t exactly been idle either. He was sure in his movements now, and he didn’t hesitate to put his hands and mouth in places that had once made both of them blush. It felt good to be pressed against him, to run his hands along every inch of him, and to moan or laugh or gasp when he did something unexpected. It felt good to want it, to want him.
“Swimming then. You can manage it if we plan for trunks? And if I promise to make it all up to you when we’re alone again?”
Castiel didn't think this was a prudent time to point out that Dean probably never would have known if anything had happened to him. He just never would have heard from him again. It wouldn’t have been much different than it had been before Sam brought him to his room. If anything had happened to him, the only people who might have been contacted were the women at the magazine, and he wouldn’t have bet on that. It was supposed to have been that way anyway. That he and Dean were together now seemed almost surreal. "I didn't go there to fight," he said. He sat next to him. "I wasn't enlisted."
“Castiel. You don’t look too much alike to be brothers.” He took his lighter out of his pocket and flipped the lid on it, open and shut, just to give his hands something to do. The small space was starting to get to him, but he didn’t really know how to leave without being totally rude, and it wasn’t something he was willing to risk when Dean held the fate of his bike in his palms.
Castiel stepped out of his boots, and tossed his jacket over the arm of the sofa before he emptied his pockets and headed for his room. He would sleep the rest of the day away, and maybe when he got up, the whole thing would feel like more of a slightly unsettling dream than a severe mistake he had made. Maybe he’d go to the garage when he got up and check that Sam and Dean were all right.
His mother pulled her fingers through his hair, and nodded carefully as he spoke to her and listed the practical reasons he should have Dean as a companion, rather than ones based on any feelings that might have been stirred in him by Dean’s tears or quiet gaze. It was the extent of her affection for him, for they seldom embraced or kissed one another. He eventually reasoned that it was as much to protect him as it was to protect herself from her husband’s wrath. He simply detested Castiel’s existence, which meant that he would feel the same about anyone who extended him more than standard courtesy.
“Dean!” Sam sounded completely scandalized, and looked equally as horrified when Dean finally bothered to pull away.
“That should be fine,” Castiel said finally. “Is… are you liking things here? I realize the barn isn’t… ideal.”
Castiel regarded the pair coolly, his cigarette held loosely between his lips, “Two on one’s not really fair, though, is it? I mean, he’s tall, but you two goons have twenty pounds each on him. What’s he done anyhow?”
“I insist,” he said. “It’s rare, we’re staying for the week. Plenty of opportunity. Come if you have the time.” He smiled faintly. “I think you won’t regret it.”
And he wanted to smoke now, just like he had then, but he reminded himself that Dean was the reason he’d quit in the first place. He’d have one once Dean was gone again, and there was nothing left to prop him up. “I shouldn’t have sent those,” Castiel told him. “I was sorry I’d done it as soon as I flew out. I know it wasn’t fair of me.”
“I’m always scared,” Castiel told him, honestly.  “Dean, I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified of you since the day I set eyes on you. You know that. Because you just… You can look at me, and I want to move mountains for you.”
They had spoken at the same time, and both stopped when they realized they had. It was an old habit of theirs. Neither of them ever knew what to say until they did.
Dean is at a loss, and he sits on the pallet, and tries not to feel too terribly awkward about the fact that Castiel is watching him through the mirror.
Anna hardened—he could see the rigidity work its way up her spine, like she might fight him right there in his living room—and he knew he had definitely said the wrong thing.
“You know what. That. With Sam. Just now. You didn’t seem-” he had to bite his lip to keep from moaning when Dean licked that sensitive space below his ear, “-concerned,” he continued through clenched teeth, “about what he would think.”
“What is it?” Castiel didn’t know what made him ask. He didn’t say much, and seldom asked questions about anyone else’s state of mind because he didn’t like to be asked about his own. It was just that with Dean, he couldn’t really help wanting to know what sorts of things went through his head. He didn’t talk as much as Sam, and Castiel had rarely seen him exchange more than pleasantries with anyone else, so he found himself curious.
“Cas.” Dean finally spoke, and it sounded like he was coming out of some kind of hundred-year trance.
Castiel lifted a brow, more at the idea that he would take advantage of Dean than the command Dean had just given him. He imagined Dean was probably used to saying the same thing to Sam whenever they ate, so he simply did it rather than say anything. When he finished, he poured himself another cup of coffee, and Dean whisked both of their plates away.
Dean’s been wearing his ring around his neck. Cas wanted them to both wear rings, and while Dean would like nothing more than to show off the fact that he’s completely and utterly taken by one of the best people he’s ever met in his life, he’s determined to be patient. He can wait. Cas is convinced his career can handle it, that his fans are more loyal than to overthrow him because of the person he’s chosen to spend his life with, and Dean wants to believe that. He’s just been in the business long enough to know that things don’t always work out that way.
Castiel glanced back over his shoulder at the screen door before directing his attention back at the lot, “Somehow, I don’t think Dean would approve.”
He’d known right then, as soon as he’d heard his voice, that he was screwed. There was part of him that nearly went anyway. The part of him that had never really formed into a spine nearly had him climb out that window like he hadn’t heard a single thing the kid had said. A boy and his future were waiting for him, and all he had to do was go.
The man, who looked even squarer than Dean, was thin and bespectacled. He stuck his hands in his pockets as he stood up, and rocked awkwardly on the balls of his feet, like he wasn’t certain if he should go to meet Dean or stay where he was.  Although his glasses were more Buddy Holly than James Dean, the fact that he wore them reminded Castiel how good Dean had looked in his just days before.
The pair, now more irritated with him than they were interested in whatever they had been going to do with Sam, turned on him in near unison. Castiel took a slow drag of his cigarette, and fixed them with a look that dared them to make one wrong move.
Castiel did not let go of him, and instead brushed Dean’s tears away with his thumbs, “Can I kiss you, then?” Castiel’s face was very near to his, and he hadn’t taken his eyes off of him even for a second. “For old time’s sake. If you’d have shown that night, I’d have kissed you. Even if only to say goodbye.” His touch softened, and he let his hands drift to Dean’s neck, an out if Dean wanted to take it.
Sam looked a little surprised, and then chuckled, “I’m on summer break. Just visiting. Well, sort of. Hey,” he ran a hand through his hair, “I’m gonna be in town for a while. I’d love to catch up- hear about what you’ve been up to. I’ll buy you a coffee or something.”
“You’re determined to blow us all up, aren’t you,” Dean teased as he came around the truck and stopped with the passenger seat headlight between them.
A fortnight went by before Castiel found the time or, perhaps, the courage to speak to the boy. At eight, he had not yet grown bold enough to defy his reserved nature, and he wasn’t certain that the boy wouldn’t strike him if he chose the wrong time to approach. He’d watched him when he could, and spent his afternoons planning ways in which he might approach him casually and make a friend of him. As of yet, it seemed he had rebuffed any person who was not among those he’d come with, and while Castiel felt it would have been warranted, he hadn’t seen him cry either. Castiel didn’t want to be rejected, but he didn’t feel that not approaching him was of any benefit now. The longer he waited, the greater the chance that the boy’s defenses would lower, and one of his siblings would swoop in and extinguish any hope he might have at starting a friendship with him. He didn’t want to take that chance, and he formulated a plan for himself.
Sam managed to look a little embarrassed, but never got around to telling him what exactly it was that had set the guys off- if it had been anything at all- because an old pickup skidded to a stop in front of them. It took them both several moments to realize that the person who had jumped out of the cab and was shouting Sam’s name was none other than Dean Winchester.
Castiel wasn’t a generally nosy person, but he knew precious little about Dean Winchester, and he couldn’t help his curiosity. He checked that Dean was still on the phone, and seeing that he hadn’t come back out of the office, carefully tugged the little drawer open.
“Make it quick. I’m not in the mood to fight him off.” He ran a hand through one side of his hair, and then patted it back into place as Sam, who had looked momentarily stunned, took it from him.
There was the possibility that Dean was backed up with other jobs, more oil changes or tire rotations, whatever it was that mechanics did, and hadn’t gotten to his bike at all. Despite the fact that he felt a little bad he hadn’t shown up after a few days to check-in, particularly when he remembered the earnest way Dean had asked him about it, he eased his guilt by telling himself that if ever Anna finally forgave him for whatever it was she was specifically angry about, everything would be fine. Dean would probably forget he existed once his bike was finished and Castiel paid him, whereas Anna would still (probably) be his oldest friend.
Anna shifted gears and pressed the pedal into the floorboard. Castiel resisted the urge to light up as they nosed ahead of The Devils. Anna had a very strict no smoking policy when it came to races. Said she didn’t need ash flying in her face if she was supposed to be driving. None of the other gangs even had girls around except to look pretty- like Gabe’s blonde-but Anna had started their gang when they had still been fifteen, and Castiel, like always, had come along for the ride. She was a good leader, fierce, but with an edge of compassion where it was needed, and while it had initially been a little difficult to get guys to join up with a gang run by a girl, once they had, she inspired loyalty in them.
