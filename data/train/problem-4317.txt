Cas gives him a weary look, but scoots closer once Facetime is turned on. Sam and Eileen’s happy faces light up the screen, and Dean turns the brightness down as he squints at the screen. Sam signs something to Eileen, and she signs back before they both turn back to the camera. Dean doesn’t have the time or energy to interrupt what they just communicated-- especially from the odd angle-- but then it dawns on him. “You guys are having a kid?!” He exclaims, and the tired heaviness weighing in his bones is somehow lifted away with the joy from the news.
is a great memory to replace the bad.
He shook his head at the absurdness of his encounter, going back to the phone booth and slotting one of the coins into the machine. He gave the dial a turn nine times, putting in Dean’s number. The phone rang for what seemed like ages before the man finally picked up. “Sammy?” A slurred voice said.
Instead of answering Dean closes the gap between them and does the only reasonable thing. He kisses Cas, and it’s like something out of a dream, but better. He feels like all the puzzle pieces of his life are slotting together, filling the empty spaces. He feels like he’s on fire, everywhere that Cas is touching him. There are two arms wrapped around him, fingers splayed at the small of his back. He kind of loses himself in the heady happiness of the moment.
He slides his thumb over the black letters, thinking about the way his name sounded in Castiel’s rich, gravelly voice.
Dean’s heart sinks. That’s not Bobby Singer.
Castiel hesitates. He considers explaining himself. Maybe apologizing. Dean’s fists are clenched in the sheets. He’s radiating anger and stress. It layers over the scent of his arousal. No, Castiel decides. He’s not going to explain himself when it’s clear Dean's not in the mood to listen. He’s certainly not going to apologize either. That leaves him with one option. Really, the only option. So he leaves.
“Oh god.” Jane looks appalled. “Dean’s drugged an angel.”
Maybe Castiel pulls over in the service lane at the border of Kansas and cries. He can’t remember if he sobbed or simply held himself because it was late afternoon and all around the fields shimmered green. How was the world still so beautiful? How did it still turn? What does it matter? Why is Castiel here? Dean isn’t in Kansas anymore.
“I just wanted to thank you for that,” Castiel explains, speaking hastily. He looks just as embarrassed as Dean feels.
Dean drains the last of his beer. “Sure.”
Castiel is seized with the urge to touch Dean. To offer comfort. Surely touching the lines on his face, the deep creases, the gouges dug by pain– surely touching them could help. He lifts his hand and Dean catches it, fingers folding over Castiel’s wrist. Dean frowns at him, equal parts sadness and anger. All feeling is pain. All degrees of pain. All good, all bad. All too much.
Castiel remembers to fish out the badge and flash it. Dean’s shoulders relax a little.
, bellies stuffed and relaxing.
Softly, the quietude of his voice tender and intimate as a caress, Cas says, “Happy birthday.”
That voice– Castiel’s head whips up just in time to see– Dean. He chokes on a sharp inhale and doubles over, wheezing.
Avocado salad. There's some chicken in there, but the bright, buttery lime green splatter dominates the plastic bowl in front of him. It makes Dean think of life in Palo Alto through Sam's eyes. Some hippy hybrid yoga, followed by a kale smoothie, followed by this bullshit washed down with a coconut milk latte. Probably. Dean's not sure, so he assumes.
“It doesn’t matter,” Castiel says, spearing the salad bowl with a decisive stab. “We’re not together anymore. We were never in love. I was with her because it was the easy thing to do and now–”
Dean waits for him to log off, but then he reaches out and tugs Castiel by his tie. It catches Castiel by surprise, but he goes along so he doesn’t choke. When Dean kisses him, Castiel melts into it.
Risa’s bruise is purple and swollen but she looks well-rested. Dean’s cuts are bandaged but he has shadows beneath his eyes.
There was also the fact that Castiel had never done this before. He knew he was going to be terrible about it. Dean had explained it to him, but it hadn’t been very helpful.
And he’s happy to support Sam. Play a starring role in the show while his brother goes off to save the world or whatever.
This is what he’d been afraid of. “That’s not necessary. I don’t really–”
It’s Dean.
Dean chuckles at the sarcasm in her tone and shrugs. “I got bills to pay.”
And while Castiel ponders the object of his interest, the cause of his fall, the man himself is long gone.
They’re at the door to the lobby, and Dean leans back against the wall beside it. He’s wondering if he should lean in and try for a kiss when Castiel lets go of his hand and takes a step back.
Cas’ smile grows. “So, should we start asking the questions? Do you want me to go first?”
“Yes, and this isn’t the first time.” A notable example was when he pulled Dean out of Hell. “I’m usually able to heal myself.”
“Fine,” he huffs. “Whatever. You’re hired, son. You start Monday.” He glares at Sheriff Mills. “You come in here just to bust my balls or you actually got any business?”
“Yes what?”
Dean wakes up with a groan. His head throbs in protest.
There is a man beneath the skin of the monster. Though he lurks beneath the thick, calloused scales, a mere shadow, he exists. Terrifyingly fragile and human.
Castiel spares the body a glance before he scours the horizon again. The smell of blood is in the air. Dean called the police, but no one’s here. It’s been five minutes. No sirens, no flashing lights. “Dean, something’s–”
Dean savors the moment. He memorized the dark shadows of Castiel’s eyelashes, the glisten of his lips still wet from a sip of beer, the color in his cheeks, the nervous bob of his adam’s apple… the way he breathes in when Dean leans closer and kisses him.
“You still feel guilty about the whole thing,” Dean says. It’s not a question. His smile turns wry and knowing.
Castiel considers his powerlessness. He stares at his open hands in his lap, the lines of fate running across his palms and contemplates how he can’t help Dean. He can’t do anything for Dean. He can’t do anything but follow Dean. Twilight spreads across the horizon in a splash of colors– deep blue, orange, purple, shocking pink. The world is simultaneously beautiful and bleak.
“That’s the first card I picked up. I made up a different question. Read it.”
“Remind me to kill Charlie for picking this restaurant,” Dean jokes when they’re left alone.
“Don’t worry about it,” Sam says, instantly going from pissed, whiny younger brother to gentle giant.
“Cas! Cas!” Dean’s voice cracked. He kept repeating, shaking gently but there’s no response.
“Dismiss!”
“Cas?” he realizes “Cas!” Dean runs fast his way to where they stand, trying desperately to reach him.
She approached closer to Dean’s side.
“He seems happy.”
As he gets to Sam, a bittersweet look from each-other takes place. They stare for a few seconds, unsure on what to say.
. With a last glance, he says goodbye to his brother.
“What’s...” Castiel breath out heavily. “Jack?” He continued confused.
“No freaking idea man” he turns back to Sam “we’ll make it up as we go. All I know is that it’ll be
“Are you okay?” the concern in Castiel made Jack turns to his father and his smiles fades as he goes.
“What? Do I need a reason to see my boys?” Rowena mocks.
Sam gave her another drink, she thanks, winking at him again.
Dean nods, standing proudly.
Sam hugs his brother, holding tight. Dean’s hugs back, feeling lighter. For the past years, the need for being together causes an unimaginable consequence, paid in blood of their own and others, but now it's time to try things different, to be themself, whatever that means, whoever they were.
Cas, nods. He feels safe now.
Eileen gets it, she smiles as an answer only to hold him once again.
“I’m more than the Darkness, more than a Nephilim, Im also holds the power of God, which means I’m the most powerful being ever existed”
“I’m here for Castiel.”
After a short while, a blast of light surrounds them, Sam holds Eileen tighter, protecting her.
“Cas mark?” Dean whispered. “but it banished long ago”
“Listen, first I need to tell you something.”
“Easy kid, don’t rush it, let’s just...” Dean used his hands to calm Jack. “...enjoy the ride.”
Dean nods as Cas stands from the bed. Dean changes to the chair next to the desk, wandering the room looking for nothing in particular till he fixes his eyes on Castiel.
“I heard you Dean, we heard you, we heard your prayer” her voice went soft at those final words.
Dean looked down; he’s been praying to him on daily basis. He knew Jack wanted to be hands off but letting Castiel behind, didn’t feel right to him.
Eileen made it through behind Sam, looking strange.
Eileen is moving slowly.
“Sleep, be quiet!” The figure, looking as Dean, squeezed its hand, making the other man in front of it scream out of pain.
“Oh no, that was you” Jack answered straight to Dean.
“You what?” Sam asked, visibly surprised, arching his head a little.
He knew this feeling. For the past years, nightmares were a constant in his life, ever since he was pulled out of hell by Castiel and maybe even before the memories of his time there, came back to him as dreams, still haunting him.
As soon as he speaks, his eyes glows
Everyone cheered him up.
“What’s up with all that” he points to the jars.
In the bathtub, next to them, Eileen was laid down unconscious, water covering her body.
“It’s not fair that we get to move on, and he didn’t...he deserved better. It’s not fair” His voice gone weaker.
“Angels were created by my brother to worship him. They were never made to love humanity” Amara pointed. “they were only meant to be soldiers he could play with, to be obedient. But no Castiel”.
You better not be giving my room.” He sneakily sniffs.
“It will, ready?” The voice of Amara answered him.
“But then what...” he realizes and then smiled awkwardly.
Sam awkwardly laughed, as a reflex he pushed his brother’s hand off his shoulder.
He was afraid something else happened to her, so he started looking for Rowena for some answers. Down the spells and stuff, she left him, he found out some side effects of it. After coming back once, you couldn’t make it back again, no matter how it happened, the soul gets damage.
Intrigued Jack agrees with her.
“Dean?” Sam asked scared.
“Grip tight!” Dean screamed through the portal.
Sam spots the source of attention of his brother, getting what this was about. “I miss him too...”
Dean, even more confused, turns to see Amara but not leaving Cas’s side.
“The bar’s doing great!” Its Dean’s turn to speak proudly.
Dean shook his head in disbelief, almost like he’s been teased. Sam notices.
“We can actually teach every hunter there is, we can share centuries of knowledge” Sam now’s looking excited.
Every word, every emotion came from the deepest part of Dean.
Dean reacted alarmed at Sam’s question, looking concern.
“I felt that”
This day has been a roller-coaster of emotions.
“What the hell?”
Next to Dean, Cas is fighting Miracle as usual for the spot next to him. In the back seat, Sam, Eileen and Jack hold the excitement for the adventure.
Sam frowned, caught guard down.
Castiel’s smiling weakly, he’s feeling tired but still, he tries to sit straight on the bed.
He obeys.
Sam didn’t flick at the mention, he only holds him tighter, taking Dean’s head closer into his chest. He can feel his brother’s tears.
“You’re just in time for the cake.” Sam walks back to the table with Dean alongside him.
“No Sam” Dean said sharply.
Dean reacts to the movement and wakes up frightened as a reflex. Then he sees Cas, smiling warmly.
Over the past years, Castiel became more than a warrior to fight with the impossible battles they fought together, more than a friend, he was family and Sam knew that.
Jack doesn’t get it but goes along. “Just tell me where and I’ll take us there.”
But it’s time, and they let go the embrace.
Castiel, still clueless, looks at Dean and he looks back, pointing to the very noticeable engagement ring Eileen shows.
Dean reacted to the soft touch and it’s all it took to take the final step. Their lips sealed once, making the touch spread out the excitement holded for so long.
“He’ll be fine” Jack asures them.
The shadow full in rage tossed Castiel back in a single move to the deepest layer, furiously.
“Hello?” Dean’s voice, shaking, echoed through the nothing, when another scream came in.
He piles the food in a salver, looking proud of himself.
“Dean, listen to me, what Cas did, it’s not on you”
Sam, eyes fixed on his brother, sees him get into the Impala, the bittersweetness does not go away but he smiles, he is truly happy for him, to get the chance to be himself.
“Good to see you too, Sammy”
“But before he left, he made quite a few changes down stare” She stood in front of Sam, extending her, now empty, glass asking Sam to fill it.
They split, still looking happy to see each other.
“No” Sam said. “just a part of it, I actually...” Sam looks nervous. “...I applied for the next semester of law school.”
“What? How?”
All strikes back, memories playing in his mind, from the first time he gazed at humankind, through the tragedies he fought to stop, all recording faster as he get to the present and
For eons the place remained in eternal silence, only the ones trapped here could hear the screams coming from the deepest layers. But now, there’s an un-stopped noise echoing from every direction you could turn to.
Dean, still amazed, brings the couple into his arms.
“I hope he’s not” Sam truthfully smiles as he sees his brother going his own way.
The moment has come. Dean’s half eying his brother, a bit awkward, Sam’s looking the same.
is the thing that cursed him..."
“Long story” Dean sighs “now you need to rest, humans sleep, remember?”
He holds her tighter, losing control of his emotions. Tears went down his cheek as he took a look at her face, eyes wide, searching for even the flick of what she was,
“Well, at least for a century or so” her tone was quite playfully. “I have enough to have fun for a while. Especially with our newest member” referring to Chuck. “But before I do that, there were some souls who were a bit out of place”
“And we can make you sleep...forever. That’s what you want, isn’t?” Amara looks defying, unimpressed. “You release him, and we can do that, do we have a deal?”
“No Sam, everything it’s not okay”
Before Dean notices, Eileen had two men on the ground submitted. She raises her gaze and sees a very confused Dean as she lets the men free.
“And Is Jack...” Dean started but got interrupted.
, blasting a light from his being making the shadow, as its true form, back down.
“Like the British men of letters?”
Jack confusedly took a step back, his eyes turned black, making Amara take his place once more but still in Jack’s body.
“I would like that” Castiel shyly smiles.
Thoughtfully, Dean answered. “No,
“You are kid” he said firmly “
“Unfortunately, his bond with the empty was also strong after that deal he made but like I said...”
“I know now, I am...” Dean emphasizes “...a man who loves, a man who loves this world, a man who loves his brother, a man who loves his family” he took a final, deep breath.
He remains quiet for a moment, thoughtfully.
“Just let me change, the trench coat it’s not good for sleeping.”
“Where have you been?”
Since the rapture was fixed by Jack, Sam tried to look for Eileen. Everyone made its way back after Chuck, but he couldn’t find her.
His words came out fast, eyes red. His pain was too much to bare alone any longer.
“Dean?” Castiel softly muttered, still sleeping.
“Dean, is everything okay?”
“I’m sorry I wasn’t bold enough” Dean whispered to someone who wasn’t there anymore.
“Pretending it didn’t happen won't help you”
“I used to be a man without faith, I used to be my father’s son, Sam’s brother, I was everyone but me, and now, because of you..."
Cas doesn’t leave Jack’s side.
“Then how did Cas--? He asked confused. Sam’s looking like he’s missing out a key piece, but still trying to complete the puzzle in his head.
There were no words that could be said to that.
“I’ve been thinking, maybe we could bring him back”
He recognizes it.
“I’m mad because
Dean, still awkward on his own skin, looks relieved as he smiles back.
“Don’t mention it, it tickles, but” he sounds exhausted. “Cas loves it so, it’s a keeper and he’s getting a few things from baby, I came first to get this in”
“Yeah” Sam sighed, defeated.
Dean is speechless, his gaze fixed on Castiel.
Sun hitting gently his face,
“So, this is your life now?” there’s a bittersweet tone on Dean’s voice.
“Why...” He sounded so broken “why did he had to do that Sammy?”.
Dean half-smiles softly, he gets it, but there was something wrong. Sam noticed.
Castiel sees him. Dean, it's calling for him. Was this another dream? But as he questioned the reality of it, he saw Dean’s arm, trying to reach him and he took it, no hesitation.
Dean sighs and hangs his head. “This is like, top ten worst first date conversations, but… you know what? Yeah. And no. I mean, it's stupid. Which is probably why Charlie tried to get me out here. I was— I didn't even know what the guy looks like. It was just texts, but there was something there, man. Or I thought there was. And I jumped the gun and screwed it up.” He lets out a bitter laugh. “Which, you should know is a theme, by the way. With me. Screwing things up Anyway, he said he needed time and… I took it badly. I went out, got drunk. Lost my phone. And it's been a while, and I haven't heard from him. I thought we'd at least be friends, you know?”
Dean checks his phone. No new texts, but the last one was only ten minutes ago. “He’s on his way,” he says, pocketing his phone. “So– what’s the deal, anyway? What am I doing? And why?”
"I've been watching the cats on the vine," Cas says out of nowhere.
“There isn’t a stairway. There are gates, which are quite like portals. I suppose there might–”
“I keep telling that kid to get a grip, but this time… Sam had it coming to him.” Bobby flips morosely through some notes on the table. He glances at Castiel. “Didn’t think it’d get to you, though.”
“Uh, all. Can I say all? It’s a little warm in here,” he says, pointedly ignoring the cameras facing him.
“Awesome. So. What’re you gonna do about this party?”
Castiel is already warm and drowsy from the wine, so it doesn’t take a lot to knock him out. He has saccharine dreams about a beautiful man who kisses him until they melt together.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel pointedly doesn’t reply for a few minutes. Predictably, Dean comes back wheedling.
The drive is short and tense. As they near the towering building, Dean slows the car. There’s a big red bus stopped haphazardly in the middle of the road. The windows are sprayed with blood. Torn limbs litter the sidewalk beside it, and the driver’s side window is smoking.
Castiel looks up at the tower down the street from the police station. The sun begins to rise, and the sky blushes a sweet rose. All the buildings are squat, barely over two stories. Except for one.
“Well.” Mark looks embarrassed. “It’s just stereotypes and I try not to assume. I dunno. You got that look.”
Where had he gone? Castiel had gone to hell, too. Oh, and he went willingly. He went to hell and he never truly came back. For Castiel made a fatal mistake: he touched the bare soul of a man corrupted and tortured and broken.
“Cas, you know,” Dean implores. “You know we’re not gonna find the answer in here. There isn’t one. “
Castiel smiles. “Thank you, Dean. Truly, I had a wonderful time.”
Dean whoops, startling a sleepy coworker. Six is not bad at all. He’d miss all the cooking, and they’d have to push it back a little, but he’d still be able to make it.
Dean is gorgeous. Of course he is, Castiel snaps at himself. He’s certainly older than he was in the first picture, but he’s aged like fine wine. The smile on Dean’s face is gentle and welcoming. It goes all the way up to his eyes. It’s a pity the picture is in black and white. Castiel wants to kiss the crows feet and feel the prickle of the stubble sanding Dean’s jaw against his lips. Dean looks good. He looks… happy. Relaxed. Looking at the picture Castiel aches to be with him.
“When was the moment we became best friends?”
“There’s something I need to tell you.”
In his fantasy, he was seductive and charming, and Dean responded effusively. In reality, Castiel had a tendency to wax purple instead of poetic, or at least Dean reacted as though he was constantly torn between embarrassed amusement and sometimes… affection.
“Yeah, me too.”
“Oh, good,” Dean huffs, relieved. He sags against the doorjamb and drops his jacket. “I mean, not that I didn’t–”
“Keep it running,” Dean barks at Castiel before taking off. Castiel obeys, keeping an eye on the back door of the store through the side mirror. It stays closed. He hears the sounds of Dean jumping into the fray. Thick, muffled grunts punctuated by the sounds of things, maybe even walls, breaking. One single gunshot. Then silence.
Bobby rolls his eyes. “So what do you wanna do? Run out there outgunned and stare down the devil?”
“That’s what I like to hear.”
The awkward feeling doesn’t abate. He feels Dean’s gaze on him and wonders if he should leave. If he should’ve left a while ago. Or perhaps, never have come to see Risa. He can’t understand why, though. It’s all rather confusing. Multiple, subtle meanings.
It’s more than that, though. Yes, the flirting is insincere and jocular, but moments like these make Castiel think that there’s more to things than he forces himself to believe.
“Will you ever stop making me feel like shit about my choices?”
Dean grins. “A beauty, ain’t she?”
“There will be beer at ours,” Dean offers. The seconds tick by, and Castiel doesn’t reply. “Look, I know it’s weird,” he starts. “You don’t have to–”
“I’m fine,” Castiel insists, but Dean has already turned away.
“This is the best idea you could come up with?” Dean asks, watching as Sam arranges the drinks, shot glasses, and question cards in front of him. “Why does it have to be roommates? Why not friends? Siblings?”
Dean manages a wheeze of a laugh at how smug Cas sounds. Sleep is coming to him gradually, and Dean only realizes it when he finds his gaze isn’t focused on anything in particular. Something about Cas soothes him and he doesn’t want to poke that and make sense of it. Maybe it’s the sound of Cas’s voice. Maybe it’s an angel thing. Maybe that’s what makes him say, “If you’re so keen on singing, it’s my birthday. So you should, y’know. Wish me.”
“Weed. Dean considered bringing you some,” the man explains when Castiel asks him what it is. Castiel distinctly remembers his name being Rich. Though it may have also been Mark. “You wanna try?”
“We’re feeling a little left out here,” Charlie says with a grin, and she drags Kevin and Castiel into the hug.
“You’re sticking with me,” Dean decides, lifting his jacket off the back of a chair and tugging it on. “I’m gonna get some food, we’re gonna check out the case I came here for, and then we’re driving to Bobby’s.”
Castiel’s phone beeps from the nightstand.
“I told you this the first time. I remember now. And I know you remember I told you. This is how it ends. You can’t force him to use the blade he controls on himself.”
He hangs up, and Dean rolls his eyes, handing the phone back to Castiel.
“Yes,” he says, with a measure of confidence.
“Hey, watch it!” Bobby snaps, entering the room.
Castiel finds Dean beside one of the jeeps early the next morning, hauling a duffel into the passenger seat. He’s in the driver’s seat by the time Castiel catches up to him.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says.
Castiel presses his lips together. He hasn’t felt like a good person for a while now. He certainly hasn’t been honest. “I’m sorry, Daphne. I never meant to hurt you.”
Dean breathes out sharply and sits down. “Fine, whatever.”
The rush of Dean’s sigh is a short burst of static over the line. “DeKalb, Illinois. Travel Inn on thirty eight. Room’s one-three-one.”
“... deputy shot him thrice, and claims that he stopped moving after the shot to his head, which is really strange. Going by what we know, this case is a dead end, but it just doesn’t feel over. Something’s off.” Sam pauses, and the phone speaker blares with the horn of a passing truck. “But this can wait. Bobby filled me in on the Heaven situation– that’s much more important. He’s already hit the books, and I’m gonna drive up there to help him.”
One of the older hunters standing near the back puts his hand up. “They’ve got generators at the edge of the camp, right by the unused cabins. We could get those running. For essentials?”
“When you said it was too soon, were you alluding to a break up?”
It hurts, but Castiel swallows it without complaint. Humans tell the truth, humans lie. At the end of the day, they’re only words. He is older than words. He is beyond words. Instead, he tries to reason.
Castiel was the one charged with finding the Righteous Man and so he was the one who found the Righteous Man. Dean Winchester, his face like hell, little more than the blood that once ran through his veins. All that was left of him was a blackened miasma, the rot of hell that took over his core. All that fear, all that pain, all that anger, all that shame.
Right now, the only person Castiel feels tethered to is Dean Winchester.
“Dean. What’re you doing?” Castiel asks. The contraction wobbles, destabilizing his words, reflecting his own unsteadiness. He’s off-kilter. Out of bounds. They don’t cross the lines. It hurts to swallow again, but his breaths are wet and labored and Castiel is afraid he might set off a coughing fit. Dean lifts his head to meet Castiel’s gaze. His expression is calculating.
Oh. The weird tightness in Dean’s chest melts away. He feels stupid for ever feeling like– it was a stupid doubt. Castiel was thoughtful to a fault. He cared about people, not just Dean.
Dean catches Castiel oscillating between the beer and wine aisles of the liquor section. It’s almost ten minutes before Castiel grabs a six-pack of hard lemonades, a bag of gummy bears, and a solitary toilet roll before moseying over to the counter. He’s wearing plaid pajamas, and a university hoodie.
As it turns out, the man Castiel believed to be named Mark is actually named Jim. And he was right. The camp goes down in little over a day. The pathways between the cabins are deserted. The cabins go through a reshuffling of occupants.
Dean grabs his plate and stands up. “I don’t need to deal with this shit.”
Dean accepts it with a wan smile, and that’s enough for now.
When they get back on the road, the town is still asleep. There are a few more cars on the road, but they’re all pointed east or south, heading out of DeKalb. The deaths have shattered the peace of the small college town, even though this isn’t the first shooting spree at this university. Castiel listens in silence as Dean narrates this information to him.
Bodies pour in from every direction. Behind the man at the front door, he recognizes their server from earlier in the day. Beyond her, strangers. Townsfolk. The throng of people move as though guided by a singular purpose.
Dean. He needs to warn Dean. They need to move. Leave. Preferably head back to the camp. He gets to his feet. His knees wobble. He takes two steps towards the door when he hears the quiet click of the safety and ducks. It’s too late. He gets hit in the shoulder and falls.
Cas smiles exhausted, anticipating the “fights” they will have because of the dog.
.” Rowena paused. “No really my area but figures it might be yours” she jokes.
Sam and Dean weren’t following any word and Jack notice the lost on their faces.
“I see you and I see the same self-loathing in your eyes, I feel the little of an opinion you have of yourself. You jump into the abysm thinking that’s the only way your life would matter”
Dean seems like he’s struggling, almost... ashamed?
Dean, from the back, looks at him also proud.
The shadow was done with it.
“Dean...Are you okay?” Sam asked, standing outside the room.
From outside of the bunker, Baby’s ready to ride. Down the entrance, Sam is side-hugging Eileen, watching Dean and Castiel save the few things they’ll take along.
“You’ll see, there are rules in this universe that do apply, that even the empty can’t ignore”
Dean remembered feeling weird recording this specific song, thought a few drinks might have helped, he never questioned why, maybe because it was easier than going deeper, to places he was afraid to reach.
Now resting over the wall behind him, Cas looks at Dean, conflicted. And that look, it’s all it took for Dean to speak out.
In the last second, Dean was able to hold Cas tight into his arms, protecting him from any harm.
“Happy birthday Jack” they all said.
Rowena, a bit smirk, sips from her drink.
“I-- won’t” a weak, husky voice whispered into the scene and instantly made Dean’s body tense up.
She walks slowly her way to the exit, smiling as she passes by their side.
“Well,” Cas tried to sound serious but failing. “you and me, maybe less dumb, less ass” He smiles.
At the shore, Jacks playing with Miracle and Eileen, running to each other with a ball.
The team spread up for the kitchen. Dean puts the jars near the table. Sam puts the box Dean held on the fridge. Eileen pulls out some beers from the freezer and Cas tries to hold Miracle but fails again.
Dean looks hopeful at the mention, he gave himself permission to smile, but his eyes are still focus on Castiel’s.
Dean hands on the box to Sam. Eileen stands next to him, arms open to a hug. He does. All excited he steps back a few.
He took several seconds to answers, as if he was debating to even do it in the first place, but Dean’s exhausted, and has lost the energy to hold himself back. Still, he doesn’t look back to his brother, instead, he stays focused on Castiel's carved name.
“I think we will be” Dean’s full in confidence.
Sam, trying to stand up, looking shocked to his brother, still holding an unconscious Castiel in his arms.
Searching for him, he sees a black mass emerging next to him as the voice gets stronger.
“It’s okay Dean, you don’t need to...”
Dean was looking more and more pissed. Sam notices.
“Not til tonight.”
“I’m sorry to leave you alone with him” he tells Eileen, looking, falsely, ashamed.
“I don’t understand, how is being chased by Billy his moment of true happiness?”
“Let’s get that into the fridge before it gets bad” Dean pointed.
Sam, still clueless, reacts to the mention of his brother. He doesn’t see anything through the rift. He tries to speak but gets interrupted.
He continued.
Dean spots Cas full handed and runs through him. “Here, let me.”
“What just happened...”
“What matters is that you are here now.” Cas puts his hands on his son’s shoulder.
The light of the lamp made a few shadows on his now naked chest, emphasizing the tone of his muscles. Dean looks stunned and awkwardly starts to move his arms and hands along his legs and crotch.
Dean sounded almost angry.
Eileen goes for a quick hug to Jack as well, smiling a bit awkward.
“You are not heaven’s soldier” Dean epiphany goes. “You are not a pet that walks behind us, you are not a disposable piece to sacrifice when we need to, and I
“But I don’t understand” Sam approaches his brother side, side watching Castiel.
“New deal. You lose his chains” Steps closer “and we stay”
“How’s Eileen?”
Jack made an attempt to snap his fingers out of that place, but the shadow was faster.
Sam, quite breathless, turned his sight to catch Rowena’s. He can’t say proper words. He’s only able to nods and whispered a soundless thank you, still holding Eileen.
“I mean sure, alphas are gone, the gates of hell are closed, Chuck’s rotting in the cage and even heaven has been all quiet, but...there’s still evil in this world, and I..”
“Cas, I need to...”
All of that, all the people that went along the road, still exist in this moment, the moment they all fought for, the world they create, where freedom is not only an option, but a possibility.
“Look I told you to fuck off, alright? This isn’t funny. I don’t know if you’re a demon or a different kind of douchebag but so help me God I will hunt you down and-”
“But what Dean lacks in maturity, he makes up for in a lot of other things. One of those things being his ability to love, and care. My brother raised me himself since I was a baby. He wasn’t just my brother, back then. He was also a parent. He never deserved that-- neither of us did, but it happened anyway, and I’m grateful that Dean did it so well, even though he was just a kid himself. He taught me how to look out for myself, how to stand up to bullies and how to ask out girls-- everything I know how to do today, all the
“I’ll do it.” He said with determination. The Empty seemed surprised by this, eyes widening a fraction. She seemed to quickly recover though, expression smoothing out into one of curiosity instead. “I know it kinda sucks down here, but earth is no better. Why do you want to get out so bad?” She murmured in fascination, leaning forward in her throne. Cas wondered if he should lie about his reasons, but then decided it didn’t matter. He had nothing to lose.
like, too. Dean tries his best to stay away from Cas inside the bunker for fear of having to confront his feelings, because change is still too terrifying for him. He knows he’s not being controlled anymore, and that also comes with the knowledge that it wasn’t Chuck forcing him to feel that way all these years. It was his own heart. Him. And Cas. And that is… A whole new piece of information he doesn’t want to confront.
“It’s true,” Dean started, taking a deep breath. “What I said is true. I… I do. Love you, that is.” Cas’ heart fluttered at his words, and he waited patiently for the man to continue. It took him a couple more deep breaths, but he got there eventually. “I’ve loved you for a long time, I think. Longer than I can remember. I never had the balls to say it before-- I mean, I didn’t think you’d be too happy about your best friend wanting to get in your pants-- not that that’s all I want from you, uh. Fuck. What I’m trying to say is that… When I thought I lost you, I hated myself. I still hate myself because of it-- because I didn’t say it back when you could’ve been gone forever. I was too… Shocked, I guess. But I should’ve said it back. I shouldn’t have let you die, thinking you weren’t loved. That you were just like a brother to me, because you’re not. I want more from you-- so much more, and it terrifies me that I could’ve had that all this time, and then just… Didn’t do anything about it.”
life. Together. And it’s fucking perfect.
They’d found a venue in the same town that Dean was first saved by Cas. Where his handprint seared into his skin-- the first touch of the man he had ever experienced. It was the perfect place, right by a lake near the cemetery he had crawled out of.
Before he knew it, the process was over, and he was left keeling on the floor. “Well, you got your wish, lover boy.” The Empty's mocking voice sounded above him. He tried to look up at her, but all he could see was a blurry shape that vaguely resembled a body. His eyes began to droop closed as he heard her hum a foreign tune under her breath. It sounded like a lullaby, and with it, he drifted away.
Dean snorts, giving him an amused look but nodding nonetheless. “Yeah, it is.”
Sam turns to Eileen, then back to the camera. “We were thinking Bobby if it’s a boy, and Jo if it’s a girl. You know, in honor of them.” This news only causes Dean to cry harder, and Cas had to pat him on the back to calm him down a bit (this continues for five minutes, maybe more). But Dean doesn’t care. He’s happy. This is their life-- the life that they deserve, that they built. And Dean is really fucking proud of his baby brother.
“I’m gonna be an uncle-- and you’re going to be a dad. Holy shit.” He says, then quieter, “Holy shit.” That’s when he begins to cry, wet hot tears of joy spilling from his eyes, because this is
”Yes, I’m serious. I’ll do anything.” He said, giving the woman (thing?) a serious look. He had one shot at this, and he just hoped he had something worth her time-- something that could save him. The Empty tilted her head at him, smirk wilting as her face took on a more serious expression. She stepped away from him, falling back onto a throne that appeared out of smoke, the furls of grey curling away to reveal the wide set chair.
“Shit, I’m sorry, man.” He grumbles, guilt piling down on him. “I should’ve took you out shopping for something for the winter… I don’t even think you have enough blankets to keep you warm, do you?” Cas shakes his head, and that’s when Dean realizes what he has to do. It takes more courage than he’s had this past week, but deep down inside he’s a good person, and fear can’t come in the way of that. So he gives Cas some appropriate clothes to change into-- hoodie and sweatpants-- and then comes the hard part. He invites him into bed. Literally.
“Just because she’s in labor doesn’t mean she’s going to have the baby
“Are you sure you don’t mind?” Cas asks it so gently, and so fearfully, that Dean can feel his heart begin to soften. “Of course not.” He replies.
Sam calls Dean one day, voice a mixture of excitement and nervousness. “Am I on speaker? Put me on speaker-- actually, no, make it facetime.” It’s 11pm on a Monday night, and Dean had just been planning on heading to bed, but he does as he’s told with a grumble, wondering what Sammy could possibly want to tell him this late when he knows he has to get up early.
The voice cuts off after that, and Castiel opens his eyes to the black abyss once more. He lifts a hand to his wet face and wipes the tears away, smiling at Dean’s words. He loved him. They loved each other. It hurts more, now, knowing that. He was so sure it was unrequited-- that his years of pining were all one-sided. Why did Dean love him? He wishes he could ask.
“Hey, are you almost ready?” Sammy asks outside of the door, and when Dean doesn’t answer, opens it up. Upon seeing Dean’s thinly veiled anxiety, Sam pulls him into a hug. “Dude, it’s gonna be okay. I promise.” Realistically, Dean knows it is. But the voice in the back of his head isn’t helping. It mocks him, and makes him question everything he knows to be true.
“Are you ready?” His head snaps up at Cas’ voice, and he takes in a deep breath, then nods. Cas smiles and takes his hand, and right when they’re about to knock, the door is being opened. An older woman draped in blue scrubs is holding a baby, and Dean feels his heart stutter as he looks down at the little bundle of cloth and, hiding beneath it, a small red face.
He and Cas make their way over to Eileen, Sam trailing behind them. They wait for her to finish her conversation with the other women before they talk to her. “How are you feeling?” Cas asks while signing, and Eileen raises an eyebrow as if to say ‘is that a serious question?’ Dean chuckles, giving the woman a gentle pat on the shoulder. “I’m doing better now that I’ve finished pushing out 8 pounds of baby.” He laughs harder at that, and gives her a sympathetic look.
“Yeah, well, it sounds like a lot of fun.” He says sarcastically.
They walk down the aisle hand in hand, stepping over the leftover flower petals that Bobby had thrown out (he was their flower boy, because screw gender roles). They get into Baby together-- and yes, Dean went all out, writing the silly ‘just married’ on the back with the cans tied to the rear as they ride off together, because no matter how many times he’s said “no chick flick moments” that has always been a total lie. He fucking loves them.
Cas rolled his eyes, letting out an annoyed sigh. He didn’t
He makes it halfway to the bunker running full speed until he crashes into something-- or more like some
The bunker is full of people-- Garth, Jody and the girls, Donna, Eileen and Sam, Jack. Everyone he knows and loves. He wasn’t the one who wanted to do the Christmas party-- that was all Cas’ idea-- but he’s glad he went along with it.
So, instead, Dean avoids it. Like usual.
He takes a deep breath and pulls away from the hug. “What if I forget my lines?”
Christmas was never big for the Winchesters. Dad was usually gone, and it was just him and Sammy to celebrate. But there wasn’t a lot they could do
Dean’s face popped into the forefront of his mind, and he desperately clung to it.
“And you know, it hurts even more that you gave so damn much for me, and I didn’t appreciate that enough. You
Cas changed into the clothes Dean gave him-- a long-sleeved blue sweater, and a pair of checkered green and grey pajama pants. They were a bit big, but they were comfortable. When he came back into the bedroom, Dean seemed to forget what he was going to say, opting for staring at the man instead. Cas felt that flutter inside his chest again, and sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck as he waited. “Um, you look good-- the outfit, looks good, that is….” Dean fumbled over his words, and it brought a smile to Cas’ face to see that the reaction was because of him, and how he looked. He felt giddiness, underneath the fatigue.
“Goodbye, Sammy.” He says, and there’s nothing but joy that he feels in the moment. As he walks away, then looks back, he knows his little brother is going to do just fine.
again. I can’t stand it. All the angels and demons have been screaming and bitching and I need a break. I want them to sleep again. And, well… You’re a special angel, aren’t you? I mean, you completely defied God’s plan, even when he wrote it into existence. There has to be something different about you that I can use to my advantage. If not….” She made a rude gesture with her thumb, pretending to slice it across her throat as her tongue lolled out.
He and Cas tumble to the floor, a tangle of limbs and echoing groans coming from both men. Dean doesn’t try to move, though. Cas is below him, and they both sort of just… Stare at each other for a while. “Dean…” Cas finally speaks, voice the familiar low rumble that Dean has grown to love over the years. He can feel his eyes begin to water, relief sinking into his tired bones
“I can’t fix the heat yet until Sam gets back-- which, I already texted him and he should be back by morning-- but until then you can, um, stay in here if you want.” He says (more like mumbles) the words. “There’s enough blankets for both of us and I figured body heat will keep us warm, you know? But like, not from each other obviously. I meant Miracle. Miracle’s…. Body heat.” Yeah, he’s a total mess. There’s no way he’s getting through this without making a giant fool of himself.
When he finally awoke, it was with a jolt. Someone was shaking his shoulder-- it wasn’t a painful shake, but it still shocked him nonetheless. He reached out with his hand, trying to smite the person with his grace before he realized he couldn’t. That’s when he came into focus. Dean. Relief and joy flooded through his aching body, and tearful smiles lit up on both their faces. “You’re actually here.” The man murmured in disbelief. Cas’ eyes flicked behind him for a split second, spotting Sam a few feet behind-- trying to give them some semblance of privacy.
“Dean, I’m okay.” Cas murmurs, voice ever so soft. It’s just then Dean realizes just how tightly he’s hugging the other man, and quickly steps back. He apologizes profusely, and Cas just
“Hunting is something that was forced on me, you know?” He explains one night over dinner. Cas had made them spaghetti with syrup and candy-- something that was inspired by the movie Elf (Dean was regretting letting the man watch it now). “Dad told me what to do and I did it. Always the good little soldier… But the way I’m saving people this time isn’t from monsters. There’s a system, there’s a structure that I’ve never had before. I mean, sure it’s still risky but at least I can see what I’m getting myself into and I can say ‘okay, this is what I want to do.’ I’ve never had the choice before, Cas. I need this.”
Sam is out on a hunt with Eileen, insisting that someone stays behind to watch the dog and the bunker. So, he does. And so does Cas.
“Do you mind if I borrow some change?” He asked a feeble old woman on the bench. She stared at him through her large, pink glasses, and it was as if he could physically see the gears turning behind her eyes. Without a word, she dug through a small purse that matched her blindingly pink getup, pulling out a handful of change and dropping it in his hand. She didn’t even smile, just gave him a solemn nod and shooed him off.
“And do you, Castiel, take this lawfully wedded man to be your husband?” Cas barely has the chance to say ‘I do’ because Dean is diving in for a kiss-- too eager to wait any longer. He can taste salty tears mixed in, and he isn’t sure if they’re from him or Cas. That doesn’t matter, though. What matters is that he’s kissing his
It’s cold out, and he usually spends the days in his room covered under piles of blankets cuddled up with Miracle. It’s nice, and it’s a safe haven for him-- because it seems whenever he leaves the room he bumps into Cas. In the kitchen, in the living room, the man pops up everywhere. It’s awkward, since they still haven’t addressed the elephant in the room even after days of Cas being there. Eventually, though, they’re forced to.
And when later that month Cas starts studying, and he heads off to work every morning, he’s even more okay with things. He has a stable life-- or somewhat stable, at least. Somedays he’ll come home with tears on his face, explaining how he had lost another person on the job, and Cas would push away his school books and pat the bed. He’d hold him until he felt semi-fine, and then some more. And Dean would do the same for Cas, whenever the man stressed too much about his work, or when he woke up at night, panting in the dark for air and begging for Dean to turn the light on to make sure he was here-- that he was okay, and not in The Empty.
The reception turns out to be even more emotional than the actual wedding when Sam gives his best man speech.
When he next awoke, it wasn’t in darkness. Castiel could see red behind his closed eyelids, and with some effort, he managed to pry them open. He squinted up at the bright light, and it took him a few seconds before he realized that what he was seeing was the sun. He was on earth. A bubble of joy burst in his chest, and he let the relief sink into his aching bones. Cas tried to savor the moment as much as he could before he finally rolled into a sitting position. It took a lot more effort than usual-- the process of getting his grace ripped away from him was brutal and left him sore and in pain. But it was worth it, because he was here again. Just as he had promised.
Dean is holding him now, bouncing his now two-year-old nephew on his knee. Cas makes his way over with two red solo cups, handing one to Dean. “There’s beer in this, right?” He asks, then gives it a sniff, blanching at the smell. “Fruit punch? Babe, no offense, but I’m gonna need something a lot stronger than this.” Cas gives him a dirty look (and not the good kind).
Once he’s outside of the room, that’s when he finally slows down. His heart is in his throat, and there’s sweat dripping from his hair and he feels like if he opens that door the world is going to explode because this is all too unreal. Suddenly, he’s right back where he started. 26, outside of his brother’s door as his knees wobble from anxiety and a fist is raised to knock. And he doesn’t know what’s going to be on the other side of the door-- doesn’t know if it’s going to be Eileen on the ceiling with a fire blazing all around. He wonders if he’ll have to pull his baby brother out for the third time. Wonders if they’ll fall right back into revenge and hunting-- and that
It was everything Cas had hoped it would be, but it never escalated further than just the soft press of lips. They were both tired, and eventually, sleepy kissing turned into just sleep. They held each other through the night, and through every night after. They would grow old together, too, one day. But for now, they were just making up for lost time.
And that’s how they spent the rest of that night, cozied up under the covers with Cas pressed against his side and Miracle laying over their legs. Sam didn’t question it the next morning when he came barging into the room, the only thing he had to say was “
He wanders the empty space in silence most days (if you can call them days), sometimes pacing, sometimes crying. There’s nothing else he can do, really. The only company he has are his thoughts. That changes, though, one day. He stops his pacing when he hears it. A prayer. A familiar voice echoes in his head, and his eyes begin to water as he realizes who it is. It’s been so long since he’s heard Dean.
“I need to get back to Dean Winchester.” He said. “Dean… He needs me.” He averted his eyes from The Empty's piercing gaze, instead opting to stare at the black beneath his feet. He wanted to turn away, hide his emotions from the evil in front of him; it was never good to be vulnerable around enemies. Maybe lying
An hour passed-- the amount of time he needed to walk to the nearest store. The people passing him by gave him strange looks, and he realized eventually that it was because his clothes were covered in blood and he looked like a
“Because you’re you,” Cas says, and it’s only then that he realizes he’s been speaking out loud. “I meant everything I said before I died, you know. You are the most selfless and caring man I know, and you always will be. You
He swerves just in time, anxiety thrumming through his body as anticipation builds even more.
Dean nods, clenching his jaw as he tries to reign in his emotions. There’s no need to cry twice at a party. “Thanks, Sammy. I’m proud of you-- of
He probably wasn’t going to be allowed into the actual store due to that very reason, so he opted instead to use the phone booth outside. Except he didn’t have a quarter. Goddammit. With a sigh, he turned to one of the people on the sidewalk, putting on his friendliest face.
They baby-proofed everything a while ago-- when Sam and Eileen made their first visit with Bobby-- but Dean does a second (okay, triple) check just in case, making sure all the outlets are covered and all dangerous objects and weapons are either out of reach or locked up somewhere that no baby-- let alone man-- can get into.
It’s a sloppy kiss, but it’s his favorite by far.
“I love you, too.” Dean blurts out, then immediately slaps a hand over his mouth. He had meant to say it, but to actually hear the words out loud was completely different. He never thought he’d be able to, but there they were now, lingering in the air. Cas was just staring at him like he’d grown two heads, and Dean had the feeling he looked the same. They sat like that for what seemed like forever before Miracle’s whining snapped him out of his daze. He glanced at the dog who, seeming to sense the tension in the air, was looking back and forth between the two men as if to say “what are you idiots doing just say something.” And, well, Dean had to agree with the animal. This was rather absurd.
Months had now gone by at the bunker, and Dean knew things were going to change soon. Sam and Eileen were going to move out soon and get a place of their own, and Dean was happy for them, even though there was always going to be a part inside him that insisted he keep his brother at his side. It was drilled into him ever since he was little that he was Sammy’s protector, but now was the time he needed to let him go. Had to accept that there was no big threat out there-- just the little monsters in between. But even that didn’t matter anymore. Sam hadn’t been on a hunt in weeks, and when Dean thought about it, neither had he. They didn’t have to do that anymore-- it wasn’t what their freedom looked like.
Cas is starting to get annoyed.
This is the man who sacrificed everything for him. Who had the balls to blurt out a love confession-- the one thing that brought him true happiness-- right before he died. This man did all of that… For Dean. And what did he get in return? Dean completely avoiding him. Cas had to die without hearing one I love you, and Dean can’t even stand to be around the man because he’s afraid. He’s a coward. But Cas… Cas deserved so much better. Why Dean?
“Sorry, uh…” He hesitates before continuing. “I just don’t have a lot of joyful Christmas memories, ya know? Its hard to not focus on them during this time of year… I mean, dad was either away hunting or he was home drinking. It wasn’t pretty either way. We either got cuts and bruises for presents, or nothing at all.” He gives a shrug and takes a long swig out of his cup, avoiding Cas’ eyes.
“Let's go home.” Sam says. And they do. They drive in silence, and Dean doesn’t try to break it. He’s comfortable and wants to savor in the feeling of getting such a big win. When they get back, though, he’s anything but calm. He pounds up the stairs, and Sam doesn’t bother asking why. Dean has a feeling that he knows, and for some reason that doesn’t seem to bother him anymore.
“Dean Winchester…” Cas begins, opening a small, black velvet box. There’s a shiny ring inside, two silver lines weaving around each other to make a circle. It’s beautiful. “You have done more for me than you can even imagine-- more than I thought was possible from humanity. But will you do me one more thing, and say ‘yes’”?
Everyone stops what they’re doing to stare at them, and Dean’s anxiety is rising with every second passing by. But that’s when it happens. Cas is getting down on one knee and Dean feels like he’s going to pass the fuck out right then and there because there is no way this is happening.
So he went for it. He leaned across the dog, face mere inches from the other man’s, but then stopped. And stared. He looked into Cas’ wide blue eyes, savoring the utter astonishment and hope there, before finally sealing their lips together in a gentle kiss. It was sweet and lasted only a few seconds, but it was enough to have Dean feeling like he was floating. His heart was bursting within his chest, as if the touch of the other man’s lips was the one thing to set it off. It felt amazing, and he wondered in the back of his mind why he waited so damn long for this.
have been a better idea, but alas, it was too late. He could hear The Empty laugh, a mocking and irritating sound to his ears.
“Dean, please go the speed limit.” Cas says in a voice of warning. If he was still an angel, Dean is sure he’d be forced to move from his heavenly mojo powers, but as it was right now, Cas could do nothing but place a very tight and rather painful grip on his shoulder. “Watch out for the truck--
there was anything special about him, but she did have a point. He was able to go against God and save Dean-- that had to be something, right? He thought back on the events that had happened in his existence, pondering them carefully. The leviathans, defying heaven, being controlled by Naomi… Maybe he was special, just not in a good way. Literally, his life had been pretty terrible. “What do you need me to do?” He asked.
he thought, feeling the warm presence of the man’s memories start to soothe his pain. The grace being ripped from his body turned to a dull ache as he focused on the happy, loving moments they had shared together. The memories were like honey for his soul, leaving him to feel soft and warm inside. A sweetness that although didn’t cure his pain, reminded him of why he was enduring it.
“Thank you, Dean,” and then, “do you want to talk about it?” The question seemed to make Dean even more flustered, even though Cas didn’t specify exactly what he wanted to talk about. It could be about his death, his revival once more-- but they both knew it was about the love confession. The rest they would get to later. After Dean stopped fussing with the sleeves of his shirt and managed to sit down, Cas took the spot next to him and give him an encouraging smile.
it makes it hard to do so. So instead he watches Cas. He watches the way his eyes shine with humor at the shitty children jokes being made by Bugs Bunny, he watches the curl of his lips-- a real smile that reaches his eyes. He just…. Watches. And after a while, his own happiness begins to wilt.
at him. And it’s different now, because Dean knows exactly what that look means. His eyes are soft, and his mouth is upturned in a small smile. It’s how you look at someone you love. Cas loves Dean. He can feel the words on the tip of his tongue, hovering there, ready to come out. But they won’t. Not now. It’s not the right time.
“He’s saved me more times than I can count, and I know he’d do it again without hesitation. And I’d do the same. But that’s not what our jobs are anymore. I’ve got Eileen, and now he’s got Cas. I trust Cas to look out for my brother. I know he will. But Dean, no matter what, you’re always going to be my big brother. And I’m always gonna love you, man.”
“Yeah, I’m good.” He says with a smile. And this time he means it.
Cas let out a breath of relief at the words. He knew Dean wasn’t stupid, but drunk Dean could make questionable decisions sometimes-- especially when those decisions were governed by his emotions. “I’m going to find somewhere to wait.” He said, looking at the map. He noticed a park listed nearby. “I’ll be at a park called Palma. Goodbye, Dean.” He heard a sharp intake of breath, and realized his choice of words might’ve not been the best-- a familiar echo of their last goodbye.
'Happily ever after' isn't something just at the end of a storybook. It’s something you make yourself. And this… This is Dean’s forever. Cas is his forever.
And he did. The whole story-- minus the parts about Dean’s prayer and how The Emptyhad mocked his love for the man. Besides all that, he filled them in with all the important parts. The deal, losing his grace, etc. It took up the most of their trip, well into the night. The brothers in turn filled him in on their adventures with Chuck, and Cas felt even more relief at the fact he was finally defeated. When they finally arrived back to the bunker, Sam turned to him. “I’m happy you made it back-- even though you lost your grace again. We missed you a lot.”
Everyone they know and love are there, and that thought should’ve made Dean excited but instead he was just nervous-- because he’s there, standing in front of the full-length mirror in one of the changing rooms and asking himself: do I deserve to marry the man I’m going to meet at the alter? The truth is, he doesn’t know, and he’s afraid everyone else knows it too.
He gives Sam a side hug as he look down at his nephew. Everyone is silent as they watch Bobby coo and smile, chubby hands curled around two of Eileen’s fingers. “You’re going to be a great dad, Sammy.” He says, looking into Sam’s shining eyes. “This is your family now, and it’s gonna be a hell of a lot better than what we had. I promise.”
His hands are at Cas’ waist, with  Cas’ around his neck. They sway back and forth in circles, Dean occasionally giving the other man a spin. There’s a spotlight on them, making the crowd seem to disappear. It’s like it’s just the two of them, together.
What sounded like a sob cut through the phone, and Cas’ heart sank when he realized that Dean was crying-- it sunk even further when he realized he was, too. They stayed like that for a while, and Cas smiled through his tears, hoping that Dean was doing the same. Smiling, that is. He always wanted Dean to smile. The man deserved it. “Where are you, Cas?” Dean finally asked.
“Let's get you all cleaned up, alright?” Dean says. And that’s all that happens, and it’s okay-- for now.
The nurse brushes past him, taking his baby nephew god knows where. That’s when Sam seems to notice his nervous expression. “Hey, man, don’t freak. It’s nothing dangerous, they just think he has an extra chromosome. They need to do a blood test to determine it, but that’s what they’re leaning towards.” Dean has no idea what any of that means, and Sam seems to notice. “It means they think he has down syndrome-- did you ever pay attention in school?”
They talk for a while, everyone catching up and enjoying the company. Jack tells him about heaven, and about what they’re doing to change it for the better. “No more walls,” they say. “Everyone you love, all together. Not just memories, but actual people.” Dean likes the sound of it. He thinks about what his heaven will look like-- Cas, Sammy, Bobby… Everyone he loves, all together. There’s a contentment inside him from the thought.
He didn’t get the chance to say anymore than that-- Cas was already crashing back at him with a firm press of his lips. It was slightly painful, but eased into soft. Dean could taste tears mixing into the kiss, and he wasn’t sure if they were from him or Cas. Maybe both. It was one hell of an emotional rollercoaster for both of them, and he made sure to savor every minute of it until Miracle got frustrated and began whining for more attention to be directed at him.
They get married in April, with Spring just beginning to set in. It’s still a bit chilly out, but that’s okay because there is no way Dean’s wearing a tux in hot weather (and Cas agrees).
“We went over them like eighty times last night, I’d be surprised if you forgot.”
So he helped them pack the boxes, helped them move into their new house. It wasn’t that far off from where the bunker was (Sam had promised to not move too far away) and Dean was comfortable with the space between them. It was time they split up for good, and Dean knew that Eileen would treat his brother right. But it was still a sad day for everyone.
Dean feels choked up as Cas continues. “And I know that’s hard for you to do. It’s okay if you have flashbacks, or if you’re feeling overwhelmed. All you have to do is tell me, and I’ll be here for you. Always.” He finishes, and Dean sniffles, wiping a hand across his wet face. Cas gets him. He doesn’t understand completely, but he gets him. He’s there for Dean, and to him, Cas is still an angel for that.
He says. “It could take hours or days, we don’t need to rush.” Logically, Dean knows this. But he can’t miss this, no matter what. He needed to be there for his baby brother-- needed to be there for his
When Cas and him get home, this time they are met with just the wagging tail of Miracle, and soft barks of happiness. No Sammy, no Eileen. This was their place now. He turned to Cas, giving him a small smile before saying, “Does this mean I can make breakfast naked now?” And Cas rolls his eyes before pulling him into a kiss. This is their home, this is their life.
“I don’t know if you can hear this, Cas-- I might just be talking to air for all I know, but, uh, I miss you. I… I can’t do this without you. I need you, I-” Cas can hear the inhale of a sharp breath, and he closes his eyes, imagining he’s there with the man. “I love you, too. You’re a goddamn idiot for dying like that right after saying that to me, y’know? If I knew before, when we still had time… Well, I get it’s useless to think about it now, but if there’s any chance you can come back-- any chance I can
He can feel the man’s stare boring into the side of his head, and it makes his skin crawl because this is the most he’s exposed to Cas about his specific past with John Winchester. “Dean,” Cas says, and Dean takes in a deep breath before looking back. “I’m sorry you had to go through that. I am, but… I don’t want you to deal with your feelings in unhealthy ways. I want you to make better memories, with this family. I don’t want you to focus on the old.”
Then he remembers that working three jobs (more or less) doesn’t really leave him with any time to have a personal life.
“Whatever,” Dean says with a dismissive brandish of the bottle in his hand. “This ain’t a democracy. You don’t like it, you can leave.” He starts to walk and the woman flinches. For a brief moment, he looks crushed, but his expression deadens and he continues to walk towards Castiel. “We need to talk.”
Sam heaves a distraught breath, staring at him.
“Good riddance. Sounds like the opposite of a problem to me.”
But, Castiel has to admit, this is part of what he loves about being with Dean. Every day is a thrill. Something different. Dean pushes him just past the point of comfort, and joins him there, and Castiel always come out of the experience having enjoyed himself in ways he hadn’t known possible.
The hunter. The savior. He sees it now. He sees it in Dean.
Seeing Castiel walk up to the stage and receive his diploma is a thrill. Dean’s chest swells with pride, and a mix of emotions he couldn’t quite name yet– God, he’s sick with affection for the fool. Before Dean realizes it, he’s on his feet, whooping and clapping as Castiel’s name echoes across the stadium. Sam stands as well, so Dean felt a little better about the realization that slammed him seconds ago. Castiel glanced their way, stormy blue eyes brightening as they met Dean’s, his lips lifting in a gummy smile and...
“What is that?”
“I can meet you.” Sam sounds desperate. Hopeful.
Chuck turns to Castiel in relief. “Her son wants to join Risa’s gun training session and she doesn’t like it. She doesn’t think anyone should be learning about guns at all.”
It’s totally worth drawing the attention of half the coffee shop to see the way Castiel gets all pink and smiley and just
Castiel stares. “Oh.”
“Can you tell?” Castiel asks, curious.
Because of course Castiel was gonna leave. There’s no way he’d stick around in this small town. Especially not for someone like Dean, who had zero future prospects. Who struggled to get a job as a freaking waiter. Even the damn pizza place had turned him down. It was a small consolation that Auto Singer came through.
There is certainly a friendship here. Unexpected, but strong. They share a decent amount of interests– even if Dean likes to pretend that he’s too cool to share them, his knowledge of them betrays him. But most importantly, they connect in the spaces where they’re different, fitting like puzzle pieces. Where Castiel slips and struggles to talk about himself, Dean draws him out with easy conversation, and shared anecdotes about himself. Where Dean is self-deprecating and blasé, prone to joking at inappropriate moments, Castiel is able to sense the core of the issue to provide a reassurance that actually seems to get through to Dean.
The bell above the door chimes when he pushes it open, but no one seems to take notice. There’s a crash from somewhere further in the shop, a muffled curse and some laughter– then the sound of a door being pushed open.
Dean grits his teeth, and says, “If you ever loved me. If it was ever true, then you would do this for me.”
He briefly considers shaving and decides against it. When he looks in the mirror this time, he sees himself differently. He’s fragile. Human. Pink about his lips and the tips of his ears and the corners of his eyes. Fallen and breaking. It's an ugly sight.
Once he’s ensured that Jack and Risa have fallen into a pattern for a swift dispatch of goods from the store into the jeep, Dean returns to the passenger seat. The door is open and he has one foot in when a scream rends the air. It’s from within the store. It’s Jack.
“No?” Dean’s chuckle is dark and warm when Castiel spreads his legs and sags closer. “What happened to all that stuff about tearing up the pages? Making it up as we go?” He squeezes on a downstroke, smears a bead of precum on the upstroke, and then repeats it all over again.
Dean nods, looking marginally hopeful. He scarfs down his burger. “This is good. It’s pretty good, Cas. You did good.”
It’s a Monday morning when Dean gets fired.
, the Indian restaurant near Daphne’s work. Castiel slips his phone out and glances at it under the table. No new texts.
Dean chuckles, low and warm. “You think you got something I’d want, sweetheart?”
Castiel shrugs. “Sure. It’s just a formality.”
He grits his teeth at the agony shooting down his protesting arm and lifts it to take aim when the sound of gunshot makes him flinch. The Croat freezes, mouth open. Dead center in the woman's forehead is the small black circle of a bullet. She dies without another sound.
“Listen, Cas, you can still take my help with you know, money. And things. You keep a couple credit cards on you. For emergencies and whatnot. Charlie set us up, so it’s gotten a lot easier. So just - get a room here or something. Sleep on a goddamn bed. I don’t get
“He was.”
Sunlight slants low on the ground through the barred windows. Castiel wakes from his fitful, shallow slumber to a knock at the door. He rubs grit from his eyes and sees Dean haloed by the light, standing on the threshold, looking down at him.
“Sam, stop.” Dean orders. “You wanna help Bobby dig into the lore? Great. I don’t think coming up here to meddle with this case is a good idea.”
“Disastrous.” Dean takes another step into the room and it reveals a long spatter of dried blood up the side of his jeans. “City’s an all-out war zone. Military’s gunning down everything that moves ‘cuz they’re overrun by Croats and they don’t go down easy.” He crosses his arms and admits, “Lost two guys. One of ‘em was slow. Always been a careless deadweight. The other– he was... good. Unlucky.”
Castiel loses his nerve. He sets the phone down on the nightstand and turns away. He shouldn't reply. But it buzzes a few seconds later, and then again, and he’s drawn to it inexorably.
“Can I kiss you?”
? You’re not straight?”
Castiel shakes himself out of the daze. No. He was an angel. He is still capable of austerity. It’s none of his business. What happens between them, whatever happens, is none of his business. Not his to have any opinion about.
Dean processes this for a second, trying not to smile. “So you're saying you’d help me if it was like, a revenge murder, but not if I just did it to get my rocks off or something?”
right. He tries really hard not to hope that he’ll be getting to see Castiel again. Shaking himself internally, Dean focuses on staying professional for the interaction as he hands Castiel his brand new rewards card, and rushes through explaining all the stupid rules and crap.
“I hope this work”
Rowena snapped her way to the nursery, same place as the last time Eileen was brought back.
This is a silent place, nothing in it, only him and now, as an aparece, Amara steps in.
Dean snuffs out the music, still avoiding all kinds of connection with his little brother.
An echo went through the hallway as Sam walked to check on his brother. The sound startles him, making him rush to the room, worried.
Sam took a few steps back and Dean made his way to catch his brother.
This is for Dean, the moment all dots are tying, and every peace found its place.
The shadow, a bit intimidated, smiled at the mention of the angel.
He looks to Cas, then, and finds that the man is already looking at him-- albeit in concern. “Are you okay, Dean?” He asks quietly, and Dean gives a small shrug of his shoulders. This is a conversation for another place and time, one that requires a lot more balls and a lot less anxiety. It was gonna be a while for him to even consider the possibility of them having kids, and for now they were okay where they were.
“I love you.” He whispers as the music plays in the background. He rests his forehead against Cas’ as they sway together.
Dean ends up actually enjoying the rest of the night right up until presents come up. This was just his and Sammy’s thing before, and it feels wrong to have all these people here-- even if they’re people he loves. Sam seems to have the same feeling, because he’s at his side right when the first bag is passed to someone. “It’s weird, right? Like, good weird?”
Dean finds out that Cas is human now-- it was supposedly the only way he could get out of the Empty. He had to become something other than supernatural to escape. Unfortunately, losing his grace meant staying with the Winchesters far more than Dean was comfortable with. Sure-- he was relieved to have the man back and wanted to spend every second at his side to make sure he was okay-- but that’s exactly what he
“You’re holding a baby, I’m not going to give you alcohol.” He scolds Dean, plopping down by his side. He opens his arms in a silent request to hold Bobby, and Dean hands the baby carefully over. “Plus, what’s so terrible about a Christmas party that you feel the need to consume alcohol?”
This is exactly what he’d always wanted for his brother-- for both of them. And to have it actually come true… It feels unreal. Cas wipes away his tears with a smile, speaking up for him. “So any thoughts on a name yet?”
He could hear shuffling on the other end of the line, then a familiar jingle of keys. “Dean, I don’t think you should be driving after you’ve been drinking.” He muttered, a pang of anxiety echoing in his chest. It mixed with the relief settled there, and for a moment he just closed his eyes and savored the feeling. He hadn’t felt that way in a while, and although it wasn’t the best feeling, it was nostalgic. He could hear the irritated sigh from Dean, the man not even questioning how Cas knew he was drunk-- they both knew the answer anyways. “I’m going to let Sammy drive, don’t worry about it.”
This was one of those moments in life where any small mistake could send the situation into hellfire. What if there were complications? What if Eileen needed a c-section or some other scary bullcrap?
And, of course, that’s also when the heating goes out. So not only are they stuck inside together, but they’re also slowly turning into popsicles. “Dean, we have to do something about the c-cold.” Cas says to him later that evening, hovering in the entrance of his room. The man is awkward, avoiding eye contact as usual. Dean is the same way, though, so he can’t blame him. With a sigh, he crawls out from under his cocoon of blanket, Miracle whining as he does so. He immediately shivers from the loss of warmth, and can suddenly understand why Cas is shaking there in nothing but a thin button up with slacks. It’s not very ‘for the weather.’
“I love you, too.” Cas says, and Dean doesn’t have to worry about it anymore. These aren’t the words of a dying angel anymore, they’re the words of a man with his whole life in front of him--
“You know, I wish we had this growing up.” Dean says, looking around at the happy faces of his family. There’s a pain in his chest, and it doubles as he looks back at his baby brother. “ I wish you had this.” Sam gives him a soft look, then pulls him into a tight hug.
“Is there anything I can do?” He called out into the empty space. His voice echoed, the only sound in the quiet, endless place. He let out a frustrated huff, rubbing a hand over his growing stubble. He turned around in circles-- looking for something,
Seconds passed by, minutes soon following. All that Cas could hear was the buzz of the line, and for a moment, he thought that Dean had hung up again before the man spoke, “It’s really you, huh.” He sounded more sober this time, and Cas hoped he had drunk some water-- but maybe it was just the shocking piece of information that made him sober up. “Yeah, it’s me.”
parts of myself, I give credit to Dean for.”
Cas comes up to him, then, turning towards Sam. “Do you mind if I steal him away for a second?” Sam gives him a knowing look that makes Dean slightly suspicious-- even more so when Cas pulls him into the middle of the room and not behind a closed door to make out (like he had expected-- could you blame him?).
Dean kisses him again and graciously offers, “Sleep on it. I’ll come back tomorrow.”
Castiel considers his options. Continuing to talk about this is only going to antagonize Dean more. They have time. The world will still be ending next week.
Castiel spreads his legs and finds himself with a lapful of his naked boyfriend. “Yes.”
Not one of the possessed survived the massacre in the student center. The cops handed over copies of what they could get at such short notice. Only a small percentage of the students were actually in their system. The files contain generally useless documents– transcripts, administrative records from the university, and in one notable case, a job application attached with a letter of recommendation.
Despite that, he’s at Castiel’s apartment before he can stop himself.
"Oh you poor bastard. You love him?"
“Wait, wait, please, Dean. I have some news.”
“Did you have a destination in mind?” Castiel asks, attempting a non-sequitur once again.
A knock on the bathroom door shuts him up, and Castiel loses the resolve to change anything for another day.
Castiel asks the question with some trepidation. Dean’s humor is sometimes self-deprecating, but Castiel sees that it is a thin veneer for Dean’s insecurities. It’s in the way Dean talks about himself and even though they haven’t known each other long, Castiel is ready to defend Dean if he insists he’s not nice. Because Castiel knows people who aren’t nice. And Dean is nothing like them. Which is why Dean’s response comes as a surprise.
Castiel suppresses the urge to roll his eyes. Barely. “I suppose a better translation would be, ‘to contain,’ or ‘to lock away.’”
But, this is the one year Sam’s decided not to spend Thanksgiving with Jess’ family in California. Dean had really been looking forward to a full, proper dinner, and now it looks like he’s going to miss it. Even if it is only one of three jobs he currently shuffles between, he can’t afford to lose it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Sam says on the tail end of a sigh. “But we’re not giving up. We’re gonna keep looking. There’s gotta be a way.”
“The police should be here.”
Charlie narrows her eyes. “Liar.”
What passes for strategic planning involves gathering a few other hunters, Chuck, and Castiel in Dean’s room. Chuck is grilled on his meagre visions. Castiel offers his knowledge on Lucifer and the angels. He may not hear the chatter, but he applies previous knowledge to the current situation and makes educated guesses. He listens to Dean’s plan of action and offers insight if there is scope for improvement.
Castiel’s heart skips a beat, then hammers furiously. He swallows, but his mouth is dry all of a sudden. Dean feels the same way. But his happiness is short lived. He breathes out shakily. He’s pictured this moment so many times, and he’s still unprepared for it.
Dean had laughed off the rejection with a sad attempt at brevity–
“Just let me fix your hand, okay?” Dean reaches for the remote and Cas’ gaze flickers to it, then the small, ancient TV. Score. Dean bites back a smile as Cas steps in and backs the door shut.
Regret. That was a recurring one, lately. Anger. Fear. Despair.
“I can’t breathe,” Kevin complains from where he’s stuck with his head in Sam’s armpit. Sam laughs and moves his arm around to hike Kevin closer.
His mouth was soft and warm, and he tasted of the honey lavender ice cream they shared for dessert. He smiled into the kiss, so Castiel’s memory of it is a thrill despite the fact that he’d missed the cue when Dean had leaned in to kiss him goodnight.
And Castiel. He had brothers and sisters in Heaven and he turned on them all because of one man. He was God once and he did it all for one man. He had an army of angels once and he gave it all up for one man. He doesn’t simply love. He falls. He is the darkest seed. The abomination. He’s
The response comes a little slower.
It’s tedious working in Accounting, but Castiel prefers it to IT. Zachariah may be tough and a little unjust sometimes, but he’s a far cry from the guy who heads IT. Dick Roman easily takes the crown for the worst boss. Castiel has no idea how Charlie is able to work under someone like him. Unlikeable superiors notwithstanding, Castiel works hard because it’s part of the plan. Work hard, provide for Daphne, build a home and life with her. It’s been a while since Castiel was actually sure he wants this life, but he keeps at it because he doesn’t really know any other way to be.
And Castiel still feels giddy with happiness when he thinks of the kiss.
Castiel doesn’t relax. “But…?”
“She put your number in my phone,” Dean says, with a groan. He sounds annoyed, but he looks impressed. “She switched out Crowley’s number for yours so when I sent the text–”
Abruptly, the warmth and weight of Castiel above him lifts.
Bobby fixes him with a beady stare for a moment, but eventually he sighs. “Not for a few days. Knowing the Winchester temper tantrums, it’ll take a while before they figure out how to forgive each other. Takes a stupidly long time, but they always get there in the end.”
Castiel feels too weak to do more than push himself up onto his elbows. Sweat beads across his forehead. He perseveres and tries to swing his legs over the edge of the bed. “When are you leaving?”
A flurry of wings makes him start, but it’s only a raven taking off into the purple dawn.
“I’m sure you can fix it,” he says earnestly. “You’re one of the smartest people I know.”
It’s been a mild winter. They’re two weeks into December and there are still some patches of green in the lawns. Dean wraps his hand around the bottle of lube in his coat pocket and concentrates on putting one foot in front of the other.
Castiel finds that he rather enjoys the effect of amphetamines. It has a way of clarifying the white noise of human emotions and interactions. Once distilled, he can focus. He understands what’s needed of him. He can offer counsel when requested. He can stay out of the way when Dean doesn’t want to deal with him. He can indulge physical cravings by following through on the body’s requests with singular purpose. It goes: drugs, sleep, food, ablutions.
It had hurt to turn Dean down, especially since he knew Dean probably took it hard. Dean felt things so keenly, held it close to his chest, and almost never let on just how much he was affected. Not at first. In fact, Castiel was fairly sure he only knew that about Dean because texting provided enough of a buffer for Dean to be a little vulnerable. That, and Castiel was a stranger. He didn’t judge Dean.
“I should’ve told her sooner,” Castiel protests.
“No,” Cas grumbles, pushing his head under Dean’s arm to force Dean onto his back so Cas can nestle up against his side. “Don’t go.”
“Please,” Castiel says, sounding hoarse and strained even to his own ears. “Stay.”
“Lost contact with a town an hour north from here. Radio’s dead. Hit by Croats probably, so we’ll ride out, see if there’s any survivors and anything that can be salvaged.” Dean says all this with no preamble and he’s about halfway through before Castiel focuses on it properly.
“I don’t–“
Dean Winchester wouldn’t remember this, no. Not in his mind or in his flesh and bones. His soul, however, wherever it went, no matter how well-concealed it was, remembered. Every so often, it would pull when Dean prayed, as the magnet draws the needle north. Come back, it called in tandem with Dean’s voice, an atomic thrum that demanded a response. Come home.
“Dean, this is stupid. Whatever Sam said, I’m sure he didn’t mean–“
“Yes, thank you.”
“Dean,” Cas starts, tone warring between wary and warning, and Dean can see the confidence from this morning is gone.
Castiel looks away uncomfortably. They’re in the cafeteria, and people around them turn to stare. Charlie doesn’t appear to notice or care. She’s holding her hair in her hands, looking at him in shock.
It’s kind of awesome to see the hope and happiness dawn on Castiel’s face. “Really? You swear? I mean it, Dean. Don’t keep something that's bothering you about us, or me, from me. Please.”
It’s the tide of the blood, Castiel reasons with himself. All feeling is simply pain in varying degrees. Collecting his mind in a tenuous, shaking grip, Castiel beats a hasty retreat to the bathroom. For a few moments, he simply stands, hands braced against the sink, staring at his reflection. That’s when he realizes it’s the first time in forever since he’s looked at himself. He looks tired. Thinner. Deep wrinkles mar his forehead and the corners of his eyes. In the harsh light of the naked bulb, he looks pale and dirty and in need of a shave.
“You sure?” Charlie asks. “It’s pretty sexy. Even got
For a few moments, there’s silence as Dean wanders.  His touch is gentle and sure, and then it disappears.  “Well?” he asks, the ghost of a touch sliding along Castiel’s cock. “Are we doing this?”
Castiel sounds so serious, so perfectly earnest, it reminds Dean of the beginning. Of Castiel’s ill-fated trip to the drug store across the street. That first Thanksgiving. Castiel’s graduation. Every kiss and every promise in between.
Cas stands up, turns the TV off and circles around his bed to settle down with his head on the pillows. He lies flat on his back, staring at the ceiling, injured hand cradled against his chest. The minutes draw out long and if Dean stares, it’s inconsequential because Cas is somewhere inside that big brain of his, lost. It’s a long time, long enough for Dean’s mind to have quieted into the meditative moments of not-thought on the brink of sleep, when Cas shifts a little and speaks.
Sometimes it’s complicated to extract the meaning behind Dean’s metaphors. In this case, it’s a nuisance. Castiel narrows his eyes. “Yes.”
Castiel had never spoken to God. He had never seen Him. Now that Castiel tries to think of it – why did he believe? Was it because, even as an angel who couldn’t feel, Castiel could imagine a creature so great as God? He remembers begging for a sign into the silent ether. As Dean had with his father, Castiel calls, and the phone rings, but no one answers. Castiel leaves voicemails with no idea if anyone is ever going to hear them. So he sits here at the wheel, listening to the dial tone. If God would answer the phone this one time, Castiel would ask Him to spare one man. Only once. One more time. Call off the dogs. One last time.
“But nothing.”
The aftermath is a hellscape. Dean can't sleep. The Mark is torture, a seething serpent, but worse than that is the regret. He sees Cas' face everywhere, bloodied and bruised. He feels sick with guilt. Running away doesn't shake it off, because Cas has gotten inside, under his skin, into his heart. He's been saying it for sometime now. Love. It's terrifying. He glimpses himself in the mirror and sees a monster. Tormented by regret and guilt, but a monster all the same. He closes his eyes and sees Cas.
