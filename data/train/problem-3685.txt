Sam gave them a quick smile and bid them goodnight before he and Lauren disappeared through the door.
Dean slid his chair as close to the bed as he could get it and rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah. Maybe—maybe after all this… maybe
“Dean, I don’t want to be the reason you don’t go. If you truly don’t want to go, that’s fine, but don’t let me be the reason you push anyone away.”
It was his own eyes that gave him away. He broke eye contact, looking guiltily down at the floor, but Dean pushed his chin back up and wouldn’t let him look away.
Castiel’s face split into a wide smile as he reached for Dean’s collar, ignoring the pain of the movement as he pulled him into a kiss.
Dean shook his head with vigor, almost a reflexive response that was purely for himself. His voice was a little harsher than he intended, but he went with it anyway. “No way, Cas. You can’t take that bike out on these roads.”
been spending a lot of time with Charlie,” Dean responded as he stood, taking Castiel by the hand. “C’mon, we should go find a table. It’s getting pretty crowded and Jo’s neglecting her patrons.”
Dean and Cas were still in their own little world when Sam approached their booth. He wondered how he hadn’t seen it sooner. It wasn’t like he didn’t see that their relationship wasn’t like other friendships—a profound bond, as Cas had once called it. But now that his blinders were off, the gleam in his brother’s eyes, the smile on the angel’s face, the way they just seemed pulled to one another… well, he felt like his well-honed investigation skills had failed him on this one.
He pulled his hand out of hers and glared at her. He felt like his skin was on fire. He couldn’t speak. He was vaguely aware of the buzzing of his phone, so he pulled it out just to have something to focus on other than the blinding rage that was creeping down his spine while he tried to compose himself.
Dean nodded, allowing Castiel to pull him up from the floor and lead him into the kitchen. Jo and Charlie must have tended to the food during the confrontation because the pies sat cooling on the counter and the stove’s burners had been turned off. Dean sat on a barstool, leaning heavily on the breakfast counter in front of him. Castiel opened the freezer in search of ice but came away with a bag of frozen peas instead. Dean groaned in complaint as the bag was gingerly placed over the bridge of his nose, covering the top half of his face.
“First of all, you guys are adorable. And I don’t mean ‘aww, look at all the gay’-dorable, I mean like tooth-rotting sweet-sweet fanfiction adorable. I totally get it, though—the not being out thing is a big red flag most of the time. He’s a good guy for giving you a chance.”
“So, uh,” he began, speaking toward Castiel’s shoes, “you—you have my number. Feel free to—y'know—use it or whatever.”
He was stopped short by the arm of a police officer. “Sir, please, let the paramedics do their job.”
“Dean, I have some dough chilling in the refrigerator. There’s filling just over there,” Ellen gestured at a bowl of cherry filling waiting on an empty section of counter, “you boys go on and assemble those pies for me, hm?”
“Sam called him right before he called me. He was on a photo shoot about an hour away, but he’s on his way. I was still here, getting ready to head home. The ER isn’t my department, but the old folks tend to end up in ICU pretty often, so they’re used to me hanging around.” She took a deep breath before she continued. “Look, Castiel’s in pretty rough shape. At least a few broken bones, some road rash, probably a concussion. It’s a good thing he was wearing a helmet. I think he woke up for a minute or two, but he’s pretty banged up.”
He climbed the stairs to his hallway, passing Gabriel’s apartment door on the way to his own, only to find that the door to his own apartment was already unlocked. He rolled his eyes as he stepped inside, and just as he expected, he found his brother making an absurdly large sandwich in his kitchen. “What are you doing here, Gabriel?”
Charlie had planned on prodding at Dean about his possible bisexuality, but she definitely was not expecting him to come out to her in the first two minutes of their lunch date. Once the news sunk in and her brain was kicked back online, she had run to Dean’s side, there for him as she promised she’d always be.
“So, which one of you do I get to fuss at for being late tonight?” Ellen asked, pointing her fork at Sam and Dean.
Castiel could only watch the exchange, trying to piece it all together as Dean rubbed the back of his neck and ducked his head. “Yeah, well, she deserved everything she got. And thanks.”
“Dude, he put highlights in his hair,” Sam mused. He paused, considering how much he should divulge next. “His date with Cas, um, went
They left the diner hand in hand, opting to leave the Impala parked in the public lot and walking the two blocks over to The Roadhouse. It was a beautifully crisp, early December night. Some of the storefronts had twinkling lights strung around the windows and the town had hung large red bows on the all the lampposts. When a cold breeze blew, Dean squeezed Castiel’s hand and moved a little closer, seeking his warmth.
Some of the pain subsided. But in the back of his mind, he kept reminding himself that she was just a dog. She couldn’t fix the fact that everyone around him was happy, that they would go on and live normal lives, and he… he would always wonder what could have been. The pain would never really go away.
He squeezed Cas’s hand. Cas watched as Dean’s fingers slipped between his own, intertwining. Meanwhile, Dean’s mind was going a mile a minute, working up his courage.
“You’re not out,” he stated flatly. The deflated look on his face lit a fire somewhere in Dean who bravely took Castiel’s hand. The man eyed their entwined fingers before locking blue eyes to green once more.
“I live— “Castiel bent his head down a little, pointing through the window beside them to a three-story building about a block down the street, “—right there. I usually pass through here on my way to the hospital.”
“Oh, when Dean told me what happened, my heart just broke!” Donna trilled, drawing their attention again. “And while Dean was stuck here with that
“Look,” Sam pointed past Dean. Through the window was the parking lot of the community center. There were a handful of cars scattered through the parking lot, and in a spot near the edge of the lot, a familiar pickup truck.
It was Castiel’s turn to roll his eyes. “Please at least stay away from the people I work with directly. I like my job and would prefer to keep it.”
Castiel’s hope plummeted, but Dean continued, “Not yet. But soon. In fact,” Dean raised his head with renewed confidence, “I’m
About three years ago, just before Dean and Lisa started dating, the Roadhouse had hired a new chef—a sweet, burly man with a Cajun accent. When Jo introduced Benny to Sam, Dean, and Charlie, Dean had reacted strangely out of character. Charlie hadn’t understood at the time; Benny had been more than friendly but Dean behaved with Benny just as she was seeing him behaving now with Castiel—shy, nervous, and a little flustered. So, she didn't understand when Dean said he didn't like the guy and began avoiding him. She had suspected his attitude might have stemmed from a crush, but a week later Dean and Lisa were dating and Dean’s negative attitude toward Benny dissipated. Charlie attempted to gently approach the subject with Dean, but he was quick to evade that conversation. And though she had been proudly open as a lesbian since her teens, she still knew better than to push a person before they were ready. It hadn't come as a surprise, however, that Dean and Lisa’s relationship struggled.
“What? What the hell do you want?” His tone was angry, but John ignored it because finally, Dean turned around.
go back to my place,” Dean blurted with a slight shrug. Castiel just stared for a moment and Dean worried that he had overstepped. “I mean, if you want to, y’know, hang out for a while.”
“You know, burning down your kitchen is still a definite possibility,” Castiel threatened, though his words were laced with humor.
“Well, you and Cas obviously enjoy spending time together, so we want to get to know him better, too… and Charlie has declared it game night—” Sam smirked as Dean groaned, but even though he was looking at the ground, Sam could see his brother’s smile. “—and you’re hosting.”
? It’s the best goddamn thing to ever happen to me. You wanna know why? Because I love him more than I
“Yeah,” Dean smiled. “Breakfast. And, uh, maybe we can check out that Rose Festival before we head out.” He looked up tentatively, waiting for Castiel’s reaction.
. A pained groan came from the couch and Charlie’s head popped out from beneath the blanket, red hair everywhere.
When the waitress, a cute and curvy brunette in a short skirt that Dean would have definitely pursued just a few years ago, fluttered her lashes at him, Sam and Jess both had to duck behind their menus as Dean promptly ignored her blatant flirting to lean over toward Cas and say with a big smile, “Hey, they have brownie à la mode. Want to share? It’ll be like our first date all over again.”
“You know, I think I’m gonna stick around and help Eileen out on this one,” he said suppressing a smile. “You guys can go on ahead. We’ll meet you back at the bunker in a few days.”
Dean was frozen to the floor. All the blood had apparently abandoned his legs and gone straight to his crotch. It was completely unfair that Castiel should be able to completely destroy him with one little sentence, but hey, he wasn’t complaining either.
He considered ignoring the call, but with everything going on with Dean and Castiel, he ultimately slid his thumb over the screen and answered.
The world had changed so much, so fast. Jack, stronger than Chuck ever was, had brought everyone back—Eileen, Bobby, Jody, Donna, Charlie—even the dog. Sam hadn’t left Eileen’s side since they reunited, and the dog hadn’t left Dean’s.
Dean could tell that the confrontation with John was weighing on Bobby. Having noticed Dean watching the man, Castiel bumped his knee with his own, giving him a meaningful look. The corner of Dean’s mouth tipped up just a bit as he wondered how Castiel did that—how he could just tell Dean what he was thinking with those stunning blue eyes. He nodded, giving Castiel’s knee a squeeze as he stood to follow Bobby who’d gone into the kitchen for a fresh beer.
“What’s up, bitches?!” The cheery redhead grinned as she flung herself into the booth beside Sam, who instantly wrapped a long arm around her in greeting.
“Mmh, you haven’t met Dad yet, though. A little shopping to do first, huh? That why you didn’t join us for breakfast?” His knowing smirk was enough to make Dean drop his head and scrub a hand over his face.
Donna had learned their usual breakfast order and she grinned each time she greeted Dean, reminding him to tell Mr. Novak she said hello, which he always did, though there were some mornings in which Dean preferred to cook their breakfast. The noises Castiel made when he devoured Dean’s vanilla pancakes were well worth the effort and had nearly made them both late for work that particular morning.
It seemed to take a moment for Castiel to regain his ability to speak. “I—I was coming to see if you’d had breakfast yet.”
Dean reached over to squeeze Castiel’s hand. “Shit, I’m sorry, Cas. I didn’t even think about it. I’ll try and see if I can get my hands on it. Maybe—maybe there’s something I can do, y’know? We’ll figure it out.”
The next morning, Dean dragged himself out of bed and straight into the shower. He pulled on his favorite Led Zeppelin shirt, layered it under a flannel, and managed to find a pair of jeans not covered in grease stains. He wandered to the kitchen in socked feet until he found himself staring into his mostly empty refrigerator. Deciding that he’d have to venture out if he wanted breakfast, he slipped on his work boots and headed out the door.
“Sam, I know—I know this isn’t what you wanted.” Sam raised his brows and laughed at the gross understatement.
When Dean and Cas finally made it to the kitchen in the morning, Sam was already there, bent over a newspaper and nursing a mug of coffee. They shared a glance before they began moving around the kitchen, Cas pouring two mugs of coffee while Dean pulled a box of cereal and a pair of bowls from a shelf.
There was a flicker of a suspicious smile on Dean’s face that Castiel caught when he glanced over. A few minutes later, they pulled into John’s driveway. Sam’s car and Bobby’s truck were already parked. John must have called them over as well, Castiel figured.
Dean turned to face him, green eyes locked on blue. “Yeah, I—I just—look, before we go in there, I just wanted to—” Dean closed his eyes tightly, trying to gather his thought and Castiel’s head dropped sadly.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at himself. What was he hiding from? He hadn’t woken up with some stranger… This was
attractive,” Castiel finally said, eyes still squinted in her direction. “But the man she’s talking to has much more attractive qualities.”
At this, Castiel laughed, “I feel like you’d have to know Gabriel to understand how truly terrifying it really is.”
Charlie pointed up to the windows, warmly lit against the dreary evening. “Lights are on. And Sam said he’d be here.”
That was when Castiel noticed a thin, black lanyard draped around the bee’s head. At the bottom was a silver pendant, engraved with an angel. He turned the pendant over and ran a finger over the words there, reading aloud. “
“Dean,” Castiel said, his voice low and comforting, “you’re strong. You’re brave. You have the support of your friends and family. And no matter what happens, you have me.”
“So, what’s the plan?” Dean asked through a mouthful of food, waving the remainder of the pancake around with one hand while he poured syrup over the plates with the other.
Dean chuckled, pocketing his phone again with pink cheeks and a hard-to-hide smile. “Awesome. Thanks.”
Charlie wasn’t sure when Jo had moved to her side, but their hands were clasped tightly together as they listened and watched. Dean and Castiel leaned against the kitchen counters, shoulder to shoulder, leaning into one another as Sam sunk onto one of the round stools, elbows propped on the stainless-steel top and his fingers shoved into his hair.
They sat in silence for a while in which Sam stared blankly at the dashboard, thinking about the kind of life he'd once wanted.
“Gabriel said he was cute,” Anna said with an approving grin once Dean was gone. She settled into the now vacant chair beside the bed.
“C’mon,” she said. “Let’s see if we can salvage this dinner. You go tend to your—did I hear Dean call you his boyfriend?”
“Oh, we did,” Gabriel replied with a wiggle of his brow in Meg’s direction, “and then we got fireworks.” He grinned and except for Dean’s scowl and Meg’s rolling eyes, everyone laughed.
He wandered down the hallway, listening for trouble. When he didn't find any, he knocked twice on Dean's door before opening it.
She and Sam had also developed a close friendship, bonding over their mutual love of tech gadgets, gossip, and college courses they’d shared. She, like Dean, wanted the very best for Sam and had gotten closer than anyone to discussing Jess and Stanford with him.
Dean chuckled fondly and kissed the back of his head. “I’m not going anywhere, sunshine. I’m all yours today.”
Dean woke up early on Sunday. For the rest of the hunters, Sundays were for sleeping in, for recharging after a week of hunts, but Sundays were Dean’s favorite day of the week, and he didn’t want to waste time lazing around in bed. Sunday mornings were his time to give his favorite machine all the attention she deserved.
The Winchesters thought of Jo like family, along with her mother, owner of The Roadhouse, Ellen. Dean couldn’t remember exactly when Ellen had first appeared at their Uncle Bobby’s side, but he’d been a young teen. It seemed like she was an instant fit and she’d been around ever since. She and Jo were two of a kind, sweet but tough, and afraid of nothing.
He stood from his chair, giving Castiel a tentative smile, just enough of an upward twitch to show that he was okay. When he reached the man, he wrapped his arms around his neck and melted into him as strong arms enveloped him. In that moment, he felt safe again.
In a much better mood, he changed into a clean shirt and waved goodbye to the guys. He climbed into the Impala and steered it out of the parking lot. It didn’t matter what Lisa wanted, because at the end of the day he’d be sharing pie with Castiel Novak.
last week,” she narrowed her eyes dangerously at the table nearest the door while Dean’s stare grew wide again, and she shifted a little under the look, “but when I saw how angry you were when you left, well…” She let the sentence drift off while she handed over their cups and a couple of muffins. “On the house.”
He wasn’t sure if his father’s disappointment was directed at his decision about school or about the truck, but John shook his head as he climbed the porch steps and made his way inside the house. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, unclenching his fists where his nails had dug into the heel of his hands.
The warmth of their kiss reflected the spring sky, and Dean felt all of the pieces of his life fall into place. It felt a little like restoring a car—or a ’77 Harley. He had been put back together piece by piece, handled with care, restored and revived as the old parts of his life and the new came together. And finally, he was whole again. Different, but better.
, those hands. There were so many sensations, his body tingled from his head to his toes. Gripping the headboard with one hand, he let the other drop down to stroke himself, keeping with Castiel’s tempered pace.
“Man, it’s good to have you back,” Dean said on an exhale. “You, uh—you’re lookin’ pretty rough there, buddy.”
As the night came to a close, Sam slipped into the backseat of the Impala, insisting that Castiel take the passenger seat up front. He felt the weight of tension slipping back over his shoulders as he wondered whether his father would be at his house. Probably not. But when, then, would he return? He wondered if he ever would. They were halfway home before Dean’s voice pulled Sam out of the whirlpool of his own thoughts.
“Because they’re not frozen cardboard served by a clown?” He crossed his arm and raised his chin in pride.
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s back and guided him back inside, leading him to the couch. He pulled the blanket over the both of them and they sat quietly wrapped up in one another’s arms for a long while.  It was Castiel that finally broke the silence.
Together they unloaded the groceries and carried them up the staircase. Dean unlocked and kicked open the door and they both dropped the bags onto the large stainless-steel table that served as a kitchen island. Now unburdened, Cas perched on one of the round stools and took a moment to survey the place. Dean had apparently done the same as he was now quickly scooping up a trail of clothing that led from the front door and down a small hallway just off the kitchen.
Charlie hopped up and pulled Dean and Cas into a hug. “You guys are gonna be fine. Just maybe don’t start making out at the dinner table and taking your clothes off in the kitchen, hm?” She grinned before she moved over to hug Sam tightly too. “And you… we’re gonna have a talk soon.”
,” he said, retrieving his shirt from the angel’s hands. “Just don’t—don’t mention it to Sammy. Or anyone. Okay?”
. He’d hoped for a conversation, grasping for some kind of connection, some string that he could hold onto before they were gone forever, but instead, everything he’d done wrong, every mistake,
They considered their options. Castiel’s place was a worse option since he lived in a third-floor walk-up. He wasn’t supposed to use the crutches yet because of his mending ribs. And he desperately just wanted to be
Dean’s unfortunate reaction was to pull away quickly, leaving Cas looking confused and a little hurt.
“Or I can take you,” John said hopefully. “It’s on my way home. I, uh, think you left Castiel’s pie in my truck, too.”
When the Impala’s headlights illuminated the interior of the car, Sam sat up and checked the time. It was well after midnight, which meant that he and Jess had been on the phone for over two and a half hours.
He entered the lobby and climbed the stairs to the third floor, following the directions that Castiel had given to find Apartment 3C. But before he could reach Castiel’s front door, he was stopped short. Gabriel was leaning against the doorframe of Apartment 3B with his arms folded across his chest, one of his cameras in hand and wearing a mischievous smile.
“Yeah, Sammy, thanks. For, uh, caring enough to—to get in touch with Ruby.” He knew his brother would understand what he was really trying to say:
Sam, apparently, didn’t believe them either. “I dunno, Dean. This’ll be your first ‘out’-in-public date, right? I mean, it’s kind of a big deal.”
“Very good, let’s turn around and go back to the other end,” he praised, helping Jack change directions between the rails. “And yes, that’s exactly what happened. The night wasn’t a total waste, though.” He couldn’t hide the smile that crept onto his lips. “I made some new friends.”
Castiel wrapped his arm around Jess’s shoulders in solidarity and she rested her head on him. He agreed; the Winchester brothers did seem to live their lives weighed down by their father. However, after his own confrontation with John, there was the tiniest glimmer of hope in his heart—hope that his future with Dean would be one filled with love and happiness. He allowed himself a moment to imagine what that would be like.
Tears welled in Dean’s eyes and he wiped them away roughly. Miracle jumped off her chair and moved to Dean’s side, nuzzling at his hand. He held his breath to hold back a sob as he scratched her head.
“I know, okay? I know how bad I’ve screwed up. I know I don’t—I don’t deserve to even be here talking with you boys right now. Trust me, I’ve been doing some soul searching. And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry. I’ll be sorry for the rest of my life. I’ve, uh, apologized to Bobby and Ellen. Let them give me the earful I deserved. Hell, it took me three days to get Bobby to even answer the door. And if you boys never forgive me, I wouldn’t blame you.”
Sam stuck his head into the hallway just in time to see the dripping pair pass him, heading toward Dean’s room. He rolled his eyes and smiled as he returned and stretched out on the sofa. When Jack tilted his head in question, Sam grinned.
He was starting to get worried, so he crossed the hall to knock on Castiel's door. He knocked twice again, but still no answer. He opened the door a crack and his jaw fell.
With a bark of laughter, Dean leaned over the bed to kiss Castiel a little less gently than he would have a few minutes before.
Dean watched the smile spread across Castiel’s face, and he stood to let Anna take his place. When she sat, Castiel hugged her tightly.
He turned to face Castiel who was licking the crumbs from his lips. Dean couldn’t pinpoint what it was about the man that called to him, but just watching him standing here so casually in Dean’s own kitchen made his heart skip a beat. He positioned himself in front of him, placing a hand on each side, pinning him to the counter.
“Ruby. Sammy. So, uh, where’s the rest of this group thing?” Dean asked, just as Jo reached the end of their table with a bucket of ice that held six beers.
They exchanged goodbyes and set an appointment for the following week before Castiel headed into his office. He entered his notes about their session, cleared his desk, and checked his phone for the time. In fifteen minutes, Dean would be in the cafeteria to meet him for lunch, so he collected his phone, cash, and keys and headed downstairs.
Dean choked on his beer. “That—That’s, uh, not exactly what I expected,” he coughed, “but, uh, go on.”
Castiel dragged himself out of the bed as Dean grabbed a couple pairs of boxers and sweatpants from his dresser. Thankfully Dean had a private bathroom, because now that they were coming down from their lustful high, they remembered the three people beyond the bedroom door.
“What are we cooking today?” Cas asked, following right behind Dean and rolling up the sleeves of the blue flannel that had likely once been Sam’s.
But this time, Sam wouldn’t be there when he came home and passed out in the recliner because he couldn’t make it to his bed. Dean wouldn’t be there to clean up his messes, the way he’d had to his entire life. And it was that feeling of regret—not that his boys wouldn’t be there anymore, but that they’d been subjected to John and his shitty lifestyle for all these years in the first place—that steeled his resolve. He would change. There was no other option. Those boys deserved so much better. Everything they’d suffered was his fault.
“I stopped to make sure, to check on him. They said he had some injuries, but he was unconscious. They took him to the hospital. Dean, I tried calling you—”
First things first, he headed over to the old radio that sat on a shelf near the door. Unfortunately, a mostly-underground, cement bunker wasn’t the best place to pick up radio stations, so the choices were limited. He skipped the sports-radio and a static-plagued country station, settling on the only remaining clear station which was currently playing a Justin Timberlake song that Dean secretly didn’t hate.
Life has been hectic, as it gets sometimes, but things are calming down, so I've finally had the chance to give this baby some attention. <3
“I’m good, Charlie. For now, at least. Once I work out all my shit, I’ll deal with him, but for now I’m good. But Dean… I don’t know. I don’t know if he’s ready to deal with this yet.”
Dean bit his lip before giving a one-armed shrug and ducking his head a bit. “I figure Cas doesn’t have the bike anymore and we’ll be living together, so…” He trailed off, turning his eyes back to Castiel. “Makes sense.”
He jerked his head back up a little too fast, but the sight of Dean sauntering into the room and dropping his bag on the floor before sliding a pastry box onto a rolling table made him forget his pain. He smiled into Dean’s lips as he leaned over the bed rail to carefully kiss him. When he stepped back and settled into the chair beside the bed, Cas let out a sigh.
“Mr. Novak’s a regular like you!” Donna chirped, answering for Castiel. “Dunno how you boys haven’t bumped into one another before.” Castiel shrugged, as Donna wandered off.
When they rolled to a stop in the same parking lot that they’d stopped in the first time they’d been here together, Castiel killed the engine and they pulled off their helmets. This time, however, Castiel led Dean toward a short pier that overlooked the lake. Castiel leaned forward, resting his elbows on the railing as he took in the view. The sun was setting, and the sky was a soft pinkish orange. But Dean’s focus wasn’t on the sky.
Dean roughly rubbed a hand over the back of his own neck, “Yeah, I think so… but I—I, uh…,” he stammered. “She doesn’t know that I—uh, no one, actually, does yet—I haven’t—,” he looked to Castiel, pleading for understanding.
better with you.” His voice shook, but he was smiling. “Your shitty date with Meg is the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you, Cas.”
Dean scrubbed a hand down his face and leaned forward, elbows on his knees and head hanging. “What the hell do I tell my dad?”
He decided to delay the inevitable by backtracking through the cafeteria entrance door to duck into the gift shop next door. Christmas was just a few days away, after all, and all of Dean’s original intentions of doing some shopping this weekend had gone out of the window the moment his father had tracked him down in his driveway yesterday.
“Um, things are… really good, actually,” she said, almost sheepishly, a blush creeping into her cheeks. “Charlie’s great.
“Well, well, well. Here to take my baby brother out on your first date, huh? Don’t worry, I’ll spare you the whole big brother lecture.” He snapped a picture of Dean, momentarily blinding him with the flash.
that if you’d been home last night. You were with your pretty boy again.” It wasn’t a question. He wiggled his eyebrows but didn’t wait for a response. “Anyway, I’m pretty sure she did it on purpose. She wanted to do this thing with her blood pressure cuff and a—”
Gabriel waved his brother’s exasperation off. “So, tonight’s the night with Dean-o, right? Should I wear my noise-cancelling headphones?”
They both stopped walking and Dean had seemingly lost the ability to speak. He watched as Cas stuck his fingers into his hair in frustration, making it stand even more than it usually did.
“It was John’s idea,” Gabriel explained. “Sam called me and we had to work through the red tape to get the bike back without you finding out.”
Dean, now out of the Impala and on his way to the stairs, knocked on the driver’s side window giving Sam a confused look. Sam held up and pointed to his phone, to which Dean gave a one shouldered shrug and turned to head inside.
Castiel laughed, dropping the towel on the floor before slipping between the sheets. Dean wrapped him up in his arms, nuzzling his nose into Castiel’s hair.
Dean was quiet for a moment. He cast a thoughtful look in Sam’s direction and nodded. “Alright, Sammy. New car. You deserve it.”
Dean rested his head on Castiel’s chest, listening to his heart beat. It was strong and steady, calming him as Castiel’s fingers lazily combed through his hair. He wished he could stay here forever, but he knew he couldn’t stay tonight. Sam would be waiting up for him even though he said he wouldn’t.
After about an hour, Gabriel and Meg disappeared. Charlie and Jo were giggling while Anna, who had been staying at Castiel’s apartment, described the horrors of sharing a wall with her brother again for the first time since their childhood.
When he pulled into the driveway, the hood of the old truck was already up. Dean pulled the Impala in behind Sam’s Charger and climbed out, toolbox in hand just as Sam walked out the front door of the house with the new alternator for the truck.
Sam could feel the tension rolling off of his brother in waves—the need to talk, but his own stubbornness keeping him from saying so.
They didn’t get many nights like this. Usually, their evenings consisted of being elbow deep in either blood or books. But thanks to a wild summer storm, they had decided to take the night off tonight and they were spending it holed up in Dean’s Man Cave catching up on movies. Jack claimed the lone chair while Sam and Cas had each taken a corner of the sofa, leaving Dean a snug space between them that he happily plopped down into.
Castiel shrugged. “I can be dangerous.” He pulled Dean hard against him by his belt loops and pressed a hard kiss to his lips. Caught slightly off-guard, Dean swayed on the spot, gasping to catch his breath, though not making any effort to stop their sudden make-out session. Heated kisses gradually made way to softer, sweeter ones and Castiel’s hands wandered over Dean’s shoulders, cupping his face and lacing through his hair. When they finally broke apart, they stood forehead to forehead, Dean’s stare locked on Castiel while his thumbs traced the curve of his neck.
Castiel hid his smile behind his own helmet before starting the engine. It had been a few weeks since the last time he’d ridden, but the noise and the vibration were familiar and welcoming. He eased into motion and Dean’s hands gripped tightly at his sides. As they carefully pulled onto the road, Castiel guided the bike toward his favorite two-lane highway with Dean snug against his back.
Dean felt Castiel’s eyes watching him and it was surprisingly easy to take his own eyes away from the fireworks to return that stare.
“And Dean… Dean, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I took your childhood away from you. You deserved to grieve and I—I took that from you too. From both of you. Dean, I’m sorry I wasn’t supportive of—of you. I’m… I’m glad you’ve found your happiness. Let him save you like your mother saved me.” He laughed that sad laugh again. “For what it’s worth, I like him. He gave me an earful too. Made me think of Mary, actually.”
That caught the attention of both Sam and Jess, and Castiel’s faced dropped ever so slightly. Castiel and Lisa hadn’t exactly gotten off on the right foot when they’d met at the Christmas party, Dean remembered.
His heart ached when he looked at the stupid mutt, but he was happy to see her, nonetheless. Everyone was gone. Cas was gone. And yet, this dog was here. It wasn’t fair, but it meant something. It meant that maybe, just maybe there was hope—
“I suppose I do have a ‘type,’” Castiel said, more to himself than Dean, though Dean’s stomach was doing somersaults for some reason.
Castiel turned toward the bar, waving at Jo to get her attention and pointing at Meg’s eggnog and then himself. She seemed to understand, giving him a thumbs up.
“Hey, uh, Sammy,” Dean said, looking back up into the rearview, “why don’t you come stay at my place for a few days? We can stop and get some of your stuff and your car and you can come crash on my couch for a couple nights.”
He had also taken to casually dating girls that were about as different from Jess as he could find and outright refused to talk about Stanford.
Sam’s jaw clenched and released as he set his eyes on the glass bottle in his hand. Dean hated seeing him this way.
Dean shook his head. “They’ll love you.” A tiny spark of panic widened his eyes before his voice shifted back to its usual playful cockiness. “I mean—of course they’ll like you. You’re awesome, Cas.” He slipped his hands into the back pockets of Castiel’s jeans and leaned back to look him in the eye. “Now I, uh, don’t know how they’ll feel about
He gave Dean his best sad puppy eyes, knowing that his brother really had no excuse to turn down the offer anyway.
From what he could tell, the Novaks seemed surprisingly close-knit. He knew that things had been tough for their family after the loss of Castiel’s mother, and yet the family had managed to live a normal, functional life. Dean wasn’t really sure how to process that. He felt like he’d grown up in a different world from them. Yeah, he had his own motley crew of a family, but it hadn’t exactly been an apple-pie kinda life growing up.
Dean chuckled, “Got that too, but not what I meant.” He pulled a small plastic bag from his pocket and handed it over. Castiel laughed as he pulled a new toothbrush from the bag.
An hour later, Dean held on tight as the Harley cruised along the highway between the vast fields that were now filled with blooming wildflowers. When the road curved to encircle the lake, it was no longer damp and gray; instead, the sunlight shimmered over the water while the trees stood thick and green around it.
“The first time I saw him, I was sitting right here—right on this bench. And by the end of the night, he had worked up the courage to exchange numbers with me. That doesn’t sound like much but think about it. Think about the way
They both glanced over to Dean and Castiel, playfully bickering about something. It was hard not to smile at them. Sam watched his older brother’s face, glowing with happiness—a sharp contrast to the somber expression he’d worn just a few minutes ago.
“Let’s go to the Roadhouse! And you should call Dean; I’ve been dying to meet Castiel. We should celebrate. C’monnn…” She gave Sam perfect puppy eyes, and Sam threw his head back and laughed, realizing that he must have picked up the habit from her.
After a few more minutes of being lost in his thoughts, Dean pushed away his almost empty beer bottle.
When they broke apart, Dean hummed, his heart filled with content. Castiel leaned in again, placing a single peck on the lobe of Dean’s ear, sending shivers down his spine. But that was nothing compared to the gruff whisper that made Dean thankful they’d have their motel room to themselves that night: “Just my type.”
Sam considered this for a moment before passing Dean the take-out menu. “That’s cool. He seems like a good guy.”
“Fine, fine! I’m going! I have my own date to get ready for anyway.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. “The hot nurse that gave me her number. Totally wants me. You know, on second thoughts, maybe you boys might wanna go back to
“So, what do you want?” Dean finally asked flatly. Sam glanced at his brother before sitting up straight and turning his attention back to his father.
Sam was the first to wake the next morning. He was sprawled out over the armchair, his long legs dangling off one side and his back aching. He scrubbed a hand over his face before pulling himself upright. Charlie and Jo were tangled together on the couch, huddled under a blanket.
Dean’s brows were pinched in a hard, straight line as he let the information sink in. Surely, hearing that Ellen and Bobby were helping their father gave the news a little more merit. They remained quiet until Sam pulled the Charger into the driveway and killed the engine.
After an hour or so of hiding out, Dean found Sam and Cas in the library. Sam had his laptop open on one of the tables while Cas sat reading in one of the plush armchairs. Both glanced his way when he entered the room, and Dean braced himself.
He turned his hand, intertwining their fingers. Dean’s eyes softened and Castiel smiled. Everything was green.
“Hey. Ready to get this show on the road?” Dean asked, though he hadn’t quite seemed to shake last night’s party off yet. Castiel stood silently at Dean’s side, apparently lost in a sleepy daze.
This was going to be harder than Sam had expected it to be, and he hadn’t expected it to be a walk in the park in the first place.
“No, definitely not,” he admitted, leaning back into the soft leather of the Impala’s seat. “But you—you're all... bright and shiny.”
Castiel slipped his arms through Dean’s to wrap them around his back and rest his head on Dean’s chest. “Your uncle… Ellen... Your
Dean sat up to face him. They locked eyes and he leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together. “Cas,” he breathed, “I—I don’t really know where this is going, but, uh… I just—I don’t want to stop yet. I mean, it’s cool if you don’t want to—”
Castiel moved slowly and deliberately behind him, and Dean was suddenly grateful for the calm pace. He felt at ease in his arms, knowing that Castiel would be careful with him, would never do anything to hurt him, and that feeling filled his chest with warmth. There had been an initial burn when Castiel’s cock had filled him, but the man’s patience and praise soothed him, helping him relax until the pain quickly subsided into a pleasure, growing with each thrust.
Bobby cut him off, “To what? Give the boy some good advice?” The air in the room grew heavy with tension.
Castiel reached over and squeezed Dean’s hand. Dean took the opportunity to thread their fingers together. “Doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’ll be worth it.”
“Dean... I, uh, see Sammy’s told you about my little project. I hope—I hope it’s okay.” There was a question in the way he said it that made Dean nod. It was a small movement, but Sam could tell that there was great appreciation in it.
Bobby opened the refrigerator as Dean entered the kitchen. Noticing his arrival, Bobby pulled two bottles from the shelf, opening both and passing one over. Taking a deep swig of his own, Bobby leaned back against the kitchen counter. “Your brother was right, you know.”
John’s returns always weighed heavily on the brothers, but this time felt different. Sam had finally made up his mind and decided to take back his life, but why did it feel like he had to betray his father to do it? And Dean—Dean had just stepped onto a brave new path. He didn’t want to see his brother crawl back into the shell he’d been living in for the last two years now that he’d finally found himself. It was all new, but it was already clear to Sam that Cas was good for Dean. Cas made him happy.
Charlie bit her cheek and pulled a beer from the ice bucket. “I’ve already met Castiel here. How did you two meet?” she asked, wiggling her fingers at Meg and Castiel. Meg perked up, clearly keen to flaunt her attachment to her handsome date.
Dean was halfway through the second sandwich by the time John finished cleaning up. He turned to lean against the counter as he watched Dean eat.
He watched until the motorcycle disappeared around a corner, before coming back to his senses. He smiled as he finally unlocked his phone and checked his message.
, Castiel? Not ‘hi’? Not ‘hello’? Not even a ‘hey, asshole’? I’m really starting to feel unwelcome.”
Once Sam was inside the house, Dean drove to the edge of the neighborhood, pulling into the semi-secluded driveway of his own home. The property was set back from the road, partially surrounded by tall trees. The building was old, once a small industrial garage with beautiful red bricks and paneled windows, centered on a wide piece of property with trees all around. Dean had gotten a great deal on the place due to its condition, but after much hard work, the upper level had been renovated into loft apartment and the garage below had become a home for Baby and a space for the side-jobs that had replaced most Dean’s social life for the last year.
He pulled out his phone as Dean sat down, realizing that Dean, too, was staring at his own phone with an interesting smile.
Dean and Cas turned toward the kitchen, Dean taking a deep breath before raising his eyebrows at Castiel. “Here goes nothing.”
Unfortunately, he’d also spent a large portion of the evening avoiding unwanted advances from his other side. Meg’s hand kept finding its way onto Castiel's thigh and she’d wiggled her way under his arm so that it draped behind her to rest on her lower back. As the night went on he knew that he needed to confess his disinterest before this went any further, however he was not looking forward to that conversation. He had a feeling that Meg wasn’t the type to take no for an answer without a fight.
Castiel had taken to rolling around the place in the loaner wheelchair that Meg and Gabriel had brought over. Dean wondered just how
“She set your bed on fire?” Castiel interrupted, lifting his head to look at his brother. Gabriel waved a dismissive hand.
“I like any night that ends with you in my bed,” Dean answered, his fingers now combing through the hair on the back of Castiel’s head.
He needed to think, but he just couldn’t. His mind was somehow spinning out of control and completely blank all at once. His body ached with tension. He slouched onto the plush leather couch that he loved, pulling a blanket over his face. He could feel his phone vibrating in his pocket, surely Sam calling to check on him, but he ignored it. He just needed to
“So, you’re the guy in the sweet black Impala,” Gabriel said. Castiel watched as Dean visibly relaxed and gestured toward his brother.
Castiel made a complaining noise, not yet willing to let go. He peered at Dean through one open eye. “Your bed is better than mine.”
“I might’ve,” Castiel said innocently, following closely behind Jack as he took five forward steps. “Excellent, Jack! You’ve been practicing.”
before rubbing at his eyes with his free hand. After the emotional day he’d had so far, he was mentally exhausted, and the idea of being in the car with Sam for the 30-minute drive to Bobby’s house brought an instant pang of tension across his neck and shoulders. He knew his brother would hold no judgement, would be just as accepting as Charlie had been, but Dean couldn’t figure out why it just seemed harder to tell him.
Sam’s smirk was enough to say that he knew exactly what was going through Dean’s head, and that only irked the older brother even more. He turned his back on the car and pulled out his phone.
“I—I’m gonna…” Dean pointed at the bathroom, quickly grabbed his toothbrush, and hurried into the bathroom to hide for the second time since they’d arrived at this damned dollhouse motel. He turned on the tap and considered drowning himself in the sink, but settled on splashing the cold water on his face before brushing his teeth. He still had the toothbrush in his mouth when he looked up to his reflection with a panicked realization.
Dean felt lightheaded and his heart had probably stopped beating for an unhealthy amount of time now. He was still frozen to the spot, letting Castiel’s confession wash over him. He expected himself to go into a panic or to at least freak out in some kind of way, but he didn’t. Instead, he felt unusually calm. Relieved, even.
“You’re cut off, John,” Rufus said gruffly, though it was the kind of gruffness that, for Rufus, meant he cared. “Now get the hell outta my bar.”
“I don’t think anyone really gets it.” Sam chimed in when he returned to pass out the beer. He gave Dean a raised brow and a knowing look, nodding at how close he and Cas were sitting. “Leave some room for Jesus, huh guys?” he teased.
Cas smiled as he leaned into Dean’s touch, turning slightly to kiss the palm of Dean’s hand before pulling him back down onto his chest. Dean settled in, letting the angel wrap him peacefully in his warm arms where he belonged. Just before he drifted off to sleep, he whispered again. “Hey, Cas?”
Marla batted a hand toward him with a blush. “We do still have one room available.” She slid her ledger toward Dean to sign while he passed her a credit card. “I’m sure you two will be nice and cozy. Maybe you can even pass through the festival on your way out of town tomorrow.”
“Alright, Cas, you do the driving,” Dean said, pushing a shopping cart in his direction. Castiel accepted it willingly, leaning forward on his elbows as he followed Dean through the aisles. “I’m thinkin’ burgers,” Dean said, looking around the produce section. “Ever made your own burgers?”
“I dunno. But I’m gonna get through this one way or another,” he answered, flexing his hands nervously.
The first time he’d realized that he felt attracted to a man, he had panicked, diving headlong into his first and only long-term relationship with the first woman he met. Things were going well with Lisa and her young son Ben at first but the chemistry just wasn’t there, and after almost 2 years, Lisa finally called it quits.
Dean turned his head slowly to face his boyfriend with narrowed eyes. ‘Not helping,” he said before pecking a kiss on his lips. “But true.”
I'm so happy to *finally* be able to call this complete! Thank you all so much for all the kudos and comments! This story is my Baby and it's bittersweet to finally come to the end, so thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed all the fluff and feels!
“Glad to know how desperate you were to see me,” Dean said with a wink. He knew he was flirting, but it came so naturally that he didn’t fight it. For the first time, he wasn’t trying to hide his attraction and it felt… easy.
“Dean?” There was a swirl of doubt building in Castiel—a worry that Dean may be having second thoughts about the two of them entering the Roadhouse together. The Roadhouse—a place where Dean and the people he cares most about gather. Maybe this was too much. “Is everything okay?”
Suddenly, Jo and Charlie had Dean wrapped up in hugs, and Sam joined in, wrapping his long arms around them all, while Ellen watched and smiled. Even Bobby cracked a momentary smirk before breaking up the scene. (“
The last text pulled a laugh from Dean as he recalled an unusually upbeat man they’d encountered on their second lunch date that had used a sock puppet to talk to a stern looking doctor. Dean had joked that he’d been completely right in saying that lunch at the hospital was fun.
“Fine. But only because it matches my eyes,” Dean grumbled as he pulled it over his head, though he fluttered his lashes dramatically at Castiel once it was on.
“So, terrible?” Jack asked, taking a few steps before standing to balance once more. “I guess she wasn’t too happy to find out you’re gay.”
“There’s so many of us now!” Charlie cheered with a grin and she slid into one side, dragging Jo in behind her. Gabriel and Meg slipped in beside them while Sam, Jess, Dean and Castiel slid into the opposite side.
Charlie gave his arm a little squeeze. “That includes you, dude. I don’t think you know the effect you’ve had on Dean.” When Castiel tilted his head in confusion she continued. “He sort of shut down a few years back… like he lost himself or something. He dated Lisa for a long time, but,” she shook her head, “I don’t think it was a good fit. Just kinda seemed—I dunno—convenient, maybe. But before that was even over, he just kinda… vanished. Work and home, and when he had free time, he’d just work
They spent the entire week on a cloud of domestic bliss. On Thursday night, they joined Sam and Jess for dinner to break in Sam’s newly furnished apartment. And when they crowded onto the new sofa to watch Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman, Dean didn’t even complain. It was just as Frosty was ending that Dean’s phone buzzed with a new text message.
He thought about the way Dean had tensed when they first touched in the booth of the bar. But that thought faded as he remembered the way Dean threw his head back when he laughed, and the way his knee nudged into Castiel’s when he spoke, the way Dean’s fingers had lightly brushed along his shoulder, and the way his face had turned pink when he asked for Castiel’s number and even pinker when he said he should call. There was no way that he’d pass up this opportunity.
Dean’s head rested over Cas’s heart, the beat grounding Dean in the moment. He wondered why he’d been so afraid of this… because not only did he not hate it, he felt
He hadn’t really meant to say it out loud, but there was relief in letting it out. He was grateful for his brother’s simple glance, not really wanting to talk about it. But after Ruby left with Meg tonight, Sam realized that they were disposable to one another, each just a warm body keeping the other occupied while they waited for better. But for Sam, better had already come and gone, and he missed her.
The shock must have shown on his face, and Sam laughed as he explained. “I passed by to borrow a wrench early this morning and you weren’t home. I was just guessing about you staying the night, but the look on your face right now tells me I’m right. So, uh, I’m guessing it went well then?”
“Cas, you will never be an imposition,” Dean said pointedly. And it was true, he thought. There would never be a time in which he didn’t want Castiel there, as much as the thought flustered him. “C’mon, let’s bring ‘er over tonight. And if you want to stay, maybe I can cook breakfast in the morning and bring you to work?”
Dean gave her a quick hug before returning to his place as Castiel’s side, taking his hand. They locked eyes while he answered, “What can I say? I love him.”
He shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m just gonna tell her I can’t. I’ll be picking Cas up from the hospital after work anyway.”
He flicked the towel at the headlights as he swaggered back around the front of the Impala, picking up motion in his hips and shoulders as he wiped the water spots from the chrome. When he straightened up to dry the hood, he peeled his damp t-shirt off, tossing it somewhere behind him.
“He doesn’t bite,” Meg said with a smirk to match Gabriel’s. “I mean, he might if you ask nicely, but—”
At the tinkle of the bell attached to the door handle, Donna had nearly leapt over the counter in her hurry to hug him. Castiel froze in surprise and threw Dean a pleading look as he awkwardly patted Donna’s back. Dean just chuckled, watching the commotion with fond amusement.
He finally sat in a chair near the door, waiting for news. With his elbows on his knees, he rubbed at his eyes. He’d never expected to be here, in a hospital waiting room, in an awkward silence with Sam, waiting for news about Dean’s
John was at the sink washing a frying pan and on the stainless-steel island behind him was a plate of sandwiches.
He had to admit that the look on Dean’s face was one of pure adoration, and it was reflected right back in Castiel’s. Even when Dean was with Lisa, before things went south, Sam had never seen him so enamored.
Castiel smiled and accepted Dean’s phone, tapping at the screen. A moment later, he pulled his own phone from his pocket as it chirped a notification. “I’ve got yours now, too.” He held up his phone to show Dean the little yellow smiling emoji he’d sent himself.
She narrowed her eyes dangerously, but Dean saw the faintest bit of humor in them as they arrived in front of her house. “Thanks for the ride, Winchester.”
Gabriel hurried off to find Dr. Hendricks, leaving Dean to stare into those blue eyes he already missed so much.
“Dad’s not home right now,” Sam assured, though it seemed to have the opposite effect on Dean that Sam had intended. It took him only a moment to realize his mistake. “I mean, he’s not
“Unwelcome in my locked apartment while I’m not home?” Castiel hung his bag and jacket by the door, before dropping onto the couch. The apartment was fairly small and plain with warm oak floors and mostly bare walls. The step-up kitchen overlooked the living room which was furnished with little more than a navy-blue couch and ottoman that faced a wall of bookshelves and a television mounted above a fireplace.
—him back in his arms already. Once they were clean and the towel had been tossed aside, they lay together quietly, contentedly holding one another. Dean’s mind swam with thoughts.
Anna’s eyes went wide and she opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, looking to Castiel. “I, uh, actually hadn’t talked to Cassie about it yet…”
Jack reached across the table to squeeze Claire’s hand. Jody smiled at them both while Claire stared shyly at the table.
He saw Dean smile before his face changed to an anxious determination. He watched on as Dean tapped out another message, pausing for a moment and deleting it, then tapping it out again. He paused only for a brief second before hitting send.
The brothers made their way inside, kicking off their boots at the door and slumping down in their self-assigned seats, Sam at one end of the couch with feet crossed on the old coffee table, Dean on the armchair opposite a matching recliner. The recliner was where John sat, though on most days it held little more than coats.
“Boys, bring those pies into the dining room,” Ellen said as she made her way past them into the dining room carrying a large covered dish.
“Dean, I know you. I know who you are, inside and out. I know you’re a brave, kind man. You are passionate and stubborn and confident. You’re sensitive, even though you don’t show it. You love your family and you would sooner put yourself in harm’s way than see them suffer even a little. You’re incredibly smart even though you don’t always believe it. Your soul is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. And you chose
“Y’know what? We’re doing this,” Dean said suddenly, though the confidence in his voice didn’t quite extend to his face. Before Castiel could question, Dean was rounding the front of the Impala and opening the passenger door.
“Wait, what?! Your first date was just on Friday!” Charlie prodded Dean’s shoulder accusingly. She lowered her voice to an audible whisper. “You put out on the first date, didn’t you?” Now Dean’s face was just as pink as Castiel’s.
“Yeah, Dean. This is the right thing.” His voice portrayed a little more confidence than he felt, but he was grateful that Dean seemed to accept his response without question.
Much to Dean’s relief, they didn’t delve any further into their intentions for whatever was happening between them. It wasn’t that Dean was afraid of heading down this new path, but he felt that he had a few things that needed to be addressed before he set out on the journey.
Charlie froze, clearly stunned. Dean had also lost his ability to move. He’d thought about how he’d tell Charlie over and over again, but he knew it didn’t matter. She’d support him through it. He hadn’t really intended on just blurting it out that way, but saying it out loud was like pulling off a band-aid. He was suddenly rushed with emotion. He released his grip on the pie, dropping it onto the countertop as he sunk onto a wrought-iron backed barstool, tears threatening to pour, though he couldn’t put his finger on the specific reason why.
Bobby got to his feet to stand beside Sam. “You’ve got no right to hold this whole family business bullshit over the heads of these boys—” Bobby added in a dangerously low tone.
“So, what about him?” Dean asked, nodding toward a dark-haired man chatting up four giggling women. The man was gorgeous with perfectly tanned skin and luxurious wavy hair that’d make Sam envious.
He leaned down, pressing the slightest kiss against Castiel’s temple before he whispered a barely audible,
Castiel had to swipe at damp eyes as he let out a joyful, relieved laugh, then pulled Dean in for a long, deep kiss. Neither wanted the kiss to end, so instead they let it turn into smaller, gentler kisses, peppering them alone jawlines and cheekbones. When they did finally separate, Castiel took both of Dean’s hands into his own.
The moment that Sam said goodbye to Jess, he began to regret all of his decisions. He felt as though his life no longer had direction. The images he’d had of a happy future all hinged on graduating from Stanford Law, marrying Jess, and starting a family. Instead, Sam spent the last three years studying part time here in Kansas while helping out on his free days with the family business, restoring classic cars at John & Bobby’s garage.
Dean’s chest swelled seeing the two interact. He loved them both, and if they could be brave enough to take a new step in their relationship, maybe Dean could be brave enough to take new strides as well.
. He’d been experiencing emotion in shades of black and white for millennia, but this? He had no idea that it would be like this.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean said, and Castiel noticed a sadness in his eyes. “My dad still doesn’t know. I don’t know when I’ll see him, though. I don’t know how well it’ll go over with him.”
finish before the end of the race, however,” she narrowed her eyes and wagged her finger, “drinking and driving will
. I—I just haven’t had a reason to mention it to anyone before now.” He paused, squeezing Castiel’s hand, “Cas, I’ve had a better time with you in the last 24 hours than I’ve had in…,” he thought for a moment, trying to remember the last time he’d honestly felt happy, “…
Castiel studied the woman, probably for too long because Dean was already beginning to think this was a stupid conversation and he wanted Castiel to stop already.
“Donna!” Dean admonished with a wide, purposeful glare. Castiel’s brows raised in surprise, suspecting that Dean may have been trying to keep her from saying more.
Castiel quickly shook his head, wrapping his arms around Dean. “No, no, that’s not—I just wanted—I want to make sure this is what you want.”
Sam grimaced. “I, uh—I don’t know. We all stayed at Dean’s last night, so I haven’t seen him since—” He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“I—I’ll talk to him,” he said. His voice was scratchy after his silence and he wondered what time it was. He finally pulled his phone from his pocket, noticing a long list of missed calls and messages, mostly from Sam.
“I’m pretty neutral,” Castiel replied, fiddling with his empty cup, “I’m not much of a cook though. But I can make a mean PB&J. And I can order a pizza like no one’s business.”
Dean hugged Castiel a little tighter. He reached out to touch the edge of another frame. This photo was much older, but Castiel recognized the black Impala parked behind a young John and a very pregnant Mary.
Were it not for Bobby and Ellen, the boys would have probably disassociated themselves from John Winchester long ago, but the pair did their best to keep the family intact. When they were old enough, Bobby brought the boys in to work at his garage, a business that had once been John’s passion. But when the time came for Sam to head off to Stanford, John made an emotional plea for his son not to go, imploring him to stay and be a part of the family business. He'd promised that this time he'd make it right, he'd stick around, if only they could be there for one another. However, after Sam agreed, sacrificing his own plan for the start of his adult life, John fell back off the wagon, and was once again gone more often than not.
The way she looked at him threw him off his guard. Dean was suddenly very aware that she was still holding his hand.
“He’s good,” Dean said, pointing a thumb over his shoulder. “Asleep right now. Everything okay with you?” His brows pinched together as he tried to see through his brother’s skull to figure out what was really on his mind.
“Oh, no—no!” Castiel laughed, but it was too late. He was surrounded by his siblings, wrapped up in a tight hug and being kissed all over his face. He could feel Dean shaking with laughter beside him, and though there was a slight pinch of pain in his ribs, he did feel better.
He and Castiel leaned into one another on their wicker loveseat, fingers intertwined, and Dean decided that if he could choose one moment to live for the rest of eternity, it would be this one. And as the countdown began, he closed his eyes.
Castiel didn’t immediately answer, but when Dean finally looked up, he hadn’t been expecting the wide, soft smile and
he’d ever made came flooding to the surface and the words just poured out. By the end of it, he knew he didn’t deserve their forgiveness. He knew it was too late. He’d already left his path of destruction and there was nothing that he could do about it now.
“They really are,” trilled Jo from the cased opening of the dining room where she and Charlie had dragged a chair to hang mistletoe.
“Mmm, so the whole family is gay, then? Miracle you two made it into the world at all,” she bit back.
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry!” Dean relented, now standing shoulder to shoulder with his victim. “Okay, so you just want to kinda squish it up, mix everything up like this...” He placed his hands over Castiel’s, sending a wave of electricity through him as he guided him in blending the spices. "Then you’re gonna flatten it out like this.” He took a handful of beef from the bowl, forming it into a neat patty and presenting it to Castiel. “Got it?”
When he came to a shelf of ceramic figures, he paused. There was a large statue on the center of the top shelf—an angel with beautiful white wings slumped over and weeping. He thought of all the people that had been in this shop before him, of all the patients that hadn’t been as lucky as Castiel. It was a lucky twist of fate that Castiel was still here at all.
“Dean, I’m sorry.” He looked up to meet her apologetic gaze. “I guess I just didn’t want it to be true. I thought—I just wasn’t what you wanted. I was just being selfish. Maybe I need to lay off the eggnog.” She gave him a weak smile which Dean returned. She stood to leave the store room but paused before she opened the door. “I can only hope I’m as lucky as you someday. Maybe I’ll find
He climbed into the center of the nest and fell down to his knees, wondering whether Dean had gone to tell Sam what he’d discovered. That question was answered a moment later when the door re-opened.
Castiel leaned against the kitchen counter, eating one of Dean and Jo’s waffle-cookie concoctions. Sam had fallen asleep half an hour ago with his phone resting on his chest, and Jo and Charlie were slurring drunken whispers to one another beneath the blanket on the couch. Dean set a few empty beer bottles into the sink, laughing to himself as he looked around. Game night always seemed to end this way—drunken bodies sleeping wherever they landed at the end of the night and a mess to clean up the next morning.
and he felt the warmth of a blush creeping into his cheeks. “You must’ve been ruffling some feathers up in Heaven.”
Dean’s mind was a blur. He should have been there. He should never have agreed to meet with Lisa—and
The two settled at a table near the windows that overlooked a small courtyard, delving into the lasagna. “Mmph, I really need to learn to cook,” Castiel sighed after his first bite. “This is amazing.”
As Castiel stepped outside, he headed toward the bench that he’d sat on the first time he’d ever seen Dean. Tonight, however, the bench was occupied by a man in a thick leather jacket. He recognized him immediately and supposed that it was the eggnog that gave him the courage to continue his path.
Dean hesitated, opening his mouth to speak but the words didn’t come out. After a minute, he shook his head. “I can’t.”
Castiel laughed but it was Dean that answered. “Sex, Sammy. Hot gay sex. That’s the trick.” Dean winked at Castiel suggestively, and the look of horror from Sam was priceless.
“D-Dean.” Castiel’s voice was little more than a hoarse whisper, but it was music to Dean’s ears, and he smiled fondly through his fear.
“Hey, uh, you guys hungry?” Sam asked, finally remembering the reason he was standing there. “There’s a diner a couple buildings down. My treat.”
Dean managed a smile, his first smile since Castiel’s texts about pie which seemed like days ago now, though really it had only been a couple of hours. He reached forward to gently take Castiel’s hand, then leaned forward to kiss it lightly.
After about fifteen minutes, Dean finally slipped out of the garage door and turned to lock it behind him. He tossed his bag in the back, leaned over to give a much a welcomed kiss, and smiling that smile that reminded Castiel of just how deeply in love he was each time he saw it.
When Sam and Jess separated, Sam threw a glare at his brother. “You’ve got nerve. I had to sit in my car for an hour the other day while you two Netflix-and-chilled on the couch that
“Sure thing,” she answered with a bright smile as she started preparing his coffee. “And I’ll get that pie all boxed up and ready for you, too.”
They headed inside to find that the dollhouse aesthetic carried right into the motel lobby with its deep green carpeting and flowery wallpaper. There was a grandmotherly old woman waiting at the counter with pink-framed glasses, bouffant hair, and a friendly smile.
By the end of the week, Castiel’s wounds were healing well, and except for the occasional dizzy spell, the lasting effects of his concussion were minimal. On the morning that he was set to be released, Dean had watched with rapt attention when the nurse gave him a lesson on the proper way to change a bandage. Castiel tried to hide his grin as he watched Dean practice, tongue pinched between his teeth as he carefully wrapped gauze around his arm, tight, but not too tight.
He could practically hear the roll of Castiel’s eyes. “Dean, I’ve ridden that motorcycle for years and I haven’t died yet.”
He realized that they were still staring, so he reached for Castiel’s hand once more. The movement seemed to draw him out of wherever his thoughts had carried him off to as well. They made their way inside, both wearing shy smiles. Jo was behind the bar, and she waved them over when she saw the pair enter.
They all settled into their chairs, bowing their heads while Bobby said grace before digging in. Dean piled his plate high with lasagna and garlic bread, even making himself a small salad to appease Ellen.
He and Dean had always had a profound bond, although he didn’t think that Dean understood just how much that bond really meant to him. He’d convinced himself that as long as they were together in this world, he would be satisfied. Living a life alongside the person you love, being a part of a family,
He bent his head close to Dean’s ear and whispered soothingly, “You’re okay, Dean. I’ve got you.” The twitch at the corner of Dean’s lips was enough to rekindle Castiel’s hope. “We should get ice on that.”
“What? No!” He was irritated by her accusation, but he tried to gather his thoughts. He wanted to be honest with her. “I dunno. I mean, it might have played a part, but it didn’t change anything. We just... didn’t work.”
“I—I am,” he replied, keeping his voice low. “I just wanted to tell you—I wanted to say thank you.” He struggled to control the emotion in his voice.
Bobby took a moment to let the idea settle but didn’t seem bothered. “Smart girl. Those two are trouble,” he said, tilting his head at the brothers. Charlie sighed in relief and Dean smiled, genuinely happy to see his friend more at ease.
“I don’t know whether to call this place cute or creepy,” Dean said as he pulled into the parking lot.
Meg and Ruby finally returned to the table, each carrying a fruity cocktail. Instead of sitting, Ruby stood at the end of the bench, frowning at the sight of Sam with his arm still draped over Charlie’s shoulders. She allowed Ruby to reclaim her position at Sam’s side while she pulled up a chair at the end of the table, ignoring Ruby’s contempt. She was too absorbed in the way Dean was watching Castiel at the moment to address it, because Meg had now pushed herself onto the opposite bench, crowding Castiel into Dean's space. For the three to fit, Dean raised and rested his arm on the back of the bench behind Castiel’s shoulders. Meg had placed herself practically in Castiel’s lap, ignoring the look of discomfort that instantly crossed his face.
Ellen ventured out from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel and addressing the room, “Dinner in five. Girls, would you mind setting the table?”
to find some hand soap and towels and cleaned themselves up before heading back downstairs. The diner had a classic ‘50’s vibe with red vinyl booths and a checkered floor. They slid into a booth and pored over their menus.
“Thanks,” Dean grunted as he sat on the stool and dug in. He didn’t care what he was eating but was he glad that he didn’t have to waste the time cooking it himself. The fact that his father remembered how Dean liked his sandwich was just a bonus.
Castiel’s room was rarely ever empty over the days leading up to Christmas, but on Christmas Day, it had turned into a full-on party. Dean was there, of course; he never left Castiel’s side for more time than was absolutely necessary. Sam and Jess had come bearing gifts—a thick and cozy blue cardigan that Castiel put on immediately with Dean’s help—and they were now laughing loudly with Gabriel who had somehow convinced Meg to wear a headband with red and white tinsel pom-poms that matched his own Santa hat. Charlie and Jo had assumed the responsibility of decorating the room, enlisting Anna to help them adorn the walls with garland and handmade paper snowflakes. Even Bobby and Ellen had come by with Christmas cookies and pie, for which Dean was very happy.
Their morning routine was still Dean's favorite part of the day. They woke and Castiel complained about the existence of mornings. They had coffee and breakfast before heading down to the Impala. Castiel gave Dean a goodbye kiss that left tingles on his lips before they parted to begin their workdays. They texted on their lunch break and Dean promised to have lunch at the hospital tomorrow. And when it was finally time to head home, Dean couldn’t wait to have Castiel back within arms’ reach. They spent the evening relaxing at Castiel’s apartment, Castiel reading a book that he rested against Dean’s legs which were laying across his lap while he watched a tv show about car restoration.
It was surprising, even for Dean, how easily he responded, and perhaps even more surprising was that what he said was the truth. "It's a car," Dean breathed. "But you, Cas…”
“Definitely,” Dean said thickly, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s neck. “Can’t wait ‘til next time.”
Sam and Jess sat on one blanket with another wrapped around them. Sam’s long limbs wrapped around Jess from behind. Jess, however, was occupied with poking a long stick through a marshmallow. Charlie and Jo sat side by side in canvas folding chairs, each with their own stick already twirling in the blaze.
They texted one another randomly throughout the day, and every afternoon the Impala was waiting in the parking lot. The weather had gotten colder, so they usually spent their evenings curled up together on the couch binge-watching episodes of Dr. Sexy, which had actually turned into sex on the couch at least twice already. Dean had also reminded Castiel of his promise to help him learn to cook, and together they’d managed spaghetti, grilled chicken, and burgers again, at Castiel’s request.
“Charlie said she’s running late,” Jo commented offhandedly. Sam and Dean both eyed her with suspicion as her cheeks and ears turned pink.
Gabriel didn’t answer. His eyes were busy taking in the sight of his brother. Imagining the shock that he would feel if he walked into a room to find Sam in this state, he reached over and pulled Gabriel into a hug.
Dean stared at the bike, circling slowly to see from every angle. The fenders lay twisted on the floor beside a heap of mangled pipes that had once been the exhaust and the front wheel was bent awkwardly to one side. He sunk onto a rolling stool with his hands held loosely together between his knees. He seemed too small, Sam thought. Too young to be his older brother.
Both girls had to tear their wide eyes away from Dean to start gathering their bags. While Bobby collected their coats, Ellen gave Dean and Castiel each a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek. “Goodnight, boys. We love you so much.”
As he made his way outside, he pulled his jacket tighter around himself. In hindsight, he probably could have had Dean bring him to work as usual and just walked to his own apartment after, but in his own stubbornness he’d jumped at the opportunity to take the Harley out one last time and now he had to get her home.
. Said I’d gotten it out of my system, so she and I could sail off into the sunset and live happily ever after.”
“Mmmh,” Dean murmured, sucking lightly at a spot behind his ear. Castiel began tilting his head to allow access, before steeling himself to pull away.
“And here we thought you two had just run off to get frisky in the back of Dean’s car or something,” Charlie laughed.
A few hours later, the last box had been unloaded and Sam sat on the edge of the empty truck. Jess and Castiel were upstairs sorting the contents of the boxes by room and working on a checklist of items that Sam would have to buy. Dean climbed up to sit beside him, feet swinging below the bumper.
“I’ll give you all a few minutes. I’ll be back when we’re ready for you, Mr. Novak,” Dr. Hendricks said with a parting nod before disappearing through the curtained doorway.
Dean planted a kiss on the sleepy man’s nose before making a break for it. He pulled on an old t-shirt, headed into the bathroom to brush his teeth, and took a deep breath before exiting the room. On the floor outside the door were his flannel and t-shirt and Castiel’s shirt. Seated at the wooden dining table and scrolling through his phone, Sam smirked as Dean scooped them up and tossed them back through the bedroom door.
Time seemed to slow down. Castiel took in every inch as it revealed itself. From the clean new tires to the shiny chrome handlebars, the smooth leather of the elongated seat and then—
Castiel flashed one more smirk up at Dean before giving him what Dean later called the best ‘rise-and-shine’ he’d ever had. With blowjob and breakfast a success, the two spent the rest of the morning curled up on the couch, still in their underwear, watching episodes of Dr. Sexy. Dean sat at one end of the couch while Castiel rested his head in Dean’s lap. The fingers carding through Castiel’s wild hair were gentle and soothing and probably the reason he had zoned out more than once already.
Dean woke in the morning to the smell of coffee. He sighed happily when he opened his eyes, finding himself still wrapped up in Castiel’s arms. He could lay here all day, but if there was coffee being brewed, it meant that someone else was already awake. It definitely wouldn’t be Jo, because she was nearly as grouchy as Cas in the mornings, and Dean suspected that Charlie would be having a rough morning after the shots she’d done the night before.
Holding himself just inches above Dean’s naked body, Castiel crawled back up to be face to face with Dean. There was a nervous but hopeful look in Dean’s eyes that lit a fire in Castiel.
. He had tried to bide his time, taking longer than necessary to carefully sculpt his hair, meticulously choosing an outfit, going with a steel-gray V-neck under a black jacket and his best fitting dark-wash jeans. But even wasting time as he had, his eagerness found him pacing the floor, just waiting for time to tick by so that he could head over to Castiel’s building.
“Oh my God, why is this so good?” he said, his mouth still half-full. Dean laughed, feeling the sadness of their family stories ebb.
John nodded and started fishing through his pockets until he found his keys. “Yeah, I’m sure she will. I, uh, guess I should go on home. If you need anything—or if Castiel needs anything—just say the word and I’m there.”
Castiel swallowed hard as he allowed Dean to explore. The man had a way of moving his lips across his skin that absolutely destroyed him. And the sinful little hums and moans had Castiel throbbing in his jeans. When Dean paused at the button on his waistband, looking up with questioning green eyes, and a low “
“Dean, I don’t want to make the same mistakes he did. I want to be there for him. I don’t want to be that person that just stands by and watches him drowning. He needs us right now. He’s making the effort… I want to give him the chance. I"m not saying forgive and forget--I just want to, I don't know... move on.”
Charlie and Jo carried enough beer bottles for everyone while Sam had his hands full with a large salad bowl and serving utensils, each disappearing one by one into the dining room. Bobby stopped on his way out holding a glass dish filled with the roasted potatoes and vegetables, giving Dean the kind of dull stare that only Bobby could—one that said everything was going to be fine. “C’mon, boy. Let’s eat.”
Castiel looked apprehensive, hesitating a moment before answering. “I guess you could say that. Actually, I wasn’t given much choice in the matter. Meg works on another floor of the hospital where I work. She cornered me in the cafeteria and told me to meet her here at 8 o’clock because we had a date. I agreed before I even knew what was going on.” He ran his hands through his hair sheepishly, effectively making it stand up even more than it already did. The bedhead look suited him, Dean thought.
“Goddammit Cas, is this shirt welded on?!” Castiel shook with laughter before straightening himself upright on his knees, still straddling over Dean’s hips. Dean pulled his own shirt off over his head in one quick motion so that he could appreciate the sight of Castiel above him, slowly removing his shirt to reveal toned, tanned skin. Castiel looked hungrily at Dean who gasped slightly, suddenly unable to resist the urge to touch. He ran his thumbs over prominent hip bones.
he thought as his eyes widened as he wrapped his legs tightly around Castiel’s hips, hands clinging to his sturdy shoulders. Dean had never been handled this way—had never felt the strong hands of a man hold him, but
“Yes. Yes, he does,” Dean quickly nodded, having had to endure listening to drunk Sam many, many times over the years.
There was a moment of comforting silence between them before Jess replied in a low voice. “I’m so happy to hear that, Sam.
The swirling of Sam’s thoughts stopped abruptly, and he looked between Dean and Castiel. “I… Are you sure, Dean? I don’t want to, uh, impose.”
“No, thank you. Thank you all for taking me in tonight, especially after I ruined your date, Sam,” he replied.
Dean strode, alone, toward the nest with an armful of blankets and pillows. Castiel tilted his head in question.
Castiel fumbled with his keys. He could feel Dean’s eyes burning into his back as the key finally turned in the lock. When the door swung open, Dean took him by surprise, grabbing his wrist, spinning him around. The two stumbled over the threshold in a flurry of heated kisses.
Sam knew that Dean wouldn’t have plans, even though it was Friday night. Unlike himself, Dean hadn’t had much of a social life since he and Lisa broke up last year. He knew the split was amicable, but something seemed different about Dean lately. In fact, he and Sam had somehow changed roles, with Sam now being the Winchester more likely to bring home a random waitress than his once infamously womanizing older brother.
The group shared a long laugh before Chuck patted her shoulder apologetically. “You’d better get used to it,” Chuck said.
“Look, I’m not here to fight,” John said, the hardness in his voice ebbing once again. “I—I’m here to… to try and fix what I fucked up.”
They sat in the diner an hour later, beaming at one another. There was an ease that Castiel associated with Dean. When he was near, he felt calm. He felt… home? Was
Castiel smiled back as Dean leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and slow at first—a promise of things to come—then deepening into something more heated.
.” He felt himself getting emotional, the gratitude and love for these people bubbling to the surface. He looked around at them all, recalling all the little things that they’ve done, things that had changed his life.
“Shut up. Let’s go,” he said, standing and collecting their empty cups. Castiel laughed and followed him outside to the Impala.
“Anyway,” Gabriel continued, “you get some rest, and I’ll make sure Dean-o here takes care of himself before coming back tonight.”
“Nope, but now I have some ideas for later,” he chuckled. “Just wanted to let you know I might be late picking you up.”
He turned toward the voice to find a tall handsome man in blue scrubs, flipping through the chart that had been hung near the entrance of the room.
While everyone else retreated to the living room, Dean slipped out the back door and sat on the edge of the porch. He pulled his phone from his pocket and checked the time before dialing Castiel’s number.
With twenty minutes to go, Castiel sat forward and cleared his throat, drawing everyone’s attention.
The rest of the family followed suit, leaving Dean and Castiel with fond smiles and extra tight hugs. Dean knew that they were only leaving to give them some privacy, but his heart overflowed with gratitude for each and every one of them.
The pair made quick work of collecting the ingredients for burgers along with a few things for Dean to restock his empty refrigerator. Before heading to check out, Dean grabbed a case of beer and stood staring between a selection of fresh apple and cherry pies for several minutes before Castiel suggested he just buy one of each.
“Come on, Dean. We both know Dean Winchester is a ladies’ man and always has been. This thing—, “she lowered her voice to a whisper, “this
“Alright, I think Cas is just about done for the night, hm?” He gave Castiel a quizzical look to which he just nodded. “It’s been fun, but I think we’re gonna get out of here.”
“Same,” she said, resigned. “This has been a long time coming. I don’t know how much you know about John—?”
The place was packed. It seemed like the entire town had turned out for the party. Castiel knew that his brother and Meg were somewhere inside, but he couldn’t see them yet. Near the bar he could see Sam towering over most of the crowd. He tugged on Dean’s hand and pointed. Dean nodded and they slid through the crowd toward the bar.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked, lightly ruffling the short hair on the back of Dean’s head. There was a long pause where he could feel Dean holding his breath.
He received another kiss in response. “Dean, you—,” he grinned back at him, “you make me very happy.”
Thirty minutes later, he returned with a large bag of muffins and a box of pastries. Charlie was awake again, now seated at the kitchen island with a bottle of water while Sam was disposing of the bottles in the sink. “’Morning, Officer Bradbury,” Dean greeted Charlie with an amused grin.
Dean ignored the question and turned on his heel, stomping out of the kitchen and down the hall. If Sam didn’t know, then there was only one other person to ask…
He washed his hands and turned back to watch the man that had undeniable captivated him toss the burgers into a pan. He sat in a happy silence, letting the possibilities flow through his mind as Dean artfully twirled his spatula.
“What the fuck is this?” John asked, glaring from Dean to Castiel, then turning to face Sam and Bobby again.
“Well, hi there, Jo,” Dean greeted with exaggerated cheerfulness. “Something you wanna share with the class?”
Castiel’s head dropped. His chest felt heavy, like it was being crushed under the weight of anger and fear. Dean slid across the bench seat in an instant, reaching across to cup Castiel’s face in his hands and lock eyes once more.
“No, Cas, that—that’s not—” He reached out to cup Cas’s face, tracing the shape of his cheekbone under his thumb. “Cas, I don’t want any secrets… Not about this. Not about
Dean kept his eye on his cup as he sat in an empty chair. “So, you’re saying you’re cool with--,” he pointed a thumb over his shoulder toward his bedroom.
Dean rubbed at the back of his neck. “What about my place? There’s plenty of room for you—I mean, there’s lots of space in the garage. There’s plenty of space. I, uh… I can keep her safe for you. I mean, if you wanted—”
“Well, that was cute,” said a bearded man in a trucker cap as he wandered into the kitchen. Dean’s eyes went wide, and his face turned a crimson to rival the cherries. The man opened the refrigerator and retrieved three bottles. Handing one each to Castiel and Dean, he gave a small smirk. “Go on, boy, introduce me to your fella here.”
“So… Officially on your own now, huh?” Dean gave him a weak smile. He’d never been good at hiding his concern for his brother.
“Well, first of all, it’s almost eleven o’clock,” he responded, sending his text and setting his phone face-down on the table, “but, apparently, I—I, uh, drunk texted Jess last night.” Dean’s eyes widened, but he didn’t speak. “I guess drunk Sam likes to share his feelings.”
Dean laughed and rubbed his neck shyly. The motion became more endearing each time Castiel spotted it. “Ellen, I’d like to introduce you to Castiel Novak. Cas, Ellen Harvelle.”
It was only a few blocks to the hospital, and Castiel was used to the walk, opting to leave his motorcycle parked in the safety of his building’s secure parking lot during work most days, but there was absolutely no chance in hell that Castiel would turn down the offer this morning. They bid goodbye to Donna and climbed into the Impala, Castiel feeling much more awake now than he had when he entered the shop. His brain finally catching up to him, he turned his head, watching as Dean started the engine.
He pulled Castiel close with the arm already around his shoulder, kissing the top of his head. When Castiel turned to look up at him, Dean could see contentment in those deep blue eyes, flickering in the firelight. He gave a half smile, and Castiel returned it. Dean couldn’t tell if it was the heat of the bonfire or the smile, but his face felt warm and his heart felt full.
Castiel lay on the narrow bed, attached by tubes and wires to a number of beeping, humming, and hissing machines. While his helmet had protected his face, it hadn’t changed the fact that he’d had to bear the impact of the car and then the ground. His hair was its usual mess, but the blue eyes that Dean longed to see were shut tight while a sturdy neck brace held his head still. He was covered in scrapes and bandages, and bruises that Dean knew from experience as a mechanic would only look worse before they got better. On his left leg, a fresh cast covered him from his knee to his toes and it was propped up on a thick foam pillow.
Dean stood frozen beside the Impala. Sam’s hair flew up as he spun quickly back to face him, searching for words that never made it past his lips. Dean wouldn’t have heard the words anyway. His ears were currently filled with a deafening
He couldn’t have stopped the wanting sigh that left him if he’d tried. Castiel’s hands had moved beneath his flannel and under the hem of his t-shirt, and his fingertips felt like feathers moving softly over Dean’s skin. Their slow, deep kisses turned rough and greedy. Dean pulled back slightly, and Castiel’s lips chased his own for a moment, reluctant to separate.
—sat in the middle of three little girls. The girls were in Christmas nightgowns and the dog wore a headband with reindeer antlers.
He didn’t even hear the door slide open behind him and didn’t look up when Sam sat in the chair that Miracle had just abandoned. Sam didn’t have to ask what was going through Dean’s mind. It was plainly written on his face.
Castiel sighed, grateful for the glass that Jo placed on the counter. “Thanks, Jo. Can I get another? This one isn’t going to last very long.” He took a deep chug.
“Oh, he’s great, getting big. You know, they grow like weeds. Me? I’m doing okay. Been doing some thinking...”
He grabbed Cas by the wrist and spun him around to face him. The rain had flattened his usually wild hair and his clothes clung to him. For a former angel, he seemed so small and Dean felt a rushing need to protect him from the harsh human world.
When the room fell quiet again after the last goodbyes, Dean watched Castiel smiling down at the silver angel, running his thumb over the engraving. He’d never felt so sure of anything in his life.
She squeezed his hand as she looked him up and down. “Wow look at you. You look great. Happy is a good look on you.”
Apparently home cooked meals were a direct path to Castiel’s flirty side. Dean could feel the heat of a blush creeping over his face. “Back at ya, Cas,” he reciprocated, “I mean—you know what they say…”
“Dean’ll stay the night,” Gabriel said without hesitation. When Dean pinched his brows in surprise, Gabriel gave him a conciliatory look. “Dad and Anna are driving in tonight, so I’ll need to meet them when they get here. You should stay.”
Castiel arrived at his building just before dark. Dean would be coming to pick him up in just two hours. Usually Castiel was quite calm about first dates; he’d been on plenty of those. But he was less accustomed to second or third dates. And although they’d agreed that lunch at the hospital, coffee at the bakery, burgers at Dean’s, and the night they met at the bar were not
Ellen was quick to catch on. “Yeah, I think we’re gonna head out, too. Jo? You and Charlie want a ride?”
He shook away the thought, going over all the reasons that made the idea ridiculous. First of all, they’d only just met, and Dean was not some kind of Disney princess falling for the guy at first sight. Secondly, this man was here on a date with Meg, and Dean had absolutely no reason to assume that he was even attracted to men. And, most importantly, Dean had absolutely zero experience with dating men anyway. He’d finally come to terms about his own interest in men about 3 years ago, but he had never actually acted upon it, nor had he mentioned his revelation to anyone else.
“I am not fragile,” Castiel groused when Donna had finally released her stranglehold. She was a lot stronger than she looked, he thought.
“I know, Cassie,” he offered with a sincere smile. “I can tell.” He patted his younger brother’s knee as he stood to leave. “For what it’s worth, I like him.”
Even with the time saved by not having to drive to Castiel’s building, they’d arrived late. It didn’t help that Dean had gotten somewhat distracted when he’d emerged from the bathroom to find Castiel sprawled on his bed looking festive in his bright red button up and a flashing necklace shaped like colorful twinkling lights. Castiel had insisted that the gray V-neck sweater that Dean had picked out was boring and after several minutes of negotiations that became playfully dirty, they compromised on an emerald green sweater of the same design as the gray one.
Once he regained movement in his limbs, he found Castiel standing before a mirror in the bathroom attempting to flatten his hair. Dean slid in behind him, lining kisses along the curve of the base of his neck.
Sam laughed and pointed back at the kitchen. The waffle-maker sat on the counter, caked with cookie dough. The sink was still filled with empty bottles and empty pizza boxes were stacked on the counters.
“I wouldn’t have asked you to ride with me if it was unsafe. I promise. And you know how much I hate breaking promises,” he said with a raised brow, hoping to distract Dean from his nerves by reminding him of his morning treat. The fleeting smile that appeared seemed to indicate that it was working.
Dean groaned, sitting up to collect the fallen bottles and line them up with the empties already on the table beside him. Miracle didn’t bother lifting her head as she watched.
The kitchen smelled of roasted potatoes and pot roast, and the smell warmed Castiel to his core. Ellen stood at the counter chopping vegetables, turning when she sensed their presence behind her. Her face split into a wide smile as she greeted Dean with a hug. “Hey there, hon. I’m so glad you boys came.”
The look on Dean’s face gave Castiel the impression that he hadn’t even thought about what happened to the bike. Gabriel, however, shared a look with Meg that made Castiel believe he knew something that he didn’t really want to divulge.
Castiel carefully walked a few paces never losing contact with Dean’s lips. They continued through a door just off the kitchen and into a bedroom where Dean was suddenly dropped onto a bed.
“Spanish, yes,” Cas answered. “This television doesn’t get many channels, and this was the most interesting thing on.”
.’ You won’t have to do this alone, you know.” Dean looked at him fondly, eyes glossy. “Now… I’m going to order some pizzas. You’re going to make sure there’s enough beer. And
When he turned toward the direction of the stairs, he realized he wasn’t alone in the hallway. He averted his eyes when he spotted Gabriel and Meg kissing in the doorway of Apartment 3B, but it was too late.
He sat for a long time, occasionally touching his hands to his face, struggling to contemplate what this all meant. When he finally spoke, his eyes stayed locked to the floor at the base of the stand and his voice was small, catching in his throat.
Dean downed the rest of the half-full beer in his hand. “Well, uh—I... I invited him to hang out. We made some burgers.”
“Dean, you don’t have to explain. Charlie, um, filled in some of the gaps for me.” He worried for a moment that Dean would be angry, but instead he looked somewhat relieved.
“Oh, I was,” Castiel said with a straight face, sipping his coffee. “I anticipated you’d want coffee and baked goods, so I’ve been waiting here for you for about 20 minutes now.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously, casting a look to Sam and Bobby before answering. “Actually, uh…
Castiel didn’t know John very well, but from the reactions of his sons, he didn’t think ‘please’ was a word that he used very often. Dean reluctantly nodded before turning to Castiel.
.” There was the sound of a quick intake of breath, and Dean suddenly stood very still. Castiel stepped back with a sly smile, pleased to see Dean fallen speechless. With a quick, innocent peck on the tip of Dean’s nose, he made his way back to the bedroom to finish getting ready.
