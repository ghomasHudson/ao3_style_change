Obligingly, Steve bit down, enjoying the way Tony bucked against him.  He shifted carefully, hovering above Tony to reach the other nipple without putting pressure on the arc reactor.  “You’re so beautiful,” Steve breathed.
“I’ll get it.”  He kissed Tony’s cock before standing up to rifle through the bedside table.  “That is the biggest downside to makin’ time with a gent – needing slick.”
Steve’s hand slid around his waist to his cock, slippery with lube and precome.  “I think you do care,” Steve whispered as he wrapped his hand around Tony’s cock, moving it in time with his own thrusts.  “You want them to catch us, don’t you doll?  Want everyone to see you bent over for me?”
“That’s the cardinal rule of the Tower,” Tony agreed.  “This is… not.”  His eyes flashed to Steve, finding the supersoldier’s expression fondly amused.  “Nuh-uh, do not cite rule two at me.”
He spotted a relatively intact but empty storefront and clomped into it, feeling the seething heat behind him that meant Steve was on his heels.  Tony wasn’t about to let him get the upper hand here, though.
Steve laughed again.  "Maybe you'd rather I take you in front of them, hmm?  Team building exercise, to see it?  See you on your knees for me... begging.  You beg so sweet for me."
Tony returned to the table on legs that didn’t quite want to work.  He ignored a slightly raised eyebrow from a staff member, a knowing smirk from another patron.  He was too relaxed – too flooded in endorphins – to care.  Perhaps that was Steve’s motivation.  Tony returned to his dessert feeling considerably less stressed about the whole endeavor.
Much as he loved to make Tony beg, Steve also didn’t want to make him wait – and hell, he was hard enough to hurt.  He pulled his fingers free, pausing to kiss Tony’s cock once more before pulling back, adding lube to his cock before shifting to kneel between Tony’s spread knees.  “Slow or fast?” Steve asked, his cock poised just brushing against Tony.
As soon as the doors closed behind Pepper, Tony was on Steve – kissing him hungrily, hands sliding under the t-shirt to feel the warm, broad back.  “Tell me you meant it, Steve.  Tell me – tell me you really want me.”
Tony grinned.  “I stole it from Star Trek.”  At Steve’s utter lack of comprehension, Tony groaned and dropped his head, pressing his forehead against Steve’s.  “Yeah, we’ll get there.  You’d like Captain Picard.  He’s as noble and honorable as you.”
“Cap.”  Tony inserted himself in Steve’s pace path.  “He’s gonna be fine.  At worst, it’s a broken leg.  Chances are he just sprained the hell out of it.”
Tony locked his legs around Steve's waist, the heel of one foot pressed into the flesh of Steve's ass.  "I appreciate."  His own orgasm had left him loose and relaxed -- and yeah, a little oversensitive, but he'd never stop Steve now.  "Come on, Cap -- give it to me."  He meant it to sound like a challenge -- instead, it was a plea.
For a fraction of a second, Steve considered confessing – just telling Tony what he was thinking.  But he knew damned well how that would end, and… and Steve couldn’t take Tony running away from him.  Just… couldn’t.  He also couldn’t lie to Tony.  “If I could talk about it, it would be to you,” he said finally.  He reached out and put a hand on Tony’s thigh, noting the other man had gotten naked at some point as well.
“It was exactly what I needed.”  Steve shifted his hands to Tony’s head, tangling in his hair and guiding the kiss.  “Thank you.”  There was more he wanted to say… needed to say… but didn’t.
“We can never, ever tell Director Fury that his comments today are what prompted us to get our heads out of our asses.”
“JARVIS wouldn’t let anybody in,” Tony reassured him – but he did clamber off Steve.  “Getting shy on me, soldier?”
“I thought maybe…” Tony began, trailing his fingers over Steve’s pecs.  “Be honest with each other.”
“I thought I could handle it,” Steve said softly.  “I thought I could – could just have… have sex with you and ignore…”  He turned back to Tony, squaring those magnificent shoulders.  “I’m sorry.  I knew you didn’t want anything serious, and I – ”
Tony groaned and arched up against Steve’s mouth, his hands moving to the blond head.  “It’s – it’s your turn, isn’t it?  I owe you a – ”
There was that fluttering again.  Steve smiled.  “Yeah.”  He nuzzled Tony’s cheek before kissing him again.  “Just between you and me.  It’s a matter between – between co-leaders, right?”
Rhodey’s eyes blazed.  “Doesn’t she have fucking eyes?  I know it’s real for you, kid.  I’m not sure about the big blond lug, but I know it is for you.”  He made a motion like he was reaching for the screen – reaching to touch Tony.  “Christ, I knew that months ago.  How could she not – ”
It took another hour for Steve to get in to see Clint.  He didn’t stay long.  The leg was broken, but it would heal.  Clint was going to be fitted with a cast and Natasha had assured him that she’d see to Clint’s recovery.  Steve didn’t doubt her.
“Yeah, we shredded those.”  Steve leaned forward to kiss him.  “What do you have in mind for new ones, then?”
Tony bit his lip.  “I mean.  Nobody here had a good relationship with their dad.  Odin’s an asshole, Natasha’s father sold her to the Red Room, Clint’s father beat him and Barney and then got himself and their mother killed in a DUI wreck… and Howard…”
A smile grew on the supersoldier’s face.  “Yeah?”  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s cock and added a third finger.  “I like being able to say it aloud.  I call you that in my head all the time.”
The cast was – well, starstruck.  Tony was used to that… but it was amazing to watch Steve.  His partner didn’t just sign autographs and pose for photos – he chatted earnestly with each of the actors about their roles and the play in general.  He discussed similar shows and the changes in theater over the decades – marveled at the costume design and gushed over the elaborate sets.
Steve stroked his hand down Tony’s back.  “I can’t imagine objecting real hard to that, love.”  He used a hand on Tony’s chin to tilt his face up for a kiss.  “I happen to like you spontaneous.  Keeps life interesting.”
Steve hand slid down his back to cup Tony’s ass.  “You’re probably tired… you know I don’t expect – ”
The fighting wasn’t anything spectacular.  Bruce refused to shift into Hulk – and he was not well suited to sparring otherwise.  Thor was holding back against Natasha out of some misguided sense of chivalry… despite being fully aware that Natasha would kick his ass for it (and Sif would help).  Clint seemed to enjoy taunting Tony more than teaching him.  After ten minutes, Steve called a halt.
Steve huffed a laugh, still not releasing Tony.  His cock was softening and slipping out, but Steve didn’t care.  It wasn’t like holding Tony up was a strain on his muscles, and he wasn’t ready to move yet.  “I’m serious about this.  I can’t think – when you… when you do shit like that, fly into danger and I can’t – Tony, I need you to believe me.”  He lifted his head finally, meeting Tony’s eyes.  “Losing you would shatter me, okay?  Please… please be careful.”
Rhodey clearly could see it in Tony’s posture, and Steve’s estimation of the man grew several orders of magnitude when he nodded slowly.  “I’ll call her.”  He paused, and when he spoke again it was very gentle – almost as one would address a frightened child.  “What did she say, sting ray?”
It wasn’t the frantic coupling they so often had – no sweat and grime from the battlefield, no desperation.  They moved fluidly together, a mutual give-and-take.  Tony sighed and moaned, arching up to meet Steve’s thrusts.  Steve kept his pace slow as long as they both could stand it – but no amount of self-control could prevent them from rising to the peak eventually.
If Tony had a dollar for every time he’d heard somebody in his life say ‘Damn it, Tony’ in that defeated tone, he’d have been – well, a hell of a lot richer than he already was.
“Oh, you better believe it.”  Steve leaned forward, pinning Tony firmly against the door, and started thrusting.  He wasn’t holding back.  His hands were tight on Tony’s hips, creating leverage as he drove up into him.  Tony’s hands curled around his shoulders and dug in as the relentless thrusts sped up.  “What’s the golden rule, doll?”
Steve grinned and met Tony’s lips for a kiss.  “I got more than one round in me, babydoll.  We can do both.”
Steve was already getting hard again as Tony’s tongue caressed him.  He couldn’t tell Tony that it was from watching the fight on TV – that he’d been aching hard since the end of the fight, anticipating just this.  Even without having fought himself… Steve was dealing with an excess of adrenaline.  “Maybe you just have better coffee.”
“No.”  Tony leaned in to kiss him again.  “I don’t think so.  That’s not what I want, anyway.”  His face shifted, showing his inner vulnerability.  “Unless you…”
“Not that rough,” Steve promised.  But he wasn’t taking his time prepping Tony, either.  Two fingers only – quick and brisk, the bare minimum of prep… and wouldn’t have been enough, if they hadn’t been doing this more regularly than either of them would admit.
“I don’t care,” Tony moaned, tipping his hips just enough to get Steve deeper – to nail that perfect angle that would light them both up.  “Holy fuck, Steve – yes, right there – ohmygod.”
Steve twisted to stare at him.  “No, you don’t, Tony.  If you wanted to talk about this – this – whatever it is between us – hell, you’ve had every opportunity and you shut down, every time.  I’m not the genius you are, but even I can figure out that means no fucking talking!”
He didn’t – but he also could guess he wouldn’t like it.  He didn’t answer her as he continued to prepare tea, ignoring the sick feeling in his stomach.
Tony squirmed, reaching for his glass of water with a shaky hand.  “I am writing a letter of protest to every publisher of every book that ever described you as a paragon of virtue.”
“Damn it.”  Clint groaned and banged his head on the couch.  “Phil’s going to be insufferable.  He was off by one fucking day.  How does he do that?”
Living together had come as easily as their battlefield trysts.  Steve delighted in waking before Tony, making sure a pot of coffee was brewing by the time the engineer stirred from bed.  Tony discovered how much Steve loved to have his shoulders rubbed, and committed to doing it before bed whenever possible.
Steve smirked up at him between kisses, edging down towards his bellybutton.  “I like making you roll your eyes at me.”
He sat back on his heels and looked up at Steve, panting for breath.  “Good for you, soldier?”  His voice was rough, throat raw – and he loved it.
Tony didn’t try to hide his tears.  He cradled Steve’s head against him, breathing hard and trying to keep it from turning into sobs.  “You won’t have to beg, sugar.  Someday – someday I’ll say yes, and shout it to the fucking rooftops.”
Pepper crossed the room and sat down on the stool next to him.  “This is going to hurt his reputation, Tony.”
Laughing, Tony accepted the inevitable.  Sometimes he could manage to get Steve to shower afterwards – but times like this?  Waking up later, sticky, was a fair price to pay for cuddling an affectionately sleepy supersoldier.  Tony caught the edge of their duvet and pulled it around them.  A nap wouldn’t hurt anything, after all.  “Sweet dreams, sugar,” Tony whispered, and kissed Steve’s temple.
“Maybe.  Sure.”  Steve’s eyes were on him now, forcing him to maintain the gaze.  “You couldn’t have told me that in the field?  Let me send somebody with you?”
Steve’s eyes slid to Tony’s and his lips quirked.  “You wanna add that to the list?  It’d make a good number six.”
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut.  “Answer to that’s the same as the previous question, sugar… you.  Always you.”  He’d intended to make love to Steve – to trail hands and kisses over that beautiful body, to whisper praises – but the way Steve was touching him now, he kind of wanted to just relax into it and let Steve make the choices.
Not knowing how to answer that – because that sounded suspiciously like admiration – Steve instead slid his hands down Tony’s body to cup his ass.
“If that were true, we’d already be there,” Steve said drily.  He pulled Tony to him once more, before his lover had to step back into the Iron Man suit.  “Taking you up against a wall in the dust and debris is not a Captain America responsibility,” he murmured.  “It is, however, very much required to keep Steve Rogers sane.”
Steve shucked his gloves off, throwing them at the feet of the waiting Iron Man suit.  "You want to feel me, hmm?"  Steve slid his hands down Tony's back to grab his ass two-handed, then lifted.  Obligingly, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist.  Steve took two steps forward to press Tony's back into a concrete column.  "I should make you work for it," Steve whispered, his teeth closing on Tony's earlobe.  "Five minute delay for every ignored protocol in the battle."
Steve cried out, his back arching.  The movement of his hips stuttered and Tony tried to make up the slack, thrusting up into him.  “Oh, fuck,” Steve whispered, “right – yes, right there, babydoll.”  His eyes fluttered shut and on the end of one long moan, he came – spurting hot come onto his own chest, splattering down onto Tony.
“Mostly just teasing,” Tony admitted, kissing Steve again.  He couldn’t get enough – never could.  “But I wouldn’t mind taking turns… I like seeing you fall apart on my cock.”  He nibbled his way to Steve’s ear, only half aware that Steve was carrying him to the bedroom.
“Say it with your hands when you touch me,” Steve murmured.  He reached for the hem of Tony’s t-shirt.  “Say it with your lips when you kiss me.  I don’t need to hear it with your voice, doll – I can see it in your eyes, now that I know where to look.”
“She can go fuck herself,” Tony mumbled, tugging at Steve’s collar so that he could nip at the skin it hid.  “Need to taste you right now.”  He tried to unfasten Steve’s tie with shaking fingers.  “Mine.”
“So do you, sweetheart.”  Tony kept his hands on Steve’s back, sucking a breath as he bottomed out.  “So tight for me.”  He pulled out slowly, achingly slow, and pushed in at the same agonizing pace.
Steve slung his arm around Tony’s waist as they got in the elevator.  “Hm.  I’d say it was an insufficient data set, doll.  Might have to repeat the experiment.”
“Well, in that case,” Steve chuckled, pulling his fingers free.  Tony keened at the loss, even knowing he’d soon be filled with something much more satisfying.  Steve poured more lube on his cock, slicking it up with a groan of his own.  “Look what you do to me,” he murmured to Tony, his hand tight around his cock.  “Look how hard I am for you, sweetheart.”  Steve shifted, pressing the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
“Ready to head home, love?” Steve murmured in his ear.  His hand slipped under Tony’s jacket, fingers teasing along the waistband of his pants.
“As old as you are, baby.”  Tony grinned and tightened his grip on Steve, who groaned.  “You getting close, love?  Or do you need more?”
“I love you too.”  It was still weird to say it – and he didn’t, always – but it was good too.  Tony started to move his hand faster on Steve, adding a second hand to fondle his balls… and edge a little further back.
“Bedroom.”  Tony started peeling off articles of clothing, abandoning them along the way.  “Think I should reward you for putting up with this tonight, sweetheart.”
“Are you sure?”  Tony’s hand on his face stilled.  “Because this isn’t something you get to take back, baby.  Once the media catches wind, they’ll crucify you.”  At Steve’s frown, Tony shook his head slowly.  “Plenty of people will be pissed enough that you’re dating a man… a whole hell of a lot more will be pissed that it’s me.”
“I want it all, everything you are.  Every broken piece of you.”  Tony tensed in his arms.  “And I’m not going to try to fix you, doll.  You’re the mechanic, the engineer.  I’ll just hand you the tools you need and sit back to watch you be amazing again.”
The waiter arrived – and he managed to contain almost all his starstruck expression.  Steve was mildly impressed with how nonchalantly they were offered drinks and menus – he reminded himself to tip well.  Tony ordered something pasta related in flawless Italian.  Steve seconded it, and added two cups of espresso.  When Tony raised an eyebrow, Steve smiled.  “I’ve got plans for you later, sweetheart,” he murmured softly, uncaring whether the retreating waiter heard him or not.  “I’d like you to be wide awake for them.”
“Yeah, I can understand that.”  Steve covered Tony’s hands with his own, just holding on.  “I mean, that kind of explains why he’s so… um…”
Love swamped Tony again.  Something that simple – the concern of one artist over the recognition of others – floored him.  He wasn’t sure if he’d ever been with someone who thought that.  Ty would have wanted to make a scene, preferably one that skirted the line of indecent exposure.  Sunset wouldn’t have cared – but she’d have wound up drawing attention by being visibly bored.  Pepper would have required them to keep their hands to themselves, but not out of concern for the actors – out of a desire to avoid bad press.  This was… different.  Steve cared.  He wanted the men and women on stage not to be distracted or overshadowed and that… that was damned amazing.
“Yeah, but you and I both know that’s not why you listen to me.”  Steve sighed.  “I’m not sure I even know why you listen.”
JARVIS was unfazed by his creator’s displeasure.  “Brian Banner was arrested but not convicted for the bludgeoning death of his wife, Rebecca.”
Tony refused to admit how adorable it was that Steve squeaked in bed.  “Right, then.”  And Tony took the head of Steve’s cock between his lips – and didn’t cover his teeth.  He wasn’t biting, just… letting his teeth scrape over the skin lightly.  He was careful not to use too much pressure – still wanted Steve to enjoy it – but he wasn’t be any means gentle.
Steve didn’t hesitate, and he didn’t dally.  He reached into Tony’s open pants, through the slit in his boxers, and drew out his already-leaking cock.  Steve lapped up the precome, kissed the flared tip, and swallowed Tony’s cock down.
Something swooped in Tony’s stomach and he ignored it.  “I got you,” he promised softly.  Leaning forward, he pressed his chest against Steve’s back.  The hand he’d used to slap slid around to Steve’s cock, grasping it firmly.  “This what you need, baby?”  Another nod, this one accompanied by a groan.  “God, you’re so hard again.  God bless America.”
Steve looked down to realize – yes, he’d almost crumpled the skillet.  He set it down on the stove and stepped back, rubbing his hands on his khakis.  “Sorry.”
“Baby, for you, there aren’t many ‘-ist’s I’m not willin’ to try.”  Steve propped his head up on his elbow, gazing across the table at Tony.  “Too bad people would notice if I slipped under the table… I’d like to suck you off right here in front of God and everyone, see if you can keep quiet while I take you apart.”
“Yup.”  Tony kissed his ass again, leaning in to do the same to the rim of his hole.  “I like to torment you, and it’s easier once you’ve had one good orgasm.  You’re so fucking tight, Steve.”  He returned his attention to the task at hand, licking and kissing as he fingered Steve open.  When he’d managed a second finger, he nudged in carefully and slid his tongue in as well.
He set up a grueling pace, trying to push Tony’s limits without actually hurting him.  Tony met every thrust with an almost desperate hunger, heels digging into Steve’s ass, thighs slapping against Steve’s.  The soldier tried to hold out, but it wasn’t long before he was gasping.  “Tony, if we don’t slow down I’m going to come right now.”
“This isn’t really fair without the suit,” Tony protested as he stretched on the mats.  “I’m just going to get my ass handed to me.”
Tony chuckled and wriggled his toes until he could catch the comforter they’d shoved to one side, pulling it up over them.  “I think we’ve earned a nap.”
“Nerd.”  Tony leaned in and kissed Steve, his hand continuing a slow stroke.  “I’m sure DUM-E tried to douse you in flame retardant.”
“Don’t get used to it.”  Tony waited until she’d left the dining room before turning back to Steve.  “You sure you’re okay with this?”
Raking his teeth along the vein on the bottom of Steve’s cock, Tony felt the fingers in his hair tighten.  Good – let him find a second orgasm fast.  It would make working for three and four more satisfying.  Tony worked two of his own fingers into his mouth beside Steve’s cock, slobbering sufficiently to wet them so that he could press against Steve’s asshole with them.
Steve lifted Tony onto his lap.  “No, I wouldn’t.”  He made sure Tony’s face was hidden against him before he glared at Bruce – and then, for good measure, at the rest of the team.  “You wouldn’t either, doll.  That’s not how our rules work.”
He surrendered.  There was no point in arguing, not right now – not with Steve buried inside him, Steve’s hand on his cock.  Tony ignored the emotions and just let arousal swamp him.
Tony’s grin was fond and mischievous.  “I like the way you think, Rogers.”  He traced his finger in a symbol on Steve’s chest.  “Still thinking about a ring then?”
“I’m so close, baby,” Tony breathed.  “Are you close?  Look at me, Steve – I want to see your face.”
Now naked, Tony grinned up at Steve.  “I think since you’re so concerned that I’m tired, you should work yourself open… and then do all the work by riding me.”
The breath caught in Tony’s chest, and he stared up at Steve like he’d never seen him before.  “I love you too,” he breathed.  “I might not say it often because it’s hard but – ”
“I’ll say.”  Tony nuzzled his cheek, carefully rocking his hips where they were still joined.  Steve sucked in a surprised breath.  “You want to go again?”
Tony moved and Steve thought maybe he’d gotten through to him – but the movement proved to be Tony dropping to his knees and beginning to fumble with Steve’s pants.  “Just need – I promise it’ll be good, baby, I’ve just got to have you right now.”
They rocked together a moment or two longer, Steve’s motions growing slower and smaller as his breath calmed.  He leaned down, resting some of his weight on Tony, and kissed him.  Tony stroked the blond hair back from his forehead.  “You didn’t come,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s neck.
“I’m sorry.”  Tony would have pulled away, but Steve was holding him too tightly for that.  “I shouldn’t have asked you to come—”
That leisurely pace couldn’t last forever.  Steve was swearing and begging, thrusting back against him.  Tony didn’t have it in him to resist that kind of lure.  He snaked a hand beneath Steve to reach the supersoldier’s cock and wrapped his hand around it, pumping it in time to his own thrusts.  Scant minutes later, Steve was coming in his hand.  The resulting muscle contractions around Tony’s cock proved too much for him, and he spilled into Steve, gasping.
All rational thought bled out of Tony.  Steve wasn’t wearing any of the various shades of blue that most people dressed him in – not tonight.  This suit was in a deep red, with very subtle gold pinstriping.  “Oh.  My.”  Tony looked down at his own suit – realizing now why his tailor had insisted he wear blue tonight.  “They – we’re wearing – you’re in my colors, baby.”
And God, that question stung.  Steve knew if he said it – knew if he was honest about what he wanted and needed right now – Tony would be out the door in a heartbeat.  The man didn’t do emotions, and Steve knew that.  But Steve was worn raw right now.  He’d had the worst flashback since defrosting when Clint dropped out of his reach – it had been almost identical to Bucky’s fall, and Steve couldn’t deal.  Even knowing Clint was safe, he felt worn thin.
He yelped as Steve pulled out and rolled him onto his back, flat on the debris-strewn ground.  Tony looked up to see Steve -- in almost full uniform save for belt, gloves, and with his pants open -- looming over him.  "You are good, Tony," Steve repeated more quietly.  He slid between Tony's legs and eased his cock back into Tony's hole -- this time gently, and somehow the gentleness hurt.  "So good."
“I like that.  I can get behind that.”  Tony leaned forward to kiss Steve, a surprisingly tender kiss that lasted for several minutes.  “Do you follow your golden rule too?”
“You know it.”  Steve bit down on the nipple in his mouth, grinning when Tony let out an inarticulate moan.  “But you know what?”  He paused like he was waiting for an answer, but given he didn’t still his fingers, Steve was surprised that Tony couldn’t manage to string together a response.  “I’m your fuckin’ troll.”
“No, doll,” Steve hurried to interrupt.  “That’s not – I didn’t mean to say I don’t like bein’ here with you.  I like holdin’ you against me.”  His voice thickened with Brooklyn.
Tony ran a hand down Steve’s side, pausing to run a finger along the defined ridges of his abs.  “I’ll let you know as I decide.”  He tapped Steve’s hip.  “Lay down, hot shot.”  Steve did so, unable to contain a shiver of anticipation.  Tony stretched out next to him on his side, arc reactor pressed into Steve’s ribcage, his hand moving to slowly stroke Steve’s cock.  “What the hell were you doing in the shop?”
“Love the way you touch me,” Steve murmured.  He feathered his fingers through Tony’s hair, forcing himself not to thrust against those lovely lips.  “Make me crazy, babydoll.  Never get enough of you.”  In answer, Tony took the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth and sucked, hard.  “Oh, fuck,” Steve gasped, his fingers briefly tightening in Tony’s hair.  “God, you’re so good to me.  So pretty down there…”
Steve rose and padded on bare feet to stand behind Tony, wrapping his arms around the smaller man.  “I’ll give you two privacy if you want it, but I’m not leaving.”  He kissed the side of Tony’s neck.  “This is at least partly my fault, I’m not going to leave you to take all the blame.”  He reached into the drawer and pulled out one of his replica SSR shirts, handing it to Tony.  “I’m pretty sure bailing on you now violates the partner code of conduct at the very least – and probably the friend one, too.”
“I like this plan.”  Steve kissed Tony’s abdomen one more time before pulling away, moving to the nightstand to dig for lube.  Half a moment later he’d returned with slick fingers, carefully easing two into Tony.
“Pepper had the first one put in a display case, labeled ‘Proof that Tony Stark Has a Heart.’  Never was sure if it was meant to be sweet or sarcastic.”
Mindful of his request for rough, Tony worked the fingers mercilessly.  Steve was writhing again, caught between two exquisite pleasures – that fucking velvet mouth, and those incredibly talented digits.
“They can wait.  I need to ravish this man right now.”  Tony pulled on Steve’s ridiculous Iron Man t-shirt, tugging him closer.
“Mmmhmm.”  Tony paused with his mouth hovering over Steve’s cock.  “You got a problem with that, soldier?  You wanted rough…”
Tony grinned in triumph.  He wasn’t working at the best angle, but apparently he’d hit the mark.  Victorious, he gently massaged Steve’s prostate as his other hand worked rhythmically up and down Steve’s frankly beautiful cock.  “It was your shoulders, for me,” he admitted.  Tony leaned in to kiss Steve deeply.  “I’d watch you in the gym, and see those broad muscles – God bless America.”
“Hey, it’s been seventy years since I got to whisper ‘I love you’s into somebody’s skin,” Steve told him, carefully working his index finger into Tony.  “Allow me some romance.”
Steve unwound one hand from the fabric and slid it into Tony’s hair.  He feathered his fingers through the silky strands.  “Feels good, doll.”
Guilt flooded Tony.  “I’m sorry.”  He ran his fingers through the hair at the nape of Steve’s neck.  “I didn’t fly in there just to be a cowboy or a hero… and I didn’t argue with you just to be a jackass.”  He paused.  “Well.  When we got in here, I was arguing mostly to be a jackass.”
It amused and touched Tony that Steve insisted on paying for dinner.  It seemed to amuse their server as well.  To thank the man for his discreet service, Steve tipped him cash – and added a little doodle with an autograph on a napkin.  If Tony hadn’t already loved him, that might have pushed him over the edge – the sheer goodness of Steve Rogers was too much for him to resist.
“Not gonna pretend otherwise.”  Steve grinned against Tony’s lips, then hoisted the smaller man up into the air, guiding his legs around him.  “Did you really want to top, or were you just pullin’ my leg?”
"Want to see me bend Hawkeye over a table... he's so flexible, I bet he can do acrobatics in bed, yeah?  Maybe find out if Thor is really that big all over?"  Steve's breath was hot on the back of Tony's neck.  "Find out if Bruce really does Hulk out during sex... maybe find out if I could take him."
“That’s a good rule.”  Steve kissed him again.  “I like that rule.  Can I suggest one too?” Tony nodded.  “Open.  As in, not a secret.  We don’t have to make an announcement or anything,” he added when Tony’s eyes flickered away, “but I don’t want to lie about us, either.”  Tony didn’t answer right away.  “Yes, I’m sure.”  He pulled at Tony’s hand until the engineer rolled again so that his back was to Steve, and the supersoldier gathered him into his arms spoon-fashion.  Neither of them mentioned that it would probably have been smarter to clean off – they needed the touch too much.
“Stop thinking,” Steve whispered in his ear, driving in for another thrust.  “Just let me make you feel good, doll.”
“You are.”  Tony silenced him with a gentle kiss on his lips.  “Okay?  You are.  If you want to be.  Just not that word, okay?  I’ve done that word.  It doesn’t end well.”
“You’ve been listening to Darcy’s feminist rants again, haven’t you?” Tony asked weakly, shooting for humor.
“Nothing, yet everything,” Steve murmured.  “Feels different to me too, love.”  He kissed the base of Tony’s cock, started to kiss up the length as his fingers gently worked Tony open.
Returning the kisses, Tony shifted his free hand between them to Steve’s cock, lightly stroking.  He didn’t think it would take much – Steve was already making the soft panting noises that heralded his orgasm.  For that matter, Tony wasn’t going to last long either – he’d had his hands all over ever inch of Steve’s body, and that would push anybody close to the edge.
"A closer look, sure."  Steve stepped closer to Tony, still in his uniform.  "Maybe you'll give me a lift over there?"
“Yep.”  Tony leaned into Steve’s chest.  “Agent cleaned up in the betting pool, apparently.  Natasha thinks we’re adorable.”
Once inside the room, Tony started to tug at his undersuit.  “Off with the clothes, Cap.  Can’t discipline you proper in your pajamas.  And who picked those out, you look ridiculous.”  He looked delicious, but Tony couldn’t say that.  That would break more rules than just fucking off the field.
“You’re such a sap.”  Tony looked up at him, his cheeks coloring.  Willfully ignoring the cameras, he tilted his head at Steve, an inquiring look in his eyes.
Steve lightly licked along the scar tissue.  “I don’t need that as proof.  You show me a thousand ways a day how much heart you have.”  He kissed across to Tony’s nipple, nibbling gently.
“God, I hate anxiety attacks,” Tony groaned, pressing his forehead against Steve’s shoulder in the elevator.  “I feel like I’ve got a hangover, and I didn’t even get to drink to earn it.”
“Not about that!” Steve snapped, looking up at Tony’s eyes.  “I didn’t – damn it.”  He buried his face in his hands.  “I just said something lame about respecting you.”
The blond added a third finger, moaning a little when Tony bore down on them.  “I’m ready, Jesus,”  Tony gasped.  “God, Rogers, just fuck me already.”
“Only to me, baby.”  JARVIS, bless him, had already started the tub.  They only had to wait a few minutes for the water to be deep enough to climb in.  At Tony’s gesture, Steve sat down in the tub first, and Tony nestled in between his legs, leaning back against his chest.  As soon as they were situated, Tony let out a long sigh.  “This is good.”
Pinning Tony’s hips down with his left hand, Steve used the right to slip lower, beneath his balls, and press the pad of his index finger to his hole.  He pulled his mouth off long enough to curse.  “Damn, why do I never think to grab the lube first?”
“Hey, soldier,” Tony said from a safe six feet away.  “You gonna bang on that bag all night, or can I interest you in a suitable substitute?”
“Obviously.”  Steve sucked lightly at his earlobe.  “Know some AC/DC too, although I always thought ‘Thunderstruck’ suited Thor better.”  He added a peculiar little twist to the end of a thrust, drawing another moan from Tony.  “Maybe more appropriate tonight…” he hummed ‘You Shook Me All Night Long.’
Tony would never admit to worrying that their off-field behavior would change things.  That was another thing they didn’t talk about – well.  Really both the fear, and the behavior.  But when it came time for him to seek Steve out, he found the fear really didn’t matter.
That made Steve laugh – a laugh cut off as Tony rubbed his thumb along the sensitive head.  “Shit, I’m right there, Tony – just – ”
“What?  What’s wrong?  Tony?”  Alarmed, Steve sat up and tugged Tony into his arms.  “Babydoll, talk to me.”
Knowing that he’d fucked up so monumentally as to let his two oldest friends find out about his relationship with Steve via media blitz rather than from himself… that was a lot harder to deal with.  And it was definitely ruining the afterglow from what had been a pretty nice after-date sex romp.
“Tony.”  Steve lifted his hands to hold Tony’s where they were tying his tie.  “I could not care less what the press or the public say about us.  I want to take my partner out and show him a good time – then I’m hoping he’ll let me bring him home, invite him up for a night cap and a roll in the hay.”
“Yes, Captain.”  There was a pause.  “She has left her office; I believe she is headed to speak with Sir.”
“There you go, getting Brooklyn on me again.”  Tony shifted in his seat, but didn’t move away from Steve’s foot.
Tony wasn’t sure if the crazy part was because Steve wouldn’t settle down and stop moving or because he hadn’t changed out of his uniform yet, and his ass looked amazing.
Satisfied with that answer, Steve bent to his task with the same focus he used on the battlefield.  Every inch of Tony’s crotch was kissed and licked.  To Tony’s surprise and Steve’s evident delight, the engineer’s cock began to respond.  “Told you,” Steve smirked as he mouthed the swelling member.
It was good – great, even – but it wasn’t precisely what Steve wanted right now… and the mood felt too tenuous for him to outright ask.  Tony being a genius, though… he caught Steve’s slight shift.
“I think we’ve established I’m making poor choices tonight,” Steve said wryly, looking up at the punching bag.  “If we go with my methods, you’d be strung up next to the bag.”
For as often as they did this, it always amused and touched Tony that Steve could be so hesitant, and so careful.  “Yeah, baby.  That’s okay,” Tony whispered, reaching up to stroke Steve’s face.  “God, I love you.”
Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony, who waved a hand in agreement.  “Sixteen – well, I guess it’s seventeen days now.”  His expression softened, and he lifted their clasped hands to his lips to kiss the back of Tony’s knuckles.
Steve laughed.  “Yeah, okay.  God, why am I arguing when the most beautiful man I know has my cock in his hand?”  Steve lifted a dripping hand to cup Tony’s cheek.  “I love you.”
He wanted to argue the point, but it was difficult to keep his thoughts in order enough for that with Steve’s tongue on him.  Tony gasped as Steve added a hand to his other nipple, lightly rolling it between thumb and forefinger.
Steve looked over at him incredulously as he flopped bonelessly onto his back next to Tony.  “You’re really gonna—”
Carefully, Tony slid an arm around Steve’s waist.  “You do respect me, sugar.”  The endearment slipped out without his permission, but he let it stand.  He called Rhodey all manner of such things, surely this could be overlooked.
“Now who’s being a sap?”  Steve stood between Tony’s knees, his hands coming to rest on the engineer’s shoulders.
It was kind of relaxing – these were their typical pairs.  Bruce didn’t have as much difficulty fighting Thor – he knew that if he accidentally hulked out, Thor could restrain Hulk long enough for tranquilizers to be administered.  Nat and Clint had trained together for so long that it was more dancing than fighting.  And Steve had always enjoyed sparring with Tony… both for the delicious visuals of a sweaty body and the witty banter that accompanied it.
“Probably.”  Tony nibbled at Steve’s pulse points, down the length of his neck to his collarbone.  “Once you get up the balls to ask for what you want.”
And God, Steve wanted it to be real.  Almost too much – almost enough to call this off, because the idea that this was… some kind of game… it hurt.  He couldn’t, though.  He would take what he could get – and greedily.
“Very.”  Steve pulled Tony back against him, nuzzling into his neck.  “Now we need a shower, though.”  He slid his hand down Tony’s torso, but his hand was stopped before it reached Tony’s crotch.
“I know this is going to come as a surprise, but I don’t actually expect sex from you all the time,” Steve said, kissing his neck again.  “I just like to touch you.  Do you want me to stop?”
Tony set the teapot down so hard he was afraid it would shatter.  “He is not some trophy to be won!”  He whirled on her, eyes blazing.  “Damn it, Pepper.  I’m not fucking playing at romance, I fucking fell in love.  I didn’t mean to, didn’t expect it – I already had him in bed, thank you very much.  But in addition to being the hottest person I’ve ever slept with, he’s… he’s so good, Pepper.”  Tony’s face softened, almost entreating.  “He’s… he’s amazing, and I didn’t intend to fall for him and I did… and he… he loves me too.”
Tony pressed back into him, reaching to pull Steve’s arm tight around him.  “Rule three… being partners doesn’t… it doesn’t replace being teammates and friends.  Just… adds to it.”  He paused.  “Right?”
“Hard to object to a request like that.”  Steve pulled his fingers free with a final kiss to Tony’s cock.  He poured more lube and smoothed it on, groaning a little.  “I don’t know how much staying power I’ve got right now.”
Tony slid both hands around Steve, pressing against him.  “Holy hell, I had no idea…” he trailed off, moving to kiss Steve’s neck.  “God, it’s so stupid that it matters, it shouldn’t matter, but – God, dressed in this, baby – you look like you’re mine.”
That was a fair point – Steve knew Tony would never push him past that limit.  Maybe he’d been right about the denial.  He found himself leaning back into the smaller body behind him, tipping his head back to rest against Tony’s.
Steve groaned and his cock twitched.  Few things got him hotter than Tony being overtly loving – it was silly and romantic and if he said it aloud, his partner would scoff.  “I’m open enough, please,” he said instead, panting against Tony’s shoulder.  “Just go slow, it’ll be fine.”
It was that simple gesture – not the kissing and touching and declarations – it was Steve’s hand on the arc reactor that triggered realization in Pepper.
They were quiet in the car – and though there was arousal simmering between them, it wasn’t the fierce need that would have made them act in the car.  (Happy appreciated that.)  Steve lifted their clasped hands to his lips and presses along Tony’s fingers, but that was as far as they took it… until they arrived back in the penthouse.
“Yeah,” Tony sighed, rocking back against him.  “Yours, baby.  God, you feel so good.”  He caught his breath as Steve bottomed out.  “Take me, baby.  Show me who I belong to.”
"I got you, Tony."  Steve's hand worked his cock just as thoroughly as Steve's cock was working Tony's ass... and he just couldn't hold on any longer.  Tony felt the orgasm rising up from the ground, swamping him more thoroughly than any enemy they'd fought.  His body bucked and writhed under Steve's, but Steve never stopped.  Tony cried out at least once -- he couldn't remember which noises were in his head and which came out his mouth -- as he painted the reflective star of Steve's uniform with his own stripes.
“Are we… um… going to give one ourselves?” Tony asked, flicking his eyes at Steve as they headed to their seats… front row seats.
The first touch, the slow slide – it made Tony whimper and arch up against him.  Steve’s hand released his cock and instead moved to hold Tony’s hips still.  “God, please,” Tony whined.
Tony had quietly invited Steve to move into the penthouse with him, and Steve had accepted.  It didn’t take long for all his belongings to be fitted in among Tony’s, looking like they’d always belonged there.  Tony had given him an entire closet and then proceeded to fill it with new suits and expensive, fashionable clothes – until Steve laughingly forbade it, threatening to create rule six to prevent excessive spending.  (He still wore the ridiculous t-shirts and pajamas that other people picked out for him, to see their pleased expressions.)
“We’ll get there too, I promise,” Tony whispered.  “But I’m not done yet.”  He stood up fluidly and began to tug at Steve’s uniform.  “I want you the rest of the way naked… and lie down, okay?”  Then he stepped into the bathroom, thoroughly confusing Steve.
Steve, now safely covered in his shirt, slipped his arm around Tony’s waist.  “That’s my fault, Colonel Rhodes.  Jim,” he corrected himself.
“I do – and you know I’m a genius.  I’m right.”  Tony smiled – with more sweetness than the quip implied.  He shifted his attention back to Steve’s chest, kissing and licking.
Steve was writhing under his touches, trying not to buck too hard.  “You gonna – Jesus, Tony – you gonna use your teeth on me there too?”
Pepper wanted to ask.  God, she wanted to know about whatever relationship Steve had been in before that gave him the easy confidence to make that statement – but one glance at Tony told her not to push.  “So, you have the team’s support?”  That stung too – that the teammates he’d so recently befriended had known before she did.
Tony made a soft, sad noise.  “It was implied.”  He twisted on the stool so that he could reach up and cup a hand around Steve’s cheek.  “You got pretty Brooklyn there, sweetheart.”
“Really?”  Tony raised an eyebrow, rubbing his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock as he carefully worked one finger into his hole.  Under water it wasn’t easy to do… and for some reason they hadn’t invested in waterproof lube yet.  Tony didn’t worry too much about it though – he wasn’t going to use more than a finger.  He just wanted to be able to find Steve’s prostate.
"Nope."  Tony made quick work of it, and in ten minutes they were standing by the Iron Man suit again, looking... well, not normal, but not like they'd just fucked each other's brains out, either.  "Tower or SHIELD?" Tony asked, his hand on the suit to climb back in."
Chuckling, Tony stroked the small of his back lightly.  “You’re not in charge right now, Cap.”  Steve groaned beneath him, and Tony gave in – a little.  He sped up his pace some, though it was still slower than Steve wanted.
“I don’t care.”  Steve’s jaw was set.  “You’re the best thing to happen to me in this century, doll – and I’m not backin’ down just because some bullies think it’s wrong.”
“Do you think I don’t know that?”  Tony shook his head.  “He says – he says it doesn’t matter.  That I’m…”
"They're all so -- fucking hell, Steve, right there -- God, they're all so damned pretty."  Tony was starting to sweat, and his legs were trembling.
“Not gonna really hit you, baby,” Tony warned, but he brought his hand down again – more noise and sting than anything, the kind of slap he’d do on the bare shoulder of a teammate.
The supersoldier pulled his fingers free.  "You're only up to nine thrusts... you really think you can hold out the whole time?  By my count that's twenty-seven left."  He pulled his cock free from his uniform but didn't undress -- he knew the rough fabric rubbing against Tony's ass was an added level of arousal.
Entering the gym, Tony had to appreciate the view Steve presented.  Grey sweat pants that clung to a trim waist, slid over a delicious ass and powerful thighs.  Sweat-soaked white t-shirt always purchased just a little too small (God bless JARVIS) to hug those obscenely broad shoulders, cup the well-developed pecs.  And God, those abs – Tony wanted to run his tongue over them like right now.
Tony blew a raspberry.  “Bullshit.  I like making you feel good.”  He twisted so that he could face Steve, their legs tangling together in the bathwater.  “This is a case where you should learn to just accept what I give you gracefully.”  He reached for Steve’s cock, bobbing in the water.
The fight was over in a flash – literally.  A flash and a shockwave, emanating from an explosion of a very large robot control mechanism that Iron Man had very nearly been flattened in.  He wasn’t – thankfully – but the suit had taken some hits.
Smirking, Steve nipped at his ear.  “Should I sing my theme song to you, then?”  He hummed a few bars of the ‘Star Spangled Man.’
Steve grinned in satisfaction.  “Love to make you beg,” he murmured, swiftly kissing Tony on the lips before adding lube to his cock and settling between Tony’s legs.  “This what you want, doll?”  He teased the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
Tony latched one arm around Steve’s waist and held a coffee cup in the other.  It held the dual purpose of making it very clear that he was there as part of a couple, and it prevented people from shaking his hand.  It also was a good way to gauge Steve’s state of mind throughout the evening… which wasn’t positive.
“Mmmmhmmm.”  Steve’s breath caught.  He leaned up on one arm, reaching between them for Tony’s cock.  It was rock hard and leaking.  Steve rubbed his thumb over the damp head.  “Come for me, babydoll.  I want to feel you come on my cock.”
"So good," Steve repeated, thrusting into Tony again.  He slipped a hand between them and found Tony's cock, grasping it and smoothing his thumb over the head.  "A body made for sex, a mind made for genius, and a heart... God, that heart."  Steve dropped his head to nibble at Tony's neck, alternative between sharp nips and sweet kisses.
Reaching Tony’s cock, Steve started to lick the entire area – thoroughly.  It was halfway amusing, kind of like being bathed by a jungle cat.  On the other hand… damn, he was good with that tongue, and so fucking pretty looking up through those blond lashes.  “Doing okay?” Steve asked, pausing his licking.
Not one to let such a plea go unanswered, Tony positioned himself at Steve’s entrance and pushed in.  “You’re still so fucking tight,” Tony moaned, bottoming out and holding himself there.  “God, Steve.”  He lowered himself down onto Steve’s chest, seeking out his lips and exchanging a messy, desperate kiss.
Steve stepped out of his closet, tie in his hand.  He met Tony’s eyes in the mirror.  “We don’t have to do this.”  He kept his voice level, not betraying any emotion.
Steve had no idea what he was even asking for – just trusting Tony to know, and to give it to him.  “Just… just… please.”
“Just – go away, Steve,” Tony sighed as the Iron Man suit disassembled.  He was tired to his marrow, exhausted in a way he hadn’t felt in years.  He wanted a drink – a lot of drinks.  No matter how delicious Steve looked in plaid pajama pants and a tight t-shirt, Tony wasn’t in the mood to talk.  (And who the fuck managed to look good in plaid pajama lounge pants?  It wasn’t fair.)
Steve whined again.  Tony obliged by switching to suckling kisses, adding a quick lick of tongue occasionally.  A few minutes of that and the whining had turned almost desperate, and was accompanied by muscle twitches in Steve’s thighs.  Grinning, Tony patted the bed with one hand, searching for the lube.  Steve found it first and handed it to him.  Tony slicked up his fingers and used one – just one – to ease into Steve.
“I think Nat ordered them,” Steve said, shucking out of pants, boxers, and shirt.  “Might have been Darcy.  I don’t ask.  Clothes turn up in my room, and the women of the Tower smile at me when I wear them.”
Steve couldn’t maintain the slow pace forever, not with Tony making those gorgeous noises beneath him.  His breath caught on a particularly sharp thrust, feeling Tony shudder around him.  Steve shifted again, wrapping his hand around Tony’s cock.  He was hard and leaking precum.
“Yeah.”  Steve pulled him closer, kissing him messily.  He was losing what control he had in the face of relentless tenderness, unable to continue to be stoic when basking in Tony’s warmth.  “God, you feel so good.”  He rolled his hips, taking Tony even deeper.
The screen flared to life, and the first thing they saw was themselves.  “Oh.”  Tony’s eyes went wide as he read the caption beneath the photo.  “Gay Avengers – A May-December Romance for Iron Man and Captain America.  Who do you suppose counts as older?  I’ve got more experience, but you’ve got a bigger candle count.”
Steve lifted an eyebrow at Tony, who shrugged his assent.  “We’d be delighted.”  He tucked Tony’s hand in his and gestured for the woman to lead them backstage.
“That ain’t a no, is it beautiful?”  Steve’s hips slammed into him as he groaned.  “I’m close, babydoll – are you?”
Tony tried not to let the praise go to his head but… well, who was he kidding.  “They don’t call me a playboy for nothing.”  He trailed his fingers along Steve’s abs.  “I’m guessing from how you liked my fingers that you wouldn’t object to taking a ride.”
Partway through dessert, Steve rose to visit the men’s room.  As he passed Tony, he leaned down to whisper, “If you’re so inclined… follow me in a few minutes.”
Tony tilted his head up for a kiss, which Steve gave him.  “Thank you, sweetheart.”  He knew Steve would be able to hear the conversation from the guest bedroom they were converting into his art studio – supersoldier hearing would ensure that.  (Although if it hadn’t, JARVIS probably would have piped the audio in for him.)  He appreciated the illusion of privacy, at least.  “Draw me like one of your French girls?”
Steve brought his hand down to the back of Tony’s head – not controlling, just holding.  “Your knees—”
But he didn’t pull away – Tony counted that as a victory.  “Okay, maybe you’re just in denial.”  Tony teased the fingers of his right hand under the waistband.  “I can work with that.”
“No,” Tony agreed easily.  He pressed a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck.  “Usually doesn’t hurt, though.”  Steve continued to assault the bag, and Tony moved with him.  His left hand shifted slightly until he was teasing Steve’s nipple to hardness through his damp t-shirt.  The right moved lower, finding the stirrings of arousal already building in Steve’s cock.
Abandoning the massage oil for now, Tony straddled Steve’s ankles and started to knead his thighs through the towel.  The combination of heat and pressure made Steve groan.  He hadn’t realized how tight he’d gotten, the results of several hours of fighting followed by more of tension.  Tony apparently had.
Desire shot through Tony, almost robbing him of breath.  “What do you say we get out of here, soldier?”
“Fuck, no.  Bring it on, Iron Man.”  Steve was watching him with… something… in his eyes that Tony didn’t want to identify.
Moaning, Tony nodded.  “Yeah – yeah, okay.”  As he ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, he had to wonder – whose skin?  But those thoughts fluttered out his brain when Steve added a second finger.  “God, it shouldn’t feel this much different, should it?  Nothing’s changed, right?”
Steve detested these private briefings with Fury – a bi-weekly ‘discussion’ of Avengers missions, personnel, and expectations that always left a bad taste in his mouth.
Steve ran a hand down Tony's ass, then spread it wide with both hands.  "Don't worry, Tony... I'm the man with a plan."  Tony groaned at the line -- and then groaned again, because Steve had knelt behind him and was pressing his tongue flat against Tony's asshole.
“I think you crushed on Captain America as a kid, and now that you’ve got a chance at the real thing, you’ll do whatever it takes to bag him as a trophy.”  Pepper’s eyes narrowed on him, irritated that he wouldn’t meet her gaze.  “I think you’re playing at romance because that’s what it takes to get a man like him in bed.”
“Now who’s being a romantic sap?” Steve teased, sliding his hands up Tony’s sides and catching the hem of his shirt.
“Love you too, Princess Elsa,” Tony murmured.  He shoved lightly until Steve laid down on the mat, throwing a leg over him to straddle him.  “Want you to fuck me.”
Steve chuckled.  "Think you can stand that many?"  He lifted the hem of Tony's undershirt to slide his hand up his back.  God, he loved that broad expanse -- even littered as it was with small scars.  "Want to find out?"
Steve got to his feet, immediately crowding close to Tony again.  “Sometimes I like the risk… sometimes I’d rather just concentrate on you.”  He tilted his head, catching Tony’s lips in a long, slow kiss.  “I don’t want battlefield fucking right now, doll.  I want to make love to you.”
Already, Steve’s breathing was fast and headed towards thready.  Tony didn’t bother to slow down.  With his serum enhanced refractory period, it wasn’t unusual for Steve to hit three orgasms for every one of Tony’s.
Tony debated pushing – but something in Steve’s eyes suggested that wouldn’t end well.  Alright.  Tony could roll with that.  He leaned over and caught Steve in a kiss.  He kept it gentle, no matter how horny he’d gotten given the supersoldier a very thorough massage.  This wasn’t about a quick bang – Steve needed to be taken care of tonight.  It had been awhile since Tony tried – and he’d never done it for a man – but he figured it wasn’t much different than pampering Pepper had been.  (Except Tony wasn’t likely to get told tomorrow that he needed to take a refresher course, or that he’d been ‘acceptable.’)  “Alright.  Just… try to relax for me, okay?”  Steve nodded, and Tony kissed him again in reward.
Tony laughed.  “I didn’t want you to be.”  He stroked the long planes of Steve’s back, feeling the hot welts he’d left earlier – already healing.  “I’m not too sore for more.  It’s easier for me to hold off coming when you go hard – and I wanted to make it to round two.”  He pressed his cheek against Steve’s.  “Whether round two is more of this or trading places is up to you.”
“You, Steven Grant Rogers, are a fucking troll.”  Tony tried to sound irritated and missed the mark entirely.
Steve watched him, his eyes full of things he’d never named.  He wanted… well, he wanted more.  He’d take what he could get.
“Hey, Spangles,” the man in question said from the doorway – a little warily.  “Steve, you’re about to crush that pan in your hand.”
“No, I’m okay, honestly.”  Tony wiped at his eyes.  “Those were good tears.  Also tears of relief, because Pepper just left and she was… well, she was pissed.”  Tony looked down.  “I didn’t mean to leave you guys out, I just… got caught up.”
“Is that a hint you want more sucking?”  Steve’s lips curved against him.  “Should I mark you up, babydoll?  Make it so everybody can see you’re mine?”  He nipped a little further down, across Tony’s shoulder blade.  “Map a constellation of kisses across you?”
Tony knew better than to argue that point.  “I’ve got a history, and it’s not… well.”  Tony looked away.  “You’ve seen what people think of me.  Fury’s not the only one who doesn’t respect me.”
He might once have protested against being manhandled like this, but Tony loved the way Steve could move him.  “It’s mutual,” Tony whispered up at Steve.  “You’ve got me, too.”
Steve smiled and pressed their lips together.  “You love me,” he whispered against Tony’s lips.  “Sap and all.”
And fucking hell, Tony realized what he was feeling.  He completely was not prepared for it, and totally not okay – but it was really hard to argue with it.  Goddamn it, he was falling for Captain Steven Grant Rogers, and that was unacceptable.
“I’ll deal with you in a minute, Captain.  Tony…” Rhodey’s voice was firm.  “Do I need to have a chat with Pepper?”
“Trust me, Steve-o.  By the time you’re reaching for the fourth one, you’ll be cursing.”  Tony reached up to stroke Steve’s nipples, feeling Steve shiver at the touch.  “Got any special requests?  Beyond rough?”
“I live to serve,” Steve mumbled, canting his hips forward to meet Tony’s.  He was already hard, tenting the plaid fabric.  “Will you –”
Tony eyed him with a smirk.  “Oh, such a loaded question.”  He sat up, ignoring the vague pull of muscles.  Tony watched Steve for several minutes, running through different positions and combinations in his head.  It had the added benefit of making Steve squirm in anticipation.  “We’ll start with you kneeling at the edge of the bed.”  Tony stood up and stretched, watching as Steve obeyed.  “There you go.”  Tony caressed the curve of Steve’s very lovely ass.  “Comfy?”
In answer, Tony latched his ankles around Steve’s hips and pulled.  They both groaned as Steve’s cock pushed in – but Tony didn’t wait.  He tightened his thighs, forcing them closer together and panting.  Steve could take a hint, and leaned in until he was fully seated inside Tony.  “More,” Tony breathed, his hands scrabbling at Steve’s back.  “Fast and hard, baby, please.”
Tony tipped his head to one side to give Steve better access.  “If you’re asking if I’m bored, the answer is no.”  He curled his hand around the back of Steve’s neck, lightly stroking.  “Would I like to try some of that stuff with you sometime?  Maybe.  But I don’t need it, love.”  Tony smoothed his other hand down Steve’s back, pulling him in close.  “All the kink in the world can’t compare to being loved by you.”
“I didn’t actually think it could get hotter,” Tony remarked eventually.  “The sex.  I didn’t realize – ”
“God, I love it when you get Brooklyn,” Tony murmured.  “You need a word, huh?”  Steve nodded, and Tony lifted a hand to lightly stroke his cheek.  “I’m partial to partner myself, but lover works too.”
Pepper looked between them, her brain working quickly.  “I’ll call in the morning.”  She leaned over and kissed Tony’s cheek.  “Will that be all, Mister Stark?”
“You have me,” Steve murmured.  He pressed another kiss to Tony’s lips, deciding that was a sufficient answer.  He stood smoothly, then lifted Tony into his arms to resituate him on the bed.  Gently he placed the smaller man in the middle of the massive mattress and straddled him, bending down to kiss him again.
“No.”  Steve put his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close.  “Not more than this.  I’m not gonna do that to the actors… they deserve to be the stars tonight.”
Steve grinned and swung Tony into his arms, bridal style.  “Is that so?”  He carried the laughing engineer to the bed.  “I expect I can manage that much.  What, no requests for exotic positions or expensive toys?”  He laid Tony on the bed, running a hand down his torso to graze his cock.
Naked now save for his socks and boots, Steve seized Tony around the waist and lifted him, pressing his back against the closed door.  Tony immediately wrapped his legs around Steve.  “Can you handle it a little rough?” Steve asked.  He’d retrieved a bottle of lube from his tactical belt, slicking up his fingers and already searching for Tony’s hole.
And damn it, he knew she was going to play that card.  Tony sighed.  “One writer and one photographer only, and I want to read it before it goes to print.”
“Only in my nightmares.”  Steve tucked the soiled cloths away in a pocket and pulled Tony in for a kiss.  “It’s not fair that you look perfect again so fast.”
“It’s okay.  It’s… he’s got reason to ask, baby.”  Tony looked down at their joined hands.  “It’s the first time we’re sparred since – becoming more.  I didn’t… it just clicked all of a sudden that I was hitting my partner, my lover.  And I… have issues with that.”  He looked up, met Bruce’s eyes.  “I know you do, too.  That’s… I promise, Bruce, Steve didn’t do anything to prompt me freaking out.”
“Just a few more minutes, I promise.”  At least one of those was spent on Steve pulling himself back together.  He could be the dancing monkey for Tony while the engineer was doing his ridiculous penance to Pepper – not that Steve agreed with the punishment, but he knew better than to interfere.  This was the CEO punishing the CTO for not warning the PR department, he figured… not an ex punishing the current lover.
Steve hummed in appreciation.  “Look at you, so eager for me.”  He curled inward, kissing soft skin on the inside of Tony’s hip.  “Like you were made to open up to me.”  He crooked his fingers, grinning when Tony let out a sharp cry and bucked against him.  “You’re always beautiful, babydoll – but coming apart for me like this, you’re fucking transcendent.”
“Baby, if you suck me again I’m – ” Tony caught his breath as Steve’s tongue flickered in his navel.  “Please, I want to come with you inside me, please.”
Ice dripped down Steve’s spine.  His jaw clenched and he rose from the table.  He wouldn’t be explaining the odd form of discipline they’d stumbled upon – the not-relationship between himself and Tony that they didn’t talk about but that somehow gave them both balance.  He couldn’t let the open criticism nigh derision of his teammate stand, though.  “Try respect,” he ground out.  “Amazing what mutual respect can do in the field.  You might try it, now and then.”
When the aftershocks eased, Tony released Steve’s cock from his mouth and gently pulled his fingers out.  He sat back on his heels on the bed, watching the blond regain his breath.
Tony beat him there by scant seconds, his body tightening around Steve’s cock as his own spurted between them.  The sensation pushed Steve over the edge and he spilled into Tony, filling the absolutely maddening man with his seed.
“I don’t need any more incentive to – take care of you, baby.”  Tony dropped a kiss to the inside of Steve’s knee.  He’d almost said a forbidden word there, quickly stifled.  In deference to the tender tone he’d taken thus far, he worked Steve open slowly – all the way to four fingers.  By that point, the supersoldier was rocking against him, whimpering.
“Tony, babydoll,” Steve said from his closet – because of course, Tony had given him a closet in the penthouse – “relax.  This is supposed to be fun.”  He selected a different button-down shirt and started rummaging for a tie.  His wardrobe had gotten sharper since he’d agreed to let Tony pick out the majority of his clothes… though he still wore weird tees and pajamas that other people purchased.
Steve laughed, low in his throat, and slid one hand down to join his tongue.  Carefully, he worked a finger into Tony... pressing firmly, twisting it just right.  Just like he knew Tony liked.  Tony was whimpering now, almost to the point of begging.  Steve grinned and placed an extra kiss to the tender skin as he added a second finger.  He crooked the two towards him.
They were late, but not so late that they earned more than an eyeroll from Pepper.  Tony took it in stride.  She’d have been shocked into catatonia if they’d managed to be on time.
“No, of course not.”  Tony wiggled experimentally.  Yeah, he’d be sore – but the good kind of sore, he thought.  “You okay?”
Tony pulled away, lapping up any spilled fluid as he went.  The problem with deep throating, in his opinion, was the lack of cum to taste.  No matter… there were always second helpings.
Steve pulled away from Tony long enough to turn to face him, wrapping one arm around Tony’s waist and settling the other at the back of his neck.  He didn’t want to talk about the mission – didn’t want to think about the wounded or the dead.  He’d wanted to lose himself in physical activity with the punching bag but… perhaps Tony was right, and a different distraction would serve as well.  He slotted his leg between Tony’s and pulled him tight, bending his head to draw the engineer in for a long, scorching kiss.
“No, I don’t.”  Tony stroked Steve’s cheek, amused when the supersoldier made a purring noise.  His big jungle cat, tamed by a simple stroke.  “I’m sorry for how you found out, Pepper.”  He didn’t look at her again, had eyes only for Steve.  “I’m not sorry we went out on an amazing date.  And I’m really, entirely, most definitely not sorry about loving Steve.”  He stretched up until he could kiss the underside of Steve’s jaw.  “I think he might be the best thing to ever happen to me.”
Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hair, unable to keep from arching up into that mouth.  “Feels good, doll.”
“I can’t imagine ever objecting to that.”  Tony continued to stroke his face, feather-light touches on his forehead and temples, sweeping his thumb across the cheekbone before touching full lips.  His eyes met Steve’s, and he saw things in those blue eyes that he’d never speak… wondered if Steve could see them in his own.  “Let me finish working you loose, baby.  Your back was a mess of knots… I imagine your front is too.”  Tony kissed him once more before resuming his work with a fresh coating of massage oil.
Chuckling, Tony obliged.  He kept to small kitten licks, reveling in the sounds Steve made.  Then he remembered Steve’s earlier request for rough, and caught the nipple between his teeth, biting down.
“Then why – ”  Steve’s voice caught on something that sounded suspiciously like tears.  “Damn it, doll, you said we can’t talk about it.  That… that it was just… between us.”
Tony had already returned his mouth to Steve’s cock before it occurred to him that he should probably object to that pet name.  That seemed like a bridge too far… but also, really difficult to think about with Steve’s cock heavy on his tongue.  That warranted his attention first, obviously.
Tony chuckled and kissed Steve’s neck again.  “You’ve got a safeword, sweetheart.  I didn’t hear you use it.”
“No game.”  Tony had to set down the tea kettle.  His hands were shaking too much to keep from spilling.  “No angle.  Is it really that hard to believe I might – that he might – there might be something real there?”  He was grateful to have a reason not to look up at her – couldn’t bear the look he knew she’d be giving him.
Concerned now, Tony tightened his hand around Steve’s neck, smoothed the other over broad muscles.  There was a fine line here between reassurance and dismissing Steve’s concerns, and Tony wasn’t sure he was flexible enough to walk it.  “I will, if you’ll promise the same thing.”
The team had been remarkably unsurprised.  Clint had bemoaned losing a bet to Phil – their SHIELD liaison had cleaned up in the betting – but watched them with soft eyes whenever they weren’t looking.  Natasha didn’t want to hide her observation of them – she was openly entertained, but never with any malice.  Thor was jovial and congratulatory.  Bruce had been the wild card – he’d carefully watched Steve and Tony together over the course of several evenings before granting his full approval.
That successfully cut Pepper’s train of thought off at the station.  “How do you even know what pan – ”
Steve cupped his hand around the back of Tony’s head, stroking his hair.  “We really should go, sweetheart.”
Except Clint had done a dumbass thing in the field, and now was being evaluated in medical.  Natasha was with him – duh – but that left Steve outside medical, pacing.
Tony started to move – tried to go slow, and knew he wouldn’t be able to stay that way.  Within minutes he was moving almost as fast as he could, clawing at Steve’s shoulders and hips, desperate to get just that much closer, that much deeper.  Steve spread his legs as wide as his enhanced flexibility would allow, meeting Tony’s thrusts with his own movements.  “So close, sweetheart… oh, God!”
