John turned around even though he knew Sherlock couldn’t see him from where he was lying, “Some pants?”
Sherlock’s slimy brow furrowed, “Okay John. I need you to listen very carefully because we don’t have much time. Can you do that.”
“Thank you John, um, the paper towel too if you wouldn’t mind,” Sherlock gestured to himself, “Pickle juice.” He watched as John quickly swiped the paper towel from beside the sink, placing it in his hands with the same gusto as he’d thrown him onto the pillow. He gave a brief nod as a thank you before he began to get the pickle remains off him as best he could. He watched quietly as John debated whether or not to leave the kitchen before he settled on just standing in the doorway with his back to Sherlock.
I sat on the edge of the bed and gently tapped Jack’s arm. “Are you alright?” I asked, and immediately felt like slapping myself. Of course he wasn’t alright. Why would he be sobbing his heart out is he was? Stupid, stupid Dorothy. “Jackie. Come on. Please. Let me help you. Why are you sobbing?” I tried again. Still nothing. I was just about to prod him another time when the boy burst out crying even louder, not even attempting to muffle his cries this time.
Alarmed yet? You should be. And if you aren’t, well… then maybe you belong in this household with us. Anyway, let’s go back to the story, shall we?
So... there it is. A new chapter. And, Once again, Tell me what you think, leave comments, criticism, blah, blah, blah. You know the drill. Also, thought you'd like to know, the next chapter is from the Johnlock household. Excited? Well, I hope so.
The attic of the house was something that looked like it belonged in a fairytale. The entire room was painted sparkling white, and there were huge windows on the wall that let the sunshine in. The sunlight reflected around the room, creating beautiful patterns across the sparkly white walls. The sunlight also refracted from the three elaborate glass chandeliers hung on the ceiling, creating rainbow beams here and there. To add to it all, beautiful paintings were hung on either sides of the room, making it look like some kind of royal hallway. (I realize I’m bad with metaphors, but just go with it.)
The previous version of the chitchatting chickens were a little… unpopular, to say the least. It was probably due to the fact they had run around the house, spouting verses of Shakespeare to anyone who would listen. I shivered. I still had nightmares about those things.
A terrifying caretaker, a boy who preferred picking flowers to playing games, a girl who wore trousers, and a mad scientist. We were quite a weird family, but hey, we were a bloody fantastic one if I do say so myself.
I had asked Uncle Harry why he had chosen to adopt us of all people, and all he he had said was, "Miraculous people deserve miraculous opportunities, Dorothy, and you and Jack, are quite honestly the most miraculous people I have ever met,"
Ten minutes later, Linda and Uncle Harry’s coach disappeared from view, and Jack and I were alone in the house.
“No?” Jack was looking more and more nervous by the minute. It would have been funny if I wasn’t focused on something else.
On an even happier note, HAPPY NEW YEAR, FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN SPECIES! WE MADE ANOTHER YEAR ALIVE!
Lucky for my dumb self, I saw the robot hurtling toward me just in time, and quickly darted out of the way. (I also proceeded to slip and fall on my ass, but whatever.)
But Uncle Harry and Linda welcomed me with open arms. They didn’t judge the fact that I wore trousers, (believe me, I have had my fair share of judgement there) there wasn’t any judgement on my manners, (which definitely weren’t ladylike) or anything, really. It was quite refreshing.
Quickly tearing out of my bed, I rushed to the bathroom to shower and throw on a pair of black trousers and a beautiful white blouse. It apparently has its own style of necklines and stitching and all, but I couldn’t identify a fabric or fashion to save my life. (Believe me, I’ve tried.) Combing my hair was somewhat of a struggle, to say the least. Okay, so it was a really, really big struggle, but after ten minutes of physical, mental, and emotional torture, black locks of hair fell neatly(sort of) at my waist. Now, all that was left to do was to go face the world and act like a normal human being. Easy, right?
Alright, so Linda could be a bit of a prick sometimes, but she honestly was the most caring, motherly person I have ever met. The only problem with her is that she is convinced that a girl my age should wear dresses, sit all dolled up, act pretty and posh, and she definitely wouldn’t complain me being a bit educated in the arts of singing and dancing.
Maybe I ought to tone down the dramatics a bit. I’m afraid I’m giving you a rather bad opinion of myself, but I’d guess my poor storytelling would eventually give you the same idea, so no matter.
Closing the door of Jack’s room behind me, I walked into the hall with Apollo at my heels. It seemed that Uncle Harry and Linda had finally decided to stop abusing their vocal chords, and they had both gone to bed. Without having dinner with us first. Normally I would have woken everyone just on principle, but I decided to forego the process tonight. It seemed like we had enough dramatics as it was. I had no idea what was with all the people of the house suddenly exploding into moods, but it had left me utterly confused.
Jack and I had managed to collect all the broken parts, albeit with a little cursing and attitude on each side. (“Stop thrusting the pieces so roughly into my hands Dora! You’re ruining my nail paint!” “Who the hell paints their nails, Thorn?” “Normal people, like me, Clark. Oh, and watch the—“White paint.” “Nice warning, Thorn. Now I have white paint all over my shoes thanks to your quick judgement.” “Oh, shut up.”)
I shook my head, trying to shake all those sappy thoughts away. This was ridiculous. What just happened back there? Was I being sappy and recollecting old memories while gazing into space? Oh no. I wasn’t sappy, I was serene and unflappable. Totally.
I sighed. We clearly weren’t going to get any answers from the bickering adults in the house, so, might as well forget about it. I turned to my curly headed friend to voice out this exact thought, when I realized what a huge mistake I had made.
I headed down for breakfast, and noticed that I was late. The three other occupants of the house were already at the table, and it seemed that they were at the table for at least ten minutes now, which explained a lot of the cursing and shouting because they really couldn’t stand each other. At all.
So obviously, when Harry Watson starts screaming bloody murder, you know that something is very, very wrong.
“You really need to stop laughing and giggling like such a girl, Jack. Heaven knows I’ve already got once menace to deal with, I don’t need another,” Linda muttered. She pretended to not like Jack, but everyone in the household, except maybe Jack, knew that she really cared for him and considered him her son. Ah, the drama in this house, I tell you.
Uncle Harry opened his mouth to say something, but promptly shut it when he saw the glare Linda was sending his way. “You had better stay away from the lab, Dorothy,” he finally muttered, because he was terrified of Linda’s death glare. We all were.
He took me here, to Caeruleum Mansion, where he and Linda were roommates at first, but eventually they bought the house together and Uncle Harry worked as a mechanical engineer while Linda worked as a school teacher.
I grinned. “Thanks, Uncle Harry,” I muttered, shooting a triumphant look at Linda, who ignored me as usual. Rude.
You’d think after so many times of breaking rules, he’d be more open and used to it, but no. The lad remains as assiduous as ever. (Pardon the long words. I’m just trying to feel smart here.)
That’s… that’s actually a good question. Answer? I just forgot about all that with a new battle royale in my house. You know how it is, your guardians throw one tantrum and you just completely forget about your best friend’s impeccable cake-making skills.
I briefly entertained the idea of Uncle Harry and Linda having telepathy skills and somehow already knowing that we had already stirred up a literal disaster in their absence, but of course, that was ridiculous. Telepathy doesn’t work from long distances.
Just another day in the Clark-Watson-Brown-Thorn Household. (My, that’s quite a mouthful, isn’t it?)
Both adults took one look at Jack, and welcomed him right into our little family. Although he said he wouldn’t stay long, Jack found himself saying yes when legal adoption papers were placed before him, and there it was, our perfect little family.
“Let me go get Apollo first,” Jack sighed in defeat, and I did a little victory dance. My friend just chuckled and whistled for Apollo, mumbling about what a bad idea this was.
“You two better keep the house in order until we get back,” Linda waved a hand at Jack and me. “And no going into that blasted lab until your uncle comes back, Linda. The last time you went in there alone you bleached Apollo’s fur blue,” she said.
Well, that was a dismissal if I had ever heard one. It surprised me, though, I must admit. Jack usually craved company when he was sad, so this cold and dismissive version of him was not something I was used to. Oh well. Everyone had bad days, right?
My name is Dorothy Clark, I’m fourteen years old, I live in London and I’m very, very British. I live with a rather… eccentric uncle who tries to invent mechanisms that would supposedly “Change the goddamn world,” and spectacularly fails in the process. I prefer trousers to a skirt, (who doesn't, really) enjoy riling rude people up, (maybe a little too much) grew up with a half-crazy caretaker, and live in a madhouse where berserk machines could end your life. But I fit right in, because just like all the things in my life, I too am a little bit mad.
Now, I better get started with the story, or I probably would end up talking about the favourite cheese of rainbow coloured dragons. (It's mozzarella, in case you were wondering)
My day started as I woke up to the sound of yelling, cursing and shouting. For any normal person, this would be cause of alarm. But me? Oh no. A literal chimpanzee could waltz into my room and start quoting Shakespeare, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. Although I admit, the picture of an ape reciting Romeo and Juliet is pretty entertaining.
Oh well. That just means more cupcakes for me. Yes, my primary concern while faced with two distressed guardians and a best friend half-terrified to death is, and always will be, Jack’s baked goods. Sue me. Actually, please don’t. Those things are expensive.
As I blinked and waited for my eyes to get used to the morning light, I brushed my teeth while simultaneously cursing the sun for rising so early. Alright, so it was a quarter to ten, but whatever.
And of course, the metal talking chickens were right there, piled up on the roof. Drenched and shivering at this point, I didn’t even want to know how they got there. All I wanted to do was get them and get out of the damn thunderstorm.
“Shall we, Dora dearest?” that was Jack, (obviously) with Apollo, also known as the cutest creature on earth, in tow.
Twenty minutes later, all four of us were stood on the porch, helping Linda and my uncle with their bags.
“What the bloody hell are they on about?” Uncle Harry was pacing the room, tugging at his long hair. “Linda,” he turned to my alarmed guardian, “Tell them. Tell them that they can do as they please, but they won’t get one single thing out of me. Not one.  Do you hear me?” my uncle was visibly shaking at this point, and Linda looked rather frightened. Combined with the raging storm outside, it really wasn’t the most cheerful atmosphere.
Now, with my infamous attire, absolute lack of posh manners, two left feet and a rather huge err… dislike for dancing, you can probably tell that Linda and I don’t exactly agree on the same things.
"Linda and I are heading out for a bit of business, so Jack and Dorothy, you two will hold up the fort while we’re gone for an hour or two,” Uncle Harry said, finishing breakfast. “Oh, and Dorothy, you can wear those trousers dear. You look just fine.” He reached for the newspaper.
Alright, so maybe that wasn’t the best introduction, but cut me some slack, I am, after all, on the run after murdering a man in cold blood, not to mention having to deal with having a high functioning sociopath and a very exasperated former military doctor as my partners in crime. (Get it? Partners in crime? Because this whole thing is about crimes? Oh, never mind)
We even went to the trouble of preparing them each a cuppa, so they would be in a better mood. Well, Jack did. I’ve been banned forever from the kitchen because I almost burned down the kitchen while cooking once. Twice. Okay, multiple times.
“But Linda, we’re working on a new project there! And this time Jack can watch Apollo, tell her Uncle Harry!” I cried, gesturing to my uncle.
What perfect timing for an earthquake. At least, that’s what I thought it was until I heard muffled whimpers and then it suddenly hit me—Jack was sobbing. It wasn’t the little sobs he’d let out when he’d read sad stories, or the little squeaks that would come out when the curly headed lad was injured. No, this was real, ugly crying and… I had no idea what to do.
I had just finished lunch, and was sitting on the porch, examining and admiring my new physics book. As I was reading it, I had caught sight of a pair of very curious blue eyes looking at me. It was Jack, the new boy who had moved in. He had seemed rather nervous, and slowly made his way over to me.
Now, you being, well, you, are probably wondering, “Why isn’t Dr. Watson narrating the case like he always does? And, more importantly, why is a crackpot idiot narrating the case instead?”
Ten minutes later, Uncle Harry was still shouting, except now he had changed into dry clothes, and was also holding a cup of tea (courtesy of Jack) in his hands. Oh, and Linda decided to add to the atmosphere by arguing with Uncle Harry, which is always fun. (Hint: It’s not.)
Of course things admittedly get a little more complicated when instead of offering you the usual citrus fruit, life decides to test your patience by sending a certain raven-haired detective and his military doctor your way.
I know, I know, you’re cursing me out for being dramatic again. But hey, what’s life without a little drama, right? Besides, you'll get used it. Eventually.
Business was the code word for all the mysterious outings (yes, like this one) that my uncle and Linda went on. We weren’t allowed to ask questions on a subject that crossed into the topic of business, so questions like “Where did you at two in the morning?” and “Why are there blood stains on the floor?” usually go unanswered. You know, like a typical family, really.
It was a windy night when I had first entered the house. I had spent nearly all my life in that orphanage, and then suddenly a mysterious man appeared out of nowhere and tells me that I’m going to live with him now. Needless to say, I was a little confused.
What surprised me, though, was the fact that Linda and Uncle Harry had forgotten about this. They were the strictest enforcers of the no loud noises with Jack around rule. Whatever they remembered and whatever they forgot, the rule was always etched permanently into their minds. So the fact that they were paying no heed to the rule was a little… surprising.
Fair questions, really. I suppose I could answer them right now, but where’s the fun in that? Besides, I’ve always been rather fond of dramatics, so it’ll be all the more fun to reveal details at the most appropriate time. But rest assured, I have a rather important part to play.
Linda and Uncle Harry stormed into the house, (yes that was a pun) looking absolutely livid. They were both dripping wet, and left puddles of water across the house. Uncle Harry looked like he actually wanted to murder someone, while Linda just clutched on to her big yellow purse, fixing all of us with a look between anger and worry.
“Where they bloody hell are they? They couldn’t have just gotten up and walked off!” snapped Jack after our fifth search of the house for runaway chickens.
I grinned. Although I pretended to take Jack to the lab only to annoy him, the truth was that I needed him there. You know, moral compass and all that.
Now that made both Uncle Harry and Linda quite unusual people. A man and a woman never moved in together unless they were married, and they certainly didn’t let the ‘woman of the house’ to go out and earn money when another man of the house was working. Both Linda and Uncle Harry knew of all this, of course, but they, in the simplest way possible, clearly didn’t give a damn.
Before I could get another word in, however, Uncle Harry started screaming again, with Linda looking at him disapprovingly.
So yeah, hope you stay happy, alive, and with hope. Also, I wouldn't complain a if a few comments existed on this work.
I shook my head. Mysteries were for mornings. Right now, it was time to fall extremely ungracefully on my bed and snore my way to the land of dreams.
So, dear reader, you probably can understand why I was a little… confused over the whole murderous expression thing . One look at Jack and it’s clear that he was at a loss as well. We simply didn’t know why both of the adults of the house looked like they were going to explode with barely suppressed anger.
“Look Jackie, we’ve finally got the house to ourselves. Do you know what that means?” I asked my curly friend.
We climbed the cursed attic stairs and finally reached the attic landing, panting. Jack swore that the stairs get longer every time we climbed them, and I couldn’t help but agree. Even Apollo nodded in agreement, and Apollo was puppy who was supposed to be tireless.
Perhaps it was a rude cabbie. Heaven knows that happens quite often with my two guardians. Or maybe the foul weather? But I happened to know that a bit of rain never fazed either of them, so that was probably not it. But before I could ponder over it properly, a loud shout startled me out of my thoughts.
As I moved to set up the lab, I caught Jack looking at me with knowing eyes, as if he knew exactly what I was thinking. I sighed and gestured for him to shut up, and went to start the lab.
Apollo was our little puppy, whom Jack saw freezing on the street last winter and insisted that we adopt him because “We, can’t just let that adorable thing freeze in the street, Harry!” Linda was absolutely against it, muttering about how the house didn’t need a puppy along with three stubborn mules, but eventually she had given in.
Yes, that’s right. We were on the roof, in a thunderstorm, right next to a huge pile of metal. And yes, we’re stupid. Thanks for asking.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Jack Thorn. Where’s your sense of adventure?” I paced around the house, looking for my boots. Because the house was finally left to us, and I’ll be damned if I let myself waste this opportunity. Sue me.
“Don’t worry Linda, I’ll keep her from burning the house down and dyeing dogs blue,” Jack solemnly promised, which earned him an elbow in the ribs.
Jack was leaning against the wall, with pure panic in his expression. His eyes were wide, his breathing shallow, and he looked like he was going to pass out any minute.
We soon got to work on our latest project, which Jack had named ‘Chitchatting chickens’. It is exactly what it sounds like. A couple of robotic chickens that, in theory, were supposed to talk. Because, why not, really?
Jack chuckled, but chose to stay silent. Smart move, really. I usually kept to my word, which most people only learned the hard way.
“Sorry, woke up a bit late today,” I muttered as I took my seat next to a wiry woman, about thirty-five years old, with honey-blond hair and dark brown eyes, who is also known as Linda Brown, my caretaker.
We had cleaned up the roof properly, but the damage was done. There was a huge black stain on the roof, and the chitchatting chickens were no longer with us. (Jack seemed positively gleeful about that last one. Traitor.) We had planned to simply tell Linda and Uncle Harry what happened, minus the part where we stupidly ventured out next to a huge pile of metal on the roof in a thunderstorm. Because, hello, have you met us? Jack and I are extremely smart people who wouldn’t even think of doing stupid things like going to roofs during thunderstorms. Totally.
“I swear that roof is haunted, Jackie. There are strange noises coming from it all the time, you’ve heard them! Do you really want to deal with ghosts right now?” I muttered, because it’s true. That roof was definitely haunted, because the statues up there definitely didn’t move by themselves. (Yes, we keep statues on our roof. Get used to it.)
Lightning hit the robots, and all of them exploded, each painstakingly crafted piece scattering in different directions. All of them were blackened with soot and utterly destroyed. So much for proving Uncle Harry and Linda wrong, I suppose. Suddenly, a rather high pitched voice jolted me out of my thoughts.
In case you’re wondering what all the fuss was about, this is all about a lab. A mechanical lab, to be exact. My uncle is a mechanical engineer, you see. But he claims that all his office projects are “Too boring to stay alive while doing them,” and so he built his own lab, where he built machines years ahead of his time. They were all ingenious ideas, but none of them were fully functional yet.
You’re probably thinking, "Oh Dorothy, why don’t you just whisk the boy away like a knight in shining armour and then happily eat all the baked goods the lad’s going to bake you later as thanks for saving him?"
Why? Well, I already told you, I live in a madhouse. And I mean that in the most literal possible sense. All four of us in this house are mad, in one way or another.
That’s where I came in. Jack and I tried to work out all the problems in the machines, and try to make them actual functional contraptions.
When life gives you lemons, do something unexpected and make orange juice. Now you’ve done something unique, and also have a commercially popular drink in your hands, while simultaneously giving life and everyone around you a heart attack, because “What kind of sorcerer makes orange juice out of lemons?”
I quickly retracted my hand. “Sorry, sorry Jack,” I began, but Jack cut me off. “Stop.” His voice was hoarse from all that crying. “I’m sorry Dora, but I really can’t tell you anything right now. I shall see you in the morning. Goodnight.”
I had closed the book, ready to bolt. But something in Jack’s eyes had stopped me. I had recognized myself in that look. Something that told me that this boy was different, and worth another chance of friendship. So I had slowly extended my hand, and it was defenitely woth it when Jack’s entire face had lit up, brighter than the sun. He shook my hand so aggressively that I had thought he was trying to rip my arm off, but it turns out he had just been excited after all.
As I walked to my room, I caught sight of Uncle Harry in his room, muttering to himself about… ducks? As he spotted me, however, he quickly walked to me and caught me in an unexpected hug. “Everything will be fine, alright Dora? I won’t ever let anything happen to you, alright? This will all come together, you’ll see,” he muttered. I had no idea what was going on, but I let myself sink into the embrace. Uncle Harry asked me to get a glass of water, which I did, feeling extremely confused when he took the glass of water with extreme reverence and promptly shut the door in my face. What in the world was going on?
So this time, Jack and I were extra careful in making the chickens. Uncle Harry had nearly died laughing when we had told them we were starting this project. (He was a rather huge fan of Shakespeare, and had enjoyed the whole fiasco. The rest of us? Not so much.) So I intended to prove both Uncle Harry (who still thought that the chickens Shakespearing us to death was hilarious) and Linda wrong by constructing talking chickens.
Jack wasn’t exactly… fond of loud arguments, you see. Every time there was a loud word, the poor boy flinched and looked towards any sort of help.
Hey again! Oh wow writing a fic is harder than I thought.... I'm sorry for all those cliffhangers, but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do. I'll try to update as much as I can, but let me know what you think in the comments! Any ideas are also welcome, I love sharing things with this fandom. Man I had a whole speech planned and I forgot it all.... Oh well. See ya soon and keep hoping!
So, Linda’s reluctance to leave me to do projects in the lab alone was understandable. But in my defence, that was seven years ago. Everybody deserves a second chance, right?
Now obviously, it didn’t take a genius to figure out that Jack probably wasn’t in the best mood with this whole screaming match thing going on.
We had both cried when we heard things being said about us. All that trouble of dressing up and learning things to fit in, only to be kicked out, over and over and over again.
Well then, I might have to do this the hard way. Recruiting (read: bribing ) Apollo with the almighty power of biscuits, I managed to push, shove, and tackle my friend up to his rooms. Jack seemed to be in a different reality altogether; his normally bright blue eyes were glassy and unfocused; and he promptly collapsed on to the bed once we came into his room. I wondered for a moment if Jack had somehow gotten a hold of Uncle Harry’s very stealthy stash of cocaine, (hint: it’s under his bed) but I dismissed the thought immediately. Suddenly, Jack’s bed started shaking ever so slightly under me.
“You always wake up late,” Linda hissed, “And for heaven’s sake, do something about your clothes! You look like a lunatic, wearing a man’s clothes. Honestly, no other household would ever allow this ridiculousness, I tell you. Such unladylike behaviour!” she stabbed her bacon as if it had murdered her entire family.
I lifted the heavy key that I had managed to swipe from Linda’s drawer and opened the door. The key turned with a satisfying ‘click’, and we were in.
“Wait Johnathan.” Sherlock said urgently pressing himself to the wall as Molly looked at him questionably. The knocking sound game again along with a voice so Sherlock spoke quickly. “Why did you come here?” You could go anywhere, why pick somewhere you’ve already been.
“..why? Why are you doing this? What did I ever do to you?” John asked, demanding to know he was finally so happy and he had to come and ruin everything, he didn’t understand.
Sherlock would lay there and brush his fingers through John’s silky blond hair that was just starting to gray about his temples. John would wake slowly, his eyes fluttering open and looking to him with the most angelic smile. But all that was gone now.
The knife in his leg, removed from frustration to what seemed like hours ago kicked behind him in a desperate attempt to follow John. Moriarty having taken him away with a knife to his neck and Sherlock was defenseless to help him.
Sherlock moved before he understood what was happening, rushing down the dark halls following the echo of his shrill scream. John’s voice rang in his mind for a moment, ‘It’s a trap’ he said. He knew that, of course it was but what was he supposed to do. He couldn’t wait, he couldn’t stop for someone to come fix everything, heros didn’t exist. Not even the modern kind, he couldn't wait for the police to fail at their jobs so he had to do things on his own. In the dark, in the empty hollow of this power plant.
For some reason Sherlock moved and John almost fell -as he had put most of his weight on him- but Sherlock was in front of him pinning him to the wall, effectively holding him up. Then all of a sudden Sherlock's lips were on his and for some reason -John couldn't comprehend- he was kissing back.
When Sherlock laid alone in his bed at night, wherever he may be, in a hotel, usually always in a different part of the UK. When he laid in bed sometimes he would pull the briefcase out and connect himself to it, set the timer and he would dream.
He was in the process of destroying the failed experiment, when on a whim, he ran the mostly blown results into his laptop. It would take awhile to run through most likely but perhaps something had clicked. Maybe the explosion was just what he needed, maybe it would come back that it was positive, that he’d done it, that he’d found a cure. That he’d get John back.
He found himself smiling slightly too as he backed away and slipped into his room not bothering to turn on the lights as the sun wasn’t fully set filling the room with a soft glow. He closed his door quietly and sat atop his bed just smiling content with the information that John was happy. He was shaken by a quite knock at his door.
“Alright, alright. Don’t get your nickers in a twist.” Lestrade sighs and puts his hands up walking back into the room a bit as Sherlock leaves. He comes to stand by Mycroft muttering a few words before he’s gone as well and it’s just the two of them.
“I got involved, attached. You know it made me almost believe you when you said ‘caring is not an advantage’.”
Sherlock shakes his head before thinking about Molly a moment and remembering their conversation. “Oh right. We need to tell Molly about Jim.”
“It’s too big.” John whines pulling at the material that just barely touched the floor as he swayed back and forth.
They were quiet for a while as they walked eventually making their way to the roof. They sat on the edge and John was quite while Sherlock was thinking hands pressed to his lips. It was a long while before either of them spoke until Sherlock broke the silence.
In the morning John woke up to Sherlock on the phone with presumably Lestrade. John himself was still laid out on the mound of blankets and pillows from last night. He had expected to wake up with all kinds of pain from sleeping on the floor especially from his shoulder and was pleasantly surprised when he stretched out and found no resistance. Sherlock probably thought of that and did something about it, he could be incredibly thoughtful when he was in the mood to be.
"Possess." Sherlock snorts looking back forward as they hit the sidewalk. John's aunt's house was in the middle of nowhere and even attempting to find a cab would be pointless.
"Because that was the plan and it worked." Sherlock states matter of factor as if John was to know as well.
Mycroft lived two floors below them with his flatmate Greg Lestrade. They were dating but had to keep it a secret or be expelled for campus dating which was prohibited. Greg and Molly have been friends for longer than her and Sherlock have and she introduced them years back. Sherlock made an effort to forget his name just to piss Mycroft off. He liked Greg despite everything. Greg was going to be a policeman a detective inspector so Sherlock would need him later.
Sherlock shifts slowly to sit back against the headboard as he feels John drift to sleep. He sighs quietly to himself brushing a strand of John’s hair gently behind his ear. He seemed impossibly more innocent and small while sleeping it was cute yes but also made his chest ache terribly.
One slicing it’s way down Sherlock’s back before hitting the floor, another hitting his arm and as he starts to fall forward the last stabbing into his leg as he hits the ground. There was no scream, there was no cry, Sherlock didn’t make a sound but his body hitting the floor heavily. A thump as the ringing echoed throughout the space and the great hero fell.
"Of course, dear." She just takes it all in stride. "So head wound they rushed him into surgery ten hours later Terry-Mrs Carson- checked on him and she found out,(Some technical crap the author didn't want to look up or even think is a thing) basically he has been cut off from most of his functions or so his mind thinks."
“Wake up.” John repeated softly with a shake of his head and cups the other side of Sherlock's face as well, resting their foreheads together he closes his eyes. “Wake up.”
“Oh just a little something in the air vents, suffocation is imminent, Johnny. The question is, which will you save?” James asked with this bloodthirsty smile that turned John's stomach.
It opened it with a loud screech and the silence surrounded him. The echoes down the dark hall faded quickly and the silence blanketed his senses, for a long moment he remained imobile. Until he heard the most terrifying noise he had ever heard, it turned his stomach inside out and cut it in two in a way he could only explain as sickening. Words failed to explain the scream of his lover that came and echoed seemingly for ages through the hall he could see.
“John, get up quick.” Sherlock called suddenly by his side, not a scratch on him as he held John's arms pulling him to stand beside him. His legs deciding now was a good time to actually work.
"Yes, yes of course. Leave now, Mycroft." The younger-Sherlock- grumbled rolling his eyes. The tall man-Mycroft- sighed annoyed turning away from Sherlock to the door when he noticed the boy staring at them through the open door across the hall. Even Sherlock looked over to see what caused his brother to pause. They both stared at the boy strapped to the bed across the hall with a questioning stare. The boy did nothing just kept staring at his vacant stare at Sherlock, it made him fidget with unease. "Do be on your way." He forced out past his discomfort.
“What? Yes?” Sherlock says quickly recovering from his haze of sleep, sitting up and looking to the doctor expectantly.
He texted Lestrade back and forth about what had been happening since he had seen him last and convinced him to talk to Mycroft. A few moments later he was getting a call from Mycroft, he glanced at John momentarily.
"Take a day off, Greg." John said coming to place tea and coffee in front of them both. Lestrade turned to him now.
“Yes of course I like you.” Sherlock said backing away from him. “I’ve idolized you since I first saw you on the telly. How could I not like you. But-“ He was about to say more when John’s lips were on his own, his arms around his neck. He placed his own on John’s waist and back holding him close and kissing him deeply.
It was exactly the opposite as he expected. Yes, his mind was greater than others; he was one of the most gifted architects to meet that of the dream world. That was when he could do it. He was wrong. His mind was indeed so great it made him so prone to the limbo state he had nearly slipped there too many times.
John was dressed in a dark oversized hoodie and the smallest pair of pants Sherlock could find. Which were khakis and John was boiling in the heat and unrelenting sun. Sherlock glared at everyone he saw to get them out of the way and John stumbled behind him almost to the point of being dragged as Sherlock picked up his pace.
John swallowed thickly as the darks of Moriarty’s eyes seemed to take over the rest of them. James used to have some sort of compassion in him, for one person. Sebastian seemed to make him human but now without him.
“Yes, I will.” Sherlock assures him about the fifteenth time that day as he sits at his desk doing his work. The door opens and Molly comes in, they still haven’t told her that her boyfriend was the reason John no longer had a band. They’d tell her eventually, maybe.
“Yoo-hoo. Sherlock dear, are you awake?” Mrs Hudson whispered cracking open the door, Sherlock found himself slightly chuckling.
Ahh finally I'm back! The whole time I was supposed to be taking a break I was thinking of story lines and plots for future chapters! Hope you enjoyed this long delayed chapter.
“Did you just use the term ‘kick ass’ in a serious sentence?” John giggles unable to keep the smile off his face as he looks over at Sherlock.
Sherlock fell asleep with John's arms around him circled in warmth and security. He felt completely safe and calm for the first time in a while. He should have known not to trust it.
"What am I supposed to label our relationship on my blog? I certainly can't call you my friend it doesn't really work anymore and boyfriend is just so frivolous." John grumbled a bit his revulsion for the word came from having male friends as a child and his sister teasing him of having a boyfriend. Sherlock too had an aversion to it though his was just because he found it a silly term that wasn't taken seriously.
“How did you get so good at this?” John asked as they pulled apart again, breathing becoming difficult, unfortunately. “No wait actually ignore that. Are you a virgin?” He asks curiously the question simply popping into his head.
“Such a waste, really. On the brink of your career and all too soon the great Sherlock Holmes will be gone. All because of 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦.” Moriarty said the word with such disgust.
"What am I..?" John asked lost, motioning to the body. He didn't understand why he had to be here. Maybe Sherlock wanted him to be the next victim, lure out the killer or something. Like a sacrifice. He'd freeze to death then be offered up to the killer on a silver platter. Or if that took too long maybe they'd kill him as well. That'd be nice. Anything for more sleep and warmth.
"Wait Sherlock, doctors have been trying to find a cure for years. You can't just come fix it it's not that easy." John argued. Sherlock didn't blame him he had been stuck here for years without hope of an escape.
“I have a phobia of needles. Probably from too many times missing the vein.” John looked up sharply staring at Sherlock in surprise and yet also in understanding. “It wasn’t exactly the best time in my life, but I’m clean now. Completely.”
He was afraid, afraid of what was to come, what Jim had to toture him with this time. He wished he could remember more, about what happened when his uncle died then they wouldn’t have to do this.
The candle cast an eerie glow across the room and shadows over Sherlock's prone form. He drew Sherlock and the odd shadows across him in the dark but after he was done he wasn't any more tired. He noticed his mirror on the other side of the room, there were more odd shadows in it and one that John thought to be in the shape of a person. When he turned to see if it was there was nothing so he drew that to.
"Alright." John practically jumps for joy as he makes his way to their -yes it's theirs now- room down the hall, Sherlock in tow. "But only because you said please."Sherlock teases and John swats his arm but says nothing too happy about finally getting some sleep.
“Was it a good idea to leave them together?” Mycroft asks as they walk to the line up they have set up.
"Alright, fine but why do you still have it?" John asks again feeling like he just went through a blender.
It wasn’t long until the door was swung open, harsh winds pushing the door quite violently forward and coming back to hit the wall with a loud thump, thunder growling in the background. James came into the room dropping his soaked bag beside him, with how wet he was one might think he had fallen into a creek.
"Hmm. Yes well have to work on that." Sherlock muttered to himself before coming to stand behind John's chair. "Let me." Sherlock poised his perfectly manicured fingers over the keyboard and in swift precision clicked the correct letters -John could never go without a sentence before deleting something- and the word appeared on the screen. John smiled slightly abashed.
“Oh Johnny boy, here we are again.” James said slowly circling the room that he seemed so comfortable in but John's eyes hadn’t adjusted enough to the darkness of the new space to recognize it. “You have grown but you’ve not changed really, have you?”
Oh, John. How longed for his lover, boyfriend, whatever it was that they were. He never told John anything, not how he’s longed for him or how much he loves him. He never got the chance and he hated himself for not being able to say it back.
"It'll only take ten." Sherlock stayed and they were off once again. The interrogation actually took him fifteen minutes and John made sure to be a dick about it. Sherlock cracked the case open and after a small chase the other criminal was behind bars as well. John made sure to voice his adoration for his brilliance and as they decided to walk home that night Sherlock took his hand pleased beyond words.
When they reached the hospital John was cleared and Greg went into intensive care. The doctors had said a lot of words that John wasn’t able to retain on his own but that was okay because at some point Mycroft had arrived to listen for him. He didn’t particularly like Mycroft, scared him a bit actually what with the suits and umbrellas and dark fancy cars, not to mention the stories Sherlock had told him.
“Looking for these?” Sherlock said in a tone he didn’t think he’d be able to manage if he was thinking with his conscious brain that wasn’t too active at the moment.
“Yes, John?” Sherlock asks expectantly holding John up and although he didn’t seem to need it, it made Sherlock feel better than to watch him sway dangerously.
"Can we not, right now. As much as I'd love to catch up we're here on business." John replies starting to get annoyed.
They went down quickly, after passing through the door they came to a halt. Two open doors stood on both sides of them and they turned to each other.
“I’m just going to sleep.” John shrugged lightly and sat down in the chair opposite to Sherlock, sinking down into the cushions and leaning back. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
He presses into him firmly and entirely. “I love you.” Sherlock breathed between the kiss and John smiled pulling him closer.
“I love you. I know this isn’t the best time but it’s true.” John said with a light smile which froze immediately as a cold ragged laugh came from behind him.
“Johnathan Watson is on in five minutes with apparently big news.” She said more subdued. This surprised Sherlock as he had a probably unhealthy obsession with the rising rockstar Johnathan Watson, he kept regular updates of anything to do with him. So it surprised him when Molly knew more about him then he did.
It seems Johns -what seemed to be- fondness for the skull had come with him even in his change to a child, seeking comfort in it.
"You're sure about this?" Sherlock asked doubtfully with a resigned sigh not expecting this to end well.
Something shifted in him as he viewed the scene before him, slowly getting out of the car. The firetruck trying to put out the raging far engulfing the car, flames licking nearby police vehicles with the wind. It was producing a great wave of heat amongst the cold of London.
He knew he had hidden the pieces in a box locked up with a key long gone. He couldn't remember why he put them in there but he remembered it was important.
"Oddly enough I do." John's soft smile turned into a small grin. "Though I can't imagine why." They took jibes at each other for a while completely content to just sit together.
He sighed quietly to himself to disband his anger and thoughts to make his brothers life miserable, then shook his head slightly and moved to open his door. He unlocked it and almost walked right into John who sat in front of his door.
"Okay so I have looked at him that way, so what? How could you not, I mean look at him. But it's Sherlock he doesn't do that? Does he?" John just spilled his guts and looked like he just told her he killed someone.
Sherlock had not only heard stories of the criminals activity but had lived through a large portion of it himself, at some points, one notable one being in that very moment it felt like the man was capable of anything at all and most of the time that is what he feared. A lot of that fear became realized when they'd found out what had happened to John.
“A grandfather clock? Who would ever need a grandfather clock.” Sherlock scowled before disappearing once again. “It didn’t fit in the flat and we already have a clock anyway.”
There was peace as Sherlock stirred into consciousness to a soft white enveloping him, a simple breeze blowing over his face, the sound of curtains rustling in the distance. He didn’t even have to open his eyes to know that wherever he was was very bright and with just a feeling alone he knew it was safe.
Sherlock waits until he hears the resounding click of the flat door and for the building to lapse into a familiar silence before stepping onto the landing. He looks up the stairs to John’s closed bedroom door and lets out a quiet breath, childishly crossing his fingers before moving to walk up the stairs.
John helped Mrs Hudson clean up and then they sat and talked a bit but she had to go eventually. So John curled up into his chair and pulled out a book he's been meaning to read and with a fresh cup of tea he ventured into his book.
John turned pressing his back against the door and watching Sherlock go nervously. He looked around the room trying to tell what had just happened with the knife, suddenly being dropped. He tried to see the blade from where he was standing, noticing just barley through the dark the string pooled around it.
Mycroft narrows his eyes at him. “Do remember I am not doing this without charge and the payment only grows as I wait.” He eyes him distastefully before turning and exiting the room swiftly, leaving the two alone.
He was in agony, both mind and body hating every bone in his body that protested against moving. Every muscle that constricted and ached with his movements forcing him to stop every few seconds.
He couldn’t quite find it in himself to care, so tranquil in the moment despite the urgency of the form above him.
“As soon as he's awake I’ll have him come see you. It may be some time Sherlock. His body needs time to recover; it may be at least a week.” Mycroft tried to tell him as gently as possible.
“No, this is my problem I should deal with it.” John replied immediately, he knew he had to face his demons and not just let others fight his battle any longer.
Sherlock came upon the ambulance where John and Mycroft sat where he left them. Neither had moved much though it seemed Mycroft was speaking to him, John didn't look like he was listening.
He stared into the eyes of the man he trusted more than anyone, more than himself. He would choose his fate and the gun clicked.
Sherlock slinked back into the flat building quietly. He climbed the seventeen steps taking them unusually one at a time, the process much more agitating than what he’d remembered. He stood at the doorway to the flat and stared at the dull flat blankly for a moment.
"So assuming you already came to that conclusion on your own, why get me to say it?" John says slightly irritated looking back behind his chair. Of course Sherlock had already thought of that he was a genius of course.
John ran, he ran as fast as he could. Hallway apon hallway, he wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or if the illusion was real. The clicks of his shoes against the linoleum, running for the lives of the people he cared about more than anyone. The only two people that truly mattered,
“John.” Sherlock risked calling out in a hushed whisper. As there’s no movement from the shadowy figure he creeps forward quietly coming up beside the figure. The room was silent his words echoed in an unpleasant way every tiny noise seeming so impossibly loud.
“But?” He taunted watching Sherlock, stretched out over a chair in the grass, lounging as if he was watching the telly. He was entertained, it had been such a long time and Sherlock could tell he was enjoying every second of it. He couldn’t hold on forever and he was wearing thin and thinner every moment that passed.
It was blinding and he closed his eyes again quickly, pupils still burning behind his eyelids. While there was a definite calmness surrounding him, in a way it was eerie, there wasn't much to be heard but the rustling noises that he now wasn’t so convinced was curtains. Trying to figure what exactly it was that he was feeling or the lack thereof feeling happening. Maybe that was why it was so peaceful.
A rush of blood to Sherlock's head and the world came into focus, the adrenaline kicking in as he tried to sit up.
“Are you spying on her? Should I be jealous?” Sherlock asks jokingly grinning as he grabs Johns laptop to type out the final draft of the song to give to his producers.
"Evidence? I didn't know this was in your job description." John said as he sat down in the free chair not before moving papers off of it of course.
They were going into war, a battle of what was still to be determined. No one was prepared, how do you prepare for the unknown? It was impossible to understand what exactly was going to happen, to predict the unpredictable.
"Not without you." John says dramatically. "Come on, we can look at it tomorrow, I'm sure you have it all memorized anyway. He's not going anywhere yet. Please?" Sherlock looks over to him and analyzes his expression for a moment before sighing.
“Oh, just kiss already so we can get on with this.” Sherlock grumbles pulling his feet from the arm of the chair and placing them on the floor so he can look away in disgust.
He sighed quietly sticking his hands in his pockets and trying to push his line of thought to the back of his mind. He didn’t want to reminisce, it would only lead to more pain in his chest as it seemed to be ripping itself apart from the inside out.
“Two swears in a month Molly I’m impressed.” After a moment of taking in her shocked expression staring at the wall Sherlock thought maybe she was going to pass out. “What is it?”
Sherlock watched John’s eyes slowly drift close with his own partly closed ones. He told John to sleep and stared at the visible bandage on his forearm stretches against his skin, John was still unaware of the marks that were underneath. The marks of a needle plunged into his body as he struggled, Sherlock is almost happy he doesn’t remember it. Remember Him.
“Yes, John?” Sherlock asks softly not able to resist the temptation of brushing Johns light bond hair away from his eyes.
John couldn’t answer, he could hardly formulate a thought past his fear and worry. He needed to get to Sherlock and find Greg, they needed to get out.
Sherlock didn't know how to react, he just stood there opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water. John eventually sighed and motioned him inside.
He became aware of some noise after an unknown amount of time had passed in his thoughts, what sounded like muddled voices coming from above him. Finding his drive again he tried to open his eyes and this time a veil of color came through the white shell he was entrapped in. The voices were familiar as were the colors and yet he couldn’t seem to place it. Realizing just now how muddled his mind seemed to be, suddenly feeling in disarray.
John startled and turned quickly staring at Sherlock for a long moment and so many emotions flashed before his eyes. They stared for a long moment just the movement of the dogtags between them before John surged forward and Sherlock was afraid he might hit him.
“I said I would and I did. Now you need to get up and put these on so we can leave, I can’t stand this place.” The man said quickly slightly irritated motioning to a pile of clothes on the foot of the bed. He made a move to leave and John quickly grabbed the man's wrist.
"You're always bossing me around John." Sherlock teases trying to lighten the mood and John puffs out his chest as he stands up.
Sherlock broke out laughing as well, even just hearing John laugh made his own bubble up. Ever since Molly talked to John about liking Sherlock, John has noticed a lot of little things about Sherlock he had previously overlooked.
The second John laid eyes on Sherlock he broke down, choking out sobs which wracked his small frame as fat tears rolled down his chubby cheeks and he cried out in despair. At this point he should be used to it but Sherlock was still shocked as he rushed to the small child and scooped him up into his arms, cradling him to his chest.
"I assume this means I'm forgiven?" Sherlock asked hopefully as they finished laughing and now we're just grinning at each other.
Mycroft and Lestrade come to sit across from him as he pulls himself out of his head. Sherlock hesitates not entirely sure of what to say he clears his throat.
Sherlock turned John back to face Greg, taking his wrists and placing John's hands on Greg’s arms turning his body to the right position. “Bend your knees and pull, I know you can do it.”
His gaze shifted from Greg to the dark figure beside him, leaning against the side of the cabinet inside the car. He had a playful smile on his lips and a loose, open expression, apparently unaffected by the current scene of things. Sirens off in the distance and shouts of the paramedics, chaos around them but all that seemed to dull as he watched Sherlock. He was at ease, perfectly fine and confident in any environment, just as he wasn’t afraid before he lost him and just as he wasn’t going to lose his cool because of something like this.
A week later they were back and forth on the whole ‘is he gay or not’ thing it was getting out of hand. Molly would look at him just walking and call him gay. That’s not how it works. Then again when did anything work the way it was supposed to around Molly.
The presence of John Watson was one that would make or break his brother. For better or for worse though he would be there.
"Sherlock, can you go get more ice from the school?" Molly asked later into the day when it was slowly getting colder out and yet there food was getting warmer until it melted. the school was selling ice for a dollar a bag and coolers as well but they already had one.
The sound of footsteps followed them down the halls, shiny shoes in Sherlock’s blood sticking to the floor as they walked.
'I find myself truly content, happy and all around feeling whole for the first time in a while. I have a sneaking suspicion as to why.
John’s legs were giving out, he couldn’t get him out. He tried to stand, to push himself to keep pulling him out of the building but he fell to the concrete, bruises sure to follow.
"Obviously." He didn't understand why Mycroft was being so trivial about the whole thing and not just doing something about it.
He takes the clipboard from the nightstand glancing it over briefly but of course most of the things on it would be inaccurate. The entire procedure was experimental and any after affect would be unpredictable. A first for everything and hopefully the last as well.
"Sherlock!" John yells as he rushes down the stairs still tugging on his jacket. Sherlock is in the street hailing a cab not having bothered to close the door. "Where the hell are you going?"
Like a little family they all needed each other even if they all denied it. There would be fights and disagreements silly arguments and squabbles but like any family they will pull through.
"I figured it out this afternoon and tried to get you, believe me John I did. I drove all the way down to the ferry but I missed it by a few minutes and you we're gone I tried calling you a hundred times. I swear, I tried, I did and I'm sorry. I got back and you were already.. he was.." Sherlock trails of as suddenly there not enough air in the room and he's gasping.
Silence settled and for a moment John didn’t know what to say or think, he hardly breathed for a long moment. He looked to Sherlock and he looked exactly the same as he did when he came in, except for the hope that he might get him back had brought color into the dim hospital room. Into the hallows of Sherlocks cheeks and for a moment he didn’t feel the presence of the ghost of him any longer.
John shakes his head fondly, so much had changed between them, their whole dynamic had shifted and yet nothing had happened. They were still friends, best friends that teased each other and would hang out and everything but maybe with a bit more kissing involved now. That he would look forward to.
“Not as bad.” Sherlock decides setting John down and replacing the jumper he was wearing for a smaller one he had found in one of the boxes of baby clothes John's mother made him keep, it was still a bit big not the right age for it yet but it worked better than anything else.
"Why- ugh just tell me!" John whines annoyed that Sherlock was being so petty. Sherlock smirked to himself, he got an odd sort of satisfaction getting under his skin, it took a lot more work when he was older. He tried to ignore that fact.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open slowly, the feeling of tranquil numbness following him as he woke. How long he had been out he wasn’t sure but he felt so light it didn’t matter. The image of the lush green field and bushy trees still fresh in his mind as he opened his eyes.
They change into suitable sleeping wear each turning around for the others privacy -John's privacy- and if one of them peaks -Sherlock- then no harm done.
“Indents in your fingers I assumed it to be a pencil but they're too fine. Metal object, anyone in the medical field was just taught how to use a scalpel. Then there's the way you treated me when I was having a panic attack, you were acting on practice. Conclusion, doctor." Sherlock recites as if reading a script.
“Of course it will.” Sherlock said unconvincingly. “Alright, here we go.” He took a breath, opened Johns door and walked into his room slowly with the IV stand and the door shut behind him with a click leaving the two alone.
“I have it narrowed down to the two locations with our limited amount of information, though I do believe one is more likely. You may know better than I do, where do you think John?” Sherlock said gesturing to the two circled pins on the map. John assessed them both looking for a familiarity.
He watched closely as the dogtags swung, clinking together on their metal chain and slowly came to a stop over his palm. He placed them back in his pocket with a sigh and sat back in his chair. When he was younger he was naive enough to think he wouldn’t need a totem like others, that his mind was strong enough to tell the difference between reality and the dreams.
The puzzle was in place all its pieces laid out in front of him waiting to be placed. Slowly meticulously he created the edges, a shell. Soon to be filled but first it must be cleared.
John is small not just in height but in weight and he feels almost delicate as Sherlock wraps his arms around him. He's so petite not in a girly way by any means but just tiny. It was adorable. He didn't have much muscle living his life in a bed and was almost similar to a toothpick. Sherlock wasn't by any means burly but John was the smallest little thing. It really was cute, not that he'd ever tell John but cute anyway.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He took his hand and revealed in the feeling of guitar string callused and ink stained fingers. Sherlock let go reluctantly and liked to think that John did when it dragged on too long. The bell rang (do they still have bells in college?) and John cleared his throat and started walking backwards towards the exit.
“You do. I know it’s difficult and doesn’t make any sense but you really have to. I promise I’ll be right there when you wake up.” Sherlock says hoping that even though he was younger his sense of reason was still intact and he would do so without much more of a fuss.
A noise pulled John from his drawings which he had only just finished the sketching and outlining of. He listened for a moment but the sound didn't come again, it sounded like something metallic hitting the ground. It was so late that all the nurses had gone home and none of the patients should be up. John got up figuring someone else was just as restless as he was and ventured into the hall.
“It seems to be a good day, I’d imagine if your up for it you could go for a walk soon. I’m sure Mr Holmes would love to take you.” She told him as her eyebrows went up and gave a mischievous wiggle. Sherlock was slightly taken aback -again- but not entirely opposed.
Sherlock clenched his teeth forcing himself not to remark on the taunts, he didn’t need to make things worse and at this point he was practically accepting death.
“Hey, you.” Someone said from behind him, perfect timing. He spun on his heel to see it was (Dr Anderson didn’t seem to fit, doctors were supposed to be smart, he definitely wasn’t.) Anderson, his eyes focused immediately on the pocket of his white coat where he could see the outline of individual cigarettes and a lighter. “What are you doing up here?”
John swallows past the sudden lump in his throat, he's so angry but also ashamed and terrified. He knew he had to tell Sherlock he just didn't know if he could, or if it would help.
John was slightly wobbly on his feet, still unsteady on his own but made his way to the bed and sat next to Sherlock. He looked as though he was sleeping though in an odd position. John has read about what Sherlock did as far as deduction but had no idea of what this was.
He rolled onto his back trying to find a way to breath until he realized what a mistake that was. He screams, screams so loud it rips his vocal chords apart. It burns his throat and his voice breaks off so quickly.
“Say it again. Just once more.” He longingly asked looking to his newly found lover, their eyes meeting dreamily.
At some point time started to blur together and as the sun set the hours bled further. He took turn after turn watching the blinking intently speed and slow each time making adjustments to his course.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock as he hobbled over to Johns bed his IV stand the only thing keeping him upright. He sat with a sigh then rubbed his hands over his face. "I was nervous John. I wanted it to go right. So I took them."
“Doin’ what?” John asks pushing himself up on Sherlock chest to sit upright atop of him and Sherlock puts his arms on John’s sides to hold him up.
"Mrs Hudson." John coughed a bit and looked over to see her pick things up around the fireplace. "What do you mean, 'finally'?"
He kept a steady grip on his waist as they slowly made their way to the short wall that led to the edge. They stood their together just staring out into the abyss that was the night sky. The wind was chilling to the bone as neither of them had thought to bring coats but neither cared, huddling up together was enough.
“I don’t know what’s in that but hopefully it’s enough.” Of course he didn’t know, he wouldn’t have checked. This is what was wrong, human error. A weakness the frailty of the mind, the things that will haunt you. Sherlock was taught to disconnect in difficult situations, when things got tough and you had to choose between heart and head. Always choose head. He had, and he would again. But he couldn’t now, why?.
Sherlock thought he was dying, he expected to die. Alone here in an empty school hallway. A complete failure to everyone, he couldn’t even save the person he loved more than anyone.
A screen clicked on beside that, another security camera of a dark room and just barely John could make out the crumpled form of Greg.
“I’m just.. I’m afraid Sherlock.” John said quietly squeezing his eyes shut and breathing in Sherlock’s comforting scent. “Jim he tortured me as a child in any way he could and I didn’t even know why. What is he going to do this time?”
Sherlock coughed violently, taking slow labored breaths as he tried to push himself up for the third time only to end up in a heap on the ground again.
“I won’t.” John grins his eyes falling closed slowly before opening one eye up at him. “I can’t move.” He says quietly just realizing it, confused and
“First, call me John none of that Johnathan crap. Second I wanted to find someone and I think I’ve found someone who can help me.” They sound of Johns retreating footsteps was all they could hear then a door being slammed. They rushed across the room  to their own door to pop it open and look through the crack. He was walking down the hallway with a woman a tall black haired woman holding a clipboard, his assistant most likely.
“How do you know?” Sherlock demanded snapping eyes open and staring at Mycroft with renewed vigor. “How could you possibly know?” He asked, his voice cracking slightly.
“Oh, look who can’t play hero anymore.” James drawled his gleaming white daggers of teeth shining in the darkness. “I was excited to meet you. The great Sherlock Holmes, leaves such an impression for just a child.” His voice was of silk with dark black hair slicked back to show his superiority as well as a gold watch that could be heard ticking away in the quite hallway.
"What do you need the needle for?" John asks giving up on looking and just fiddling with his fingernails again.
"Then what is there to fix, do you think?" Sherlock asked looking over at him questionably. He's not surprised he was listening in, he was curious and in a strange environment. Of course he was going to follow the only familiar thing he knew.
Grass. Being dragged against the grass, it imitated the sound of water. Rustling as he was moving against it, body pressed to the ground the blades of grass sliding across the shells of his ears. Choppily he moved, short bursts of movement before he stopped and then another one would follow in uneven intervals.
"John, I didn't know you had a boyfriend." She says looking slightly uncomfortable as she shifts on her chair. "So, how did you two meet?"
“Mistake, John.” Sherlock says standing and moving to sit next to him on the bed. He lauded back against the wall beside his bed looking at John disappointedly
John looked over at the noise of it hitting the ground surprised to see Sherlock with his hands over his face. He was rubbing his hand over his face and hair as if trying to wash something off.
"I-I don't know. I only noticed it when my sleeve came up.. what is it?" John asked curiously though cautious he looked at the blinking in his arm. Sherlock looked at it and prodded at it slightly trying to figure out what it was, when he shifted slightly to see it in the sun it blinked faster.
“Everything will be fine, brother mine.” Mycroft said softly seeing the tension in Sherlock’s frame.
"I don't care how you deal with it just get it done." Sherlock snapped his patience wearing extremely thin at this ridiculous conversation.
John almost smiles at the thought. A detective, it's what he needs and Sherlock just so happens to be one. Sometimes it's funny how fate works and John almost wishes he didn't have to expose him to this, to the madness.
Weeks later, an ordinary day in Baker Street but one that held firm in Sherlock's mind, in his prison. Sherlock was injured in the previous case of the day and John had him on the couch as he patched him up. It was the first time they were ever so close, lingering touches and meaningful gazes. John reprimanded him for being so foolish but he said it so fondly Sherlock didn’t mind.
“I don’t know why you don’t like him.” Molly huffed falling back on her bed and lifting the magazine back up to her face.
John felt his heart practically jump into his throat at the thought of what Sherlock must be going through. Especially since it seemed they were more than just friends, lovers or perhaps even married. Though neither of them had a ring.
"It's alright dear. I'm sure John would like a friend. You go see him, just make sure you tell Terry before heading over so she can tell you how good he's doing that day."
The next morning was dull to Sherlock, Mrs Hudson came in and checked him over. He asked for morphine, she said no, he asked for cocaine, she said no, in a last attempt he asked for a cigarette, she smacked him upside the head and left. ‘Still wasn’t a no’ he had yelled back at her, she didn’t seem to care.
"As much as I wish I didn't have to say it dear brother, John should return to hospital. As should you." Mycroft said pointedly leaving his hand on John's arm.
He knew Moriarty was one to play dirty -not just in light of recent events- and he wouldn’t be foolish enough to go into this thinking it was safe. Nothing really was safe, not anymore. Everything was to be questioned and nothing left to chance, not with the criminal still active. Not even to mention what he had done already.
"Coming." John grumbled binning his cup of disgustingness and walking over. The body was odd. By odd he meant dead. Obviously.
Sherlock sits there tracing the marks on John’s hands that hold his whole life story until eventually John falls asleep. Sherlock watches him sleep peacefully on his shoulder and couldn’t help but feel so incredibly lucky to even have met John let alone be -as odd as it sounds- his boyfriend.
“So it seems.” John murmurs quietly, thinking. “I’m happy he’s here with Sherlock, he needs him. He’s a good guy.”
Clearly John wasn't at that stage yet and Sherlock would have fun embarrassing him. It was partly to get his mind off the fact of his cousin, which it would.
John didn’t like feelings either, not really. Sherlock was right. They were messy and difficult and profoundly hard to get anything done with all those things going on, maybe that's why he felt so numb and empty now. He didn’t need to feel. Feeling was useless anyway it just got in the way of solving the mystery.
Sherlock stays holding John close to his chest as one of the nurses injects him with a sedative. Sherlock holds him until his cries turn to whimpers and eventually the sedative takes over and he’s asleep in his arms, that’s when he’s asked to leave.
“Don’t give me that, it’s not true and you know it. Tell me why you really did it.” John said crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at him.
Sherlock backed away looking behind him over the railing at the storm. Sherlock grabbed John's hand and they were running again, this time without the threat upon their lives but from the downpour. When they did make it home they both shook off the rain they could and then took turns showering. Sherlock showered first so John could start up a fire, they were lucky Mrs Hudson had moved the firewood into 221C instead of in the alleyway like she usually did. Sherlock came out in his usual nightly attire and they switched, Sherlock to the fire and John to the shower. After John had showered he discovered Sherlock had taken all the blankets and pillows and made an almost bed like structure in front of the blazing hearth.
“Wake up.” John said with his voice of silk as he brushes a hand through Sherlocks curls cupping the side of his face. He watched him softly with an expression of adoring, his eyes a deep blue that reminded Sherlock of the ocean.
“Talk to me.” Sherlock said softly moving his hands comfortingly up and down Johns back. “I want to help.”
"Silly tradition, there is no real point to it anyway." Sherlock smiled softly at John who giggled a bit at the statement. They looked deep into each other's eyes practically feeling the love pouring from them.
“Where are we going anyway?” John asked also looking around to see what he was searching for. Deeming it a lost cause he looked back up to Sherlock.
“Oh yeah and what do have to ‘offer’ him huh?” She asked sitting up glaring at him, he turns to her and looks at her as if she were an idiot.
She threw a pillow at his head, he thought about flipping her off but then he realized she wouldn’t be able to see it.
Sherlock had seen the pictures in John's file scanned over them briefly. He knew the second he saw her face.
When they could no longer see him they closed the door and fell against it sliding down to sit on the floor.
Inside the room John hides his face in his pillow and brings his arms up to cover his ears. Sherlock just had to keep him up late and now he had to wake him up early as well. He just didn't understand that John had to get a normal amounts of sleep unlike some people.
“It’s close enough.” Sherlock shrugged and they both smiled. When the soft smiles faded from their faces Lestrade handed over the case file.
They parted ways without a word, there was no need for anything further. The work was done, information acquired and Sherlock was on the run yet again. He went to his hotel room checking it to make sure he was alone first before pulling his totem out of his pocket.
It was overly domestic and completely public they didn't care who saw. Lestrade continued to pester them relentlessly but they didn't have a word for their relationship. How could they possible label something so pure and perfect.
“What..?” Lestrade asked in disbelief as he stared at the last picture. Mycroft looked at it curiously as if it wasn’t like John was getting progressively younger but specimen under a microscope.
His eyes were so adjusted to the dark grays of the room he could see his vision going patchy. Blotches of dark slowly crawling up around him, if he hadn’t been feeling claustrophobic before this he certainly was now. A new wave of panic rolled over him, adrenaline bursts pushing back the dark momentarily.
Sherlock closed his own eyes and instead of the black that he expected to see, a blinding white clouds his vision and he’s unable to see anything but that. There’s so much white and he suddenly feels faint as he opens his eyes to see the world crumbling away and there’s nothing but the white surrounding him.
“Oh, alright.” John replied still not entirely understanding when an idea came to mind. “You know you could come with me?” He said quietly looking out to the snow.
Kisses on foreheads, hands in hair, heads on shoulders, hands in hands, food fed to each other and long snogging sessions followed by nights entangled together in Sherlock's large bed. Never really going that far but just content with being in each other's presence.
“First time it was a girl though she identified as a boy.. I’m more attracted to men though. I’ve done both once of that answers your question.” Sherlock explains, neither of them were entirely pleasant and he was high as a kite for the second. He was told it was better with the person you truly loved and perhaps he’d find out if that was true, if they ever got to that point.
John shook Sherlock as gently as he could to not disturb his wounds but he had to wake up. He tried his best to wake him while keeping from opening his wounds further but it just wasn’t working.
“He did.” Moriarty snaps protective of Sebastian's memory and not allowing it to be tarnished by someone who knew nothing. “You wouldn’t know.”
Greg lifted a fist, shaky and weak dropping it against the doors one last time as he could manage. His hand only falling back beside him lifelessly. The sound resonated in the small room, he had only assumed it to be a closet of sorts. Echoing back to his ears over and over like the sound was mocking him. Truly telling him he would not escape this prison alive. For if the sound could not escape, how could he?
Sherlock slammed his car door shut and ran inside quickly, scanning his student ID card at the door. He ran up the many steps to the fourth floor where their rooms were. He heard what sounded like yelling as he came closer to the rooms and coming to stand in front of John's room.
“Why not a wot, wike me?” John asks rubbing at his eyes with a small closed fist looking to be about the cutest thing in the world.
John stared for a moment waiting for an emotion to take over and overflow his features. Nothing came for a short time and Sherlock rubbed Johns back gently in an attempt to make him feel even just a slight bit better. It took a moment but John's features settled to something of determination although there was a saddened tone to the underside. He wasn’t an absentminded child and despite being the young age that he was he was still rather intelligent and empathetic more than anything, recognizing the difficult situation as it was for Sherlock.
With the sound of a door slamming the apartment building lapsed into silence. Quiet footsteps slowly made their way down the hall and the stairs. Sherlock sat counting in his head for three minutes before jumping up and heading for the door.
Sherlock hummed lightly touching another one of the pictures that also had the sticky substance over it.
"Yes that's what I said." Sherlock looks at John a moment taking in his expression. "Unless of course you don't-"
Sherlock picked John back up resting him on his hip and went to the door grabbing his phone off the bed as he goes and pocketing it. He sighs quietly steeling himself for what he was about to face.
“Would you stop bringing that up?” Sherlock said dramatically with a roll of his eyes. “It was hideous, you said so yourself. You should be thanking me for getting rid of it.”
John lay in bed drowsily rubbing his eyes in the early morning. John rolled onto his back throwing the covers off of him. It was late March and the heat was rolling in as well as the rain and it made a mix of unfortunate humidity.
"My mother was a drunk, as good as she was a mother- -when she wasn't passed out- -she was still an undeniable drunk and an absent minded parent. Sometimes she'd disappear go who knows where and show up again a day later like nothing happened. When she disappeared that day we thought that was all it was, until she didn't come back.
"You don't worry dear, I won't tell him." She really was a saint, if Mycroft stuck his fat nose in this He'd start asking questions Sherlock didn't know the answer to himself.
“Hey the walls are thin.” John defended chuckling lightly. “Though I wouldn’t mind if you got jealous it would suit you I’m sure.”
He hoped Molly didn’t take the news too badly, he still wanted to be able to work with her and be her friend. For now he could only wait and see.
They both hit the ground at a high speed as the ground shook around them, Greg rolled putting himself over Mycroft to protect him as debris fell around them.
"You know we all had our suspicions but after that stunt you pulled at the Landers case I figured-" Lestrade said grinning oddly that just succeeded in pissing Sherlock off more.
"I'm only saying it's nice to know where we are going after this is over." Sherlock argued wild hand gestures flying everywhere.
“Tell me, do you have the time of how long it’d take before you’d run out of oxygen?” Sherlock took a breath slowly and nodded as carefully as he could, otherwise staying still.
Sherlock looked over and there he was, standing there as if he hadn’t been there just a moment before. Staring out over the waters edge and after a moment glancing to Sherlocks direction. It was perfect, Sherlocks creation of John in his mind. There was no way anyone could tell him apart from anyone else.
Sherlock didn't know where John was otherwise he'd drive to him right now. He didn't want that weird drummer to be around John, he didn't want him to be around Molly either but that wasn't going to change anytime soon. Sherlock didn't know what it was about the man that put up so many red flags to him. He was just too perfected, without a flaw as if someone went over his life with an airbrush.
"So your a singer that's studying to be a doctor?" Molly asked confused as she bites into a candy bar that definitely would have melted.
surprised at his abrupt wording that he hardly ever used. Sherlock was far too sophisticated. Or at least he thought he was.
"Well, this isn't what I wanted to do, it never was. It was the best way to make money at the time to get Dad into the hospital and Harry away from that crazy woman she was going out with." John explains muttering the last bit, lightning sticks outside.
The yelling was even louder in his and Molly's room, coming through the thin walls as if the people yelling were in the room. Molly was on her bed and looked to him in confusion Sherlock just shrugged and fell to his bed.
“Oh sorry but do you see it, it’s amazing!” She whispered yelled doing little circles looking at everything. “And we get to be here at the same time as Johnathan Watson! Do you think we’ll meet him!? Oh my goodness I don’t know what I’d do! And do-“
“He wouldn’t want me to leave you alone.” Mycroft commented although he wasn’t pushing by any means, he didn’t dare. Not now anyway, any other time he definitely would have pulled his hand. Certainly not now though.
"No, still have to determine something." Sherlock helped lifting John up, then in a flourish started running down an alleyway. "Be back in a moment!" He called back. How he didn't trip is a miracle in itself.
“Oh, I almost forgot. I grabbed a few more things.” Lestrade said as lifted his abandoned briefcase onto the bed then searched through it. He pulled out plastic containers of takeaway and a case file, Johns case file. Sherlock reaches for it but Lestrade snatched it away so Sherlock scowls up at him from his place on the bed.
“Whatever.” Moly made a frustrated noise -quite like Mycrofts but more of a growl- and continued putting clothes away in an angry silence.
“John.” He heard Sherlock’s baritone voice say softly yet commanding to be heard. John lifted his head to look into his entrancing eyes of blue and green. “Go to bed.”
“Hey, slow down. I can keep my feet under me but I can’t run yet.” He said chuckling nervously as he tried to get his bearings
"Why are you is intent on being privy to our private life?" He avoided the question and Lestrade took note of this.
“You have no idea.” Sherlock replied astonished and wanting to pass out. They heard a knocking sound coming from Jonathan's side.
"I've been wanting to talk to you without Shelrock here for a while by that hardly ever happens." Molly replied with an oddly suggestive smile.
"I did, very much actually." The relief in Sherlock's eyes was evident and John found it odd that he suddenly cared about another's opinion. "Just wondering, why? Not that I mind or anything but you usually avoid cooking like the plague. What changed?"
“Sherlock.” John said to get his attention and his head snapped up toward him. John came over to him and handed him tea glancing at the map on the wall with many pins sticking out of it. “Anything new?”
"Thank you, for bringing my family back together." John whispers into the embrace. Sherlock finds himself actually flushing like a teenage girl.
"We found one of the guys, Andrew Helton he's down at the station. I got you twenty minutes interrogation time." Lestrade internally sighed, they were both helpless.
“He wouldn’t trust anyone else with it only his number two.” Sherlock said already writing the name on the board.
"My cousin. My uncle and aunt's son, I always wondered why she left them. I figured it out almost as soon as I walked into the door. Any sane person would label my uncle abusive to substances and the people around him. My cousin as unstable and perhaps psychotic, but he's not." Sherlock leans forward his hands coming to his lips as he watches Johns carefully constructed expression. "He's smart and strikes with precision, every scenario thought out carefully. He knows where the edge is and how far to push someone without them falling over. He's not a maniac he's a genius with a short attention span and apparently you and I are interesting." John's expression quickly becomes angry. "We have to find him before he does something else."
"Mmm yes of course.." Sherlock muttered back still not paying attention as he walked through the street. John watched for few moments as the blinking on his arm started getting faster.
“Can I help, too?” Molly asks moving to the edge of her bed to give John her puppy dog eyes that according to her no man can resist.
“Of course, anytime.” Sherlock smiled softly at him before looking over at the kitchen sink where the pan lay. “Now, clean my pan.” He said with no heat and a grin, moving back.
Sherlock nodded wordlessly and looked to the window at the icy storm that went on outside. The snow was swirling upward in an almost tornado fashion even though it wasn't the right conditions for one.
“Yes but I have learned to ignore her you are incapable of that John.” He said going back to his writing as well.
Sherlock had to stop himself from hoping and step away from his computer as it calculated results, taking the rest of the time to thoroughly clean the kitchen up the rest of the way. When he came back to the computer the results still weren't calculated so he picked up around the flat as well and checked his computer again.
John woke up crying with a shout for Sherlock in the bedroom and Sherlock cursed his existence for failing once again. He grabbed a towel and cleans up himself quickly before going to the bedroom to John.
“A week?!” Sherlock asked incredulously and sat up straight, Mycroft pushed him right back down again as the pain came.
"I'll tell you when we get home." He said dismissively as he pulled John along and walked quickly as possible without seeming suspicious.
"Do you think I'll ever get out of here?" John asked as they were walking back to their rooms. Sherlock was in front of him now walking backwards as John steered him away from obstacles. He was getting tired and weak so Sherlock had to be more supportive of him in the front.
“So why wait? Are you really so bored as to sit here and wait for me to die?” Sherlock asked straight out, he wasn’t entirely sure why it mattered that he was asking. He was alone here, the police had checked the area before they had arrived, there wasn’t anyone coming for quite some time and Moriarty would make sure he didn’t make it out of this situation alive. Not that he thought he would be able to anyway.
“It’s best to, before he does anything else.” Sherlock looked at John’s seemily beaten expression. “You can stay-” Sherlock offered quietly after a moment.
“I don’t care, leave me. You duty is done now go away and bother that boyfriend if yours.” Mycroft made an unrefined huffing noise and left. Sherlock smirked to himself from his place on his bed.
"'What're' is not a proper word try again." Sherlock reprimands him lightly leaning against the counter waiting for the water to boil. He's not sure when he started caring about grammar but it seemed important.
“Of course I did.” Sherlock says amiably smiling at him just glad that he was okay. “I always keep my promises and you don’t forget that, alright?”
"John Watson, you are the love of my life and I couldn't imagine living my life without your presence by my side. Although I cannot say when our relationship truly began I can say that we were meant to be together. I don't believe in fate or soulmates I hardly believe in luck and yet I find myself having the best fate in meeting you, becoming the luckiest for being able to love you and calling you my soulmate. I'm hardly proved wrong and usually not happy about it but today, I am extremely pleased I am wrong." John was crying his left hand in Sherlock and his right on Sherlock's heart. Sherlock lifted his own hand wiped away John's tears with his own threatening to spill. "Would you do me the honor of confirming this theory and becoming my husband?"
“You can’t just tell me now?” Molly asks extremely curious now especially to why Sherlock was acting so odd.
“You’ve always been so weak..” he snarled at him, following him until he was backed into a corner. “You couldn’t even stay for me.”
"Are you going to just quit being a musician?" Sherlock asks quietly after a few moments and John looks up to watch his expression.
“Wake him up? Yes I do think so.” Sherlock opened the door and pushed him in then closed it and walked off. Of course he wouldn’t stay the whole thing would be an emotional mess and he didn’t need that. So Sherlock took a walk while they did their thing he took the time to think in depth going into his mind while he walked aimlessly.
Mycroft nods and exits the room swiftly without another word, leaving the two alone once more. Sherlock closes his eyes dropping his head back against the headboard with a sigh. Just two weeks to try and figure this out.
"I know. What do you have?" Sherlock avoiding the subject getting back into being the detective again.
“I’m sorry.” He continues to apologize, over and over again. He had so much he needed to apologize for. For not being able to help him and allowing this to happen for not being strong enough to keep this from happening.
“Because this is a lot more personal than you seem to think. Because when I found him he was just as much of an abandoned kid as you were when we first met. Because I solved his parents murder and imprisoned his uncle. Because l let him stay in my house after he got out of the hospital. Because every night he had a nightmare I let him stay in my bed. Because every time he woke up screaming for his father I was there to be that for him. Because when they took him away I didn’t stop them. Because when that son of a bitch broke out I didn’t get there in time. That’s why it matters.” He took a breath and cleared his throat. “My rules, got it?”
He shook himself from his thoughts and carefully packaged the correct serum, making sure it was entirely safe and secure before tucking it in his coat pocket. Quickly grabbing his phone to inform his brother of his discovery and demand John to be brought back.
“You need to calm down even if we do meet him if your freaking out like this he won’t want to talk to you.” That shut her up really fast. “So your good now?”
"Hmm?" Sherlock replied disinterestedly thinking of ways to kill Lestrade and his brother along with Moran. He'd make it look like an accident.
“No. Stop you right there. I don’t need an out, I've only been here one day I can suffer through at least one more then i'll ask. I need a case a specific one.”
“I am.. I’m just working right now.” Sherlock said despite himself, his tone was only getting softer. This figure was so much like his John, as it always was. The aching never fading from his battered chest, even in this state he wore the scars.
“Who?” Sherlock snips half heartedly only hearing a sigh on the other end as he leans against the window. John always hated it when he did that.
"Maggie Dunn, lovely I know." Sherlock just hummed and continued picking at the wood. "So the women?"
"You know the only reason I'm here is to be a third wheel." She said as if it was obvious which confused John more.
John is crying before Sherlock takes his first step and he feels himself break into a million pieces at the sounds coming from his small form. Sounds that he caused, he just wanted to help and protect him but right now he wasn’t doing either of those things.
He walked forward and up the stairs slowly one by one until he made it to the door and pushed it open. It creaked familiarly and revealed the hollow flat. Silence enveloped him so entirely his heart felt it might just burst from it.
"I really do hate repeating myself John but you can go to bed. I need to finish this." Sherlock says as he studies the map in front of him pinned to the wall -with what looks to be a needle-. John leans into his side placing his head on his shoulder and wrapping his arms around his other one.
There wasn't a point to words when actions were much better and without a care in the world they fell asleep.
“Don’t!” He shouted and pressed the gun to Sherlocks forehead. “You don’t get to convince me.. you’ve run out of chances.”
“I would say I’m surprised but, well, how could I be.” The man drawled as he entered the room, door slamming shut behind him. He pulled over a chair to sit by Sherlock’s bedside the chair screeching on the floor in the silence.
Basked in the soft blue moonlight there stood John looking as if he were frozen in time by his stillness. His breathing coming out in small white puffs into the cold room with fluttering photographs only a few steps ahead of them. John’s eyes were blown wide, transfixed on the papers in front of them, gently swaying in the wind.
“Alright I’m coming.” Sherlock chuckles following him quickly as John rushes through the halls to get back to his room. John grins and starts to run pulling Sherlock along with him as they run through the halls, dodging people as they go.
"Hmm." John hummed as he poked Sherlock's side. Sherlock opened his mouth obediently as John put food into his mouth. After their conversation last week Sherlock had been a lot more perceptive to Johns needs and had been doing most things John asked him.
I sincerely apologize for not posting for so long! I got this new app Animo and it’s very addictive! Anyway I hope you enjoy this long overdue chapter!
“So I hang and John finds me.” He prompted, he was biding his time to some extent. Maybe just prolonging his suffering but any time he had left and the possibility that he might get away from this with his pulse intact he’d need all the information he could get.
“He’s really cute you know.” Molly said dreamily once again staring at John. This time they were sat in a seminar that everyone was required to take. Neither of them were listening.
John shook his head slightly to clear the thought from his mind. He rubbed his eyes tiredly as he stared at Sherlock, yawning quietly. He looked peaceful, tranquil with a perfect facade of calm. John’s eyes slowly drifted lower falling to the floor as they slowly closed, his mind slowing as well.
“You came back..” John said as the man pushed him into a sitting position, the bandages on his arms pulling at his wounds. The man pulled his legs off the bed and grabbed his shoulders to hold him up.
The rough translation of which he could supply to his brother and Greg would be that John was being held at the power plant and to which they had better hurry in meeting him there. He offered no further explanation and no further was demanded of him.
"It is isn't it. We'll be right in the front and everything." As Molly flipped out Sherlock sat grinning, wondering about what he was going to wear.
John nods and watches him a while but eventually getting bored and went back to the living room and sat on the couch, thinking.
"New Mexico, and I don't mean that as a cliche. In fact a number of ten so far missing parents or spouses in similar circumstances disappeared to New Mexico. This is because the gang 'El Toro De Fuego' is recruiting men and women well informed with cars. Reasons for taking out money probably buying a vehicle and disappearing randomly she didn't want to get a criminal record. It's rather simple when you think of the facts."
"Why? Why would I have this in me? How? I don't understand-" he starts to panic and Sherlock looks him in the eye sternly for a moment and John keeps his turmoil to himself.
After about two minutes of inner turmoil Sherlock threw the box across the room and flopped onto his bed. The patches were all over the room now taunting him. Maybe he'd visit John, he always seemed to make him forget everything he was thinking.
“You asked if there is anything else you should know, I don’t like the dark. It doesn’t frighten me necessarily just sorta puts me on edge. I’m not exactly sure why. Um..” John thought for a moment before looking up to him grinning slightly. “I’m allergic to strawberries, if that is of any importance.”
Sherlock turns to John and places the tomatoes on his cutting board then placing his chin on John shoulder from behind. John stands there in shock, embarrassment and a rising amount of anger.
“What, with what. From the marks on John’s forearm a needle what was in it we couldn’t know without extensive bloodwork.” Sherlock says already not liking the idea.
"I really have to spell it out don't I? Do you fancy him?" Molly says slow and precise like she was talking to a toddler.
“One of Jim’s friends.” John said stepping forward as well beside him pointing to one of the pictures. “This is Sebastian and this is James.” He explained first pointing to the blond haired boy then the darker haired one.
"-and the bridge by greenway. That's it." John reads from a list to Sherlock who puts pins on the map. "Can we go to bed now?"
Sherlock watches him a moment the familiar jut of his lip reminding him of whenever John would try and hide how he was upset with him. He could always tell by just the small bit his lips seemed to stick out more then normal, John could ever lie to him anyway.
He left alone again and back in the hotel he felt strange, he felt lifted and yet weighed down. He pulled out the dogtags after a moment before his phone went off, he returned them to his pocket and opened the message.
"Four days dead, froze, cut after, now can we go home?" John complained lifting an arm for Sherlock to pull him up. As annoying as he was Sherlock would still help him up off the ground, he understood the problem of John's leg pains and helped him. Occasionally.
“There are.. well- bad guys and I need to protect you. So-“ Sherlock attempted to explain trying not to falter with John's expression becoming more and more upset. “So, you’ll have to go stay with Mycroft for a while.”
“No, not at all, I’d love to.” Sherlock said quickly, almost frantic to stay by his side. John smiled reassured and Sherlock smiled tentatively back.
“John.” Sherlock's voice comes from the doorway and John swivels around in his chair to look at him. “Go wait in the hall I have to talk to Lestrade.”
Suddenly there were more voices that he could recognize, Mycroft. His voice seemed to be further away than John’s was, his was practically right in his ear while Mycroft’s seemed to float over his head. He realized it was possible he was sedated and coming around, he only hoped that’s what it was. If that was the case if he could signal someone to get him off the sedative he might be able to get out of whatever this was.
He tries not to think about it, taking up the clipboard again to keep himself and -more importantly- his brain occupied. His mind was a weapon right now full of poison and knives just waiting for him to touch and create a wound he couldn’t fix. He couldn’t afford that right now.
"You never asked specifically. Phrase your questions correctly." He adminoshes pulling out a pair of metal tongs and fishing the needle out of the water. He mentally curses himself, he sounded like Mycroft.
They arrived at the door and this time Greg goes first, pushing the door open and it creaks on its rusty hinges. He creeps inside looking around for possible traps but the darkness was difficult to see through.
"Sorry." He looked down abashedly and she just chuckled a bit bitterly and sat beside him on the bed. As she went about checking him over Sherlock figured it best to ask now.
"To your aunts, I thought that was fairly obvious." Sherlock says slipping into a cab and motioning John to join him. John mutters to himself, annoyed, as he closes the door and gets into the cab.
"She loved us both equally of course she did. A good parent wouldn't pick favorites. I remember going out with her and all kinds of stuff, Johnny hardly came out of the house. His head stuck in books all day." She replied sipping obnoxiously from a thermos filled with booze Sherlock could smell.
He lets his head roll to the side to see who is holding his hand in a vice grip and finds a man with a lean frame and black curly hair sitting in a chair by his side. The man is staring out the window beside him and the way the light bounces off his face makes his pale skin look almost translucent, beautifully so. The man turns towards him when he shifted slightly and John was surprised to see how gorgeous his eyes were. They were blue and green yet had a hint of almost gold that glinted in the moonlight from the window.
Sherlock pried his eyes open again a jumble of mixed colors coming into his sight that he couldn’t separate. Just as he couldn’t with the voices either, it came in as too much information that he couldn't find it in him to find meaning to. The voices seemed to become more hushed after he did so though so he knew that they had seen what he had done, that ruled out the being dead possibility. Head injury was becoming more and more likely.
"I'll go this way." Sherlock said pointing to his right and Greg nodded, turning to his left. Each man went into their room, the doors falling shut behind them and the slamming sound echoed down the hall.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand lightly watching Johns breathes float in white puffs into the space between them. He dared to look over turning a bit to see what was behind them that had made the noise. If it weren’t for the moonlight he wouldn’t have seen it, the shining blade beneath all the pictures.
He jumped up with a triumphant smile leaving his supplies in the hall and opened the door. John was curled up in bed on his side facing away from the door. When Sherlock rounded the bed and saw his face he couldn't help but think that John was adorable while sleeping. Loath as he was to do it Sherlock sat beside John and gently shook his arm to wake him.
“John Watson. I wouldn't be calling you if I knew what happened.” The silence on the other end was terrifying. “What? What, is it? Why are you silent?” He demanded, slightly panicked.
“Not right now, I have to see if it’s okay for me to bring you. My landlord is a bit strict.” Sebastian said he was uncertain that Jim would even be allowed to stay but he’d try.
"Sherlock, how is this not be my fault?" John said his voice raising on the verge of yelling. He stood angrily and started pacing back and forth. "I was the one to let him in the band in the first place, I didn't even put any of them on a contract because we were 'friends'. I was the one who stood on the sidelines as he corrupted all of them and didn't do a damn thing to stop them leaving. So tell me how could this possibly not be my fault?"
Sherlock's voice drifted into his ear and John glanced over at him as he continued walking, Sherlock kept pace with him floating gracefully beside him. He didn’t need to ask what he was referring to because he was in his head, he understood him perfectly.
“You interest me.” Sherlock thought for a moment trying to phrase this next part as John peered over at him. “You’ve changed me.” He looks over at John as well. “I’m not this nice, I’m not this stupid or mundane. I'm not this person."
"I knew Sherlock would figure it out and drag you into doing something stupid." Greg tutted shaking his head exasperatedly.
The Baskerville case, the fear running through Sherlocks veins as he desperately swung John's dogtags in his hand. John found him that way and the confusion and sympathy in his gaze. The kind words he said so softly and guided him to bed, never questioning, just as shakes himself and yet he cared for Sherlock instead. His steady weight on the bed beside Sherlocks hip, the gentle hand on his side allowing him to rest.
“We do not get on, anyhow they have decided to spend their Christmas in America and I have no intentions of following.”
"-Would absolutely love to." He says with dramatized glee as he walks with her into the kitchen. When they're out of view John groaned and put his hands over his face as he slouches into the couch.
"So his mind thinks he can't do what exactly?" He asked incredulously. How could the mind possible make bodily functions psychosomatic.
"No, I'm not leaving you alone." John said adamantly not letting Sherlock go off alone now, the only reference he had for this sort of thing was don't split up or you'll get caught.
The darkness is unexpected compared to the bright scenery of his dream and he soon realizes that’s all it was. He hazey wave of dread is now at the forefront of his mind as his eyes adjust and he finally is able to focus on what is around him once again.
The storm lasted all night but by the time the sun was up it had cleared. The power hadn't returned and classes were thankfully cancelled. News travels fast in their building and apparently lightning struck one of the power line poles and took down half the blocks power line poles as well. Everything had to be replaced and the work could take somewhere from two to four days. Or if you were Anderson three years.
"Sherlock, John is in Dublin." Molly complained coming out of the shower, as Sherlock started knocking on their wall.
"I'm not sure. Whatever he put in you we will fix though, I promise." Sherlock said stroking lightly at the bandage on John's inner elbow.
“Fine.” Sherlock agreed with a huff, moving a bit further into the papers looking at all of them trying to figure out what it meant. “You know what this is?”
“Sherlock.” John calls excitedly as he leaves the classroom practically running over to Sherlock his bags hanging from his shoulders. “Come on, come on!”
That was until he heard a voice he’d know anywhere, John. He could recognize his voice among thousands if he had to, it was stark and clear in his mind. More so than either of the other voices, what worried him was the tone John seemed to have. He seemed to be upset, it was an odd tone he wasn’t sure that he’d ever heard from him before.
Perhaps it was pure impulse or some kind of familiarity, mixed with muscle memory that caused John to slowly placed his free hand in the mop of dark raven curls. The man practically melted into the contact as John slowly sifted through the messy locks detangling and massaging his scalp as if he had done so a hundred times. At this point John wasn’t sure if he had or not.
John turned and left afterwards, he tried his best to leave Sherlocks ghost behind but it followed him all the way back to the hospital. Mycroft had suggested John spend some time away from Sherlock at the beginning of this when he refused to leave his bedside and wasn’t that funny now. It didn’t matter if he was away from him or not he was always with him in some capacity.
John chuckled as he placed his book on the floor next to his chair as Sherlock bounded up the stairs. Sherlock walked up to him and kissed his forehead again as if this was something they did daily. John just sort of blinked as Sherlock went to the kitchen.
The dogtags swung from their place hanging from the lampshade, back and forth slowly. But nothing mattered expept the two men and that’s how it should be.
When they arrived at Scotland Yard Sherlock pulled up John’s hood and they entered. John sighed happily to himself at the air conditioned building. He was also able to walk beside Sherlock now that he was forced to walk slower inside the building. They made their way into an elevator and up a few floors before arriving at an office.
“Why are you apologizing? We weren’t together then, you were allowed to sleep with whoever you wanted. Although I’d prefer if you didn’t now.” Sherlock says moving back to sit against the wall with him, joking slightly to lighten the mood.
“I always did say ‘Love can cure all ailments’ and they both do need it.” Terry replied as they continued cleaning surfaces.
“And you’re so bloody short.” Sherlock quipped back in the same tone kissing him again, letting his tongue invade John’s mouth.
“The utmost importance. Though that’s entirely fine by me, I’m not big on seafood.” John shrugged then pushed off the wall. “I have to head back for prep rehearsal, you should too. You’ll need the rest for Donavan’s lecture tomorrow.”
“Sorry.” Sherlock muttered looking over to the elevator then looking around for anyone who might rat them out.
“Tiwed.” John complains walking unsteadily closer to Sherlock leaning against his chest. Sherlock smiles softly at Johns pronunciation of his words finding it rather adorable.
“Yes I am. You can come in Mrs Hudson.” He replied softly still smiling like a mad man. Mrs Hudson let herself in closing the door quietly before walking over and sitting next to him.
When they were walking inside Sherlock realized John hadn’t let go of his hand. He blushed silently as they walked into the heated building, feeling John’s warm gloved hand in his own bare one. They walked for a while until they came to their rooms hallway. “So you don’t like snow, anything else I should know?”
“He’s gone now, you can stop hiding.” Sherlock says glancing over his shoulder at the small figure still huddled at his back. John nodded to himself and shuffled back in front of Sherlock who watched him curiously.
Harry’s house is half an hour away from anything resembling civilization. Damn her and her hippie love for the countryside. It’s all so calm and silent it makes me want to scream. JW
I have the vague suspect that my trustworthy doctor is drunk and that tomorrow morning he will regret every single thing he’s saying to me. SH
In my opinion all games of cards are extremely overvalued. People are obsessed by them because they can’t find anything more productive to do with their time. SH
He tries calling him again but no sound comes out of his mouth. Evidently it was just an exception due to desperate circumstances, but it's still a good start.
Try to circumnavigate the enormous rock called “literal sense” in the middle of the immense sea of nonsense that is your brain. SH
Celebrating Ricoletti’s imprisonment with all that brandy has significantly weakened your already poor mental faculties. SH
The day after, when Sherlock wakes up at three in the afternoon, he finds a note on his bedside table.
They’re having sexual intercourse, John. Your mention of games involving cards is just nonsensical. JW
Stop screaming! I’m at “work”, remember? The one in which I wear a white coat and interact with human beings with more or less real health problems. Calm the hell down. JW
Having provided himself with the same equipment, John starts writing something at a quick pace. After a few minutes he turns the notepad in his direction.
John thinks: “I miss him”, and it’s the first time he’s able to define their problem since he came back from the dead.
You always know everything, don’t you, Sherlock? You never miss one fucking thing. Do you want me to applaud you? Your hypertrophic ego must be desperately crying out for attention. JW
I did it while you were making tea. You were right: there are things that are definitely more boring. SH
He looks at him, firmly convinced not to believe his eyes. John is blushing but doesn’t break eye contact. He seems sure. Sincere.
But now I feel a curiosity I’ve never felt before. I want to touch you. And I want you to touch me, too. If you’re amenable. SH
Do process what I have told you, John: he’s come back earlier than predicted. And he’s currently in his bedroom. It’s impossible for me to get out without being seen. SH
The annoying thing is that they still understand each other with a look, but they have no way either to play it down or to change the subject anymore.
When he goes down the stairs, Sherlock is on the doorway. His eyes are open wide and he’s pressing both of his hands on his throat. The bottle of wine he just bought at Tesco lies in pieces at his feet.
Thank God a girl with chickenpox has arrived. An infectious disease is infinitely more pleasant than you. JW
Accusing me of screaming is wholly inappropriate, John, since we’re communicating through text messages. SH
Sherlock is absolutely certain that it’s a very difficult thing for John to do. He didn't want to touch him even with a word, when he came back, let alone with a whole hand.
I admit I didn’t believe that you would demonstrate yourself useful in these particular circumstances – but, as you keep reminding me, even I make mistakes sometimes. SH
I’m one hundred kilometers away from you. And I never wanted to play cards more in my whole life. JW
Both of them think that Mycroft knows, but strangely the English government doesn’t rub things in. He asks individual questions and then leaves Baker Street without a single word on the subject.
While he was completely immersed in the “game”, her right hand was slipping his diamond cuff links off his shirt. SH
Molly scratches a little gore from a bone and asks him with a shy smile: "How is John? I haven't talked to him for so long. "
Listen, I’m sorry. I didn’t understand what I was saying and I was drunk and lonely and pathetic. I’ll never do the same mistake again. I promise. JW
The one thing I know is that, before meeting you, the mere thought of touching my own body repelled me. But now… SH
Sherlock still deduces at the speed of sound; John patiently asks to describe symptoms as he always does.
The efficiency he puts in his experiments is at maximum level. Quick, precise, meticulous - more than he’s ever been, if such a thing is possible. Then he cleans everything up and tidies the whole kitchen.
Nothing transcendental. Between unpleasant and curious, I’d say, even if productive from the point of view of gathering useful data. SH
She’s fine now. The emergency consisted in a fall down the stairs, with consequent fracture of her right arm.
With my “second class job” we’re paying the electric bills that keep your precious microscope working. JW
I’m not. I’m merely making use of public data to strengthen what I’m saying. It’s very different. SH
Back home, Sherlock watches John barely make it in time to take off his coat before hitting the nearest notepad and writing a word madly.
You know, Sherlock, usually when a man is alone in his bed and he can’t fall asleep, he plays a game of patience to relax a bit. Take it as a piece of advice from your trustworthy doctor. JW
They’re in bed, in their pajamas. Sherlock is embracing John, who is writing with the notepad on the mattress.
He wonders if he should write that, during the three years of his death, he’d obsessively thought about him – about all of him, in excruciating detail.
Calm your voice, Sherlock. It’s four in the morning, I could very well be sleeping. It would be human. JW
Sherlock is lying deep in thought on the sofa when John steps into the sitting room, freshly cleaned and dressed. He’s holding a stationary bag in his hand.
At first, they don’t talk because they don’t want to. Two weeks after Sherlock’s resurrection, they don’t talk because they can’t anymore.
Truth to be told, things were like that even before the arrival of this incomprehensible damage, but at least communication was still possible. Not pleasurable, but possible: they weren’t forced to gesturing.
