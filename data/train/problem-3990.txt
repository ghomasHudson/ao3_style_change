He swallowed and returned to reality, giving Castiel a somewhat less-than-casual nod. “Sure, that’s how we always do it.”
Castiel wasn’t finished. His other hand, still resting near his shoulder, drifted back down Dean’s now-heaving sides. He ran his fingers almost reverently across his chest. “Anywhere else you can think of?” he teased.
“That’s right, Dean. Deeper and deeper.” Castiel scraped his nails through his hair. He felt his eyes flutter lightly at the sensation. God, everything Castiel did felt amazing, he made Dean feel so
Dean’s moan choked off into a sudden gasp, his hands flying up to grab at Castiel’s shoulders despite how loose his muscles had been only seconds before. He ground his hips into his partner’s hand as hard as he could and shook with both the effort and sensation. “Ohfuck…!” he cried. His eyes screwed even more tightly closed.
He realized that Castiel had been talking to him this whole time, but he couldn’t remember a single word he said. But that was fine. Everything was fine. Everything was
) and settle beside him, running soft fingers through the hair on his forehead. “Deeper and deeper, Dean.”
“Ninety-five…” he could barely make his lips form the words. “…deeperrrr… and deeper…” This time Dean would admit that he did whimper, but only because there was no other way to describe the sound that came out of his mouth. His eyes had closed sometime between the last two numbers, without him knowing exactly when. It didn’t matter. Not when he was feeling this floaty and hazy and warm. “Ninety-four… deeper…”
to pass out this late in the game despite the fact that Castiel clearly just liked tormenting Dean at every opportunity. He bucked and twitched in his partner’s grip, frantically chasing each and every sensation that he was being offered. He could feel Castiel responding much in the same, moving in small, purposeful ruts at Dean’s thigh.
that he simply didn’t have the resistance left to stop himself. Castiel had made a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts for him, because every time he sank down he found himself wanting to resist even less, and the less he resisted the deeper down he went.
had had the strings cut and he just couldn’t bother to hold himself up. Like his brains were just dribbling out of his ears and he couldn’t even muster up the energy to care. He felt warm and heavy and weak and so,
“So good for me, my good boy, so good…” Castiel gasped. He rested his chin on top of Dean’s head. “You can let it go, Dean… let it all fade into a warm glow and leave you feeling so, so good…”
Speaking of, he tuned back to the words Castiel was whispering. “You just keep sinking into the warm, quiet dark of your mind. My voice guides you deeper and deeper down as you feel everything just fall, fall, fall away into nothing. You’re floating in a sea of pure bliss and it feels so good.” Another warm stroke on his cheek. “Nothing can bother you here—no matter how stressful the real world is you know you can always melt down into this state of trance and let it all just drift away. You can just listen to my voice and let it bring you back into this wonderful, deep state of hypnosis. Isn’t that right, Dean?”
for a minute. Those were the nights where he didn’t have to worry about anything, just leaning back and letting the (almost literal) weight of the world slough of his shoulders for a little while, let his arms hang loosely against the edge of the tub. Dean wouldn’t have to focus on anything more complicated than breathing—just letting the steam rising up flow through his lungs in a simple in and out. In and out… in and out…
,’ he said once—letting the warm water start to run up his toes and ankles. A tingly warmth that would slowly run up his shins and calves, bleeding the tension out of the muscles through his skin. Sometimes Dean would actually be able to feel the heat, feel how it would move upwards as his body sank into the water.
Dean felt the tears trickling down his face as he shuddered, a soft whimper leaving his chest as he buried his face into Castiel’s brick-wall of a chest and tried to breathe. He let himself feel the overpowering wave of sadness and gave in to it. His shoulders shook with his sobs as he listened to Castiel’s voice and let the tones wash over his body. The larger man’s hand kept stroking gently in his hair, a soothing gesture that served to ground his body to the simple motion. Castiel kept murmuring quiet praise and soothing nothings to Dean. He let the tears soak into his shirt as Dean sniffled and wept quietly against him.
Dean blinked, realizing that the light he was staring at was not from the hot tub but from the TV on his bedroom wall. He realized that the hot tub he was sitting in wasn’t real, but an amalgamation of all the other ones he had experienced in his life. He wasn’t even in a hot tub in the first place and was, in fact, still half-laying on the pillows of his bed. Everything around him felt slow and murky, like he had just woken up but wasn’t fully ready to open his eyes and leave sleep behind. Everything was soft and warm and quiet…
Castiel instead grabbed the big tanned velvet chair in the room, dragging it behind him as if it was weightless. The legs of the chair stuttered against the carpet as the angel pulled it. He stopped right before Dean's knees, taking a seat in front of the human. "We should talk."
Cas let out a soft smile, leaning down to rub his nose against Dean's, "I rather miss living with you as well. Life on the road has been... unbearable."
"Nothing, baby. Everything's cool." Dean tugged Castiel over to the fridge. He kissed his angel's cheek in return. Cas smiled up at him all messy hair and kind eyes. He held his steaming mug of coffee in hand as he admired the man he loved. Dean stared back at his angel warmly before he looked to Sam. Pointing at Cas, he asked his brother, "Hey, Sam, it okay that we... uh, did that in front of you or is that an '
"I'm three, and you saw them at breakfast." Jack replied, "So, I want the Spiderman game, Apex, Red Dead 2, Assassin's Creed--"
"In the flesh. Loving this new vessel? It's vintage." Metatron grinned toothily at the boys from behind their new vessel. They twirled for a moment in their trendy blue yoga outfit, "Bet you didn't think I'd ever look this good in Lulu Lemon!" Metatron cackled, walking past them and into the living room. "Neither did Heaven. Life's got perks now. VIP tickets, a limitless black card, room service, deep tissue massages on demand, sex with bartenders in clawfoot bathtubs. This is the life. I don't know why I ever wanted to be the boss. All that back breaking labor. Yeesh. No, thank you. I was born to be a secretary."
"Maybe I can help." Jack walked up to Meta, sitting beside them on the big pink couch. The boy smiled, raising a hand in greeting, "Hello."
"Let me find the most accurate representation." Dean turned his back to the fridge, rifling through it for a moment while Sam started to laugh behind him. "Ahhh, yes! Mmm. Here we go," Dean grinned, turning around before slamming a zucchini down on the table in front of his brother. "It's that big."
Cas settled his hands on Dean's hips again. The hunter went around his shoulders, "We move side to side, and just sway into it. The drum hits eight times, so we sway every other hit. One two three four. One two three four." They swayed. Cas followed Dean's feet, watching his every step as he peered at the human's socks. Dean slid his arm from behind Cas's neck. He ran his thumb across his chin, lifting it up until Cas's blue eyes were gazing back at his. Dean said softly, "Don't be nervous. You're doing great."
They lay together under the quilts. It was quiet and calm. So warm. Dean's cheek snuggled into a silky blue tie and a white shirt. Cas's broad chest was the perfect pillow. Dean drifted back to sleep with the angel watching over him. Castiel held Dean close against his chest, eyes peeled for danger. Castiel made a vow years ago to keep Dean safe. And, he plans to do just that.
. I've repaired my relationship with Heaven. Saved it several times since we last spoke. They've come to trust me again." Castiel took another step forward. "My word is bond."
Dean nodded, taking it in, "Oh. Okay. I can work with that too. I'm real satisfied with our sensual relationship so far. We can keep it there."
What was most important was getting the world back in working order. And, that needs time, planning, and a safe haven.
. They wanted to pack up quickly and efficiently because Chuck had Jack's location. They had to scoot. Seriously. So, Castiel gave Dean "one last kiss" and pulled him up from the floor to get going. But every time they separated for more than a minute or so, they ended up all over each other again. Once they'd crossed that line, Dean and Castiel couldn't get enough of it. They kissed on the wall. The desk. The bed. The fridge. The kitchenette counter. The closet door, ironically.
Rowena waved her hands around her. "Ten years ago, Crowley went to an Yves Saint Laurent show at Paris fashion week and claimed 40 male models' souls in under an hour. Must have been a record. They just dropped into Hell a few months ago. It was literally raining men. Such fun! One of these days, you'll have to come down for tea."
Castiel kissed Dean deeply for a moment, fondness dripping from every press of their lips. He gave Dean a peck on the temple and patted his cheek, "Let's go save the world."
Dean chuckled, a sad, short lived thing, "They can handle that. I've got a lil date with myself and this bottle of Irish, so... kinda busy."
Dean struggled out, hand on his chest below his ribs, "Chuck knows where we're going. It's that damn book, Sam. I fucking told you."
Jack knocked again. "It's Jack. Me and my dads are here. We brought a few of my feathers. How do they work?"
"I'm exhausted and I just got out of a hot shower. That is the human equivalent of truth serum. Share any of this with anyone and I'm angel blading you. Especially Sam." Dean wagged his fingers in the air. "Actually, telling Sam gets you
Meta looked back to Jack. They shared a quiet moment before Meta spoke up again, "You're nothing like your dad, are you?"
While Cas was upstairs getting their toddler ready, Dean had been pleading his case. He wasted no time fighting for his angel. As soon as Amara and Billie showed up, he told them everything. Then, of course, he got cocky and threatened to walk out of the Chuck fight if they didn't help, which ultimately fuelled their call to action. Cas doesn't need to know about the last part though. Dean can already feel the angel rolling his eyes and doing his trademark deep, unimpressed sigh of disappointment at his human's recklessness.
Dean opened the door and smiled, instantly smelling the hot conveyor belt of sweet fresh doughnuts and coffee. He closed his eyes and took in the scent.
Jack made the biggest cone he could, constructing it from all the bubbles available. It was going to be so big. Huge.
Dean added, "The moment we drive out of city lines tomorrow, he'll be on us. Hopefully Jack will be enough to cover our asses from Vegas to Tijuana."
Meanwhile, Castiel sat hunched over the kitchen table aggressively grating a large russet into oblivion and avoiding eye contact at all costs. Dean doesn't necessarily know how they got here, but he felt let down. If only Sam didn't walk in...
The angel kissed him back, holding the human still with his strong hands on his jaw. Then he pushed Dean down with a strong hand on his chest. He said sternly. "Would you rather I ask for what I want?"
"I know. We can choose some of them to enhance your outfit any way you like. Grown up clothes may be 'stupid', but they don't have to be boring." Castiel ran his thumb under Jack's eye, clearing the tears from his son's cheeks. "Compromise. How does that sound to you?"
Amara popped up, padding across the carpet barefoot. Her black nightgown and dramatic pink robe fluttered across the floor as she walked right over to the rift, heading in. "BRB."
Castiel glared, "Jackson Kline Winchester, I swear to you, if you put that godforsaken app on my phone, I will throw it into the abyss."
Dean backed down quickly, slowing his steps for a second and raising his palms in surrender, "Okay. I get it. You're a big boy. You do what you want."
Jack understood more about why he was this way when he and Cas met. Before Castiel's resurrection, Dean had been cruel and distant and incredibly self destructive. He fought and yelled when he was upright, and he drank and cried when he sat. Jack had wrongly assumed Dean never knew happiness, that he was a stormy cloud and that's all he could be. Then, Castiel came back and that weeping drunk became the sweetest thing Jack had seen in his life.
Castiel's head popped up. Between Jack and Amara, Castiel startled at the mention of The Empty. It's name evoked fear in the angel whether he wanted it to or not. He looked over at Billie patiently as she cleared her throat.
He tossed the bag back down on the floor and hissed. Dean promised himself years ago, he'd never tell a soul about his partiality to tiny flirty panties. Victoria's got her Secrets and Dean has his, but at the end of the day Cas is too honest. He can't know about this.
"Dick." Dean laughed out as he looked out at the sky for a long moment before turning his head to the angel.
He was rooming with Sam. Period. Cas and Jack can hang out together and do whatever it is angels do, while the brothers rock-paper-scissor to see who's stuck with the couch pullout tonight.
Jack added, "And I gotta clean my room. There's feathers everywhere. Maybe I can hang out with Sam after I finish that."
Blue eyes shone through a gummy smile. Dean felt so warm and glowy in his chest. It felt so good, Dean pushed him. Cas pushed him back, sending Dean's heart flying into the counter. The angel set the potatoes down on the counter and picked up the ladle, walking it to the sink and giving it soap and water. Cas washed it. Then he held it hostage and asked to make one pancake. Dammit all, Dean let him. He kept a close watch and walked Cas through every step. The angel gave it a level of concentration usually designated to bomb diffusion. The pancake turned out surprisingly well. Castiel decided to slide it onto Jack's plate under two of Dean's bigger pancakes. Cas wanted their son to have it. Judging from Jack's initial reaction at his first taste, their teamwork paid off.
Castiel stated into the wheat field, "You didn't make him cry, Dean. He was buried under the weight of his sins. I thought you'd be able to relate."
The cashier shrugged simply. "All those smiles you sent me during my shift were sweet. You didn't have to do that either. Most people don't."
The living plushie stretched it's arms out to hug Jack. The nephil hugged the tiger toy and smiled up at his dad as Castiel ruffled his hair. The angel turned back to the living room, letting him know about dinner before closing his bedroom door. Dean continued back down the stairs, hearing the tell tale sound of boots on metal above him. He stalled by the glass table. Looking out of the window to the storm, Dean felt humbled by the rain.
It was worth it, though, to see the soft smile Castiel still had for him. “Good boy, Dean,” he whispered, running a thumb over his knuckles in a soothing gesture. “So good for me. Do you think you can do one more thing for me, good boy? Just this last thing.”
“I… okay, that’s kind of a cool idea,” Dean conceded. “And you’re gonna use me as your test subject?”
Dean shook his head again and decided to answer his first question: Eyes open or closed? Dean had learned that he didn’t really have much of a preference for either option; both methods led to the same result, and both were fun in their own right. Eyes closed meant the induction was slower, with Castiel taking his time to describe exactly what his body was feeling. How each breath could be felt all the way down to his toes, how his skin would tingle, how he could sink down into the mattress or chair or couch while Castiel talked. Those inductions were incredibly relaxing, he had to admit. Probably closer to an actual guided meditation than hypnosis.
Dean’s moan turned into a howl of pure bliss as he felt himself tip over into orgasm. He clutched desperately at Castiel’s shoulders and buried his face in the crook of his neck as he felt his climax start at the very tip of his cock and spread through the entirety of his body; shooting up to his scalp, a burst of fireworks from the impact in his skull as it showered down his neck, his chest, tingling down to his fingers and melting into the tips of his toes. He bore down hard into Castiel’s hand, feeling his dick throb and twitch, once, twice, three times as he came
Dean was also glad. He gasped and lazily bucked his hips against Castiel’s leg, where it was positioned between his own. This deep in trance Dean really didn’t have a lot of coordination with his body, sometimes barely able to even gather enough energy to make a fist. Often, he just let Castiel maneuver his body however he wished, either with his hands or with a soft-spoken command. Tonight, however, Dean was worked up enough to roll his hips clumsily and press open-mouthed kisses against Castiel’s neck. He let out a quiet moan. “Cas…”
Castiel didn’t answer him immediately. Instead he occupied himself by nibbling at Dean’s earlobe and continuing to run his hands across Dean’s body, moving from his back to his sides. They rubbed in alternating directions, one up towards his shoulder and the other down towards his right hip. He ran his thumb in a circle on his waist, both soothing and teasing, and left it there. “What does my touch do to you, Dean?”
“so good…” Dean felt himself shiver again, leaning further into Castiel’s palm to seek the contact. God, he felt “…so good…”
one more time, but he had simply lost the strength in his body to do so. All he could muster was a soft grunt from his throat. He felt himself lean heavily into Castiel’s hands, unable to resist. The whole world had gained a soft, muted fuzz around him; he could feel a nice tingling feeling spreading through his body from his chest to his fingertips, something he felt only when he was falling asleep at night. He felt almost completely detached from himself, to the point where he wasn’t sure where his body ended and where the bed began. The only thing he had any full awareness of was the hands on his face and neck, barely anchoring him to the real world and Castiel’s words.
Another sweep of Castiel’s thumb. “So good for me, Dean,” he said. He ran his hands back up and down Dean’s sides again. Twin blazes of arousal erupted from the points of contact, teasing at Dean’s nerve endings before rolling down to join the first spark of heat in Dean’s belly.
Dean felt Castiel burrow his nose into his hair and let out a deep sigh of his own. “Feeling better now, Dean?”
“Nuh,” Dean grunted. No way he was leaving this trance by choice—he would ride it out until he woke up naturally in the morning. “…deeper n’ deeper…” he heard himself say softly.
His legs shook from the effort of holding himself up on his knees. Dean’s howl turned into a scream and then a gasping sob. He felt his whole body start to tremble as Castiel kept
Dean’s eyes started to roll back, but he tried his best to keep them focused on Castiel’s face. He liked seeing the soft, fond look on his face. How it glowed with affection when Dean followed his commands. He gave another smile of his own, although it immediately dropped as he sank a little further down into his trance. “Ninety-seve… ninety-six…” He let out a deep breath at his own correction, already feeling the numbers slipping from his mind like sand. “…deeper… and deeper….”
He Castiel run his fingers through his hair, leaving his hand where Dean’s neck met his shoulder. His hand felt so warm. “So good for me, Dean,” he murmured. “So calm, so quiet, so wonderfully heavy and lazy as you go deeper down.”
“So good, Dean. Feeling eyes get heavier with each number, feeling your body sinking into the fuzzy haze of hypnosis.”
“That’s right, Dean. It feels so good to sink like this. Nice and deep and warm.” Another stroke on his cheek. “Can you tell me what happens when you feel this good?”
whimper at that suggestion, despite how tired and relaxed he was. Instead he dragged his body back up like Castiel told him to, swaying a bit with the effort to keep his muscles simultaneously tensed and relaxed. He could barely find the willpower to turn his face towards his partner and look at him.
Castiel’s hand brushed over his forehead, cupping his face and stroking a thumb over his cheek. Dean’s face relaxed at the contact. “And how does it feel, Dean?”
“Good boy,” Castiel whispered. He lapsed into a moment of silence, Dean feeling him run his hands along his back and listen to his relaxed breaths. “I want you to tell me what you’re feeling now, Dean.”
out of Dean—by the time he was mind-numbingly bored and totally zoned out of the conversation Castiel would start slipping suggestions into his mind without him knowing at first (which was freaky as shit). Or when he was feeling like taking his time, Castiel would tell Dean how to relax every part of his body, one by one, before falling into trance.
Castiel let out a low huff and gathered Dean to his chest. Dean felt his head get tucked under Castiel’s chin, so his nose was brushing against the larger man’s collarbone. He wormed his leg between Dean’s and hooked an ankle around the other’s. Warm, soft hands ran soothingly up and down his arms. “You did so good for me, Dean, you did incredible. So, so good. Always so good for me...” He continued to babble praise into Dean’s hair, stopping only to press gentle lips to his head before picking up again.
to be naked, but the first step of getting hypnotized was to get comfortable, and what could be more comfortable than his birthday suit? That’s what he told himself, at least. He sat leaning up against the pillows near the headboard on top of the blankets, ankles crossed and hands on his lap, resolutely
Dean gave what had to be the slowest blink in the history of the world. “Ninety-eight… deeper and deeper…” He swayed heavily this time, having to forcefully jerk himself upright so he didn’t fall towards the floor. He knew Castiel would have caught him if he did fall, but Castiel had told him he had just enough strength to stay upright, and he wanted to prove that. “Nin… ninety-seven… deeper and deeper…”
He rubbed his thumb over Dean’s knuckles again. “Good boy, Dean.” He tapped the back of his hand. “I want you to start counting down for me, Dean, backwards from one hundred, and every time you say a number you can find yourself saying, ‘deeper and deeper.’ And each time you say a number, and each time you say, ‘deeper and deeper,’ you’ll find that every time you’ll go ten times deeper, a hundred times deeper, a thousand times deeper into trance…”
time it worked the way he wanted it to. Castiel could float for weeks on the high he got from watching Dean fall apart under his control.
Mind made up, Dean searched the wall in front of him for something to focus on. There were his weapons, a bunch of old dents that neither he nor Castiel and bothered to fix up, pictures of his family (ew, no, he didn’t want to stare at his family’s faces while he hypnotized himself and potentially got fucked into next week), a small mirror (even weirder, he didn’t want to stare at
“S-so good, Dean, so good,” Castiel growled in his ear, mouthing at the shell and panting hard. “Feel how good it feels to sink into this pleasure for me, how it feels to let this hypnotic bliss pull you down into ecstasy. So good for me, Dean, so good!” Castiel nibbled on his earlobe and ground his cock against Dean. “Just keep coming, keep coming, keep coming, coming, come, come, oh, just keep coming Dean oh, oh, oh fuck oh my, Dean!” Castiel let out a high whine and froze completely. His cock twitched against Dean’s thigh as he came in his jeans. Castiel groaned into Dean’s temple as he fell into his own orgasm. “Ohhhhhh fuck…!”
”I-I’m s-I’m sorry,” Dean stutters out trying to apologize for yelling like that “I didn’t mean to.”
"Haha, very funny. So were you happy to hear his voice after a couple of months of not seeing him or talking to him? I’m mean he is your crush after all." Sam tossed back to annoy him back
Finally, Castiel got up from the couch. They stretched and went to the kitchen to get a drink. Castiel’s knees popped when they took their first step. When Castiel finally got upstairs to bed the clock read 12:01 AM in angry red lettering.
This shocked Dean. He responded to Castiel’s sudden blunt response (but when has Cas been anything other than blunt) by questioning if they like them. Castiel replied with maybe trying to be cute, in their head they added extra “e” sounds to the maybe. Dean immediately questioned why Castiel liked him because to themselves he wasn’t anything special and thought that Cas deserves someone better than themself. It took Cas a minute to respond because they were shocked at how far Dean’s self-doubt when, but when they snapped out of their thoughts they started typing out why they like Dean.
“I told you I was-” trying to explain what he was doing when he was off in his head before Sam interrupted him so he could try to make the situation better.
"You just don’t want to talk about it because you know that I'm right about this. Also, you're terrible at hiding the truth about how you truly feel about Cas. Ever since he came back after the leviathans you’ve been all mushy and have been all worked up whenever he’s hurt or if he has done something wrong."
“Ok Cassie” Gabriel responded just before he ran out of the room to avoid getting things thrown at him for the nickname.
He knew it was true, the first time they met, the first time he looked in his deep blue eyes, the first words he spoke to him "I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.". Dean couldn't stop thinking about the angel, with his ocean blue eyes, his deep gravelly voice, his constipated face, and adorable head tilt. Dean was in love. He just doesn't know when he will break his lust for him.
The DM was just the person asking Castiel if they could be friends. They like any good human would do accepted the request to be friends with a warning that they tend to get extremely annoying. Dean said that it was fine but they will give you attention. Soon their conversation when into the talk of pronouns. Dean asked Cas that they use they/them and Castiel replied with “yeah, he/they right” and Dean replied with the fact that they use all of them but put that in their bio just so their family doesn’t get mad at them. Castiel and Dean’s conversation is as straight and to the point as two queer people’s talks can. Their chat soon became an actual friendship.
“Oh damn,” Castiel says out loud at 5 am. they were watching a video on their phone. It had two people dancing and kissing. The caption said, “I accidentally recorded our first kiss”.  As any normal lonely person does, they comment “damn is this too much to ask for” and go back to scrolling. A little later they see a notification pop up, someone replied to his comment saying “right”, rightfully he likes the comment and replies “I want it” and the other person writes back “same”. They continue to scroll until they get another two notifications from the exact same person, they had followed them and liked their only video. Castiel took some thought and looked at their account
“You know you should stop watching those so much, it’s bad for you,” Gabriel said for the fifth time that day.
Before Sam could say anything, Dean walked away into the hall. Sam was left alone and he could finally think. He could understand his rage anyone he loves dies or gets hurt. All at once with his thoughts, he grabbed his duffel bag and started to walk through the hall and into the garage meeting Dean putting his bag in the back of the Impala.
“Oh, I get you don't have to lie just to keep my innocent mind from wondering what you and your little hubby do during playtime together.” Sam stated like the snarky little shit he is.
“I was not fucking thinking about my ang- Cas I wasn’t thinking about cas!” yelled because how DARE he say that about Cas and me
Everyone but Gabe replied with no, when Cas got backing to the living room with two cups and a 2-liter of cherry coke Gabe told Cas that they're the best younger sister. Castiel mentally cringed.
When the food finally got to their house, they had chosen to put on one of the nostalgic shows from Cas and Gabe’s childhood. Gravity Falls. One of Castiel’s personal head cannons is that Dipper is transgender, he wouldn’t act like that in “Manliness” if he wasn’t insecure about the fact, he could not be considered a “Manly” man. They played a board game with their family and finally went to bed at 11:30 pm after a big day of feelings and laughter. Castiel when to bed with the bright emerald green eyes of their love, Dean Winchester on their mind.
“Cool, Alfie what do you want?” Gabriel continued asking the rest of the people in the room while Castiel when into the kitchen to get a drink.
Sam sees a book in front of him that he was researching. He took the book off of the desk and dropped it as hard as he could. Once the book hit the desk it made a huge bang and brought Dean back to reality.
"Well you were daydreaming about your angel and I didn’t know how to get your attention," Sam said calmly
When Dean started to get tired, they told Cas and Cas replied with “Go the hell to bed”. This struck up a whole new conversation about how Dean just wants to continue talking to them. This conversation made Cas realize that for some miraculous reason, they were crazy about him. When Cas finally coxed him into going to bed, they went about their day hanging out with their brother and dad. A little while later they went back upstairs to their room because it was still early and they didn’t want to talk to family. Castiel ended up falling asleep, when they woke up, they had 4 missed texts from his friends.
‘Idiot’ Castiel thought to themself before getting their phone out, checking their Instagram and Snapchat before going on Tiktok. When Gabriel gets back from the store, he sees his sibling still lying on the couch, watching Tiktoks.
"Yeah. So go pack up some clothes we're going to be there for a bit." Dean started a little bit forcefully so Sam would get up and moving
“You know what. I'll go to the archives and see what I can find so you can be alone with your pissy fit because I know why you're always daydreaming and dozing off in Cas land.”
“Oh, in that case, I would like the Sweet Mango Habanero Wings,” Castiel stated suddenly happier than before.
”It's not. Do I have to spell it out for you?” he interrupted before his idiot brother pushed his emotions and feelings for the angel down even more.
We’re halfway to South Carolina when we stopped to rest and to eat before we hit the road again. We checked into the nearest motel and settled in for the night. We both went to bed at 10 o’clock after a few beers and a few burgers with fries. I looked over at Sammy, who was already asleep. I looked back at the ceiling that was over me. I went back to my memories of purgatory and when Cas was possessed by Lucifer. The pain, the suffering, and all the panic attacks by stressing over the problems and the things that went wrong that caused the plan to go south. I turned onto my side on the bed. I immediately felt the heavyweight of tiredness wash over me as I laid there, I closed my eyes for a minute but when I tried to open them I had all of these images and blurs of the memories of the past fly over me forcing me to keep my eyes closed. I tried so hard to open them but my mind wouldn’t allow me to. My mind raced between memories that I shut out of way. So I didn’t have to revisit all of the pain and the horrible shit that was done to me and my family. He tried even harder to open my eyes but couldn’t it was like my eyes were glued shut. Then all at once, the sight of a certain memory popped into my view of vision. Purgatory. I never thought I would ever be back into this mindset. I have worked so hard to avoid this, the leviathans, Benny, the loss of some of my humanity, the loss of the one and only blue-eyed angel that I love so dearly. It had started, the madness ensued. The next thing I knew I was standing over a vamp's decapitated body. I stared at the dead body wondering what time span I was in. Then I heard movement in the distance. I got worked up but through the shrub and tree came Benny. I was relieved to see my good old vampire friend. "The vamp said they saw your little angel friend near a river bend up north. We should head there now before the rest of them come." Benny stated. That was when I realized what they were doing. They were getting intel about Cas. Before I could think about what we did next when I blinked the memory switched, when I opened my eyes I saw trees and heard Benny behind me. we pushed through the trees until I heard the sounds of water flowing past. I pushed the branches out of his face quicker than before. Once the branches were clear all I could see was the shore and the white wash stream. As I glances at the terrain I see a figure in the distance. The figure was kneeling near the stream, they had a dirty tan color trench coat with messy black hair and with off white clothing underneath the coat. Castiel. "CAS!" I yelled automatically. I rushed to the filthy angel. The angel got up to meet the two of them. I rushed to Cas with open arms and hugged his rough and skinny body. Once more the dream altered, when I opened my eyes again I found myself in the bunker. The lights were off but the emergency lights were glowing red. I looked around and right away I knew where I was and what memory it was. It was when I was a demon because of The Mark. As I roamed the halls looking for Sam, I found the electrical room and turned the power back on. The next thing I knew Sam had locked me inside of the room. I walked up to the door and started to smash it down with a hammer. The dream altered for the third time and I found myself behind Sam. Sam turns around and I swung the hammer at Sam’s head but he dodges and misses, bringing the hammer to be stuck in the wall. Sam pulls out the demon blade and puts it up to my neck. I lay my chin on the blade allowing me to meet Sam eye-to-eye. Out of nowhere, I heard the words “Come on, do it.” from my mouth. The next thing I see is Sam’s face with terror. Sam draws back the knife from his brother. I tried to wake up but my mind had a stronghold on my body, I couldn't move my whole entire body, not even my arms and legs. I find myself charging towards Sam. But before I could lay hands on him, Cas stepped in and grabbed me. I turned my eyes black while trying to escape Castiel’s strong grip on me. Cas saw what I was trying to do, he brought out his angel instinct and turned his blue eyes to tighten his grip. The dream transformed for the fourth time in the row but this time it was different, I still had the Mark of Cain but it wasn’t like last time, this time, I was still at the bunker but in the library, all the books and all of their staff was in a pile and there were two bodies on the ground. I saw the first body, it was a boy. Maybe in high school or maybe fresh out, he had glasses, a button-up shirt that was bright blue. I looked over at the other body, it was different from the first. He had a vest over a white button-up. But there was something peculiar about his arms, on his left arm, it looked like it had been sewed on. Then that is when I knew what the memory was. It was when I went rogue. I heard footsteps coming up behind me. But before I could turn my back the memory changed once more. This time it was action. I could see myself hit someone. They were wearing something tarnish. I couldn’t see the image very well because I was fighting against the dreams forcing his eyes open, but same as before, no luck. Before I knew it there was a scratchy voice coming through. “Dean,” the figure said. As soon as I heard those words I knew who it was. Castiel. I watched as I pummeled him and threw him across the room. Now I am forcing myself back to reality but my stupid mind would not cease the images, they kept playing repeat after repeat after every hit I took at Cas. Finally, I watched as I threw the finishing blow to Castiel, ending him onto the wooden floor. I watched myself crouch over the beaten Cas and watched me stumble over words as the pain ensues my body. Dean then reached for Cas’ angel blade that was hidden in his sleeve. I angle the point of the blade at my head but hesitate to move. I arch my back and as I came down with the blade moving past Cas’ head, hitting the book. I woke up. The finishing blow that almost ended my most valuable friend, family member, and loved one, that was the one that woke me, the one that ended the pain. I never forgave that night ever. I was drenched in a cold sweat, my shirt was soaked. I turned to Sammy bed and saw that he was missing from view. Then I realized the light shining through the curtains of their room. I turned to the clock on the nearby nightstand to see it reading 10 o’clock am. That means it was all a dream that lasted all night. It almost felt an eternity in the state I was in. Sam comes out of the bathroom looking ready to head out the door. He looks over at his older brother seeing him pale like a ghost, seeing him drenched in sweat, seeing him in a state that he has never seen. Sam was worried. He walks over to my bed and sits at the very end. “Are you alright? You look horrible.'' Sam asked me while you could hear the worry in his voice. I was silent for a moment but looked up to see my younger brother sitting on the end of my bed looking like I had been stabbed or impaled or something like that. I didn’t say anything, but I shook my head, Sam already knew that it might have been personal by the way I looked. Sam looked around the room trying to figure out what to do or what to say to help me calm down, But couldn’t. Sam got up from his position and started to head to the kitchen. He stopped at the entrance and turned back to me. “Dean, I know I haven’t gone through what you have. But I want to help you get through this. I want you to be free from this weight on your shoulders. I know, I might be sounding like a chick but that’s just you.”Sam told me. Sam turned halfway back to the kitchen before saying something to me. “You know I always have your back and I want you to know that. So...we should get going like you said we shouldn’t keep Cas waiting right.”he stated. Then I watched him walk into the kitchen and grab a cold beer from the fridge then started to walk back to me. As Sam left the beer on the nightstand and went to go get the stuff packed and into the car. I just lied in the bed resting my head on the wooden bed frame. I wondered to myself,
Castiel pinched the nipple he was playing with, and Dean in turn couldn’t help but to sink his teeth into the collarbone he was mouthing at. He felt Castiel’s hips buck into his leg as he groaned. “Oh, Dean… Feels so good right now. All of it, every last moment. You look so beautiful like this—so relaxed and vacant and deep.” Castiel’s lips pressed on Dean’s temple in a loose approximation of a chaste kiss. “Your lips look so good… wanna taste them, wanna hear those moans come out of your gorgeous mouth… wanna hear you scream when you come…”
Dean heard the bedroom door click shut somewhere to his left. He could barely bring himself to move, his entire body feeling incredibly heavy as he let out another deep breath. He knew his eyes were open but he wasn’t entirely sure what he was staring at anymore, whether it was the wall or the TV or anything else. He could feel his eyelids close and drag themselves open unevenly and sluggishly. Dean could barely find the will to close his jaw, it having gone lax a long time ago.
“And how does it feel, Dean?” Castiel asked, because he had a sixth-sense for when to ask that question—when it was practically impossible for Dean to answer.
loss. He knew the basics of a hypnotic induction from all the other times he had been put under; but his knowledge of hypnotic inductions came from the perspective of the subject, not the hypnotist. It wasn’t like he really payed close attention to how Castiel framed his progression from induction to trance, and Castiel all but refused to give him directions on how to put himself in trance. ‘
Dean felt himself get catapulted from desperate to utterly wrecked in a single heartbeat. He fought for control over his breathing, determined
down. But somehow it made the trance feel even more inescapable, even more inevitable and heavy because Dean
“I’m going to get up for a moment, Dean. Just long enough to get out of these clothes and clean up. You can stay here and keep falling, sinking, drifting until I come back. Is that okay, good boy?”
“the deeper I go… so good, so good…” Dean had practically turned it into a mantra at this point, biting his lip as Castiel swiped a thumb over his nipple. “s-soo… so good…!” He was openly panting now, mouth opened in the shape of an
, working him through one of the most intense orgasms of his life. It didn’t stop, it didn’t slow down, it just kept
Castiel kept on smiling. “Well, here’s the thing, Dean: I’m a bit busy tonight, but I know how much you want this. So, I’ve come up with a compromise.” He reached a hand to the table behind him, retrieving his copy of whatever dusty, leather-bound tome of unfathomable magic and whatever-the-fuck-else he was currently translating for the Men of Letters database. “I’m going to finish this text and catch up on my work, and you are going to go ahead and put yourself into a trance by the time I come into the bedroom.”
He couldn’t stop the moan from escaping his throat, long and high and desperate. “So good. So good. So good…”
Not really, but what little higher-thinking Dean had left in his brain told him that it was for the best to agree. Castiel hated waking up in dirty clothes (both inside and out), and Dean didn’t like the feeling of dry come between their bodies. It was, unfortunately, a necessary evil. “…okay…” he finally echoed.
“…yeah…” was all Dean could say. Castiel could say anything when Dean was like this and would believe him 100 percent. He could tell him that they were on the planet Venus, he could say that the sun was purple, or that onions tasted like snowfall… such abstract concepts and simple impossibilities and Dean would never even think to doubt Castiel. Especially when he made him feel this good. Especially when he felt this drowsy and soft and quiet… He could feel a trickle of drool fall from his lips, simply unable to do anything to stop it.
Castiel continued to run his fingers along the muscles of Dean’s back. “Good, Dean, thank you for telling me.” Another pause, just as contented as the last. “What do you want to do now?”
The hand moved from his cheek to his forehead, slowly guiding Dean’s head forward to rest in the crook of Castiel’s neck. He felt his already loose body go even more slack he was positioned to lean all of his weight on Castiel, chest to chest and legs tangled together. One of his hand was lifted, shaken, and then gently dropped back to the bed. He felt his mind lurch at the sensation, a deep sigh leaving his body as he sank a bit deeper.
Castiel rewarded him with another scrape of his nails through his hair. “So good for me, Dean… always so good for me.” Dean felt his body be gently pushed off of Castiel’s chest and positioned onto the mattress. He sank into the sheets and the pillow below his head, letting himself drop further into his trance. Castiel’s ran his hand across Dean’s forehead and rested it on his cheek. “Only a moment, Dean,” he promised, and then he was gone.
“C-Cas, please…!” Dean could feel his eyes rolling dizzily underneath the lids. It was too much and not enough, and he wasn’t quite sure what he was pleading for.
It didn’t take long for Dean to finally stop crying, letting out one last deep, shuddering sigh. His fingers, which were curled and under Castiel’s shoulders finally relaxed and released. His breaths still hitched once in a while, but they were far and few between at this point. It had been a minor drop, thankfully, but he still felt a bit hollowed out even as he felt like he was resettling in his skin. He and Castiel would have to keep an eye out to make sure it wouldn’t get any worse than that, but for time being he melted back down into the quiet, slow state of being that held his mind in a soft embrace.
That being said, Dean could remember a couple times where Castiel would finish talking and start to take off his clothes before realizing Dean had just… straight up fallen asleep. It didn’t happen often, thankfully, but it was a reoccurring event.
seemed to echo and pulse through his mind. He remembered each and every time he was dropped into trance, from the very first time to the most recent one from last week (he almost let his eyes roll at that one, this time not out of annoyance).
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said softly. His face seemed to glow with fondness. Dean kept smiling, because he knew that fondness was because of him. Castiel traced his fingers on the back of Dean’s hand teasingly. His eyes rolled at the sensation.
without moving, Dean could almost swan dive into one of those; lay up against the jets and feel the soreness and aches in his lower back practically dissolve. The water would lap up against his chest and loosen something deep within his gut, make him feel like he could actually
“That’s right, Dean,” he praised, as his thumb rubbed another circle into his skin. Dean could feel the whirl of heat that trailed after his touch, flaring hot for a moment before traveling down from his waist and pooling low in his belly. “And what happens when you feel pleasure?”
It started with the words that he both loved and hated the most: “I want to try something a little different today, Dean.”
“…deeper down…” He felt his eyes flutter when he realized he was repeating himself. He couldn’t think of anything else to say, especially when it was so difficult to get his words together. His jaw and lips felt almost pleasantly numb with how relaxed they were; his voice had gained a loose, lazy quality as he tried to answer Castiel’s questions. “…deeper and deeper…”
The best hot tubs were the ones with seats low enough so the jets could hit his neck, too. Firm enough knead the muscles of his shoulders, but still a comfortable pressure as to not be irritating. Dean could lean back into the warm water and soak for hours, let the water loosen and remove the strain of the world like dirt from his body. A warm bath that left him loose and pliant, the jets buffeting his muscles in any direction they wished. The low hum of the water pump was also soothing to Dean—maybe it was because he was often half-conscious on those nights, but the thrum of the motor seemed to have a special ability turning his brain into putty. That low purr was similar to the Impala’s engine, in a way; just barely there on his periphery but enough to dull the sharp edges of the world. Dean could have spent whole nights in a hot tub, letting the world turn fuzzy and warm and soft. He could stare at the refracted light at the bottom of the tub, watch the patterns unfold and glitter in the pre-installed lights of the tub and the moon…
), before settling on the TV they had mounted to the wall a few months ago. It was a modestly large flat screen, obviously turned off at the moment, but what caught Dean’s attention was the tiny red LED at the bottom, near where the volume and channel buttons were. It was just big enough to catch his attention, and continually blinked on and off. A steady, continuous rhythm every time it turned on an off. On and off. On and off… on… and off…
Castiel started to stroke faster, grinding his hips hard into Dean’s leg. He captured his lips in a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss. Dean could barely respond, too busy moaning and bucking and falling backwards into hypnosis and headfirst into his climax. Castiel ran his thumb over Dean’s cockhead at the top of each stroke, his movements growing desperate. He was close, perhaps just behind Dean. “So good for me, Dean. So good for me, my good boy, you can come. Come for me Dean, come, come, come…”
Castiel’s smile softened into a smug look (that over-confident bastard). “See, every time we play together like this, I’m the one that drops you into trance, correct? I’m the one that talks you through how nice it feels for your arms to grow too heavy for your shoulders. Or how your mind starts to feel a nice, warm fuzz start to settle over your thoughts. Or how your eyes can’t quite seem to stay focused on my face, or the spot on the wall, or the spirals I like to show you…”
Dean keened and shook against Castiel’s body, panting wetly at his neck. They had just barely started the fun stuff and he already felt like he was being flooded with pleasure. Castiel’s suggestion that his touch gave him pleasure had long ago stopped feeling like a distant concept that revved up Dean’s engine. Now it felt like a real, physical sensation; Liquid heat injected straight into his veins, flowing across his body and soaking his brain like no drug ever could. A light touch of his fingers could send a pleasant hum through Dean’s limbs all the way down to his fingertips. Other times he felt like he could literally vibrate out of his own skin because of Castiel’s hands, the mere idea that his partner was touching him sending a low buzz to all the best parts of his brain. He couldn’t be sure that Castiel wasn’t using his Grace to make the sensations feel real, but honestly Dean didn’t care if he was. “Cas…”
In response Dean let out another loud moan, letting his head fall on Castiel’s shoulder and nuzzling against it like a big cat. A big, hypnotized, horny-as-all-hell cat. His fingers clutched at Castiel’s sleeves as he moaned again, feeling it taper off into a gasping sob at he felt his arousal start to spike the longer he cried. His hips bucked upwards at Castiel continued to stroke. And stoke. And stroke. “Ah, ah, ah… ah… oh go—Cas… hnn…”
much. He got something out of it too. But it was the principle of the thing. “Oh?” He finally hummed in response.
And suddenly it was all too much, he had no way to process it without coming out of trance, but he didn’t want to leave the soft, muted haze he sunk into. It was too much, too fucking much to handle and it wouldn’t stop, the rushing of his body and the sluggishness of his mind. He could feel himself starting to come out of trance but he didn’t
felt like. He was barely holding on to awareness, his muscles too warm and loose to do more than twitch in the general direction he wanted them to go. Dean couldn’t even be sure that he was still actually awake or halfway occupying a dream.
made a point to ask it during these sessions. It was a check-in to make sure Dean was feeling comfortable, or if something needed to be addressed before continuing. But was safety thing more than anything, ensuring that Dean was still comfortable with what they were doing in a session and where they might go next. He could tell Castiel if he wanted to stay in trance or be woken up, what he wanted Castiel to talk about; whether he wanted to shift focus from this lazy, drifting trance to what could end up being
Amara nodded, placing her hands on her hips. "I've learned things in my freedom. Had time to change and grow. I realized that I created nothing but enemies by dealing in war.... destruction.... killing." She looked around at the room of hunters. Sam, the budding warlock. Jack, the nephil. Billie, the commander of death. Rowena, the most powerful witch of all time. And the starcrossed lovers that mastered murder, Dean and his angel Castiel. This was her army. And she built it because she changed. "That life wasn't getting me anywhere. It just dug me into a place where I was so isolated by my actions that I felt like a pyromaniac was all I could be. But, in time, I realized that I can't feel the warmth of humanity while I'm burning it to the ground. If I cause pain to people, I can't love them at the same time. And they can't love me in return." She looked at Dean and Castiel. "You two taught me that and I get it now. Dean, I understand why you called his name instead of mine. Because, to you, Castiel is kindness. He is light. He is power and protection and reverence and stillness. You trust him because he's proven to you that he loves you. And after years of dedication and sacrifice and bonding, you two have built something stronger than I could ever forge through magic."
He looked to Rowena. She fell all over him when they first met. Now, here she is ruling Hell with her powers completely unleashed. Against him. Sam, Dean, and Castiel stood as a united front like they always seemed to do.
Sam grabbed his son by the shoulder, "Those two are a mess. Learn from their mistakes. Let's put our things away and find somewhere to cast. Sound cool, Jack?"
Cas was getting all the smiles he could possibly want, but their wires are crossing. It was causing him complete and utter confusion at the same time. Regardless of the situation, the Pizza Man looked
Jack needed to hear forgiveness from the older hunter, but after what he confessed to? Dean was at a loss for words. He hadn't forgiven Jack. Killing Mary Winchester had driven a large wedge between them. Hell, Jack was surprised Dean even let him stay in the first place. Things weren't "all good" between them and may never be "all good" again. But, Dean didn't hate the boy. He could never. He raised him. And damn it all, Dean loves him -- sees him as his child. So, when he came back he couldn't help it. The door was open. Jack was immediately fed and safe and warm. In his home again, all of his parents by his side to hold and protect him.
"Okay. Well." Dean opened his eyes, looking down at Castiel's trusting him. He let out a wary breath. "I might be... the slightest bit... submissive in bed."
Sam rolled his eyes at his brother, continuing, "I, uh, yeah. Whatever. Just... the last time I saw him, I did something. He'd screwed us all over before, so I wanted to be safe. I knew he wouldn't be helping us for long."
From the backseat, Castiel watched as the hunter pushed himself out of the car, taking off his green jacket and shoving it in front of his pants as he walked around to the front seat. The angel leaned up to unlock the door manually and Dean slid into the front seat, jacket balled up on his lap. He peeked into the backseat, eyes shifting away with embarrassment when they locked on to Cas's kind baby blue stare. Castiel observed the strange human as he shifted uncomfortably in the front seat and adjusted his mirror. Cas asked, "Dean, are you alright? Did I say something wrong?"
"I. Said. Where!" Sam fixed his eyes on the moon sternly, continuing to chant. He kept casting. Sam demanded the moon give him his answer. He wanted more. Understandable. Nevada's a pretty big state. Since he's finally got demon AAA on the phone he might as well get his time's worth. Dean didn't blame him for wanting to speak to the manager.
"Maybe you got a point, I don't know. I just don't want to get too swept up in it. We have priorities here." Sam passed Castiel the wet pot, "Bright and early tomorrow, we're summoning Billie. That way we can make some semblance of a plan. By the time this rain stops, we need to be ready to move."
The room was large and cavernous filled with a piano, great paintings, an assistant's area, couches, rugs, and fine gold accentuate. Most secretaries don't have it quite this well off. Metatron stepped daintily through the Persian rug, angel blade glinting in the light of the room as they made their way to a small bar at the edge of the room. "I could go for a wine cooler. Either of you want one?"
Dean muttered, "Yeah, thanks, Sabrina Spellman. We are so surprised that you couldn't help standing over a burning cauldron in the dead of night without witnesses when the moon was right. Witch."
Jack nodded, smiling tentatively as he walked into the room. He wasn't entirely comfortable yet. Dean remembered Castiel's words from last night. Jack looks to him. They may have spoken on the phone but this is the first Dean has seen of him since he ran away from the kitchen yesterday. Jack needs reassurance that everything is alright. And that's Dean's job to honor his word and provide the peace he promised.
"Better than the FBI?!" Jack shrieked. The kid started, dino head shaking as he jumped. "I didn't know that could happen."
Castiel turned quietly in the empty room. Well, now that Jack's bedroom is tidy he has to leave. Darn. When did that child get so clever?
Jack asked, gold shining behind his eyes as he touched Meta on the wrist, "Now, you did. You can help now. You can save everyone. You can be a real hero. Tell us. Where is the hidden room?"
"Hell yeah." Dean took the other doorknob and they opened the pantry to reveal a hidden bedroom. Warm wooden floors, a fireplace, faux sheepskin rugs. Plants hung from the ceiling in glass pots cradled with rope. Eucalyptus, vines, succulents, ivy, and magnolia. Stacks of records were in four shelves in the corner, a classic record player at the ready. A warm, tanned velvet upholstered armchair sat across from a king sized bed with strong metal framing, black silk sheets, and cozy pillows. Mounted on the brick walls was a television and several floating wooden shelves, clothes were folded neatly on each shelf.
Castiel gave Dean a long look. He squeezed Dean's hand again. It was cold outside, but he was warm. Dean just wanted to fall into his arms again. He wants to hold him tight, the beautiful angel keeping him warm through the night breeze. More importantly, Dean wanted to take care of Metatron. That gremlin is going down. Six feet.
Castiel sighed, stabbing the sausage with his fork. "Considering he made my life a living Hell, stole my grace, orchestrated the Great Fall in my name, and
Jack raised his hand as Sam finished tying the rope around the legs of the chair, turning the ropes into iron. Sigils burned into the metal and branded it shut. They strengthened the ropes together, father and son.
Dean had his hand pressed to his mouth, eyes welling up with tears. He stared at the picture unblinkingly as Jack continued to describe the picture and point out little details. Dean watched the drawing silently. A tear fell. That set the floodgates loose. Shit. He cleared his throat, feeling a bit choked up.
. Mere weeks after pulling Dean from Hell, Cas watched her kiss Dean right in front of his face. He hadn't known what was happening to him at the time -- why his palms heated up with the sudden urge to smite. Now he understands.
The box opened itself, inside was a small red stone. It was dull and dirty, surrounded by what looked to be green and blue marbles. Dean peered over it, glancing into the box, "Huh. That's it?"
"Bullshit! Who just up and goes to the Empty to make sure things are okay?? It's never okay! It's the Empty!" Dean's eyes started to well up. "Cas is in there, Sam. The Empty has it out for him. I didn't sign up to lose Cas. I was ready for this to go sideways. Sam--"
while he stirred pasta. He wore a fresh light blue Henley with a black apron tied just so at the small of his back. The music pounded through the open bedroom door, and Dean's body moved right to it while he busied himself with feeding his family.
The angel buried his face in Dean's neck, pinning the human down and climaxing against his lover's cock. Dean pulled his hair and Cas's eyes rolled back, pushing him harder and harder into the bed, breathing into his neck, "I love you. I love you so much. You're the love of my life. You're perfect. You're the most beautiful thing. I love you."
"Wrong answer." Chuck answered, walking towards the door with a powerful stride. "If Sam Winchester won't stop casting, I'll make him stop. Witches like him always end up crushed in the end. Why not hurry it along?"
Jack gazed up at the three standing. Dean, Sam, and Castiel. The nephil began to smile, "No, I am. All three of em. Thanks for helping us, Metatron."
Metatron lifted their shiny angel blade off of the table and pointed it at him, "No. I don't think I will. I confirmed the existence of the room. We strolled down memory lane. It was a beautiful story. You got what you came here for. Now go."
It was ugly and tangled and spiny. It curled around his stomach, put his thoughts in a blender, and made him want to lash out. Jealousy flared every time Dean was in the presence of a human woman who would have a better chance at making Dean happy then Castiel ever would. It's been that way for years. Even with last night's events of kissing and confessing, Castiel still couldn't help but feel insecure about where he stood.
never mattered to him, Castiel." Meta scoffed, "Think about it, he left Heaven to create, manipulate, and
Jack tilted his head to the side in a way that reminded Sam of his best friend Cas. The bubbles slipped off of the nephil's nose and onto his shirt, "Oh, right. You don't like those. Sorry, Dad."
Castiel spanked him a third time, crawling up the bed and kissing him deeply, "You stole an angel from Heaven. That's at least a misdemeanor."
"Fuck, I didn't want to tell you this so quick... didn't wanna freak you out." Dean worried, eyes still shut as he breathed out heavily. "Maybe we should keep it chill tonight."
"Have a good rest." Castiel turned back to the television, lowering the volume with the remote, "I'm going to stay sharp with this human hunting show. They have good tips."
Jack rolled his eyes, "No, it's not. Dean just asked you to hang out with him outside the bunker. Alone. At night. To watch the stars. It's just like in the movie Tangled! I saw it with Sam! Flynn and Rapunzel ended up getting married after. Do you want to
I will. That angel's gonna look like a damn Jackson Pullock painting the second he climbs on top of me."
Dean looked away, heart beating quick in his chest. His beard was still tender. The seratonin from that intimate moment was still rushing through his veins. He could crush this hot cup of java in his sweaty hands right now. His muscles were clenched tight. Just hearing Cas's name put Dean on edge. Saying it heightened everything. Dean felt hot enough to sweat but cold enough to shiver.
Dean scratched behind his ears and blushed. "I beat myself up for years for kicking Cas out. Meanwhile, you were pulling strings so that we wouldn't fall in love. Well, bang up job, man. You failed."
Castiel spoke up, "We've got some powerful players on our side. Plans. Weapons. Death has agreed to help. As well as the Empty--"
Dean sighed, glancing back at Castiel in the living room. He tapped his foot for a second. Then he turned to Sam.
And, here they are. Dean and Castiel. Drinking alone in his bedroom, and he's too much of a coward to grab that nerdy little angel by the classy tan lapels and tell him what's real. But, this is absolutely not the time. Actually, its the worst timing on this literally godforsaken planet. Their kid is dead. They're in mourning. And, the world. Fuck. The world. Ah, fuck the world.
Meta put a manicured hand to their chest, blood cascading under the pink acrylic on their index finger as they swore to their queen. "Unacceptable. This world must be protected."
"Baby, you okay?" He sat beside Cas. The angel looked up at him, blue eyes full of emotion. Dean lifted his hand and rubbed Castiel's shoulder patiently. He wanted to provide the angel with reassurance. This was all happening quite quickly. He'd been cursed for two years, and knew that would become a topic of conversation eventually, but he never honestly thought
"I have six dollars and a shiny rock." Jack had reached out his hand to shake on it. "Let's make a deal."
Cas patted his shoulder warmly, rubbing his hand along Dean's back. "Thought I'd try it out. Figured now was the time."
Castiel broke their kiss, "Just making sure I'm reading this situation correctly. This feels romantic, and I've loved you for quite some time. Is it okay that we're--" Dean butted in to kiss his angel warmly. Castiel placed his palms on Dean's hips, squeezing as he continued, "--doing this? Do you feel the way I--"
Dean's face fell. The world crashed down around him, and for a long moment, all he could hear was the distant clamoring around in the bunker. His face fell into his hands, and he closed his eyes as he whispered out, "You have to be fucking me."
Castiel insisted, looking back at his human lover. "That took work. I'm worried about him. Ever since he's gotten his soul back, it's like he's experiencing his childhood all over again. He's the same Jack he was before, but now there's this traumatized young boy inside him that's seeing the world as a very dark place. We raised him to be strong and he is, but he's exhausted from all this stress. If Billie hadn't had our entire plan laid out for us, Jack would have... he would have taken on the responsibility of saving the world from it's creator. And the child in him was cracking under all that pressure."
Rowena waved her hand fondly. "That's alright, my dear. As royalty, I no longer want for anything. Seeing you like this is enough of a gift."
Dean was worried about letting him in. He approached Jack warily, if at all. Mainly talking to him through Castiel who passed on to Jack when it was time for a family meal. Dean was confident that he could at least do that. After all they'd been through together, he still wanted to make sure Jack ate well.
Castiel walked and walked and walked until he reached the corner of the Bunker. With nowhere else to turn, he made a complete 180°. Back the other end, he supposed. It's 3:09am. It's 3:09am. He walked some more, gliding through the halls until he reached that door. That room. Oh. That's it. Where Castiel would go. It wasn't far at all.
"Good morning, Dean." Castiel said, voice gravelly and deep, but gentle. "It's sunrise. Do you want to head back home? Everyone will be up soon."
Chuck growled out. "You boys are nothing without me! You owe everything to me! The mess that I put you through is the only reason you have anything that you hold dear!"
"Ten minutes. The beach is right up the road if you wanna sit together and watch the waves while we eat. It's much more relaxing than the break room."
Billie's shoulders shook with laughter. She held up her hand, and Amara gave her a high five. Billie sighed. "You're right. You are different now. Your morality is clear. You're calculated. Wise. Powerful beyond measure. I'm glad we did that. Getting to know you was... illuminating."
Sam shrugged, "Then, we armor up. Heavy. Let's load the car. We'll be on the road in thirty. Sound good, guys?"
"I know a nice place we can park the car. There's this lake just inside a forest, it's pretty quiet. Is that cool?"
"I thought we were finally done with that damn Hobbit." Dean glanced over to Cas, seeing his distress as he hissed at Death on his angel's behalf.
Dean pushed his suit jacket too. He was breathing a bit heavier. Cas's warmth was everywhere. His hair was so cute. Dean's always liked those little curls. Cas lifted his large hand to Dean's face, pulling him in a bit as he brushed his thumb against Dean's cheek, "You had a bit of butter on you." Dean's heart made a break for it, slamming against his chest wall. His palms were sweaty, eyes hazy and unfocused.
Dean tugged the angel by the hand and tested the door. It opened easily. Dean pulled Castiel into the room. It was small and dark, full of hulking racks of cleaning supplies and towels. The door closed behind them and Dean pushed Castiel against the back of it, "You're being weird. What's going on?"
“So hard to think, Dean. You can just let go now, let yourself sink all the way into a nice, deep, relaxing sleep.” A hand fell over his forehead, down the bridge of his nose, fingers brushing against his slack lips. “Deep sleep now, Dean.”
And for one last time—at least for tonight—Dean allowed himself to melt back into the warm, quiet darkness, surrounded only by Cas’ arms.
“Good… so good, Dean.” Castiel leaned forward and pressed soft lips to Dean’s temple. “Start counting for me, Dean…”
But still, Dean had only ever been able to go into hypnosis with Castiel at the helm. And even then, he had never felt the inclination to try doing it by himself—why would he when he had way more fun doing it when Castiel was there?
“I am actually somewhat behind in translating, that part’s true—" Dean snorted, causing Castiel to glower a little. “—but mostly because I read this post online about this type of induction. The hypnotist would ask the subject to put themselves into trance, leave the room, and then come back after a few minutes to see that they did as they asked.” Castiel’s lips quirked as he explained it. “I thought it was interesting.”
Dean loved when Castiel brushed his hand over his face. He felt his eyes roll even further back into his head until the whites were showing before fluttering back closed. A deep, relieved moan came from his chest. He felt himself lean totally on Castiel’s shoulder, hands awkward and limp where they were laid out on his lap. God, it felt like his whole
Dean wanted that too. He clutched harder at Castiel’s shoulders and rolled his hips into Castiel’s hand with as much strength as he could muster. He trembled against Castiel and let out a needy moan, biting his lip to cut it off into a groan deep in his chest. He wanted so badly to open his eyes, but he just felt himself sink all the farther down into hypnosis, the pleasure and relaxation creating the perfect feedback loop that kept him from doing much more than biting his lip and grunting, grinding his hips again into Castiel’s grip. He pressed his forehead harder into Castiel’s shoulder. “Mm… mm… muhhh… haa… mmmohhhfuck, Cas…” He was slurring at this point, but it didn’t matter. Castiel told him nothing mattered except for how it all felt, and he believed him.
“Deeper and deeper,” Castiel echoed. He wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders, seemingly smoothing what little tension remained in his muscles out and away. “That’s right. A hundred times deeper.”
Dean’s brain was already primed to interpret whatever contact Castiel had with his body as basically concentrated sex—it was a suggestion they had been working on pretty much as soon as they realized how much they liked hypnosis. An accidental brush against his body could get him interested. Deliberate touches would cause heat to gather in his belly like no one could in the past.
that yet but there was no way he could handle all the sensation his body without coming out and suddenly everything just felt
Even in his practically melted brain Dean knew that this was nothing short of cruel. He was going to torture Castiel when he woke up later, everything was
He swallowed again and licked his lips. “I mean, yeah, but you know I’ve never really done, well, self-hypnosis before.”
A little later in their conversation, Dean asks very politely if he could see a picture of Cas. It takes Cas a few minutes to find a presentable picture of themself. When they finally sent it Dean called them Beautiful. In return, Dean sent a picture of himself, and Castiel’s jaw dropped. They. Are. Gorgeous. Within two minutes they were fighting about who is more god-like. This petty fight went on for around a half-hour. Eventually, Dean asked Cas how tall they are, Cas replied with his height standing at 5’11”. Dean replied with his height 6’1”.
Sam was sitting at the first desk in the entrance. He was reading some of the Men of Letters records that were hidden. Dean walks in and goes to the map table room with a green duffel bag full of clothes.
Castiel woke up at 1 pm and promptly went back on Tiktok one of the first videos he saw was this person saying “Question of the day: do they actually like or do they like me as a friend?” and then it started to play line without a hook. Castiel thought that this related a little bit to their life right now with Dean, but it was the “For You Page” so what could they really expect. Cas liked the video and decided to share it on their Snapchat story. Eventually, on the other side of the country, Dean woke up and when through their normal steps to his day. Soon Dean went onto Snapchat and saw Castiel’s story, they were wondering who Cas was thinking of when sharing the video so he texted them asking if they could know who it was about. Castiel was playing Minecraft while this was happening, they paused their game. They texted back almost immediately; they didn’t think they could lie to Dean so they simply just replied to that question with “You”.
While Sam was trying to get his older brother's attention, Dean was in his own head trying to imagine what his amazing blue-eyed angel would say when he got back from heaven with the whereabouts of Kelly Kline.
Sam didn’t answer. He just stood there staring at the board with info on Kelly Kline in silence. Dean was silent looking at his baby brother upset and started to feel guilty. Dean grabbed his bag and walked towards him. He stopped right in front of him and placed his hand on Sam’s shoulder while hesitating slightly wondering whether or not Sam will freak out.
“We're not done, you little shit.” But before he could continue, Sam was already out of sight from the conversation.
Castiel soon got the expected Snapchat notification while they were lying in bed. When Cas opened the app, they saw that “De24619” added them as a friend. When they added Dean back, Dean texted first saying “Hii”, the rest of their conversation for that day is just them getting to know each other. Cas has learned a lot about dean during their short talk, they have learned, Dean’s hobbies, that his favorite marvel character is Tony Stark and Loki, their favorite movies are Coraline, Corpse Bride, and Edward Scissor Hands. They have also learned that his dream job is being a tattoo artist or a forensic scientist, they are an amazing artist, are 17 years old, and live in Washington.
“Sure thing Sammy.” just to annoy him a little bit more but not too much because they do have to share the bunker.
Sam got up and walked away. Dean was left alone. He imagined what they were going to do when they caught Kelly Kline. Sam walks back into the room carrying a blue duffel bag.
“So what were you thinking about then?” Sam asked trying to get his idiotic older brother to just tell the truth and confront his feelings.
There was silence in the room after Dean yelled at Sam. He hasn’t heard Dean yell at him like that since he and Sam got into it when he found out that he and Ruby were working together and he was drinking demon blood. Dean saw the look on Sam’s face and felt bad for yelling at him like that. He always hated when he had to raise his voice at Sam. It always reminded himself of his father whenever he screamed at the boys for screwing up something.
“Cassie!” Gabriel yelled startling the younger child. Who was lying on the couch scrolling on his phone.
“Oh my god, it’s Castiel and, what do you want Gabe?” Castiel asked in return, still a little upset from the idiotic nickname their older brother calls them by.
Castiel still hasn’t told their older brother Gabriel that they got a crush on someone, let alone that they are sort of dating someone. They don't know what would happen if the news got back to their mother, Naomi. The thought gave them chills. Their whole family has known that they are Bisexual but dating a masculine-presenting person just makes it more real and they don’t think that their family is ready for that. What breaks Castiel away from their thoughts is an unexpected Facetime from their older brother.
“Yeah. Do get anything else to add, Sammy?” Dean asked purposely to draw out the ‘m’ in Sammy just because he knows that he hates being called "Sammy", but whenever Sam and Dean argue he always uses Sammy just to aggravate him.
“So good for me, Dean. All of your nerves feel nothing but how much pleasure you’re feeling. You can’t move, you can’t think, not when your brain is swamped with all this pleasure. All this arousal.” Castiel rasped his tongue along Dean’s jawline, leaving a streak of wet heat that traveled straight down to his dick. “Nothing matters except for what we’re building towards. Nothing matters except for the way I’m making you feel, and how it feels even better, even hotter when you’re in this deep trance.”
That was something Dean made a note revisit later when he was neither physically nor mentally melting into a puddle of bliss).
“I think I managed,” Dean murmured. He felt his eyes cross and unfocus briefly before resettling on Castiel’s face. “I’m feeling…” he swallowed. “…feeling pretty trancey right now…”
Castiel started to rock Dean gently side to side, letting out a pleased hum. “It’s almost too hard, now. So hard to remember what number you’re on and what comes next… so hard to remember when each one just puts you further and further into a nice deep sleep.”
“ninety… nine…” He could do this. “nine… eight… sev’n…” He was confused. Was he counting down from one hundred or ten? Maybe it wasn’t important, because regardless of the number all that mattered was going “…deeper ‘n deep…” The number he was on didn’t matter, because the one thing that stayed the same was his mind going “…deeper ‘n deeper…” and his body sinking “…deeper…” into trance. Nice and “…deep…”
Castiel was already ahead of him, like always. The hand on his waist dipped lower down his back, down his hip, over the swell of his ass. Dean felt a soft, teasing squeeze of the muscle (he let out a sleepy huff at that, he could almost never resist coping a feel) before the hand slipped further down and between their bodies. His knuckles ran along the dip between his hip and the base of his groin, gentle and teasing. Dean bit his lip and rut his hips on Castiel’s thigh again. He was half hard already and sinking deeper into hypnosis because of it, which only served to turn him on more. Fuck, he loved those feedback loops.
That part was true—Dean had never had the patience to practice self-hypnosis. Every blog and testimonial he had read about hypnosis had said it felt no different than meditating, but meditation was not something he had ever gotten the hang of on his own. He wasn’t one to sit around and do practically nothing (even though that was exactly the point), and he had only ever found rare success with guided audio files off of YouTube. But when Castiel offhandedly mentioned one day that he was curious and wanted to give hypnosis a try, Dean just shrugged and said
True to his word, Castiel was back before Dean could really start to miss him. A warm washcloth was gently run along his stomach and legs, cleaning away the mess the both of them had made and soothing some of the ache in his muscles. He felt a water bottle press against his lips and was quietly prompted to drink—it was cool and lovely in his throat as he sipped before it was placed on what sounded like the bedside table behind Castiel. The blanket Dean was laying on was pulled out from under him and tucked around his shoulders.
He felt arms tighten around him, followed by a warm chuckle. “I love you,” he whispered, plain and simple, “so, so much, Dean.” Castiel pressed his lips against his forehead again, murmuring quietly against his skin. “Go to sleep now, Dean. Sleep now…”
He felt Castiel’s chuckle from where his head was resting against his throat. “I can make it feel even better,” he said. “Would you like that, Dean?”
He could feel Castiel position him upright, although he made no move to support himself. Castiel hadn’t ordered it and Dean couldn’t find the energy to do it himself. Castiel kept whispering in his ear, “…and every breath just takes you even deeper… deeper… deeper and deeper down… Every time you breathe in you can feel peace and calm filling your lungs, pumping through your blood like oxygen. And every time you breathe out you let go of a little more tension, a little more resistance, feeling so vacant and placid and sluggish… nothing can disturb you, and even my voice just smooths over your mind and lets you sink deeper down…”
Tonight’s trance was giving that one a run for its money; At the very least, it made it into the Top Five.
There were two options here, both of them tempting in their own right. But Dean had stripped naked for a reason.
But Castiel had other ideas; he tapped his fingers insistently on Dean’s hand. “But you have to stay sitting up for me, Dean. You can just barely find the strength in your heavy, heavy muscles to sit up.”
“It feels so good, Dean, that’s right.” Castiel nibbled just below his jaw, right on the spot that made Dean want to thrash and squirm in ecstasy. “And it continues to feel even better with each passing moment. With every touch on your body. With every moan that falls from your lips.”
Dean let out a low hum and moved his head in a small nod. He felt utterly comfortable here, curled on Castiel’s chest as he drifted. Wrung out and drained, but so,
He let out a breathy pant and shifted his head where it was resting on Castiel’s neck. He lazily mouthed at the line of his jaw. “…feelin’ a little horny…” he said in a low voice; still drowsy and slurred, but with an unmistakable edge of heat to it.
touching his dick despite how much he wanted to go ahead and get primed. No, right now wasn’t about him getting all hot and bothered (but he wasn’t opposed to it). This was an experiment first, possibly sexy-foray into bone-town second. Dean wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the task at hand if he became overexcited. Although there was certainly
Castiel shifted his hips. Dean could feel the hard line that was his cock press against his thigh—could feel the heat through his dress pants. “I think I would like that for myself,” he growled. The hand on his chest circled a nipple.
. He already felt himself shiver at the words. Castiel had a superpower, he was sure of it (beyond the normal angel mojo, that is). There was no way someone should be able to say something like that and be able to make Dean want to simultaneously bite his lip in excitement and roll his eyes in annoyance. Castiel could come up with some of the most insane tortures known to man, but it would give him a power trip
Oh, it definitely was. But Dean wasn’t going to admit to it that easily. “Another sexy adventure to try, huh? Are we the kink-Mythbusters now? Is that what we’re doing?”
Dean didn’t answer at first. Couldn’t answer. He was busy trying to move his body in all the ways he wanted to, but the sleepy lassitude of the trance relaxed him enough that he was barely able to do more than twitch. It had taken practically all his remaining strength to keep clutching at Castiel’s shoulders, and his brain power was less focused on properly responding to the question and more towards how it all felt so fucking
Dean wailed out in rapture. “fffuuuhhh! So fuuhhcking good! God, fuck, ngh, mmm, ah…” He tilted his head up towards Castiel’s face and let out another loud moan. “Gonna, gonna, oh… oh god, gonna c-come… so good, please Cas, fuck, mm… oh fu…!” He can’t stop babbling. “please, p-please, please let me come oh fuck…”
when Castiel would start babbling softly in his ear about what to feel, what to see, how much deeper it took him…
“What brought this idea up, anyway?” Dean asked. “I don’t think you’re actually that concerned about finishing that book right now, are you?”
Castiel often did this, when given the chance. Castiel had once admitted that he liked making up the deepeners—he liked rambling on and on and telling Dean exactly what he should be feeling, how it felt to sink into trance. Castiel said he liked watching how he reacted to the deepeners, how his face would shift and twitch depending on how deep and relaxed he was. And honestly, Dean liked it too. He was so good at going into trance now that he hardly ever needed the detailed deepeners like he did when they were first starting hypnosis. But he loved hearing Castiel talk, loved hearing how his voice would pitch and shift as he talked Dean into a deeper trance. He loved feeling Castiel’s voice rumble through his chest and letting it take him down just as much as the words did. Dean
Dean pursed his lips, pretending to think for a moment, then nodded. “Alright, why not? How do you want to go about it?”
It took a few moments for Dean to gather his thoughts. “…good…” he finally settled on. He knew this was important, so he tried to pull his brain back together into something Castiel could actually work with. “…c’mfortable…” Nailed it.
“Yes. I’ve put you under a million times by now, surely you can figure out how to do it yourself just this once?” Castiel looked like the cat with the cream, all smug and smoldering and sexy and
He kept staring at the light as he tried to figure out where to go from there. Should he start a sort of hypnotic monologue? Try to talk himself down into trance? Keep staring and hope that he would eventually just get mentally exhausted enough and zone out?
Actually, Dean found he really enjoyed those inductions. Castiel would find clever ways to have him relax his body one muscle at a time. ‘
It felt like the world was dangling on a string as they both kept coming. There was no way something could feel this good, this incredible. Dean writhed against Castiel and Castiel rolled against Dean and they held each other as they came. Open-mouthed moans and curses and cries coming from both of them to the point where Dean literally could not figure out where his release ended and Castiel’s started. It was incredible, it was terrible, it was…
