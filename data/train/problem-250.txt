"Just here," John said as he entered the room with a smile and she sat up from Sherlock, flicked off the covers, got to her feet and walked over, slipping her arms around his waist.
"The face you make when you pity me or are offering up sympathy that I don't, quite frankly desire or deserve," Atlas bit at him harshly before pausing. "Sorry. I didn't mean it to come out like that, dad. I'm grateful for your concern."
When she woke again, it was 6:30am and neither of the men had woken in the time she had slept. She smiled to herself before wincing in pain as she felt her wound. It wasn't that big to her knowledge, but she knew that it was deep. Everything else felt fine, except for that headache she had, but she put that down to the medication. The bag for the drip attached to her arm was slowly emptying.
"WELCOME." A voice said as John appeared through the door. Within the cement floor there was a deep mound of dirt encased in the flooring, as if you could be walking on cement and then suddenly on earth. He looked round the room and saw a shovel placed off to the side, his eyes went angry before be conjured up the courage and found the words he needed.
Atlas sat in Sherlock's chair reading her next book which - for a change - was about the effects of drugs, her legs crossed as she studied the pages. At the desk John was sat writing a blog entry for the most recent case that they were working on and in the kitchen Sherlock was testing the strength of the intestine when put under immense pressure. Rosie was sitting in the living room with a colouring book and Mrs Hudson was in the kitchen handing Sherlock a cup of tea before coming through to the rest of them.
"Stupid. Stupid. I told her not to go." John said into the phone before he hung up and got to his feet, slung on his shoes and hopped into the fabia. Making his way down the road he was begining to boil. Atlas had gone against his word and had gone and done something so stupid. He warned her, he told her she shouldn't go. He was so mad. How stupid? He was going to tell her off, make his point incredibly clear. Why had she gone against his word? Was it not good enough for her?
John walked into view first and gave Sammy a look, to which Sammy mouthed "Seizure" and looked back at the TV.
"Yeah me, dad, Uncle Mycroft, my Aunty Eurus and my grandparents go by our second names," Atlas laughed. "My name is Ida Atlas Elizabeth Watson-Holmes."
"Shouldn't you two be sleeping?" John asked gathering Atlas' blue blanket he'd pinched, pulling it around himself and standing to his feet. The glow of Sherlock's phone led him over to the bed.
Meanwhile, the laughter in the kitchen had masked the crash for all except Sherlock who's decision to live at high tension meant he heard her. He heard a thump and slowly excused himself.
"It is," Atlas said indignantly before looking at Sammy with a frown. "I'm suddenly feeling a little iffy."
"Red," Atlas said, tapping her thigh and heading towards the map. Sherlock watched her go before getting up, putting on a fleece and joining her.
"Is she okay? Is Atlas alright?" Sammy asked, flustered. He ran a hand through his blond curls and looked at Sherlock and saw that he was crying.
approached the crime scene. Many among the officers watched in disbelief as the normally strict Lestrade willingly let the girl in.
"Yeah, course I am. You've done a hell of a lot for me." Sherlock said, smiling at her. There was a pause of quiet company and comfortable silence.
"You can go out tonight, I can go find him for you if you would like to go out sort of now." Dr Aduba smiled.
"Atlas, are you arlight?" Sherlock said taking the glass out of her hand and setting it on the counter. She looked at him before nodding.
"Alright, alright, I think your being unreasonable though," Sophie said as Paul slowed down. "How you going to get there?"
"Thank you." Atlas said before she picked up a piece of manuscript and began to scribble something down. Before handing it to Sherlock who looked it over and nodded at her before handing it back to her. She continued to write down the melody stuck in her head leaving Mycroft to exchange relative looks with John.
"No." John said smiling. Something warm in his chest, as he came to the realisation that this was information that every dad knew about their child. "You were premature then?"
"You can't, it's not safe. And someone needs to stay with our little girls." There was a long pause of contemplation as Sherlock sighed and looked at John unguarded. "I could take Atlas."
"Ah, I haven't seen Mou yet," Mrs Hudson remarked from where she was sat in an armchair next to Sherlock who was sat in another one. Sammy, Atlas and John huddled up on the sofa. "She's got such pretty fur." She watched the fluffy white and black cat with blue eyes settle on the floor, the white mustache disappearing as she stuck her face into the back of Redbeard.
"But I didn't mean it, I promise." Atlas insisted, working herself up and becoming increasingly upset as Sherlock just rubbed her back.
"Don't talk like that," Sherlock giggled before tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. "Now, I think the doctors might be annoyed if your out of bed for too long."
"Sherlock, what are you doing?" John asked with a smile and a look that was only reserved for the family.
"That's the most I've seen her speak in a while." John said as he exited the kitchen, Atlas saying the same thing inside the kitchen.
"No, Redbeard, your not helping," Sherlock said as the dog nuzzled at the boot laces. "Yes, I love you too, thank you." The dog licked his face next and he giggled. "Atlas, control your animal."
"Hello Red." Rosie giggled as he came and sat next to her. After some time Atlas got up and sat behind her sibling, Sherlock still holding her.
"Oh, I think so. Your both good cop and bad cop but you love those kids through there. All of them," Isla said with a smile. "And that's what matters. That you love them."
Sherlock held the side of her head to his chest with his hand. Rubbing her hair with his thumb as John shuffled to give her a hug aswell, wrapping an arm around the back of Sherlock and rubbing his back.
"Out. They had a case given to them that you couldn't join them on." Mycroft said although he wasn't a good liar and Atlas knew he wasn't telling the truth. In fact she was pretty sure they were investigating the case that had been given to them the day she wore a suicide vest.
"I know." Sammy said quietly as he continued along the road. "You know, your dad's are always so kind to me. And after having just lost mine, I feel like I really needed someone to look up to that was male. Your dads, they did that for me."
"Yeah." John said putting a hand to her shoulder comfortingly. She looked like she was going to cry when Sherlock came in, assessing the situation.
"She does, papa was going to ask after her for it," Atlas grinned. "We just need to get dad out the house on his own so everyone else can sew but I was going to ask him to go for a walk tommorow."
"You are like her, just barring the...well you know..." Sherlock said, his words catching in his throat as he looked down at his daughter.
"You probably need a bit of food but you definately need some medicine and some water." John said with a little smile. "Are you in pain?"
"The poison made it happen but we believe that whilst you two were out collecting something to eat from the cafe and having a momentary break, which is, by the way, completely understandable, she may have started hallucinating. Another symptom we were predicting may occur, and when it would occur, it would put stress on her body due to the severity of the hallucinations. However, we did not anticipate them to occur so soon or for Atlas, and please don't take this the wrong way, to be quite as clever about it as she was. In her head she may have been off somewhere else but her fight instinct was clever enough to switch off her monitors
And then Mycroft joined in. His singing voice better than anyone else ever anticipated. Shutting his eyes, he blocked out the looks he anticipated he would receive.
"Yeah. I know that. I have an idea though." John said, before he got to his feet, removed his blazer, set it over his chair and stood by the bed. "Shuffle over a little."
"You were alright at me and Mary's wedding." John said, before stealing himself. Sherlock had closed his eyes. And it came to him. He wished he'd seen it but he hadn't. He'd been so late.
ATLAS was out with Timothy when John's parents arrived promptly on the doorstep of 221B. They'd been out, trying to persuade the local publisher to publish his book and so Wanda, Rosie, John, Sherlock waited in trepidation for their return. Mrs Hudson was down in Cornwall checking on some new property she had just bought, whilst Mycroft was working to stop a plan similar to Guy Fawkes.
"Is it normal?" John asked, suddenly aware that his knowledge was little. "To lose speech during a tremor."
"Language." John warned, a hand still resting on her shoulder. His head caught up in shock moments later when what Atlas had said finally came to rest. "Wait, wh-what?"
"It would be an honour, Little Holmes," Gordon smiled before he linked arms with her and led the group to the table. Sitting down, Atlas grinned as Gordon sat down on one side of her and Eddie on the other. Everyone began generalised chatter. "Been keeping well?" Gordon smiled.
Wanda Holmes was a lucky woman, and she knew it. She knew it better than anyone. Most outsiders would frown upon her, her marriage, her unconventional family. Now as she walked next to her youngest son and middle child she thought about him. Solely him. It had been a while since she had seen Sherlock but he never changed. He was always the same.
"Let's show them that song then." Sherlock smiled at Atlas as she stood and joined him. Glad that he could remember. Glad that he knew. Tentatively Atlas picked up her violin and gave it to Sherlock to play before he could pick up his own. It was a gesture that the others found touching. Sherlock smiled on response.
"Sherlock," John said again, this time pushing his weight against the door but when it didn't open he tried the handle. Only to find it wasn't locked. He opened it slowly and entered, kneeling in front of Sherlock. "Oh Sherlock, you okay." He placed his hands either side of Sherlock's face and rubbed with his thumbs. "Look at me."
"What if he wants to divorce me?" Sherlock asked as he looked at her. "I haven't told him before and then we got married...what's he going to think of me? That's the sort of thing you tell someone...right?"
Dr Aduba gave a little chuckle. "Alright," he said stopping the tap. "Your all done anyway. And we've had the conversation about you going home."
"I'm sorry too," John said. "Im also tired and it hurts to watch it happening to her. You think that it's something you can get used to but it's not."
"You taught me too, and so did Rosie and Atlas and Sammy has taught me so much aswell," John said with a bright smile. "Now, I think our lovely eldest daughter will be alright. Shall we head to bed, love?"
"In forty five minutes!" John shouted before Atlas flashed a smiled back at them. Before he looked back to where his youngest daughter was being lifted up by his fiance. Eurus was sat off to the side, pen in hand with a little notebook - from here he could tell she was sketching. Mycroft sat next to his mother on a bench near where John was sat with Timothy.
"Angelo didn't have any seating so we're going to Risto's," John said as he turned away from the city and started to drive. All the while looking to Sherlock who was looking out the window at the starry sky.
"Your papi. John." Lestrade answered. Rosie pointed to the kitchen and there John was. They started to have a developed conversation about some sort of army firearms.
"You collect Rosie and I'll get the dog," John smiled before Sherlock pulled up outside the house and they stepped out into the cold, Highland air. "Ugh, it smells the same way it did." He said before collecting their dog and making their way up to the door. Sherlock followed behind where he carried Rosie, the teenagers taking up the tail.
"I miss you guys," Atlas said with a frown. "Don't get me wrong, I like the people here and I like Jo and Harry and Isla and Peter but...there's not that ease. It's like they're treading on egg shells, like they're still trying to figure me and dad out and to a degree Sam and then even more, papa and Ro. Its not very comfortable."
"Now, Atlas, I've come to a conclusion. I'm going to suspend you until further notice." Mrs Frobisher said.
WHEN Atlas finally awoke she was pleasantly surprised to see that Sherlock and John were both sleeping. She assessed he surrounding's spotting a clock, reading the time to be 3:30am, and she was relieved. From the dark under eye's on both the men, neither had slept much in the past few hours and both had stayed here the past few days due to the stubble covering their faces.
"AND do you remember the cakes?" Sherlock smiled looking over at Mycroft. "Mummy could never find us."
"No," Mycroft sighed. "Your too bloody clever. I just get bloody migraines all the time and they never seem to get the medication right."
"Hello." Wanda smiled as she lifted her up and admired her hair now which John had stuck in this morning. "That's a very pretty bow you've got there."
"I can't really live alone," Atlas said slowly. "Not that I really want to but I don't have the choice."
"SHERLOCK? What are you doing?" John asked as he stood outside 221B with Sherlock's scarf being tied around his eyes. "This scarf needs washing, it smells like dried blood." Sherlock gave a laugh before beckoning his hand for Lestrade to pull the land rover up to outside the flat. Sherlock then led John over to the door to the land rover.
"Goodnight," Rosie said to May before leaving over to Sammy and asking how to sign it. Once he showed her she copied it to Xerxes before hugging his neck.
"Oh alright." The older lady said as she collected her jacket and scarf and departed the flat with the girl. Luckily for all of them the press had laid off about Atlas because it was nearing Christmas - although she figured that Mycroft probably put a word forward to the press.
"Oh Sherlock," Mrs Hudson chided with a grin. "Sarah is my friend and we decided to get a little cottage in Surrey."
"Hello!" Atlas exclaimed as Mycroft moved away and Atlas hugged Sammy closely. "Will you sit with me?" She asked, shuffling over on the bed to make room for Sammy to take up a space.
"Jeff goes everywhere," John said as Rosie nodded. "He always has and he always will." Rosie giggled. "And it's also why he needs to be washed regularly and also needs to go into surgery." John glanced over at his husband who was stitching the toy's neck up.
Sammy facetimed Georgia daily and watched as she gushed about the wonderful places she had been creating in her head and requested him to sing her a song.
"Papa," Atlas whispered yet again looking at him. John got to his feet before pulling her to his stomach, her temple against his abdomen. "Papa."
Later, once John had finished in the bathroom he came into the bedroom to see Atlas curled up on the bed. She had her eyes shut and she was lying on her side facing the other side of the bed. In her hand she held Whisper as John slipped under the covers and switched off the side light. Her blue eyes opened and she stared at him intensely.
Luckily for them, the man who commanded their planets, was coming home. It was slow. But Sherlock was coming
"The one with the little girl and dad found dead from poison. The son punched you in the face and the mother was arres-" Sammy said and he turned his head to look at Mrs Pertwee who suddenly got to her feet and tried to exit only to be caught by Sherlock, pinned against the wall and handcuffed.
"Rosie." Sherlock said squatting down opposite her. "Papi is going to look a little bit weird and scary alright?"
"I know. But your nearly there." Dr Aduba smiled, Atlas nodded. "I'll be by this afternoon." And then he left.
"Do you know now?" The man asked as he finally reappeared through a hole of concrete that had suddenly appeared.
"Come on," Mycroft said, gathering her to his chest as she cried. Behind her back he sent a quick text to his brother.
"Your hair's much thicker than I thought it was." Wanda remarked as she platted her eldest granchild's hair. "It's so like Sherlock's." She reminisced of the easy days with the three of them. Remembered the pirates, the swords, the beaches by the old house. Before everything turned to dust and ashes and it was simple. However, she took a step back and looked around the patio. Where the stone met the grass, Eurus was sat with a tray of assorted coloured pencils, still humming peacefully - the dog dozing sleepily beside her. Mycroft was sat in the sun with a book, squinting at the pages beneath his fingers. Through it all, she still had a family. A
Slowly, Atlas wheezed against John, a slight cough concealed. John rubbed against her back and hummed to her. He looked up to his mother with a slight smile. Atlas wheezed again a moment later and John rubbed her back again.
"You keep him right, Sam, love," John said with a smirk as Sammy nodded and put his arm around Sherlock's waist, the parent placing his around his son's shoulder.
"I can't see, Pa. Everything's blurry." Her voice came our a crackled sob as she looked at him. The look she gave John made him want to just hug her tightly and never let go because he knew. More than that he understood. He'd been with Sherlock one of times he had blurred sight and it freaked him. Losing his sight was something he wouldn't be able to handle and so by easy deduction he knew Atlas wouldn't be able to either. "Why can't - why can't I see?" She whispered, her eyes stinging as she strained her eyes to look at him. The blue eyes he had grown to love in both his better half and his daughter were shining with tears. His eyes were wide and his throat dry as he struggled to give her an answer. "Papa, please."
"Sherlock." John said with a slight smile before he found himself being almost toppled over by Sherlock as he slouched off his chair and wrapped his arms around John, cheek against chest.
Atlas sighed forcing herself to suck up all the pain she was feeling. Relief seemed to pour out of her body as she placed back and for across her room. She really missed her piano and violin as a way to distress so she chose the next best thing.
"She's very sweet." Wanda noted exchanging a smile with John who nodded in return. He had since placed the bags on the floor. Eurus and Rosie got on very well for some reason but one could assume that it was because neither were partial to chatter or speaking.
"Go sleep. I know John thinks your incapable or that your mind doesn't switch off. But your tired, dad. And when your tired you piss people off and that's when you turn to things like cases or, or drugs. So if your going to have a conversation with John, please, please go to sleep. For me?" When she pulled away Sherlock looked at her before smiling and going through the living room and into the hallway. Atlas went to bed and for once, Sherlock listened to his daughter and he too went to bed.
Mycroft was giving it his best effort to keep a frightened Rosie calm, hoisting her up on his hip. He'd long since discarded his blazer and umbrella, the water touching his knees. Under his breath - so his family did not hear him - he was whispering
"Love, breathe. It's okay." Taking her wrist, John's fingers felt a pulse before taking her hand to cover his chest. Her heart rate was far too fast for his liking and he knew that in the past, situations like these had ended in seizures. John was prepared to do anything to prevent that happening. As John took some deep breaths,  Atlas' hand moved and he knew she could feel it. "That's it. I know it hurts and it feels like you can't but it's okay. It's okay."
"I didn't want to go," Sammy admitted as he dipped his head again and they assumed he was playing with Redbeard.
It wasn't until ten minutes later that Sherlock walked into the lab to see Atlas in goggles, lab coat, hair tied back and gloves on, dropping a pipette full of liquid into a solution.
"I suppose her mother chose Elizabeth and Ida." John back handedly commented as he took the tea he had been presented with. He smiled at Mrs Hudson as he took it from her before she took it over to Sherlock.
"Jesus, I love you too." John pulled away and put his hands on either side of Sherlock's face. Brushing at the tears with the pad of his thumb. They exchanged a short kiss before Sherlock smiled goofily, John doing the same. "If it's all the same to you, you can keep which house you choose a secret."
"Your the first person to make my brother smile and besides, your the father of my nephew and niece's, you are unequivocally important," Mycroft smiled. "Don't get used to that."
"I sang it," Atlas whispered, her voice barely audible but John was able to understand the gist. "I sang it when I was in the coffin."
Unintentionally, Atlas felt her stomach rising in a panic she couldn't describe. Her hands began to shake and tears fought at her eyes like wasp stings in summer.
"Ah." She said quickly, looking at him. Carefully she wiped at her eyes before looking over to John.
"Who's that?" Sammy asked, coming to see what Atlas was looking at as she stood next to a big ornate table.
"War wound in Afghanistan." John said before the other woman gave a small smile. Just then Atlas returned and put the mushrooms in the trolley along with purple bottles of shampoo and conditioner which they hadn't picked up already.
Atlas was therefore, alone. Contemplatively, she jumped from painting, to singing, to playing violin, to plaiting her hair (and failing) before finally settling on an experiment in the lab. Setting it up, she changed into her gear, gathered a notepad and pen and set to work outlining and detailing notes ready for a write up report.
When he opened them again, his sister, mother and aunt had a arrived and were chatting away to Sherlock but Atlas slept on.
"It was a nightmare. All these people who were popping up and we had several ambulances too coming in to pick people up and they thought it was a chemical bomb or weapon and it was mayhem." John said before growing tired. "Anyway, I'll explain more tomorrow...Is that Atlas' phone?" He said spotting her phone lying on the cabinet above the dishwasher with a smashed up screen.
"Call an ambulance, her pulse is weak," Mycroft said before he looked over to Sammy who had tears in his eyes. "Hey, hey...kid..."
"Your weakness." Mrs Pertwee sneered before Atlas snapped. In a way she didn't think she would, but apparently she was wrong. With one smooth movement Atlas had pinned Mrs Pertwee to the whiteboard at the front of the class, arm twisted behind her back. The older woman giving a wicked laugh, Atlas pulling her back away from the whiteboard.
"I was going to." Sherlock said, looking at the floor as he scuffed his foot over it. His beige robe hanging slightly off his shoulder. John walked over, still looking angry causing Sherlock to take some barefoot steps backwards. He walked into the chair and for a flickering moment looked like a rabbit in the headlights. But what hurt John most was that he looked
sooner. Wish I'd known that my best friend had a daughter." Atlas pulled away, looked at him before going back to the hug.
"If it's any justification, I don't think you would have been far off that talk anyway." The man said - or rather Dr Irvine said - John shooting him a look before returning to his office. Plonking into his chair he looked at the clock and sighed. It wasn't long until his next patient.
"Your only lucky I let you have spleen with an 'a' in it." Mycroft said as he looked at the girl opposite him.
"Why- Why would I do that?" Atlas asked, confused before she looked back at the book. It was an album, old, well kept, not completely full.
"Okay. She is currently still unconscious and we don't know how much of an affect the alcohol has had on her system. " The doctor informed quietly. "I suggest you call other family members to see to your children."
"Alright, I see what you mean," Kate frowned. "The lorazepam isn't making a difference and I don't want to give her too much. And you've tried diazepam. How much lorazepam does she take a day?"
"You seem less enthusiastic about it, Atlas," John said and Atlas just shot him a glare in the wing mirror.
"What the hell?" Peter exclaimed. "Sophie, since when did you have a vendetta against everyone within the LGBTQIA+ community?"
"We'll go for breakfast when he's finished," John smiled before he looked back at his book. Atlas then, removed her own coat and boots and walked over to John. Sitting on the mattress next to his knees she waited for him to put the book down. He did so quite quickly and looked at her expectantly before she leaned forward and hugged his middle. Cheek to chest. "Alright, love?"
"No. He's cool." Sammy said before Atlas looked at him skeptically. "Oh and by the way. If your looking for a friend, I am too right now. Job's going." He smirked causing Atlas to do the same. "Come on, Monday morning rush hour starts early in London. We'll be able to get into some coffee shops will open within the next hour and a half." He said before providing her a hand. The light was just coming in and judging by the traffic it meant that it was approximately 4:30am.
"She's been shivering on and off all day," Sammy frowned. "Except for when she's sleeping or for twenty-minute intervals."
"And it's not a fuss. You are not a problem. You are not at fault. You are a person," John smiled his hands either side of her face. "Your our little girl."
"Oh, that reminds me," John said with a smile, picking Rosie up and plopping her down on the sofa before he disappeared upstairs.
IT was the 27th of December and Atlas was panicking. She'd managed for so long to make her own concoction of pills to keep her condition at bay. But now? Now she was scared. She'd run out of the two boxes of over the counter medication and she panicked. This wasn't good. She knew she wouldn't be able to get anymore. Lestrade was currently speaking to John and she'd just been to see Sherlock who was in Rosie's room helping her tidy up. All this panicking was making her throat dry so she hustled to the kitchen and gathered a glass of water.
"The only problem is, is they make my hands shake. The proper medicine doesn't do this." Atlas said as she let more tears falls from her eyes. "I thought I had enough left to last me just a little longer. If you've observed right you'll have noticed I haven't been playing my...my instruments." Atlas answered.
"Never." John said finally before he came round and stood in the ditch opposite her. "Atlas, never. That would never happen and will never happen."
"No comment." He laughed, sharing a look with Atlas who smirked. She knew fine well it was real, she just didnt know where it had come from. Rosie yawned loudly before laughing all over again. Then John lay down under the covers, Atlas and Rosie going underneath aswell. Rosie and Atlas lay facing each other, Sherlock on his side as Atlas lay on her back, Rosie of course copying. They were so close to each other that they only took up a half of the bed. Yet they weren't ready for sleep yet and they continued to speak. John was lying with Rosie like a mirror, one hand stroking through Atlas' hair.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Sherlock asked in a very un-sherlock like way before Atlas shook her head.
"Atlas?" A voice called in the darkness before someone slipped to her side and into the chair beside her.
"John." He smiled, taking the piece of paper. He flicked it over in his hand, the name written on the back of a business card. Sighing he thought of the last time he had been given a phone number in a romantic way. By Eurus. And then his mind went to Sherlock. That brilliant man, who'd he'd promised to marry, to love. The man he was so in love with that it ached. The children he had with him that made their house a home.
"I wish I'd been here to help arrange things with Sammy, to help with Atlas' appointment. I spent the whole time on my mission just wanting to be at home. I wanted to come home, I didn't want to be there. I wanted-" Sherlock stopped and looked at John. "I wanted...no, I needed...you."
It was only himself and John sitting in the hospital room, Mycroft having left quite a lot earlier. John had long since gone to sleep, but he couldn't, he never could. He always found his brain to be too alert, too awake but this was not the case in this moment. He needed to be awake, just in case she woke up. Just in case.
"I want to live with Atlas and Rosie and Redbeard and Sherlock and I've wanted to for months. Before Georgia had cancer, before Atlas was ill." Sammy said exasperatedly. "Mum, I love you and I love Georgia but I don't love the street on which we live and I want to live at home."
"HELLO!" Wanda smiled into Timothy's iPad as they looked at John who was on the other side but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
"Now, Rosamund, how's about you show me these lights," Mycroft said, lifting her up as she nodded and put Jeff on top of his head and started talking to him.
Sherlock chuckled before lifting Rosie off his lap and moving his chair to the other side, Sammy doing the same.
"Think I'm going to go back to sleep again." Atlas smiled, before John wriggled closer and wrapped his arms around her again.
IT wasn't a long drive to Sherlock's parents house, but it would be due to traffic. You can't imagine somewhere to be busy on Christmas Eve, shoppers piling into every shop on the high street. Then you haven't met the British, unorganised to the point where last minute shopping is swiftly creeping into fashion and last minute deals are certainly not a strange set of affairs.
"Would you, like to hold this piece of kitchen roll just underneath her mouth?" John asked as Rosie nodded. "And don't worry if you see blood, she sometimes bites her tongue or mouth." Rosie took the cloth and gently, in a way only children can, kept it there. "That's it, good girl."
"You were." Sherlock said quietly, rubbing gently. "You have been poisoned. And you may feel like you can do anything but we have a long way to go. You won't even be able to take two steps yet before keeling over."
"Go to sleep sweetheart," John whispered as he reached out a hand to brush the hair off her forehead, his eyes on her. His eyes moved quickly up and over to the door as Sherlock knocked. He looked as though he had been crying.
"It's a womens fit," Atlas said before Sherlock offered an outstretched hand. "Alright, thank you, it's quite heavy because there's loads of water."
Thirty four minutes after class began and Mr Fraggerty came into the classroom and asked to speak to her.
"Dinner?" He asked turning around sharply. "Would you join us for tea tonight? At Gordon and Beattie's pizza House?"
"I'll do you one better. I'll let her look through some solved government cases at MI5." A pause for a few moments. "I assume everything came."
"Your songs are better than papi's or daddy's." Rosie giggled looking at Atlas before continuing to colour the outline of a dog that looked remarkably like Rebeard. Then again, it could very well be Redbeard, considering that Eurus quite often drew pictures of things for Rosie to colour in. All sorts of outlines and colours littered every room of the house, even rooms Rosie hardly ever visited.
"Hey," Sherlock said with a smile, his hand going to her forehead. She opened her mouth to speak but he shushed her. "Shhh, don't speak, sweetheart." He paused. "Are you in pain?"
There were five bedrooms, Sherlock and John, Atlas and Rosie, Mycroft, Wanda and Timothy and then Eurus on her own. In the utility Redbeard would sleep. Eventually Eurus and Mycroft appeared from the kitchen...
"I was poisoned." Atlas whispered before looking up at her dad, who still had a hand stroking through her hair.
"I was once." Sherlock said rubbing his hands over his face. "Do you know I used to be the odd one out? In a school full of people who didn't like me. The things they used to call me and say...say to me. I never felt anything hit me as hard or hurt as much." John looked at him. "As - and I swear this was on me - when you backed me into a corner and I said "I killed his wife." And you replied."
"You knew that that's what I would want," Atlas smiled as Sherlock giggled as they continued. "This is nice. Like...I love the rest of them...they are my family...they are my best friends but you dad. You'll always be my dad....so will papa....ugghhh...you know what I mean."
MYCROFT and Eurus picked up Sammy and Rosie a few hours later leaving John and Sherlock to sit with Atlas for most of the evening.
"Can we papa? Please?" Rosie asked, swinging on his hand as they made their way out of the airport and out the big front doors. What worried John most was that the airport was small. And then he was moreso worried that the flight was ordered in by Mycroft. It had to be something high profile. It had to be.
"Alright sweetheart?" John said. "God, your freezing. Sammy has your meds." Atlas detached herself and walked over to him, hugging him tightly.
"Shall we go and see if Sherlock and your dad are awake yet?" Atlas asked, Rosie nodded and she escorted her out of the bedroom. Instead of going to the bedroom, Rosie led her down the stairs. Atlas knew that if either of them would be up they'd be downstairs.
Sherlock shook his head before lying back against the pillow, John leaning on his elbow, rubbing his chest with gentle fingers.
Pulling in to the forest they all hopped out of the car, opened the boot and began walking along the forest track. Sammy and Atlas hanging near the back.
"I'm not either," John said with tears in his eyes. "I don't want her to die either." He sat down and looked at Sherlock. "And she's not going to, okay?"
Martha smiled before the three of them led her into the open space and they all sat on various items of furniture, each of them smiling. The warmth from the circular stove was flowing through them and Mrs Hudson sparked up conversation, Redbeard settling at her feet.
"I love you too, sweetheart," John said rubbing her back as she leaned against him. Atlas put her head on the table, temple on the wood before Sammy stood up and himself, Rosie and John made their way to the shelves of sweets and food for the remainder of the journey.
"I want you to come home too." John said with a sigh. "But Atlas, its only another week of making sure your all OK."
"I'm...I'm not ready." Atlas sobbed into Sherlock as John came to sit next to the man cradling their daughter.
"Alright. Shall we go make the bases so they have time to rise?" John asked as he put a hand to Rosie's hair, causing her to look up. She gave a nod and Sammy rose to his feet. Once downstairs, they began to pull out the ingredients required to make their pizza bases.
ATLAS resigned to her bedroom Friday evening, sitting in the quiet. Thurday, had been difficult - more "chats" with Mrs Pertwee. She'd spent a heap of time hiding away in Mr Fraggerty's store cupboard at the back of his class. There, he had assembled a work desk for her to use. Now, in the Friday night light, she was running through everything in her head. She thought her mind was indestructible but Mrs Pertwee had managed to break her down in four days.
"Everyone leave. Incase it's the wrong one, everyone needs to leave." Atlas said whilst Sherlock frowned and looked at her in refusal. Slowly they all left except for Sherlock. "You need to go too, I can look in the mirror and snip it for myself."
"Your beautiful," John whispered. "And I'm so proud of you for looking after Atlas the way you did. For caring for her, for never giving up." Before Sherlock rested his forehead against John's forehead and closed his eyes. "And all that you've ever done, are all the reasons I love you. Giving her violin lessons from her bed and just being you, for being the kind ever loving...
Atlas collected her coat and the dog lead, the rest of the family following begrudgingly in suit. They didn't know where they were being led, but suddenly they didn't care either. They followed her as she carried on down several alleyways before coming out into a section of woodland. Then she let the dog off the lead and continued on down the path.
"I'll...uhh..." John said as he stepped back. "I'll...yeah..." The man turned away and walked down the hallway.
That afternoon Mycroft made the ten minute car journey to the hospital. It was ten minutes due to the heavy traffic and everything else that was going on. He slowly walked into the room to find his brother alone. He assumed Atlas had gone home with Rosie for a while and were due to return, maybe with Mrs Hudson as she was due back from Cornwall.
"I FEEL like that was successful." Atlas said whilst picking up several mugs of tea and placing them on the kitchen table. Sherlock raised his eyebrows whilst also helping move the mugs. "I tried."
"Sherlock." John said, coming in and standing by his friend. He put a hand in his shoulder as he put his mug into the sink then stayed when Sherlock didn't speak. "Are you alright?"
"Big breath Rosamund." Mycroft said as the girl listened to him taking a big breath and following his lead. However, the glass wasn't splitting. Mycroft leaving Rosie to hold her breath and sink down went to the glass and put all his weight into kicking it forcefully, once then twice then stopped. A crack and crickle and a flood of water at the ankles of two worried fathers, a worried aunt, a worried sister, a worried brother and a worried brother-in-law. Rosie's little body slid over crackled class as she opened her mouth taking in some water. It happened so fast and before she knew it was happening she was lying in the floor her dads looking at her and checking she was alright. Aside a scratch just above her left eye and a stomach full of water the young girl was alright. John looked at Sherlock.
"Float." John said shortly. "You have to float." Mycroft begrudgingly did so as they started to reach the full capacity of the tank. The water speed increasing as they got closer.
"Oh, Ida, I love you too." Mycroft said proudly, as he began to rub the other hand. "I'll always look after you too."
"So goodbye yellow brick road." Atlas sang before the low buzz returned. Her thoughts had been drifting all over the place, her head was thumping. She couldn't keep a track of what she was thinking and the thoughts that did come were all so
Then he remembered the hospital, the electricity jumping between them as Sherlock heaved sobs over his broken daughter. He remembered the same feeling the day they bought the christmas tree and then he frowned, took a swig of whisky and gulped. Oh shit.
"When I die, donate my body to medical research," Sherlock said before he looked at John gently. "I know it's maybe not what you want-"
"We can manage," Atlas grumped before she walked forward and flopped onto the double bed, Rosie flopping down beside her. Before Sammy joined them, Redbeard sniffing around the room.
sounded happy. This was his family, his house, his home and she was filled with relief. Her little boy, who should of been the one being protected, was the one who used to protect herself and Harriet.
"He's a fan of dogs," Ruth said, nodding to Redbeard who was sprawled across his dog bed between the piano and the instrument cases stacked against the red sofa.
"Oh, love," He whispered as he held her head still, unconcious. Tears in his eyes as he kissed her hair over and over again.
"Yes. You would be right." Mycroft smiled, to his surprise the girl he had just spent the evening with placed down her mug and engulfed him in a hug. Less cold than his brother but still a genius that could outsmart an entire room.
"It's not though is it?!" She screamed at him. "Dad, it's important because I was six and it was my fault you did it!" She screamed at him through sobs, John looking at Sherlock pointedly.
"What?" Atlas asked looking up at him whilst her bottom lip wobbled. She felt John standing beside her, a gentle arm wrapping over part of her back.
"I'm bored Mycroft." Atlas groaned on the other side of the line. There was a pause before a rustle and an excited chirp. "I bought some ingredients. Can I come over and bake?" There was silence. "Please, John and Sherlock have gone out on a case and they told me I couldn't go."
"Don't be like that." Molly scolded, withdrawing her hand to take a sip from her tea. "And besides," Teacup still to mouth, "We're going to be needing some help around our house soon."
"Yeah," John said. "Unless her seizures stop completely and they're not going to. Atlas doesn't even know but I think she does, somewhere in the back of her mind."
"Ehh, well, yes...sort of." Eurus stammered through the phone as John looked down at Sherlock who was opening and closing for his fist in request for the phone.
"Yeah sure." Atlas smiled, before she looked at him. "Do you want me to improvise some stuff over it on the piano for now? Or just leave it?"
"Georgia." He replied quickly, as he ran a finger down the spine of 'The Illiad'. Atlas spotted the boxes of new books over to the side, she could smell them.
"Hey, aside from the big obvious thing, what's up?" Sammy asked looking at her with those forest green eyes.
"Gee." Atlas said as they arrived the emotion suddenly catching them all off guard. Xerxes laid out the pencils that he repeatedly pinched off Abayomi and always
"Atlas." He said gently. "Atlas, it's just a dream." Firmly, he rubbed his thumb over her shoulder. "Wake up, it's just a dream, love." He sat down on the sofa near her and continued to soothe her until she began to mumble something.
"No." John said with a smile. "We only have one car and your dad is doing the school run this morning. We're going to have to catch the bus. Slide the back door open a little though." Atlas did so before she pulled on her yellow high tops and put on her dark blue coat - the last one got wrecked with acid - which resembled Sherlock's.
"Yes," Sherlock sighed as he sat back in the seat. "It's just social situations and...well...instructions."
"Right then miss." John said coming into the kitchen and squatting down infront of her. "What's this drawing?" He gestured to the piece of paper in her hand with a smile. But then Rosie's little facade began to break and her light blue jacket arm - which was so like Atlas and Sherlock's - was drawn up to hide her eyes. Her lips parted in a young child cry and she found herself crying into her arm, Jeff falling to the floor. John collected Jeff and placed him on the kitchen cabinet before going back down to her, wrapping his arms around her, being careful not to crinkle the picture. Lifting her off the ground, she begin to cry child like sobs, shrieking into John's shoulder.
"I don't know because it's not something an average sixteen year old would do." John said exasperated, concern flooding the lines of his face. "Ever."
"Ok." Sherlock whispered against her hair before kissing and sitting back a little, his hands remaining where they were.
Twenty one minutes after the class began and Sammy and Abayomi were issued a detention too. Loyal friends.
"I would have said something and I'm really sorry that I didn't." Atlas said. "I just couldn't bring myself to."
"Oh, he's off writing. You know what he's like. Your grandad has a new idea for a novel but he wants to co-write," Wanda smiled. "With you."
"Sherlockian. Papa called it Sherlockian once." Rosie said before Atlas smiled. "I don't find it very difficult. Why don't people like Atlas and daddy, Papa?"
"They're gay. Our dads," Sammy muttered appearing. "They're a couple. Atlas is biologically the curly haired man's but the old man is our papa. We call them dad and papa."
"It said that in families where there are two fathers, gay parents like you and me," John said, Sherlock's eyes flickering open to look up at him. "There are a more motherly figure and fatherly figure. Atlas said a while ago that we have the roles of both mother and father, which makes sense. But you don't suppose that we both behave more stereotypically one way?"
Next Atlas saw that John was moved, she began the build up melody for the pre-chorus - hitting a few wrong notes on the small device but John didn't seem to notice.
"It's okay," Sherlock comforted as she gripped onto his arms. "Look at me, I've got you. I've got you. I'm here. I'm here, duck. I've got you. I love you. It's okay. It's okay."
After much discussion with Timothy and Wanda the following schedule was arranged. Seeing as Rosie still believed in Santa it was imperative that they kept up the tradition she'd followed every year. In addition, Atlas would have to receive them too so that Rosie could believe that she still got them because Atlas was still a child.
"Oh and by the way, we need you to be thoroughly prepared for any situation we may find ourselves in."
"Yeah, I'm right here sweetheart," John whispered rubbing her back reassuringly before she looked up at him.
"Before we travel any further, all of you have remembered your presents for people I hope?" John said quietly. Atlas put her ear down to Rosie's mouth after the younger girl had tugged on her sleeve.
"Okay," Atlas frowned before starting. "So, we'd been sat happy and then I ran off to get Whisper." She stopped. "And he'd been sat at the fire with this tartan blanket he liked so much. And he'd had a brain hemorrhage. One of those freak things that suddenly just happen and remind you how short life really is. And its something like 30% to 60% of people who have one don't survive depending on where the bleed is. I walked over to the chair he was in and I jumped onto his knee. The way that kids do. And I tried to wake him..." She sobbed in the gap and tried to contain it as they tried to shake through her body. "And his head just rolled and I knew. I'm not stupid."
"No!" Atlas screamed, hitting her head with her bloodied hands. "Fuck off! This isn't real! Fuck off! Piss off! No! Get off!" She was sobbing now and it felt like the ground was swallowing her whole. Eating and tearing her apart and eating and driving the very-
"We're lucky they didn't ask to look at the ID." Sherlock asked, as he put his wallet into one of the compartments. He switched on the car and pulled out the car parking space, beginning down the road. "We'll nip into the Tesco just here too." He pulled in not even a minute later and pulled into a spot. "We need some more shopping anyway. Some condiments after
"How was the music shop then?" Jo asked Atlas quietly who looked up to meet the eyes of the people round the table.
"PAPA," Atlas said quietly. "Can I chat to you?" She asked, as she waited near the back of the room, Sherlock, Sammy and Rosie following in behind him.
Sherlock was bent over on the bed, his head lying on the mattress. John was over in a seat, slumped down but blissfully asleep. She sighed, what was she going to do with them. For now she would sleep, she still had enough morphine left to last her till doctor's round's in the morning.
"I know. He only smiles when he's really relaxed and comfortable with people. Either that or when he's drunk or high. And he hasn't been high since I moved in." Atlas smiled before taking a seat at the kitchen table.
"I remember. I reported it," Mr Thomson said with a smile as Sherlock's eyes went wide and Atlas trusted her impulse to hug him tightly. Wrapping her arms around him she smiled.
"Ugh, why does everyone start a conversation like that?" Sherlock asked as he began to roller on some yellow. Already getting his shirt spattered in paint - Atlas had already told him to take his blazer off otherwise John really would get cross.
"This one!" She squealed holding up 'The Hobbit' by J.R.R Tolkien as Sherlock smiled. "Papa and At are always talking about it."
"You'll be needing storage unit number 456." The man said before Sherlock smiled and they were allowed through the barrier. Sherlock followed the signs to the section that they needed. More and more garage doors to add to the maze before finally, he stopped, deducing where 456 was.
"I remember...who was it...Liam doing it to you and you had to fix it," Sammy said with a smile. "Man, that turned dark. Sorry for bringing-"
Suddenly, she leaned forward and put her arms around John's shoulder. Putting her chin on his shoulder, she sniffed a little and John rubbed at her back. "I'm here."
"I can only remember it a little from when she was younger..but it hadn't, hadn't really y'know manifested." Sherlock explained, looking straight ahead of him. "I think it's there, waiting to pounce. I think it has, sometimes pounced. And I think she is scared to death of going into a school full of people who aren't going to understand her or want to understand her." John didn't speak, only listened to what he was saying.
"What-what happened? What? I..." Atlas asked as she tried to pull the mask off and then her eyes met icy blue ones that matched her own. Soft and gentle and urgent and kind and...
"I don't know, say...no?" Harry laughed slightly before it died. "Anyway, if it's any help, there's a spare bed at Isla's. She's your mum so I'm sure she'll take you if you ask."
"Hey, Red," Atlas whispered as she waited for the kettle to finish. Finally it went off and she hastily picked it up but the shaking in her hands made it too difficult and she picked up the cup and threw it into the sink. The mug broke and she was left staring at the pieces before sitting down on the floor and leaning against the cabinet. "Breathe, Atlas. Just breathe." She paused and looked around the half lit room with a frown and tears streaking her pale face. "Fuck." She said loudly, scrubbing her eyes and leaning her head on her knees. "I can't breathe. I can't do this."
"I'll get you a bucket to put by your bed okay?" Sherlock said before disappearing and then she turned to John with glossy eyes.
"Ugh, Jem!" She scolded. "What have I told you?" She picked her up and flounced away as Sherlock pulled open the door with a smile.
As they entered the house, Atlas smiled, before them was a little bit for their coats and jackets, shoes and umbrellas. To their left a huge open space and to their right there was another door which - when Atlas poked her head in out of curiosity - she discovered contained a comfortable sized bathroom. Directly infront, she noticed the coat rack and shoe rack but also a spot for putting shoes to dry on the radiator. It was then she noticed the rack aswell for hanging out wet clothing. In addition to this, on the wall nearest the bathroom there was a set of stairs. She assumes they led up to the second floor, of which the website explained their were bedrooms.
"Yes. And I am Alexander Mycroft Chad Holmes. Hate the Chad. And Eurus was Jessica Eurus Tiffany Holmes." Mycroft replied smoothly as the chocolate chips were finally added the he main batter.
"SAMMY'S mum will be here in a few." Atlas said walking into the living room and sitting down on the piano stool. Sammy coming in to sit on the floor by her feet. Sherlock standing looking out the window, John sat on the sofa with Rosie. Timothy and Wanda were staying with Mycroft for another day before heading home.
"Atlas Holmes!" Mrs Frobisher shouted from the door, Atlas slamming her into the whiteboard once more. She collected her things leaving the classroom in silence. Sammy was the only one seriously concerned because whatever had just happened was not Atlas being Atlas. That was primal instinct, he'd studied it once when they were at the library. She was saving herself and in that moment he knew that something else was going on as to why Mrs Pertwee had chosen Atlas to pick on. And he had to find out why.
"Mum...Mum wasn't always like that was she?" Atlas asked, before her dad only just rubbed her shoulder and looked down at her. He shook his head, before Atlas reached up and gave him a proper hug. "You said it didn't hurt you, to kill her. But it did."
"No, I want them to stay. They're our family. If I end up napping against someone, I don't give them permission to care." Atlas said, making John chuckle as he sat down on the floor, groaning. "You don't have to sit on the floor."
"Wait...your serious?" John asked, sounding in disbelief. Sherlock looked even more upset that time around.
"I KNOW your going to roll your eyes at this. But are you okay, love?" John asked as he walked into the kitchen quite late to see Atlas typing away on her laptop. He walked over and shut it before slipping into the seat next to her.
"Love," John said quietly before the traffic infront began to creep, but only a little and then it stopped again. A police officer was making his way along the cars and he turned up at theirs.
"I haven't decided. Do I give you guys somewhere to go to grieve me or do I give you the air in which to grieve me?" John asked before he frowned. "Cremation probably. Let me be in the wind."
THE hand of a girl lingered momentarily, inches from the wooden door of 221B. Dark brown curls hung next to her face as a pair of blue eyes peered through round spectacles. There was no mistaking who this girl could be, not even the dumbest person could ignore the hair and especially as she stood outside the very house with said person inside. Her closed hand made contact with the wood and a loud knock echoed through the building. An older woman of around 70 answered the door, smiling when she saw the girl.
But then something must have happened, because that's when the rain started to lash down on her. She felt it running down her temple and down her right forearm, pooling on the ground. And then something else must've happened because before long she found herself short of breath and with immense pain in her chest. And within moments of that happening the noises in her head stopped and her ears were filled with a persistent drone as the starry sky began to darken and the light began to fade.
"It's alright." She replied, before filling the kettle and switching it on. "I'm fifty pages off." The book was waggled in the air before being dropped down onto the bench again as the kettle boiled.
"Grey hair? Where? Have I got another one?" Sherlock asked frantically pulling at his hair to try and see it infront of his eyes.
"Ok, ok. I'm c-coming." Sherlock stuttered, his eyes welling up. "We-We're coming." He grabbed John's hand into his own as the older man came to sit down. As soon as he hung up, John looked over to see Sherlock bowing his head between his knees and breathing heavily. Inhaling and exhaling in an unsteady, cautious rhythm.
"Okay. I'm assuming your her dad." The man asked as he began to check over Atlas. "Hello Atlas. My name is Quentin and this is Jen."
"Yeah," Sherlock smiled as he got up off his chair and sat behind her. He gently took her hair in his hand through it and pulled the paddle brush through her hair. Smoothing it over and over again with a small smile. "Oh love, it's such a tangle."
"Speaking of London," John said. "Grandma and grandad are video calling later and Aunty Eurus said she would join the call."
"John?" Sherlock asked, putting a reassuring hand to his back and rubbing with his thumb. "It's okay."
"A bit better," Atlas confessed before Sammy came in and sat down next to her. She launched and tackled him into a hug which he took gladly and smiled.
"Come on, Sam," John said getting to his feet with a smile. "Back to bed." Sammy looked to Atlas then up at John with a smile. Pulling him to his feet John followed him out the door. "Try to go back to sleep."
"I am," Atlas said as Sherlock had the gun on his temple instead. "Where are your documents?" Then her eyes landed on a cardboard box on the table and she stood.
"Hey, hey, Atlas, don't apologise," John whispered as she sobbed and his heart ached. This wasn't fair. "Did you have a nightmare? Is that why your down here?"
"Harry?" John asked as he got closer and noticed his sisters black eye. When she blinked her eyes open she clutched onto his arms and he hauled her to her feet. "Harry can you hear me?"
"And that even when she's at home, she's upset and sad and she's just not her," Sammy said quietly. "And it makes me so sad."
Then John moved away and she was standing. On her own. But the hardest part was to come. Taking one step, she wiggled her toes and brought the other foot to join it.
After about three hours of sitting in the room for Rosie and Sherlock, three and half for Mycroft and Eurus and about half an hour for John and Atlas the concrete slid to reveal glass. It was infact not three little concrete rooms but one large one separated by glass. Eventually everyone was stood (barring Rosie) looking at one another. They didn't know where to begin.
Carefully, she unravelled her legs and moved to sit next to him, wrapping her arms around his torso.
"Hello," The police officer said. "I was just coming to update you but I've noticed your daughter shaking in the back. Is everything okay?"
"I love you too." John said pulling away and putting his hands on either side of the teens face. "Now, go see your sister."
He assumed before realising that Atlas had referred to him as pa. The one she fell out with or something. "I'm a friend of Atlas."
"Thank you Mrs Hudson." Atlas smiled in return as she took the cup. Mycroft hovered in the door. "I'm sensing your departure...Uncle."
"Atlas." Wanda added, smiling slowly to herself. "If it's not out of place to say this and I firmly believe it is not. Then I believe you should adopt her. Sherlock has already adopted Rosie as far as I know."
"Uh...Sorry. Sherlock and John aren't here." Atlas said putting a hand to her face before removing it.
"I think it was the teenage daughter." She replied quickly handing it back, Sherlock nodding in agreement before he continued to type.
A little while later they were talking into more detail about they wanted to do it. An after party for certain relatives and friends. Sherlock made a note to talk to John about Harry. He deserved at least one family member at his wedding. Maybe he could push him to reconcile things with Jo. Maybe not.
Rosie appeared at the door at roughly 7:15pm and proceeded to look at her. Must be saying goodnight, not bothering to look. But yet she lingered. Her prescence distracting her. Her thoughts getting in the way. Everything getting in the way.
"It's just you and me now, love," John said as he put his hand on his knee. "So come on, what's going on?" But Atlas just shook her head. "Is it all sitting in your stomach? Has it just been building up a bit these last few days?"
"Something my dad says to me or my other dad when we do something that's not good behaviour." Atlas said quietly before she looked directly ahead of her again. The boy didn't respond for a little while and Atlas added. "Normally, by this point, I've been called a freak, beaten up or spat at." He looked at her seriously before holding out a hand for her to shake.
THE next day brought a bigger problem. Second period. Miss Frobisher had not yet turned up. Five minutes later and in came Mrs Pertwee with her yellow handbag. Sitting on a row of three, Atlas was sat with Sammy and Abayomi. The trio having still gone to the library the night before, but later than expected. Mrs Pertwee having confiscated her phone before she could send a hurried text to John explaining that she would be late.
Then she played the music and was surprised to find that it spoke to her, telling her a story. She was so close to reaching the section that Sherlock was needing help with and then she played. Atlas played something that came straight from her heart and onto the violin and Sherlock wrote it down. He smiled at himself as he realised he was right to ask her to play as she fixed his broken melody.
"We did warn at the beginning that we may see an episode of cardiac arrest albeit very rare." Doctor Aduba supplied helpfully.
"Do you want to see her?" Dr Khris said reappearing. "I can take you to see her before she goes into theatre."
Sherlock's attention was fully drawn now as Atlas began speaking in her sleep. John followed Sherlock's gaze over the room.
"It's just an alert," Atlas said. "Before seizures I either have loads of absence seizures, jerky limbs, babbling or mouth clicks and eye movement."
"This is a password and username for Audible by Amazon. I have no use for it. But I know you will." Atlas said smiling. Due to her keen eye and observation skills she figured that small text was largely a no-go with the stubborn man.
