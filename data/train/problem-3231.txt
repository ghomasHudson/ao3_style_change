Emma stood there for a moment, looking from Rick to Shane. There was tension there, but she couldn't quite tell what it was. She watched as Shane finally sat down, looking away with something written on his face that almost looked like shame...almost but not enough for whatever it was. She took a moment observing everyone. She walked over to Rick, but it almost looked like it was out of duty and not out of support or love. "You can do it honey," she whispered in his ear. What a condescending bitch, Emma thought to herself. It may have been a whisper, but she whispered loudly enough for people to hear her.
Once they come to a stop Tara puts the stand up so the bike stays upright. And then gets off the bike taking her bow with her as she looks around at the highway and all the cars. No one had made it yet.. she looked back at Emma she wasn’t sure what to do.. did everyone get out ok.. she knew Daryl could take care Of himself yet she still worries. “ are... are you ok? You're not hurt are you?? “ she then looks Emma over.
She didn't want power over anyone though. She never did. Right now all she wanted to do was survive and maybe, just maybe she could join this group...at least for a little while. She watched the group a while longer as they went through the vehicles, but it wasn't long before someone else in the group noticed her. A man standing on top of an RV looked at her and called out for someone by the name of Rick and pointed directly at her and the other two. The man on top of the RV turned around, looking off into the distance.
Emma overheard the conversation between Daryl and the woman he called Carol. She took off at a run without saying anything, going in the direction where Tara had taken off, finally slowing down as she noticed Tara's foot prints. She looked at the ground for indentions and continued following her footsteps, her machete now in her hands. She crept slowly to the woods, paying attention to where she was going, but also looking at the ground. The footsteps were pretty fresh. She had to be getting close.
“Listen, stay outside the shed and don’t come in unless you think you need to. We’ll take care of things.” Tara then looks over at Emma, her mask slowly slipping into place to get into her role.
Daryl and Tara stayed quiet and watched the drama unfold . Rick watched over the debate. His eyes every once and a while glanced over to Daryl, but it didn’t stay too long on him and turned his attention back to the others. Andrea then takes a step up.
Daryl can feel the others come out of the house as well seeing the herd for themselves. And no one really knew what to do. Daryl then looked over at the people behind him” turn off the lights and get everything together and to the cars! Be fast and only grab what is needed ! We have to leave.” He hops over the rail and gets to work taking down the walkers that are the closest to the farm house. Tara looks over at Emma and takes a dead breath.” We will hold them off for as long as we can... me and Daryl can get on a bike to make a fast getaway. If we get split up, the highway where we lost Sophia is where we should all meet up. As soon as you're packed get out Emma, don’t wait and don’t get dead.”
Tara stayed close to Emma, always watching where she wasn’t. As Emma took down the lone walker she keeps an eye open for any more, yet none came. She then spots the door at the same time and moves with her, opening the door quietly once Emma was in she slides in as well. She looks around, her eyes then caught movement. A walker in scrubs, it got about half way up before it drops back down to the ground with a bolt in the side of the head. It looked like it was the only one here. She walks over and grabs the bolt, looking for anything they could use. She then grabs an abandoned duffle bag and walks over to Emma.
“Looks like she was here. But I think she got over powered.” Daryl nodded and looked at his sister's faint tracks.
"Do you mind if I make one further request? Maybe just one gun. Keep a look-out with a gun on the RV, just to try to keep everyone safe. It's scary out there right now," she smiled innocently.
Emma dropped the duffle bag as she was grabbed and pushed under the car. Her machete had fallen off as she went under. She grabbed the weapon by sliding her hand beneath the car quickly and brought it back, clutching it against her person. She let out a slow breath before the monsters edged closer to them. She then held in her breath, mostly out of nervousness. In the woods, she hadn't ever seen quite this big of a herd come through. A few stragglers here and there, but nothing quite this large. This was the whole reason she generally stayed in the woods. She quietly moved onto her stomach, like Tara, holding her weapon close to her. Under the other cars, she saw other members of the group. A couple of kids were hidden beneath the car, a couple women, the men she had already met and a few she hadn't. God, she hoped no one got caught. This would be a feast for the mass of monsters coming for them.
"Its okay, Rick," she told him with a chuckle. "You'll live to see another day." She took out a pack of ciggs from her duffle bag. This would be the first one she had in a couple days now. She handed one to Daryl. She breathed in the sweet taste of nicotine, feeling the smoke enter her throat and caress her lungs, the troubles of the past couple days ever so slightly ebbing away. "What did you want to talk to us about? We'll catch Tara up later."
Rick took a calming breath and ran a hand down his face. Emma was right, he was still hurt but Daryl was right as well. His eyes then shifted over looking over their shoulders.
Emma looked around at the cars as the groups got into the respective vehicles. For the most part it looked like all the room would be taken up so Emma walked over to Tara. "Mind my company again?" She asked.
She smiled at his final comment. "For better or worse, I've got your back, just like I have Tara and Daryl's. We'll figure something out."
They all crowded around Hershel as Rick hacked away at his leg. In mere seconds the limb was removed. Emma nodded to Rick, not wanting to say that he was right...not wanting to scare Maggie or Glenn. Even as she heard someone say duck, Emma was already almost in a trance, ignoring the warning to duck. She knew the others would take care of whatever issue was happening. She pulled off her flannel, then lifted up Hershel’s mangled leg, wrapping it up. She folded the sides of it around the leg and wrapped the arms of her flannel in a knot, tight enough to stay on despite the slippery blood and tight enough to keep pressure, but not too tight as to make the bleeding worse.
That had been a hard one, just keeping Daryl from killing anyone, especially Officer friendly. Then making the move to the CDC. A stupid ass move to get a dead mans help. Her and Daryl had already come to a decision about the walkers and that was zero tolerance, for walkers or for them to become them.
Tara and Daryl watched Lori go after Rick, heard the yells and then Emma walking over to pull Lori away. Rick said nothing as Lori came at him. All the doubt and guilt coming back. But his face had stayed calm and in control, although the smack now starts to smart a little he doesn’t let it show. His eyes then move to Emma as she takes Lori away and he turns back around and starts a perimeter check. Daryl then looks over.” Let’s set up camp.” He elbows tara and she nods to Daryl and starts to walk over to the area where there was some brick wall left. The group follows..Daryl stops by Emma.. “ Tara is going to go out on watch, get a fire going and try to keep everyone from killing one another... they are almost in shock, and scared. I’m going to go and try to talk to Rick and see if we can come up with some kind of plan. If ya need me or Tara, two high shrill whistles. We will come running.” Daryl then nodded and took off as Tara elbows Emma lightly.” We will teach you a little later on stealth communication. That way you’ll know things as soon as me and Daryl.” Tara looks at the group and kind of smirks.” Good luck.” And then she takes off to start her walk around.
He walks, triple checking everything. He couldn’t be too careful...that and he was restless. They hadn’t found a secure place for so long. He then slows to a stop as Emma approaches. And he shrugs.
"You guys didn’t happen to find any coffee on one of them did you?" She asked sarcastically with a smile.
"There's a pharmacy in town," the old man said. "They should have some antibiotics there, other medications. Keep an eye out for these." He handed the list to Rick. "Remember, no guns."
Emma nodded in partial agreement to Daryl. "The group is broken and it may not make a difference at all, like I told Rick, there are still other people in the group who have a voice. People who don't usually speak up and give their opinions. Taking this assholes life shouldn't be up to just us if we're going to do it. Either way, I guess we will see." She finished her meal shortly after Tara took off and then ran in the tent real quick to grab her duffle bag. She laid the bag on the ground outside and then laid on it. It felt good to lay down outside, listening to the flames crackle. It was peaceful which was nice with the day they had so far.
"If you don't, I'm gonna turn into one of them and then I'm going to try to kill you. I don't want that." She had held the machete close to her after that, waiting. Then the time came.
“Cell block C. Cell 4 that’s mine, gringo,” he said, trying to be as intimidating as he could, but that didn’t work on the twins. They had already seen the worst kind. This ass didn’t even register to them. “Let me in,” he demands.
Emma frowned as he walked off and turned to the now silent group. Rick was in a dark place now that was for sure and it would take some time to get him out of it.
As they began getting everything ready for the camp, Emma pulled Rick aside. "Hey, I'm sorry, but I have to ask. What took you guys so long...and where is Shane?" She had a feeling she already knew the answer, after all it was an obvious set up after they had thought about it during the time they had been gone. Not that she was heartbroken about Shane's disappearance, but she felt bad for Rick for being the one to take him out.
"Hey," she said as she approached. "Penny for your thoughts?" She looked at him. "You should come sit with us. Get some rest. We're safe here."
She zipped the duffle bag closed and slung it over her shoulder. "Speaking of which, we better get back. Telling them to keep pressure on the leg and clean the blood is helpful and will give me more room to work with, but its not going to fix the problem. It's mostly just busy work at this point.”
"Honestly its hard to say. His chances just increased about 80% since we found this though. He has a fighting chance now at least, assuming the trip back is as easy as it was to get here."
“There has to be a reason she didn’t come back," Andrea said, still kind of sore about not having a gun. She shrugged softly as she sat down. “She was most likely bit and she took off." Daryl shoots his eyes over to the woman and growled dangerously.
Emma glanced over as she heard Tara make the threat. She smiled warmly at her in appreciation and kept walking towards the barn. She walked inside finally and stood close to Rick.
Emma walked out with Tara, trying not to laugh at the offer of Rick staying with Daryl. It was funny almost that he thought no one could tell what his feelings for Daryl were. She stopped next to Tara once they were outside. It was a peaceful night. Life on the farm almost seemed like nothing had changed about the world. Aside from the fact they now had a prisoner...and aside from the fact that Shane had released a farm full of walkers.
"Sorry," she said with a smile. "I was pretty down in the grass. Pretty comfy." She dusted herself off. "Are you sure you're up for this?" She asked Tara. "Not really getting over there, but dealing with everyone? You know everyone in the group is going to be hounding you to see if you're okay." She sat down in the chair with her duffle bag next to it and picked it up, setting it down on her lap for a moment. "Do you smoke too?" She asked. "I have extra. I found a few cartons awhile back and snatched them up."
“What, going to try and put me down lil bird?" he grunted out as his eyes locked with Tara, giving her an amused grin. He was hunched over blood slowly rolling down the side of his face and then he heard the sound of gunfire and his world went black as his body crumbled to the unforgiving ground. And Tara stops breathing her eyes widen even more and her lips start to tremble. She then drops by her brother as Tara’s  tears start to roll down her face as she starts frantically checking him over, her hands cup his face and turn his head... just a graze...she then moved and takes off her tank top knowing that her two sports bras would be fine, she didn’t really give a shit. She then moves the fabric to her brother's head and puts pressure, while her other hand cups his cheek. “I got ya big brother." Glenn and T- dog move over to Tara to see what to do...
Emma stood up and hugged him. "Its something none of us should have had to do. I'm sorry for not having the balls to do it myself." She then pulled away and frowned at him. "Do you know what Tara had to go check on?" She asked. She had been gone since before they left the barn. They had all heard Dale's screams and came running. By all logic, Tara should have heard them too and she knew, even though the Dixon's had a hard exterior, she knew they wouldn't stay gone if they thought someone from the group was in trouble...except maybe Shane...or Angela. She looked down at Dale and sighed softly. Tears were echoing through the group. "Someone needs to go get the truck," she said. "And some blankets. Take him back to the house for now or something until tomorrow and then we can bury him. We cant leave him out here like this though." Shane stepped forward. He looked sad like everyone else here was, but he also looked almost like he was ashamed or something. "I'll go get the truck," he said in a shaky voice, before going back towards the camp. Lori stood up. Sometime in all of the commotion, Carl had come out and was crying in her lap. "Wait, Shane. I'll come with you. I need to get Carl back to the house. I'll grab the blankets while I'm inside and run them out to you." Shane nodded as Lori got up. She picked up the boy and carried him, just like a mother should. Emma walked over to Rick. "Maybe you should go with them," she said quietly. "Be with your son. We'll figure out the rest tomorrow morning."
Emma had kind of a bit of a feeling on that. Too many people had turned too quickly. The whole world, save a few people like them had turned too quickly...the world was over run too quickly. It made way more sense as well as to why Rick wanted to shoot Randall instead of hang him. She was sure part of it was that he wanted to do it quickly so the kid wouldn't have to feel pain for long, but turning into a Walker by hanging would have been a pretty big shock to anyone who witnessed.
She looked down at Tara sitting in her chair. "Do you want to come with or will you be good till I get back?" She didn't mind talking to Hershal but she wasn't sure about leaving her alone with Daryl gone. She knew the woman could handle herself, but with her wounds, she wasn't too sure about it. She went ahead and nodded at Rick. "Yeah, we definitely need to figure out what was going on."
Emma grabbed Lori by the wrist and all but dragged Lori to a vehicle close by and made her get in. "Carl will be okay," she said gently. "T-dog?!" She  yelled, spotting him close by. "Get her out of here. A Walker moved slowly towards the truck when it heard her yell. Emma raised her gun and shot it in the head as T-Dog rushed by and climbed in the truck. "Go!" Emma went to help Carol grab the vehicles to bring them close to the house. She got out of the car and yelled to Maggie and Glen to get in the car as well. She swept her eyes surveying the damage. Beth and her mother were off in the distance, getting surrounded. Emma ran over, but it was too late. Her mother was gone. Emma grabbed Beth by the wrist before she could collapse on the ground. "Come on," she said as calmly as she could with all the commotion going on. "We gotta get out of here." She brought her by Hershel who held a rifle steadily in his hands. "Hershel, you and Beth need to go now." Hershel shook his head, shooting down walkers. "This is my farm. I will die here if I have too." Emma grabbed a second gun from her other holster and used both to take down two walkers close by. "No you won't." She replied. "Not tonight. You gotta go. We all need to leave." He knew better than to argue with her. Beth was with him and he wasn't about to let his daughter die standing right next to him. He finally nodded and took off with Beth.
"I'm glad you think so. Too bad I'm sticking around. I don't care if you think I should be the one to stay here with her or not. I made a promise and I'm keeping it." Emma sat up slightly, adjusting her ponytail to make it a little more comfortable against the bed frame. "Besides, Daryl is the one who asked me to watch over her in the first place and while Tara is hurt, his opinion on the subject is the only opinion I give a fuck about." She shrugged. "I understand being wary of me. I am new, but I have nothing to hide. If you want to know something, just ask. I would like to remind you though, that I am only one person. You guys are a group. I should be more intimidated by ya'll as a whole, not the other way around."
"Men," she said, shaking her head. She ran towards another one and stabbed him through the neck as well. They kept cutting through the ones that had made it out until they came to the gate.
Right as two hours have passed since Daryl has gone off into the woods to hunt Tara is now up eating a well cooked rabbit. Her body still hurt, and breathing hurt a little but she would live. Her pa has left her in much worse shape before this, it was sad to say she was used to it. At least she was doing something good, she found the girl. Saved her. The pain in her body didn’t even bother her in comparison to knowing that. Her brother woke her before he took off to hunt and told her to go to some meeting with Emma. She almost told him no but she didn’t want Emma by herself with the group. She was a good person and she did a lot for her. So she told him she would. She then looked around for Emma.
"Thank you," she said in response to Carol. Not only for offering to bring food, but also for getting Andrea out of the room.
"In the barn?" Emma asks, her heart dropping. It explained so much. Why Hershel was so hesitant on letting them stay...why he was so adamant about not allowing guns on his property...
Emma's eyes fluttered open. It wasn't quite dark yet and the sun was just barely going down. Swirls of pink, orange, and blue filled the sky. She raised up from the ground. "Hey, Daryl," she said to the sleeping man. "It's time to go." She touched his arm gently, in case just speaking didn't work for waking him up.
Tara then gave her a true smile, and nodded.” If it’s you, I don’t mind.” She moves up a little on her bike so Emma will have room. And once she was on she and her brother take the lead of the small rag tag group. They just needed to get somewhere far away from the herd so they can take a breath and think.
When Emma and Rick finally made it to the others, she skidded to a stop. Her suspicions were confirmed. It was Daryl. She knelt down beside him. "Is he okay?" She asked Tara.
"Whether you want to lead or not, it's what was given to you. Rick, you have the makings of a good leader or else most of the people here wouldn't be following you." She thought for a moment. "I bet when you came to this group, Shane was more or less the leader and then suddenly, people started looking to you." She stood up and placed a hand on his shoulder. "I know you want to protect Carl, but I can see there's also a part of you that maybe hasn't completely come out yet, that wants to protect everyone else too. It's a lot of pressure. If you need help, I am more than willing...like I said though, these people don't know me. They dont trust me. I don't blame them. I'm happy to help you where I can though, but either way it goes, you are in charge. I'll follow you. I will NOT follow Shane though."
Lori stood up angrily and walked outside the brick fortress that was enclosing him. "You killed him?" She yelled, tears streaming down her face. A loud smack echoed through the air. "I can't believe you would do that. You couldn't kill that kid and he was a danger to us and the baby, but you had to kill the man I loved." Emma walked out and grabbed Lori's arm. "Leave him the fuck alone," she said. "You've put him through enough and you just heard him. Shane tried to kill him first," she said through clenched teeth. "And quit yelling unless you wanna bring another herd at us." She walked Lori back to the group. "Sit the fuck down and let him be. I know you're hurt, but so was Rick."
“Where!?!” His voice drops an octave, but his yell was loud. He moves his knife over to the wound. The guy starts to panic.
Emma, Rick, Daryl, and the rest of the group look for Tara in an attempt to figure out what happened.
Tara has started to get everything together when she hears that bitch screaming about a walker. She dropped her bolts and jogged over to the fence, removing her Bowie knife and then looked up at the blond bitch. "Put your damn gun down! I’ll go take care of it. No need for shooting off more and making more noises!!!" she yelled up at the blonde again and hopped the fence, taking off into the field, her stomach then started to drop.... something was wrong the closer she got, vaguely aware of Glenn and T-dog running not far behind, and she knew Shane was somewhere behind her. But she didn’t give a shit, her heart started to go into overdrive, her panic just about consumed her as she stopped in front of her brother, he looked so broken, dirty and bloody. Her eyes widen and she steps closer to him.... no... no not Daryl, she could lose Merle it would hurt but she would be ok, but not Daryl. She couldn’t, “Holy shit!! Is that Daryl!!” Glenn had yelled as they stopped in front of him, she stood there, knife out her breathing starting to slow down, once he spoke.
"Depending on time," Emma replied, "it probably wouldn't be the worst idea to train people on mundane items too...rocks, hammers, just small things like that would be pretty handy. Definitely guns and knives first though. That's top priority." She thought for a moment. "It probably wouldn't be the worst idea too to train the kids with them as well. Just to be safe. If something else happens, like what happened on the highway...they should know what to do. It's a very different world now. What Lori is doing is fine. Trying to teach them math and stuff, but it doesn't have to be done immediately. I can help teach basic first aid too."
As they moved towards the house, Hershel's daughter Maggie came out and walked towards Glenn across the way. "From them, even if they may not realize it," she gazed and then relaxed her gaze to Rick and Daryl. "To them. It makes no difference to me."
By the time Emma and Hershel had come back out the twins was packed and heading out of the cell block, Daryl in front. T soon follow along with Glenn. Rick moves over and hands Carl the keys and taps his hat.
Emma nodded at Daryl as he went inside the tent. "Thanks," she said. She took a rabbit and began digging into it. The meal she had from the Greens was good last night, but it wasn't what she was used to anymore. This rabbit on the other hand sat on her belly nicely...although she still felt bad for the critter.
“Only one way to keep him alive! Hold him still!” What seems like hours of torture but in reality only 30 seconds pass, fresh blood now pouring from a severed limb and Rick looks like he is in slight shock after what he just did, hacking off a human leg. His eyes still big and panicky.” He’s going to bleed out!” He then looks at Emma. Knowing she was their best hope for Hershel living. But then Daryl looks at his sister and she nods. She whispers a small “ duck” before the twins are on their feet crossbows aim at a new threat. Five men stood behind a metal like gate...
They took down one right after the other in perfect form until they came until the open gate and the walkers with riot gear came out.
Rick didn’t really say anything yet and just listens. Trying to pull everything together so he can make a plan on where to go.
Emma helped everyone else drag the bodies outside of the cells on the lower level. For some reason there weren't quite as many down on the lower level rather than the top level...
Emma stood up. The moment she had been anxiously awaiting...the moment she had to ask Hershel if they could stay. It had to be done. This could mean life or death for the group.
Maggie nodded. "Come in," she said, her voice thick with a southern accent. "Pa has been working on her. She was hurt, but we think she'll be fine." She eyed Daryl. "What's your blood type? She lost quite a bit."
Rick then started off after Emma casually. He would not turn down the offer to go see Daryl, just to make sure he was alright, that was all, at least that’s what he would tell himself. Once they get to the room, he lets Emma go in first. Once the door opens Tara’s head shoots up, and her body tenses up, until she sees Emma, then Rick. She then gets off the bed and walks around looking over the two. Reading their face as she went. She stopped beside Emma as her arms crossed over her chest.
When she reached the highway, there were quite a few living people going through cars. She almost wanted to cry. Aside from Lance, she hadn't seen anyone alive since before the outbreak of monsters. She had thought almost that they must be one of the only ones left alive and that's how they had lived. She stood on the highway, her eyes wide in amazement.
Rick stayed where he was and took a seat on the porch and let Emma take the lead back. It was different having someone helping him get shit together instead of fighting him through everything. It was a nice break from his soon to be ex-wife and Shane. He sat there for a long while waiting for his people to show up or Daryl to come out of the house. Which he did three hours later. Swaying slightly as he took a seat next to Rick. They didn’t say anything for a while. And then Rick looked over. "She okay?" Daryl nodded softly and looked at him and then his eyes went to the floor. "I’ll wait till Emma gets back. She would want to know as well. But she's gonna be okay.”
“Forgive him Emma. My name is Rick Grimes. This is Shane. And the woman who saved you is Tara. Do you need a group to stay with? We don’t have much but you are welcome to stay with us,” he said as he looked over to Tara with a nod and a smile. She just scoffed at him and walked off to go looking through cars that were now tombs.
Emma sat in silence, looking at the prison as the warmth from the fire warmed her cold skin. Well, that and her flannel. She glanced over to Daryl and Tara and smiled. Over the past few months, the two of them had probably gotten the least amount of sleep of just about anyone...except maybe Rick. One or both of them was always going out hunting or scouting or just keeping guard. She doubted even they knew how often they popped off. Occasionally she would go with them on their outings, but a good portion of the time, she would stay with Rick to help keep an eye on things. She knew he still had a world of issues on his mind, but at least he and Daryl had started 'secretly' seeing each other. She smiled as she watched Rick give little side long glances from where he was patrolling the border of the fence. Hershel looked up at the fence.
By the time they are forced to stop due to one of the cars running out of gas they are on a back wood road, maybe three hours away from the farm, a river in the distance as well as an old stone ruin of a house that once stood there further down. The twins stay on their bikes as Rick comes up most of the group getting out to see what was up. “ you out?” Daryl asks as Rick comes up to him.” Yeah, we are going to have to make camp, go on a run in the morning.”
“So what do you guys think about this.” He wanted to see where he was with them. He hadn't got to spend a lot of time with them due to everything going to shit. But he would try.
"What the fuck happened?!" She asked, closing her weapon right through a walkers head. From behind, one of them grabbed her and she spun around, shoving the machete up through the walkers chin and up into the brain. She pulled it out quickly.
Emma looked up when she heard the door open. She thought it was more than likely Tara, but she grabbed her gun from its holster just in case, but kept it slightly lowered that way if it was some sort of danger, she would at least be quick on the draw. As soon as she saw who it was, she quickly put her gun back in its holster. When Daryl asked if Rick was back, Emma shook her head. We haven't seen him or heard from him in hours." She looked towards them and then was filled with sudden panic. "Oh God. He's alone with Shane. This is a set up to keep us distracted. Rick's in trouble if Shane gets the jump on him."
Andrea looked down again at Emma. Right then there was a soft tap on the door. Opening slowly revealed Carol. Her hands covering her mouth as she looked at Tara.
"Stuff and things, huh?" Emma replied with a smile. "That was super specific." She placed a hand on his arm. "You've been through a lot lately. It makes sense that your mind is racing, but you need to get your rest too. Dont stay up here too much longer, okay? Everyone here works hard and you the most out of any of us and I know your mind is always going." She turned to walk away and then paused for a moment. "As far as Daryl goes, just be happy hun. You have someone in your life who makes you happy. Try to run with it as best you can. I didnt come up here to assess you or anything though. I was just worried about you and don't worry about Lori. We've all been making sure her and the kids get the most. We'll save you a plate." Emma left him up by the fence line and then went to sit down by the others again.
Rick doesn’t really say anything, he looks over at Emma as she speaks and then nods turning slowly to make his way back to the house slowly with the others in the group. Daryl then looks over to Emma. When she had asked about Tara, he hadn’t seen her since the barn he looks over slowly to where their camp is.” I don’t know, but I’m sure she is somewhere. “  he then looked back over to Emma and nodded to their camp.” Go start packing up are things, Hershel said that everyone needs to move into the house. Don’t worry about the tents or the bikes, we will get them tomorrow morning. I’m going to help with dale and then I’ll be up to help.”
Tara nodded softly to her and smiled lightly. “Yeah, We will be fine, go ahead and see what’s up,” she then walked over and laid in the bed with her brother, “if ya need me ya come and get me okay?”
Shane then went to where Daryl was bringing out Randall to offer assistance in bringing him to the barn.
Daryl gave a soft nod to Emma as he read the look on her face and followed Shane out, keeping his hand on his Bowie as he followed. Rick takes a deep breath and looks over to Emma. “yeah, get to the camp and tell them what’s going on, me and Carl will be there soon..” he then opens his mouth to call Tara when his eyes look around the spot she was at, she was no longer there, she must have left a few minutes ago. he then walks over to Carl putting his hand in his shoulder, “ we need to talk son. “ and with that they leave the barn quietly.
"Ohh.. I was just checking up on her. Seeing how she was doing." What the hell was the new girl doing with Dixon?
She took out a cigarette as she sat there and offered one to Tara. She flicked the lighter, igniting her cigarette, sucking in lightly as the smoke filled her lungs. She exhaled slowly, as a plume of white smoke escaped from her lips, illuminated in the moonlight.
It was like watching a mirror image as the both thanked her and lit up there cigarettes, inhaling at the same time and the twin look of calm bliss that overcame over them. Taking in the silence for a little long before everything turn into a shit show. Daryl started walking Tara fell into step beside Emma letting Daryl take the lead, taking a slow walk so they could smoke before they got to the others. once they got to where the camp was he saw Rick nod his way and he gave a nod in return. Daryl stop a few feet away hands gripped on the strap of his bow. He then looked over to Rick.” Guys got a gang, 30 guys.... they roll through here are boys are dead, and the woman.” His eyes fall to the side to look at Emma and Tara his words then turned into a growl as he snapped them out.” They going to wish they were. “Tara looks over to the group and then looks away. Her arms crossed over her chest.
Shane watched Rick cautiously as he spoke. He calmed when Rick mentioned Lori and Carl and HIS baby. He lowered the gun slightly. Maybe they could go back to being brothers. As he moved in to give Rick a hug though, that's when the pain began. Darkness began creeping into his sight as he heard Rick screaming at him. It would be the last thing he ever heard. He looked at Rick. What had he done? He asked himself as darkness fully took over until finally there was nothing left. Only a void.
Emma hadn't gotten much sleep that night, before it was already time to wake up and go off into the woods. She hadn't been able to stop thinking about Lance.
Tara looks at the food then back to Emma shaking her head.” Not really that hungry.” She then looked back over the farm lands.” No, nothing. Emma something Doesn’t feel right. There would have been no way he slipped those cuffs by himself.”
Daryl was the first to spot Emma as she walked in, his eyes narrowed in on Shane and gave a low scoff after he spoke. As Emma sat down he gave a soft smile as he took a hold of the antibiotic.” The pain is not bad, I’ll be fine with just these.” Rick looks over then and frowns lightly. “Are you sure? If you're in pain then take them” Daryl gives a cocky huff. “I’m a Dixon, Officer. Our pain tolerance is through the roof. I don’t need them.” He then looks back at Emma with a shy smile. “Thanks though.” Rick sighs softly and then looks at Emma. “So, any ideas on what the hell we should do about the guy?”
Once Tara heard Emma, she took her hand that wasn’t holding her shirt to her brother's head and wiped her face of the few tears that stained her face. She looked up to Emma, her panic and anxiety clouded her eyes. She shook her head as Rick stoops down on the other side, his hands moving over to cup Daryl’s face and moved the shirt up just to see the damage, and then pressed Tara’s hand back to it once he had seen it, his touch lingers as he check him over, looks like he was hit in the side with something, was there others out in the woods!?... he could think about that now, he had to get Daryl to Hershel. “T, help me get him up, we have to get him to Hershel, Glenn! Run ahead and find him, Emma! Get Tara up and moving!” As he was giving out orders T comes over and helps Rick slowly get Daryl up and started going fast but careful not to jolt the injured man around to much. Daryl’s head slowly comes up as they are walking and he speaks in grunts “I was kidding lil bird... damn..” his head then falls in the nook of Rick's neck passing out once again.
"My name is Emma," she said, even though no one asked. Despite this, a foundation of trust had to be built somewhere and sometimes that started with a name. That's what her dad always told her at least.
Once everyone was up and moving about the twins had come back, Daryl moved over to Rick's side to talk to him about a plan as they stood in front of the now dead fire. Tara moves quietly back over to her bag. Removing her poncho and stuffing it into her bag, and then she dropped down to sit and sigh. And then she lays back watching the sky and enjoying the warm morning. Feeling the cool grass on her skin, god how she wanted to wear some shorts... it was to damn hot for pants..but better hot then dead. Rick looked at the group and then back at the gate that held their prize.
“Oh my god.” Tears swell in her eyes as she walks in slowly and lowers herself so she can really see Tara. Her hand moved up slowly running a mother’s tender fingers through Tara’s dirty hair. Carol moves down slowly and whispers a small ‘thank you’ to Tara and then she sits up, just now feeling the tension in the room. She looked to Emma then to Andrea. “What’s going on here?”
"Come on," Emma said, leading with an arm under Tara's. She touched her shoulder with her other hand. "We can deal with her later. Let's go take care of Daryl first. He needs you right now." She smiled a little and watched as Rick and T-dog led Daryl to Hershel's house. "Although, I think he'd be just fine with Rick."
As they put Hershel onto the bed, Emma quickly elevated his leg to try to keep the rest of the blood in him as well as they could. She removed her flannel from his leg and tossed it to the floor. And grabbed her duffle bag. She was covered in blood now from trying to keep pressure on his leg. She was glad that she didn’t get queasy at the sight of blood.
Emma sat down on the ground listening to the conversation, taking mental notes on everything the kid said. For the most part, it sounded like a group like them, just a little more violence involved. As he began telling his story about the teenage girls though, she felt her stomach drop. Especially when he called them real cute and then later paused before saying that he never touched those girls. With barely a thought she stood up. She wanted to go in there and punch this assholes' lights out, but it sounded like the Dixon's were taking care of it. Right before she opened the door though, Tara came out and apologized. She could tell Tara had taken what the kid said to heart and she could tell a good bit of the beatings that followed came from her. Without saying anything for a moment, she hugged her. "What the hell are you apologizing to me for?" She asked. "He deserves whatever he got and more."
As soon as they make it back Rick yells for them to open the door. Carl opens it up fast and joins them as they get Hershel into a cell. Rick helps get him on the bed and stands back and lets Emma and Carol take over. Daryl comes back over from locking the cell door to the block and throws the keys on the table. T moves around and out of sight, the twins get into the same position, bows up and trained on the open door with one leg standing on the metal seat. Their hearts racing, sweat pouring. Tara lets out a slow breath and her game face is back on. They was a threat to her people, she wouldn’t think twice about putting an arrow straight through their skull. Soon they all start coming in and Daryl growls out a warning.
"It's not going to help a lot. It's only meant for small wounds, but it should help with some of the pain."
“You’re... what…?” He knew that at this moment he was going to be a dad even though there was a 50 percent chance that the baby was not his. It still made his lips twitch into a smile, it was a baby after all. Then it clicked.
Rick watched Emma as she spoke. He then nodded and let out a soft sigh. “You’re right.” He looked back over his shoulder and looked at T and Glenn. “Take him to the shed and lock him up. I want at least one person on guard. We will all get together in the morning and make a decision. Right now, everyone needs to get some sleep.”
"See that?!" She exclaimed excitedly. Glenn and T-Dog looked at her, highly impressed and began doing the same with their weapons. Emma laughed slightly.
The others stay close to Rick and Glenn as Tara and Daryl stay behind slightly to watch the walkers as they find a chained door. T busted the locks and Rick, Glenn, and the others get into the room. Everyone moves in a frenzy, T and Daryl holding the door closed as Tara is on the other side of Hershel with Emma, Maggie held her father close while Glenn hovered beside Maggie. Once the door is secure, Daryl rushes over to help where needed. And Rick starts taking off his belt.
"That's what my husband called them and that's how I refer to them," she replied a little defensively. She hadn't meant too and she wasn't really sure why she did. What did it matter what they called them versus what she did? "That's what they are. They're not human anymore." Her voice cracked slightly, remembering Lance again, but she waved it off.
"I think okay pretty much sums it up, but he'll be good. He's just stressed out. It's been a lot lately which I'm sure we can all attest too. I think this place right here is just seeming a little too good to be true for him right now though." Hershel nodded in response and then began talking to Beth. He was asking her to sing a song, to which she responded that she couldn't sing it, because it reminded her too much of her mom. Hershel attempted another one and she finally agreed. Her voice filled the silence of the night. Emma brought her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them as she listened. Soon, Maggie joined in, creating a perfect harmony with her sister.
When Rick came upon the others and saw Dale his eyes widened, yelling for Herschel, he kneels down by Emma and looks dale over, he sees the damage that has been done, and he knew there was no coming back from this. But his mind still thought he could, yelling to Glenn to get the medical supplies. Now seeing Herschel he stands back up fast yelling for him to help Dale, but once the older man got a good look and looked at Rick he knew... he knew that nothing could be done. Screaming out before he moved away alittle packing. Daryl stayed back, his head bowed slightly but cutting his eyes over to the group every once and a while his face a neutral mask of no emotion.
Rick looked at Emma and nodded helping Emma with what she needed. Glenn takes off looking for something with wheels. Tara takes a few steps to keep Glenn in her view, her bow still pointing at the prisoners. Daryl moves as well moving to stand behind Rick keeping the prisoners eyes on him and his sister. Glenn finds a wheel cart and as he rolls it out, Daryl takes a few steps forward.
Emma sat quietly while the group listened to the plan. It wasn't long before the group was preparing themselves. Stealth weapons definitely made the most sense. A few months ago, Emma had found a pair of sai's and those are what she used most of the time now. She flipped them fluidly in her hands, enjoying the feeling of them cutting through the  air. She then put her gun in her holster. After she was sure she had everything she needed to bring with her, Emma headed towards the gate.
"No one else has shown up yet," she said with a frown. She then went through the list again that she had previously with Tara, informing him of who she knew should have gotten away and which ones she wasn't sure on and of Patricia's death as well. As she spoke though, a small convoy of vehicles began approaching. Lori was the first one out of the car and she ran as fast as she could towards Carl, picking him up and crying. "Oh my God," she was saying over and over again.
Daryl, Rick and the others took off after Emma. The others falling slightly behind except for Rick and Daryl. Daryl stood a little behind Emma as she talked to the woman behind the door. He could care less about them, but they had helped Tara so he tried to reel back his anger. And when she said something about her needing blood he had enough. He moved past Emma and up to Maggie, trying to be as nice as he could.
Tara nods to Emma and right before she goes inside Tara looks at her.” If ya need my help yell, I’ll be there. “ Tara then takes out a cigarette with a smile. She puts it to her lips and then as she lights it she pulls the smoke in stuffing the lighter in the pack and putting it inside her black leather vest pocket. She starts walking around going from one side to the other. She then hears footsteps, she brings her bow up fast and aims. Her eyes then see who it is, she lowers the bow and walks over to them as they come up the porch.” Fine him? “ she asked to move the bow behind her so it fit loose on her back. And he shakes his head” ya, but something ain’t right.” He then moves over to Tara, his hand gripping her shoulder..” he was turned, but the thing was he wasn’t bit. Someone broke his neck.” Daryl said giving her a knowing look and she nodded.” Shane...” Daryl nodded to as Daryl walked into the house first followed by glen and Tara.” Rick ain’t back yet?” He asked now he was feeling a little scared, they should have been back.
"Then you should have sat you ass down instead of jumping the gun," Emma replied. She went over to Tara. "Are you okay?" She asked looking her over, hoping none of her injuries became worse during the fight. She had done a lot of healing over the past couple days, but hopefully Shane's dumbass didn't undo it.
Daryl looked over to Rick and then back to Emma and nodded to her and then walked off to where their bikes are sitting his cross bow down as Rick turned to Emma and nodded as well. “I’ll go too. More eyes the better. Besides, we are not going anywhere any time soon, Dales RV blew a hose, plus the route to Fort Bennett is closed off. There is no way to get through and we don’t have the gas to go back." He gave a frustrated sigh and clapped Emma on her shoulder with a nod. “Thank you Emma, for bringing Sophia back. I know I can’t thank you enough for saving her.”
After Tara rescues Sophia, she leads the walkers away from the little girl. After obtaining an injury though, she disappears.
“Bro..brother ... highway.. c...can’t-” and then she drops. Her bolt and knife laying at her side. The larger man looks around for only a few seconds before his training kicked in.
“Then let’s get going and get it over with.” It didn’t take him long to arm himself with his  weapons and then he turned, grabbing his bow, waiting for Emma to get everything she may need, and then they made their way to the farm house, where some people were milling outside the doors or already inside. Tara was sitting on the porch rails, her crossbow propped up beside her. She had gotten here a few minutes earlier, and she refused to speak to anyone other than Rick or the Greens. Until she had seen her twin and Emma walking up. Her lips pulled into a slight smirk. “You look like shit big brother.” He looks at her as he steps onto the porch, as he scoffs out his come back.
She made her way into the house and found Hershel sitting at the kitchen table. She sat down in the chair across from him.
“Stay hidden, and don’t move till I or Daryl give one high whistle. Then come-” she didn’t get to finish her words cut off as a child’s scream pierced the air. Her eyes widened and then she moved to grab her bow and then out from under the truck. Her eyes taking in what was happening as a little girl took off into the woods, walkers right behind her. Then Rick was gone. Damn it, they didn’t know the woods like the twins did. And she didn’t see her brother so something must have happened to T-Dog to not be able to move. She didn’t think and then took off at her fastest speed, jumping the rails and sliding down into the bank and then put on a burst of speed before she was claimed by the woods as well. The other members of the group soon got up. Daryl helped a bloody T-Dog to stand looking around to see what the hell just happened.
“Losing ya touch big brother?” She then looked at all the dead on the ground. Glenn started at the fence where everyone was waiting until Rick stopped him.
“I ain’t wearing this shit,” Tara said, her voice deep with disgust. T then picks up a glove and the same thing happens.
“Go Back! Go back!” Daryl follows walking backwards as well keeping the threat always in front of him. They dare not take on that many with unknown numbers behind the small herd. The panic increases as Tara yells out quietly about being blocked off from where they came. Sending the others down another corridor, the group stays within touching distance of each other. Daryl, Rick, Emma, T, and Hershel. But at the last minute, Glenn, Maggie and Tara, are forced to go the other way being cut off from the others. Tara grabs both Glenn and Maggie roughly and jerks them back into a cell with a metal door and slams it shut once Glenn and Maggie are inside. Their breathing was extremely loud, as Tara pushes Glenn and Maggie behind her and aims at the door as it starts rattling. God she was scared, it took all of her control not to start shaking, but her aim never wavered. She would keep them safe.
"I figured a soft bed would be a welcome change," she said with a smile. She nodded at Daryl, telling him she would stay with Tara while he did so. She frowned slightly at Tara though. "You would probably heal a little better in here and probably shouldn't move too much yet, but if that's what you want, I can help you get there." She gave Tara a bit of a once over and really took note of her hair.
Rick listened to Emma and nodded. She had good points, very good points. He was conflicted as well. He knew this was the new world and everything ran different now. He then sighs and looks over to Emma as she asks her question about him and Lori. He then shook his head with a small smile.
“Keep watch,” she nods to the cell with Hershel. Carl nods as he takes the keys swiping at Tara’s hand but it was too late to stop her from pushing his hat down. Tara then turns and starts to the main door out side, to see where her brother was and to help out if needed.
As she walked out, she heard one of their newfound 'friends' asking about what was going on back there.
"No, Rick. You don't understand. They are sick. They are our friends and they need our help." Emma looked at Hershel disbelievingly. "Rick is right. There is nothing you can do for them, but put them down. They are hungry, mindless creatures and if they get out, they WILL kill. Possibly everyone. Maybe no one." She took his hand pleadingly. "Please Hershel. We don't want to hurt anyone. We just want to protect the living...the ones who really need help."
What a damn shit show this was, but all her anxiety drained from her body as she felt the winds caress her dirty tanned skin. The roar of the twin motorcycles singing in tune with one another. Her eyes shift over to her fellow bike rider. Green eyes met, green eyes. Her other half, and the only other man she had any inklings of love and loyalty towards (well, except for Merle, but even then, this was a different type of bond). Daryl. Her elder twin of 5 minutes, oh and don’t think he didn’t like to rub that in. In that one look it seemed that they didn’t even need words. Having perfected the art of not making a sound when Pa was home and drunk. But knowing how Dixon-tough she was, he seemed to always want to protect her, even though she would stomp anyone’s ass that messed with her. ‘ Screw that’  their first stop got overrun with walkers. They had lost some people, Amy and Jim. And Merle.
Dale was walking outside in the field, trying to get as far away from the farm as he reasonably could. He wanted to be as far away from the sound of the gun shot when it went off as he could possibly go. He held his gun tightly in his hand. As he moved forward, he thought he heard a weakened "moo." As he approached, he saw one of Hershel's cows on the ground, its guts had been ripped out of its belly. The cow raised his head at Dale weakly. He turned around to go back to the barn, but as soon as he turned around, a Walker sprung at him. Dale crashed to the ground with a loud yell and attempted holding the Walker away from him as he screamed for help. The walker's force was too strong though. Dale screamed loudly in pain as the Walker dug his nails deeply into his stomach. Blood and organs began spilling out as he dug deeper and deeper into Dale.
Tara has seen the whole thing her fist gripped tightly on her crossbow and was able to catch up to Shane, she walked by his side.. she never looked at him but her threat was very real.”  You put your hands on her like that again, I’m going to cut those hands off and shove them right up your ass.” Her eyes then shoot up to him, he was taller than her but she had speed on her side, couldn’t really say the same about office Ass hole.thats how it always started and she would be damn if she wasn’t going to say something or just go straight to throwing hands. Daryl was now bringing the guy out of the shed, walking him up to the barn where Rick had disappeared to slowing down once he heard Emma close by.
A few hours after dinner was Brought to them is when Daryl had shown up again slowly slipping into the dark room. He sat his bow down by the bed and then sat close to Tara taking one of her hands in his. He then looks over to Emma giving her a grateful smile before his eyes dart away. "Sorry I was gone for so long. I didn’t mean to keep you inside all day with her. But thank you for doing it," he said softly.” I set up our tent. You can’t miss it. It’s by mine and Tara’s bike. I have checked everything out. You are welcome to sleep there. Only if you want too.” He said, giving a shrug.
Tara was already eating, as she looked into the hot popping flames, she could feel the heat from where she sat,  her mind going through everything that had happened. her stare unwavering. She was now lost within her own mind. She bit down on the side of her thumb. She stayed quiet as she looked out at the woods. She then sets down her plate on the stump and stretches out almost like a cat would. Her plate is still over half way full as she sighs once again. “ get some sleep Em. Tomorrow is going to be a shit show for sure.” Tara then turned and patted Emma’s shoulder and then turn to pass out in her tent.
Rick crosses his arms over his chest and nods and starts to leave. "Alright then. Let’s meet up in the morning and go over the plan and get everyone started. “And with that Rick starts back to camp Daryl then looks over to Emma and sighs.” I'm going to get a few hours before I head out. There’s rabbit if ya want some."  He then stood and then went into their tent taking off his vest and laying down by Tara. Only close enough so their arms brushed lightly and he then drops off into sleep for a quick nap.
The sun was beginning to set by the time Emma and the small convoy of vehicles came back to the house. Daryl was sitting on the porch along with Rick. She hopped out of the vehicle that she was riding in with Glen before it came to a complete stop. She ran onto the porch. "Is she okay?" She asked, pulling out a Gatorade for the pale looking Daryl and handing it to him "orange juice would be better, but this should help." The others slowly came out of the cars and piled themselves onto the porch. Maggie came out as well to join them, noting the subtle look that Glen gave to her as she walked outside. Hershal slowly made his way outside as well. "She'll need some antibiotics," the old man said, "but she will be just fine."
Tara took the cigarette and look to Emma with a smile, putting the butt past her lips and pulls in a draw of air to pull the sweet rush of nicotine into her lungs and let the short head rush consume her for just a few seconds, once Emma had spoken she looks at her and then busted out in a deep true laughter. Smoke mixing with her laugh. “hell ya we will. Can’t be a Dixon with no bike! “ she then bent over still laughing like mad.
“Here,” she says softly keeping the bag open so Emma could stuff whatever she could find in it. Tara then looks over at Emma. “Do you really think he’s going to make it?”
Emma looked back at Tara and then grabbed her duffle bag. She nodded at her and then made her way out of the house. "He shouldn't have to do this on his own." After a moment, Shane ran outside after them. "Hey Emma," he called.
Tara sat outside on the porch, the night hanging over them. She was the only one allowed outside right now, what a damn shit show this was. Dale had died, she then rubbed her face hard as she stood up with her bow, to lean against the railing to look over at the farm, then the shit with Randall. Something didn’t add up. And she had a feeling someone wasn’t going to be coming back. She then pushed off the rail and started to pace watching everything, the darkness of the night covered the land making it harder to see. But her ears could pick up what her eyes couldn’t. Her brother and glen had taken off one way, before Rick headed out he had put Emma in charge of getting everyone to the house and keeping them safe, Tara was to stay posted outside to keep an eye out Incase Randall showed back up. Something was wrong, she didn’t know what it was or why she felt it but she felt truly uneasy. Her eyes checked her bow to make she the bolt was ready, her knife and backup piece on her person..” this is going to be a long night” she muddled to herself. Hearing the chatter inside the house.
“Then I’m not going to stop you but you take Tara with you. I don’t want you to hurt yourself even more. And Emma is to stand guard. If something goes wrong she can act how she sees fit.” Daryl looked back to Emma then over to Tara and he nodded. “That’s fine,” he then scoffed a small laugh. “You think I’m scary...” and he left it at that as he started off to get his twin at a slow pace. Rick then looks at Emma and nods.
“My older brother Daryl. He doesn’t really talk much. And we try to keep distance from the group." She then moved her arms to her side and then pushed off the car. “ if you need me, come find me. If you stay around me and Daryl where the others can see us, you're going to get pushed out of the group." She wasn’t too sure what was going on in her head. She had never taken to anyone as quick as Emma.
"She can't handle much more of this moving around," Hershel said, putting a hand on Rick's shoulder. Rick and Lori had barely spoken since the night that she learned of Rick killing Shane. She had attempted to speak with him several times since, mostly about the baby or just trying to talk with him, but things were very different between them now. The whole group had noticed, but they definitely weren't going to say anything.
Finally they find a prison that looks like it may be a safe place for Lori to have the baby, but first they need to clear the place out.
"Rick." Lori paused, trying to find the courage to tell him what needed to be said. After she found out Rick was alive, they had been fully together again, almost like when they were newly weds, but after he found out about Shane, everything had changed. Even so, she had to tell him that she was pregnant. She still cared about Shane, but she hadn't slept with him since she found out Rick was alive. She wanted to, but it just felt wrong with him right in the camp. Her and Shane had discussed running off together many times, but hadn't quite found the right opportunity. Her big issue was, she didn't want to leave Carl. She didn't want to take him away from Rick either. Shane had been a good stand in while Rick was gone, but he was too young. He wouldnt understand why all of a sudden they were leaving without his daddy. Wouldn’t understand why Lori and Rick didn't want to be together anymore. Now everything would change. How could she tell either of these men that she was pregnant, but she wasn't sure which of them was the father? Especially since she had slept with them both around the same time. "Rick," she finally said again. "I'm pregnant."
Sophia gave a small sniffle and ran over to Emma as fast as she could her arms wrapping around Emma’s waist
"They're not sick, they're dead. You can't fix them!" She could feel her voice growing louder. "You have a ticking time bomb on your land!"
“Go ahead and try to find the infirmary. Take Tara with you, me, Daryl, and T can handle the prisoners. You go get what Hershel needs, be careful and watch each other’s backs.” He then moves brushing his arm into hers as he steps up to make sure the prisoners eye stay on Rick so Emma can go unnoticed. Tara had not moved but she heard little parts from Rick and Emma. Her foot comes off the metal seat as she moves back, the bow coming down as she walks over to Emma, rising her brow wounding why she was needed. The prisoners watched everything happening, then started to talk with Rick, Daryl, and T about what was happening on the outside.
“What the hell she thinkin’" he grumbled in a Georgia slur before he takes off like an arrow to the woods and disappears within them. Carol was breaking down at the rail, Andrea holding onto her shoulder in comfort.
Daryl nodded with Emma and then looked back where Tara was sleeping. “Look I ain’t great and people me and Tara stay away from groups. I’ll start hunting in the morning and get everything I can. See if the old man has a smoker or see if we can build one. “ Rick gave a nod and the n stood up. “ good idea. I am going to see if I can get someone to go through everything and see what we have, keep a list so we don’t waste and have a system. And start training people with guns and knives.”
Emma frowned at Daryl. "Whether you've done it before or not, you could end up straining yourself and busting something open again." She smiled slightly. "Maggie and I worked really hard getting you patched up last night." She glanced over to Rick. She had a feeling trying to persuade him wouldn't work. The Dixon line was stubborn, that much she had learned. As they spoke, Lori walked over, her hands resting in her back pockets awkwardly. "Rick, can you get a move on, on this. I need to talk to you about something."
She looked into Emma’s eyes as she told her everything going on. Daryl had moved off the bed once she calmed down and started to arm himself with weapons again. He looks over to Emma and Tara and stops at the door, looking at Emma. "I’ll get the tent ready," he said and then was out the door. Tara now laid back down moving her hand over her sore chest.  "I’m fine.” She tells Emma and gives a deep breath, “I want to go to my tent, the bed's too damn soft.” She said with a smile, getting herself up, this time a little slower.
The twins looked over at Emma as she had come out. Daryl let out a small puff that sounded like a raspberry and then rolled his eyes with a smirk. Tara ran her hand through her growing hair, it was now brushing her shoulder, and still looked as she did when she had woken up. None of them had seen a working shower in a very long time, so lakes and small ponds had to do. Tara then smirked at Emma as well.
Rick is going around and warning the others until he gets under a car. Tara takes her bow and drops it and kicks it lightly under the old beat up Chevy and then pushes Emma down and under it and then removes the large Bowie knife and drops down and rolls under the truck. Her back pressed hard against Emma’s. As the first one slowly starts walking by, Tara slowly raises her knife still in fight mode. The sweat slowly dropped down her face as she stayed completely still. Another practiced art. Her breathing is slow and calm. The smell she had finally gotten used to. Her heart beat started to raise, fuck, she was scared, but she kept her calm and waited for this sick nightmare to end.
She dug out one of her own shirts and put pressure against the wound. With a cut as deep as this, she knew it wouldn't stop the bleeding, but it would help a little. She removed a water bottle from the bag and poured it over the wound and wiped away some of the blood. When she was satisfied, she poured antiseptic over the wound to clean it out. Afterwards, she took out some numbing cream.
"Do you wanna get cleaned up first before going out? You took quite the tumble out there it seems. I think most of the forest came back with you," she smiled. They were all a mess, but with the scrape Tara got in she definitely had more dirt on her. No sooner than she had said it, the old man Hershel came into the room.
Emma eyed Daryl and Rick and perked up her eyebrow at them both as they went off together. "Its cute that they think that we don't know," she said quietly to Tara.
Tara thought about it for a minute and gauged her body. She then shook her head slightly. “I’ll be fine, Daryl should be back soon. He’s going to need help with the kills. You and Rick try to buy us some more time to stock up. Just be careful, not just walkers we have to look out for." She clasps Emma's shoulder softly again and walks by Rick, her arm brushing his lightly. She had seen the looks officer friendly was giving her brother. She had been watching it for a while now. But for now he is part of the small group that she actually trusted. She then turns and starts back to their small camp, away from the others.
Emma nodded at Rick. She knew there was a leader in him, even though recently he had seemed a little quieter about it. She was glad to see that leader would come out if it were someone he truly, deeply cared about. She suspected with Daryl, it really applied. She stood up as T-Dog assisted Rick with Daryl.  "Come on," she said gently to Tara, putting out a hand to her. "What the hell happened? We heard gunshots. I thought it might be him."
"He's still alive," Emma told them. "Rick couldn't do it. Carl showed up and told him to do it. Rick's got him right now and the others are making sure Randall gets back in the shed okay." Lori breathed a small sigh. "When did he get out of the house?" She asked, tears welling up in her eyes. Emma shrugged. Carl was usually out wandering around the farm anyway.
"I think we're going to be completely blocked," Maggie started with a sigh. Emma looked over to Lori who was sitting patiently in the truck. She had grown quite large in the past few months and was likely to burst at any moment. Hershel had been teaching both Emma and Carol on how to help Lori through the child birth, since Emma had some medical experience before coming to the group.
Tara nodded to her in understanding. She moved a little to grab her Bowie knife, she unsheathed it and looked it over. Looks like her brother cleaned it up. She put the blade back and then sat back the knife now sitting in her lap. "I know Rick is good people but I do think he is naïve, and has a bleeding heart. But all the others, besides Carol and the kids. They are just dicks. Shane though, he’s going to become dangerous." She sighs then and closes her eyes. Just walking out here felt like it had drained what energy she had. “But you won’t wear out your welcome, you have done more for me and my brother than the group has and you haven’t even been here that long. Whatever you need, me and Daryl got you.
Emma nodded at Daryl in understanding. "If you guys need any help, you know where I'll be." Emma walked slowly towards the camp, her gun in hand and on alert, just in case there were anymore walkers nearby. Even though she was walking slower than normal, it still didn't take very long to finally reach the campsite. Emma got hers, Daryl's, and Tara's things. There wasn't a whole lot between the three of them, but it would still take about two trips to get everything, except for the tents and bikes. Emma took Tara and Daryl's things to the house first and then went back for her own.
As Tara fell asleep, Emma took the bottle from her and placed it on the ground. "Well that was fast," she whispered with a smile. She scooted down the seat slightly, closing her eyes. She didn't fall asleep, but it was so peaceful and relaxing out here on Hershel's farm, way off into the distance where no one would really come bother them. She wondered if Rick had asked Hershel if they could stay here for a few days or if he wanted Emma to do it, since she slightly knew him. As good of a guy she knew Hershel was, she wasn't sure if he would be comfortable with letting a bunch of strangers stay on his land, even if it was only for a few days. Like she had told Tara before, with how desperate humans were, it would be no surprise to her if he was cautious over him. All the same, it was nice to be in this familiar place. Close enough to her old house, but far enough away to where she couldn't see it and to where she wouldn't be haunted by the memories of her husband. She felt something wet trickle around her face and realized that she shouldn't have even thought about him. She opened her eyes and wiped the tear from her face and just sat there for a moment, listening to some birds whistling to the morning.
Tara looked over before he could look away. Her eyes narrowed and her lips dropped into a frown as she sat back in the chair, her body and muscles now tense and on guard. She didn’t scare her one damn bit. But right now she was just tired and her filter was off line. "Why don’t you go jump into a pit of walkers, and fuck off." Rick kind of stood there looking to Emma, then to Shane then to Tara. Rick slowly puts his hand on Carl’s shoulder and then sits down with his plate. Shane should have known better. If Tara and Emma ripped him a new ass then he would sit back and watch it happen. Shane was no brother of his, not anymore.
She walked through the woods on her own until she got close to the highway. For a moment, she thought she heard something, but was quickly distracted by the sound of footsteps and growling behind her.
"I guess at least till Tara gets better. I don't want any guns on my property though," he said, his tone and his expression serious.
“What happened out there?! How did you find Sophia? I swear I thought Tara would have been with her!" Daryl just kept looking at the woods, eyes tight as if he could try and see his sister. He had taken to pacing, his nerves and anxiety in overdrive. It was too soon, he couldn’t lose her. It hurt when Merle took off but he could not lose his twin. But he knew she was a Dixon, and she knew the woods as well as he did. Going out after dark would cause someone to get killed. And he sighed.” If Tara isn’t back by morning. I’m going after her. Can’t do nothing in the dark.”
She laid down on the bed and closed her eyes. She knew she wouldn't sleep, she didn't need to. "Sorry I couldn't come find you sooner," she said. "I would have, but I couldn't leave Sophia out there."
"Hershel..." she said as calmly as she could, but she could feel her voice shaking, trying to hold back her emotions. "Why do you have those monsters in the barn?"
"My names Emma," she said once again, now directed towards these two. She nodded her head at Tara. "She saved me," she said. "One of those monsters was about to get the better of me."
Emma felt strangely nervous all of a sudden as the two men approached them. The man in the sheriff's uniform and hat wasn't the one making her nervous though. Something about the other male did though. She didn't know what it was, but something seemed a little off about him.
Daryl nodded to her and looked back at the tent. He had put Tara to bed and then looked back at the fire.” Nah, I won’t shoot him, but Tara is still down. We will just tell her later if there was a need to." He then smiles at Emma. "Good, that gives me time to hunt, get as much as I can and maybe start smoking it? The furs would be good come winter.” And then not 20 minutes later Rick is walking up the long stretch of land to the Dixon camp. His hands up and out clearing his throat to make his presence known. "Don't shoot” he tried to give a smile but he was kindof scared that Daryl would shoot him.
“ shit! '' Daryl cuss as he turns to leave the house, Tara hot on his hills. But then he comes to a stop on the side of the porch, his eyes widen as he took in the scene... Tara has stopped beside him, her eyes wide as well. She mirrored her words from early. Only this time it was laced with alittle fear.” Gonna be a long night.” She whispers, she can hear it now the groans and hissing of the dead. It was a Herd, and the darkness made them even more dangerous. Tara right her grip on her crossbow and then had it at the ready for as soon as she needed it. Daryl wanted to go after Rick but knew he wouldn’t be able to. They were going to need all the help they could get, if they were going to all get out alive.
The leader then pulls his gun from the front of his pants and brings it up. “Whoa, whoa!! Easy no need for anyone to get hurt.” Daryl says in an even tone. The gun points to T then over to Tara then before finally landing on Daryl.
By the time Emma got to Daryl he had just got done speaking to Tara. She knows what has to be done, she hates doing it but when it came to things of this nature, the twins were scary good at getting information. She just wished Emma didn’t have to see something like that. A peek at a monster she keeps hidden under lock and key. But she knew Emma could take it, Tara just didn’t want her to be afraid of her after words. Daryl then turned to Emma.
T-dog helps roll out the map as the group gathers around. T-dog and Glenn standing on one side, Hershel and Maggie in front , and Tara and Daryl on the other side. Rick putting Beth and Carl And Sophia on watch. They had all learned to use weapons and the kids had grown up very fast. Once Rick and Emma join them.
Emma opened her eyes as Daryl left to go hunt and Tara stepped out of the tent. It appeared that it was about that time to go meet the others. Emma stood up.
"Take Maggie with you when you go. She's had to go there before to get stuff and she knows what to get."
They followed Rick and Daryl until they saw the prison below. She surveyed the scene below her. There were a good bit of walkers down there, but nothing they couldn't take care of if they were smart about it.
"He's not the person you knew before," Emma replied. "Just remember that. I'd hate to see something happen to you." She nodded in agreement. She would tell the Dixon's to try to stay away from Shane. She had a feeling in the pit of her stomach that something bad was about to happen and maybe that's why she was a little more emotional than normal, but at the same time, a lot had happened over the past few days...hell over the past few weeks. "Just get everyone else together and I'll tell Tara and Daryl."
“Maybe you should keep Shane company from now on. I’m going to go check on Hershel and try to do some begging, but you two need to leave now!”
Rick listened to Emma as she gave out ideas. They was all there. He felt bad for the kid, he seemed innocent but there was something off about the kid. Rick ran a hand through his hair and looked out to the group, still only talking low to Emma and Daryl.
Emma watched the guy who was bound and frowned slightly. Although she couldn't see his face, by his body type she could see that he was pretty young. Probably a teenager or very early twenties. He was a kid. She shook her head. She could tell a tough decision would have to be made soon.
The whole room went silent at the sound of Carl's voice. All except Randall. Shane looked at Rick and then went to Carl. "Hey what did I tell you, man." He said as he turned Carl from the barn. When Rick said to take him back, Shane looked at Rick disbelievingly, but brought Carl inside and grabbed Randall to take him out. Emma looked to Daryl, hoping he could read her. Ask him to go with Shane, just to make sure he obeyed Rick's orders. She was almost relieved. Emma squeezed Rick's shoulder gently. "It's okay," she said. It had to be an awful feeling, your child telling you to kill someone in cold blood. "Do you need us to leave?" She asked. "To speak with Carl."
"We need to get him back asap," she said, before looking up and seeing the living prisoners across the way. She sat there for a moment her mouth agape. "We can't worry about them right now, Rick." She looked at him pleadingly. She didn’t want to say his only shot would be to get him back to the others, but it was true. What little medical supplies she had left were in her bag which was back in Lori's cell.
Daryl nodded as well “Shane’s a dick. And next time he comes at mine I'm going to put an arrow in his ass.” He then pointed at Rick with a pissed off look. "Keep your friend on a leash office friendly. Rick swallowed slowly and nodded with a sigh. “I just want to keep my son safe, I didn’t really want to lead at all.  But I think if it’s us we can do it.”
“Scouting!!!  Planning on staying local!!” As he speaks Daryl’s knife digs deep into his wound. The guy shakes his head and yells out.
"Feeling alright, little Dixon?" Shane asked Tara. Emma glared at him and he looked away, taking a seat by the fire.
"Absolutely none of your business." She had a blood covered hand down by her side, close enough to grab one of her weapons if she needed too. She walked over to Rick and put her head close to his so the prisoners wouldn't hear.
The other group found themselves able to hide, finding out they had lost some people as they all hunched together. Hershel tells them that they had to go back and Daryl nodded.
"Emma," she replied. "And I'm not a medic. I just had a lot of practice growing up when my dad would come home from getting into bar fights. I went to school for it, but then all...this happened before I could finish."
Emma began cracking up too. "I'll have to get my last name changed legally too," she said through her laughter. "I could marry Daryl, but I dont think Rick would like that too much," she said halfway in a whisper. "God, someone is gonna think we're smoking something stronger than cigarettes."
Daryl nodded to Emma and started to eat Tara’s food. Once he was done with it he sat it on the bedside table and nodded to Emma. "Then I’m going to get some sleep in while I can. Thank you again Emma." He then stood up and started to remove his weapons. Leaving then by his bow. He walked over to where Emma was laying early and lay down. Daryl’s arm brushing against Tara’s as he moved to get comfortable. And once he did that early was out like a light his arm still pressed up against Tara’s arm.
"It's late." She said simply. "Nothing has to be decided tonight. We can keep him in the barn for now. Try to figure out what to do with him tomorrow. Maybe try to discuss it with the group." She knew where the decision would lie, especially with Shane and Angela, maybe even Lori, but a decision didn't have to be made right now. Everyone had the right to know what had happened at least.
Rick walked with her and stayed by Emma nodding. Ricks eyes widened as he said it and he nodded quickly.
"It's okay, sweetie," Emma said gently walking towards her. "I know you do." Emma looked around to make sure they were in no immediate danger before she spoke again. "I'm Emma," she said, keeping her voice low. "Where is Tara?" She asked, walking closer to the girl and kneeling down with her machete still clutched in one hand and remaining on guard, while still attempting to comfort the girl. She had a feeling that Tara wouldn't have left the child unless it was absolutely necessary. She held out her hand to the girl. She didn't hear anything in the woods right now and she didn't want to leave Tara on her own if she was in trouble, but the girl would never find her way back on her own. "Come on," she said. "I'll take you back to your momma." If anything, she would come back to this spot and continue looking for Tara from here.
Daryl and Rick looked at one another and then at Emma and gave her a nod. They didn’t need words anymore. The four of them could speak to each other with looks alone. Soon they got up, once the walkers had passed and started down the way they had come, Hershel calling out for each of his missing children, Tara being included, but it just stays quiet.
Glenn and Maggie led the others into the cell block. Lori looked around in amazement, seemingly thrilled to be somewhere where she could have the baby.
Daryl kept at it, soon he got a little more personal, removing his large Bowie knife and jumped at the guy, his knife sticking into the wood between the guys legs and then Daryl shot his head up fire and darkness in his eyes as he yelled.
"Hun, I think if the baby was dead inside of you right now, with it being a few days, that would have already happened, but I promise if something like that does, we'll take care of it. Don’t stress yourself out before its time too, okay." Lori nodded. "Okay." Emma and Hershel sat with her a few more minutes and then they both got up and went back to the others.
“Something wrong? You took your time getting back officer friendly.” She then moves her eyes over to Rick and his gaze never moves from Daryl’s sleeping form. Tara watches for a few more seconds as Rick opens his mouth to speak, Taras lips pull into a knowing smirk. “Nevermind, I’m too tired for that shit right now, me and Emma are burned out and I can’t sleep unless one of you are around. We are going to go get some rest.. I’m trusting you to look over my brother. For now at least.” She then turns and walks out of the room without saying anything else. Daryl would kill her when he found out, yet all it made her do was just laugh and think how red and embarrassed Daryl was going to be. She stopped right outside the house door and then leaned over the wooden rail. The darkness of the night had fully taken over. The moon hung high, while the stars danced brightly. To her, this was peaceful and yet she know it would not last very much longer.
