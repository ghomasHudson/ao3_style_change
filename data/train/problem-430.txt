Sherlock bit his lip, using the pain to stay grounded. It helped a bit, enough for him to pace back a step or two and gain some distance between himself and his submissive.
John made his was to the closed door and tried the handle. It opened up into an empty bathroom. Breathing a sigh of relief, he stepped into the room and relieved himself, feeling the tension seep out if his shoulders and back. It felt good to be away from home for once. The atmosphere was so smothering. His mum was almost always high on something and Harry was out all hours of the night, drinking and getting into God knows what. John's worst fear was that they would receive a call about Harry, dead in some ditch, strangled from her own vomit.
Irene sat on the bench next to him, flashing him a stern look in the mirror. “You haven't been with anyone in years. Don't you think this is all going a bit fast?”
Sherlock listened to John breathing softly against his chest, placed his hand on John's back just to feel him breathe. The room was dark, sometime near midnight, he could tell, by the lack of traffic on Baker Street. There was the occasional break of light through the window as a vehicle passed and then the room was plunged into darkness again.
History pointed toward the perp turning on Sherlock in a rage as they were often wont to do, which would in turn allow John the chance to break the hold and incapacitate the perp. How could he have been so careless? This was John's life;
Sex hadn’t been much more than something to occupy his mind, something to keep him away from more disreputable vices; merely an exchange of power and bodily fluids. Sex had never gone hand-in-hand with love and emotions, and he had years of experience to prove that. Prior to John, he never had issues with divorcing sentiment and carnal knowledge.
"Oh, don't be so dull, John. You enjoyed it, you find me attractive, no—don't bother with a useless refutation," Holmes cut in when John opened his mouth to argue. "I hired you because I need an assistant I can tolerate longer than a minute, and you seem to have come the closest to that besides Janine. Never mind that you accepted the job despite the obvious carnal attraction between us. In fact, Watson, you
John chuckled, shaking his head. Fortunately, he had a button up beneath his cardigan. Damn. It was also his favourite cardigan, but John couldn't very well walk out of the confessional with semen on his hands.
When it was over, Sherlock pulled John up and plunged his tongue inside his lover’s devious mouth, tasting himself on John's slick tongue, still salty with the film of Sherlock's semen.
Sherlock's gentle words spoken so soothingly against his flesh, were a balm, smoothing over John's frayed nerves, calming him. John nodded, and with his consent, Sherlock slung the leather cuffs over the hook that held the bar and wrapped each wrist in a cuff. The inside of the cuffs were lined with fur for added comfort and resistance against chafing; it was a relief, if John was right about Sherlock's idea. Sherlock had him lift his upper body to test the durability of the chain, before they moved on to the next sequence.
John’s breath hitched as he read the text from Sherlock, feeling his cock twitch in his knickers. God, twenty minutes until he was due in the parlour, and the urge to rub one out was damn near impossible to ignore.
"Look, I like you, Sherlock, and I know that you're not offering what I want with you, so I'd rather save you the headache and me the heartache, understand?"
With his heart in his throat, John pushed past him, eschewing Sherlock's attempt to pull him back. “John.”
"I'm sorry for being such a tosser to you yesterday. I hate when you're cross with me." John had a perfect view of Sherlock in his line of sight as he was locked in the embrace, and he could see the perfect line the man's lips had formed, almost white with the pressure he inflicted on them. John met his eyes with an almost imperceptible nod, which of course, Sherlock caught onto with sharp, observant eyes.
Just like as before, Sherlock noticed the difference in John's blood cells right away. This time, however, the cells were not dividing as they would to create rapid growth. They were undergoing necrosis.
John froze, and Sherlock along with him, a flame of excitement igniting as he felt that acute sense of danger from the Alpha.
However, that all went out the door when he turned the corner into the kitchen. This was most definitely not Mycroft.
Sherlock scowled and addressed her a scathing glare, wondering why, again, did he gravitate to such strong-willed individuals, let alone hire them. "You're ridiculous. What could he
Sherlock lay on his side beside him, head on his arm as he watched John’s back rise and fall. Faint red bands from the rope still circled his arms and thighs, but nothing that wouldn’t fade overnight.
Mycroft sniffed and pursed his lips, his chin tilting a fraction higher. “You're feisty tonight, brother. It wouldn't have anything to do with Mr Watson, would it, now?”
Molly walked further into the room, coming to stand timidly beside him, smiling gently down at the infant. "Do you miss him?"
Sherlock descended on the opposite nipple, rolling the already hardened bud between his tongue and teeth. He sucked hard once more, inciting a loud cry to slip between John's lips, before pulling away entirely. Sherlock slipped a hand in his pocket and pulled out a long silver chain linking two clips together, tipped with rubber ends. He held it up so that John could see, before leaning back in for one more lick to John's nipple, taking the bud between forefinger and thumb and attaching the clamp. Sherlock repeated the motions for the opposite nipple, before stepping back to survey his handy work.
John was the first to infringe upon their unspoken contract of silence. He rubbed a finger over his eye, nose wrinkled as if he were pained. Sherlock hated that look on him. He missed John’s vibrant smile, the crinkle around his eyes when he’d grin up at Sherlock, the way his eyes seemed to brighten several shades. Now there was just the perpetual downturn of John’s lips to greet him and the hard rigid line of his jaw, tensed to the point where Sherlock wondered if his teeth ached from the pressure.
Sherlock was breathing hard against John's cheek, loud in their private little spot, interrupted by the occasional drunken laugh from inside the pub. When John looked up, he met those dark, predatory eyes, cutting right through all of his meagre defenses.
Thank you for reading and it's always nice to hear your feedback, so please leave a comment below. Con-crit is always welcome. Join me on
Jasper shook his head to himself and kept walking, pulling the fleece cap tighter over his curls. Nothing for it now, he figured. He would have to make due with the park bench and hope that his father didn't happen by him. Jasper knew he was looking for him, and it was quite a risk sleeping outside of the shelter. Jasper hadn't even don't
John nodded once, resolutely, and steeled himself before following the trail of dried blood to the sitting room.
Jim didn't shy away or refute Sherlock's accusations, but he made sure to intimidate John and threaten to spill Sherlock's secrets. Sherlock didn't doubt for a minute that Jim would do it, but he wasn't about to back down. Jim might be able to scare his adversaries into submission, but Sherlock was never one to cower.
Mike glared at John over the rim of his specs, eyes bleary with exhaustion. "I had to come back," he sniffed. "Kate was smothering me. I couldn't take one more bowl of vegetable soup."
John's breath was tremulous, the loudest sound in the room besides the shush of leather mapping out the expanse of his back. They’d only gotten as far as rule five before Sherlock dragged John up to sit on his cock.
Sherlock allowed John to step close, bring his arms to wrap around a narrow waist. Sherlock didn't relax into the hold immediately, but he didn't push John away, either. The younger male laid his head on the chest before him, listening to the steady rhythm of Sherlock's heart, a reassuring constant in his ears.
He opened the door and walked out to the living room, not seeing his friend in the lounge room. "Jasper? That was pretty fast even for you-," he rounded the corner and felt his lips snap shut in alarm, heart racing up to his throat. This was most certainly not Jasper.
The answer came swiftly, along with the wave of guilt that washed over him every time he thought of John in any other light than his golden boy. Because he still was. John was his conductor of light and the only man that occupied his mind with any manner of importance.
After patrolling a little further into the woods, the pack regrouped and made their way back to the den, exhausted and hungry after the morning exercise.
John huffed into the phone. God, he sounded like such a child, but at this point, his actions were nearly involuntary. "I'm not- I'm not angry, I just... nothing."
Sherlock came to a stop between his legs, slotting his narrow hips into the obtuse angle his spread thighs created, until his balls were brushing against the herringbone cloth of Sherlock's trousers. Sherlock bent, until his long form was leaning over John's restrained body, his warm erection pressed against the crease of John's arse.
A long-fingered hand circled around his waist, slow and dauntless, skirting up his chest and pulling him back into a solid body. "I'm not in the habit of lowering myself to asinine proverbial phrases, regarding the likelihood of burning yourself, whilst playing with fire, Mr. Watson. I'm quite certain you're intelligent enough to know what you're doing."
Sarah closed the door behind her and looked John over with an appreciative smirk, smug and impressed with her handy work. "Here," she said tossing him the blazer, and placing the shoes down by his feet. "Good thing you boys are the same shoe size. At least Mike has some taste."
John slowly acquiesced, pulling the jumper over his head and starting on the vest below. The others of the pack were focused on the motions of the shift, but Sherlock was unabashedly watching John as he stripped, nimble fingers also divesting himself of clothing. There was nothing sexual that John could see in Sherlock's observation, but the scrutiny made him feel akin to a specimen under a microscope. Pale eyes traversed his body as one would a map, making note of his scars and the slight trembling of John's hand where it worked to unzip his fly.
Mike sat up abruptly and sent an avalanche of tissues cascading down his chest. "He what?!" His face was flushed and sweaty, but the previous lethargy was cast to the side and replaced with excitement.
“Come home with me,” he whispered into John’s hair, one large hand moving up to brush through the soft strands at his nape.  He inhaled, breathing in the salinity of John’s sweat, the musky odour of the bedsit, and his natural fragrance, herbal tea—Chamomile, a sleep aid—and rich, mossy notes.
That wasn't all. John had developed flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, a cough, congestion, muscle aches and nausea.
John nodded, unable to meet that harsh, penetrating glare currently burning a hole through the crown of his head as he prepared for the next question. "Mr Holmes, you stated you're not a man of the people, yet you have over fifty thousand people in your employ. How does that affect your relationship with your employees?"
John shrugged off the blazer, though kept the jumper on. He could admit that it fit nicely, and the attention from Sherlock had been flattering, as well as the few complimentary looks he'd garnered during his trip to the canteen. He shucked the trousers and Chelsea boots for a comfortable pair of jeans and trainers, notably more comfortable than before.
He’d be lying to himself if he said he would never make the same mistake again. Because if there was even the slightest chance of John returning to London, there was no accounting for what Sherlock would do.
John stopped a pace away, willing Sherlock to do something other than stare at him so intently. He was suffocating under the weight of that gaze, and
John nearly whined when those hands stopped, resisting the urge to thrust his hips up. "Yes - yes, it's your cock, yours, Sherlock," he stammered, unable to think of anything other than coming all over those agile fingers.
Left at the end of the corridor, follow the white tail coat. Past the long, unlit hall with the broken 'Exit' sign. No possible escape down that path, which meant they would have their perp!
Sherlock froze, mulling the thought over, while his eyes moved between John's, searching. His eyes narrowed and the small, horizontal divot on the bridge of his nose appeared as it always did when Sherlock was frustrated. Sherlock pressed his lips together and tore his eyes away briefly. When Sherlock's gaze found John's again, his eyes were aflame with determination and resentment. "Because I… You seem to have-"
John swallowed, taken aback by the malice and hostility in the man's voice. He hadn't thought about what his plan of action would be if he lived, but at this moment, John was more worried about staying alive now that he had been captured.
John felt the hair on his arm rise when he heard Holmes's office door open in the hall. Every cell in his body responded to the sound of his shoes against the marble tile, each step precise and heavy with purpose. It was frightening and exciting, and John could feel his spine straighten in anticipation.
“Come back,” John whispered against his lips, and kissed him softly, bringing Sherlock back to 221B, back to his last moments with John.
"Do you remember when we met, John, six years ago in the lab at Barts," Sherlock began. "I was fascinated with you the moment I laid eyes on you. Of course I'll never tell you this when you're older again..."
Afterwards, Sherlock sank into a black mood for the duration of the day, one so severe, John felt suffocated by the animosity and tension. He'd slunk out of the flat and walked to Regent's Park where he sat for hours on the bench and watched people go on with their normal lives. For the umpteenth time in his life, John wished for one as well.
Janine paused, her shining, espresso eyes widening, before her features smoothed easily back into the polished exterior. "Certainly, sir, I'll get right on that."
It seemed he spoke too soon, however. No sooner than the thought came to him, a black saloon rounded the corner, moving incrementally down the block, suspiciously slow.
Keeping their eyes locked, John turned his head and dragged his tongue up the length of the hand against his cheek, a pool of warmth gathering deep in his belly at the way Sherlock's eyes followed the movement, darkening with every millisecond that passed. When it was sufficiently wet, Sherlock snatched his hand away, something feral overtaking his features as he plunged his hand beneath John's pants without preamble.
He made quick work of his shower, making sure to leave no traces of Sherlock's expensive cologne on his body. Finally, he got dressed and went about brushing his teeth, and washing away the last of Sherlock along with it.
There weren't many people milling about in the sanctuary; the room was empty, save for a few scattered souls looking just as lost as John. A woman knelt at the altar, hands clasped before her face, forehead nearly touching Jesus’ bloody feet. The vicar was nowhere to be seen.
John shook his head at her, and himself, feeling foolish. "No, I think it's Holmes texting me. He wants to meet at Cafe Rouge."
As he pressed his way inside the room, he made a mental note of all the changes. The tables and chairs had been set up on either side of the stages, but a large space had been cleared in the middle of the room, and steps had been added to the bottom of the main stage. Multi-coloured aero-silks hung from the ceiling around the room and fairy lights blinked above the closed curtains. The patrons seemed not to know what to do with themselves. The tables were too far from the stage, but were available for seating. They were meant to be involved with the festivities, apparently. The older attendees seemed less than excited with the new arrangements, but others appeared to know what was coming as they spoke in enthusiastic undertones.
“Rub your hands up my thighs,” Sherlock began, stomach clenching as John obeyed without hesitation. Devastation loomed closer with every drag nearer of those agile hands to his hardness. John’s tongue, pink and perfect and wet, swept across his lips as he leaned forward, breathing cool breath over the warm slick tip of his cock.
A lone man sat at the table directly in front of her, legs crossed as he sipped absentmindedly at his drink. Couples scattered the tables, meeting eyes over the dancing flame of their candle, making silent promises that Sherlock knew would lead them through a hall and into a room that welcomed hedonistic pleasures.
He never forgot Sherlock, merely put him out of mind, but his body remembered everything. He recalled everything about the way the calloused pads of Sherlock’s fingers felt trailing down his spine, the press of lips against the nape of his neck, and a long body spread along the length of his own. A tickle of downy curls against his shoulder, the smell of semen and sweat.
“Yet, you still don't hate them, why?” It was as if Sherlock read his mind, responding, not to what John had said, but rather, his reverie on humans.
As infuriating as it was, Sherlock found himself thinking of his former lover with unsettling frequency. It was worse than before, when he didn’t know if he would ever see John again. Sherlock did everything he could to put the memory of John to rest. He’d thought that the substitutes would be an adequate distraction. None of it worked, and now that he knew John’s whereabouts, remembered what he smelled like, cataloged his changes and experienced the touch of John’s body against his again, everything intensified.
So with vigour, Sherlock began to rut on John's lap, growling as John's teeth clamped down on his shoulder. John's hands were still guiding his movements, shoved beneath his waistband to press against Sherlock's bare waist. He was sure there would be bruises there the next day, but no matter. By that time, Sherlock would be sated and hopefully indulging in another taste.
“When I was younger, I used to let my sister dress me up in her clothes and make me up like a doll, and that was just what we did. I thought all little boys did those things with their sisters, until—well, until I grew up and met other boys my age. Anyway, in sixth form, I had this friend… we’d gotten close enough that we felt comfortable telling each other everything.”
John sat on the couch with his feet on the cushion and his knees hugged against his chest, thinking about, well - everything. For the first time since Sherlock swept into his life, John wished for boring, mundane, dull. That would be a hell of a lot better than what he was feeling now.
“Because you didn’t do anything wrong, mum. You and dad are the best parents anyone could ask for. I just… I needed this for me. It had nothing to do with you.” John shook his head. “Admittedly, it was an impulsive decision, and… I’m sorry, mum.”
Without stopping to hear her reply, John swept out into the night, worried that if he stayed for one moment longer, it would take a thousand men to move him.
Following John's acceptance of Holmes' offer, the man had instructed his driver to drop John at the deli across the street from his flat and unceremoniously shoved a tenner in his hand, before ordering him to eat. After which the git proceeded to close the door in John's face. Then, the car pulled smoothly away from the kerb and disappeared into traffic as if it had never been there.
Irene grimaced, her bared shoulders falling, before she folded her arms over her chest. She was stunning, as always in her black bustier and red-feathered tail. Her dark hair was curled into rolling waves, pinned up in an intricate bun and topped off with a feather. John quite liked the colour red on Irene; it brought out the vixen in her.
“Oddly, yes,” John replied, completely aware of how unusual a situation he’d found himself in, and yet, he didn't want it to end yet. “Can you do that with everyone?”
Holmes inspected John as well, quicksilver eyes scanning over his body to linger in some places longer than others. John knew it wasn't meant to be intimate, but he couldn't suppress the shiver that traveled down his spine at having Holmes' complete focus.
Sarah would have a field day if she knew just how much John had already succumbed to Sherlock's advances in the little time they'd known one another.
"There is no discussion to be had, John. Think of it as uniform for your position. I can't have you wearing clothes like
John paced to the floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the Wharf, hands clasped behind his back as he peered down at the stream of people, tiny specks from his bird’s eye view. Holmes' eyes tracked his movement, reminding John of a wildlife documentary he'd watched a few nights ago on BBC, of a lion stalking a zebra from behind high grass, watching... hungry.
“If the brother has a green ladder, then there is your suspect,” Sherlock stated, shrugging on his coat. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I must be going.”
It was a moment filled with contradictions, chasing after a wolf he felt compelled to run away from, yet John couldn't bring himself to flee. The opportunity for escape was being dangled under his nose like steak to a starving man, and yet, John refused the offer, not wanting to stoke Sherlock's ire.
Somewhere on the street, a baby was crying, and there was far more noise than usual. What the bloody hell?
While Sherlock had given him his body, John had been doing the same for a time now, and to be cast aside so frivolously was terribly disheartening. It was everything he dreaded. John removed the butt plug, wincing as he did so, and fell back onto the mattress, curling onto his side and holding his arms around himself; holding himself together because Sherlock Holmes may have just broken him.
“And then I met Irene.” He paused, swallowing as he remembered the state he’d been in before she’d came along; holding the gun in his hands every night, contemplating suicide, toying with death. “I was in bad shape, then.”
“I want to hear you,” Sherlock begged. He’d never been one to plead for anything in his life, but he needed to hear John. Needed to hear what he could reduce him to. “Please I need to—ungh!”
A knock at the door doused the flames of their heated interaction, and Janine raised a curious brow as she stepped into the room, taking note of the heavy atmosphere and John’s proximity to Sherlock. Wisely, she chose to stay mum. John hadn't noticed how close they became. Holmes was near enough to touch. As he twisted, John could see his jaw tighten in obvious frustration, before falling back into cool insouciance.
He looked up at John with mock curiosity and a blatant hunger that made John nauseous. "Sod off," he growled, trying to be brave, when all he felt was wariness and fear. Courageous: yes. Smart: not even.
room?" He wasn't even asking anymore, but rather, giving voice to his chaotic thoughts. All of it was a lot to take in. "And you want my consent, first?"
Sherlock growled and stomped off, clutching his unruly curls, before he swung back to John, a sudden current of energy. “There’s nothing to tell you yet, John! This—” Sherlock snatched the note from John's hands. “Is nothing! It's merely a child playing a game. What am I to do with this—
"Good," he replied quickly, right on the tail end of Jasper's reluctant assent. "And if you insist on continuing your silly little theatrics, you might want to actually have the telly powered on." With that dressing down promptly completed, Sherlock pivoted back into the room and slammed the door hard enough to rattle the windows.
Sherlock hadn't realized how much he missed John's voice until it wasn't there to admonish him. John's propensity for scolding him wasn't sorely missed as much as the sound of his pleasant tenor, the moments of easy conversation between them, even his absent presence beside Sherlock felt like a hole in his side. He dearly missed his partner, but infant-John was proving to be just as much of a worthy distraction as adult-John. As before, he would take John in any form than not having John around at all. Sherlock had learned his lesson with the likes of Mary Morstan. Even now, Mary was a distant figure in the past, but he clearly remembered the nights without John, drinking his scotch alone on their wedding night, missing his best friend. It was hateful, a life without his partner.
Throughout his life, John came into contact with many men - and women - like Holmes: vain, unaccommodating, egocentric, and used to getting what they want. Often, John found those traits repellant and unattractive, but in Holmes, it seemed less forced and more innate.
If Sherlock's eyes were cold before, they were terrifyingly frigid now. "He goes, because I say he does. The safety of the pack is the only thing your silly little mind should be dwelling on, now stop your useless nattering and let us go on about our business!" That being said, the man pushed past Victor and swept out of the room impatiently, followed closely by Lestrade and Sally.
“Well, looks like everything is fine here. I'll let your brother know so he’ll let me get on with my real job,” Lestrade said as he headed to the door. “It's good to see you doing well, John. Sherlock, I'll let you know if I get anything up your alley.”
John could hear his name being spoken like a prayer now, and something about hearing Sherlock's possessive chant pushed him over the edge. John came harder than anything he had ever done, body convulsing beneath the larger one atop him, feeling as if his soul was leaving him. Sherlock was not far behind, hips moving erratically now, until they tensed above him, and pale eyes squeezed shut with the force of the orgasm, lips open in a soundless groan.
Right on cue, John's stomach emitted a hell of a rumble, effectively pouring salt in an already bleeding wound. It was just one thing after another, wasn't it?
Mr. Holmes rolled his eyes, walking to the black armchair and flopping as gracefully as one can flop into it in a way that so reminded John of his friend that he almost laughed aloud. Now he could see the root of all of Jasper's eccentric behaviours.
Now, I know you all will be spitting fire at me over this chapter, but please remember: this is not the last story of this series and it WILL have a happy ending. Our boys just have some shit to work out and they're both ridiculously stubborn. So stick with me and I hope to see you all in the next story with amazingly hot smut and all the feels ready! I cannot thank you enough, my friends. I love you all! Come visit me on
John swallowed his mouthful and leant forward to place his cup back on the tray before he continued. "As the CEO of a rather large company, it's quite clear that you put in a lot of extra hours here, but outside of work, what are your interests?"
Snippets of later in the night flashed through John's mind. Waking in the early hours for another round of sex; Sherlock pushing John onto his belly as he slid into his body, hips circling in a slow, sensual dance that left John a wreck underneath him. Afterwards, John wanted to weep at the possibility that he would never have this again, but Sherlock snogged him, leaving John with no doubt about where he was and with whom.
Gillian shoved through his henchman and stomped off, leaving a horde of confused, high teenagers stumbling behind him.
As true as it was, John hadn’t expected Sherlock to be so forward, but with all he heard about Sherlock before the shoot, he probably should have expected it.
Sherlock looked at him a few long seconds before sipping his tea. “A week ago,” he said when he pulled the cup away.
That night, John dreamed of Sherlock, of gleaming pointed teeth and glowing pale eyes that followed him in the darkness. Wherever he was, it was void of any light and he could hear echoes and whispers playing off of hollow surfaces, but his sight failed him.
With a parting wink, the woman stepped into the lift, and whipped her phone out, effectively dismissing John as the doors closed.
Molly was crying again, silently, tears tracking zigzags down her cheeks as she smiled at the tiny infant wrapped in a sheet, in her arms. "The drugs Förstner injected in him didn't kill him. They somehow reset his biological clock, but it could be temporary." Molly wiped her eyes with the back of her free hand before being it back up to cradle the infant's back. "We don't know the long term effects of the drugs, but you should know... Mycroft has already gotten involved."
With John, Sherlock could see that the man was unfalteringly moralistic and unusually steadfast. All it would take was a bit of probing, and Sherlock would have John cracked open, just as disgustingly easy as the rest.
Sherlock’s pupils were large and endless underneath the soft, yellow light hanging over their booth. Once again, John was bewitched, enthralled, possibly even enamoured. “Do you know you do that out loud?” He asked, his voice even and rich.
When he opened his eyes, Sherlock was staring at him with something akin to awe and intrigue, as if they were meeting for the first time and hadn’t just had sex. John’s pulse sped up, thumping loudly in his ears as a peculiar sensation welled up just below his sternum.
John’s lips parted for him just as easily as his thighs when Sherlock’s hands sank beneath the sheets to feel his hardness, swallowing John's whimpers like a starving man. Sherlock thrust his tongue forward to meet John’s, wet breathy moans dragging up his throat only to spill into the slick cavern of John’s mouth. He was hard as marble beneath his trousers, pressing up against the seam as he palmed John’s cock until he was bucking into Sherlock’s hand with abandon.
Sherlock watched him for another moment, before reaching out a hand to pull John forward. "You are exceptional," he rumbled, leaning down and placing his lips over John's.
Then there was the flicker of something gaping and hungry in the way Sherlock regarded him. John couldn't even begin to fathom what Sherlock was thinking, but he was sure it skirted along the usual lines of pleasure and pain, and the sweet, sweet depravity of it all.
Sherlock growled darkly, and John felt it travel through his feet and into his bones, making them quake with restrained energy. The alpha was no longer simply a werewolf; he was a demon hound from hell, and John watched as Sherlock began to blend in seamlessly with the shadows as he darted forward. Sherlock's ears were pulled back against his head, his hackles a legion of pointed needles against his back, as he pursued the human with remorseless glee.
The sensation was immediate. John bucked at the wash of pain and pleasure, the tug on his nipples, still tender from Sherlock's probing tongue and teeth. It wasn't the pain as much as it was the pressure of the clamps stymying the blood flow to his nipples. It was a strange feeling, but there was something erotic about the pain and who was causing it that left John breathless and wanting more.
Once she’d recovered, on their next pass, Irene nicked his hat and put it on, blowing John a cheeky kiss.
Sherlock paused, raising his other hand to splay on the small of John's back proprietarily. His voice betrayed his actions, cold and hard like marble, and sharper than any two-edged sword. "The safety of my pack is all that matters, everything, everyone else is irrelevant; disposable. I don't intend to simply trace these hunters. I intend to wipe them out of existence. I want you there with me when it happens."
Sherlock could be lying, but there was no way for John to prove it. His aggravation appeared sincere, but John didn’t yet know everything that Sherlock was capable of.
Sherlock's hands were moving up his stomach now, mapping the skin, filing away bits and pieces of John. It was a testament of his will that his knees didn't give out under that sure touch. Sherlock's body was stuck to him like glue, and John could feel a hardness pressing back against his belly.
Sherlock sighed heavily, across the room, as the lady rambled on, before finally he cut in. "Yes, thank you Mrs. Hudson. If that will be all, good afternoon," he grit out, closing the door on her just as she opened her mouth to reproach him.
After that, Sherlock hadn't taken a submissive again, instead garnering a string of nightly lovers to sate his habit. That was, until John.
“Look at you, so needy,” Sherlock tutted, standing before John, his crotch at eye-level. He invaded his space, grabbing the back of John's head and leading his reddened face to Sherlock's bulging trousers. “You have no idea what it's taking not to shove my dick inside of your pretty pink mouth.”
Sherlock didn't move or say anything, but John could feel those all-seeing eyes, picking him apart, though allowing John to say what happened in his own words. He was grateful that Sherlock had never blurted out his story, as the Alpha was prone to do with private things.
“Last night, I'd come to the conclusion that what I may be feeling for you is something that I previously thought out of my range of capabilities. I wasn't sure what to make of it, or you for that matter.”
“Yes, well… don’t get used to it,” John said, smiling down at the boiling red sauce hissing and popping around his wooden spoon.
If John wasn’t hard before, he certainly was now. The purr of Sherlock’s gravelly baritone in his ear overwhelmed him, turned his thoughts into puddles of slush. His hesitation fled and with Sherlock pressed up against him, John knew there was only one answer that he wouldn’t regret.
However, when Sherlock tore his eyes away from father and son, they immediately locked with a less forgiving pair.
"Sherlock," John called softly, wishing he could reassure him, but for all he knew, this was good news to Sherlock.
Without anything else to distract him, Sherlock finally turned to the sorry sight of his former lover on the bed. In proportion to the mattress, the room, his own shadow, John seemed unacceptably small. He’d never been a large man, but where before John’s presence in a room more than made up for his slight frame, now it only diminished him. Beneath the thin, nearly transparent material of his vest, John’s clavicles were sharp and pronounced against his tawny skin. Sherlock didn’t have to disrobe John to know what would be underneath; protruding ribs and a stomach one less meal away from concaving.
It wasn't quite what he’d had in mind, but neither of them were in the state to be going any further. Sherlock wasn't sure he could pretend that he wasn't still angry with John. He was furious, and no amount of sentiment could make him forget the years they lost together all because John felt that he couldn't come to him.
"Even in this form, Dr Watson is partial to you," Mycroft noted in a soft, pensive tone. He waited a moment before flicking his eyes up to Sherlock's. "You do realize there is always a chance he won't remember you."
Sherlock smirked and caught John's wrist in a strong grasp. “My clever, clever boy,” Sherlock purred, his lips running against John's as he spoke. “I have spoiled you, haven't I?”
When John finally sat down to eat, he realized he didn't have much of an appetite after all. Now that the effects of the fight were cleared away, he thought of nothing but the brutality of their killing.
One: he could face himself and try and figure out what the jumble of emotions assaulting him were, and confront John...
The chair in the corner reminded him of a warm body across his lap, and the mirror spanning the wall brought with it the image of John tied up, ankles to wrists. John, splayed and cuffed to the bed, senses muffled and writhing from the arousing pain of Sherlock's flogger. Their phantom figures on the floor, fucking like dogs, John's back arched beneath Sherlock's chest, thighs spread and his sweet prick nearly kissing the ground.
Everything inside him quivered under the strength of Sherlock's look, burrowing into John's body like a parasite. It was startling and exciting, all the same.
Forcibly tearing his attention back to the possible threat, John crouched behind him, unchanged, and waited for a signal.
For all that Janine was being facetious, she made valid arguments. Sherlock already knew that being exposed to John everyday would only lead down one path. There was no way Sherlock could work so near to John without the two of them falling into bed together eventually. It was inevitable.
“Take a few minutes to look it over,” Sarah suggested, standing and flashing a gentle smile. “Back in a tick.” She laid a reassuring hand on his shoulder as she passed him, and then he was alone.
Miss Vicky grinned, her rouge lips pulling back excitedly to reveal her dimples. “Well, let’s give the man a show he’ll never forget. Who knows, maybe he’ll get lucky and end up with me in his bed.”
Holmes shrugged and pointed a perfunctory finger at the menu clutched tightly in John's hands. "I noticed while you were looking over the menu, you skimmed over the other items, but lingered on the Breton Poulet. You turned the page, but bookmarked it with your finger suggesting that something on that particular page caught your interest. It's all a matter of observation, John. A child could do it.”
It was gratifying to say those words he'd been fighting for days, weeks; God, how long had it been since Sherlock's offer was placed on the table between them?
With one more grounding breath, John pulled open the door and stepped out into the hall. The music didn't stop this time, not until he was well into the sitting room, standing awkwardly off to the side as Sherlock completed his piece.
"There's going to be a lot of people up there who aren't going to want you here, a lot of riled up wolves itching for a fight. We all saw the hunters the night Sherlock came by you in the woods," Lestrade paused and shook his head, looking into John's eyes. "They're all a bit wary now, they think you've led them here and so does the pack leader. Whenever Sherlock is worried, then we all are, so try not to provoke them."
Sherlock kept the media mum, but it put John at ease that Sherlock had the power to do something about it. God knows John doesn't have any kind of money to be bribing journalists.
Jasper had helped him keep the man securely on the ground while John wrapped gaffa tape around his captive's beefy wrists.
Finally, John looked away and sank diffidently into the seat, holding tightly to the handle of his cane. Sherlock dropped his eyes for a moment to regroup and allow John to settle in his seat without feeling judged.
Mycroft appeared haunted by these thing, as well. There was an endless comprehension in Mycroft's gaze, one John recognized as a man who'd seen too much in his life. “Not everything is a war, Sherlock, one day, you may have to put aside your pride and -”
“Deeper, John,” he demanded, pushing his hips down further. “You're a medical student,” he breathed, his words slurred. “You should be able to find my prostate quite easily. Even just a brush…”
Sherlock tipped John's chin up with a finger, until John was drowning in a nearly translucent gaze, bright and predatory. Once he had John's attention, Sherlock brought his hand up to cup his cheek. "You're going to have to get my hand wet, quickly now," he urged.
Jasper's voice took on a high pitched tone as he waggled a finger at John. "Just this once, dear. I'm your landlady, not your housekeeper."
Shaking his head at himself and his unreliable thoughts, John grabbed his jacket from the coat rack and threw it on at the door. "So, The Watch House?"
He’d promised no sex, but this was more than sex. This was an awakening and Sherlock was helpless to stop it.
“Actually, I was just about to grab lunch,” Jasper blurted, appearing shy, almost. “Meeting someone rather. Um, do you want to join me?”
, not submitting as John assumed the penetrated partner always did, but there was no other way to describe what this was. Sherlock owned him, mind, body, and soul and John would go out a slave to him because Sherlock commanded it so.
Sherlock had made good on his threat to place a butt plug inside of him, so John was keenly aware of the hardness between his arse cheeks as Sherlock trailed the crop down his belly, eschewing his cock to brush lightly over his bollocks. John gasped at the cool touch of leather against his skin, the trail tingling pleasantly in the wake of the crop.
His chest heaved beneath his jumper, and he flinched at the chafe of fabric against his hardened nipples, where Holmes' fingers caressed him during their heated embrace. John inhaled slowly in an attempt to calm his thunderous heartbeat and the array of emotions raging through him.
"Then he would allow you to stay in my life without interference," Sherlock growled, though there wasn't any real fire behind the words, just resigned exhaustion.
Sherlock, decidedly not a selfish lover, had laid him out on the bed and wrung every bit of pleasure that he could from John, and every noise, Sherlock would catch on his tongue. It was near sweet enough to make John want to weep and wretch. In return, Sherlock had allowed John to take his pleasure. John had straddled him, and rode Sherlock until they were both reaching for oblivion. He made sure that Sherlock came first, and followed swiftly in his wake, feeling buoyant and dazed.
"What's with this retro wardrobe, John," Sarah quipped disapprovingly in John's general direction, from the damp, dark abyss that was the back of his closet. His only answer to that was a two finger salute at the back of her pretty little head.
So John squared his shoulders and readied himself to go forward, into the grey unknown that was their foggy future, and parted his lips:
Being on the run was more work than Jasper thought possible, but between his father being a genius and his uncle running the government and all, Jasper thought he was been doing quite well.
A wide thumb came down to swipe across John's mouth, gathering the fluid, and he couldn't help but dart his tongue out for a small taste. Sherlock's eyes narrowed, gaze burning a path down the mess on John's chin, the blush down his collarbone, meandering down until they stopped at his covered cock, pressing insistently against his pants, and widened slightly.
Sherlock paused, and shifted on his feet, pulling his hand away from John's wrist to run his fingers through his hair in exasperation. He growled at himself, annoyed, before seeming to reign in his vexation. "What I mean to say is, you mean something to me, John, more than you give yourself credit for, in any case."
The ride to the office building was mercifully brief. Sherlock directed the cabbie to pull into his personal entrance in the underground car park, relieving him from enduring any social interactions until he was safely on the top floor.
“Morning,” said Greg, and hurried to the kitchen without making eye contact. Maybe if he didn't acknowledge it, then neither would Sherlock.
Decision made, Sherlock tipped him over until John’s back touched the floor. Sherlock hovered over him, pulse racing and throat tight as John stared up at him with eyes far more worldly than he remembered. Sherlock could reconcile that John was a different man, now, but he would always look at John and see the young man that had trusted him so completely; the young man that Sherlock adored and would do anything for. They were one and the same, but with some marked differences.
“Is this what you want?” Sherlock asked. “Because after this, there will be no disappearing. I want everything from you, John, and not just your reluctant cooperation.”
It was an odd feeling, painful, as the blood flowed back to his legs and arms, and John knew that he was not going to feel pleasant in the morning. He could feel the wetness between his arse cheeks, the soft plop of Sherlock's come dripping onto the hardwood as he walked.
John retreated to the sitting room to greet her, smiling at the spry old woman placing a plate of fresh biscuits on the table. Mrs Hudson turned to regard him with a soft smile, wiping her hands on the frilly apron around her waist. “Oh, there you are, dear. I thought I'd heard you boys come in. I've made more biscuits than the ladies in my bridge club can handle, so I thought you both might enjoy them.” She looked around. “Now where has that man gone off to now, leaving you here all alone?”
John shrugged once her eyes landed upon his person, trailing down his front in a calculated, assessing once-over. "I've a feeling I could get used to this." After years of slumming it in a dodgy flat with Mike, the lavish surroundings were nothing to sniff at.
John was glad Holmes hadn't looked up just then. He would have caught John's enraptured, starry-eyed gaze and the blood draining from his face at the ridiculous rush of arousal. Why the hell did the arrogant sod have to be so gorgeous?
On the other end, Molly inhaled tremulously, and in the background, a soft coo sounded through the receiver. "Sherlock, you need to come down to the morgue. It's John... I don't know how this can be happening."
Also, I did have a playlist when I wrote this chapter, or rather, a few songs I just played on repeat! You can listen and read if you'd like, it's not required. You decide which part it goes with...
John had been dreaming fitfully of a wolf so dark he blended flawlessly with the night. The eyes stood out in the darkness, glowing a color he had never before seen, intelligent beyond anything John had ever witnessed, frightfully observant and menacing. John dreamed sharp teeth plunging through skin, painted in red.
"I do hope so, John." Sarah stared at him seriously for a moment longer before a slow, mischievous smile slid across her lips. "I've also heard he's quite a looker."
It was too good to be true, and yet John found himself hoping for it nonetheless. If it turned out to be true, then it would be better than any Christmas gift John could ever receive. “And last night,” John asked reluctantly, “will there be more of that.”
His head was pounding with the wave of information that came with Irene's visit to the office. It was obvious that the woman was just as barmy as Sherlock, if not more so, and someone close to him. Sherlock seemed like a man who valued his privacy, and yet, Irene stepped into his office as if she'd done so many time before, without fear of repercussion. Who was she to Sherlock?
“Clever boy,” he crooned. John groaned, one hand clenching around Sherlock’s cock, while the other clutched his dripping curls in a tight fist. “I’ve missed you.”
With sure movements, the finger entered him, rubbing inside of him the further back it went, until Sherlock found what he’d been searching for. John’s breath hitched as Sherlock began to massage his prostate. He closed his  eyes in pleasure.
Immediately, Sherlock could see Jasper bristle in defensiveness, his green eyes rising to glare at his father as he folded his arms defiantly over his chest. “What's that supposed to mean?”
No matter what his logic told him, Sherlock was certain that he’d be returning to 221C very soon with its long lost occupant.
"I see," he murmured, and the Alpha male visibly bristled at the declaration, balling his fists by his sides. For some odd reason, the visual display excited Sherlock.
Sherlock focused those laser point eyes on him, unbearably astute, "How long did he give you?" His voice was low and strained, yet his eyes were an amalgamation of emotions he couldn't force past his lips. Things he would never be able to say, just on the tip of Sherlock's tongue, and none of it would ever reach John's ears.
The aroma wafting from the kitchen was mouthwatering, and John realized he hadn't had much to eat that day, besides a slice of toast and a packet of crisp he grabbed during the graduation celebration. Right on queue, John's stomach groaned loudly, as if he hadn't enough to be embarrassed about already.
Sherlock scoffed in disbelief, but his eyes were crystalline beneath his lashes. "When have you ever known me to need coddling," he spat venomously.
"Can you see what you've done to us?" Jasper asked sadly, eyes gone cold and flinty. "Just leave; just go home."
Sherlock ended up taking him back to Westminster, which John was sure he'd done intentionally. He knew Sherlock wasn't going to let him go for the night, and surprisingly, John found that being held hostage by the madman made him flush with pleasure.
John crashed through the bramble violently, paws pounding against the dirt as it pulled up beneath his feet. Every stride was an exercise in endurance and his breath pulled sharply from his lungs with each long stride he took. The hunters were on his tail, guns loaded with bullets that, once broken through skin, expelled a liquid silver that spread like fire almost immediately. The hunters had been chasing him for hours at this rate, and each step felt like an extra kilometer, but John knew he couldn't stop. His body hummed with adrenaline and fear, knowing that one misstep could cost his life.
Sherlock's face was a blank slate, but his eyes glowed with satisfaction and pride, jumping past passionate sapphire to an inflamed celadon.
He strode out without bothering to wait for Liam. He’d catch up… eventually. Sherlock left the conference room and headed down the hall toward his office. Once there, he stepped in and shut the door behind him, hoping for a moment of peace without the drone of numbers and quotas clogging up his mind. A lunch break to text his dealer and schedule a meeting would be the cure-all.
Irene was like a sodding dog with a bone; the woman could never let things go. John loved her, but he disliked that quality in her, at times. There were some things he didn't want to talk about neither with her, or anyone else.
"Last night was only a taste of what I have in store for you, John. Everything else you may believe is irrelevant."
John's babbling was becoming more formed around words Sherlock would say often, though they were still unintelligible. Sherlock watched it all closely with unhindered fascination, documenting it all only to add it to his mind palace in the wing dedicated to John. It was a rare and unobtrusive opportunity to observe growth rates and child development, but he was also a witness of John's childhood. With the new information, Sherlock wondered if his influence would somehow affect John as he grew back into adulthood.
Sherlock granted John a concessionary nod. In that respect, John had a point, but Sherlock would never say so aloud. For all that he recognized John’s reluctance, the thought of him coming back without a word made Sherlock grit his teeth in annoyance.
John moaned, hitting his head back against the bark of the trees behind him. The feeling of his cock against Sherlock's was heady and tortuous. God, he needed this, hadn't felt this since Bill, but he couldn't bear to think of his former lover now, when Sherlock was ready to have him against this tree, in these unfamiliar woods.
"Oh my, I didn't realize we had company," she turned to Sherlock, placing her hands on her hips with a motherly frown at the disgruntled alpha. "Sherlock, you might have told me; I could have done a fry-up!"
Sherlock swallowed around John's erection, the head hitting the back of his throat drew full-bodied shivers from John's body. It was altogether too much and not nearly enough, but the finger circling his anus said that if only John had patience, something else would come soon enough.
John's gaze drifted around the room, searching, until they stopped at the window, where everything suddenly became quite clear. Evidently, parts of his theory were not unfounded. John had, indeed, been kidnapped by a madman.
John couldn't stifle the grin at the blush rising on Sherlock's cheeks. The man was always so self-assured and in control, it was a relief to see him so bashful, so... human.
John followed behind Sherlock, Molly, and Lestrade as they darted through the trees opposite the direction of the other three. Sherlock was a challenge to keep up with as he darted around trees and leaped over small streams, enormous paws kicking up clouds of dirt and mud. The man was intractable as a wolf, running almost as if he were trying to shake them off of his tail.
Finally, he deigned to speak. “You are beginning to show your hand, dear brother, to all and sundry,” Mycroft stated, soft and firm. “You’re allowing others to see your weakness, as if you’ve forgotten what you are worth, what you’ve worked for.”
“I’m still not quite sure about you, Mr Holmes, but if there’s one thing you should be aware of, it’s that I know when my son is hiding things.” She paused long enough to let that settle in. Sherlock’s brow rose in expectancy. “My husband mentioned a fellow quite a while back. I knew then that he was seeing someone, but Johnny has always been a private one.”
They had all enjoyed it, even Lestrade who put up a good front of disapproving, but John saw the glee in his eyes as the hunters were torn down one-by-one. Even John enjoyed it. For wolves, the thrill of capturing and killing the prey was innate. They had all given over to their primal sides completely.
At night, he rarely slept anymore, though, and when he did, Jasper almost always made a debut. Those green eyes blighted with a sheen of tears, and the betrayal, hurt; never had John thought that anything he did could inflict that sort of pain on anyone.
The embrace was an intimate one and surprisingly comforting to John, though he knew it shouldn't be. He'd only ever felt that way with Bill.
He sighed. When he turned back to John, the other man was blushing and avoiding his gaze. Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled out his phone, texting his usual Thai restaurant for delivery. He was out of their delivery network, but the owner was indebted to him. In fact, he owned a share of the place after bailing it out of foreclosure.
John made enough food and tea for the three of them, and they all ate silently, each lost in their own thoughts. Sherlock had taken a few bites and then promptly ignored his plate, allowing Jasper the chance to swoop down and grab it. When they were done, John and Jasper brought their book bags to the table while Sherlock sat at the island and peered at a slide through the lens of his microscope.
John’s hand skated under his shirt and Sherlock shivered beneath the touch. He turned his head and nosed John’s fringe aside, sought skin with his lips and trembled with want when at last he found it.
Jim offered the seat again, and this time Puppy accepted, keeping his legs closed to veil his bits with the towel. How cute. “Sherly and I have history, you know,” Jim began, lifting one corner of his lips reminiscently. “Oh Puppy, do believe me when I tell you that Sherlock Holmes was an
had drugged her beer and taken her to an empty room, but it hadn't been William Murray. Now, Murray was going to train at Pirbright barracks in Surrey for the medical corps, with John, and he owed Sherlock a favour. Sherlock would see it paid, and Mycroft would never have to know.
John stood and made his way to Sherlock, cautiously, until he was looking up into verdigris irises, watching Sherlock watch him. "You don't have to do this, Sherlock. Your pack needs you; they need their leader."
"Jasper-," John attempted to cut in, but snapped his lips shut tightly when the older boy rounded on him furiously.
“Then perhaps…” Sherlock pushed him off, chuckling at John’s surprise, which quickly turned into bliss as he was turned onto his belly and entered again.
Jasper’s eyes grew wide behind the replaced glasses. “What?” he asked, sitting up, and it was just calm enough to reveal the panic in his green eyes. Before things could get out of hand, Mycroft hastened to smooth things over.
The actions of the hunters led Sherlock to imagine a hateful man, yet the writing was that of an open person; Sherlock would even go so far as to say friendly. However, going by what little evidence he had would be a fatal mistake. Sherlock would need something more. He had a feeling that the nursery rhyme was only the first clue of many. He would be remiss in thinking that this person wouldn't find a way to get the next one to him, somehow.
Fifteen minutes later, and Mike was even more sold on the idea, much to John's consternation. It seemed this time, he couldn't count on Mike to be in his corner.
Sherlock stared for a moment before sliding the letter in his pocket. “Fine,” he acquiesced, and seeing his son’s hunched shoulders and downcast eyes, Sherlock did something he hadn't done since Jasper was thirteen, when he was still allowed to show affection without embarrassing him: he wrapped a hand around his son's nape and pulled him forward, placing his lips on his forehead for a several seconds. Before Jasper could respond, he let go and swept out the door with a heavy chest.
“Patience, John,” Sherlock said, and then ran a finger through the come on John's chest. “You want to taste it,” he deduced, placing his wet fingers over John's lips. “Open for me.”
Sherlock sighed and let himself into his office, ignoring the tepid cup of tea on his desk as he claimed his chair. He ran his hand through his hair, shuddering as it pulled at his sore scalp, still sensitive from John’s death grip. He wanted to see what havoc he’d wreaked on John’s body, catalogue the bruises on his hips and watch the red marks fade from John’s back on account of the hardwood floors.
They had talked on the phone during the week, but John hadn't seen Sarah since his graduation party. It was a relief to be surrounded in her warmth after spending a day in the cold, colourless building behind him.
None of them knew how many hunters were to come, or if there would be too many to fight off. There was the realization that these could be their last peaceful meals for a long while. The pack had to decide whether they would fight or flee.
Sherlock ignored the man, placing a hand on the small of John's back as the doorman opened the door to allow them inside. The photographer snapped a picture, anyways. Men and women were dressed in their finest, but comfortable among colleagues as some cackled loudly among their groups while others spoke in low, sophisticated murmurs. Lovefool played at a subdued volume beneath the hum of voices, which a few people were dancing drunkenly to.
Sherlock smirked, picturing his friend trying to curl his long legs against the back of the chair. Much like Sherlock, he caught his naps wherever he could. Both of them ran on little sleep for days and when the urge to rest hit, being picky was not an option.
It was the first time he’d caught a glimpse of Moriarty in years. The man had gone to ground just as soon as his name had been cleared. Because of the notoriety of his company and the accusations of his crimes, Moriarty’s name hadn’t been forgotten. Every few years, one bold journalist would have a crack at finishing Sherlock’s work and discrediting Moriarty, but none of the investigations ever amounted to anything.
The skin round his eyes were baggy and dark. There were no sleeping on the streets of London, lest he wake up in some unfamiliar place with a bleeding arse, and the mind-numbing fear that he'd possibly contracted any number of diseases attributed to unsafe sex.
“Will you stay?” he asked, staring down at John with what he hoped was confident optimism and not the crushing desperation he truly felt. Good God, had he gone his whole life without experiencing sentiment, then that would have been perfectly fine. It ruled everything he did; changed every game. No wonder it made Mycroft sick.
There were trails of dark streaks leading to the sitting room, where John would find the bodies in whatever state they may be. The sharp thump of Sherlock's boots approaching made his back stiffen. Before yesterday, John hadn't given any thought to burying his kin in any way but alone. Sherlock was the unexpected variable, the last person John would have expected to volunteer, to leave his pack in the care of a surrogate alpha. John knew it wasn't pure altruism. If Sherlock didn't find the head of the snake and cut it off, his pack would die next. But… there was something in the way he looked at John the night before, the way he’d enquired of John's plans to stay. Sherlock wanted him, John knew, but John wasn't even sure he was ready for anything, for another alpha.
Sherlock didn't have to wait long. Molly Hooper was a young girl, foolish and blinded by petty sentiments, such as jealousy. She turned an accusing finger on one Greg Lestrade, the secret lover of her sister, Margot, and the housekeeper's son.
John moaned as one particular manoeuvre from Holmes made his mouth go dry. Holmes’ breathing was ragged and John knew he was close. John could feel an orgasm building from the tip of his toes, to the way his leg clamped around Holmes’ shoulder and his thighs began to quiver.
The thought that moments ago, Sherlock was pacing around the kitchen and John was eating a sandwich at the table, was startling. A few minutes longer, and they would have been lying in puddles of their own blood.
John crossed his arms, chuckling, though he was as far from amused as he could get. “Upset. Yes, Sherlock, of course I'm upset!”
At five, John got up and made tea for one and a slice of toast for a lonely breakfast in the kitchen. The house was eerily silent without Sherlock's usual noise, besides the shift and creak of the old building settling. The man was usually flouncing around the flat at that hour, and if John happened to be staying over, Sherlock would be making as much noise as humanly possible in an effort to wake all of bloody London.
It was really happening, and Sherlock was staring down at him with lips pressed together and his eyes wide, but his nostrils flared and John refused to look away. John's entire body was trembling and Sherlock’s balls were sliding along his forearm as the man began to rock slowly. All John could see was him in this moment. “Sherlock,” he whispered, the name cracking in his throat.
Mycroft, however, laughs at him. "Oh, little brother, in all of your years upon this Earth, have you ever been able to lie to me?"
Sherlock let John explore every inch of his exposed throat with his lips, and it always sent a very welcomed shiver down his spine when the tip of John's nose would lightly brush at his skin. He loved this part of John. Romance with John, Sherlock decided, was like a thriller film. It was filled with twists and turns, all unexpected and all of them leaving you begging for more. Sometimes, he would get the sweet, careful, compassionate John that would stroke his skin lovingly while they lounged about in bed. That John would take baths with him after a dreadful, grueling case and gently massage his skin in the warm water, relieving the tension there, and would let him talk and talk and talk until he was hoarse, all while smiling down at him like he were the greatest prize in the world. Other times, he would get the funny, ridiculous best friend John that would get drunk with him (when they got a break from parenting and cases) and play stupid board games with him and make him laugh until his stomach hurt. That John never let him forget that he was more than his lover or his partner. That John never let him forget that Sherlock was his best friend.
Mary suddenly became very pale, and she turned around very slowly, taking in the form of her husband standing by the stairs, very much the soldier again, with his back straight, his legs shoulder width apart, and his gun raised at a perfect angle, while the other hand hung loosely at his side, fingers slightly curled, ready to be raised to steady the gun if necessary. His face was expressionless, but there was no mistaking the black fury and disgust behind his eyes. John Watson's eyes never left his wife's face.
Greg brought the detective to the hospital, and sat with him in his room for a few hours while Sherlock stared at the floor. He told them that Mycroft had sent over his best men to investigate the burnt remains of the warehouse, and that most of the police forces of the state of California were sorting through the wreckage to find John Watson. He told him John was strong, and that he was okay. He told him John would be okay.
The doctor smiled up at his friend, wishing he could go with him. "Thank you for coming. Have fun with your murders." He joked.
John looked up to meet his gaze, and when he saw the anger, he let go of his arms, and stepped back, only to stare at the floor. "You really don't know, do you?" He whispered to the floor, sounding winded.
come alone. Police should be no less than twenty minutes behind you, I do suggest you send an ambulance along. It is so very important that you do not come with officers. Mary is already on her way, and if she suspects trouble, she'll kill him, so, you must come alone. Understood?" She spoke quickly and urgently, just like one in the midst of a war would speak.
Jim's heart was racing, and his breath was coming in short, painful gasps. For once, he couldn't think, he couldn't rely on his deduction skills, he couldn't read Sebastian... For the moment, he just panicked. "Please tell me you're lying." He pleaded weakly. "Please. I don't care if you're mad at me, just... Please, tell me you're lying. Please."
He turns around, and his eyes fall on John. He looks angry, blue eyes piercing as he keeps his hands raised up to his head as he walks slowly into the room. Sherlock stares at him in alarm, and he opens his mouth to speak...
Sebastian suddenly pulled away, and locked his eyes with Jim's, his expression remaining hard. "Is this really what you want? Do you really want to leave with me?"
Jim nodded, pulling each bottle out. "Barbera d'Asti for Irene and I, because we're classy, Verdicchio for you and Dana, because you're weird." He teased gently, placing both bottles on the counter.
Sherlock wanted to be angry. He wanted to blame someone, the maintenance people for not fixing the clock, the traffic for not stopping quick enough, the people who built Bart's for not building it closer, the army for not allowing John more time, anyone he could be angry at silently. But, in the end, he knew it was his fault, and there was no one to blame but himself. He wondered if John was mad at him for missing it.
And as he floats through the calming waters, he dreams of home. He dreams of Baker Street, with the seventeen steps he walks up and down day after day, and the smiley on the wall. He dreams of bright mornings in the kitchen, and the sounds of rustling paper and laptop keys. He smells Mrs. Hudson's freshly baked biscuits downstairs, and he hears the crowded London streets outside He dreams of late nights on in the living room after cases while the adrenaline wears off. He misses Baker Street. But, 221B is a flat, and nothing more. Home, to him, is much more.
Sherlock thought bitterly, then placed the letter back up against the skull. He didn't want to read it now.
"Yes, you are!" Jim shouted, his voice raising hysterically. "You're just mad at me, and you're trying to scare me!"
"Sherlock!" He called again, running back through the living room and throwing the door to the detective's bedroom door open. The room was absolutely trashed, which was very unlike him. Experiments were over turned, papers were everywhere, but there was no Sherlock Holmes. He was alone.
John didn't seem ready to run. In fact, he stood a little straighter, and locked his jaw once again, keeping up his soldier appearance. "I care, Sherlock, because I'm your friend."
The man smiles at him in a sickeningly sweet way, then kicks at the back of John's legs, sending the doctor to his knees, and Sherlock jumps forward to catch him, but the man points the gun at the back of John's head, and Sherlock stays.
John couldn't help but laugh at his star-struck sounding voice. "I love you, Sherlock. I'm coming to get you."
The detective limped forward, ignoring the throbbing pain in his ankle, searching through the wreckage for his boyfriend. "John?" He called again, already not liking this. "John, where are you?"
Suddenly, Effie stopped and her face became very serious. She bit at her lip before giving him a smile. This wasn't a smirk, not a joking, evil grin, it was soft and honest, and if he wasn't looking, he would have missed the sadness that flashed in her eyes. "Because... I have a debt to pay."
sorry to have to have had to break the news to you in such a way, Dr. Watson, but... It was necessary." She said, her voice sounding strangely sincere and apologetic.
"She's alive." John gasped, gazing up at Sherlock. His eyes were the size of saucers, and his jaw was nearly touching the floor. "She's
Dana shrugged. "Maybe so, but I'm still going to see them. Did I tell you he wiped my record?" She asked with a grin.
"Wasn't a hate crime." Sherlock's face twisted up with pride as it always did when things like this happened. He loved being the smartest one in the room. "Quite the opposite actually, the driver of the car was drunk, she wasn't paying attention and she hit the first girl. She realized what she had done, saw another girl who got hysterical, so the girl panics and hit her too. It was a simple case, like I said."
Eventually, he shook his head. "I don't know." He breathed exasperatedly. "Maybe it's because she got the better of me. Since Magnussen, I've made it a priority to never let that happen, and yet, it was happening all under my nose. All of this, Moriarty, Mary, Magnussen, it was all practically all one large riddle that everyone was in on, and it took me until this letter to figure it out. I should have known. I should have..."
Her vague answers were starting to get to him, and he gritted his teeth. "Why are you doing this? What do you want from me?"
He passed a hand over his face, and looked up toward the mantel where the letter still sat against Billy the Skull. After four months, he still hadn't read it. John never mentioned it, and neither did he. He had been actively avoiding that letter, though, it was days like this, right after a Skype call when the loneliness crept up from the walls and the floorboards of 221B Baker Street and engulfed him in. He hadn't been alone like this since before he met John Watson.
He thought, making his heart skip a beat. He pushed the door open and ran up the steps toward their room, his heart pounding. He pushed the door to their bedroom open, and stopped dead in his tracks.
"I'd say the best part is that after years of pining and definitely not talking like we should have from the beginning, I get to wake up every morning with the most beautiful, brilliant,
They were so involved in pushing through the code screens that they didn't even see the blinking red light from the motion sensor in the corner.
Then, he sees a familiar tattoo on the forearm of the person holding it, and while he dreads it, his eyes trail up as the figure enters the kitchen, and once again, like he had in many dreams, he is standing face to face with the man only known to him as The Tall One, who is currently pressing a gun into John Watson's back.
Dana Carlisle nodded, and reached out to squeeze his arm. "Just leave it all to me, boys. Soon enough, you'll be be living life in domestic bliss." She got to her feet and placed her sunglasses back over eyes, gave both of them a playful smirk. "You'll be hearing from me." And then, she walked out the front door, and was gone, leaving the two men alone.
The nurse, Emi, he remembers, lowers her hands, and smiles sweetly at him. "I am a fan. I used to follow the blog. I'd recognize your face anywhere. I knew you couldn't be dead."
Normally, the doctor would retaliate, but he only rolled his eyes. "I'm glad you're enjoying the cases." He told him, although in his mind, he wished he could be doing them with him.
John hung up the phone without another word. He looked around the room, and saw the detective's closet door cracked open ever so slightly. He reached out gingerly and pulled the knob back, opening it completely. Everything was just as it always was, except for a manila folder lying flat on the ground. With careful hands, he reached out and picked it up, only to find a note written on the folder in purple pen ink, another thing Sherlock Holmes would never use.
He ignored him. "Lestrade, you stay with Effie until the other ambulance arrives." He told the DI, who was still looking around in shock at what he was seeing.
Suddenly, from the table, John's phone begin to buzz and vibrate on the table with an incoming call, and Greg leaned down to pick it up. "Oh, leave it, it's probably Mary." John protested.
The man on the sofa sighed heavily. "Just take a step backwards for a minute, John," He tried. "What all do we know?"
Sherlock sucks in a sharp breath, while the rest of his body suddenly feels shocked full of electricity. "So, you mean... It's over?" He whispers, unable to believe it himself.
The Tall One laughs. "I should have never let you go." He raises the knife, and sends it plunging down into the detective's abdomen.
Alright, guys, this is it. I know this epilogue is short, but, I chose not to make it long. This was a lot of fun to write, I had a great time doing it, and I'm glad that everyone who read it enjoyed it.
He continued to look around, but with each passing second, the anxiety welled up from the pit of his stomach, and pulsed its' way through his blood stream. What if he was too late to save Sherlock? What if these monsters already killed him?
To his surprise, though, when their eyes locked, John's gaze was nothing sort of loving once again, and the doctor reached out and stroked his thumb over Sherlock's cheek, brushing any remaining wetness from before. "Sherlock, do you love me?"
There was a gruff sigh from Mycroft, which sounded a lot like he was trying not to snap at John. "Does he have his mobile phone?"
Without thanking her, Sherlock pushed away from the desk and turned to face a very bewildered John Watson. "I'm going back. I have to find Effie." He said through clinched teeth.
John's voice went back to being soft and husky like he knew that Sherlock always loved, and it made him look up.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, and waited for John to walk away. He knew it was coming, it was obvious. John would leave, now, he would leave and never come back.
He didn't seem to have a response for that, except for the small, but noticeable smile on his face. "I uh... I don't want to go back to my flat after this." He said simply.
The voice sounds panicked, and for moment, he swears he feels someone push against his shoulder, as if to roll him over.
John kept his face hard, but he felt his heart burning and blossoming with love and shame and anger all at once, and for a moment, it was all too much and he couldn't tear his eyes away. There was so much to say, but at the same time, there was nothing to say. He could say how he would have followed Sherlock to the ends of the Earth if he asked him to. He could say how he would have tied a lasso around the moon if Sherlock so desired it. He could say how the first time he heard Sherlock laugh, the first time he
John grabbed his collar and pulled him down for a kiss. It wasn't like any other kiss of John's, which were always warm, like he was cherishing Sherlock's very being and which made the detective's fragile heart want to burst. This kiss wasn't like that. This was like a regret. This was like an apology. This was John saying 'I love you, and I'm so sorry, and I need you to do this for me.' This was John saying goodbye.
"You're thirty two years old, you're from the Ukraine but you were raised in England. You used to work for Central Intelligence, but now you've gone freelance. You're a very experienced contract killer and spy, and you've just returned from a mission in Calcutta, judging by the fading tan lines." He answered in a single breath, not intending to stop. "You're unmarried, no children, no parents, and no siblings. I know if I were to lift up the left sleeve of your shirt you'd have a tattoo on your forearm. You're ambidextrous, but you primarily use your right hand with weapons, although you use your left when you write, I can see the remains of what looks like purple ink on your left hand, meaning your wrote something in a hurry with purple ink, and you didn't quite wash the ink off of your hand. You wear
John shook his head, his hand trembling over Sherlock's, so Sherlock turned his hand over and folded it around John's, hoping to give him some form of comfort. “Didn't matter how many days we had left, Sherlock. It still would have come to this.”
“It has its advantages,” Sherlock returned nonchalantly, though his insides were growing warm with the progression of their banter. That was another item on the long list of things he missed about his partner.
Mrs Hudson feigned outrage, giving Sherlock a little slap on the arm. “I’ll have you know a little marijuana would clear that little temper you have right up, young man.”
John waited with a patient smile, chest inexplicably tight as Sherlock stumbled through an explanation John didn’t feel he needed.
“Thank you, Lestrade, for fighting for me... you know,” John mumbled pathetically, waving his finger round, gesturing towards the house and the land, before using it to scratch behind his ear, awkwardly. He'd never been good at goodbyes.
Sherlock pulled John's arms carefully over John's head, wrapping the first coil of rope around his wrist in several revolutions, until they were bound tightly together. Sherlock finished with a quick, "Pull," to which John did, feeling only a slight give from where the length of rope connected to the bed in some indeterminable way. The rope was loose enough that there wasn't much strain on John's shoulders, it was tight enough that he couldn't move too much.
John couldn't pretend he wasn't pleased, not when he couldn't wipe the silly grin off his lips and get his heart to stop trying to escape his chest.
It wasn’t that he couldn’t stay away, it was that John was uniquely essential to his everyday living, to his breathing. Without breath, he would die, and John gave that to him. He breathed life into him even now, tiny little gasps that escaped his throat as they embraced one another. Everything John gave, Sherlock sucked it back into himself.
"You want me," Sherlock stated, as if it even needed to be said, but his tongue burned with the fact. "You want to strip me naked and bury yourself inside me. I can see it, the way you keep licking your lips compulsively." And, indeed, for the third time in five minutes, John's tongue was peeking out to run over dry lips that Sherlock wanted to taste.
Jasper closed the door, but didn't move from where he was, somewhat apprehensive. He avoided looking around. Every corner of the flat held a memory of John, now.
Holmes’ eyes were still shielded behind the reflective surface of his Chanel aviators, but John’s gaze was unwittingly drawn to the soft, full shape of Holmes’ mouth, the finely-crafted bow and plump, rosy petal of his upper and bottom lip. His cheeks were sculpted from ivory and his sharp, Grecian nose rounded off the aristocratic mien. Holmes could have been a proper actor with a face like that, but John was happy enough that they would be sharing a screen.
“Your face, John, are you alright? You look like you’ve been - I don’t know - rolling around in blankets or something.” Irene wrinkled her aristocratic little nose at him, and John fought with everything he had not to show how furious he was with her interruption. “Come on, let’s get you fixed up.”
Michael blushed in embarrassment, rushing to speak before the man could. “I dunno where my head is today. Pardon me.” He turned to Sherlock, who stood and unnecessarily ran a hand over the immaculate lines of his lapels. “This is Sherlock Holmes. We know each other from Bart’s.”
When Sherlock spoke it was with that disconcerting baritone, a sinuous timbre that was nothing short of exacting. "From this point forward you will not speak unless I give you permission to, and you will do exactly as I say, to the letter." His voice ripped through John like a current, and there was no way he could offer up an argument, though it spoke volumes that John was far from tempted to do so. "The only time I give you permission to speak freely is when you want me to stop. Don't be foolish and stay quiet if you feel overwhelmed. Of course, this is in the highly unlikely scenario that I won't have deduced it in my own."
Sherlock paused, his eyes narrowing slightly as they zeroed in on his bobbing throat. “John,” he breathed. “Can I-,” but John was already nodding his assent, because he couldn’t wait any longer. Then, Sherlock’s tall figure was blocking out everything else and his lips were pressing insistently against John’s.
"Uh-huh," John grunted a half-arsed acknowledgement. He hoped that Mike wasn't feeling chatty. "Sorry to hear that, mate, but... did you need anything in particular?" He enquired.
Lestrade stepped beside him and cleared his throat, commanding the attention of the others currently pinning John with stares of varying degrees. One man in particular, a fair haired gentleman, tall and poised on the edge of his seat appeared particularly unimpressed by the newcomer. He was seated adjacent to Sherlock, body angled towards the leader familiarly.
The man shoved through the heavy door on John's left and exited the church with a flurry of fabric. Then, John turned to his right, where the man had just emerged from. The confessional. It appeared just as intimidating as it had when John was younger. This one was built into the wall, and the doors had no gaps under them, so the space inside would be completely enclosed. The windows were covered with red curtains and prevented John from seeing the vicar, who hadn't yet left the confessional.
Sherlock straightened, his eyebrow rising in derision as John laughed at him. “Mr. Holmes is my brother,” he shouted loftily over the noise. “And it makes me feel old when you call me that.”
He sighed and slumped on the booth bench, not even sure where to start with this whole mess, but he was dying to talk to Sarah about it, in hopes that she may have some sort of light to shine on his very unusual situation with Holmes.
Sherlock snickered behind him, warm breaths caressing the nape of John's neck, and wrapped his arm around John's chest. "You did well on your first time with suspension bondage. Most don't take to it very well on the first go." Sherlock paused and pushed his nose into the blond head leaning against his shoulder. "You didn't even use your safe word."
John nodded, but failed to force his legs to move. Doing so would be visiting old memories, facing the death of his family, the people that he couldn't protect. The dearth of life where there was once a thriving pack -
Sherlock didn't turn to him, but answered nonetheless. “My brother has an estate in Sussex; that's a two-day journey from where we are now, allowing time for rests throughout the day.”
'Relax,' John mouthed to his lover, and Sherlock shifted, recrossing his legs in the opposite direction and pulled out his phone to tinker with. Oddly enough, his face had gone completely blank.
"Don't worry," Mike sniffled, "I've got all my questions ready. They're on the kitchen table, where I put them this morning.” He coughed. “If I miss this interview, Holmes will never agree to meet with me again!"
John stood and clutched the interview questions with both hands to stop them trembling. He followed the woman down a hall to a set of heavily polished wooden doors with large, chrome-plated handles.
Honestly, John had been asking himself the same thing. Sherlock was a man who prided himself on what he did for a living, enjoyed control and the pleasures of the flesh, but he was also incapable of relationships and even spending a night in the same bed with a lover.
"Our Sherlock seems quite fond of you, must be if he is bringing you here. He rarely ever brings anyone round, and never looks at them the way I've spotted him looking at you." She pauses briefly. "Just do me a favor and keep an eye on him. Victor and I used to, but then... things changed, so..." Ella sighed wistfully.
The Ukrainian looked up toward the stairs, then back to him. "If my calculations are correct, you're going to need this." She said, pushing the weapon into his hands. "Hopefully you won't have to use it, hopefully I'm wrong, but you might, and I don't want you to be unarmed." She took another Grach out of the backpack on the ground. She cocked the weapon, then approached Sherlock and put a hand on his arm, curling her fingers around his bicep. "Okay, look, I texted Mary and said you broke out of your restraints, and stole my gun, so, I need you to go out and hide somewhere close, but nowhere she'll see you."
Hello everyone! I'm sorry this chapter took so long to write up, I was visiting my fiancé who lives two hours away from me, and I wanted to spend time with him, since I don't see him often. I'm really sorry it took so long, and I really hope you guys understand.
And for some reason, his body pulled itself from the floor, and with tears threatening to fall, he began to back away, watching as John lay his head back down on the concrete, not even allowing Sherlock to see him cry. The detective turned and ran until he saw the exit, and he ran straight into the arms of Greg Lestrade, who was speaking to him, though his voice was muffled.
Jim let out a weak laugh. "I don't like her. She was flirting with you. But, I think she'll be a lovely addition to the underword."
"No!" He protested quickly. "No, I'd... I'd love you to come home. Both of you." Sherlock could have cried in that moment, just at the very idea of John finally, finally coming home after all of that time.
The doctor opened his eyes slowly, trying to ease the horrendous ache on the side of his head where he had been struck. It took him less than a minute to realize where he actually was. Suddenly, everything made sense; the warm air, the chemical smell... He'd recognize the setting of 221B Baker St. anywhere. His head snapped up and he ignored the pain, gazing around the room rapidly. He was alone, just like he guessed. He looked over his shoulder, and let out a sigh of relief. John was, like he assumed, tied down to a chair, but not like he originally thought. He wrists were tied, but not to the chair, around the chair. He could easily stand up and release himself. His feet weren't even tied down.
John leaned back against the bar stool. Lying to Sherlock was more impossible than lying to Mary. "I miss it sometimes." After seeing the look on his best friend's face, he sighed. "Alright, alright, I miss it a lot."
come in until I say so. If this Effie woman is telling the truth, this is dangerous, and your presence will get Sherlock killed if Mary knows you're there."
Mary's eyes flickered to the gun in his hand, and snickered. She seemed unafraid of him, but, she never had before. "You won't shoot me, Sherlock. You wouldn't do that to John." She murmured in a sugary sweet voice that made him want to retch.
The doctor shrugged, although he knew that it wasn't seen. "I have no clue. It doesn't make sense to me either. I know I have to have missed something, there's something about this that I'm not seeing, I just don't know what. Sherlock would be useful right now, but he's..." His voice trailed off, and He looked down at the floor.
John Watson was an loyal man. He was a loyal soldier, a loyal friend, and if there was one person to trust with a life, it was him. He was was selfless, and caring, and passionate, and he loved Sherlock Holmes beyond a reasonable doubt. But, in that moment, Sherlock almost wished he didn't. His eyes had lost the icy coldness, and had become soft and kind, and when he took Sherlock's hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it, he smiled. It made Sherlock sick.
Jim bristled, but Sebastian snickered. "Sounds dumb when you say it like that, doll, but, in retrospect, yes."
The soldier leaned forward, and, in one swift movement, pulled the chair Jim was sitting in forward, angling it so that they were facing one another. Jim still didn't look up. "I meant we need to talk about
"Sherlock, go!" The army doctor pushed Sherlock forward, and together, they both began to run away from the small room, knowing exactly what was coming next.
The Ukrainian shrugged casually. "Doesn't seem like him to be silent, does it?" She got up and paced in little circles in front of the chair. "See, even after the nasty divorce with her husband, Mary still worked for Jim for a long time. He hired her to
Jim laughed. "Right, of course, because Sherlock Holmes is going to sit in the same room as me and eat dinner. He'd shoot me under the table before I got to dessert."
The first time he has a nightmare, he doesn't realize that that's what it is. It's so vivid, and so real, but so utterly ridiculous that it had no reason to be as terrifying as it it.
John took a deep breath, shoulders shaking slightly at the mention of his ex-wife. "I... Thank you, Mycroft. I'm still wrapping my head around it." He offered a weak smile. "But, thank you."
The detective shook his head. "I'm not. He won't come after us anymore. Our family is safe, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, everyone is safe. That's enough for me."
"Nice to see you too." John replied as he gave his best friend a once over. He didn't seem to have changed too much since they saw each other last, his dark, bouncy curls sitting in ringlets on top of his head, although it was a bit longer than it was the last time they met up. He was as clean shaven as always, but Sherlock always had impeccable personal hygiene. He was still way too skinny, and John felt the urge to repeat his natural habit of asking him when the last time he ate was, but he didn't want to ruin the moment. It wasn't that important right now. "How've you been?"
John's arms tightened around him. "I'll even come home tonight, if you want, but I need you to promise me something." His voice had suddenly gone grave, not like the way it was before.
long, and I'm tired of having things go unspoken between us. I love you, and if that's the last thing I ever say on this planet, so be it."
"No, John-" Sherlock surges forward to reach for him, but stops halfway. He has no right to touch John. He pulls away, and stares awkwardly at the floor instead. "John, I'm so sorry for what I did, but believe me when I say that there was no other way for me-"
About an hour later, the four were sitting out on the large balcony, eating the amazing meal Sebastian had prepared and just chatting. It was a horribly domestic moment, but, it was nice. Irene was gushing over the trip to New York that she and Dana had just taken while trying to convince Jim to go at least once to shop, while Seb tried to shut her up 'because Jim doesn't need any more cloths', which of course, made them all laugh.
"Better." John pressed a quick kiss to his lips, and hurried off toward their bedroom to take care of their daughter.
Sherlock did as he was told, and ran quickly to the pipe fixtures by the wall, and hid behind them. It wasn't a very good hiding place, but the shadows hid him well, and it was only temporary. He looked between the fixtures and watched with a perfect view as Effie kept her gun drawn, and her back near the wall, ready to fire when needed. Her face was a perfect mask of well contained fury, and Sherlock was almost impressed.
Mary's expression changed from confusion to shock. She didn't seem to understand what she was hearing. "Are you..."
He never expected that. Sherlock always expected that he would be the one to say it first, stutter it out at a really inappropriate time, probably at a crime scene or somewhere else where he would embarrass John, but... John had said it first. In front of Lestrade too.
They stand like that for a while, standing in each other's arms, until a sharp knock at the door forcibly breaks them apart, and Sherlock grumbles at the loss. John chuckles and runs his thumb down his cheek once again. "Go put the kettle on, love, I bet it's Mrs. H wanting to know what all the noise is."
Mary's eyes widened, and she stepped back, nearly stumbling over her own feet in shock. Her eyes flickered between the Ukrainian and her intended target, horrified by the sudden change. The gun wavered as her hand began to shake. "Effie!" She gasped, painfully. "What are you... How could you..." She stuttered, unable to get out a coherent sentence. "I... I
Sherlock Holmes!" She roared in a sing-song voice that echoed off of the walls. "This isn't about you, this isn't about your brother, this isn't about Charles fucking Magnussen." She paused, letting her arms fall to her sides as a smile pulled at her lips. "This is about John."
The detective nodded. "Double homicide. Two women were run over multiple times in a parking garage. They had nothing in common, so the motive was unclear, so naturally, Lestrade called me in, despite how obvious everything was. I finished the case in a few hours." He answered.
Mary Watson went into emergency surgery when they arrived at the hospital. Her wounds were severe, and she had lost enough blood already. They had two choices, either patch up the bullet wounds and save Mary, or save the baby via C-Section and lose Mary. In the end, they attempted both, patching up the bullet wounds as best they could until they could do further surgery, while in the meantime, they performed the Caesarean section to save the baby.
The smoke was thick, and the blaze was hot, but the detective crawled to his feet, and covered his mouth so that he wouldn't breathe in too much. "John!" He shouted, his voice already rough from the smoke.
Effie gave him a look. "Bisexuality exists, you know. I know for a fact that he waves that damn flag up high, and you can't even argue with me. John is head over heals in love with you, and the
Emi nods. "Sure, if you're feeling up to it. I just have to clear it with the doctor, but he always listens to me."
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and turned on his heal, locking his eyes with John's. He hoped then, then more than any other time in their lives, that John would listen to him. It was more important then than any other time. "Three lives, John. She's saving three lives." Then, before waiting for an answer, he took the doctor's hand and pulled him along, then helped him into the ambulance. John didn't look at Mary at all.
Across town, a figure dressed in a full body black suit, wearing a hockey mask and cradling a gun in their hand, scaled the side of Shad Sanderson Bank, and with a quick flick of the wrist, opened the window and slipped quietly inside. They knew the ins and outs of the building, from the cameras to the heat sensors, as they had spent two weeks on the building's outline and blueprints.
Sherlock considers this. He didn't realize he had walked that far. It hadn't seemed like five miles. Then, something else clicks. "How
Sherlock's stomach growls, breaking the moment, and they pull away from each other. John looks up at him then nods his head toward the door. "Come on, pretty boy. Time for breakfast."
There was a pause and the sound of shuffling in the background before Sherlock spoke again. "Is everything alright?"
"No, of course not." Emi says, making him feel silly for worrying. "Your secret is safe with me, Mr. Holmes, don't you fret."
Sherlock looked down at the envelope that was still gripped on his hand, analyzing it again. It was heavy, obviously expensive paper, with no return address, like she had said, although it was addressed to both John and Sherlock in purple ink. John had recognized the handwriting before Sherlock had time to look at the letter properly.
His brother smiles at him from his place in the chair. "Yes, Sherlock. It's over. As soon as you're well enough, you're going home."
Sherlock would never say a word of this to his best friend's face, but he hated his married life just as much as John did. He didn't want to believe Mrs. Hudson when she said marriage changed people, but it did. It changed everything between them. They were still very close, but now they were apart all of the time. But, Sherlock would never dare say anything. He wouldn't hurt John like that, and of course, she had been the one to pick up the pieces when he was pretending to be dead. There was a time, a long time ago now, that both men thought John would come home to Baker St., and everything would be perfect again, but then came Magnussen, and Sherlock killed him to save Mary. John went away after that, after the Moriarty case went cold, and all Sherlock could do was smile. He would never purposely make him choose between them when John had clearly already chosen.
John hesitates as he ponders the question. He knows why, he's thought about it almost every day since he decided to stop dating men, but putting it into words for someone else,
Sherlock quickly grabs his arm. "I'm serious, John." He retorts, ignoring the weak glare that the doctor shoots his way. "Besides, I'm thirty eight, you're forty two, we're not very far apart."
Seeing his brother's confusion, Mycroft nods. "The extent of your injuries were to great to be dealt with without the aid of a chemically induced coma. You woke up, once, and we thought you were fine, but then you... Panicked, I suppose, and they had to put you under again. I had been trying to get you to wake up before."
"Sir! Are you alright? You're bleeding!" Sally Donovan, who had caught up in one of the cars, shouted in his direction as she ran forward to meet him.
Sherlock felt sick. When Mary shot him, the betrayal almost killed him. Then the fear afterwards in the hospital when she threatened him. Although he wasn't afraid for himself, he was afraid for John, but it still hurt. Everything he had done to keep John safe and happy and yet his wife turned out to be an assassin, and she shot him. Sherlock thought that they were past this, he thought it didn't matter anymore, but... Now, here he was. He felt dead all over again. He hung his head, trying to push the terrible, painful memories out of his head. "So, Mary hired you to kill me."
