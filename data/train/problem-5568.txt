“What?”
Tony steps toward the open glass doors, ready to announce his arrival. The happy-swooping feeling of finding and seeing Steve short circuits when Tony gets close enough to take in the whole of the scene and realizes someone else out there with him.
Tony looks up from his work and waves his free hand, the one that isn’t wrist-deep in what looks remarkably like a prosthetic arm. He makes a ‘cut it off’ motion to his neck before taking the pliers out of his mouth while FRIDAY lowers the rock music to a dull background hum.
Tony’s breath leaves him all at once. He hates how wet it sounds, shuddering on the way out and hanging in the empty air between their bodies. Steve cares
Steve stands up and steps forward a handful of paces until he’s barely two feet from Tony. He’s still warm from sparring, his shirt clinging to his back even as the front dries to a smudgy grey. He’s plenty nervous, yes, but Tony can barely look him in the eye. Tony’s hands fidget wildly with his cuffs, his tie, the second button on his two-button jacket, and he looks literally anywhere
“No. Just me,” he says, looking at the floor. “It’s not a big deal.”
, right there in the kitchen at half past three o’ clock in the morning.
Rocket and Thor had conveniently forgotten to mention
Seconds away from getting what he’s always wanted, Tony stops Steve with a hand to the chest. Ever the gentleman, Steve goes perfectly still, head bent forward, waiting for Tony’s next move. Word. Whatever it is—Tony’s still working that one out. In the meantime, Tony counts Steve’s absurdly long eyelashes, can almost see his own harried expression reflected in the deep black of Steve’s dilated pupils.
Steve sighs for the millionth time and gives Tony a look. It must need work, because Tony just shoots it back at him tenfold.
“It’s ancient history,” Tony replies, maintaining eye contact through sheer willpower when all he wants to do is look at Steve’s mouth, now so close to his.
instead Steve's here, lying in on a rainy Sunday morning, with Tony, watching him sleep, watching him wake up, greeting him with a sleepy smile and a kiss on the forehead and a "good morning, sweetheart" in that gorgeous sleep-roughened voice of his and—
, leaning into Steve’s steady hand for support. Steve can feel Tony’s laugh as much as he can hear it: it feels like home and sounds like rock music and looks like sunlight spilling out between his fingers, bright blue.
“Gotta admit, you’re doing wonders for my ego right now.” Tony’s low, wry voice brings Steve back to the present. The present, Steve thinks, is warm and close and very,
And then he made Bucky, who hadn’t cracked more than a smirk in the months since his rescue and rehabilitation despite Steve and even Sam’s best efforts,
, like the past six weeks have done exactly what Tony dreaded and hoped they’d do when he broke up with him, like Steve’s had time to finally breathe freely, spread his wings a bit, experience the world in ways he never got to with Tony when they were together.
“Uh-huh.” Planting herself next to him, Natasha prods Steve’s shoulder with a bare toe. “How many times do you think he’s texted you since we started sparring?”
,” Steve sighs, tension draining from him like water. Tony brushes a hand down the front of his chest—Steve catches it right over his sternum and presses it there. “Is there anything about this, about
, such a beautiful, eager hole for Steve to fill. And he does, over and over again, hot and huge and so goddamn
And then there’s the rest of him—Steve, standing there waiting for Tony to react, a shit-eating grin on his face if Tony ever saw one, and Tony has seen Steve’s shit-eating grin so many times over the years, but never with this heady undercurrent of promise. He’s massive even out of the suit, tall and broad, but graceful, gentle as he climbs back onto the bed and reaches for Tony; even as he watches Steve move, all that muscle and strength, he can clearly see the guy Steve used to be—that bony, sickly kid who picked every battle that was worth fighting, even if it was the neighborhood bully for stealing the neighbor’s milk money.
, Tony realizes, hands abandoning Steve’s gorgeous cock to scrabble at his big, meaty shoulders and hold on for dear life as Steve pumps those two thick,
Steve reaches up with the hand he’s not using to play with Tony’s sweet, sloppy asshole to turn his face in for another breathtaking kiss, fingers gentle against Tony’s cheek as Steve licks him open, kisses him deep and thorough and hard until Tony’s lips are tingling tender and slick with Steve’s spit. He stays soft against Tony’s thigh as he kisses him, seeming to enjoy this on its own merits, Tony’s soft, panting breaths against his mouth, the quivering, messy center of him on and around Steve’s delicate, searching fingers as he pushes his come back into Tony and keeps it there, plugging Tony’s hole with the heel of his palm for a minute while he kisses every last coherent thought out of Tony’s head. Then Steve lets go, kisses Tony deep, fucking his mouth with his tongue as Steve’s come dribbles out endlessly over the backs of Tony’s thighs and pools between them on the mattress. Steve leans back to look and groans.
“All good then,” Tony chuckles, but he won’t look Steve in the eye anymore. He picks up his fork and starts to tuck in, chewing so fast it’s like he’s racing toward a finish line Steve can’t see and doesn’t know how to keep from approaching, except—
Bulldozer roars and backs away, tears streaming as he tries to see his way past the fiery sparks.
“Yeah, you did,” Steve answers, smiling at Tony as warmly and happily as he feels. This isn’t a real date, but he’s still having a fantastic dinner with his best friend and crush, so it’s a fun, memorable night for him either way. Steve dishes a heaping spoonful of rich, glossy pasta onto Tony’s plate first, too preoccupied to notice Tony glancing at his mouth before he takes another drink of light red wine (the price of which Duncan didn’t mention and at this point Steve doesn’t want to know).
“Watch me.”

Because that’s his whole
“Pepper’s going to kill me when I get back,” Tony sighs, looking at his watch. The words sound as if they’re coming from far away, like Tony is still in that pocket dimension, somewhere else. Somewhere not here, with Steve, who wants him. Here. With him.
Steve smiles again, bigger this time, and leans forward to kiss Tony properly, palming the small of his back but not pulling him in any closer. Tony is so greedy, so eager and weak, he takes Steve’s kiss without a second’s hesitation, rolling into it with a moan that’s been caught in his throat since Steve left the bed to—
He dials into the Avengers main comm line as he scans each building for heat signatures. “Cap, pick up.”
Steve chuckles. He pats Tony on the shoulder as he walks by, wanting to get out of Tony’s immediate vicinity before indulging himself in ways that may or may not involve some very
, and shakes his head.
. Tony knows that move because he’s imagined doing the exact same thing to Steve, god,
but Steve certainly wasn’t expecting this much archness wrapped up in sunflower yellow.
“Aren’t you supposed to be somewhere else right now?” Steve asks, stepping around the edge of the door. Seeing him reach a hand out, Tony turns his just so to allow their fingers to connect and weave together. Easy. They walk away hand-in-hand down the hall toward the staircase at their own pace. It feels like they’ve been doing this forever.

He banks hard around a corner when he hears Steve curse, gauntlets up so he can see: Piledriver at Steve’s back with an arm around his neck, and even against Steve’s considerable size the guy looms large, threatening the choke the life out of Steve with a smile on his face.
He’s not wearing the armor, but he might as well be for how heavy he feels all of a sudden, fatigue calcifying the marrow in his bones. Tony’s knees start to give. Exhausted by a working day spent at SI, an evening spent kowtowing with people he’d sooner jettison off the tower than invite in, and now thoroughly beaten back into his sad little corner of unrequited love, Tony shakes his head, wobbling slightly when he pushes himself away from the island. He sets his eyes on the still-open doorway and definitely not on Steve, who stays perfectly still while Tony shuffles past him.
Tony drops his sleeve and leaves the bar empty handed. He’d meant to order a scotch, but he’s too preoccupied wondering where Steve’s gone to bother going back for it. It’s not important, anyways. Given the choice between Steve and alcohol, Tony would choose Steve every time.
The smirk becomes a full-blown grin. Steve squeezes his other arm around Tony’s lower back and hums, deep and resonant, in his chest as he leans down to brush his lips feather-softly against Tony’s.
“What—what is this,” he gasps against Steve’s lips when the other man pulls away to let him breathe. Steve moves a hand under Tony’s ass, clasping a handful and squeezing,
“There’s plenty of daylight,” Steve replies, thrusting an elbow out and up towards Natasha’s briefly exposed diaphragm, a little Muay Thai move she showed him the other day. She blocks it easily and uses his momentum against him, dropping him to the mat in a blur of wrapped hands and red hair.
“What did I tell you,” Tony says when Steve moans softly again. This time, he doesn’t miss the way Tony stares lingeringly at his mouth like he wants another taste. “
“Welcome back!” Steve says with a bright smile, wiping sweat from his brow with an end of the towel hanging around his neck. “How was California?”
, but that’s not what they’re discussing right now. Pushing his misplaced feelings aside as has become the norm recently, Steve watches Tony—bruised and tired and favoring his left side following their latest battle against Doom—stand up and disappear FRIDAY’s projection of the image with a flick of his wrist.
“Turn it off! I said

Everything is so slick with come and lube already, Tony is surprised Steve doesn’t just slip right in, easy and deep, but Steve still takes a moment to retrieve the bottle of lube that had rolled away somewhere over by the pillows earlier. He pops the thing open with a

Steve’s thoughts go silent so fast his head spins. “I’m sorry?”
, as much as any smile could. It dissolves something in Tony that his nerves had calcified, something elemental; he feels lighter in its absence.
. Tony applies pressure, pulls away, applies it again; tilts his head left and does it again, a soft rasp of lips, and Steve is left gasping for his return every time. He knows he should show mercy to Tony’s suit jacket, but as long as Tony insists on keeping it on, he’s going to hold onto him with it. God, it feels like his skin is the only thing keeping him contained when Tony presses another kiss to his bottom lip, tasting it ever-so-sneakily with his tongue before pulling away.
“Tony…”
Tony’s first thought is quite tame, he’ll remember later. He thinks, wryly, that Steve is just making sure Tony goes to bed instead of going to the workshop. That he’ll order Tony under the covers and wait until he starts snoring to leave. Because Steve is a bossy mother hen, and this week has been rough on all of them, to say nothing of the past year. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“Feel so good inside, Tony, God…”
Tony husks a laugh. When the coughing subsides and the ice chips ease a path down his throat, he says, “I’ll probably always have them. The press is awful and it’ll only get worse. Just means I’ll need you to reassure me more often.”
Steve likes how tight he is. He likes his noises. He touches Tony so carefully even as he talks the dirtiest stuff Tony’s ever heard, keeps himself steady so Tony can writhe away, further down onto his hot, hard, girthy cock until Tony can feel the thick base of him push past the traitorous ring of muscle and
This time, he manages to keep all that to himself. Instead, Tony cracks a little smile and says, “Good. That’s...that’s good.”
, this is

He swallows the raw, unholy sound and he weeps instead, like he’s never wept before—not for Bucky, or Peggy, or the Commandos, or Natasha, or Sam, or anyone—and then he falls to his knees in the ash and mud, everything that’s left of Tony’s last act of defiance.
“Alright, Piledriver. You let Captain America and Falcon go, you can have me. Deal?”
, Steve. I can’t—the fact that you’re getting a second erection out of me is a miracle, I need—”
definitely
“Tony,” he whispers, just loud enough for the other man to hear. When Tony looks back at him, there are no barriers—no sunglasses, no masks, no playing pretend. Steve’s heart stutters in his chest to see himself reflected in Tony’s warm, brown eyes. He thinks he might want to stay there. He knows that’s what it feels like for him—he’d look at Tony all day, every day, if he could.
Steve will just have to dance with Tony, instead. What a hardship.
seeing what’s about to happen, let alone the rest of the team.
Steve tears his eyes away from Tony (who should really work the sweaty-and-disheveled-mechanic look more often) to take in the others in the room with him. It’s a panorama of people, and the first thing Steve notices, besides their more obvious differences, is how comfortable they all are with each other, to the point that walking in on this moment feels invasive, almost
Tony pauses, his big, brown eyes widening slightly in surprise. “Kind of? It is a very nice suit,” he says, and Steve has to force himself not to follow the hand Tony runs absentmindedly down the front of his expensive jacket with his eyes.

But before Tony can lift a finger, Steve is on him,

“Why?”
“Look alive, soldier,” he barks. Rogers coughs and splutters and springs to his feet like something stung him right on the ass. As soon as he registers Steve, his copy, standing in front of him, he falls back on his heels into a fighting stance. It’s wobbly around the knees, but Steve doesn’t bother correcting his stance. This isn’t what he’s come to do.

Tony hugs him close and loses himself in it, the wet, rhythmic slap of Steve’s balls against his ass, the scorching puff of Steve’s breath against his ear, the burning sensation of Steve’s eyes on him from his place by Tony’s head. When Steve cards his fingers through Tony’s hair and pulls, Tony wails, and he

If Tony had sunglasses nearby, he’d have put them on by now.

“I’m an engineer.”

Tony looks up and sees Steve standing where the projector once was, cradling his bleeding hand. The man looks stricken, pale and horrified, worse than if he’d seen a ghost; behind him, the team has inched closer, all of them wearing varying expressions of distress and pity and guilt and sadness, and suddenly Tony can’t bolt out of his chair fast enough. He can’t get away fast enough. He follows his feet out of the room into the corridor and down, down, down to the workshop where it’s safe, where

, balls deep, dripping with come and lube and holding oh so perfectly still while he waits for Tony to acclimate.
Steve is slow to answer. When he does, a minute or so later—the longest of Tony’s life, he’s pretty sure—it’s with a gentle hand against Tony’s sternum, below the arc reactor, nothing but the barest touch of fingertips to naked skin. Tony shivers, his cock twitching even at that chaste touch. He looks up at Steve from his place on the bed and shivers harder, thighs dropping open ever so slightly, on instinct, at the voracious expression on Steve’s handsome face, the slick shine of his own saliva all over his lips and nose and chin.
He turns around as the door clicks shut. Steve stands there with a hand on the knob, staring at it like it holds all the answers to every question he could ever hope to ask. His jaw is tight; for all that Steve looks impeccably put together right now (Tony has to stop his eyes from repeatedly dropping to look at Steve’s ass in those slacks), his energy is all over the place. Not nervous, not anymore, but…wary. Gun-shy. If it were anyone other than Steve Rogers, Tony would call that full-body tension
“I have my ways, Cap. Do not doubt my ways.”
Tony picks up one of Steve’s hands and starts unwrapping the bandages from his bout with Natasha, over and under and between the knuckles and back again like a dance.
Tony huffs a laugh, shaking his bowed head like Steve just told a bad joke. “What brought this on, all of a sudden? I mean if you’re touch-starved, Thor is always good for a bear hug.”
“If you say so,” he replies. Sarcastic, because of who he is as a person, but deep down Tony

Clint’s still in the living room, bitching about picking up after everyone else even though he’s got actual kids to deal with, but Tony doesn’t really have the capacity to talk to or think about Clint right now. He notices Steve’s hand is hanging in the air between them, trying to bridge the gap, but he’s too far away. Steve notices Tony noticing.
Tony finishes his meeting with the clean energy consultant—an engaging, exciting discussion about bringing arc reactor tech and associated jobs to underserved communities in the mid-west and Appalachia, for starters—just in time for a text from Rhodey:
laughing when Tony picks up the phone at the end of the movie and calls Matt Damon and tells him to text him next time, "I'll come pick you up, just stop getting lost in fucking space, asshole!")

, like
Before long, the frantic kissing ebbs into something more like their first: Steve lowers Tony to stand and cradles his jaw in his hands, nudging their noses together before brushing one gentle kiss against Tony’s lips after another. Slick and wet and hurried gives way to softer, slower, warmer; both of them are panting but neither he nor Steve seem to be able to stop kissing long enough to let air through. It’s too early to say things like

magic.
“I’m here, sweetheart. I’m here.” Steve urges him to eat some of the ice chips with gentle nudges of the cup against his mouth. Tony obliges him, because of course he does. The water soothes his sore throat and clears the fog from his brain a little, enough to get a better sense of his surroundings.
It’s the easiest thing Tony’s ever done, walking the six steps across the bathroom floor and placing a hand over Steve’s on the doorknob.
They watched that one together. Just him and Tony, early on, when things were still good. Tense, maybe—brittle, but good. Before Steve knew about Bucky, or HYDRA, or Tony’s parents; before Steve realized he did in fact know how to lie, but only when it came to Tony Stark. They’d drank good beer and talked gingerly around the subject of Steve’s adjustment to the 21st century; Steve couldn’t help but think of Tony when Indiana shot the swordsman, remembering what Tony had said on the helicarrier with startling clarity, the opposite of how he’d been thinking in the moment:
It started small, as these things do: a flutter of excitement whenever Tony’s name appeared on his phone on a text or incoming call, usually while Tony was still in flight between the city and the compound (“

Steve turns off the TV with a sigh. “It’s been playing nonstop for almost twenty-four hours,” he says. He won’t look Tony in the eye. “I’m sorry.”
“Why,” Steve blurts out, stopping Tony mid-chew, “were you hoping I did?”
The four are all of remarkably different builds and backgrounds, not a similarity between them: an African American man, no taller than Steve was before the serum, sits on the couch; a white man, thin as a rake and twice as tall, is reaching for a glass of water on the coffee table; an Asian American man, whose shoulders are somehow even broader than Steve’s, stands rigidly next to Tony, arms folded across his chest; and the lone woman, whose glossy black hair is wound tightly in a bun at the back of her head. Steve notes the beautifully elaborate

“Don’t you dare,” Steve husks before diving in for another kiss that knocks the air right out of Tony’s lungs. And that’s great, that’s—
, it’s so easy to laugh with Tony. The man is hilarious, sure, but little things like that—things that only Tony would think to ask Steve because they know each other so well and he likes making fun of Steve’s idiosyncrasies, likes making Steve loosen up and laugh at himself—make Steve feel like the champagne he drank earlier: bubbly, light,

, but this time, Steve beats him to the panel.
“No?” Tony responds, hoping his voice doesn’t betray the terrified thrill that goes through him at Steve’s words. In a second it doesn’t even matter anymore, though, because Steve’s got a hand on the back of Tony’s neck and is pressing him down, face first into the duvet, and lifting his hips up with the other, brushing burning kisses down the length of his spine as he does so. Hysterically Tony thinks Steve can’t possibly be planning what Tony thinks—hopes—he is. He’s gross, hasn’t showered in a couple days, but that doesn’t seem to be stopping Steve, who’s spreading Tony’s ass with one hand and licking a hot, wet stripe up from Tony’s balls to his clenching, empty hole, groaning like
He doesn’t have to raise his voice for Tony to hear him. He doesn’t even

A depraved little voice in Steve’s head wonders if Tony’s going to bind his wrists with that blood red tie.
Tony groans, bussing his lips against the sheets. “S’fine,” he slurs, senseless.
Steve wrenches the black silk knot loose and pulls the whole thing off. It goes on the bed, along with the jacket. He unbuttons his shirt to the clavicle and rolls up the sleeves. (Tony has visibly admired his forearms enough times for Steve to make a deliberate habit of it.)

No one except Steve, apparently.

thing and just having Steve in his arms like this again, it’s hard to complain about the sting for long.
“Wha—?”
“I’ll get plenty of rest on the other side of this,” he says. “Just need to ride out the itch first.”
Tony glances back at Steve—the little smile on his lips could break Steve’s heart if he let it.
“Be right down,” he says, and in less than three minutes Tony Stark is strolling out through the front doors wearing bright red sunglasses paired with the shirt, belt, and trousers from the suit he wore to dinner last night. He dives straight into the melee, all flashy smiles and smart one-liners, saying
He has more good days than not, which, for an alcoholic, are pretty decent odds all things considered. It used to be the other way around, and that wasn’t good for anyone. Especially the Avengers—new, old, or future.

the thought.”
The dissonance doesn’t make sense. But it does put hope in Steve’s heart where there wasn’t any before.

“You don’t have to do that,” Steve says, and
look dead on his (adorable, bare) feet…

Something irksome crawls under Steve’s skin.
“You like that?” Steve asks him, pressing his come-soaked fingers in deep, so deep Tony knows he’ll never forget the feeling. “Like having my come inside you?” He gasps wetly and nods, screwing his eyes shut so Steve can’t see the dazed, love-sick look he can barely hold back anymore. “Yeah, you do. You love it. Love being marked,” Steve says, pressing hot, branding kisses to Tony’s cheek, his neck, his chest as he fucks his come into Tony’s soft, open hole, brushing his thumb against his slick rim every now and then as if for emphasis. “You liked it when I spanked you, too, didn’t you. You’re so good, you’ll take anything I give you.”
He’s staring. At Tony’s chest. He knows he is, but there’s no helping it. Just like there’s no helping the way he reaches out and pulls Tony into a hug like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do. It wasn’t long ago he’d carried this same body, suit and all, off the battlefield, crying himself hoarse even as he laid Tony out on a patch of grass in the sun away from the smoke and desolation. He’d watched this man die not seventy-two hours ago, and here was Tony, in his arms the way Steve should have held him years and years and

Its parts and pieces tick and move together in perfect synchrony, twin tourbillons keeping to the rhythm of 4:4 time. Skeletonized, they call this design, because among the many intricate moving pieces one can see straight through to the beating heart of the thing.

Bucky is alive. You can save him.
“You really don’t have to keep doing this,” Tony mutters, closing his eyes. “It’s late.” He hears the soft brush of Steve’s sweats and bare feet on warmed tile. When Steve speaks again, he’s only an arm’s length away.
Tony’s throat clicks wordlessly. Sensing his distress, Steve brushes Tony’s mouth gently with his thumb and bumps their noses together with a playful nudge, offering up a small, private smile that’s all Tony’s.
“That I do,” Tony says, easy as anything, as breathing, trusts Steve to keep him balanced and leans forward.
Steve’s cock slip in impossibly deeper, his stomach dragging against Tony’s dick on every powerful driving thrust.
The good news is, he and Sam aren’t dating. So.
“Hey! Sorry, I tried to keep it to the lab, but these guys wanted to see where the Avengers hang out, and I couldn’t say no.”
“I was planning on holding out a little longer and make love to you properly, but you had to play keep away for a whole week,” he says with a hard thrust that rattles the door. Those chinos aren’t exactly dense, and Steve, apparently, decided against underwear today—even through his jeans Tony can feel the hot swell of the head of Steve’s dick as it bumps and drags against the length of his. Tony muffles a cry against the black cotton of Steve’s T-shirt, biting down and relishing the incredible, gut-churning

“Maybe you’re right,” Steve replies. Bracing his hands on his knees, he says: “So if you’re not doing something because you think Captain America wouldn’t like it, what about run-of-the-mill Steve Rogers?”
“Because—

The scene is typical for Avengers work: rubble, some smoke, a few busted Doom Bots in pieces on the ground. They’d managed to keep the damage nominal and localized, thanks in part to Tony corralling the bots to the North Lawn. But keeping a tight perimeter meant they’d all been at a higher risk of getting hit, and Iron Man had been hit hard. And when Iron Man goes down, he goes down harder than almost anyone on the team.
Tony is gone before JARVIS can remind him that it’s ten minutes to speech-time. He bolts for the stairs—lushly carpeted for the evening in dark blue, the color of Steve’s eyes on a rainy day—and takes them two at a time, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth the whole way up. It pulls him like a hook on the end of a line, this need—to see Steve, to feel him, to know that it wasn’t all a dream. It pulls and pulls until Tony is loping down the exposed corridor overlooking the ballroom below, glancing at every balcony doorway en route just in case.
“Maybe so.”
glad they’re already in the tower and can go straight up to Tony’s floor on the private elevator after this, because he’s not going to be very presentable in about five minutes, judging by the way Tony is mouthing desperately at Steve’s neck as he undoes his belt buckle and fly before sinking down with a lascivious grin to kneel at Steve’s feet.
In their wake, Steve’s ears are buzzing, and he realizes with a jolt that he’s now alone. With Tony.
it would take Tony to get with the program—that program being Steve Rogers, and Steve's feelings for him, and the fact that when Steve says "I love you, Tony," he actually means it. because honestly, on what planet?
“And you liked it,” Nat smiles. “Seems I didn’t get as good a read as I thought, though. Once I realized Tony couldn’t go anywhere without you or your eyes following him, I couldn’t un-see it. Kind of surprised he hasn’t caught on.”
By 6:20, the back room is filled and noisy with other dinner guests, many of whom are also on dates and are doing a
He looks relaxed and happy in all the ways he never was with Tony.
except this particular morning, for some reason. because when he wakes up, Steve is already awake, which is par for the course—he's usually gone on a run, come home, showered, and made coffee by the time Tony has barely managed to crack an eye open—but he's just. in bed, lying on his side stretched out next to Tony, in a t-shirt and boxers (tragic), deep pillow lines on his face; he's got one of Tony's loose curls twirled around a finger, and usually Tony gets nervous when people watch him sleep, but with Steve he just feels safe, and protected, and—loved. Loved? Is that what it is? Is that was

Miserably. Gladly. Jury’s out.

Leaning forward to kiss Tony is the shortest distance Steve’s ever had to travel to feel a sense of belonging. Soft and careful, Steve brushes their lips together once, twice, and when Tony’s mouth parts, he moves in a third time and stays there, kissing Tony until the tension rushes out of him with a sigh that Steve swallows without a second thought.
They’ve known each other long enough, been in enough battles together, played enough Mario Kart together, that Tony doesn’t even register Steve cursing. He’s too caught up in that blush, and the push and pull of Steve’s muscles under his T-shirt, and all the other words coming out of Steve’s mouth.

So he forgives himself for forgetting, in his not-so-subtle idolization of Captain America, that Steve Rogers has also been around the block a few times since he got de-thawed. Which is why Tony squeaks a little when Steve uses that firm, unyielding grip he’s got on Tony’s body to press him up against him,
“Mr. Stark was about to come looking for you,” comes the serene reply. “I’m sure he’ll be pleased not to have to make the trip.”
like it’s everything and nothing all at once—the simplest, most obvious answer to a question that didn’t even need to be asked. An absolute, indisputable fact.
Resolved, thrilled, terrified, and painfully needy, Tony does what he always does in these situations, Steve Rogers notwithstanding: he moves to take the lead, because while Steve’s words are still ringing all of the bells in Tony’s animal brain—
a command, and Tony tells himself that that doesn’t do anything for him—“when you used to drink. What were you looking for, at the bottom of the bottle?”
Tony doesn’t know this woman. Going by the wary skepticism in his voice, neither does Steve. But unlike Tony, who (mostly) knows how to duck out of conversations he doesn’t want to have with people he doesn’t like (last week’s interaction with Justin Hammer notwithstanding), Steve is polite to a fault. Tony listens from his hiding place behind the door (because this is who he is now, apparently) as Steve hums.
“Tell me something, Tony,” Steve says—and it’s not a command, but it’s not
Steve muffles his hitching breaths against Tony’s shoulder, trying desperately to compose himself even as he falls apart. He’s failing, but can’t bring himself to care. Tony returns his embrace haltingly, like he can’t believe it’s happening, but then neither can Steve.
Which means no one knows they broke up six weeks ago.

“Just stressed out,” Tony replies. “You know how it is.

Steve knows this is selfish and reckless and his staying here could break the fabric of reality itself, but he would choose this—he’d choose Tony, warm and alive and smiling at him—every time. There are battles to be fought and truths to be told and lives to save, and he may never get to have Tony in all the ways he wants him in this or any timeline, but he’s willing to wing it and see.
Steve’s thoughts grind to a halt.

“It happens,” he says, genuine sympathy (but mercifully no pity) writ large across his middle-aged face. “In any case, you probably dodged a bullet. Want something a little stronger?”
It’s Steve’s nature to care. Tony can be cruel when he’s in pain, he knows, but even he’s not so cruel as to tell the man in front of him he doesn’t care
“Uh. Maybe?” At Steve’s look, Tony bites his lip and sighs. “Fine. Yeah, I am. Can you blame me? The thought of Sputnik wandering around the tower with that Cold War-era paperweight hanging off him when I’ve got brand-spanking-new, finely-tuned StarkTech all but ready to go? Perish, Steve,

, even after all this time, after everything they’ve been through, he still manages to sound so goddamn earnest, like everything Tony does for him is an unnecessary expenditure of Tony’s invaluable time and effort and not what Tony loves doing most in the world.
He sounds—god, he sounds miserable, is what he sounds like. Tony can sympathize, since he feels just as awful, and that was before he jumped on a bomb to save Steve’s life.
is? because he knows what it feels like to love Steve—he's had years, decades of experience with that, after all—but so far in their relationship he's just been waiting for some shoe to drop, for Steve to realize his feelings don't match the sheer depth and breadth of Tony's, for him to
A sound of disappointment moves through the room in a wave, but Steve is already following Tony off stage and into the greenroom, too caught up in the little overgrown curls at the nape of his neck to care about the questions being shouted after them or the sound of tweets being fired off into the ether.
looking at Steve when he asks it. If Steve could put a word to his expression, he’d say Tony looks downright despondent at the idea, even if they’d already established earlier that yes, this thing was entirely Nat’s idea because she’s an unrepentant troll.
Steve in particular notices the way Tony looks, because he’s developed a bad habit of doing that over the past year and change, and he’s kind of helpless at this point. Tony’s backlit by the afternoon sun, preoccupied with whatever he’s doing with the strange woman’s arm to distraction, and Steve can’t be judged too harshly—anyone with eyes would drag theirs over the exposed muscles of Tony’s arms, the shift and flex of his shoulders, the firm taper of his waist, the pronounced curve of his a—

It’s not a big deal when Tony texts him that afternoon to say there was a delay in scheduling the press conference—Pepper is in Tokyo and wants to be there in person to help with damage control. They’ll do it Monday. Tony offers to take him out to a nice dinner to make it up to him, and Steve couldn’t have said no if he wanted to (which he didn’t). He spends the entire meal trying not to fantasize about playing footsie with Tony under the table as he listens to him talk excitedly, animatedly about the latest updates to Steve’s suit.
, and Steve reminds himself it’s not a big deal when Tony beckons him over with a waggle of his fingers and holds him by the elbow once they’re standing side by side, or when Tony reaches up on his tiptoes to plant a big kiss on Steve’s cheek, setting off a flurry of pops and flashes.
“Feel that?” Steve asks, breathing hotly next to Tony’s ear. Against Steve’s hand, Tony nods, never breaking eye contact, even as Steve slowly pushes his own hips down to drag what is unmistakably the thick, blunt head of his cock up and against Tony’s balls through his jeans. “Tell me you feel that. Feel me.”
everything Steve gives him, and still he feels starved and aching and desperate for
When he weaves their fingers together, he gets to watch Tony’s mouth click shut and his eyes go wide. Super-hearing means he can count the beats of Tony’s racing heart without having to feel them. Steve’s telegraphing every movement, every feeling, as much as he possibly can now that words seem to have escaped him.
“I have to go to another event tonight,” he says. “Wanna dress up? Be my date? Watch my back?” This is something he can do now—he can touch Steve, take him out, kiss him,
“Is that okay?” Steve asks. Like he didn’t just fuck Tony to within an inch of his life. So sweet, his Steve; sweet, and hot, and dirtier than Tony could have ever guessed, could have hoped for, the evidence of which is still leaking out over his thighs. “I’d like to stay. With you.”
. Steve takes another drink of champagne to calm himself.
Steve’s toes are nicely filed, he notes; not too long, not too short—perfect, just like the rest of him.
The concealed gun in Iron Man’s shoulder appears with a hiss of metal—the bullet is out in less than a second, hitting Piledriver square in the center of the head. It’s not enough to kill him, but it dazes him long enough for Steve to escape his grasp and knock him back with an elbow to the sternum. Tony rockets forward and grabs Steve, one eye still on Piledriver behind him.
,” Tony breathes, kissing Steve because he’s close enough, because he can. Writhing against the man on top of him, Tony tilts his hips just so, feels the whole slick length of Steve slide up against his balls and swallows the shocked groan that spills out of him. “Fuck me, Steve. Please,
, because when is he ever going to have this again? As soon as Steve is satisfied that Tony’s urges have passed, he’s going to leave and take that perfect mouth and that gorgeous smile and that stunning cock with him. And what’s Tony going to be left with? A beautiful memory, to go with all the others he has of Steve.
“Shh,” Tony breathes, hushing him and kissing as he goes—Steve’s temple, Steve’s jaw, the flat bridge of Steve’s nose, his forehead—until Steve is grabbing helplessly onto the back of Tony’s jacket just to hold onto something and keep from shaking apart.
The doorknob jamming against Tony’s hip kicks him back, panting, into reality. “What was the second thing?” he whines.
lips to yours and kiss the breath out of you—he understood.
“That was torture,” Tony whines, kissing the base of Steve’s throat and following it with a nip of teeth that makes stars burst behind Steve’s eyelids. “Why did we agree to your plan again?”
Steve could have painted Tony in that moment: vulnerable, eyes and skin and hair glowing like fire and honey and whiskey in the light of the setting sun as it glinted off the cityscape. He was handsome, small but strong, nervous but brave, and so unbelievably worth choosing it took every ounce of Steve’s strength to keep his hand under his thigh. To not reach out and take Tony’s face in his hands and just—

And yeah, maybe Tony’s been at a loss for friends most of his life. Maybe this thing with Steve got off to a bumpy start because of his profound self-esteem issues. Maybe this will all blow up in their faces. But he loves Steve Rogers, and that has been and always will be the truth.

Steve goes from room to room up and down the compound, looking everywhere for Tony, for the suit, for any sign of life. It’s quiet for the summer, and Tony is impossible to miss, unless he wants to be. It happened like this not too long ago, Steve remembers, when Tony and Pepper broke up once and for all—Tony disappeared for days, radio silence, only reappearing when he felt like he was capable of showing face without cracking. He’d been in the tower under their noses the whole time, but Tony had made himself so scarce it was like he’d went and found himself a pocket dimension just to be alone.

Even as Steve's words fill Tony with an overwhelming, lung-squeezing surge of happiness, the woman's derisive, chiming laugh stings him right where it hurts; he has to set his glass on the floor because his hand is starting to shake. “I thought Tony Stark didn’t go in for friends
It’s not a big deal when Steve, walking back to the tower after his standard Sunday morning thirty miler, is approached by a throng of reporters just outside the front doors. Their questions follow a single obvious thread, and for some reason, he’s compelled to reach for his phone.
It’s solid advice, actually. But for a moment, all Steve can think about is how dearly he misses that voice in his ear, his head, his
“Oh thank god,” Tony groans, head falling back. Steve prides himself on managing to look at anything other than the long, fluttering line of Tony’s throat in that moment. “You’re a saint, Cap. We’ll get it done first thing tomorrow, promise.”
Tony strolls around the corner into the kitchen, still pink from a shower, wearing a cheap white T-shirt and expensive jeans, humming a classical song Steve recognizes but can’t remember the name of off the top of his head. Even at this sorry moment, Steve is helplessly enamored with the awesome scope

And all the while Steve holds Tony’s tie in his hand, smooth silk secure against his skin like a promise that needs to be kept.
Once they’re alone, the other diners seem to quickly get over the initial shock of seeing Iron Man and Captain America on a date together and go back to their own meals. The air in the room is fragrant with the smell of four-star Italian food, but Steve’s stomach is too tightly wound now to appreciate it.

Pepper Potts?”
Everyone—Bruce, Thor, Natasha, Clint, Bucky—has been on the receiving end of that particular display of Tony’s affection. Never untoward, never aggressive: Tony knows how to read people, (“It’s part and parcel of being an effective businessman, Cap”) so he knows when to leave well enough alone, like after Natasha’s been going at the heavy bag for an hour and the angst is pouring off of her, and it’s never anything more than a peck to the cheek or the forehead. Chaste, brushing, affectionate.

Tony’s tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth, cutting off his inhale and subsequent response. Steve stares as his warm hands migrate upward; so much has happened in the span of ten minutes, it’s dizzying. Tony wouldn’t be surprised if Steve is the only reason he’s still upright.
Finally, Steve makes his way to the rooftop. Natasha’s vegetable garden is flourishing in the open air, which smells distinctly of fresh herbs and flowers. The sun is hidden behind clouds at the moment, but Steve can still see Tony clear as day: sitting in the same T-shirt-and-jeans combination from last night, plus a suit jacket to ward off any chill, on a bench. Behind him, the ill-advised extra large gazebo Tony had insisted on during construction stands mournfully empty, a gaping shadow looming over the man in a way that makes Steve deeply, profoundly aware of how
Tony, and that grief is a ten-ton weight in his stomach. And yet, standing here looking into this Tony’s big brown eyes, faced with that benevolent (if teasing) smile and generous heart, Steve feels young and limitless, weightless, like he’d float off the floor if it weren’t for Tony, who’s still holding his hand against his chest.

“I don’t want you to stop being yourself, but I do want more of you for myself.” Once Tony shakes himself from his stupor and settles his arms around Steve’s shoulders, Steve sets to loosening the knot in his tie until it hangs open and Steve can start looping both ends around his hand. Their noses just touch when Steve speaks, his head bent so the words don’t have to travel far to reach Tony’s ears: “You’re my best friend, Tony. I trust you. Even when we disagree, I know your heart is in the right place, and I admire you so much for that—the sheer power of your convictions alone, it’s incredible. And when we fight together? God, Tony. I feel

It’s too fucking cute. Steve has to remind himself for the millionth time that this is not actually a date, because the words are right on the tip of his tongue.
“You like each other.”
At the question, Tony pauses with hand on his tie, looking out from the shadows at the milling crowd. The string music is posh and lively; everyone is dressed to the nines and they all hate each other. Everything glitters and everything shines, concealing the horrific amount of bullshit roiling just below the surface.
“Get your hands off me!”
“Yes, please,
at the compliment, something Tony rarely bestows on anyone, including—if not especially—himself. Natasha’s words repeat themselves in the back of Steve’s mind as he looks up at Tony:
Steve crosses his arms across his chest to make himself feel safer, more contained. If he doesn’t, who knows where these ridiculous feelings might go. He feels silly enough as it is, blushing and stammering while dressed in his uniform, sans helmet. Even Tony’s probably wondering why he’s wasting his time talking to a red-white-and-blue fossil when he could be downstairs destroying Clint and the others at pool or showing the airmen around the tower, giving them the bells-and-whistles tour.
“Cute,” Tony mutters to himself, laughingly.
“Feel so good…
“…Okay, that’s fair.”
knows.
As if Tony owed Bucky anything. As if Tony still owed anyone, anywhere, anything.
Without another word and with all the grace of a major league pitcher, Tony pivots and launches Steve bodily at Sam, who catches him in his arms in a full bear hug before hauling him around the corner behind the brick wall. By the time Tony turns around, Piledriver’s hand has gone slack.
“God, the
But tonight Tony is dead on his feet, eyes bloodshot from strain and fatigue and very likely a minor panic attack, and instead of giving Steve a rundown of his evening (he had a great story about a famous actor falling headfirst into a fountain and everything), Tony finds himself slipping into thoughts he usually saves for when he’s alone, of a timeline in which the island disappears and in its place is Steve, and he is as desperately in love with Tony as Tony is with him.
Tony’s body pulls taut, buzzing like a live-wire before the tip is even inside him. He can’t even make one of his noises for Steve, he’s so overwhelmed. The stretch is unreal, pushing him out and open like he’s never been before, further, wider, big, bigger, stretching,

Tony steps forward and Steve opens for him without prompting, legs spreading so the other man can stand between them. Steve’s often wondered what it would be like to be the sole focus of Tony’s attention in a moment like this—it’s heady enough in everyday life, being on the receiving end of that intense gaze, all of the blistering intelligence that lives right behind Tony’s eyes on Steve as they discuss tactics and after-action reports and what the other wants for dinner. Now, as Tony stares him down and slowly unravels his own tie from Steve’s slack fist, Steve can’t even imagine

It’s been a long time since those early days, Tony thinks, watching the new team assemble on the couches, loveseats, beanbag chairs, and blankets strewn around the in-home movie theater. The screen isn’t excessively massive, per Steve’s wishes, but the sound is as good as it gets, per Clint’s; Tony updates the hardware year over year to keep up with the times, especially as film goes the way of digital (much to Steve’s chagrin).
“Honestly,” he continues, shamefaced, “I didn’t think Captain America went in for that kind of thing.”

He keeps babbling nonsense words of praise as they both come down, desperately breathing each other’s air in deep gulps, smiles spreading until they’re giggling and kissing nothing but teeth. For a while they do just that, stroking faces and lips with nerveless fingers, kissing between shuddering gasps; the air is humid and smells like sweat and come, Tony is still being held up against the door, and Steve’s jacket is fully off. They’re messy and ridiculous and

kisses like—not how Steve thinks Tony wants to be kissed. So Tony works his own magic, dropping his head back with a soft moan, trusting Steve to keep the hand on his jaw steady, and then arches forward, rolling his body against Steve’s in a long, sinuous wave.
“Yeah, Cap?”
Steve, for his part, takes the hug in stride like they do it every day. Tony likes to imagine it, touching Steve like this whenever he wants to, but that’s all it is—a fantasy. Just like being with Steve is a fantasy, one Tony has entertained for far too many years to count. He satisfies himself with Steve’s friendship, tells himself it’s enough, and if he happens to sleep with the occasional look-alike, that’s nobody’s business but Tony’s (and JARVIS’s, and in one deeply unfortunate instance, Pepper’s).
Before he can finish that sentence, Steve’s arms are coming around him, biceps pressing in on either side of Tony’s ribcage, warm hands splaying out against the middle of his back, and his chin is being tucked against the spot where Steve’s long, beautiful neck meets his mountainous traps.
