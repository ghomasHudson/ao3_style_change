Heat splinters down John’s spine, driving down to lodge in his cock, which throbs with intent. The outline of his growing arousal is clear through the fabric of his jeans.
“Getting out of our own way, as it were.” Ellen smiled warmly, her eyes moving from Sherlock to John and then back again.
“You cut yourself.” He dips a flannel into the bowl of hot water and wrings it out, before pressing it to John’s toes and gently rubbing.
“You’re angry about what that means. About what you’ve missed out on. It makes you second guess yourself and the relationships you’ve had. With Major Sholto for instance.”
It’s a mark of how unsettled John is that minutes have passed before he realizes that Sherlock must be there for this conversation. Setting the tumbler down on the glass coffee table he excuses himself and walks to the bedroom.
John turns onto his side as Sherlock slips back beneath the covers. Says, “You.” Sherlock’s skin is cold and he burrows into John’s heat. His leg sliding between John’s, his arm winding around his waist, his nose nudging just below John's ear.
He thinks about the intimacy of being able to brush your teeth in the nude while your lover uses the loo.
Sherlock waves his hand as if he’s annoyed by this proverb. “That assumes that the quality of something is inherently tied to the quantity of it.”
“You run all around London,” John says, voice low. “Sherlock Holmes, the world’s only consulting detective.” Sherlock twitches, fingers flexing against the sheets. Staring up into John’s eyes, pupils blasted wide open, all of him blown wide open. John braces one hand against the bed and reaches with the other. “Everyone keeps their distance. The great mind, the genius, the giant unsociable dick.” John smiles as he says it, erasing any rancor, and Sherlock’s mouth ticks up, his eyes nicking shut as John skates two wet fingers over his entrance.
“It’s not entirely absurd. You, better than anyone, know how I am. I'm likely to bollocks this up within the week.”
“Stop." The word choked out, Sherlock’s hands pulling, tugging at John’s shoulders as John pops off.
“If you don’t mind, I’d like to lay something to rest before we continue,” John says. Sherlock nods, his brow drawing down and in. “How do you define submission, Sherlock?”
Sherlock was out of his seat before he could talk himself out of it. He knelt on the floor in front of John and looked up at him.
Charlotte scrunched up her nose again in disgust. “So bees make honey with their throw-up?” she said, gagging a bit at this unfortunates news.
“Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.” John gasps as Sherlock glances over the top of John’s cock and continues down between his thighs.
He’s sweating. His vest is sticking to him, to his chest and underneath his arms. It’s cold in the car. When his sweat dries tiny chills begin to tremor beneath his skin.
Sherlock simply nods and follows as John turns on the ball of his foot and walks in front of him, the back of his neck burning.
“I care about you, Sherlock. I know it’s only been a few days, but it would be deceitful of me to pretend I’m not falling for you. What this is between us, it happens sometimes in situations like ours. Not always, rarely even, but the truth is that sometimes it’s impossible to be this intimate with someone without deeper feelings also developing. I’m experiencing that with you.
Please subscribe to that fic (there will be 8 chapters in all) as I won't be adding new chapters here each time to let you know when a new chapter posts over there.
Sherlock is spread out below him in a debauched sprawl. His chest and neck and cheeks are tinted in a deep shade of pink, his nipples hard and peeking out from the tangle of auburn curls on his chest. He’s looking up at John in an uncharacteristically open manner, vulnerable and a bit frantic, and John feels something hot burst behind his breastbone when he speculates on why that is. He wonders, not for the first time, how bad it gets inside Sherlock’s head. He knows he’ll never be able to fully grasp it, but considering that it drives Sherlock to seek out drugs and sex and grisly crime scenes as alternatives to being locked inside it, John knows it’s no picnic.
, I felt the itch to write something sexy, so this will be what it says on the box: a smutty librarian romp (with lots of feeeeelings of course, because it's me). Not sure if I'll be able to keep this up (I'm job searching), but I wanted to see if I could try and post a new chapter each week on Saturdays to give myself a bit of a deadline. I've never written fic that way before, so we'll see what happens, also it's summer, so kids are home, vacations etc. etc.
“So you were touching your cock…” he said, his lips stained from the wine; they were the color of crushed berries, and I wanted desperately to suck on them, but I stayed still, as I felt him tug on the tab of my zipper.
He huffs that low laugh again and he tucks his thumbs up into your rolled shirtsleeves and strokes over the smooth skin of your biceps and that’s not going to help you stop shaking at all is it? No, it’s not, but you don’t want him to stop, you don’t ever want him to stop touching you.
There was no way to control it, he thought, looking out over the stream and the magenta clutch of asters on the far green bank.
and when Sherlock starts to come inside him a moment later John gathers him in and holds him fast while they shake and shake and shake.
This time John paints a lines of droplets across both of Sherlock’s cheeks and opens his mouth, smearing his lips across them before sucking gently at the sticky sweet mess he has made.
Sherlock looks at him for a beat and then nods. Turning to hang up the towel, the ring glows, limpid, and John’s throat tightens. Aches. His mouth tugs up, and his cheek muscles twinge. Sherlock says, “I thought we could go out.”
John doesn’t touch him. Doesn’t want to coerce him. He lets his confession be enough. It’s up to Sherlock now.
“Right, shall we?” Sherlock said, turning and extending his arm in the direction of the hives. Charlie nodded eagerly, her brown eyes sweeping up to meet Sherlock’s, wide and bright. Sherlock felt an answering tremor of excitement ripple up his spine as they walked. The girl was dressed in pyjama bottoms festooned with an animated character Sherlock didn’t recognise and a pink mackintosh. The yellow boots were again in residence, her short hair held back by a headband with two bobbing ladybug antennae sprouting out the top, and there was milk crust clinging to the corners of her mouth from her breakfast.
His whole body gleams in the lamplight, shiny sleek with sweat. His hair is sticking up in tufts where he’s been gripping it, going out of his damned mind for the massive cock currently buried balls deep inside his body. His lower back is bowed, arse tipped wantonly up, his cock hanging thick and flushed dark with blood below his stomach.
I could not force the word past my lips, but John saw, he saw, as he always sees. He was always watching me and he saw the word screaming through my eyes and he drew his hand back and out and wrapped his arms around me and hugged me tightly to him, murmuring something in my ear.
“All right, all right,” John said, “obviously you’ve had a grand time, but grandma’s not feeling well and I’m afraid we’re going to have to call it a day.”
Sherlock hums and presses closer, bags rustling in his hands at John’s sides. “That’s because it was a stupid question,” murmured against John’s lips before he’s turning and hailing a cab.
It had started to rain lightly. Droplets caught in John’s fringe as he stepped outside. The beech trees behind him glowed in the white light from the low-hanging clouds, their gold and green leaves shimmering in the wind, glossy and wet. “Great. What time?”
“Jesus.” John might have a legitimate heart attack. He licks his lips. “The lube. Is it still in the bedroom?”
“Well, you’re not alone anymore,” Zoe said with finality, as if she had finally made her mind up about John. “We’re your community now. Blue’ll give you our numbers and you can ring us anytime. Charlotte has a standing invitation to come to ours and muck about in our barn.”
John cuts him off. “Don’t you dare fucking apologise.” Sherlock’s mouth twitches and John asks, “You all right?” To which Sherlock nods, cheeks pink. John points to the headboard. “Good. Then get on your hands and knees. My other cock needs sucking.”
“John, before you go, would you be a dove and make sure I’m signed out of this bloody thing?” Mrs. Patterson asks sweetly. “Peter was doing god knows what and some bloke was out hacking around and now it takes over our search screen every time we turn the thing on. I don’t want to have to change my password again.”
When Sherlock’s head drops back against the pillow, eyes squeezed shut, John flickers his tongue over the same spot.
Sherlock’s eyes are still closed in revelment. “So good.” His cat-like eyes slit open, his voice deep and gravelly. He opens his arms and, when John steps closer, encloses John in the pocket of warmth he has created with just his body and the eiderdown. John wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist, tucking his face into Sherlock’s throat, breathing in the salt sharp scent of his skin.
“Yes. Yes.” Sherlock runs a hand through his hair, gripping and tugging. “Please. Yes. Right here. Let’s start. God, please. I can’t think straight.”
The thoughts became so intruding that Sherlock finally gave up trying to outrun them, set down the book he was trying and failing to focus on, and closed his eyes. He stretched his legs out in front of him, his socked feet thrust into a warm pool of sunlight pouring in through the window above him. He crossed his arms across his chest and burrowed his shoulders into the armchair.
“She worked and ran the house, ran the marriage, ran the parenting. I was a willing participant, engaged when necessary, but I never took the lead on any of it. She held it all. The doctors and dentist appointments, the social calendar, childcare, the cleaning, the cooking. I guess I figured since she only worked part time that that was a fair split. I took care of my stuff, did my laundry and the occasional washing up, paid the bills and did the taxes, maintenanced the cars.”
John tries to breathe, but he can’t. All he can feel is hot battering waves coursing through him, moving out from where Sherlock is touching him.
“We should go to Sussex for New Years,” John suggests, as Sherlock peppers wet kisses over his hips. Sherlock hums and it feels like butterflies rustling across his skin.
John goes. He’s brushing his teeth with one of the extra toothbrushes that Sherlock keeps stored underneath the sink—apparently he buys in bulk, which John finds oddly endearing—when Sherlock stumbles through the en suite door.
John just had enough time to say thank you before he disappeared through the doorway and outside. Sherlock watched them race across the lawn to the barn.
. John squares his shoulders, settling his weight into his hips, hands sliding behind his back. At rest. “What?”
Sweat beads between them, the air under the heavy duvet growing humid and warm. John pulls back to shuck it off. The cold air floods over them. John’s back rounds up. Below him Sherlock’s pale skin is growing pink in the spill of white light coming in through the window. His gaze is dark and hazy, heavy lidded. His lips are red and swollen. There is a thin film of sweat shining on his chest. John bends and licks at the slick hollow of Sherlock’s flushing throat, tasting salt and skin. Opens his mouth and drags it up. The tendons flex and taughten beneath his tongue. Sherlock’s pulse thudding against his lips.
you that. You had become a part of my purpose for living, but I didn’t think I could ever matter that much to anyone else. I believed I was unlovable. And everything I did only sustained that reality. So I died. And I truly didn’t think I would ever come back. I would never have done that, in front of you, if I thought I would survive what came next."
“That’ll be your confirmation email,” John says, starting to sidle along the row of desks as he spots a patron waiting at the front of the library. He recognizes her, a regular, dressed in the bright red uniform of the Royal Mail. Ian, the front desk clerk, is nowhere to be seen.
What if this is it? What if this is the moment? Does John want to throw it away? They can still turn back. Right now. They could. John could say no. Nothing would have to change. He could go to Harry’s. Get himself sorted. He could come back. And they could go on as they always have.
On the tube ride home he prays that Sherlock will be out. He focuses his entire consciousness on it.
Downstairs John preheats the oven and pulls a baking sheet’s worth of unbaked frozen croissants from the freezer. After brushing them quickly with an egg wash he fills and plugs in the kettle. The clock reads 3:43 am. As he waits for it to boil he goes into the sitting room to lay a fire. The air is unseasonably cool, the storm bringing a chill with it from the north.
“How many of these has he had?” Sherlock asks, his gaze sliding up to Angel who stands on the other side of the bar watching and Angel’s face breaks apart into a wide smile which shines in his handsome dark face.
“Ugh, you’re all wet!” Zoe exclaimed in disgust, wriggling away from Sherlock and plucking exaggeratedly at the back of her shirt. On her way out of the kitchen she grabbed one of the open bottles of wine from the table.
He was cleaning out the flower beds in his front yard on Friday morning, tearing out the annuals, now dead, along with any weeds that had gone too long unchecked, and cleaning up the perennials which would come back next year, when he saw John at the end of their driveways putting Charlotte onto the bus. Sherlock paused, leaning on his shovel, and raised his hand in greeting when John caught sight of him. Sherlock watched as John looked down at something in his hand and moments later felt his mobile buzz in his pocket.
is the difference between you and Trevor and I’m afraid you’ll never be able to bridge it. Not with how you’ve been behaving these last three months.”
“Anyone want a coffee?” Ellen asked as they left out the back door, standing and beginning to gather plates. John rose to help, offering to wash up. Sherlock focused on his breathing as the attention finally shifted off of him and excused himself to the loo.
Sherlock’s mid-giggle when John pins him, his cheeks rosy pink, his chins pleated, his curls spilling over the pillow, wet with morning light.
“Send them to me. The pictures.” You ramble your address off before you can stop yourself. “It’s 42d Montague Street. Sherlock Holmes. Bloomsbury.”
He continued in the same fashion for I don’t know how long, tracing the veins that began to grow rigid along the dorsal side of my cock and paying devotion to the vee of my frenulum with firm pressure. At last I reached full hardness and I had to feed my cock to him, guiding it into the tight, hot circle of his lips as he began to take me deeper into his mouth. All the while the tide continued to rise, until I was brimming, and dangerously close to running over.
John nodded. “Exactly. There’s no purpose to it. I just enjoy it. I think you’ve enjoyed writing, yes?”
“Was it a game?” John asks, following his thumb with his lips. Sherlock’s fond of games and puzzles. “To see how long you could last? Before—“ John kisses down the taut column of his neck. “Before you had to get a hand on yourself?”
I fell to my knees, unable to hold my weight any longer, and kissed him, upside down as he was, tasting the musky bitterness of my come.
He kisses you deeper, deeper, his tongue in your mouth, exploring, and you get hard. Again. Can’t help it. All your blood rushing south to pound in your thighs, to knot in your navel. You slide your knees forward and he’s hard too. You didn’t let him come, you didn’t. It’s a miracle really, you with your tongue shoved as deep as it would go and him paring slivers of butter off into the pan making desperate sounds above you.
John’s body jerks involuntarily. A part of him had expected Sherlock to deny him. A much larger part than John had wanted to admit.
“I don’t care what the bloody buggering plan was, just get back here and fuck me. Please. I need you.”
John licking the empty air beside Sherlock’s straining cock, the seething wave of sparks washing over his most sensitive skin.
“So, you’re a bit soppy, then,” Sherlock teases, not unkindly, smiling tentatively. Maybe a little afraid. They’re still feeling their way around one another, touching each other’s edges and asking,
“Only you could be thinking of Sussex at a time like this. And why in God’s name do you still have your clothes on?”
He can’t see you. Can’t look into you with those eyes, can’t shatter you further. You’re safe and he’s the one making embarrassing sounds now, listen to him, he’s practically sobbing, pushing himself back, just shoving himself back against you as you make a sloppy mess of him, as you lick him so good, so good he’s reduced to whining. Listen, listen, can they hear him? Can all those Thursday people out in the ordinary world hear him keening for your tongue? Can the buzzing yearning crickets and the green cut grass and the river wind rushing through the trees and the many petaled folds of the roses wet with dew three floors down hear the harsh way he breathes for it, the way he shivers and shivers for it, the way he spreads his legs wider, wider, pressing back, wanting more, his cock so hot and big in your hand as you tug at it, as you lick him, lick him, as you knead that tight muscle, as you worry at it, flicker at it, lap at it, as it softens, softens like wax under a flame, softens for you, softens softens supples and lets you, lets you, lets you tuck right in.
John pushes a hand through his hair, disarranging it. “God, he must have done a number on you. I didn’t think it was this bad, but—“
Sherlock wrapped his hands around the steering wheel and shook the car, screaming until he was hoarse. Until his throat burned and the breath in his lungs ran out. He screamed and he shook his car until it bled out of him. The energy to seek out tools for numbing his life away ebbing as he eventually fell back into his seat exhausted, tears running down his cheeks, his blackened hands aching, his heart pounding wildly against his ribs.
Inside, John is shoved up against the mirrored wall almost instantly. With a thigh pressed between his legs and caged in by two strong arms, he’s pinned.
John draws his finger out and Sherlock whimpers, shuddering all over with need. John doesn’t tease him, just slicks them up and adds a second. Thrusting them deep together to resume their incessant circling.
Dropping Carrot onto the ground unceremoniously she turned and shouted, “Dad, I’m here! Carrot ran away!”
He shifts, redistributing his weight across your legs; you can feel him straighten, spine bristling with uncertainty.
Desire like the bite of a needle and the euphoria that unfurls through your veins after a hit, he’s all of these things and more. He's a calm placid pool with untold fathoms stretching beneath. He's commanding in a quiet way that makes you stand up straighter and take notice. He's reined in and on parade and yet you catch tantalising glimpses through the veneer he's painted. Glimpses of the heart of him. He’s soft jumpers the colour of marshmallow and biscuits with milk tea and that place called home you’ve never really known.
, which was always sinking or getting blown up. There were three or four different ones I think. Redbeard had dastardly luck. He had an adopted son, a French nobleman’s orphan, named Eric LeRouge, and a sidekick named Tripod, on account of his wooden leg.” Sherlock shakes against John, giggling a bit. “He was a surgeon who kept weapons and other odds and ends hidden in his hollow leg. He was incredibly useful in a tight spot. Actually, he was quite a lot like you, John,” but John socks Sherlock hard on the shoulder so that he shuts up, his chest still vibrating under John’s cheek as he chuckles silently to himself.
“You eat them at night while you’re watching telly. Sometimes when you’re reading the papers in the afternoon. Sometimes you grab one on your way out to the clinic in the morning. I don’t think you’re even aware of it.”
“It was tragic,” Ellen said, her brown eyes looking at Sherlock with a mix of pity and compassion. She shook her head. “A damn shame. Have you decided whether you’ll start up new ones in the spring? I understand if you need time.”
“Then we’ll camp out on the floor,” John says, running the tip of his nose along Sherlock’s jaw before tipping his head back to meet Sherlock’s gaze. “Were you planning on us keeping your mum’s things?”
I let it suffuse me. Let the waves wash through me, awakening sensations lain dormant, but not gone.
As the DI digs through a box sitting precariously perched atop a listing tower of its fellows, John sits in the only seat available: Lestrade’s swivel desk chair. The sofa is only partially full of stacked picture frames wrapped in brown packing paper, but Sherlock doesn’t sit. He stands before a bank of windows to John’s left, looking out into the dark. The rain streams down the glass, making the city lights melt and run.
It seemed to Sherlock that John had been thrust into a role usually reserved for women; that of caretaker. And he was very obviously floundering, but also, Sherlock observed, trying very, very hard.
“You had better put that plug in now,” he says, his voice a rock-rough purr, “because sometimes you get impatient,” sliding his fingers out of his arse and pushing up to kneeling, “sometimes you just can’t wait for me to ride your cock and you tell me to stop…” gathering another handful of lube, “…to forget about the vibrator, and just, climb on.”
John kisses him softly, without the frenzy of before. Strokes his open hand down Sherlock’s waist and rests it there, unhurried.
It was like something inside him revealed itself to me in that moment. It was a look of pure need, pure yearning, pure gratitude. He did not raise his eyes to mine, he simply raised his hands and ran them gently down my body. Into the slight dip of my waist and over the jut of my hips, clothed in the lace. He lingered a bit at the hems, stroking the edges before molding his palms down the outside of my thighs. He did this several times before he seemed to come out of a daze and only then did he palm me, squeezing my cock in his fingers. I closed my eyes and simply experienced it. The way I filled his hand and the way the lace brushed my foreskin, sending waves of heat surging up my spine.
“Never,” Sherlock said resolutely, shaking his head in mock-horror, but also immensely happy and relieved to be Blue again.
How long has it been since he’s snuck a cigarette, John wonders. He tries to do the math and comes up empty.
“You know there’s no difference between drumsticks for a right handed person and a left handed person, right?”
I'm realizing that I'm terrible at keeping to a schedule. I've been ill and injured and in a dark mental health space that has made it difficult for me to post when I planned to, not to mention I had to re-write this scene quite a few times to get it where I wanted it. So I'm letting the every Saturday thing go. I'll try and post on the weekends when I'm able. Thanks for being here and for your understanding. I hope you and yours are well, sending love your way <3
“Sherlock,” he was using his army voice on me. His hands were pressed to my shoulders and he was pushing me away from him. “Sherlock, look at me right now.”
“I want only to make you happy,” I said, marvelling at my inadequacy in accomplishing that one simple task, “and yet I make a very poor job of it, I’m afraid.”
That’s about the time that he notices the pink vibrator buzzing happily away an inch or two below the main spectacle.
“I’m an addict,” he says next, making John wish he hadn’t asked. Making him wish he could take it back. “But after that spot of trouble, I stayed clean, until. Well.” Until Reichenbach he means. His cheeks grow red when he says, “Mostly through socially acceptable addictions like cigarettes and coffee and procuring a police scanner that I then used to irritate Lestrade with my presence at crime scenes to no end.”
He sounds, bless him, genuinely curious, so John nods, physically incapable of speech, and Sherlock smiles, the satisfied smile he reserves for the end of a case, when the mystery has unraveled. His fingers curl against John’s scalp, knuckles scratching lightly.
“It’s called after care, John. We’ve just been through a rather harrowing ordeal. I find I’m in need of your doctorly concern.” Lips quirked as he pulls back the covers and clambers in.
John stares out the window for a minute, collecting his thoughts. They’re almost to the gala and a bridge between them would need to be constructed quickly.
“Thank you. These are things I would have asked you yesterday and I’m sorry I acted without knowing the answers to them. I understand that you were in an overwhelmed mental and emotional state yesterday. As I understand it, you were in shock and felt unable to answer the phone. What can we do next time you feel unable to speak in a moment of crisis that could avert the situation that unfolded on Sunday?”
He took the bottle of oil from his pocket and wet his fingers. When he returned them to my body he slicked them up and down the crack of my arse and circled my aching rim before pushing them once more inside. The friction of the lace against my cock combined with the feeling of being stretched and filled was overwhelming.
Sherlock presses a button on the remote and then lays in it down. Just as the first ringing note of his violin sings out from the speakers he reaches down and turns the dildo on.
“I’m not like Moriarty, Sherlock. Yes, I know who you belonged to before. And I’m not one of those daddies the boys at your club go with, Sherlock. I don’t want a toddler who tantrums, who is helpless, who needs their nappies changed. I won’t force you or hurt you. I won’t do anything to you or for you unless it is your express wish.
feeling is just beginning to unfurl, so close to where, if he could just, could just reach it, you would blossom completely, all protections gone. It’s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. “Sherlock. Lube. Where?”
“Sherlock,” they say, smiling warmly and stepping aside to let Sherlock and John into the foyer. John tries not to look too taken aback at the uncharacteristically friendly interchange, but Sherlock catches him at it anyway. He furrows his brow at John, but John shakes his head, rubbing his fingertips over his lips to hide his smile.
“I have no need to check the website for clients or start a new experiment or text Lestrade. It’s completely
“What’s going on with you?” Sherlock asks, looking personally offended, as John sidles further down the counter, until he’s safely around the corner, putting some space between him and Sherlock so that he can breathe, breathe.
He parked at the top of the hill, a twinging pang wracking him as he walked past the bare strip of land where his hives once sat.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, glad of a place to start. “It is true that honey bees die after they lose their stinger, however, you shouldn’t feel too badly because they were just doing their job of protecting the hive.
“No,” John says, more firmly this time, taking Sherlock’s head between his hands. “I love you is all. I’m just really bloody gone on you and it scares the shite out of me sometimes. I don’t want to mess this up. I can’t lose you again.”
“Won’t work. You’re cute when you’re cross too. Enjoy the sushi!” Sherlock calls over his shoulder as he opens the door and swirls through, disappearing into the hallway.
The room was dark around him, his house set too far back from the road for streetlights to reach his windows. He could hear the wind moving in the trees and Sherlock rose and went out into it, fetching his satchel from the car and an armful of logs for the fire.
Sherlock woke to a splitting headache. Although he much preferred oblivion to the gut punch of guilt that met him upon waking, the pain had become too insistent for him to ignore. With a groan he rolled onto his back and blinked his eyes up at the ceiling.
John stands back from him and shrugs out of his fitted navy-blue suit jacket. Hanging it on the back of his chair as he watches Sherlock struggle with his cuffs. Coming forward John takes Sherlock’s mouth in his and undoes them for him, stepping away so that Sherlock can remove it and start on his trousers. Sherlock’s fingers are thick and pounding with blood. They make him clumsy and slow. John pulls two chairs away from the table as Sherlock strips off his pants and socks and finally stands naked before him.
He ignores, successfully for the most part, the hot ember of shame that flares to life every now and then.
Sherlock smooths his hands over his curls as he turns, then wriggles his fingers through them, fluffing them up. They fall, like magic, into place. “See you later.”
Just then John comes again and Sherlock, surprised, manages to tighten his hole to milk the last few throbs of come from the tentacle before it slips free.
Back at home there was Mozart for drowning out memories and fried rice with shrimp for supper. Outside his kitchen window the clarion fall light faded into a pale gold before being subsumed by night. The long summer days were behind them, it was 6:30pm when darkness fell.
“That was an impressive array of…er…gifts…that you bought for me. Have a lot of experience in this area do you?” John teases, feeling awkward and off balance and like he needs to fill the silence.
“Everything,” he says, slightly frustrated. “I like to be taken care of. I crave that feeling when I can stop thinking so much and have someone else take over. Someone who can make me feel instead of think. I get the same pay off when I’m giving pleasure, turning my attention to their needs, taking care of someone else.”
You can’t bear it. He can’t either. His hand wrapped around the back of his neck, fingertips dug into the straining muscle. All of him pulled tight, like a chord.
John rolls over, the hair on his legs peeling apart in painful strips. He slips his knee between Sherlock’s and presses himself against Sherlock chest to chest. Their arms wrap around each other, tight, tight, tight.
“I was hard all night,” you whispered as I molded my hands to your hips, your sheer white pajama bottoms, indecent, hanging on by a thread. One tug and I could have had them down to puddle around your ankles. “Watching her touch you.”
John softens and reaches out to gather him into his arms. John reminds himself what Sherlock is coming from.
“That’s it,” Sherlock says, against John’s throat, as John ruts mindlessly into Sherlock’s big fist. “That’s it, John, come for me.”
So much for having the night to himself. John can’t help but feel a tad resentful and has to remind himself of the nine corpses currently rotting in the morgue.
The scent is green, sharp and sweet, like summer grass. John can’t see the bottle’s label, it’s one of Sherlock's collection of expensive black, matte bottles he orders from God knows where, but it evokes something inside him.
The words are a warm skirr of breath against John’s throat. The blue-black hair at the nape of Sherlock’s neck slips between his fingers, threads of night-dark silk. John’s skin will smell of clove and spice and decadent night blooming flowers for hours after. Somewhere in the distance, a horn blares. The rain falls and falls, sheets of silver pouring down the glass.
John shifts down until they’re lying face to face again. He nudges his lips against Sherlock’s reluctant ones.
John ignores his own body. Focuses all his attention on Sherlock. He can feel it building inside Sherlock in a way he can never really pay attention to when he’s chasing his own pleasure.
“Thank you. Thank you for taking this risk on us. It has to feel terrifying and overwhelming and strange. If it helps, tomorrow after our morning meeting we’ll fly home. We can work on what our next steps will be then. We’ll need to coordinate with DI Lestrade once we’re back in London and Bill might have some useful information by then as well. Does that make sense to you? Anything you want to add? You know Moriarty and how he works best.”
“If it’s not too much trouble, Mr. Holmes, would you please call me Charlotte?” the girl asked, politely enough, as she passed the towel across the table to him. Sherlock raised his eyebrows at her as he dabbed at his shirtfront. “My dad calls me Charlie because that used to be my name when I was a boy. But now it’s not anymore and I’d rather you call me Charlotte.”
“For what exactly?” John asked, sounding angry. “Because if you say you are sorry because you didn’t like it, then I will probably have to come up with some kind of outlandish chore for you to complete for me today, like scrubbing out the bath or scraping the bug carcasses off the Morris’ windshield. So think very carefully about what you are sorry for because you know I have a knack for this sort of thing.”
“May I undress you, sir?” Sherlock asks and waits for John’s acquiescence before he kneels and begins to remove John’s shoes. Socks next, his hands curling warm around John’s ankles. He stands and works on John’s cuffs, his long fingers slipping inside to touch John’s wrists. John can smell him, the subtle woodsy notes of his cologne, the sweet scent of his shampoo, and the smell that is all his own. As John stands in front of Sherlock, his eyes closed, he can feel his body respond to that intimate scent that he has come to know so well. Arousal fires instinctively, an ember of heat pulsing out through him. It has the strange effect of steadying him, fixing him in the moment, anchoring him inside his body.
John checks the hall and living room closets, but finds no duvet, only a scratchy afghan. He wonders where else Mrs. Hudson could have stashed it. Returning to the kitchen he finds Sherlock standing at the counter, the toaster’s tines glowing bright red in front of him, staring out the window. It’s started to rain again, water tracking down the glass in thin rivulets.
“Sherlock, you were ill. You’ve barely eaten in three days. You haven’t had a case in over a month. I understand why—”
“I’d actually prefer not to talk about it,” Sherlock said curtly, his cheeks hot. Ellen blinked and sat back in her chair, surprised at his bitter tone. “You can Google the case if you’d like.”
"Are you going to tell me how you figured it out?" John asks, rubbing the pad of his thumb over Sherlock's bottom lip. It catches. Sherlock's tongue darts out, slicking the way, and when his lips part, John slides it inside.
John was bothered by how much this reminded him of Sherlock, but was also somewhat pleased to know that Jim trusted him enough, or at least his medical opinion, to do what he said. John gave him three more days in bed, partially because he needed them, but partially so Jim was out of his hair, and Jim begrudgingly obliged.
“Since when did you care about breaking the law?” John asked. “We’ll play it by ear. I’m not suggesting—“ he lowered his voice, glancing at a security guard watching them curiously. “That was have
“You said you wanted to prove that I was in love with you. I couldn’t let you know…I was positive you didn’t feel that way.”
Sherlock ran a hand up John’s neck to the back of his head, holding it against him, missing the feel of John, missing his smell, his smile, his touch—everything. Finally he whispered softly, “You look even more changed than Hamish does.”
They continued down the sidewalk, stumbling a bit from their shaking, uncontrollable laughter. When they finally did regain their breaths enough to hail a cab, Sherlock was dialing Mycroft.
He didn’t get farther than a few steps before Jim leaped up and delivered a fast, unexpected blow to John’s stomach that sent him staggering backwards, doubled over. John gasped in pain and shock as Jim’s voice washed over him. “He’s right where he should be, being watched by
John shook his head at him. “You never have to compete for me. It’s like I said, you have me, all of me, whether you want it or not. I’ll think of something to tell Mary. I promise.”
As John undressed, Jim removed his tie, waistcoat, socks, and shoes, then unbuttoned his shirt and let it hang open. Once John was fully undressed, he stood in front of Jim, awaiting orders, but Jim had an eyebrow raised and was looking expectant, and John realized Jim wanted him to initiate.
The next night, John called Harry, who asked lots of questions, accusing him of being very vague. It frustrated him that he couldn’t get more specific, but he’d had to leave it as it was.
“Being in a haze all day and night doesn’t instill fear in anyone. Wouldn’t want to lose your reputation,” John pointed out. “Promise me you’ll lay off the drugs.”
John reddened. The first thing that came into his mind, of course, was everyone’s assumption or sometimes, insistence, that he was gay. It annoyed John to no end, and it annoyed him even more that every time someone assumed that he and Sherlock were a couple, he felt a deep relunctance to correct them.
Sherlock looked up, frowning up at him. “That’s ridiculous, John, I don’t need anything, and we haven’t the money for anything.”
John found himself hardening, disgusted at how readily his body reacted to someone as loathsome as Jim. He shuddered and pressed his back up against Jim almost involuntarily.
John gritted his teeth. The last thing he wanted was Jim to have any alone time with his son, feeding him poisoned lies, teaching him how to manipulate or kill or acquire. He would do the job as quickly as he could.
Jim's face contorted into a furious, threatening smile, then he frowned, pursed his lips, disbelieving. “'Bumped into him,' did you? Hm. That’s interesting.”
“This isn’t some man from a story. He is not only a danger to John and Hamish, but to you and Arthur as well, and will risk others’ lives without a second thought if he thinks it will help him get to me. If he comes to the door and no one is here, or even they
Sherlock spread his legs and let his muscles relax, his breathing starting to slow and even out. John grabbed something from the bed stand, a small vial of oil. At least being with Jim had taught him
John tensed up at the sound of his name on this strange man’s lips and picked up his pace, aiming for the thicker cluster of people ahead. “I don’t think that’s any of your business, mate,” he muttered and pushed into the crowd, hoping to lose him.
John looked at himself in the mirror, shocked at how worn and weary he looked. He pulled a fresh shirt on, double-checked the mirror to make sure the gauze was keeping the blood at bay, then hurried to the kitchen to see Hamish, who rushed into his arms for a hug.
John shook his head. No, this was too much. He shifted uncomfortably. “Sherlock—“ he said softly, his voice half-pleading.
“No. We’re leaving London to live somewhere else.” John didn’t want to admit that he had no idea where. “Come on.” He helped Hamish to his feet, then stood up himself. He looked down at the small boy. He was so young. Too young for everything he’d already felt and lost in life. He knew it would be worse to tell Hamish the truth and watch him die, but at the moment it was hard to imagine anything worse than breaking his son’s heart.
Mary shuddered, stepping away from him. She kept her head down, too terrified to look him in the eyes. “N-no, sir. He’s upstairs, sir.”
John considered this dilemma as he stepped into the kitchen. Gone was the fridge full of convenient if slightly off food, and the electric stove was replaced by an intimidating coal stove. Without a microwave and an electric kettle John was at a complete loss on what to do.
John gasped and pressed against him, then laughed, still finding laughter such a surprising thing, then growled into Sherlock’s mouth,  “That’s not funny.” He pushed Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders, rolling him over slightly to the left and then to the right so he could pull the arms free, then sats up, looking at Sherlock and running his hands up Sherlock’s arms from his wrists down to his chest and stomach, then back up to cup his face. He smiled.
Sherlock forced himself to stand still, watching John as he hesitantly stepped forward on the terrace, staring Magnussen down defiantly. It was a small reconciliation; whatever Charles Augustus Magnussen did to John now, John would bear it with dignity. And Sherlock was quite positive that he knew everything that Magnussen had on John’s file already. There was nothing that this despicable man could bring up that would cause John Watson to break down.
Sherlock held him to his chest, resting his chin on John’s head, not knowing what to say. That kiss had told him so much more than he wanted to know about what had happened here. John’s hesitation and tensing paired with the slightly raw skin around his wrists, spoke volumes, volumes that should never have been written, and he held John tighter.
“We just found out today that….we’re your parents,” John said. “We didn’t know before because, well, it’s impossible for two men to have a son.” He reddened and cleared his throat. “As you know. But I’m John, and this is Sherlock, and….and it’s…it’s really nice to meet you, Hamish. Hello.”
London still? But the cab curtains were drawn, so he sat back in the seat and looked at Jim, keeping his sorrow hidden behind a neutral mask.
“I kind of like it when you’re an arrogant dick,” he murmured into Sherlock’s ear, then kissed behind his ear as Sherlock began tuning his violin.
“You must trust me, Sherlock. Otherwise all of this ceases to exist, and you, along with everything you know, will disappear, a lost pocket of history with you trapped inside. You have one of the greatest minds on the planet and you choose to use it to help people. I know what you would give to save the life of a friend. I also know you won’t condemn millions to cease existing for selfish reasons.”
John stepped toward him and wrapped his arms around him. “You didn’t lose me.” He sighed into Sherlock’s shoulder. He was exhausted. He felt like he hadn’t slept in days, and the fatigue of paranoia felt much worse now that that blissful moment of temporary relief had vanished. “Will this ever be over? I’m so tired of running.”
John inhaled sharply at the sting of Sherlock’s nails and opened his eyes, staring widely into Sherlock’s. Sherlock shuddered, about to climax. “
Sherlock sat back in his chair, pursing his lips in annoyance. “Jim Moriarty. An old acquaintance. He’s a professor at Hamish’s old school.” He proceeded to give her a brief but detailed description of his appearance. Mary was taken aback when Sherlock continued with great earnestness, “Mary, if this man comes to the door, you are not, under any circumstances, to let him in. Do you understand me? The only exception is if
“Not at all. We’re still growing used to the idea ourselves,” Sherlock said, putting some convincing emotion into his voice. “We’re all Hamish has now, and it’s difficult to make ends meet.”
Later that night, after Jane had cleared up the dinner table and had gone home for the evening, Jim was writing a letter at his desk and John was reading. He had taken to reading much more in his free time, eager for any sort of fictional escape. A knock on the front door echoed through the room, and they turned to look at each other. Jim raised his eyebrows and turned back to his writing, leaving John to answer it.
“You’re not obliged to hang around me, John, if you find me so ‘freakish,’” Sherlock said, his voice like acid.
"Don't be silly, sweetheart!" Elton opened the door to an apparently empty room. There was a square of concrete propped up against the window, which didn't look unusual in the least until Elton picked it up and turned it around to reveal a living human face stuck inside. "Meet Ursula!"
Jim headed into the kitchen to get a bite to eat. Jane, who was standing over the stove making porridge, glanced at her shirtless boss and blushed, averting her eyes to the floor.
A preoccupied, blonde-haired man opened the door. “Mary, I told you, no callers, not while I’m writing.”
John could see the knife handle poking out beneath Jim’s pillow, but even so, he was able to roll over and fall asleep much faster than he had the night before.
“Sorry about this, John,” Sherlock said, then punched John in the stomach, not hard, but hard enough to illicit a loud groan, doubling him over. Sherlock quickly mussed his hair with his hands, untucked his shirt, pinched his cheeks to redden them, then smacked John’s arse, hissing, “
to solve,” Sherlock said. “I need something that the police can’t figure out. I need to create a reputation for being smarter than them so they’ll start calling me in to consult on cases.” The thing Sherlock missed the most from the 21
Sherlock scanned the crowed, deconstructing the posh, upper class men and women strolling about, and John wondered if Hamish was making friends his own age; he was so tight-lipped about his social life.
John swallowed. “Yes.” He paused. “I wasn’t going to tell you until after I found a place for sure, but I…I can’t do this anymore. What is mean is, maybe we need our own space. Between my job and my army pension, I should be able to afford a small place on my own. So. I think we’ll both be better off.”
John couldn’t do this. He couldn’t think of saying last words to Sherlock. He finally fumbled out, “Tell him I’m sorry. Tell him…that I’ll see him soon.” He struggled to look up at Jim as defiantly as he could.
“Goodbye, Jim,” Sherlock said cold, then turned away, spinning John with him and towing how toward the door, where Hamish was waiting.
After dinner, Sherlock and John returned upstairs, Sherlock grabbing his coat, pacing with excitement. “I’ll be going to Belgravia on foot due to our tight funds, unless I can sneak a ride on some passing cart, so I might be a bit late.”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist as they watched their son concentrate. Both men were so engrossed in the playing that they failed to hear Mary’s footsteps and only just managed to jump away from each other when she opened the door.
Sherlock smiled and pulled off John’s bowler hat, tossing it into the one of the chairs, then ran his hands down John’s chest, unbuttoning his waistcoat. “Somehow, I think we’ll manage,” Sherlock said.
“How do I explain this? Picture a clothesline--no, it’s nothing like that, forget the clothes line. In fact, forget the whole thing. You
Sherlock closed his eyes as John’s lips brushed against his chin. Was this what it felt like to be adored? It was entirely engrossing. He would have to be careful, or it could consume him. He’d kept away from love for that very reason. Now, however, he was beginning to think the risk was worth the feeling of happiness that bubbled up inside him whenever John was near.
“Yes, of course I’m alien. If you were in Italy I’d sound Italian. The TARDIS does a marvelous job translating,” the Doctor said absently, pacing. “Why are you here?
Sherlock stopped walking and stared at him. “I don’t sit around conjuring up slurs and abusive behaviors. Not only would that be a waste of time, it would be utterly boring.”
"Hey, cheer up, handsome." Jack patted John on he shoulder as he rose. "The doctor has a habit of showing up to those who need them. Have a little faith."
John stopped over to the dresser and yanked out his pyjamas. He turned to leave, stopped, then turned back to Sherlock. “Sherlock, be honest- are you
A young woman stepped into the room, looked up and nearly dropped the tea tray she was holding, gasping loudly.
John glanced sideways at Sherlock. As annoyed as Sherlock was pretending to be, John knew he was thrilled. Finally, a
The Doctor walked to the door, touched the handle, then stopped. “I have a hunch. …Want to take the first look, Sherlock?”
Jim looked down at himself as if seeing the blood for the first time. His lip curled in disgust. “No…” He ran a finger across on one of the stains, which hadn’t dried, then looked at his red hand. “I
“Not all, but the end result was the same,” John said, working off his shirt with some difficulty. He didn’t want to undress in front of Jim, but redressing so he could see his son had taken higher priority.
John frowned at the idea. He hadn’t the slightest notion of how homosexuality was viewed in Victorian England. Was it even legal? He doubted it was at all acceptable.  “But—she might quit. She might be so uncomfortable that she quits working for Arthur. She could spread gossip about it on the street and ruin your name. No more clients. Is that what you want?”
“This way, doc.” The man grabbed the back of John’s neck and began steering him through a labyrinth of rooms, small spaces crammed with pillowed sofas and low chairs, most of them occupied by glassy-eyed people clutching at hookahs.
“By all means, continue your dinner,” Sherlock said, then disappeared into his and John’s room, knowing John wouldn’t follow him while Mary was around. Irritated and somewhat injured, he buried himself in some case accounts he was re-writing, all the while listening to John’s and Mary’s conversation. John was being his usual charming self, perhaps not meaning to be flirtatious but coming off that way anyway. It felt like ages before the sounds of dinner plates being stacked and cleared filled the next room and the door to the flat finally opened and closed.
“Spooky stone angels?” Sherlock asked Lestrade dully. Lestrade opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock cut him off. “Woman named Charlotte Hayle left me three voicemails. My question is, is the police force so incompetent that they don’t investigate the strange appearance of large statues that are causing someone sincere distress?”
“Oh, but you were never able to deduce how I felt about you from all the insights you gathered from that tie index you made?” John asked sarcastically.
In lieu of an answer, Sherlock kissed John again, pulling John closer to him, one hand at the small of his back, the other wrapping under John’s ear and pulling at the back of his neck.
The two stood, looking at each other for a brief moment, then it was as if a switch was flipped. The two men hurled themselves at each other and slammed into each other, desperately grabbing the other to make sure the other really was, in fact, there.
“What on earth d’you—I don’t date dull women! None of them is ever going to live up to the Glorious Intellect of Sherlock Holmes, you know. One genius is more than enough to deal with.” Sherlock smiled a bit at this.
Sherlock smiled, resisting the urge to kiss him, and Hamish clamped a hand over his mouth to stifle his giggling.
A portly, confused-looking man opened the door at the address Hamish and given them. A toddler was at his heels.
“Pocket universe, remember?” The Doctor said amiably. “You have to meet the angels before you get sent back in time. And you
John already felt lightheaded from the smoke, but he didn’t waste time in stalking up to Moriarty and yanking him to his feet by his lapels. “Where is he?
He moved his arms up to brace his body against the headboard in front of him, becoming overwhelmed as Jim pushed into him deeply, coming with a groan inside of John.
John was doubled over, clutching his stomach and trying to breathe. When he regained an ounce of breath, he clouded over with rage. “You want me to fight back?! Is that an
John wasn't prepared for the fist to his stomach, which sent him doubling over, gasping. Jim wandered behind him, slowly trailing a finger from one of John's bare shoulders to the other, then without warning grabbed John's neck, forcing him upright.
“I’ve been saving up,” John said, glowing with pride as he watched Sherlock pull out the bow. Sherlock looked down its length before tightening it and running the rosin over the  horsehairs before bringing the violin to his shoulder and lovingly drawing out a few notes, his eyes closed.
John’s instinct was to leave Jim to rant until he felt better, but it occurred to him that perhaps Jim wanted to voice his complaints to someone. And John was the only one he could complain to. John sighed and sank into a wing-backed chair facing the sofa.
century was the reputation he’d built up over the years. It had taken a long time building up the connections with the Yard, getting the privilege to enter crime scenes, to give his opinions and look at evidence. It was driving him mad, being a nobody in the detective world.
Sherlock gave him a sad smile. “Right.” He cleared his coat pockets of his keys, wallet, and phone, which would be useless in 1895, and stashed his magnifying glass, whatever food would fit in his pockets, and an antique telescope he might be able to hawk for some money.
John mumbled something. He didn’t know a single thing about Coptic art other than what Hamish had just told him. He’d just been looking for another likely-empty room so he and Sherlock could continue their snog. He considered shooing Hamish off—despite what the boy said, the school group was bound to notice him missing eventually, and the teachers would likely frown on him hanging around with two strange men.
By the time Jim awoke, John had laid him on his bed, and it took him some time to remember what had happened. The pain in his shoulder was a convenient reminder, especially when he took deep breaths and the skin pulled at the wound, worsening the pain.
The Doctor’s face looked grave, those deep-set eyes in his young face looking very old. “I can’t tell you. I really very sorry. Stay together when the angels come. And—never thought I’d say this—make sure you blink!”
“We could run,” Sherlock said. “Hail a cab, keep our eyes on it until we’re well away. Not a permanent solution, of course.” But it was the only one he could think of at the moment.
Sherlock glanced at the clock mantel. He had let the time slip away. John and Hamish both should have been back at least an hour ago. He clenched his jaw briefly. “Obvious.” He muttered under his breath. “Stupid…you want me in exchange for them.” It was a tired ploy, but he’d fallen for it all the same. Sherlock berated himself as he grabbed his coat. What a fool he’d been. Moriarty out on the loose, and he’d completely neglected John and Hamish. “Well, I won’t disappoint.”
“Of course, I’ll tell the kitchen.” He left the room and returned a moment later. “They’ll start dinner preparations at once. John—a word?”
Mary timidly entered the room a moment later, keeping close to the doorway. “Mr. Holmes…?” she ventured.
When Jim lunged forward to swing at John again, John ducked and swung his legs out to trip him, sending him sprawling to the floor. John was on top of him before he could get up, pinning his wrists to the floor. “Friendly word of advice, boss, don’t pick fights with your hit men!”
John and Sherlock gave the flat a final sweep with their eyes, and they tramped downstairs. “Mrs. Hudson, if we don’t come back up, don’t come looking for us, just call the police,” Sherlock called into Mrs. Hudson’s flat.
The Doctor sat across from him and John leaned his back on the mantel, arms folded. “I said before that you two didn’t make sense, that your lives were in the wrong time. I was wrong—sort of. This place that we are now, it’s sort of a pocket in the universe.” Apparently unable to sit, the Doctor rose and began pacing, rattling off, “Like a secret pocket full of histories about to be rewritten. Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey, and all that.”
When John rang his phone only minutes later, he answered in a panic, knowing it took John longer to cool down, and that he wouldn’t call while angry unless there was an emergency. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
If it had been on behalf of anyone else, John would’ve walked away and left her in peace, but this was
On their first meeting, the Doctor said, he had lifted a hair off Sherlock’s coat and had attempted to create a DNA replication in the TARDIS.
John coughed at the fumes, finding it increasingly difficult to keep his eyes focused. He struggled to stay alert. “Where is my son, and what do you want?”
John pulled away and muttered a string of obscenities after him. “Well, so much for tolerance,” he grumbled, then sighed and caught Sherlock’s eye. “Anywhere else you want to go?”
John and Sherlock looked at each other, and Craig rose and picked up Alfie, apparently sensing that they needed to talk. “I’ll just be in the kitchen if you need me,” he said, then disappeared.
John came, panting and biting down on his gag. Magnussen was right. He hadn’t even needed a touch. The mere thought of Sherlock knowing that he fantasized about him was humiliating enough to send John over the edge. He could feel the dampness in his trousers and was nearly on the edge of tears, panting and seething through the gag.
Sherlock was perched in his chair, grimacing at the fireplace. “Mmm, I wish there was. Let me know if there’s anything in the paper worth mentioning. And by that, I mean at
Jim pressed his hips against John, his fist clenched in his hair to keep him close. John’s eyes widened as he felt the beginning of Jim’s erection against him.
“Go on then.” John’s eyes are closed, but he can feel Sherlock smile against his throat. He can’t resist the opportunity to show off.
There in the feather soft darkness with the birds out the window, singing crystal notes out into the rising August heat, your tongues softly meet. A block away the tourists will have already started lining up to get into the museum and tyres on the hot pavement make a sibilant hissing sound from the open windows down the hall.
“I love you John,” Sherlock whispered, then leaned back onto the bed, pulling John on top of him, still kissing.
Sherlock stepped in. “Will you please get your hands off him? This is entirely our fault—we got to talking him and proved a distraction. We’ll escort him.”
“It said so on your identity card. That’s one of the reasons we match.” He pushed a stack of clothes back into the suitcase. “Why’s
Hamish broke into sobs and Sherlock hugged them both, together for the first time in almost fourteen months, pressing his cheek against Hamish's head. “We're here, we're here now.”
Sherlock looked over to John, then turned around to face the cellar door. Hamish kept a tight grip on his fathers’ hands as they climbed the stairs and stepped into what used to be—or what
"It's not. This is all me. It's not such a bad existence, you'd be surprised." She looked adoringly at Elton. "And I have him."
"If anyone would know something about some secretive government branch that deals with time-traveling alien doctors, it would be my dear brother," he muttered to John as he waited for Mycroft to answer.
The more he thought about it, though, the more flustered he became, and found that he couldn’t retain any words he was reading in the paper.
John’s heart went out to the soft-spoken housekeeper, who was just as trapped as John was. He reached out to touch her face with one hand, his voice gentle. “Jane, please, I’ll take care of it.” When he removed his hand he was horrified to see that he’d left a smear of blood on her cheek. He wiped it off with a dishrag, muttering apologies, then took the mop and quickly scrubbed up, disgusted with himself. He ruefully thought of Lady Macbeth, obsessively washing her hands, trying to get rid of the unseen bloodstains. John could relate. He would never be able to scrub out all the blood, even if he scoured the entire house and himself spotless.
John could feel Jim’s eyes on him as he examined the bloodstains in the shirt. “How bad is my back?”
Sherlock pulled away long enough to raise an eyebrow down at John. “Is that so? Take off your belt.” He clamped his mouth against John’s, arching his back away from him so John could obey.
As soon as Mrs. Hudson was gone, Hamish burst out, taking a croissant. “An animal? Do you think it’s a fox? Can I come look?”
Sherlock restrained John as he lunged forward again, then smirked at Jim. “We’ll be keeping a close eye on
Sherlock wondered where this rant from John was coming from. Had he been bottling this all up for a long time? Sherlock had several suspicions about John, but he’d never brought them to light for long, in fear that it would put a strain on their friendship, which he deeply valued.
“Don’t be foolish—you’ll be admitted right along with me!” He tossed John his coat. “Come on John! There are aliens to catch!”
“How was this possible? He’s nine and a half and John and I have only known each other for two years. Even taking time travel into account, it’s simply
The interviewer was well impressed with John’s medical background, which he’d been mostly truthful with, changing a few dates and details to fit the time period.
John blinked at him sorrowfully. He wanted desperately to sleep, to wake up and have this all melt away as a strange, terrible dream. “Will I get to say goodbye?” he repeated.
John rolled his eyes. “Great logic, boss.” Jim was too drug-addled to do anything to him at the moment. He settled onto the floor.
John dropped his hands, startled at how fucked-up his whole situation with Moriarty had been. The worst thing was that he’d gotten used to it; being an object for Jim had become second nature. “Sherlock, I…what if I’ve forgotten how to do this? How to be normal? When I walk down the street I still…I still catch myself looking at target points instead of people. What do I do?” John looked up at him desperately.
Sherlock finally stopped pacing. "Too early to say." He disappeared to his room, murmuring to himself.
“We’re recently been enlightened in our view of how time works as well,” Sherlock pointed out. “But even if our DNA
Hamish sniffed and nodded, wiping his nose off on his sleeve. “Are—are we going to live here now? Is this…Professor Moriarty’s house?”
John hefted the rug and body through the back door. He had already arranged for accomplices to dispose of the body. He met them in the alleyway, paid them their sum, then returned to the kitchen.
John leaned down to give Hamish a tight hug. “That professor Moriarty? I don’t care how nice he seems.
After they’d disappeared out the door, Mary went to the window to watch the consulting detective and the doctor stride down Baker Street with the inspector, ready for every crime and every adventure.
“Glad my assumption was correct.” He swallowed and flicked his eyes sideways to Jim.                   “Is there—is there something that I haven’t been doing that would make you happy, boss?”
John suppressed a shiver. Jim Moriarty had the singular talent of making his every move and word terrifying. He wasn’t sure how he was going to be able to convince such a twisted man that he even somewhat liked him. “Do you need anything from me, Jim?”
John’s mouth was dry as he examined the bullet wounds. It wasn’t a lethal shot by any means, but Jim had lost a great deal of blood. What if he couldn’t save him? Would Jim’s men ever believe him? There wasn’t an exit wound for either bullet, so he carefully extracted the second bullet, then cleaned, disinfected, and tidily patched up the wounds with some neat stitches.
a character from a book, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t real.  But the stories about you got so famous that you became stuff of legend. Worthy of a museum, and so much more.”
The man was still grinning obscenely at him. John wanted to punch him, but he merely spat out, “Lead on, you stupid wretch.”
They bid Elton goodbye, still stunned by the woman in the concrete slab. John suggested they walk a bit before catching a cab. He most certainly needed air. "Sherlock. Just…what are we dealing with here? Because I just saw something impossible back there and now we're chasing a time-traveling alien."
You like the way it feels in your mouth, the friction of your breath forming the single syllable. The way your lips form the slightest kiss when you say it.
The book slots into place and he picks up another from the cart (he’ll have to go back later and fix them, but that’s a problem for future John), remembering: the man in his arms. John could have cut himself on the sluice of his cheekbones and the angle of his jaw. Ran his lips over them to try, like a knife along a whetstone, the desire inside him sharpening to a pin-point ache. The man tasted of sweat, of cologne, of something saccharinely sweet. John had sucked it from his tongue, whatever the man had been drinking, peach and lime and rum, and licked the salt from his throat. One hand on the man’s waist, one hand wound up in his hair, the black curls slipping like silky threads through his fingers, as he brought the man’s mouth down to his own.
“I don’t want to stay in a bed and breakfast,” Sherlock bites out. “I want to stay here, in our home, and I—“
This time Sherlock meets him with his tongue, and John groans, opening his mouth and leaning in until their bodies are flush against each other, John resting in between Sherlock’s legs, his back bowed as Sherlock arches over him. Sherlock’s mouth is hot and wet, his tongue silky and insistent against John’s own. He tastes of figs and milk tea; sweetly sharp. John threads his hands into Sherlock’s hair. Holds on. The soft skin of Sherlock’s cheeks juxtaposed against the sandpaper strafe of the stubble along his jaw is sending tiny thrills scintillating along John’s nerve endings. It’s new. Different. And more than a little exhilarating.
He wraps his hand around you, swiping his thumb over the sensitive head, and you cry out. Pleasure coils deep in your navel, radiating out down your thighs. The heat of his fist and the tight slick clutch of his hand and the way he’s pushing into you, his fat velvety crown hitting your prostate over and over, it takes one stroke, two, and then you’re spilling over his fingers, painting the headboard in your come, the walls ringing with your shout.
Who knows what he would have said if we had not be interrupted. I still wonder about it years later. If fate had not intervened in that moment would I have finally gotten what I wanted? For him to grow as tired of me as I was of myself and leave me finally and for good? It was exhausting trying to be the man he believed me to be. It was one of the most tiresome parts of marriage surely. That you are constantly forced to confront yourself. When I lived alone I could be as human as I pleased. A malcontent. A misanthropic narcissist. Now, married ten years, I had to constantly reform myself, to compromise and collaborate and control my bad habits. At times it seemed an impossible task. But I tried for him. For him I would do anything required. It did not mean that I didn’t consummately fail at it it at times.
He turns around and picks up the bag at his feet. He holds it open, staring in incomprehension at it’s jumbled contents.
“That’s really kind of you, but I wouldn’t want—” John said, his eyes darting between Sherlock and Zoe.
Or about that day in Bart’s with Stamford your unwitting ally, giving you one last chance. And over the months that followed, you wooing him with thrill and danger and trust and reminding him reminding him reminding him who he was? Will he tell her about the morning in July when he came down the stairs at Baker Street and kissed you, so so softly, hello?
It is the softest kiss of Sherlock’s life and it completely and utterly destroys him. Shatters and levels him, remakes him. There is the man he was before this moment, alone, and there is the man he is now. All of his armour is stripped away, he is utterly vulnerable, he is taking the biggest risk of his life and yet he has never felt more secure. Whatever comes they’ll face it together. Whatever comes they’ll meet it united. And if the worst was to happen they will die knowing they did everything they could.
The man in the mirror is muttering incoherent nonsense, “God, yes, just like that. Oh fuck, Sherlo—ck, fuck me. Harder. Yes. Harder. Oh, God, oh please, please.”
Sherlock spreads his feet wider and bends at the waist, hands braced once more against the window pane. John watches as his cheeks part and there, nestled between them, is the matte black plug that John has inserted inside him that morning before they’d left for work.
Sherlock flinches, just a brief twitch at the corners of his eyes, but it tells John all he needs to know.
The only thing that came to mind was Mycroft’s birthday six, seven years ago. The Opera. Which one? He couldn’t even recall. A Bellini perhaps. A Rossini. Italian, that was all he could be sure of.
I looked over at you then. You were pale in the pearl gray light, your eyes holding mine without artifice. I saw then, what you were really saying to me. Fear sluiced through me, hard and bright.
“It was, in fact, not I who rang the authorities,” Mycroft said. “Your therapist was concerned when you weren’t answering your phone.”
“Well?” John says, after a bit. After Sherlock has slipped out of him, flaccid, unspent, after he has curled up next to John, wrapped himself all around him, his ear pressed to John’s heart. “Any better?”
“I accept that. And, just to be clear, you want to continue to have a physical relationship with me, with the understanding that at any time, my protection is available without it?”
John’s mouth is soft when he brushes it against Sherlock’s. His beard skimming beneath Sherlock’s nose and across his chin, raising sparks to the surface of his skin.
“Sherlock, I want you.” He’s panting. The words are forced out through clenched teeth. “Please. I want your cock inside me. Now.”
The orchestra was reaching the end of the allegro, the music was frantic and matched the racing of my heart.
Your name in the dark and the quiet, in the shushed intimate whisper of his voice, it startles you. Your mind stutters to a halt.
John was in the sitting room reading, socked feet sticking out from under an afghan, a cold cup of tea balanced on the armrest beside him, his reading glasses perched low on his nose. They were tortoiseshell and he looked positively devastating in them, but I had other things on my mind just then and so I ignored the urge to have him there on the sofa, and went to crouch before our empty hearth.
John pushes the cock inside, pulling back a little, but keeping one hand anchored around the back of Sherlock’s neck, just far enough to allow for the angle and watches as the bow of Sherlock’s lips stretches into a pink heart around John’s girth.
Now John tells him as often as he can. And if this is the last time, well, then Sherlock won’t ever have to wonder how John felt about him.
“Something happened at the surgery,” I said, my eyes flicking up and down his body. “Something to make it shut down suddenly. Power outage, chemical spill…”
John takes a moment to look around the room, anywhere but at Sherlock, nodding politely, as Molly tells him about her new boyfriend. The room is uncharacteristically full of people. Med students from the look of them, harried and feral. There are about ten of them, all bent over identical microscopes, all jotting down notes as they go.
The most spectacular shag of John Watson’s life. In the flesh. Looking stunning, looking posh, looking ten thousand kilometers out of John's league. The elegant length of him poured into slim-fitted gray trousers, a tight white tee-shirt, and a black leather bomber jacket. Looking just as cool and untouchable as when John had first seen him leaning against the bar the night before.
“Don’t be sorry,” Sherlock whispers, turning to push the length of his warm body into John’s. “I loved it.”
John pushes himself away and takes two steps back. “Oh, and I’m going to need to take a long bath in your mum’s ridiculously gigantic tub when I get home. I feel like you’re still inside me and it’s bloody disconcerting. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder to see if you’ve snuck up and stuck your cock in me or something.”
John was wearing a thick, tan, canvas coat and red plaid pyjama trousers, a blue scarf wound a few times haphazardly around his neck. The cold air had reddened his cheeks and the tip of his nose. “I’m ok. I was thinking about tonight and was wondering if we should switch things up a bit.”
“Yes, well I am not a fool,” I said. “When I meet the most extraordinary man I’ve ever laid eyes on, one who is intelligent and brave and kind and capable and devastatingly handsome, I do not let him go. It is only logical you see.”
On the drive home Sherlock rolled down the window and let the scent of the rain soaked fields wash over him. He focused on the small gifts of the day: the way Mozart sung so brightly through his body, biscuits and tea with a friend, the fact that he hadn’t torn down a man who’s granddaughter was dying.
, and repocketed his phone. Laying aside his shovel, he went to sit on his front porch steps as John made his way up the drive.
“I trust you,” Sherlock says, sure now, of maybe only this, choosing this, this one simple thing. It feels paltry, it feels infinitesimal, compared to what John is giving him, but it makes John’s mouth go crooked, in a disbelieving sort of smile, a grateful sort of smile, a purely happy smile.
“It’s a nocturne,” Sherlock explains softly, something like self-consciousness etched in the lines around his eyes. “Entirely derivative of Sarasate, I admit, but with my own touches here and there.”
This thing he was asking of me, this promise, had seemed silly and unnecessary only a moment ago, but the question of my own moral turpitude still lingered, and so I said, “I promise. I promise.”
“I’ll fetch Charlotte,” John said, his hand dropping down by his side. “She’ll probably be ready for her bed too.”
“It’s a lot for anyone to handle, John. Go easy on yourself. Give yourself some time to figure out what you want.”
Sherlock, freshly showered, dressed casually but with precision—shirt pressed and a shade of blue which he knew paired quite spectacularly with his eyes—waited three beats before he rose from the kitchen table and opened the door.
“No, this is good,” John says, preferring the way Sherlock has done it, with John’s arms bracketing his ears and his hands above his head. It mitigates how exposed John feels.
“That I won’t leave. It feels like— he says I love you, alright? Every night, right before we fall asleep. He says it like he’s ticking it off a list. I know, I know, he means it. But, he’s said hasn’t he? He’s said that he doesn’t know how to go about it, the love bit. And it feels like insecurity, yeah? Like he’s uncertain of me. Or, of us. Like he feels like if he doesn’t say it, it won’t be real. I want him to know it’s real.”
The temperature had already risen a few degrees celsius by the time he went back outside. His fleece vest and flannel shirt would be enough to resist what chill still lingered. After placing his satchel containing his lunch, water bottle, last year’s bee journal in addition to a fresh one, pens, a copy of Langstroth’s
I moaned and arched reflexively into the touch, my hand settling on the back of your head, pushing you down into the wet curls, as she would have pushed my head down into the soft thatch of black hair, coiling against the tip of my nose as I nuzzled at her.
John feels all the blood in his body flood up, biting hot in his chest and face. He grits his teeth. “Sherlock.”
His eyes are thick with pupil when you pull away, dreamy and unfocused. You brush his brow with your mouth. Run it over his eyelids. His lashes. His temples. His cheeks. You take away all evidence of his tears.
The head, his head, the head of his cock, gets caught on the rim, on the rim, on the entrance to, to Sherlock, and
I shivered as John’s warm breath tickled my skin. I cast my eyes down into my lap where John’s hand was resting on my thigh, his fingers drawing small, tantalizing circles higher and higher up my leg.
They lie together for a moment, just breathing. The air is sweet with the resin of the fir tree. It burns, like a cinder, in the back of John’s nose. He’s not sure why it matters so much, Sherlock setting up this whole thing, but it does somehow. He pictures it in his mind. Sherlock leaving the surgery. Picking out a tree. Buying lights and ornaments. Decorating. It makes John’s chest feel too small to contain the feeling swelling inside him. Gratitude and love. The backs of his eyes grow hot and sting. No one’s ever done something so simple, and so kind, and so thoughtful for him before. John hadn’t expected it. Least of all from Sherlock.
John, who has been waiting for the prat for the better part of an hour, slides his hands inside Sherlock’s suit coat, the silk lining slick against the backs of his hands, and fists them in his shirt, dragging him in to snog him deep and wet and thorough.
Madhur Jaffry’s famous cookbook from the 1970’s, sits open in his lap, the recipe for samosas with mint chutney offering itself up for perusal, but the words don’t land, John’s thoughts on the events of the previous day.
“John,” you say, a bare exhale, wracked by feeling. It cracks through you, fault lines you didn’t know were there, splitting, opening you up for him. You wonder if he can see it in your eyes. You wonder if you should hide it, if you even could.
“Ah,” he says, as if this makes perfect sense. And then, teasing, fond, “You’re one of the mad ones aren’t you?”
John settles down between Sherlock’s legs, mirroring what Sherlock had done before, being careful not to get too close to any of his limbs.
“Kneel on the bed for me,” John says, quiet, but firm. He watches as Sherlock, eyes pupil-black, lips ruby-red, and legs rubber-kneed, does as he is told.
Two fingers up to the second knuckle stretching him, impossibly, wider. Around the beads and further still.
Sherlock stood in line at the Tesco lost in thought. He alternated between righteous indignation and self-awareness alarmingly quickly. It was making his head spin and his body feel dysregulated. He was in the grip of shame and reactive anger and trying desperately to process the two.
If there had been any mention of foulbrood at the last meeting he would have treated his hives with terramycin after he had removed the last of his supers in August instead of waiting for the fall. It baffled Sherlock that there was no trace of foulbrood in the area. Where had it come from? Had a swarm from another beekeeper’s hives turned feral been infected and spread it to his hives through robbing? But then why hadn’t it been mentioned at the meeting? Had one of his foragers picked it up from an infected hive and brought it home? But upon inspecting his notes he found no evidence for this. He regularly checked the woods surrounding the Edicott farm for swarms. There had been none present on his walkthrough in September and Oliver had reported the same for his surrounding area.
Sherlock looked into John’s eyes.  “I missed you.” He sat up himself, John straddling his thighs, and kissed him again, pulling him close. John pushed into the kiss, gripping Sherlock’s back, relishing the feel of his spine and shoulder blades.
my dear! As much as I could go on about how amusing that is, I really must be off. We wouldn’t want my men to think you’d done something nasty to me and prematurely slit John’s throat, would we? How embarrassing!”
Sherlock gave a short, annoyed sigh. “I haven’t got a favorite dish. Eating for enjoyment expends energy that could be spent on more productive things. It’s transport. Fuel. Nothing more.
“Doctor, don’t say things like that, or his head will get too big for the flat. That’s what Dad says all the time.”
When Sherlock called the number of Jack Harkness, it took several tries before a boisterous American voice answered. "Y-ello?"
It was a good while before John could collect himself enough to draw back, wiping his own tears and then wiping off Hamish’s. “This isn’t the time for crying now, son. We need to be brave together, like soldiers. Can you be brave for me, Hamish?”
Jim kept his hand tightened at John’s throat as he began pumping, the roughness from the lack of lube creating a mixture of pain and pleasure.
Sherlock muttered, darkly picking up the tiny metal revolver. “Real crimes haven’t got stupid rules like this.”
PREPARE FOR A CHAPTER DUMP!! Imma finish posting this TONIGHT. have the whole fic. RIGHT NOW. That's right.
"What, with that device on your arm? Let me see that." Sherlock seized his arm and began to examine the manipulator. He'd never seen anything else like it. "How on earth does a 'time vortex manipulator' even work? How do you know this Doctor in the first place? How do you contact him?"
He was entirely and completely in love with Sherlock. It seemed so obvious a statement now, but the kiss had sealed it. The only kiss he would ever have with him. This thought haunted John until dawn.
Magnussen gave a light giggle. “See, I love this. He doesn’t know what’s coming next, and he is wrestling with how he feels about it. You can see, can’t you? How his little brain is struggling with it all?”
John gave Sherlock a sideways look. Sherlok kept his face stoic as he asked, "Of course. Where from?"
Sherlock slowly pushed open the door and gaped at the Baker Street before him, which was milling with horse-drawn carriages, people in Victorian clothing, urchins, and carts heaped with produce or coal. The air was thick and foul, but it was definitely Baker Street.
Jim groaned louder, then seized the hair at the sides of John’s hair and yanked his head back and forth, fucking John’s mouth, then shoved John away, shuddering as he came over John’s shoulder.
In addition to the paranoia, Sherlock was getting bored. Aside from the angels, there had been few cases, and now more than ever he needed some good crime to stimulate his mind.
“Until the money from my job starts coming in, we’re going to be in a tight spot,” John said, looking up at Sherlock. “Pick-pocketing might have to do us for a while, unless you happen to catch a criminal and collect a reward.”
It was only a couple minutes’ walk to the café, but by the time Sherlock arrived, Jack was already at a table with a coffee. Sherlock couldn’t help coveting a time vortex manipulator of his own.
you!” Sherlock clawed his hands greedily down John’s back, wanting to touch every part of him at once.
When he left the flat with a long kiss, it was mutually understood that he would be back with boxes of his things.
"11-year-old boy, scared witless in a war zone and running for his life? Unlikely," Sherlock muttered.
“Craig and Sophie? You lived with them?” The Doctor knelt on the cobblestones to look Hamish over, touching his shoulder.
your friend. You can’t trust him. He’s going to try to be a father to you, and maybe it will be best if you put a trusting attitude on around him, but
Sherlock frowned. “I knowingly put myself in dangerous situations, John. You don’t have to try to protect me.”
John slid his hand up Sherlock’s shirt and tentatively touched the top button, then began slowly unbuttoning his shirt, moving his lips up to gently kiss Sherlock’s closed eyelids. “I love you too,” he murmured. The words felt so good, and he’d gone so long without saying them that he said it again. “I love you.”
John pulled and twisted at his wrists, but Sherlock held them fast. He writhed under the man, his heart racing. He’d never wanted Sherlock more. He craned his head up to try to catch his lips with his own, but Sherlock leaned back, not allowing John to make contact.
“Where shall we go? The park?” John said, trying to be cheerful. It was a gorgeous spring day, and John was trying hard to shove back the constant fear of being tossed into the past in the blink of an eye. He wanted to enjoy a beautiful day in 2012 London while he could.
Sherlock layered one forearm over the other, keeping the ushiro takatekote posture steady by gripping John's elbows and holding them in place.
Watson didn't even question how Sherlock knew, or that he did, just shook his head and got into the cab. Sherlock followed after him, sliding in a bit closer than propriety typically allowed, and laid a hand on his thigh. "221B Baker Street."
John was silent for a moment, the shift in his muscles denoting his deliberation, before he nodded his head. "Yes, Sherlock."
"John," Watson said suddenly, and Sherlock looked up at him from his crouch. He knew the picture he painted: the flush of his own cheeks, the colour of his eyes surrounded by his makeup, the plumpness of his lips, so close to Watson's erection. He smiled and Watson's breath hitched.
John nodded his head emphatically as Sherlock rolled the condom on and placed the tip of his cock against the stretched hole, but all of John's pretty words had apparently turned back into half-sobs. Sherlock reached through the ropes to fist a hand in John's hair and pull his head up to make eye contact.
His own body felt like it was vibrating, the low, buzzing frequency of his arousal rising in a fever pitch to a discordant impatience at the base of his spine. Sensation after sensation piled upon one another, leaving Sherlock in a frazzled state that chipped away at his mind, leaving him only with the matter. The matter of needing to come, of needing to feel John come around him.
John reached over to pick up his small jug of oil and tipped some over his cock, slicking the way for the roughness of his hand. "Then come over here and strip," he commanded, beckoning.
"What do you want to do first?" John asked him with that warm smile of his that made Sherlock's heart do something peculiar.
"Such a good boy you are for me, Sherlock," John said, finally pulling away and leaving Sherlock shaking on the bed, fingers curling in the sheets to keep from closing his arms against John's ministrations. "The perfect patient." His face flushed hot from the praise, but he didn't have time to formulate a response, if he could have. John was dripping lubrication onto his fingers. "Let's get you prepared for the big boy thermometer."
"You've seen me fight?" John asked, pushing his finger in and demanding the muscles to yield to his will.
"Arms behind your back," Sherlock commanded, speaking for the first time in long minutes. It made his voice stand out in the quiet of the room, and it made John shiver. But he did as he was told.
As the next two months progressed, Sherlock learned through his Irregulars as well as his own shadowing that the man's name was Dr John Watson, he lived alone in a bedsit he had a hard time paying for, had breakfast with his alcoholic sister every other Sunday, was having poor luck finding a permanent position at a GP's, was a bit suicidal, and a lot attracted to crime scenes. Sherlock spotted him on the fringes of an active scene no less than five additional times, though he didn't see him at Bart's after the first time. Despite the added notes to his mental file, Sherlock was frustrated that he was no closer to solving the puzzle that was Dr Watson.
Harsh breaths stirred the air and Sherlock's sweat-damp curls as John luxuriated in the fading ecstasy of his orgasm and the easing ripples of the muscles around his cock. His release left him feeling pleased and relaxed, but with a growing awareness that his position, suspended over the youth's trembling body, was not conducive to true relaxation. Without so much as a grunt of effort normally required by the maneuver as done with older lovers, John easily kept the boy on his cock as he brought Sherlock's scant weight with him when he rocked backwards onto his heels, keeping his momentum until he fell against the wall.
Surprised into silence, John sat back on his heels, blinking. "I thought you a child of Diana but it would seem you're might be a child of Apollo," he murmured, the boy's high speech suddenly making more sense as a vision from the gods.
"You really are a godsend, John." There was a small quiver in her voice that made Sherlock uncomfortable but he didn't know why.
Sherlock!"s John was chanting. But his patience had evaporated with the incoming tide of his orgasm, and suddenly he needed to come and he needed to come
Master, being the master, turned his head freely to look, head tilting as if taking in the boy whose hair was so dark and skin so pale as to be a child of Diana. "You there!" he called, and though none of the servants were 'looking', they all knew who their master meant.
John sobered, but his breaths remained heavy bursts of air that wafted across the length of Sherlock's arm through the mesh. His soldier took a long, steady breath, visibly trying to pull himself together, and then nodded slowly, once. "Yes, Sherlock."
Sherlock jerked and whimpered at the sensation, but John didn't stop that time either. He didn't stop when Sherlock did the same thing on the next pull out-push in, or the one after that. He just kept smiling that soft smile, the one that meant that he was pleased with Sherlock, and Sherlock hung onto that image even when he began to feel weird. So weird that he tried to pull himself away from the feeling, tried to push John off, to completely disengage his penis. But John just smiled even more warmly and carefully settled his weight over Sherlock to keep him pinned.
The crime scene was an average six, but for once, it wasn't the lack of interesting components that kept pulling at Sherlock's attention.
The first touch to his penis, a simple brush of the callous on John's thumb, from tree climbing, Sherlock had long ago deduced, made Sherlock shiver intensely. He couldn't help the way he curled in on himself, the touch still new and familiar, even though this wasn't the first time John had practiced doctoring on him. He didn't wait for John to raise his eyebrow at him before he forced his arms and legs back down to the bed, and he got a kiss to his lips in reward.
"Are you nervous?" John asked, reclining naked on his cot - it sometimes felt more natural to be without clothes than with, being that he spent most of his time training or fighting, and all of that in a loincloth at most. In opposition, his catamite stood across the room still dressed, eyes downcast as if avoiding the way John was slowly stroking his cock to life. Not that it needed the help, with how excited he was, but the touch was pleasant either way, the stroke of his callouses against the delicate skin.
Slowly, Sherlock mouthed his way down Watson's neck, pleased when the man tilted his head to give him more room. He kept his lips to the tanned skin as he began to unbutton the stiff shirt, his lips and tongue soft, his teeth barely a whisper of pressure. With every disc that slid through its fastening, the looser the collar got, until it was falling off Watson's shoulders. And with every centimeter of shoulder revealed, the heavier Watson became, the more weight he delivered into Sherlock's hold, trusting Sherlock to keep him upright. The simple act of removing a shirt had become something sensual, intimate, and it made Sherlock's heart thrum in his chest.
"What a successful checkup. Good job, Sherlock," he said, ruffling Sherlock's hair. "And now, my payment." Sherlock's smile made it hard to purse his lips, but he finally did it, and John leaned forward to press a kiss to them. "Good boy. And what do you say?"
Sherlock crouched to pull Watson's pants down slowly, revealing bit-by-bit the thick erection that had been tenting the soft fabric. It was only the thought of his plan that kept him from putting his mouth on it. Hopefully, he would have a chance later. When, at last, pants and socks joined trousers and shirt, John was completely bare, without so much as his dog tags to shield any bit of himself from Sherlock.
"Are you ready to get your temperature checked?" John asked, something strange to his smile, like always.
"How- how so, Sherlock?"he gasped, managing to remember his manners even when nearly-overcome with pleasure.
Sherlock smiled back and slowly walked John backwards with a gentle pressure against his chest until they stood beneath the suspension rigging. Suspension was a delicate procedure, even without a previously-injured party to consider, and Sherlock took care to be excruciatingly precise in the lay of ropes and in weight distribution. It took longer than he would have liked, long enough that John's erection had wilted just a little, and Sherlock's quite a bit, thankfully relieving some of the pressure in the front of his trousers, but at last, John was hanging at the perfect height, halfway between lying horizontally in the ropes and reclining in them.
"That's right," John said, sitting in the bathtub with Sherlock in his lap, situating him just right before leaning forward to turn the taps. "Patient confidentiality."
"Fuck," John growled, leaving behind the imprint of his mouth in the soft, pale skin as all the heat of Vesuvius flooded his being. His release was primed and he just needed-
"It's alright, Mrs. Holmes," John assured with a warm smile that never failed to make Sherlock blink. "You go look after your mum. Mine doesn't have a problem letting me stay the night and taking Sherlock to school in the morning."
"Yes, Sherlock." John had begun to tremble minutely, little shakes moving up his spine and across his shoulders, raising the light hairs on his skin. His posture, however, remained impeccable.
The soldier rocked back on his heels, hostility, surprisingly, melting into surprise. "Then I want to know why. I have no money, no possessions, nothing you could want from me…"
He spotted the man limping slowly along the sidewalk, eyeing the wares and delivering smile after declining smile as his limp got worse and the tension ratcheted in the lines of his body. Sherlock had the cabbie drop him off around the corner, out of sight, and he slunk silently and unnoticeably through the shadows to the end of the line, so to speak. He found himself smirking as Watson moved slowly but steadily closer, and he leaned against the brick to wait. He didn't have to wait long.
His doctor slowed when he spotted Sherlock, the last rent boy on the sidewalk, and frowned, confusion clear on his face. Sherlock belatedly realized that it was possible Watson might recognize him, but nothing for it now. It might even help.
John's incoherent babbling suddenly took shape. Or perhaps it had had shape all along and Sherlock was only noticing now. Had his patience been what it had been when he started, perhaps Sherlock would have pressed for a proper answer, something more than the repeated "
"Thank you, Sherlock," John said immediately, and Sherlock ran the pad of his thumb over the curve of thin skin his flick had reddened.
He left Lestrade and Scotland Yard's finest scratching their head and archived the man as he caught a cab back to Baker Street.
Obediently, he raised his arms out to the side, sliding them across his bedspread, like he was making a snow angel like John had taught him last winter.
Sherlock's smirk morphed into a smile. Even if the man was as likely blind as the rest of the world, he appeared to have moments of astuteness. Perfectly lovely. "And if I was?"
"What a good boy, Sherlock," John was murmuring, big hands stroking through Sherlock's hair. "My perfect patient. You take my co- my thermometer better and better every time we practice. My perfect boy."
"It's as if you've been blessed by Mars himself!" Master greeted him jubiously. John bowed his head in both acknowledgement and thanks, but remained silent. His master could be a rather temperamental man, prone to mood shifts too fast to track, and John had no desire to be the cause of a swing to the negative. "Or perhaps Fortuna herself, with all the winnings you have gained me. Well, I did promise a great reward if you managed to win ten contests. Do you desire to become a freedman?"
crime scenes, I'd suspect that it was you doing the following, Doctor," Sherlock replied, evading answering the truth with his own accusation, unfounded though it was. Not that the captain would know.
ed and easily tugged him back down, lazily fucking up into the downward motion and making the boy whimper. "What-?" his little lover slurred, eyes still glazed like he'd been hard at the wine.
Sherlock stared at him as he hooked the fingers of one hand in the ropes over John's belly, and wrapped the other hand around the base of John's cock, ignoring the strangled sound that John produced at the touch. Without breaking eye contact, he tugged John towards him at the same time as he thrust forward.
"No," but this time the boy smiled in return, expression almost smug, teasing John back. But then, to John's slight surprise, he kept talking. "Your knuckles are scarred from the plates, and all your other scars are defensive. Except for this one." Small, thin fingers, touch the gnarled scars on John's shoulder, the middle of the three thicker than the two on either side. "You were distracted - a trident caught your shoulder."
Being bounced on a cock was sure to confuse any catamite, but eventually, John's meaning sunk in and a look of dawning horror and understanding came to light on Sherlock's face. It was enough to send a savage glee through John's heart and a savage grin across his face. His pleasure made him forget himself for a moment and he fucked up harder than he had been, hard enough to make Not Words fall from Sherlock's lips again.
"Let's check your prostate before we check your temperature," John said with a grin, and then proceeded to work Sherlock open with the sort of patience that made it easy to see how he'd made rugby captain.
"How do you feel, John?" Sherlock asked as he pulled a condom and a bottle of lube from his nightstand and dropped the condom onto the small cradle of John's belly. The lube he uncapped and poured into his palm before the bottle joined the foil wrapper.
Sherlock's heart beat hard in his throat but he still nodded and reached up and back to tightly fist his pillow.
Watson blinked a few times, and then his mouth fell open. "Ohhh," he breathed, eyes darkening. "You want-
When at last the only bind left to perform was the futomomo, something that would be best done when John was already suspended, Sherlock stood. He kept a guiding finger under John's bottom forearm and John followed to his feet with the wordless command, the motion smooth and graceful. Sherlock rounded the front of him and felt his breath go unsteady for a moment at the sight of John's chest lined with his diamonds, his cock and balls framed just so with the last diamond in the chain. The explosive size of the scar on his shoulder that screamed 'shot from behind'.
Even though it made his face hot, to spread his legs and expose himself like this, he did as John had asked
"Thank you for my checkup, Dr. John," he said obediently, and he got a warm smile in turn that made him smile even wider.
Sherlock, conversely, had lost the miniscule tremors in his body as he'd sunk deeper into his role. He knelt tall behind John, looking over the man's shoulder as he wrapped John in his arms in a embrace made false by the fact that his fingers were too busy knotting the rope in even spaced segments to make it true. When a line of knotted rope halved John's chest, Sherlock gently eased John's knees, and thighs, apart, until he was satisfied. When Sherlock passed the rope through John's legs, the edge of his hand brushed John's heavy scrotum, and John let out a soft moan that made Sherlock's ignored erection twitch in his trousers.
"You let a complete stranger, one who's admitted to stalking you, take you home and tie you up." John's hole was loosening around his finger, and Sherlock worked in a second one, slowly, carefully, taking care to stretch, to not tear. To not brush the sensitive gland just inside. "You let said stranger tie you up until you were completely immobile. You have no escape routes. I could do anything I wanted to you," Sherlock said lightly, thrusting slowly with each word. He leaned in and dropped his head, breathing a slow, steady,
He didn't even pause to take in the sight before he was binding John's calves to his thighs in the frog tie, and by the time he was tying John's legs apart with more ropes leading up to the suspension, John's cock had filled out once more. It only took Sherlock one look at the picture John made, bound and spread, hole exposed to his gaze, for Sherlock's cock to stiffen once more. The whole tableau was only made more arousing when a flush spread down John's chest under Sherlock's watchful eyes.
John shoved a second finger into the boy, who yelped, short and high, at the stretch. "I thought you said you hadn't seen any of my matches," he said lightly, interested by the boy's near-lordly speech patterns but annoyed that the boy was trying to lie to him.
John smiled, surprised and pleased by the boy's verve, and nodded in concession. "Perhaps not, but I can still rip it off," John said, sitting up and snagging the rough wool of the boy's clothes, making him gasp. John raised an eyebrow and the boy finally acquiesced, hurriedly stripping. It had been some time since John had had a eunuch, and he curiously traced the scar below the boy's small cock, barely larger than John's thumb, even lightly plumped as it was. "Can you sing?"
He'd barely touched the tip of his fingers to Sherlock's tiny cock before the eunuch's arse spasmed tightly around John's cock, pulling his orgasm from his testicles as surely as if John had stripped his cock himself. Unable to help himself, John sank his teeth back into that sweet flesh as pleasure swept through him, his hips rocking and pushing harshly forward to encourage those soft wet muscles to drain him of all his seed.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but when John jerked his hips back and then forward, the sounds that came out were distinctively Not Words, and he almost complimented the eunuch's singing. Instead, John's own mouth was occupied with a vicious grin as he pulled hard on the boy's ankles, bringing his round arse onto John's knees. With the next thrust, Sherlock arched his back into the air, sounds disappeared into a silent, wide-eyed scream.
"Oh? And where do you want it?" Sherlock asked, feigning obliviousness. He finally used his free hand to unbutton and unzip his leather trousers, and he nearly breathed a sigh of relief at the sensation of pulling his erect cock out from the hot, confining fabric and into the cool air of the flat. The tip was wet, like John's, and Sherlock smeared it across the back of one of John's thighs. "Here?" he asked, and John shook his head. "Perhaps here then?" he said next, rutting once into the crease of John's thigh.
Sherlock nodded, but John was no longer looking at him. Instead, his eyes were fixed on the lube he was pouring onto his fingers, working between them to warm up the cold liquid. Still, Sherlock jumped when John's wet fingers traced his sphincter, massaging the muscle until the tip of John's finger sunk in.
He wasn't, but John needed to finish his exam, he got antsy when it took too long, so he nodded. "Yes, Dr. John," he managed, though his voice was a little weak.
There was a man standing on the fringes of the crowd gathered outside the police tape and though everything about him - his face, his hair, his clothes - screamed 'average', his posture was military-perfect and his face was tanned an unusual shade for a London-native. Something about that combination, normal and ex-military, suited the man and simultaneously piqued Sherlock's interest at the incomplete picture he was too far away from to make clear. He nearly pushed through the crowd to get to the stranger, but Lestrade, inopportune as always, chose that moment to grow impatient.
Sherlock made a confused sound at the swell of flesh inside him, small hands planting on John's shoulders, body lifting as if he was going to get off John's cock. John
Sherlock collapsed bonelessly, expression almost shocked, against John's chest, hair tickling John's chest and breath tickling John's nipple as John's hand settled at Sherlock's crack, John's middle finger just long enough to feel where his cock was still piercing the boy. He lazily played with the muscle, tugging at Sherlock's rim, amused by the way it eagerly grabbed at his cock when he let go, as if it couldn't bear the thought of not being plugged up and stuffed with seed and cock. Sherlock's own release was wet and slippery between them and John swept his free fingers through the mess. He painted the seed over a tight pink nipple with calloused fingertips, grinning and shivering from overstimulation when the boy spasmed on his cock, pulling the muscle from the hook of John's finger. Which only encouraged him to do it again and again until his cock started to grow hard again.
John stared at him for a long moment before he finally spoke again. "Tell you what. I'm still coming out of subspace, which is the worst time to ask me anything, so why don't we head to sleep and you can ask me in the morning?"
John's answer was a deep moan, closed eyes, and a full-body shudder that sorely tempted Sherlock's resolve not to touch. But Sherlock was a master of mind over matter, and he wouldn't let that fail him now.
"You really are exquisite in blue, John," he praised, hooking his finger over a knot over John's sternum. "You should wear it more often."
"Good. Now, have you ever been tied up?" he asked as he stepped over to his bed, eyeing both his ropes and the suspension. Suspending John would allow Sherlock to even out their height differences, making fucking him easier, but his shoulder required special consideration.
Sherlock traced one wet finger around John's hole, massaged the muscle with soft but firm intent, letting the tip of his finger slip sporadically inside briefly before withdrawing it again. For the moment, he just wanted to gentle John's too-tense body into cooperation. "You're a junkie, John. That's what happens when you feed your addiction." He finally pressed the whole length of his finger inside, and the muscles in John's stomach clenched almost rhythmically in place of arching or writhing.
Suddenly, Sherlock remembered the six Lestrade had given him three weeks ago and the man at the edge of the crowd that had piqued his interest. He was up and off his stool in a flash and striding to the door, opening it silently to stick his head out into the hall. Blond hair, tan jacket, tanned hands, limp and cane. It was the same man. Sherlock quickly snapped a picture of the man's back and sent a text to one of his Irregulars that tended to sleep near Bart's with instructions to shadow the man once he left. He'd do it himself if his experiment, and the case, weren't time sensitive, but he'd get his information regardless. Despite what his brother and Lestrade tended to think, he could be patient when the situation called for it. He'd have what he wanted soon enough.
"Do you want to come, John?" he panted, sweat pouring beading at his temples and under his clothes. "Do you want to come for me?"
Even though the thought of another touching his prize sent jealousy spiralling through John's chest, the fact that the boy he'd had his eyes on for years was finally his made an uncontrollable grin split his face. "Then I must never lose," John said, and bowed.
"Well, Sherlock," John drawled, licking his lips and settling his weight onto his heels and into his thighs as he luxuriated in the sensation the youth wrapped so tightly around him, "my blessings from Mars are well documented, but it's time to show you how Venus has blessed me as well."
The man looked positively dazed and relaxed, and the expression kept even as Sherlock slowly released him from his bindings in reverse order. When he finally had John sitting, cleaned, at the edge of his bed, wet cloth and dirty ropes flung into one corner, and condom in the bin, Sherlock crouched in front of him and didn't bother stopping himself from reverently tracing the rope marks his bindings had left behind.
The boy obediently hurried over, head bowed even when he came to a standstill. Their Master circled him, squeezing his arms, tilting his chin up, and finally lifting up the boy's tunic to eye where he'd once had testicles and now only had a scar - the sign of a eunuch. It was a little unexpected, but with a face like that, John was hardly surprised. And it wasn't as if it made a difference to John's purposes. At last, Master nodded and looked back to John.
," the boy said, voice tightening when John pressed his thumb to the tight ring of muscles, massaging it, opening it. The thickness of his thumb was almost wider than the boy's hole and he licked his lips at the thought of forcing his cock into it.
There was a honk of a horn from outside and Mummy glanced out the door where Father was already waiting in the car. Then her gazed turned towards him and Sherlock nodded his head. She smiled at him, then again at John, and then she was out the door. John stood in the doorway for a long time, staring into the falling darkness as the red glow of the tail lights faded, and Sherlock crept down the stairs to stand behind him. When John finally stepped back and closed and locked the door, he first turned to look up the stairs where Sherlock had been, and then down, where Sherlock was.
"Is that the only other word you know how to say?" John asked, amused, and in a good enough mood to tease.
"No," the boy, finally answered, but he didn't look up and he didn't move. Even from across John's small room, he was still closer to the boy than he'd ever been and this close, he looked even younger than John had originally guessed. A handful of years at the most. Still, all slaves, no matter their ages, knew that their masters and mistresses could use their bodies at any time they wished. It just wasn't often that they were used by other slaves.
His legs looked even smaller on the either side of John's thick waist, thinner than his arms, and he wondered if he was ever going to catch up. John wasn't done growing yet, but Sherlock had barely started.
"Thanks again for doing this on such short notice, John," Mummy was saying in the atrium as she tugged on her coat. Even from his spot at the top of the stairs, watching from between the balustrade, Sherlock could see the signs of stress on her. He didn't mind though. He'd be worried too if someone called to tell him that his mum was in the hospital. "Mycroft is still away at boarding school and won't be back till spring otherwise we'd have him-"
," John begged, as Sherlock continued to finger him slow and steady. Not once did his pace waver, not once did he deviate.
"How long has it been since someone has taken control, Officer?" he said when the man was close enough. His doctor stilled, his attention caught, but Sherlock needed the man's actual title. "Lieutenant? Sergeant? Captain?" That one. A quick inhale of breath and a minor pupil dilation. "Captain, then." His heart started to pound in his chest, but now was the moment of truth. "Or would you prefer 'Doctor'?"
"John, John," Sherlock panted, tossing his head from side to side, feeling physically and mentally confused.
"Good," Sherlock praised as he tugged another coil of rope off the duvet and bound John tight into the box-tie. He wouldn't normally make it two separate ties, but he didn't want John's injury to be any part of the suspension rigging. Sherlock already planned on keeping a close eye on his soldier's microexpressions to ensure he wasn't feeling pain that Sherlock wasn't causing himself.
Bart's was blessedly silent in and around Sherlock's laboratory, leaving him alone to conduct his experiment. Lestrade had managed to find him an eight earlier in the night and now the hour was late, too late for the staff and students to be causing their normal disruptive commotion. And yet, there were two pairs of footsteps echoing in the hallway, the pace too mellow to be business. There was an odd, heavy but hollow thump accompanying every other step that tugged at something in Sherlock's memory, and he looked up as the footsteps neared. Mike Stamford passed by the door, visible through the small window, as was a stranger. A stranger who walked with a limp.
It had been months since Sherlock had last visited the club - he hadn't felt the urge, but now, knowing that his doctor was looking for company, his body started to heat and he flew to his room to get ready. An indecent pair of leather pants, a shirt that was more messed sleeves and slashed vest, and a helping of black eyeliner and hair product later, Sherlock was in a cab and headed towards Dr Watson.
John folded without question and without hesitation, simply knelt right there in front of Sherlock, balancing his arse on his heels, his thighs tight with his balanced weight. He kept his chin and shoulders down but his back straight, a perfect posture, and then, without prompting, put his arms behind his back as well, grasping one wrist with the opposite hand. Sherlock hummed in surprise and pleasure, and combed his fingers through the short, blond strands. "Mm, very good job, John."
. My name. My name is John," he panted, eyes already glazed when Sherlock pulled back, temporarily satisfied.
"After I'm done ensuring you can't move, I'm going to finger you until you're begging for my cock. And then when you're begging for it, when you can't stand me not fucking you any longer, I will, but I won't let you come until I'm satisfied. How does that sound?"
"Deal," Sherlock agreed with a grin, and stood up to kiss John. It wasn't until he was bearing the man, his soldier, down onto the duvet that he realized it was the first time they'd kissed that evening.
After he'd returned home, had been cleaned and massaged by his caretakers, and dressed in a tunic, his master called for him, as he'd promised.
The crowd cheered and screamed as John stood tall and proud in the center of the coliseum, his opponents all laid out unconscious around him. He lifted his face to the sun, feeling it beat down on his bare skin, drying the blood trickling down his chest and shoulder blade and leg. It had been his tenth battle. And his tenth victory.
"Good boy," John murmured. And then again. And again and again and again, a soft litany in Sherlock's ear until John pushed forward so hard that it hurt and Sherlock tensed, a full-body cringe that made John groan and curl tight around him. "So so good, Sherlock."
"Good boy," John praised, sliding his hands down the length of Sherlock's arms. The callouses made Sherlock's arms feel funny, but he knew he wasn't supposed to move, so he shook off the shiver they gave him. It was a little harder to do when the hands went back up his arms, and then down his body, over his bare belly and down his bare legs.
Watson glanced sharply around and then moved quickly forward into Sherlock's space, the limp apparently forgotten, confirming his original hypothesis of 'psychosomatic'. Sherlock's smirk widened.
Sherlock grinned, wide and triumphant, and he stepped into Watson's space, leaving little room between them, but just enough to be teasing as he dropped his chin to keep eye contact. "Excellent."
you?" he sniped, temper shorted by too little sleep and too much subpar coffee over the last three days, judging by the state of his tie.
John grinned at the denial and wrapped his hands around the boy's ankles, spreading his legs. "Oh? And what did Wanda call you, if not blessed?"
He moved his feet as far apart as they would go on the bed, until he was lying like a starfish, naked and stretched out, on top of his sheets. The duvet had already been pushed to the floor, "to keep from getting dirty," John had reminded him.
Sherlock could only tremble and nod, his penis hard between his legs, as he tried to adjust to the thick length in him. It was getting easier, but it was still such a strange thing that he still didn't know how to handle it.
The sound that left John was more strangled than anything else as he came, streaks of white crossing tan skin and blue rope. His muscles rippled spastically around Sherlock's own cock and Sherlock groaned as he came, his hands on John's hips tightening when his knees buckled under the onslaught of endorphins. He locked his joints until it passed, relishing the chemical flood in his brain and his body until it faded, and he blinked until John's face came back into focus.
"Arms out," John said, voice soft and warm, his smile even warmer, and his hands even warmer than that when their calloused palms pressed to the bare skin of Sherlock's ribs.
"You may keep him until you die or lose a contest," Master declared imperiously. "If you lose but live, you shall watch your successor win your catamite instead."
He stepped away just as Watson started to lean into him, and strode to the sidewalk, hailing one of the cabs lingering down the block. Watson looked dazed and wrong-footed when he finally turned around to look at Sherlock while the cab pulled up behind him. He opened the door and gestured inside. "Mine's closer."
Grunts of hot air pressed against his throat with each thrust, and with each thrust, a whimper was forced out of Sherlock's mouth. He couldn't help it. He'd tried to stop, both now and before, but he couldn't help the strange little noise, like he'd become a dog toy. He didn't like it, but he thought John did, because the louder he got, the gruntier John got, the more John's chest against Sherlock's vibrated with low, deep moans.
Something changed in John's smile, and Sherlock shivered. "Of course," he said with a nod. He held out his hands and Sherlock raised his arms to be picked up - he didn't normally like to be carried, he was too old for that now, but John was warm and solid from his rugby games, and Sherlock liked the feel of him a different way than he like the feel of his mum and dad. "Let's get our patient ready."
posture straightened suddenly once again, like a man preparing to go into battle. His chin raised and he looked Sherlock dead in the eye. "Not at all."
"Did you need to do your doctor practice?" Sherlock asked him, eyes already scanning down John's body, searching for the little things only he and Mycroft seemed to be able to see.
breath over the head of John's purpling prick. "And I plan to," he said over the sound of John's short cry.
John's eyes were glazed from his arousal and his submission, but a small, pleased smile still crossed his lips. "Thank you, Sherlock."
Watson didn't reply for a moment, and then he seemed to realize either what Sherlock meant or where his eyes were trained, or both. "Oh." The word was soft and surprised, and Sherlock raised his eyes again. "Really?"
Sherlock updated his file on the stranger to add 'doctor' alongside 'retired soldier wounded in Afghanistan or Iraq', and returned to his seat and his experiment.
Once back at his full height, he stepped close until Watson's skin was brushing against his clothes, and then ducked his head to suck a mark into the unblemished skin of the tanned throat. He wanted to cover this man in his marks, make him remember Sherlock if he decided not to stay. Most of the marks would be from Sherlock's ropes, but he wanted to leave at least one with his mouth, with his teeth. Something high, something that sat above even a fully buttoned collar; something dark, noticeable to anyone who might encounter his doctor over the next week. An unavoidable truth that John Watson had belonged to him, even if just for a night.
Jim gave John a disgusted look before rolling forward and getting to his feet, breathing hard. He dropped onto one of the sofas and glared across the room, arms crossed over his chest, then clawed his fingers through his hair, mussing it from its slicked-back style. “This century is
John smiled at the postscript, then carefully folded the letter away. When he returned to the townhouse, he hid it with his other letters, which were rolled up inside a hollowed-out leg of the bedside table. Their correspondence had been going on successfully for several months now; there were weeks between letters, and the waiting was agonizing, but each brief, scribbled note was worth it.
growing used to him. If he despised him, why was he being so adamant about keeping Jim off the drugs? He could see no benefit for John in doing so. What was his angle? Unsure of how he felt about the army doctor in front of him, Jim said nothing more. He capped his ink bottle and put away his pen, raising his eyebrows at John before walking upstairs to go to bed, wondering if John would follow him.
There was another possibility of course, one that John dreaded to think about. “I will slit your son’s throat,” Jim had growled in John’s ear. He shuddered. His sleep had been plagued by nightmares about Hamish. The dreams were mostly all the same. John would hear Hamish scream, and he’d run through what felt like glue to get to him. Sometimes the location varied. The ending never did. He always arrived too late, finding Hamish dead and bloody on the ground.
Blood pooled across the Persian rug, staining it, but John knew Jim never cared for it anyway, so he rolled O’Seanassy’s body up in it and dragged it out through the kitchen. He had thought that Jane had gone out to run errands, but she was still there, chopping potatoes. She watched with wide eyes as John silently dragged the rolled rug through the room, but said nothing. She was all too aware of the consequences of Jim’s work, and she must have heard the gunshot minutes before.
, going by his dress, stature, name, and the way he looked around our untidy flat in distaste, do you remember?" Sherlock paced back and forth. "And he wouldn't come to me if he'd seen someone who simply reminded him of the man he saw during the Blitz.
“I didn’t see, sir. It was dropped through the mail slot with the other letters, and I assumed it was some sort of calling card. Who’s ‘JM’?”
“That’s not good enough!” Jim barked, grabbing John and punching him again in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. “FIGHT ME BACK! FIGHT ME BACK, YOU FUCKING
Mycroft smiled and the brothers finally caught each other’s eyes. Mycroft cleared his throat and stood up straight, remembering himself. “There’s so much left I never got to say. My brother—“ He cleared his throat, cutting himself off. “Well, perhaps if it’s best if I don’t say it.”
Mycroft set his glass of scotch on a small table beside him, not bothering to look up from his book. “Glad to see you alive. Thank you
“Are you suggesting I might have to restrain you?” Sherlock flicked his eyes to their cast-off belts on the bed. “I will I have to.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John, his voice still level. “Will throwing a fit save us? Will worrying change the outcome at all?”
The Doctor blinked mildly, although wisely stayed on the other side of the angels, out of Sherlock’s reach. “Why are
John, used to fading to the background when Sherlock was being praised was shocked when the Doctor turned to him. “And John Watson, the most human human, the bravest—“ he grabbed John’s hand and shook it as John stared at him, dumbfounded. “It’s such an honor. From the bottom of my hearts.”
Hamish had brought back an invitation that “cordially invited” parents to attend the school over the coming weekend.
John pulled his hands from behind his coat, revealing a black case. “I don’t know much about violins, but…I think it’s a good one.”
“Mm, I lucked out, then,” John said, stretching. He felt exhausted. Too much had happened in the last 48 hours.
them…you see.” He ran his hand over his jaw, then his mouth curled into a wicked grin at Sherlock’s dumbfounded expression.
convinced him without a doubt that this was the same man he'd seen sixty years ago. No, John, there's something to this."
Jim breathed in through his nose. “To live,” he said. He opened his eyes and rolled them dramatically. “And to tutor bright young lads. Like Hamish.
much better than the ones at school!” The fridge—“Are those…fingers? JAM!”, the angels—“Why’re they wearing silly hats?”. He grabbed the deerstalker off one of them. “Dad! You’re that detective, the one who fake-died! Put it on!”
Sherlock pulled back, making an annoyed sound. He grabbed the belts from the bed, looping each one around John’s wrists and stretching them apart, tying them around opposite bedposts so that John’s arms were immobile.
John felt Sherlock’s erection pressing against him and couldn’t bear it anymore. He moved his hands down Sherlock’s chest and torso, then began yanking off his trousers, grabbing at his cock, then slid down and grabbed the base, licking a circle around the head.
Jim considered this, as if he hadn’t already thought about it. “Mmm, no, I don’t think that’s true at all. I rarely get tired of prizes. Just knowing that
“Yeah, but their friend who gave me to them says my dads’ll come back for me some day soon. It’s all a load of rubbish, of course. People can’t have two
He sat back, straddling John’s thighs, and shrugged off his own shirt, carefully tossing it aside, then began caressing his hands through John’s hair as John slid his trousers down his hips and kicked them off.
“As intriguing as it is, I fail to see the issue,” Sherlock said. “Who cares if he doesn’t publish a book of stories? It’s not as if people will know what they’re missing, and I hardly impact the world for the worse. You’ve been to 2012, you’ve
Sherlock's touch elicited some girlish laughter from the slab before Ursula scolded, "Watch it! That tickles."
The Doctor grinned, clapped him on the shoulder, then disappeared up the steps, calling, “I think I last saw the book in the squash courts, or possibly the reptile enclosure! Back in a mo’!” His voice faded deep into the TARDIS.
John came back with some cocoa and laughed aloud at what a perfect mimic Hamish was doing. He set the cocoa down and set about making himself some tea, humming without realizing he was doing so. He felt comfortable in a way he hadn’t before, even with the ominous stone angels in their flat.
Sherlock came out a minute later, fully dressed, and stepped over to give John a little kiss while Hamish’s back was turned.
John pushed his fingers further inside, carefully, then let them rest there for a moment. “Are you all right? We don’t have to do this. I don’t want to hurt you.”
John began to suspect that something had happened to Sherlock. He hated that he had no way of knowing. Not for the first time he wished he had any sort of technology. He felt entirely disconnected from London, other than scraps of general news. Sherlock could be dead, for all he knew.
Magnussen held out his hand toward Sherlock and snapped his fingers once, then pointed at Sherlock’s scarf. Sherlock’s hands shook as he slowly moved them up to his coat, sliding the scarf from his neck and handing it over. Oh, he was most definitely going to kill this man. The second he got a chance.
“We ought to sleep fully dressed,” he said. “If the angels come, we don’t want to get sent back in nothing but our skin.”
Craig raised his eyesbrows and stepped back, allowing Sherlock and John to come inside. “Yeah, come in. Excuse the mess. I’ve been the at-home dad lately, and things’ve been—“
Hamish huffily straightened his school blazer and led the march out of the room. Sherlock and John trailed behind.
“Sorry, I haven’t got a string of lovers like you with your ‘ladykiller charm’ and army-doctor-captain-rank-pulling..” he floundered for a word. “Sexiness.”
the magical man in the funny blue box created for you? Honestly, it’s so sweet I’m going diabetic just
John nodded and joined the three men as Jim listed off the men he wanted taken care of and the people who needed to be threatened. As always, Jim wanted the job done quickly, demanding their return in a week. This gave them a scanty two days in London, but it would be enough time for John.
“I hear you’re the best, which is why I came to you. You’re going to tell me I’m crazy…but I swear I’m not.”
John opened his eyes groggily and found himself slumped over in the seat of a hansom cab. Moriarty watched him from the seat across. “Welcome to the beginning of a whole new life, Johnny,” Jim said, brushing his knees against John’s.
John gives him another kiss, lingering, almost reverent, before sliding his lips down and brushing them over Sherlock’s skin as he crawled down the bed toward Sherlock’s cock, his lips finally meeting it to slowly lick up its length.
The man gave another disgusting grin and shoved a folded piece of paper into John’s hands. John unfolded it:
“Did you see the box at all that night of the Blitz?” John asked. As absurd as the story was, he found himself becoming engrossed.
“Why do you hate her so much? She’s genuinely trying to make your life more comfortable, and you sulk around like a child. It’s embarrassing.”
He smiled and tilted his face up to kiss John before shifting over and settling next to him on the bed. He was staring at the ceiling, thinking, and his smile faded.
is why I like receiving texts—because you can notify someone when you are running late. You would think that someone who makes their living in…time…would be able to
Jim paused for a moment, thinking. “Remember the last time we had a little rendezvous? Back at the pool?”
Once they were halfway decent again, John rolled to face Sherlock, his hand tracing along Sherlock’s ribs and around to his back, tracing the spine with his fingertips. It was relaxing to watch Sherlock’s body unwind once more, and his eyes slowly droop as he picked up John’s free wrist and kissed it.
“Two,” Sherlock said into John’s mouth. “If we slide two inches to the left—“ he sidled over, pulling John with him. “We’re in the blind spot.” He clawed at John’s shoulder blades through his coat.
It was a very sulky ride back to Baker Street. Hamish was angry and glum the rest of the week. John and Sherlock pulled him out of the school and enrolled him in a less prestigious school closer to Westminster, where he could come home every day.
He finally withdrew John from his mouth very slowly, leaving John sweating and writhing and straining at the belts hold him back. He watched as Sherlock peeled off his own trousers and pants, then Sherlock met his eyes.
John tore a sheet of paper from his notebook and passed over, then watched as the old man sketched out a creature with tusks and flat, glassy eyes. It was a good drawing, but the creature looked like some fantastical monster. As Duncan drew, he explained, “It was eight feet tall, more or less? The skin, here and around here, was grayish, with blue patches here…there was a sort of sheen to the skin.”
“It’s absurd, but John, it all fits.” Sherlock was perched in his chair, tapping his fingers together. He snorted. “Can you imagine actually
John moaned a bit louder, hungry for more. He pulled down the zipper to Sherlock’s trousers, then slid his hands over Sherlock’s slender back and into his trousers, grabbing at his bare skin. Sherlock felt delicious, but he jerked away from John’s touch, reaching behind him and grabbing John’s wrists, slamming them up against the bed above John’s head.
When the boy returned empty-handed a half-hour later, out of breath and with the answer “steak and kidney pie,” John smiled and relinquished his guinea, knowing the note had fallen into the right hands.
Sherlock had reached Duncan’s ansaphone. “Duncan Reynolds, it’s Sherlock Holmes. The Doctor is currently standing in my flat. Please phone back.” He hung up and watched the Doctor circle him, annoyed at the Doctor’s strange interest in him. “Would you be referring to the case in which I retrieved the Reichenbach
“Jim, I went to the school. He’s missing, and I know you did something. And I know you did something to Sherlock too.
Mary blushed at his touch and gives a quick nod.  “I should go...but I’ll do as you say. Of course.”
A month went by and John made minimal progress. He was beginning to realize that Jim's web was a lot more complex than he had ever thought, but he never understood how complex until he found himself talking with a man named Dougherty, who alluded to strings of other men devoted to carrying out Jim's word. Scores of men, spread across the British Empire, a far-reaching web. After his talk with Dougherty, John came home discouraged, and tromped upstairs to get ready for bed.
John circled the bodies as well, then took out a notepad and jotted down notes as Sherlock rattled off his observations to the astonished Gregson. John also noted that Sherlock was being more of an ass than usual, calling Gregson and idiot multiple times.
He moved slowly, not only to torture John, but to give his muscles time to relax around John. He leaned forward as he grew used to the feeling of John inside him, supporting himself by balancing his palms on John’s chest. He gasped as he angled himself so that John was pressing up against his prostate. It was an entirely new feeling, and his mouth fell open as he hit the spot again, beginning to move a bit faster.
It only took an overlay of the two brain scans and a rescan to create a fairly passable new scan that made it look like Sherlock had a prominent aneurysm. “That should fool Mycroft,” John said as they hurried out the hospital doors and into the busy London street. “I hope you’re happy. Now everyone here is going to think I’m a big gay slut,” John muttered as he handed the finished scan to Sherlock.
John moved out a couple weeks later and settled into a tiny flat in Islington, feeling much as he did when he came home from the war: alone and alienated. He abandoned his blog and picked up any extra shifts he could at the clinic, beginning to work fifty, sometimes sixty hours a week, despite the fact that he didn’t really care about the extra money. He checked his phone every day, just in case Sherlock needed him for a case, but there was never any terse message signed “SH” in his inbox.
This meant that Jim was relatively harmless, but in his current state, John was never going to be assigned to London. And, just because Jim was listless didn’t mean his hired men were. John knew several of them kept close tabs on him, whether he went out or stayed in.
tried to kiss me. And failed I might add,” John muttered, then dipped his head down to drag out Sherlock’s lower lip with his teeth, giving it a quick suck.
Jim's eyes went dark and he took a step close to John so that they were nearly touching. His voice dangerously low, Jim said, “Yes or no.
