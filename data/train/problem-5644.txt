Tony snorted, hastily wiping his messy face on his sleeve, “Pretty fucking far from ok love, you’ve been unconscious for a month and a half, we had no idea what was wrong, then Strange said it was ‘magic’ and he couldn’t do anything and - “
"Oh my god, that was so cool! You like…and then he….and you…" the kid was talking so fast his words fell together as he gestured rapidly.
“I’m going to let you go, and you’re going to walk out of here without making a scene, and we’ll pretend like this never happened.” Tony waited for the young man to nod before he released him stepping back and allowing the other to scuttle out.
Gathering his stuff he headed for the door, he was going to be cutting it really close but if he managed this….well he just wanted to do something nice for the kid.
Carefully he slid one finger inside surprised to find no resistance, his mental digit sliding smoothly. Anthony must have noted his surprise, "Got ready before I woke you," he mumbled, "I had a plan."
“If he ever wants to retire from being Captain America he can be a party planner,” Anthony muttered. He was right the James’s has gone all out on this, Steve didn’t even know what an engagement party was until Buck had told him he was going to it.
Tony hummed this time understanding, he knew Steve had been struggling with the drawing, despite the incredible advancement they’d made with the fine motor skills on his arm, Steve had confided it didn’t feel right anymore.
“Yeah, you know kids getting candy, costumes, tricks, horror movies, all that sort of stuff,” Sam explained as he swooped by, ugly black critters hanging off his wings. Steve sited down his rifle picking them off with precise shots.
The figure got closer, and Peter could hear the squeak of leather, eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses. Peter shifted readily for an attack.
He sped up a little still consciousness of his metal fingers buried deep in his lover, but Anthony was see-sawing between his abs and fingers as a steady stream of gabled nonsense fell from his lips. All at once Anthony was pulling away, sitting up he pressed himself more firmly onto his fingers and he ground down, riding them.
"Hey sweetheart, are you ok?" Anthony was before him, hands gently taking his own tangling their fingers together.
Steve gave another shrug, Tony huffing an amused chuckle, but said nothing more as Steve lead them a couple more blocks to his favourite diner. Entering he gave a small wave to the waitress before taking his usual corner booth. Sliding in he watched as Tony glanced around, cringing a little as he realized that he’d just taken Tony Stark, billionaire, superhero, to a little dive diner.
“God Steve,” his boyfriend breathed before the irritating ping came again. Growling Anthony smacked at his phone when it sounded a few more times.
Suddenly the person was close enough he could see them, recognizing the mess of dark hair, and worried hazel eyes.
After Anthony had calmed down somewhat, the others had been notified, everyone spilling in to see him. Including a smug-looking Loki.
His boyfriend was apparently not willing to be soothed as Steve soon found himself with a lap full of upset Anthony Stark.
Steve nodded he could get there. He was going to be a little late, and he wasn’t Anthony, but maybe he could help the kid out. At least until Anthony could get there.
“Everything Ok?”  The man asked setting aside his phone with a concerned look, as Bruce sat back down.
Just as the words left his mouth, there was a massive explosion behind them. Bucky actually jumped in surprise whipping around his jaw dropped in shock; the base was in flames.
"Thor we've been over this how many times…beer please," an exasperated dark-haired man requested with a sunny smile, “For me and the big guy.”
Blinking in surprise Steve held the steady gaze until the little kitten opened its mouth and gave a plaintive meow. Frowning he reached for it with his left hand without thinking, surprised when the tiny kitten brushed against his metal fingers looking up at him to meow again.
Floating he was roused again by Friday, her voice distant and far asking him if he was ok, and reminding him they had an appointment that afternoon, something for the wedding but he couldn’t…he couldn’t focus. He knew he had to get up, get moving, but he couldn’t seem to get his body to cooperate.
Anthony sighed looking down at his hands then, “It’s an agreement, contract, between two people before they get married. It’s to protect the assets of each party in the event the marriage terminates…” he trailed off squeezing his eyes closed.
“Only thing I’m sure of in this world,” he mumbled, and Anthony was hugging him again burying his face in his neck. Steve held onto him tight, he knew they would no doubt have to deal with the fallout of this, but as long as they were together that was all that mattered.
Tony was already moving, dark eyes roving over the cluttered whiteboard. Spotting the note right away, he felt his lips twitch in a fond, exasperated smile.
Steve worked his way out of the rubble trying to get his balance without his arm, the lack of weight always threw him off for a while. Getting his barring’s though he was hurrying back towards the fight, slinging his rifle on his back he went. He could fire it without his left hand but he still had his guns and knives; he wasn’t out yet.
“Yeah…” he breathed, as Tony shifting off the bed, Steve caught his breath the ache in his head, so real and vivid, it was Tony…only it wasn’t Tony.
The reptile had him at eye level and Steve struck, burying the knife in the things beady black eye. It was not happy, roaring its displeasure, and coating Steve in saliva before flinging him away in pain.
Pepper snorted a laugh as she sorted the papers, “I take it you two are headed somewhere warm then?”
He was smiling at him softly, looking as if he was about to speak before, “Come on Tony lets go karaoke is calling!”
Pepper nodded as she unshed him towards the jet, “I already have your spare bag on there, we need to get going. Call him once we’re underway.”
Steve gently smoothed dark hair slicked with sweat, humming in agreement. He closed his eyes a rumble of contentment deep in his chest. The lay pressed together long minutes before Anthony moved first, wincing as Steve slipped from him.
“Dinner,” he said softly, Anthony turned to face him, chest heaving, and sweat glistening on his brow.
Steve shrugged it really hadn’t been all that hard, Fury’s intelligence had given a basic location, and Steve had known there was a base there. He had been there before, he was sure of it…only he couldn’t remember the extent of it.
Nodding his thanks again, Peter was suddenly hugging him. Tony somewhat used to it by now, patted him gently on the back before releasing him, then much to his surprise, and Tony was sure the surprise of Steve, Peter hugged him too.
Steve rested his hands on Anthony’s waist gently rubbing his thumbs along his hip bones. The smaller man sagged against him, and Steve held him close, “I’m not going to take that from you sweetheart, we’re going to have a real Christmas.”
“So, good, you feel so good, so full…Oh, God!" Anthony yelled as Steve pulled back from the wall taking Anthony with him moving him up and down with his upper body strength alone.
"I'm trying to picture small you," Anthony was still smiling at him, eyes still a little red-rimmed, but the light was back. That painful shadow slowly leaving his expression.
Steve suppressed the bubble of fear that rose in him. The man seemed to be done with him then, the clang of the heavy metal door shutting behind him ringing with finality.
Tony automatically caught the helmet as Steve tossed it to him, kicking the bike to life, the blonde head turned to him, eyes still shaded with the dark glass, “Come with me if you want to live.”
And he’d fucked it up. Tony banged his head against the table wanting to crawl into a hole and not come out.
He could hear the other scrambling in his ear trying to reach him, but unfortunately, there were more than one of these bastard lizards running around and it was only he, Steve, Sam, and Anthony.
Still, he opened up the app, finding the original posters video and typing out a reply. Hiding his smile, he waited. Steve’s head was lolling again beside him Clint and Sam still scrolling when Clint saw it first.
"Oh, and Sergeant,” Steve paused looking back to Fury the man far too amused,  "Report February 1, cold-weather exercise.”
He glanced around the gym curiously, it had been a long, long, while since he’d been in high school. Not that he could remember any of it, but he had the vaguest recollections that it perhaps had not been a pleasant experience.
Adjusting his grip, he used his metal left arm to hold him as he used his right to guide himself inside Anthony’s tight heat. The man in his arms made a long low moan as he eased the other down using gravity to help. Steve clenched his jaw to keep from thrusting into him, barely holding on.
A long thoughtful pause fell, Anthony shifted against him, rolling onto his chest so he could look him in the eye, “Explain.”
“Christmas Party at the Compound,” Steve said briskly, Lang blinked at him a solid minute before he responded.
It was fairly amusing to see his best friend founder, he’d had vague memories of Buck being a bit of a lady killer in his day. He didn't recall there being men, but his memory was so poor he didn't even trust himself to remember to brush his teeth. He thought they were good together though, Sam was a sweet man, he all but worshiped Bucky; more than that he
Within moments the other converged on her. Steve stuck to the perimeter picking off her pets, vaguely listening to Anthony calling Strange to come to deal with whatever it was they’d been fighting.
Moving across the beautifully decorated ballroom, Peter couldn't help but try to see everything at once. Head whipping around he let out a small squeak as he ran full-on into the back of the man before him.
Then a disgruntled SI employee had decided to turn supervillain and tried to blow half the city, completely ruining his day.
He opened the notification, Steve was indeed trending again, and it wasn’t hard to see why. Someone had snapped a candid picture of his boyfriend in Central Park, holding, of all things, a small black kitten. The poster had simply captioned it with a heart emoji and #Winterstolemyheart.
Anthony called him from where he was pressed against his chest. He hummed in response, his husband shifting closer.
Listening to the others in his ear he could hear the shift of battle. Soon the sounds of scattering rubble had him tensing, unable to do more.
The question was directed at him and he looked at the reporter deadpan, the man shrank back. He must be new, reporters did not talk to him often.
Carefully he pulled on the borrowed clothing, it was too big, the t-shirt falling off one of his shoulders, and he had to roll up the sweat pants, but he was glad to have his glasses back, pushing them up his nose, he hooked his hearing aid back in feeling more confident that the world was back in focus.
Steve was surprised at himself as the quiet question fell between them, he closed his eyes cursing himself for an idiot.
He’d just been so happy someone had been paying attention to him. Tony had made him think…for a moment that maybe…maybe he wasn’t completely hopeless.
Anthony looked amused, “ ‘#bffgoals’,” he explained. Steve understood what that meant, he nodded, fair enough. "They're commending you on being so supportive of Buck, accepting, and how hard they ship Cap and Falcon."
Bruce sat back lips twitching in amusement as Tony wound himself up. He was well used to the man's rants by now but it never ceased to amuse him. Following Tony's wild hand gestures, he happened to glance behind up, freezing when he spotted the large man standing at the far end of the room behind Tony.
Steve already knew his arm was crushed under the wall that had fallen on him. Twisting he tried to move it himself but his right leg was pinned and he couldn’t get the purchase too. Biting off a curse he could do no more than wait.
The song ended, and the tempo picked up again, but Tony didn't move far. He turned to lean against Steve as he watched the kids yell and dance, enjoying the evening.
Gathering his courage he climbed into the massive bed shifting hesitantly closer to Tony. The man gathering him close, Steve gave a tired huff eye drifting shut.
His smaller lover pulled back a moment, and Steve saw his eyes glassy with unshed tears as he offered him a watery smile. “You sure?” he whispered, still holding tight to his neck as they rested their foreheads together.
The waitress returned with their drinks and taking their order disappeared, blush on her cheeks. Amused Tony shook his head, Steve raised an eyebrow at him and Tony felt a wash of love for the man.
“Let me see,” Sam spoke soothingly, voice gentle and calm. Steve spotted them standing together, head’s drawn close. Buck was holding his arm awkwardly while Sam cautiously looking it over brow knitted in worry.
“My hour up?" he asked curiously, he’d promised Steve he was only going to do an hour work before joining him and the others for a movie. He’d been planning to take off with Steve to bed right after dinner, but Clint and Natasha had come home just after they got back, followed soon after by Rhodey who’d been curious about the lizards.
Floating sweetly on endorphins he turned reaching for Steve’s waistband on his sweats when those big hands stalled him out.
“How is an ex-Hydra assassin such a genuinely nice person,” Clint’s look was just as soft as theirs.
He looped his arms around the strong neck, ready to go through the motions, he would never deny Steve anything in this world. Maybe he'd get more onboard in a bit.
Sam nodded, and they were headed towards the base, the harsh weather having driven everyone inside the main building. Silently entering, they had just rounded the first corner when poor timing brought them face to face with a small group of armed men.
Tony couldn’t help it, he laughed as the video faded into pictures, so many pictures, some great, some not so great, but very much reflective of the pair.
Steve was having a bit of a surreal morning. Incredible sex, followed by a nap, and a rather sensual shower, he found himself in borrowed clothing eating breakfast with the Avengers. He tried not to be as impressed as he was.
Shaking his head in amusement he returned his focus to the Steve, the big man looked weary, “Come, rest, eat.”
Steve nodded to each of them, “Very nice to meet you,” Captain America shook his hand and Steve tried not to wince; the man had a hell of a grip.
"Do you want to stop?" Tony's voice was soft, but he sounded less in control, his voice taking an edge to it.
Plastering a smile on his face he turned, holding his hands up. “Please, we are still trying to-“ he was cut off as the surged forward yelling over each other to be heard.
Steve nodded unconsciously licking his lips as strong hands moved to the waistband of the pants. Clever fingers undoing the button and fly, pushing them just far enough down his hips for his erection to spring free.
He sighed, spotting Anthony, his love didn’t look happy either, a frown creasing his brow as reporters swarmed around him. Steve felt unease curl in his gut, “What’s going on?” he rasped to Bucky, noting the other others looked tired and despondent as well.
His breath caught as the door was flung open and an imposing figure was entering. Steve squinted at the door jerking harder at his hands, as he struggled to breathe, no, no, no he did not need to have an attack.
He couldn’t help it, he was laughing, vocal cords rasping as he wheezed, he could feel Anthony laughing against him, giddy and breathless until they stilled pressed together in their wide bed humming pleasantly from the closeness.
Steve did bother to glance at the manger, ignoring her he grabbed his billfold and headed back into the dining room. He spotted him right away it was hard not to, the man seemed to command the attention of the room without even really trying.
“Controls are jammed hang tight just gonna…” he trailed off and suddenly there was a scream of metal and a juddering thud, Steve who’d been standing near the edge of the car holding a goon by the neck, felt the car under him thud against the other. Unable to catch his balance both he and goon he held were thrown from the moving training.
Tony groaned, “That’s right, totally forgot. It’s fine Pep, I can plan a party, I can totally do that.”
“Rogers, I need you to stay late, Rose didn’t show for her shift. I’ll need you to work the bar tonight.”
Tony couldn’t help but heave a small sigh of relief, he’d been a little worried when Steve hadn’t answered earlier.
“No boss, but you better take a look at this,” Friday explained as one of the screens in the workshop flickered to life, bringing up the news.
Steve nodded, feeling a little pang of sadness, he understood though. Turning he joined the others on the jet as they headed back to the compound.
Tony was calling him, he turned to the voice blinking stupidly, he was kneeling before him, face drawn, lips pressed together; he was still wearing his armour.
Swallowing down the hurt he tried to smile, “I thought everyone was busy?” he blustered crossing his arms and arching a brow.
“Steve,” his name fell softly and Steve didn’t have words to answer him back, he just wanted to feel. He grabbed the hand on his waist bringing it under his borrowed shirt, pressing the warm palm against his lower abdomen.
He wished Bruce had been around, Hulk would have been helpful, hell even Thor would have been able to electrocute the slimy bastards.
Steve made his way to the workshop tray balanced on his hand. He knew Anthony was in a sour mood, he’d got pretty good at reading his moods, and usually if he stormed off to the workshop without saying anything to anyone that was a pretty good indicator that he was not pleased.
Giving her a small salute he grabbed up his rifle and hurried off down the street trying to locate the others. It wasn’t hard, he just followed the trail of destruction, they’d lead the lizards away from the populace towards the warehouses by the water. Steve arriving just in time to see his Anthony subdue the last with a solid blast to the chest.
Tony pulled back a little, warm brown eye almost amber in the low light, staring at him a long while before a small soft smile crept across his features.
"Well that's good news then," Steve was looking at him curiously and Tony was fighting a smile that threatened to crack his face in half.
At least he wasn’t alone, Tony was taking him somewhere warm though, and no doubt going to spoil him. He sighed, somewhere warm would be great right about now.
Rolling a towel, he set it on the lip of the tub before guiding the man to lean back, resting as the warm water began to work. Tony kissed his forehead gently, “Relax love, I’ll be right back.”
Steve closed his eyes panting, small tremors racking his body, he had never felt so full, Tony pressing so deeply inside him. Callused fingers skimmed higher up his sides, before skating across his abdomen. Gentle fingertips stilling as Tony sucked in a harsh breath, “Jesus.”
Steve was about to answer when a woman with long dark hair appeared behind him, "Oh my…that's the Winter Soldier?”
Tony had gone all out as well, had got them tickets to see some new play on Broadway, just like their first date. He’d also found a new place to eat so exclusive that he’d even had problems getting a table. Yes, it was going to be a perfect night.
Anthony turned to him, laughing bright and clear, Steve feeling a warmth suffuse in his chest. He loved to make Anthony laugh, “Nice one love,” he stepped closer pecking a quick kiss to his cheek before he was moving back.
Strong arms came up gently grasping his sides as Steve turned motioning for him to climb onto his back. Tony didn’t even argue, he wrapped his arms around his strong neck, he hooked his legs around his waist. Steve hitched him a little higher and Tony nuzzled against his neck closing his eyes. He felt Steve moving but Tony couldn't bring himself to care where sighing he slumped forward his feverish body pulling him to slumber.
Steve blinked, the lights making his head throb, “Dim please J,” Tony was moving around the room, grabbing towels, and adding something sweet-smelling to the bathwater.
Tony doubled over in laughter at the indignant sputtering from across the kitchen. “God I love you,” he managed between giggles.
“I got it,” he assured him hurrying towards their room, all the while cursing himself, he should have known. He’d been so stupid, he missed all the signs. He hadn’t checked in, he always checked in with Steve throughout the day. He’d just been so busy he hadn’t even realized, then Steve hadn’t shown to their cake tasting appointment, and he’d known something was wrong.
Grumbling he decided to call it a day, Anthony would be back from work soon, they were staying in the tower tonight instead of heading back to the compound. He could heat his bean bag for his shoulder, maybe order in…
Feeling his lips twitch he looked down at his right hand, the matching silicone band on his fourth finger. It wasn’t traditional, but he wasn’t going to wear a wedding band on his metal arm. Cheers rang out then and he looked up, glasses clinking as the guests called for a kiss.
Something nagged at the back of his mind as he watched the women clad in a flowing dark dress and cloak, surrounded by the black creatures.
“Ok, I’ll be Captain America and you can be Falcon,” Steve rasped back loud enough for his voice to carry.
He laughed then, and something inside Steve finally seemed to relax, he hadn’t realized just how tense he’d been. Seeing Anthony so broken….he never wanted to see it again, never wanted to be the cause of it.
“It’s for Mr. Stark, we’ve been to San Francisco, and Space,” Peter looked so earnest she couldn’t help but giggle.
“Look confident, you’ll fit in,” Sergeant Rogers assured him as he walked into the room like he owned it.
He looked up as Anthony made a strangled sort of noise, eyes wide cheeks flushed. Steve gave him a look, “Ok so I have a thing…” Anthony didn’t look all that abashed about it.
His breath stuttered as Anthony plucked at his nipples, turning his head he leaned deeper into the embrace capturing those teasing lips for a searing kiss. Anthony hummed against his lips, and Steve could feel him vibrating against his back.
Tony melted immediately, groaning softly as he gave himself over to the tender ministrations. Steve’s strong capable fingers worked across his head, hitting all the tender points. Smoothing across his forehead and working around the back. Tony was floating, his entire being focusing on those magic fingers as they turned him into a pile of mush.
Worrying at the cuffs he tried to slip them over his hands, unsuccessfully trying to keep the tears from falling. He gave a frustrated moan when the cuffs stuck on his hands if he could just…
He must have made some sort of noise because those dark chocolate eyes were looking at him all sex and sultry, lips stretched over his girth. Steve puffed for breath, hands going back to gently card through the dark hair, and across strong shoulders. Steve split his attention between Anthony’s fingers and his mouth, unable to help but lean forward smoothing his right down the slope of his spine.
He had taken it upon himself to do some research into Christmas as try as he might,  he couldn't recall his own. He'd briefly thought about asking Buck but that seemed like asking for trouble. So after a little Googling, he'd pretty much figured it out. His biggest concern at the moment was deciding what to get his extremely rich boyfriend.
He could picture it in his head, could see it so vividly in his mind it made his chest ache. He wanted it so much…but…
Steve huffed a small breathy laugh as he reached out slinging his arms around Tony drawing him closer as he wrapped skinny legs around his hips, “I
Done with this, he nodded to the shop assistant before heading to the change room, movements lacking his usual lustre. Grumbling he was shrugging out of the shirt and pants, standing in his boxer briefs he carefully put the clothing back on the hanger before turning to get dressed.
Hips hitching he pressed back wanton, unable to voice his need, the powers of speech seeming beyond him at the moment.
Anthony was pulling back with a gasp, pressing a kiss to his lower abdomen before he scooted back on the bed, “Stay right there,” he panted.
Steve felt bad as a look of  hurt crept across the teens face, “Sure thing Sarge,” he nodded trying to put on a brave face.
Steve’s stomach growled in anticipation making Anthony grin at him and shake his head, "And tomorrow my dear, we will be on the beach."
Shocked he blinked, then blinked again to make sure he wasn’t seeing things. Nope, that was indeed Steve Rogers standing there. Eyes darting from the ranting Tony to Steve he was about to say something to his friend when he saw the big blonde press a finger to his lips. Bruce closed his mouth with a clack.
He winced, the reporters were already surrounding him, he could hear the clicking of cameras, and a barrage of questions. Always waiting for him to fuck up….and Christ had this ever been a fuck up.
Bruce couldn’t help the amused grin, he’d heard of Peter through Tony. His friend spoke very highly of the teen, a bright young mind.
“It’ll be fine, it’ll heal, always does,” he assured the other man softly, Steve watching as he offered a small smile to Sam, the other man returning in. Face inches apart in the currently wreaked Boston street. Steve felt his lips twitched amused, realizing the pair had no idea he was even there; they were completely in a world of their own.
“Steve, sweetheart,” the voice was closer, the endearment had him pausing, though his chest still heaved.
Stilling Tony held him tight, the only sound their panting breaths, and Steve could hear his racing heart. The adrenaline was slow to leave him, as he drifted slowly, pleasure hazed and content.
Steve nodded as he glanced around the tastefully decorated space, Buck had done a fantastic job planning the engagement party.
“Steve, love?” he called spotting the lump on the bed immediately. For such a big man, he had curled up so small, Tony felt his heartache. He saw the arm on the bed, glinting dully in light, it must have been bad.
“Doesn’t hurt, just an odd feeling,” he assured him, as Steve moved them towards the bathroom. The shower already on thanks to Fri, Steve gently deposited his lover on the ground steadying the smaller man as Anthony wobbled a bit.
Steve knew to leave it for a bit before going down with a peace offering, coffee, and dinner would go a long way to helping him feel better. He was pretty sure he wasn’t the reason for the upset, his theory confirmed when the doors to the lab opened and he was allowed in.
Steve had heard enough turning he quickly moved back towards the elevator trying to control the breath that was sticking in his chest, heart thundering he hurried to getaway.
A small noise off to his right derailed his train of thought. Frowning he turned listening; silence. The snow continued to drift almost lazily, and Steve heard nothing else. About to dismiss it as something conjured up by his broken brain he turned to head back when he heard it again.
Narrowing his eyes, he stepped off the path honing in on the source. Slowly parting a nearby bush he found a pair of yellow eyes staring up at him.
His lover hummed pleased lapping at him, cleaning him up before pulling off and climbing back up his body. He paused a moment to throw off his shirt, before wiggling out of his boxers. Steve readily welcoming him with a deep kiss, tasting himself on those swollen lips.
Tony hummed, eyes fluttering closed as they felt too heavy to keep them open, “Feel like I got run over by the Hulk.”
Steve picked his tray back up, stacking the dirty dishes on it as he cleaned off the table moving to return them to the back. Depositing the try he wiped his hands on his apron before returning to the front and moving behind the bar. He knew the after-work crowd would soon show for happy hour, looking for overpriced cocktails.
Steve had no idea what was going on his thoughts were hard to hold onto, his head was aching. Whomever it was seemed keen on chatting though as he continued on.
One young girl hanging back from the group caught his eye. Tony paused, watching curiously as she carefully detached from the group moving to stand before Steve. The other kids still giving him a bit of cautious space.
“M' sorry,” he mumbled voice thin, a sob just below the surface, “Just woke up alone again, and I freaked out a bit.”
Peter stared at him, “Chicken please,” Sergeant Rogers replied and Peter found his head bobbing in agreement to stunned to say anything else. The waiter bustled off, and Colonel Rhodes was levelling an amused look at them.
Peter wished he had that kind of confidence, but then again the man looked terribly impressive in dress uniform.
“Of course you do,” Steve assured him, confused and panicking a little when he saw tears in his eyes again.
Peter sighed looking at his phone, no missed messages, and it was 7:30. He glanced towards the doors of the gym, he could hear the bass thumping from out here, the happy cries and excited yells from the others. He glanced down at his cheap Spiderman costume, Ned had thought it had been clever, Peter had secretly thought so too. Only now, without Mr. Stark, he was thinking maybe he should just slip away…
It was nonsense but Steve loved it, when those words fell from his lips, loved it when Tony praised him, encouraged and begged him to keep going.
“Uh oh,” Steve muttered seconds before the building he was currently trying to vacate, gave up and come down on him.
"Small?" Steve asked curiously, he didn't mind having a big wedding if it was what Anthony wanted, but he got the feeling that wasn’t the case. Anthony liked to put on a show for the media, but when it came to himself he was a very private person.
The voice in his dreams echoed in his mind as he shook his head to clear it, had he been dreaming he was a superhero?
He grinned at him and Steve stared back through his goggles at the man he loved, "Thank you," he rasped.
It had been a busy few months Avengers wise, and with SI, it felt like they hadn’t had much time together lately, and as much as Tony loved Christmas, this year the idea of just being with Steve was what appealed to him most.
Steve gazed up at him face as impassive as always but his eyes….there was a feeling of sorrow there that made Tony's breath catch.
He sucked in a breath as heat curled in his belly, the hot thrum of lust catching him off guard as he watched Tony Stark hurry out of the bar.
“Steve's expecting me, Pepper, we are going to Bora Bora…” Tony whined following his CEO rather reluctantly.
Before Peter could ask the waiter returned with their food, unsure what to do he followed the Sergeant's lead putting his napkin in his lap. The dish looked amazing as he carefully cut into it. Beside him, Sarge had already started eating.
Reaching the elevator he jammed the button down, willing away the tears he could feel pushing against his eyes.
He glanced up at his coworker breezed into the kitchen looking wistful. Steve frowned, Tony was here?
It was chaos, men yelling, guns firing, the increscent whaling alarm…. Bucky felt like he was drowning,
At least tonight they didn’t have far to go, stepping onto the Tower elevator he pressed the button for the main floors. Beside him, Anthony was tugging on a red and white hat. Steve frowned, something about the hat…
Tony grinned at him, eyes crinkling as he shifted a little closer, “Hand to God, your gorgeous, but more than that…” he trailed off, and Steve met dark eyes as a rough palm cupped his face, Steve shivering as a callused thumb smoothed across his cheek, breath caught again and his heart hammered so hard he was worried he was going to pass out.
Steve leaned against the desk looking down at the man, careful to keep his face impassive, “Currently location of known Assets.”
Hesitantly he raised his metal hand tentatively brushing it against his lover's jaw. Anthony groaned, eyes fluttering as he took as much as he could. Steve felt the air leave his lungs as he moved his metal hand down the slender neck.
"Oh god, yes Steve," he hitched his hips, and Steve moved with him slowly, and sweet. Holding Anthony’s weight, he slowly picked up speed. Anthony was a babbling mess in his ear, egging him on.
Steve was making small distressed sounds, Tony hurried to sooth them away again. Letting Steve hold him with his real arm until blue eyes began to lose some of their dullness.
Easily navigating the bedroom, he gently dumped Anthony on the bed. Watching as the dark-eyed man rolled to his knees hurrying out of his suit coat and tossing it away. Steve shrugged out of his leather jacket, followed by his t-shirt, pausing as the sunglasses snagged on the material. Annoyed he pulled them off as well, setting them beside the table before turning back.  On the bed, Anthony had stripped in record time, Steve feeling a familiar hot brand of lust pooling in his groin at all the smooth, tanned skinned of his lover.
Tony tried not to sigh too sappily, Steve was perhaps one of the sweetest people he's ever met. He was honest to a fault and completely genuine. Steve was never anything other than himself.
“- broke Twitter today, with almost a million likes and re-tweets in just a few hours,” Tony picked up in the middle of the story as they flashed to a photo that had the hammer in Tony’s hand falling to the ground with a resounding clang. It was his Steve in those ridiculously tight, pink, shorts, unlaced combat boots, rifle on his shoulder standing before a broken coffee shop window.
Anthony didn’t leave his side for a minute, constantly keeping a hand on him, holding on as if Steve he would disappear the moment he let go. It broke Steve’s heart. He’d felt so utterly helpless when Tony had sobbed so brokenly in his arms.
Fury blinked at him, unable to hide his surprise this time, he opened his mouth before he closed it again narrowing his eyes, “Why?”
Steve didn’t say a word simply quirked a brow, he felt Peter shift a little closer to him the air rife with an uneasy tension. Steve was well used to it by now, people were generally uncomfortable around him. Only Peter seemed different, the kid wasn't intimidated by him.
The damn leather pants were getting tighter, and Steve was ready to get them off. With one last kiss, he stood to do just that, Anthony’s hands stalling him, curious he watched as his boyfriend looked up at him through dark lashes, “Let me…”
They were moving then, Anthony pulling him close once more. The soft ding announced their destination and Steve was easily moving them, pleased when Anthony was gasping and withering against him. He knew his lover enjoyed a little manhandling, and Steve was happy to indulge, careful to keep his strength in check.
Steve shivered at the rasp of his beard against his own sensitive skin as he teased first one leg then the other. Steve biting his lips he tried to keep from moaning, Tony was moving closer, his erection heavy between his legs.
The man nodded, smiling at him, Steve losing himself in those intense eyes. There was something so familiar about him as if he knew the man…intimately.
His fiancée looked about to say more when suddenly Buck was yelling for Iron Man and they remembered they were in the middle of a battle.
"Thank you, ma'am," he rasped to his Aunt before turning his attention to him. Peter waved his Aunt away as she turned him mouthing 'wow' before returning to her packing.
"Thanks again Mr. Rogers, oh and it is a costume party, but Mr. Stark totally doesn’t need a costume. Thanks again, bye!”
“I love you,” Anthony said then, the words tumbling with emotion, “I love you so much, and I don’t deserve you at all.”
Tony knew the words to be the truth as he found himself collapsing shakily once more, helpless tears running from his eyes again as he clutched tight to the man that was center of his world.
“Was there even Halloween in the ‘30s?” Clint sassed, arrow landing in one of the things that hadn’t noticed crawling towards his boot. He tossed Clint a wave of thanks before he was moving again.
Steve grunted looking towards the muffled voice as it approached, he squinted as the fuzzy outline of a person got closer, great his glasses and hearing aid where gone. He glared in the general direction of the voice.
Tony tried to keep a lid on his anger, but it simmered just under his skin. He knew Pepper meant well, she was just looking out for him, for the company; it wasn't personal. Well, it was, but it wasn't petty personal…it was just business.
Steve said nothing but was secretly pleased when Buck elbowed the man in the side, “Shut up, It’s really nice, and thank you by the way, for bailing us out.”
“ ‘Stark seen out and about with new beau’,” the man read aloud before he chuckled, "Looks an awful lot like you in the photo."
Clint was flat out sleeping on the floor sprawled on his back as he snored softly. Sam and Bucky leaned into each other, both hovering on the edges of sleep, and Steve’s steady breaths near his face were comforting.
“I have one more thing to do,” he explained, Peter opened his mouth but Steve shook his head, “Not this time Peter, make sure to get these guys get back.”
Steve took out one of the odd, darkly winged creatures with a well-placed shot. Only half-listening to the archer complaints.
"So we're in the middle of a firefight when out of nowhere Stevie shows up like a goddamn avenging angel, calm as you please,” Bucky waved his hands for emphasis as everyone laughed.
He just managed to tuck his legs as his unplanned flight took him right through a Starbucks storefront. Glass shattering, he skidding through chairs and tables before coming to rest against the counter.
Steve nodded following Tony into the massive kitchen, amazed at the size of it. It was bigger than his entire apartment.
“Broken white boy you came to visit!” Shuri approached them not the least bit intimidated by the ex-assassin, hugging him before she pulled away grinning.
Still chuckling Anthony was nuzzling into him again with a contented sigh, a comfortable quiet as Steve idly ran his hands up and down the muscled back on his lover, waiting.
“That’s good,” Tony was relived, he’d been so worried about leaving Steve alone, but if Peter was with him then they could keep each other company. "I won't keep you, I just wanted to call and let you know where I am. I'll let you get back to lunch, call you tomorrow.”
So, they sat in silence a long while, Anthony eating most of the tray before he finally spoke, “I had a shitty day,” he finally breathed looking at the distant wall of the workshop. Steve nodded, he understood some days were just shitty.
He glanced at her expectantly, but she shook her head slowly, “I wish I could Tones really, but I'm leaving for Geneva…remember? That green energy deal?”
Tony leaned against Steve, the big man perched on a stool watching him with those sky-blue eyes, “Not really.”
At least that had been the plan right up until some cliché witch had ruined it. Now he was just wanted a quiet night in, he guessed he was getting domesticated.
Calmer, Tony pulled back resting his forehead against his husband as he felt a metal thumb gently swipe at the tears on his cheeks.
Peter spoke up then, “We’re surprising Mr. Stark with a big party on Christmas Eve. We’ve talked to Captain Danvers, and Colonel Rhodes and Doctor Pym, and Ms. Van Dyne and-”
Sighing he rolled to his side to stare at the wall instead, this was not how he pictured his Christmas vacation. Both Ned and MJ were headed away with their families for the break and him…
He spotted Sam and Buck already at the table, and his sweat-soaked lover frowning furiously from the island. Pausing to peck Steve on the cheek he headed to the coffee maker.
The moment was quiet and safe as they settled into it. Steve let his mind drift a little, still sorting through the odd overlapping thoughts he was having.
Steve grunted, Anthony’s words washing over him, sweet and sticky as he moved him. He loved those words, his voice, his praise.
Steve continued on his path heading for the pair, eyes on Iron Man. Sam could barely get the words out, but Bucky seemed to get the gist he turned with a frown finally spotting Steve eyes going comically round.
Steve nodded, looking understanding, without a word he was lifting him into his arms, Tony used to the manhandling by now leaned against a wide shoulder as he was carried into their shared bedroom and gently deposited on the bed.
He still felt heavy, weighted down, his joints ached, and he was hot. Turning he felt his metal arm pulling at his shoulder joint, irritated he pawed at it fingers feeling clumsy and thick. He knew there was a spot…he felt the small depression in the metal plating pressing it he felt the arms release falling away as he groaned in relief.
The man seemed amused nodding again, but before Peter could say more he heard Ned, "Come on Parker is he here yet? People are starting to think you…” he turned just as Ned trailed off, he knew the second his friend caught sight of Mr. Rogers; his eyes bugged out of his head.
Before he could ask though, the elevator had arrived and a wash of music and laughter hit them as the doors opened. Grinning Anthony pecked him on the cheek before he was off the elevator waving to people he knew.
Still, he wanted to marry Anthony, more than anything he wanted to make it official to the world. He loved him, Steve honestly couldn’t imagine not having the man in his life. He wanted desperately to get him a ring, perhaps it was something to do with his old-fashioned sensibilities. Only the more he learned about rings the less he thought a traditional wedding ring would be practical. Anthony was an engineer, he worked with his hands constantly, around dangerous machines. Machines that could pinch rings to fingers, he learned about ring avulsion and had been horrified at the idea. Just last week Anthony had broken several fingers during a fight and he’d had to pry the metal gauntlet off.
“I liked Japan,” Clint added in his two sense as the battle started winding down, aliens having decided that perhaps Earth wasn’t as easy a target as they’d thought.
His husband was silent a long while as they enjoyed the closeness, Steve unconsciously swaying to the music.
Nodding he making his way across the crowded dining room, Steve was gone but as he stepped out of the main room and into the hallway he spotted him near the coatroom.
He blinked, she was looking at him green eyes narrowed in irritation, he nodded slowly as she shook her head before moving away again.
Steve couldn’t rest, vibrating with energy as they drew closer to the compound. All he wanted was to see Anthony. He’d been gone almost two weeks, two very long, very lonely weeks.
“M’ok,” he managed through gritted teeth. He may feel like hell, but they still had a job to do; superhero’s don’t get sick days.
The teenagers, parents, and teachers, alike were eyeing him rather wearily. Peter, the sweet kid that he was, stayed nearby chatting a mile a minute, it reminded him of Anthony. Peter’s friends Ned and MJ, had seemed to warm up to him as well. He did appreciate the effort, perhaps coming dressed as a killer robot was not his best idea, but no one had ever accused him of being a thinker.
Steve sighed heavily, giving the kid another nudge. The crowd around him refused to budge. Growling audibly Steve stepped forward, suddenly the students were eager to move opening a direct path to Anthony. Giving another pleased grunt he followed the nervous-looking Peter as they moved through the people.
Tony snorted that was putting it mildly, it had been an utter failure. It was supposed to be a huge contract, bringing green energy to the EU, it would have been monumental, and they’d balked at every turn. He’d tried everything he could think of but not a single thing actually helped. They’d actually turned him down…him, Tony Stark.
"That's ok," Steve replied, Tony, frowned it was hard to tell sometimes what sort of emotion Steve was feeling simply from his tone. With his ruined vocal cords it was often just a husky rasp.
Steve shrugged at him, his placid face looking unbothered, “And thanks for helping me live out a little high school fantasy of my own.”
“I’m not sure she got the memo it was Halloween,” Anthony quipped, “Pretty sure this is just an everyday look.”
The others were silent for a moment before Sam and Clint were groaning rolling their eyes. Bucky grinned at him widely, “I got that reference.”
He’d been in bed when the alarm had sounded, and as a testament to how bad he'd been feeling at the time, he hadn't even changed into his undersuit, simply calling his suit around him in his pj’s. Now he stood barefoot in baggy sweats, and an oversized tank top of Steve’s sporting his Winter Solider star.
Tony whined as Steve reached out a metal arm snagging the side of the boxcar and hauling himself off the horse and onto the train. The horse galloped away and Steve pulled himself back onto the boxcar nonchalantly.
“Worth it,” he winked at him as he slid off the bed, pausing he reached out Steve eagerly took it following as Anthony lead them to the bathroom.
“So, Stevie went to Peter’s high school to chaperone their dance?” Bucky’s smiled matched Tony’s own.
Clean he stepped out of the shower towelling off when he heard the faint cry from the bedroom. Worried he wrapped a towel around his waist stepping into the darkened room. He spotted his husband immediately, the blue glow in his chest heaving with his breath.
“Steve!” he breathed all but throwing himself at his fiancée, pleased when big arms gathered him close.
Be blinked sure he was hallucinating, before he rubbed his eyes roughly, he must be dreaming there was no way…
“We used to, in the early days, have a thing at the Tower, on Christmas Eve we’d get together and have a little party and watch movies, together.”
Sighing he reluctantly followed as Pepper steered him towards the common area, he wasn’t sure what she was doing but as they drew closer he heard music. Assuming Rhodey must have some sort of Christmas movie playing, he followed Pepper into the room…and froze.
Wanda stared at him, wondering if he was joking, Steve did seem to have a truly warped sense of humour by times.
100% done, all he wanted to do was hide from the world for a little while. Filled with righteous anger he stepped into the bedroom, where a welcome sight met him. Steve lay stretched out on the bed in his underwear looking all sorts of beautiful.
Sighing she turned, ready to head out again when the air before her shimmered and crackled, glowing a faint yellow before swirling and opening to reveal Strange, the Winter Soldier, and the Spider Kid.
He heard her sigh as she headed out before directing his concentration back to party planning. He needed to up his decoration game at the compound for sure, maybe he could find a way to freeze the lake so they could skate…
“Buck! Have you see Steve today?” he tried to keep the concern from his voice, but he felt it seeping in around the edges.
Steve was wrapping his arms around him pulling him close, “Nope, ‘sides you do enough for both of us.”
“Should have waited on the farm,” he sighed to himself, self-conscious in the suit he wore. He had thoroughly enjoyed meeting the Barton family, they’d been welcoming and sweet.
“To Tony and Steve, the two best friends…” James Barnes trailed off, voice quivering as he blinked rapidly.
"Steve," he breathed feeling a throb in his chest, and heat behind his eyes, “You did…all this?” he gestured around trying not to let the quaver in his voice through.
“Steve!” he could hear Anthony in his ear seconds before it was drowned out by the cascade of brick and mortar.
Steve sat in the workshop idly playing catch with Dum-E as he waited for Anthony to call. With the thirteen-hour time difference, it was very late, or very early, depending on how you looked at it. He hadn’t gotten around to sleeping himself, but he never slept well without Anthony anyway,
Opening his phone to message Steve he saw the notification from Twitter, and his eyebrows raised. With Steve’s recent rise to social media stardom, he'd made more of an effort to keep tabs on the current goings-on. As much as he blustered about it, he was happy to see Steve getting so much positive attention. He wanted the world to see Steve the way he did. Not some faceless failed Hydra experiment, but as a man, genuine, caring compassionate…
Moving his hands to Anthony’s hips he was about to gently turn him wanting desperately to sink into him, to feel that perfect heat clenching him tightly. He shifted and Anthony was pulling back, “Steve,” he breathed voice almost as raspy as his own. He paused smoothing a hand through dark hair.
“Don’t think I didn’t notice those leather pants, you’re wearing love,” he muttered under his breath knowing Steve would hear.
He couldn’t help the words falling from his lips rapid-fire, was he actually going on the mission with the Winter Soldier?
Steve looked up at him, his face was fuzzy, distorted, overlapping. More pictures where flashing through his head painfully. Tony and him together…..a life lived…
Snuggling with Antony on the couch he ignored the movie, for the most part, his focus on the man in his arms, Worry creeping in as the man collapsed into him falling asleep soon after. He looked so pale and fragile…had he slept?
“So you came to invite me to a party for Tony?” the Colonel sounded fondly exasperated and Peter relaxed a little, maybe they wouldn’t get into too much trouble.
Steve woke slowly, something unusual for him, normally it was rather sudden. He moved through the layers of muzzy sleep slowly becoming aware of the tender kisses pressing along his shoulder blades and the warm rough hands caressing his chest and abs gently.
Steve couldn’t speak, swallowing thickly he nodded seconds before he felt those warm lips press against his. Stars exploded behind his eyes as Tony kept it sweetly chaste, pulling away with a pleased grin and pink cheeks.
“I’m trying to get in contact with the Guardians and Captain Danvers," Steve answered, Peter, let out a low breath behind him.
He'd been supposed to be going with Anthony to China, he often joined his boyfriend on business trips, sometimes in the capacity as a bodyguard, but more so in the role of ‘kept man' as Sam and Bucky liked to tease him. It didn't faze Steve, he had no problem being Anthony’s kept man.
He hissed, whimpering clenching his hands as his own erection dripped between his legs heavy and hard, he felt loose, his limbs trembling as Tony worked him before he felt a slick finger gently pressing into him. Steve arched back into the finger wanting more. His brain was absolute mush as Tony slide in a second digit, crooking them so perfectly stars danced behind his eyes and more precum dribbled from him soaking the bed below.
“Again,” Tony commanded and the clip played, Sam and Clint both were on their phones already laughing.
Peter’s eyes went as wide as saucers, Steve felt his lips twitch the kids around them murmuring and pointing.
“Remember when you forgave me?” Steve said seconds before he closed the distance kissing his husband soundly, surrounded by family and friends they celebrated an ending, and Steve hoped…a new beginning.
A big hand gently carded through his hair, “I don’t know why…it wasn’t a bad day…it’s just…” he trailed off giving a frustrated grunt before craning a look up at the beautiful solemn face. “It’s fine, I’m just…” but he didn’t know what. He struggled to put a voice to the odd tangle of emotions in him.
The doors closed behind them but they didn’t move, neither wanting to part from the intimate contact, Steve rolling his hips lightly, knowing he was driving his lover crazy. Anthony finally managed to gasp out, “Little help Fri.”
Stephen nodded hand moving as he opened the portal, the Sergeant nodded his thanks before he paused, “See you Friday?”
He certainly knew he’d never been to anything like this before, the music thumped in his chest, the lights low as the kids danced together. Although he wouldn’t call it dancing per se …but he guessed it was what passed for dancing these days.
“Would you be…” a stick snapping behind him gave him pause, he whipped around scanning the tree line, eyes narrowed.
His thoughts were getting harder to hold onto as Tony’s hand moved higher, teasing his nipples and running along his ribs, soft, exploratory…like he hoped to memorize everything about him. Steve luxuriated in the touch, breath catching as Tony trailed kisses down his neck and to his shoulder.
He felt Steve press his right hand to his forehead, making a soft grunt of surprise, “You’re burning up.”
Grunting he pulled himself into wakefulness enjoying the attention, bringing his hands up to catch his lovers, he turned his head, capturing those teasing lips for a more heated kiss. Fuzzy memories from the night before leaked in, he remembered the party, Anthony had been so happy…then…
“It’s ok because we’re going to throw a Christmas Eve party like we did in the old days before…” he trailed off shaking his head, he didn’t want to go down that path.
“To see Strange,” he explained as they rounded the corner and the ominous-looking stone building on Bleecker Street appeared.
“Would it make you feel better if I wore an indecently tight shirt, and you threw some money around?”
He nodded rolling his head back to meet warm lips, “Yes,” he breathed before Tony captured them kissing him deeply, as his hand gently teased and caressed his waist and stomach.
Steve snorted in disbelief, he laboured under no delusions, he was five nothing, hundred pounds soaking wet, his glasses were thick as coke bottles, his hearing aid was bulky, and that didn't even begin to touch on the laundry list of ailments that plagued him.
Steve complied feeling Peter draw closer as they were lead further into the house, to something that resembled an office where Strange floated in midair reading a book.
“I’m alight, I fell off the train,” he growled slowly gaining his feet ignoring the pain in his chest. “Again,” he added; the others groan.
“Who?” She mumbled faintly still staring at one of the now numerous canvas that leaned around the walls of various sizes.
Suddenly they weren’t alone, a large figure materialized out of the tree line, powerful arms grabbing one of the tentacles as it lashed out. Rocket only glanced at the newcomers a moment before he turned his attention back to the fight.
Bucky was looking nostalgic again, a sort of dreamy far off look in his eyes, "Did you have Halloween dances?" Sam asked him curiously.
He sat on the side of the bed tenderly brushing his hair, massaging his scalp as he patiently waited. A small meow came from fluffy black lump tucked against Steve’ chest and Tony smiled, CC has kept him company.
He was already designing a new and improved arm in his head, something with all the bells and whistles. He was sure he could also make it lighter, more efficient, better motor control. The media was already descending, and people were slowly coming out from where they’d been hiding. They always tried to take the fight away from the populace, but they didn’t choose where their villains decided to implement their plans. They always tried to stay though and help out where they could.
It was long moments later before they finally managed to subdue the mammoth creature. Drax still yelling and slashing at the monster as the rest of them stepped back finally taking note of the newcomers to their midst.
Steve shrugged non-committal, turning he continued on before Tony could comment further, the other man falling in step with him, slowing his pace to match.
“But Steve it’s Christmas,” he said as if that explained everything, as he squirmed in his lap until he was straddling it. Steve felt the roughed palms of his lover cupping his face, as dark eyes looked at him intent.
He really shouldn’t have got his hopes up, Mr. Stark was amazing, but he’s known him coming was going to be a long shot.  He’d seen the news today there’d been trouble around Massachusetts and the Avengers had been called out, no doubt they were still there.
Turning he headed out of the room and to the garage, “Let the others know I’m headed out please Fri,” he rasped, pausing to grab Buck’s keys. He was sure Cap wouldn’t mind. Kicking the bike to life he headed out into the night.
He fell hard and fast for the little fluff. Grunting he opened his jacket carefully tucking the kitten inside to warm up.
“Tony!” he recognized the one that yelled, it was hard not to, Captain America was legendary, Bucky Barnes was in all the history books.
Steve was about to apologize when he felt that mouth move lower, trailing down to tease his nipples before moving on. Glancing down he watched as that dark head licked at his already throbbing erection. He loved to watch Anthony blow him. There was something so erotic about the way his lips stretched over him, the way his jaw worked, and tongue teased.
Steve looked up from his cereal and Stark pad cautiously curious, “Yes Friday?” he inquired politely, voice a little rougher than normal that morning. He hadn’t slept well despite the warm press of Anthony at his side; his dreams full of death and destruction.
He was trying though, listening intently to what others were saying about the pieces, doing his best to see it through their eyes to be able to appreciate it properly. Only where they saw a ‘bold statement about the current state of the economy’ he saw where CC their cat had spilled paint and stomped through it across the canvas.
Tony lifted his hand kissing metal knuckles, “That’s good?” he ventured, he wasn’t sure if Steve had wanted to sell his work.
Steve couldn't help the smugness that settled on him, he had done an excellent job on the ring. Anthony had been touched he’d put so much thought into picking it out not just for what it meant but also for its functionality and practicality. He’d had it inscribed on the inside, with ‘remember when’ and when Anthony saw it he'd been close to tears.
Sighing he tapped the end of the pencil against his list reading his choices over again, before finally circling one decisively.
“Honeymoon,” Tony, Bucky, and Rhodes all answered in unison and Steve found himself giving a wheezy laugh.
Steve felt a warm lassitude wash over him, content and peaceful. He could see this…see them together, just like this always…closing his eyes to rest as well he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. Muttering to himself and careful not to dislodge Anthony’s feet from his lap he fished it out frowning at the screen.
He realized he’d been silent a long while, completely lost in the sudden fantasy, he had no idea what he’d ask.
He turned his attention back to the papers before him, trying not to be hurt. Steve wasn’t a big texter, he knew that. But if Tony was away without him he did try, only his phone had been eerily silent.
Tony snorted, sniffing as he wiped at his eyes, “You’re late," he said trying to make a joke to lighten the mood, even as his chest felt fit to burst.
The picture came up on the far screen, and Steve felt a smile tug his lips as his fiancée appeared on the screen. Only to fall when he saw how tired, and strained he looked. Frowning he moved closer, reading the small print at the bottom of the screen, ‘Stark addresses allegations of sexual harassment’.
Steve hadn’t even noticed the movie had ended, the others were quietly giving him well wishes as they departed for bed. He nodded to them before he carefully gathered his husband close carrying him to bed, tenderly tucking him in and brushing dark hair back lovingly. Pressing a kiss to his brow he felt his lips twitch as he gave a small huff wiggling deeper into the bed breath evening out.
Steve grunted turning in the others embrace so he lay facing the man, chest constricting when he saw the raw emotion in dark eyes.
“The Winter Soldier is inviting you to a Christmas party and you’re declining?" The woman was glaring at him in disbelief.
He landed harder than normal stumbling and wincing as his head throbbed. Taking a moment, he breathed painfully through his nose, he closed his eyes, wishing he could just lay down right where he was and call it a day. Just contemplating the clean-up, they had to do, and the debrief… he wanted to cry.
It was hard to explain even to himself, let alone to explain it to someone else. The thoughts skittered around in his head as Steve kissed his way determinedly down his neck, hand slipping up his shirt gentle caresses sweet and tender. Yet Tony had to fight the compulsion to back away and put some distance between them. He loved Steve, with his heart, loved having sex with him, really loved it, and he knew Steve was initiating; but he just didn’t feel it.
Peter froze mid-chew, but Sergeant Rogers seemed unconcerned, “Chicken’s dry,” he commented completely unphased.
Laughing a flushed Anthony made his way over pressing a hot open-mouthed kiss on him. There were more cheers from the party as Steve pulled Anthony into his lap deepening the contact. It was long moments before they parted, Steve swiping a metal thumb across his cheek as he smiled at his husband.
His voice was so small and so scared, it tore at his heart. Tenderly kissing his head he kept up his soothing ministrations running big hands across his back and over his hip.
Anthony’s laugh echoed over the coms, “Alright hipster where do you want to go? If you say Russia I may hit you.”
Steve nodded again, the dark-haired man gave him a long assessing look before Steve thought perhaps some of the severe lines around his mouth softened a little.
Steve gasped, moaning softly before he felt Tony move sitting up, easily manhandling him upright, tenderly pulling off the loose t-shirt, before shedding his own. Steve gasped softly eyes immediately on the soft blue glow in his chest, the pulsing light between them. Fascinated he forgot for a moment the about his own skinny self until Tony was leaning over him running his hands across the taught skin of his hips, and the raised ridges of his ribs.
Tony hummed moving into the kitchen, smiling a secret smile at the sweet ache in his lower back; totally worth it.
He woke disoriented and confused the room dark and quiet. Something moved behind him, a warm, heavy arm draped across his waist pulling him closer.
Pulling his mask down Steve spotted movement off to his right, turning he felt his lips twitch up in a smile.
Steve rolled his eyes, he didn’t get this social media phenomenon. Tony and the PR people had assured him it was a good thing. They'd even encouraged him to get his own Twitter and start using it but he wasn’t interested. He didn’t see a point to it really, and if that made him a little old fashioned he was ok with it.
He knew Buck was struggling, he didn’t want to admit it, often deflecting when Steve brought it up, not that he pushed, Steve knew he was the last person to confront anyone about their issues. He had found his therapy very helpful, and wished Bucky could get past his own antiqued sensibilities and embrace the 21
“Lunch?” Anthony asked linking their arms together as they headed out of SI and into the street. Steve grunted, he was always up for lunch. Chuckling Anthony steered them away from the building.
Steve caught him hauling him close and Tony buried his face in his neck all the emotion he’d been feeling the last month and a half tumbling out as he wept into his husband's neck unable to form coherent thoughts.
He nodded offering the man a hopeful smile. Sergeant Rogers was moving to sit beside him, Peter hurrying to follow suit.
“No it’s not ok Steve, and you did not overact. They were complete assholes, I should throw them all out of the Tower. They should have kept their fucking mouths shut.”
“I’m right here love, right here,” he soothed rubbing across his back, coaxing his love gently into wakefulness. Murmuring soft words of love, he pressed a kiss to his face, tasting the faint salty tang. He knew Steve hadn’t moved from the bed today, lost in his head and unable to do the most basic of things. He didn’t have days this bad often, but when he did, Tony’s heart always broke.
Steve absently listened as he made his way towards the red and gold figure standing off to the side of the group. Anthony spotted him making his way towards him offering a smile, Steve pulled his earpiece out the others still talking.
She didn’t say a word though, simply looked up at Steve before she carefully turned and for the first-time Tony noticed the girl was missing her left arm. His breath caught in his throat, as he watched his fiancée slowly lower, somewhat awkwardly, to his knee. Steve didn’t say a word angling his shoulder so the young girl could see the empty metal socket.
He hadn’t realized how cold he was until Tony was wrapping a blanket around him, “It’s ok we’ll be back soon.”
A small soft alarm alerted him that Buck was looking for him for a run. His body felt heavy today though, his mind fuzzy and scattered. He didn’t want to run.
“I’m coming birdbrain…” the man gritted out before he was turning back to Steve. With one last sweet smile he was sliding bills across the bar, before with a wink he was turning and the group was leaving as loudly as they came.
“Anthony, love it’s fine, I’m looking forward to getting away,” he answered honestly, and he was. He was very much looking forward to leaving tomorrow. Just he and Anthony for two weeks, no winter, no calls, no one else…it sounded like heaven.
Tony tried to backpedal within the confided space but the young man was reaching for him. With no alternative, Tony expertly caught his wrist and with little effort twisted the man’s arm back while moving behind him. Not enough to injure, but enough to be uncomfortable.
Steve grunted nodding as they followed the flow of people out of the gym and into the night. Tony hung back a little watching his leather-clad lover walk away from him, those pants were doing everything for him. God lord the man was pure sex.
“Right here Sergeant," Peter pointed out before he nimbly jumped the fence and hurried up the steps. All youthful energy and excitement.
“Friday pause and pull up the news," he insisted, the room erupting in an argument. He shushed them as Friday replayed the story, complete with picture and hashtag. The room was utterly silent all eyes turning to Steve who seemed unconcerned by the whole thing.
Bruce let out an impressed whistle, no wonder Tony hadn’t heard from Steve the man must not have slept if he’d managed to get in touch with everyone.
Steve clenched his jaw before he turned glaring murder at nothing as he made for the elevator; he’d almost forgot about Peter hurrying after him.
Recognizing the voice he stuck his head around the wall that was Sergeant Rogers, “Hi Colonel Rhodes.”
“Stevie we’re watching movies if you want to join, apparently, they are Halloween ones.” Bucky appeared around the corner smiling at him brightly, before grabbing bag chips and disappearing back the way he’d come.
Tony could only stare at the screen, beside him his phone was pinging with a message again, and his computer blipped with several more emails.
“Affirmative,” the Winter Soldier nodded before he turned to his younger companion the kid had something in his hands and was pointing it around, “Come on Peter we need to get going.”
Thankfully, they had everyone out for the call so it didn’t drag out. But Tony would be lying if he didn’t admit he wanted to weep with relief as Cap was calling them in. Tony couldn’t even bring himself to razz Cap more about his date night.
Ned was still staring in open-mouthed shock, Peter nudged him, his friend snapping it shut before he turned running back into the dance. Peter shook his head,  “Sorry about that, would you like to come in have a snack?”
“Tony this is a huge deal, the investors aren’t comfortable unless you’re there…they’re threatening to nix the whole deal.”
Just as the thoughts crossed his head he felt Steve pulling back, his kisses and wandering hands stopping.
Tony was not nearly as awake as he needed to be for this conversation, “What are you talking about?”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers…. thank you so much for coming,” he looked at them wide-eyed, Tony couldn’t help but return the smile.
Peter couldn’t believe it, he rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, “You…you came…” he found himself stuttering out in surprise.
He tensed when the doors at the far end of the gym banged open, hand automatically going for his concealed knife, he was halfway across the room when he realized just who it was that’d thrown the doors open. A familiar red and gold metal suit entered, and the students around him seemed to lose their minds.
Steve nodded dutifully following along, he had no idea what the party was for, but overall he felt he was getting pretty good at these social functions. Anthony had a lot of them to attend and he’d just accepted it as part of what it meant to be Anthony Stark’s boyfriend, he didn’t mind too much there was always food.
It was the only warning he had seconds before whatever the hell large ass lizard grabbed him by the waist and hauled him upwards.
"Thanks, Pep," he hung up, giving in to the compulsion as Steve cocked a curious head, “They changed their minds.”
The others agreed apparently ready to move on, Steve forced himself to look back at the man embarrassed he hadn’t even served him a drink…
Steve pulled the trigger one last time, watching satisfied as the alien stalled out before plummeting to the ground. Relaxing his finger off the trigged he grunted a “Clear,” over the com’s listening to the echo from Bucky, Sam, Natasha, and the booming, jovial voice of Thor.
“Oh my god is that Doctor Pym?”  A much younger voice drew his attention as Hank spotted the wide-eyed teenager that had followed him off the elevator.
Tony made an irritated noise, "Some low-level goons, hoping for a quick buck they never would have got within feet of you if you hadn’t….” he trailed off but Steve knew.
The room was decorated with big pine trees, that glowed with twinkling white lights, stings of multi-coloured lights were strung from the ceiling, red bows and evergreen branches decorating the space. Something painful skittered across his mind, he was forgetting something. He frowned, looking down at his hands.
Only his partner was somewhere in the middle of the Russian wilderness, and he was here alone trying on his suit.
Steve rolled his eyes as they settled skimming the menus. Steve was intrigued to see it was an Asian fusion menu and ended up ordering a bunch of interesting-looking things.
“We went to space!” The kid piped up, and Bucky was sure at this point he must have been shot because he had to be hallucinating.
The Spider Kid was out of the portal then, squatting as the little balls of fuzz chirped and vibrated vying for his attention.
He was such a fool…Tony was so far out of his league it was laughable, what would he ever see in him?
Tony closed his eyes breath still hitching faintly, he felt weak, dizzy, he wanted to melt into the broad chest of his lover. He gave a soft grunt as Steve pulled him closer settling back into the bed tucking Tony into his side.
He heard an almost collective intake of breath from both the reporters and the others. Anthony started down at him jaw working, and Steve was beginning to feel those lingering doubts beginning to surface. What if Anthony didn’t want to marry him?
Grunting he shifted planting his feet firm pulling Anthony down, and that was it, with a long low wail he was coming apart in his arms. Steve rocking him up once more and down before he was following his lover with a grunt, wrapping his arms tightly around the smaller man as they both heaved for breath.
Bruce laughed taking a sip of his coffee, it’d been a complete coincidence that he’d happened to be at the conference while Tony was in town. He was actually heading home this afternoon when Tony had called to invite him for breakfast.
