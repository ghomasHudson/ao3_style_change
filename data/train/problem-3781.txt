“What? Don’t you like porn?” Dean shouted over the sexy music, a shit-eating grin plastered on his face. “Remember that one time you watched it with us?”
“...well, everyone's a little scatterbrained, even Einstein lacked some marbles.” Dean shrugged, remembering how he used to do that, too. Ben laughed.
The inside of the room was different- more mature than before. One of his old Pokemon posters was replaced by a
“Okay, let’s save that talk for when we’re at the house, there's no need for me to crash the car cause you wanna Veronica Sawyer the kid.” Dean cleared his throat, and Ben was thankful for that, because first of all, he didn’t want to argue right now, and second of all, he wanted to eat his burger.
“Nephilim!” He shrugged, then he furrowed his brows. “...well, kinda. It's confusing now...but this won't hurt me! I promise!”
“It’s a bit early for that, don’t you think?” Mary said slowly, calming down from thinking her boys snuck out and murdered innocents.
Dean felt hands grab him by the shirt and then yanking it off, taking the hex bag with it and freeing him. He saw Sam, still shaky from the spell work cast on him, throw away the shirt to the ground and help his demonic brother up. Cas had run over to the witch with an angel blade in hand, grabbing the smaller girl and putting it to her throat.
Dean: https://randomgooberness.tumblr.com/post/637155000675647488/hello-everyone-and-welcome-to-goob-redesigns
This fic is named after the song Va from the beginner's guide soundtrack, and it can be heard here: https://youtu.be/eRFj6IS4HqM
“Dean what the fuck?” Sam's voice was monotone as if he expected it, but he was still pissed. Gabriel laughed in the background, and Cas remained focused on Pudding.
Dean kicked forward, a newfound adrenaline pulsing through his veins as the memory was forced through him. The witch yelped and fell back, covering her now bleeding nose. As she was stunned for a few seconds, Dean grabbed his gun bolted over to the net, and attempted to hack through it with a knife.
“I’m not a Knight anymore, Sam.” He finally replied. “I don’t have the mark anymore, either. I’m just like a normal demon now, hell I could die from a demon blade if someone took a swing at me. That's probably a stupid thing to tell my terminator brother, but that's not the point.” He rambled, scratching at his head. “I’m just as easy to fight as Meg or Ruby or some shit. There wouldn't be a point in trying to leave.”
It’s the way things are to be; this work, this small town, this life. Dean simply isn’t like Sam. He isn’t good at school. He doesn’t have big things headed his way. He has no real aspirations other than to get by. Working right here his whole life is about the best thing that could happen to him. So he accepts it. When the time comes, it would be his. And that would be that. People like Sam and Castiel...they would leave this place. Castiel would play the piano for a living in some big city, make a name for himself. Sam would go to college, law school, maybe. Something fancy. But Dean would stay behind. He doesn’t curse them for it. If anything, he’s happy they’re the type of people who will find their way someplace else. It’s simply how things are supposed to be, and Dean knows it all too well.
“Thought this might be a little easier for ya,” Dean tells him, staring out over the water. Castiel looks up at him in wonder, blinking in slow surprise.
Castiel gives him a long, knowing look. “Did you ever tell anybody you gave the Archangel Michael a handjob in the backseat of your car?”
Castiel handle him, so eager to be touched that he’s willing to let Castiel pull his hair, expose his throat for Castiel to press his mouth to the heated skin. He surges closer and Dean begins mumbling under his breath.
“Which is precisely why we didn’t say that it was him. I was...hoping that you would face him yourself. That you would make that choice for yourself. If we had told you it was Lucifer, you would have panicked.”
“Yeah, and then that kid would have been bleeding out his face instead of me,” Dean snaps angrily. Castiel glares at him.
“Your brother has to be stopped,” Dean says quietly. “What he is doing...isn’t a coincidence. He must be planning to raise the Devil from the cage, possibly with the help of other demons.”
“I’m not going to let you do this,” Castiel says slowly. “I can find the witch. I can stop her before she breaks another Seal and innocent people will not have to get hurt. It is needless to do this when we have the ability to find her! You’re angels, aren’t you? Warded off or not, you should be able to find her and kill her yourself!”
“You tell me, Dean,” John says lowly. “But you’re right. I don’t trust you anymore. Not since you started hanging around with that Castiel kid. Not since you started getting a smart mouth with me. You and Sam are staying right here where I can keep an eye on you both. End of story.”
Castiel nods, his eyes wide and dazed as he tries to understand where to start. “Yes. Pour me some too, please.”
“These were her drawings,” she says. “Joanne was a good artist in her own right, but she always drew such dark things.”
“He’s dead. He’s the one who found this place, actually. And then he died. Put a gun in his mouth and killed himself.”
Eventually, she leaves - important business to return to. But she promises to come back to visit. Castiel can tell Dean is worried about her, still. Angel infighting is serious. Dead angels are dead family members, even if Dean has no immediate plans to return to heaven.
“I understand it,” Dean says quietly. His green eyes are distant, miles away as they turn to look at Castiel with sorrow that surprises Castiel. “Trust me. All angels are my siblings...my brothers and sisters...but I had a brother who I was closest to. Samuel. He...he rebelled. Fell. And I have not seen him in many eons.”
With a heavy overcoat draped over his shoulders, John stops just in front of the couch and peers at the two with a raised eyebrow. He’s due for a shave — Dean knows that his father’s lack of hygiene typically indicates that he’s been busy. Or drinking more than usual.
” he growls. “And you’re not moving from that spot. I run this camp and I don’t need you walking around making everything
Castiel smiles at him but says nothing more. Not that Dean is surprised. Castiel and his secrets -- it’s something Dean isn’t sure he’d ever get used to. He watches as Castiel’s eye droop with heavy sleep, and just like that, he seems years younger; a child, rather than the mysterious teenager who walks off into the night to play the piano for old men in strange, seedy bars. It makes Dean’s chest ache. All at once, he feels a protective urge wash over him that he hadn’t felt before.
Castiel doesn’t look at him. But he nods a silent ‘yes’ as he watches Gabriel play. In the middle of the yard, the world seems to spin around them, unfurling some great becoming that neither of them will ever get to see. The whole world turns around this small town, Dean realizes. Nothing happens here. Time simply moves on without them. He always knew Castiel would leave this place behind. But now, the thought of losing him for good makes Dean feel sick. His head spins, and suddenly, he’s convinced he can’t breathe.
Alastair laughs. “This is cute, I’ll give you that much, Castiel. You may be his vessel, but that doesn’t stop you from being delicately human. And now...well, quite frankly, I think that with that naughty stubbornness of yours, you’ve grown quite disposable. What do you think, Michael?”
But Castiel doesn't burn. A moment of taut silence falls between them, and when Balthazar asks if it's really, truly is him, Castiel nods and accepts the stiff, clumsy hug. Balthazar immediately demands answers that Castiel can't give. He doesn't know. He knows that there was a massive blast site around his grave and that the small cross behind the headstone had gone untouched. Between the ear-splitting noise and the scar of a handprint on his skin, it’s safe to say that something big had raised Castiel from the pit.
“You don’t have to,” Dean says quietly. “I’m fine. You...you getting outta here is important, yeah? You have to do what’s right for you and your brother.”
“That’s just the tire. Sometimes cars need new ones when they go flat. Maybe I can show you how to change a tire next time you and your brother stop by.”
He lifts his shirt, breathing a soft gasp. His abdomen is clear of any bruise, cut, or scar. There is no reminder of where the hell hounds had ripped his intestines straight from his stomach, had torn deep, irreparable rivets down through his chest. Rivers of blood, of pain that had only been but a taste of what he would feel down below where the sun doesn’t reach except to burn. Nothing. He is as clear and strong as before he had ever been touched; not even old hunting scars remain. The fatal injuries the hell hounds had torn into his flesh had stayed with him in hell, never fully healing, only being ripped open again and again and again…
“You always stood up for me when Dad was mean to me,” he whispers. “You’ve always done that. But then you’d get all the hitting instead, and I can’t take that either. Please don’t get hurt again, Dean. I can’t just watch you get hurt.”
Castiel watches in horror as Dean raises his blade, glowing, white eyes boring into his brother’s. The Devil sighs, shaking his head. His jaw is set in place as he nods once.
The two quickly climb out of the HMMWV to address the rest of the party, standing at the ready with guns slung over their shoulders and an impressive array of weaponry across their belts and strapped to their backs. If Castiel weren’t so on-edge, he’d ask where it all came from.
"Dad, you have no way of knowing if he's a queer or not," Sam points out. Dean flinches, already knowing where this is going to end up.
“Dean, it’s always like that with kids like him. I’m not saying you can’t be friends with him. Just watch your back. You know how that type gets sometimes. And you can always tell real young, too.”
Dean disappears, leaving Castiel alone in the warm, morning light. Around him, crickets chirp in the grassy weeds. A bee buzzes by his nose before settling on a patch of daisies a few feet away from the water. Feeling more confused than ever before, Castiel closes his eyes and slips into an inky blackness as the familiar dream fades out of view.
Sam shrugs again, not looking at Dean. He sits cross-legged on the floor as he begins unloading his clothes from his suitcase to fold them.
Castiel struggles, but Naomi shoves him further down onto the floor. He groans as the force of her power drives him down onto his hands and knees.
“Yeah, fancy necklace for some weirdo who was staring at us from a freakin’ tree,” Dean grumbles. Sam shrugs.
throw himself between the brothers and their father if he has to. Ugly memories of Castiel’s bruises flash across his vision, filing Dean with quiet rage.
“Benny,” Castiel groans. A trickle of blood pours down his chin where his teeth split his tongue. The pain makes him dizzy, but he hardly registers it now. “Benny,
“My brother loves music,” Castiel says after a moment. “He takes after our mother that way. This piano was hers before she died.”
It takes almost a full minute for the adrenaline to die down, and that’s when the pain hits. He gingerly rubs his arm clean of any dirt, wincing when it sends a white-hot sear of pain up his arm. He looks over, watching as the driver that nearly hit Gabriel stumbles out of the car with a dark look crossing his features. Dean watches Castiel’s expression fall into a look of dread as he looks over Gabriel’s shoulder; a flash of desperation, before he’s gingerly placing Gabriel at his side. It’s not Michael — the man has a scruffy beard and angry, sunken eyes, clearly much older than the eldest Winchester brother.
Very seriously, Castiel nods, before turning and hurrying back towards his house. Dean watches him go, shaking his head in disbelief.
Giving him an odd look, Castiel watches Dean as he approaches the large piano, running his hand gently across the surface. Sleek and black, Dean can tell the instrument has seen a number of years. The color is faded, especially on the black bench, and the keys are slightly yellow with wear. Several papers remain stuffed against the tray meant to hold sheets of music. Dean sits down on the bench, running his fingers absently across the keys before Castiel moves to sit beside him.
Before Castiel and Balthazar can say another word, Dean disappears with the faint sound of wings flapping in the quiet room. Balthazar blinks at Castiel, speechless as he throws down the iron rod he’d been holding.
Balthazar isn’t answering his phone - not even after the fourth call. Castiel slams it down on the seat divider of the old car, hands white-knuckling the steering wheel as he speeds down the interstate. He has no idea where he’s going or what he’s supposed to do next - he only knows that he has to find this girl.
Dean passes a thick swallow. Images of Castiel’s bruised, broken face strike across his vision, fast and harsh as lightning in a storm cloud.
“Sorry I couldn’t fix it,” Dean murmurs. God, this kid is weird, even if Dean feels a little bad for him. “But I really liked hearing the piano! I love Elvis, he’s so cool!”
Peering behind them, Garth pauses to look around, before pointing towards a large clearing of large boulders about twenty yards away.
A familiar sight meets his eyes: the house is burning. Sounds of gunshots echo down the hill and through the treeline, making Castiel stare in horror as explosions blow out what’s left of the windows. He shakes his head, his vision still blurry as he pushes himself off the tree and sprints up the hill, abandoning caution or any thought of being seen by Croatoans or demons. Rounding the dirt path, he forces himself to spring past the house, the tall grass tangling through his boots as he makes way for the barn on the other side of the hill.
wants to beg him to never leave him again. He wants to feel Dean pressed up against his body again, and he wants the world to be quiet enough that they can share in that together without fear.
His brother doesn’t answer his phone when Castiel tries to call from the dusty payphone box on the edge of the dirt road. It goes straight to voicemail. When he tries to call Balthazar, Balthazar hangs up with a deadly, albeit colorful, threat on his lips, unbelieving that Castiel could possibly be real. Castiel is a dead man, of course. And there are many creatures eager to take a dead man’s face. He and Lucifer had been notable hunters in their time, and Castiel is sure they’d pissed off enough of the things they hadn’t killed to make them want to use Castiel for their own benefit.  He would have to find Balthazar - or his brother - in person and hope that they wouldn’t kill him before he had time to explain that he is real.
And so, Castiel begins to play. And like everything Castiel plays, even on the old piano in desperate need of a tune, the air itself turns into a brilliant melody of liquid gold. Dean sits, terribly still, and listens to him play. The melody is perfect; not a key out of place. Its gentle pace perfectly compliments the rise and fall of the melody with careful chords filling out the sound. Whatever unreadable scribble on the page is guiding Castiel, it’s guiding him well. And when the melody changes pace, quickly jumping to a brisk tempo that almost startles Dean, Castiel is completely lost in the performance. It’s all in his eyes; Dean knows, in that instant, that Castiel has already forgotten Dean isn’t sitting directly beside him, watching him with an intensity Dean hardly understands himself. Dean has never thought about music as art before he met Castiel, but now, he understands it in full.
Jo looks around. “Good question,” she murmurs. “But that’s something for me to know, and for you to find out. I didn’t hurt anybody if that’s what you’re thinking.”
This was a story that has lived in my head for about seven years. As I said in the notes of the very first chapter, this was a very different story with a very different ship that I never finished. I'm so glad to be able to finish it like this and that it resonated with at least a few people.
“Dean, I am sixteen years old. I am not the only person in high school who has never kissed someone.”
He doesn’t tell Sam about last night. And he doesn’t tell Castiel what he knows, either. Doing so would only confirm that he’s insane for doing what he did. Because, really, he had no rational reason. But, Dean is exhausted from his lack of sleep, and when Castiel joins the brothers on their routine walk to school that morning, he’s equally as tired. The three don’t speak much. Sam, the only one of the three who seemed to have been able to sleep at all, is worried about his math test. But Dean barely hears him. He keeps sneaking glances at Castiel when he’s sure the other isn’t looking, baffled by his strange friend that he can’t seem to let go of. A pit lays heavy in his stomach. But Castiel doesn’t mention his strange plight to the bar, nor does he provide any further details about his new job. And Dean doesn’t ask; not in class, not at lunch, and not when they meet back up at the front of the school. It’s a secret, Dean knows, that would have to be his to keep. Even if he doesn't understand why..
to forget about him...and even if he did, Dean isn’t so sure that he could. Castiel isn’t “queer” - and even if he was, what does it matter…? It can’t be that big of a deal, can it?
A lanky, blonde woman seems to connect all the victims; she was friends with the victim who’d been boiled alive at the party and served as the babysitter for the family. He’s seen her before - hell, he’d questioned her yesterday. She spends time hanging around the textile warehouse near the end of the road. He thanks the couple and leaves quickly, sliding back into his car and making his way toward the site. It’s a stretch - but it’s the best lead he has. When he reaches the warehouse, foreboding and eerily quiet in the hazy morning fog, he catches a figure hurrying in through the back door, concealed by a black cloak.
seriously, overall. I wanted to lighten the mood with this a little bit before delving into some much heavier chapters that I have ready to go for the next few weeks. Thank you to everyone who's been reading and following along!
Male strip club. Honestly, it’s probably better cover anyway.” Dean pushes himself off the edge of the counter, checking his pockets as Castiel makes a noise he’s relieved Balthazar isn’t nearby to hear.
before entering somebody’s private space in heaven?” Castiel asks slowly, working to catch his breath as he passes a glare in Dean’s direction. The man beside him looks older, slightly heavy-set, and irritated beyond belief.
“Yeah. We know that everything can die - even God - but even still, this is...this is new to us. New and, quite frankly, terrifying. Garth is scouting out some of the other states across a thousand-mile radius to try and gather any other intel but...we think we might know who it is.”
“Nothing,” Castiel says. “It’s just...there is a certain irony in hearing an angel swear. You are...not like the angel who was with you the other day. I can see that...I just...I feel so lost, Dean. You say my brother isn’t dead. Then where is he? What did you do to him?”
“Samuel killed Robert’s entire charge of angels and Castiel killed him. They’re all dead.” Even now, Dean’s voice is distant and far away.
Castiel pulls his hand away sharply. “Well, I don’t blame him! There’s nothing left to fight for, Jo! Nothing. The world is going to end one way or another, and as far as I’m concerned, I’m finished trying to clean up the messes your kind decided to make.”
Thick and heavy in his hand, Dean is already fully hard by the time he grabs Castiel’s hair, sighing against his skin as his mouth explores every expanse of skin he can reach. Spurred on by the touch to the handprint, Castiel grabs Dean’s body and pulls him closer, unashamed as he sighs and gasps at every touch of Dean’s lips to Castiel’s sensitive skin. He kisses down his body as Castiel gasps and throws his head back, his tongue finding a nipple to gently lick and suck before he kisses down to his stomach. Dean is breathless the entire time - he keeps pausing to
Dean’s want pressing against his hip, the bulge in his pants twitching and aching against him, and Castiel no longer cares about God or fate or angels or even his own brother - he wants
But there’s no answer. No promise. No gentle, guiding hand he’d been promised would come in his time of need. Maybe he hasn’t been faithful enough. Maybe he’s done this all
He catches movement to his left. But his eyes never leave his brother’s wicked smile. The gun shakes in his hands and he can’t bring himself to shoot - not that regular bullets would do anything to a demon, anyway. But even if they could…
He doesn’t know where Castiel is going. But something tells Dean he likely wouldn’t see him ever again, and that wherever he would go, it would be to a place where Dean couldn’t follow.
is weird. It’s not like it matters, anyway. Dean hasn’t been thinking about girls in the past few months as much as he used to.
He does. He misses a few keys here and there, but he can hear the music, even with the keys out of tune. Castiel carefully repositions Dean’s fingers, gently encouraging him to try again. And when Dean does, he gets it perfect.
Dean swallows a thick lump in his throat. Tears drip down the eldest brother’s face. Silently, Sam motions for Dean to follow him downstairs. Numbly, Dean follows him into the kitchen, feeling his whole body shake and tremble with the weight of it all In the kitchen, Sam pulls the phone off of the receiver on the wall and hands it to Dean. His hand trembles as he accepts it, feeling the world spin around him in a flurry of motion and unbearable pain. His fingers shake as he dials 9-1-1. And when the operator answers, Dean’s voice feels very small and far away.
As a heads up, this fic will very likely have more than 10 chapters. I have many of them written out already, but I'm using 10 as a guide marker for now. Thank you for reading!
Before Castiel can ask what he means, the warehouse begins to tremor. It’s soft at first, so gentle Castiel could barely feel it at all. But soon, the shaking grows in volume, and Castiel nearly tumbles to the ground as the very floor beneath them begins to
When Castiel returns, he collapses onto the chair and tells Balthazar everything. Balthazar needs at least two shots of whiskey to get through Castiel’s explanation, his eyes blowing wide at the mention of the Devil and the broken Seal. When Castiel finally finishes, Balthazar leans his elbows on his legs, watching Castiel with heavy eyes and a quiet shake of his head.
Jo visits them sometimes, but she comes alone. Up in heaven, chaos is still erupting as the angel infighting reaches its peak. She’s chosen to take up leadership, guiding a faction of angels refusing to be bent by heaven’s demands. She guides them on the principles of love, free will, and inner strength. It grows bigger by the day, and as it does, the fighting seems to calm.
“No. I know I’m not,” Dean says quickly. He points a finger at Castiel. “Man of the Lord. Castiel Emmanuel Novak. Memorized the whole damn Bible by the time you were five. But...never truly felt God’s presence. You searched for it. You looked, and you looked...but you just...couldn’t...find him. Now, you aren’t all wrong - my Father has been gone...for quite a while. But that made you ask questions. Didn’t it? The wrong kinds of questions.”
Castiel breathes heavily as his older self releases him, turning away to lean his hands down against the table.
His stomach rolls as he shoves the image aside, trying to ground himself in the work of the present. Castiel lowers a steady hand to close her eyes, fighting the urge to clear the matted blood from her dark hair. Behind him, Balthazar scours for EMF, hearing the machine whirr and whine before fading into a soft treble of noise.
“Most food just tastes like molecules to me,” Dean points out conversationally. “But that Eat ‘N Go is
Nobody followed him - leaving his heaven must have taken him off the radar. Relieved, Castiel peers around his surroundings, realizing that he’s ended up on a small beach with a large, rocky cliff at his back. He’s never been to the beach before - he’d only ever seen it on TV before his father banned television from the house for good. The smell of the salt and the sand is oddly peaceful as he steps forward, away from the cliff, and towards a figure of a man sitting by the shore only several yards away.
Without another word, Dean strides out the door and out of the house, yelling to his dad that he was going next door.
Balthazar shakes his head. “Nope. I slept like a baby. What about you? You looked trashed. I’m a little pissed that your angel boy let you drive home like that. ‘Specially alone.”
Blood-red. Artery-purple. Pus-yellow. Chains, and screams, and fire like little else. In the deep, a knife plunged into the skin is relief from the fire; the fire, a relief from the waiting of it all. Waiting to burn. Waiting to be carved. That’s the true hell; waiting. Knowing. Knowing you will be in pain, and knowing you will always wait for more pain.
With a roll of his eyes, Dean leans back against the table. “Not how angels work, buddy. We aren’t demons. This guy? He prayed for it. Devout ‘till the end. He had faith.”
The pressures and whims of heaven will no longer be her own. All at the price of every angel in heaven hating her guts and wanting to throw her into a torture cell the minute they get their hands on her. Those premonitions she was having about the apocalypse were her gaining her memories back. Angel radio on high. She’s lived as a human for so long, was reborn as an infant...and now it’s all coming back to bite her in the ass.”
Swallowing thickly, Castiel pages through the notebook. Rough, rigid sketches in black and blue pencil scour across the pages, each more terrifying than the next. One depicts a startlingly familiar scene: Samhain rising from the cracks of the warehouse as a figure -
Dean spends the rest of the week in the garage after school when he can bring himself to go. Sam spends time with his friends and spends less and less time at the house. The fighting between him and their father had grown into an ugly crescendo and it bleeds into every corner of their lives. John is irritable and short with Dean at work. Sam is quiet and moody, not wanting to talk or even listen to music when they’re alone. Most days, Dean tries to break it up when it gets too loud. But more and more lately, Dean merely goes upstairs and slams his bedroom door behind him, unable to take it. He intervenes when he thinks Sam is in danger, but that’s it. He doesn’t have the energy for anything else.
who let his brother downtime and time again. Fleeing a broken home just to throw Lucifer into the arms of some drunk who can barely see straight on a good day. You know you deserved to be down there, Castiel. You’ve always been bright enough to see yourself for who you truly are: someone who’s better off buried six feet under and left to
Dean shivers where he sits. He knows that she’s right. He had seen it today, and he’d seen it before. Maybe that’s why Castiel was so angry with him for putting himself in harm’s way to stick up for Benny. Pleased with her handiwork, Jodi leans back to look at him.
“Someone has to be. You both have been through a lot. It’s the least I can do. As long as you can show me it wasn’t for nothing.”
Since I'm very, very nearly done with editing and revising this entire fic, I decided to post this chapter early. Yay! Thank you to everyone who's been following along so far - I've had so much fun writing this and I can't believe it's nearly over. As always, I will continue to update on Tuesdays.
But Dean doesn’t answer. He’s gone. And Castiel finds the room around him shifting and whirling into a blur of color. Noami’s face swims into his vision, blurring along the lines until her face is no longer hers, but Jo’s. He watches her, harsh blinks of color bursting before his eyes. He’s nowhere - as though in a dream, he’s swimming between short clips of memory, pleasant and horrifying alike. He sees his father, and Castiel is screaming for him not to perform the exorcism on his brother. He sees the smoke. He sees Lucifer’s eyes, cast up towards the plume of black as the house rips into flames. He sees himself grab his brother and push through the burning house until they’re free and on the road.
Shaking off the thought, Castiel climbs out of the water, looking at them both sadly as they continue to laugh. Smiling, his mother walks over to him and takes his face between her gentle hands.
Castiel huffs a weak laugh. “You’re right,” he says. “You shouldn’t have to be strong enough for both of us, Jo.”
But the church appears empty. Being in here, Castiel realizes, feels wrong. He feels as though he shouldn’t be here - like he’s not clean enough to be here. It unsettles him, weighing heavily on his skin as he slowly looks around the empty room.
Dean looks down at the floor. “Dad, I...you told me you could afford to hire someone else. I work almost for free, I have a little bit of money and I wanted to take Sam - “
“Ssshhhh.” Lucifer presses a finger to his lips, silencing Castiel at once. Startled, Castiel lowers his gun. The two brothers stare at one another wordlessly for a long moment before Lucifer leans down and grabs the woman by the throat as effortlessly as if she were nothing but a doll. Stunned by the display of inhuman strength, Castiel watches as he shoves her against the wall and draws a knife from his belt. With a quick flick of his wrist, he slashes her throat as easily as one would cut through butter. Blood spurts from her neck, ushering a weak, strangled scream from the witch. It drenches Lucifer’s clothes in an acrid splash of red, but he pays it no mind.
Transfixed by the newcomers, Castiel tries to gather as much information as he can about his new neighbors. The boys seem to get along well. Their father seems strict, quick to bark out orders. The boys listen, rushing quickly to follow his sharp orders. Castiel watches, silent and observing, from his place atop the low-hanging tree.
he thinks to himself, sending out a desperate, silent prayer as the sun begins dipping low behind the trees.
“Grace from an angel is life. If I bury this vial here, it might make the soil less rocky and gross. And in the springtime, flowers will grow. My brother...he always liked the gardens humans would grow over time. I never really understood it. But he liked flowers. I figured, um, if we’re building a little memorial here...maybe I could make one for Sammy?”
Castiel’s face flushes. He seems unable to accept the compliment as though makes him uncomfortable. His eyes cast down to the dirty carpet. But even over his blush, he’s smiling.
“Next time you watch James and me have sex, you’re welcome to join in,” he grunts. Castiel can’t tell if he’s being serious or not. “He’d like that, I’m sure. I dare even say he’s begun to like me.”
Dean sighs, trailing off with a shake of his head. “She was like a little sister to me. And if she dies on my watch...I can’t...I can’t do that. I can’t watch that happen to someone I love again.”
Dean presses him to elaborate, but Castiel claims he doesn’t know what else the job will entail yet. Still, Dean is relieved it isn’t because of his strange disappearance over the weekend. Or because of any bruises or...something else. The haunted eyes of Castiel’s younger brother still trickle through Dean’s memory no matter how often he tries to shove it away. He still hasn’t told Castiel about it yet. It feels like a quiet secret, fragile enough to vanish in the wind should he speak it aloud.
A deep, instinctual urge prompts Dean to defend his father as he worries his bottom lip between his teeth. The urge to scold Sam for thinking such a thing, to brush him off and call him crazy. But something else, something heavy, nags at Dean until he can’t ignore it anymore.
Benny huffs a laugh. “I’m not the one with a bleeding face, Dean,” he points out. “I’ll be fine. You saved my skin back there. You too, Castiel. I owe you one, brother.”
He holds out his hand. With wide, disbelieving eyes, Dean takes it. Before them, the water is swelling, rising into a massive, black tidal wave that would quickly and easily consume them both. It rises and crests and Castiel can smell the brine as it rises to swallow them both.
“My father hit me. Gabriel saw it happen and ran between us. My father shoved him aside and pushed him down the stairs. He died of head trauma, but he was unconscious the entire time. He didn’t feel any pain.”
A kid that had to grow up too soon. A kid who was also being hurt by an adult in their lives, and who Dean still failed to protect.
Dean chuckles. The laugh reverberates across the barn walls until it reaches a thunderous crescendo. Castiel flinches as lightning flashes through the barn, causing him to stare back at Dean with wide, wild eyes.
When Castiel finally reaches Balthazar’s house, he finds that the door is unlocked. He calls out his name, again and again with no response. Shattered glass litters the floor, and several pieces of furniture are lay overturned and shoved hastily out of place. Castiel runs his fingers across the coffee table, now laying on its side. A thick trail of dust clings to the pads of his fingers; the house had been abandoned for some time.
“Nope. Just me.” Dean inspects his nails, refusing to elaborate further. Castiel opens his mouth to ask
“I don’t know if we will,” Dean murmurs, feeling dazed. “But I’m not gonna give up on him, Benny. I can’t.”
A chill passes down Dean’s spine. It had been almost a month since the night Dean had followed Castiel to the bar — his new job. Dean had kept his knowledge of it a secret from Castiel and anybody else. On the days at school that followed Castiel’s night shifts, Castiel was always exhausted during school, hardly able to pay attention in class from fighting off sleep. Dean would ask about him, casually, of course - but Castiel would always insist that he was okay. Soon, Dean stopped asking. And Castiel never brought it up, until now.
That seems good enough for the camp - though nobody seems to be questioning the presence of the body on the ground. The older Castiel storms over to where Castiel is standing, grabbing him harshly by the coat and dragging him back inside the camp as the others move to collect the body. He slams the door shut and shoves Castiel up against the door with a harsh
“It’s, uh, it’s okay,” Castiel says, feeling awkward. The car feels too hot - even the windows are half-fogged. They stare at one another for an agonizingly long second before Dean’s face shifts. He surges upright, reaching up his hand and snapping his fingers. All at once, he’s put back together - his hair is fixed, his clothes aligned. Even the semen on Castiel’s hand is gone.
with this other man. He knows himself well enough to spot those little movements - the way Castiel shrugs his shoulders, tilts his head one too many times while he talks, the way he’s surely cracking some stupid joke he’d be hellishly embarrassed about later.
When Castiel looks up at Balthazar again, his face is completely pale. He’s silent for a long, long moment as Castiel swallows the rest of his drink in two heavy gulps.
“Man, I felt kinda bad dragging you in there. You sure you’re alright? I’m sorry if I, uh, made you uncomfortable or anything.”
When their father isn’t home, the Winchester brothers pack as much as they can fit into the trunk. Dean tells Sam he needs to make a stop before they leave for good. He pulls the car up in front of Benny’s house and quickly climbs out, hurrying up to the front porch to ring the doorbell with an antsy jitter in his fingers. They hadn’t spent any time together outside of school since the day Dean’s father caught them on the bed, and until now, Dean had mostly been avoiding Benny whenever he got the chance.
He jerks Sam back, causing him to stumble against the wall before releasing his shirt. Without another word, John stalks out of the kitchen and up into his bedroom. Sparing one, wild look in his brother’s direction, Sam lets out a tortured groan before running upstairs to their room. Feeling dazed, Dean’s heart races in his chest as he lingers in the kitchen, feeling too numb to move right away. With a heavy heart and an ache in his ribs where John had shoved him into the table, he follows Sam upstairs.
Wait. I’m rambling on and on about girls. You’re... gay, aren’t you? That whole thing that Naomi was…
Castiel nearly jumps out of his seat when Dean sits back down, sliding the glass of whiskey across the table. Castiel takes it and finishes it in several, quick gulps, breathing a heavy sigh when he places the glass back down.
Finding the camp isn’t hard. On the outside of the city, Castiel finds the gates with CAMP CHITAQUA plastered across the wooden sign hanging near the gated entrance. He parks a distance away from the camp, climbing out of his car with his gun in his hand as he inspects the border, trying his best to remain hidden from the guards. He doesn’t recognize the faces of the guards from a distance, and, not knowing the rules of this broken world, fears getting too close.
Her eyes shine. Tortured laughter falls past her lips. He can’t tell if she’s breaking or simply enjoying this. But if that’s true, then —
Castiel grabs the iron pan hanging above the sink and swings it at her, sending her vanishing in a puff of smoke.
“God...Castiel was tearing up the whole house looking for that old thing. Guess he’ll be happy you found it. What’s your name?”
Castiel pays for his drink in cash, tipping the waiter more than he intended to, but hardly caring enough to count out the bills. He swallows the shot quickly, grateful when it burns down his throat. He quickly finishes his water after, grateful when it seems to calm the slight tremble in his hand. He orders another and the bartender gives him a wary nod before sliding him another glass.
Castiel mumbles something about being tired when they walk home from school that day. With Sam at one of his after-school clubs, the two walk back alone. Dean grunts a quick hello to his father as the two of them climb the stairs. He’s aware of his father’s eyes watching them before Dean shuts the bedroom door behind them.
It’s not the summertime - not yet - but the icy mornings that make room for warmer, milder days are ones Dean can accept with grace.
Balthazar doesn’t believe him. Not at first. Not that he should. Balthazar launches himself at Castiel, swinging the silver blade down towards his shoulder which Castiel narrowly deflects.
I may give this piece an epilogue, and I might not - I'm not sure yet. But I can promise I'll be writing more Destiel in the months to come.
Castiel presses his lips together in a hard line. His movements stiff and robotic, he huffs a short sigh.
And just like that, the room is still. Castiel gasps for breath, clutching at his throat as he staggers to his feet. Benny is gone and so is the woman. Castiel hastily looks around the room as Balthazar heaves for breath against the wall, clutching the armrest of the ratty recliner. The room is in ruin - books strewn across the floor, lightbulbs shattered. The drywall is cracked from where Balthazar had been thrown against it. Castiel turns and catches Dean’s eye, and Dean tells him that it’s done. The spell had worked.
He shakes his head. Dimly, he hears the sound of wings flapping, then Dean grunting out a hoarse cry of Jo’s name. Castiel turns his head. Bloody and unsteady on her feet, Jo looks at them both with wide, unblinking eyes. Dean pulls her into a tight hug, which she weakly returns.
isn’t lost on him. All at once, he’s reminded that this angel - named Dean, no less - isn’t like the angels he’d imagined.
Dean misses the summertime. He misses the endless crawl of the afternoon sun creeping over the sleepy town, the way that the dewy morning grass would dry in the sun, perfect for slumping across the lawn and feeling the sunshine on his face. Days that would blink on by like fireflies, days that were endless as the bubbling pond curving ‘round the woods that lined the endless midwestern roads. Dean even misses the way the flora would push through the dirt, stretching their open petals to the sun. Everything feels alive during the summer, and even the family’s worst days on the road could brighten themselves just with the warmth Dean would feel on his face, gazing out the open window of his father’s ‘67 Chevy, aching for the days he and Sam could take a walk down to the ice cream shop if they had the means to drum up some spare change.
Robert huffs, clearly amused. Castiel wants to punch him - but he knows how useless that would be. He doubts Robert would even feel it.
Their daily routines don’t change much. However, as time passes, Castiel decides to hunt more. He doesn't do it as often as he used to, and he doesn’t travel far. He keeps the hunts local to the state and even begins to show Dean a couple of techniques.
Castiel shakes his head. “I don’t understand why. Why would he do this? I know my brother...I’ve known him my entire life. He isn’t an evil man, Dean. I haven’t spoken to him in...at least a year. I...you may not understand this, but he’s my brother. I can’t allow myself to believe that he is...evil.”
Dean sighs, rolling his eyes as he opens a can of Coke. He hands one to Castiel as he flops down on his bed.
He winces in pain as Jodi soaks the other side of the cloth in peroxide and begins to clean his wound. There’s a tense silence as Castiel glares at the two of them.
“And how am I supposed to trust you?” Castiel whispers fiercely. He slams a hand down on the bar, baring his teeth to Dean as though he’d be any
“Yeah,” Dean agrees warily. “They are. His brother is...I dunno.” Jodi shakes her head, her expression quickly darkening again.
“Lucifer is alive,” Dean says slowly. Castiel whips his head around, baring his teeth at the angel in a white-hot fury. He clamors out of bed, stalking over to him before swinging his fist back and punching Dean square in the jaw.
Castiel doesn’t dream clearly. In his loss of consciousness, he swims between strange, blurry colors and bursts of noise that make little sense even to him. He thinks he sees Lucifer’s face mingled with Dean’s. It isn’t until some time passes, the colors fading and blurring and swirling together. He hears a scream, one he’d never forget - the scream of one of his father’s wives dying as Lucifer drove the blade of a knife straight through her stomach, killing both her and her unborn child. But then the dream ends, like it’s being shoved back by hands Castiel can’t see.
Dean rubs the back of his head. “Hey, yeah, sure,” Dean says. “I’m almost done - you guys mind waiting around a minute?”
But Castiel is already slamming the bedroom door behind him. Dazed, Dean wanders to his bedroom window and watches Castiel stalk across the yard before disappearing inside his own home. His abrupt departure from the house leaves a cold pit in Dean's stomach. Sneaking out at night for some weird job, freaking out over not being able to go home on time…
,” the other says quietly. “I’m not the one who laid down the towel and tried to make the end of the world somebody else’s problem. This is where that got you, Castiel. The world is ugly...
“And I’m sorry for it.” Dean stands up, walking over to the side of his bed again. Castiel kneels upright to face him. “It is not how I want any of this to be. I will do what’s in my power to leave you out of this, but I don’t think either of us has a choice.”
“Hey,” Dean says quietly. “It’s alright. It’s gonna sound...good, Cas’. Just pretend that I’m not here.”
Flanking the man, Balthazar raises his crowbar in a quick flash of movement. Without turning around, the man catches it just as the metal is about to connect with his head. He rips it easily from Balthazar’s hand and whirls around to face him. The man raises two fingers and places them onto Balthazar’s forehead. In seconds, Balthazar’s eyes roll back into his head as the man -- the creature --  gently lowers him to the ground.
Castiel doesn’t ask him what he means. And he doesn’t think he wants to find out. Without another word, he pulls the thin blankets up over himself and kicks off his shoes as the other settles on the couch across the room. Hours later, just when he’s sure he can hear the birds chattering amidst the trees, he falls into a fitful sleep.
"I'm sleepy," he mumbles. As if to emphasize his point, he flaps the blanket behind him, ushering a soft chuckle from his older brother.
“Nope, nope, I got it.” He pulls back, shifting to kneel between Castiel’s legs. His eyes, transfixed on Castiel’s body, trail down from his lips, down the line of his throat, and finally down to his groin. For a moment, Dean seems to forget what he’d been doing. He stares down at Castiel’s body laid out on the bed, eyes hooded and wandering up and down the length of him.
He shoves past Castiel without another word, collapsing onto the ground beside the lifeless body with shaking hands. He cups the older Castiel’s face, shaking his head as he whimpers soft, weak noises of disbelief, blind to the fact that the Devil is sitting beside him.
Castiel clamps his mouth shut. Dazed, Dean blinks, trying to understand what Castiel is trying to say. He doesn’t understand him any more than he understood him the first day that he met him. Any more than he understands Castiel disappearing at night to work a strange job at a dive bar downtown.
He motions for Dean to follow him inside the house, and Dean quickly hurries after him. Much like his own, the house is quaint. Comfortable, yet small. Vaguely suffocating. Dean eyes the walls as Michael leads him through the kitchen and into the living room where several, ratty blue couches surround an antennae TV. Several spots on the walls have been filled in with drywall that was still unpainted, and the couch cushions are ripped in several places. The corner of the television is cracked.
“There is a significant amount of demon and Croatoan activity in the house on top of the hill,” the older Castiel says, addressing the group as a whole. “We need to take the path around the hill and up to the side of the house - that’s where the blindspots from the house are, even with the damage done by the fire. They won’t see you coming. Me and him - “ His older self points to Castiel beside him. “- are going to come up from the other side. We need heavy fire and strategic charge plants in the basement of the house. That should take out the mass of defenses the Devil has set in store and give us enough time to take him out.”
Sam looks up from his homework unexpectedly. With a blink of surprise, his face splits into a wide grin. Forgetting his work, Sam shoves his notebook aside on his bed.
Two figures remain in the middle of the empty barn, just below the hayloft. On the ground is his older self, choking on his blood as his body clings to the last, fading strands of life. A large, blotchy spot of red spreads across his stomach. Kneeling beside him is Lucifer, stricken to the bone with a sadness Castiel has never seen in his eyes before.
Castiel gives him a lingering look. He opens his mouth as though to say something else, but he doesn’t finish his sentence. He turns, and both he and Dean see the harrowing sight at the same time; Gabriel, wandering into the street to chase dandelion seeds dancing in the wind just as a car rounds the corner, driving too fast for the quiet street.
Benny. Benny Lafitte, the man he met on a hunt, the man who’d been reduced to nothing but a pile of ripped limbs, drained entirely of blood.
But, as Dean follows Michael through the house, the sound of an out-of-tune piano floats through the house from upstairs, instantly capturing Dean’s attention. Dean listens intently, recognizing the song; an Elvis song from one of his records. The smooth, steady melody drifts through the living room, played with the pace and rhythm of a seasoned musician. Despite the instrument being so old and out of tune, the notes are played with careful precision, delicately flowing from one chord into the next. It's as though the instrument's lack of tune is part of the song itself; the lack of sharp tonality giving the song a haunted, unearthly sort of beauty that stuns Dean where he stands. The song is undeniably an Elvis song, and yet entirely unique in the way the piano’s melody ebbs and flows. Dean can hear the words sung as though the King himself were upstairs, singing right along. He doesn't even realize that he's smiling as he begins humming under his breath.
Dean swallows thickly. “You didn’t go to hell for the reasons you think that you did,” he murmurs. Castiel stares at him, his eyes fixed on the other’s still form. He feels terribly vulnerable and small, as though Dean were staring straight into his very soul. Perhaps he is.
“I think that you...that you have good intentions. And I think somewhere along the way, those intentions broke. I think that somewhere along the line, you had rules. And those rules were bad. And now you don’t want to live by them anymore, and you don’t have the strength to fully break free.”
That smirk again -- the knowing, faint smile stretched across his face that freezes Castiel in place.
- hold, his other self brings the butt of the gun across his temple, sending him into a quick flurry of unconsciousness.
“I’m going to give you part of my grace. A very, very small part - small enough that it should hardly have any effect on you. It should allow you to sense where he is, even in heaven. Be careful with it, okay?”
“Have you heard anything from Lucifer?” Castiel asks, already knowing the answer. But he’s desperate to change the subject. Balthazar shakes his head.
Her voice cuts off. There’s a terrible beat of silence (waiting, always waiting) and then, Pamela screams. Castiel and Balthazar stumble out of their chairs in shock, gaping at Pamela as she throws her head back in an agonized howl. Terrible fire erupts from her eyes, scorching her face from within. She wails in agony as the fire burns brighter and brighter, and soon, she collapses onto the floor. Castiel rushes to her side in horror as two wide, black holes gape up at him from where her eyes used to be. The skin is scorched and burned.
Castiel feels his veins run cold at the ugly memory. “Yes,” he admits. “And he wasn’t the first. But Benny died because I got too close to him. I...it hasn’t exactly done anything for my conscience.”
Castiel understands pain. He understands waiting. He understands its burning, hellish purpose. He understands what it is to be twisted and prodded and eaten and scorched.
Castiel nods, but his gaze is fixated on the necklace in his palms. He cradles it in his hands like it’s a piece of valuable treasure, a diamond lost to his touch. It glimmers in the sunlight peeking through the airy clouds. Since they had stepped outside, Castiel hadn’t stopped looking at it. His black hair, almost too long, falls over his forehead and Castiel absently reaches up to brush is aside.
“Explain it to me,” Castiel demands quickly when Dean remains silent. “What is a Witness? Why did I see the ghost of-of, Benny Lafitte?”
“Nothing you would care to know,” he says under his breath. He brushes his fingers over the instruments on the table, settling for the medium-sized knife. He grips it tightly, watching his reflection glint across the blade. The flash of his own, pale face inside the metal sends a jolt down his spine. He forces himself to look, to keep eye contact with himself for a long, agonizing moment as he presses his lips tightly together.
But Dean doesn’t do any of that. He just watches Castiel disappear into the night and thinks about how lost he would be if Castiel wasn’t his friend.
Dean shakes his head. “Because it’s your destiny,” he says simply. “And heaven wants you to fulfill it.”
“I’m an angel. Angel of the Lord. Though...I wouldn’t go basing your perception of me on what you've read. Since you do read the Bible, don’t you?”
Castiel presses his lips together in a tight line before he answers. “I met him on a hunt. Vampires were chasing me, and I had a chance to get the jump on them. I had stopped at a bar after driving for hours and he asked me where I’d come from. We got talking…”
, don't you? And this man — " Naomi reaches down and grabs Castiel by the jaw, forcing him to look at her. " — this man is important to you, isn't he? More important than
Peering out the front door, he keeps a distance from the small crowd pulling open the gates as a large HMMWV comes to a stop. He spots the man the older Castiel had slept with the night before - James - following Castiel out of the vehicle, his hand twitching noticeably at his side. Without warning, the other Castiel raises his gun at his side and shoots James through the head, dropping him instantly in front of the rest of the camp.
The garage is relatively small, but organized to a fault; it has space for two cars on-deck, waiting to be repaired or inspected, with one on the worker’s line. John’s tools remain in a neat array on the wall, with smaller parts placed neatly in the black, industrial toolboxes stored near the back or in his office. Order forms for spare parts remain tucked neatly in the filing cabinet. The whole space smells like oil and metal, a smell Dean had grown quickly used to.
It’s something Dean would laugh at if it were anybody else doing it. But watching Castiel make music out of nothing but air transfixes him. He almost forgets to walk quietly as he sets his gaze on Castiel’s invisible performance. Dean can hear the soft, quiet noises of the night; the chirp of the crickets. An owl overhead. The occasional car in the distance. But here, now, Dean is sure he can hear the vivid color of music Castiel is painting in his mind.
Stunned, Dean watches as Castiel carefully opens his window from across the yard and begins slowly climbing down onto the slanted roof. In the dark, his figure is hard to make out — but the scrawny boy cloaked in a tan trenchcoat is impossible to miss, even from a distance. His movements are slow, almost graceful — like he’s done this before, knowing where to carefully place each foot and each steady hand. Carefully, he shifts down near the edge of the roof and begins lowering himself down, inch by inch.
He grabs it from Michael, who gives him a hard shove. With the older brother being much bigger — and stronger — Castiel stumbles back, tripping over the bottom step and landing on the second step hard on his rear end.
“Then why me?” Castiel demands. “I was in hell for a reason, wasn’t I? I told Balthazar that I didn’t know what sent me down there, but I-I think that I do. I didn’t make any deal. But I was supposed to be there. I knew that I would --”
Dean nods, letting Castiel put it on. He’s glad he at least got Castiel talking again, even if his approach to women, much like his approach to
. What exactly do you think you can threaten me with? My life? My sanity? Another eternity in hell? What could you
Sam looks crestfallen. Suddenly, he doesn’t seem so grown-up anymore. Because he’s not, Dean knows. He’s a kid. A kid Dean has to look after, too.
“Yeah, you told me,” Castiel growls under his breath. His heart hammers in his chest as he tries to sound braver than he feels. “And yet you failed to specify what kind of
Dean doesn't say anything at all. A hard lump forms in his throat as he sits beside Sam on his bed, putting an arm around his brother's shoulders. Sam cries into Dean's shoulders with quiet, hitching sobs. All Dean can do is give Sam a shoulder for him to cry on; a rock in his brother's endless, stormy sea. Dean's ribs ache from when he'd been shoved against the wooden table, and his body feels unsteady as the moving tide. He feels weak. Like he can’t possibly bear the burden of both of their fear. Dean's fear of disobedience. Sam's fear of his own, desperate ache to live a life of his own. It’s only then that Dean sees the bruise on Sam’s chin. Their father had hit him before Dean had a chance to stop it before he had come home.
do to me that hasn’t been done to me yet? My family is dead. My brother is too far gone for me to reach anymore. My soul is some dirty, corrupted thing even you wouldn’t dare touch. Balthazar — oh, he’s good to me, but he’s usually too drunk out of his mind to even know what’s six feet in front of him. I have nothing, Dean. So what
“So what, I’m supposed to just let him treat me like crap?” Sam demands. “That’s stupid, Dean, and you know it.”
“Then I don’t know what to tell you!” Dean snaps. “I can’t make dad stop yelling, okay? But maybe if you just shut up and did what he asked you to do, things would be easier around here.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel huffs, still laughing under his breath. He hastily pulls his hand away, feeling ridiculous. “I think I drank too much. This is all...new to me.”
“No, it’s not that...it’s just that you and I barely know each other. I mean, hell, I totally loved talking to you about music and stuff. But I was just...surprised. That you said it that way.”
That draws a chuckle from the other boys. Briefly, Dean catches Benny’s grateful eyes before Dick grabs Dean by the front of the shirt and jerks him closer. Dean glares at him,
a supernatural being or event take place. They’re meant to be projections of the living’s guilt, usually. But they can kill. Real nasty things. Been ganking hunters all up this side of town.”
Castiel draws in a slow breath. Before him, a girl only a few years younger than him stands before the stained glass window. Rays of sunlight trickle in through the colors of the glass, making her long ringlets of blonde hair glimmer where she stands. Small, wiry, and surprisingly calm in Castiel’s presence, she watches him with wide, curious eyes.
Castiel nods in agreement. He isn’t looking at Dean, not now; he’s pushing himself upright into a sitting position to watch his brother gather flowers out on the lawn. Dean follows his gaze “He is. He has a lot of life in him...I hope he learns to play the piano one day. On a piano that’s in-tune...one that he can learn on properly.”
Dean bites his lower lip. He catches the way Sam’s expression falls when he doesn’t answer right away. It’s enough to make his heart sink in his chest.
“My name is Michael,” he says lowly. He storms over to Castiel, striking him hard across the face. The blow is strong enough to knock Castiel down to his knees. “And you are
“Hey —” Castiel begins, wanting to demand answers to the inventory issue, but the other waves him off.
Naomi laughs again, her chest heaving as she curls her limbs against the onslaught of holy water coursing through her body. “You know, there’s an irony, here. You being in hell did mean something, you know that?
Without a word, he stands up stiffly and marches out the door. It slams behind him, leaving Jodi shaking her head.
“You’ll be paid $10 a night plus the tips the older men will give to you to request music. The house will take 10% of your tips. You are to put a portion of your money in the box before you leave each night. Do you understand?”
“Thanks, Cas,” he says quietly. Castiel scoots back, pressing his back against Dean’s chest in a soft acceptance of Dean’s warmth.
Her words cut off with a thick, wordless gurgle as he jams the needle up through her jugular and presses the syringe. She lets out a thick, growling scream, thrashing against her bonds as the holy water seeps through her veins. Steam rises from the wound as Castiel watches her struggle uselessly against the chains binding her to the gate. He almost smiles.
Somehow, Dean suspects Castiel wouldn’t be at school the next day after his late return home the night before. He doesn’t want to think about how he knows. But he knows. He doesn’t even bother to wait for him outside his house, much to Sam’s protest. The bruises, the way Castiel seems so
Unshaved, scruffy, and heavy-eyed. But undoubtedly him. Too stunned to break away from the man’s - from
“Because — I don’t know. Haven’t I done enough wrong? I’ve tried to have faith and it didn’t work. I’ve...I almost gave up on everything I’ve ever been meant to do. I’ve been given orders by angels and disobeyed them.” His head is racing. He doesn’t want to talk about this - not now. With a sigh, Jo looks around, her brow furrowed in thought.
“My father was religious, as you know. To this day, I still don’t fully understand what branch or sect of Christianity he chose to follow. Only that, over time, he grew more and more convinced that he was a messiah and that God was speaking to him in languages that only he understood. I often wonder if he suffered from some kind of psychosis, or if he was simply a man delusional enough to believe in his inflated sense of self-importance fueled by the Bible and its messages. But you know that, already. You were the last, normal friend I ever had before my father cut Lucifer and me off from the rest of the world.
I can put on a good show up in heaven, but I’m not like them. Not anymore. And they’re starting to catch on.”
“Maybe it’s lying,” Castiel says softly. “It showed me its wings...but...surely angels aren’t the only creatures that have them.”
“I just worry about you, y’know? Ever since your mom died and we lost our old house, things have been hard. For you, for Sammy, for me...I just don’t want to see you get hurt, Dean. Not like this. That’s all. You can find better friends than that kid. Just ‘cause he’s next door don’t mean you need to hang around him all the time.”
“Yes,” he agrees, a bit reluctantly. “Perhaps, if Dean joins us, you can show him your favorite kind.”
In the kitchen, Gabriel is quick to show Dean the small pieces of chocolate aptly tucked away in the small cabinet above the gas stove. Castiel allows him one before sending Gabriel off to play with his toys in the living room. Dean is impressed with how willing Gabriel is to entertain himself - and with how clean he looks when he’s with Castiel. The grubby boy with the dirty shirt and wild hair Dean had seen before is nearly unrecognizable. Wordlessly, Castiel touches Dean’s arm and motions for him to follow him up the flight of steps and onto the top floor. The wooden stairs creak with their age, and the quaint, yet bland hallway at the foot of the stairs boasts two, dusty photographs; one of a woman, presumably Castiel’s mother, and another of all the Novak family sitting together on the sofa. Dean eyes the man with the scruffy beard - Castiel’s father, another member of the family Dean has never seen in person. Pushing open a chipped, white door with a wide crack down the middle, Castiel leads Dean into a bedroom with a large, black piano in the corner that takes up almost half the room.
“Not only that, but we can ward the doors if we’re careful. No one’s gonna know, at least for tonight. Should shake ‘em off my tail until I can come up with a good cover why I’ve been tuned out of angel radio for the past few days.”
Castiel laughs bitterly. “You’re apologizing for the wrong things, Dean,” he says. They meet eyes again, and this time, Castiel doesn’t back down. He stares straight through him, letting Dean know just how serious he actually is.
“Yes, I understand.” Castiel is breathless, enamored. Dean can practically see the light in his eyes. He feels uneasy, listening to the conversation - playing for strange, old men late at night? It doesn’t sit right with Dean. At all.
He tells this to Dean often because Dean needs to know. He needs to know that he’s more than a warm body, more than a pretty face or a gentle laugh. Dean was an angel who pulled him from hell - and now, he’s a human who pulled him out of a much, much more personal hell. They grieve their losses together and find time to smile. And Castile is endlessly grateful for it.
. They lie and they twist and they take what isn’t meant to be theirs. He turns away from her, stumbling out of the trap to brace his hands down on the rickety table. The oxygen in the room feels thinner, lighter, and Castiel can’t seem to take it all in.
Dean bites his lower lip, his amusement falling. “I see. I’m sorry about that, buddy.” He pushes his drink into Castiel’s hand. Castiel shivers when their fingers brush together for just a moment, feeling like touching an angel without permission is surely some terrible crime. Or a beautiful one. “Just drink it,” Dean grunts when he notices Castiel’s hesitation to accept the glass. “Think you need it more than me.”
Dean sucks in a sharp breath. He feels his stomach tighten at the name of his friend. Three months Castiel’s been gone. Two weeks since the police stopped looking, saying that if he wants to come home, he will. Three months of Dean crying himself to sleep almost every night.
“Yeah, I remember,” Balthazar croaks, his voice dry and raspy. He pours himself another glass of whiskey. “Blimey, Cas...you...I didn’t know it was that bad.”
Castiel bares his teeth. Pure, white hatred bubbles in his stomach as Naomi chokes out a laugh. He doesn’t want to
Castiel looks between the two of them in disbelief. He knows that he would sooner die than watch a town of innocent people be eradicated like insects when he’s able to do something about it. Perhaps that’s all that humans are to these angels - insects. The realization dawns heavily over Castiel as he tries to speak again. He catches Dean’s eye, but the angel’s expression is blank and nearly unreadable. He watches as Robert strides over to Castiel, giving him a narrow glare as his thick hand twitches at his side. Inches from his face, Castiel can smell the sweat coming off of his vessel. He doesn’t move.
Jo tilts her head. Her curious expression trails across his face - hauntingly similar to the way Dean looks at him, sometimes. The look of an angel trying to understand the thoughts of a human mind. “Why would you go back to hell?” she asks softly.
Sprinting across the grass, he leaps over the fence, the sight of the old, brown barn filling him with dread as he hurries across the unkempt pasture and through the open doors.
He’s always found Dean to be most beautiful just like this — dressed down with dirt smeared across his face. It’s rivaled only to seeing Dean entirely naked — something Castiel has seen plenty of times when Dean comes out of the shower.
him, to use him to be something monstrous. He doesn’t want his father to be in heaven or hell or any place in between. He wants his father to have never been born.
He cuts off, his sheer disbelief preventing him from saying anything more. Behind him, Balthazar is trying not to laugh. Castiel turns to glare at him, effectively shutting him up.
he wants this as much as he knows that he trusts Dean. But even still, the urge to shy away from what he desires is strong. It’s deep-seated and it’s ugly, and Castiel is sick of running from it. He’s sick of running from
for him…? Castiel thinks of the night before with a rush of guilt. Surely Dean doesn’t understand what he’s saying. Angels don’t
“Well all that school shit isn’t gonna matter if we don’t have a roof over our heads, is it?!” John demands.
, my beta, my biggest cheerleader, and a wonderful friend. This fic would not be possible without you and your time and effort is something I can't thank you for enough.
Leaning back against the pillows, Castiel watches Dean carefully. His head is spinning, although he no longer feels any pressing pain. He’d learned too much today - more than he ever thought he wanted to know. Everything - his brother’s betrayal, the torture, Naomi, the angels - feels like
“So what if we do leave?” Dean asks. He fights against the tremble in his voice, relieved when his voice sounds strong and confident and not nearly as terrified as he feels. Dean draws in a slow breath, daring his father to turn back around to face him again.
nailed down exactly how many chapters will be in this fic. 13 is the final number, and that shouldn't need to change at all.
A month after Lucifer and Samuel chose to leave the world behind, Castiel makes a makeshift tombstone for Lucifer and Balthazar in the backyard. Neither of them had left Castiel with a body to bury. As Dean ponders over the broken garbage disposal inside, Castiel digs in the rocky dirt out back, his muscles aching pleasantly with the manual labor. The winter months are in full swing and the bitter cold sends wisps of icy breath swirling through the air when Castiel steps outside.
“No, I’m not scared of much these days,” he says quietly. He drives the blade through the cloth of her suit and straight through the meat of her shoulder. As the blade pierces the muscle, Naomi lets out a yell through clenched teeth that quickly fades into weak laughter.
“The angels haven’t found her yet,” Garth reports. “She’s safe. But...there is another problem. I’ve been listening to angel radio. Angels are coming up dead. We don’t know how or why. Just the other day Cassandra was found dumped behind an ally with wounds to her chest and ribs.”
And Dean does. He prods them in and out, giving soft, slow licks to the head of his cock as the soft noises drift through the quiet room. Castiel gasps and nods, murmuring ‘
Dean looks down. He presses his fingers through the sand, watching as it shifts and pours between his fingers.
“You don’t care,” Castiel snaps. “You were willing to eradicate an entire town. You would have killed me if it was convenient for you.” He shouldn’t feel so betrayed. But he does. He had almost come to trust Dean until today. And now, everything is falling apart. He’d never forget the look on his brother’s face as the demon entered his body.
"See, the problem with that is that I'm not like other angels," Dean says, quirking an eyebrow at Naomi. "I don't trade lives like that. At least, not anymore. Might be more convenient in the long run, sure, but between you and me? I'm getting sick of that game. So here's how it's gonna go: you're gonna hand over Castiel, and I'm gonna walk away with him and Jo, here, and I
“He ran. He was...much stronger than we anticipated. We fear he might be drinking demon blood to give himself abilities, though we can’t imagine why.”
Castiel doesn’t know. But he does know that organizing the notes and research that Balthazar left behind would make him happy.
Dean sighs. He doesn't bother pushing - not now. Not when he just woke up. "You really think we're gonna stay here? When's the last time we stayed anywhere for longer than six months?"
Over cereal (after the small kitchen fire had been extinguished, the scorched eggs abandoned in the garbage), Castiel can see that Dean is less tense than the night before.
surging through him, making his body feel weak and warm. He tries to twist his beaten face into a weak smile up at Dean - surely, he felt that, too.
The two laugh nervously. Tension hangs heavy in the air between them; they haven’t spoken of the incident since that day. And Dean had been trying to avoid him ever since. But Benny doesn’t seem any angrier with Dean than Dean had been with himself.
Gabriel trots over to the pair, offering a small, yellow flower in his tiny hand. “Here. For you,” he chirps. He gives his brother the dandelion. Castiel accepts it, and Gabriel’s small forehead scrunches up in a frown.
They run back across the sand. The roar fills Castiel’s ears, reaching a dizzying crescendo that would surely blow out his ears. It’s only Dean’s hand grasped tightly in his own that keeps him moving, keeps him trudging back over the beach before the water crashes down around them like icy, liquid concrete.
Downstairs, he hears Sam push through the door. In less than a minute, Dean can hear muffled yelling coming from downstairs; a sure sign that Sam and their father are going at it again. Sam never doing enough for the family. Sam using school work to “escape family responsibility.” The usual shit that Dean doesn’t want to deal with, but knows he has to for the sake of the sanity of the entire family. But Dean can't bring himself to break it up. Not now. He gives Castiel a pained, silent apology that Castiel dismisses with a wave of his hand.
She raises a hand and suddenly, Castiel can’t breathe. His vision flickers; white, red, and black. With his brother’s name on his lips, Castiel slips out of consciousness as footsteps thunder into the room in a burst of white.
Castiel is pacing the room when Balthazar returns from the kitchen. His sharp, blue eyes are cast down at the floor, his body taut and on-edge. The angry handprint on his shoulder tingles under his blue jacket, making him want to rip the fabric away from his body and fling it to the ground. But he doesn’t. It had been almost a full day since he’d met face-to-face with the angel, almost a day since Dean had cryptically told him that they would have
Balthazar pinches the bridge of his nose. “So you have no idea what sent you down there? None at all? Because I’m getting the feeling that maybe whatever pulled you down like that could have had the power to drag you out, too.” He sighs. “Look. I know a psychic - she’s the best there is. Little flirty. Pretty lady, though. I’m gonna contact her and see if she can get this figured out.”
“I do help out!” Sam snaps. He’s angry. But his voice wavers, giving way to his fear. “I make dinner, I do chores, I help you with the groceries. I clean every day! I have homework to do. Mrs. Smith wants to put me in the AP World History class and I have to read a bunch of books for it ahead of time. I already told you — “
“Hey, hey! Look, whatever’s going on, we can deal with it, okay? Dad, I told you I can pick up extra hours if you need me to — “
He’s not here to relive this perfect day. He has a mission - a promise he made both to Jo and himself. Was this what Jo meant by being tempted to stay…?
"Dean. Help your brother with the chairs," the boys' father barks. Castiel wipes away a trickle of water down his nose. He grabs the branch beside him in a tight grip, craning his neck to hear more. But, in the pouring rain that shows no sign of letting up, the branches are wet and terribly slippery. His grip slackers, and soon, his hand slides completely off the wet bark. His body tilts forward as he uselessly grasps for purchase. In a matter of seconds, he hits the wet ground with a choked cry, landing on his forearms and stomach. Pain shoots up his body, leaving him briefly immobile as his vision swims.
All at once, he remembers that Robert and Dean had very nearly razed an entire town just to keep a Seal from breaking. But Jo wouldn’t...would she?
Not that Castiel is surprised, but Dean is a quick learner. Soon, Castiel is completely inside Dean’s warm mouth, and Castiel lays back as his eyes flutter shut. He has to resist the urge to thrust into Dean’s mouth, and it takes all his willpower not to
“I know,” he says slowly. His voice is low, almost musical. He tilts his head, peering at Castiel as if studying him. “I know that angels raised you from hell.”
“It’s cool,” Dean assures him, a little shaken. He glances behind his shoulder. He’s grateful to be away from that guy, though he’s not sure what he’s supposed to be doing now. He’d feel bad just leaving Castiel out here and going home.
Castiel stops short, rooted in place as the other figure — a man — looks up from the woman, catching the dim light of the grimy warehouse windows. Castiel can see his expression easily, now. Short, ashy-blonde hair. Heavy, dark eyes with bags beneath them and a five o’clock shadow that makes him look far older than his age. Castiel gapes at his brother in surprise, shaking his head in slow disbelief.
After an hour, Dean turns in for the night and showers, letting the oil wash off his hands. He flops into bed, sighing in the dim light of his bedroom as Sam looks up from his comic book.
to my Father that you would find a way to neutralize your brother without needing to kill him. You made the same damn choice I would have made if it was one of my own brothers out there.”
how I’m feeling right now,” Castiel snaps. “The only thing keeping me from ripping you apart right now is the fact that
He will be a new prince of hell. Forever he will reign, on earth and in heaven above, and all it took — “
Even with Dean’s careless attitude towards what he’d just done, his heart aches for Dean - this was his home. He’ll have nothing to go back to after today. He’ll be stuck on earth - forever. Even still, with Dean singing under his breath in the most terrible, off-tune rendition of Bon Jovi Castiel has ever heard, his heart swells with a fondness he’s never felt for another person before.
Castiel thinks to himself. He looks at Dean miserably, suddenly uncomfortable seeing his own reflection in Dean’s eyes. He wants to crawl out of his skin and leave it to rot. No one was ever supposed to mention her name. The fact that she has appeared at the church with Dean and Anna was bad enough. No one was ever supposed to
When Castiel wakes up again, the thud of explosions fills his ears. Pain racks through his skull and his vision blurs and sways as he scrambles to his feet. Gripping the base of the closest tree, he tries to steady himself as he looks up at the hill.
“She was the last one,” Lucifer sighs. “But she did most of the work for me, killing those other two.” He turns his eyes up to his brother. His pale face is splattered with the witch’s blood. A small, knowing smile upturns the corners of his dry lips.
Dean smiles. Of course, Castiel could sing. Dean doesn’t know why he even wondered that in the first place. Music flows from Castiel as easily as a river finds its way to the sea.
He sleeps for almost five hours. Relief comes when nightmares don’t plague his sleep, allowing him to feel rested when he wakes. In the morning, he gets up, showers, and feeds himself a quick breakfast of yogurt and a granola bar from the bottom of his bag. And then, Castiel gets to work.
are going to be nice to him. He’s my friend. He took me in when I had nothing. And you walked into his house at
She said that he needs perspective. Whatever that means, Castiel has no intention of finding out. Giving the room another, uneasy glance, he grabs his bag and hurries out of the room, eager to put as much distance between himself and this place as possible.
“That’s...that’s great, Lucifer,” Castiel says once he’s close enough to look at it. Lucifer can’t be any older than nine or ten - of course, he isn't. This day is real; Castiel
That brightens Gabriel’s face. Castiel laughs, placing a gentle hand on his little brother’s shoulder as his smile lingers over towards Dean. They share a knowing grin before Dean grows embarrassed and has to duck his face.
“Ghosts were here,” Balthazar murmurs. “Don’t know if they’re here anymore, though. Whatever killed her just...left...the EMF signal is fading. I called up Rufus: same story across all the other spots. Hunters dead, their insides turned into pudding. Fading EMF signals. Whatever this is...this isn’t just some normal haunting. Bloody hell…”
Without another word, he storms back over to where she’s bound, pulls her lower eyelid down, and shoves the palmful of salt into her eye. She screams again and Castiel stumbles back, watching the salt run down her face with deep-seated satisfaction. That would be enough to hurt a human - badly. The part of him that reminds him that her vessel might still be alive is soft and quiet in the back of his head. He shoves it aside.
Dean goes to answer, but he can only laugh again. Tears spring at the edges of his eyes as he gasps for breath, and Castiel, as embarrassed as he is, clearly seems to be enjoying laughing at himself, too. Dean doesn’t even hear the front door open and shut or the familiar sound of his father’s footsteps thudding into the kitchen until they’re feet from him. He stops laughing at once, clearing his throat as he nervously peers around the couch. The light, laughter in his chest fades, leaving him taught and on-edge as quickly as the tension had left.
“The Devil was an angel, once,” Dean says quietly. "And Robert is a Loyalist. Wanted to raise the Devil. He...he tried to kill me. Or at least apprehend me. Got the upper hand. If it weren’t for your brother stepping in, I would have died. I was a coward. I couldn’t bring myself to kill a brother.”
In disbelief, Castiel remains silent for a long moment. He watches Dean, his head bowed. Poised to strike should this man -- this angel -- make a single wrong move. Not that he had anything to kill him with anyway; the demon blade hadn’t worked. Neither had their guns.
Castiel casts his gaze down to the floor. His finger finds a loose piece of the brown carpet and he absently pulls it through his fingers.
He recognizes his surroundings immediately; he’s back home, on the farm. Beside him, the gentle breeze stirs ripples across the water of the pond, hissing gently through the reeds. A handful of crickets hop across the grass. Laughter from the other side of the pond makes him turn, tilting his head as he squints to identify the source of the sound. But it’s laughter that he would recognize anywhere, even now in the voice of a child. By the dock, Lucifer sits by the pond, grinning from ear to ear as he lifts a rock and gasps in surprise.
“Dean?” Castiel asks softly when Dean doesn’t move. Maybe he’s nervous about this, too. Dean had taken to being human well,
She doesn’t answer right away. She glances out one of the windows near the door, her hand curling into a fist by her side.
Castiel touches Lucifer’s grave with the pads of his fingers. “My brother made a lot of mistakes. And I clung to him too tightly to let myself live. He hurt me, even if he thought he was doing the right thing. I think...I need to let him go. The same way I need to let my father go, too.”
Jo scoffs. “I’m an angel, you dumbass. I can do a lot of things. And I think it’s time you get a little perspective.”
Gingerly, Castiel lifts up the sleeve of his t-shirt with shaking fingers. Across his shoulder, a red, raised handprint scars his skin. Something had grabbed him by the shoulder and left that imprint there on his flesh. The scar burns, but the burn is entirely unlike the scorching flames of hell that, molecule by molecule, yearned to burn his very soul of its essence until there was nothing left. This burn is a live wire of nerves and light, not unpleasant as it is strange and alien, so unlike anything Castiel has ever felt. Swallowing thickly, he pushes the sleeve of his shoulder back down, concealing the handprint once more.
Castiel shuts the door, leaving Dean on the porch alone with the thoughts racing like bats in the night. He hurries home, eager to clear his head and the thudding in his chest.
“I know you are, kiddo,” he whispers. There’s so much pride in his eyes, it rubs off on Castiel, too. He had come to see Jo as a friend and not just a trusted ally.
“I do not believe that my relationship with my religious faith is one that God would appreciate any longer,” he says cryptically. Balthazar only rolls his eyes. Balthazar used to be a church leader - he’d cut himself off from any religious ties long ago.
Dean nods. “I wanted to say something to you, anyway.” Quiet, Dean moves to sit beside him, still gazing over the clear water. Castiel looks around them, suddenly realizing that he knows this place.
"Come get him then, Dean. If that's even your real name." Her voice is smooth and unphased. Sharp and measured as the day she'd thrown him onto the rack in hell.
He tries to avoid mirrors when he can, but with the woman’s blood and intestinal fluid still settling across Castiel’s skin, he knows that he has to clean himself off to be able to think clearly enough to drive. He feels clouded and on-edge:
Dean runs into the kitchen, stopping short when he sees his father and Sam standing from across the room. Sam’s face is flushed and Dean can tell his younger brother is on the brink of tears.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean grunts. “You don’t gotta say that back, I know humans - er, myself included now, I guess - don’t like throwing that around a whole lot, but —”
The older Castiel doesn’t have to tell him where they’re going for it to be abundantly clear. As the woods grow thicker and darker along the roadside, a looming presence in the night, the familiar curves and twists of the road bring Castiel back to memories he’d tried so hard to burn. A place of beauty and peace dotted by pockets of wildflowers of every imaginable color; a palace that would routinely haunt Castiel’s nightmares as it drowned beneath rivers of blood.
A soft, gentle fondness that makes Castiel feel strange and vulnerable; that feeling he had in his dream where he swore Dean was staring straight into the light of his soul.
He should be scoping out the rest of the camp, trying to figure out what’s going on before he decides if he should stay or leave - but now, he’s drawn to himself and this other man. The two are walking away from their spot, the other man touching Castiel’s elbow as they make way for a cabin at the end of the path. Castiel follows them from a distance, grateful that the overcast sky and threat of rain seem to be moving the rest of the camp steadily indoors. He doesn’t want to have to deal with being spotted. Watching from close behind, he ducks behind a cluster of bushes as the two wander in through the doors.
Castiel opens his mouth, shaking his head with a weak cry. He raises a hand as Benny brings his fist down on Castiel’s face again and again and again. His vision flickers in and out, and for a long moment, Castiel is sure he’s looking down the barrel all over again. He’s going to die, again, except this time, he is going to die curled up in a gas station bathroom by the hand of a man whose death he was responsible for.
Castiel stumbles over, swinging the iron pan through her body and sending her away. Within seconds, Benny reappears and grabs Castiel by the throat, pulling and dragging him to the ground. Castiel chokes and sputters, trying to break free from Benny’s tight hold in vain.
“This is my room,” Castiel murmurs. The room is very different from Dean’s own; tidy and lined with books, there isn’t much floor space to be had that isn’t taken up by Castiel’s small, single bed or the large instrument against the far wall by the window. What space does remain is taken up by bookshelves. At a closer glance, Dean notices that many of the books are on theology and music theory.
Dean recoils, as though struck. He feels his mouth hang open as the jarring memory of Gabriel Novak on the large, hospital stretcher floods his vision. His chest feels tight, his lungs unresponsive as his whole body trembles. When Dean goes to speak again, his voice is a raspy whisper.
“You better try,” Castiel growls, trying and failing to sound angry. He wants to feel angry again, but now he feels too drained to do anything but stand on his own two feet. “Why was my brother trying to break a Seal?”
“Cas’ — Cas’, what happened?” he gasps. Castiel turns to face him, his eyes filled with tears. Michael follows his younger brother outside, looking dazed and pale. He glances between the two, unable to believe what he’s seeing. Michael barely acknowledges that Dean is there at all.
this man. Standing only a few inches taller than Castiel himself, the man with the beret and wide shoulders is none other than Benny LaFitte.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Dude, are you sure you’re okay? You look like someone just scrambled your brains on a stove. Have you heard a single thing I’ve said today?”
Castiel put Balthazar on the task of researching anything he could about the Seals. But all that he’d found had confirmed what Dean had told Castiel - there were six-hundred and sixty-six. Ritualistic slaughter, certain spells that had to be conducted in various parts of the world. And only sixty-six had to be broken for the Devil to walk the earth. It had done nothing to ease Castiel’s nerves.
Both of them are laughing. And, even from a distance away, careful to keep his hood pulled over his head to not draw attention to himself, he can spot the telltale signs that he’s
“I tried to keep your nightmares out,” a voice says. Castiel’s head hurts. He tries to push himself upright, but a pair of hands gently lower him back onto the bed.
“And now my consciousness is retreating. I’m probably screaming somewhere, right now. Strapped to a chair. Getting my grace burned back to its factory setting or something. And until the process is finished...I’m here. Guess that means you’re here too.”
“I mean,” Balthazar says slowly, “Lucifer might have found it. The demon. Your angel buddy told you Lucifer may have received the help of demons. Could it be this demon that’s helping him along? To raise the Devil? Maybe he hated your family so much that he’s working with the very thing that killed them all.”
“You can call me Jo.” She smiles at him, taking a slow step closer as she trails her fingers across the pew.
She smiles. “Good. Now...I’m going to try and make this as painless for you as possible. Use my grace and find Dean. You’ll have to move quickly. When you get up there, you’re going to be sent to your version of heaven. You’re going to be tempted to stay, Castiel.
The fire had taken everything from them; their home. Most of their possessions. Their mother. Jumping from apartment to apartment, from hotel to hotel when their father couldn't hold down a job. And now they've ended up here: Lawrence, Kansas. The single most boring town on Planet Earth. Dean tries to relax as he pulls the covers up to his chin.
“Welcome to the future, Castiel,” Jo’s voice says behind him. The breach in the silence makes him start. He whirls around to face her.
Sam sighs. “You have to try. For your friend. I like Castiel, Dean. He’s a good friend. And you...you’re happier when you’re with him. When he’s happy, I know you are, too.”
“Who are you?!” Castiel demands. He meets the creature’s eyes; those same, achingly human eyes. Though Castiel knows this man, whatever he is, is far from that.
“This is the end,” he says simply. “It’s a world where you and I were too cowardly to do what we believed was right. We wanted somebody else to fix the world for us - and now, it’s broken beyond repair.”
Dean sighs. “I’ll explain later. Benny — was that his name? — will be back. Come with me.” Dean reaches out a hand to grab Castiel’s wrist.
He blinks, and the world disappears. He’s no longer outside - he’s on a bed, inside the motel room where Lucifer left him, the sounds of Dean’s pained cries still ringing in his ears. Gazing out the window, Castiel nearly weeps with relief when he sees the street is back to its normal, fixed self. He checks the date on the calendar folded up on the motel table: 2009. He’s back in his right time.
“With Robert and most of the Samuel loyalists gone, there aren’t many extremists left to chase. But it’s working. I...I’m doing good, Dean.”
“You don’t know the half of it,” she mutters. “But it doesn’t matter. I’ll make sure you get into heaven. Do you trust me?”
Castiel gives her a low glare. God above, he knows better than to let her taunting get under his skin. She wants this. She wants to see him become the monster he’s always been underneath. But he didn’t come here to prove a point - he came here for information and a chance to rid the world of her forever. One less demon; that’s the ultimate goal, isn’t it? He isn’t particularly partial to angels or what they do - but maybe, if there is still something to believe in, keeping angels alive is a noble enough cause.
“When I came to Balthazar’s house after Lucifer and I ran from the fire, he was drunk,” Castiel says absently, picking up the glass Balthazar routinely drank from. “But he didn’t question it. He just...he let us inside. He told us to put our stuff down upstairs. Even when Lucifer didn’t speak for months on end after…”
Castiel nods. He can work with that. “Okay...okay. But how do I know I won’t just go back down to hell? How can I be sure that if I...
Castiel nods. He seems to understand where Dean is coming from, though the puzzled expression never leaves his face.
“I’ll make sure you finish school. I know that’s important to you. You’ll finish. And we can come back...but not while we’re still dependent on Dad.”
Castiel shakes his head. Balthazar bites his lower lip, knowing full-well where this conversation is going. “It doesn’t matter now,” Castiel says quickly. “If God is real…”
“Oh — Balthazar says ‘hi’, by the way,” she says with a warm smile. At the very mention of his name, Castiel finds himself forcing back tears. “He’s happy in heaven. He’s got a big library, a loud TV, and a lot of booze. He actually wanted me to tell you something.”
“And you - me - were supposed to be Michael’s. With me as Michael’s vessel, the connection he has to his brother - the Devil - and the connection I have to mine would allow him to find the Devil and my brother in a heartbeat. Funny enough, the two of them have been quiet. Haven’t done a single thing since the Devil was raised from the Cage. It’s Michael’s angels that have been hellbent on killing him to fulfill some kind of twisted destiny. I have to wonder if he’d be willing to give up his grace to stop this mess once and for all. If I can find him.”
He prays to Dean with no answer - not that Castiel expects one, anyway. If Jo is to be believed, Dean’s mind is set on what he thinks he has to do: return to his factory settings. Wipe away every part of him that is too human to be a proper soldier, all so that he can end the world in a crazed quest to find the Devil - if the Devil gets out of his Cage in the first place, which is looking more and more likely now that Lucifer is out of Castiel’s reach.
The two lay back on the bed in silence, listening to the sound of the piano until it comes to a quiet close. It’s a song Dean doesn’t recognize; dips in the chords he doesn’t recognize, a melody lost to his ears. He drifts off to sleep quickly that night, and in his dreams, he sees himself watching a stranger play the piano; a stranger he knows better than the back of his hand. Guilt still rests heavy in his stomach from his argument with Sam. He doesn’t like his father’s behavior any more than Sam does -- but the difference between them is that Dean knows how to deal with it.
Kneeling beside him, Dean traces his finger through the soil, smiling when he sees a little sprout stretching its leaves toward the sun.
And with that, Castiel turns and hurries off into the night, leaving Dean dazed as he watches his friend hurry away. The moon covers the quiet town in an ethereal glow, and a chilly wind blows through the leaves, stirring the coattails of Castiel’s trenchcoat behind him. Dean watches him leave in astonishment, wanting nothing more than to reach out to him, to follow him into the dark and learn the unearthly secrets his friend holds so close to his own heart.
“S’cold,” Gabriel mumbles. Dean laughs. With a thin parka and a tight pair of gloves over his hand, Dean had actually felt warm with exertion, hardly aware of the biting, mid-December air.
John frowns again. “He’s queer as a wingless bird, Dean. I’m surprised you of all people can’t see that.”
“You’re the one who said that he needs to figure this out on his own, right?” Robert snaps. “So let him figure it out.”
He follows a far distance back, only hurrying to catch up when Castiel rounds the corner of the block and disappears out of sight. From this distance, Castiel wouldn’t be able to hear his footsteps, especially with Dean creeping across the grass of the neighborhood lawns. The streetlights and faint glimmer of the crescent moon provide enough light for Dean to watch Castiel and follow him from a far enough distance not to be detected.
That isn’t something you say to someone who will be gone for an afternoon. Or for a week. Or a month.
Gabriel mumbles a tired "g'night", waving a tiny hand towards Dean as he slumps over against his brother's shoulder once more. Watching them go, Dean hears Gabriel mumble something to Castiel about singing him a song. With a jolt, Dean wonders if Castiel can actually sing - he wouldn’t be surprised if he could. Curiosity gets the better of him, and he shifts closer to the open door, straining his ears for any sound from the room beside Castiel’s. Sure enough, he
Balthazar leans back in his chair. “No. You just showed up on my doorstep looking like you’d seen a bloody ghost. Your house burned down, so I...I figured that was only normal. Lucifer didn’t speak for months, even when you two started hunting whatever torched your family that day. I knew your father was a nutcase, so I didn’t even ask. You only ever told me something had happened and that you needed to get as far away as possible. Honestly, if one of you had just straight-up killed your dad, I wouldn’t have blamed you. That man was a bastard.”
“C’mon, man. Don’t you want a break, too? Don’t you miss all the places we used to see when we were out on the road?”
Dean immediately regrets what he said, but he doesn’t take them back. He bows his head as Sam gives him a low, heavy look. In the tense, heavy silence, the sound of the piano drifts through the room, faint and barely audible. Sam, irritated, tells Dean that he’s going to bed.
Castiel nods. He still seems puzzled. But he appears to understand better than before. Affectionately, Dean pats him on the shoulder as a soft tendril of longing creeps into his chest. He’s always suspected that Castiel is...not quite comfortable in this world. God only knows that his friend is about as strange as they come. But Dean wants him to be happy. Romantically and otherwise. Other than Sam, Dean’s never felt such a strong urge for another’s happiness like he has for his friend.
Graffiti lines the buildings - or, rather, what’s left of them. Much like the parking lot, the buildings are missing pieces. Roofs are cracked, windows smashed, or missing altogether. Some houses are completely gone, reduced to a pile of rubble. He jogs across the lot, coming to a halt at the sidewalk as he looks down the length of the cracked road where mountains of trash line the streets. As he draws closer, the smell of rot and filth makes Castiel cover his mouth in an attempt to suppress a gag. Castiel keeps his hand on his belt where his gun is tucked safely in his holster, his eyes trace the endless lines of graffiti sprawled across the sides of cars, abandoned trucks, and broken-down houses. At the end of the street, a single word scrawled across the front of a warehouse in dripping red letters makes Castiel freeze.
Garth looks down. “I don’t know. I wanted to contact you, but I was afraid it would alert the others.”
He glances at his Bible again and ponders over every question that the book could never answer. Every question he’s never wanted that book to answer. In a quiet fit of frustration, Castiel looks away.
“I would not approach them if I were you, Dean,” a voice behind him says quietly. A heavy hand lands on his shoulder, and Dean nearly jumps a foot in the air. Startled, he whirls around to face Castiel’s steely, blue eyes, heavy with sleeplessness.
Camp Chitaqua. Castiel has never heard of that place before. But if this message is to be trusted, then he might be able to find the answers he’s looking for.
“Where’s your boyfriend, Dean-o?” he taunts. Arry kicks at Dean’s shins, ushering a pained growl from Dean’s throat. This may have been, no,
He throws her spasming body to the floor with an impatient huff. She claws at her throat uselessly, and Castiel has to step back, disturbed by the sight before him. Finally, as blood pools across the floor, her body twitches, and stills.
“Dean will need to be the one to guide you back into your body. I’ll watch over your body here and keep you safe. But I can’t stress enough that you will have to move
“I think this was his,” Dean points out. The clasp is broken, likely damaged from the fall. His younger brother and their father peer at it curiously.
“I was terrified. Utterly paralyzed. I just...I stood there. Didn't call the police. I just watched my brother stare at the body and drop the knife onto the floor beside her. He was breathing heavily...and that was it, you know? His breathing...my breathing...neither of us moved or said a single word. But the fight must have been loud because our father came out of his study and saw what happened. And then he tied Lucifer to a chair and began performing an exorcism. Funny enough...Lucifer wasn’t possessed by a demon. He was just frightened and angry. And I just...stood there. And I watched. But that exorcism ritual? It wasn’t written for expelling demons. I don’t know where my father found it. But it summoned
“That’s what I thought,” Dean breathes, gritting his teeth in anger. “Sam...we don’t need Dad. All he’s ever done...is hurt us. I know he...he’s tried. And I ain’t saying that he...he’s done
“It will be a...tricky job,” he says slowly. “But it will provide a good source of income for myself.”
“Lucifer!” Castiel has to yell to be heard over the crescendo of noise. The windows rattle and the floor begins quaking violently beneath their feet. “We need to get out of here!”
“You just don’t think you deserve to be saved, do you?” he murmurs. Castiel flinches but says nothing. His silence speaks louder than any confession he could make here and now.
Sam bares his teeth. “You’re being a jerk,” he hisses at their father. Dean springs into action, spinning around to face his father when he takes a long, heavy stride towards Sam. But it’s not enough; John grabs Dean’s arm and shoves him aside, causing Dean to stumble against the table with a muffled grunt. He jerks his hand forward and grabs Sam by the shirt in a hard grip. Immediately, Dean watches as his brother’s lingering threads of anger give way to pure, unfiltered fear.
“You’ll probably be fine. But this book has warding sigils to keep angels away. I don’t think they’re gonna bother you, but just in case they come looking, these will make it harder for them to detect you. Draw them on your doors and windows after I leave. I’m sorry you can’t come with us, but you’d only be a liability out there.”
“Your guess is as good as mine. I have no idea what could have dragged me down like that,” he lies softly. Easily. He wonders what other lies would spill past his careful lips. Castiel was always a terrible liar - perhaps it was his greatest deficit as a hunter. But lying feels as easy as picking up a blade and plunging it into a monster’s heart.
“Leave him alone!” Benny snaps. That makes the three boys laugh. Dean tries to pull away from Dick’s grip to no avail. Rearing back, Dick punches Dean in the mouth, sending his head rocking back. Blood spills into his mouth as a biting pain shoots up his jaw, numbing his entire face. Despite himself, Dean spits the mouthful of blood right into the boy’s face with a short laugh.
“I can’t,” he breathes. The simple truth cuts through him razor-shop. “I’ve got my brother to look out for, remember? My dad...he’s...he needs me. That car shop is all we have. Without it, we’d be back on the road again.”
“Don’t mention it,” Dean murmurs. Waving them both goodbye, Dean watches Benny take off down the street. Castiel’s gaze lingers on the boy, watching him go.
Robert clenches his fist. All at once, Castiel can’t breathe. His lungs constrict, unable to expand and take in proper air. He croaks and gasps like a fish out of water as Robert twists his fist, making Castiel sink to his knees as he claws desperately at his throat.
Dean’s frantic thoughts are interrupted when Sam pushes open their bedroom door. He takes one look at Dean — his puffy, tearstained eyes, his red face, and immediately looks down at the floor.
“Hey,” Dean hushes him gently. He gives him a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I stayed ‘cause I wanted to. Hell, I stayed ‘cause I needed to. You...you made all this mess worth it, alright? Can I just...can I just make you feel good?”
“You’re supposed to put it in your hair,” he insists. Castiel chuckles and tucks it behind his ear. “Like that?”
That seems to relax Sam if only a little bit. He gives his brother a small smile. He doesn’t need to think about it anymore. Not when he trusts his brother more than he’s ever trusted anybody else in his life.
He wouldn’t get rid of these for anything, especially now that he actually has space to display them. In his room, he sets the stack down beside the others as he pulls at the silver necklace in his pocket again to show it to Sam.
“Gabriel. We have to,” he says seriously. Dean shakes his head, placing a hand on his shoulder. Castiel ignores it.
sweetie.” She turns her head sharply to Jo, and Joanne flies off her feet, an invisible force striking her hard enough to be flung against the stained glass. The force of her body makes it crack, but it does not shatter. Her body crumples to the floor. He turns to run to her, but the woman freezes him in place with a flick of her hand.
Dean shouts back to his father that he’s heading out for the day, before hurrying out of the garage and back out onto the street.
“You left your mark on me when you pulled me from hell,” Castiel groans as Dean forces his head back. Dean’s free hand flicks the angel blade across his throat, pressing it to his exposed skin. Blood beads up from the wound, making Castiel whimper in pain. “Part of you is...a part of me. You can’t deny that.”
. He offers his hand and Castiel hesitantly accepts it, climbing to his feet with relative ease. He looks at Dean in astonishment as he quickly brushes himself off, looking around for any sign that Benny might return.
Three weeks of nightmares and no angel to keep them at bay. Castiel can’t tell if seeing Dean is a relief or enough to make him wish he was still asleep. Maybe he’s exhausted and stressed beyond belief, but his first thought upon seeing him is that he looks good. Handsome, even. More so than usual. He’s used to seeing him in a leather jacket and ratted jeans, but now, he’s wearing a faded button-up flannel and a surprisingly nice pair of jeans with no holes or rips. He even combed his hair.
“Perfect, you’re perfect, mine,” Dean chants softly. He doesn’t even seem to be aware he’s doing it. Castiel squeezes his eyes shut, the praise making him feel weak. He doesn’t
Ben was raised well, he was happy and he was loved. Whether he was there or not, Ben got a normal life.
Jack went into the bathroom, not saying a word, and Ben stormed for one of the little vodkas in the fridge, to which Dean snapped to attention.
“You aren't bothered by it, right? You shouldn't be surprised at all.” Pudding purred in response, calmly blinking at Dean, who remembered he had cat like hearing as well for the time being. He shrugged and nodded in understanding.
“Oh I'm digging, all right! I'm digging just how perfect you look, even when you're covered in dirt~!”
and you do everything you can to research more about it or find content with it.” Ben looked at him for a moment, before going back to packing.
“Dean, it's your turn to take out the trash.” He stated firmly. Dean turned to face his brother, nodded at the trash can, and shrugged.
“Been building it up since I was ‘bout fifteen, yknow? Start early. Get prepared.” He replied calmly. Cas eyed him.
We are half way through the plot now, fellas! Shits going to get real, but first we have to learn whats so different about this universe!
"I hear family angst, who's leaving me out?" Dean walked into the library, a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Don’t worry kid,” Dean reached under his seat, and then pulled out a bag of McDonald's. “We’ve got you covered. Nothin a good ol’ Micky D’s can't fix.”
Ben thought about how insane this kinda was. He was on the road with complete strangers- one of which wasn't human, and he was planning on living with them.
He sped into a quick-walk by the time he saw the impala, and once he was over there, he was basically running.
Dean set the gun down, and the witch smiled, snapping her fingers once again and allowed Sam to breath. Sam panted, and stared at Dean in shock. Dean looked away from him, and back to the witch, narrowing his eyes.
“I'd put that down if I were you.” She responded coyly. She snapped her finger, and instantly, Sam began to choke violently. “This is a neat trick, ain't it? I set up a good ol hexing set with Sammys picture, and all you gotta do is burn it! Which, is pretty easy when you've memorized how to summon a small fire easily. I can put it out once you drop the pistol, though!”
Mary walked into the kitchen with Sam on her tail, and stopped abruptly as she recognized Dean laying on the table, passed out. An entire bottle of Fireball was empty next to him, along with multiple beers.
“Why’d he already have tha….nevermind.” Sam sighed. He went back to the impala and swung open the trunk, grabbing some Dead Man's Blood and a machete. He slammed the trunk and walked into the warehouse, gazing around in curiosity. Dean was already searching for someone to gank.
Sam was fun, too. Like a weird uncle. He was probably the healthiest out of them all- he went on morning jogs, he ate things like salad and healthy stuff in general, and he checked in with Ben a lot to make sure he was okay. It was a bit annoying, but he kinda appreciated it.
His stupid, rough-n-tough brother- he wondered if that's why he started nesting the second they got the bunker.
“CMON OUT, BLOOD SUCKING BITCHES!” He laughed. Sam gazed around in caution, and perked up once he heard a hiss. A vampire snarled and leapt at him- to which Sam jumped back and fired a dart of blood at it. The vampire screeched, and there was another snarl as one leapt at Dean. It tackled him, knocking and pinning him to the ground. Dean laughed and kicked up into its abdomen, making it yelp and fall back onto the ground. Dean instantly stood back up, and ran over the the vampire struggling to stand. He swung his machete and sliced its head off like a hot knife through butter. Sam ran over to the other vamp, swinging his machete across its neck. It sliced through the struggling vamps tracia, and as things seemed to go in slow motion, Sam threw up the machete into the air and flipped it with the momentum of the swing he just did. He swung backwards along the same track, finishing the job and cutting it’s head off completely.
“My name is Gabriel.” He said casually. “You and your brother thought I was dead, which I was, but Dad decided it was my time to come back.”
“Another move, and she gets it! Drop the damn gun!” He snarled. Sam stared at the werewolf, narrowing his eyes.
“Normally i'd root for the underdog kids who get bullied, but you are one nasty, messed up witch.” He snarled. With that, he squeezed the trigger, firing and hitting her between the eyes with a witch killing bullet.
Dean sat up, eyes wide open. Sam sat up, too, watching Dean, waiting for him to get out of bed, but...he didn't this time.
“Yup.” He snagged the bottle and shoved it into the bag. “... I've been planning to go off it after college, though, and I've kinda gone cold turkey for the past two days...I'm just gonna use the rest of the pills to wean myself off.”
“Do not try that again, Dean. I’m not afraid to hurt you.” He growled, using his old angel-in-command voice. Whatever she was dealing with, Castiel hoped Mary was having an easier time working with Sam.
“What do you mean?” He rasped awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. Dean chuckled slightly and turned back around to focus on the road.
about normally but was genuinely interested in now that the words came from Cas’ mouth- fuck, hed actively put in research about bees just to crack jokes about them with Cas, just to see him smile, just to heat that tiny little laugh. He wanted to touch him, play with his tie, ruffle his hair to annoy him, jokingly place his hand on his shoulder and go
The voice of a young waitress snapped Dean back into reality, and he looked up, grinning as if he hadn't just been having a mental break down.
“FUCKING HELL!” She spat, struggling and reaching into one of the satchels at her side, grabbing a flask of some sort. She splashed it onto the angel, and began to chant something. Afterwards, fire lit to Castiel's trench coat, and he yelped in pain, releasing the girl. The stench of holy fire burned in Dean's throat, and he stood up, anger pulsing through him.
“Hyperfocusing- think about having an interest, but it just kinda consumes your mind and how you think
Sam struggled to remember what Dean looked like when he was real little, but he’s always struggled with those little sparks in his eyes. He wasn't sure when Dean lost his innocence, but he knew he should’ve been learning the differences between UpperCase and LowerCase letters instead. The light was always getting dimmer and dimmer, flickering a bit as Dean reignited the fuel with alcohol once he turned 14, but it was always
“So...what're we gonna do with the cat?” Sam asked, gesturing to Pudding- who was laying on Dean's lap.
“Please make it the former.” Cas breathed in exhaustion, hanging up. Sam shoved his phone back into his pocket and looked at Mary.
Finally, they got back to the motel, even the angels exhausted. They sat down for a while silently until Sam broke it.
The witch went limp, and then fell to the ground as the overwhelming power the demon felt began to ebb away.
“I said no, Dean.” Mary snarled at her two sons, very tired of their shit. Reluctantly, they let her come with.
“OH FUCK YEAH!” Dean exclaimed. Another vampire jumped down from the ceiling, snarling and flinging itself at Dean. Dean's eyes turned pitch black as he snarled back, then kicked it to the ground. He brought down the machete and sliced its head in half, a sickening splatter sound mixed with a cry was heard from this. Two more vamps jumped down from the rafters, both hurtling themselves at Sam. Sam shot one with dead man's blood, and swung the machete at the other, sending it’s head rolling. Dean ambushed the one infected with blood, laughing and slicing it across the chest, then hacking through its neck.
“Right. Anyways, Cas y- ...what are you doing?” Dean rose an eyebrow when he looked behind him, seeing Castiel's wings had suddenly spread open as Dean addressed him. Cas blushed slightly and sat back in an obviously fake-comfortable fashion.
He regretted a lot of things he’s said to Dean, actually. While he’s been pissed at him before, he never really noticed how much he did for him, how much he loved him, until he became a demon.
“You’re hesitating.” He scoffed. “You’re scared of hurting me. Aren’t demons supposed to be cold? Careless?”
Now, Sam has seen people sleepwalk, he has experienced himself doing it, even- he was little when he did it, Dean always getting up from bed to guide Sam back to his with a glass of water, but the way Dean acted here…
