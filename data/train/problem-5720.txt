It was all a trap.
Tony smiled weakly, grateful for the gesture. “I enrolled in A.A., went to therapy and slowly fixed my life. Bit by bit. But it wasn’t until I stepped into a drag queen bar where I felt… Safe. And accepted. And then one evening - I had the last glass of alcohol in my life, on the night of my first performance as Red Velvet. I wanted to celebrate her,” when Tony looked at Steve, tears were shining in his eyes and he noticed Steve frowning at him and he knew the reason why. “It was alcohol-free,” he laughed, meaning the bottle of sparkling wine he kept drinking yesterday, brought by Bucky. “Tootsie knows I have a problem.”
"Did you give me a manicure while I was sleeping?" Steve asked, eyes glued to hands that didn't look anymore like the ones he remembered having.
"Do you want me to tone it down?"
“Correct.”
"Morning, Sam!"
"Was it the same bar where you met Tony?" Sarah asked in an enticing voice, not knowing the full love story behind Steve and Tony's relationship.
"We are losing," Steve replied in a grunt. He turned to Tony and saw two people looking at him.
Somehow from being too shy to pee in front of the other, their relationship developed to this. That was some progress.
"Mhuh?" Steve said with a mouthful of potatoes, almost dropping his fork. "Dohny?"
“You are so sweet, Tony,” Sarah laughed, and Steve could just silently agree, feeling like a fool. “I will leave you boys alone, now. I really want to get home and try that facial mask you recommended to me.”
“We really have to do this?”
It had to happen and someone had to snap. Just, why, oh why, it had to be Tony? Steve thought about many scenarios. How to stop Bruce if he would Hulk out, how to contain Thor if he would rage out and throw tables, but Tony had this unstoppable energy Steve was never good at handling. Sure, he tried to throw some distractions in his husband's way, but Tony was so good at deflecting it was crazy. Once Iron Man set his mind on something, he had to achieve it. It was quite admirable, but in the current times, just frightening.
"WHAT THE HELL!" Tony yelped, unsure what to hold to, and clutched to the armrest, curling feet to himself.
"Nothing, it's nothing - " Steve tried to brush it off, but another sneeze happened. And then another one. And then he felt his throat becoming tight and eyes water and all of this was oddly familiar and disturbing.
"I would love to have a dog," Steve said, smiling at the idea. He never had pets growing up and dogs were wonderful companions and friends.
"I am here, I am here!" Steve barreled into the baby room, almost tripping over some toys laying on the floor. Still better than stepping barefoot on one of the colorful, wooden blocks, Peter liked to toss into a basket and then dump everything out. He skidded to his weeping husband and handed Tony the bottle.
Still, Tony would take his chance. The worst would happen was Steve not texting him back.
The song ended on a sad note and Steve was back again, together with the crowd and clapping with everyone else. His mind cooled down and he felt that he could think more rationally, yet when Red Velvet smiled gratefully at the audience, his heart did that weird flip-flop thing he heard about only from the movies.
Steve grimaced. Tony was looking more tormented than he Steve felt and he didn’t want that. He was in shock, sure, after all, he did something he feared of for so many years and maybe the overwhelming feeling got the worst out of him, and in the end -
Steve, who was laying in bed, kinda dying from silent laughter, had to compose himself before speaking. Everyone deserved some privacy and when Tony had walked minutes earlier into their en suite bathroom, Figaro, who seemed deep asleep in the bed, woke up as soon as the door closed and began a meowing and scratching concert under the door, demanding to be let in. It was cute how Fig always wanted to be close to Tony, but sometimes it was bothersome. Like now, when Tony couldn't even do his business in peace.
"Um, hi," Steve blinked, not knowing who Latrice was and why was calling Tony so early. Then he realized, that it probably was a stage name and Latrice was one of Red Velvet's sisters. Mr. Blue Velvet and Miss Red Velvet's, as they were dubbed in the Olive yesterday, engagement was no secret, photos from the event already going around on social media.
After seconds, his phone beeped again.
"I… I think I know you," Steve said, not letting his eyes off Tootsie. The guy turned to him with a slightly mocking smile.
After a while, Steve pulled his pants up and flushed the water, feeling better. He took the coffee-scented soap and washed his hands, noticing in the mirror, that Tony stopped paying attention to him and was elbows deep in the water, washing the long strands gently, trying not to tangle them.
"I will go easy on you," Steve promised, taking a fight stance.
Maybe it wasn't the intention, but the first thing that came to Red's mind was that Prince Charming from "
“That’s Thor. He is Loki’s older brother. Stepbrother. It is funny to watch them bicker, but they are very effective.”
Steve watched and listened, adoring every word, every subtle gesture. The way light fell on her face and long eyelashes cast shadows on pale cheeks. Her voice was smooth and deep, but raspy on the edges, showing some masculinity. It was a beautiful mix.
Immediately, Tony broke into giggles, arms coming up to push the soldier away. "Nahahaha! Stahap!" Tony gasped out, pressing his chin down to his chest, shielding the spot. It was a short attack, but still left him a bit breathless and with heated cheeks. Speaking of cheeks… When Tony covered one spot, another became available. And Steve did just that, leaning in closer and blinking against the skin on Tony's cheek, giving him a butterfly kiss.
Steve chuckled softly, looking at his husband's calm and smiling face. Tony had this almost magical ability to fix things for Steve. After all, his husband was a mechanic, building and fixing was his thing and it went further than machines.
"Who is that?"
"My stomach kinda demands those brownies first."
“My parents died in the same year when I became of age and was able to legally drink. Not that it didn’t happen before but - back then, this is how my visits here looked. I bought flowers, candles, and the cheapest bottle of bourbon. I stayed here for hours, even after dark, not knowing what to do with myself because they were gone and I was all alone. One time, I went too far. Someone found me in the morning, barely conscious and delirious, clenching an empty bottle in my hand. I was admitted into the hospital and had my stomach pumped, was on a drip and stayed there for two weeks because I also got pneumonia from staying all night out on the cold ground. And when I was let out, I felt I had to change something. That I can’t live like that anymore.”
"Ticklish spot?" Steve asked with a smile, and didn't wait for an answer, just kept kissing the spot over and over again.
"Hm? What was that for?" Steve asked, looking at his boyfriend with a smile.
Steve made his decision.
"I hate you," Steve groaned, but obediently stayed on the stool. Call him weak.
" flashed on the screen, read in a strong voice, with listening to the shops where the toys were available. Steve narrowed his eyes, spotting something written on the bottom of the screen. "
Tony was right, and it didn’t hurt to remind themselves where the other was the most ticklish, but it certainly involved a lot of laughter and one of the best naps they ever had.
Sam whistled. "Believe me, no one wants to see that, pal."
"I would say he even likes," Tony smiled, petting cat's fluffy head, who became very interested in the cat-Hulk plushie.
Steve gave a fake laugh, feeling hot under his collar. He should have forked out some cash for a dictaphone, but honestly, it slipped his mind. Who would have thought that being a fake journalist was such a tough job?
"And who will cook it all?" Steve asked in humor, watching Tony happily munching away. It was a rare occasion when they had some free time to get away from superhero duties. Currently, they were enjoying a mini-break in one of the smaller hotels in an even smaller city, away from everyone who could recognize them. They had even signed in under a fake name, which became a common practice during their short travels.
After riding a few blocks, Steve parked his bike at the appointed spot. He leaned his head to the side, looking at the building in front of him. It was an auto repair shop, one belonging to the T&R franchise, located all over the country. That was Tony's day job? He couldn't imagine Tony working in a place like this. Maybe Tony was an accountant of some sort. Some office job. That sounded more like the Tony he knew, who didn't like to get dirty and went for manicures on regular basis.
“God, Tony,” Steve rubbed his face again. “I just panicked, okay? It doesn’t have to do anything with you being who you are.”
"See?" Tony smiled wider, pointing at his face, and spreading his fingers. "Flawless," he said, making a clicking sound with his tongue.
“Ah - hahaha!” Tony tossed his head back as ten fingers slowly scratched at his sides, picking the soft spot between the hip and the last rib. It sent ticklish shivers all over his body, but he was too warm and comfortable to move away. “Youhuhu watch your mouthhahaha!” Tony retorted, his sleepy mind not giving him a better remark.
Tony had to admit that he was somehow impressed. Still...
"How come you can look but I can't?" Steve asked in a faked hurt voice and Tony laughed, closing the door.
"Who said you can go?!" a growl, a hand yanking on the back of his shirt and dragging him off behind the school building as soon as he stepped outside. The air was temporarily knocked out of Tony, when the neckline pinned into his throat, making him gasp and struggle. No one cared. No one noticed, everyone rushing to get home and forget about school until tomorrow.
Steve, holding the couch and grinning, had a very different opinion.
“Is — is she—”
sorry for the delay! was having some health problems, but I am slowly getting back to myself. not to brag, but from all the chapters I posted so far, this is my favorite! hope you will like it! comments are welcomed and needed.
"You will be fine. If I can survive this, so can you."
Tony turned to him, Bucky's too big shirt hanging on him. His face was cleaned with soap and water, but there was some redness left in his eyes, Tony could blame on the suds getting into his eyes, but Steve knew better. Tony shrugged, looking away. "For long."
Steve already felt in pain.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted, burying his heated face deeper into Steve’s neck. “Feels really good. Especially when you are the one ti - doing it.”
"It sure was," Steve agreed. The day was eventful, but he had a feeling that they found some good companions in the twins.
"There, this looks much better on you," Tony said, running the comb from Steve's forehead to the back of his head, lifting the hair at the top, instead of the usual sleek look. "Just a bit more gel," Tony turned around and took a jar with the sticky substance and rolled his eyes dramatically at Steve's pained grimace. "Just to keep it in place!" Tony promised, scooping out a small blob and rubbing it between his palms. Next, he gently coated the lifted top and shorter hair at the sides of Steve's head, creating a longer-lasting look. "There. Was it so bad?" Tony asked, leaning against Steve's back and looking pleased with the result.
Steve sighed dramatically, even if he expected such a turn of events, and changed direction, carrying Tony into the kitchen. Call it a weakness, but Steve couldn't deny his favorite belly and favorite person anything.
“Can’t help it,” Steve answered miserably, looking longingly at his wristwatch. Still, ten minutes remained. Why couldn’t time go faster?
"Tony, what is it?" Steve asked, sounding a little impatient.
Steve loved it. But somethings he loved more. Someone.
“Only when you have a smooth face. Like yours.”
"Eeep!" Peter squeaked when strong fingers dug into his sides and prodded into the skin. "Pops noohahahahaa!"
"How about we skip eating?"
Steve froze, his brain registering the words, breaking them apart and putting together again. Break in. Black pumps. Him.
Sarah seemed surprised, but smiled in the end, accepting the invitation. "I will just get us something to drink," she said, and Steve huffed a bit, wishing for his mom to finally sit down with him and rest. He kept his eyes fixed on his mom as she brewed tea for herself and poured a tall glass of lemonade for him, and Steve saw that there was something different about his mom, but he couldn't exactly point what. Chewing slowly on his food and savoring the taste, Steve kept thinking about what could have changed. His mom was always a beautiful woman, but she valued hard work over looks and as a nurse spent most of her days caring for others than for herself. Hair always tied in a low ponytail, almost no makeup, maybe for some people it was bland and boring, for Steve it was modest and natural. And now… Sarah's complexion seemed glowing, her pale skin having a healthy shine, hair seeming somehow thicker and brighter. When Sarah finally sat down across her son and smiled at him, Steve noticed that she was wearing mascara and had subtly contoured eyebrows, which gave definition to her whole face.
"Okay," Tony said after a while, his voice trembling with emotions, and the whole happiness Steve had experienced was gone, when he noticed that tears were building up in his boyfriend's eyes. "Thank you," Tony sniffled, overwhelmed with the amount of love he was receiving from practically a strange woman, while he never got even a fraction of that kind of support from his parents. Things would happen differently in his life if he would grow up with a parent similar to Sarah.
When Steve forced himself to end the screaming, he pressed a hand to his rapidly beating heart, chest having with every breath, eyes wide and darting from the contents of the bathtub to Tony, sitting calmly on the edge of the bathtub. Opposite to Steve, he was opened and relaxed and kept looking at his boyfriend with his head tilted to the side gently, both interested and amused at the way Steve flattened himself against the door in panic.
On his birthday, Steve had woken up exactly four times before leaving the bed. Which was rather unusual as on most of the days, he had a very regular sleeping pattern, but was a light sleeper, schooled to react to every sound, a skill he had acquired during his years as a soldier and which continued as an Avenger.
"Are you complaining?" Tony asked, pressing himself to his husband and grabbing by the collar, pulling him down. "Because if you are, I am not above spanking you to put you back in order, soldier," Tony purred out, their lips brushing together.
“Fish,” Tony confirmed with a grin. “It means that I try to look as much as I can as an authentic woman,” Steve nodded, experiencing that first-hand, “it is kinda weird, seeing that my mother was a camp queen.”
Tony and Steve exchanged surprised looks, before smiling at each other in relief. Thanks to Figaro, the rest of the night would be calm.
This wasn't right. It was illegal. Outrageous. The biggest offense ever.
"You are welcomed to, if you want to," Tony shrugged, "just a fair warning, we will probably put you into a dress and makeup-"
Every cat owner had experienced that, right?
"Dear, please," Sarah said in a petulant voice and Steve swallowed his food properly, before speaking again.
“I didn’t want to lose you,” Tony admitted, sobs breaking his voice, “you were so secretive around your mom and then when I met with her, she was so kind and - and I guess I didn’t want to lose her either.”
His heart was telling him one thing, while his mind was telling him something entirely different. It was a struggle to separate the voices and try to tell dreams and reality apart.
“Hey,” Arrow turned her blue eyes to Sam, deciding to jump on the torment Sam wagon. “Aren’t you the one working at Mama’s Little Bakery in downtown? The one with pink and frilly curtains in the windows?”
Steve would laugh at that if it wasn't all commercial and meant for sale on a global scale.
"I didn't, my mom did," Steve explained with a shrug, but Tootsie didn't even listen to him, just ranted away.
“God, I am so sorry,” Steve said, and much to Tony’s surprise pulled him over and held close. “For worrying you,” he pressed his lips to brunet’s temple, lingering them there for a second.
"Oh, he is
Sam shrugged, "I start baking at 5 am. There was no point."
"With you? Never," Steve leaned down, placing a slow, almost biting kiss on his lover's lips, Tony was happy to receive and take part in. "This will keep me entertained."
"Outrageous," Tony scoffed, his eyes fixed at the same point as Steve's. Steve didn't say anything, just kept smiling, his arm wrapped around his sulking husband as they sat together on the couch in the living room, basking in the love-filled glow.
“Woah,” Steve gaped, taking in what he was seeing. He quickly scrolled up, his face becoming heated, unsure what he just saw. For a minute, he turned the tablet in his hands, trying to decide if it really belonged to Tony and not someone else, but who else would have a hot red and gold cover, resembling the design of the Iron Man suit. It had to be Tony’s tablet, which meant…
Reality hit him hard hours later, while he stood at the gate leading to a cemetery. After a sweet morning and pancakes for breakfast at Tony’s favorite diner, he didn’t expect their route to lead them here. Tony trotted back to him, holding a bouquet of sweet smelling white gardenias and a plastic bag with two grave candles. Steve took the bag and they entered the cemetery grounds, Tony leading the way.
"I guess you were right, I like doing that," Steve replied sounding proud, resuming walking and leaving Tony alone. For now.
"Ah, Steve, wait!"
“Gay radar,” Red Velvet added, unlocking the door, “we all have it here. Sorry, Arrow, I really have to get ready. And you should too! Your stubble is growing back!” she teased, pointing to the area around her mouth.
“Yeah?” Tony stopped and turned around.
“A makeup artist? I didn’t wear any makeup in a long time,” Sarah admitted.
"Fig, look!"
"Not that."
“A makeup artist,” Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn’t really a lie. “Steve helps me to restock,” Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.
“Ma, what are you doing here?” Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn’t belong here, while his mom did.
Even the outrageous amount of makeup couldn’t hide the pink blush on Red Velvet’s face and Steve smiled moving back and giving his lady — his man — some space to get undressed and ready to go.
"OOF! Steve, what the-!" Tony demanded explanations, his whole face heated from the stopped attack and too much laughter. Peter heard his parents talking, hearing the phrases 'one hundred years old' and 'a pile of bones' repeated when Tony sucked in an outraged breath and looked at Peter with faked anger. "You killed your father!"
Steve blushed, hoping that it wasn’t too obvious in the dim light of the bar. “That’s different,” he said weakly, fidgeting in his seat. It really was different.
"Kissing," Tony finally choked out, his face becoming pinkish. "Kissing in public."
"That was a disaster."
"Oh, really?" Tony grinned, all teeth and sass, pressing their chests together.
“What?” Tony also stopped, widening his eyes. “Not in the mood for sushi?”
Tony always prided himself on being Figaro's favorite and then everything changed, once that thing appeared in their lives.
(See the end of the chapter for
The girl eyed Steve, nicely contoured lips curling into a smile. “Oh, honey, she is here. She is just getting ready for the show.”
Steve smiled, wide and, finally he could admit that, in love. “The second date,” he corrected, kissing Red Velvet’s pale hand. “And dress or no dress, it is still you.”
"Don't make me wait for too long, mom gave us boxty dumplings and barmbrack, and you might not get any if you show up too late," Steve warned with a smile.
“She was always brutally honest towards me. When I was growing up my dad said to me ’they say sarcasm is a metric for potential, if that’s true, you’ll be a great man someday’, but she brought it a whole new level. She had a softer side too, but not many know about it. And had the biggest smile and the biggest fake eyelashes I ever saw. She taught me how to take care of wigs.”
"Hope you two will enjoy it," Sam said hurriedly, jumping to the huge deck oven and checking on the apple pies. The hot scent of baking apples and cinnamon drifted to Steve and it was heavenly. "If you want something to go, just tell Kamala, she will pack it for you!"
No, Steve would never think that. Tony was the great love of his life and Steve accepted him on every level.
"No, I didn't expect it! Yeah, a total surprise. What do you mean by about time?! Girl, you are older than I am and got married two years ago! By the way, my invitation still didn't arrive. I know, right? Damn post, always losing things..."
“Agent Coulson,” Tony nodded back.
"Thaaaaat - Loki ate Thor's sandwich again," Steve lied smoothly, and Tony laughed, buying it. It was a plausible scenario after all. Not having time to lose, Tony sat in front of his station and Steve took his place on the couch, his thoughts drifting away and distracting him from the current moment. The catalog with engagement rings was still opened in his phone and his and Tony's conversation, the one from before they had entered his mom's house, kept repeating itself in his mind. The words he had said came easy to him, rolling off his tongue smoothly, like if it was the most natural thing and something bound to happen, but just with Tony and no one else. He couldn't imagine wakening up and falling asleep next to anyone else than Tony. He wanted Tony's lips to be the last thing he tasted in the evening and the first one in the morning. Touch him, love him, kiss him. Only Tony. But was it the right decision? It was a huge step, they had a good thing going on, and a too soon proposal could ruin everything.
"I am Tony and that is Steve," he said, motioning to his boyfriend, and Steve nodded, brightening when he saw Pietro's shirt with a green and red printing on.
"You know I can buy another pack, right?" Tony asked, squinting eyes at Steve.
"Maybe his diaper is full?" Steve tried to help. Tony turned Peter around in his arms and did something most of parents preferred to avoid - he smelled the diaper. Just one of the many charming things almost every parent did but, but didn't brag about - like eating food that fell out of your baby's mouth and was half-chewed. Still, the sniff test was the quickest way to tell.
Steve let out a long, tired breath, enjoying the silence. Parenthood was hard, but the sight of Tony and his son together was the most beautiful reward. It was all worth for such sweet moments.
"You will get more of this later," Steve promised, leaving a last kiss under the belly button and standing up. Tony wobbled when the hold on his legs was gone, but he quickly regained his balance when for a change, Steve framed his face.
“I don’t go in drag during the daytime,” Tony continued, and Steve noticed he lowered his voice a bit, “I don’t think I am ready for that yet.”
“Ahhahaha!”
Steve looked at Tony, not understanding at first. Oh, right. Tony didn't kick him out. It was Steve who decided that it all was too much and had stormed out, anger dictating his moves and he needed to get away before things could escalate.
"Guys day out?" she repeated, sounding amused. "Will we go to a strip club? Poker night and cigars? That stuff?"
"Hey hey hey!" Steve bit his tongue, a small laugh escaping. He tilted his head away, trying to get out of the reach of Tony's fingers. "Stop it!"
"I am kinda full, but - oh," Tony grinned, understanding the hidden meaning behind the words. "Aren't you a smart cookie," Tony cooed, flicking Steve under his chin softly, "I would love to, but I have to go to work."
"Ma… Please, sit down."
And today wasn't the day either.
Steve's face dropped a bit. That sounded serious and Tony was oddly calm.
"Wow, that's it?" Tony snarked, getting some of his breath back, looking scoldingly at Steve's grinning face, "that's all I get?"
"I know, silly!" Sarah laughed, turning around and walking to the kitchen. "Now hurry up, or dinner will get cold!"
Steve laughed and rolled on his side, looking at Tony with adoration. Laughing made Tony ten times more attractive in Steve’s eyes, and Tony was off the scale to start with.
Drag queens?
"I know," Tony sighed, not sounding too convinced.
"Uh. Yeah, sure!" Tony called back, his voice sounding a bit amused that Steve even had to ask about that. Well, maybe using the bathroom in front of your partner was just another step in becoming a couple. They bathed together, slept together, Steve even sometimes partook in Tony's home spa rituals, it wasn't like either of them would see something new.
"Excuse me, coming through, EXCUSE ME!"
“HIHIHIHI!” Tony erupted into high pitched laughter, legs kicking helplessly as Steve’s lips rediscovered every inch of ticklish, soft skin. It wasn’t fair how much it tickled and how good it felt at the same time. “Nohohoho, stahahap!”
A harsh voice cut through the cheer and Red almost fell off the stage in shock when another limelight fell on the newcomer. The club exploded with a new level of cheer when people realized who just entered the club. A black sequin dress, a big updo of red, curly hair with straight bangs and black hairband. Big eyelashes, big red lips, and dimples on each cheek.
“Oh fuhahahck - ” Tony wriggled uselessly, his stomach sinking in when Steve gently ran fingertips over the soft skin. “Steve, Steve, pleaheehehehese!”
"Just one bite," Steve asked. He hated that she was starving herself just to squeeze her waist more in the cincher.
"Got you, you little bastard."
"I am not," Steve replied, chuckling a bit and moving the kisses higher.
"Take it," Tiberius barked, handing Tony's book to one of his henchmen. Justin Hammer, seemingly Tiberius best friend, also rich, also handsome, but not as openly cruel as Tiberius, as he was more of a plotting type, took the books, his face showing how much he didn't want to, but wouldn't want to get on Stone's bad side. Without a word, he handed the books to the third person in their group, Aldrich Killian, a guy in big glasses and with weirdly curling hair that used to follow Stone and Hammer like a puppy. He was content with the role of a footrest as long as he could be in the presence of stronger people.
It wasn’t supposed to happen. Not like this. Maybe it was never supposed to happen, staying as his hidden fantasy and dark secret. What if he deleted the account, right here, right now, would he be able to convince Steve that it never existed?
An unknown man and a woman approached the table, their arms hooked together.
Steve didn't answer at first, the edge of the bowl pressed to his lips as he slurped out the sweetened milk. When he looked at Tony, he had milk mustache on his upper lip and smiled teasingly. "Oh? So you will talk about me behind my back?"
“Oh, interesting!” Steve suddenly said, ending the kiss too soon and looking at one of the comments, smiling wickedly.
"What's that?" Natasha asked, looking at the piece of jewelry and Steve held his breath.
"Really," Steve nodded, feeling Tony's heat and getting weak in the knees. It was unfair how gorgeous Tony could look in any circumstances. He leaned down to a kiss and-
Steve was sitting with opened, alert eyes. He was trying to calm down his pounding heart and pull himself together, but his body didn’t listen. As sad as it sounded, Steve was slowly getting used to living in stress. It didn’t mean, that he was any better at controlling and dealing with it.
"Rose water and white chocolate cookies," Kamala smiled proudly. Although the bakery specialized in homemade, traditional pastries, the newly hired young personnel was welcomed to experiment. "Teddy came up with that."
"No, sir," Steve denied with a smile, moving his face to match Tony's, lips getting closer and closer. "And I gotta say, you clean up rather nicely," Steve said, meaning that it has been a while since Tony wore a suit, not for a formal event, not for a public speaking, but just for his husband.
“Ma, Tony is—” and Steve’s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve’s mind whirred in panic.
"It was a horror movie and you snored! I had to elbow you like five times."
"You can't let that keep happening! One day, they will really hurt you and-"
"Ma! It's me! I brought a guest!"
No. Steve wouldn’t fall for it. And Tony felt so stupid for creating that account in the first place, but he needed a place to vent. He didn’t plan on socializing, sharing his life, just get the urges out and move on. He just… Wanted to feel accepted. Find people who thought the same as he did. Not feel so alone.
“Are you ready for this?”
"I can't… Gah… I can't anymore..."
"Nachos do sound better than hot dogs," Tony said, narrowing his eyes at Steve, and Steve mirrored the look in reprimand. Nachos were no food for a basketball game.
"Oh," Tony said, the hold on Steve’s arms not so tight anymore.
"Um, pork?" Steve laughed, finding their seats and sitting down, Tony following.
Again, Tony and Steve sported two different kinds of attitudes. Steve, crossed arms, square jaw, eyes narrowed and reprimanding. Tony, hands on his knees and bent in half and wheezing in laughter.
"You know you love me," Tony said sounding too cheerful and spreading more of the sugar paste on Steve's broad back.
Steve felt guilty. Maybe he reacted too harshly. He looked at the mirror, trying to imagine himself with long hair and makeup. "Would I have to wax my body?"
“You know what?” Sam started, no hostility in his voice. “I will go talk to Tootsie, if you go talk to your girl.”
Oh, how very wrong Steve was.
It was almost frightening how quickly all those feelings grew in him, almost rapidly, without any control. That was just such a Steve thing to do, to jump forward into his feelings, to let them succumb him entirely. It was exactly the same when he had seen Red Velvet for the first time on the stage, falling hard for her, and with time falling even harder for the man who brought Red Velvet to life. It was haste, poorly thought out decision to ask Red Velvet to met with him, and only good things came out of it in the end, but what if he already used up the amount of good luck in his life? What if, from this moment, everything would just go downhill? He was lucky, very lucky and had great people around him, and maybe it was the moment to slow down and enjoy what he had, instead of cutting off bigger and bigger slices of the cake life handed to him.
Tony’s mouth twisted again into a crying scowl. “I am sorry, I should have told you earlier,” Tony dropped his head, feeling crushed. He knew that Steve could figure out what he had meant.
Steve watched Tony closely. The way his shoulders trembled, droplets of sweat appeared on his face, his eyebrows and lips twitching with every well measured touch. Steve took his time, exploring every inch of sensitive skin, finding what worked the best, and focusing on that, enjoying every emotion showing on his husband's face. At some point, Tony couldn't stay upright anymore and bend in, digging both hands into Steve's sides, just having to hold to something, and obediently, not letting out a full-formed moan. Just those small, wonderful whimpers, trying to make their way out of the pressed together lips. Steve was mesmerized, never knowing how tempting he could find the image of Tony trying to keep it quiet be.
“Steve… did you tell her that-?”
Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.
"Come on, I will clean you up," Red Velvet said, taking Steve's hand and guiding him to the vanity station. She sat Steve down and took a fresh cotton pad, pouring the same liquid she had used earlier on the pad, and gently rubbing Steve's face all over with it. Steve closed his eyes and enjoyed the touch. He was getting used to all those cosmetic stuff.
song lyrics - Your Move from The Futurist by Robert Downey Jr
This situation was more complicated. What was worse, there was no simple solution. No amount of training could prepare him for this.
It wasn’t.
The silver curtain was pushed open and Red Velvet walked on the stage in a round of applause and almost a collective gasp echoed through the audience. There was no doubt, that the woman on stage was Red Velvet, even if at first glance she didn't look like it. The dress she chose was simple in cut, long and draping over the floor, with subtly widening sleeves covering wrists and a jewel neckline, hiding collarbones, almost not showing any skin. It was tight, accentuating the perky butt and round hips and a lovely hourglass figure. The most surprising was the choice of the material - it wasn't red, but all gold and shimmering, a little bit crinkling and catching light from every angle. Red Velvet looked as if someone poured gold over her body and let the precious metal set, shaping a dress over her. Such rich dress didn't require any fancy hairstyle and her black hair was combed neatly to the back and forming a low bun. Red smiled, light falling on her radiant face and glossy, red lips.
Steve laughed. He would love to spend the rest of the day with Tony, but he understood that as a co-owner of the company, Tony had to be flexible. "Okay. Will I see you later today?"
Steve scrolled down this page, seeing more text and images of people being tickled, some like, a gif that was of a zoomed in stomach, the belly button tickled by a tip of the feather, signed with a ’
"I shouldn't have any allergies. I remember having allergies, but it all stopped since I took the serum and - " Steve rambled, spiraling into something bad. If his allergies came back, who knew what would come next. And when. And that really scared him.
Steve smiled contentedly, sipping his orange juice slowly. His plate was pushed aside, his stomach full, but seemed that Tony planned to eat his weight in food. And maybe even Steve's weight.
“Yeah, yeah…” Steve griped, although it did feel kinda nice. Cooling. And the smell was nice too.
"It… It is not my thing!" Steve said clumsily, and Red narrowed her eyes.
Steve stared in shock. Tony felt like crawling under the table.
"Wait, what do you want me to do?!" Tony asked, stumbling after Bucky.
“What’s that?” Steve asked, genuinely curious for a change.
“Good,” Steve smiled, and just now Tony realized that somehow both of his wrists were in soldier’s hold and Steve easily pinned his hands above his head, leaving his torso exposed. “Because now,” Steve said, sitting on Tony’s thighs and slowly sliding his free hand under Tony’s shirt. “I want to test every ticklish spot on you.”
Steve felt like falling off the couch in shock, and by Tony's face, he knew his boyfriend thought the same. The long look Sarah gave Steve became clear now - not even knowing the meaning behind the word, Sarah had to make sure that whatever the words meant, Steve was okay with it, and when she saw that Steve was, she had accepted Tony too. Steve always knew that his mom was a special woman and she was just proving it to him every day. Smiling, Steve took out his phone and selected the photo album titled 'The Pitted Olive' planning to introduce his mom to Miss Red Velvet.
"We will use adult diapers," Steve grinned.
“Come on, it is just the two of us. I won’t tell anyone.”
ta-dam, the big reveal of Tony's drag mom! also, some more of my fav drag queens got a shout-out. Sam's drag name was created by roshytsunami.tumblr.com, thank you for following this story! and thank you,
“Oh, it is okay.”
"Maybe, but it isn't our concern. And from what I heard, Stark is no saint either. They deserve each other," Bucky said, closing his locker.
Just then Steve realized that there were some tears forming in his eyes. He came to terms with not seeing Bucky ever again and meeting him after all those years was an emotional experience.
“Really? You are the one to give me that kind of talk?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrows.
“Actually, it was a bet,” Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. “My friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,” he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony’s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. “Seat belts,” Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.
Taking a step back, Tony let Coulson walk in and set the pizza down on one of the work tables. So many questions and Tony couldn’t ask them. What was more, instead of leaving already, Coulson stopped at the table and looked at Tony, still smiling in a weird manner, looking oddly proud.
Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women’s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.
"So, let me put it straight," Steve started sipping his beer when the party started for good.
“It was lovely seeing you both,” Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.
The place was getting crowded and more lively, as more drag queens started to appear. Tony's friend showed up next, boy name Bruce, drag queen name Lady Mint, who worked downtown and was a type of drag queen Tony referred to as a comedy queen, meaning exaggerated makeup and a witty, observant sense of humor. Bruce as a person seemed like a nice guy, a bit distant and in his own world, but Steve could picture that drag brought out a new side in him. Arrow showed fashionably late, carrying a stack of fashion magazines and fabric samples, the most invested into the costume design world of all queens.
“Orange?” Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? “You really like to attract attention,” he chuckled.
"Please take a seat," the bouncer asked, moving the chair for her at the table in the front, near the stage Sarah just noticed. "If you allow me, I will take your coat."
Oh, low blow.
“Actually, it is better to store your wigs like that. I just put some balled up tissue paper inside to keep the shape and put a hair net around the wig. It keeps it from tangling and keeps the dust away.”
"And?! Do you think I care?"
"Oh my gosh, dear, come here," Sarah said, reaching her hands to Tony and cradling him to her chest, noticing how very distressed he became. She brushed her hand over Tony's hair, soothing him and Tony accepted the hug, even closed his eyes, savoring the moment. It has been a long time since the last time he had received a hug like that, not by a friend, not by a lover, but by a parent. Tony could feel the unconditional love Sarah had for Steve and it felt like she was building the same feeling towards him.
“Pathetic,” Sam remarked, shaking his head at his friend’s behavior. He knew Steve since forever and knew that the blond was usually better in control of his emotions. Just this place had such weird effect on him.
"But," the teenager hesitated, looking from the chopper to the blue Mazda RX-8, "I have to finish here first!"
"I told my mom."
Steve smiled softly, watching his boyfriend curling into him, as they kept strolling down the street, closer and closer to his mom's place. On their way, they had already picked the earlier ordered pastries from Sam's bakery, including Tony's favorite eclairs with a chocolate glaze and a custard filling, and a bouquet of wildflowers, Tony insisted on getting for Sarah. It wouldn't feel right to come empty-handed for such an important meeting.
Third - Steve considered himself not an interesting person. He didn’t have Tony’s charisma, who, of course, had the biggest social media following ever, Thor’s flair, which made his Youtube channel where he tasted food sent to him from all over the world by his viewers a huge success or Clint’s humor, whose Internet activity limited to commenting on funny animal photos and home videos and people loved him. Even Bruce, seemingly even more awkward and distant when it came to dealing with a privacy-invading crowd, was doing great, kindling the interest of young kids in science with a series of easy to repeat experiments at home and railing about the importance of protecting and preserving the environment. Even Natasha didn’t have a problem, her social media accounts full of useful self-defense tips for everyone who needed to feel safer. Steve just couldn’t find anything in himself he would like to share with the world. He liked to keep his art private, his relationship private, and his whole life private.
"Get him good, honey!" Tony cheered, and turned to amused Ned and MJ, "so, anyone in the mood for pizza? Maybe we can watch some family videos if you are in the mood, Peter was the cutest chubby baby."
"Heeey, shhhhh, come to daddy," Steve rushed forward, taking the boy from Tony and bouncing in his arms. Fed, diaper clean. Steve checked for fever, but except the heated cheeks from crying, their baby looked perfectly healthy. Peter sniffled some more, wailing in Steve's arms for a change, clearly unhappy. "Maybe he's sleepy," Steve said, feeling that his mind was slowing down because of the late hour.
“Sure. I would love to,” Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.
“Uhmmm. We can try. I just hope my bathtub won’t explode.”
“Beer, please,” Sam repeated, his voice getting some squeakiness.
"Tony... What's that?"
“Yup,” Steve smiled, pushing the straw out of his mouth. He really felt proud of himself.
"Ohh - ahh, Steve! Ah!"
"Hi! Welcome to
“Yeah,” Steve said, and they turned around and walked away, holding hands, the bond between them growing stronger and stronger.
Tony didn’t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn’t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.
"Hm?" Steve heard the sigh and briefly turned his head around, shining a grin at the teenager. "Hi, son!" He said, still climbing on Tony and causing Iron Man to squawk and giggle.
The rest of the evening was relatively calm. Peter changed into his normal clothes and came back just in time when the pizza arrived, and Tony trusted the teenagers to chose a good horror movie and later he had to admit, that it was quite decent. Maybe it wasn't the date night Tony and Steve had in mind, neither the Halloween party Peter wanted, but spending time together like that was nice too.
“Can you give me my wig? The middle box, please!”
"Oh, not only for that," Steve said in a low murmur and Tony squeaked when Steve slid his hand lower and squeezed Tony's butt, digging all fingers in. "And after you eat and rest, I will give you and your whole body all the attention it deserves."
"I need you out of the house."
“And for you, sugar?”
Steve stopped. Still holding Tony, he reached down for brunet's hand and put it to his mouth, kissing the knuckles. Chaste and sweet. "Milady."
“You already know where I am the most ticklish,” Steve reminded with a smile, thinking that maybe being sleepy made Tony not remember information as quickly as when fully awake.
“Why are we entering from the back?” he asked, puzzled after Tony had led him into the alley behind the club and used the door near the dumpster.
"Well, since you asked."
"Yes?" Sarah turned in the direction of the voice, getting startled when met eye to eye with the muscled, grim looking bouncer. She had to raise some suspicion by lurking around the entrance to the bar, but then she realized that the bouncer knew her name. When the bouncer smiled, his face changed from intimidating to kinder one, showing that he had a gentle heart.
"You expect me to get full on hotdogs?" Tony asked, eyeing the food with a grimace. "You don't even know what they are made from!"
"Shh, Tony, I am having a moment here," Steve shushed his boyfriend, focusing on the mentioned boyfriend's belly instead. Tony snorted, knowing that Steve had a thing for his stomach and allowing the situation to develop, curious where it would lead them.
okay, this part was the most difficult to write so far… with all the steps of getting into drag, I watched and read a lot to make it as accurate as possible, hope it is believable! how did you like the big reveal of Arrow's identity? did anyone guess who Arrow is? more Marvel characters will appear with time!
"No, thanks, babe," Steve smiled back, taking his glass and chasing with a paper straw the last drops of the juice. Tony walked away, happy that at least the hotel was up to date with their environmental policy.
“This is great,” Steve kept laughing, tossing the box in the air, before catching it. “Amazing.”
Second - he didn’t have time to keep his theoretical accounts active and post new content regularly. Or more, he didn’t want to make time, preferring to spend it on reading or training or hanging out with Tony or anything else, really. He had been gently suggested, that some celebrities (Steve’s eyes widened a little after hearing that - was he a celebrity?) hire someone else to run their social media accounts. Steve shook his head at the proposition, knowing that none of his teammates did that and so he shouldn’t either, not mentioning that everything posted wouldn’t be sincere.
"I AM CHANGING IN HERE!"
"You think you can be a better Captain America than I am?" Steve asked, some growl making its way in his voice. Just there was no real anger in it. More like some playfulness mixed with a challenge.
"You love me only for my stomach, isn't it?" Tony asked, half-joking, half-serious.
"Yeah," Tony laughed cheerfully, "I have been catching up on movies between appointments."
"Oh, he is? That's wonderful! You never tell me anything, Steve!"
Bucky opened his mouth to snark back, but zipped it, looking at all the freshly baked bread and rolls. Well, he would be a fool to get himself kicked out from bread heaven...
Steve watched carefully as Tony slowly walked the short distance to the bed, putting his feet apart to better handle the additional weight. He was in a bathrobe, the material not covering his pregnant belly and leaving it in the open and in underwear that hung incredibly low on his hips to not obscure the baby bump. Face saying relief, Tony sat on the bed, and Steve lifted himself to help him take the bathrobe off and put it aside. Tony smiled at the gesture and reached his hand for the cold water, the ice cubes clinking in the glass with a crisp sound and took a few cautious sips. When his thirst was gone, Tony lowered himself into the bed, finding his groove and his eyes slid close. He breathed out softly and his facial features smoothened in relaxation. Finally in bed.
Maybe he should just wait outside. Seemed like a good idea.
Maybe the day wasn't what Tony wanted, but at least in the evening, he was getting his way.
Steve was completely speechless. This wasn't like any version of Tony he knew. Red Velvet was poised, with perfect posture and perfect makeup. His Tony was always in ironed out clothes, with socks matching his shoes and the newest model of sunglasses on the top of perfectly stylized hair. This Tony… He wore a typical blue mechanic coverall, with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. There were some smudges of car grease on his hands and face. He seemed heated up, and there was some sweat on his forehead, strands of curly hair falling on his nape and forehead, the coverall hugging his body-
The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony’s offer completely.
“They also sell alcohol.”
“Sure,” Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. “Needs some honey,” he stated, finding it not enough sweet.
Tony didn’t reply, just stared, his brown eyes widening. Steve was… apologizing to him? Not the other way around?
"I'm thinking about it."
Tony nodded.
Tony and Peter seemed surprised when Steve spoke, almost as if they didn't notice that he was there. They probably didn't, engrossed in their own talks.
"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you - "
"Uh, sorry, no," Steve shivered again, quickly standing up. Tony looked puzzled after him. "I can't be here while you are doing that," he apologized, voice wavering with panic as he pointed at the bathtub. "Just… no," Steve said breathlessly and walked out from the bathroom in a hurry. Before he closed the door behind himself, he heard Tony bursting into cheerful giggling, that he should find offensive, but he was too relieved with getting out alive. The longer Steve thought about it, the more convinced he became that long hair was overrated and that short wig, with curly, chin-length hair looked the sexiest on Red Velvet.
There was a new text post on his main, one he didn’t write.
"You know," Peter said loudly, crossing arms on his chest, "I wish you two would act your age."
Tony grinned, leaning his head over Steve's shoulder. "My knight in shining armor."
"Come here," Steve urged, calling the other man closer. With some effort, Tony climbed into the bed next to his husband and Steve put his arms around Tony's waist, pulling him close. He put his lips against brunet’s forehead, looking for traces of fever, but the skin wasn't hot. Just normal temperature. Still, Tony had this pained look on his face and gave off some miserable vibes.
"Hairnet or get out from my kitchen!" Sam ordered, slamming the pile of dough against the table to get more air bubbles inside.
Tony moved quietly, tiding around and brushing off the leaves from the headstone. He picked up a withered bouquet of brownish flowers from the center and put fresh ones in their place. What surprised Steve, was when Tony quickly looked around, left and right, and took a cigar from the inside of his coat and put underneath the flowers. Gifts for his parents.
"Uhmmm..." Steve sent as insecure look towards his boyfriend and Tony didn't move, but his jaws tightening nervously. Just when everything seemed to be going so smoothly, they had to meet another bump on the road. "Uhm, kindaaa," Steve said, trying to dance around the topic.
"I am glad they are not coming with us," Steve said in a grim voice, taking the towel off and twisting it.
"Okay, okay," Steve soothed, stretching the net over his head. "What are you doing?"
"Good luck!" Steve called after Red Velvet, knowing that she didn't need any, and would knock the audience out of their boots, just like always. And Steve wouldn't want to miss it, so he hurried to take his usual seat with the perfect view on his lady.
Steve sat comfortably on the couch, piling the pillows behind his back for double comfort and opened the book, eyes following the written words and he was falling deeper and deeper in the fictitious world of royal families, monsters roaming the world and a monster slayer. He didn't expect to enjoy this series, preferring something milder and with happier endings, but he couldn't draw himself away, muting his surroundings.
The conversation continued, drinks were served (Grasshopper for Lady Mint, Whisky Sour for Rhodey, and Sarah got talked into ordering Barbara, which was a mix of vodka, cacao liquor, cream and milk, the sweet flavor overpowering vodka and making the whole drink smoother and subtle on the tongue, and a refill of beer for Sam) as the club was slowly filling up with steady customers and newcomers. Sam and Rhodey found a common language, discussing the details of Rhodey's work and all the prime brands he got to tinker with, while Sarah and Lady Mint were chatting it up, just discussing everything, when it was interrupted by dimming lights and limelight pointed at the small stage.
Tony dug his heels into the floor, stopping them both. "I can't!" he yelled, his voice already trembling. He can't. No one can know.
"Oh ahahahaha stahaap!"
"He is in the back with Billy. Heard you placed a special order?"
song lyrics -
"No no no no no!"
“Of course that I am not breaking up with you,” Steve said suddenly, and Tony winced, not realizing he said it out loud. “Is that what you thought?” Steve asked, sounding shocked. Reluctantly, Tony nodded. Somehow he was used to being rejected and walking away from problems was one of the things he did and expected the same happen to him.
“Why not shave it off completely?” Steve asked, and the way Red Velvet turned around and glared at him, was equally scary and amusing.
Really, no one.
“It is okay, I like you,” he smiled. “Do you want to have a nickname? That will make it much easier for me to write when you are involved.”
"What do you mean?" Steve asked, not understanding what happened. He came into the bar just minutes ago and didn't have time to do anything yet, except maybe chatting to Thor at the front and sitting at his table.
"Are you avoiding me, Tony?"
After the performance, Red Velvet left the stage in a round of applause and Steve stood up, clapping for her too, causing her to smile. Usually, Red Velvet would step down the stage and mingle with the guests for a moment, but instead of doing that, they got back to her dressing room.
“You should write on your Tumblr.”
Tony’s shoulders shook with a laugh because it was one of the least sexy things said in the sexiest way. “You don’t like hot sauce. You say it burns your tongue.”
"We are. Thanks!" he smiled at the hot dog vendor taking a paper plate with four hot dogs on a big soda to share. He handed the hotdogs to Tony and took his hand, guiding him to their seats.
Steve pulled his eyebrows together, thinking that it all was a bit odd because taking the night robe meant that Tony wasn't sneaking off to his workshop, he didn't go to the adjoined bathroom either and leaving the bed seemed a bit random.
“But are you okay?” Sam asked, sending a calculating look towards Steve. “Like, truly okay?”
It wasn't their couch's fault that he and Tony got in a massive argument over something stupid and Steve was banned to sleep in the living room. Steve just needed to take out his anger on something, and well, he had only the couch to do that.
Steve usually didn't need a lot of sleep. Five, six hours of rest were pretty standard for him and plenty to let him function through the whole day. Maybe it was that yesterday, he and Tony had decided to stay late at the Pitted Olive, prolonging their stay to see Tootsie's rock performance and Arrow's new juggling routine and he indulged more in the Long Island Ice tea than his body was used to, that the next morning it was exceptionally hard to get up from bed. He just wished to stay in, wrapped in warm covers and softness, and let his body decide when it wanted to wake up, instead of his always disciplined mind telling him that it was way past his usual sleep hours. He heard Tony woke up some time ago, but his boyfriend remained tactful and quiet and didn't want to disturb the blond, and moved swiftly and unnoticeable. Steve had moments of wakening up and nodding off, always feeling Tony's presence somewhere close, without being able to pinpoint exactly where he was, but it was enough to keep him calm and deep in sleep.
One day Steve would love to have a job he could be so passionate about as Sam was about his bakery. Working in an art shop had its pluses, like steady hours, steady pay, a lot of free time. Downsides were working with not always sure what they searched for customers and countless hours of rearranging misplaced art supplies. What Steve really wanted was to teach art. Somehow, he never had the courage to take that step. Maybe one day.
"Oh," Steve replied, staring owlishly at the other man. Was it about the kiss cam? "I am sorry, um, did - did it bother you?"
Steve didn’t say a word, feeling something clenching his chest. He pulled Tony closer to himself.
“That can’t be good for you, Tony.”
"Oh, oh yeah, give it to me, come on - AAAAH!"
Steve nodded because it did sound reasonable. Then the quote seemed oddly familiar… "Wait, isn't that from
"Pete! Get hihihihim off!" Tony squeaked, trapped under his husband and uselessly trying to bat away the attacking hands.
"I don't see why I can't have all of this with you," Steve said cheerfully. He felt Tony hiding back into his arm, solely to prevent Steve from seeing the spreading blush on his face, Steve couldn't see anyway, but felt the heat radiating from his boyfriend's face.
"The last one," Steve negotiated, pulling Tony closer and wrapping hands possessively around his lover, "and then I want you all to myself," he said, obscenely groping Tony's round butt, just to make a point.
Tony hissed in slight pain but grinned in the end. Steve used to freely express his love for Tony's bubble butt and that always made Tony feel good.
Tony was quick to asses the situation. He saw the family resemblance and put on a charming smile.
Steve pecked Tony's lips once more and moved away, slightly opening the door leading to the changing room and peaking his head in. "Hey, so -"
Steve was grinning, watching Tony crumbling and laughing, coming apart under his fingers. Steve was right, it was a win-win for both of them.
It was somehow hilarious, that both Steve and Tony had to try very hard to convince Sarah that the woman in the photo and the man sitting on the couch next to her are the same person. At least three times, Tony had to explain the whole getting into drag process (sparing the gruesome details, like covering up eyebrows and tucking in) and Sarah listened with sparkling eyes, at awe of Tony's skills. After hearing that he performed as a singer and wrote his own songs, Sarah became full of hope to hear Tony sing, who suddenly became bashful, claiming that he sings only in drag, which made Steve laugh because he heard Tony sing multiple times under the shower. After a lot of requests and encouraging applaud, Tony sang some lyrics in front of his boyfriend and his mother, much to Sarah's delight and Steve's happiness.
"I don't know," Steve said mysteriously, "but you look nice. Is there a reason you got all dolled up?" he asked playfully.
"It is good to see you, Sam," Sarah smiled, feeling at ease after meeting someone familiar. "How is your bakery doing?"
“What?” Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.
The interview started a bit stiff, but it was all on Steve’s part, who couldn’t shake off his nervousness. Tony was open and relaxed, answering the questions the best he could, why still keeping some mystery aura around himself. Steve found out, that Tony’s love for drag came out from love for fashion and makeup and how it was considered a forbidden fruit in the environment he was growing up, with a strict father and a loving mother. His father planted in Tony a love for engineering and cars and machines, while he used his mother’s vast wardrobe and makeup supplies, and the first time he tried on high heels was a magical experience, even if a second later he face planted into the floor as he had tripped himself over. It was tough to find a balance between his male and female side. He never came out to his parents and then, when he turned twenty, he was deprived of the occasion by a careless driver and a head-on collision with his parents’ car, left with regret and unknown. And then he found a new family. A family that supported him, taught him tricks of the trade and polished his makeup skills and sense of taste, and out of it all, a new person was born, the part Tony tried to suppress for years. Red Velvet came into existence.
“Did you like my new song?” Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve’s. “Wrote it for you,” he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.
Red shrugged, standing up and going to her vanity station. "He has some… weird vibe around him. Like if being an owner of a bakery is something he doesn't want to do."
“Tony!”
Steve’s eyes widened. “Oh my God, you didn’t eat for the whole day!” he gasped out, sounding distressed by the discovery.
alright, so we are moving forward! promise next chapter will be sooner. hope you will like this chapter, if you do, remember to leave kudos and comments :D!
It all started with a certain PR meeting held for the Avengers team, just this time, it was Steve vs the whole PR team. The problem was simple - Steve didn’t like social media and didn’t have an account on any of the numerous websites and apps. Fighting with aliens, planning new missions, schooling SHIELD agents - those were the zones he felt comfortable in. Some thought that the hidden reason behind the hostility towards social media was, that Steve, born in the 1920s, had a problem with using modern technology. Some called it endearing, some pathetic, the truth was, that Steve fairly quickly mastered each piece of technology he was given, skillfully using any given device. After all, he wasn’t dense. Many apps were quite useful, some just plain entertaining, and it required a lot of navigating, but he managed to find some favorites. Just when it came to social media… Steve didn’t feel like sharing his private life with unknown faces. Call him old-fashioned, but he liked having direct contact with people and as much as he liked to take a stop during his random walks in the city to talk with people who called themselves his fans, it quickly became too overwhelming. He wasn’t good at such things and always thought he was too awkward and not what people expected. Steve didn’t like that kind of pressure and didn’t like the almost weekly notices from the PR team that he needed to make himself more ‘accessible’. By no means, he was expected to stop and talk to everyone who ever called him or share mission details with strangers, but he needed to create a more public persona for Captain America and Steve Rogers.
“Steve,” she huffed out in irritation, “that was the worst interview I ever took part in. It doesn’t take a genius to know that you faked it.”
“You are performing drag for how many years?” Steve asked, scribbling intensely in his sketchbook. His hand was starting to hurt, but it would look suspicious if he suddenly would stop making notes.
Suddenly, Peter took a lungful of air. Steve already panicked, knowing the drill - Peter would cry out, Figaro would get scared, angered, and sharp claws would meet with soft baby skin. Tony clutched to Steve's arm, fearing the same scenario to happen.
“Don’t even think about it, unless you brush your teeth,” Steve said, sounding serious.
“So… You are not disappointed in me?” he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren’t so hilarious.
"That's sweet of you. Are you ready for dessert? Made your favorite," Sarah smiled, standing up and heading to the counter.
"Yeah, because I showed you how!"
"Ahh... Ahhh..."
“And the other bodyguard?”
Red just smiled and sipped her sparkling wine, hearing the collective thought exchange about her boyfriend. Except for Bucky's half-hearted remarks, everything was positive.
“Sure,” Steve kept smiling because Tony looked so happy. It was somehow contagious.
(See the end of the chapter for
The apple pie had to wait.
Steve sat heavily on the couch, putting elbows on his knees and palms around his cheeks, definitely not pouting. Why on Earth did he need a Twitter account? Wasn’t it enough that from time to time he appeared on Tony’s account, being the supportive boyfriend, and allowing Tony share the photos of their date nights or even the short movies from Steve’s training when Tony was proudly showing off Steve’s impressive physique and using those damn filters and making small stars and glitter swirl around him.
“It is a filthy habit and I hope you know it.”
When Tiberius opened his eyes he saw two guys, people he didn't pay attention to earlier, but knew that attended the same school. They were juniors, like Tony, and members of the football team and if he wasn't wrong, the blond one was the captain. He noticed that Tony was free, on all fours in the mud, and escaping Killian. Coward. He would pay for this.
"You are the multitalented one," he pointed out to Arrow, meaning her talent for designing clothes and nearly circus acts on stage, and Arrow held her chin proudly, "you are the funny one," he turned to Lady Mint, "and you are the pretty one," Steve ended on Red and then turned to Tootsie. "And that makes you-?"
It was nice. Their bodies pressed together, moving in one rhythm. The wet sound and the heat. Very nice.
There was a loud, almost female sounding shriek.
“I am so glad everything is fine,” Tony sobbed out, drawing away and Steve cupped Tony’s face with both hands, brushing his tears away.
"Just... Go back to sleep. He needs more time."
Well, that killed the mood quickly.
"What if it is not one thing?" Steve asked in a sad whisper.
And that’s how he ended here. Waiting and growing more nervous. Red Velvet agreed to meet with him, but there was no guarantee that she would show up. He only hoped he didn’t appear creepy to her and she agreed just to get rid of him. That won’t make things awkward at all.
"My nights were so cold without you," Steve admitted to the belly, and Tony rolled his eyes playfully, knowing that Steve meant the evenings when Steve liked to lie sideways in bed and use his stomach as his special pillow. Truth to be told, Tony enjoyed those moments too. It was comforting and Tony was ready for that routine to resume. "Are you still in good shape?"
“And what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,” she said, pointing Steve’s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve’s brimming one. “Or not so little,” she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.
"Right," Tony said flatly.
“You are Steve Rogers, right?” the guy asked, growing weary of the silence. “Please don’t tell me I made a mistake and just grabbed a random stranger.”
Tickling him?
“Ummm,” Red Velvet fluttered her long eyelashes, looking away in embarrassment, one hand pressed to her mouth, the other to her stomach. “Sorry.”
Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn’t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.
"Scram!" another voice.
"Steve! I am back!"
"Go ahead," Tony invited, smiling back. Steve intended to, but… The evil grin disappeared and was replaced by a more and more confused look as he was examining Tony's face. Eyebrows in a neat shape, no strand hairs. Smooth cheeks, the goatee trimmed to a perfect length. In a desperate, completely dirty move, Steve even looked for nose hair, but those were also properly taken care of.
"Oh, thank you. You can call me Sarah by the way," Sarah said, smiling and addressing both Rhodey and Mint. "So, from where do you know Tony?" she asked, genuinely curious.
Tony didn’t realize he started to hyperventilate until Pepper’s voice brought him back. Everyone was staring at him and Tony felt like vomiting.
"You are not worthless, Tony," Steve quickly said, and hearing that Tony thought about himself like that, was already painful.
One - it was pretty tedious to keep up with everything. Tony eagerly showed him all social accounts he had - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook profile, Youtube, and it all just gave him a headache as Tony chattered which media was good for what and gladly showed him his own Instagram page (mostly workshop photos and meals Steve had prepared for him, which was kinda sweet) and if Steve became slightly interested in that, his interest dropped after hearing about filters and tags. Too much work.
"Ah, that's just what I needed," Steve said in a light tone, playfully wagging the straw at Tony.
With a snarl, Steve turned around, locking eyes with Peter and limping in his son's direction. "Braaaains..."
“Fine. Let’s be over with it.”
"POPS! STAHAHAHAP!" Peter tried to wriggle out, but he never before managed to escape Captain America's clutches and today wouldn't be the day either.
So far, there were two moments in Tony’s life when he completely broke. One when he was fourteen, second when he was twenty-one years old. The third moment came in his life when he was in his forties, cuddled in his boyfriend’s lap, feeling loved and accepted on every imaginable level. Steve was honored to share this moment and let his boyfriend cry and whispered soothing things, feeling that they both needed to run into a brick wall and that running together was easier than doing it alone.
Tony snorted, his shoulders jumping with the movement and belly twitching. "Don't cut yourself short," Tony joked, patting Steve's left peck, as he used the right one instead of a pillow. Steve should be offended, but he was used to Tony's jokes and Tony getting some of his snark back was a good sign, showing that he already felt better. "This is nicer," Tony added in a sweeter tone.
“HIHIHIHI!” Tony giggled loudly, fireworks exploding under his eyelids. The attack was short and sweet, and after a few more seconds, Steve moved away, letting his laughing boyfriend curl in a trembling, heavy breathing ball.
"I am gonna sit and drink."
Uh oh. Seemed that he wasn't as good at masking his laughter as he thought he was. Steve sighed, and sat up on the bed, invitingly patting the covers. "Hey, Fig! Figaro! Come here!" he tried to get his and Tony's cat's attention but without any results. Figures, Figaro was their cat, but he bonded strongly with Tony. Steve was more of a food dispenser, litter cleaner, and occasional heater. He had no authority when it came to Figaro and his moods. "Figgy, daddy will be out soon! Tony, tell him you will be out soon!"
Well, that wasn’t the slice of comfort, but he would take a slice of pizza anyway.
"I missed you so so much," Steve cooed, pressing his cheek into his boyfriend’s belly. "I prepared all delicious treats for you. Who knows what they were feeding you in that horrible hotel in France."
Yet, it all faded in the face of the feeling he was witnessing in the current moment. That was the kind of love that was hard to describe but obvious to everyone and so good. Steve loved Tony and was loved back, but this was an entirely different story.
“Captain Rogers sends his regards,” the agent continued, pointing Tony’s attention to a pizza box, one Tony didn’t notice before.
Steve planned to write back, but then he heard Red Velvet speaking a bit louder.
Tony’s smile grew together with the warm feeling inside him. No matter how busy Steve was, he always managed to find some time for him. Seeing that that was settled, Tony just sent a red heart emoji, receiving a blue one back, and put his phone away. There was this pain in his back, so he stretched, reaching his hands up, thinking that before Steve would show himself he should get some work done, before who knows when he would resume. Feeling a new boost of energy, Tony sat back at the workbench.
It took some more long minutes, but Red Velvet finally stepped out of the bathroom. And… wow.
"You know I will step on your feet, right?" Steve asked teasingly, accepting the hand, and stood up.
But why try to break something that went together hand in hand? He just had to say it. For his own sanity. It was hard, but he had to, to quiet his heart and mind.
"So, everyone suit up! We are leaving in 30 minutes!" Tony hollered, and for the first time in many weeks, the team looked lively, eagerly listening to the order. "By the way," Tony turned back to Steve, lowering his voice, "I put some extra time into your suit's design," Tony murmured and it would be sweet if he didn't add, "the neckline goes down to here," he said putting his finger against Steve's chest and sliding it down almost to the belly button.
"Not long," Tony grinned, "just a couple of months."
"Yeah, he went to the bathroom and to get us some snacks. This is basically the only reason I come here, to get nachos," she said with a disarming smile.
“You will be jealous once I grow a beard.”
“You didn’t use a breastplate,” Steve mentally facepalmed himself as soon as the words left his mouth. Despite not using fake bosom, Red Velvet still presented a pair of nice, round ones.
"Here's your drink."
The words immediately sent off warning signals in Steve's brain. He turned around, and watched Tony, marching into the living room at Avenger's shared floor, face set with a determined and sullen look. Steve feared it would happen and someone would break. His bet was on Thor, though, who since the coronavirus pandemics had started was strictly forbidden to leave the compound, because Thor might claim he was a god, but for most, he was an alien, and coronavirus was new and unknown as it was already, there was no need to mix alien DNA into it. Too much of a risk and Thor was cooped up, banned from leaving the compound, and instead spent his days grimly staring into the window, some sparks of electricity crackling around him from time to time.
“Oh, babe,” Steve said warmly, wrapping hands around his boyfriend and holding him close. He didn’t know much about Tony’s past and the life he had before he became Red Velvet, but something had to go wrong seeing how much he was emotionally involved. And Steve couldn’t be happier - he had a loving and caring boyfriend and an understanding and supportive mother. He feared so much he couldn’t have both and yet, it was happening.
"What's that?" Tony asked, unfamiliar with traditional Irish food.
song - Love Shack by The B-52's (who can guess why I chose this song :D?)
While Sarah was putting finishing touches on the mashed potatoes, Steve slowly finished a plate of tomato soup with noodles. His mom remembered that he wasn't a fan of the acidity in tomatoes and added a generous splash of sweet cream, making it smoother for the palate. With time, Steve's taste changed and he was better at handling more sour flavors, but still, the gesture was sweet and the soup tasted like his childhood. They didn't talk much, but the silence around them was so comforting and Steve just soaked in the serene atmosphere, feeling like a kid again.
"Hey, we just saved your ass, be a little grateful-" Bucky yelled back and Tony lifted his head up, his face set in anger and tears on his cheeks.
Ah, so it was about the kiss cam.
Tony smacked his lips and opened eyes when kisses were pressed along his jawline. Then down his neck, and there was small suction on that little spot near the base of his neck, the one when kissed always made him shudder in delight.
And Tony didn’t have to, because Steve knew the answer anyway, but he needed his own slice of comfort and he kept smiling beautifully as he watched Tony wriggle and laugh underneath him. And Tony, just like Steve, would deny his husband anything.
"Oh, you would like that, huh?" Steve teased, squeezing her shoulders playfully, meaning the cigars part. "You will see," he said mysteriously. Red took a moment to answer, before turning on the chair, facing Steve.
"I guess you were right, Steve," the brunet said, shaking his fist after the punch that would leave a nice black eye on Hammer's face.
"Is this about your job?"
"Cack attack means being nervous. You know I am half Irish, right?" Steve said in a light tone, taking his shoes off while trying not to jostle the bag with pastries.
"What the-?!" Tony jolted his head up, bleary eyes coming to focus. He looked around, slowly realizing that he was down in his workshop, a holographic screen in front of him and a ton of papers scattered all around. No immediate threat, just this throbbing pain in his forehead, when he had lost the fight against staying awake and slammed his head into the desk.
Steve's appearance was met with more applause as he entered the stage in his blue velvet jacket, smiling insecurely, but clearly happy. After having a final confirmation, Sarah sobbed into her hands from happiness, and Rhodey, Mint, and Sam stood up, joining the cheering for the just engaged couple. Steve walked to Red and put an arm around his lady, and they kissed briefly, Red cupping Steve's face tenderly. Usually, Tony had to stand on his tiptoes or pull Steve down into a kiss, but thanks to high heels, Steve had to tilt his head up just a bit, Red slightly higher than him.
And just like that it became loud and cheerful again, and Red was outvoted on if she would look good in an open leg dress, but she could definitely wear a body tight dress with a slit in the back going all the way down because her bubble butt was one of her greatest features.
"You mess with me, I mess with you," Tony growled playfully, hooking his fingers under Steve's knees and tickling the thin skin. When Steve burst into laughter and pushed his chair away, causing it to make an unpleasant, high pitched sound, everyone present looked at him, with more or less scolding looks. Steve felt his face heating up and apologized for the ruckus and sat down quietly. Soon the dining hall got back to its usual, quieter state, full of talks and clinks of utensils and no one paid attention to them anymore. And then Steve noticed Tony's smug face. His husband even had the nerve to blow a kiss his way, clearly to provoke him.
"What are you sorry for?" Sam snorted, and Bucky would do the same if he wasn't devouring the bun in greedy bites. "It is not every day when your best friend gets engaged, it is all good."
"WAAAH!"
“What’s that?” Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.
"Nah... I don't think so."
"No, they are not!" Sam called, his voice perfectly hearable from the changing room.
"And night. I don't think it is safe to go to the bedroom yet," Tony pointed out, not wanting to risk another attack.
Of course, they didn't stay in the bed forever but did have a lot more shared sweet moments both in bed and on the couch and wherever they found suitable.
"Aw, thanks, babe," Steve smiled and saw Tony sticking two straws in the milkshake. Wait, two?
“No,” came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet’s face.
Maybe except one thing.
Hearing the reassurance, Steve drifted back to sleep.
Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.
"Thank you," Steve smiled at the new girl as she put his drink on the table, and she smiled back at him, and Steve almost slid down from his seat in shock. He would recognize that teeth gap anywhere. "Oh my God, Sam?!" he shrilled out, trying to keep his voice low.
"Great," Tony scoffed, taking a towel to wipe himself dry. "No backless dresses for a while."
"We were just discussing our next meeting," Sarah explained to Steve, "some of my friends want to meet Tony and get beauty advice."
"I already found something suitable, I don't know if I am good enough," Steve admitted, holding Red around her hips. It was a cryptic message and he didn't want to give more than necessary. At least not yet.
“So, is this okay?” Steve asked, feeling a rush of hope.
"Sometimes I forget how freakishly strong you are..." Tony muttered angrily to himself, not directing the complaint to his husband, but Steve laughed anyway still hearing it because of his super-soldier hearing. Of course. "Put me down!"
Oh, Lord...
“Oh,” Steve said, nodding in understanding. “It is fine,” there wasn’t anything else he could say to that.
At first, Tony thought that Steve meant kissing. He would be very happy if Steve meant kissing. Instead, five fingers were running up and down his side in quick movements, digging in his soft skin.
Steve began to smile, finding this very endearing. He could feel that Tony's belly was a bit harder than usual, suggesting some discomfort, but soon it would relax, soothed by Steve's higher body temperature.
"It's embarrassing, okay?" Tootsie hissed. Steve didn't know if she meant Red's overly motherly behavior or the fact that his friends and coworkers knew that kid Tootsie used to have a bowl cut, just like half of the kids back in those times.
"You are not dead! Stop dramatizing!" Steve scoffed, looking at his boyfriend, and wiping some sweat covered strands out of his forehead. He looked just as bad as Tony did, but somehow it was a much more flattering look on him. Rugged and soldier-like.
Well… Tony wouldn’t mind if he took a peak, right? Granted, he never used Tony’s tablet before without his boyfriend’s permission. It felt too personal and barging on privacy and it was almost a silent agreement between them that Steve won’t touch Tony’s electronic devices and Tony won’t look through Steve’s sketchbooks without prior agreement. But it was different, right? Tony’s Twitter account was out there, for everyone, so it didn’t matter if Steve would install the app on his phone and check the account, or go to the source and look through Tony’s account. It might even help him to understand better how the app was working.
And the terrified look was back in Tony’s eyes. Steve shook his head.
Steve laughed at the word choice. "If it is that fabulous, maybe I will stay?"
“So?” Steve asked again, eyes sparkling, waiting for permission from his boyfriend.
"What - whyyy," Tony didn't understand, tears building up back in his eyes. "Hey, hey, look, there is still food," he tried to put the teat back into the boy's mouth, but Peter just looked more distressed and kept arching away.
"You won't find out until you try, honey," Red said, putting her hands on Steve's cheeks and urging him to eye contact. Together, they did many things none of them dared to do alone. Whatever Steve meant, it would be just another thing Tony would support him on and celebrate if succeeded or comfort if failed. "And If you fly or if you fall, least you can say you gave it all."
“Ladies and gentleman, may I have your attention please!” came a voice from the intercom and the lights dimmed slowly, leaving a spotlight on the stage. Steve whipped around to face the stage and finally bashed his knee, but he couldn’t care less about the pain, looking expectantly at the stage.
Steve took his phone from the coffee table and looked at the hour. It was well after midnight so he kept tossing on the couch for almost two hours. He stood up and patted the couch tenderly, apologizing quietly for the previous offense, and walked in the darkness in the direction of his and Tony's bedroom. Slowly, Steve opened the door, some soft light illuminating the room and in the middle of the bed, still awake, was Tony. After noticing Steve in the doorway, he sat up, the covers falling a little bit, showing his naked torso.
Steve shrugged with a boisterous smile. "There is not much to tell. Some kid pushed me and I fell into the dirt. When I turned around, Bucky was the first person I saw so I assumed he was the one who pushed me and I lounged myself at him. Bucky tried to shake me off, but I kept pummeling him so he started to hit me back, while all the other kids were cheering. Bucky gave me a black eye and I punched him in the jaw, busting his lip. When blood started to gush out, other kids got scared and scattered, and I and Bucky were the only ones left. I told Bucky to come with me because my mom is a nurse and she would fix it. Mom did patch us up but she also whooped our asses for fighting."
Steve heard Tony's voice, sounding a bit echoey, and looked around, not spotting his boyfriend anywhere. Only workers and the cars.
Steve looked with sad eyes at the dark-haired teen sobbing, his clothes getting soaked from the wet ground. It was a miserable picture. "Let's go," Steve decided, hooking his arms with Tony's and pulling him up on his feet. To his surprise, Tony didn't struggle, didn't say a word, just kept quietly crying, not having any strength left.
Tony sniffled, taking a moment to answer. He was taught to live in secret and hide who he was. Maybe he had his own unresolved coming out issues. And as much as he loved being with Steve and enjoyed his conversations with Sarah, bringing them together would lead to topics Tony was trying to avoid. He didn’t want to mess up Steve’s life, but he slowly realized that he was afraid of what Sarah would think of him. He already once disappointed one parental figure, he couldn’t do it for the second time. He was a coward.
"Okay, okay. Damn kids."
“I didn’t mean grocery shopping,” Tony said, clearing his plate and digging into the fruit salad. Steve even made some watermelon and melon balls. Adorable. “I need to replenish my supplies. For my night work.”
“Fine,” Tony agreed, rolling his eyes dramatically. He reblogged the post and added an update.
By Tony's smile, twitching and spreading and the happy sparkle in his eyes, Steve could say that Tony felt the same, pleased that his Valentine's surprise worked out so well. Every day, their bedroom presented quite simple, with crumpled sheets, lone clothes here and there, organized in a modern, minimalistic style and with few heartwarming accents like their wedding photo on the nightstand, or more humoristic ones, meaning the tie with a ducky pattern, looped over the wardrobe handle. This was like cupid decided to drop by, got drunk on Tony's scotch, and vomited everywhere.
"Wait, Sarah," Tony started, pausing when Sarah looked at him, giving him his full attention and that startled him a bit. There was no easy way to say it, and he just needed to get it out. "I am sorry. For misleading you," Tony said, his voice shaking a bit and shoulders sagging down. "And those are for you," he handed the bouquet, his voice flat, "thanks for… having me over."
"You need any help, ma?" Steve called after Sarah and took his shoes off, as the woman already moved back into the kitchen.
"It was just a milkshake, babe," Steve replied innocently. Maybe he wanted to mess with Tony a bit, but it didn't mean that he didn't appreciate what his husband had done.
"Friday, dim the lights, cue some music," he said, and when the first notes of a soothing melody started to seep in, the lights got softer, Tony stood up and spoke again, offering Steve a hand. "May I have this dance?"
"What?" Steve stopped, sounding a bit impatient. Tony grinned, hearing the hunger in his boyfriend's voice.
Running at Steve was pretty much like running into a brick wall. His pops was solid muscles, great for bear hugs, but Peter never saw anyone knocking his father down.
“Drag mother,” Tony’s smile dimmed into something warmer. “Man, she is terrible.”
"Yeah?!"
Tony considered that secret part of his boyfriend very, very hot.
“Good,” Steve yawned and retracted his hand. Before Tony could scoff out his protest at such brutal treatment, Steve hooked his hand around brunet’s nape and pulled him in for a closer hug. “Good morning,” he said and blinked his eyes open.
Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn’t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny…
"Shh," Steve soothed, leaning more on his husband's smaller frame, entering even deeper, feeling Tony tremble in pleasure. He pushed his hips forward, angling downwards and Tony jerked his head, screaming in delight.
Definitely knew the author. At the top of the post, he saw a name, probably the username and clicked on it. Blue background color, and image of feathers and the username in white bold font. The Spare Parts Man.
"What do you want me to do?!" Steve called back, hoping that his voice was steady and not giving away how much he was enjoying the situation.
“Red Velvet can attract — a varied type of crowd,” Loki said, looking back at Steve, sending him a warning.
"Where do you think you are going?" Steve yelled when Peter almost slipped away, but it wasn't that hard to pull him back and blow a raspberry on the nape. Peter basically fell back on the couch, not able to defend himself from tickling fingers, reacting the same way as Tony did to raspberries. They both didn't stand a chance against that form of tickling and turned pretty helpless.
"Oh, shuuut up…"
Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other’s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony’s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.
“Oh.”
"We will work on it," Steve said with a smile, still addressing Tony's stomach directly, watching his fingers pressing on the material, prodding the skin underneath, and watching it jump back. "I have some niiice chocolate brownies for you. And chocolate syrup. For later," Steve said in a low murmur, finding Tony's outie under the material and gliding his finger pad over the small nub, softly rubbing it.
“Then… can you tell me why you like it?” Steve tried, sounding gentle and not judgmental. Keeping an open mind was the key here.
"Now I know this!" Tony announced happily and Steve smiled back, hearing genuineness in the voice tone. Tony was recovering remarkably.
for inspiration! Steve's outfit is the outfit Chris Evans had on during Oscar Gala in 2019, if you are wondering.
“What? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,” Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.
"Sure. Thanks again, Sam!"
Steve creased his eyebrows in thought before his forehead smoothened again. "You mean paintball? It is fun if you have the right people around-"
“HA!” Steve laughed, maybe a bit too loud, but the sound got lost in the already getting crowded room, and Sam’s terrified look was just too priceless. Sam was someone Steve liked to call a closet baker, he could make the most amazing cakes, learning his whole life from his mom who was a master baker. It was obvious that one day he would take over the family business and continue to supply New York with delicious, homemade cupcakes and pastries.
"I only know that you have a great figure," Steve said in his defense and Red smiled.
Steve smiled back and pecked his boyfriend's lips briefly. "You know that this is not all that I planned for us, right?"
"What?" Tony suddenly asked, and Steve noticed that Figaro was sitting at the bottom of the couch, his tail doing some twitchy movements. Sometimes it did happen, that during his playtime, Figaro tossed the scrunchie somewhere and needed assistance in getting it out, which was the current case. "You flung it under the couch, get it out yourself," Tony told his cat, sounding offended.
"So, who is coming?" Steve asked, trying to keep his curiosity at minimum, and not be too noisy what exactly Tony would say about him.
