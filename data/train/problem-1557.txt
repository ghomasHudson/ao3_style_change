“Great. I’m considering banging you up against that wall so hard you won’t remember how to spell the word ‘physics.’”
The next thing he knew, Sherlock was on all fours, head pressed into his pillow, ass high in the air. The second thing he knew, John was yanking on Sherlock’s hips, and sliding home. The third thing he knew, someone was making a noise like a wounded bear. It may have been both of them.
Moringa ruffles her feathers and trills in dismissal. “Copulation, making love, you know what I mean! They were all over each other, they were ‒”
“You, my love, are a right mess. I think your face ate more of that ice cream than you did. Let's get a bath going for you, yeah?”
Then the knocking came, and then the knocking stopped, and then it was snowing in the house. He was sitting on the couch in the family room with his head between his knees and the sound of his rasping in his ears and he was staring at the floor and it was snowing, tiny bits of white fluttering around him and landing on and near his feet, blowing with the gusts from the open door.
John blinked a few times, turning in his seat to look squarely at Sherlock. “Well, I'm not sure. Why would you?”
"When the two little emperors learned what the tooth was, and who it had belonged to, they decided they had to get it back. They searched and they searched, and just when they thought it was too late and was lost to them forever, one of them found it. You will never guess where it was, not even if I give you each five guesses."
John was standing at the bulletin board when he returned, hands clasped behind his back, rocking back and forth on his heels. Sherlock could tell that he'd finger-combed his hair and straightened his shirt. John needn't have worried. He always looks right, because he always looks like John.
With a deep breath and quick glance down to make sure he was covered, Sherlock opened the bathroom door and strode across the room to the bed. John was sitting on the edge with a large box on his lap, digging his bare toes into the carpet. He had taken off his jacket and tie, too, and looked relaxed and content. He smiled at Sherlock and rolled his shoulders a few times before sighing.
The two of them stand and smile at each other, as besotted as they were eight summers earlier, and Sherlock lets the moment seep and settle into his very bones. This, he thinks to himself, is mythology made real. This is his life with John, more perfect than he ever could have imagined, and on the cusp of becoming something even better than perfect.
It is the most fleeting night of Sherlock’s life. He and John pass it together, with their backs to the eastern horizon. The sun will rise, and bring with it their separation, but they don’t have to watch for it, so they don’t.
“– you turned and put your drink down, like you were actually going to leave with him, all calm and understanding, and then
Sherlock closes his eyes and shakes his head. When he opens them, it is only to look down at his feet, unable to meet Mycroft’s eye. "All this time, while you have been alone, I have had John. From the time I was a hatchling, Mycroft. All this time. You and Anthea—"
“I would not risk the integrity of Tui's leg, even after all this time. And we do not know if her injuries affected her ability to make eggs. I would not want to put all of us though that, not if …” John trails off, not needing to finish his sentence.
There is much eye-blinking from the council, except for Mycroft, who is rolling his eyes so hard Sherlock hopes he'll strain his face. After some shuffling and throat clearing, Vela opens and closes her bill a few times, and then says, “Is that you, young Sherlock? Perhaps this is the type of question you’d rather ask your mother, later?”
Outside, they stood on the corner at the heart of Chicago’s retail shopping district and took a look around.
They stand quietly and observe the comings and goings of the colony. After a moment, Mycroft asks, “Forgive me if it is too personal a question, but do you think you and John will adopt?”
John scowls at his shoes until Sherlock is wading into the sea, one long stride after another, then mutters, "All right, then." He dumps his clothes in a pile near Sherlock's and jogs down to the water's edge, his cock slapping against his thighs, his belly. The water is cold, and he has no idea where Sherlock went. He dives below the surface, comes up gasping.
“Letting me do what I want.” John licked up Sherlock’s cleft. “Not rushing me.” He spread Sherlock apart and blew warm breath down low. “Staying still.”
"Yeah, well, he's pretty spectacular himself, ma'am. Do you mind if Sherlock and I go stand a little closer? We wouldn't want to miss a single word of Councilpeng Mycroft's speech."
They wove their way through the crowds of people meandering in various directions, the hordes thinning out as they got closer to the gallery John wanted to see. Sherlock took in the centuries-old tapestries, screens, caskets, and busts around them, but John pushed through to the last room, tugging Sherlock along with him.
Sherlock walked and sniffed and squeezed his hands into fists in his pockets, and when he hit the dead end at Commonwealth Avenue he took a guess and headed south. Commonwealth led to Diversey and Diversey took him into Lincoln Park. Diversey Harbor stretched out in front of him, a narrow length of silver and gray ice scored by a dozen or so empty docks, each slip yawning over the frozen surface.
Sherlock turns back to the kitchen to fetch the kettle and teabags. He doesn’t want to be interrupted once they start. Whatever this is, it has left bags under John’s eyes, and lines carved on the sides of his mouth. John’s mouth.
John moved with him, hips rocking, thighs flexing. Sherlock watched the way John threw his head back, eyes half-closed, lips parted. There was a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and a flush on his cheeks.
“Well, that's very interesting, isn't it? Let's not mention it to Granddad just now, all right? I bet your mama wants to keep it all a secret until everything is arranged.” Imi nods, distracted, and runs off ahead of him with her slightly mangled bouquet of flowers in her hand.
Vela points toward the back of the crowd, and a hesitant voice asks what a penguin should do if no one answers their mating call.
Half a dozen tugs later, Sherlock was chanting a string of yeses, each one longer and higher than the last, until he was silently screaming through his climax.
Mycroft interrupts his thoughts when he addresses the colony again. “The heartstone. Or is it? The stone’s pengstory predates all of us, and all the memories of those who came before us. It is considered the mythological mooring of our cultural core. It is the first story we learn when we are hatched into this world. The stone, Pono’s very heart. What powers does it hold? What stories does it tell? But I ask you, my fellow emperors, how do we know that this is that stone?
The High Council arranges itself in a deep arc, so that the two members at either end are facing each other. One stands at the middle, facing the direction from which they came, and the others complete the semicircle at exacting intervals. Behind them, the Shelf stretches forever. Above them the sky fades to dawn blue. The wind settles down, as if humbled by the spectacle beneath it.
Sherlock smiled out the window and tried not to get too hard until they got home, but he failed at that, too. He made a short list of things he’d been failing at lately: not freaking out about going back to school the next day, not wanting to jump John every chance he got in an attempt to store up the feel of him, not checking into his flight even though he was now within the twenty-four hour window, and not cleaning up his room or beginning to pack. On the other hand, he countered, he had texted Sarah to thank her for having such a large role in Mrs. Watson’s gradual turnaround, amassed a plethora of information about the University of Chicago, sat down with John and their New York guide book and made a list of must-dos for their trip there, checked out some Lower East Side and Alphabet City hotels, and booked their flights. He felt good about those things, but they didn’t outweigh the pall of having run out of time with John.
“You are so posh. You’re my posh boy.” John grinned at him and hooked a finger into one of Sherlock’s belt loops. “What now?”
“Is there anything in that file John and I don’t already know, Mycroft? I doubt you’d have come all this way if there weren’t something important you wished to tell us. Unless, perhaps, the Highlands were calling to you? Have you decided to take a bit of a holiday?”
John cupped Sherlock’s ass with his hands, kneaded the cheeks, spread them, groped, squeezed. Ass up, chest down, Sherlock felt ready to break open with the need inside him. John reached between them and skimmed Sherlock’s balls, and Sherlock froze as every single nerve-ending in his body screamed John’s name.
John’s face didn’t seem to know what to do. A conflicted assortment of expressions passed over it, first with his eyebrows at his hairline, then scrunched together, then one up with the other down, then the other way around. Finally, he licked his lips and nodded.
John pursed his lips and looked up at the ceiling, eyes flitting back and forth as he considered. “It would look great in the sunroom, but it’ll take up most of the space, so we’ll have to move the armchairs.”
Nine stops later, they descended the stairs, got their bearings, and headed toward Lincoln Avenue. The north end of the street was pedestrianized, with Merz close to where they’d joined the avenue.
"Sherlock. Just take these two little tablets, and have a few sips of Vimto, and I promise I'll let you go back to sleep. C'mon, back up ya get."
John giggled, and lifted his right leg when Sherlock knelt to pull his jeans over his foot, then switched to the left side and did the same.
Sherlock let John’s hand fly, then made it drag again, and when Sherlock stopped altogether, John whimpered, but dropped his hand to the bed.
Sherlock swiveled away from John and held his coffee at arm’s length, and the person behind them laughed again.
wouldn't hurt the shower tiles, so he'd taken care of that while John worked away behind him. They'd fallen into bed naked, with damp hair and wrinkled fingers and toes, and slept for ten hours straight.
When he was done he had tucked himself back into the tuxedo trousers he'd never bothered to remove, and turned to go. Sherlock had been stunned, had felt his heart in his throat, bleeding out on his tongue. He tried to remain calm and unaffected. He asked Victor if they would see each other again before New Year's Eve. Victor had chuckled and said no, that he'd be at his girlfriend's parents' chalet for the rest of the holiday.
They talked over tea about the jobs to be done and then showed Annette around the house. She took notes and asked questions, and half-an-hour later John shook her hand again, thanked her for taking on the job, and had her enter his and Sherlock’s phone numbers into her phone.
"Moringa was taken to the High Council, found guilty of the accusations brought against her, and currently takes care of the Rūnangan orphans," Sherlock explains.
Sherlock sucked the crown back into his mouth, and John jerked and grunted half of Sherlock's name, then tensed. Sherlock stared, eyes wide, mouth slack, as John came, and came, and came. John grimaced through it, neck arched, every muscle strained, then slumped back down, shattered.
“But I could have gone anywhere, Sherlock, and I didn’t. I came back to you. I couldn’t stay away from you.”
Sherlock released John from his mouth, then licked a broad stripe from base to frenulum. He kissed the rosy slit at the top and swirled his tongue around in light circles. He suspected that what John wanted was tight, deep, and fast, but he also knew that teasing John this way would make those sensations that much more intense when he finally delivered.
They sipped their coffee and chatted about the weather, and after twenty minutes or so, Mr. Watson stood up, put his cup in the sink, and got ready to head back out.
“I usually don’t go to bed until I think I can’t stand up anymore, otherwise, I end up lying awake for hours on end, and that’s boring. I don’t usually watch television.”
“I believe you.” John wriggled under Sherlock, pushing one knee against the back of the couch to give Sherlock more room. He ran his hands down Sherlock’s back, pulled his shirt out of his trousers, and touched bare skin.
John doesn’t let go of Sherlock as he tentatively places one foot on his lower back, and steps up. Sherlock shifts his weight to better support John, and then John steps up with his other foot. Sherlock can see John’s wings flutter out to the side as he finds his balance, then John lowers himself down along the length of Sherlock’s back, and releases his hold on Sherlock’s neck.
“No doubt. Until tomorrow, then.” Mycroft gave them both a tight smile and made his way across the room.
John slipped his hands into Sherlock's open jeans and framed Sherlock's groin with his fingers. “Oh, God. You're not wearing underwear? This is why your ass looked so especially hot tonight, isn't it? Did it feel good? Having something rubbing up against you all night? Didn't get chafed, did you? Maybe I should take a look, make sure everything’s okay?”
“Tons of times, I’m sure. And that’s where the next part of the story comes from, because God, Sherlock, it was hard to look at you like that and not do all the things I wanted to do.”
Sherlock and John look at each other over her head as she pours more syrup on her french toast, affectionate wonder clear on both their faces.
Sherlock took his time, stopping several times to make sure the lights were evenly distributed across the branches, then twisting and winding the wide, velvet ribbon into place before he let John start hanging the colored balls. Sherlock stood back and supervised the process, stepping forward once in a while to move an ornament up or down a couple inches, or to swap one color out for another.
– and they asked for lessons in that, too. John tells them they have to develop their own language, because that’s the whole point of a
“It can’t have been more than twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes since I texted James the name of his next date, yet Daniel Cotter has already responded to his email and agreed to meet.”
The skyline came into view once they were on the Drive, and they looked at each other and grinned. The John Hancock and Sears Tower stood out like bookends on either side of the city, with Streeterville to the east, the Loop in the center, and the Gold Coast spreading north from the top of Michigan Avenue.
John takes over to explain Lestrade's ice chip game, and brags about Sherlock always winning the game, and how they had to change the rules, to make it harder for him, and when John tells the part about Sherlock finding the tooth, wrapped in seaweed, tucked into a crack in Cassiopeia's hull, he is bursting with pride, adoration for his
It was as if they had run a race, he realized, hard and fast, had pushed themselves beyond limitations to achieve something elusive but grand. He felt sleepy and high, there but not, grounded but floating.
Tui hides her face under her wing, takes a deep breath, and peeps out at them. “You will be the death of me,
“I said romantic entanglement, so in case you weren’t sure what that meant, let me enlighten you.” John yanks Sherlock’s pyjamas down around his narrow hips and leans forward with one hand planted near Sherlock’s head. “That means that we work together and we live together. We share a bed and a dinner table and we take care of each other. And yeah, you’ll still piss me off and I’ll still confound you with my idiocy, but we’ll take care of each other, we’ll watch out for each other, and we’ll give to each other, back and forth, together, the things we need and want, yeah?”
“We won’t get much sleep,” John whispers to Sherlock as he leans back against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock is tickled that John has stepped right back into their usual sleeping position, as if their nights together had never been interrupted.
“All right,” Greg said. “I don’t recognize them, but I’m going to say the shorter one is a fisting bottom who’s into bondage, and the taller one is a dildo-loving daddy with a navel kink.”
Sherlock pulled out his carbon nanotubes notes and doodled in the margins as he surreptitiously watched the police talk with Percolate’s owner, John, and the young woman, Molly. Eventually, the curly-haired officer escorted Molly into what must’ve been an office, and the grey-haired gent, obviously the higher ranking of the two, walked with John to the front door. Sherlock doodled more diligently but tilted his head toward the pair to hear what was being said.
“I was very happy to receive John’s email asking for photos of the two of you over the years. It led, as I believe he has told you, to several more emails, each of which became increasingly more personal in nature. Those emails, in turn, led to an interesting conversation regarding certain events in our lives, and your perception of those events.”
-ing sound, took the last tea cake out of the oven, and wiped her hands on her apron. She was just untying it as John led Sarah into the kitchen.
With that, she pushed back from the table, picked up their breakfast dishes, and turned to the sink. They were dismissed.
“The way you talked about it, Jesus, you’re just gagging for it, aren’t you?” Another swat. “God, this ass. The way it moves.” Another swat on the other side, more jolts of arousal, a moan. “I want to fuck this ass, Sherlock. Is that okay with you?”
“You're an insatiable old man, you know that?” John is trying for exasperation, but the underlying groan in his voice is hard to hide. He rests his head back on Sherlock's shoulder and lets those long fingers roam where they will.
Sherlock gave himself a final nudge and pushed himself up to sitting. He pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around his shins. “I need to solve this case.”
He licked the tips of his fingers and then swirled them over John’s nipple, plucking slightly, and John moaned and shrugged one shoulder back, arching his chest into Sherlock’s hand.
“Yeah. Actually, I was just wasting time, waiting for you to go in first, so by the time I followed, you'd be all lathered up, and I could get a good look at your ass, and you wouldn't know.”
), and before he'd even made his first post he had six followers, but they were all porn blogs, and John said they didn't count, so an amendment was added to the deal that porn blogs and bots would not be included in the total follower count. In fact, they both agreed to block any such blog that followed them. John immediately lost 163 followers.
He sees her again, just before she takes to the sea in the first days of the summer migration. He feels her hold him tight, hears her coo soft, gentle praises, tells him to listen well.
Sherlock sighed, glared at John over his microscope, and pushed back from the kitchen table. “Because it's absurd.”
Sherlock knew exactly what he wanted to happen. He wanted to go back to a time when none of this had been a possibility. He wanted to go back to pre-Brexit, pre-Trump-held-handbasket-dumpster-fire, to a time when he would have been free to make the decision to never marry, to never date, to spend as much time with other people as he deemed necessary, which would have been zero time. Seeing as how that was impossible, he had to face certain facts.
ii. If he does not immediately fling you upon the mattress, floor, or against a wall, and begin using both lips, his tongue, and at least four teeth in a full-on assault of your mouth, repeat
Very few moments have caused Sherlock's mind to grind to a halt. He can probably count them on one hand: John telling him he was his best friend; Moriarty declaring that John was in danger; John saying
The seal will do what the seal will do, Sherlock thinks. He cannot waste any time on her. He hopes that her pain will drive her away, and that if she stays, her blindness will confuse and disorient her.
It was becoming more difficult to ignore the hardness between his legs. He was throbbing and he could feel the damp spot on his pyjamas catch on the head of his erect cock. What he wanted, more than anything, was to rub himself against something, preferably John’s thigh. It seemed the longer Sherlock’s mouth worked over John’s chest, the harder he got, and the harder he got, the more demanding his mouth became of the flesh underneath it. They were both breathing hard now, and writhing.
“Go. Go get your things, enough for you and Rosie to stay until you can arrange for the movers to come. I’ll stay with her. You go. Go now. Hurry.” Sherlock moves to sweep around John’s side and go to Rosie, then thinks twice and stops. “Me, too. About you, I mean.”
“I mean it, come back anytime. You know Kevin thinks of you guys as family, and you’re always welcome to stay with us.”
The shorter one stands up tall and puffs out his chest, which throws him off balance and sends him careening into the taller one. “Oof. I am Ariki of Hoani and Tria, and this is –”
Sherlock rolled onto his back as John closed the space between them. He let his hand slide down the flexing muscles of John’s back, lower, lower, until his fingertips ascertained what he thought he’d seen a few moments earlier. John was naked. He stopped with his hand pressed to John’s hip, his fingertips gently prodding the firm upper swell of John’s arse. John paused, then slipped his leg between Sherlock’s, and Sherlock, for the first time, discovered the bliss of John’s naked erection pressed against his own naked thigh.
Sherlock wasn’t worried about remembering the colors. He’d already memorized a list he’d looked up on his phone that morning. He was worried about attracting attention from other people. No, correct that. He was worried about John attracting attention from other people, because who wouldn’t want to hook up with John, especially when they saw that he was a top who loved giving blowjobs, sixty-nine, rimming, and people getting off on his stinky armpits? Okay, so maybe that last one was Sherlock-specific. But really, he didn’t need John to become even more tantalizing to other men.
Molly nibbled on her thumbnail and looked back and forth between them. “I don’t think I should come back, John. It wouldn’t look good at all if someone saw me here in the middle of the night.”
They are sprawled in the two rickety lawn chairs left by the previous owners, Sherlock’s hand spread over John’s thigh, John’s fingers combing through the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock is teaching John to differentiate between the heady scents of dianthus and nicotiana, garden phlox and sweet pea. John is especially fond of the climbing roses that adorn the old stone walls, and can’t wait to get close to the soil and try his hand at gardening.
John opened his eyes and put his hand over Sherlock’s. “Wasn’t it for you? Oh God, Sherlock, tell me it was good for you.”
“No. I haven’t made any such decision.” John was still looking out the window, talking to the tangle of weeds outside. Don’t be a coward, he told himself.
“You've got me John, you've got all of me, you've—oh God, I’m in you, I'm all the way in you, and you feel so fucking good.”
He continued to the end of the first dock and sat down with his back against the emergency call box, facing the skyline. From there he had a view of the stripped trees and snow covered park, and beyond that the mid-rise residential buildings, a hospital, a parking garage. Everything that wasn’t white was gray and blue, tinged with the hue of frigid air and low hanging clouds.
John didn’t move again for the duration of their trip, and by the time they pulled up in front of 221b, the effects of the alcohol had partially worn off, but Sherlock found he was still very much looking forward to his first kiss with John. He managed to get the door unlocked after two bungled attempts, then held the door open for John, waved his arm and said, “After you, Dr Watson.”
Back in his bedroom, he grabbed the navy blue-on-blue striped silk robe from inside his closet, slipped into it, and faced the mirror on the inside of the closet door. Mycroft had sent him this robe a couple of years ago when he’d been on assignment somewhere in Southeast Asia, but he’d never worn it. Now he wondered why. It clung to him, as if painted on by the very mulberry worms that’d spun the silk.
Sherlock looked at John, at his flushed cheeks and his bright blue eyes, his frost-pink lips and the tufts of hair sticking out from under the brim of his hat. His John. His John with his Rudolph-red nose in the crisp December air, with the stars staring down on them and their secrets.
Sherlock nodded. “I am ready, John. Last night I told you that I trust you. You helped me see that trusting you is exactly why everything is going to be okay when we have sex. You also said that I’m falling in love with you, but you were wrong about that. I’m done falling. I have completely fallen. I am absolutely, assuredly in love with you, and you’re in love with me, and it’s time for us to not hold back with each other anymore.”
Nor would "God, you're such an idiot!" work in the waiting room of the surgery, where John's patients sat with high hopes that their doctor might heal their ailments and promise them future health.
His phone rang as he pushed through the front door of his building. It slammed shut behind him as he tapped the ‘answer’ button with his thumb.
“No, really, let me just —“ John leaned over to grab at the cans, putting his head right over Sherlock’s lap.
“Don’t misunderstand, John. The fellatio was amazing. It was perfect. I wasn’t purposefully thinking of other things while you were doing that.”
Sherlock felt a weird pang at John’s use of the word ‘dating.” Surely they were doing more than that?
To think that he’d been so dismissive of John when they’d first met. What if John had listened to him and left the house that day? He couldn’t help but remember how smug he’d been when John first courted him, as if he was doing John a favour by letting him get close, as if there had ever been any real substance to his deliberations about marrying the man.
IT APPEARS I AM APPROACHING CLIMAX TWELVE MINUTES THIRTY-SIX SECONDS SOONER THAN PREVIOUS ESTIMATIONS ALLOWED
“Exactly! So, anyway, I was positive you’d be 100 percent on board with talking to my students, and I could provide you with an outline in advance, or the entire lesson plan, if you’d like. There is so much rich information in it, I think you’d really appreciate it. It’s even in cursive! I was thinking of sometime in March or April, but I could certainly accommodate your schedule. Mostly, I think the kids would benefit from seeing a pillar of the community, such as yourself, standing up for our young ones, don’t you?” Sarah scraped the last of the pie onto her fork and lifted it to her mouth. She made an appreciate sound around the pie, and her performance, and set the fork back down with a soft clink.
“Oh. Would you rather not talk about it?” Sherlock turned over and mirrored John’s position so they were facing each other. It was hard to see John’s face in the dark but he could just make out the curve of his ear and cheek.
They flap at each other as those around them look on, curious, then fall onto the ice and shake until they hear Mycroft’s uptight trill calling for Sherlock.
“He’ll be just fine,” John crooned, rubbing Sherlock’s tiny-flower covered shoulder. “Right, gorgeous?”
He needed a strategy. What would Mrs Hudson recommend? Sherlock finished drying off and tossed his towel onto the bed. She would suggest he follow John’s lead, to volley questions back to John, not monopolise the conversation, not make too many cruel or cynical deductions about those around them. Fine. He could do that. He was nothing if not a quick learner, and after his last, failed and painful attempt at dating he had tried his best to absorb the inherent lessons. Mrs Hudson had been stalwart during that time, and he sent her silent thanks through the floorboards.
“God, this rain! I should’ve expected it, given the way it looked when I left this morning.” He looked back and forth between Sherlock and James, water dripping from his hair and running under his collar. “I’m going to get changed, then we can have lunch, yeah? I picked up some sandwich stuff and some salads. Sherlock, put on a pot of tea?”
“The thoughts just sort of came … and then I did, too.” He chuckled at his own joke and John smiled at him and leaned in for a quick kiss.
After a quick bite at Clark Street Dog, they spent the afternoon exploring the stretch of Halsted at the heart of Boystown, with its coffee shops, restaurants, clothing boutiques, bookstores, gay bars, and sex shops.
“Whenever you’d like. It doesn’t have to be now. How about if right now we join James in the library for a little while and then head to bed?”
“Oh, one last thing. I wouldn’t have any more coffee if I were you. Not unless you want to be awake until February.”
“I’m not going to mate with Janine or anyone but you, and neither are you, ever, going to mate with anyone but me.”
And then there were the more lascivious smiles, the ones John sent when Sherlock caught him staring at his body. Those smiles were physical assaults, and Sherlock breathed them in from across the room, pulled them right into his lungs with a sharp inhalation. He could feel those smiles push goosebumps up on his forearms, harden his nipples, flutter through the chambers of his heart, and then slide down, down, down, into his belly and groin and inner thighs.
Sherlock nodded, eyes still closed, and felt John move away from him and the table. He dragged air in for a slow count to four, then exhaled to the same count. A moment later John was back with Greg and Kevin, one of whom was chewing a hangnail, the other of whom was biting his lip and fidgeting with his collar.
They spend their time collecting the best skipping stones, and making small piles of them where others won’t find and disturb their work. Sherlock coaches John on his kicking technique, and soon John is breaking not only his records, but those of other pengs, too. Sherlock didn’t think he would find kicking stones particularly interesting, but it doesn’t take him long to figure out that it isn’t so much the activity, as who he is doing it with.
And so it ends. I promised you none of the angst usually associated with retirement!lock, and I hope I have delivered. John and Sherlock are together, in love, healthy, happy, and have many more years ahead of them. Blowjobs, too. Yeah, well, there goes my attempt at lovely and sincere.
“Not … just … yet,” Sherlock answers, letting go of John for as long as it takes to get both hands on his arse and spread his cheeks. John groans and drops his head to the step in front of him, then thrusts backwards to where he knows Sherlock's tongue is positioned, waiting.
Sherlock finished getting James up to speed while John listened and drank his tea. James had questions about Sherlock’s deduction process and how he’d figured out which applicant was the suspect. When Sherlock was done explaining they agreed that James would go back to Annette’s flat, arrange the date with Nathan Foster, the candidate Sherlock had deduced was a virgin with anger management and commitment issues, and report back to them with the arranged time and place. Satisfied with the plan, Sherlock sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest.
Sherlock buried his face in John’s shoulder and drew his leg up as far as he could, pressing his inner thigh to John’s hip.
It was a matter of ten minutes before they were at the address Annette had sent, and then another thirty seconds before they’d climbed three flights of steep stairs and were standing on a quiet, dark landing outside the door to a flat.
? Did they mean … dating? After all, didn’t everyone from Angelo to Mrs. Hudson think they were dating? Why did everyone think they were dating? Should they be dating? Why should they be dating?
Their server approached with a cast iron pan of steaming paella; someone else followed her with their half-pitcher of sangria, fresh plates, and two wine glasses filled with ice.
John arranged himself, and Sherlock stood on either side of his knees and stared down at him. John’s chest and neck were flushed pink. His skin was covered with a fine sheen of sweat, and his nipples were erect. His cock was thick and hard and jutting up. He was beautiful. God, but his man was beautiful.
Sherlock sat down on the couch, crossed his hands in his lap, and addressed James. “I assume John tried to talk you into staying here?”
John shifts as close to Sherlock as he can, and tilts up on his feet. The egg rolls forward, then John leans into Sherlock and places his wings on Sherlock’s for support. Together, they nudge the egg until it sits on Sherlock’s feet, and then he leans down and uses his bill to press it into his pouch.
It is dark and cold, but he has no concept that it could be anything but. He shakes, fluffs, preens, stretches. Body organized, he makes moves to see beyond his keeper, but his father will not allow them to be separated. He must brood at the elder's feet for the next one and one half lunar cycles. He protests, a squawk with little bite but plenty of attitude, and then he is nuzzled. He is not bothered by this.
Sherlock's heart was about to blow from the pressure building in it, like an engine, racing out of control, a rocket, tearing itself to pieces. “I love you so much, John. There are no words for how much I love you.”
Sherlock reached for a cha siu bao and dragged it through plum sauce before dropping it on his plate.
“All right, then. Enough of that. You two need to get on the road. I won't be held responsible for making you late.”
Tui mutters through the side of her bill, which is clenched down on the watery sea plant. "Kept us up half the night with your sleep talk about seeing John again – figured at least one of us should get some shut eye."
Violetwylde on Tumblr said, "As I sit here - one arm in a sling, trying not to cough on my monitor while a migraine eats away at the nerves of my left eye - I beseech you: bring me porn. Any and all. Smut fic, sexy pics, crude drawings of phalluses (Phallusi? Phalleese?). I will take all offerings with the deepest gratitude. Thank you."
Sherlock looked down at John now and John looked back, held his gaze, smiled. There was affection and intimacy written all over them, and keeping that from showing would be nearly impossible now. What was Sherlock supposed to do in those small-town places now? High-five John whenever he felt like touching him? Not make eye contact? Keep a three-foot distance at all times? It was impossible. How did others do it?
Literally, you just need to create a stable of happy thoughts and images and make yourself go there when you find yourself ruminating. Ruminative thoughts can be pesky assholes, though, so don't be surprised if they intrude into your happy place. Keep kicking them out. The more you do it, the easier it gets. The more you stop ruminating, the less you'll ruminate.
Sherlock temporarily lost sight of his stomach ailment, sat up tall, and prayed that no one would start singing. They didn’t. Instead, the staff wished him a very happy birthday, waited until he blew out the candle, and dispersed.
Mycroft looks entirely too pleased with himself, with his lofty posture and the upward lift of his chin. Next to him, Anthea is just as elegant, radiating an air of understated self-importance. Yes, those two will work well together.
Pleasantries are exchanged, and Terina settles next to Mycroft and catches her breath. The two of them talk quietly to each other, and Sherlock turns his attention back to Anahera and Tui.
John lowered his head and pressed a soft kiss to the vein throbbing up the length of Sherlock’s cock, then another, and another, finally kissing the weeping tip before pressing his lips in a slow slide over the head.
As soon as they are safely removed, Erebus rejoins John, and the two of them make their way back to Sherlock.
In the office, the one he tried to pretend was his, but would always be his father’s, were shelves of old
John wriggles and rolls on top of Sherlock, setting off a series of vibrations throughout Sherlock’s body that drive directly into the pressure building in his belly, everything going tense, so tense, and tingling, and amazing.
They all watch as she stomps away to rejoin the elders, still irate at what the younger pengs have told her. Eight pairs of sleepy eyes track her every movement, half-hoping for some sort of showdown between the two spinsters. When she reaches the older emperors, arranged in a discussion circle, she wedges herself between Erebus and Cetus, and with great agitation, begins to whisper directly into Erebus’ ear. Sherlock watches Erebus nod now and then, and then, coming to the conclusion that there will be no spectacle forthcoming, he relaxes against John, and closes his eyes.
“And your cock is so hard, so fucking hard, and I reach around you, and start stroking you, and I'm pounding into you –”
When John stopped it was to speak, and when he spoke Sherlock flung open the door to his mind palace, waiting to make sure he had heard correctly, and then filed it away for the rest of their shared eternity.
Sherlock was neither aware of nor interested in the clapping taking place around him; he was married to John Watson, he was kissing his husband.
He set it down on the bench, the same one they had sat on just that morning, and put his hands on his hips. Eyebrow quirked, he shook his head and sighed. “Tired, eh?”
So, they’d head out there and strip off in the shade of the ancient Cottonwood, talking the whole time about nothing, because stripping off in silence would've been strange, and then they’d run off the edge of the rock overhang together, flying, splashing down into the cold, clear water.
“How is you eating an apple sexy to me? What’re you wearing? Tell me you’re wearing that tight purple sweater and those really beat up 501’s with the little hole under the left back pocket.”
“Yeah, I remember. I couldn’t get enough of you. I could barely talk sometimes, I was so desperate to get my wings on you.” John chuckles under his breath and kisses Sherlock, then kisses him again. “You also second-guessed telling me everything Erebus had told you, and my feelings for Maryle, and what we should do about the tooth, and if I would wait for you, and ‒”
John bumped up against him, kissing him as he walked him back to the bed. When his legs hit the mattress, Sherlock grabbed John’s arms and pulled him, and John came down on top of him. They scrambled to right themselves, heads on the pillows, and John resettled himself with his legs on either side of one of Sherlock’s, his groin over Sherlock’s hip.
“Well then, she's quite lucky. I think she's come to tell us about a big party that they're having for the Queen's birthday. They're going to serve honey cakes and honey juice and honey pancakes, and we'll need to bring a gift.”
In the morning, they would spend an hour opening gifts and eating hot-from-the-oven cinnamon rolls, until it was a decent enough hour for Sherlock to call John and ask him what he got for Christmas. By noon, the Watsons would come over to the Holmes’ house, and spend the rest of the afternoon and early evening there. In this way, Christmas day had become bearable. It was a routine that worked, so they’d never considered altering it.
Sherlock points down to the frozen tern body they’ve just stumbled over. It’s barely visible under a thin layer of snow and ice. “See?” He holds his wings out, underside up, and looks back and forth between them. He lets them flop back down to his sides. They don't see it. How can they not see it?
Sherlock felt the press of John’s thigh along his thigh, his arm along his arm. Good, Sherlock thought. That’s good. That meant he wouldn’t fly apart into a million miscommunicated pieces.
Sherlock ran his thumb under John’s lower lashes and smiled. “Let’s order that pizza you were talking about earlier, and I’ll tell you, okay?”
After all the planning and waiting, they still have so much to discuss. Have they picked the right name for their little one? When will John leave to feed? How will they care for Erebus and a new hatchling? Whom should they ask to pengsit when the time comes?
Sherlock didn’t question him. He poured two glasses, passed one to John, and held his up to toast. “To finding James’ would-be-assassin.”
"I accept full responsibility, except for the part where you finished my flight and refused to eat."
John nodded toward the groceries piled up on the counter next to him. “Why don’t you chop those spring onions and grate the cheese? The oven is almost hot enough for the potatoes. The beans can steam for a few minutes just before the steaks are done. I’d say we’ll be ready to eat in about forty minutes.”
They walked toward the Brown Line El station in silence for a few minutes, but before they reached the station, Sherlock asked John if he thought he was ready to end their time in Chicago.
“You’re fucking gorgeous, ya know that?” He took a quick look around, then ran his fingers into the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck. “You’re fucking gorgeous, and brilliant, and the thought of spending the next four nights in bed with you is gonna make it real difficult for me to walk into that store right now and buy something called allspice. So you hold that thought, and I swear to God, tonight I’ll make it up to you.”
Although a thinly veiled ploy, as there is next to nothing on the iceberg, Cetus gratefully accepts the gesture and provides a short list of materials that he needs. He explains that some of his supplies are available in the water upon which they float.
With almost seventy beers on tap, a majority of them Belgian, Sherlock knew the odds were good that John wouldn’t be able to choose. Sure enough, twenty seconds into the bet, John started muttering under his breath. “Dogfish … Bosteels … St. Bernardus … Almanac Farmer’s Valencia Gold … shit shit shit … Perennial Hopfentea … Chimay Cinq Cent … crap fuck shit … Pollyanna Nose Over Tail … oh man.”
Sherlock took John's face in his hands and crouched a bit so that they were eye to eye, and John wrapped his hands around Sherlock's wrists and let his eyelids drift close.
John is almost fully grown, as are Molling, Lestra, Stamfjord, and the others. Their baby fuzz is gone. They stand sleek, black and white, well-insulated by their layers of oiled feathers, and a summer’s worth of thick fat. They try to stay close to each other, friends bonded through hatchlinghood, trauma, and their time together on Cassiopeia.
“The second I knew you were serious about me I ended that,” John explained. “By text. I didn’t even call. Bit rude of me, to be honest, but that’s how insignificant they were to me, okay?”
Erebel smiles up at Sherlock and shakes her head. "Oh, Pāpā," she giggles. "Should we fetch Dā to come fix you?"
“Like absolutely everything. For good, for evil, for one, for all. The sky, my young friend, is the limit.”
John’s shoulder jerked under Sherlock's hand as he began to work his cock in short, fast pumps. Sherlock pressed his thumb into the back of John's neck and looked down between them. It was overwhelming, the visual of John's parted cheeks, his stretched hole, his hard thighs shaking.
At the end of our last chapter, John and Sherlock had just had spectacular sex and were feeling emotional about leaving Chicago the next day. They'll have to say goodbye and return to their respective schools in eleven days. Sherlock tells John that he has an idea, and he's going to tell him about it over pizza in bed.
Sherlock slumped down against the pillows and let his head fall back. The sensation of the tight, wet, rutting, combined with the filthy begging, was altogether too much. He gave himself over to it. His thighs stretched and trembled, his belly fluttered, his neck arched. His hair was plastered to his forehead, and his nipples ached. He stroked them, empathetic to their plight.
In another one, they’re standing in front of the Ford, with its hood up, and John has his arms crossed over his chest, and Sherlock is leaning back on his elbows with one ankle crossed over the other, and he can see it, the tension between them, in the way they’re holding their bodies, close but taut, pretending to smile real smiles.
Should you need further assistance, or desire to purchase one of the aforementioned appurtenant courses, please do not hesitate to contact us again.
The song finished on its last fading notes, and Sherlock rested his forehead against John’s and laughed. He laughed at himself and how much he loved this man, and how much this man loved him, and he laughed at the thought that he probably messed up half the words and had twelve chins when he laughed this hard, and he could not care less.
The cold air sobered Sherlock up a bit, and as they speed-walked away from the club, Sherlock speed-talked about how taken he'd been with the whole boyfriend-turned-volcano-turned-prize-fighter scenario.
Supper was a quiet affair, probably because Harry had gone off to a high school friend’s house for the evening, and with her gone, at least half the usual chatter was missing from the Watson house. Sherlock helped set the table, falling into lifelong habits moving around the kitchen, passing forks to John, setting glasses down, pulling napkins out of the pantry.
Plus, nothing was going to be open on New Year’s Day, and Greg really did need the help. After running back to the hotel to change clothes and pack an overnight bag, Sherlock and John met Greg and Kevin at Greg’s place, a small and dark walk up on the fourth floor of a courtyard building on Brompton and Broadway. The four of them spent the better part of Friday afternoon packing Greg’s belongings into an assortment of boxes, bags, and crates.
John stood then, and ducked down to give Mrs. Hudson a peck on the cheek. Together, he and Sherlock left the kitchen. They stood in the family room for a moment, but neither felt compelled to take a seat, so they drifted back up the stairs. John grabbed Sherlock's hand as he turned toward the bedroom, and pulled him toward his childhood room instead.
“His girlfriend’s birthday party. It’s on the 28th. We don’t have to go. I told him we didn’t know what our plans were yet.”
“You’d be doing us a favor, Greg. Thank you.” Sherlock slid out of the booth next and held out a hand to John, who grabbed on and let himself be tugged up to standing.
Sherlock opens his bill, and out spills every worry, every doubt, every half-thawed thought he’s had since starting this journey. He talks and talks and talks, wings flapping, feet stomping, and when he's purged every last bit, he stops, stops talking, stops walking, and he glowers at Mycroft.
"A whore in –” John has no idea where Sherlock gets his twisted metaphors. He stops caring the moment Sherlock inserts his tongue into John’s mouth. Sherlock tilts his head, aligning them just so, and draws out the kiss. It’s slow and deep and perfect. He is so precise, so exacting with his lips and tongue; it reminds John of the way Sherlock eats a ripe peach, with intent and focus. He’ll want to prove himself now, John thinks. He’ll want to make it up to John, even though there’s nothing for it, nothing to forgive. John will let him, though, because he loves this kind of love-making, when Sherlock takes over and dominates him. Sherlock will take his pleasure from drowning John in sensation, observing his every reaction, fine-tuning every one of John’s groans and sighs, every twitch and shudder.
The light shifts as the sun moves, and the parade of colours begins a slow sweep over the colony. Pengs watch as their toes and legs and bellies and chests are bathed in the jewel tones of pink anthias and sunsets and algae and blood. They reach out and touch each other, wide-eyed.
“I don’t see that there’s really anything to talk about, John. It would appear that you’ve already done all the talking for me.”
“Maryle, you are so sweet, and it was very kind of you to share these … sentiments with me. I would’ve done for any penguin what I did for you, and I will do it again if required. You just stay safe out there, okay? Stay near my parents, and Harriet, if you’d like, and don’t go out on your own, and I’m sure we’ll run into each other back at Pobeda.”
More zillions of buckets of gratitude to KarlyAnne, who slaps me upside the head about staying in character, and when Sherlock
John couldn’t tread much further. They rarely spoke so openly about their relationship, or the lines that occasionally blurred into suggestions of something more. To do so, without any sense of surefootedness, was terrifying.
in Russian. It is formed by the calving of an iceberg over time, and it disappears and reforms every decade or so.
Sherlock rolled them over, lying by John’s side, and sucked little love bites down John’s neck, then wriggled lower and licked and kissed his way across John's chest and nipples. He pulled one into his mouth, and John bucked and hit his head on the backseat.
“You can call me John.” John is still trying to navigate his way around the flustering hatchlings and reach Sherlock’s side.
“Wait one moment, Molling, please.” He nudges Anahera with his bill, and whispers to her that it’s time to wake up, that the healers are done. Anahera opens her eyes. Sherlock watches as she transitions from confusion to remembrance to fear.
He takes a careful step away from John while nudging Stamfjord and Lestra into his place, making sure that John resettles against them before he removes himself from the crèche. If he wasn’t fully awake before, the rush of cold air that surrounds him now does the job.
John cupped Sherlock's jaw and ran his thumb over his lower lip, now puffed up and swollen from its efforts, and ran the tip of his nose across Sherlock's upper lip. Sherlock could feel the weight of John's torso pressed against him, could feel how hard he was breathing, how his hips angled against his inner thighs, how his hard-on –
“Well, I assume some people wouldn't like it, giving, or receiving. I mean, it's not exactly, you know.” Sherlock added John's shirt and undershirt to the pile, and started working on his jeans. John's hands were in the way, tugging at Sherlock's fly.
“John, if you don’t want to date Sarah, just say so. You don’t need to set up some kind of stunt to prove it to me.”
Sherlock licked up John’s neck, sucked on an earlobe, kissed back down along his collarbone. He suckled and flicked John’s nipples, teased his fingers into his pubic hair, and blew into his belly button. Sherlock kissed and groped and stroked and fondled this beautiful man of his, sliding down inch by inch, until he was out of reach of John's mouth and hands, and could push John's knees up and back.
His thoughts continued to mimic the intense, singular focus John was paying him. In the blackness behind closed eyelids he saw concentric circles closing in on each other, red-orange dots and spirals that continuously recentred in his head no matter how hard he tried to move beyond them. He gripped the sheets in his fists and stretched the fabric on either side of his head, grunting into the pillow. He imagined the scene from John’s point-of-view, the stretch of his fingers on pale, spread flesh, the moist, pink pucker under his tongue, the tremor and shiver in Sherlock’s skin, but his attention was like a deduction now, honing down, honing in, an unrelenting brainstorm of singular intent.
They reside on Pobeda Island in the Mawson Sea, she says, on the eastern side of the Shackleton Ice Shelf, on the eastern edge of the land mass known now as Antarctica, in the South Indian Ocean, at the bottom of the world.
John stood up and slapped his hands against his thighs. "Right. Not dying, Sherlock, not even close. I'll be right back with your drink, and then you are absolutely taking that medicine."
Sherlock sat up and packed the pillows between himself and the headboard, and John set the tray down on his lap. There were waffles with butter and maple syrup, and strips of bacon, well-done and crispy the way he liked, and a stack of toast, and a little pot of strawberry preserves. Orange juice, and coffee, too, and a cloth napkin.
5:16. Forty minutes. John would be back any minute. Sherlock finished rubbing his hair dry with the bath towel and finger-combed it out of his eyes. There was no point trying to style it; it was going to be completely disheveled soon enough, and John liked it like this. He checked that he’d shaved close enough, applied deodorant, trimmed his nails, and shoved all his toiletries back into the drawer from which they came.
Sherlock stared at his violin, then at John, and then sat down next to his unfinished cup of tea. Kiss? Kiss. “Yes.”
The bath was better in theory than in practice, the porcelain tub proving to be a bit short for both of them to settle into comfortably. They eventually worked it out so that Sherlock was reclined against one end of the tub, with John at the other end, their legs on either side of each other.
“I picked the very best ones because I didn’t want to fill it up. This is only, what, fifteen years of our lives? We have a lot of years to go, and a lot more photos to put in here. Photos we haven’t taken yet.”
Kahu in particular loves asking this last question. He asks over and over again, giggling when Sherlock’s smile goes a bit wobbly, and when John puffs up his chest and explains, “I am Sherlock’s
Sherlock and John stand next to each other, not moving, not talking, not looking. When John does speak, it’s to say, “All right then. Good stuff. Good stuff. See you tomorrow?”
“First, we will attend their regular council meeting. At the end of that, they will ask the colony if there are any matters of new business. We will approach the council leader and introduce ourselves. He, or she, will arrange for our introduction to the appropriate High Council representative, who may or may not sit on the High Council. That peng will debrief us on proper protocols, and then direct us through the next step of the process. After we have presented a summary of the events that have led us here, the High Council will meet privately to decide how to best serve our needs, after which point –”
Sherlock drops to the ice and toboggans the rest of the way. Chances are he won’t be able to slow and stop before he crashes into the crèche, but the fallout from that is preferable to being caught out by the adults, who are all beginning to stir, now that Cetus has. They can’t see him now, not with the junior pengs blocking their line of site to Sherlock’s approach.
John sulks for a bit, then aggressively grooms his shoulder. Sherlock stops his pacing and gently removes John’s bill from where it’s making a bare spot in his beautiful feathers.
Sherlock fought back the urge to laugh out loud. Here he was, trying to stand his ground in front of the man who had unknowingly cockblocked him the night before, while facing down a death threat, and a few feet away this diminutive girl with bright red hair was ordering him to sit down and have toast and strawberry preserves.
He spits the tooth out of his mouth and watches it skip across the floor of the cave. It is so bright, so glossy-clear, Sherlock can see his reflection when he bends down to examine the tooth. He is caught off guard, not having seen more of himself than is possible in the ever-moving, dark, and blurry reflection of the sea. He takes a moment to look at himself, as he has often wondered what John sees when he looks at Sherlock.
For the longest time, he'd been made fun of for being too thin and lanky, for his too curly hair, his paper-pale skin, squinty eyes and angular face. His peers at school had never stopped letting him know that he was awkward, gangly, the ugly duckling in the crowd. Was it possible he'd fulfilled that particular story arc and become something of a swan?
Sherlock did as requested, spreading his knees apart on the mattress, and when John pushed down between his shoulder blades, he lowered his chest and forearms and head to the pillow.
. He followed the line of John’s arm down the back of his hand, and back and forth over his knuckles.
Mrs. Watson fussed with the deli meat, sealing ziplock bags and stacking them up near her plate. “Waste of money, if you ask me. We can open a bottle of fizzy wine right here just as well as we can somewhere else.”
John chuckles, takes a step back, and looks down. He raises his head, winks at Sherlock, and then cranes his head up, his wings down, his chest out. He holds the pose, and Sherlock mirrors it, not needing to look at John to know the position of each feather. He senses John all around him, and it is the work of a subconscious thought to form himself in his mate’s image.
Sherlock’s knees began to slide apart, so he arched his lower back to compensate, and there it was, that spot, that magical spot, being hit in exactly the right way, over and over again.
He rests his head on top of John’s and wraps his wings around him from behind. “No, but I’m used to it by now. We can rest tomorrow if we need to.”
Sherlock smirked. Mummy had tried to arrange even this detail and Sherlock had pretended to let her get away with what she thought was appropriate—some Frank Sinatra song about flying to the moon or some such claptrap—but when she was otherwise occupied Sherlock had had a talk with the orchestra leader. He wanted to be on the dance floor when the music started so that he wouldn’t have to deal with his mother, so he took John’s hand and led him to the parquet floor in front of the musicians. He saw a flurry of an apricot-chiffon wrapped Mummy out of the corner of his eye when the first notes of his song started, but he kept his eyes on John and started to move, leading John in their dance.
He braced himself on one elbow and grabbed a fistful of Sherlock’s hair, low at the nape of his neck, and tugged so that Sherlock would arch his neck. John licked and kissed his way down from chin to collarbone, then back to Sherlock’s mouth.
“I know, right?” John agreed. “The toffee sauce we use is a proprietary secret of Bea’s family, apparently. Passed down through generations or some such.”
Sherlock rubbed at his sore hip and rolled his neck on his shoulders. Much as he didn’t want to admit it, the idea had merit. He wrapped his blanket around his shoulders and sat back against the bed at John’s side. They stared out the window at the early morning light stretching its way across the sky.
“Oh, my God.” Sherlock turned to John with wide, unblinking eyes. John stared back and let out a low whistle.
hypocritical! No, I’m sure Pastor just says what he has to say, but we all know he’s actually such a very open-minded man.”
It was not an image Sherlock wanted in his head. He sat down and leaned over the desk as eight different camera angles came into view on the screen. Greg punched a few keys on his keyboard and the screen filtered down to just two of those views, both showing the room John was in. Greg zoomed in on one side, giving them a good shot of Sally and John at their adjacent tables. They were sitting with their backs to the wall, and Sally’s friend had joined her. John was still on his own.
come home. John had come home and made it very clear that in all the ways that mattered, he’d never really left. And even when they were fourteen hundred miles apart, John didn’t leave. And now John was in Sherlock’s bed, and Sherlock was in the bathroom, pinching himself, and that didn’t make any sense at all, because if he wanted to know if this was real, he only needed to go back to bed.
They sat as close as they could and watched each other over emptying glasses, leaving small touches on thighs and forearms and waists, touches that said
John stepped forward and hooked one finger in the belt of Sherlock’s robe, and pulled until it fell open. He pushed the sides open a bit more, revealing a wide swath of Sherlock’s body, and licked his lips. “You don’t even know, do you? How beautiful you are?”
There was no doubt in Sherlock’s mind that Laffitte would do everything in his power to get in John’s pants. He would justify anything whatsoever to get what he felt was his due; hopefully, he’d try to justify something illegal. Sherlock hadn’t let himself think further than tonight, but as he and Greg walked into Greg’s office, he let himself wonder what would happen if this didn’t work, and Laffitte did indeed press charges.
“Stephan, in case setting your note on fire wasn’t clear enough, I’m not remotely interested in meeting you, knowing you, or going home with you.”
No one talked again until they were pulling into the Watson’s driveway, and then Mr. Watson said, “Come on over for supper, Sherlock. We’ll talk then. John, I know you’re both heading back to school tomorrow. Why don’t you see your young man home? Be back by six o’clock.”
“You should move into the upstairs bedroom, and maybe turn yours into a guest room. And you should clean out that office and use it yourself.”
Sherlock knows John’s joking face, and he is not currently wearing his joking face. John’s face is very serious. John’s face, adorable as it always is, is giving Sherlock a very pointed look, and Sherlock knows that John knows things that Sherlock does not, so he takes John’s advice and he goes to say goodbye.
”I don’t know what happened. I got distracted. I didn’t think about it again until you woke up more than an hour later. I was in my room reading and I heard you call for me. I tried to get you to take your medicine then but you were talking about Redbeard and aliens and none of it made any sense. You were burning up, flushed and sweaty, and when Mrs. Hudson took your temperature it had shot up to 104°.
After supper they’d cleaned up the kitchen, washing and drying everything by hand, and then putting it all away. John’s dad was already planted in front of the TV, feet up on the footrest of his La-Z-Boy recliner, remote control in hand, and John’s mom was perched on the edge of the sofa, working on a two thousand piece puzzle. The box cover said, “Thomas Kinkade, Sunset on Lamplight Lane.”
Sherlock asks John if misunderstanding generosity for promiscuity wouldn’t be a sign that the suitor would not be a worthy partner, but John reminds him that the season for finding a mate, bonding, and producing an egg comes only once every twelve moons, and not all emperors are as clear-headed as Sherlock.
By the time Sherlock has completely lost himself in these very disturbing thoughts, two other pengs have swum over and appear to have joined the conversation.
fly. We fly in the water. We move just as fast as a skybird, and dive and leap and spin, and do everything they can do. The water is our sky, John."
His brother tried to school his expression but wasn’t fast enough. Sherlock saw the surprise in the lines on his brother’s forehead, heard it in his small intake of breath.
John planted his elbows on the table and covered his face with his hands. “You're ridiculous,” he mumbled. “But fine.”
To this day, Vela says, Kororā stays in the sky with their egg, Pono's corpse for a cape, waiting for her heir to hatch.
Sherlock is sure the day must be coming to a close, but the light touching the horizon says they have not even passed the afternoon.
Sherlock jumped up and down into his jeans, the process of hoisting them over his narrow hips made more difficult by the plushness of his ass.
John released his arms from under his head, and grabbed onto Sherlock’s hair, arching up into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock ground down onto John’s leg, and sucked harder.
“Why don’t I have John drop it off? That’ll save you the trip. Don’t be silly, it’s no inconvenience at all.”
In the bathroom he and John crowded around the single sink and brushed their teeth. John handed Sherlock the towel after he dried his face and hands, then filled a glass with water, drank half, and handed the rest to Sherlock.
Sherlock very much wants to stick his tongue out at Mycroft, but suspects this would undermine what they perceive as his mature countenance.
Sherlock shook his head and smiled. “Think about it, John. Whatever is innate, is a gift. What you do with the gift, that's what makes you smart. You're using your innate intelligence, which is not insignificant, to study what you need to know to help people, to do good in the world. I'm using mine to selfishly do something I like, but have no long-term plan for. Who’s the smart one?”
“Come on, tiger. Let’s see what you’ve got.” Sherlock jumped up and scuttled as gracefully as he could on his blades to the swinging door of the rink, then pushed through and onto the ice. It wasn’t great ice; it was messy and slushy in sections, and the rentals were dull and heavy on his feet, but muscle memory kicked in and he found the rhythm to propel him forward.
Sherlock made a long slurping sound as he finished John’s shake. He put the cup down and discreetly burped behind his hand. “Okay. Good luck enjoying your fries when there’s no more ketchup.”
Mycroft sighs and turns to Anahera, who clutches the seaweed-wrapped mystery to her chest and looks about ready to bop Mycroft over the head with it. She doesn’t even know what she’s holding, but she’s protecting it. Sherlock adores Anahera.
“Sherlock, I know you’re afraid it’s going to hurt. I’ll do it with you, when you’re ready, okay? We’ll do it over time, a little at a time, whenever you want. It’s not going to happen all in one day.”
Thank you for taking this journey with me. To those of you who have been reading chapter by chapter, week by week, you have been such a loyal and enthusiastic group, and I am so grateful. To those of you who waited to start until I was finished, I hope you found it worth the wait.
“Dear God above. I don’t care if you’re covered in liquid gold. Clean yourself up and come to the parlour. John is here and we’re all waiting on you.”
"You are endangering the entire pack, little brother. Your nonchalance and lack of attention is a burden and an accident waiting to happen. We do not benefit from the safety of our perch on the ice now. We are surrounded by potential threats. If you are not watching for your safety, someone else must do it. If you are not watching for the safety of those around you, there is yet one more chance that they will be harmed."
Sherlock figured that John was too much a gentleman to tell Mrs. Hudson what he wanted to eat. “How about some pound cake?” he offered. “Do we have any of that left?” The sooner he gave Mrs. Hudson something to feed them, the sooner she’d move on to another project.
“You are as sexy as the strength of what I feel for you, and as sexy as the urgency of what you felt before, before when you said—”
John ran both hands through his hair and sniffed, rather angrily, if one can sniff angrily, then set his hands on his hips and licked his lips.
She'd finally stopped talking. Sherlock's head was still vibrating, from the talk of the blind date, or Mrs. Hudson’s driving, he wasn't sure.
John steps away to look Sherlock square in the eye, the tip of his tongue visible at the end of his bill. "You really see all of that, don't you?"
Sherlock could see the stars if he looked out the topmost part of the bedroom windows, thousands of them, astronomical balls of hydrogen and helium, unfathomable distant, naked, brilliant.
With one more small shift, Sherlock found it. He stopped, holding himself still with the head of John’s cock pressing into his prostate. Arms trembling, thighs shaking, he stared down at John, trying to form words.
. Sherlock is going to tell John this, right after he closes his eyes for a moment. The next thing he knows, he’s lifting his head off John's shoulder, and observing that the sky is much darker than it was when he closed his eyes.
“Yeah, I’d like that. I mean, I’m pretty sure we’re talking about the same thing, but to be clear, there’s nowhere on your body that I wouldn’t want to put my mouth. Nowhere.”
Thank you to happierstill, who once said she'd be a horrible beta, but has proven herself otherwise.
Before he went back to bed, he inspected himself in the medicine cabinet’s rectangular mirror. There was a bit of stubble coming in on the lower half of his face, and his hair was a nest of tangles and curls. His lips and eyelids were puffy, the first from kissing, the second from sleep. He found a love bite spreading under the thin skin of his neck, just above his collarbone, and when he ran his fingers over it, it felt warm and tender to touch. There was another one above his left nipple.
Sherlock sipped through the foam of his Chimay, holding John’s gaze. “I feel the same way. You know that, don’t you? I might not express it a lot, but you’re the only one in this great big world, as you put it, who could make me feel like that.”
A feather’s breadth later, Sherlock scoops the trembling chicks against his chest, and encloses them in his wings. He feels them shuddering into his belly, and sees that their eyes are still clamped shut. They have not let go of each other.
Tiny Bat John bit him. Sherlock missed the next several seconds, but then there was a ferocious fruit bat with a mighty boner flying right at his face, and the sound of Sherlock screeching like a toddler. He threw his arms up and around his head, hoping to not get any TBJ tangled in his curls. He recognized his mistake a moment later, but it was too late. Tiny Bat John was already under the sheet.
The question surprises Sherlock, who had not stopped to consider that it might not be an emperor egg. He runs his bill over it, too, although what this is supposed to tell him, he does not know. He has never before run his bill over an egg of any kind.
“You look beautiful, Sherlock. You are absolutely stunning standing there with our egg. I am the luckiest peng in the world.”
The late afternoon sun was setting on Baker Street. Sherlock hung his head over the side of the bed, his hair dusting the floor. John looked up from his stack of pillows, put his book down, and raised an eyebrow.
Going to the quarry had never posed problems before, but then John had gone and changed, and now the hair under his arms was thicker, and there was more leading down from his bellybutton, and between his legs. He smelled like sweat, but more than that, too, and Sherlock found it altogether intoxicating. He often missed entire sentences when John talked, lost in thought about where those smells emanated from, and how he might get closer.
The Junior pengs are huddled now, or something close to huddled. One by one, sometimes one by two, or two by three, they whisper pieces of the Moringa debacle to their carekeeper. Somehow, she assimilates their random bits of data, and strings them all together until she has the complete story. When it comes together in her mind, solid as a tale carved in ice, she appears to grow twice her size.
Over the next few days, Sherlock showed no interest in the invitation, or anything else in the pile. Perhaps, John thought, he needed a subtle prompt. He waited for Sherlock to make himself available, which meant flopping over on the couch, and facing the room for a brief interlude.
“Very informative. When the male, well, when he's ready to, you know, pass on his gift? It's like he has no choice. Like he has to do it.”
John stops in the threshold of their bedroom and leans against the door jamb, two mugs of tea in his hands, and takes in the scene before him. The simple room is filled with evidence of lazy morning lie-ins and cosy late nights, testament to the two of them lounging with books and newspapers, crossword puzzles, and back copies of the Scientific Beekeeping Journal. There are stacks of books on the bare, wide-plank floor, an antique dresser against one wall, and loosely folded jumpers in an open chest at the bottom of the wrought iron bed.
“Indeed, young sir. Elder Siger and I heard all the commotion, and have already been told quite a few interesting stories concerning your rescue from the
Sherlock reaches over and bridges the distance between them. He runs his hand down John’s side, from shoulder to wrist, and lets it come to rest on John’s hip.
“Arms, Armor, Medieval, and Renaissance. Okay. Back downstairs, through the Impressionist wing, and to the left.”
Mrs Hudson nodded approvingly. “Well, I’ll leave you to it, then. Get out of those damp clothes and warm up, you’ll catch your death with your hair and clothing all wet like that.” She patted him on the arm again and made her way to the door. “And let’s be sure the new coffee maker doesn’t succumb to any falls, shall we?”
“Indeed. The political climate being what it is, I would not be surprised if the government reaches that point within the next year or two.”
Sherlock rested his cheek on the palm of his hand and listened to John go on and on about the food. He wanted to kiss him.
Sherlock held his breath and waited as John slid forward and leaned down. He held his breath as John cupped the side of Sherlock’s face with one hand and moved closer. He held his breath as John brushed his lips across Sherlock’s, then he took a deep breath and tilted his head. John’s lips slotted perfectly between his own. They stayed there for a moment, bumping noses and playing with the angle, tasting each other with the tiniest of movements. When John opened his mouth a little more and licked Sherlock’s lower lip with the tip of his tongue, Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s neck and pulled him flush against himself.
Though he found it increasingly hard to sit and wait, Sherlock knew he had to allow Daniel to set up the second date, and then the third, as it was the only way for Daniel to set the scene to his exact requirements. He spent the following morning trailing Annette around the house and generally getting underfoot until she eventually sent him outside with a paint scraper and ordered him to work on the wood around the windows in advance of having two cousins, both handymen, come to do repair work.
“No, I really don’t. Come on. Come with me.” John nudges Sherlock back from the edge of the crèche, poking his wings into Sherlock’s ribs to get him to move.
John is smiling up at him, rolling his shoulders and sliding his elbows back on the bed, lowering himself so that Sherlock can undo his belt and flies. Sherlock traces John's torso from clavicle to the trouser clasp. John is warm and eager beneath him, open and inviting, all for Sherlock. All for Sherlock.
His brain, begging to differ, offered up a memory of John borrowing Sherlock's favorite Coca-Cola shirt, and Sherlock telling him not to wash it before he returned it. Ah, yes. Well. There was that.
Mycroft listens as they walk, spellbound, softly tutting at the most important parts of Sherlock’s tale. When Sherlock tells him about the heartstone, Mycroft stops walking and freezes, not moving even one filament of a feather.
“Well, no. I couldn’t. We were leaving shortly after I found it. Do you think that’s wrong, to want to examine it?”
“I’m an idiot. You shouldn’t love me that much. All of what you just said makes perfect sense, and I wish I had seen it that way, too. I wish it hadn’t been just a bit of fun for me, a silly gag about sex. It bothers me that I didn’t see beyond that. Everything you said comes from such a place of respect, and even if I didn’t show it tonight, I need you to know that I hold you in the highest respect. You’re right. What we do together is no one’s business. It’s beyond special.”
Sherlock stood up and kicked off his underwear, then helped John sit up. “I want you to do something for me now, okay?”
John’s lips are firm and warm, and they tremble when they press against Sherlock’s. Sherlock waits, unsure of what to do, and John presses again, trapping Sherlock’s lower lip between his, and he pulls, softly-softly, and bumps their noses as he does it again.
John leaned back in his chair with one elbow across the back, and squinted at Sherlock. “What else don’t I know?”
Sherlock chuckled. “Oh, you will. I’ve no doubt. Now, you and your driver should head into town and book rooms at the Fonab Castle Hotel. It’s not The Four Seasons but you’ll survive.”
Annette stood up and gathered the stack of dishes in her hands. “Nonsense. You’re on your honeymoon, there’s no need to cook for yourselves.”
John turns, considers. Sherlock's hair is slicked back, already reforming into curls. His lips are parted, wet. Now or never. "Try me."
Sherlock puffed up his cheeks and blew out a slow breath. He steepled his fingers and scrunched up the bridge of his nose. He leaned down over his lap, where Bat John was now pacing on his thigh, back and forth, his wings now folded up tight against his back in indignation, back and forth, knee to hip, hip to knee, knee to  … kind of groin.
Sherlock sucked raspberry coulis off the tip of his finger and tried not to leer. “Just you, John, in all the different ways.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. John was fiddling with a cup of coffee and a spoon but pushed it away long enough to get up and fetch a cup for Sherlock. He poured it full and pushed it across the table.
“Yeah. I do. Actually, you know what, let’s look at the grounds. There’s something I want to show you. I mean, I want you to see the house, too, but I want you to see this, first.”
“Erebus, that's it! That's what is different. The calling, the parade, it marked the culmination of everything John and I have worked and suffered for, of everything my shell spoke to when I was hatched.”
Sherlock watched the exchange. Annette didn’t seem at all surprised by John’s admission that he and James were barely in touch since the hearings. Annette, it seemed, was far more aware of what was going on in James’ life than either of them had realised.
“Don’t care what those plonkers usually say. They’re all wankers and idiots. You have this way of looking at me that just, I don’t know, it just makes me feel seen. Do you know what I mean?”
John talked with great animation and wide eyes, then would wind down with sagging shoulders and what looked like a deep sigh. At one point he counted off on his fingers, and Sherlock could imagine him listing his tuition, and rent, and books, and other university fees – all the things that kept him from being able to enjoy himself more.
He suspects they might find out, and soon. He wonders what the unopened letters say, if maybe Mary left her daughter more than a signature on a will, if she may have, perhaps, left an explanation. He wonders if Hannah will read them. He wonders if he wants her to, or not. He wonders if there is one for him.
John’s cock was long and thick and gorgeous and it was bobbing an inch from his belly. It was flushed a rosy pink, slightly darker along his foreskin, and it had prominent blue-tinged veins running the length of it. John was hard enough that his foreskin had partially retracted, and Sherlock could see the tulip-petal curve of his cockhead and the small slit at the tip. As he watched, a small bead of fluid ran out and dripped onto John’s stomach.
“I won't be able to sleep. I'll toss and turn and keep you awake and then we'll both be cranky. I don't like it when you're cranky,” he pouted, stopping when John planted himself directly in his path and wrapped his arms around him. He looked down into John's upturned face, scanned the worry lines and half-smile and determined expression around his eyes.
“I find myself unable to sleep, unable to concentrate. I find myself desperately in love with you, Sherlock. Sherlock?”
No, Sherlock hadn’t deduced the worst of John Watson upon meeting him, had he? Could he do it now? Probably. Somehow, though, he found he wasn’t at all interested in the worst about John Watson. No, he found himself quite curious about John and his complicated layers. And if the worst turned out to be that he had killed people in a wartime effort, or failed to save others, was that worthy of negative judgment? It was more fascinating than anything else. John Watson, pulling a trigger. John Watson, pulling thread through a suture site. John Watson, leaning on a cane he didn’t need, standing by his alcoholic sister, pursuing a date and potential spouse with a person many people would call a sociopath. In fact, some people had.
“Just leave the laundry to me, dear, and I’ll take care of it. There are fresh sheets on your bed and clean towels in the bathroom. We’ll have an early supper tonight because I’ve got bridge club at Kathy’s, okay?”
He steps back and turns to face the full length mirror, an antique oval that tilts on its frame, angled to capture his entire reflection. His hair is dishevelled, one wisp dangling seductively over his left eye. He let it dry naturally tonight, with no product, so that his chestnut curls are wild and untamed around his face.
Something tight ran through Sherlock's body, a tremor that arched his back and flexed his quads and stopped his breathing. When he could, he sucked down a deep breath and turned, bent at the waist, and pressed his palms flat to the wall.
“Smart lad,” John said, smiling downwards as he prepared to pull Sherlock’s extra shot. "You could try the Moka pot next time," John suggested. "I think you'd like it."
“How long do you think this will last?” she asks him, turning her head to be heard over the wail of the storm.
"That's right. He said, ‘Sherlock, what are we doing?’ And the most extraordinary person ever said ‘We appear to be having tea,’ and the doctor soldier said ‒"
“Cetus and Erebus, take Moringa to the huddle, and keep her there, in your sight. We will wait for the rest of the packs to arrive, and then we will depart for Pobeda.
When Sherlock walks with Anahera, they tend to keep to the periphery, looking into, and around the colony. Sherlock points out who is who, and deduces that which he does not already know about their neighbours. This amuses Anahera to no end, but when she tries it on her own, she does no better than John and his emp-aronis.
Olive murmurs again. Siger listens but shakes his head. “Sherlock, your shell spoke of a long journey and prophesied that you would be at the heart of much change. These things have come to pass.
Outside, Lake Michigan stretched long and wide. On the eastern horizon a thin band of orange began to push back the night, dragging dawn along in its wake. Sherlock rolled to his side and watched the sun rise over John. Light seeped into the open palm resting above his head, down the pale underside of his arm, toward the top of his head. He watched as the sun brightened his hair, the tips of his eyelashes, the tops of his cheekbones. It kissed John’s lips, which hardly seemed fair, so Sherlock leaned over, and kissed John's lips, too.
“Also, Cotter isn’t working alone. He’s behind it but he’s not the one who’s going to kill James. He's going to keep his hands clean.”
The moment Sherlock learned to climb out of his cot was the moment he realized he had choices. Every night his mother, father, or sometimes, if he was very lucky, his brother, would put him to bed, and every night he would pretend to fall asleep, wait for the house to settle into quietness, and then climb up, over and down, and begin exploring.
“That is a gross exaggeration, young lady. Besides, I am completely neutral in regards to Granddad's blueberry pancakes.”
John looked good. John always looked good, of course, but Sherlock had picked out his clothes tonight, pulling out his tightest Levi’s, most form-fitting black t-shirt, and a pair of well-worn sneakers. The cotton knit t-shirt strained over his body, defining those delicious pecs and biceps, and was tucked snug into his jeans, so when standing, Laffitte would get an eyeful of a rather impressive faded-denim encased bulge up front, and two perfect ass cheeks at the back. His hair was parted on one side, and flopped a bit over his forehead, which made him look even younger. John didn’t need any adornment. No jewelry, no tattoos, no fancy brand names on his clothing. John’s deep blue eyes stood out and drew people in, the way any of those other things might do for someone else.
John cracked one eye open and peered at Sherlock, then opened the other eye and smiled. “I see that, love. Why are you awake? It’s still pretty early, isn’t it?”
Sherlock reached between them, took John’s cock in his hand, and rolled the tip back and forth over his hole. John felt like satin against him, and round, and big. Very big.
He wouldn’t survive this if it'd been designed to provoke a reaction, something to jumpstart their atrophied friendship. Sherlock would drown in it.
John drummed his fingers on the table. “Okay, so then I guess I’d bring the french fries into the bedroom.”
John crossed his arms over his chest and frowned. “And that’s it? What about the footage from inside the house?”
“What I wanted to tell you is that tonight I am going to wear the last of my wedding garments to bed, just the g-string, and you are going to remove it for me. That’s my gift to you, John, and then, when we’re both free to touch each other wherever we please, we’re going to do exactly that. We’re going to touch each other and we’re going to consummate this marriage.”
Sherlock slid his hands into John’s front pockets, and kissed the spot right behind his ear. “You’re my man.”
John thumped his head against the mirror behind him and reached for the handrail. He shook his head back and forth and rolled his shoulders, not unlike a boxer dancing into the next round. Stepping out behind Sherlock, he dug into his pocket and retrieved the card. Sherlock was already pacing in front of the door by the time he got there.
“No, it’s a good thing. I just think it’ll take a while to undo the past ten years of assumptions on both our parts.”
The colony cheers and trumpets around them, and John hides his face in Sherlock’s neck before allowing Sherlock to hold up one of his wings in acknowledgment of their calls, and to wave his thanks. John looks overwhelmed by the attention, but bows gracefully to the Council before crowding up against Sherlock again.
John palmed Sherlock's ass with both hands, caressing in soft, smooth circles. His touch was light, but the effect was strong, a wave of arousal surging through Sherlock's body. He wanted more, more touch, more tongue, more John.
Peck's Feed and Grain is a real place in the real town I've set this in, but I couldn't find a picture of it anywhere.
John snagged Sherlock by a belt loop when he came near, and pulled him down to straddle his lap. “Well, I don’t actually know what you did last winter, but I spent a lot of time sending you texts and feeling sorry for myself.”
“For starters, finishing school. After that, it’s a bit complicated, but we need to decide if we wish to keep the farm, and if so, who will manage it. Mrs. Hudson, unfortunately, won’t be around forever, and I doubt you’re planning for a long-term career in corn and soy crops.”
“We are. We’re very, very lucky. Although this idiot spent a good year avoiding me before we finally got it together.”
Sherlock is about to step away, and go searching for his errant Johnling, when he hears it. He freezes in his tracks and angles his head toward the sound. He hears it again, long notes of love and promise reaching him from some distant place.
“John,” Erebus continues. “News travels fast. It also seems to grow and warp in an exaggerated fashion with each retelling. So, please do forgive us if we are not entirely convinced that you single-wingedly caught a bolt of lightning and used it to strike down an entire flock of skua.”
Tui and Anahera fuss over him, like two elders, even though they’re not really that old. They’re Mycroft’s age, just a bit younger, but they’re so different from Mycroft. They seem freer. Sherlock thinks this is what it would be like to have older sisters, instead of stuffy old Mycroft, then he chastises himself, because Mycroft is only the way he is because he has so much to take care of.
“I know. The thing is, we can't make that happen overnight. Even if we wanted to, it's too late to apply to Chicago for September. But we could apply for the second semester of junior year, starting a year from now. And that would give me time to figure out the money, and take any classes I'd need to transfer over.”
Within a few minutes, John was in bed next to him, on his side and facing Sherlock. Sherlock kept reading about Scone Palace as John moved closer and settled one hand on Sherlock's bicep. Sherlock had a hard time focusing on the history of the home as John began to lightly caress his arm. “John, we’re only forty minutes from Scone. We should go see the palace.”
“No, Māmā. It already did. The journey began when I understood that the tooth cannot give me what I do not already have.”
Some of the more supengstitious Pobedans are slow to warm to Anahera, influenced by ancient pengtales of the mischief and mayhem wrought by emperors wearing divergent coats. Others are quite eager to gain Anahera’s favour, imagining she can somehow bestow them with blessings and privilege. Though Sherlock bristles equally under ignorant censure and false platitudes, Anahera treats them all with kindness and respect. She tells Sherlock that over the course of her lifetime, she has come to understand that just as she is who she is, they are who they are, and there is little she can do to sway a staid mind. An undecided mind, however, will often blossom under a gentle touch.
It is a peaceful, quiet afternoon, on a crisp, sunny day, when Ariki and Kahu decide to collect stones and ice chips to practice their skipping skills. John and Sherlock stand halfway between them and a group of small chicks playing nearby, chatting and making sure no one wanders too far or needs assistance.
John rolled out from under Sherlock and turned to his side. “No. No, he did not. You said something that you probably shouldn’t have said, but you did not cause Victor to go home and tell his mother what you said, and you did not cause his mother to confront his father, and you did not cause Victor’s father to do what he did. That was his decision. An awful, awful decision, but his alone.”
Sherlock blinked at her, still thinking about the hankies. Kevin and Greg smiled at her and said, “Yes, please,” at the exact same time.
Sherlock nodded, not trusting himself to speak, emotions rising high under the cover of John's kindness.
has been around forever, and is super popular, crowded, and loud. I love sangria, very very very much.
Sherlock focuses only on Erebus, unaware of the pack around him. He and Erebus stay near the edge of the floe, removed from the others, as Erebus shares the details of the life he had with Selvic. They stay there for a considerable arc of the sun across the sky, but will have to leave soon to finish the rest of the journey to the floe’s mother, the Cassiopeia iceberg.
“Hey, I had an idea, remember? I want to finish what I started earlier.” John left a kiss on Sherlock’s lower lip, rolled his hips again, and began a slow journey down Sherlock’s body. Sherlock watched him go, intent on memorising the way John looked as he kissed each separate bit of his sprawled body. He captured little snapshots of John hovering over him, his eyelashes framing his cheekbones, the top of his head contrasted against the expanse of Sherlock’s chest, his lips pressing down on his nipples and into the hollow below his ribs.
"Mm, the freeness of it, I suppose. Getting lost in the music, no rules to follow. It can be, I don't know, transcending at times."
Sherlock tried his hardest not to go the color of beetroot at being accompanied home for their last afternoon together, but the heat radiating off his face told him he’d failed and failed hard. When Mr. Watson climbed out of the truck John slid over and took his place behind the wheel, so Sherlock slid over and took John’s place in the middle and put his hand on John’s thigh.
Pavo, Vela, and Lestra come home that spring, and share news of their travels with the Council. Lestra eagerly shares his stories with Sherlock and John, but Mycroft also takes the opportunity to meet with Sherlock and convey what he has learned since the three travellers have returned. He tells Sherlock that in spite of being called before the High Council, Moringa kept silent. They questioned, conferred, and deliberated, but Moringa would not speak.
Erebel shakes her head. "I think I’m the luckiest peng in the world to have you as my Pāpā. If you did those things, it just helps me understand why you are so amazing. It helps me understand how you are you."
He reaches down and holds the egg closer against him with one wing, holding out the other to soothe down John’s wing. When they can, they take deep breaths, and stare at each other, eyes wide.
Thank you, KA, for making 'in-your-pocket' jokes in the document, right alongside the corrections and suggestions. LOL.
“Neither do I. Maybe I shouldn’t have asked for what I did for my birthday, because now you’ll feel pressured to give it to me.”
Sherlock was dividing the photos into three piles: pre-John, post-John, and post-John-but-no-John. The criteria were simple. Was John in the photo? If so, it was post-John. If John was not in the photo, it was either pre-John or post-John-but-no-John, meaning the boys had known each other but weren’t photographed together. Sherlock was adamant that the pre- and without-John photos could go in the recycling bin, but John refused to hear it.
“Sherlock, I know we haven’t known each other for long, and I know there are still things to learn about each other. To be honest, I hope there always will be. It would be my greatest pleasure to have you as my own—”
John nodded at the purple-haired barista as she approached and said, as if he were ordering a nuclear missile, “One cappuccino.”
It was closer to eight o’clock by the time they’d unloaded the last of the boxes from Greg’s hatchback and Sherlock’s station wagon into the cargo elevator, and then pushed everything out into the hallway on Kevin’s floor. Sherlock was beginning to compare that final stretch to Kevin’s front door to planting a flag atop Mt. Everest; an epic accomplishment of untold heroics, to be sure, but probably unattainable. He stretched out on his stomach on the cushy carpet and urged the others to go on without him. Beyond, he heard Greg and Kevin disappear into the apartment.
Inside laid a black, old-fashioned doctor’s bag with the high sheen of the many polishes it had received over the course of its useful life.
John got up and Sherlock listened as he made his way to the other bedroom and stuffed all his clothes into his duffel bag, and he listened as he dragged his keys off the dresser and shook them, and he listened as he made his way down the stairs, opened the door, and closed it softly behind him, singing as he went. “
In this AU, Sarah Sawyer is from Davenport, Iowa, a small Midwestern town along the Mississippi River.
KarlyAnne, thank you for doing this one on the fly. Now, please don't look beyond this point - a gif is coming.
“John! Stop! You just told me everything was going to be absolutely fine! You cannot lose your mind right now, I will not allow it!”
Greg reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a business card. It was stark white, pristine. “Your brother gave me this after you guys left last night.”
They made their way back to the house, depositing the broken latch on a fence post before going inside. John, having already explored the rooms, let Sherlock wander, while he stood at a window and looked out over the back garden, and the hills beyond, and then, the sea.
“They’re divorced I think? He owns the chippy. Her brother lives with her. She’s always having rows with him over the phone in the back room. Is any of that helpful?”
“I’m not sure what there is to say, Mycroft. I understand why you feel the way you do. I understand why you don’t want to come home.”
They stand, side by side, and assess their destination. It has been the better part of a lunar cycle since they left Cassiopeia. Mycroft does not look at his little brother when he says, “You have done well, Sherlock. You have met, and exceeded, all of my expectations for this journey.”
“I do. Yes. It gives me more to hold on to when we … you know.” John glances down at the egg as if looking for ears to cover.
He scanned the list as John rummaged through the box. They were going to need two of everything because they both liked the same things. Except for magenta; that was just for Sherlock. And he supposed they wouldn’t have all the exact same placements. Sherlock would put the navy blue in his right pocket, and John would put it in his left. Well, until Sherlock’s birthday, anyway.
John got up and hustled through the bushes in the direction of his clarinet. Behind him he could hear Sherlock huffing and puffing. Truly, it hadn’t been that bad, had it? Sherlock was a musical snob, but he couldn’t have been that offended by John’s attempts, could he?
By the arrival of the next winter, arrangements have been made for the passing of one male’s gift to one female couple. The peng involved is a young adult, single, of good blood and education. At nine winters of age, he still does not feel a call to bond, and does not mind if he never does. After moons of searching and analyzing candidates, brokering the introduction was almost anticlimactic. Sherlock and John had left the three emperors to themselves to discuss the particulars, and then, two moons later, they had congratulated the new mothers upon the arrival of their chick.
The large cherrywood armoire Sherlock had used the year before still stood across from the bed and when he opened the doors he saw that Annette had added a few baskets at the bottom to aid in organising their clothing. He quickly unzipped his bag, pulled out the pillowcase-wrapped secret he’d packed back in London, and laid it in the bottom of one of the baskets. He added a stack of vests and pants over it, leaving the rest of the unpacking to finish later.
The Florida Keys are a string of islands at the tip of Florida. The last one, Key West, is haven for gay men of all ages. Also, Hemingway had a home there. I've toured it. It's cool.
“Shhh. You knew exactly what to do. It was perfect. You are perfect. But, we’re not done, Johnling.”
It is so much. It is the moment before diving into the sea, the instant before a sneeze, the tiny space before a yawn. Something has to give. Every part of him clamps down, squeezing hard on the throbbing at the centre him. Something, he does not know what, has to give.
Next, he picked up the box that he had created just that night for the conversation they'd had, the one where they’d danced around the question of a marriage proposal, with words like
John sighs, folds the paper into quarters, sets it on his lap. He looks straight ahead at the wall, not at Sherlock.
“I don’t think so.” Sherlock pressed his hips to John’s as if John was about to start designing lightning bolts in his pubic hair right that second.
John shushes him and kisses his jaw, then moves out from under Sherlock's canted leg so he can reposition himself between his splayed thighs. He's still for a moment, his hands running the length of Sherlock's calves, and then he says, “God, just look at you.”
The next night Sherlock brought his bed pillow to the sofa, along with his duvet, and made himself comfortable. He pretended he was reading a case file while surreptitiously sneaking peeks to where John worked in the kitchen, but John didn't seem to be paying attention. Soon after he heard the kitchen tap turn off and a chair being pushed back against the table, so he burrowed down further and ignored the urge to sneak more peeks.
Rudy held out his hand and Kevin grabbed it, letting himself be led away. He briefly glanced at Sherlock and John, then looked again, eyes going wide with recognition. “Oh, my God. Sherlock?” He didn’t wait for an answer before engulfing Sherlock in a tight hug, patting him on the back, and ruffling his hair.
There is complete silence. There is no movement. The wind has turned itself back to air, still and heavy over them.
Sherlock rolled over and pulled one of Mrs. Hudson’s crocheted blankets over him. “I don’t need anything, John. Really.”
“Stop. Dear God, you are gorgeous and completely breathtaking, and I love every single bit of it. Every single bit. Turn around. Let me see.”
John kissed the top of Sherlock’s head before saying more. “He was my commanding officer. We spent a lot of time together because I was responsible for updating him regularly on the progress of the men I’d treated. There were a lot of late hours because it was hard to find time during the day. We got to know each other, sharing stories from back home, that kind of thing.
Sherlock grinned so hard he was pretty sure he’d just set a new double-triple-quadruple chin record. “Yes. So then I decided it would make more sense to do it—to douche—immediately after I had, um, you know, evacuated.”
The fourth day of their acquaintance finds them farther from the heart of the colony than either has gone before.They are high up on an ice formation, one that takes a long time to ascend for such young penguins, with much sideway shuffling and belly crawling to traverse. From this vantage point they can see the colony below them, small dots of black and white moving about in lines and clusters; they see the ocean beyond, speckled with white caps, floes, and icebergs; they see the glow of the moon behind her blankets of dense skycloud. She is low, but rising. They have a few more hours until curfew.
“Yeah, me, too. Each year I say I’m going to be better organized, start in November, finish sooner, and each year, I’m down to the wire.” Sarah poked around in her foil-wrapped, tortilla bowl of rice, beans, and chicken, and scooped up a mouthful.
“I wanted to talk to you about it this weekend, but I was afraid that you would shrug it off, say it didn't matter, that it was all fine. But it does matter. It matters very, very much.”
John growls and strokes Sherlock's neck and hip with his wings. “Sherlock … This isn't good. This is really just a bit not good.”
Tighter and tighter, higher, Sherlock fucked. He felt John's fist squeeze between them, knew he was stroking himself, pumping.
“I’m sorry, Tui. That wasn’t very funny, was it? No. But, it will be the best gift ever for John, and me, and you, and Anahera. And for Erebus, too. It will be a legend coming full circle. It will be a sign of hope, the end of one age, and the beginning of the next. We were told that the burden of finding the next
John licked his lips and nodded. “Hell, yeah. And that was all fine when we were little and didn’t know what we were doing. For a while there I thought you couldn’t be an effective goalie if you weren’t tackling your opponent to the ice whenever he got within ten feet of the net.”
“I'm not going to do anything,” Sherlock continued, “except line myself up, and then you can take over. Sit up just a bit.” He watched John's face as he lifted his erection and slid the head along John's perineum. When they were aligned, Sherlock held himself in place and said, “All yours.”
“All right. I’ll be back tomorrow morning at ten. I made a shepherd's pie for your dinner, it’s in the fridge.”
"Jason? Hold on one moment." Sherlock held the phone away and hissed at John. "What on earth are you ... ow! For the love of ... what ..."
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak and made a great gurgling sound. Apparently, he was crying. John wiped the back of his sleeve over Sherlock's eyes and under his nose and pulled him down off the couch into a crouch and into his arms.
“Is it?” John kisses behind Sherlock’s ear and presses his chest to Sherlock’s. One of his wings has slid down Sherlock’s side, and rests on his hip.
“I can't tell you what will or will not happen in the future, love, but the two of you have something special. You always have. Protect it and cherish it. Don't ever take it for granted, and don't take each other for granted. Be good to each other and never stop talking to each other. You're in a wonderful place right now, Sherlock, but you will have rough times. You will fight, you will get mad at each other. That doesn't mean it's over.
Not much more time passes before Sherlock hears the sweep of tail feathers over ice, and they all turn to watch the progression of the High Council, in elegant single file, approach the grounds. No one says a word as they pass, twelve of them, twelve emperors of distinction, each of them bearing the nature of their responsibility like an invisible cloak, heads held high, chests wide, wings straight by their sides. Sherlock wishes John could see this. He tries his best to memorize every detail of their forbearance and civility, their grace and fortitude. Rarely has he seen a sight as impressive as the Intercolonial Emperor High Council.
Sherlock crossed the room and stood near the bed, toying with the belt of his robe. Now that he was here, in the empty house, in the moment, he felt unsure of how to proceed.
“Dearest young pengs, I do apologize. I neither meant to startle you, nor worry you, when I approached the crèche, but I am glad that I intervened when I did.
“So, basically, what I hear you saying,” Mycroft says in some odd mimicry of one of Vela’s lectures on
“Drinking Champagne from a glass tends to impede the flow into one’s mouth, therefore, I recommend we continue as we’ve started.” Sherlock took another swig and gave John the bottle. Another server appeared out of nowhere with two Champagne flutes, but Sherlock waved him away, grabbed a second bottle from behind the servers’ station, and beckoned for John to follow.
Sherlock bent low and John twisted around so they could kiss. Sherlock kept his eyes closed, and when the kiss ended he could feel John trailing the tip of his nose up and down Sherlock’s cheekbone.
of each explosion in his chest, his adrenaline reaching a peak as the last blasts blazed, leaving nothing but a trail of smoke high over the still water, and the cover of darkness where there’d been light.
“Yes, I suppose it will be. Well then, we can rest some other time. It doesn’t matter. I don’t mind being tired if we are tired together.”
Sherlock leaned forward and ran the tip of his index finger over the back of John’s hands. “Okay. So, we’re going back to Sidetrack tonight at 10:00. Lestrade called Laffitte and told him that you called him first thing this morning to tell him how horribly you felt about what happened, and that you wanted to meet up to apologize. He said that Laffitte didn’t even question it.
We have been stuck on December 21 for three chapters now. Every time I sit down to write a new chapter, I think this will be the one that ends with them on their way to Chicago. My god, what am I doing? What if this story isn't done by the time they have spring break?
“You’re going to regret that,” Sherlock said as John reached into the box of donuts again. “We think we might head back tomorrow, actually. We’ll have been here two full weeks, which is what we planned on, and that’ll give us about a week and a half at home before John drives back to school. I don’t start again until the 24th, but I might head back a few days early.”
Next to her, Tui waits patiently. As soon as Anahera pauses for breath, Tui steps forward, and holds one wing up in front of Anahera’s bill.
. He bows down low. He holds the pose until the wave of emotion that threatens to topple him has crested, and passed him by, then he stands, kisses John one more time, and joins Mycroft at the precipice.
“I know we will. I know.” John bumps and rubs his cheek along Sherlock’s neck before pulling back enough to look him in the eye. “Only me for you, and only you for me.
“I’m basing it on a guess.” John smiled at what he could see of Sherlock’s face, hidden behind a flop of hair and the curve of his arm. He traced one unruly eyebrow with his thumb, and kissed Sherlock’s elbow. “Does it ever bother you that I'm not as smart as you?”
“You, my pengheart, only you. You are my greatest weakness. I lose all sense when it comes to what I would do for you.” John slides his wings up and down Sherlock’s, and turns his head so they are cheek to cheek.
Sherlock put his glass down with a loud clink and scowled. “How dare you talk about yourself that way!”
“But she didn’t,” Sherlock interrupted. “She’s fine. She’s more than fine. You should be thanking her. She accomplished far more than any of your own incompetent team.”
”Mrs. Hudson got a washcloth and water and tried to bring the fever down that way. We opened the window. You were—you were hallucinating, and the fever wouldn’t come down. I was terrified that you wouldn’t be alright.”
Sherlock bends at the waist, angling himself toward the mirror of the vanity, the edges of the marble top pressing into his thighs. Just a few more touches and he'll be done, dressed and ready for John's birthday. He glances down at the small pots and brushes scattered across the surface in front of him, and chooses a small round container of the palest violet eye cream. He dips the tip of his pinky in carefully, not wanting to use too much, and pats the colour onto one eyelid, then the next. He steps back to examine his work, and dabs on a bit more in the creases and at the outer corners. It's slightly iridescent, and he thinks it works well with the almost grey of his irises.
They eventually made it to the curb, and John put the truck in neutral and pulled the handbrake on. Sherlock had one hand on the door handle and the other on his carry-on strap. He stared straight ahead.
“Please. The last thing we need is for you to start drinking strong water. Your brain is magnificent, Sherlock, let’s not try fermenting it.” He tugs Sherlock along with increasing urgency, and it dawns on Sherlock that John is quite keyed up.
Sherlock felt the act through his entire body, a wave of warm, wet intimacy that wreaked havoc on his nerve endings and jerked at his muscles, his abdomen going tense and tight. He saw it in his mind’s eye as well, saw the precise movement as clearly as an arrow finds its bullseye, a bullet claims its target, a laser marks its claim. Immediately his brain began to battle with his body, feeding him thoughts and tangents that tied John’s actions to the broader reality of the last several days.
Sherlock has a moment of vertigo, and thinks he’s about to slip and go down on the ice, hard, but John’s wings are around him, more secure than the most ice-locked continent in the universe.
“Stop it. You’re obsessing about this, I can tell. We’re going to go out and have fun. It’s the first Saturday night of the year, we’re in Chicago, we’ve made a couple of friends, and we’re going to have a few drinks and dance and come back here and then I’m going to have my wicked way with you. Again.”
Sherlock crawled to John’s side and sucked his cock into his mouth. He bobbed up and down, once, twice, three times, then popped off and crawled to John’s shoulder, gave him a sloppy kiss, turned around, and straddled his face. John was reaching for him before Sherlock had even gone to his elbows, his mouth working Sherlock’s dick despite the awkward angle.
If John is annoyed at him during the day, and Sherlock deduces that he is, he sheds that annoyance the moment they’re tucked up together, belly-to-belly, bill-to-bill, under the constellations. Then, with their wings wrapped around each other, with no need for respectable distances, they can murmur mythology, and whisper words of adoration, until John snuggles up under Sherlock’s wing, and falls asleep.
Sherlock waggled his eyebrows at John and John smirked. “Sorry, it’s not that kind of surprise, not right now, anyway.”
It will be Monday in twenty minutes, so I'm going to do myself a favor and post this now, so that I can wake up tomorrow with nothing at all standing between me and a mental breakdown.
Sherlock wondered what it would be like to lie down and look out the windows over the bridges of the Chicago River, past the bridges, past the Loop and the Near West Side and Greektown, toward the flat expanse of suburbs and exurbs reaching toward the horizon. Past that, he imagined you could squint and imagine broad swaths of farmland fading into Iowa.
John moves closer while Sherlock talks about following the star, and brushes his wing, then moves even closer, and presses their bellies together. Sherlock loses track of where he was in the story a few times, especially when John starts nuzzling his neck, but John says, “Mmhm, keep going, tell me more,” so Sherlock tries, but then John slides his wing up under Sherlock's wing and strokes his side, and Sherlock loses his place again.
Sherlock runs the tip of one finger along the taut ribbon drawn across his hips. “And it wouldn't look good here, either, would it?” He palms his rigid cock now, and rolls his hips, the movement forcing the plump, pink head up and out of the scrap of material. “Oops. These really are too small.”
Short and choppy, but after reviewing what we wrote, bittergreens and I have decided (with much flailing) to continue this theme in a separate, co-written fic. I am very much looking forward to that!
James neatened the newspaper pages in his hands and put them on top of the other sections on the table. He leaned back in his chair and crossed one leg over the other. “Nothing important. I was sure I’d left some agency folders here the last time I visited but I can’t find them now.”
“Right. So, you're going to clean up around here, yeah? I'm going to take a walk. I may take a nap, later, too. What time is our reservation?”
“Hudi, please prepare a pouch that can be secured to Sherlock’s body, and within which the tooth will remain secure.
Sherlock shook his head back and forth, bumping his sweaty cheek into John’s nose. “No, I’ll be okay, we don’t have to leave. I know you were looking forward to this. I’m sorry, I’m ruining it, I’ll ‒”
“Yes. Exactly. In case an ex-boyfriend of the host followed through on a threat to, you know, be threatening. Although, it seems that everything is under control now. Anyway. Stay! Have a drink! Have an egg roll!”
and you move and move and move and move and there are people behind us in the queue now but still you don't stop
Sherlock pushed himself away from the desk, pounding heart yanking him back into the here and now, and went to find out what John was hollering about. Having grown up on a working farm, it took a lot to disturb John.
“He ordered the same thing. He’s probably attempting to create a bond through shared interests and preferences. What did you drink?”
The house was quiet, and still, as if it had been long ago abandoned. In a way, he supposed, it had. Lord knew Mrs. Hudson had worked hard to maintain the illusion that a family still dwelled there. He and Mycroft were lucky, so very lucky, that their parents had completed and filed legal documents he hadn't even known existed, long before they died. Mrs. Hudson had legal guardianship of the Holmes’ brothers, and the farm, and she had taken the role to heart, and made them her own.
“You have something … a small crumb … right there,” Sherlock said, pointing to John’s lower lip. John poked his tongue out but missed it.
He will not apologize for not telling Erebus and Mycroft sooner that he had found the tooth, because his time alone with it led him to understand that he cannot choose a course of action by himself, not if he is to respect the colony, and its deeply rooted teachings of community. He has learned so many things this summer, he ends, but the most important lesson is that Aumārire is theirs to take, not theirs to wait for.
Sherlock ran a finger through the damp and curling hair around John’s ear. “I like watching you fall apart. I can’t watch you if I’m coming, too.”
John picked up speed, gaining confidence that he wasn’t going to hurt Sherlock, and that he wasn’t going to shoot off just yet. He could feel it building again, could tell there was still so much more pleasure to come, and he grunted, short, choked-off sounds, and started pounding into Sherlock.
“Almost correct. Emperor eggs are not round. They are narrower at one end than the other. If dropped, the egg will roll in a circle, back to you.”
Sherlock blinked. John sniffed. Kevin broke into a huge grin, grabbed the Rorschach inkblot bottle off the counter, and held out his arm. “Please, Greg. After you.”
The dream was ending, a hazy collage of improbabilities fading back into Sherlock’s subconscious. He opened his eyes and rolled over. John. John was right there next to him, warm, so warm, one cheek flattened against the pillow he’d wedged into the crook of his arm.
Sherlock was grateful to be on safe ground again. “Everything here is excellent. And, if there’s something you want that’s not on the menu, Angelo can probably make it.”
John's cock was satin on Sherlock's lower lip. He let the head rest there, feeling its weight, then he brought the tip of his tongue out, and dabbed into the slit.
“Did too. Then I went for a run, grabbed some pizza, came back, and took a shower. And I got you something. Hold on.”
The Shelf is high and vast, and there are penguins everywhere. After so long at sea, just the two of them, Sherlock finds it disconcerting to be surrounded by so many others. There are not only emperors, but king, Adélie, rockhopper, gentoo, chinstrap, and macaroni, all marching home to their rookeries for the impending winter.
John followed, still grinning, and when they were upstairs and in the bedroom Sherlock waved his hand around in vague circles and said, “Walls, floor, new mattress,” and let John push him back onto that bed and climb on top of him.
“How did it go with the photo sorting, then? John said you were going to go through the shoebox of the ones he didn’t use in your album.”
He does this with a straight face, and concludes by saying that she was not included because she would have nothing to contribute, given her age. He stops short of calling her a penggeriatric.
Sometimes we write about the things we wish we had, especially when it seems highly improbable we'll ever have them.
As Sherlock talks, John relaxes into Sherlock’s wings, and starts to rub Sherlock’s cheek, and return his affection. He listens as Sherlock talks about how much he has missed him, and when Sherlock stops, John nods, and pulls back to see Sherlock’s eyes.
The feathers around John’s neck have turned golden yellow, forming a vivid band just under his chin, fading softly into the white of his chest. From there down, and under his wings, John’s feathers gleam a glossy, pure white. The sides of John’s neck, behind his eyes and over his ears, have bright, bold fans of orangey-yellow, which dramatically frame John’s eyes and face.
“So, basically, what I hear you saying,” Mycroft says in some odd mimicry of one of Vela’s lectures on
Sherlock nods just once. “You’re always welcome here, John. Mrs Hudson can get your room ready. You’ll need to bring the crib, but there might not be space for the changing table. Will you let your place, or sell it? You can move back as soon as you’d like. That … that would be … good. Yes.” Another curt nod.
"Sorry, Jason. As I was saying, John was under the impression that you and I were in my bedroom, partaking in a more ..."
“However you want. Your wish will be my command. Should I make a list of options with checkboxes?” John giggled, and Sherlock squirmed some more. “Please choose from the following appetizers: kissing, fondling, licking, groping, tweaking, stroking of the following body parts: lips, ears, neck, shoulders, nipples, belly, hips, all areas of the thighs, backs of knees, ankles, toes, dick, balls, ass cheeks, crack and hole.
Sherlock flipped through the rest of the photos, and pulled one out. He studied it for a moment, then passed it to Greg. “Here. This was my family, before my parents died.”
Sherlock thought Tiny Bat John might stay there and glare at him all night, but then the most scientifically curious thing happened. His adorable ears twitched, and his eyes grew even more round, and his nostrils flared. His whole little body spasmed, and his miniature jaw went lax.
“It’s your neck, Lestrade. Have fun, you two.” The bouncer waved them past and reached for the next person’s ID.
John was lying by his side, his hip pressed against Sherlock’s thigh. He was flat on his stomach, arms crossed under his cheek, muttering vague complaints to no one in particular about too much turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes. Sherlock ran his hand over the small of John’s back, little circles, squiggly lines, and let the dozy heat from John’s body spread up his fingers and further into his heart.
“But about working with Moringa, I truly don’t know. I have never observed them together, but perhaps I was not looking carefully enough.”
He turns and looks up at Cassiopeia’s peak, then tracks lower, to the ice cave. He can see a sliver of its window from where he stands. He and John aren’t allowed up there anymore without a chaperone, but is that to keep them from the temptations inherent in such a private place, or to keep them away from something else? What was Moringa doing in the ice cave? Or was she somewhere else? Are there other places on the berg that she would have tried to reach? Why?
"Do you ever feel bad that we can't fly anymore? I mean, can you imagine what that would be like? To move that fast, and be that free?"
Sherlock carries this euphoria with him well into the afternoon and early evening. He does not find Anahera, and so is positive that John has. When he goes back to Tui, she reports that John has been back twice to see if Sherlock and Anahera had returned, and then had left again. Sherlock smiles and hugs her and escorts her back to the huddle. He does not join in, not yet. He will wait for John.
“I'm not as bad as Papa, though, so he should take a bath, too, with his trousers on. His trousers ate his ice cream.”
He was down to his long-sleeved Coca-Cola shirt when John came out of the bathroom, looked up from taking off his watch, and said, “God, Sherlock.”
Mr. Watson put the key in the ignition, started the truck, and pulled out of the lot. The next time he spoke, Hank was a topic long past. “Sherlock, I hope you don’t mind, but John here told me about the way Mycroft has been managing your trust fund, God bless that you ever had reason to have one in the first place, and I had a few thoughts for you.”
The only thing they didn’t agree on was what Greg should do with his future. Tired of the club security scene, Greg was ready for his next big thing. Armed with a liberal arts degree, Greg figured he could do just about anything outside of the sciences, which was fine with him. He wouldn’t mind going back to school for the right thing, but would need scholarships or loans to pay for it.
“I was going to make a joke about you doing me whenever you want, but I think right now you need a soft bed, strong hands, and some quiet. Am I right?”
Sherlock breathed in John's sharp smell, filled his nose with the mingled scents of their sweat and arousal. John spread his thighs to better bear his weight and arched back. He reached underneath himself. “Where are you?”
Sherlock crawled into John’s lap and John hugged him tightly. “I’ll help, if only to get him out of here as soon as possible.”
Siger dismisses the meeting, and the pengs start to move along, to tend to whichever task they have been assigned.
Next to him, Sherlock realizes that the story is spinning in a rather personal direction, and wonders if it’s too late for him to sneak away before Janine reveals his and John’s role. He takes a tentative step backward, but John’s wing tightens around his back.
“Do you know what the sequence of events will be? Will they allow me to speak first?” Sherlock can feel the impatience flowing in his veins. What if they have some ridiculous, prescribed process that impedes his ability to leave by the day after tomorrow? What if they insist he stays for the duration? What if the duration is something ghastly, moons and moons long? What if ‒
“That’s actually in part what I wanted to talk to you about. I’m hoping you can do me an enormous favor. You’re so well-respected in this community, and I wondered if you could lend me some of that renown at school. You see, every year I have to teach a health unit to two of the grades, as required by law. I’m sure you remember from when John and Sherlock were in school.”
John pursed his lips and looked up at Sherlock with an exaggerated squint. “Mmhm. I see how it’s going to be.”
John laughed and stroked his thumb over Sherlock’s ear. “I don’t know. I suppose the labels don’t really matter unless they help someone figure out why they feel a certain way. I haven’t ever really thought about my own orientations, but if I had to pick something I’d say I’m a bisexual homoromantic, meaning I’m sexually attracted to men and women but generally only feel romantic connections with men.”
Sherlock cried, and the crying unsettled him even more, because he wasn’t really a crier. When you have so much to cry about, he’d always thought, it’s best to just do it once, and then move on, or you’d never do anything but cry. Now he was making up for lost time, and it felt like he would never stop, and it was occurring to him that he’d spent so many years moving on, maybe he’d moved too far, and that was a horrible thought.
This must be the one, Sherlock thought. The man was near perfect. His picture showed a fit, good-looking man with dark hair, clear skin, and a genuine smile. Why would John not have picked Daniel? Daniel was a poster child for the AMP, a veritable golden child that anyone would be happy to bring home to their family.
Sherlock carried the vacuum downstairs and tucked it away, then stepped into the kitchen. John looked up from his sexual respite at the table and gave him a questioning look. Sherlock pouted and shook his head. He pointed at the newspapers piled up near the door and John nodded.
“And she loves Janine, they love each other very much, but they still very much would like to have a family, but of course they cannot have a family without the male gift –”
John’s hand was firm and hot against the nape of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock had no idea what his own hands were doing. There was just his mouth on John’s mouth, and the tip of his tongue being incredibly brave and fresh and reaching out to touch the tip of John’s tongue. The contact was delicious and completely to the exclusion of everything else in the world. Sherlock was sure he couldn’t come up with one single thought other than John’s mouth.
Sherlock could not have cared less about the parameters for a date, nor did he care if he went on one or not. His understanding was that most dates could be better defined not by where and how they were allowed, but by the words schmoopy, goopy, fondling, and a waste of precious time. He was, therefore, pleasantly surprised when John showed up in an older model Range Rover instead of a limo and took him to a Funk and Soul concert at Camber Sands Holiday Camp in East Sussex, instead of the recommended London Symphony Orchestra. There were waffle fries instead of caviar, beer instead of champagne, ice cream instead of chocolate-dipped strawberries, and a tattered blue and green tartan blanket instead of red velvet chairs.
“Life got busy, love. We had your Mama to raise, and I was busy doing doctor things, and then we moved here.”
“He's here,” Mycroft says, putting an end to Sherlock's distraction. Sherlock looks up in time to see Siger sail out of the water, clearing the edge of the landing shore in a high, graceful arc. One after the other, they come, leaping and sliding across the ice. It is a far different homecoming than the one that started their summer.
"You absolutely ate ice cream last night. I sat right there," he jabbed a finger toward his armchair in the front room, "and you sat right there," jab jab, "reading the sports section of The Guardian, and I watched you eat ice cream. I saw you."
“John, they’re in the kitchen, they’ll know what we’re doing.” He mentally slapped himself for implying that John should stop. John should never stop. John should be encouraged to play with him all the time, anytime.
“Tied! What do the rules say about breaking a tie? Do neither of us get our ask, or do we both? It's such a waste!”
“She is right,” Sherlock says, his voice hushed. “You are, and you would. You are intelligent, brave, handsome, strong, compassionate, kind, generous, creative, funny –”
“The stranger has come to talk to the High Council. He is young, only one winter old, but he has come to stand in front of the twelve most important pengs in emperor society, and he approaches this as if it is not only his duty, but his pleasure. You realize that he was born to carry out the very thing he has come to do.
“I’m open to trying both. All three, actually, because if we’re not side by side then there’s an opportunity for us to take turns being on the top and the bottom.”
John nodded again, swallowed again. “Well, that’s the thing. I was, well, I was actually thinking that maybe we could do it the other way.”
all over my new woolen breeches and I look forward to making you lick it up as soon as we get to the sassafras stall
Pressed together, arms stretched down between them, Sherlock gave himself over completely. Forearms brushing, fists bumping, they found a rhythm that drove them forward, together. Slick noises filled the air, harsh, rasping breaths that evolved into drawn-out groans and muttered profanities. Rising tension stripped away basic functioning; kisses broke apart, eyelids shuttered and breathing faltered, fists twitched and tightened.
Sighs and hums joined the hiss and crackle of the fireplace, and the small group began to stir, to rally toward sitting, then standing, then hugging goodbye, pulling on their coats, gathering their piles of gifts, and drifting out into the white wonderland of Christmas night.
“I’ll remind you now of what Kororā said to Apo before returning to the heavens with Pono’s lifeless body and their unhatched chick:
He and John spend long evenings under those same stars, going over the day’s stories. Side to side, or with John leaning back against Sherlock, they look above, and trace the constellations’ lines and angles with their wings, and whisper the whys and hows of the legends.
They spent Christmas Eve the way they had done for the past ten years, crowded into the Watson’s living room, loading cold salads, deli meats and cheeses, relishes, and bread rolls onto paper plates, then clearing that away to make room for platters of Italian Christmas cookies, Polish kolachy, and Mrs. Hudson’s famous rum balls.
“It’s never the ones you’d expect, son, believe me,” the detective interjected. He looked tired, Sherlock thought, but kind. He gave John a brief pat on the shoulder and disappeared out the front door.
John barked out a laugh just as their drinks arrived. The waiter slapped down two Delirium Tremens beer mats, set their beers down, and pivoted back into the crowd.
Sherlock watches Erebel respond to the story. He observes the way she perks up, standing tall, as Janine describes the great adventure and the discovery of the heartstone. He watches the way she fluffs her feathers in excitement when their hero returns home to be reunited with his
Sherlock choked on his pie, and without missing a beat, Mrs. Watson poured him a glass of water and handed it to him.
“Sherlock,” John said again, crossing the room to stand in front of him. “Thank you. I know that wasn’t easy for you. I wouldn’t have asked it of you, but that you did it on your own means the world to me.” He reached out and squeezed Sherlock’s shoulders, then pulled him forward into a hug.
“Shame you couldn’t go ahead with him, but we should be to the berg tomorrow. And I guess Maryle is keeping him good company now.”
“You’re not bad at anything, John. I’m ninety-eight percent sure, with a point-oh-five percent margin of error, that you’re perfect. I’ve run the numbers.”
“Of course,” he croons, and Sherlock wants to vomit cephalopod. Instead, he grumbles under his breath, and rolls his eyes when Maryle shoots a vicious glare in his direction.
will be taken seriously." She turns to make her way toward the Council grounds, effectively ending the conversation.
“Not so much as constantly as we do now, but as strongly as we do now,” he said, keeping his thoughts of forever to himself.
Sherlock bends down as low as he can, curving his neck and twisting his head to meet John’s gaze. “Okay, I’m here. What?”
Sherlock nibbled on a parmesan breadstick and considered John's words. He wasn’t especially attached to the idea of eating regular meals, but he could see the appeal if it meant someone, say, someone with rounded forearms and stocky thighs and all-the-blue eyes, was doing the looking after. Not that he needed looking after. Lord knew he had enough people poking their noses into his business. Interfering gits, all of them. He didn’t think John was a git, though, and he quite liked his nose.
How will this even work? How will they introduce themselves? To whom will they introduce themselves? Is there a docket? A waiting list? Are matters ranked by some rating of perceived importance? What if they –
Sherlock’s slow unravelling is only halted by the fact that eventually, they must go to sleep, and if they must go to sleep, they must huddle, and if they must huddle, he must attach himself to John the way a barnacle attaches to a whale: with no intention of ever letting go.
He stops when he can hear as well as see them, the claws on their feet scratching and pushing against the ice, their wings sweeping them closer. He stops and he looks, and John is almost there, and oh gods he is so beautiful. In the four moons they’ve been apart, John has matured fully into adulthood, bursts of colour augmenting his stark black and white. Sherlock wants to inspect and catalogue every single change, but there’s no time now, not one moment to spare.
Sherlock peered at him from his just-home-stance in the bathroom doorway, and chewed on his bottom lip. Pasty complexion, blue-black circles under sunken eyes, heaving breaths, hunched posture. Sherlock was just about to announce his deduction – food poisoning – when John vomited with great force into the toilet he was hovering over. Perhaps, then, the deduction would not be necessary, or welcome. Sherlock stepped into the bathroom and wrapped an arm around John's shaking shoulders.
The doctor sat down next to Mummy, pushed her glasses back up the bridge of her nose and said, “Tell me about young Sherlock's bedtime routine.”
John spits and rinses, then leans back against Sherlock and catches his eye in the mirror. “It's all those old photos, I think, making me feel sentimental.” He gives Sherlock a small smile and turns in his arms, leaning back against the sink. Sherlock runs his hands down John's arms and back up, a calming gesture that John has used on him innumerably over the years.
are. They're 4,000 years old and it’s thought that the people who erected them visited the stones on the first day of May each year.”
Sherlock agrees, but can’t find it in himself to give a tail feather about the sun, not when there are stolen, legendary seal teeth to consider. Still, he won’t rush Erebus, who is older, and has been through so much, and finds such comfort in a spot of sun. He waits, and he waits, but after fifteen entire heartbeats, he can wait no more.
Apo stood down, unappeased, and the couple took flight, swooping and gliding in a dance of joyful pursuit until they were no longer visible. With Kororā at her side, Pono flew.
John smiled and took Sherlock’s face in his hands, kissed his pouty lower lip. “Always. I’ve always wanted to say it.”
“Here you go. Eat up.” John pulled off his own gloves and hat and sat down across from Sherlock. He plucked a pastry off the plate, took a big bite, and groaned as he chewed. “God, that's good.”
Moringa's feathers are standing erect, almost perpendicular to her body, and Sherlock imagines he can feel the waves of indignant heat rolling off of her. Next to him, John's wing has stopped its incessant tensing, and is lying, relaxed, against his own.
Sherlock loves this change the most, and indulges in it now. He leans forward and slides his cheek up and down the sleek side of John's neck. John trills a low sound of encouragement, so Sherlock does it again, and again. Soon they are entangled, neck to neck, chest to chest. John's wings stroke Sherlock's sides, and Sherlock's flutter and caress over John's shoulders.
It was as if James didn’t exist at all. Sherlock knew the man tried to keep a low profile and didn’t want to be a bother to anyone, and he assumed his background in the military had created strict habits of tidiness, but the lack of any sign of occupancy left Sherlock unsettled.
Sherlock and John switch places, and John presses himself flush against Sherlock. Sherlock must admit, it's very cozy. John runs his wings up and down Sherlock's sides, and within no time at all Sherlock feels himself relaxing, and slipping into sleep.
Sherlock stared, eyes wide, transfixed by John falling apart on top of him, and then, entirely as a second thought, he reached down between them and experimentally took hold of and squeezed John's bollocks. For one short second he thought that perhaps John had gone into cardiac arrest, and he snatched his hand away, startled and contrite. The first splash of hot come on his chest landed with a jolt of clarity, and he let out an awed
Sherlock sneaks back to the crèche before the sun comes up. Before he can share his epiphany with John, however, he needs his very angry
“Shh. I don’t want you to go out with him. I want you to make him think that. Lead him on, inflate his ego, and then when he propositions you, we’ll have proof that he solicits men for sex. We’ve been over this.”
Greg dialed himself, handed the phone back, and tapped his phone silent when it rang. “You really think that might work?”
John kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck, and the warm spot he left tingled and spread over Sherlock's skin. John sighed and his breath ruffled Sherlock’s hair, and then he pressed his toes to Sherlock’s Achilles heels and Sherlock opened his eyes and smiled into the darkness. Leaving the day behind and succumbing to the darkness could be such a lonely affair. He’d never realised before what a solitary venture it was, not until he had someone next to him. Falling asleep with John felt like a journey to look forward to, not a necessity that his body and brain needed to function.
Again, Cetus appears to stifle a laugh. “Ah-hm. Yes, indeed. Sherlock, exploration is natural. Enjoy yourself. It is not inappropriate or improper, but no, as far as I am aware, there is no way to dampen those feelings. I have, in the past, found certain marine components to reduce hunger during the long moons of incubation, and to revive airflow after a near drowning, but I have yet to find something to alter the emotions or outcomes of reproduction. Does that help?”
John perused the menu, looking for something recognizable to eat, while Sherlock chatted with the bartender and ordered a round of cocktails. Their first drinks were set down with a wink; John pulled his glass toward him, sniffed, and said, “Why is this purple?”
Sherlock stood and walked backwards down the stairs until he was a few feet away, then held out his hand and pulled John to his feet. “It’s the neighborhood where all the Swedes immigrated to when they came to Chicago. There are still quite a few Swedish influences, but it’s also become a gentrified residential area for gay and lesbian couples of a certain age, income, and lifestyle.”
“And how do we know it is not? Surely, the events preceding its discovery are in keeping with the likelihood of its validity. My own brother carried the stone’s map around his neck, swaddled against his chest, and felt it guide him in his dreams.
Both Greg and Kevin were already showered and dressed. Sherlock thought Greg’s sweater looked a little big for him, and wondered if it was Kevin’s. No doubt Greg had planned to spend the night, which led Sherlock to believe that Greg had brought his own clothes, and simply wanted to wear Kevin’s sweater, and if that wasn’t the most sickeningly sweet thing ever, he didn’t know what was.
They crunched their way down the driveway through a layer of freshly fallen snow, and belted themselves into the front seat of the station wagon. Sherlock waited. He didn’t have to wait long.
Happy Independence Day. American or not, may you enjoy and cherish your freedoms, and respect them, and honor them.
John closed his eyes, and his lips brushed against Sherlock’s, and Sherlock closed his eyes, and he stayed perfectly still, and willed John’s lips to come back. They did.
The room is dark and they are covered in the half of the duvet that John must have flipped up over them. Sherlock struggles to wakefulness and turns toward John where he lies at his side.
The room was bright when Sherlock cracked one eye open the next morning. His arms were full of John, still asleep. They'd shifted during the night, and Sherlock was spooned along John's back, John's head lying on Sherlock's arm, Sherlock's feet tangled between John's. He guessed that it must’ve been going on 10:00. Probably 9:45.
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Sherlock,” he said, eyes still closed, “if you know who’s doing this, that should probably be our priority right now.”
“But absolutely worth it.” Sherlock reached down and cupped John's bottom in his large hands. It was warm and firm and lightly fuzzed under his palms, the smooth curves perfectly shaped for Sherlock to caress and touch.
The last two sessions were less about dance and more about trying not to grope each other too explicitly as they stumbled around the dance floor. It always started out professionally enough, but eventually John would start giggling into the top of Sherlock's bustier, or Sherlock would start nuzzling John's ear, or John's hand would drift over Sherlock's arse, one finger gently tracing the disappearing string of his undergarment. Twice Maiko had to tap Sherlock on the shoulder to get his attention and break up what she considered unacceptable grinding, even for most Latin American dances.
John ran his finger through a small puddle of condensation on the table and drew small circles on the wood. He looked up at Sherlock and back down, raising an eyebrow.
Sherlock froze. For several seconds he was only aware of the sound of his breathing and the roar of disbelief in his ears. When he was able, he took another step onto the landing and then another, padding barefoot down the hallway until he was just out of sight at the top of the stairs.
We've discussed it quite a lot, and have agreed that artistic license is preferable to a dull island. Thus, our pengs have an assortment of objects which made it to their island from the mainland.
“Nah, you probably needed the sleep, you know? Plus, I took lots of pictures of you sleeping and looking sexy at the same time.”
He leans in, careful of both the egg and John's concerns, and plants a great big clacking kiss on John’s bill. John closes his eyes and hums. Sherlock kisses him again, and when John returns the kiss with more interest than that of a dead flounder, Sherlock slips his wing under John's, and rubs that one spot that makes John growl.
Sherlock relaxed in stages, from actively reminding himself to let go, to losing himself in the scent of eucalyptus and wintergreen, to drifting off into a drowsy half-sleep as his body melted and reformed under John’s capable hands. He was hardly aware of John’s attention to his hamstrings and calves, his heels and the soles of his feet.
“We’re already halfway through our sophomore year. We weren’t together our freshman year, we weren’t even in touch, and it can’t get worse than that, can it? We’ll have spring break together, and then summer vacation, and if all goes well we’ll be at school together in a year. We’ll be okay.”
“You know I will. You take care of our family, Johnling. Take care of our egg, and Erebus, and I will think of you every single moment I am away, and I will be back before you know it. I love you.”
When they emerged from their newly shared bedroom several days later, they each deleted their individual blogs and created a new one called
Sherlock closed his eyes and relaxed. The motion of the car and the warmth of John’s body next to his lulled him into a state of drowsy contentment. He felt John slip one arm behind his shoulders and the other come to rest on top of Sherlock’s forearm.
“All of a sudden I realized I couldn't leave here today without telling them. It's not fair to us, to have to act like we aren't everything we are, just to save her from her prejudices.”
“I made it up.” Sherlock swept his arms under John's shoulders and wriggled into the seat of John's hips as John pressed his thighs to Sherlock's waist.
He slips the email back into the folder and picks up the next set of papers in the stack. He knows this one almost by heart, but reads it again anyway.
Then, in his third year, Victor happened, much the way a tornado might. They met in the evenings when the campus was quiet and their peers were winding down their days, when the sky was that soft violet colour before full dark, when the birds settled and the cicadas began to sing. Although used to studying at all hours of the day and night, Sherlock quickly cultivated new habits that allowed him to cram as much school work into the day as possible so that his nights were free for other endeavors.
Sherlock cannot wake up. He doesn’t like this white, in-between stage, after being with John, but before returning to himself. He cannot go back. He has to go forward, but he’s so weighed down. It’s all so heavy.
John has one hand clasped over his mouth, and is still staring at what lies in the palm of his other hand.
Andersonville is one of my favorite neighborhoods, and I think Sherlock and John would live there if they lived in Chicago.
"Like everything. The first time I knew I needed you, when you shot Hope. But the first time I knew you were different? That was the first time I saw you, in the lab. The first time I was jealous, that was when you went on that stupid date with Sarah, instead of me."
At 22,394 square miles, Lake Michigan is bigger than Croatia, Israel, Switzerland, and Belgium; it's bigger than eleven of the U.S. states (including DC).
“Okay. It's summer. It's hot. We've been cleaning out the stables at my place, and we’re sweaty, and tired. Your curls are plastered all over your neck and forehead, and I've got sweat dripping down my sides and back. We’re wearing cut offs and T-shirts.”
“Sherlock, listen to me. You are the best and the wisest peng I have ever known. You can do this. Do it for me. Can you do that? For me?”
John’s smile grew wider, but he still didn’t open his eyes. He shifted onto his back and held his arms open. “Come here.”
Sherlock watched John set his lips into a thin, white line, and glare at the back of his mother’s head.
“Let me ask you, Ma. When did you decide to be straight? Was that when you met dad, or before you met dad, or what?”
Of course, should you not find yourself completely satisfied, return this parchment at your earliest convenience for a full refund or exchange. Based on the profile you submitted, we are confident that these ancillary courses will also appeal to your specific proclivities:
“Well, I was. I am. I’ve wasted enough time. You’ve wasted enough time. You want more, is that right? More than an assassin for a wife? I can give you more, John. It’s been on offer for quite a while now. You’re here, after all, are you not? Drawn to the danger, to the risk of doing things you’re not supposed to do? I’m something you’re not supposed to do, am I not?”
The aromatic scent of John’s aftershave was mixing with his body heat and wafting up and around Sherlock. Every now and then he could pick up a bit of John’s deodorant, the wine on his breath, traces of his detergent and shampoo. He was blissfully ensconced in John, with only the sights and sounds of the restaurant getting in the way. He closed his eyes, rested his head on John’s shoulder, and settled one hand on John’s ribs.
A few hours later they climbed into John’s Range Rover and were making their way north from Oxfordshire, passing through Birmingham and Manchester, skirting the east side of the Lake District National Park, and then through the quiet stretches of southern Scotland. The drive was peaceful and they talked easily about John’s past medical experiences and his future practise, and Sherlock’s past cases and those he most liked to work (locked room serial murders). Sherlock told John more about the detectives he worked with (Lestrade and Dimmock) and those he couldn’t tolerate being around (Donovan and Anderson).
Carefully renovated, the main house had been patched, painted, scrubbed and decluttered, and the tennis hut brought up to the standard of a comfortable lodge and secure safe house. Sherlock was eager to play with some of the more advanced technological gizmos and gadgets, despite Mycroft’s warnings to ‘keep his hands to himself.’
Sherlock glances at the ticking bomb from his perch on top of the crate of crushed tomatoes, seemingly unconcerned that the entire Tesco will detonate in less than four minutes. "Quick, John," he says from under heavily lidded eyes, "Undo your trousers."
The microwave beeped, and she pulled out John’s plate of steaming mashed potatoes and green beans, and set it down across the table from Sherlock.
Sherlock’s head jostled against John's shoulder as he laughed, and then Sherlock started laughing, too, the two of them grasping at each other and sliding down the pillows.
Sherlock let his body go limp, and steeped in the bliss of John's warm weight along the length of him, the low hum of those words in his ear, the sense of being completely covered and contained by his man.
He thought about this as he inched his fingers over the contours of John’s forearm and wrist, each touch of muscle and vein and bone transmitting the same message to his brain:
Sherlock looked down at where his hand rested on John’s Levi’s covered thigh. “They’re perfect on you.”
“Take off your boots.” John held onto Sherlock's hips, and Sherlock stepped on the heel of one boot to slide his foot out, then did the same with the other. John knelt down and tapped Sherlock's ankle, so Sherlock lifted his foot and let John take off one sock, then the other.
John clapped his hand over his mouth, playing it through to the end, and Laffitte pushed back from the table, stood up, and starting backing away. Sally reached into her blazer pocket and showed Laffitte a glimpse of curved metal – handcuffs – and jerked her chin toward the exit.
“No, he really couldn’t be. He’s at Annette’s, and he’s only been there for a few hours, and nothing is going to happen to him tonight.”
“A shot at what, exactly?” Sherlock watched a drop of water collide with another, just over Watson’s collarbone, pick up speed, careen over hard pectoral muscle, and bounce off his nipple.
The note was written in crisp black fountain ink on ivory cardstock, indicating someone older than them, someone who carried a briefcase in which he could store an expensive fountain pen and scented stationery.
"Based on his proclivity for healing I'd say he's looking for something he requires for a poultice or balm."
“I know. I know that and I hate it as much as you do. The timing could not be worse. But he didn’t know we’d be here and his life is in danger, Sherlock. I swear, if he had come for any reason other than a death threat I’d have sent him away last night. You have to believe that.”
Sherlock stopped at a red light, reached over, and grabbed John’s hand. “Of course. That’s pretty much what I told him. He said the invitation stands and to stop by if we feel like it. I don’t think he cares either way, but wanted to do the right thing by Mrs. Hudson.”
She has the markings of all other emperors chicks. She is grey with the exception of the black and white mask covering her face, head, and neck. Her bill is black at the base and pale at the tip. The circles of white around her eyes accentuate their bright blackness.
Sherlock nodded his head up and down a bit more enthusiastically, then shook it back and forth just as enthusiastically. “A wall, yes, but not the shower; too dangerous, we'd slip and break something.”
(bull kelp) is rich in iodine, salt minerals, selenium, zinc, magnesium, and calcium and is an effective antioxidant. As a food or dietary supplement it able to prevent heart and kidney problems, slow aging and cellular degeneration, and combats high cholesterol levels. Many cultures in South America make use of Durvillaea antarctica in their cuisine. In Peru it is widely used as an accompaniment to ceviche and is a primary component of a broth soup called chilcano. In Chile it is used in many different recipes like salads and stews.  Its primary market now is for alginates, particularly in China.
Sherlock looked back and forth between the spinach concoction and John. John, who was trying to take care of him on a traditionally difficult day. But still, spinach? He took a tentative sip. It was not coffee and a muffin. He looked at John and pursed his lips.
Each night, Sherlock looks forward to the evening crèche with a longing exponentially related to the length of their blasted respectable distance. Dinner is barely finished, grooming hardly begun, when Sherlock starts jostling John to the wind-protected huddling spot.
His hands danced through Sherlock’s hair and skimmed over his skull and neck, light, brushing touches that relieved tension more through stimulation than pressure. John’s hips, however, were a solid weight against Sherlock’s arse, and the snug nestle of John’s genitals between his cheeks was a heady counterbalance to the relaxing effects of his massage. Sherlock’s cock continued to harden and flex between his legs.
Sherlock kissed him, and kissed him, and when they both started shifting in their seats, trying to get at more of each other, he pulled away and stared at where his mouth had just been. He ran his index finger over John’s lower lip, and kissed him one more time.
Sherlock stared at them lying there under the table, a rainbow of blues declaring to the entire world John’s most intimate secrets, shouting out exactly how the two of them loved each other. They were already soaking up the melted, muddy snow from their boots and shoes. Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His chest felt encased in metal bands, and his lungs seemed to be slacking on the job.
They were on their way to their hiding spot on a rooftop across the street from the restaurant, well in advance of the time of James’ date, when a text alert sounded. Sherlock swiped his phone’s screen as they walked, stopped dead still, and frowned.
Sherlock was lost in thought about his left testicle when a squeeze higher than said testicle brought him back to reality. Tiny Bat John had been successful in his escape manoeuvres, but was now hiking up Sherlock's penis, which had been unaware of the proceedings, but was now turning into some sort of Bat-pole, with John winding his way around it in an effort to avoid the sheet-quicksand that lay below.
John spent the majority of the evening trying to train his eyes away from the figure Sherlock cut in yet another new suit. The man was ridiculous, John thought, sipping from the champagne flute in his hand. Yes, Sherlock was ridiculously attractive, is what he was, in his body hugging, worsted wool suit, his sateen shirt, his buffed and shined dress shoes.
They made several toasts to marriage and each other, and to their families, including John’s absent sister and deceased parents, and when all was said and done Sherlock was warmed through with drink and affection, and John was still grinning like an absolute idiot.
They spy on the other chicks, and on their parents, and on the councilpengs, and then use Sherlock’s deductions to make up stories about them, too. Sherlock tries to teach John some simple observational techniques so that he doesn’t have to rely on Sherlock’s, but John’s deductions seem to be more flights of fantasy than walks through reality.
John trailed his fingers up Sherlock’s arms, and they slowly disentangled, and climbed out. They darted around, grabbing their discarded shirts and shorts and jeans and shoes, throwing it all onto the front seat of the station wagon. Sherlock swung open the rear door and climbed into the back of the car, John coming in after him, pulling the door shut, and collapsing onto Sherlock.
John considers, and can find no reason to disagree. For the first time since the entire debacle began, John seems truly happy. His whole face lights up when he tells Sherlock that this would be the perfect opportunity to check on their treasure.
As soon as they get home John goes into the bedroom, retrieves his military tags from the top dresser drawer, and adds his new tags to the chain. He slips them over his neck and is admiring them in the mirror when Sherlock comes up behind him and wraps his arms around his waist.
“Yeah, I'm gonna lick you, and suck you, and drive my tongue into you, and you want it so bad, but I just keep teasing you, flicking around it, blowing on it –”
Sherlock stared at the potato peeler in his hand, at the clock, and at the five pounds of potatoes sitting in the sink. “I’ll do a few now, and the rest later, all right?”
Sherlock went to find the hamper, then returned, set it on the kitchen table, and rummaged through it. “We’re in luck. My God, how did she fit all of this in here? A pint of milk, some scones, a roast chicken, bread rolls, steak sandwiches, and … oh, you’re kidding me …”
“Sherlock, you speak of subjectivity and bias. Would Mycroft not, as your brother, be biased toward you, unduly affecting the nature of his work?”
John did a half-crunch off Sherlock’s lap to reach the bottle of soda, passed it to Sherlock, then reached into the box of photos near his knee. “Oh, my God. Look at this one.”
, brother mine, we had a bit of a rough time, but all is well now. Come, I will tell you everything.”
John rested one hand on a canted hip, and rubbed the other over the back of his neck, staring down at the distance between them.
“Well, I’ve reached a bit of a dead end with what I was working on. Is there anything the two of you would like to do with the afternoon?”
