See? I told you that I'd post another chapter today! Proceed with caution though, this chapter is full of feelings.
“Then you shouldn’t be hungry. We’ll eat when we get there. Just read your book.”
“Insecurity mostly. But none of that matters, what matters is that we’re together now, and if you want to take it slow then fine. I can’t promise that I’m going to keep my hands off of you though, now that I get to look and touch at you all I want, I’m never going to stop.
“Cas-wait. I’m” Everybody
That was all he said as he left the motel room. Back then he had never felt such pain at Cas’s betrayal to the devil, but he was wrong. This-this was much worse. Cas had rebelled from heaven, rejected his own family for Dean countless times, but the fact that he was considering it really hurt him. “Nut up Winchester” he said to himself. He is a grown ass man/angel he can do whatever the hell he wants to. Even if that means that he’ll lose the closest thing he’s had to love in his whole life.
After a quick cold shower he’s ready for whatever the day has for him. When he makes it back to his room, Cas is still in bed but no longer asleep. Rubbing his eyes he sits up, and begins to pull back the covers.
Cas’s POV
“Can you sing to me?”
due to its lack of violence. In the end, he had loved the movie and was glad that he had chosen the ‘chick flick’.
Dave was definitely his type. Dean had known that he was bisexual since he was five years old. Strong jaw lines, pretty eyes, and a good head of hair had always made him hard within seconds. Nobody knew this, of course. John Winchester was a good father, or he was. Before. He couldn’t tell anybody in risk of his father finding out, so he kept it to himself and snuck out when he could. If caught he would lie and say it was a girl he’d been with. And luckily, they’d never questioned it. At the bar, Dave slipped him his number, and he hadn’t reacted. Or had he? Giving Dave a slight nod he went back to his table, where Sam waited unknowingly. Making up an excuse to leave, they headed back to the motel where he knew Sam would turn in early. Dialing the number scribbled on the paper he waited, hopefully the guy was off and awake but if not he could always jerk one off in the shower. “Hello?” came out a gruff and deep voice. Jesus, he liked this guy’s voice. “Dave? It’s Dean. From the bar.” “Holy Shit, I never thought I’d actually get a call. Face like yours you never know.” “Uh thanks, so are you off?” “Yeah, I’ll be off in five. You want to-?” “Yeah. Definitely.” “Alright. Well why don’t you meet me at the Royale Inn motel on I-50?” “I know exactly what you’re talking about.” Looking up at the motel sign he grins,
Giving it back better than it was, even.
"It's the dishes, isn't it?" Dean asks, squeezing Cas' wrist. He knows already. "We didn't rinse 'em off."
"That's fine with me," Cas says, sweeping out a hand, completely unruffled.
What happens next is essentially Dean humping Cas' thigh like a damn dog in heat and completely losing his cool. He has exactly zero control over his own hips, because the moment he figures out that he's got the room to rock them, they do it of their own accord and he's left to reap the benefits. His head spins, mouth falling slack and eyes falling shut. His whole body feels hot, and he's wound so tight from wanting Cas specifically that every single thing about this feels like the
he is.
Dean feels like he's going to scream if nothing gives. It's driving him up the goddamn wall, and all he wants is the one thing Cas seems dead-set on not giving him. Of all the places to plant his feet and never waver on, why did it have to be this? Why can't Cas give in
"Are you sure you don't want any bacon?" Cas asks, gesturing towards the stove.
Waiting is torture. Dean feels like it has been too long, though it may have only been seconds, and he's gripping Sam's stupid, ugly flannel in a tight grasp that borders on too much. He's tense, frozen in place, waiting with a bated breath.
"Got something else in mind?" Dean asks, not even
Cas squeezes him closer, which is so,
Black ooze bleeds from the wall, insidious in its presence, clearly a bad sign. Dean turns back to Cas with a question on his lips, but Cas is still smiling, though it's sadder now.
"You," Dean blurts out, then his gaze drops to Cas' fingers again. "Those." His eyes crawl down and to the side, latching onto Cas' dick, and he speaks like he's ordering off a menu. "Or that. Both. Any. All of it. Something, anything, just—just get
Outside the circle, he writes four other Enochian symbols. Four lit candles are placed atop the four quadrants, and four other objects are placed at the farthest points outside the circle. Bobby glances at Dean, a split of hesitation and guilt crossing his features before he reaches into his jacket pocket. It's only when the light catches the object, Dean stands up. Cradled in Bobby's hand is a necklace, a gold pendant hanging from the black string. Dean's heart clenches.
Eight-thirty at night on the 23rd of January 1993, on a cold winter road somewhere between Kansas and Nebraska. That's the exact moment his parents died.
A draft of air hits Dean's face, warm and with a tincture of bleach as Castiel practically drags him through the hospital, his legs struggling to find the strength to hold him up. Castiel quickly pulls him into a spare room, pushing Dean against the wall and shielding him with his body. A slither of light shines through the door showing him the silhouette of passing nurses but the rest is hidden from him by Castiel's body.
"So how do we stop them from trying to kill me or at least get this stuff out of me?" Bobby huffs.
"Stop!"
All he can remember are the bad parts of his childhood now Sam isn't around to block them out. Dean glances up at Bobby. The lamp beside him has cast a soft yellow glow on the older man and Dean finds himself searching Bobby's face. The man in front of him is more of a father than John ever was.
The door slams shut and just like that Dean is left alone in the motel room again only this time with three duffels and ten minutes.
Dean stands silent, stunned by the sudden movements. "However, who am I to question Sam Winchester and Bobby Singer." Castiel's face is completely serious when he speaks but Dean sees the smug look in his eyes as he nods to Sam and Bobby before disappearing into thin air. "Traitor," Dean mutters scowling at the empty space where Castiel had been. Sam crosses his arms over his chest and Dean's not quite sure whether Sam's going to start yelling at him or walk away and not speak to Dean for a couple of weeks, Dean prefers the yelling. Trying to hunt without talking to each other is one of the hardest things in the world.
The figure doesn't seem to notice him and continues moving until it disappears behind some drywall. Dean shifts around the fallen metal, slowly following behind the shadow. "Yes and no," Sam answers uncertainly, restarting the constant tapping on his keyboard. Dean sighs and shines his flashlight down the end of the narrow hallway ahead of him before continuing straight on. "Wow, thanks for the great insight Sam, but I'm gonna need a bit more than a freaking guess." The whole building groans at Deans every step and howls in protest whenever he touches anything other than the floor. A spark of light illuminates the space around him, the blinding light momentarily stopping him in his tracks as he tries to rub away the coloured spots clouding his vision. He follows it into a narrow hallway where another bright glow crackles in the air like a set of small fireworks and stops in his tracks.
Samandriel's eyebrows knit together and Castiel can see the anger building within. "Protecting one life means nothing if you are killing your brothers and sisters in the process!" Castiel's eyes are drawn to the wings burnt in the grass beside him. Hannah steps forwards sadness clouding her features.
about swallows his laugh and instead settles with rolling his eyes. "No, not
"Cas-" He turns expecting to see the angel but is greeted with an empty space and a plate full of food. He frowns and searches the space around them. "Where's Cas?" He asks. This, of course, gets Dean's attention and he immediately lifts his head looking at the empty seat opposite him. Sam watches him anxiously because having Dean go feral right now would only make things worse especially if a werewolf knows their situation. Even if said werewolf says he's a friend.
Dean's stomach grumbles loudly reminding him of the half-eaten burger sitting alone on his desk and he groans sympathetically for his stomach. He walks to the edge of the tunnel, standing in front of the ladder and decides that climbing down a freezing cold airshaft really isn't how he wants to be spending his lunchtime. Dean cups two hands around his mouth and leans over the ladder. "Hello?" He shouts. His voice echoes off of the wall and bounces back to him but there's no response. "New IT guy? You alive down there?" As if on cue in the 'one hundred ways to piss off Dean show' the air conditioning bursts through the small vent above the door, the loud rattling blocking out his voice. He sighs and steps forwards putting his weight on to the first step and realises that his plan of getting to the basement safely won't be as easy as he thought. The first step on the ladder groans loudly and the second is even worse.
"You're lying." Castiel frowns.
"Nothing." He turns away from the window, thumbing the book resting on the window sill.
Castiel looks at him in slight panic at the mention of an injury but Dean waves him off. "The grace must have healed it in my sleep." Dean grins as he lifts his arm up and rotates it over his head and back down, a movement he hadn't been able to do since he was thirteen. The angel however looks even more troubled as if Dean had grown back a new limb in front of him. Dean rolls his eyes. "What now?" He whines. "It's only temporary. I can at least use it to heal my crappy broken bones."
Dean practically crawls towards what he hopes is the angel and can't help but groan with each step. When he's closer he can just about make out the blue of Castiel tie and almost sobs in relief.
"So what's the plan Sammy?" Dean asks a little anxiously, pulling Sam out of his daze.
Now that his stomach has finally stopped lurching he feels bruised inside. "I told you not to move your hand." This time it gets a reaction and Castiel glares back. "And I told you I don't take orders from you."
Sighing, Bobby stands and walks over to the kitchen counter pulling out a knife. "Bobby, what are you-?" Bobby shushes him with a wave of his hand and grabs the edge of a picture hanging on the wall, lifting it from its hook and placing it on the floor. Behind the picture reveals a sigil that looks like a compass and an upside-down 'G'. Dean's eyes widen at the sight as he can see stains of red that have dripped down the wall and quickly realises its blood.
"Haven't seen him."
In all honesty, Dean hasn't thought this through. He and Sam didn't get a chance to sleep last night because their latest case dragged them to Mississippi where all the witnesses had their mouths shut tighter than a nun in church about everything and everyone. The whole town had an unspoken agreement of see no evil hear no evil, which turned out to be an agreement they invented after the fourth person in their town died from unknown causes but in reality had just been the work of a witch cult. Luckily they got there before the witches could make it a fifth death, but it still didn't make staying up all night disposing of the bodies any easier.
"Did you fi-"
Then before he has the chance to react he's being pulled backwards and hoisted into the air. The hand around his throat squeezes tightly, cutting off his breathing as he dangles helplessly over a five hundred feet drop. A man stands in front of him, a lifeless and monotone expression on his face as he holds Dean. The man has clear pale skin similar to Castiel expect he has shockingly white-blond hair and vibrant green eyes. His eyes are glowing with barely contained power, an angel similar to Naomi with only one goal in mind.
"Dean."
Castiel looks uncomfortable at the mention of hell but Dean pretends not to notice. "Yes, most of the time there is someone or something that triggers the sins, for example, a person or an object that means a lot to you. Unfortunately, no one knows why as everyone who's been cursed has not completed the sins and died." Dean just manages to catch his beer before it drops from out of his hand. "What! So you're telling me if I don't do each sin I'll die?" Castiel shakes his head. "Of course not, me and Sam would not let you die."
Startled, Castiel blinks. "He's...healing, no one knows where he is, he hasn't woken yet." Dean stares ahead bringing a hand up to rub his face. He nods in a daze.
Dean carefully moves Castiel's hand off of his mouth and holds it trying to give the angel a sense of stability. "If you can protect Sam you can protect me." He whispers. "Why do we need to leave?" Castiel squeezes Dean's hand as if to reassure himself and looks Dean in the eyes. "They've come for you Dean, I'm so sorry if you stay here you will die. I can't protect anyone who gets it their way." Dean frowns and subconsciously steps closer to the angel. "Who, Cas?" He demands.
"Mom told me about what happened." Dean's brows furrow and he glances up more fully.
Castiel rolls his eyes at the screen and places his cup onto the small table beside him. He stands frowning at the thought of having to hit the side of the tv in hope of restarting it but before he can manage to take a step forwards the TV cuts out with a whip-like crackle, draining the life out of the television. Pinching the bridge of his nose, Castiel groans in despair. The television had been acting up for the past few weeks and it was only a matter of time until it broke permanently.
He made sure to force a baseball hat onto his head after getting whistled at in the parking lot.
As they quickly found out on the way to the motel, in the Impala Dean cannot be trusted to drive when he is alone, with food or with Castiel. It had taken him around three minutes at most to resist the curse before he had let go of the wheel and leapt backwards in the hope of either grabbing the food in Jake's lap or grabbing the angel next to him. If Sam hadn't grabbed the wheel they'd be digging the Impala out of a ditch right now. So therefore now Castiel has to feed him.
Castiel raises his eyebrow at him, a gentle smile gracing his lips. "I was born with my grace and have had millenniums to learn to control it. You have had full access to your grace for barely a couple of days. Please don't try to compare us, it's not fair on yourself." Dean shakes his head, a frown pulling his eyebrows together.
As it turns out today was different. It was the best day of Castiel's life. He did things he'd never done before with people he'd never met before and if he plays his cards right he'd be with those people for the rest of his life, with the Winchesters for the rest of his life and God help him he's more than happy to spend that time with Sam and Dean.
Bobby springs into action. "What the hell are you doing?" He shouts, pulling him over to the sink.
Dean nod feeling the sympathetic frown form on his face before he can stop it. His hand drops to the wooden desk below as he circles the small study. "You're sure this is everything? No hidden rooms, safes or keys?"
He glances up and he catches Castiel's eyes in the rear-view mirror. His fingers clench at his side and he quickly looks away, forcing the car door open. "Let's go then."
"What? If they thought we shouldn't be killed then why the hell did they attack us as soon as we walked through the door?" Dean questions incredulously. "Well, I may have twisted a few things and told them you guys had killed one of their own." He smirks proudly at Dean. "Guess I'm just one sick puppy."
"Anyway, did you manage to gank The Witches of Eastwick while I was out?" Both his brother and the angel give him a look that shows they have no idea what he's talking about and Dean rolls his eyes. You'd think your kid brother who was born in the eighties and an angel who's basically watched the earth go by from the beginning would know about such programs. He sighs. "You know, the creepy witch chicks that tried to kill me." Sam makes a noise that sounds like he understands Dean's reference, but Dean knows he doesn't. He sure as hell tried to keep Sam away from all supernatural TV programs when he was younger and he doubts Sam's guilty pleasure is watching Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer when Dean isn't around. "Dean your insides were shutting down and your ribs collapsed on themselves. I think there are more important matters to be focusing on than a witch," Castiel growls and gestures angrily at Dean.
To describe the air conditioning as a little over eager would be a huge understatement, it's more like a blistering winter chill than a cooling summer breeze. He never understood why Charlie liked being down here. Dean looks up and notices the subtle changes the new guy made. For one it's much cleaner than when Charlie had it and a few safety posters have been put up here and there on the cement walls but mostly the only new things are the black office chair and the stack of paperwork.
Dean stares into Castiel's eyes but can't will his lips to move. His mind is blank and his eyes wide as he stares at Castiel in horror. The angel's eyes desperately search Dean's... waiting. This whole thing, it's so much bigger than him, there are so many things he's not being told, that he doesn't understand. He searches his mind for something reasonable to say. But all that comes out is, "How's Sam?"
Sam enters the room, in his usual plaid shirt and blue jeans, with a gun in hand. "Dean?" He calls and sighs in relief when he sees me. "Good to have you back Cas." He says and looks from Dean to me and back again. "I'll just go get some food," Sam announces and steps out of the room. Dean stays in his place on the floor beside the couch and stares at me, almost marvelling at my vessel. I glance back down at him and an image flashes into my mind of the 'Dean' from my imagination and my breathing halts. "Welcome back Angel." He grins and pulls me into a tight hug. I pull him into my chest just as hard, relishing in the warm feeling. "Dean, may I try something?" I request and lean back, far enough to be able to see his face but not far enough to be comfortable. He nods, a serious expression spreading across his face and I lean in.
Dean takes his time drying the cutlery as Ellen passes it to him. His thoughts easily turn darker as he thinks about the people Ellen must have lost through the years. Did her husband die hunting? How many people has Bobby lost or how many could he just not save? Dean remembers the weight of a gun in his hand, his hand twitches at the thought and he wonders idly if Bobby would want him to join the hunter business.
"We had the same when we went to Minneapolis," Jake says, taking his plate and stabbing at his food. "Diners always have the best burgers." Dean nods along as he takes his plate. "Yeah dude we practically live off this stuff, well, I do not miss daisy over there." He gestures to Sam.
Dean's toes curl with the temptation to let Castiel continue and he nearly gives in.
Inside conversations swirl in a dirty cloud of smoke, the stench of cigarettes barely hidden behind the noxious fog of alcohol. The tinkle of glass on glass is lost under the slow guitar riff as the bartender, a man with a mullet, pours drinks. The bar stands in a square in the centre, dark in the scarcely lit room. The sun shines strips of sallow light across the floor through the two small windows at the front.
"I know what you're doing, you're trying to act like this isn't a big deal." Sam sits down on the edge of his bed. "But it is." He sighs. "I think maybe we should stop hunting for a while." Dean's head snaps towards Sam with a, "What?" coming through gritted teeth. "Only until we find a cure," Sam assures as he stands back up, holding his hands in silent surrender.
Dean grins to himself and uses the wing mirror to line up his shot.
The smell of hot dogs, smoke and chocolate fill his lungs as they return to the ground, the scent clinging to his clothes once again and leaving his mouth watering. Castiel almost has to blink reality back into place because who knew a Ferris wheel could make everything seem so unearthly, so surreal like he was in another world entirely.
The guys sat in a black desk chair, carelessly flicking through a yellow file when they walk in. He barely even looks at either of them when Dean speaks, instead deciding whatever's in the yellow file, labelled 'T.S', is much more interesting. It's strangely unsettling how the guy seems to not give a shit that the FBI is in his office, considering half the cops showed up at the suspect's house just because they heard that the FBI were there. "We're here about the Julia Tesla case."
Dean stays in the bathroom for the rest of the afternoon, fleeting between having panic attacks and trying to recover from them.
After he and Sam got back to the motel they had continued with their research on Chimera lore, looking for any weaknesses that could help them. It took around an hour for them to realise what they already knew; lead was the only thing that could kill it. So with only one block of lead and about ten different knives because who the hell knows what will work, they drove to the house.
Deans steps get cut off by the same gum-chewing kid from before who stomps ahead and he scowls at the back of the kids head. An, "Ow!" Yells from beside him and he's met with the boy from before, who was looking at the rock. The boy's rubbing his chest and scowling at the kid in front of Dean. The other kid turns around to make an 'aww, you poor baby' kind of face before pushing his headphones into his ears and walking away.
"Bobby."
. Sam had been about seven at the time and Dean twelve, he remembers because that was the year his dad had given him his first gun. They had been driving around for days on end, moving from motel to motel, school to school chasing the yellow-eyed demon. Of course, back then Sam hadn't known about anything supernatural, so he was kept in the dark for that part but for Dean, it had been hell. He had, had to keep track of everything his father had said and done,
"Cas." He says firmly. "As much as I want you to continue because dude, wow. If we don't hurry up there's a good chance the both of us are getting fired." He tries to look at Castiel but the angle is too awkward he just hopes he gets the idea.
"After a demon tried to attack the two of us your dad said he couldn't trust me anymore. Must've thought I was some sort of beacon for them. He didn't want anything to happen to you." Something sad pulls at Bobby's face for a second before it disappears. Dean chews the inside of his cheek in thought. He can't help but think it's ironic that John was trying to be protective when really he was taking away one of the most important people in Dean's life.
She nods somewhat uncomfortably. "Well, yes. After the seizures stopped." Dean blinks at her, shaking his head disbelievingly. "Seizures? I didn't know. What happened to me?" Naomi hesitates. He glances at Castiel, directing the question at him but the angel only shakes his head not even bothering to look Dean in the eye.
Dean hears a groan come from to the left of him. Ancitif coughs up a spray of blood and barely manages to keep himself upright with the force of it. Dean limps over to the bloody mess on the floor that only moments ago had been an intimidating adversary. Dean is trying not to stare at the demon's nose but he finds that his eyes keep diverting to it. One moment he's looking at swollen eyes and the next they're resting on the bloody mess that had been a perfectly ordinary nose only moments before. He looks grotesque.
Castiel himself is another problem entirely.
Dean practically inhales his food with little to no etiquette as if he had been starving for weeks.
"If it turns out this is all some elaborate plan or you don't do everything in your power to protect him. I'll personally hunt you down and kill all of you. Nothing will stop me."
"Fuck, Cas," Dean groans. He almost came at the thought of being inside Cas.
Then suddenly, silence. He can hear nothing but the sound of his baby trying her best to start again and his heavy breathing. He almost thinks it was his imagination, a way of his sleep-deprived brain tricking him until a low growl breaks the silence. Dean quickly brings his hand up to cover his nose and mouth trying to muffle his breathing. Slowly, the creature grows, it's large black head rising to stare through the window with a pair of glowing yellow eyes shining in the darkness. The wolf huffs, it's hot breath filling the car as it exhales from its powerful lungs. Dean watches its thick black fur shake with the wind as if it was getting progressively bigger with each second.
Castiel's pained groan sets him into action and he stands ready to fight. Dean swallows thickly, a shuddering breath leaving his body. "Who the hell are you?" The shorter angel considers him for a moment assessing Dean as he does the same. The angel's brown hair rests loosely atop his head finishing just below his neck. He's not dressed like the other angels instead he's wearing a brown leather jacket with jeans and simple combat-style boots. His mouth twists into a smug grin.
Dean grins as he steps up to the chapel doors, the dented oak soothing his callous hands as he nudges them open. The room is white and spacious the ceiling stretching 16 feet into the air and being held up by four wooden beams. Pictures and balloons are dressing the white walls, shadowing the white in rays of blues, reds and greens as the sun beams down through one of the skylights and brightens the room making it seem even bigger than it already is.
it finds."
"A bit easier if we,"
"You okay?" Sam asks. Dean nods as he takes the shoulder Sam offers him and uses it as a support as he checks his and his brother's injuries. Sam has a few cuts and bruises nothing major on the outside but from what dean can see he's pretty sure Sam is no better off than him on the inside. He can see the questioning look in Sams' eyes but he chooses to save Q&A for later
“Mmhm. Now hush.”
fault Dean, I just don’t want it to be you the next time, just be more careful.”
Dean only chuckled, “No, it just means you’ve ate a lot of good food, it’s probably just indigestion. It’ll pass. Now then we’re going to watch a movie that
With that they’re driving to the town over and pulling into the parking lot thirty five minutes later.
“Hello Castiel.”
~NOTE: Hope you enjoyed the chapter, this is my first Supernatural/Destiel fanfic so let me know how it is, and any changes I should make to it. Enjoy the feels!
Dean never acknowledged it, of course, instead chose to press it down. Deep down inside of him beside everything else he preferred not to talk or think about.
Even now, their reputation never ceased to be a well-known one.
“What? No way! He banged that reaper! April! Remember?”
“Just got tired of it to be honest. I’ve seen a million times anyways. Do you want a beer?”
“Sam don’t its unimportant. I just left heaven, and they told me that they destroyed any remaining leviathans but they want me to come back and be their leader in return.” “I still don’t understand how we failed to nuke them all in the first place.” “It’s simple, we just misread the lore that if the leader is killed that they will all follow suit, that’s true if they’re loyal to the leader, if not they remain. It’s all there, we were just in a big hurry to get rid of Dick.” “Not now Sam. Haven’t they learned their lesson with that ‘commander’ shit?” “Apparently not. Hannah was in charge, but she is the one spearheading the campaign to bring me back.” “Yeah the same assholes that wanted you to kill me? Nice move Cas. Go ahead. Not anything I’m not used to. Might as well call them Crowley or Ruby for all I care. Damn.”
His own dick was in the beginning stages of it as well, and it would be awkward as hell if the angel knew that.
“This is not what I expected at all. Last time was a blur of movement and then it was over.”
“What are you looking at?” Glancing at the computer screen he tries to peek but Dean covers it up immediately.
Cas returns to his previous position and Dean sighs, he says “I’ll do it later” and lays his cheek against the dark hair. Forty five minutes later they’re both sleeping lightly in the chair when the king of hell appears.
“Crowley, wait. Whatever it is you think to gain from this, the answer is no. No deal is going to be struck I can promise you that.”
“Dean it’s fine. I’m very tired, and like I said I’m not feeling well. Goodnight.” Yanking his arm away he walks to his bedroom feeling hurt and rejected.
By the time they’re finished Cas has picked out three different t-shirts, four pairs of pants, two sets of pajamas (both plaid), two ties, and
“Oh okay, I understand. Excuse me for a moment.” With that the angel was running to the bathroom, but when he got there he just had gas. After releasing it he immediately felt better, until the smell filled the room. He laughed to himself, feeling glad that he had left when he did. The smell was not pleasant but somehow he felt that Dean would have found it humorous. When he returns to the living room Dean is seated waiting on the angel expectantly.
“Oh. Good. Give it here so I can heal this cut.”
Kissing Dean was different than anything he had ever experienced. It was soft yet firm, warm and gentle. He wasn’t sure if he was doing it right, trying to breathe out of his nose instead of into Dean’s mouth or onto his face.
“I um. God- I feel like a teenager again. Um, I wanted to try something but it seems weird to talk about?”
Realization washes over him and then he frowns, “But John.”
“Go to sleep Cas.” “Dean?” “Yeah?” “Thanks.” “You’re Welcome.” Soon, Cas is asleep against his chest, breathing softly.
Unlatching his mouth from the angel’s neck, he marvels at the bruise already forming there. Moving his attention to the angel’s face he smiles wickedly. “See there? It’s not nice to tease, now is it?” He drops Cas to the floor and begins to walk towards his room, expecting his angel to follow him.
“Dean you’re too old to be calling me that.”
"I love you too."
Dean’s POV
“It’s okay.”
Immediately he wanted to turn the radio off like he had done years ago, but the desperation in the man’s voice made him pause. Pulling over to the side of the road he listens to his hunter’s prayer.
"He saved my life." He responds.
Sitting across from his brother Dean taps his finger against the table, in sync with the patter of rain against the window. The weather has momentarily trapped them indoors with nothing to do but research as any evidence has been washed away by the rain, so for now, the only thing Dean has to do is scribble down ideas and wait for them to make sense. Sam sighs, breaking Dean out of his trance, and twists the cap off of two beers passing one to his brother. Dean nods in thanks and takes a swig, grimacing at the warm texture. "You find anything at the morgue?"
It's moments like this that unfortunately happen a lot in their relationship, Castiel getting hurt both physically and emotionally. He supposes if he blamed Dean, corrected him, maybe even left him it would stop it from happening again but the mere thought is more than Castiel can handle. Leaving Dean, leaving Sam, leaving his family. Sometimes he thinks he can handle the space, handle not seeing them smiling, happy, their love. But then Dean does that face, one so apologetic Castiel forgives him instantly because he can't help but see the young boy his hunter used to be, the innocence and fear that he carries, the kind only a child can really have. So he ends up here, bleeding, and their relationship just a little bit more broken.
"No, of course, it's not your fault." Castiel's head drops as he looks away from Dean and sits on the chair in front of him. The angel's elbows rest on his knees. "Once again I believe it was my fault. I believe your grace thought I was rejecting it and became enraged."
Crowley holds his hands up, gesturing to himself. "Well darling I could tell you but I don't think you'd be up to the challenge." He sneers. Both Castiel and Dean scowl at the demon. "Answer the question." Castiel orders tiredly. He shifts on the bed his weight dipping the mattress and forcing Dean to slide closer, their thighs touching ever so slightly, the touch setting fire to Dean's skin. Crowley sighs. "Simple. I'm here to see how my closest and dearest friend is doing?" He stretches his arms, flexing his fingers and picking at his suit sleeve. "And I may also be here to collect my...compensation."
That makes Cas' breath stutter against his hummingbird pulse, heated breath spilling over Dean's wet throat, making goosebumps break out. There's a tingle through every one of Dean's nerves, spreading all over as he shudders, working his hands until they're both properly wet, mouth opening and closing soundlessly at the sensation of it.
working that stupid trenchcoat off. He'd burn it if he didn't remember what it was like watching it burn.
"I have to—"
"Ah," Sam says delicately. He makes a face and reaches around to scratch the back of his head, clearing his throat. "Right, so...you two
"I don't want to be awake," Cas states, staring down into his coffee with a scowl. "Why are Claire and Kaia arriving so early? They're
tears of sorrow all at once, but that seems to be what he's going through at the moment. Really, at the end of the day, he's just a man who feels too much and, sometimes, can't feel any of it.
They do spend the next hour going over the basic rundown for car maintenance, and it's a little painful how much Kaia just flat out
Dean releases a shuddering breath and sniffs hard, opening his eyes and leaning back. He flicks his gaze to the rearview mirror, then forces himself to look away as soon as his chin trembles. He cranks Baby back up, and he goes home.
"And after?" Sam glances over at him. "Eileen's a Legacy. She has a right to the Bunker just like we do. She could—I mean, if she chose to—"
"Partially so you can understand that—that I'm still sometimes very wary of any joy I feel. I
All of that and more, and he just...can't.
It's almost an even
by Sorine Levina."
"Really? That's odd, considering your intro when doing a live show."
Dean does his best not to look. "Great. Make some with no tomatoes. Cas doesn't like them."
"She said you were making my gay experience terrible, and my heart is very fragile because I am a softie, and she planned to, ah, kick your ass if you did something wrong," Castiel mutters.
"Wait, call me yours again," Dean mumbles, laughing slightly, breathless, and he's raising up to hum into Castiel's mouth, kissing him hard.
"Can I, um—can I just—"
"Well...you know how you're fond of Eileen? Like, um, you would protect her because you care about her, and you genuinely like her, but you're also aware that she's kind of...not yours?" Sam asks.
Dean sighs. "We'll have to put the guns away, but yeah. Sounds good. Just a few minutes, though."
"Me instead of Jack. The Empty would take me, but there were...modifications to the deal. The Empty would only take me when I felt a true moment of joy. When I was happy. When I, as it said, forgot and moved on with my life and let the sun shine on my face. That was when it would take me."
feet. Couldn't touch her with 'em, not even with socks, and she practically went catonic if you touched hers. She wanted a motorcycle, but she never—well. Anyway. Do
"No, he didn't," Sam snips, no doubt rolling his eyes. He's still annoyed that the second thing Dean said to him upon their reunion was
good five seconds ago, Sam."
"I know you don't want to talk about it. I know you'd prefer to ignore it," Cas says, because he knows Dean creepily well. He sighs and crosses his arms, holding Dean's gaze, concerned. "I think it's important if we know the full scope of it. Dean, does she have power over you?"
and Castiel licks his triumph right out of his mouth. He marvels at the power Dean has, even when he aches to be powerless.
The plate in Dean's hand goes clattering in the sink, and Castiel glances over at him. He goes very still, staring. Dean is looking straight ahead, jaw clenched, and there's a steady tinge of red flooding his cheeks—a blush. It makes his freckles stand out.
"That's not what I'm getting at." Sam's voice softens, and he sighs, shaking his head. "You had it right the first time when you didn't care about him being gay. You didn't care about Charlie, you're outright
Dean wishes Cas weren't here for this, but he is. There's a small stand-off, the two of them lingering across from each other in the graveyard, looking at each other. Dean thinks about the flower in his closet, thinks about how it will remain long after he's gone, possibly preserved forever. He tells Cas to stand aside, robotic and unmoved.
"You and Cas, too, obviously. I mean, if that's what you two wanted to do. Have
I had Death—the leading expert on the subject—tell me I wanted to die, like killing myself wasn't clear enough."
And, well,
He hopes, and he keeps hoping, and it's a hopeless endeavor. Cas doesn't come, and Dean remains intact and pulled taught, and that's all there is.
The moment he sees Dean, his eyes fly open wide, his mouth falls open a little, parted around a small huff of shock, and he looks so goddamn stunned to see Dean at his door.
"Jack," Cas greets roughly, then clears his throat, which is like dragging metal against metal. He doesn't look at Dean, but he blinks rapidly for a few seconds, apparently needing to get his shit together, too. "Yes. Hello, good morning, Jack."
too good for you. You'd be
pretty much. At least to hear him tell it, and I can't keep tryna argue with him on it. That's the way life goes, right? We can't all get everything we want all the time. I'm used to it. It's fine."
Dean breaks his silence with, "Hey, Cas."
to, is there? Nothing really holds them back but themselves, at this point. When they're caught up in each other, fear seems so nonexistent.
"That's—very rebellious of you," Castiel says haltingly, his voice strained. He swallows and looks at Dean's lips again. "It's very attractive."
"Yeah.
His phone pings about twenty minutes later, and he frowns at the picture Claire sends him. He stares at what is apparently a furby and sees no resemblance. Perhaps she meant metaphorically.
"Ya know," Dean tells him while they're still at the creek, "they're out there trying to find a way to heal you up right now, Jack."
"You didn't give me a choice," Cas snaps. "You couldn't forgive me, and you couldn't move on. You were too angry. I left, but you didn't stop me."
"Dean."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Your—" Cas blinks, then his eyes brighten. "Ah, I'm the husband in this scenario."
Two and half months after Castiel has come back, Dean is having some...issues.
he's not breathing very evenly, and
"Why was Claire upset about the truck?" Cas asks abruptly, turning to look at him with a small frown.
Dean flinches back like someone just lunged at him, going with the sudden jerk of his heart.
"Mm, mind won't let me," Cas replies. His eyes crack open just a smidge, foggy and blue. He looks like he wants to close them again. "Coffee?"
"Where's my gun?" Claire chokes out, nearly sailing out of her chair and patting herself down.
"Are you planning to make me leave again?"
The smile on Castiel's face slips right off, and he stares at Dean with an expression that can't be described as anything other than stricken. Once again, he's cracked open, raw and exposed, and it has nothing to do with his desire this time. Dean can see it now, can see what he hasn't this whole time, but it's only confirmed when Castiel's eyes slowly crawl away and he provides no answer.
he thinks a little desperately. The mere thought hurts him all the way through, like he's been pierced with it. He already hates this as it is, but that would just make it worse. He can't do it.
Castiel frowns, reading the two messages again. He wonders who told her. Do they tell her every time he dies, or only when it seems permanent? Every time seems permanent, until it isn't, but this time…
Castiel thinks that it's rather obvious. He couldn't have non-verbally communicated his intentions better if he tried, covered under the blankets from head to toe the way he is. Clearly, he is tired and would prefer to be asleep. Dean is smart; he must be able to work this out.
Swallowing, Dean mumbles, "It's not—you know I'm not… And
subject. At one point, Dean gets away to make sandwiches, but when he comes back, he's right back to it.
"Dean," Sam murmurs, "if I could—"
"Yes. All of it. Anything. Every single terrible thing that could happen because of it, I've thought of."
"Dean," Cas says softly, fingers curling around Dean's, squeezing them, his eyebrows furrowing.
Dean snorts weakly. "Figured you would like that."
"I don't—I don't
But he was also jealous? He also pinned Dean to a counter and got him off? If he felt like he wanted to be
Sorine snorts. "You have no idea. I do it because Levina liked him. They were kind of friends. She cared about him, so I just…"
Cas also shows him the bird feeders he's got set up. He's apparently on good terms with the hummingbirds, because he shows Dean his neat little trick of patiently and quietly holding out his finger so the random hummingbird will land there. He's so calm and careful about it, smiling tenderly and talking softly to the birds, in his own little world. Dean watches and thinks
“That can’t be healthy Dean.”
Ugh. So he was right, he shivers in disgust at the image of his brother. He texts him back quickly.
It had been a month since Dean and Cas confessed their feelings for each other. Sam had healed almost completely from the trials, and his new girlfriend, Rachel, was definitely helping heal him in more ways than one. Kevin too, had a girlfriend, even though he refused to acknowledge that they were more than just good friends. Since the trials the boys had taken a much needed siesta, and it benefited them greatly. Dean, however, was beginning to feel guilty about all the time they were spending not saving people, Cas of course reassured him that there were a lot of other hunters out there. Of course he knew there were other hunters out there, but they were some of the best, and with what they knew about demon bombs they would be unstoppable. "Hey, so get this" Sam started one afternoon, obviously feeling the same discomfort he was about not hunting and went on to describe a case in a couple of towns over. Cas immediately said 'No' but Dean was determined to get back to work. "Come on, it's not that big of a deal, it's just a regular case, couple of vics with their hearts missing, it sounds like a standard werewolf attack. It's nothing we haven't done before." He tried to do Sammy's 'puppy eyes' but to no affect. "Dean, I'm not an angel, I won't be able to heal you if you get hurt, and I can't- I won't loose you. Or Sam for that matter. So if you insist on hunting, I'm coming." Raising his eyebrows he thought it through. "Cas, babe, you're not going to loose me, but there is no way your coming. You've never been without your powers, you could get hurt." Cas cocked his head and gave him a bitch face, "So could you Dean." Kevin stepped in at this point and shook his head "Jesus Christ, it's only been a month and you two are already fighting like a married couple, why don't you just
“Oh, how nice of him. What are we going to do today?”
“Where did Sam go again?”
“No coffee?” Cas shakes his head no and she’s off to make the order.
“Sure thing. What do you want to hear?”
John smiles and lets go of the handshake “And I you. I’ve heard a lot about you from the VIP section of the pit. Seems the boss is a fan of us Winchesters. I believe that’s thanks to my charming sons, but you wouldn’t believe what they say about the pretty boy angel. It’s amazing, and now that I’ve met you I can see that the rumors are true. You are head over heels in love with my son.”
but it's common sense to know that he absolutely shouldn't. This is him getting angry, or hurt, or
"Would I fucking do that? Get a fucking clue, man. I think I'm kinda obsessed with the idea of us having sex. It's
He'll never wear it out, but he wears it around the Bunker a lot. Practically every day. He even sleeps in it sometimes, hood up, stretched-out sleeves slipping over his hands. Worse yet, he even falls asleep at the map-table with it on, face buried in the warmth of the sleeves, hood over his head.
Dean's face does something strange, his eyes trailing over Castiel slowly, lips parting. Castiel decides immediately that he doesn't like it, nor does he want to be awake to see it. He releases a small grunt of frustration, a grumble, just to appease the steadily rising annoyance in his chest, and he comes to the conclusion that the only solution is going back to sleep. And so, he turns around to march back over to his bed, sliding back in, abandoning Dean to hopefully go away.
"I did," Sam admits softly.
Cas declares, arching an eyebrow, "I have all intentions of doing that at some point. Will you listen?"
"No, I'm serious. If he's—if Cas has a case of the stupid, then you deserve someone
Yes, he's always known that Dean has it—he punched God in the face—but this is something else.
"Yeah, I'm good with that if everyone is," she says, casting a look around expectantly.
Dean looks down at his beer, rubbing the pad of his thumb around the rim, swallowing. "Not everyone gets enough time."
A part of Dean wants to ask him to fight anyway, to fight for him, but he's made that mistake before. Asking Cas to do something for him, just for him, like he's enough. Cas didn't do it then, and Dean's unwilling to ask for it now. That bone-deep trust in him urges him to, needling at him, encouraging the idea that this time,
"You asked me to," Castiel points out, then makes a low, amused sound. "It's only the truth."
Dean flips him off.
Dean glances back at the body of the monster. Not a kid. A monster. Dean kills them—that's what he does. "Yeah, well, that Dean's always been kind of a dick," he says, turning back towards Cas and starting to move forward.
One hour. Forty-eight minutes.
"Dean," Sam says softly.
“No thanks.”
There was steam rising from their cups and Cas looked very happy with whatever was in his. His eyes were still drooping with fatigue but he was chatting away with Sam listlessly.
Sam was sitting at the large desk with his laptop on and a GPS map flashing on the screen. A red dot was moving on the screen. His face was creased with worry and exhaustion.
(Although he had never acted on it, he’d wanted to countless times.) Quickly deciding that he had nothing to lose he grabs the angel’s scruffy face. Pressing his lips to the angels he relishes in the feeling of it all. Cas is clearly surprised but doesn’t protest to it, and quickly links his arms around Dean’s neck. The kiss turns from slow and tender to heated in less than a moment.
Once inside the car, Dean finds the tape and pushes play.
“Well isn’t this bloody adorable?” Walking up to the couple he grins as realization washes over the hunter. His whole body becomes rigid, and his hold on Cas becomes tighter.
“Are you telling me to leave because I like dick or because I sucked yours?” David grew pale, “Leave, or I’ll have you thrown out.” “’S okay. Wasn’t that good anyways, I just needed a quick lay.” Scoffing the dick went in the back, probably to get security and Dean took it as his cue to leave. He couldn’t exactly tell Sam he got kicked out of a bar for liking cock. The bartender’s to be more specific. It normally wouldn’t be a problem for him, he had learned to suppress his needs for it a long time ago, but seeing Cas dressed like Dr. Sexy threw him over the edge. And somehow he didn’t think that it had anything to do with the case they were working. Sam was definitely up to something…
There were lines in his face and his eyes were red and puffy and  filled with worry. It looked like he had been crying.
Sam and Eileen stay in the bunker and keep the Men/Women of Letters going. They get married, have children (One boy- who looks just like Dean and rightly so since he is named Dean, and two girls- Alexandria and Ruth who they adopted after a hunt) and pass on their legacy. Every Wednesday and Saturday they meet up with Dean and Cas to have family night. Sometimes they play games, sometimes they go out shooting, or just stay in and watch old movies. Cas brings a plant or some honey from his hive, and Dean always cooks.
“This isn’t awkward for you?”
Sadness washed over him and he tried to pull away from the other man, but was interrupted.
having the angel in his arms, safe and sound.
Of course they tried their best to include him but it was futile to try. He watched cooking shows to pass the time, and had even tried out a few recipes. But no matter what he did, something was missing from his life. He knew and so did Sam. Night after night he would wake up in a cold sweat after screaming out for Castiel.
“You’re worried about Sam. I understand.”
His waking thought was “But they were human.”
Allie goes to get in the car but Noah stops her.
Walking back into the motel room he didn’t expect to find Sammy sitting at the makeshift dining table with his favorite food. “Somebody die? Did you sleep with another demon? What’s up?” Sighing loudly Sam looked as if he was about to spill something major. “Dean, we didn’t need Cas’s help, he didn’t need to dress like Dr. Sexy, it was a prank. A cruel one, I realize that now, but I’m truly sorry.” “Wait, what?” He was thoroughly confused. “You had Cas dress up as Dr. Sexy for a prank?” “Yes-but” he was interrupted by Castiel’s sudden appearance.
Knocks vibrate through the room causing him to jump “Go away Dean.”
He was putting away an angel blade with one hand and the other was pressing a bandanna against his neck.
Dean smiled at him and made a move to reach out to the backseat but thought better of it and pulled back.
“You’ve spent too much time with Sammy. Come on, you’re healthy enough. Let’s go.”
Sleep escaped him and he wasn’t very tired. He stared at the man beside him.
Hope filled Dean’s eyes and he walked over towards his angel before taking his hand. “Dad, this is Castiel. My boyfriend. Cas, this is my Dad, John.”
The End.
Breaking his own fucking rule Dean lets a tear slip out but catches it quickly before anyone can see. Cas is a rock beside him, grant it he has his hand over his mouth, but his eyes remain in awe. “Wait a minute who did she choose?” Older Allie is clearly upset, but ‘Duke’ doesn’t waiver. “I remember. It was us, it was
“For one. Remove the coat. And the suit actually. You need comfortable clothes to sleep in, not business wear.”
Dean couldn’t believe they had gone that long without talking about his younger brother, it used to be
“Sure, let me just grab my stuff.”
“It’s a store. Come on.” Once inside the store Dean groans.
“Right. The same way you love Sam, I know Dean. It’s alright. Thank you for the kind words. It’s nice to be appreciated.”
“Must be a side effect, come on.” Getting out he heads into the diner and sits himself at the back. An older lady comes to take their order and smiles sweetly at Dean.
Dean held his head in his hands trying to process what had happened. Billy was gone and so was the former pain in his chest...but now that pain was replaced by a new and different kind of pain. Heartache.
He intertwines their fingers and they head to their bedroom.
Chapter Five: Dean’s going domestic.
Jess. The unspoken name between them hung in the air.
He shook his head, all he wanted was his brother healthy and his angel by his side. Uh the angel. Maybe he was in shock. “Sir?” “Sorry, no thanks. How is he doing?” “The fever is what caused his unconsciousness but he’s asleep now, I gave him a shot that brought the fever down, and some antibiotics. He’ll be good as new in the morning. Make sure he gets lots of rest and fluids, okay?” “Thanks I will.” Sammy was going to be okay, but Cas was still out there and it was eating at him from the inside of his stomach. “Dammit man, where the hell are you?” Right now he could use a bottle of whiskey and a slew of strippers to make this raw feeling go away. Even with Sam doing better, he felt very uneasy after seeing all the angels fall and not knowing if he was one of them. Dammit man, pull yourself together. You sound like a teenager with a crush, come on. Sighing he put his head in his hands and tried to catch some hours while his brother did.
“Well he said it was a parting gift, that you two were good friends? And that you would understand?” John is clearly just as confused as Dean and Cas are.
With that he headed to the angel’s bedroom and stopped short when he heard muffled crying on the other side.
Harry was a very good dog, considering he was still a puppy and needed a lot of training. Sam liked the dog well enough to let him sleep at the foot of his bed curled up beside his feet. He would make a good guard dog someday, perhaps, so far he loved everybody he met. Even Dean, and Dean hated dogs. It probably had something to do with being teared to shreds by hellhounds before he was sent to hell. No doubt. Sam got up and stretched, before looking around for Harry’s leash. This morning they would go on a test run together, hopefully the pup could keep up. He didn’t exactly run fifty miles an hour but he tried to keep up a fast pace. Aha there it is, right next to the bowl… Maybe he should feed the dog first, he poured some dog food into the bowl and the pup’s ears immediately shot up. Soon he was eating the food and wagging his tail, content with his new home. “Come on boy, we’re gonna go running.” Clipping the leash onto Harry he walked out of the room, and grabbed an apple to eat before running. “Sam? Where are you going?” He turned to face the familiar angel, “Harry and I are going to go running. You can come if you’d like. Although I think Dean would miss you seeing how you’re only in your boxers…” Cas blushed “Oh, my apologies,*snap* better? Yes Dean would miss me but he’s fast asleep. Shouldn’t be up for hours, what are you doing with Harry?” Sam raised his eyebrows “Um yeah, it’s fine, but um no I’m good and I’m going to bring him with me for some bonding. Go back to bed. Enjoy it while it lasts.” “Sam, you miss the blonde lady. Don’t you? I know it brings you great sorrow to think of her. Jessica? Correct? And Amelia? These people were of great significance to you, I know, but I can tell you, they aren’t your soulmates. Your soulmate is still out there. I just wanted you to know.” “Thanks Cas, but how did you know about Jess and Amelia? Did Dean tell you?” “Yes and no, he told me about Amelia but I’ve seen these women in your head, I know now that it was wrong to pry into your thoughts and I apologize. As the Winchester’s guardian angel I felt it primitive to watch over your mental health as well as your physical.” He knew he felt somebody watching him, and Dean had called him paranoid. Oh well. “It’s k man I know you weren’t being nosey. But yes I do miss them, every day. Especially now that Dean and you are together, I mean before we were both single and I didn’t feel so bad. I’m happy for you two believe me, but now I feel like I’m the bridesmaid from 27 dresses. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride. Except I wouldn’t want to be a bride, just never mind. Thanks man, I’m better now that I have Harry.” “I thought he would help, Dean mentioned you liked dogs, and well they are lovable creatures. Not as lovable as my tiny pigs though.” “Yeah, have fun with that man, I’m going running, see ya later.” Cas walked back to the room to cuddle with Dean before he woke up and noticed the absence of warmth. As Sam left the bunker, Harry in hand, he thought about how he had planned a future with Jess in college. He was going to be a lawyer, her a nurse, and they would get married and have kids someday. They talked about having a little girl, and naming her Mary after his mother. If they had a boy they would name him Dean, after his brother. Jess didn’t mind, she loved the names and knew it made him happy. Dammit if he didn’t miss her gorgeous smile every day. It had been a long time since he had allowed himself to think about her for this long, but now that time had passed he allowed himself to grieve properly. The healthy way. If they had kids he had always hoped that they would look like her, beautiful in every way. Harry’s barking brought him back into the real world. “What is it boy?” “Your dog is cute, what’s his name?” Sam looked up at the woman sporting a pit bull on a walker leash, she was tall, freakishly tall like Sam, and in fact he was only an inch taller than her. Huh, this was new. She had dirty blonde hair and brown eyes, her pale skin was a little red giving way that she had spent some time outside. “Harry, actually I just got him yesterday. Aren’t pit bulls illegal in Kansas?” The woman frowned at him, “Pit bulls are not illegal and they’re not dangerous. All dogs have the potential to be dangerous it all depends on their owners. Her name is Sally…What’s your name?” She had sass, he had to admit, “Sam, Sam Winchester, you?” “Sally, I just said that. Oh” “Sally it’s nice to meet you. What’s your pup’s name?” It was his turn to be sassy and apparently she liked it because she smiled, “Her name is lucky.” He bent down to pet lucky, “Hi lucky. You’re just a cute attack dog aren’t you?!” “Hmf, well yours has really big ears.” Getting up he tilted his head, “Uh yeah, Harry’s a beagle, they tend to have big ears. They’re hunting dogs.” “So I guess that means you’re a hunter then huh?” “Sort of, not in the conventional way, no. I only hunt when necessary, I don’t believe in killing for sport though, no. I actually prefer vegetables myself.” So he just told a complete stranger way to much about himself, but she looked harmless enough. He was sporting his gun and demon knife anyways just in case. Harry barked, before peeing on the side of the road. “Good boy, who’s a good boy?” Sam gave the dog a treat and patted him on the head. “House training, are we?” Sighing he stood up, “Yes. Now if you’ll excuse me Harry and I were going for a run.” “Great, us too. Maybe we’ll see you around huh big guy?” She winked before running away. Damn this girl was forward, and sassy. Not wanting to seem like a creep and watch her ass as she ran away he turned towards the opposite direction, “Come on boy.” What the hell, who did she think she was? He’d never thought himself to be ugly, but he’d never been hit on like that before. Dean was always the one women were coming up to and flirting with. He liked to think the type of women he liked had more respect for themselves than that, and yet he couldn’t get this gorgeous tall women out of his mind. Her eyes reminded him of honey. They were a light brown that he had never seen before. Dude, creepy. He really needed to get laid, it had been awhile and he was definitely needing more than a dog in his bed at night. Maybe he would go to a bar tonight, yeah sure that was totally going to happen. Not. If only he could be like Dean and just fall into bed with any woman and leave her the next morning. He had done it before but he was soulless and numb from escaping the cage in hell. Never again had he fallen into bed with a random stranger and not bothered to call her again. Besides, he had a bad track record with his dates. 90% of them had wound up dead. He didn’t like putting those odds on a person, instead he just ran every morning and jerked one off in the shower afterwards when he actually had time to, that is. It’d be nice if he had a woman to do that for him from time to time he had to admit. Sometimes he wished he hadn’t stabbed Ruby, she was after all the best sex he had ever had. It was so raw and pure, it was nothing but physical attraction, and that is what always drove him over to the edge. That and the blood lust that was there was also a big turn on. Kind of like a vampire thing. Weird. Now he’d give his left nut to pin her up against a wall again, and just take her then and there. Each time they fucked it was a new experience, she even tied him up once. Hell she was a freak in so many ways. Shit, he was getting hard thinking about the demon, which is what she is Sam, a demon. Get your shit together Winchester. He thought about Dean and Cas in bed and whew it’s down. Thank God he didn’t have to go very far with that train of thought. He ran as he listened to it had to be you on his iPod, he knew that damn song would get stuck in his mind. It was a good song though, catchy and it had good lyrics to it. As he reached a picnic table at a park he stopped and sat down drinking his water. Stopping only to give Harry some from the cap. “Are you following me?” Shit he recognized the voice of the lady from earlier. “No, I can leave though if you’d like. I actually went the opposite way so it wouldn’t seem like I was a creep…”  “I know. I watched your ass as you ran, but this park is in the middle, both roads kind of come full circle to it. I did enjoy watching you be a gentlemen though. Nice ass. 10 out of 10. I can tell you work out.” What the hell, this woman was really forward. “Thanks, I think?” He rolled his eyes and took a granola bar out of his pocket and paused his still playing music. “Sinatra eh? Either you must really love that eighties movie my parents named me after or you’re just a nerd. So which is it? My guess is both.” Looking up at her honey eyes he sighed, “Listen, I don’t know you, you don’t know me, for all you know I could be a complete psychopath. Word of advice lady? Don’t share information with random strangers okay?” “Jesus, I was just being friendly and we’re not strangers. You’re Sam Winchester, you told me your name, which means no longer strangers in my rule book.” “Sally, okay Sally who?” “Names Sally Singer. I’m a teacher at Lawrence High School, vegan and a liberal. Nice to meet you.” Singer? Bobby had a kid? Don’t get too crazy now, there are a lot of Singers out there. He was sure she wasn’t related to Bobby. Sam and Dean were the only kids Bobby ever had, that he knew of anyways. “Nice to meet you too, are you related to Bobby Singer by any chance?” “Never heard of him. Name sounds familiar though. What’s it to you?” “Nothing, I used to know him. He passed awhile back.” A look of sadness washed over Sally’s face. “I’m sorry for your loss, so how long have you had Harry here?” Didn’t he tell her he just got him? “I just got him last night, I thought I mentioned it earlier?” He had, he was sure of it. “Yeah, probably, but I was probably too busy looking at your sexy face.” This woman had no shame, what so ever. “Sorry if that makes you uncomfortable, I uh guess you don’t get that often, huh? You should though, you’re very handsome.” He blushed, he hadn’t heard it that often, most people just made remarks about his height or hair. A few said he was handsome, but mostly it was his older brother who received all those comments. “No, but thank you. You’re not bad looking yourself…” She smiled at him before sitting down next him, and saying “So you’re not a psychopath or anything right? I couldn’t help but notice you said something about that earlier…” “Um, no. At least I don’t think so.” “Good” was all she said before grabbing his hand to write a number on it. “There’s my number, shoot me a text sometime if you ever want to bump uglies in the night or want to just talk about dogs and what not.” She winked at him before getting up and jogging away Lucky in hand. “Thanks. I’ll think about it.” Sure enough there was a number on his hand with a winky face next to it. Dean would love to hear about this, if he wasn’t too occupied that is. On the run home he thought about Sally, how bold she was. How different and exciting she seemed to be. Never had he been with anybody close to that, he always chose steady and safe, except for Ruby but she was a demon. That whole relationship was unsafe. Which added to the thrill of it, but this girl was even more exciting than Ruby. Sally was exciting in a new way, whereas Ruby was only dangerous and exciting in a physical manner. Great, now he was going to be thinking about her again. Dean and Cas, Dean and Cas. Whew his hard on was gone. That’d be hard to explain, ha hard. Okay Dean, something that immature was something his brother would laugh at not him. He had his moments though, but unlike the older Winchester he kept them inside his head, which wasn’t always a good thing. “Sammy, is that you?!” “Yeah Dean, just getting back from a run with Harry. What’s that smell?” His brother stood in a pink frilly apron with a roller in hand, he couldn’t help but laugh. “Dude, you going domestic on me?” “Can it. It doesn’t look any more ridiculous than Cas’s does. I mean it has bees on it.” “So? Bees aren’t pink and frilly. What are you cooking now?” Castiel appeared from the kitchen in a yellow apron with tiny insects scattered across it, “We’re baking a pie” he said before grinning up at his boyfriend. Eck. “Get a room. You two are to lovey dovey, you’re making me sick! If you start using pet names and calling each other Dean Weeny and stuff I’ll hurl.” They both frowned before looking at each other and saying “Pumpkin and sweetie pie” to each other. “Hey what’s that on your hand? Ooh Sammy has a number!” Shit, he had forgotten to put that in his phone and wash it off. “I met a girl while running. Very bold, you’d like her. Not my type though, she’s too straight forward. Said she watched my ass as I ran away. Weird right?” The angel turned his head, “Not at all, many women look at guy’s buttocks a lot. It seems to be attractive to them, I can understand why.” His brother turned around and squeezed the shorter man’s ass before saying “Yeah you can” with a sly smirk. “Dean, we’re making Sam uncomfortable.” “So?” “He’s right it’s making me super uncomfortable. I’d tell you to get a room again, but if the fire alarm goes off again I’m not cleaning it up.” They walked into the kitchen and said “We’re not, chill man. Eat some pie. It makes everything better.” On the counter was sitting several pies. “Dude, how many pies did you guys bake?” “I made a Pecan Pie but he said he wanted Apple, and so we baked an Apple, then he wanted cherry, and so on. I think he just likes pie in general, but you knew that.” Dean smiled, “I freaking love pie, but I just like seeing flour on Cas’s nose. It’s incredibly cute.” Dammit they were doing it again, they were so adorable it made him sick. Love sick. He wanted somebody to share looks with like that. Somebody to call his own. Pull it together Winchester, you sound like a teenage girl, and he was a grown man who didn’t need anybody. “You okay man? Seriously you seem a little down lately, do you need a stripper or something?” He rolled his eyes, “No. I’m fine, and whatever is going on can’t be fixed by a one night stand and some pasties. I’m just lonely I guess.” Lonely, horny, and starved for some affection, all of which a dog could not give him. “I know man, I was just trying to cheer you up. Are you really that lonely? I thought the dog would cheer you up. I’m sorry about me and Cas, I just love him so much. And for so long I hid how I feel so now I’m just overwhelmed with showing it.” He only looked at Sam for the first half of what he was saying, the rest of the time he was looking at the angel with heart eyes. “It’s not your fault, and I don’t expect you to stop or anything, I’m just jealous. Harry is great by the way, he’s helped a lot. He’s just not the same as a woman in your arms, you know?” “Yeah, okay Sammy. Well why don’t you give the girl that was eyeing your ass a call? She seemed to like you, huh?” Laughing, he replied “Uh yeah, she does. Her name is Sally Singer. Weird right? Oh and she’s tall, like only an inch shorter than me.” “Any relation to Bobby?” “No, she said she wasn’t but that the name sounded familiar.” “Sounds fishy, if you date her she better pass the tests first. You know the drill.” “Dude, not everybody is out to get us you know.” “We’re the Winchesters, of course they are.” With that he left the conversation, heading towards the letterman’s shower. “Uh, you going to leave Harry to wander the bunker like that man?” Sam yelled back to Dean, “Yeah! I figured you guys could babysit, it’ll be great practice for the future!” He could hear Cas chuckling in the background, “It’s true Dean, Harry is in good hands. I can watch over him.” Reaching the shower he peeled off his clothes, the letterman’s shower was amazing. It was just what he needed to relieve the stress, he might even be able to take a bath. Feeling the hot water on his sweaty skin he washed all the dirt and sweat away. His mind wandered away to the past year, it had been a crazy one. Mark of Cain, Dean as a demon, Cas being human, for once, he was the normal one. Charlie. He still hated himself for her death, and blamed it entirely on himself. This wasn’t healthy, he knew it, but he missed her terribly. All the women in his life were cursed, they all faced their death too soon. Amelia had probably faced the same fate… He didn’t stay on that thought too long, it hurt too much. She was alive and well, hell she was married. Quit. You need to leave the past in the past, it isn’t healthy to dwell on things. Rolling his shoulders he massaged his temples as he let the hot water flow down his back. When his hands began to wander he didn’t stop them, he let himself have this time to release himself. He deserved it after all. Hardly ever did he pleasure himself, most days he just showered and did what he needed to do for the case they were working. Usually there wasn’t any time for this, but since the Mark of Cain had been removed things were quite. They were taking a siesta for a while, so it seemed. Not that he minded any. They all needed this break. His mind didn’t have to travel very far, he imagined Sally grabbing him and having her way with him. Never had he been one for kinks, but he liked how pushy she was. In fact, he could be pushy too. Closing his eyes, he thought of pressing her against a wall and claiming her for his own personal use. Her honey eyes looking at him with lust as lightly choked her while kissing his way down her nice breasts. They were large and he had tried not to stare earlier but he couldn’t help but notice how nice and full they were in the right places. If she was here he would pay as much attention as he could to her breasts, taking time to suck on each nipple until it drove her to insanity. That would show her who was in charge. His mouth was starting to become dry at the thought and his dick was aching to be stroked and not just touched. Running his large hand up and down his length, he squeezed gently while he thought about Sally’s mouth on his balls. He just knew that she would be amazing at sucking dick, she had the perfect mouth for it. Pouty and cupid shaped lips that looked great around his cock. Closing his eyes again he thought about her taking in all of nine inches of his dick, swallowing as she did so to create some friction against his throbbing dick. Fuck-k he was going to cum soon, he could feel the coil in his stomach tightening as he gave his dick a few more pumps imagining it was her mouth the whole time. “God.” Finally he came all over the shower walls and felt himself relax, that was what he needed. Some mono-e-mono alone time. He cleaned off the shower wall and grabbed a towel to dry off. If he knew when he met Sally that he would jack himself off to her later, he would have gotten a better view of her ass, however he was trying to be a gentlemen. An attempt that went to shit apparently, because she was not concerned about being a ‘lady’. Not that he cared, he liked it. She was all lady in his mind. He definitely couldn’t run into her again now, because all he’d be thinking about is her nice mouth on his dick. Fuck. He was going to get hard again if he didn’t stop, he had stuff to do anyways. Shaking out his wet hair he put on fresh clothes before stepping out of the bathroom. “Feel better?” Damn angels. “Yes, I do. Thanks for watching Harry.” The angel smiled at him with a knowing look and smirked a bit. “Don’t be an ass.” “I don’t know what you’re talking about Sam, I only know that I distinctly heard my father’s name. Dean explained to me what that means when people say that before releasing semen.” Jesus, he forgot how literal this guy took everything. “Cas, shut up. Just forget it. Okay? I was taking care of a few things.” “Yes. I’m aware of this. Harry is fine by the way. He and Dean are asleep on the couch.” What? Dean hated dogs. “Uh? Really, you know he hates dogs’ right?” He’d have to see this for himself. Walking into the living room he saw the unthinkable. What the hell was going on with his brother? Guess he actually was going domestic. Dean was asleep with Harry curled up by his stomach with the remote in one hand and the other on the puppy. On the floor was discarded pie, he must have been too full to finish it because he never wasted pie, ever. “Isn’t he just the cutest?” the angel asked stroking his hunter’s hair. “Yeah sure.” When he left he could hear Cas humming an Elvis song, “But I can’t help falling in love with you.”
"You don't need that kind of stuff in a diner! I don't come here to be transported into an
Both of them turn to look at Dean with matching frowns but he doesn't register them. His mind is to busy listening to the clock twitch and snap with every second, the way the bedsprings creak with his weight. His skin itches and it seems no matter how many deep breaths he takes he can't shake the feeling. He's only felt this way a few times, fueled by untamable rage and with every second the anger slips further out of his control.
The thought of the IT guy gets Dean thinking, Charlie had said that he was hot which wasn't something she said a lot, yeah there was the casual 'cute' or 'good-looking' and on one occasion an unfortunate 'well, at least he has a good personality' which had ended... well, let's say the date had ended with Dean trying to fit his 6'1 figure through a small dirty bathroom window- something he's still not proud of. Maybe this IT guy could actually be, for once, what Charlie promises,
Dean rolls pathetically onto his back and looks up, as soon as he does wishing he had stayed on his front. The spotlights hanging from the ceiling shine almost unbelievably bright making an ironic halo around the top of Castiel's head as he holds out his hand for Dean to take. Dean curses internally because someone up there must really have it in for him to do something so unfair as to make Dean look like some sort of damsel.
“Nothing. Just thinking about how you’re still wearing my t-shirt.”
When he did fall asleep it was only for an hour or so. Awakened by Cas moving his knee right into his back in a sudden movement caused him to jerk awake and panic and grab the gun under the mattress.
“Right, well that’s about to change.” Turning on the radio he shoves a cassette tape into it and guitar strumming comes through the speakers.
“Well you will this year. I’ll bake a cake and everything, what flavor do you like?” It was a stupid question, he knew, but he asked anyways.
