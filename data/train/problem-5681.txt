“I’m so mad at you,” Steve says, gently. “I’m fucking furious. And I think I’m most pissed about the fact that you just left without letting anyone check out your injuries. And I’m mad that this”—he raps at the arc reaction in Tony’s chest— “powers the suit
“It’s more than that,” Loki says evenly. “If it was a cold it wouldn’t have had such a problem but—you call him Baby, correct?—Baby didn’t just heal your cold. It was your heart, your anemia, your asthma, your scoliosis, your color-blindness. How have you not noticed? He’s give you so much.”
“But what if he’s just a baby? I can’t put a baby dragon out on the streets! Not in weather like this! Not this time of year! Dragons need warmth and it’s thirty-seven degrees outside. And raining.”
Steve looks at her: looks at the way she holds herself, a small little smile playing on her lips, her hands in nice navy blue gloves and a cream colored coat. She’s not wearing heals.
But even as he buries his face in Tony’s sweat covered neck, he has to acknowledge the fact that not only does he have a soulmate out there somewhere, but so does Tony.
He heads to his lab and tries not to look at Steve's things, nestled in the corner like they belong there.
The fact that one of their most mouthy members hasn’t given so much as a ‘by your leave’ in the last five minutes is concerning. The fact that Ironman is also one of their most self-sacrificing members makes it even more worrisome.
as I am small and insignificant as I was in every other aspect of my life and will only break by true love’.”
“You don’t have to,” Steve coughs out. “Baby can fetch me things. You should go help Sam and the guys.”
“No, I said, ‘This goddamn dragon won’t stop rubbing his fucking face on my head, come over and watch it go crazy for a laser pointer.’”
Before Steve can try to force his foot farther down his throat with an apology, Stark flashes through a series of hand signs. A British sounding voice issues from Stark’s breast pocket,
Steve is getting tired of not knowing. He’s tired of sitting across from the most gorgeous man to ever exist and feeling lost every time he asks a question. He’s tired of waiting for JARVIS to translate.
“You’re like a cat,” Steve says, rubbing at Baby’s soft gold belly scales, “except I’m not allergic to you. Maybe I should google ‘dragon expert instead.’”
“I’m his bodyguard when I’m not doing Avengers business. Figured it’d probably be good to know when and why people are hanging around him.”
“‘Fun Bearded Dragon Facts and Information,’ ‘Bearded Dragons, Lizards,’ ‘Are Dragons Real?’” Steve hums and looks over at Baby, who’s sitting next to him on the couch now. “Those don’t really sound helpful. Think you can manage to tell me what kind of dragon you are?”
Steve looks over to see Tony standing by the open circuitry of one of Black Widow's gauntlets. Seeing he has Steve’s attention, Tony asks, WHO—SIGN—TEACH—YOU—WHO?
“I love you, too, Tony.” Steve wraps his arms around Tony and draws him close. “But don’t think this gets you off the hook for the whole ‘secretly Ironman’ thing.”
Bucky grunts. “It’s fine, Steve.” He raises his left arm, the metal fingers flexing and waving.  “Stark Cybernetic Prosthetics is an amazing branch of S.I.”
Tony’s hunched over the spinal circuitry, his lips moving silently as he mentally works through what he has dubbed ‘The Servo Problem’. He knows he can get the response times even faster, he
“That is yet to be seen.” Loki rubs a hand down Baby’s spined back and raises his hand, flicking his fingers like they have dust on them. “He’s covered in a dark spell. It’s keeping him small and weak. His natural red magic was defending him but very recently he used a great portion of it on you two. I can see it, hanging around your mind,” he points to Bucky, “and your torso,” he points to Steve. “He must care about you two a great deal, to risk so much.”
Tony smiles like he won something precious. Steve does his best to commit the image to his memory, so he can sketch it out later.
Unfortunately, he also feels too exposed to ask Pepper, or Rhodey, or, god forbid, Clint to help teach him how to sign so he does what any self-respecting man with a crush would do: he goes to the library.
“Anyway, jumping right in.” Tony clears his throat. “So basically, I figured out that Stane was selling Stark weapons to the Black Market overseas in the Middle East. I’d confronted him, which was a
But Steve’s never needed to show off his Words more than he does right at this moment. He leans into Tony’s space, brushing their lips together softly, and begs, “Please, let me show you.”
Tony pulls back and holds his fingertips to his nose and then, as if flicking water off his hand, splays his hand out flat between them. He kisses Steve again.
Tony takes a step back before Janet can reach him. He splays his hand out flat and taps his thumb to his chest.
Tony thinks about Steve’s words a lot, too. The cuff Steve wears—sometimes leather, sometimes fabric—goes halfway up his forearm. Whatever his soulmate has to say, it must be a lot. Must speak for a solid three minutes at least. Tony wonders if it’s a prompt or a response. He wonders if the writing is big or small, if it’s even legible.
his chest of drawers to his books shelf and then, finally, back to on top of Steve’s bed where he curls up on Steve’s pillow.
“What do you want to eat? I have—” But before Steve can finish the front door opens and Bucky walks through it, just as drenched as Steve and the dragon had been.
Steve doesn’t quite remember how the topic got started. Someone must have asked about soulmarks or mentioned them in some other way. Maybe Janet? She and Hank are a Matched Pair after all.
The dragon chirps again before it moves to the basket under the sink, the one full of cleaning supplies and hand tools. The dragon grabs the basket with its front claws and tips it over. It picks through the mess until it find a wrench. Picking the tool up in its snout, the dragon bounds over to Steve’s feet and sets it down with another little chirp.
The dragon yawns, showing his bright, sharp teeth. Steve rubs under the dragon’s chin with his knuckles.
Tony tries not to think about how his words make sense now. Tries not to think that the first thing his soulmate will say to him is about his disability. Tries not to flinch every time he hears someone say the same phrase he has marked on the left side of his rib cage, just under his pectoral.
They spend the rest of the morning changing the towel and trying to comfort the distressed dragon. Bucky falls asleep with his arm awkwardly twisted on the bed more than once. Steve sandwiches himself upside down between the wall and his mattress and doesn’t even doze. Baby occasionally butts his head against whichever part of Steve he can reach to comfort the man.
Tony is shockingly patient with Steve, slowing his usual rapid-fire pace to something that gives Steve time to understand the sign before he moves on to the next one and taking the time to fingerspell the meaning of any sign that Steve doesn’t know yet.
Steve rolls his cuff off his wrist and shoves it in his pocket. He takes Tony’s hand and places it against his bare wrist and then presses his hand to Tony’s ribs, where his words are, thumb stoking lightly against his shirt.
As Steve walks into the lab, he spots Tony standing in the small kitchenette, raking his hands through his hair with his back towards the door. He looks like he’s shaking.
There’s a long pause before Jane responds. “Uhm, let me transfer you to our medical team, okay? I’m actually just temping for my girlfriend soo…”
“Uhm,” Steve clears his throat, eyes trailing back to his closed notebook. This one is completely full of Stark’s hands, all of them mid-motion, some of them labeled with the signs Steve’s been able to pick up. A few he’s sure on are the signs for ‘shield’ (one arm raised, hand fisted, as if blocking an attack at chest height while the other hand makes an open palmed, upward arching motion over it), ‘tech’ (one hand held at an angle across the chest while tapping at the flashy edge of the palm with the middle finger of the other hand while splaying out the other fingers), and ‘no’ (the index and middle fingers making a single open-closed motion towards the thumb). Stark mostly directs the last one towards his bots, thankfully.
“Thanks,” Steve says slowly. “You know, you’re pretty smart. Do you have a name or, actually, a family that’s missing you?”
Baby gives a little sleepy chirp as he crawls out from his warm miniature den. Steve watches as the dragon hops off the edge of the bed and then slinks under it. A moment later, Baby pops back out, a little dust covered, but with Steve’s glasses in his snout.
And Steve just fucking shrugs tells Ironman that Tony always seems so lonely and he knows what that’s like. No one should have to be alone.
Loki looks at Steve, then at Bucky, as if appraising them. Then he says, “He shouldn’t be this small. He’s covered in a dark magic not his own and yet both of you are covered in his,” he nods to Baby, “red magic. Do you know what this means?”
“You seem to be spending quite a lot of time down in Mr. Stark’s lab lately. Anything I should know about?”
The dragon leaps off the bed and follows Steve back into the bathroom. Steve collects his pocket contents from his wet clothes, wrings them out, and then gathers them up to throw in the wash. He throws one of the used towels on the floor to collect the puddles and it’s then that the dragon decides to help.
Steve has the good graces to look confused. And then, suddenly, he’s rubbing a closed fist over his chest in a circle and telling Tony it’s not pity. That he really does enjoy the time they spend together and that he likes being down in the lab because it’s the only peaceful place in the mansion some days.
He’d tell Rhodey how grateful he is that the other man even exists. Rhodey learned ASL for him. They’d met before the crash that took his voice and Rhodey was the one to remind him ASL was an option. Rhodey was the one to get him through the resulting depression that is Tony’s life.
Baby trills, accepts Steve’s apology, and snatches the sausage out of Steve’s hand before taking it to the other end of the couch to eat. Baby does this for all of breakfast, snatching food from Steve’s fingers and walking off to eat it before coming back for more. The dragon lets out a happy little trill every time Steve offers him more food.
Steve sees the blood first, covering half of Tony’s face. He sees the wiring and the jagged metal, sees the hole in the suit. And then—
Baby trills, bouncing on the edge of the couch, little claws gripping the piping of the cushion for stability. The dragon tills again.
When the doorbell rings, Steve’s across the entire apartment in a flash, door wrenched open before he even checks the peephole.
After the enemy is defeated, Tony lands gently and quietly amongst the rest of the Avengers. His face is covered in his own blood, dripping red into his suit, and heart in his throat.
Placing the bar back on the bench press, Steve looks up to where Ironman’s been spotting him for the last twenty minutes.
Tony doesn’t bother asking Clint. The little shit wouldn’t give him a straight answer. Probably just tease Tony from across the room like he usually does. (Yeah, you keep making that open-closed hand motion over your heart and Tony’s gonna punch it.)
Tony shrugs a shoulder, sets the ice back down and signs about his therapist. About the meetings and all the training because he wanted to be able to say something to Steve.
The dragon stares at him for a long moment before it slowly releases its little claws from his shirt. Gently, Steve sets it on the counter. Steve tosses his jacket into the tub before grabbing a towel.
The dragon looks at Steve and then bounds over. Steve bends and plucks the little red ball of energy off the floor and sets him on the counter. The dragon butts his head against Steve’s chin.
Steve blinks, coming back into the conversation a minute late and a foot behind. “What was that?” He asks, carefully closing his sketchbook.
He checks in with them quickly, nodding when they say they’re fine. He’s about to turn to check in with Clint and a few of the recently arrived SHIELD agents when he hears a soft gasp.
“Do you need—?” Steve starts but Tony’s already grabbing the ice pack from the table and pressing it to his neck.
The woman Tony meets with, a doctor by the name of Veda Shankar, tells him that because he waited so long to seek therapy, he may never regain full use of his voice.
Tony shakes his head again and then pulls back to explain. Signs out his reasons and beliefs and how he just wants to make up for his sins. Tony explains everything. About the suit and how it works and about Afghanistan and Yensen and the car crash and all the tech he created—the good and the bad—and about Obie and about Howard.
The little dragon jumps on the towel and pushes his head and shoulders into it, his hind legs pushing against the tiles and he slides halfway across the bathroom.
Loki is sitting on Steve’s bed, hand hovering over Baby’s bare back, damp towel tossed towards Steve’s pillow.
Words on Tony’s side! He said that! And he remembers it clearly because the visceral embarrassment he felt from the interaction still lingers in the back of his mind, years later.
“And these are all…” Steve rests his cheek on his fist, thinking. “…Tools. They’re all tools. Aren’t they?”
Steve comes back with a wet hand towel and a pitcher of lukewarm water. It sloshes as he sets it on his nightstand but he’s too busy climbing onto his pillows so he can easily drape the clothe over the dragon’s back and wings
Steve gently detangles himself and, uncaring of the mess, curls against Tony’s sweaty side, tucking his head under Tony’s chin.
Steve looks down, pushing the towel to his shoulders. “A wrench?” he asks, raising an eyebrow. “That doesn’t tell me much, little dragon.”
The door to the lab bangs open so suddenly and so loudly that Tony drops his ice pack when he nearly jumps out of his skin.
Stark, sitting at his work bench, hunched over an Ironman suit to look for repairs, waves him in. He signs something quickly.
Baby is growling, a low rattle Steve’s never heard before. Bucky looks just as uncomfortable, but he hasn’t moved because Baby is still on his arm.
“That’s weird,” Steve says hours later. “Everything I’ve found says that for Baby’s colors and characteristics, he should be the size of a house, at least. Cat and dog sized dragons are usually brown or green. Earthy colors.”
Steve raises an eyebrow, sparing a second to try to decide if Natasha is actually drunk on the two post-battle beers she’s had or just pretending. But then her words really catch up to him.
know. Knows that there’s nothing good to Tony Stark. Will know, now, that there is nothing good to Ironman either. That both of the men Steve considered his friends are lies and he won’t want to even see either again.
But in the silence Tony just bends his right hand at the knuckles and arcs his fingertips into his left palm.
The dragon is already clawing at Steve’s bedroom door when Steve finally leaves the bathroom, cheeks back to their normal color.
Tony’ll be going on three hours of binge-building and Steve’ll trump down the stairs, platter of food in one hand and a book in the other and he’ll just set the food on the nearest clear space and sit in the nearest clean seat and just read or draw quietly.
Tony wishes this was an accident. Wishes he feeling of Steve’s palms cupping his face wasn’t so addictive. Wishes he could push Steve away and snap a ‘no’ at him. Wishes he didn’t crave the feeling of Steve’s lips against his or Steve’s tongue in his mouth as much as he does. Wishes it was an accident so that when the whole illusion comes crashing down, maybe it won’t hurt as much.
Baby is still in the middle of Steve’s bed, whimpering and clawing at the sheets. He’s a tiny little ball of heat and Bucky can feel it before his even tries to touch the dragon.
Immediately, Steve drops his portfolio and rushes over to the end of the alley. “Are you okay?” he asks again as he tries to shove the dumpster away.
, Steve! Those things are dangerous! This is worse than that angry raccoon you brought home three years ago.”
Steve never takes the cuff off, not even for sex, and the one time Tony had asked what it says—because Steve’s seen Tony’s words curling across his ribs, has run his hands over them and pressed is lips to them in small, soft kisses—Steve says it doesn’t matter before pulling away, just slightly, just enough. Just enough for Tony to know that Steve still cares about them—both his words and his soulmate. Just enough for Tony to know that he doesn’t matter to Steve quite as much as he wants to.
“Seriously?” Steve asks his reflection. He’s in a Starbucks by his art school and he can’t quite believe it’s raining so hard in
He thinks about what he knows about Tony. About how the man lost both his parents and his voice on the same night at only twenty-one. About how it seems that his closest friends are his college roommate, an ex-girlfriend, his own assistant, and his two hired bodyguards. He thinks about how he calls his dad an asshole and how he was betrayed and nearly killed by the only other father figure he’d ever had. He thinks about the small arc reactor in the glass case that says,
When Steve arrives at his apartment, he sticks his head through the door and glances around for his roommate, Bucky.
From the corner of his eye, he first spots Janet’s bright black and yellow costume. Then, as he does a double take, he sees Ironman, his bright red and gold unmistakable. But then he sees the blood covering Ironman’s bare face, sees the familiar, exhausted look in his eyes, sees
“Okay, that’s a ‘yes.’” Steve laughs, placing hand on the dragons back to hold him in place. He rubs his thumb against the dragon’s scales and walks into the kitchen.
“I’d really like to take you out some place nice and buy you dinner. And not just as a ‘thank you’ but as a date. I sorta fe—I think you’re pretty awesome. And this time I can talk back and everything!”
Tony grabs Steve’s wrist, shaking his head desperately, because if those aren’t his words under there, then he doesn’t need to know.
“Oh! Right!” Tony snaps a hand. “I wanted to explain a few things to you! Since you were probably wondering why I was cursed in the first place.”
Natasha hums, opening the fridge. She returns the greeting with an even, “Good morning.” She grabs out the orange juice and pours herself a glass. Leaning against the counter she watches him for a long moment.
“I get it, Tony. I do,” Steve says. “And you’re not any of those things people have said you are. You’re not an idiot. You’re not a monster. You’re just not.”
Tony can see her eyes widen and her jaw drop. Her hands fly to her face and in a second she’s crossed the ten feet that separate them and goes to press a bundle of gauze to his face.
“Baby,” Steve starts, but Baby launches himself at Steve’s chest, nuzzling and chirping. Steve smiles down at the wriggling mess of dragon on his torso.
When Bucky finally leaves for the VA center, Steve is half asleep on the couch with Baby curled under the blankets against his chest. The dragon purrs and nuzzles his snout next to Steve’s neck.
Tony asks Pepper about it. About Steve and if he hangs out with the other Avengers like he hangs out in Tony’s lab.
Before he can stop himself, he says, “You know, you can call me by my first name, too. If—if you want to. You don’t have to call me Captain all the time.”
Steve hums, nodding, but his chest is still in a vise. He hasn’t had an asthma attack since the forties but this feels damn close.
Tony, with his chin hooked over Steve’s shoulder, can feel tears starting to roll down his cheeks. Damnit. Tony isn’t a crier but right now, with Steve’s face in his neck, he can’t help it. Can’t stop the burning feeling of being loved from tearing him apart.
“A kitten? No, he’d be white and his wings wouldn’t be grown in yet. It says here he’s what’s called a ‘Red Imperial Dragon’ but with his tail spikes longer than his snout but shorter than his wings, he’s probably only in early adulthood. But just… really,
Steve figures he can always go to one of the libraries in the city but, before driving all the way out there, decides to see what he can find online.
So when Tony finally asks Steve, Steve sort of blushes and stammers—adorably—and points to himself. And then Steve splays his hands out vertically, bends his middle fingers in and moves them back and forth against each other not quite touching them together.
Tony would tell Steve, again and again, how much he loves him. Over and over until he loses his voice again.
people say his Words to him, Steve among them. Tony, who—out of everyone Steve knows—most deserves to meet his soulmate, deserves the fabled happiness that comes with meeting your fated other half. Tony, whose soulmate must be Blank.
Tony tries to tell himself that Steve isn’t his soulmate. He tries to tell himself that somewhere out there, there is someone who says the words that Steve keeps hidden under a brown leather wrist cuff that goes halfway up his forearm. Tony tries to convince himself that Steve isn’t his.
Steve clears his throat. It’s awkward, sitting with Tony now that he’s in his human form. Mostly because he’s human now and it turns out he’s probably the most famous person in the United States right now. Also, one of the most good looking.
“Y-yes.” Steve glances at Thor, second guessing Loki’s even voice. But Thor just smiles from where he’s leaning in the doorway. “In an alleyway down by the art school campus.”
“What’s up? Did Sam finally convince you to let him drag you into the supply closet? Are we gonna gossip about it? Is he a good kisser?”
Steve looks down at where Baby is butting his head against his chest. “Where they being mean to you?”
“I need—,” Steve starts, tugging his arms out of the sleeves. It leaves him in his t-shirt, jacket falling uselessly to the floor. And then Steve starts rolling the edge of his fabric cuff down.
Tony drops the ice pack to the table, cups Steve’s cheeks with his cold hands, and shakes his head. Tony feels tears prickle in his eyes. He shakes his head again, not willing to let go of Steve to explain yet. When Steve meets his eyes again, Tony catches a glimpse of the small boy from Brooklyn that Steve used to be. The one he still feels like some days. The one that’s used to falling short and not being enough.
Tony stumbles into the room, half-dressed and half-asleep. “Steve,” he says again, voice tight, as he moves into Steve’s space. He snakes his arms around Steve’s waist and buries his face in Steve’s shoulder.
. How the hell has he led this team for years, lived at Tony’s mansion for years, and yet never realized that he’s never actually seen Tony, his lover, in the same room as Ironman, his teammate? How did he ever think that Tony—strong, brave, charismatic, compassionate, brilliant, upstanding Tony—could ever sit idly by while someone else put their life on the line for him?
So Tony spends every moment he can spare in the suit, talking to Steve, to Pepper, and to the rest of the team. He pretends that this is what his life would have been like if he’d never gotten into that car that his father was driving. Pretends that there’s nothing wrong and that his life isn’t the goddamn train wreck that it is. Tony pretends he deserves the friends he has. Pretends that maybe whatever is under Steve’s cuff is something common, like his, but something that Tony could have said to him in the suit.
“Dunno, they haven’t got a ransom message yet.” Steve grabs his plate off the table and moves to sit up, Baby rolling off his chest with a disgruntled chirp. Steve grabs a sausage off the plate and holds it out to the dragon.
They’re going to throw him off the team. For sure, now that they know Ironman is Tony Stark, they’ll know he doesn’t deserve to be a hero. Tony’s too broken and dirty, his record far too bloody. They won’t let him be Ironman anymore.
When Tony finally looks up from the wiring, it’s like in the movies—where the whole world stands still and it’s just the two of them. Tony’s never seen that look on anyone’s face before. And certainly never directed at him.
“Can someone—pants?” the man asks, voices slurred. He moves shakily, pushing himself up onto his hands and folding his legs under himself. He flops over and leans against the wall, eyes closed, face bright red.
Tony snorts, not dignifying Clint with a response. But, after a moment’s consideration, he stands and lifts his shirt.
Steve, as with most romantic inclinations in his life, has no idea what to do about it. So he does what he usually does when it comes to his love life: he flounders.
Baby darts inside the machine, chirping and sniffing at the dishes. He comes back out just as fast, though, because it’s cold in there.
Steve asks why Tony never told him. Never told the rest of the Avengers. Steve tells him how mad he is. Mad that Tony just left after being injured. Mad that Steve, as leader of the Avengers, was never informed that Ironman had a heart condition. Mad that the arch reactor in Tony’s chest powered the suit, too. Mad about how much danger Tony was putting himself in. Mad because he cares so damn much.
Steve feels his face heat and he glances towards the doorway, as if Stark’s going to walk through it at any second.
“Thank you,” Loki says. He holds a hand out and Baby gently reaches his snout out to sniff at the offered limb. Baby suddenly pitches forward and butts his head into Loki’s palm. Haltingly, the dragon moves off of Bucky’s metal arm and collapses against Loki’s side.
Steve still thinks of it now, weeks later, laying in Tony’s king size bed, sheets tangled around their hips. Thinks about how Tony had simply signed, AGAIN, and there was nothing Steve could do to resist.
Steve’s eyes cut to Natasha before he can stop them. She’s smirking, like she usually does when she knows she’s got the upper hand.
He says, “I know. I’ve always known, in a way.” He kisses Tony again and says, “I love you, too. ... But don’t think this gets you off the hook for the whole ‘secretly Ironman’ thing.”
“Thanks,” Steve says to Loki. He looks back at the man, who’s just holding the pants on his lap instead of moving to put them on. Steve can’t help but notice the guy’s lashes are incredibly dark. It’s as he’s studying the man’s face that Steve realizes he knows who this man is.
Steve shrugs, “I looked it up when I first found him and for his coloring, he should have a human form. I didn’t want to pressure him if he was scared or uncomfortable. If he just needed a place to stay for a bit, it’s no trouble to me.” Steve trails the side of his thumb down Baby’s long neck.
Steve’s lips twist. With a somewhat bitter laugh, he says, “I’m sure we both know how accurate the media can be. It was only slightly more reliable in the forties.”
Steve stills and looks down at his bare forearm. He hadn’t bothered putting his cuff on when he passed out the night before and he’d forgot to replace it when he left the room this morning.
It’s not so much that Stark’s face changes as that the very air in the room seems to congeal, heavy and thick and cold. But then, as quickly as it came, the feeling disappears, brushed away by Stark’s soft sigh.
“Okay, towels first,” Steve says, flicking open the cabinet by the sink. He grabs a few fluffy, shockingly orange towels and sets them on the counter.
“Okay,” Steve says, clicking the hair drier off and setting it on the counter. “I’m gonna dry off while you… look around. Okay?”
Watching his retreating back, Steve gets the sudden feeling that he upset his friend with his answer.
To Happy, he’d tell him every lame joke he’d ever thought the man would like but relied on homophones for the punch lines. They just didn’t translate as well in sign sometimes.
“Really? I thought I brought them into my room,” but Steve goes to look anyway. “They’re not there!”
Like many things that happen in Tony’s life, it happens in the lab, while he’s working on the next Ironman suit.
“Tony,” Steve whispers, feeling suddenly lost. He wants to gather Tony up in his arms and hold him until he stops looking like he’s waiting to get hit.
“Do you need—?” Steve starts, looking for the forgotten ice pack but Tony’s already grabbing it from the table and pressing it to his neck.
Steve takes a deep breath while he stares at the phone in his hand.  He looks up at Bucky and tries to give a reassuring smile.
Steve tries not to think about that as they pull up to what looks like a service entrance. Pepper knocks on the door and a man Steve recognizes as James ‘Rhodey’ Rhodes open the door.
“The sounds you make,” Steve says, quietly. “I like them. You hum along to songs in the lab sometimes when you’re happy. I like knowing that you’re happy.”
Tony moves forward and, instead of the kiss Steve is half expecting, Tony rubs their cheeks together.
The first thing Steve notices about the room is that it’s very big and very bright. One whole wall is windows.
Loki moves off the bed and over to his co-worker. They whisper to each other in their native language and Bucky goes to sit in the chair at Steve’s drafting table.
Embarrassingly, all Steve says is, “Oh, shit. You! It’s you! You’re okay!” and he lurches forward to tackle the man in a hug before he thinks better of it.
Pepper smiles and shakes his hand, quick and firm. “First of all, I want to say thank you for taking care of Tony. He can be a handful. So, thank you.”
From the corner of his eye he can see Ironman stand and leave the room. While part of the dismissal hurts, at least Steve won’t have to worry about fighting ol’ Shellhead.
Something like fear twists Tony’s face and, with the barest twitch of his head, he takes to the air.
“You sure?” Bucky asks. “You sure you’re not actually dead and I’m talking to your evil twin, Scumbag Steve?”
Tony grinds out a desperate keen, hands grabbing at the nape of Steve’s neck, pressing their foreheads together and keeping Steve close.
Finally, after all the yelling and pacing and hair pulling, Steve asks who did know. Asks if he just wasn’t important enough to tell, says it with a little defeated half shrug.
Loki nods, “I’d thought not.” He shifts, laying his torso on the bed so he’s face level with Baby. He speaks directly to the dragon, “I will not hurt you. As a promise between dragons, I am here to help you. The growling is making you weak.”
He paces, one hand on the ice, the other tugging at his hair or his shirt or pulling at his bottom lip.
“I liked it,” he admits. “I liked living with you. And Bucky. And then I got really sick. And then you called the other dragons and then I got pneumonia. But I’m better now.”
“Then again,” Steve says, sitting in the chair by the bed, “you might not remember Bucky saying that.”
Steve suddenly finds himself furious again. He pulls back, scrubbing his hands through his hair and pacing up and down the length of the nearby workbench.
When Tony pulls back, some interminable time later, he signs a simple, I LOVE YOU, and presses it to Steve’s chest. For as many times as Steve’s has said it aloud, this is the first time he’s gotten it back. Steve cups his hands around Tony’s, reverently.
“I thought,” he stops, glancing back at the car. Steve clears his throat. “I thought he was still in the hospital.”
“My name is Thor,” he says. “Please forgive Loki, he worries.” His voice is accented, like English isn’t his first language.
‘As a Quick Tip: when a question is asked in ASL, the qualifiers WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and WHICH are placed at the end of the sentence or at both the beginning
One website reads: ‘ASL is not English. ASL is its own language and because of that a few things need to be acknowledged before your trip into learning Sign begins.
“Wait,” Steve says before he rolls his hips, flipping their positions so he can straddle Tony. He groans, sinking further into Tony’s cock.
Steve blinks down at his cuff. From one moment to the next, it’s like the rug’s been pulled out from under him and, while trying to catch his balance, someone’s pushed him down a set of stairs.
Tony doesn’t know how to take that. The only person who’s ever been his friend because they enjoy his company was Rhodey. Even Pepper and Happy had to be paid to be around him, at least at first.
Tony learns American Sign Language in a month. He hires an assistant that knows ASL. He builds an A.I. that reads his signs through a camera and then speaks them out loud. He proves to everyone in the fucking universe that even though he can’t speak he’s still a goddamn genius and he isn’t to be underestimated.
Tony stares, searching Steve’s eyes for a moment. Then, slowly, he pulls the ice pack away from his face.
“Baby,” Steve reaches for the dragon, laying a gentle hand on his back. The small dragon is burning up, almost unbearably hot. “Baby,” Steve breaths.
Hours later, when Steve wanders into the lab, Tony gives him a well-placed shove and signs, quick and angry, that he doesn’t appreciate anyone’s pity.
Steve raises his hands to gently cup Tony’s tear stained cheeks. He continues, “You are the bravest, smartest, most beautiful person I know. And I’m not just talking about in terms of looks. You inherited your father’s company and, with it, all of his sins. And then when you realized you didn’t like what you had spent your entire life creating, you set out to change it. And you succeed. Do you know how amazing that is?”
When he makes it into the kitchen Bucky’s already there cooking breakfast, his long hair pulled into a ponytail. The dragon is standing on his hind legs, his claws gripping onto the edge of a cabinet, neck stretched out and nose sniffing at the stove.
“Tony,” Steve gasps, pushing at his shoulders. “Tony,” he has to repeat before the other man raises up to give him a confused look.
Steve pulls the blanket off and stands slowly, weary of vertigo. When none comes, he snatches his cell phone off the table and follows Baby’s sad chirps into the kitchen.
Steve gasps through his own needy climax, hips twitching and grinding until, exhausted, he presses kisses along Tony’s cheek to bury his face in the other man’s neck.
The dragon chirps, scurrying off the bed and out Steve’s door. Steve hears another chirp before he even makes it from under the covers.
Steve can’t decide if Tony is asking why he finds the lab peaceful or why Steve doesn’t pity him. The thought that Tony is asking why Steve would want to be his friend doesn’t even cross his mind.
Tony like Steve does and it blows his mind. Would tell him that he’s never as great a man as he is when Steve’s at his side.
Steve nods, “I don’t have time to talk.” He tries to walk past her, adjusting his scarf but she keeps pace with him.
And now that the Avengers know that, they’re going to want someone else in the suit. They won’t feel comfortable fighting alongside him anymore. Tony is nothing but a benefactor. Ironman is the hero. And Ironman isn’t Tony Stark.
The first thing he’d say to Pepper would be to thank her for putting up with all his shit through the years. She deserves so much better than she’s gotten.
Yet Steve—as he presses reverent kisses against Tony’s soulmark, pretending that the words there are
Tony forms the signs at maybe half the speed he usually does, the forms careful and obviously intentional. JARVIS doesn’t bother to translate.
—and then moves to the farthest corner of his lab and tinkers around with nothing and studiously ignores Steve.
He stands before anyone can say otherwise. Grabbing his notebook—head held high and not a single breath taken—Steve marches from the room.
it’s been Tony in the suit. The only other person he’d trust with it is Rhodey because he’s known Rhodey since he was seventeen. Tony wouldn’t ever just
When Steve pulls away, slowly, Tony’s frozen, unsure if that really just happened or if he imagined it.
“Hey, Baby,” he greets as the dragon runs down the hallway to him, chirping the entire distance. He scoops the dragon up and walks into the kitchen where he can hear Bucky and someone else talking.
The dragon wiggles his head out from under the orange fabric and watches as Steve plugs the drier in. It chirps.
Three weeks later and it’s raining again. Steve’s at the Starbucks by his campus and he’s staring out the window at the big, fat rain drops.
Hesitant to break the silence, Steve reaches out and gently touches Tony’s shoulder. Before losing his nerve, Steve signs, DINNER.
Tony grabs onto Steve’s shirt. He threads his hands through Steve’s hair and digs his fingers into Steve’s skin. Tony can’t help it as his hands clench on Steve’s hips and Steve trails kisses down his neck, the blonde’s teeth nipping at Tony’s exit scar.
Steve can feel a dampness against his neck where Tony’s hiding his face. He waits, let’s Tony have a few minutes as Steve holds on.
It’s pouring down rain. Not a simple little drizzle or a sprinkle, but a deluge: heavy, fat drops that soak into your bones instead of just your clothes.
Tony has the bots get his suit off and heads straight for the first aid kit he keeps under the sink in the attached bathroom. Tony picks the larger pieces of glass and metal out of his face, rinses the blood off, and then scrubs the smaller debris out with a soft bristled brush. He rubs an antibacterial into his cuts and butterflies the bigger ones closed. The smaller ones will be fine, he thinks. The bruising can’t be helped. The ruptured blood vessel in his eye will have to have a cold compress.
“Better?” He asks, running the cloth over the dragon’s wet scales. He’s careful with the spines on the dragon’s back and dabs at the fragile membrane of the wings. He drapes the towel over the dragon.
, Steve thinks, utterly shattered. He grabs at Tony, pulling him in and kissing him like he’s starving for it.
Tony’s mouth twists like he’s annoyed at being pulled from his work, but he gives a grinding sigh and nods, allowing himself to be dragged from the lab.
Steve rolls his hips helplessly, grinding until he gets Tony’s cock where he needs it most. He takes a moment to relish Tony’s gasp and then stops, waiting for Tony to look at him again. The genius purses his lips together, obviously dissatisfied with the loss of movement. He drags his hands up Steve’s sides, hips to shoulders and back down again, encouragingly.
Tony can’t help the desperate, grinding moans that slip out as Steve slips his own hands up Tony’s shirt, over his back, dragging them closer. He can’t stop his hips from rutting against Steve’s. Can’t find the willpower to pull his hands out of Steve’s pants.
“You’re like a furnace,” Steve murmurs as he zips his coat and stands. “Let me grab my portfolio and we’ll head home, okay?”
Tony jumps, something dropping to the floor. He bends to pick it up and, as he straightens, slams a hand down onto his workbench as he sways on his feet.
No one—except Rhodey and Tony’s ex Rumiko—enjoys spending time with him down in the lab. Pepper hates the disarray. Happy gets mother henned by the bots. All of Tony’s exes eventually got bored of waiting for him to give them the time of day while he was drafting or creating things. One ex even told Tony that he hummed and it was ‘the worst, absolute most god awful sound’ they’d ever heard, ‘like a saw blade and a bag of broken glass got in a fight and the result is your vocal cords.’
Steve doesn’t realize he’s crying until he can’t see the room he’s standing in. “I,” he chokes out, “I didn’t ask—ask for that. Why—why would—? He might die and—”
Tony tries not to think about how he’ll never hear his own voice again. Tries not to think about the little grunts and hums that are all that’s left for him now. Tony doesn’t focus on the vertical, two inch long, white scar just to the right of his Adam’s apple. Or the matching scar just under his left ear.
This is it. This is when that gently crafted dream where Steve will love him forever falls apart. Tony can see it in the shocked curve of Steve’s lips, in the aborted half step Steve takes toward him.
Bucky stands before Steve can and nods. “Yeah, one sec.” He grabs one of Steve’s pairs of sweatpants out of his chest of drawers and hands the bundle of fabric to the man.
his stomach. He looks down and, by the light of the street lamps coming through the window, he sees Baby, twitching and whimpering in his sleep.
Bucky’s out of the bed and across the room before he even thinks about it. He pulls Steve into a hug. “It’s okay, alright? Let’s go check on, Baby.” Bucky keeps an arm around Steve’s shoulders as they make their way back to Steve’ room.
The chirp Steve gets for that is definitely not a happy chirp. Steve laughs and pulls at his shirt and toes off his shoes.
When Steve and Baby return to the kitchen, Sam and Bucky are still talking about the incident that gave Bucky his Purple Heart.
“We’ll be there in twenty minutes.” And then, to someone else, “Thor, grab your coat, we’re making a house call.”
Steve’s heart stutters to a stop in his chest. Then, it suddenly picks up at triple time, tripping over itself in an effort to beat right out of his chest.
So Tony rips the remainder of the faceplate off, throws it to the ground, and speeds off back into the fight.
Steve doesn’t answer, staring at the far wall and twisting his pencil ‘round and ‘round in his hands, his jaw ticking.
Steve takes a few deep breaths and rests his head against the back of the seat as the car starts to pull into the drive at the mansion. He mutters a quick, “Excuse me,” to the rest of the team and disappears to Tony’s lab before anyone can stop him.
Steve nods. He hesitates but after a moment he runs his hand through the man’s hair. “Are you okay?”
Steve blushes. For some reason, the thought that eventually Tony would ask about his use of ASL never crossed his mind. What an oversight.
Tony figures the one redeeming quality about his whole ‘silently in love with Steve Rogers’ thing is the fact that—ironies aside—no one knows he’s Ironman.
“Bucky, you home?” Steve asks as he slips through the door. He sets his portfolio down gently and, keeping a hand on the dragon’s back, moves into the main room. “Bucks?”
Some weeks later, Steve is making breakfast in the communal kitchen. He’s got a skillet full of eggs, another full of hash browns and bacon. He’s hoping Tony will still be sleeping by the time he’s finished. Depending on how you mark it, it’s his and Tony’s one-year anniversary.
It’s a dragon. A tiny, cat-sized, red and gold dragon with big blue eyes and tiny little spikes going down its back all the way to four finger length spikes on its tail. It’s soaked and its scales look dull dirty and, all in all, it looks pitiful.
Steve must have come to the lab straight from the debrief—or skipped it altogether—since he’s still in full uniform.
Steve wonders if Tony doesn’t have many friends by design or by choice. He’d like to be considered among that small number.
Baby, as it turns out, is curled up under all six of Steve’s blankets and the heated pad (which is set on ‘high’) that Steve uses when the cold makes his joints hurt.
, he’s beyond grateful that Pepper is at the mansion so often. She’s a surprisingly kind and patient teacher when it comes to anyone who isn’t trying her patience, such as Tony.
“Yeah, I’m sorry, Sam,” Bucky says into his phone as he paces by the couch that Steve’s collapsed onto.
Steve grabs his water bottle, stalling for time as he scrambles for any reason other than, ‘I think I’m in love with your boss.’ For some reason, he doesn’t think that would go down too well.
And to Steve… To Steve, the first thing he’d tell him is that he loves him. That he’s been in love it him for years and sometimes it over whelms him, makes him feel like his chest is about to burst and all he can do is giggle his little broken giggle. Tell Steve that he wants to watch that slow, happy smile he gets curl over his face every chance he can. That he, Tony, wants to be the cause of it, always. He’d tell Steve how confused he gets sometimes because no one’s ever just
Steve feels gutted, like a sharp knife’s cut in and spayed all his very well-kept secrets all across the floor. A cold, tight band snaps across his chest, pulling tighter with every heartbeat. He surveys the room: exits, furniture, number of people, their strengths and weaknesses. It won’t be the first time he’s had to fight his way out of a room because his affections don’t tend towards the fairer sex. At least this time he’ll have the muscles to survive it unassisted.
The dragon, bringing the towel, traipses across the counter. Steve angles the drier onto the dragon’s chest. It trills excitedly, tiny claws grabbing the barrel and directing it under a wing.
because we hold onto that sort of thing. But anyway, you were warm and sweet and… uhm,” Tony blushes and clears his throat.
He holds up a thumb, his index finger, and his pinky. Then he signs through a closed fist with his thumb bent against his knuckles in the front. Then a fist with his thumb under his index finger. His fingertips resting against his thumb. His index and middle fingers held aloft, like a peace sign. Then his fingertips resting against his thumb again.
Why didn’t Tony tell him he was Ironman? Were there not ample opportunities? Shouldn’t he, as the leader, know about relevant medical conditions such as shrapnel in a teammate’s chest and implanted pacemakers?
Sometimes he’ll find a page or two of Stark’s hands: a pinky stuck out as his wrist moves in a swooping motion, his usual signal for when he wants JARVIS’s attention; Stark brushing his spayed fingertips against his chest with an upward motion, his face looking like he’d rather be doing anything else than whatever Pepper had been badgering him into at the time; Stark’s fingers tapping at his own surprisingly defined shoulder, a sign that Steve’s come to learn means ‘captain’ (a sign which Stark tends to follow up by moving his hand in a circular motion around his face with his index and middle fingers held out like they’re taped together. Steve has yet to figure out what that one means but Clint seems to tip his head back and laugh everytime he sees Stark use it).
“Thanks,” Steve says, taking them from the little dragon. “You should probably give Bucky his things back, Baby.”
Tony’s hand whips out, catching Steve’s wrist before he can do more than start to roll the edge of the fabric cuff.
The second is that Tony looks so much better than he did when he was being loaded into that ambulance. His skin isn’t flushed or sweaty and he’s not gasping for breath or delusional with fever.
Steve pulls his sopping hat off and drops it in the sink while his other hand unzips his coat. He reaches for the small dragon but the creature holds onto Steve shirt, not wanting to move.
“Uuuh,” Clint says, “I think… there’s a small chance I may have accidentally hit him with one of my exploding arrows about five, seven minutes ago. It ricocheted off of one on these bastard’s chest plates.”
Before he can overthink it, Steve grabs a wheeled stool and drags it over. “Does everyone have a nickname?”
There are two very tall men in his doorway, one just slightly shorter than the other. The brunet, the shorter one, breezes past Steve without a word and he heads straight for the source of the whimpering. The taller, blond one gives Steve a wide smile and steps inside.
Steve watches as Tony explains about his life before the attempted assassination in Afghanistan, about his time with Yensen, about his suit, about Obie’s betrayal, about his abusive drunkard of a father. Steve watches until he can’t possibly stand to see Tony in so much pain anymore.
“Thanks, I guess. Being comforted by a dragon, won’t Bucky be impressed?” Steve mutters as he finishes shucking the last of his clothes. He tosses all of his wet things into the tub and grabs another towel to wrap around his naked waist.
Steve closes his eyes tight, buries his face against Tony’s neck and sucks in a wet breath. He has to force the air around where his heart is suddenly lodged in his throat. He can’t speak. Tony’s already halfway there and Steve’s never been so desperate for someone to say they love him as much as he is right now. Doesn’t even chance taking in another breath in case it breaks whatever spell is allowing Tony to speak his Words right now.
Tony nods, a hand coming up to rub at his neck, at the scar that sits just under his left ear. He takes a deep breath and then starts signing again.
Steve glances at Tony to see the man’s shocked face. Then, Tony’s face scrunches, as if he’s sucking on a sour candy. He crosses his arms, leans towards the table, then leans back again before uncrossing his arms to sign.
Besides, it’s not as if Steve isn’t also drawing the other people he’s met in this new future either: he’s got a few pages of Natasha’s curls; the intricate lines of Ironman’s mask; Hawkeye’s arms as he practices his shooting; Dr. Banner hunched over a work station; Wasp’s board and carefree smile; Pepper’s stern frown and Happy’s beefy back; Agent Coulson’s receding hairline; the intricate carving of mjolnir. But, by and large, most pages of his new sketchbooks seem to be taken up by warm brown eyes and a playful, knowing smirk.
Arms crossed, Steve leans back into the workbench, trying to make himself small, as if that will take away some of the vulnerable weight of his last few questions.
“Nope, just in time,” Steve smiles and wraps an arm around Tony’s waist, pressing a kiss to his temple.
“It’s decided. Not taking a ‘no’ for an answer. I’ve already got Pepper on it.” Tony picks up his tablet again.
Tony touches his fingers to his forehead and then pulls them away, ending with his pinky and thumb extended.
Steve stares at Tony’s broad back, watches as Tony inhales in quiet fits and starts. Steve realizes he may have pushed too hard, too fast. Eventually, he’ll get Tony to accept the fact that he is loved. He’s got years ahead of himself to do it.
Steve raises an eyebrow at the dragon as he slides his glasses in a pocket for later. “What else you got down there?” He asks as he moves to his knees to look under the bed.
Steve shrugs again and, tight lipped, says, “Don’t really want to talk about it right now. Do you mind if I just sit in a corner? I promise not to get underfoot.”
Tony raises his head and gives Natasha a smug smile. He taps his shoulder with his fingertips, circles his face with his index and middle fingers sticking out, then points at Steve.
“And it’s not like it’s the first time I’ve been sick, either.” As if to accent this point, Steve coughs again.
Tony googles ‘speech therapy’, memorizes a few phone numbers, and then deletes the results from his browser history.
“Yes,” Steve hisses as Tony’s thrusts take on an urgent edge. Begging, he says, “Please. I want to hear you come.”
“Whoa, there. Let me—” Steve unzips his coat not even halfway down before the little dragon slithers its way inside. Steve can feel its fingers curling into his shirt, making the dragon’s wings fan out over his chest, the claws on the dragon’s hind legs clutch onto his belt, and its tail curls over his left hip.
Steve can’t imagine that any unknown soulmate could ever make him feel as lightheaded and giddy as Tony does. Can’t imagine filling sketchbook after sketchbook full of intimate moments—a head tipped back in bliss, a face scrunched in passion, a hand wrapped around a hard and leaning cock—of anyone
Tony looks terrible: there’s dried blood on his neck and shirt; his face is a mess of cuts and bruises; one of his eyes is bright red where it’s supposed to be white; the bigger cuts have already been cleaned and butterflied shut. Tony presses whatever he dropped to his face; an ice pack wrapped in a grease stained towel. He doesn’t lift his eyes from Steve’s red uniform boots.
But Tony pouts and Pepper eventually admits that, yes, she has critiqued Steve on his signs once or twice and has shown him the signs for a few words he was wondering about.
“Sorry,” Steve says as lets go of Tony’s face as if he’s been burned. “I forgot—uh, I forgot about your face.”
It’s possibly the fifth time they’ve had sex that Steve realizes Tony is consciously muffling himself.
It hurts, a little, that Tony doesn’t feel comfortable asking Steve directly, if that is indeed the case, but Steve pushes all thoughts of Tony’s motivation to the back of his mind. He has to address something else first.
Steve blows his friend a raspberry and then picks up Baby and moves to the couch with him. He lies down and Baby curls up on his chest.
Tony blinks at him owlishly, fingers tightening against his sides. His lips twist and he looks away to stare at the far wall. Frowning. Jaw tight.
Somehow—some-fucking-how—Tony survives Afghanistan. The thought that stays with him through the entire time is ‘I survived the car crash that killed my parents. I survive being mute in a talking world. I
Tony clears his throat as best he can, tries to make sure that the words he wants to say will come out clear and comprehensible. After all, that’s what his voice therapist, Veda, has been trying to teach him for the last few months.
Steve isn’t a Blank. His soulmate is still out there somewhere. Tony’s Words aren’t his, even though he said them.
It’s a short ride to the hospital. Steve stares out the window and hopes it won’t be awkward when he sees Tony Stark again. The last time he saw Tony was when he was being loaded into the back of an ambulance and trying to tell one of the paramedics that he loved Steve and that Steve was a good guy. Like a hero, not the kind that wear trilbies. Really, guys, he’s the best.
So Tony concentrates and forces out a small, gravely, “Steve,” and he can feel Steve stiffen in his arms but he has to press on, has to get the rest out before Steve interrupts him.
Steve’s busy putting the bucket of supplies back together so doesn’t notice until the little dragon runs the towel into his ankle.
Steve continues, “Besides, I think I mostly liked how fierce Peggy was. She wasn’t afraid to speak what was on her mind and she certainly wasn’t afraid to punch someone who gave her shit. She probably would have made an amazing Captain America, too, if Project Rebirth wasn’t run by a bunch of old white men in the nineteen-forties.”
“That’s not true at all!” Steve moves quickly, sitting on the edge of the bed. He runs a hand over Baby’s too hot skin. “I just want him to get better. He’s my friend, not my pet.”
Too often though, he’ll find pages and pages of Stark’s face, neck, shoulders, arms. Stark’s everything, drawn from memory and immortalized in charcoal, ink, graphite in the pages of Steve’s notebooks.
“Thankfully, no. We had a great turn out though. We’re cleaning up the kitchens and the rec rooms now and then we’re taking the left overs to the homeless shelter. So hopefully we’ll be done around five or six? And then we can all crash Gabe’s Christmas dinner.”
“You’ll be okay,” Bucky murmurs, moving his hand to press his cool palm to the dragon’s stomach. There’s a delicate knit-membrane, under the outer micro-thin layer of adamantium, in Bucky’s prosthetic that registers temperature and pressure, and it’s currently sending a signal to Bucky telling him the dragon’s skin temperature is around one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit. The internal temperature is probably closer to one-thirty-five and that is definitely worrying.
Why the hell did he ever think he could be more than lowly, sissy, little Tony Stark? Just a weak, fleshy thing in a suit of armor.
Loki’s lips quirk, “I am dragon-kind, too. A world serpent. And Baby has told me as much.” He runs a finger under the tiny dragon’s chin and Baby tips his head tiredly into the touch. “He refuses to turn back into his human form, though. He isn’t sure he
Steve cuts him off, “I need—” but he doesn’t finish, finally managing to pull his jacket off. He stands, in his tee-shirt, and begins to pull at the edge of his cuff. He’s never purposefully shown it to anyone before.
“I’m not here to question you, Mister Rogers.” She brushes a strand of hair behind an ear. “My name is Pepper Potts. I’m Tony Stark’s personal assistant.”
“It’s only staying the night!” Bucky hollers down the hallway but Steve knows that if the dragon stays the night it’ll stay the week and then it’ll stay for longer.
“No, no, no, no. Come here. I promise everything will be okay. Come’er,” Steve wiggles his fingers at the little dragon, arm straining towards the little guy.
The doctors tell Tony that he may never recover the use of his voice. They tell him the shard of glass that went through his neck barely missed his jugular veins and carotid arteries. They tell him that the irreparable damage to his vocal cords is the best possible outcome. They tell him he’s lucky to be alive.
“Shut up, it is not...” But Steve readjusts the heavy leather folder anyway. Even with it tucked into his arm pit the portfolio reaches all the way to his hip. If only the handles hadn’t broken. He fixes his cap again and then his scarf and jacket and then checks to make sure his cuffs are over his shoes so he doesn’t get water on his socks.
From the head of the conference table, Fury says, “Now that you’ve met, let’s get this thing started.”
Baby chirps and nuzzles his head into Steve’s thigh before rolling onto his back and exposing his soft underbelly.
Later that night, when Steve and Bucky return, they’re too busy laughing about Monty and Gabe’s houseplant to notice there weren’t any welcoming chirps.
Steve aches to fill the silence. “I always thought—,” but then Tony’s grabbing him and kissing him, fierce and needy all in one.
where ‘Time’ is the tense of the sentence (such as past, future, or present tense), ‘Topic’ is the subject of the sentence, ‘Comment’ is what is being said about the subject, and ‘Referent’ refers to the subject about which you are talking.
The dragon takes pity on him soon enough though and looks around. It hops off the counter and lands on the floor in a graceless, towel-tangled heap.
To the Avengers, he’d just thank them for having his back and being there for him, for Ironman. For being his first real friends.
So there’s absolutely no reason for Steve to visit Tony’s lab besides maybe saying hello and asking for armor upgrades and then leaving. Nothing about Tony—or his lab—should make Steve want to stay and hang out.
So when Tony meets Captain America in a glass-walled S.H.I.E.L.D. conference room and Steve Rogers himself says, “Mr. Stark. They tell me you’re mute,” Tony doesn’t flinch. He just signs, ‘Nice to meet you, Captain R.O.G.E.R.S.’ and waits for his A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., to translate it.
Steve sucks in a wet breath against Tony’s neck. Tony wishes he thought to ask to learn more than just those four words. Wishes he’d asked to learn them all so he could tell Steve how important he is. But he’d told Veda that those four words were enough. So he says them again.
Steve punctuates his promise with a harsh roll of his hips. His own quiet gasp is lost in Tony’s choked groan.
“Not a chance!” Wasp shouts, buzzing in a frustrated little circle overhead. “I’m protecting the city, not doing your dirty work!” Steve looks at Iron Man, puzzled. Iron Man stares back impassively, then taps at the side of his helmet. Steve thumps the side of his own head, resettling the comm in his ear.
In the forward windows, orange streaks of flame and wisps of ice-white started to give way to the deep black of space. “We’re clearing the atmospheric envelope now, actually.” There was a very slight whine as his shock absorbers eased off to match the reduction in pressure.
He’s trying to conserve power. The reactor is the best battery they’re likely to get, and the only thing that stands even a remote chance of jump-starting the ship’s engine. So he’s got all the suit’s atmospheric controls turned off, which was tolerable at first, but has since become pretty intolerable. The heat is getting to be a problem.
He tuned out of the sounds of the battle, whatever the fuck Cap was doing out there in the rest of the hangar, ages ago: more important things to think about and all that. Tuning back in he realized that the frantic hoof-clicks and the crashing noises and the stutter of rapid-fire weaponry, cut through by the very particular ring of vibranium as it ricocheted off hard surfaces, all indicated a very active fight, although not one that Cap seemed to be losing. He listened for a moment as the fight shifted fractionally closer. Sounded kind of like a stalemate, actually.
“Sorry to corner you, but I wanted to check in. You took some hits earlier today. And you looked like you were moving kind of stiff all night.” Tony slouches against the door a little more. “You have that bad habit of walking off an injury without telling anyone about it.”
, but he can’t quite tell what. Without really thinking about it, he leans in to smell it better. He puts a hand out to steady himself, then freezes. Tony is still lightly holding the lapels of Steve’s jacket; now Steve has a hand on Tony’s waist, and his nose is perilously close to Tony’s right temple.
,” Wasp says, landing just beyond Steve and sizing back up as soon as her boots touch the ground. She runs her hands down the sides of her suit in dismay.
“Iron Man,” Cap said, his tone strained. He stood with his back to Tony, holding the shield out to face the hallway. The hallway that was going to be full of Vog’ila way too soon.
Jarvis greets them in the foyer for the second time that day, this time with warm mugs of tea instead of cleaning supplies. Jan and Hank immediately leave with theirs, Hank hurrying back towards solitude, Jan muttering about salve for her centipede acid spot-burns. Thor takes his mug into the living room, where a crackle of controlled lightning announces that he’s lit a fire in the fireplace. Steve thanks Jarvis and moves to follow Thor, looking forward to putting his feet up—it’s been a long day, even for him—but Tony stops him with a hand on Steve’s waist. There are too many layers of fabric there for it to be even remotely inappropriate, but Steve still has to suppress a too-obvious shiver.
,” Tony says, putting a theatrical leer into it. It works. Cap sits up a little straighter and smiles in a way that indicates he’s tracking a bit more closely than he was before. Tony unwinds the flexistraw and wordlessly holds out the pouch again.
“S’good enough for me,” Steve says. “Are you going to—I mean, do I have to go down to the drugstore or something—”
With the sun completely filling the windows edge to edge, he doesn’t have a great frame of reference for their speed, but the dizzying heat makes it feel like they’re falling down the gravity well faster now. He needs to get this done.
“Slow,” Tony says. “I want you more alert than this by the time I’m ready to put some serious vogsecs between us and this burning fucking gas-ball.”
“Here,” Cap says, coming up behind him and holding out the helmet. Tony closes his eyes and leans back from the waist. Cap huffs out a small laugh and cradles the back of Tony’s head, smoothing the hair there down as he eases the helmet on over it. “Need any more help armoring up, Your Highness?”
Cap sighs. “This wasn’t your mission. You’re not an Avenger, you didn’t have to be here. That’s my fault.”
Steve shivers at that. Tony’s smile turns satisfied. He skims his hands down the back of Steve’s head and rests them on the tops of his shoulders, then squeezes, digging his thumbs into the muscles above Steve’s collarbones. Steve can feel his back arching slightly into the pressure, pushing him into Tony’s grip. A delighted, calculating expression comes over Tony’s face, one Steve has seen most often when Tony is in the workshop: he’s taking in the results of a successful experiment, parsing them for usable data.
“You did just fine with the weapons back there,” Cap said. His eyes were trained on the door all the way back at the other end of the hangar.
to hear Cap say things like “you’re not an Avenger” in that calm, matter-of-fact voice he uses to state Great Truths.
The ship shudders slightly. There are no air currents in space, so he’s just going to work real hard at not thinking about whatever that could have been. If his sketchy weld job is failing… or if they’re close enough to experience solar wind as a physical force, or if they’re anywhere near a coronal mass ejection event, he’s not sure they’re going to be able to fly out even if he does get the engine working. And wow, he
Tony looks genuinely startled. Whatever he thought Steve might say, it clearly wasn’t that. “What on earth are you apologizing for? You did
something happens that you’re not 110% into,” Tony says, and wraps a hand around the base of Steve’s cock.
Finally he gets a hit on a wire that’s live on the right system. He plugs it into the gauntlet, turns to the console, and sees the powered flight system—or at least the system that was definitely active back when the ship was moving in a controlled way-- flicker. It dies back down immediately, but that’s fine, totally to be expected, it’s not like he thinks any of the ship’s main systems are going to run off an ancillary gauntlet power supply. He’s just trying to see which cables feed into the systems he wants to activate.
“Scoot up,” Tony breathes into his ear. Steve wriggles awkwardly up the bed until his feet are fully off the floor and his head is up by the pillows. Tony pets his flanks soothingly, nudges Steve’s knees apart so he can settle between them. Steve groans and squeezes his eyes shut. He jumps a little at a damp touch on his stomach, relaxes when he receives the same treatment slightly higher up, and is squirming by the time Tony has finished kissing his way up to Steve’s face.
“Two hours until we have to leave for the gala,” Wasp reminds them as they clatter into the Mansion’s foyer. Jarvis stands nearby with a mop and bucket and an extremely disapproving expression directed at the spots where Thor is dripping acid onto the hardwood flooring. “Stragglers
Steve shrugs one shoulder, not bothering to look up. He’s still feeling good, but he can sense embarrassment somewhere off in the distance, just waiting to ambush him. And is Tony really going to call things off? Now? Just because Steve doesn’t have any rubbers on him? “What’s it matter?”
They ran down to the far end of the hangar, trying to put as much space and as many obstacles between themselves and the door as possible, skidding to a stop in front of a ship in the last row. Tony hit it with every scan he had.
Tony is not in the bed, but Steve can hear him banging around in the bathroom again. He shifts, grimacing at the slickness between his legs. Maybe Tony’s looking for a washcloth. After a moment’s thought, he risks raising his voice. “Second cabinet from the left!” His voice is hoarse, like he’s been yelling for hours. He doesn’t remember yelling. The Mansion’s soundproofing is good, but it’s an old building… hopefully he wasn’t yelling.
The whole tuxedo is aggressively modern in cut, slim to the point where it makes Tony look less muscular than he is, more like a—well, Steve would call him a dandy or a rake, which was old-fashioned even in his time, and he’s not sure what the word for it now would be. It certainly hides the fact that Tony spends most of his days shaping big chunks of metal or punching villains in the face; the way the suit hugs his body transforms him into a man of wit and grace instead of someone who relies on brute force. “But I couldn’t pull something like that off in a million years,” Steve admits.
It’s a slow emergence from the fog, and he’s in no great rush to get clear of it. But eventually the real world does begin to intrude again. The pillow under his face is wet—he’s drooled all over it—and he is lying in what feels like an enormous cold wet spot on the sheets. He scoots to the side, then carefully lies down on his back where the bed is still mostly dry. There’s a pleasant soreness in his hip flexors, like he’s done a satisfying workout targeting a long-neglected group of muscles.
They all troop up the stairs, and the others peel off towards their own rooms. Iron Man pauses outside Steve’s door. “You all set? You went to my guy, right?”
There’s another long beat of silence. “You need to be more careful than that,” Tony says. “That’s the kind of thing that could get you hurt nowadays.”
“This is fucking crazy, you realize that, right? This is actual alien technology. I don’t know what half the materials are, I don’t know what they’re using for a fuel source—oh, wait, I think it’s a plasma-based engine—”
He resists the urge to check the connections one last time. By now they’re either fine or they aren’t, but either way there’s nothing more he can do. He peels himself up off the floor, grimaces as his legs twinge painfully, staggering a little under the weight of the chestplate as a result. There’s definitely a wet spot on the floor where he sweat through the undersuit. This is not his finest hour, aesthetically speaking.
see why it was a specialty piece. You look like you’re about to walk into a ball with Carnegie or Rockefeller and set all the society dames to swooning—all it’s missing is the top hat.”
“If I hadn’t been here, you wouldn’t have even made it through the mission, let alone off the planet, so don’t start.” He doesn’t have to look back over his shoulder to know that Cap is pressing his lips together disapprovingly. His conversational pause has a familiar non-sound to it. “No, really, how were you gonna play this? You know how to disable an alien weapons array now? You learned how to hot-wire totally unfamiliar vehicular technologies sometime in the past couple months?”
Of course, it wasn’t like he was only, or even primarily, a programmer. The Vog’ila engineering logic was unfamiliar too, and their materials science was foreign to him, but at the end of the day they were subject to the same constraints of physics that Earth was, and there were only so many ways to make a thing move, not move, or go really fast that didn’t violate the physical constants of the universe.
Tony reached out again with Extremis, but no, he still wasn’t getting enough of a toehold in the system to make any useful sense of it. “Maybe. No way to know for sure or to activate it, though.”
And that’s, just. Well. Time may be running out and the situation is dire and so on, but there is no universe or scenario where Tony is able to ignore that, and he would defy any warm-blooded Earth mammal to do otherwise. He turns away from the panel to obviously, ostentatiously eyeball Cap.
Tony hooks his chin over a shoulder to glare at him. Cap has a disconcertingly good poker face, for all that he’s supposed to embody truth and openness and all that idealistic crap, and it’s sometimes hard to tell how much awareness he has when he’s being the world’s biggest little shit. Cap just looks back at him evenly, eye kind of squinted on the side closer to the ship’s forward window. Tony turns back to the mess of cabling with a huff.
“I was going to warm you up with my mouth, but I think you’re plenty warm already, aren’t you?” Tony teases, directly into Steve’s ear. Steve grabs at whatever part of Tony’s body he can reach and arches up against him, almost mindlessly desperate for friction, pressure, anything. Tony indulges him briefly, then eels out from beneath Steve’s hands. “Turn over,” he says, dropping into a slightly lower register. Steve, obeying, is just barely aware enough to feel pleased by the roughness in Tony’s voice.
“You idiot workaholic,” Tony says. “And don’t even, pot, kettle, etc, I know.” He drops Steve’s hands and slides both of his own into Steve’s hair, tilts Steve’s face up so that Steve has no choice but to look at him. “Steven Grant Rogers, you are, in my
“If you distract me from figuring out this ship’s drive and we plunge into the sun as a result, that can be your fault,” Tony grits out from between clenched teeth, which he thinks is a very magnanimous concession under the circumstances.
“No, no, the tailoring is fine. You leave those people alone, they had to make the whole thing practically from scratch on short notice.” Steve should be batting Tony’s hands away from where they’ve come to a stop, lightly holding Steve’s lapels about halfway up, but he can’t seem to make his own limbs cooperate. “It’s just. It still feels a little funny to wear one, you know? The uniform, I’m used to that. And modern civilian clothing is like having pajamas on. But a proper suit… it just wears different.”
He carries the chestplate to the bow and sets it down on one of the seat-things near the control panels. Conditions there are so bright that he can’t even raise his head to look directly out the window, and the control panels are functionally useless, the lights and colors on their surfaces bleached to nothing by the overpowering blaze of light.
“Oh, you’re doing it right. It’s just that your version of ‘right’ apparently crystallized in, what, the 1920s? The ‘30s?” Tony sidles a little closer and pinches the edge of one of Steve’s jacket tails between his thumb and forefinger, rubbing the fabric thoughtfully. “Tails are a white tie thing, these days. And those loose-cut pants…”
The fact that he’d been able to disable the weapons array that was the whole point of them being here was closer to sheer luck than Tony would ever want to admit, although of course it was
He popped up on the boot jets, hovering a couple feet off the ground so he’d have a better angle, and set to drilling the door open.
“Whatever you just did there. Feels a lot better with a little gravity. I don’t know that I’m quite cut out for NASA,” Cap admitted, doing that aw-shucks thing where he ducked his head and rubbed the back of his neck.
He pulls the entire bundle out of the wall, careful to not disconnect anything, and starts rapidly carving notches into the protective sheathing of each wire in the group. He’s making some assumptions about alien psychology here, but he is guessing that all the cables within a given bundle are responsible for things in the same system. If he’s right, and he can patch them all into the reactor, he should be able to power enough of the ship’s propulsion and basic steering/navigation to get them the hell away from this sun.
Tony keeps rubbing Steve’s back.  Steve times his breathing to the circles. He can almost feel his body trying to tighten back up, to push Tony out, but the more he focuses on his breathing, the easier it is to deliberately relax. After a while Tony pushes forward again, curling down until his forehead is pressed to Steve’s back and he’s flush with Steve’s ass. “God,” he groans. A warm feeling surges through the pit of Steve’s stomach. He’ll do just about
No, he realized with a dawning horror, as he finally managed to pull up something recognizable on the control panel: a visual tracker, some kind of live map. The notation was still impenetrable, but the little pictograms were clear enough. One of them plainly represented the ship. One arc showed the planet falling away behind them. One much larger curve showed the next closest celestial body. The panel used green squiggly lines to represent a complex of curving marks around that celestial body. Tony was no astrophysicist, but he recognized the magnetic field pattern of a star easily enough. And he could see that the little ship icon was fully overlapping it.
Tony turns to look at him. Just turning around takes more energy than he expected. Cap’s eyes are closed, his head leaned back against the bulkhead. His legs splay out across the floor with a laxness that Tony can’t really remember seeing before outside of a someone-got-hospitalized kinda scenario. Cap’s tidy pile of clothing has tipped over a little, but he doesn’t make any move to correct the situation, even though it’s right there by his side.
The first Vog’ila burst through the door, body held almost horizontal with its 6 legs splayed out momentarily as it brought itself up short. When it straightened, its head was a good 9 or 10 feet off the ground. Its light-sensing eyes, clustered around the top of its head, squinted in the relative brightness of the hangar; the four main eyes lower down rolled in different directions as it tried to locate them. Tony hunkered and let Cap cover them both with the shield; no sense in presenting a super obvious target until they absolutely had to. He hadn’t gotten a good enough look to tell if it was holding one the physical ammunition weapons or one of the energy guns, but he was hoping and assuming that Cap had and was planning accordingly.
The reactor casts a soft glow onto Steve’s skin as Tony steps closer, draping his arms more comfortably around Steve’s shoulders. He leans in for another kiss, then pulls back a little, blinking. He looks slightly baffled, but pleased.  “Do you know,” he says, “I think I’d like that too.”
“I’m all right,” Steve says. He tugs at the flaps of his jacket. “A bit bruised from the mission, but that’ll be gone by morning. If I looked stiff, it was probably just this get-up.”
what?” Cap asked, breathlessly. He was sort of draped over one of the chairs; it was too oddly-shaped for him to sit in it normally, but they didn’t exactly have proper flight seats, so he was doing his best to fit his body against it. The alternative was being smushed into a wall at the stern of the ship somewhere. Tony had his boots magnetized to the deck plating and his joints locked, relying on the suit’s internal padding for the rest.
brings a flush back into Steve’s face, but he ignores it as best he can and pushes himself up into a sitting position. He feels silly trying to have this conversation on his back.
Iron Man spins instantly in midair and fires a repulsor blast directly in front of Steve, just at the moment that Steve goes into a hip-slide, shield held up over his head. Iron Man’s blast hits the shield at the perfect angle and redirects into the centipede’s underside, scoring a deep mark in its carapace.
“Well, that’s something.” Cap shifted, sitting up a bit, then startled as his butt floated off the seat. He hastily adjusted to hook his ankles together under the chair. “This boat have artificial gravity?”
“Oh, almost forgot.” Steve says to himself. He walks back over and bends low. Baby rears up, claws clutching Steve’s scarf, and rubs his face against Steve’s jaw.
Steve laughs. “I’m glad! I do have to ask though—not that I expect an answer—but are you a boy dragon or a girl dragon?”
He rants about Tony putting himself in danger, about being a leader who all apparently doesn’t actually know his team as well as he thought he did, about how not a single member on the team knew who Ironman was and did Tony understand how dangerous that is?
“Do they still suspect kidnapping?” Bucky asks. He sets a plate full of food on the coffee table as he passes, heading for the armchair.
Steve says Tony’s name and when Tony looks up at him Steve points at Tony’s face and then brings his index fingers together in a twisting motion.
Steve barely has time to smile before Tony’s kissing him again. Reality slams into Steve all over again: he’s Tony’s soulmate; Tony is
talk. But the suit does have a very hi-tech lip reading software calibrated to Tony’s musculature and lip patterns. And the vocal sounds are based one hundred percent off of every single sound bite of ‘Tony Stark from before the accident’ that Tony could find. So the suit talks
Their first kiss is shared over the open spinal circuitry of an Ironman suit. Steve had been watching Tony’s lips form soundless words for the better part of an hour, pouring over some problem he’d encountered. Steve had been trying to focus on a sketch of a cathedral’s stained glass he remembered from the war. But every low hum or coarse grunt drew his eyes further and further away from the pages of his book and closer and closer to Tony’s workbench until he suddenly found himself standing across from the other man and leaning in. It was like fireworks.
But the cuff he constantly wears is a fitting reminder that somewhere in the universe exists a being who will eventually speak to him for the first time and utterly ruin the happiness he finds every moment he presses his lips against Tony’s.
Steve clears his throat. Not meeting anyone’s eyes, he says, “I’m gonna go hit the gym. If anyone wants to join me… feel free.”
Janet shakes her head and moves to press a gauze to his face again. She calls for one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. medics. She tells them it’s Ironman and he’s hurt.
Steve almost reaches out to cup Tony’s face, but thinks better of it in the last minute. He gestures at Tony’s face and, not trusting his voice not to break in half, signs a simple, INJURY.
‘First, let's go over what’s called “ASL gloss.” Since ASL isn't a written language and isn’t English, any written signs are denoted in all capital letters such as TODAY, STORE, or BOAT. These capitalized words are ASL gloss.
Baby chirps and hops off his hoard. He runs up to Steve and butts his head into the man’s shin. Baby chirps again.
“Hey, Baby,” Steve coos as he reaches a hand out and rubs at Baby’s cheek. “Have you seen my glasses? I need them for work today.”
Steve rolls his cuff down and over his hand. After shoving it in his pocket, he grabs Tony’s hand and places it gently against his Words. With his free hand, he strokes across Tony’s side, where he knows Tony’s Words are.
“And you promised everything would be okay and that you wouldn’t hurt me, which, by the way, you should never promise a dragon
“Awesome.” Steve’s shoulders relax, “Bucky’s not home. He doesn’t like it when I bring home strays. Let’s head to the bathroom and get dried off, yeah?”
“Give me a second, I have an idea!” Steve goes back to the cabinet and rummages around for one of Bucky’s hair drier. “It’s loud but it’ll feel awesome, okay?”
“I wondered how long you would stand there and grumble at each other,” Sam smiles. “Can I get you anything?”
Bucky walks into the hallway and shrugs. “I dunno. I needed my crescent set yesterday and I sorta gave up and asked Baby and he disappeared for a bit and then come over with it in his mouth.” Bucky reaches up and plays with the chain of his dog tags.
Steve’s three blocks from home (and nearly blown over by the wind twice) when he hears what sounds like a whimper from an alleyway. He stops and turns to face the backstreet slowly.
“And then I heard Obie—Stane was finally being fingered for my disappearance. Which was awesome but I…” Tony blushes again, not looking at Steve.
He hears it all the time. And no one will be able to tell him if they’re his. Because he’ll never give them a response to have marked on their skin.
Tony shakes his head, looking adorably confused. He shifts his weight, trying to adjust so his knees can support him in order to free his hands from where they’re currently tangled in the bed sheets.
Even if he understands what he assumes is Tony’s reasoning, he still needs to assuage his remaining fears, answer his last few questions. But as he makes his way closer to the lab, he finds himself growing more and more furious.
Baby gives a weak chirp and, with a shudder, there’s suddenly a very naked man on Steve’s bed instead of a small dragon. The man has his face buried between the mattress and Steve’s thigh. His skin is flushed red and his chocolate hair is matted with sweat.
“Alright, later then. Let’s go. Washer’s in the hallway.” Steve scoops up the towels, clothes, and the dragon, and makes his way to the hall closet where the washer and drier are kept. He places the dragon on the drier and throws everything into the washer. Once that’s started, he looks over at the red and gold creature and asks, “You hungry?”
Eventually, Steve lays his hands over Tony’s, stilling them. Steve says that he understands. He tells Tony that he’s not a monster or a murderer or an idiot. Steve presses Tony’s hands to his cheeks and tells Tony how beautiful and brave and how smart he is. He tells Tony how proud he is that Tony looked at the empire he created and, when he saw that he didn’t like, he tore it down and started over. Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and the other around his shoulders, a hand sinking into Tony’s hair.
He doesn’t think much of it at first. A handful of drawings of Stark’s neck can be explained away as a somewhat morbid fascination with the aesthetic beauty of his scars. A few drawings of Stark’s hands is just practice because hands are terribly intricate and far too easy to—as the French would put it—utterly fuck up.
mistake on my part. I was going to report him to my dad and the police but he hired a witch to curse me. The curse, which was, and I quote, to ‘turn me as small and insignificant
That is to say, the general public doesn’t know he’s Ironman. Nor the Avengers. Just a few higher ups in S.H.I.E.L.D. know.
Baby perks up and looks about for the shiny metal falcon clip. He finds it and trills, holding it out with both clawed hands to Steve.
Tony shrugs and signs to her that that’s okay. That he only wants to be able to say one phrase, anyway.
He hears the soft clanking noise of something being placed on the tabletop by his hip. Cold hands cup his face. When he finally raises his eyes, Tony’s starting at him like he could pour his very heart into Steve’s chest if he only looked at him hard enough.
Baby runs out of the room and straight to where Bucky’s curled up on the couch. He hops up onto Bucky’s chest and kneads at Bucky’s chest with his front claws.
