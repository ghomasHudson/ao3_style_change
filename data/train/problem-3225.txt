“We are?” he asked, surprised with an asked most childlike innocence to his voice.
They stayed in town for a few days and at night, Castiel noticed Dean slipping out. He rolled over and didn't say a word about it the next morning. After a few nights of that, Castiel got used to it and easily slept through it. While Castiel stayed in bed, Dean would go out to get them something to eat. How Dean got any time to sleep at all was a mystery to him, but Castiel knew Dean was used to that kind of life.
“Why aren't you doing anything?” He asked him. “Why didn't you call the cops?” When Castiel didn't answer, Dean pressed again. “Castiel. Answer me. I'm not in handcuffs right now and I don't think I will be tonight unless it's attached to our headboard.”
It was a year into the relationship before Dean finally told Castiel the truth. Well, part of the truth. They were sitting on the couch, the TV on in the background as they made out hot and heavy. They were talking about a strain of cold cases from the 80s that Castiel knew were connected. Dean, of course, recognized them and to change the subject, he started kissing Castiel’s neck, then his jaw, then his lips. Castiel kept babbling on and on but Dean wasn't paying attention and planned on getting Castiel that way as well. When nothing changed, he looked up at him and listened to him recall the small details anyone else would have forgotten. It was both his favorite and least favorite of Castiel's qualities.
“You can't tell anyone,” Dean said suddenly. “I don't care who asks, this stays between us.”
Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head. Oh, if only he knew.
“It's alright, Dean, I understand.”
“I did,” Dean said. “Kind of hard to turn something like that down.”
Castiel still doesn't know how, but it was something else he suspects John for. When Dean told him, he casually mentioned it over dinner like it was nothing. When he tried to follow up on it, Dean quickly changed the subject again. That was one of the only ways Castiel could get Dean to talk about his childhood.
“Yeah, they're connected,” Dean said, causing Castiel to give a slight smile, probably proud of his new theory. “My dad did all of those.”
“God, Dean, I wanna meet them,” Castiel breathed, causing Dean to short circuit a little bit. “Dean, let me meet them.”
Castiel pushed Dean away and quickly got off the bed. Dean quickly followed and blocked the door, causing Castiel to snort at him.
Vaguely he wondered when his life became so revolved around Dean.
The two spent the next few days in Wichita until Dean decided that it time to move again. Instead of wandering, Dean had a seemed to have a set goal in mind.
Two days after Castiel discovered that Dean was the serial killer he had been hunting his whole career, Dean came home from a “job” out of town. Castiel had started to question everything about their relationship, falling apart again and again. There was no way for someone to handle something like this, and Castiel was stuck so he depended solely on his logic. Logically, he knew that a job out of town was probably another murder. He looked deeper into the cases and noticed small connections that were ignored or covered up. The victims each had bad track records, ranging from stealing from charity or assault and battery, but that still didn't change that someone had murdered them in cold blood. He and Dean had a trusting, communicative relationship and it was now ruined.
He gave Castiel a wounded look for a second but he quickly brushed it off and stood up straighter.
Luckily for him, he got a phone call for a case. It was right outside of town so he didn't have to go far, but it gave him an excuse to get out of the house and he welcomed it as a chance to have something to occupy his mind. After Dean’s insistence, he accepted the job. It was almost two weeks before Dean finally cornered him so they could talk.
“We were originally going west, but you changed that this morning,” he said and tried to remember the last road sign he saw. “Right now, we're in…” he paused a bit and glanced at Dean to see a reaction. “Kansas. Almost outside of Wichita.” Dean’s expression didn't change but he did suddenly became more concentrated on the road. “I know it's where you grew up, and if we keep driving for a few more hours we'll be in Missouri…”
“I don't know, yet, Dean,” Castiel said softly, not meeting his eye. “You lied to me. I'm questioning everything about our relationship.”
“I won't get caught because you already tell me everything,” Dean said slowly. “After our three month mark, you started talking to me about cases and you've always talked in your sleep so I knew where you were going with everything.”
“What, I'm funny!”
One week later, he was looking for apartments in the area.
“Why the hell not?” Castiel asked. “It's dumb not to. You wear gloves, you make sure bullets can't be traced back to you, why not that?”
“Cas, baby, I can explain,” Dean started to say.
Even though he never got an explanation for it, Castiel knew it was because they moved around too much. He was surprised Sam did so well in school while Dean had potential of his own. Judging by how dismissive of his own accomplishments Dean is, it's probably another result of John’s parenting style.
Long hours on the road wore Dean down a bit, allowing Castiel to pick his mind. He learned a few more things about him, and Dean’s mannerisms made more sense now that he's able to observe them and where they come from. A lot of things, like Dean checking to make sure the windows and doors were locked each night, or how he got agitated when he realized they had eaten the rest of something without him knowing first, Castiel thought it was just because he was used to playing a parental role in an unsafe environment. Each time they heard a siren in the distance, Dean would flinch and suddenly become tense. Going out in public meant that Dean's shoulders became tense and he'd quickly try to sort out their surroundings into what was safe and what was a potential threat.
-----
“Knock it off,” Castiel hissed.
“Yeah, but it was never your boy,” Gabriel said. “How long have you been after him? Six, seven year?”
“I've been thinking about it for a while,” Castiel said.
Dean stepped closer and ran his fingers on Castiel’s cheek.
Soft daylight streamed in through the curtains. Groaning, Dean rolled over, almost on top of Castiel. He tossed an arm across his chest and a leg over his as well. Castiel made a groan of his own and pushed him off, not wanting to stay in bed with him any longer. Taking a cold shower should help clear his mind and wake him up, and hopefully it wouldn't wake Dean either.
“I'm not gonna lie to you, Cas,” he said, his voice dropping dangerously low. Castiel had only heard that voice a small handful of times and it always put him on edge. “I know you're still here because you want to be. I told you exactly where I was, I never, never, lied to you, and if you wanted me gone, you would have called the cops by now.”
“Dean, move,” he said.
Eventually Dean ended his more than enthusiast greeting and resumed with making dinner. The table was carefully set and everything precisely put into its place. Castiel hummed and did a few things here and there, knowing Dean was planning something but he wasn't quite sure what. Dean kept fiddling with something in his pocket and suddenly Castiel knew what was coming. He saw the box in Dean’s underwear drawer weeks ago and they had discussed marriage more than a handful of times.
“You have to be more patient. It takes time to find a serial killer.”
Castiel shook his head. “That still doesn't make it right.”
He was always the romantic and took a certain possessive joy in showing as many strangers as he could that he and Castiel were together, so he was more than happy that Dean chose to propose in private. He didn't even bat an eye when Dean slid off his chair and got down on one knee to propose, a long speech already prepared.
“And I decided that you were and child and you were in a vulnerable position so you did what your father expected of you.”
Castiel smiled a little bit and nodded. “We're good.”
Once Dean was settled in and asleep, Castiel quietly laid awake, thinking about everything that had happened that night. He only knew bits and pieces about Dean’s past and he never pushed him too hard on it because he knew that would lead to Dean shutting him out or storming off. He'd always apologize to him and bring home flowers, but it didn't do much to append his reaction or that he knew little information about Dean’s past. That coupled with the color of Dean’s blood…
“And apparently you are.”
Castiel froze up for a moment, staring at him in stunned disbelief, then he quickly ran towards the door. With a snarl, Dean gave chase, quickly catching up. He pushed Castiel against the wall and held him there but was careful not to hurt him. They made eye contact, and they could both feel each other's hearts racing. Castiel was the first to break it and he cringed at the sight of the blood running down Dean’s face and onto his clothes.
“This doesn't change things,” Castiel said after a long stretch of silence.
There was an almost unbearable stretch of silence before Castiel shot forward and kissed Dean roughly. He grunted in surprise and before he could respond to it, Castiel was cradling his head and kissing his face. “I'm sorry, Dean, I'm so sorry…”
Two hours of isolation didn't give him any hope. Dean was in the wind, and Castiel was stuck in the Midwest, his career surely over if they found any proof that he knew about Dean’s hobbies.
Dean smiled, glad Castiel said what was on his mind instead of just hiding it. He put his hands on his hips and turned him around so he was facing him and immediately stepped closer.
It was Thursday night and Castiel had just gotten back in town. Dean was in the kitchen preparing a large dinner for both of them.
Making sure he made enough noise, Dean took the breakfast upstairs to Castiel. He sat down next to him on the bed and set the tray carefully in his lap as Castiel sat up and rubbed his eyes. Dean smiled and happily kissed his cheek then sat back on the bed and watched him eat breakfast. The fact that he was eating something Dean served him lifted his spirits, and his mind started planning things for their day. Castiel tolerated the staring for a while then stopped and stared back at him, forcing Dean to look away.
“I know it'll take a lot for you to get over this, sweetheart,” Dean said. Castiel just made a disapproving noise so Dean continued. “You know, I can tell you about everything now. Your job is to think like a killer, and now you have one.”
Castiel hummed a little bit and Dean moved between his legs, rubbing his thighs thoughtfully.
“Yeah, Cas?” Dean made a brief glance over, sensing that something was off.
Something shifted and Castiel quickly nodded and started to help him to the car. Four hours later, they were back home and Dean was snoozing softly beside Castiel. He had gotten a total of three stitches in his  middle finger. Castiel didn't know if it was medication they gave him or if he was actually upset that he'd have to wait to give someone the bird until after it healed.
When they were quiet, lying together in bed, Castiel couldn't help but think of the things Dean must have done. His father took pleasure in violating his victims, but he doubted Dean did the same. John’s killings were about power and hate, while Dean’s were about revenge and his own sense of justice. There was a shift in the mattress as Dean moved off of Castiel completely and rested on his side.
“I… it's a part of the code.”
“And…?”
“Dean, we're going east,” Castiel said with a small smile.
There were a few figures that he mentioned. The first person he fell in love with, the first guy he kissed, the few people his father would trust his children with if he was away for an extended period of time. Why John trusted them with his children Castiel had no idea. They could know about his… activities, or he could be hiding it from them as well.
Dean would come to bed smelling like gunpowder.
“Yes, it does,” he said but leaned back down to kiss Dean again anyway. “I wanna meet them…”
Castiel’s outburst quieted Dean who just stared blankly at him. He sighed and took a deep breath, trying to calm down again.
Slowly, Dean got down on his knees in front of Castiel, and given no reason to pause, he moved forward and put his hands on Castiel’s hips and slowly, hesitantly rubbed them. He leaned forward and kissed Castiel’s stomach, just under his belly button and made him shiver, but his plan worked and he got his full attention once more.
"Okay, but have I ever told you about the bodies?"
Well this was definitely something Dean wasn't expecting. He expected disgust, maybe even rage given Castiel’s line of work. It wouldn't be an easy thing to find out that your boyfriend had a part in a case you put most of your career into. Still a littke surprised and confused, Dean had to pull him off and hold him at arm’s length so he could get a bearing on the situation.
There was another pause before Castiel was nodding along to Dean’s request.
“Don't know what to do,” Castiel said and kept kissing him. “You make me so angry, Dean.”
“I don't know!” Castiel shouted. “I don't know! I know I should have turned you in the second I found out. You kill people, for God’s sake…”
“Baby, just hear me out,” Dean said almost desperately.
Eventually, Castiel spent more and more time working on the case. There was less tension around Dean and he stopped avoiding him. They were so close to catching the guy when he got an emergency call from Gabriel. The CEO of Morningstar Security was murdered in the parking lot and he was calling in a favor. Despite how much he liked the current case, he wasn't very needed and Gabriel seem distressed. He dropped everything and drove half an hour with no idea what was waiting for him.
Dean smiled and clapped him on the shoulder. “See, you're finally starting towards that life of crime!”
“Baby, it isn't that easy…”
Oops that took a while
Hearing footsteps, he stood up straighter. Gabriel called out to him and Castiel felt his panic flare up again. He looked around and spotted a red erase button. Without hesitation, he pressed it and the footage of Dean was gone. With his heart pounding in his chest, Castiel stood up and straightened out his tie.
“We could get something at a store,” Castiel mused. “Neither of us have eaten anything healthy since we started this trip.”
“Fucking hell, Cas!” He shouted as he grabbed his nose.
Dean sighed and rubbed his face.
Dean suddenly let go, obeying Castiel's wishes, but he quickly blocked the door so he could trap Castiel again if he tried to run.
Castiel just rolled his eyes and informed Dean that while yes, he would marry him, they were both much too old for grand romantic gestures so the nice dinner he prepared was just fine with him. Of course Dean would still go the whole nine yards in his own special way. He was Dean fucking Winchester and he didn't half ass anything, especially not when he was doing something for his soul mate.
“It's date night, Cas,” he insisted. “You're back just in time for it so we gotta go big.”
Before Dean could respond, Castiel started to kiss and nip his way down Dean’s neck. Skillful hands tugged open the buttons of his shirt, and with Castiel on top of his like this, squirming and needy, Dean could forget about all of his problems.
That almost made Dean shiver in disgust.
“‘Til death do us part, right?” Dean said with a grin.
Meeting Dean's extended family went by in a blur. He was brought to a dive bar and hastily introduced to a few people whom he doesn't remember the names of which was probably Dean’s intention. The whole time, Dean acted jumpy and like he was ready to leave at a moment's notice. He constantly watched the door and was fidgeting through dinner to the point Castiel decided it better to just leave. Dean also didn't mention anything about it days later and avoided the topic anytime he sensed that Castiel was going to bring it up. Soon enough, their world buzzed by, and they fell back into their routine.
“Damn. Thought they didn't have those.”
“Dean,” Castiel said as his fiancé sped down a back road that even god didn't know where, “Why are we running? What happened?”
Dean’s mother's name is Mary.
Then there's also the blood. Everyone gets clear blood as they start out, and naturally it gets darker as they grow and mature. But other things can change it too. There are also things that can happen that can darken it further. Dean soon learned that the darkest Castiel has ever seen was a dark cherry, almost black. The man who it came out of was the worst serial killer Castiel ever faced. He can still remember seeing it after the man made sure he would never go to prison. There were laws set up to make sure no one was unfairly prosecuted, but no one really followed it. A self righteous jury gave quick, harsh convictions regardless of the laws in place. Even in his own career, Castiel had to continue with an investigation based on a trick to draw a drop of blood or two. He was just thankful that he had someone he could trust to come home too at the end of an especially rough day.
Castiel did a double take, staring at Dean for a moment in disbelief and at that moment, they were both sure they were feeling the same thing, the same pull. They both kept eye contact for a while, waiting taking in the other and waiting for him to say something. Castiel’s phone started ringing and he answered it immediately, undoubtedly about the recent murder. The thought caused Dean to start getting twitchy, something he never did anymore because he learned how to repress it. Getting twitchy meant you started getting sloppy and getting sloppy meant making mistakes and making mistakes meant the chair.
Castiel nodded and cupped Dean’s face in his hands, rubbing his cheek bones with his thumbs.
When Gabriel came in, he said he didn't find anything and left quickly, going straight home. Once he got there, he just sat in the driveway, staring at the front door. Dean wouldn't be home for a few days, so Castiel could easily leave if he wanted to. He felt numb. The shock that Dean, his fiancé, his soul mate, was a serial killer. He'd so readily accepted that Dean had a hand in the murders John Winchester had committed but he hadn't stopped to think about how it would affect Dean outside of the trauma he would have experienced.
“We're heading west,” Dean said after a while.
“If you don't let me go, I swear to God, Dean…!”
“I'll tell you later, promise, baby, but right now we need to get to a hospital so I can get stitches, okay?”
The second time he saw Castiel, it was completely coincidental. Dean was furious. There was no room for error, and an accident like that would mean he would end up in the electric chair. His newest case landed him in Castiel’s home base. Instead of taking careful time to research it, he rushed into town figuring it would be open and shut. Of course he ran into Castiel when he was fleeing the crime scene. When he bumped shoulders with Castiel, he was even carrying a bag of his equipment. Luckily, it wasn't on their radar yet but it soon would be. Caught off guard, the well seasoned hunter quickly became flustered. His blood roared in his ears and he could feel his heart start to flutter.
He didn't fight when the officers cuffed him, knowing from experience that any attempt at resistance would be seen in the harshest light. Despite their efforts, they wouldn't find anything. Dean would have taken everything with him and covered his tracks, whether this was intentional or not.
“Stop doing that.” Castiel said sternly, grabbing Dean’s attention. “Stop blaming yourself for things you can't control. You were a child, and you still came forward. What you must have went through…”
With a groan, Gabriel rubbed his face and gestured towards the screen that played on a loop of a man walking up to Lucas Morningstar and shooting him point-blank in the chest.
“What do you know?” Castiel asked.
“Angry’s good,” Dean breathed. “Angry’s real good.”
“I don't care about that,” he said. “I care about you being safe.”
“At least I don't have to spend all my time at a desk worrying over every little detail.”
“Morningstar recently had a restraining order taken out on him by his son,” Dean said. “His wife died 10 years ago in suspicious circumstances and he was cleared, but he obviously wasn't innocent. A woman that's finally leaving her dickbag of a husband doesn't just accidentally swerve off the road and into a lake.”
I'm going to *try* to keep updating on Sundays, but life is hectic right now. I have intentions to finish this story, but I can't get the motivation or focus needed right now. I have most of the next two chapters figured out and the next is partially done but unedited and I hope to have it up next week.
“What do you think I did?”
“What do you think, Dean?” he snapped. “I found out the man that I'm engaged to-” Dean let out a small sigh of relief at that “-is the serial killer that I've been tracking my whole career!”
It was easy for Castiel to pretend that this was just a small vacation. He called into work and took time off, which hadn't been an easy thing to do, but for Dean he was willing to. Everything was so peaceful, and now that they were relatively stable in one place, it was easier to believe things would go back to normal.
During his ride to the police station where he knew he would be questioned, Castiel searched for any signs of Dean. He didn't find anything. Castiel was quickly processed and locked in a room, heavy cuffs still around his wrists. Everything was hushed, and the lack of information he was getting told Castiel what he needed to know. Somehow, someone found out about Dean. They finally figured out who he is and caught wind of where he's staying.
The standard yellow tape was up and the body has long been removed from the crime scene. With a flash of his badge, Castiel easily got access to everything. Blood was on the ground despite everything being covered with rain. A few people buzzed around Castiel, trying to get pictures of everything and collect samples before the rain washed it all away. Castiel paused at the door when he saw a giant red cross spray painted over the door. Suddenly, he realized why Gabriel had called him.
“We've worked with less,” Castiel reminded him.
There were only a few things that Castiel knew about Dean’s childhood. Most of it was only bits and pieces, and there's still a lot of it that he doesn't know. What he does know, he only knows a few things about it.
Gabriel rolled his eyes at that.
The blood was the most unsettling thing to him. Even with John Winchester as his father, it shouldn't have turned out that way. Unless he was more involved than he said he was. But that was ridiculous, wasn't it? A few cases indicated that it was a team, but it would have been almost impossible for a boy to help move a body, even if that boy was trained from a young age, not to mention that Dean would be showing the aftereffects of that trauma, and he knew Dean didn't have the knowledge or capability to hide something like that.
Castiel didn't respond and focused on scrubbing the stove top, trying to get off a tough piece of burnt on cheese. Dean frowned a little when he saw Castiel’s lack of response. He went up behind him like he usually did, arms wrapping around his waist and head resting on his shoulder. He started to settle behind him and Castiel’s panic spiked again and he spun around and punched Dean in the nose, immediately causing him to pull away.
Their father was mostly absent, leaving Dean to act as a parent to them both. John claimed to be working a few odd jobs here and there, something he now knows if false. As quickly as they came into town, they were whisked out of it which was the cause of the third thing Castiel knew about Dean.
“Before I do anything else, I'm gonna ask why the hell you did that,” Dean said, internally seething but he carefully kept his emotions in check. Castiel had a fleeting thought that this is what Dean's victims last saw. “I know you've been stressed and you've seen some shit so I'm gonna try to give you that. So what the fucking hell, Cas?”
“I know you're freaking out,” Dean said when Castiel was preparing dinner.
Many of Castiel’s past relationships had failed for this reason, and he was starting to see why. There was something unsettling about it, and when Dean slid into bed that night after being out of the house for five hours, he almost pushed him back out of it. Still, he didn't protest when Dean crawled on top of him and started kissing up and down his neck.
He didn't answer and Dean sat up straighter and moved closer to him. Desperate for some kind of response, Dean reached out him and tried to get Castiel to look at him.
Dean has a wide assortment of knives and guns.
He shook his head and backed away, feeling his panic start to rise. Dean looked hurt and stepped forward, reaching out for him.
Dean made a noise in the back of his throat and shifted closer to Castiel. Tentatively, he reached out and put a hand on Castiel’s hip. When he wasn't pushed away, he took that as a good sign and moved closer to him.
“I'm still an FBI agent, Dean,” he said, deepening his voice in an attempt to be ta Ken seriously.
“But it's not,” Castiel said. “Not in a relationship.”
“Then don't keep things from me.”
Steeling himself, Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath before dropping the bag and stepping towards Dean. He pushed him up against the wall and kissed him roughly, all teeth and scratchy stubble. Dean made a surprised noise but he was quickly pushing back, trying to angle Castiel towards the bed. Castiel pushed back, kissing and shoving until Dean was lying on the bed. He quickly climbed on top of him, and, straddling him, he started kissing him again.
“Cas, baby, sweetheart…”
Castiel didn't say anything, watching Dean carefully.
“Mmm. Don't know why you held out that long, Cassie.”
To Castiel’s surprise, Dean did move out of the way. Castiel blinked in surprise then stood up a little straighter and grabbed a bag and started to pack it. There was no attempt at intervention and Dean just quietly stood there, watching him. Once he was satisfied with what was packed, Castiel picked up his bag and started toward the door. He glanced back at Dean, and paused a little bit. Everything seemed to steady, and he started paying attention to their heartbeats. His was fast but Dean’s was running a mile a minute, even though his face was emotionless.
Of course, the soul mate system isn't always reliable. It still comes down to whether or not the people who are bonded chose to put something into a relationship. There's still the chance that after their initial rush of meeting, they'll one day wake up feeling disconnected or simply there's someone else in their life. Some people don't get them at all, and others are slightly modified. New bonds were formed every day and old ones were broken, as painful at that process can be. From the moment someone is born, they can hear their soul mate’s heartbeat. Cutting that link off can be devastating, but life saving as well.
“Dean?” Castiel asked suddenly feeling tired.
“Why aren't you pissed right now?” Dean asked, raising an eyebrow.
Wow I got this done a lot later than I hoped. I've been super busy lately, but I'm hoping to get back on a semi-regular posting schedule.
“I love you too…”
“That doesn't mean you can just kill someone,” Castiel said and crossed his arms over his chest.
He closes his eyes and raises his voice to the sky one final time and repeats aloud his only remaining prayer: “I love you, too, Cas.”
Cas backs up toward the outer wall of the bunker.
“I, uh, got two copies,” Dean says, breaking the silence. He clears his throat before continuing. “In case you wanted one.”
Cas continues to ignore him. He signs with Eileen happily and makes small talk about the weather in Topeka with Sam, who is headed there with Eileen tomorrow to check out a potential case.
“We have to find a way to bring him back. Anything,” Dean had told him. They were in the library, pouring over yet another stack of books.
“There are days I’m not. God, what I’ve put Sammy through in the past few months alone, you don’t even know, man.” He shakes his head, pushing that thought away and pushing forward, “I don’t deserve his forgiveness, but I’ll take it. I’ll try to be worth it. I’ll try to be the person you both think I am. But that day, Cas, I was. I was because of you.”
It had been that image that Benny kept in mind as he agreed to let Cas travel with them.
Benny took the hint and began planting kisses and gentle bites, not hard enough to break skin, along Dean’s neck and jaw. He followed each bite with a gentle flick of his tongue. While he did this, he pressed the length of himself against Dean, Dean hard against him. He rocked forward and bit down gently where Dean’s neck met his shoulder.
“You’re alive,” Dean whispers, one hand coming to rest on Cas’ chest, the other reaching up to gently cup his face.
It had been a matter of convenience, at first, to Benny. The portal had been a rumor that he’d heard for years, but with no human around to explore it, it stayed in the back of his mind. From the moment he laid eyes on Dean, though, he was intrigued. He was different from the hunters he had encountered back on earth, who would kill first and ask questions never. Maybe it was just the circumstances, but as time went on and they fought side-by-side, he felt an unexpected bond growing between them.
Dean goes to bed early and stares at the ceiling until sleep takes him.
He’s here and he's safe and that’s all that matters in this moment.
Sam had told him that while remnants of Cas’ fading grace might remain, he would be mostly-human. And mostly-humans snore like buzzsaws after a long night of being raised from the Empty.
He closes his eyes and breathes. Instinctively, he stands and takes Dean’s empty coffee mug to the sink. He returns and places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. The curve of muscle and bone below his hand is warm and solid. Real.
He allows himself to ignore Sam’s presence, pushing away the voice in the back of his head that tells him to hold back – always hold back, and holds
“Oh, no,” Cas says, holding up his hands in front of him, palms outward to signal stop. “I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t mean to worry you. There’s been no sign of him.”
There are no words to describe the pain of being ripped from your happiest moment and thrown into a sea of your worst. Drowning is instant and infinite.
Dean had said once. It feels like a thousand lifetimes ago. And what was it the Reverend had replied?
The older brother looks up him, seeking the reassurance he doesn’t feel like he deserves. Sam’s face softens.
He feels the steady weight of Cas’ hand on his back, thumb rubbing reassuring circles on his shoulder. I’m here, the touch says. This is real.
“I’m sorry to have added to your worries, Dean,” Cas replies, face still dark, but he reaches for the plant, taking it into his hands and holding it gently.
“Tell me again,” he says, voice thick from sleep.
The words spark and float away on the breeze.
“No. Cas - I can’t. I can’t believe you, man.” He turns away from Cas.
Dean nods. “Yeah, okay. Okay,” he pauses again. “Can - can I get a picture? I picked up a camera. From the Gas ‘N Sip.”
He sets his untouched cup of coffee on the counter and leaves the kitchen without another word.
Dean let out an exasperated sigh and said, “Enough, Cas. I said I’ll take my chances. You’re coming with us and that’s that.”
“Dean?” Sam prompts.
“He’s not
He considers grabbing the bottle of Jack from the kitchen and heading back to his room. He leaves the bottle where is it and instead goes out to the garage.
“Keep doing what you’re doing and you can have me however you like, man,” Dean had gasped then, breathless and more than a little desperate for release.
He hadn’t dared to hope that Dean’s thoughts were meant in the way Cas wished they were. He couldn’t. His heart would have burst, and then broken. The Empty would have come. What he wanted – it was something that he understood he would never have.
Cas’ gaze is fixed on him, eyes soft.
Dean grunted his acknowledgement but said nothing.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says firmly. “Looking the part is part of the job. You know that.”
Dean had agreed to his plan – so long as they found the angel and took him along. Fine. He’d waited long enough, and while he thought the idea was a damn foolish one – an angel being a beacon for danger, bringing every fanged creature in the forest gunning for them – if that was what it would take, he’d find the feathered thing that Dean was so attached to.
Dean sneaks a glance over at Cas, trying not to let him see, but ends up caught in his eyes anyway, ensnared by the blue of his gaze.
“Dean, the Shadow showed me things about Purgatory – our first time there. And I – I didn’t remember it fully either. Naomi – she must have – it doesn’t matter. The point is: it wouldn’t have changed anything, for me.” He brings his hand to rest on top of Dean’s on his chest. “I would have loved you the same as I have since I first held your soul. Dean, nothing would have changed.”
It hadn’t been long before Benny let out a curse, a final thrust, and spilled over Dean’s hands. Benny pulled Dean into a rough kiss.
“Are you sure this is customary? And necessary?” Cas looks doubtfully down at the accessory.
“I am sorry, Dean,” Cas continues, “but I did want to tell you about something I found while I was looking.”
Dean talked well into the night, until he was hoarse from it. He had curled up at the foot of the nearest tree and Benny heard him whisper one last promise: “I’ll see you soon, Cas.”
“Cas, hold on a minute,” Dean had said after an hour or so of walking, waving Benny to scout on ahead. Cas turned to face him, keeping his face neutral as best he could.
“Cas, I had to go back to Purgatory,” Dean continues. “I did – there was a spell. I’ll tell you all about it later, but there’s things – there’s things I didn’t know. Things I didn’t remember. Cas, I hope you can forgive me. If I’d have known – I wouldn’t have – these past seven years – I –”
Hurt and frustrated and confused, Dean gives up on space and tries Cas’ cell phone. After the fifth call, he finds the phone laying on the table in the map room.
“Is this what you want?” he growled, holding Dean in place. Dean shifted below his weight.
“Don’t,” was all Dean had said. “Don’t.”
Sam puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze.
He keeps a little pocket calendar with birthdays noted and sends the goofiest cards he can find, writing cheesy messages inside before mailing them out. He knows the lady at the post office well.
Dean puts his head in his hands, pressing his worn hands against his eyes. It’s been at least an hour and no sign of Cas.
He’s asking for this. Cas can give him this.
“You’re right, I didn’t know. You were safe and I didn’t know. You didn’t tell me you were safe.” Dean slams his fist down on the kitchen table, his fear coming out as anger.
“Of course, Dean,” he replies, softly.
Cas comes back into the room much later, that he knows.
Sam found the spell three days later. They hadn’t talked since that morning in the kitchen.
Crouched down in the dirt of Purgatory, he continues reciting the words and is suddenly disoriented by an onslaught of memories. Rowena didn’t say anything about this, but he knows that magic always has its cost. His hands shoot up to his head, as pain sparks behind his eyes.
“We’ll figure something else out,” she says.
He had watched as grieving groups found comfort and community in haunting hymns. He’d heard the songs of joy and praise ring out in celebration at the hearths of families and across victoriously liberated nations. He’d even seen the soft and secret sounds of lovers’ serenades.
The words strike Cas, but he refuses to let the Shadow see how the memories, and its words, have affected him. He knew that Naomi wiped memories from him. But if Dean remembered everything, and nothing had changed, wasn’t that an answer in and of itself? Cas feels the hope he hadn’t known he was holding onto begin to slip away. Doubt, that first emotion he had ever felt, begins to creep in.
“What I’m trying to say is that I should have been better to you. I should have been there for you. I
He’d slugged Sam hard the last time he asked what happened with Cas the night he died.
“This is important to you,” Cas states slowly, confused, but not actually questioning.
When Cas was killed by Lucifer, Dean’s prayers were still tinged with desperation, but they were full of reflection. Mourning. He had no idea where angels went when they died, if Cas might hear him. But there were things he needed to confess, so he spoke them for only the angel to hear:
“You’ve been moping around for a week, buddy. I’ve tried to give you space, but enough’s enough. Talk to me.” Dean tilts his head toward the seat across from him at the kitchen table.
say it before. I didn’t say anything, but – thank you,” Dean says. The words don’t feel like enough, but he hopes Cas understands. How Cas saved him – again and again. How he changed him; from the moment Cas laid hands on him in Hell, Dean was saved. He was loved. And he may have taken it for granted for too long, but he understands the stakes now.
With a frustrated exhale, Dean shakes his head. “No, I don’t think it is, Sam.”
Dean gets up from the table and begins pacing the room.
First, the Shadow comes as Naomi. Again, and again, she shows him how he killed Dean. Over and over. Hundreds of times. But he knows that was not real. He may have experienced the pain of the actions, but he had stopped short when it came to the real Dean. The Dean who needed him.
He had admired the genius of later humans who developed the written word and, with that skill, began to write out their melodious ballads. They had invented more complex, longer-lasting musical instruments, and in turn, produced even more intricate compositions. An impromptu marvel of creation spanning across human history, he could appreciate the creativity, the craftmanship, the storytelling, the rhythm. All the parts that create the whole.
Cas wants to hope that, somehow, he is saved. But the pain coursing through him warns him of a different fate.
Despite this, Castiel found that he couldn’t come to understand the emotions that this thing – this music – evoked in humans.
Dean flinches at the words that had angered him so much just days before. He looks down at the floor.
And it is. The next day, Dean wakes up to find his arm flung across Cas’ chest. His face pressed against his shoulder.
It was Dean’s turn to let out a moan. He tightened his grip in Benny’s hair.
“Stay with me here, please,” Dean whispers, wiping the back of his hand across his eyes to catch the tears that have started falling. “I want you to stay here. Please stay.”
“No, I’m not talking about this again, man. I mean it - you ask me again and I’ll break your nose. Just find a way to get him back.”
“You’re mad?” Cas asks, raising an eyebrow.
Still, beside that coursing river, held tight in Dean’s arms, for the first time since arriving in Purgatory he felt awash in something close to divinity. He wanted to sink into it, dive into its depth. The feeling of being held by the one he loved was overwhelming. Anna had been right: it did get worse. And he knew then that he would gladly drown in it.
“I know,” Cas whispered.
he repeats to himself.
“Do you know how long you’ve been here? No one is saving you. You think you’re awake because of some divine intervention? You’re awake because I want you to be. Because if I have to be, then you will be. You’ve been a little thorn in my side and now I get to return the favor.”
“That does sound nice,” Dean concedes, “I can see why you’ve enjoyed reading them.”
He knew too that Dean would drown with him if he did, and that he could never allow to happen.
“Cas –” Dean doesn’t know where to begin but tries anyway: “I don’t ever want you to leave again. After everything that’s happened, I’m not sure of much, but I – I’m sure that I need you here. And I need you to know that when I say that, I don’t mean for your powers. I’m glad you’ve got your mojo back, man, I am, but I don’t care about that beyond it making
“You seem surprised,” Cas says, trying to keep his voice light to match Dean’s. Visions flash in Cas’ mind – black, cold, and boundless. Nothing. Endless nothing.
Over the next few weeks, Cas’ garden expands and so does his time outside, the sunshine reviving him with each passing day. He soaks in it – and Dean would swear that some days he shines in it. He watches the bees in the morning and the fireflies in the evening. He works on his growing garden and seems – well, if not happy, at least content.
It’s not that there hadn’t been time to think about it before.
life, full of people who see him and love him for everything he is, and he loves them right back. The words still might not come easy to him, but he shows it as best as he can:
“Yeah?” Dean asks, looking hopeful.
The Empty is surprisingly full. Full of regrets, full of despair, full of desperation to escape, but there is no escape – there is only more Empty.
a familiar voice resounding in his mind. The only voice he wants to hear.
For all of Dean’s cracks about his halo and harp, angels weren’t much for music outside of heralding trumpets and blowing of battle horns. Like most everything in Heaven, music was functional and tied to duty. While Castiel comprehended that there was more to it than that for humans, he had never experienced the range of feelings that he knew it could produce.
to you – come with us. Come with me.
Dean raises his eyes to meet Cas’ gaze. Without allowing himself time to think about it, he brings his hand up to place on top of Cas’, holding it in place. Dean’s palm trembles on contact, but he runs his fingers gently across Cas’ - the movement barely perceptible by sight.
The next three days pass by slowly and, all at once, in a blur.
“What - you can’t be serious. You’re comparing us saving you to Chuck?” He flings the name out like a swear.
Cas is quiet for a moment, then sighs, getting up from the table. “It was my stupid choice to make, Dean.”
“You don’t have to say it,” he heard himself saying, “I heard your prayer.”
Dean waits in the library, thinking Cas will come looking for him after his shower. He knows that his friend has to be exhausted - coming back from the dead will do that. But they have a lot to catch up on. A lot to talk about. A lot that Dean has to figure out quickly what he wants to say.
Cas blinked and shot him a look of frustration. “Dean, it’s not that simple –”
“Unfortunately, yes,” Dean replies with a sour look. “How could I forget? Sammy showed me once. They know we’re brothers and still they –“
And Dean never wants Cas to be unsure of him again.
He pauses and breathes, then continues, “But I see now. And I have to say it.”
“And I know what you’re thinking now, too. That I’ve planted some false memory to torment you. That’s the grand surprise. I don’t need to! There’s enough hidden up there in your pretty little head to do the job just fine for me.”
“You can’t save everyone, my friend… though, you try,” he had said, after setting Dean’s memories straight. He had shown him that he had never intended to leave when Dean had escaped. That one moment, entirely rewritten in Dean’s mind. But once righted, Dean had thought that was the extent of what he’d missed.
Whenever he smells the dewy morning grass or feels the warm rays of the sun waking up, or sees Cas, standing with his face to the sky and wings fluttering in the breeze, Dean can summon up that moment in his mind – the final puzzle piece falling into place to reveal them, together, in full bloom.
“I thought so, too. But a week ago, the gladiolus you gave me was dying. I –” he looks sheepishly down at the ground. “I think I may have overwatered it. I had my hand to it and I was just wishing that I could fix it and – well, you see it now. So, I’ve been trying other things. I wasn’t sure about – about my wings, but I thought – maybe –”
Despite his fear that Cas chose to leave him, the alternative that he
He can’t, however, avoid the fullness of his joy shining through when Dean snaps the small button on the plastic camera’s right-hand corner.
“I ain’t sayin’ I like it, wastin’ all this time runnin’ ‘round here when we could be gettin’ out,” Benny said, “That bein’ said, we’ll find your feather boy, if that’s what it takes to get you to make the jump.” He had punctuated his declaration with a firm nod, as if it was that simple. Decided and that’s that.
Cas raises an eyebrow, still frowning, like he is trying to piece together a puzzle that he’s certain is missing a few pieces. The picture out of focus.
Cas’ face is still stony, but his blue eyes are fixed on Dean and full of something – and Dean thinks it might be hope. He allows that thought to bolster him as he continues.
He’d pulled Cas to his feet, shouldering most of his weight. Cas’ eyes had closed again the second Dean had helped situate him in the passenger seat of the Impala.
has no power there.
He pushes down the immediate feeling of guilt at that thought.
Dean turns around to face Cas. Maybe there will be a day when he’s not struck by the man in front of him, but this isn’t that day, and frankly, he hopes that day never comes. Even in faded jeans and one of Dean’s old t-shirts, the sight of Cas knocks the breath out of Dean. When Cas gives him a soft, crooked smile, Dean’s knees feel weak. He pulls at Cas’ – his – shirt, dragging him flush up against him.
“I love you,” Cas says, stirring beside him and knowing exactly what he’s asking. He leans over and presses him back onto the bed behind him. “You are the best person I will ever know.”
Cas didn’t know what to make of this gesture, but with tears trickling down his cheeks, he finally felt the full weight of emotion that he had longed to feel from the music filling the space around him and sweeping him into his memories.
Dean sits at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of whisky. The bottle sits on the table in front of him, half empty.
“And you’ve given so much. Given everything. Again and again.” Dean continues, “Cas, I never said – I should have said every day how much I wanted you here by my side. How much you mean to me.”
Dean had wished then he felt that certain. He nodded automatically in response anyway, hoisted himself up, and followed Benny forward, deeper into the forest.
Dean nods and looks over at Cas. The road stretches out straight in front of them, clear and free of other travelers.
Dean spoke aloud, but there were words he couldn’t figure out how to say. He thought them anyway.
He pulls his hand back and clears his throat. “See you found a spot.”
Dean sprints up the stairs to the door, flings it open, and pauses before rushing outside. He immediately stops short on the other side.
Cas hums his assent.
Dean calls Jody up for advice, or just to chat about how she’s doing with the girls, with work, with hunting.
He joins Cas outside one morning, like he usually does. He sits in the grass, watching the sunrise and sipping his coffee while Cas waters the flowers.
But he had to get Dean out.
“The only reason I kept putting one foot in front of another was to get to you. I didn’t get it before, but I do now. Without you, there’s no me.” He laughed, but it was humorless and hollow. “And that’s fucked, I know that, and more pressure to put on you than you deserve, but it’s the truth. It’s the
He closed his eyes, leaned his head back against the headrest, and took in each song, letting the sound wash over him.
After pulling Cas tight into his arms, Dean had cast a glance at Benny, breaking him out of his own moment. Benny’s thoughts, watching the two of them embrace, had been on Andrea, his love in a previous life. A life beyond their current harsh, gray eternity.
, he thought, and swallowed the prayer down, his last thought before he had let go completely, shuddering as he came into Benny’s hand.
“Dean,” he says after an uncomfortably long silence. “Did you need –” He stops himself short, frown forming. “I want to go make some tea.”
The memories taunt and haunt Dean, cruel reminders of the only real subject of his supplications: Cas.
The Shadow could never have predicted that with those memories, Cas was reminded of what he wanted, who he loved, what he
The light passes over Dean’s face as he listens to the voice on the other side of the phone. The impossible voice, a deep rumble he never thought he’d hear again.
“I’m right here. I’m staying right here, Dean,” Cas murmurs, planting a kiss to Dean’s forehead, then his lips. “As long as you want.” He lays down beside Dean and draws him close, facing him, wrapping his arms around him.
“I know you are,” Benny had chuckled again, and rolled his hips against Dean teasingly. He could feel Dean twitch beneath him at the contact and groaned as he moved against him. “Want you just like this.”
“No, you know what, I really do. And I think you need it, too.” Dean continued, pushing him with his words, stepping closer into his space as he spoke.
“How did it go?” Sam asks, ignoring his brother’s typical reaction to be woken up.
Sam had said, “Dean, we have to talk - since Cas -“ and Dean had had just enough strength to pull back his fist and bring it crashing against his brother’s face.
He’s put together some things. Those pieces. The ones he’d hidden away so long no wonder they both felt like they were missing. He’s uncovered them now. Taken each one out and looked at them, put them into the sunlight, and he thinks he knows now where they belong. What the pictures shows. There’s just one way to know for sure.
“It’s in perfect tune with the spheres,” he’d shared with Dean once, reflecting on his long life spent observing humanity from afar.
Until they tore up the story and set fire to it. Now, every day is a blank page that he intends to fill.
He ended most days with a mix of pleas, curses, and often tears – more from frustration than sadness at that point. Some nights he spoke until his voice gave out, still muttering Cas’ name as he passed out from exhaustion.
“Cas, I need to say something –” Dean starts.
As Cas slides into the passenger seat of the Impala, Dean goes through their upcoming plans in his mind, an activity that’s become soothing for him: This weekend, Garth, Bess, and the kids are coming for a visit. He told Claire last time they talked on the phone that they could hunt together on the next case she finds, so he has that to look forward to, probably sometime this coming week – looking forward more to the time with Claire than the hunt itself. He owes Donna a call, having missed her call the day before, and makes a mental note to give her a call after dinner tonight.
Dean thinks.
“I thought you were lost for good,” Dean had said softly.
for once. So, please – please, Cas, I’m begging you. If I mean
“Jack needed me in heaven. Now, you need me here. I don’t know what use I can be anyway like this. I tried, but I don’t have my powers anymore” Cas lets of a heavy sigh and continues, “Tell me, Dean - how did you feel about finding out that Chuck had been writing your story, making your choices for you? Where does what I chose fit in with what everyone needs from me?”
“Dean,” Cas says quietly, breaking Dean’s concentration. His face is drawn in concern.
This kid? Pass. He had barely been able to stomach looking at Jack. Every time he talked to him, he heard the harsh, barked out orders – his father’s voice – echoing in his head.
“Um. Yeah. I, uh, found it in your coat before, uh –” Dean swallows, throat tightening, unable to say the words. “I – I kept it.”
“I love you,” Dean says aloud.
“What do you mean? Of course we wouldn’t let you just rot away in the Empty.”
With his head resting on Cas’ shoulder, he allows himself this one moment to feel everything at once: the pain of losing Cas, the relief – too small a word - of hearing his voice, and the warm comfort of holding him right here in his arms. He lets it all flood in, leaving him light-headed. Finally, he pulls back, cupping Cas’ jaw in his hand and just holds him there, eyes capturing every detail as if to memorize Cas’ face – as if Dean could ever forget it.
Cas closes the gap between them as Dean finishes his last word. Their first kiss is soft and gentle, an exhale after a long held breath.
But much like sandwiches that tasted like molecules, Castiel couldn’t get the pieces to take shape that would allow him to perceive the whole of the experience.
The second time, Dean had threatened to break Sam’s nose if he asked what happened again. He knew as the words came out that he had no right, not really - that Sam had lost a friend, too - but he couldn’t stop himself from saying it all the same.
Dean sits out on the pier, not fishing or doing anything in particular - just watching the clear water of the lake in front of him. Cas would say he’s meditating, and he would vehemently deny it, but well, Cas might have a point. Not that he’d ever admit it.
“It’s good to have you home, Cas,” Dean says.
The light hits just the right angle, blinding him for a moment, and in it, Dean sees a flash of white in his mind. His mouth goes dry and his heart races. He can’t stop the image once summoned by his memory. In the flash of light, he sees Lucifer’s blade piercing Cas’ back. He closes his eyes, tight to block out the light, and pushes the memory away.
“You thought – yes, you thought somehow,” the Shadow laughs, “that if you toed the line just close enough, that you could have the life you wanted with him.
In the dirt beside the door, Cas has finished planting the gladiolus. He wipes his hand across his forehead, streaking dirt across it. Dean makes a mental note to pick up gardening gloves for him.
“They don’t know, obviously, everything that’s happened. For them, the story ended with Sam going to hell. But they took that. They took those pieces - took our time together before then, and they
Benny’s grip was firm around his shaft. His thumb rubbed the head, teasingly, before he started to work up and down Dean’s length. Dean couldn’t resist the touch, his hips involuntarily thrusting forward into the motion of it. Benny chuckled and placed messy kisses along Dean’s jaw, tightening his grip and stroking faster as Dean thrust helplessly into Benny’s hand. It’d been so long for Dean that he was done for quickly.
Every thought, every feeling had been etched on Dean’s face, and he hadn’t been able to control it, Cas could tell just by looking at him. He had just pulled Cas tight to him and held onto him like a lifeline. The vulnerability overwhelmed Cas.
He inhales, exhales.
Cas runs his hand down Dean’s jaw, cupping it and pulling him in for another, deeper kiss.
When Sam and Eileen visit, he cooks that healthy shit Sam loves, just because it makes him smile. He and Eileen eat bacon cheeseburgers. Cas has a little bit of everything. They talk late into the night every time.
It’s an ordinary Thursday that brings Dean to his knees.
“What’s that?” Dean asks, more curious than on edge now, but keeping the grumpy tone.
“Well, come on,” he taunts the other. “Haven’t got all day.”
Jack had been trying to get passage to the Empty but hadn’t been able to find a way before Dean went through the rift to perform his spell. Now, though, his message by way of the new Death to grant him passage in the Empty has been accepted.
Perhaps, a promise.
He didn’t believe that he deserved this – having Dean’s attention, affection. But he would take it anyway. He’d take this one moment of salvation.
“No, it doesn’t,” Cas says, leaning toward Dean so their shoulders gently brush.
He had started to pull back, but Benny stilled him with one hand on his hip, and said, “This ain’t gotta mean nothin’, Dean. We’ll find your angel. That don’t mean we can’t blow off steam. Ain’t like there’s much else to do out here. It doesn’t have to mean a thing.”
The words struck Cas and he sunk down at the base of the tree, hit with the waves of longing and desperation coming from Dean.
But the kitchen is empty. The map room, empty.
“There wasn’t supposed to be an after, Dean. I made my peace. I made my choice.” Cas fixes Dean with the piercing stare he’s become so used to.
He has limited time to think about that day – their last day. About what his friend had said. About what he would have said back had he had a chance.
“You keep that up, I’m gonna –” he started to say, words choked out.
The urge is too strong to resist, even if he wanted to. Cas is right there, alive.
“Dean - I was in heaven. Jack - he made an exception. Just the one. So that I could help him.” Cas stares off, clearly recalling a memory of heaven.
When he wakes and stumbles into the kitchen in the morning, he finds a note in Cas’ handwriting, “Out – back tomorrow. - Cas”
Until one day, he found himself staring uncomprehendingly at a tape that Dean had shoved into his hand, mumbling “here,” as Cas headed out the door of the Bunker. Cas tucked it away for safekeeping in the inner pocket of his coat, feeling a thrum of pleasure as he felt it against his chest. He didn’t know what it meant – the tape or the feeling – but anything of Dean’s was to be treasured, and his heartbeat boomed at the thought of holding something close to him of Dean’s.
It’s not the apple pie life. Turns out he was right; that wasn’t meant for him. What he has is better than that. It’s a
He has a brief moment of panic, where he considers pulling back. But the previous night floods his memory and he finds himself pulling Cas closer toward him instead.
Dean felt and tasted his own blood on his lips, sticky and metallic.
Dean searches for the cause and there, on the floor where the rift had been opened just the day before, he finds Cas. Dean immediately drops to the ground beside him, searching for signs of life. Cas is breathing.
Dean had brought his other hand up to Benny’s jaw, pulling him up and turning his head so that their eyes met.
But Cas can’t answer. He opens his mouth, but no sound comes out.
“I’m not moping, Dean. I’m just getting used to being human. Again,” If Cas notices Dean flinch at the memory of the last time he was human, he doesn’t acknowledge it, “And being pulled here - I just didn’t think I’d ever be back on earth again. And certainly not like this.” Cas, still holding his cup of coffee, takes the seat across from Dean.
Cas was mesmerized at the action. He watched, lips parting slightly in awe, and moved his hand so that he could run the pad of his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip. Dean brought his hand up to Cas’ and pressed a soft kiss to Cas’ thumb. Then, eyes still on Cas’, he dragged his tongue along the length of it. Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean, to which Dean responded by taking Cas’ thumb into his mouth, lips taut and tongue working the length of it. Dean’s hand guided two more fingers into his mouth. Cas’ eyes closed and he groaned again.
“Sergei wasn’t the only collector,” Rowena explains when she arrives at the bunker, holding up the shimmering vial of archangel grace. “But there isn’t very much here. And I truly don’t know of more when this is gone. You’ll have four, maybe five hours to do the spell and get yourself back through the rift. That should do the trick, but just so. You’ll have to be quick. And be careful.”
He’s deep in thought when Cas comes up behind and gently places a hand on his shoulder, pulling his attention to the warm weight.
“You don’t have to –“ Cas starts, but Dean looks at him with pleading eyes and he stops. They’re standing close enough to touch. Close enough that Dean can feel how rigid Cas is holding himself, how unsure he is.
“Tell me I’m not living in that world. I - I can’t. I just can’t.”
Dean smells peanut butter and looks up to see Sam spreading it onto the bread in front of him. Dean feels queasy at the smell and sight, thinking of just days ago when he made himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - Cas’ favorite - because he needed something, anything, to feel close to him.
Cas looked at Dean with that piercing blue gaze. He knew they were both remembering a memory echoing from the past:
Six months after –
With a nod from Sam, Dean resumes.
“Well, if it isn’t Benny’s pet,” the vampire snarls at Dean, approaching him from his right side. He clocks another to his left. They’d come up to him while he was still disoriented from the effects of the first half of the spell. He barely had time to get to his feet as they approached.
Before Dean had gone through the rift, Rowena had walked him through the spellwork he would need to do. It required two actions to be performed, and then the incantation. “An offering,” Rowena had said, “and an act of atonement. After that, recite the incantation to seal the spell.”
“That’s not –” Dean rubs his chin with his hand, frustration building with himself for getting it out all wrong. “That’s not what I meant. I –”
It’s just that Dean never allowed himself to go there in his mind. Cas was gone, but he’d get him back. He always got him back. Had to get him back.
And for years, he felt that ebb and flow of ache and relief, thinking that was all there was to it.
“It’s a place, aye? But not necessarily a garden in the strictest sense of the word. And it needn’t be a holy place, like the Occultum. It needs only be a place that’s significant to the connection between the living person casting the spell and the loved one that they wish to reach. Can you not think of anything that fits that description?”
He secured the weapon and moved closer to Dean. Dean tensed up at the proximity, their first outside of fighting together and huddling close at night – back-to-back for protection. But he stayed in place, jutting his chin out and locking eyes with Benny.
“You’ve been out here for hours. I thought I’d come join you,” Cas says, taking his place beside Dean on the dock, letting his legs swing on the edge of the dock. “I’ve been - well, I’ve been monitoring the Internet - with Sam’s guidance, don’t give me that look – for any signs of Chuck.”
Cas’ door stays shut. If he comes out, he’s timed it perfectly to avoid Dean. Sam shoots worried glances at Dean when he thinks he isn’t looking but pulls a very convincingly reassuring smile when he catches his eye.
At some point during the night, he passes out from exhaustion.
Purgatory was where he would do his penance and he had made peace with that. He would purify himself in this wasteland. He had decided that he would stay in Purgatory.
And he drives an hour in the middle of the night to pick up Claire and Kaia, when they have a few too many drinks after celebrating a successful hunt, and he’s the closest person they know – and the person they most trust to help them, but not give them too hard of time about it. He settles them down on the couch and leaves out two glasses of water and a bottle of Ibuprofen. In the morning, he’ll make something greasy and wake them up with a “One Bourbon, One Scotch, and One Beer” blasting at the highest volume his radio will go.
“No, Cas,” Dean stops him. “Please – please. Let me say it this time. I need to say it. And I need you to let me.”
So, his prayer has become the same words, repeated again and again. They are the words that he couldn’t find to say when they mattered most:
“So beautiful,” Cas mouths against him. Dean looks at him with glassy eyes, silently communicating supplication, desire.
He finishes off the second vampire, the second of Benny’s killers, and gathers their heads. He sets down his bag containing his supplies for the second part of the spellwork.
Dean glances over to the passenger side where Cas is slumped against the window, sound asleep.
It is singularly focused on one point of light: Cas.
“Dean-“
Dean leans his head back against the wall and lets out of a shuddering breath.
he thinks.
He doesn’t hear Cas come into the kitchen, but feels him move into place behind him, head just above his shoulder. He just barely brushes against Dean to look at the photo, but all of Dean’s attention moves instantly to that point of connection between them.
“Maybe the boss will let you take a break in a little bit,” Cas says, before pulling Dean in for another kiss.
Dean swallowed roughly and nodded. Then he closed the gap between his lips and Cas’. He brought his hand up to the back of Cas’ head, pulling him in. Gently, parted Cas’ lips with his tongue, deepening the kiss. He bit down lightly on Cas’ bottom lip, dragging his teeth across it, then sucking on it. Cas let out a moan and tightened his hand on Dean’s jaw.
When the anniversary of Cas’ return from the Empty comes up, even though it’s painful for Dean, too, he takes special care of Cas. He holds him tight through the nightmares and kisses him softly to bring him back to the waking world. He makes sure that Cas knows that there’s nothing in the dark they can’t fight together.
The first thing Cas does when they arrive is mumble “shower” and slouch into the bunker. At least he can walk on his own.
He nods to himself, weighing whether to follow after Cas. He doesn’t.
Dean swallows and tries again.
Cas slowly pulled his fingers from Dean’s mouth, rubbing his thumb across Dean’s bottom lips again, shiny with saliva.
Back at the bunker, everyone is tense and exhausted. Cas is back, but now Jack is gone. There’s always another fucking shoe waiting to drop.
“How’re you feeling?” Sam asks, as he starts pulling food out of the cabinet. He waits, so damn patient, while Dean ignore his question.
“I think I understand what work Jack said I needed to do. I think I needed – time. This garden. Knowing I could stay here, with you, no matter what,” he says, the last words coming out more hesitant than the first.
“It wasn’t your fault, Dean.”
He had paused only to say, “Supplies are in the map room.” With that, he turned around and walked out.
“You saved me more than once. You saved Cas. And I failed you.”
“Don’t –
It’s Dean’s turn to frown. “Why would –” he starts, before pausing to tamp down his frustration at himself, that Cas would even feel the need to ask. “This is your h-” he tries again, but the words won’t make it out.
“What?”
He tries to ignore the way he climbs out of bed easier. The way he rushes through his shower and walks just a bit more quickly down the hall than he has in too long.
Dean pulls a photo from his wallet and sets it on the table in front of him. He takes another swig of beer and taps on the table, lost in thought.
Dean let out a groan as he came, shuddering against Benny before stilling, spent, Benny’s hands still holding him in place with his hands above his head. Benny pressed kisses to Dean’s neck. Dean shivered, extra sensitive in the wake of his climax.
“It is nice. That people find comfort in our story. Even without knowing it, living it, like we have.”
“You’re out of breath,” Cas looks up at him, frowning again.
It’s early and he’s stocking the bar. The repetitive action of the daily opening tasks is soothing to him. He’s so engrossed in it that he doesn’t hear Cas come up behind him. Cas, knowing how being startled affects Dean, clears his throat to let him know he’s there.
Dean nodded and felt the ghost of a smile cross his lips, but it was gone just as quickly. Still, he felt calmer than he had in a long time.
His thoughts are interrupted by the opening of the door. Dean stares at Cas in the doorframe, trying to will the door back shut and the time back just a few minutes into the past – just long enough to make his escape.
“There are fairytale retellings, and alternate universes where I garden much more skillfully than I have so far in our yard here –“
The only real quiet moments were in the middle of a kill or afterwards, when Benny would take his time looking him over – part care, part predator evaluating his prey, Dean had thought. Either way, Dean hadn’t much minded it. Even come to expect it – it had become their ritual.
Dean has fought and killed gods. All but destroyed the God. He was raised from the pits of Hell to serve as a vessel of Heaven. Surrounded by the profane and the holy his whole life, he found faith in Cas. And from that, he was able to begin to believe in himself.
“I love you. And I’m sorry I didn’t say it before. I didn’t allow myself to even think it for so long – not until Lucifer killed you. But I didn’t think you felt the same – could feel the same. And then you told me, and I didn’t know how to say it then. And then you were gone,” Dean’s voice is rough, and his throat tightens. “You changed me, too. I think you know that. You don’t put up with my crap. You see through it all and you call me on it. You’re the bravest person I know. I’ve never believed in anything – anyone – the way I believe in you. You say you cared about the world because of me. I had faith because of you. I had faith in the world, in us, in everything we’ve done, because of you.”
The second time they had gone to Purgatory, Dean had dropped to his knees, choking on his words, “I hope you can hear me, man.”
Cas exhales raggedly, reaches up to pull Dean forward so their chests are flush against each other, hands in his hair, pulling him closer. He searches Dean’s face for any hesitation, finds none.
Calling it prayer had become a bit of a stretch at that point. He sent streams of consciousness desperately out into the vast, grim forest every time he thought of the angel, which was near-constant. His only break was when fighting for his life or collapsed and unconscious, for brief moments, from fatigue.
, with this spell – a summoning ritual – it’s our best chance to bring back the handsome angel.”
Kelly Kline comes to him and tells him how he failed her. How he failed Jack. “I trusted you, Castiel,” she says. “Jack – Jack trusted you like a father.”
“You seem to have done alright with Benny,” Cas said, fixing Dean with a level gaze.
He’d taken it.
“Dean, I’m trying,” Sam started, gesturing to the spellbook in front of him. “But understanding the circumstances might help lead me to the right spell -“
“Sorry,” Dean says, “I couldn’t sleep – too much energy, and too much to do today. Believe me, I’d rather be still in bed with you.”
“I prayed myself hoarse, man,” Dean continued.
Still, no matter how many times he washed in the river, he never felt the stain wash off. He closed his eyes and saw blood, charred wings, and thick black slime that overwhelmed him. What punishment was more fitting for his sins than this feeling? For what he had done to Sam. What he had tried to do to the world. Had done to Heaven. The way he had betrayed Dean’s trust. Those were acts that could not be forgotten, forgiven. They would not wash off.
Cas isn’t sure there is a strong enough word for what it means to him, knowing that Dean had wanted to pick a place of comfort for him, and “nice” barely captures a fraction of the feeling. He doesn’t have the words to help Dean understand what it felt like waking up there in the meadow.
“Did he – he came back. He was quiet, but it was Cas.” Sam says the words like facts, but the question is implied.
“I know that, too,” Cas looked down as he replied, “I meant it when I said I heard every word, Dean. But the thought of bringing more harm your way? I had to –”
After Dean had cut off contact, Benny was more lost than he could remember being. He’d gone into it all with eyes open, but it still hurt when it came to an end. He had let himself get used to having a partner, having each other's back in Purgatory and then he was truly on his own again.
Dean looks up at him in a daze and the only thing he can focus on is the sight of Cas and the beautiful words coming out of his mouth. He’s overwhelmed by emotion and struggles to breathe.
he said.
Dean had felt an immediate and dizzying headrush but threaded his hand in Benny’s hair and pressed him down, holding him in place as he drank from him.
At least, it’s ordinary until every light in the library sparks out, glass flying. Dean covers his face with his arm in protection. The red back up lights come on, the power for the whole bunker having been tripped.
“You annoyed a cosmic being into letting you go, man?” Dean says, sipping his coffee. Jack had caught them a case in Dodge City, and despite having been startled awake, Dean will be ready to get moving as soon as he’s fully caffeinated. Cas is uncomfortably aware of how motivating the prospect of interacting with local cowboys may be in speeding up the morning routine.
There in the shadows of night, surrounded by the ever-present threat of danger, Dean found that he could say all of the things he wanted. The things he’d never allowed himself to even think about wanting before. There was no deep examination of what it all meant; like the constant thrumming of action in the place, the words would come unbidden, and Dean sent them immediately to the sky.
“Huh?” Dean asks, confusion taking the place of his faux-bad mood.
“Understand this – he died to save me. It’s my fault he’s gone,” Dean had said.
If they make a few stops along the way, well, that’s their story to tell.
Sam nods once at Dean’s outburst. It’s not like he’s not used to them.
The whole time Cas was in Purgatory, he had meditated. He reflected. While Purgatory was a place of instinct and openness for Dean, for Cas, it was a place of repentance. He had sat there quietly by the river, as often as he could manage while on the run. He simply observed the way the water flowed over the stones, and thought about how, over time, the stones were changed almost completely by the water – smoothed over and made anew. He wished for that for himself.
Dean gasps as the memories flood back through him and collapses onto the dirt.
“You sure do like being manhandled, huh?” Benny chuckled.
It being Cas, shut up in his room for weeks, until Dean finally snapped. Snapped and brought home a flower. The one he is gripping tight in his hands as he stands outside of Cas’ room.
“You’re real,” Dean says. He repeats, reassuring himself, “You’re real.”
Cas looks lost in his own thoughts, and Dean doesn’t have to guess where. “The kid,” he murmurs, trying to inject his own voice with that reassurance that Cas always gives to him, trying to return the favor. “We’ll find him.”
“I do, though,” he replies, insistent - urgent. “Because I
“I didn’t know. I didn’t know you
He hadn’t been able to finish the thought. Hadn’t been able to voice the fear that Cas could be alive and have chosen to leave him. Chosen to stay away after weeks. Weeks of endless fighting and running. Weeks of ceaseless prayers.
Cas thought.
In the Empty, Cas sees echoes in the nothing around him. He knows that they are the Shadow’s doing, but that doesn’t make them any less painful, because they were once real: the hurt look on Dean’s face when he learned of his betrayal, that he was working with Crowley. The fear in his eyes as he tells him to bow down and profess his love to him, the new God. The devastation at what he does to Sam’s mind.
The full smile he’s rewarded with leaves him feeling triumphant.
“But what does that –“ Sam breaks his silence, but Dean cuts him off.
And he knows now what he needs to say to him.
“I heard you callin’ his name at night,” Benny responded simply, but Dean’s hand had come up to grasp at Benny’s hair and pulled him forward into a rough kiss, effectively shutting him up.
When Sam relays this to Dean, his brother is quiet. He has the same empty lack-of-expression on his face that has been in place for months. It’s as if all of the light has been tamped out from inside of him, and all that’s left are the crumbling ruins of an abandoned temple; that he’s still standing is nothing but a tribute to Cas.
He had rolled over in the grass beneath him and pushed himself up. The warmth of the sun was a stark contrast to the cold, dark Empty. In a daze, he brought his hands down to his coat, pulling it out in front of him as he looked down at himself in disbelief.
Dean stares at him, unable to keep the awe from his face. Cas stands there, haloed by the blue-ish glow of the phone booth behind him.
Cas closed his eyes, trying to fight the emotions battling their way to the surface. How could he say no to Dean telling him he needed him. Openly begging him - showing a vulnerability that he so rarely allowed anyone to see. But a small part of him had hurt, still, at being a need to Dean and not a want. He pushed that aside. He opened his eyes again, and he simply said, “Okay, Dean.”
Dean expects him to move away, the quick comfort withdrawn as fast as it is given. It’s how this usually goes.
“Just try the damn thing on. Indulge me,” Dean tells him, smiling despite the sternness of his tone.
With a sudden motion, Cas reaches over to touch Dean’s shoulder.
he thinks. He was meant to die young and bloody and that was that. That was always the way the story was written for him and he had made his peace with it.
Cas is looking at him in that soft, fond way – the look that Dean would give anything to keep seeing. Even talk about that damn Supernatural. But Cas isn’t finished.
Dean hadn’t wanted to be mother, father, protector, whole world to another kid. Hell, he hadn’t
Real.
But then the Shadow-as-Naomi shows him memories he doesn’t recall. Tells him that he can have these stolen memories back, but they’ll come with a price.
And then there are the memories that were stolen. Cas doesn’t have time to process what they mean. Recontextualize the last seven years. The Shadow wouldn’t let him even if he tried.
He was certain he hadn’t fully understood the meaning of being grateful before waking up in that meadow, surrounded by blackberries and wildflowers. The soothing sounds of a nearby brook, a light breeze, and songbirds had been the only thing breaking the silence around him as he stood still in the light, giving thanks.
Not breaking the kiss, Benny had grabbed both of Dean’s hands and pushed them up above his head against the tree. Dean’s hips pressed forward, and he let out a strangled noise.
But then he saw Dean break through to him. Dean had barely fought him, just begged him to stop. He told him he knew this wasn’t him.
This was the moment Cas realized that he was going to win The Shadow’s game.
The third time - the last time - Sam had found Dean passed out, face down on the kitchen floor. Bottles, more than he cared to count, littered the space around him. The sleeve of Dean’s flannel shirt and the floor beneath his arm was caked with vomit.
Sam tilts his head at Dean as if considering what to say, then slowly, as if choosing his words carefully, says, “Yeah. Like I said, he didn’t say much. But he ate. Went back to his room. Dean, is everything okay?”
He stands up and moves closer to Cas. He reaches out a hand to Cas’ face, cradling his cheek gently. “Cas – thank you.” He feels happy, relieved, to get even those few words out.
Cas hums noncommittally under Dean’s gaze.
Cas stares at him, taking in the change in his posture, his lack of response, the flush –
“How did – how –” Dean stumbles for words, at a loss at the sight in front of him. “I thought your grace – your wings –”
Dean had run a shaking hand through his hair, swallowed, and continued.
Cas takes Dean’s hand and leads him down the hall to his bedroom. Dean’s mind is blank– empty of any thought other than Cas.
They had been comfortably silent as they cleaned up in the nearby stream. Dean thought to himself then:
“But that would be impossible for us to get to again. Even with God – Jack’s help. There must be another –” he says hurriedly.
Dean pulled back, smiling slightly at Cas’ groan from the loss of contact, and, green eyes locked on blue the whole time, he sank down to his knees in front of Cas.
Once topside, though, Benny had known early on that he was wrong to leave Purgatory. That he had been dreaming of a life that didn’t exist anymore. There was too much here on earth: choices, noises, regrets, desires.
There’s a thing about the stories that people tell themselves. Sometimes stories rewrite themselves. Either out of self-preservation or outside interference, some memories can’t be trusted, or even cease to be.
What that meant, Dean wasn’t sure. Rowena hadn’t been able to offer him much guidance either. She could only say that the actions should be related to the place and that the magic would decide their worth.
The Empty isn’t nothingness. It’s everything: every regret, every mistake, every single moment of despair. The Shadow taunts Cas ceaselessly with them, a litany of desolation and shame.
Here, in the sanctuary of Cas’ embrace, Dean can be as vulnerable as he needs -
“Okay. Okay,” he says, grounding himself.
Dean nods, trying to catch up.
“Don’t you have better things to do with that mouth of yours than run it?” Dean said, not bothering to deny it, but bearing his neck to Benny.
In one, he saw himself: Dean was kneeling at his feet, pleading with him. He saw his fist slam down again and again, unable to stop it – then and in that moment. Dean’s face, bruised and bloodied at his hands.
Replacing that voice with his own takes time and more effort than he wants to put forth most days, but he’s found that, like everything in life, it gets easier with practice. His own voice gets stronger the more he uses it, and he likes how that feels. Even easier is letting the voices of his loved ones drown it out, giving the weight due to their words to let them smother the ghost of John’s. The combination of both efforts gives him hope that one day he’ll wake up and the haunting will be over. Even if that day never comes, he knows now how to fend off the lies and hurt.
And over time, the little voice in his head fades to a whisper. Not his own, but his dad’s –
“And it’s some random vampire,” Dean says lightly, though he tenses at his friend’s name.
Cas understood. Purification was what he longed for, to atone for all he had done.
Some were said only in his mind, others voiced aloud for whomever, whatever, to hear. He was beyond caring what else might come for him. Not if it meant his words might reach Cas.
Dean grunts, annoyance prominent on his face. He ducks his head, clearly trying to hide the red-heat rising on his cheeks, but Cas sees it anyway.
Letting go of Cas’ hand, Dean reached out to undo the drawstring on Cas’ pants. Cas’ eyes shot open and breath hitched as Dean removed his length and took it into his hand, gently rubbing over the head of his cock, already leaking precome. Then he worked his hand up and down, firm and sure.
Expression still neutral, Cas hadn’t been able to help but lean into the touch. His eyes softened and he gave Dean a pleading look. For what, he wasn’t sure he could articulate if he tried.
By evening, despite the pleasure and relief, the events of the day had come to feel like some kind of transgression against the memory of – the belief in – Cas. Dean could think two words to pray that night:
In that moment, he’d said:
Cas clears his throat. He’s staring back at Dean, head tilted slightly.
The bruise on his brother’s left cheek was an ugly, mottled purple. Dean had put that there without a thought. No - with one thought making its way through his still-drunken mind: I can’t think about losing him or I’ll give up. But he couldn’t say that, so he’d thrown the punch instead.
Benny had let out a strangled noise and nodded once. He brought his hand up, running his fingers lightly across the length of Dean’s throat. He leaned down again and pressed his lips down on the pulse point. He was as gentle as he could be as he sunk his fangs into the flesh below.
But Dean shook his head, “Not need. Not like that, I mean. Want – Cas – I want –” he started, but words failed him again. He swallowed. “You. I want you.” Another swallow, eyes closed. “I want to show you how much I want you.”
Then, he kneels down and begins to pray aloud.
Dean waits in silence. The air around him is full of sparks that drift off in the breeze.
he thinks.
Sam is used to Dean’s silence at this point, disturbing to him as it is. But Sam doesn’t know that there isn’t room in Dean’s mind for any words for him to speak. His mind is too focused on the ones echoing:
When Benny had found a gash from the fight on Dean’s arm, he brought it up to his mouth, pressing his lips against it, eyes up on Dean’s as he had licked away the blood, sucking gently. The pressure had hurt, but good, and Dean brought his hand up to Benny’s head, fingers tangled in his hair, holding him in place. Benny had groaned into it then, winked up at Dean, and kept going.
Mostly-human. He didn’t ask Sam for any details. This spell - it will bring him back? and Yes, but Dean - was enough for him.
“Dean, you already-“ Cas starts, but he’s cut off.
“Yeah, no – I’m –” Dean backs up and lets Cas pass by, close but not touching. They haven’t touched since Cas – since. Dean pushes that thought aside.
“When you ran off – Cas, you took everything with you. My hope, my – you have no idea. You really don’t – do you?” Dean said, letting out a frustrated noise.
The longer he was back on earth, the more he wanted the simplicity back. He would rather an eternity of the present moment than constant difficulty in making peace with the past and doubting the right path for the future. He had known the paths in Purgatory well. They were always the same.
He uses them to steady himself when he stumbles back to bed – that is, on the nights when he makes it that far – after having too much to drink again.
“I - we need you, man,” Dean says, turning back to face Cas, “Don’t you get that?”
Cas nods, eyes opening at Dean’s pleading voice.
feel the same.” Dean runs his hand through his hair in frustration. “That sounds stupid now. I know that. I get so wrapped up in myself and - and I’m sorry, Cas. I’m just so sorry. I didn’t see – didn’t fully appreciate – everything you did. Not until it was too late. I never do. And then I never say anything when you come back. If you knew -”
“Doesn’t sound much like heaven to me,” Dean grumbles.
“Of course I do,” Cas replies without any hesitation.
Dean wakes up when it’s dark, still clutching the jacket, and stumbles into his bed.
“Enclosed garden, taken quite literally, that is” she says. “And in the
Stricken, Dean’s immediate thought was that the spell had gone wrong. That he’d brought back Cas’ body only. (He wouldn’t call it his vessel - it hadn’t been a vessel in years – he was wholly Cas.)
Some stories can take what feels like an eternity to get to their ultimate revelation.
make this about Benny. Benny’s the reason I’m standing in front of you, man. Without him I’d be dead. I felt dead already, but he kept me moving. To get to you.”
He doesn’t know what he expected, but minutes tick by and the nothing that comes after breaks him open. He lets out a dry, heaving sob.
Going is a risk – Jack has limited power there – but he wants this settled. For good.
The vampire lunges at him.
Dean had caught up with Sam in the hall - this spell - it will bring him back? - and once Sam had talked him through it, Dean hadn’t waited around to chat more. To think more. He’d just acted.
Dean had to just stand and breathe for a moment. But then his hands had moved to undo Benny’s belt. Using spit and the precome already dripping from the tip, Dean took Benny’s cock in his hand and started the steady rhythm that he’d come to know Benny liked. Benny’s hips thrust forward, fucking into Dean’s hand. Benny was pressing kisses and bites in turn, rougher than before, along Dean’s neck.
The Shadow is restless, angry at being thwarted again.
Cas swallows at the order. And the smile. He pushes aside the thought that there is nothing he wouldn’t indulge Dean in, if only he would ask.
Finally, after what had felt like an agonizingly long time, Benny pulled back. In a swift motion, he had pressed Dean’s back against the nearby tree. He kissed him roughly and Dean had tasted the metallic tang of his own blood in his mouth.
When Claire, Kaia, and Jack head out the door after a visit, he presses kisses to their heads, saying, “You kiddos take care of yourselves.” They text him when they get to their destination, just like he asks them to, and he sends a thumbs up emoji, Cas’ love of the little icons having rubbed off just the tiniest bit.
“Wouldn’t be offering if I didn’t want you to,” Dean said softly.
“Heard you got out with that bastard,” it taunts. “Couldn’t stay away?”
It’s not Jack’s fault, but even now - every glimpse of him pulls Dean back to the moment he was falling to his knees, kneeling beside Cas for who knows how long, taking in every feature of his face with the knowledge that these were his last moments to ever see it again. Nothing more important than the man laid out in front of him.
He looks like hell.
Dean isn’t in the mood to share, but with a cringing glance at the fading bruise on Sam’s face and a knot of shame tangling in his stomach, he lets go of his brother’s arm and forces himself to say, “It worked.”
Back in his room, he picks up his cassette player and headphones, hits play, lays the jacket on the side of his loveseat, and lies down with his face pressed into the jacket.
When Eileen lays a hand gently on Dean’s back at the end of the night and half-smiles at him reassuringly, he wants to scream. He’s not quite sure why, so instead, he forces a half-smile in return.
In those moments, he’s struck by how sharp happiness can be. He smiles so hard that his face hurts, and he doesn’t try to shut it down anymore out of fear that feeling it means he will lose it. His chest feels tight and his throat dry, but he breathes through it. Tears threaten to, and sometimes do, spill, and he’s grateful to have so many people to care about as much as he does that he can’t keep the feeling from spilling over. He realizes how lucky he is. He would take any discomfort to never lose this feeling now that he’s found it.
“Just go on and do it. I know you want to,” Dean had said, tilting his head up, bearing his neck to Benny again in submission. “And don’t tell me you haven’t been thinking about it.”
He wakes with them on his tongue. Sleeps with them tormenting his dreams.
“The fans. Their writing. I read a few,” Cas says, eyes bright with amusement.
Dean doesn’t say a word.
“Cas,” Benny heard Dean start, voice just above a whisper. “I don’t know if you can hear me. I should probably give up at this point, but you know I won’t. I won’t. Not if there’s a chance that you’re still out there. If you can hear me, know that I’m not leaving here without you. I’m going to find you and bring you home.”
” as he came, sparks shooting behind his eyes. He ran his hands instinctively through Dean’s hair. Dean’s lips stayed around the length of him, taking down his release, eyes cast upwards to watch Cas the entire time. Dean had thought that was the most angelic he’d ever looked.
to do that for Sam. But there was no other choice at the time - and so Dean had done it, and would do it again, when it came to Sammy.
“I’m sorry, dear,” Rowena says as gently as she can, placing her hand on Dean’s. “The blood – the spellwork that Nick tried to do. The blood – it has to be fresh. Maybe, if we had tried right away, but –” She lets the thought drop off at the pained look on Dean’s face.
he thinks,
– voice: Telling him not to trust others. Telling him to be a man. Telling him in words and actions that whatever he does, he’ll never be enough.
Castiel had quite enjoyed the lyrical quality of the poetry that the Neanderthals had produced.
“Well, it was a stupid choice.” Dean knows he sounds childish but can’t help the bitter words from coming out.
He might not have allowed himself to think about losing Cas, but he made sure the visual reminder stayed in place, a shrine to his loss. He looked at every morning, looked at it every night. It would stay there until Cas was back for good. And then he could put it away.
Benny captured Dean’s bottom lip, then, biting gently and sucking it into his own mouth. Dean let out an involuntary moan that brought him back to reality.
Dean had known that his memory of losing Cas once in Purgatory had been wrong – Cas had shown him that a long time ago. Cas had helped Dean remember.
And the Shadow comes to him in different forms. Acting out scenes that could have – maybe even should have – been: He sees Sam, mind splitting with the breaking of the wall between him and Lucifer. He’s in so much pain that he can only manage a single word: “Why?”
Dean’s eyes closed at the contact and he let out a shuddering breath. “Cas?” he asked.
Benny kept watch, back to Dean, while Dean talked to the sky – to Cas.
His brother had shaken him awake, shouting his name, and pulled him up as he came to.
“Dean, if anything happens to you, I –” Cas started, brows furrowed, but Dean cut him off.
The spinning in his head is much less cinematic that any movie scene and he would never make that comparison anyway. Watching chick flicks is one thing – comparing his life to one would be too far.
angel –” Dean had started to protest.
“Made me come in my pants like a damn teenager,” Dean had muttered.
Cas can’t hear him this time, the last traces of his angelic grace are all but gone, but he knows what Dean is praying all the same. He answers it with another kiss and holds Dean tighter to him.
After everything he’d done? He had to make up for it somehow. He would make up for it. But that meant keeping his distance from Dean. Keeping him safe. That was all that mattered.
Cas swallows, brings himself to back to the present. He’s in a motel. It’s daytime and The Shadow has no domain here. He’s safe. He’s with Dean.
The sound of his name from Cas’ lips - a sound that he had been certain he would never hear again - is enough to make him want to slam the brakes of the car and pull over to the grassy shoulder. He knows that if he did, he would have Cas in his arms in a second, making sure that he is tangible and living and here.
As for everything else? Buried away in the old memory box.
“If you don’t know by now that you’re forgiven for everything – that I will always forgive you – I don’t know what to tell you. But if you’ll let me,” Dean said, shifting beneath Cas’ arm, eyes searching to catch Cas’ gaze, “I could try to show you.”
“Dean, it’s okay. I heard –” Cas begins to respond.
Benny shot him a cocky smile and eased Dean’s hands down, placing his own hands on either side of Dean’s hips, supporting him.
He searched Cas’ face for any hesitation, but Cas simply removed his arm from Dean’s chest, ignoring the voice in the back of his mind telling him he was unworthy of this, whatever this was – taking it despite it, and gently cupped Dean’s face, fingers tracing gently along his jaw.
Cas a flower – becomes a bigger deal in his mind with each step he takes.
Cas’ face turns a lovely pink, but he continues, “And so many of them are just us, happy. Free from fighting. Free to be together.”
One night, Dean had told Cas that he felt like Purgatory was the one real place he’d ever been. That it felt pure to him. It had been late in the day, after fending off yet another attack, and they were going through the ritual of washing off, as best they could, in the cool water of the river.
Dean had shuddered against him, letting out a strained moan, and pressed his hips forward, seeking even more friction against Benny, finding the right positioning and rhythm to their movements.
He’d simply said, “Cas has been helping me. But he has work to do here now,” and left them to it.
What he does have is an idea, or the fledgling of one. An offering that’s revealed itself in this place. An atonement he knows he owes.
“They didn’t seem much like the men from the movie,” Cas observes, as they walk back to the car after talking to the local law enforcement.
should have turned my back on you. And I damn sure should have brought you back topside after you saved Sam.”
He had thought he understood how Dean felt about the angel from seeing how he dealt with his loss, but nothing compared to the look of sheer love and wretched devotion that washed over Dean’s face the moment they had found Cas, crouched there by the stream.
But some are beyond anything he could have imagined. Part of him wants to believe the Shadow has sent fake memories. But another part of him, a quiet but firm intuition, says that these are real. And that they could change everything.
Dean let himself get lost in the sensations: Benny’s stubble against his chin, the heaviness of his hands against his hips, pulling him closer, and the hard length of Benny pressing against his thigh. He closed his eyes as Benny’s hand moved toward his belt.
Some of the memories are small. He would never have known to miss them. Little things that he said or did in the moments Naomi would pull him up to Heaven to report out.
But Cas’ hand stays in place this time, warm and solid.
Dean realizes this touch may be the most aware he has ever been of his hand or anyone else’s.
Sam pauses, looking like he has more to say, but shakes his head and leaves the room, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts.
“Most of them are just –” Cas stops and turns to face Dean, with an utterly earnest look. “Most of them are about our love. Thousands upon thousands of stories about our love.”
Cas inhales deeply. He’s bracing himself, but for what, Dean isn’t sure.
Sam is quiet, understanding that Dean doesn’t mean just a moment ago. He waits for him to continue.
Cas hadn’t been used to seeing Dean so unguarded and open. It had been as if Dean felt safer to be himself in Purgatory than he ever was on earth. There was no hesitation in his actions and the place left little time to get caught up in overthinking.
He swallows it down and grits his teeth. Sam keeps asking the same damn question over and over. Cas is back. Can’t he just leave it alone?
Later that week, she calls Sam with an idea. Rowena explains to him that the spell, while fairly simple, would need to be cast in a specific place – a
He looks like
“The garden is coming along nice, Cas,” Dean murmurs, softly.
“Not wasted,” Cas stops him. “Not a single moment of time with you has ever been wasted.”
Dean throws it across the room with force, watching as it smashes into the wall, pieces of plastic scattering on the floor.
“Over one hundred thousand stories of our love out there, and this,” Cas leans in to kiss Dean, softly, but with intent, “is the best one.” Another kiss. “Because it’s real.” And another. “And it’s ours.”
“Dean, I know. You didn’t know,” Cas says softly, but firmly.
Cas heard Dean’s silent prayer:
The rest of the night is a blur. Dean doesn’t remember the drive back to the bunker, but the sound of their footsteps echoing in the garage serves as evidence that they arrived safely.
And the kid – he had done this. All that power, the universe at his will – and he had used that power to bring Cas back.
– and that was stronger than any hatred, doubt, or fear.
“Oh yes,” the Shadow says, “you see now. I saw more than you knew the first time you came to visit. More than you could know.
,” Cas said, with an edge of warning to his voice. “You really don’t want to see that side of me right now.”
Dean moved toward him, lifting his hand up to cradle Cas’ face, his thumb stoking against Cas’ cheek.
It wasn’t until after he tried to return the tape and received the reaction from Dean that he had that it occurred to him to even try to listen to it. Its physical presence had been enough to make his heart swell and soar. When he popped the tape into his truck’s tape deck and pressed play, he was transported back to those days past on the road with Dean, where that first flutter of a note had flourished within him.
And some stories – some stories take faith.
“You did.” Dean might be more interested now that he knows the subject matter, but that’s not something he plans on admitting either.
Dean closes his eyes to keep the tears welling up from falling, his mouth forming a grim line. He nods once.
He then pulls back and pushes himself up, sticking out his hand to pull Dean up, and doesn’t let go, leading him up the pier and the path to the house, inside, and to their bedroom.
Cas snapped, shoving Dean against the tree beside him, knocking the wind out of him.
The problem now is that Dean knows it’s too late. He knows what happens when angels die. He knows that his words have no power in the Empty. He knows even
Dean swings back and forth between frustrated and confused, and hurt and confused.
It wasn’t something Dean had given much thought. But he had eyes, and he’d seen the way Benny’s would flick down when they talked. And in the moment, being taken over completely sounded like paradise. Dean knew that there would be the possibility that Benny could himself lose control, could drink too much from him; there was nothing Dean could do in the moment to stop him. But to give up control was the best kind of release for Dean and this was giving the ultimate control, and he wanted to surrender to it completely.
he thinks.
Still on the ground, head pounding, unable to process the flood of memories that he received, he does the only thing he can think to do: he prays.
Dean flushes from the contact and the praise – he’s not sure from which more, and he isn’t going to examine that now. He just presses his face into Cas’ neck and breathes, taking in the warmth of being held, being loved, like this. This - this he can have. The thought overwhelms him.
Dean’s not sure how long he stays in the kitchen. It was day and now it’s night.
“Watching everyone I know disappear – the whole world – because of me, because of the goddamn stubborn belief that Sam and I – us surviving was all that mattered.” He laughs, but it’s hollow. “It shouldn’t take a rapture to knock sense into someone, I get that.”
“Just give it some time.”
“Good to have you home,” he repeats softly.
But Cas is defiant still. While every vision pains him, he squares up against the Shadow and says, “I told you before. I’m already saved. You can keep me here and you can control what I see and hear, but you can’t control what I think. What I feel. What you do to me – it will hurt, I know that. But remember this: I summoned you. I made my choice. So, go ahead.”
It was three weeks later and they were cleaning themselves up after an attack by a particularly nasty pack of vampires. Dean had pushed himself up from the ground and started dusting off his jeans. There was no point to the action, really, other than the habit of it. His clothes were more grime than cloth at that point, but some habits die hard. He still managed to shave, using his blade. He needed the rituals.
Dean grunted and rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. All this had achieved was smearing the blood from his lip across his cheek.
Purgatory. The first place he’d first realized the impact of losing Cas. The place they’d reconciled – not so long ago, but a lifetime all the same. He’s sure of it. Surer of anything than he’s been in months.
Dean can’t think of anything he’d like less to do, but he doesn’t seem to have a choice in the matter.
He had begun to take a special kind of pleasure in watching Dean drum along on the steering wheel of the Impala as they passed the miles together, Dean’s fingers nimbly tapping out the beat of the tune. He would hum along unconsciously. Castiel watched in quiet delight as his face lit up when a certain note hit, Dean pointing at him and saying, “Just listen to this part, Cas. Nothing else like it.”
“Sometimes the fight ain’t enough,” Benny drawled, “Come on now, we can still go a ways before dark.”
“I’m sorry, man. I’m sorry, Benny.” He closes his eyes for a moment, then says his benediction: “Thank you. I just – thank you.”
Cas looks at him, face uncertain, but hopeful. “Dean, you don’t have to -”
“I didn’t kill him, you know. Chuck,” Dean says, standing up to face his friend. “I wanted to. He deserved it. If anyone deserved it, he did. But I couldn’t – I couldn’t get your words out of my head. I wanted to be the person you saw, Cas.”
“Is that -?” Cas asks, tilting his head toward the music flowing out of  the car’s speaker, as they pull off from the motel parking lot. His hand strokes the vinyl seat unconsciously, soothed by the familiarity of being back in the passenger seat and the rumble of the engine that makes the car feel almost alive beneath his hand.
He takes out his knife, slicing a deep gash into his hand. His blood drips onto the pile of ingredients below, sealing the spell. He wraps a handkerchief around his hand, chest tightening with a familiar ache as he recalls the electric spark of Cas healing him, which he had always done - even when they were fighting.
Now, though, Dean knows that putting it away was not going to be that simple. The jacket lays on the backseat of the Impala where he left it. But now that Cas is back, he can’t simply put anything away.
“Well, it is an improvement to the Walking Dead routine,” Dean quipped, shooting him a cocky smirk.
Dean thinks that Cas is enjoying this a bit too much.
- to the moment - instead.
He can’t help the grin on his face and presses another kiss to Dean’s jaw.
Cas opens his mouth, then closes it, and nods at Dean – whether in affirmation of Dean’s words or allowing him to continue, Dean isn’t sure, but he swallows and lets himself finally speak the words he’s been avoiding even thinking.
This won’t be the last of this conversation.
He smiles, brighter than Dean has seen in – possibly ever.
choosing to stay away – that he could be hurt, or worse, dead – was all-consuming.
Dean joins him outside some –
In the scenes Dean had tried not to play out in his mind of how the night would go, his friend - this guy, this angel, who loved him enough to give up his life for him - had pulled him into his arms and held him tightly, not letting go. There are other scenes that Dean had tried even harder not to think about. A few of these thoughts that he didn’t have recalled the sparks of their first meeting.
Dean had been content to follow Benny, a new habit he didn’t plan on examining too deeply.
He stares at the door. He keeps staring.
Suddenly, Cas is knocked to his hands and knees by a searing pain in his skull, sparks shooting behind his eyes. He thinks that this must just be another punishment from the Shadow, but then he hears it shrieking.
Sometimes, Benny had given him extra space. He turned away and did exactly what he promised, watched Dean’s back. Protected him so he could settle into the nightly ritual despite the ever-present danger around them.
It starts with a gladiolus plant that Dean brings back to the bunker from the grocery store. His shopping list sure doesn’t have flowers on it, but when his gut says to grab it, he does.
He doesn’t bother to look up as he hears Sam and his big, loud feet trudge into the kitchen.
“Cas, I didn’t get a chance before. I never allowed myself the chance – there’s things I want to say. Things I need you to hear.” Cas’ face softens, and his eyes don’t leave Dean’s face. Dean would usually get flustered under the intensity of his gaze, but he briefly thinks that they’re well passed that now and moves forward to close the space between them.
But he knows that’s not an option, so he offers his most treasured memories up to the sky:
The biggest change is that he hunts less. He doesn’t know how to not hunt – not completely. But the drive isn’t there in the same way it was in the past.
It had been seven weeks. Dean was keeping track of the days by starting each prayer off with a count:
it said.
The Shadow steps closer to Cas, who looks up at it from his place still on the ground. It continues, “So tell me again. Do you really think you ever mattered beyond what you could do for the Winchesters? What they
Through heavily lidded eyes and a clouded mind, Cas looked at Dean on his knees in front of him, and he thought that this was what prayer truly was.
They didn’t talk this morning either, not really. Wordlessly, Sam pushed the paper across the kitchen table to Dean.
His main job now is running a little bar outside of Lebanon. It’s not as big as The Roadhouse was, but he thinks he captured the feeling and that’s what matters. It’s a haven for his friends to stop in when they need rest, community, and comfort. It’s a way to show them love by taking care of their needs – not that he’d ever put it that directly out loud, but it’s the truth.
So, Dean kept praying to him. Every morning. Throughout the day. Into the night.
That shocks the amusement off Dean’s face. “What is it? Is he –“
On the fifth day, Eileen comes over for dinner. Dean makes burgers for everyone.
“Some are - well, quite explicit,” Cas smirks at Dean, before continuing, “Others, very dramatic - overly dramatic in my opinion. I just read one where I’m taken away from you, permanently, and you don’t search for me or try to save me at all - you just die on a routine hunt. And then you go to heaven and you’re next-door neighbors with your father.”
Dean closes the remaining space between them, their lips meeting. It’s a messy, frantic kiss at first, but they find their rhythm. They have the time now with nothing left unsaid.
Finally, he breathes out a frustrated sigh and turns away to walk to his bedroom. He tells himself that it’s okay. It’s better even. He still doesn’t know what he needs to say. He’ll sleep on it and it’ll be fine in the morning.
“You left. And before, you told me I didn’t stop you and you were right. You were right. But I couldn’t stop you this time. I would have given anything to stop you, Cas – you have to know that. And when I say I need you here, man, I don’t mean because of your powers. I mean I need you like I need air. Maybe more.”
he thinks.
And then, he continues,
With that, Benny kissed Dean roughly again, and focused on the motion of their hips meeting. He held Dean firmly in place as he thrusted against him, picking up the pace as Dean dropped his head back against the tree, close. “Benny, I’m –” he choked out, his only warning.
It being the stilted silence. It being the ever-present, but unspoken echo of final words no longer final.
He looks up at Dean, searching his face for the answer. Finding only more questions, he says the only thing he can think to say: “It’s good to hear it again.”
This bar, this work, is Dean’s way of paying tribute to the first taste of community he ever got. Hunting, especially the way his dad did it, is isolating. The Roadhouse was his first time being faced with the idea that there was a community that he could be a part of – not just a companion for a night of fun, but true company as long as he needed - wanted. A lifetime even. If he can give a fraction of that back – well, he’ll consider his job done.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, when he let out a deep sigh and popped the tape out of the deck, holding it gently in his palm, more precious to him now than it had been when it still held songs unsung. He made his way up to the quiet house, his mind playing memories on repeat.
happy. I need you here because I need
When he reached the end of the tape, the last chord fading out into the night, he sat in silence for a long time, letting his breath be the only sound to break the spell of the songs.
“No, Cas, it really is. I get you. You’ve done bad. Who hasn’t? I’m sorry – but we need you back in the game. Where’s the guy who rebelled against Heaven, took on archangels?”
Dean hadn’t been able to help it. It was more touching than he’d had, outside of killing, in longer than he could remember. Not to mention the hungry look Benny gave him as he removed his finger from his mouth. Dean was captivated, and he leaned into the touch as Benny’s hand came back up toward him, behind Dean’s head this time, pulling him forward to close the distance between them.
But Benny understood that. And, in his own way, he believed that it was for the best, if it meant that they escaped.
This cobbled together family – it’s messy, difficult, and full of laughter. It’s the truest thing he’s known in his whole life. They have each other’s backs and they hurt each other from time to time; they forgive, they try to do better, and they love each other.
“Dean, if you say that it was your fault, I swear-“ Sam cuts himself off with a frustrated shake of his head.
Dean doesn’t sleep much that night. He tosses, fighting the need to sleep and the need to get his thoughts in order. Sleep eventually wins, but his dreams are black and viscous. Empty and cold. He doesn’t need his head shrunk to tell him what that’s about.
“Dean -“
No water is running when he pokes his head into the bathroom. He walks the halls and finds that Cas’ bedroom door is shut. He can’t hear any sound of movement on the other side of the door, but he stands there for a few minutes, hand hovering near the doorknob.
Letting his thumb graze Cas’ cheek gently, he stays lost in the feeling of the warm skin and rough stubble beneath his hand.
He pauses and tries to collect his thoughts.
With eyes fixed on Cas, Dean began to move his head forward. Cas’ vision went bright white as Dean took him into his mouth, tongue moving in maddening ways, lips tight around him. His hand worked the base while he set the pace with his mouth. Cas’ hand moved to Dean’s hair, fingers tangling in it. He couldn’t control his hips from thrusting forward, fucking Dean’s mouth, chasing the tight, wet heaven. Dean’s hand moved up to his hip to help steady him, and he rubbed little circles there, but still he took Cas down deeper, humming contentedly. Cas shuddered at the vibration, the warmth, the profane sight of Dean kneeling below him.
His prayers were different than in Purgatory - both times. Then, each one was a desperate plea:
“Well, there are over one hundred thousand, so ‘a lot’ is relative.”
“Dean, do you really not understand why I need to – what I did –” Cas shook his head as he struggled to put into words the enormity of his actions.
“Damn right, I am, man! You - Jack - you could have let me - us know. Months - months, we’ve been working to bring you back. I - we’ve been -“
Cas brings his hand up to cover Dean’s, and closes his eyes, leaning into the touch. Dean inhales sharply, audible enough for Cas’ eyes to open at the sound.
Dean had shivered, and not solely because the night air was crisp.
He had been in the dark, walking for so long. It felt like an eternity.
But now he remembers now. He remembers it all.
“Heard you talkin’ to yourself last night,” Benny said by way of a good morning greeting, as Dean shifted, still waking up, and pushed himself up from the spot beneath the tree that had served as his bed the night before.
“I don’t want to lose you again,” Dean says, and his face crumples at the thought. He reaches out to cradle Cas’ face in his hands, holding his gaze instead of turning away from it.
He shook his head to clear it.
“Yeah, that’ll do,” he says finally.
“You are good,” Cas continues, punctuating each word with kisses to Dean’s chest and shoulders, “and kind,” another kiss, “and loving.” He is happy to give Dean what he needs to hear.
Cas finds release of a tension he hadn’t known he was still holding in hearing those words - the absolution he’d been seeking. Allowing himself to receive the love he’s given so freely, with no expectations, echoed back to him. Dean wants to have him. He can have Dean. Has him.
Dean hears Cas and Sam talking, but hardly registers the words they’re speaking, just barely catches the tail-end - Sam telling Cas he doesn’t know what to say.
“You know, you could have worn my spare hat I had back at the bunker,” Dean grumbles, pushing away his restless thoughts and turning his attention back to the road. He had tried to convince Cas to grab one of his hats before they left, to no success.
“You just do what you need to do,” Benny had said, one evening, with his eyes locked on the darkening distance in front of him. “I’ve got your back.”
he thinks,
. I need you here because this is your home, if you want it to be. I need you here because I – I –“ he stumbles over the word, but inhales and presses forward, forcing himself to let them be spoken, “I love you. And I need you to know that more than anything else.”
Benny’s certainty would have to be enough for the both of them.
Dean deepened the kiss, tongue pressing against Benny’s lips and he parted them, allowing Dean’s exploration.
Once they caught up with Cas, Benny was short with him, always provoking the angel. Part protectiveness of Dean, he would’ve admitted. But he had also been well aware that this thing, whatever it was he and Dean had, was nothing compared to what Dean felt for Cas.
The only thing that eased the ache was his return to the road and the reprise he found there.
Standing in a Gas N’ Sip near the crime scene, Cas squints at the misshapen straw hat that Dean has thrust into his hands.
Cas knows to keep the smile he wants to let show off of his face lest Dean think he’s mocking him.
Dean isn’t sure how long they sat there. Cas was out of it when he came to. He had blinked open his eyes slowly, as if keeping them open was a struggle, and simply rumbled, “Dean.”
“I know that,” Sam says, “I made Cas breakfast earlier this morning, after my run. But he didn’t really say much. What happened?”
. They wrote their own stories.”
“I didn’t know. I thought I remembered it all when you showed me,” Dean says, still looking stricken. “All that time, we wasted –”
“Yeah?” Dean feels himself exhaling with relief. “Yeah – yeah, you should – whatever you want, Cas.”
he continues, bitterly,
“Flower,” Dean blurts out, and immediately tries to will himself to sink through the floor. “That’s – this is –” He gestures hopelessly at the plant in his hands. “It’s for you.”
“Mm hmm,” Dean hums, not giving him the satisfaction of showing more interest.
Dean hadn’t had the words for it at first. He searched for the right way to describe what he’d seen.
“Don’t leave me again, Cas,” Dean whispers, asking for exactly what he wants. He speaks softly, lips brushing against Cas’ shoulder with each word. “You mean too much to me. To the world. You’re the reason that we won, you know. Never would have been able to with you – without what you did. For me.”
Now, back at the bunker, in the early light of the morning, Dean tries to recall if Cas had looked directly at him once since he returned.
He should have known that nothing he could offer would be worthy of Cas.
Dean makes his way back to the rift and arrives back in the bunker in a daze. He avoids Sam’s and Rowena’s pitying looks and shuts himself in his room. Laying on his bed, he thinks back to when he asked Cas to wipe Lisa and Ben’s memories and wishes someone would make that choice for him. Take all of these memories back. No matter how good a memory, they pale in comparison to the reality, and without Cas, he’d rather have the blank slate than the facsimile.
“I’m getting there. Please – Sam, just – I couldn’t do this before. I can barely say it now.”
And Dean was right: there was nothing like the thrill of excitement he had begun to feel rising inside of him when Dean caught his eye while singing softly as he drove and, with a wink, continued, raising his voice just a bit louder – almost as if he were putting on a show. In that moment, Cas began to feel something – a delicate note of understanding taking form out of the rendition.
Cas had been hesitant to return the hug. A part of him, a painful part that ached with regret, didn’t believe then that he deserved it – that comfort, that indulgence.
Dean forces himself to look at Jack – really look at him – for the first time: his awkward posture, so unsure in his body; his hopeful eyes flickering between Cas and Dean, seeking out approval; and his smile, tentative but full of joy that rivals Dean’s to have Cas back.
“Cas?”
For the second time in as many days, he allows himself this moment.
And so it went for several more weeks.
Not that Dean would ever have let anything, anyone, stop Cas from coming along.
Dean grips the wheel tighter and presses the accelerator harder. He wishes for the distraction of music to stop the swirling thoughts he’s spent months pushing aside, but he’s unwilling to risk waking the sleeping mostly-human beside him.
It’s been 401 days since Cas returned. Dean imagines he might stop counting one day. But every day he wakes up and Cas is next to him, he closes his eyes and feels grateful that they got another chance, and he adds another day to his mental count.
Dean turns slightly, swallowing as he clocks just how close Cas is to him, how he has to tilt his head up to catch Cas’ eye. The look on Cas’ face as he stares at the picture is inscrutable.
Now, his hands are sweating as he carries it inside, balancing it in one hand and the shopping bags in the other as he struggles through the door. The action –
Cas nods and is rewarded with an unabashed smile. Cas feels relief and not an insignificant amount of pleasure at the sight.
“Can you hear me? Cas - I don’t know if you’re out there,” he spoke out softly to the trees. “The only thing keeping me going is that I can’t imagine a world where you’re not.”
As he followed Benny through the forest afterwards, a word had come to mind, fleeting and unbidden, gone so quick he hadn’t been sure if he caught it – was the word devotion or desolation? But the forest had been thrumming with action and there had been no time for further thoughts. In those moments of instinct and action, a part of Dean hoped that they would never actually make it out. Because it had become the only place he fully understood.
Dean had been transfixed as Benny then loosened his own belt and took himself in hand, his come and Benny’s precome slicking the way as Benny worked himself off. He made quick work of it, groaning his own release. He stilled, one hand steading on Dean’s hip, and they had just breathed together for a moment.
The next morning, Cas’ door is open when Dean walks by. Cas is nowhere to be found – not in his room, the map room, the kitchen. Dean turns the bunker upside-down, more frantic with each room that Cas is not in. His steps quicken as he circles back to look through each one again, in case they missed each other in passing. But the bunker is – well, it’s empty.
“No. No, no, no,” he whispers, looking at his watch. But his time is up. For the second time, he’ll be leaving Purgatory without Cas. He fights back the temptation to stay here, because what difference is Purgatory from the nothingness he’s been living in?
He hears himself, quietly, asking Cas if he liked the windmill. In that moment, it’s all that matters. All other concerns fall away from him as he imagines the shock of coming back to life; he knows better than most what it feels like to be resurrected. All that matters is that Cas felt safe and at peace when he came to in the field.
He’d thought that was a spark of faith - just the smallest flicker. A new idea for him at that time in his life. But he had no idea back then what faith was. He would, though.
“When he saved me.”
He knows they spoke to Jack inside, knows it because of the painful pinch he recalls at the sight of Jack’s face. Every time he looks at the kid, he sees Cas on the ground.
