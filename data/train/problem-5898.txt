“You really are a genius,” Bucky commented with a smirk. “I think he’s ready, Stevie. What do you think?”
“I’m my own boss. Only Pepper-dictated meetings can get in my way.” Tony said, pulling out his phone to mark down the time so he’d have a reminder.
“I kind of...work until I pass out?” Tony admitted, “Oh and there’s times where I forget about my heat cycle and I just… go into heat suddenly and there is no way I’m going to do a heat walk up to my penthouse with the amount of alphas that work in my building. They do not need to know when I’m dripping wet with heat. That kind of vulnerability is only ok for close family to witness...or mate once a mate is in the picture.”
Steve shook his head. “That would simply be an added bonus if you were to join me. Of course you’re not obligated to join, I’m just giving you the offer. Plus, I could probably get your friend out of here as well.”
Tony shook his head. No, he couldn’t let himself think like that. Not after he had fought so hard to prove to Howard that he was capable of fighting in the war. Tony could handle the pressure he had basically given himself. He could fight like any alpha could.
Colonel Phillips came up beside Tony and Peggy as one agent came running at them, shouting, “Cut off one head, two more—”
“I hope he can come back home. I mean he’s from Brooklyn, but I’m not sure he really has a place to permanently call home. Both his parents are dead, and I haven’t heard him talk about any other family of his.”
Steve pulled away very quickly from the private with wide eyes and a look of horror. Of course Tony had walked in right at that moment, only to see him kissing the blonde. This was going to be hard to explain…
Long after Maria settled in Tony’s room to take care of him, there came a soft knock, Jarvis’s head popping in. “The doctor is here. Shall I let them in?”
With another Hydra base down, there were only a few left before the main base had to be discovered and taken down. Steve worked as hard as he could to locate the main base, but most of his efforts all ended with dead ends, no matter how hard he looked. He managed to always locate smaller bases and warehouses, but never any clues on the final base. It was beginning to get frustrating, but all their hard work had to lead to something eventually. Steve was determined to find information that would eventually give them a clue to the last location.
"Even though I knew I'd be with you this evening, it would have been impossible to clean my apartment before you arrived and make it look like I didn't live in filth. Besides, your place might be more comfortable for you anyways, having familiar things and all."
“In a sense, yeah, it’s different. Your enemy won’t hesitate to shoot at you even if your down on the ground.”
Maria looked sad as she entered her son’s room. “I know it’s hard not seeing him, but you only have a few more months without him.”
“As good as it could have gone,” the woman replied. “The doctors did warn Tony to try not to be so stressed, but other than that, the baby is healthy and growing at a good rate.”
“I didn’t know you were coming over here,” Steve whispered to his omega, holding Tony as close as possible.
Tony smiled, thinking of how Steve might react to holding the baby. Maybe he would cry. The omega thought that might be nice to see his alpha’s softer side, reduced to an emotional mess merely at the sight of his own baby. Damn, Tony was going to cry that day as well. He might’ve started crying if he had more time to think of that day, but his thoughts were interrupted by the car parking and Jarvis waiting to take the car into their garage.
Tony held back the new wave of tears remembering Steve’s sacrifice. “You never seemed like you wanted to save me before… you always yelled at me and wanted me to stay home, and now… I…”
“Get off me and dressed before you get slick all over my pants!” Clint said, pushing him off the rest of the way.
“I hope they won’t need Steve the whole day. I’ve got my designs to show him, which are much better than his old dancing costume. I can’t wait to burn that thing.”
In front of him was an omega he really liked, but it seemed that there was finally an omega that didn't swoon over just the sight of him, which honestly puzzled the alpha. He sat there, one leg crossed over the other and a hand rubbing his chin in thought, eyes watching the omega dance for other patrons of the strip club Steve had wandered into that night. The omega he was watching was no doubt talented and blessed by whatever deity he believed in with good looks and a strong gaze that demanded respect. The brown locks of hair were almost meticulously placed in a certain style, and they never lost their volume, no matter how much the omega danced.
“I know, darling, but you can see how much our son is suffering. He’s hurting enough to make his own plan to make things right for himself. I know he’s serious about this because he ran the numbers.”
That got a happy noise out of the omega, but also got a few tears to be shed. Tony was glad Steve didn’t see them. “That… you don’t know how happy that makes me.” Tony’s voice cracked with emotion, betraying himself.
Maria and Tony only had to make eye contact with each other once Tony was off the plane before they were running and colliding in a tight, tear-filled hug. Neither of them could utter a single word as they hugged, both of them knowing just how tragic the situation had suddenly become. When their crying had settled a little, Maria pulled back, glancing at Howard before speaking low.
“Why would I want something pricy? I just want your time, to get to know you, not fake something to impress you.” Steve smiled. “I want to be genuine.”
“I made it, actually.” Tony took the ring out of the box and tapped a certain part of the ring twice. It lit up a brilliant blue, the same tint of blue that the arc reactor glowed. “It has the ability to sync up with my arc reactor. It’s got a similar shielding mechanism too… Because I wanted you to be safe when I’m not around to use my arc reactor to protect you.”
Once again, Steve led Tony through the store and to the grocery side where they would find all the snacks they wanted. Steve insisted on at least getting something more filling and nutritious for Tony so it wouldn't just be alcohol and junk food in his stomach, but other than that, he let the omega pick out whatever he wanted to snack on after that. Cookies, crackers, nuts, they grabbed perhaps a little of everything. And if they didn't eat it all that night, there was always the next day, which was a Sunday, so neither of them had to necessarily work until Monday. Having a weekend for just the two of them was sounding nicer to Steve the longer time went on. Sure, the gala hadn't gone completely as planned, but Steve still got to spend time with Tony, and they had shared a kiss in front of a ton of cameras. Staying out of the public eye for a day would give the reporters a great day to come up with wild theories and stories to post as soon as they could.
Tony and Peggy found out very quickly just how fast Steve could jog. They had a hard time keeping up as they ran to the colonel’s tent, and they were honestly a little out of breath by the time they got there. Steve however seemed to have not even broken a sweat.
Steve closed the distance and kissed Tony deeply, supporting his lower back with a strong hand pressed against it. The placement of his hand got a moan from the omega, and Tony only pressed in closer. The kiss ended all too quickly, Steve pulling away when he heard Howard approach again.
Steve shrugged as he got out of the car, letting Tony climb out. As much as he wanted to kiss the omega good night, he knew that would be pushing the limits of Howard’s patience. He opted for a simple smile. “Good night, Tony, Mr. Stark.”
Steve pulled away from Tony when he heard Bucky’s door slam, and he looked up, seeing the empty hallway. “Well… I guess Bucky took a liking to your friend. Better leave them be.” He smirked and looked back at Tony. “Come on, let’s continue things in my room before we start fucking out here in the hallway.”
A low growl came from Steve’s throat. “If you’re still willing, I’d very much like for you to sit on my knot.”
“Do dare. I like it...unless I’m dealing with the alphas on the board. Then no. I’m intimidating and in charge!”
“It’s alright, Tony. When you told me you were with Mr. Rogers, I knew you were going to be safe, no matter where you were.”
“I’m sure I can handle you when you’re drunk, Tony.” Steve wrapped his arm back around the omega’s waist and pulled him closer, kissing the top of his head.
Steve chuckled. "Nope, the glory of a retail store. Anything you could ever want is inside. Come on, I'll make sure you don't get lost."
Tony nodded, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Steve’s scent was still comforting, even if Tony’s heat had been put on hold. He was just glad that he had Steve there in case he chickened out. Besides, Tony had barely seen a true battlefield. He had only seen what it was like in a camp and how beat up those who managed to return were. Imagining any of that happening to himself didn’t leave a pleasant feeling in his stomach, but if worse came to worst, he would do anything to keep those he loved safe.
Steve nodded, his mouth full of food. He finished chewing before he spoke again. “We still don’t have much information on the hidden base, but we have a feeling it’s the Hydra headquarters.”
Steve hardly had his eyes opened to be completely honest. He was lost in the moment, much like Tony was. It just felt so good to be inside the omega, feel him squeeze and relax around him when one thrust hit a particularly nice spot. His hands had moved to grip Tony’s hips and pull them back as he thrust his hips forward. Each time he did that, he was rewarded with a louder moan from the omega, which only encouraged him to go harder and harder, deeper until Tony was so full of him.
Once Tony was cleaned up, Steve cleaned himself and leaned down to kiss the omega’s cheek. “How are you feeling?”
Tony felt numb. It wasn't from not taking his pill that day, because he took it in the mornings usually, so he had taken his pill for the day, but his body would most likely start going into heat the next morning once it realized there wasn't a suppressant pill taken. Tony knew that was going to suck a lot, but at least he could stay with Steve. He
“We should set up a checkup appointment first,” the doctor said. “Just to look over things and make sure the baby is healthy and on a good growing rate.”
When the doors opened again, Steve nearly dropped his jaw. Everything he saw was so much more sophisticated and clean in design, more organized than the cluttered base in London he had learned about so many missions in. Agents were everywhere Steve looked, and he began to trust them a little more, but he still wasn't fully trusting Fury, so he wasn't ready to fully trust the agents just yet.
Steve looked at the two robots, who turned to him in what seemed like interest. “So these are your… babies? I assume?”
By the time they returned to the camp, Tony was barely able to think straight, though thankfully he managed to hold in most of his noises as Peggy led him to the medical tent. He barely heard her tell alphas coming out of their tents to back off. He knew his scent was getting stronger by the second, and having so many alphas wanting to be with him was a nice thought, but also bad. Steve would be angry at any alpha who dared touch Tony, and the thought of any other alpha being with him besides Steve suddenly put a bad feeling in his stomach. He thought he might pass out before they even got to the medical tent.
As the two left the balcony, Tony smiled and grabbed Steve’s hand, leaning against the alpha as he let slip a few tears. He was right, he was finally happy again with Steve, and though he left a lot behind, Tony didn’t feel a bit of regret as he walked beside his alpha once more. All his worries were washing away with the rain the more time he spent with Steve, and though his suffering from anxiety and depression wouldn’t end any time soon, Tony was feeling better than he had  in a very long time. It was safe to say he was allowed to be a bit selfish when it came to spending time with his mate.
“Sounds like you’re leaving again,” Tony said, taking a bite of his own sandwich while looking over at Steve. It had been a few days since the omega had been released from the hospital, and he was finally out of his heat and back to his normal self. His rib was still healing, but he had the ice pack the hospital sent home with him tapped down to his side.
The omega laughed when Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “Oh relax, you big dumb alpha. Your alphaness isn’t so sensitive that you’re offended by what I said.”
Tony grunted when he landed, bouncing and rolling until he came to a full stop, with a weak groan. The ringing in his ears was painful, and the rest of his body hurt pretty bad as well. His mask had been blown clean off of his face. If he hadn't been blinded by the explosion, he would have noticed his arc reactor barely hanging onto his uniform flicker a little before glowing steadily again.
Steve leaned down to nuzzle Tony’s jaw, muttering praises to his omega as he slowly gained control of his mind again. “God, Tony, you’re always so good at taking my cock.”
“Of course sir.” a disembodied voice stated before a projection lit up over the desk and Tony reached out and actually started interacting with it, digging through the virtual file and pushing things aside before finally finding a 3D image of a hand, guides and measurements still in place around it.
“Really? You smell strong so I figured you were heavy on the alpha cologne to cover up the smell of alcohol. Plenty of alphas here do that.” Tony turned the lights to a low setting and switched on the soft music that helped make any outside noises from the club seem non-existent. Then he moved over to the bed and sat down, waiting for the alpha to hint at what kind of session he’d prefer.
Tony also kept in shape when he had free time. He’d often go on runs around the neighborhood, knowing he was safe enough to do so. No one dared do anything to upset a Stark, especially not the omega Stark who was worth far more than most people made in a year. Those little runs gave Tony a bit of freedom to escape and just be himself. He appreciated the moments he had alone to think and collect his thoughts, especially since he didn’t have Steve around to keep him grounded in reality.
“Tony!” Howard shoved things out of the way to get to his son, and when he pushed the screen away, he gasped and held shaking hands over his son’s unconscious body. “Oh my god…”
Tony all but sobbed into his mother’s shoulder, hugging her tight despite his rib hurting. “Mom… I’m so sorry I left,” he said after his crying had settled a bit.
Tony chuckled. “All the stars we can see in the sky wouldn’t even come close to the number that represents my love for you, Steve.”
“I see… but surely it can’t be healthy for you to just work until you pass out. You still need proper sleep, Tony.”
There was a lot more silence that Tony was anticipating, but he still didn’t like how it dragged on without Steve saying anything. The blond had gone back to eating, though Tony could tell he was tense by the way his jaw was set. When Tony thought he wasn’t going to get an answer, he drank more of his wine and started eating again. Somehow he knew he was going to get this reaction.
“I may be interested. Too bad you didn’t go with that guy to the club last night, I would have offered you a private session.” Clint said, gesturing behind them at the other couple.
“I’ll wear my scarf even,” Tony said, grimacing and rubbing his chest. “God, throwing up took a lot out of me. My chest and back are both sore today.”
“THIS STYLE!” Tony suddenly interrupted a few minutes later, dropping the portfolio onto Pepper’s desk, and covering the paperwork Pepper was talking Steve through so that they would both be protected should something happen, not that it would.
Tony hardly noticed when Steve shifted and moved away from his legs, finally removing his briefs and revealing that thick alpha cock that Tony had waited oh so long for. The omega could hardly contain the gasp he let out. Yeah, that was going to be a bitch to get in, but he was eager and willing. His body was already producing enough slick to lube up the whole damned army, surely it would be enough when Steve finally inserted himself into his omega. For Tony, that moment was close at hand, and continuing to remind himself of that only made his body react even more.
Steve didn’t get a chance to respond as their food and drinks arrived. He thanked the waitress and looked back at Tony before grabbing his food and starting to eat. Better to not say anything and make things worse. He sighed after taking a few bites, noticing Tony hadn’t even touched one cheeseburger yet. The alpha swallowed the bite he had in his mouth. No, he wasn’t going to say anything. He wasn’t going to do anything at all. He would keep eating and let Tony do what he wanted in his own time.
Tilting his head, Tony sat up and looked at his alpha as he too sat up. “What? Don’t tell me you’re going to leave me again…”
When the two had passed the third omega store, Tony sighed. “I think I’m going to have to give in and just go into one of the omega stores. I won’t be finding anything if I don’t.”
“So you told me this is a surprise where we’re going?” Tony said, looking up at the blond. “Can you tell me yet where exactly this date is?”
There was a knock on the front door, which startled Tony enough to tear him from spacing out. Shaking his head he headed to the door and opened it. Bucky was behind the door, smiling and bowing his head to the omega.
“Well, we can talk about it over dinner tonight, okay? You’ve had a long day of flying, so I’m sure you’re hungry.”
Through more and more hallways they went, attacking when they could and hiding when they couldn’t. Tony’s pain had been completely blocked by his adrenaline, which wasn’t the best thing, but it was keeping him in the fight, and he was going to fight as long as he had to, just to be with Steve at the end of the day, even if that meant taking things to the extreme. Tony would shoot as much as he could and throw as many punches as he dared to make sure as many soldiers as possible returned to London that day.
Tony felt his stomach flip as they rounded the corner of the hallway and met Steve face to face, along with Bucky. The omega’s heart started beating faster as he made eye contact with his alpha. “Hello, Captain,” he managed to say with a smile.
The agent was silenced as Phillips took a shot at him, killing him on the spot. He reloaded the gun with a smirk. “Let’s go find two more.”
The assault team was left waiting once more, the chaos behind the gates of the Hydra base soon fading and leaving the forest in silence once more. Everyone held their breath as they watched, listening for the call that would bring them into the battle. All they had to do was wait out Steve getting captured, which had already happened, if the silence was a telling sign, and wait for the Howling Commandos to come ziplining in, guns blazing and shooting down Hydra agents.
“I’m sure I could come up with some excuse if I want my big strong alpha boyfriend to carry me out of here.” Tony chuckled.
“You aren’t cute.” Miss Potts said, mostly to try and get them (Tony) back on track.” And you smell like grease and dirt.”
Pulling Tony closer, Steve put his hands on either side of the omega’s head, and Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist. Barely any of the omega’s body was still on the bed, and Steve loved it. He loved how close Tony felt, how the little enjoyable noises seemed to just keep coming, no matter what Steve did. It was a tender moment, and Steve couldn’t help but kiss Tony on the lips lovingly.
“Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities,” Howard said as he walked up to the table everyone gathered around. He glanced at Tony briefly before sitting down. “He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern seaboard in an hour.”
Tony shook his head. “No blood, but back and chest pain… been dizzy and really hungry but I can’t eat much.” He covered his mouth quickly and whined as he rushed off to the bathroom again.
“Yup, even when grouped with only omegas, I’m the shortest of the bunch. Look.” He kicked off his shoes and hopped to his feet, arms spread wide. “I’m smol and adorable.”
“It wasn’t that,” Peggy snapped back. “I had faith. Tony had faith, and Tony being here has nothing to do with what happened out there.”
“Oh my god!” Peggy hurried over to the father and son, the medic who had been with her earlier rushing into the room hoping she had found Tony.
Tony looked up at Maria with his wide brown eyes, looking every bit the young boy he used to be when he first presented as an omega. “Mom… I’m scared.”
“We might have just found the location of the last base,” Bucky said, which of course caught both Tony and Steve’s attention.
“Just call me Steve. I’d like to get on a personal level to start out, especially if you’re going to join Hydra.” Steve leaned forward and nipped Tony’s collarbone with a growl, since the omega’s neck was protected by the collar.
"Still, I would have found some way to stop it. You were more focused on your education, I'm sure. And if you weren't well… I still would have respected you a lot more than he did. He's an asshole."
“I just know what is best for him. His father had wanted him to settle down with me, but he rebels like a teenager, even now. His other ex, Tiberius, would have also been a good match for him, but again, he rebelled. If you are next in line, I just want to make sure you’re on the same page, and that you will do what needs to be done, otherwise I don’t think we can allow you to continue seeing our little omega.”
After several songs, Tony was holding back yawn after yawn and leaning heavily into Steve. He could honestly fall asleep in Steve’s arms, but he had to get back to his father. Howard would be upset if he stayed out any longer. Besides, Steve had to be at the base in the morning bright and early. He needed rest just as much as Tony did.
“No! He can’t leave yet,” Tony yelled, trying to escape his mother’s grip and failing to do so as Steve looked back at him with a pained expression.
“Well you’ll never be forced to be a stereotype as long as you’re with me. I’m sorry that they tried to force you to do that.”
“Oh, about a week ago,” the omega replied as he took Steve’s arm and walked through the crowding people to the parlor.
Tony’s heart pounded hard in his chest when the car lunged forward, chasing down the plane and Steve. He had a moment to catch his breath, and he put a hand over his beating heart to relax, not wanting to stress too much for the sake of his baby. He admitted it was a stupid decision to come and fight, but he had to. He absolutely had to in order to prove his father wrong. When Tony’s hand was met with a strange wetness, he lowered his hand and glanced down at it briefly. Blood. That’s what it was. He was bleeding, and he hadn’t noticed it because of the coloring of his uniform. He just had to have chosen his uniform to be the same color as blood.
“I don’t want to go anywhere without you now. If I’d have to leave you here again, I think I might go mad.”
Gently putting a hand on Tony's shoulder, Steve took the empty seat next to the omega, and solemn expression on his face.
“Yeah…” Tony rubbed his arm, attempting to smile and failing to do so. “I’m worried he’s doing something that will get him killed…”
The man in the doorway was covered in grease and sweat, his hair a mess of curls pushed back by a pair of safety glasses, and his jeans and black tank top made him look so very out of place in the clean modern look of not just the office, but all the spaces of the tower Steve had seen so far.
Tony sighed, shifting closer. “I’m glad the others don’t mind us. Some time together like this is nice. Especially before a battle.”
“They can’t really want Tony to fly all the way to London,” Maria said to Jarivs after Tony’s sobbing had faded to silent crying. “That’s so far for him to fly on his own.”
Tony laid there for several minutes, trying to crawl across the floor and reach his arc reactor. In his panic he had done the math in his head that the electromagnet in the reactor had prevented the shrapnel from digging further into his chest. If he could have just reached it, he might have been able to save himself.
Sighing, Tony climbed into the car after his father, scowling when the driver looked back at him in the rearview mirror and smirked.Tony hated alphas who thought they could get away with taking bonded omegas as their own.
“You’d be surprised how many alphas who claim to be top of the line would release after only five to ten minutes.” Tony defended.
Peggy was already out the door, waiting for Howard when the slightest stirring from Tony’s bed made the bed springs squeak. Both betas stared at the bed for a few seconds, then Howard was rushing back to the bed, wide awake and hopeful.
Tony could barely get his lips around Steve’s not quite inflated knot, and he knew in the back of his mind that having Steve knot in his mouth was a bad idea… But still, it was entertaining to think of how that might feel. In the long run, his jaw would ache for hours, especially after being forced to keep an open position for an hour or so after the alpha knotted. But in the moment, it sure as hell would feel pretty good.
“A slice of plain toast, that’s all.” she sighed, shifting things out of the way so she could sit on the corner of the desk, “There’s something you need to know about Tony. I had planned to let him tell you himself, but it looks like that isn’t going to happen any time soon.”
Steve looked up at Tony with wide eyes. “N-no, I want to be with you still, Tony. I know I messed up, and I… I want to fix this.”
“Not any time soon, unless he takes a bad turn. Give him a couple days to wake up, then we’ll go from there.”
The two exchanged some flirty glances before Steve turned to go, leaving Tony, Peggy, and Howard standing next to each other in a heavy silence. Not a word was spoken as Tony watched Steve leave, then he turned to his father with a grim expression. “Show me what you’re working on,” he said with an almost pained tone that didn’t go unnoticed by Peggy.
Phillips looked at Peggy, impressed, but Peggy wasn’t fazed. She smiled and jumped into the car, motioning for the Colonel to follow. “Come on, action now, questions later, Colonel.”
The man stepped forward calmingly, despite his scent identifying him as an alpha. “Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but we thought it best to break it to you slowly.”
“Yeah, he had to get to base though. Something urgent that Colonel Phillips wanted to talk to him about, so he sent me here to pick you up and bring you to base. I hope that’s okay.”
The last two weeks of Tony’s training consisted of learning the firearms he would be shooting along with training scenarios that helped him work on his teamwork and coordination skills. Overall, Tony excelled greatly in his training, and Steve was seeing that every day he was able to watch. Watching his omega transform before his eyes from the little omega who sat on the sidelines to a full blown soldier was, to say the least, breathtaking. Tony was a little spitfire soldier when he was trained properly.
He was hard, wet, and feeling oh so very needy as something probed against his hole. Fingers? No, it felt too wet, even for slick-coated fingers...cock? No, not nearly large enough—especially if it was the alpha cock he’d experienced the night before… And it did feel familiar...oh.
Her expression was gentle and worrisome, and Tony couldn’t help but give her an expression that made him look a little overwhelmed. “Okay, Mom....”
When Howard found the bottle, he tossed Tony’s bag down to the floor with a grimace. He looked closer at the bottle, then scoffed. “You put Captain Rogers as your caretaker?! You know it’s fucking illegal to list a different person as your caretaker!”
Steve burst into what looked like a lobby packed with people dressed in all black. He thought that maybe they were Hydra, but he couldn’t locate the organization’s symbol before he was suddenly being chased after. Running between what he assumed were agents, he knocked a few aside as he escaped the building and ran out into the rainy New York day.
Tony grew even louder, clinging to Steve and hiding his face in the crook of his neck to take in the alpha’s scent as he felt him reach so deeply inside of him. If it were possible for a male omega to get pregnant off his heat, Tony was sure he’d walk away from this encounter with a growing belly, condom or no.
Rain began falling as the plane flew over the mountains and returned to London. Somehow Tony had found the ability to cry once more on the plane, and everyone who heard and saw him couldn’t bear to feel the pain saturating the poor omega’s scent. Peggy was lucky she was a beta, because she would have broken down for sure just by Tony’s scent alone. The whole plane was filled with grief-laced scents, and it only made Tony more miserable.
The radio suddenly went to static, and Tony’s heart dropped the last bit it was holding on. A new flood of tears blurred his vision as he waited for the static to clear up, but it never did. He panicked, his breathing coming in short breaths. “Steve?”
“I know, but sickness can hit you suddenly. Especially if something you ate doesn’t sit well with your stomach.”
“Fine! He can do whatever the hell he wants! Just don’t come crying to me and blaming his death on me.” Howard angrily turned away from Steve and Peggy, knowing he was losing the argument that was apparently already pitted against him. “He can have his freedom. I don’t care what happens to him at this point…”
The moment of silence was heavy between father and son. Tony was conflicted for sure, and he felt like shit, but his father had saved him. Howard had known the arc reactor was keeping him alive somehow, and he had known somehow that there wasn’t enough time to get him to the hospital without the reactor. Howard had known how bad a shape Tony was in, and despite their history, he had chosen to save Tony.
“I’m afraid the captain is needed immediately. He’s scheduled to be on the next plane out,” the soldier informed them.
"Oh gosh, are you alright Tony?" Steve took his hand back quickly with a panicked tone to his voice.
The portfolio was flipped open to some sketches Steve had been playing around with. Or rather, they were some loose-leaf papers that had somehow gotten tucked away in the portfolio and weren’t meant to be there. They were unfinished and still showed some of his blocking and guidelines, the forms still a slight mess of strokes waiting to be cleaned up, and color being blocked in with highlighters.
The commando at the radio responded first as Tony nearly tripped on his feet to get to the radio. “Captain Rogers, what is your—”
“I think I understand just fine,” Steve said, straightening up to make himself look like the bigger alpha.
When the alpha was close enough, Maria let go of her son, trying to hold back her own emotions as she watched the couple hug each other tightly.
“I don’t think it’s that bad… but I guess I won’t hurt to take something.” Tony shrugged as he finished his first sandwich.
Tony could practically feel Steve’s rock hard cock pressing to his entrance, their clothing the only barrier keeping them from going all the way. He could imagine just how wet he would--or no, maybe he wasn’t imagining that part, he realized as he felt his underwear go damp and cling to his ass. He shifted both hands back behind him, as if he was simply walking with his hands folded behind him the way many high-ranking military alphas tend to do when they meant business or wanted to seem imposing. Then he glanced around, and deciding no one was paying attention to him, he quickly plucked at his backside to loosen his underwear before they gave him a major wet wedgie as he tried to calm his cheeks so they wouldn’t get annoyingly red. The last thing he needed was for anyone to know the state he’d worked himself up into--and the alphas would be the most likely to notice as they were able to smell it, he was sure.
Howard picked up his son carefully and let Maria wrap the omega up, then the three were heading downstairs and to the garage where Jarvis had their car running and ready to leave. Tony was handed off to Maria once she was seated in the car, and she held her son close, her own tears mixing with Tony’s as she leaned her head against his. The trip to the hospital was silent except for Tony’s crying, both out of emotion and physical pain. Everyone knew just how painful the moment was, and any amount of talking wasn’t going to help the situation in the slightest.
Howard’s shoulders fell at that, his eyes falling to the floor. “He doesn’t deserve a father like me… Not after all I’ve done to him.”
“So some time tomorrow, then.” Steve sighed, pulling Tony in for a hug. “I’m sorry, I should have been there with you when you confronted your dad.”
“What are you making?” Tony asked, opening a cabinet and looking at the boxes of cereal they had, considering a snack before his meal.
"Finally," Bucky muttered as he stepped out first, turning and waiting for the rest of the group to exit.
“Wow,” Steve said with wide eyes. He pocketed the papers. “Alright, burn down the rest of the base. You all know the drill.”
“Holy shit, Steve, this place is expensive… and hard to get a reservation at! How are we eating here?”
Tony was silent, trying harder to get his bag back, but Howard yanked it away and quickly searched through before Tony had a chance to fight back again.
“It’s okay, you don’t have to talk.” Steve crawled back onto the cot, shifting Tony to his other side so they could face each other. He grabbed one of the blankets and tossed it over the both of them. “Get some rest before your next wave hits.”
"Knowing I get to smell your scent all day is already turning me on," the alpha growled out, moving onto his hands and knees and crawling on top of Tony, leaning down to kiss the omegas neck above the collar.
Tony shook his head. No, no one would actually know who Captain America's omega was. Tony didn’t need to think of Steve, anyways. He’d only make himself upset, and the day was about mother and son. There was no need to think of Steve other than for deciding if the alpha would approve of the outfits purchased.
“We have a newer version of this top available for purchase,” one of the employees  said, coming up beside Tony with a smile.
“Of course not. The Tony Stark inner circle shares information on how to take care of Tony Stark. Steve’s now part of the group.”
Truth be told, Maria wasn’t sure if her son would be normal again. She was worried he had caught a serious disease that was incurable. She hoped that wasn’t the case, but it was hard to tell with how bad a shape Tony was in.
"Love them." Tony smiled. "Have you seen any of those Disney movies? I have a feeling that they're going to take off like crazy."
“The hell I don’t. I’m your legal caretaker still! Anything you own is mine.” Howard clenched his teeth as he managed to pull Tony’ bag from his body, searching through while fighting back Tony’s hands.
?” Maria asked. She knew he’d been injured badly, but she had assumed that the fighting had gotten out of control and the enemy had pushed back past the lines to whatever base they had set up, and Tony was hurt then.
After another couple hours of constantly running to the bathroom to empty his stomach or his bladder, Tony finally was able to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time, his stomach settling long enough for him to relax and just rest. He took full advantage of the sleep, not waking up again until nearly noon, the sounds of birds chirping just outside his window greeting him along with the bright sunlight. Blinking a few times, Tony tested sitting up, and he was so very relieved when his vision remained stable, as did his stomach. The only thing that felt uncomfortable was his lower back and his chest, and they were pretty sore. He figured it was from how many times he had thrown up and had forced his muscles to work pretty hard.
Maybe Steve could go too. Tony would get approval of some outfits perhaps, and maybe they could slip into a changing room and try on some of the outfits. Maria would have a
“T-tony, I’m gonna…” Steve jerked his hips forward a couple more times, and then he came with a stuttered breath.
“Maybe…” Tony moved his head forward and latched onto the zipper of Steve’s pants with his teeth, pulling it down slowly while the alpha got more aroused by the second.
Tony’s words faded as Howard approached his family, and without a second thought, the older man wrapped his arms around his son and wife, sandwiching Tony between his parents. The omega couldn’t hold onto his tears anymore. For the first time in his life, that he could remember, both his parents were supporting him, but the situation existed because Steve was gone, and that by itself was already so painful for the poor omega that the hug almost felt healing in a way.
“I still need to make you a better costume. The one you continue to wear, despite my complaining, is still a monstrosity. Besides, if you’re ever going to go into actual combat, that costume wouldn’t keep you safe for two seconds.” Tony reached over Steve’s lap and grabbed the sketchbook, turning to a blank page and starting to sketch a design.
“Tony…” Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, holding tight, but loosening his grip when the omega gasped in pain. Mostly healed but still in pain, all because of Steve.
“Howard,” Maria slipped into her husband’s home office and moved around a mess of maps and charts that had been discarded by the man who had been charged with searching for whatever it was that Hydra had been using to power their weapons, and by extension--Steve. The man’s last search had found one of the two, but Steve was still missing, and the man was almost desperate to find the alpha his son had so clearly bonded with in all but physically--as far as he knew. With the object found, the military's interest in the search had decreased, leaving Howard alone in continuing.
“God, I really fucking miss him,” the omega said with a shake of his head. “Our letters are nice, but it’s not the same as taking to him in person.”
"Anthony, please don't move," Maria said as she hurried over to the hospital bed, hugging him gently. "Oh god, I told you not to go with your father to work…"
“I bet they’re jealous of you,” Steve said as the waiter came up, asking what they would be drinking that night.
For the rest of that day, the couple put up decorations and made cookies as snacks during breaks. Decorating the whole manor would take time, especially since decorations outside still needed to be put up. Nevertheless, within only a couple days, the Stark manor was looking cheerful and festive, which seemed to lift the spirits of everyone. Even a bit of soft Christmas music was playing in the parlor to further increase the holiday cheer.
Moving to the kitchen, Howard rubbed his face as he tried to gather his thoughts. Now knowing that his son had been pregnant while fighting in a war, the father felt horrible for just letting Tony go do what he wanted. Tony had willingly fought while knowing his own condition, and it worried Howard to no end what might be going through the omega’s mind after being back home. Who knew what Tony might try next that would put him in harm’s way once more? If he had fought in a war while pregnant, what other stupid ideas could he get in that smart head of his? Tony Stark was math smart. He knew numbers like the back of his hands, could practically do calculus in his sleep. But when it came to common sense in situations that didn’t require math, he often was impulsive and gave little thought to the long term effects. It was his downfall, the stubbornness to jump into action and help someone when he needed to keep himself safe on the sidelines. It just wasn’t in his nature to leave someone who needed help, but in his willingness to help, he often disregarded self preservation.
“Well, even in London, Captain America seems pretty popular. But I had to make this reservation back in December.”
“Can you growl?” Steve suggested. “Most alphas I know would think twice about crossing an omega growling at them threateningly.”
“Better not be a quick-releaser. I want to keep it right where it is—right where it belongs.” the omega purred.
The voice on the radio was hard to make out, but Steve wasn’t exactly focused on that noise just yet. His mind was still hazy, cold, like he had been sleeping for a very long time. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but he could tell that it was bright behind his eyelids.
“They help make us feel better, yeah…” Tony popped one of the chocolates into his mouth and hummed happily as he closed his eyes. “Granted, they put me on liquid suppressants, but that hardly does shit when you’re already in heat. Really only works before or after one.”
"Fantastic. Hopefully we can get Tony healthy again soon." Howard kissed his wife's cheek before he helped her up from his lap, then he stood up and sighed.
“Stand down, everyone,” Fury shouted, and the agents obeyed, though they were still cautious about Steve. “This doesn’t need to get violent, so everyone just calm down and let me get the captain to where he needs to be.”
“I don’t think I mind too much about my own reputation. Besides, it could be fun to let the whole world know that you have someone who’s interested in you.”
Searching the base top to bottom, Howard was growing increasingly worried when he couldn’t find Tony. He tried calling out for his son, but he never got an answer, no matter how loud he called. After several minutes of searching the base with no results, the older beta felt a sinking feeling grow in the pit of his stomach. He would never forgive himself if he had allowed his son to leave and get himself killed on a battlefield he should have never gone onto in the first place. Maria would never forgive him if he had let that happen.
When they landed in London, the rain was falling harder than when they were on the plane. The snow on the roads were being melted into slush by the rain. It wasn’t a warm rain by any means. It was cold and heavy and dark. It was the complete opposite type of rain that fell the night Steve and Tony had their first A&W date. This rain felt like it would never stop.
“Very hungry,” the omega responded. “And like this is all feels like a real thing now. I’m still scared, honestly…”
“I’m going to make sure you get out there fighting, if that’s what you want, of course. But this uniform will be so much better than the clown costume you wear. More comfortable too. I’ve seen how you pick at it when it gets into cracks it’s not supposed to be.” Tony smirked.
“God, did your father make you stay around all those alphas? Because if he did, he’s getting stern talking to when he gets home.”
"The weather is nice enough for it. I haven't bothered to explore any of the new food places yet," Steve said as he followed Miss Potts "just moved into my new apartment, and I just decided to get groceries instead of eating out."
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “Well if that’s what you’re into, I can sure as hell make you my hostage for a couple hours or so.” There was a smirk on his face.
With a smile on his face, Tony got up from where he was sitting on his bed and left his drawing supplies, moving over to his closet to pull out the sparkling red outfit. If someone had told him a couple years prior that he’d be wearing fancy omega outfits for parties, Tony would have laughed. But as time had gone on and Tony had stayed by Steve’s side, part of his omega self was starting to enjoy dressing up on the rare occasion, as long as Steve was also there looking as handsome as ever. Otherwise, Tony wasn’t going to dress as nice.
“You did everything you could, Steve.” Peggy sighed and shifted the chair closer that she had sat down in. “Did you believe in Bucky? Did you respect him?”
Groaning, Tony sat on the edge of his bed and tried to stop the dizziness he was experiencing. If the world would just stop spinning, he’d have time to stop and think for a bit. Think about why he was having all those symptoms and what they could mean.
“Good omega,” Steve purred, nuzzling Tony’s neck where he knew the scent gland was. That spot was so familiar to him already, but still he had not left a mark. Only when they got married would he do that and officially claim Tony’s as his.
Soon Tony’s room was free of plates and cups that he had hoarded since his alpha left. Maria made his bed and cleaned up other parts of his room before coaxing him out for some proper food and water to help him get healthy once more. It was clear that the amount of food he had eaten since Steve had left was nowhere near his normal intake, and he had lost a bit of weight. It wasn’t much, but it certainly wasn’t healthy to lose any weight from not feeling well. Maria was greatly concerned for Tony, but if she could nurse him back to top health as quickly as he had started being unhealthy, then she was going to try her hardest to help her son.
Tony’s chest felt tight, words failing to come out of his mouth as tears started blurring his vision. No… No, Steve had to come back safely. He had to, there was no other option! Tony swallowed, hearing people leave the room as he spoke once more.
When they were finally in position, the Hydra headquarters just barely visible, Tony kept watch with a few other alphas while Colonel Phillips radioed in to the Howling Commandos and Steve that the assault team was ready. It was then only a matter of waiting. The forest was quiet, foggy, cold. Where Tony expected there to be chatter, there was none. No one looking at each other, just at the surrounding forest, waiting, watching, listening. The suspense in the air was so thick, Tony was sure he could cut it with a butter knife. Even the smallest bit of noise from a squirrel or bird caused some of the soldiers to flinch and scare themselves. It wasn’t like Hydra knew they were there, but there were some doubts that they were completely safe within the trees.
A fresh layer of snow had fallen in the morning, but it had been reduced to slush after an afternoon rain came through, making the streets a mess that no one really wanted to drive or walk through. Thankfully the driver of the car that would be taking the couple to their dinner wasn’t going to complain about driving Captain America and his Stark around.
Maria suddenly laughed. “Oh, Tony, you’re far from dying, sweetie. Though I have to say I thought Steve would have been more responsible.”
“The pleasure’s all mine, handsome.  Sorry about the mess,” He gestured to all of himself, “I’ve been working on something new. It wasn’t playing nice. But hey, lucky you, getting to see the real Tony Stark the press forgets must actually exist because there’s no way I’m going to be productive in a suit and expecting to stay perfectly groomed. Very few people get to see me like this.”
Traffic was not quite as good as Steve would have hoped, but he eventually did arrive at James’s place, ringing the doorbell near the front door so his presence could be known to his host.
Italy was not as nice as Tony or Steve had hoped. Sure, the views were nice and all, and the weather wasn’t too bad in November, but the performances sure fell flat when they were in front of the men fighting for their country. Tony couldn’t say how many times he had been hit on by the soldiers since he and Steve arrived at the camp. It seemed the soldiers were far more interested in beta girls and omegas than watching a man dressed in tights ask them if they wanted to help him sock ol’ Adolf in the jaw.
Steve and Bucky came flying in on both sides of Tony, pushing back any Hydra agents that got too close. They gave a signal to the rest of the commandos to charge forward with them, and out of the fog came a line of men with guns blazing. With all the gunfire suddenly focused on the Hydra agents, it was hardly much of a battle until they got the gates, where a tank was waiting to fire and blast the Howling Commandos out of existence. When the first shot was fired, the commandos dove out of the way, Tony diving forward before he shot down more Hydra agents.
Finally agreeing with Steve, Tony sighed and tried to force down another wave of morning sickness. He was going to be miserable, but he wanted to fight. He had to. It wasn’t just his own freedom on the line, but the freedom of many other people in the world. No one deserved to be dictated by an alpha who only cared about money or fame or power.
In September of that year, 1945, the official end to the war came, and there was a celebration across the world. There was no more fighting to be had, the world taking a breather to rebuild homes, cities, and families. Life went on in a happier tone, but Tony was still left with his memories of pain and loss from the war, and those memories kept him at home most days, up in his room drawing away at new designs that never really got finalized before they were tossed to the side, meaningless without a use for them. Tony felt similarly about his day-to-day life. Without Steve around and no baby to take care of, he felt he was simply just a mass of atoms that required so many things to keep on living.
“You sure don’t act like the all-American posterboy that was Captain America. Pretty sure he was the type who would be too nervous to enter a place full of scantily clad omegas, and here you are, sitting between the legs of one, paying to get your knot sat on.”
Tony looked over at Jarvis. “I told him to come home if he had the chance to, said our doors were open to him and Bucky, Peggy too if she could come. He said they would try to come in August.”
Another promise made to him in the same night. Tony was glad he had good friends that understood him better than his parents did. Simply having someone who told him it was okay for him to act this way during his heat was far better than what his father or even his mother had ever told him, though the Maria had always tried to be supportive and understanding.
When the plane started to pull away even from the car, Tony whined and gripped the seat in front of him, which was Steve’s. No, they couldn’t fail now! They were so close, there had to be something to get them closer to the plane. Tony desperately looked over the dashboard, searching for a switch or something that would unlock some secret gear that would make the car go faster. And then there it was. A button, labeled in German but Tony figured there was no harm in trying it. He pointed to the button desperately and shouted.
“They’re for special occasions, of course. I have a red dress to match them, but I think they’ll look better on you tonight.”
“If you need therapy, we can get a therapist for you,” Howard added. “If you don’t want to talk to us about it, that’s fine. We can get someone for you to talk to. Hell, we can get Peggy over here for you to talk to.”
“Good, because Happy isn’t thrilled about these narrow streets while driving the limo. He’s eager to get back to more limo-friendly traffic or whatever.” Tony said, slipping his arm through Steve’s and guiding him back down the steps.
Sighing, and giving up painting for the day, Steve put down the paint roller and pulled out his phone, not bothering to look at who was calling before answering.
Tony sighed and looked at the ground. “I have a feeling I won’t be going on another mission for a long time. My dad is going to kill me.”
Going through his things and packing them away in their respective places, Tony couldn’t help but let his heart ache from being away from Steve. They hadn’t officially bonded, but he couldn’t count how many times they had scented each other, so they might as well have been bonded.
“Well, you make me happy, and you think sleep makes me healthy so the obvious solution would be to sleep with you!”
As the doctors came into the room with Peggy trailing behind them, the omega sought the comfort of his father that he had wanted for so long. He muttered out a few words before the doctors became too preoccupied with him.
The agent smirked as she looked back into the main room of the bar, seeing the soldiers and sailors go back to their drinking and singing. “I see your top squad is preparing for duty.”
Happy was standing outside the limo, ready to open the door for the two of them once they got close enough. “Everything okay?”
“You need to take a second look at your son before you decide that he’s too frail to fight,” Peggy said as she glanced at Tony before he disappeared behind a wall. “He’s been working out more since the last time I saw him. He’s aching to fight, and it shows. Tony may be your son, and he may be an omega, but he’s a fighter as well. It’s a shame you can’t actually see that because you’re too blinded by the old ways of your generation.”
Again, Steve nodded. “I know that’s soon, so I wanted to tell you in case it happens before your next heat.”
Tony sat back in his chair and looked around the room, smiling. “You said everyone is jealous of me. Are they jealous because I’m with Captain America and they aren’t?”
"Absolutely. You can get into the fluffiest pajamas you can find, and I'll hold you close so you know that your exes are asses and they never deserved you in the first place."
"I suppose I should. Do we have any soup I could take to him? Maybe someone helping him eat will get him some more energy."
“I know it sounds bad, but I really was thinking of you when she kissed me. To be honest I was thinking of you all morning, and when she kissed me I… got carried away."
Tony shook his head and stood up, hearing the part of the song where Steve would lift up a girl on each of his shoulders. He looked through the curtains and watched. Secretly he wished he was on one of those broad shoulders, but he would never be caught wearing those outfits the dancers wore. Not that they weren't in good fashion, but Tony was not about the skirts and tube tops. He much preferred button up shirts and suspenders. He clearly wasn't a typical omega, nor did he ever plan to be, and it seemed that Steve didn't seem to care about that, luckily for Tony. He could be the omega he had always been, and Steve would accept him just the way he was.
“I wouldn’t be caught dead treating you like they treated you. If I ever started acting like them, dump me immediately.”
“I’d be happy if you were happy to encourage Tony into a healthier lifestyle. He forgets to eat and sleep like a functioning human being.” Pepper said.
“I suppose. It doesn’t matter much now anyways, considering they’re both dead…” Tony let out a sad sigh as he saw Steve get up out of the corner of his eye. “I mean it does matter to me…  I just wanna know if they were happy the rest of their lives.”
The mall was fairly busy when Maria and Tony got there. There were enough people that Tony thought he and his mother could fade into the background and not be bombarded by admirers of Howard’s work. The Starks could just be normal people, and that was all Tony wanted that day.
“He doesn’t know yet, does he? If he had to find out so soon, I…” Maria paused, looking down at the glowing blue disk in the center of her son’s chest. “My god… it really was that bad…”
“I… I don’t know,” Tony replied. “I want all that… but at the same time we’re still in a war, and if something happened...It’d be really hard to move on.”
As soon as their lips connected, Tony let out a little growl of his own, suddenly feeling possessive and more awake than he had been minutes before. Something in him just snapped, and he had no idea where the growl had come from. It was surprising to him, and to Steve as well, because the alpha had stopped his hips all together and looked down at Tony with wide eyes. Tony looked back with eyes just as wide, blinking before grabbing both sides of Steve’s head and pulling him into a rough, sloppy kiss.
Peggy, bless her soul, brought food for Tony to eat, mainly smooth foods like applesauce and mashed potatoes, before he was allowed to talk to Steve. She was just prolonging things, Tony knew. She wanted Tony to rest up more than anything, but Tony was a stubborn omega, to say the very least, and he knew he could get his way with Peggy.
“Christmas is coming up soon,” Tony stated simply. “We already spent Thanksgiving away from home. I want to spend Christmas somewhere nice.”
“It’s still hideous,” Tony said, moving to the side so Steve could run on stage and start his little dancing performance.
“Then stop blaming yourself,” the woman said gently. “Allow Bucky the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.”
Steve flushed a little. “You’re not wrong about it being uncomfortable.” he sighed and looked out at the rain, his little smile and blush going away after a bit.
“I told you they’d look good on you,” she said as she reached around and grabbed her necklace, fastening it around her neck. “Eyeliner is right there.”
“Oh, now don’t go talking like that. I can sit out here and wait for you,” Maria reassured her son. “Go on, find something nice.”
"We believe you were in suspended animation, probably from the serum, but we aren't completely sure."
Jarvis nodded and picked up Tony’s bags, carrying them to the car he had driven to the airport. Once they were packed up, the two climbed into the car and drove off, mostly in silence. Truth be told, Tony missed the snowfall of London. Now he dealt with the rain of southern California, which only seemed gloomy, as opposed to the mystical snow he had seen only hours previous. Tony used to like the rain, but after leaving Steve back in London, among other events that occurred, he no longer found joy in the rain.
The first full week of December was a hectic one, to say the very least. True to what Steve had said, the alpha had started going into rut, which was a hassle to take care of for everyone who lived in the Stark manor. For Steve, of course he struggled with control outside of the bedroom. Every moment it seemed like he wanted to take Tony to the bed and breed him until both alpha and omega were so exhausted they passed out. For Maria, she attempted to stay away from the rutting alpha as much as possible. She knew that all Steve wanted was Tony, and that was fine with her, as long as neither of them got hurt and they were responsible when taking things to the bed. Maria was thankful that just before Steve had gone into rut, Howard was called back to London for some research. Howard would be spared yet again the detail that Tony and Steve were physically intimate with each other.
When Steve took too long to make any other movement, Tony whined and shoved his hips backwards. That seemed to snap the alpha out of the moment of bliss, and soon he was pulling his hips back just enough so that his cock pulled out to the tip, then he pushed it back inside, repeating the motion in a steady pace that made Tony let out several moans.
Around mid November, a letter from Bucky came, announcing that he would be heading back to London to help lead the Howling Commandos on a few smaller missions. He regretted to inform Steve and Tony that he wasn’t going to travel to California to spend the holidays with them, as much as they had all looked forward to it. The couple mourned the loss of time spent with their friend, but they understood that something like this was bound to happen.
London was gloomy and cold. The trip to the city from Italy had been so nice, especially after Tony was out of his heat. He was far more comfortable and smiled more around Steve and Peggy, despite knowing that his father had been waiting for him with undoubtedly a disappointed expression. No matter what his father thought, Tony was living large for the world being in the middle of a war.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted when Peggy returned, Steve’s bags in hand. The brunet could smell his alpha’s scent as soon as she returned, and he let out a moan, which he stifled by covering his mouth. Way to go, he thought to himself, you just embarrassed yourself in front of your friend.
As Tony left his room, the spicy cinnamon smell that was often associated with the holidays filled his nose, and he could hear the lively music playing as well. Down the hallway he went with a smile plastered on his face. As a last minute accessory, Tony had thrown on a pair of tinted glasses that complemented the red in his outfit. His hair had been swept back, and he looked like he was worth a million bucks.
Jarvis smile and nodded. “Thank you, Tony. I will make some for you then. You’ll have fresh cheeseburgers every day, if you wish.”
“We barely made it past the vultures, but we’re here.” Tony joked, giving Pepper a hug. “How long do we have to stay?”
Steve shook his head. "Alcohol doesn't affect me now, so there's no point in drinking for me. The serum prevents me from getting drunk."
Tony swallowed, trying to ignore the blood soaking into his uniform and making him shiver. He needed to tell Peggy about the baby soon, because there was the possibility that he could pass out any time from blood loss. Not that he had felt like he had lost a lot of blood. His uniform already felt stiff, like the blood was dying and scabbing already.
“I appreciate it, Buck,” Tony said. “I need to pack up my things anyways, since I’m going back home soon.”
“How do you feel about makeup?” Peggy asked as she unlocked the door to her apartment, pushing it open and going inside, turning on the lights.
Steve stood up, making himself look as big as possible, and he started walking towards her slowly. “Now I’m going to ask you again. Where am I?”
“Please,” Tony said after the silence was too long again. “I can do this. I can get my hands on some suppressor pills so I won’t have a random heat during the mission. I’ll work hard, and the Howling Commandos can help me train. They’re not as busy as you or Peggy, so they’d have plenty of time to train me.”
“I’m just a simple artist,” Steve said. “I don’t require a lot. Just give me a pencil and some paper and I’m happy.”
“You’d better. I’d hate to lose the one alpha I actually love to a private that isn’t even that pretty.” There was a hint of a smirk on Tony’s lips, though it was short lived, and Steve barely saw it when he looked back up.
“Through a wall? Good god, Steve, I didn’t throw people through walls when I woke up.” Tony managed a small smile, but it was so full of pain that Steve wondered what all his omega had gone through without him.
That one weak cry made Howard happy and scared. He knew his son was alive, but by the sound of that cry…
Soon the two arrived back at the base early and ready to work for the day. Tony was probably too excited to be there, even if Steve wasn’t yet. He knew his alpha was going to be there soon anyways, all he had to do was wait and then he could show Steve his designs.
“I wish your daddy was here,” he whispered to the baby. “You would have loved him so much, and he would have loved you back just as much. He… he loved us so much, even if he didn’t know about you.”
“I’m seeing three people who only want the best for you.” Steve patted Tony’s hand. “I want to help, not hinder.”
“Why do you say that?” Steve was giving Tony his full attention, which only made the omega even more nervous.
When Fury returned, the doors were left open, and Steve could see an empty hospital bed. The director gestured for Steve to go in, and the blond couldn’t get away from the agents fast enough.
On the way back home, Tony was crying, and so were his parents. They knew that their goodbyes would be bittersweet, but Tony was going to be happy again, and that was all that the three of them wanted. No more tears, no more pain, only happiness for the omega who deserved every bit of joy he had experienced with his mate and his family. With Jarvis driving them home, the parents and their son all huddled in the back of the car and cried together. Only a few hours were left of them being together physically, and the reality of the situation was hitting hard on the small family. Soon Maria and Howard would be alone like they were before Tony was born, and it had been so long since that time. The manor was usually alive with Tony’s presence, but after midnight, Tony’s presence would be gone, and he would be locked away to wait for Steve.
