"Oh John, these pictures are fantastic!" Molly praised as she, Irene, and John were sitting inside the living room of Irene and Molly's luxurious flat.
John's hand was beginning to cramp big time. He signed lots of books, had pleasant chat with fans, and he appreciated the praise and support. But the one person he was waiting on wasn't in line, and he felt a little disappointed. He shrugged it off and carried on, as he got down to the last two in line. They were teenagers, twins, by the looks of them, with red hair and piercing green eyes, eyes that looked very familiar. Then he remembered them sitting in the front row during the Q&A session, next to the older man with the curls and cheekbones.
Sherlock studied John and the other man walking beside them. They were laughing and talking. They were definitely friends, but there was a hint it would be more.
"I'll never be normal big brother. Even when I try to be. It comes out fake." Eurus sighed and stood up, looking at her mother. "I know you hate me. But I can't change what I've done."
John maneuvered into a fast spin then slid onto the stage floor onto his knees, back arched to the point it nearly touched the floor, his arms raised and spreading out towards the sides of his head as if welcoming something from above to join him. Then he effortlessly stood to continue his quick powerful moves until the last bars of the sound wound down, until he stood still, extending his right arm out, like he was sending an invitation to come up on stage. His face was stoic at first, then broke into a wide grin. Sherlock's breath caught in his throat and his chest began to pound. No doubt about it, he was attracted to this gorgeous dancer and was ready to jump up and offer John the role of Titan himself.
"We have a deal John." Sherlock stood up and pressed a quick kiss to John's cheek. "That's what I get for falling for a social butterfly."
Gordie nodded rapidly. "I'll testify. If it helps you get that maniac off the streets. It's frightening to think I've talked to a homicidal maniac. I shouldn't be shocked, I used to be a psychologist, I've heard some stories that would curl your hair, but none of my patients were murderers."
John went to bed that night with a content stomach and and even more content mind, thinking life couldn't get any better. Unfortunately for another blond, his life was about to come to a violent end.
He nodded. "I have no problem with Greg, he's a good kid. I always thought he was all wrong for that Adler girl. He's too laid back and down to earth. He'll help us protect our daughter."
You want creepy, predatory Mycroft? You got it! Plus, Victor is a sad gay baby, Greg is a sad straight baby, and Sherlock shows up at the end just to give us a dash of the sexy.
He was alone; his mother was at a friend’s house playing with her weekly Sunday night bridge group. It was eleven o’clock and she would be back at one-thirty.
Sebastian nodded. "He's cool for now. I think he could sense my anxiety at first, so he really didn't attempt to make any conversation with me, only to say goodbye when the meeting ended. And he isn't going to male escorts, he's a dom."
Rosie's nursery had been hit with the usual autumn cases of severe colds and respiratory viruses, and Rosie had come down with a very bad head cold. Sherlock and John had kept her home, with the detective caring for the four year-old while John decided to go out and do shopping and run errands since he had Fridays off at the clinic. Little Watson-Holmes was a sleepy, whiny patient, and Sherlock had done everything he could to comfort her, by playing lullabies on his violin, cuddling with her on the couch and watching Disney movies, and reading her stories. Mrs. Hudson had made chicken noodle soup for the two of them, which Sherlock was extremely appreciative for.
"And that's the scary part of this Mrs. Hooper." Kitty smiled wanly at the two ladies. "Well, thanks for your time. I'd better get home, curfew's starting soon. Goodnight Molly, Mrs. Hooper. I'll see myself out."
John and Sherlock spends some more time together, Wanda buys a gun---and gets a date---and the killer makes another chilling call to the radio station.
"You and your temper. You've been good though, so I'll think I'll show you how much I love you now. We can eat later and heat the pizza up in the oven." He turned his head and winked at Sebastian.
"She's crazy. She attacked me at Regent's Park last week with a switchblade. She sliced my arm up good." He showed Dave the scars from his wound.
Lucy patted his leg that was covered up by the blanket. "Like you said, everything will come out in time. Let's be glad that we know who the killer is, and let's hope Jeff pulls through."
“Laters!” John called out, with a wave, and soon he was in the other direction heading towards the bus stop. Sherlock watched him go, pretending not to be aroused by the little swagger going on with his bum, which filled out nicely in his jeans.
Sherlock kissed his ear. "You are useful to me at home. You're the only one that can quiet my mind and keep my focus sharp and clear. I work better with you. And I've also been thinking, that maybe it's time to stop working with the Yard, and go completely private."
"You have to stay for dinner. I'm making spaghetti with meatballs, along with salad and homemade bread," Wanda insisted.
A look of sadness crossed Sherlock's face. "Why didn't you tell me? You're not ashamed to be carrying my child are you? I know I sometimes I'm not the most attentive alpha---"
John put down his pencil and turned towards the voice. It was Eurus Holmes. "Hello," he said nonchalantly.
John was intrigued. "Really? Well if he's such a genius, why is he still sitting there when everyone else is gone?"
Henry just grinned coyly and took Sebastian's hand, leading him upstairs. Outside, a gentle rain began to fall.
The Big H was run by Martha Hudson, a sweet but take-no-shit forty-four year old widow. Mrs. Hudson was unlike any adult John ever met. She was a former burlesque dancer and mob moll. Her late husband, Frank was a small-time gangster nicknamed “The Goalie” because he used to be a soccer player, and his powerful legs were put to good use breaking the kneecaps of those in debt to him or his fellow mobsters. But the mafia life caught up with him and he was executed, his body found floating in a Florida swamp. As she told John and Molly, she took the legit money she had, came to Sherrinford, and bought a run down diner she transformed into the town’s most popular eatery. She had a rapport with a lot of teens, she loved rock & roll and would chaperone the school dances, wowing the kids with her moves. She was cool and everyone knew it.
As the two loaded him into the back of the ambulance, Dave Morstan pulled up, with Henry Knight in tow. Henry was pale, and couldn't believe the scene playing out before his eyes.
As the two continued their lunch, Sherlock continued to gaze at John, this time standing against the wall of a public restroom. The desire to confront and talk to him was growing more and more, and it wouldn't be long before push came to shove. He had to be alone with John, or this trip would be for naught.
The meeting ended with a nice dinner at Angelo's restaurant, and a promise from Irene and Molly that John's page and contact information would be ready on the website by the end of the day tomorrow.
"Well, the lilac it is." Janine smiled and put it back in her closet. "So girls, want to do anything for dinner? Dad's working late and Mom's at a meeting for the sock hop."
London was experiencing one of the hottest summers on record. Thanks to the ungodly heat, major crime seemed to decrease and Sherlock wasn't being called on many cases so he was home a lot. John had left the clinic and was now an on-call doctor for St. Bart's A&E, so he no longer had long shifts away from home. Sherlock loved having John available more, especially since Rosie was now fifteen months, a very mobile and curious little toddler, and it was easier having two people chase after her.
"Me too Mom. He would have been an amazing Pop-Pop, and I know Clarence's dad would be too." Clarence had lost his father two years ago to leukemia. "We're not sure about girls' names, but I'm partial to Fiona. Clarence likes Alice. He's agreeable to anything, as long as it's not Tiffany or Crystal or something similar. He says they're "airhead" names."
, where he blogged about his life and being a gamma. He learned there were two other gamma males in the UK who reached out to him in his blog and they became quick internet friends. They were planning a meetup this fall in Wales, where one of them lived. Knowing he wasn't truly alone made him feel better.
"Well, it's not the first time someone's had a crush on someone else who was gay. I had a friend years ago who liked my sister and asked her out, but she's a lesbian. It took him months to get over it," John told her.
John nodded. "Fish and chips from the new place down the street? I don't think I'm ready for any Chinese or Thai yet."
John was ready. He knew how to defend himself against brutes; his own father was one, especially when drunk.
The rest of the day went by smoothly for John. He told his family that he and Sherlock agreed to seeing each other as classmates in school, and he reassured them the worst of it was over. And from there, things started to get normal again. They had leftovers for dinner on the patio, and John retreated to his room to listen to the radio and read. Tomorrow, Wanda would be taking John out to do some back-to-school shopping since Harry had to return back to work at the garage. Everyone was looking forward to the rest of the week being calm and carefree.
John placed his neatly folded shirts on a display rack and was ready to begin his next task, wrapping up a large Christmas order for the wife of a prominent heart surgeon. She had taken a liking to John and ended up buying one thousand pounds of shirts, socks, and ties for her husband and two sons. She would be picking up the packages tomorrow afternoon during John's shift. Before John could get the order, a customer entered the shop, shaking off the snow away from his dark curls. He was tall, with a thin build, but John could make out some muscle underneath his super-expensive Belstaff coat. He had the most unusual beautiful face John had ever seen, with full pink lips and eyes that seemed to shift to blue, green, and gray underneath the soft store lights. John was instantly attracted to the young man, but he was sure someone with those model looks was already taken.
Molly Hooper watched a handsome and muscular boy with light brown hair splash around in the ocean with a gorgeous, curvy redhead, wearing a white bikini that showed off her perfect California tan. Molly sighed and looked down at her boring pink one-piece and flat chest.
They were sitting on the front porch of Sherlock's parents' Sussex seaside cottage, watching the rough surf crash against the rocks as the rain fell down from a gray sky filled with fast moving, swirling dark clouds, each enjoying a cup of tea brewed by John. It was a warm early afternoon and John would soon be going inside to make lunch. They had no plans today except to stay at their retreat and enjoy each other's company. Their last case back in London was a long and dangerous one which brought both of them to the ER with stab wounds. It was enough for Sherlock to announce he and John were taking a month-long holiday and for Lestrade not to contact them unless it was for social calls.
The rain outside turned heavier and hit the windows. John gazed out at the gray skies and the water through the raindrops. He felt at ease, at peace. A rainy day here was more cheerful than in London.
Sherlock shivered and felt his neither regions stiffen. "I'm going to hold you to that," he murmured darkly.
"Yeah." Janine looked steadily at her friend. "Are you okay? I know it's only been a week since you and Greg---"
It sickened him to know that the heartless murderer was one of their own, someone known to Harold, someone whose identity would shock him. But he had to get him off the streets. He knew he wouldn't stop until he was physically caught or died. Dave prayed Harold would wake up soon.
He stood up, stonefaced. Without a word, he let Pete lead him away from the house and to his car. Molly put her head in her hands and started to cry, and her mom sat down next to her and put a comforting arm around her. "It'll be okay sweetheart. We'll talk to the police and see if they can persuade him to stay away."
He hung up with a huge grin on his face. "I've got off today. Mike's taking my shift and I'm working for him tomorrow from three to seven. He has to go to his grandmother's 70th birthday party tomorrow in Baskerville."
Sherlock instantly rushed to John, wrapping his long arms around the shorter boy, breathing in his freshly-showered scent. "Mmm, you smell wonderful."
Don't worry, there won't be any serious Johnvic, but I like the idea of the two in a friendly relationship. Sherlock hasn't fully taken in the perfection that is John, but once he does, he'll wonder why he didn't at first!
Dave Morstan entered the jail, approaching Sherlock. “You’re one lucky attempted rapist,” he spat to him. Over the advice of his mother, John Watson decided not to press charges. But you better stay the hell away from him. Don’t come to his house, and you and your siblings are banned from The Big H. If I find out that you’ve tried to make contact with him, I’ll personally escort you and your family out of town. Do I make myself clear?”
John felt a little better after freshening up. He ran some gel through his hair and it looked a little more shiny. He'd moisturized himself with some of Sherlock's luxury lotion, and changed into a red button down that still fit over his belly, black cords, and a black cardigan. "Okay baby boy, let's join daddy for dinner. Papa's pretty hungry."
"Why do we even have meteorologists in the first place," Sherlock sniffed. "Most of the time they get their predictions wrong."
John smiled and laughed as Evie babbled on about her day at nursery. She had been super excited about the “fingpanning” they all did, and John knew she meant fingerpainting. There was still some minor evidence of it on her hands. A good scrubbing in the bath would take care of that.
He pulled his knees to his chest and hugged himself tightly, trying to sort out this horrible dilemma, wondering how he should proceed. It shouldn't be up to him. It shouldn't be up to a fifteen year-old to announce to an entire town someone they felt was a decent, upstanding person, someone who helped save him and give him a better life was a psychotic murderer.
John was nearly to the pier when a yellow frisbee came flying out of nowhere, heading straight for his face. John quickly dodged to the right to avoid it, and in doing so nearly collided with another young man, almost knocking him down.
Gloria knew she and her family weren't well-liked. She had been accused of being a bad mother. She heard the whispers and the trash talk. How could someone like her raise a faggot and child molester like Sebastian? Why did she condone his behavior and allow him to keep his underage boyfriend in her home?
"No way. You were warned about your behavior. If you don't come home I'm taking you off the murder investigation."
Those were her last words before she fell to the ground in a faint, the glasses of lemonade crashing to the floor with her.
John took the tray and kissed his landlady on the cheek. "Well Mrs. Hudson, like the song says it was just another manic Monday," he joked, before sitting down and proceeding to tell her all about his day that should have been quiet but turned out to be anything but.
He spent an agonizing four hours at the hospital waiting for news on his wife. When the surgeon came out, his face pale and grim, John knew she was gone.
John took a seat in the opposite booth and looked Luke over. He was mostly bald except for some black fuzz on the top of his head. His features were angular, and he was sporting a neatly trimmed beard which had flecks of silver in it. He wore a navy blue long-sleeve thermal henley shirt and black jeans with white trainers.
Sherlock's eyes landed on the glass DJ booth. He saw a short, blond man with a muscular build step out and go down the stairs. He was wearing tight blue bellbottom jeans, a black leather belt, and a red silk shirt, three buttons undone, that clung to his torso and showed the outline of his biceps. He could see something silver and glittery around his neck but it wasn't not one of those gaudy necklaces many of the male patrons sported. They were dog tags.
John watched his husband do graceful laps, admiring the ripple of Sherlock's muscles as he moved effortlessly in the water, his deep blue eyes taking in the detective's long, lean frame going up and down the lane of the pool. It was fitting, John thought, that they were in Greece, because he often thought Sherlock as a Greek god, molded right from the flesh of Zeus himself, with his raven-haired curls, heavenly eyes, creamy skin, and perfect body.
Still in shock from the murders of Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan, the citizens of Sherrinford wake up to the news of Carl Powers' death. The killer makes another frightening call promising another murder, and one citizen finds themselves in great danger.
"Maybe I should tell them whom I'm really interested in, then they won't flock anymore." Sherlock leered at John.
He could hear ducks quacking in the distance, and somewhere a motorcycle engine roared out. John relished his time alone, as the next few days would be busy. Tomorrow he would be going to Woolworth's with Molly to get some back-to-school clothes, he would be working Thursday and Friday, the sock hop was Saturday, work Sunday, and Labor Day, he would be going to a cookout at Greg Lestrade's home. Then school started Tuesday and with football, homework, not to mention packing to move to his new place at the end of September, it was going to be hectic.
"He did look cute in that yellow nightgown. It complimented his green eyes," Janine replied, chuckling as she scrutinized a sleeveless lilac chiffon dress with a white bow at the neckline.
Sherlock longingly watched him head for the back where the lounge rooms were. He wanted to follow, but something held him back. Mycroft saw his brother whisper something to Anthea, who nodded and walked in John's direction. He narrowed his eyes and cocked his head. What was Mycroft up to?
Molly just laughed and continued to hold onto John. "Sherlock asked me about you this morning so it's only fitting you meet him."
"Oh God yes! He told us Sherlock was a damn good shag but he told him his life story, even correctly guessed his secret Cabbage Patch Doll collection he kept hidden in a closet!" The two ladies broke out into giggles, and John chuckled loudly.
"You're far from ordinary John and you're very special to me. You're my light. When I see you, there's no darkness. You're radiant."
"Is that right?" John took another sip of tea and smiled deviously. "Well, I'm going to be the exception to that rule."
"Oi!" Greg exclaimed. "At least those funny little brains are out there having fun. Something you should consider doing once in a while."
John groaned and rolled his eyes. “The last thing I need is some rich cube with a posh accent for a boyfriend. Not my type.”
John and Victor turned towards the sound, and saw a handsome grey-haired man wearing a white shirt that had a picture of a Dalek on it paired with distressed blue jeans roughly pull up Sherlock, who was sprawled on the ground, clad in a plum colored long-sleeved bodycon dress, black stiletto heels, a black leather jacket, and wearing a long, curly ginger wig. His handsome face was made up, and John couldn't help but notice that Sherlock looked pretty gorgeous in drag.
They continued to dance, not saying a word, the only sounds being the rain outside, Rosie's soft sighs, and the music on John's phone echoing through the cozy flat.
"Yes. Turned out to be the nanny. She had a miscarriage two years ago, and decided to claim the little boy as hers, believing she was a better fit to raise him since the parents were hardly at home. The child is fine, and I think the parents now realize it may be better if they eased up on their vacations."
John didn't believe that theory. He wasn't sure why, but he felt it was too easy a motive. He was sure the unseen prowler was the killer, and he felt that the person responsible had planned to do this, and Sally and Phillip were chosen because they were alone in a dark place. Anyone there could have been a victim. Whoever did this wanted to kill simply because they wanted to, and skin color didn't matter. He wasn't going to rush to tell the police what he felt. They wouldn't take stock in a sixteen year-old. He knew until something else came up, the belief that it was racial would stay.
John pursed his lips, then he smiled. Maybe an association with a prominent vampire family could be good for him. He looked at Sherlock. "Before you do anything else, you're going to tell me how you knew all of those things about me. Is it some kind of vampire power you have?"
"Your parents sound very accepting. I wish mine had been," John told them. He held up his pen. "What do you want me to write?"
"Yeah, he was pretty persistent. Good thing his mom came by and made him go home!" The siblings broke out into a fit of laughter. It felt so good to just laugh and not have any worries, and John was intent on having a good time today.
"Well, you've got one with me. Glad?" Sherlock peered at him, his eyes, now a sparkling ice blue, and John felt like he was being devoured.
Sebastian kept quiet, guilt and shame flooding over him like a wave in a sea storm. He hadn't made things easy for his mother. His temper, fighting with others in town (but that was mostly self defense from the tired onslaught of slurs about his sexual preference), and his attraction to younger boys---he knew it had taken a toll on her. She had to deal with a father who preferred men and he killed himself over it, now she had to deal with a gay son. He knew she loved him, but it was tough under all the scrutiny and outrage. He'd never thought she would try to kill herself and now he wondered how things would be and if his mother would ever be the same.
Mary nodded in approval. "I love that color. If get married, that's going to be the color of my bridesmaid dresses."
"I feel a lot better too. Mrs. H really put us to work, but it felt good being back." John gazed up at Sherlock and pushed away an errant curl laying on his forehead. "Mom's out with Mr. Auden, and she left me some money to get something to eat. Have you had dinner?"
The two were working on getting the last remaining groceries into cupboards and the fridge when the phone rang. "I'll get it," John told his mom, reaching the phone on the kitchen wall. "Hello. Harry, hey! How's it going Sis?"
"As ready as I'll ever be." John followed him back through the door which led to his studio. It was a large loft-style space, with a variety of backdrops and off to the side, a wall with tons of built-in shelves that held a large number of props.
"Bollocks John. Sherlock adores you more than anything in this world, and he would most definitely love you doing a photo shoot just for him. It would definitely stroke that big ego of his," Sally cut in. She looked pointedly at John.
"Sherrinford Slayer...oh, that's the utterly ridiculous name that reporter gave the killer," Sherlock replied dismissively.
Now it was Sunday and the beginning of their second week, and what looked to be a pretty intense thunderstorm was in the works. John had taken a dip in the ocean earlier in the morning, then headed back for a nice hot shower to wash away the sand and the salt, and enjoyed a lunch of coconut fried shrimp that Sherlock had prepared. John had retired to the front porch clad in a cozy robe for some ocean watching, while Sherlock indulged in a bubble bath.
"Hello John. He is, but unfortunately he's come down with the same virus that sickened Eurus, and he also has a fever. He's in bed resting, but not by choice."
Dave stepped forward and pulled up Powers. "Is this true Carl? Did you grab Molly and try to assault her?"
John turned around to gaze at Sherlock, deep blue eyes clouded over with lust, and it was all he wrote.
John laughed. He wasn't a cat fan and tried to stay away from them at all costs both as a human and a wolf.
Marty smacked his forehead with the palm of his hand, and the other boys snickered. "Jesus, I'm sorry Tim, don't mind me."
"Correct," Sherlock answered, proud of John. "He wanted to get back at the power plant and make them look incompetent. Sadly, the victims were just collateral damage, part of their psychotic scheme."
John absentmindedly looked down at his bag. "Yes, Harry--Harriet---is my older sister. She gave me this bag when I went back to uni. But that can't be the reason you're so interested in me, if Molly's telling the truth."
Something sparked in John's brain, like a match being struck. The serial poisoner case Sherlock was working on, although he didn't mention a law firm, the poisonings were traced to a volunteer group of socialites that met in another office building that was just a few blocks away from the building he worked at. It was just a hunch, a very wild one at that, but he decided to let Sherlock know as well as inform him about the bomb threat. He pulled out his phone and began to text, but saw he had several texts from Sherlock.
John thanked the man who left. He turned to Sherlock. "Merry Christmas love. I hope you like him. Mycroft helped me hide him. I found him on a beagle rescue site. He's five months old, already neutered and litter trained."
The two men bounded down the two flights of steps, painted in basic beige. When they got to the bottom, Luke motioned for John to follow him to the left. "We meet in Room 104."
Molly looked beautiful in a simple but pretty long sleeved white lace dress, her hair in a glamorous updo, with alternating baby white roses and round crystal clips evenly nestled in her locks. Greg wore a simple but handsome gray suit with white dress shirt and pale yellow tie, a white rose pinned to his lapel. Sherlock and John, who were Greg and Molly's best men respectively, wore the same gray suit and white shirts, but without ties, and yellow carnations pinned to their lapels. Greg's teenage son Justin, the ringbearer, was dressed the same as Sherlock and John. His daughter Julie, the bridesmaid, wore a pale yellow satin tea-length dress with short sleeves and her hair matching Molly's, but with a yellow carnation pinned to the side. And finally, little Rosie, was adorable in a cream sleeveless gown with fluffy tulle skirt and pale yellow ribbon tied around her waist. Her blond hair had been curled into ringlets, and she wore jeweled bee hair clips on each side of her head, courtesy of Sherlock and approved by Molly.
With a sigh, Dave left Gatiss General, frustrated that he may have the only living witness who saw the face of the Sherrinford Slayer, and he was knocked out on morphine. He replayed the images in his mind of when he arrived on the scene of Regent's Park Road. Harold was lying on the wet street, groaning in pain, and obviously frightened. The driver who accidentally hit him, a very remorseful father of six who was driving home from a late shift at a factory in Gatiss, said that he didn't see Harold until it was too late and he couldn't swerve in time to miss him. Luckily he was only driving 25 miles an hour due to the heavy rain, or the school principal would have likely died, instead of getting broken ribs and some scratches and bruises to his legs and arms.
Sherlock definitely wanted "to do" John, but not in the way the shorter man thought. "Greg already told me some of the details."
"You really think you're just going to walk in there and be able to get to John without his friends impeding you and making sure that won't happen?"
Several audience members laughed, Sherlock one of them. He liked the sound of John's voice. It was like warm sunshine mixed with the finest of honey.
Sherlock could feel himself blushing once more and he silently wondered if he was going to turn into a tomato. Any other time, those pick up lines would result in a brutal tongue lashing and Sherlock spilling secrets to his pursuer, but they didn't sound cheesy or fake coming from John. No, he'd meant them. And his heart began to flutter again.
With a broad eerie smile on his face, Jim pulled out his scalpel, bent over the unconscious man, and began to slice through the fake bronze of flesh that covered his throat, humming one of his favorite songs, "Staying Alive." Well, this poor sap wouldn't be staying alive for long. And when the bright crimson red blood began to ooze from the deep cut, Jim grinned even harder.
Tonight, as our entertainment, Gregory has chosen to have one of the best and popular Kine Dancers perform for us. Normally I would not host that type of variety, but I have seen this human in action and he is quite the spectacle, and this is my gift to Gregory. So without further adieu, we present to you, John Watson."
Jim kissed Sebastian again. "Well, lead the way to the kitchen tiger. Need to build my strength up for Friday."
Greg pinched his nose, trying to keep calm. "We've solved plenty of murders before you came around."
However, she was completely taken by surprise when he gently grabbed her chin and pulled her towards him. “You’re perfect too,” he breathed and before she could react, he leaned in and softly kissed her. When he broke away, she just gaped at him for a few seconds, unable to say anything. Then finally, “Why did you kiss me?”
"I'm glad you married me too. How about we take a walk along the shore, get our feet wet?" John suggested.
"He overdosed on sleeping pills. He had to have his stomach pumped. We almost lost him." Sidney rubbed his face, trying hard not to cry.
John smiled back. "You're extremely observant Mr. Holmes, but then again, you have to be if you're a detective assisting Scotland Yard. Let me examine this glass more closely. I'll need to get some gloves so I won't mess up any fingerprints."
Officer Dave Morstan stood outside in the rain, covered in a yellow poncho, raindrops soaking his hat. He watched the inferno in front of him and shook his head sadly, viewing the firefighters battling the blaze. The rain would be a small help to speed up the efforts to contain the fire.
Sherlock and Jim were standing in the teachers' parking lot, taking a quick smoke break before heading into school to start the day. The kids wouldn't be here for another hour, and they liked getting in early to smoke and prep for their classes, since they both hightailed it out of school as soon as the last bell rang of the day.
A car door slammed in the distance, causing Jim to jerk and lift his head up, stopping the slap and tickle. "Shit! That sounded like a car door. Someone's here!"
Greg had called Molly after dinner and she filled him in on the incident with Carl. Greg was horrified, but Molly assured him she was fine and that Carl will probably think twice about going after her again.
Veronica composed herself. She noticed John's apprehension but ignored it. "Hello, I'm Veronica Holmes, Sherlock's mother. You must be John Watson."
"I know, but I'm lonely." Sherlock sighed sadly, and John felt a tightness in his chest. He did feel remorse for him, but at the same time, his social skills didn't endear him to have many friends.
She sat up, exposing her breasts and smirked. Jim really fought the urge to caress them, but he stood his ground. "Don't tempt me like that."
“Okay, how did you find out my last name? This is scary. Incredible, but scary.” John ran a hand through his hair.
The bartender approached Sherlock who waved him off. The detective turned to John. "Afghanistan or Iraq?"
The two were at the front door when Greg turned to John. “I wanted to ask you something...about Molly.”
"Well, you guys have a great rest of the afternoon. After my two o'clock, it's back to Irene and Molly's for office work, but I don't mind. I love keeping busy." John wiped his forehead and exhaled.
"That's okay. Mrs. H. has been itching for us to clean down the kitchen, so today is probably going to be a good time to do it."
There was a moment of silence before Molly answered. "I accept your apology. It's just that I've never been used to attention of any kind from a boy. I'm pretty much invisible."
John shook his head, chuckling. "That's your opinion and you know what they say about opinions, they're like arseholes, everyone has them."
A few minutes later Mycroft and Gregory appeared in the middle of the expansive hall. "Good evening. Thank you for attending what is one of most important nights for myself and Gregory. Fifty years ago today we became eternal partners," Mycroft regally announced.
"This is only temporary. Don't expect me to show up in this...garb...all the time," Sherlock dryly replied.
"I would too. Rosie makes a mean chicken parm," John added. He looked at his watch and sighed. "I hate to end this amazing day, but I'll have to leave to catch the train back home. Sophie, Theo, thank you for welcoming me into your home and making all this great food."
John huffed. "Well, he didn't like me, but not in that way. A friend of mine introduced me to him as he's looking for a flatmate. He rejected me because of my daughter."
"Absolutely. I think it will be a nice change of pace for John and I." He told her it was hers and it would be ready by the middle of September.
This time, Big Seb blanched. There was no way he was losing his little Henry, he really loved him. “Okay, okay, I’m sorry,” he apologized.
John chose this time to go into the kitchen to make some popcorn. When he saw his mom, he grinned. "You look real pretty Mom," he complimented.
There was a beat of silence. Kitty thought she lost the call, but then they spoke again. "Powers was a bully. Using his words and his fists to make people do what they wanted. I saw him trying to harass that sweet little Molly Hooper yesterday afternoon."
"Very slowly, but this weekend John and I are going to be really starting packing things up and taking them to the new apartment..."
The two cleared their trash and headed towards their rides. The rest of the Hell Hounds saw them and started snickering and making kissing noises. Sherlock glared at them. "Oh for God's sake, grow up." John just laughed, taking it all in stride.
John lay on his bed and turned on the alarm clock radio, at first deciding to spend the rest of the day at home, but then he decided he didn't want to waste a beautiful afternoon inside, so he got up, closed his window, and made up his mind to go to Regent's Park to feed the ducks and do some reading under the trees. He would bike there instead of driving his car. He needed to have some alone time. And as he walked to the small shed in his backyard to get his bike, his thoughts of Sherlock and the promise he made melted away like a popsicle on a hot sidewalk.
Just then, Sherlock got out of the passenger door of the green car and immediately advanced on John. “Hi angel face. Didn’t think you’d be seeing me so soon, did you?”
"You got it. I'm on my way out now." John closed his laptop, grabbed his jacket and quickly left the room. On the outside he was normal, as he'd dealt with bombs in Afghanistan, but inside, he felt a little nervous and hoped everyone would make it out okay. He stepped outside and got hit immediately with rain. He silently gave thanks that his jacket had a hood and he put it over his head, zipping up the front.
John looked blank for a moment then blushed scarlet again as he remembered the tight clinch he'd witnessed from his perch in the cedar tree in the embassy garden.
"This will hurt, I'm sorry Sherlock." he said as he applied camphor oil directly to Sherlock's ugly gash with a clean bandage. He tried not to notice when Sherlock's breathing stopped and his torso went rigid in agony. With Hudson's assistance he then applied a clean bandage to the wound and secured it as best he could with the strips of cloth torn from his new shirt.
When they stepped inside, John’s eyes widened, he had never seen anything like the opulence of these train carriages! He was used to the elegant surroundings of the embassy, of course, but something such as this he’d never seen; thick silk carpets, velvet curtains, mahogany, crystal, gilded works of art, richly upholstered chairs and settees decorated the first carriage.  A similarly decorated dining car followed, and beyond that, a salon car.
Here he took a moment to look rueful before gleefully announcing again, "We are done John! Excellent," followed immediately by, "You must be hungry. Dinner?"
There were six soldiers in all. They surrounded the three travelers who had no choice but to surrender. They were searched and their knives confiscated before the soldiers turned and retraced the route by which they'd come; herding Hudson, Sherlock and John along the path in front of them. It soon became obvious why, for after about half an hour of walking, the trees thinned and the path opened up onto bare rock walled by sandstone cliffs. It was here, at a hastily erected camp, that the soldiers tied Sherlock, John and Hudson's hands behind their backs with rope and pushed them roughly to the ground to sit while they argued about what to do with the three of them.
"Your köçek fears for your life, Englishman. And so he should." The gang leader then turned and demanded in Domari to his second in command, "Knives!"
Lord Holmes filled the pregnant pause that followed this question with a cool, “But of course Your Grace, embassy children are tutored privately.”
"John Watson," in response to Lord Holmes' question and, with almost a sense of relief, felt himself begin to slide to the floor in a wave of darkness.
With that they took their leave, accepting the well wishes of the Ambassador and his wife and climbing into a coach.
The food and water worked wonders for John and he found the going easy enough when they set out once more, at around mid-day he judged.  The path took a gentle downward slope for quite some way followed by an equally gentle upward slope on the other side of the valley.  They met no one else on their way, not even goats or sheep although there were small birds and butterflies aplenty; their blue, yellow and orange wings flashing brightly as they flitted among the leaves and flowers.
But he knew the answer even before he asked the question. It was obvious.  I’ve fallen in love with him, haven’t I?  That’s what all this has been about. Love.  I’m in love with a man who believes I’m a 14 year old boy.  Oh, dear God, what have I done?
"It's near daylight, Master John, but the Captain isn't able to tell us where we are, the instruments smashed as they are from the boom hitting the wheelhouse. He thinks we've been blown back and have likely lost considerable distance.
Even as the gang leader gasped in defeat, Hudson was surging toward Sherlock, John in tow, to lead their way into the other room. One of the brigands followed them, slamming and barricading the door behind them with a curse. With this they were left in darkness but before the lamp light from the main room had been obscured, beside Sherlock, John had gotten a close look at the wound on his chest.
Just as John was able to gain his footing, the door was flung open and Lord Holmes strode in, looking anxiously around the sick bay, apparently for John because when he saw him, his expression eased and he asked, "All right here?"
Sometime later he was awoken again but this time not by the soothing motion of waves but rather to the frighteningly loud thud of the hatch door being opened and dropped and footsteps thumping down the ladder into the hold. Clearly someone was entering his hiding place. As John listened, to his alarm, whoever it was didn't restrict their search, as would be expected, to the main storage area. He could see lantern-light approaching him as they worked their way up to the rarely used space under the bow where John had hidden himself. His heart pounding, he shrank back behind the coils of rope he had chosen to hide behind and held his breath while whoever had entered his hideout searched among the boxes and supplies stacked around him.
But Sherlock wasn't done; the fight was over, yes, but something new and savage seemed to take hold of him. His expression hardened and his eyes blackened as he faced the villain before him. He surged forward suddenly and struck the man on the chin with a fist, dropping him to the floor. Then, standing over him with deliberate intent, he lifted his booted foot and trod it forcefully into the man's shoulder wound.
"If you are careful John, this is enough for three days, long enough to get you to Athens," she whispered. Then overwhelmed, she choked, "Are you sure John? Maybe this isn't a good idea. What if you're caught? It might be even worse than…" at this she trailed off.
As John began to recover his senses the first thing he saw as he opened his eyes was Lord Holmes' startlingly bright gaze fixed upon his face. John stared back somewhat dazedly, not sure how long his fainting spell had lasted. A blanket had been placed over him and a glass of wine was sitting on a side table next to him.
The woman from the flower stand (Mrs Murphy, he had named her) was a three-time widower, with a cat allergy. She was currently trying to convince her eldest daughter to marry the grocer across the square, but the girl was actually in love with one of the fishermen in the docks. Mrs Murphy had a difficult relationship with the baker’s wife, Mrs Young, who came in every day to buy yellow roses. Sherlock could see her now, walking briskly through the morning crowd towards the flower stand.
“The honour is ours, your Majesty,” the Prime Minister replied. “Allow me to introduce Minister Donovan and Ambassador Anderson.” He stepped aside to allow his companions to approach the stage and bow silently in turn
Looking around to make sure no one was watching, John walked carefully towards the channel's newly formed margins. Again, he could see something white and silver dancing for a moment under the surface. He kneeled down and held his gloved hands to the ice's sharp borders. The sunshine pierced the icy water in bright blue pillars that disappeared into its depths. There was nothing but a dark stillness.
“It’s ok, just-” John cleared his throat before pointing towards Whitehall Mountain, “You said to follow the wind- so, this way, isn’t it?”
Fighting his gag reflex, Sherlock let the empty bottle roll from his fingers and sat back against Mycroft’s door to wait for the powder to take effect. His gaze wandered around the deserted hallway as he swallowed against the taste in his mouth. The silence weighed oppressively over him, cut only by the tick-tocking of the grandfather clock down the hall, solicitously counting away the time. One minute, five, ten…
The Captain’s voice broke the tense silence. “I’m terribly sorry, your Highnesses, the word just came in. The Andromeda never made it to port. There is talk of a terrible storm off on the Southern Sea five days ago... I’m afraid we can expect the worst.”
Ouch… Remember, this was written after most of the case was done (just before the pool scene). And John could have edited the rest of the post when he added the last part about the pool scene. But he decided to keep this. And it’s still there for Sherlock to read.
“Getting upset only makes it worse,” the King explained with an even voice and took a step towards him.
Three days after Mycroft’s statement was made public, Sherlock found himself on top of Londondalle’s highest cliff, standing alone between his parents’ burial stones. As the Bishop droned on his prayers, Sherlock stared at the considerable crowd before him, a sea of black clothes and unfamiliar faces. Not even Uncle Rudy had come for the ceremony, claiming a sudden worsening of his back problems.
Not waiting for an answer, he turned to John and clapped him amiably on the shoulder, almost throwing him off-balance. “And you! Thank you so much for your help! You will stay as well, of course! Although I have no more beds, I'll prepare you a cot by the fire,” he offered.
During the narrative of the show, I think that John’s repression is the main obstacle for a romantic relationship between the two. His inability to embrace his true nature (the doctor AND the soldier=bissexuality) is the main reason we are at this point. We spend a lot of time on Sherlock’s character arc, but it’s John that needs to move forward the most.
Finally, I should mention Barry Berwick, the prisoner that tries to hire Sherlock in the opening of TGG. He contacts Sherlock and whatever he says, it’s enough to convince him to go talk to him in prison in Belarus. I just love it how the cases tie in each other (and how Sherlock bosses everyone around).
“A present… Some chemical help, if you will,” the window washer explained when Sherlock took the offered vial. “I’m a bit of a chemist myself.” He puffed out his chest with pride.
The King followed the Queen at a careful pace, trying not to slip on the icy floor. “Close the doors and stand guard outside,” he ordered the older guard, “Let no one in.”
The boy had just thrown Harry’s retrieved stick again, when suddenly something in the water’s ripple caught his eye. He stared at the lake’s quiet surface for a moment. A flash of white appeared under the water.
The two men walked swiftly along the edge of the garden, locked in an intense argument. The first man, a short, portly gentleman with a shock of white hair was gesticulating angrily at a slighter man in simpler clothes, who rebutted the attacks with a raised finger and a stern voice. Sherlock was scanning the rest of the garden when he noticed a third figure lurking behind a wisteria covered column - a young man, dressed in a plain, dark suit, was peeking from behind the foliage at the unsuspecting pair.
This was his brother’s fault, really, for not having taken him into his confidence. If Mycroft had considered anyone besides himself and his giant head, they wouldn’t be in this mess. He could at least have had the decency of using some sunny, tropical magic, that would cover the kingdom in powdery white sand and -
The horses were quickly saddled and brought to the front gates. The King put on his woolen cloak and mounted his horse, a steel-gray stallion. He waited silently while the maids put the Queen’s cloak on her shoulders and tied it for her, since she refused to let go of Sherlock, unconscious in her arms.
The window washer gave the prince a shrewd smile and disappeared under the roof’s edge. “What do you 'ave to lose?” he asked, already out of view.
The young prince’s heart grew as he took a breath of fresh air, delighted at his discovery. A new window into the world had been opened for him!
Mrs Hudson is still using Mrs Turner computer. We learn that she does Sherlock’s laundry… Not your housekeeper, huh?
“I think you got that wrong -” John began, before a mighty rumble was heard across the mountain path.
John had totally bought the “sociopath” act at this point. He is completely fascinated with Sherlock, but sees him as a willful child, incapable of empathy  and unwilling to follow society’s rules.
“Uh…” The man’s eyes danced over Sherlock’s face, feeling cornered. He then slumped his shoulders in defeat. “Billy. I’m Billy Wiggins.”
Sherlock took all this in and then concentrated on the sound of John’s breathing, waiting for the change of pattern.
who introduces himself as an “expert on sherlock holmes” and is all around creepy. He thinks he would do a better job than John and is disdainful of “society”. This could be Mycroft, but I’m not sure if Mr MI6/CIA/British government has the time to troll John’s blog.
"Hello John. What's for dinner?" He sat on the counter and observed John bustling about in the kitchen which made him jusy stop and watch in deep thought of a wishful future.
John uploaded his blog post and stared into his cup of tea. Sherlock was tidying up after his experiments but Molly’s boyfriend had John confused. Jim was clearly a Cupid but there was nothing John knew about him, clearly the man had become a Cupid before John had arrived or he would surely know. Delicate fingers began to knead at his shoulders. “What are you thinking Beloved? I know Molly’s boyfriend is a Cupid, surely that means he’ll look after her?” John turned to nod at his Lovely, his eyes seemed to glow, like blue lights in his face. John shook the thought off and enjoyed his massage. “I’m sure he will Lovely, or we’ll sort him out don’t worry.”
“John! John!” Sherlock raced upstairs where John was making some post-case tea with a lot of brandy. He stared at John, wings still held low and a small sob escaped him. ”How can you not know?!” Looping his arms around John’s trim waist he held on until the white wings popped into true intangibility. “Know what, you lunatic?” John shifted in his arms, he was always uncomfortable when his wings started manifesting. “That I love you, John I love you.” And with perfect faith in that Love he reached up and sank his fingers into John’s feathers, cloth ripped as the wings became reality. His Cupid collapsed with a groan shaking against him as Sherlock eased his fingers through the softness. They brightened at his touch, glowing brighter and warmer until Sherlock couldn’t touch them, couldn’t see anything in their light. He cried out as John dropped from his arms to the floor but Mrs Hudson held him back. She had dashed upstairs when John’s wings had started to warm and with astonishing authority she told Sherlock not to touch his burning partner until the light faded.
Mrs Hudson smiled, for a genius and a Cupid these two really were a bit dim. “His wings look sad Sherlock because your Beloved is sad. You love him, but he doesn’t know and we’re beings of Love Sweetheart. Tell him, he needs to know.” The mad boy paled but was out her door almost before she finished speaking. A swift kiss on the cheek and then he vanished.
Two years, John mused at the mop of curls snoring on the couch. Two years watching Sherlock slowly heal, and grow, and...
John had taken a few days to adjust to his wing kit in a shared space. He’d been given the thing at the hospital, combs, splints, and ointments and while Sherlock’s offer to assist him was sincere he knew the mad scientist also wanted to get his hands on his feathers. He dutifully manifested them each evening to check the healing and change dressings which was in fact easier to do in proper lighting. Sherlock had busted in on him during their first month together but his inability to physically touch John’s wings had lead to a sulk, John’s explanation that the touch required Love didn’t help things either so John had been left in peace thereafter.
"I was fond of pirates as a boy, used to use his bed as my ship apparently. Anyway! It stuck in his utterly unimaginative head so when it became necessary for me to have a rank he chose the navy over the army or MI6."
John knew he’d been found out when Mrs Hudson intercepted him at the door after work. “What’s waving your wings Watson? Something’s bothering you John, you know you can’t hide it from me.” She’d had the good grace not to smack him but John could see it in her eyes. “Obsession.” It was a dark word amongst Cupids, Love had so much power but it could be corrupted. “Sherlock gets fixated on cases John, you know that. Don’t go looking for a fight that’s not there.” “I saw blue fires in his eyes the other day, thought it was a trick of the light but it’s there. And it’s not mine.” Mrs Hudson studied him gravely, as a BattleCupid he would be called to fight Obsession's blue flames anyway but someone was targeting Sherlock, and he couldn’t even tell his partner what was happening. “Love save us. Why don’t you two get out this evening? Get him away from the case and if he’s around other Cupids he’ll be safe.” “Unless one of the pub crowd are targeting him.” That did get John a smack. “Those are your friends and comrades John Watson.” She chased him to the stairs. “Bloody paranoid BattleCupids."
It had happened after the serial killer cabby case. Sherlock had put one and one together and come up with - John had killed the cabby. Sherlock didn’t know what to do with this knowledge it seemed too precious to speak out loud, that John had killed to save his life. As a Cupid he functioned through feelings and Love, how could he have killed a father… What Love would allow him to do that. Hours of spinning thoughts later Sherlock deduced that John loved him! There was no other explanation. This was not just another job, his Cupid loved him so that evening Sherlock had wrapped his arms around the smaller man. “You love me, you killed him didn’t you.” John had gaped for a few seconds before he’d settled into Sherlock’s hold and just nodded. “You Love me John.” A tear leaked down Sherlock’s face but it was kissed away before gentle lips met his own, John was kissing him and if this was what love felt like he hoped it never stopped. “Oh Love's sweet Bliss, your lips.” John breathed the phrase like a prayer against his skin before climbing into his arms. Sherlock smiled as he held on tightly, marveling at the strength in John’s lightened frame. Strong arms, powerful despite their hollow bones, wrapped around his shoulders and John kept kissing him ravenously.
John was singing to himself when a violin caught his attention, the Strad! His mad husband was in the passage accompanying his impromptu solo, finishing up quickly he shut down the water and opened the door. Yes, there was a dressing-gowned but otherwise naked Sherlock swaying his way through the melody of the chorus. He led them to the lounge and John followed his pied piper without a thought to wet floors or anything else really, the music wound to a close with the chorus and a then panther purred in his ear
"No more tricks Beloved, please?” Another gentle tug had John kneeling up to lift his wings away from that amorously teasing grip, fading them from reality. There was a whine as they faded. “You can have them back when you stop using them against me in intimate conversations Lovely.” In response a long leg wound about John’s hips, pulling him closer. “Care to use something John?” The shameless implication made him grin, Sherlock was demonstrative and incredibly sensual as a lover, who could refuse that?!.
Less amused to have to participate but knowing Sherlock has no clue what to do John stands with a mild "of course, yes sir"  and they trudge up the lines to sort things out. John whispering instructions to Sherlock as they go through the necessary.
"Business partner" John said still chuckling, he handed his own ID to the corporal and they exchanged salutes before John continued "he's not that Navy, but he is very posh"  and they both trailed after the retreating Belstaff.
“She’s in pain, and a Cupid, and you’re a doctor, and a Cupid… Why aren’t you a MediCupid John? You would be able to help.” “Sherlock, we don’t choose our essential natures that’s just who we are okay? And please explain, who is in pain” Sherlock was doing his Brain-Off line blinking so John sat down and thought… “Mrs Hudson.” The blinking stopped. “Mrs Hudson is in pain, how do you know? Why haven’t you told me!” “I’m observant and I’m telling you now!” “Well…” “I popped down to say hello and maybe collect some scones when I noticed she was leaning on the counter, she never leans on anything and there’s bruising on her arms John. She told me not to fuss but something is wrong.” John felt a fond smile try to come out. If Sherlock cared it was with all his heart and John felt his own wings drop in response to the stress and misery radiating off his so called sociopath. “I’ll… We can go look in on her okay? That way we can share the scolding.” He pulled Sherlock to his feet and just held onto him for a bit before they went down stairs.
Sherlock had never experienced such incredible endorphin rush as he did now. It was better than ever getting high and he knew what his new fix was going to be as long as John was allowing. Oxytocin, John brain noted as he collected his spent lover to his chest. There had been a quick and gentle clean up before they returned to the bed to wrap up in each other and rest. Sleep, perchance to dream.
Sherlock was watching John watch him dress when an idea came to his mind, reaching into the back of his cupboard he pulled out the satin jacket he had worn at Christmas and changed out his white shirt for a charcoal one of a slightly higher silk blend.
Mycroft studied the heat haze shimmering over the BattleCupid's shoulders as John strode into his office. He had requested a debrief and after hours of listening to Sherlock insult his brother John had agreed to a meeting. He knew of his reputation amongst Cupids but hoped he could at least have a civil conversation, the doctor was always the more level headed of the two of them.
Finding a job on the other hand was not so peaceful, his PTSD diagnosis had somehow found it’s way into his public records. No A&E in London would take him on now and the only place he found was a small family clinic run by a mildly apologetic woman. Well of course he was overqualified! John was made for combat not stuffy noses and aching knees. His frustrated venting to Sherlock yielded a shocking phone call between the brothers, Sherlock was furious that Mycroft had violated his Cupid’s medical privacy and no, he was not really pleased to have John at his beck and call for all but three days of the week. Sherlock fumed, silently for once, as John forbid him from further confrontation with his sibling, things could get worse. John had seen it happen before and at least it gave him time to work on his blog. Ella, not a Cupid but a competent professional, had advised him to blog about his experiences so he did…….
“You stood up to my brother, he must have been irate or very impressed. Were you dropped off outside by Mycroft’s car?” “No, I left and caught a taxi.” “Impressed then, had you irritated him he would have had the driver drop you off at the door to keep an eye on you. Impressing him results in a bit of shock for my dear brother. Always knocks him off his busy-bodying for a few minutes.” Sherlock was chagrined as he collected his destroyed device. “I know my brother’s opinions John. I was always careful to test it on people walking alone.” “It’s an amazing feat of ingenuity Sherlock but it’s just not okay. Did you ever test it on Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock felt his gut clench. “John!” but he couldn’t quite find the words.
Sherlock had made a habit of worshiping John’s scar because he loathed that John felt self-conscious about it. Sherlock hated what it had cost John but loves it because it brought John to him so he adores it whenever it makes an appearance in the flat; or in an A&E or the fitting rooms at his tailors, swimming pools, beaches while on holiday… You get the point, not that he loves the rest of John any less, of course.
"What is the occasion?" the detective smiled as he poured himself and his doctor both the class of the rich dark red liquid which had a beautiful aroma as soon as it hit the air.
John grinned at Sherlock’s empty bowl, he had no idea how the ritual had started, maybe it was the endless focus on evidence and proofs but whenever Sherlock finished a meal John would be presented with his empty dish as if for approval. He was glad Sherlock seemed occupied as he needed to see to his wing, upstairs, in his room, far away from curious geniuses.
They are on a bus to Ireland because Sherlock refuses is ask Mycroft for a favour, and its now stuck at a road block. While they are waiting Sherlock observes the military staff on site are Navy, not Army and not new recruits either.
The pulley stopped with a jolt and Sherlock jumped onto the roof, not missing a beat. He pivoted around, drinking in the view. He hadn’t been on the rooftops since the funeral, either too high or too busy to indulge his habit, and now he realized how much he had missed it.
After washing and shaving, Sherlock dressed himself with the utmost care. Adjusting his cravat and straightening his cuffs, the prince took a deep breath and stepped in front of the mirror.
Keeping her eyes on her charge, Mrs Turner grabbed a protesting Sherlock by the wrist and led him back to the nursery while he cried his discontent for the whole Palace to hear.
Sherlock processed the new information quietly. How long had Jim been on his journeys? Even in such proximity, he was still unsure about the prince’s age. He focused instead on the facts he could deduce.
“We’ve just foiled an assassination attempt against the Suomic Ambassador!” A shocked gasp traveled around the crowd, and Sherlock puffed out his chest, reveling in the sound. “Here’s the criminal,” he declared, giving his prisoner a shove. Still stunned, the man fell to his knees, struggling to keep his head upright as he looked up at Mycroft.
There are a some new characters commenting on this post, as the blog grows increasingly popular. We have
John giggled at the comparison. “I’ll do my best, Mr Murray, I promise. But Harry’s just a calf, she needs to eat!”
“I am…” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Billy. “Why?” he asked, burying his cold hands under his armpits.
No point in moping about on the cold floor when there is so much to see, Sherlock reasoned. He struggled to stand up, feeling as if his arms and legs had grown several feet longer. It took him a moment to re-acquaint himself with his newly stretched limbs before he could regain his balance properly. As awkward as they were, they would surely come in handy to climb up the roof.
Sherlock fidgeted impatiently with the hem of his jacket as he waited for Mycroft by the Ballroom’s side entrance. On the other side of the closed door he could hear the orchestra playing a slow waltz, its chords obscured by the voices of the guests, talking, laughing, drinking. Oh, how he wished they’d drink their fill…
John stepped in front of the sink and washed his face. “Well, you can think somewhere else now, I need to piss.” When no answer came from the bathtub he only added, “And I’m not doing it with you in here, go!”
John grumbled and turned away from the voice. He hid his face in Harry’s coarse hair and sighed deeply. Everything was warm and comfortable. Perfect.
“Whatever you two were arguing about, it was serious enough for him to pull…” John waved his hand vaguely in the air “... this off and leave his own palace. He clearly doesn’t want to be found,” he said with undue conviction.
Soon, the ice was cut and blocks began to make their way through the newly made water channels and towards the ice cart. Cutting and pulling, the harvesters worked in perfect coordination.
“I can’t ask for an ice harvester to grasp the concept of serious matters of state,” he stated clinically. “The fate of the Kingdom is lying in the balance and you’re worried about
There was a beat of silence as he adjusted his weight when John called out again, his voice devoid of its previous lightness.
“You hold on tight, we’ll get us out of it,” John answered curtly, his eyes dancing between the winding path ahead and the wolves giving chase behind.
“Seriously, were you raised in a barn?!” John finally yelled after a sizable chunk of snow made its way down onto his lap.
“Some people are just born with it, I think,” a dark look came over Bill’s countenance as he spoke “Others just freeze their hearts up themselves.”
To his surprise, Jim sat back and smiled. “Yes!” he breathed. “There’s been some conflict between the northern countries about the prices of wool. The Ambassador has been terribly effective in keeping Suomi at the front of the race.”
"They’re going to love you two!" she beamed at Harry and the reindeer took the cue to lick her cheek as well. "You run back home before it gets too dark, but come visit us soon, alright?"
The Grand Stamford nodded solemnly. “I see. But he was not.” He extended an arm towards Sherlock, secure in his mother's tight embrace. She stepped forward and kneeled in front of the troll leader, presenting Sherlock for his inspection.
Mr Murray probably wouldn’t mind if he got home a little bit later… Without losing a moment, he jumped out of the sledge, released Harry and jumped on her back.
Mrs Hudson smiled at both of them, happy to answer John’s question. “My dream is to become a landlady,” she sighed. “I don’t know why, but letting people live on my property for money seems like the perfect lifestyle for me. I’ll just sit back, relax and wait for the money to roll in.”
He starts by briefly describing his meeting with Sherlock and what he has learned about the man himself. This is the bit that has Sherlock in a snit and provoques the ensuing domestic in the beginning of TGG. People who have read “A Study in Scarlet” will get the reference.
There was a loaded silence, before the Queen spoke in a low, menacing tone. “What did you just say?”
The imposing question was: How could the fact that his flatmate of two years snored slipped his notice for so long?
The King stood up straighter, trying to shake away his amazement at the sight before him. “Do what you must.” he told the ancient troll.
Pinned to the spot, Sherlock was obliged to bow to the guests and pray that he wouldn’t be caught in the exchange of mindless pleasantries for too long. He needn’t have worried because as soon as he straightened back up, Mycroft stepped down the stage to address the Prime Minister directly.
And that was going to be a problem, John realized. It was too dangerous to go into the forest in this weather, but he would be damned before he set his foot back in the trading post. As he considered his options, Harry grunted and shook her head to dislodge the snow in her fur. Suddenly, an idea popped into John's head.
He understood that his brother had to study hard to become king, but he still had more than enough time to prepare. Plus, Mycroft was very smart - he would learn his lessons in no time. He should be allowed to play, too. To play with Sherlock, to be precise.
This didn’t make sense. The bed was comfortable enough and the room was at a standard temperature and darkness level. John had been in good spirits all day and had ingested a full meal and a good amount of alcohol before going to bed. Enough time had passed for him to go through a full REM cycle, he should have started snoring by now.
Sherlock grumbled and turned away from the voice. He crossed his thick velvet robe tighter against his chest and sighed deeply. The bright morning sun shone through the window, gently kissing his face. Everything was warm. Perfect.
“The 21st of March,” his brother answered. “The ministers seemed to appreciate the symbolism. But the whole thing will have to be canceled if the Powers murder is not solved,” he warned, “I cannot be crowned king without the support of one of our biggest allies.”
Mrs Hudson waved her icy arms, “Oh, no dear, not with my hip. I’ll stay in the palace and have a cup of tea.”
- On the same note, the name Éiren Isles comes from the name Éire, the Irish for Ireland. Moriarty is Irish in canon, so...
Feeling the cold gripping around his chest, Sherlock decided to cut the conversation short. “Just shut up and give it to me.” The prince fished two golden coins from his pocket and extended his hand imperiously. “Make it two, just to be sure,” he added when Billy opened the box again.
“That doesn’t mean I can’t be a knight in shining armour,” Jim said quietly, walking back to his friend.
Unlike the other two previous episodes, there are no little sidenotes between bigger case posts. The boys are swept off their feet by this case and have no time do anything else. The timeframe is very short between the two posts. TGG probably started the same day TBB episode ended, or maybe the next, with only a 4 day gap between TBB and TGG posts. Still, John apologizes for the delay!
John was the first to speak. “If you don’t mind me asking…uh, Sherlock, what are you doing out here?” he began tentatively. “Where are your servants, your guards, anyone?”
From that moment on, no one else bothered him. His meals appeared on a platter outside his bedroom whenever Sherlock decided to open his door and his bed was magically cleaned every time the sheets became too dirty.
“Mycroft, what can I do?” Sherlock asked as he ran after him. Mycroft kept his pace down the corridor towards his room, steadfastly ignoring his brother.
“What are we doing here, exactly?” Jim asked, swirling the glass of wine he had snagged from a passing waiter.
Feeling a bit disappointed, John wiped his sweaty forehead and began pulling his block towards the cart.
udy room either?!” Sherlock felt his eyes grow warm with impending tears. Why did they want to take Mycroft away from him?
The message was quick to reach the guards in the courtyard, and soon they were pushing open the gate. Sherlock felt as if his heart was trying to jump out of his throat when he saw the town slowly appear beyond the heavy doors.
ea-lion.” When his brother didn’t reply, he stomped his foot. “You were the one to come up with it!”
“I don’t mind, I’m used to it,” Jim reassured him with a gentle smile, “I was born fifteen years after my sister - an accident, so to speak. My mother was too old and tired to put any effort into raising me and my siblings were too busy to pay me any mind, so I grew up mostly by myself.” Jim’s warm gaze became distant as he recounted his story. “My journeys have given me a purpose, but I’ve always wished for something more…” He shook his head as he snapped out of his reverie. “Sorry, I’m probably boring you to death with my depressing story.”
Jim repeated and stood up quickly, offering his hand to help Sherlock up. He took it eagerly, not out of necessity but to please his new friend.
“You should relax, enjoy the evening,” he said, ignoring Sherlock’s eye-roll. “Londondalle is such a nice place, I can’t imagine anything bad ever happening here. The weather is lovely, the food is incredible and the people are so friendly,” he encompassed the entire kingdom with a wide sweep of his glass. ”I was smitten with the country as soon I stepped out of my ship.”
Mycroft smiled despite himself. Maybe he could take his break now, go outside for a bit. How bad could it be if he went and played with Sherlock for a little while? He’d be careful with his powers…
. Not just the soldier who will shoot monstrous hounds and power through Eurus’ maze, not the doctor who does locum work at the clinic and marries his nurse - the army doctor who is has seen violent deaths, the one who knows how to treat gun-shot victims in the field.
“A priceless necklace is missing, we must retrieve it!” he explained, making a beeline to his laptop.
Might as well go back to the embezzling case, Sherlock thought. The Work must not suffer. He returned to his seat at the desk and opened his laptop, delving back into the spreadsheet in front of him.
This chapter comes at a sad time for the Sherlock fandom. Una Stubbs, our dearest Mrs Hudson has passed away on the 12th of this month. This chapter is my humble tribute to her. Thank you for everything, dear lady, you will always have a special place in all of our hearts. <3
“Come, your Highness, let’s get you cleaned. Please excuse us!” he took Sherlock’s elbow and swiftly led him away, leaving Anderson to stare back at them in bafflement.
They let themselves still for a few moments, watching as their breaths condensed into white puffs and disappeared into the air.
Most importantly, John could see two adults covered in long dark cloaks, probably the horse's owners. His eyes widened in surprise when he realized that the frosty trail didn't come from them, but from a boy, about his age, that walked beside the man. The ice didn't stay on the ground for long here, instead it dissolved a few seconds after falling from the boy's hands.
A respectful silence settled in before the man’s clear voice rang through the Ballroom. “King Mycroft of Londondalle!” he declared.
The king struggled to maintain his footing as he reached the slippery rocks and made his way stumbling towards the water’s edge. With nowhere left to run, he stepped in the gently leaping water, still trying to find a way to escape. Suddenly, he heard the familiar crackle of ice forming under his feet and he realized he wasn’t standing in the water but
“Oh, bugger off,” Sherlock countered distractedly, his attention already engaged in the pages before him.
A cold wave of dread spread through Mycroft’s body as soon as the royal crown was placed on his head. He tightened his jaw and forced his eyes open once again, standing to face the Bishop, who stared sternly back. Mycroft took a steadying breath and squared his shoulders as the old man turned once again to the altar. Although the Londondallian Royal Crown was a simple gold circlet, sparingly decorated with pearls, rubies and sapphires, the new king was keenly aware of the weight on his head.
His own little blizzard, Sherlock thought, despondently. Well, if he died from taking the concoction, at least he’d have the last consolation of tripping Mycroft with his corpse on his way out of his room.
Sherlock chanced a glance downwards, but the window remained resolutely closed. Honestly, how could someone so young act like such an old man?
Mycroft stifled a yawn as he turned another page on his Economics textbook. He still had another chapter to go before he could rest.
Mrs Turner had been dismissed as soon as he had turned eight-years-old, sent away with a brilliant letter of recommendation to pursue a new job with the royal family of an allied country. Despite her fixation with boring things like bed-time, proper meals and what constituted an actual toy (which, she insisted, the suits of armour definitely did not), Sherlock had to admit that Mrs Turner’s absence left a large hole in his already unremarkable life.
For the story to move forward we need Sherlock to trust John with his life (his bleeding heart, literally) and for John to be the army doctor so he can be the one to save him.
John mulled this information for a moment before continuing, “But the coronation… Wasn’t that today?”
Sherlock was lying in his bed, eyes closed and humming to himself, happily riding the coattails of his latest high, when a thick envelope was dropped on his chest. He sat up in disoriented alarm, eyes wide and arms flailing about, before he realized that Mycroft was standing next to his bed, looking as calm and collected as ever.
“Your Majesty, the Prime Minister of Gaulia,” the Master of Ceremonies announced, interrupting him. Reminding himself to remain civil, Sherlock swallowed down his frustration and faced the guests with a neutral expression.
In that moment, two white bursts of energy shot from his hands and hit the marble floor with a slam. A multitude of ice shards erupted upwards, sharp and menacing.
The guard kept his stunned silence and Sherlock started to feel his temper rise. “You’ll still catch him if you hurry. I can give you a description!” he pointed at the window.
Sherlock screamed in frustration. Damn this Palace and damn these walls! If only he was a little higher up, he could see over the tower...
he continued, making some heads turn to look at the finely dressed man standing on top of the parapet.
It was already nighttime when they reached their destination. Sherlock parked their rental car by a depressing looking three-story building, the only inn in the village.
Jim walked calmly up to him and placed his hands on his shoulders, holding his companion in place. Sherlock gave a nervous sigh as Jim locked eyes with him.
Sherlock’s heart was pounding in his chest by the time he reached the main staircase. The main hall was crowded with staff, busily setting new candles and depositing flowers on every horizontal surface. His eyes drank in all the activity going on below and his limbs screamed at him to take part in the action. Sherlock smiled delightedly when he realized that, today, he could.
Mycroft climbed purposefully up the stairs, not doubting for one moment that the staircase would support his weight. He continued his song at full volume, revelling in this newly found sense of freedom.
Sherlock giggled delightedly and grabbed the boat’s bow with one hand, still pointing his sword with the other “Of course! We will defeat our enemy and find the
John stood by the water channel, his little ice chisel forgotten in his hands. He was perplexed by the sound of the voices reverberating in the quiet valley, the words ressonating in his mind.
“Well, look at it this way,” he told the guard, “if you catch that dastardly criminal all by yourself, maybe you’ll get a medal. I’m sure that would be enough for your wife to stop sleeping with your neighbor.”
Sherlock was jolted awake by the sound of Mrs Turner pointedly pushing back the curtains on the nursery’s window. He shut his eyes firmly and burrowed in his bedsheets in preparation against her usual orders to get up and stop laying about and some other nonsense about early birds and worms.
The other man gave no sign of acknowledgement as he steered Harry off the snowbank and onto firmer ground, forcing the prince to jog after the pair.
Had he not been so focused on galloping after his brother and into the supernaturally cold night, he might have remembered that a light cotton suit and kidskin gloves were not adequate clothing to face a snowstorm.
At least John’s fear of re-capture had been allayed. Hudson had reassured him that it was unlikely the gang would search for them once it was discovered that they had escaped. The gang members would be too fearful of arrest to follow them, ruffians such as they rarely sought out people to rob; they usually victimized those with whom they happened to cross paths. Also, they would be pre-occupied with their leader’s dire condition.
Amidst the excited buzz, Sherlock stood on the wharf along with the rest of the crew, careful to bring no attention to himself. His eyes were drawn to John though; he stilled in a moment of fascination watching the morning sun, glorious in a blue sky scrubbed clean by wind and rain, reflect the gold of John's hair and light up the deep blue of his eyes, framed by golden lashes. It struck Sherlock in that moment what a beautiful boy John was and not just in his appearance. John appeared to glow with something brighter than sunlight, there was an essential goodness that radiated from some inner light source all John's own, that in Sherlock's eyes for a moment eclipsed even the brilliance of the Mediterranean sun. Sherlock shook his head and blinked at his absurdly poetic thoughts. Good grief! He had always dismissed poetry as ridiculous and now he was spouting it like Lord Byron? It must be due to the head injury...
Now though, John said nothing to Sherlock or Hudson of his growing distress, determined as he was not to be any more of an encumbrance or nuisance to them than he was already. Perhaps, he thought desperately, he could creep outside the entrance of the cave to rest once the other two men were asleep; surely it wouldn’t be any colder outside the cave than in it.
John strained his eyes desperately hoping to see the light of a cottage or other dwelling where they might ask for shelter. He hadn’t much hope given that the night was well advanced by now and most inhabitants of Gelibolu would be long abed.
John secured a carbolic acid soaked gauze and bandage to Lord Holmes' head, relieved to find that the wound was not deep. He knew the importance of keeping wounds clean, however, and made sure that Lord Holmes gash was thoroughly disinfected before he bandaged it.
Lord Holmes greeted John with a pleased smile but immediately resumed his pacing. Taking the cup that Hudson pressed into his hand, he swallowed tea absently and said, "In fact, Hudson, I could use your assistance..." but stopped upon catching the long-suffering expression on his valet's face and exclaimed, "But I need an assistant!"
The Captain gone once more, Lord Holmes rolled his eyes in irritation. "God, I hate sailing," he exclaimed. "Hudson, we are never going to sea again. I don't care what bloody Mycroft wants! The sooner we are back on solid ground, the better!"
Their arrival forced John out of his melancholy state.  He determined to make the most of the time that he had with Lord Holmes on this journey and do his best to make him proud. It was the least he could do after all that Lord Holmes had done for him.
His attacker roared in frustration and was raising an arm preparing to punch John in the face again when suddenly he vanished from John’s sight in a rush of cold mountain air; John found himself looking up at only the night's stars from his position on his back in the dust. But the man hadn't vanished, rather he had been torn from John by an enraged Sherlock who, flying at them out of the night like a demon freed from hell had snatched and flung John’s attacker into the darkness, only to follow the man, bent on finishing him.
Morning's arrival did nothing to dispel the persistent chill in the air; the sunrise was filtered weakly through a bank of heavy grey clouds which had bloomed up from the not too distant coastline overnight. Perhaps another storm was brewing out at sea; the restless breeze that tugged at their clothes as they picked their slow way down the rocky, steep hillside toward Gelibolu certainly suggested it.
He was one significant step closer to England, his main goal, although admittedly it had not been at the forefront of his mind for the last several days.  Nevertheless, to land on English soil was still the thing he desired most, wasn’t it? It was but somehow it didn’t hold the lustre it had before.  England, yes, but he found himself thinking that he would only be happy if he was with Lord Holmes.   If not to stay with him, at least to be able to see him sometimes.
It was two days after the his stepfather's tirade over his schooling that John, heeding a sixth sense, halted in the darkness on the cellar stairs upon hearing a stranger's voice coming from his stepfather's study. Unbeknownst to his stepfather, he was in the cellar to collect a jar of the applesauce that Molly had given him which was to be his mid-day meal. His stepfather had returned home unexpectedly at luncheon; the reason, it was clear, was to meet with the unknown caller who was with him in his study. John strained to hear what was being said, but he was able to make out very few of the words spoken. He heard his name, followed by raised voices, seemingly arguing about money. With the hair prickling on the back of his neck, John tried to hear more of the conversation but he could make out nothing further. Perhaps his stepfather was drawing them into more debt with an ill-advised loan he thought despairingly.
Bidden to enter, he made his announcement, "The Captain's regards sir, we've spotted land to the west and also another vessel."
At John’s expression of alarm Hudson explained, “He’s not feverish, it is merely the names of baritsu kicks and punches.” He added, “I can see he is settling now, I suggest you stay with him while I find the kitchen. There will be a brick or stone near the fireplace which we can wrap in a cloth to warm him further.”
“I suggest not, Master John,” Hudson advised calmly. “We’ll be stopping shortly anyway to wait for dawn and daylight.  We are only going as far tonight as to be beyond the reach of… possible pursuers. ”
Once breakfast was finished and his injured back once more attended to, John, comfortably and handsomely dressed in a new linen shirt and light-weight broadcloth trousers, was bidden to go above deck to take in the fresh sea air. Once there, he paused to watch the early sunlight reflect up from the sea in what looked like a fountain of diamonds glistening against the Wind Shadow’s pristine white hull.  As he strolled past the wheelhouse, John was surprised to receive a courteous nod from a seaman polishing brass.  He was unaware that Hudson, at Lord Holmes direction, had informed the Captain that John was now a guest of his Lordship and was to be treated accordingly.
It was not to be. They discovered too late that they were not the first to seek shelter in the structure. As they stepped through the open door, to their astonishment they found themselves surrounded by a group of shadowy figures. Men, it turned out; threatening characters who were obviously up to no good, hiding as they were from strangers.
John’s next awareness was of being passed from Sherlock’s arms to Hudson’s.  He struggled to right himself, mumbling, only half awake, that he intended to stand and walk.
At that the small company parted ways and Hudson led them to one of a number of sleeping cars beyond the salon.  When they reached the one reserved for them, John was ushered into a palatial compartment with the reassurance from Hudson that Lord Holmes’ room was beside his and Hudson’s, at the end of the carriage.
John could hardly force himself to leave the room so great was his desire to stay with Sherlock but he knew he must obtain medical supplies; it was vital to Sherlock’s survival that his wound be treated correctly. He thought he detected a flicker of awareness in Sherlock’s face when he bent over him one final time before departing, but when Sherlock’s eyes didn’t open he decided he had been mistaken.
John looked up at Sherlock urgently, "And you, sir, you need more medical care then I can give you here… stronger disinfectant and stitches …"
The port of Mytilene with its small harbour was charming.  It was edged by a glistening white sand beach upon which the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean lapped invitingly.  This was the pretty beach of Tsamakia, known for its variety of sea shells and delightfully warm water.
Hudson bent toward him to say quietly, “We’ve little money left I’m afraid. M’lord’s possessions being gone as they are, it’s left us with not much to go on.” He was trying to hide his concern but John was fully aware of the seriousness of their situation, if without adequate funds.
Although astounded at this speech, John did not question Lord Holmes change of mind. He simply nodded and awaited further instructions; the first of which was to don the ill-fitting sailor's uniform handed to him. He then assisted Hudson to pack the articles that they would need on their journey over the low mountain range that lay between and Sarköy and Gelibolu. John took responsibility for their medical supplies, packing carefully as he knew a fall or other accident could easily occur in the rugged terrain surrounding Sarköy, and there would be no assistance available along the isolated ways they would follow. He then assisted Hudson to pack blankets, candles, matches and rope. Hudson informed John that they would purchase enough food and water from the villagers to carry with them. The trip would take three days. John had little to pack of his own possessions although he carefully rolled up his new clothes and his old canvas coat in a small pack.
In this manner the morning wore on, the boat floundering in the now sluggish waves of the dying storm. John and Hudson, in between caring for their patients, worked to put the cabins to rights and clear broken glass and crockery while Lord Holmes, back in his own cabin once more, dragged out and began to study a stack of maps and charts with single-minded intensity.
Putting an exploratory hand to his head and seeing it come away bloody, Lord Holmes nevertheless shrugged his shoulders and appeared as though he intended to leave again now that he had found John to be safe and sound.
It hasn’t on me, thought John, it has been happiest time of my life, but he said nothing. It was kindly meant of course and it served to only make him love Lord Holmes all the more that he should think of John’s comfort in this way.
Glancing over his shoulder at Hudson and Sherlock now, John sighed with relief. Then, reluctantly, because he was enjoying his sense of contentment, he decided it would be wise to rest.  Loath to give up the view, he sank down into the cushioned chair beneath the porthole from which he could still see the starlit sky, wanting to prolong the peaceful spell that the night had woven around him.
“What was the outcome of the matters we discussed yesterday regarding John’s…er… unfortunate adventures in Constantinople, Hudson?”
A tall, handsome young man joined the group. Attractive yes, but, John immediately noted, blue eyes as cold as his Aunt’s.
John shuddered involuntarily at the memory of the soldiers.  Hudson, although not mistaking the reason for John’s frightened reaction, responded lightly with, “There’s no reason to be concerned about missing our way in the dark, Master John.  His Lordship has eyes like a cat at night, be it London alleys or mountainsides, it’s all the same to him.”
Around mid-morning, John had joined Lord Holmes to drink a cup of coffee and eat the omelette which Hudson had managed to prepare for them in what remained of the galley, when the first mate, acting on orders from the Captain who was fully occupied trying to keep the boat afloat, knocked on Lord Holmes' cabin door with a message.
It was then with a start that Sherlock realized his mistake: the man was stupid yes, but cunning. His expression dissolved into pure greed when he thought he was unobserved; his eyes locked on John and his face slackened with lust. Sherlock, alarmed, glanced quickly at John, hoping he hadn't noticed the man's attention. But John's cheeks were pale under his tan, his breathing was shallow and his left hand was trembling. He's terrified, realized Sherlock, furious with himself for not observing the situation sooner. He tried now to make eye contact with John, to reassure him, but John had withdrawn into himself, feeling helpless and vulnerable, which he is all too used to, thought Sherlock angrily.
Once rested and following another walk on deck, John rejoined Lord Holmes and set to work translating Latin once more. The breakthrough moment occurred in the late afternoon, when, with an elated clap of his hands and with an expression of excited delight, Lord Holmes leapt up and began digging through one of the piles of papers, selecting some and throwing others aside. "John! That's it, that's how it works! We've got it! Do you see?"
As it turned out, Lord Holmes was correct, which was starting to be no surprise to John. It was indeed the villagers from Sarköy approaching, not the Barbary corsairs John so feared. Lord Holmes, obviously having anticipated something of the kind occurring, was a whirlwind of activity in the minutes before the fishing boats reached the gunnels of the stricken Wind Shadow. Having engaged the Captain in a rapid planning session upon his arrival at his cabin, Lord Holmes had then emptied the ship's safe and instructed Captain Barrow to distribute the considerable amount of gold and bank notes among the crew members. He explained that once rescued and ashore, he and Hudson intended to proceed overland to Gelibolu as soon as possible but that the crew should wait in Sarköy for the arrival of the weekly mail steamer that would ferry them to Gelibolu. From there, they would proceed by ship to Athens. From Athens, their passage home to England would be arranged by the Marquis of Bosham's agent in London. The Captain was to remain responsible for the well-being of the crew for as long as they chose to remain in the employ of the Marquis. The cash dispersal would assist them to purchase anything they may require before they reached home (the amount of money distributed to each astounded John, who could have lived comfortably for years on such a sum).
John looked at his feet miserably, he hated to be a nuisance and a burden but he couldn't under any circumstances bring himself to consider separation from Lord Holmes. "I won't slow you down, I swear. I'm very tough and I can help you…"
Seeing that he was awake, Lord Holmes leaned forward and spoke quietly, "John, I'm Lord Holmes, although I think you already know that. I want to assure you that there is no need to be afraid. I mean you no harm. We are alone in the cabin but there is no one on this vessel who will harm you either, you may take my word for that." When John didn't reply, he continued, "Hudson is not nearly as fearsome as he appears. At present, he is preparing something for you to eat." He glanced at the side table. "I'd like you to try to sit up and take a sip of the wine when you feel able, alright?"
Major Williams had spent all of John's education funds on himself leaving none of it for John's benefit. That he was now financially broke was entirely due to his own drinking and gambling habits. He was so much in debt, in fact, that he had had to sell most of their possessions and John knew of little left that was of any value.
The couple was not aware that a sandy haired youth, to all appearances just a boy, was perched silently above the arbour in one of the many ornamental cedars that surrounded the garden, listening to the exchange below. John, the observer in the tree, hadn't intended to eavesdrop. He often came to this place to think when he needed peace and quiet. The scent of the ever-blooming roses soothed him; reminding him of his mother, now long dead. He was not accustomed to company.
"I will kill him!" came the almost unrecognizable hiss of Sherlock's voice, sounding frighteningly like the demon John had imagined.
"I beg your pardon, John," Lord Holmes said quietly, touching an apologetic hand briefly to the top of John’s head, "I'm merely expressing frustration over a case that is taking far longer than it should to solve."
Finding this request impossible to refuse, John reluctantly complied. He very much wanted to stay with Lord Holmes, who he was certain was not an experienced sailor but could do nothing but follow Hudson to the boat's sick quarters. He was soon taken up in providing what medical treatment he could to the injured sailors. The Wind Shadow was well stocked with up-to-date medical supplies so he and Hudson were able to make them reasonably comfortable. Several times over the next few hours he asked Hudson about Lord Holmes and each time he was patiently assured that his Lordship was well.
Hudson didn’t appear to notice his confusion, “As you suggest then, do what you can, Master John, we’ll await your return.”
Distractedly, for John had his own troubles on his mind, he wondered at the gentleman's extravagant compliments to Lady Adler. Foolish fellow, he thought. Lady Adler might appear sweet and genuine in her affections but she was, in fact, not only the most unfaithful of the diplomats' wives staying at the embassy but also a ruthless schemer. If Lord Holmes thought he was enjoying just another of his many highly gossiped-about affairs with simply a bored diplomat's wife, he was seriously mistaken.
John obliged.  Now that Sherlock was treated and resting well, he felt weariness begin to creep up on him again.  He would have gratefully curled up in the room’s one chair but when he made a move toward it, as he had once before Sherlock put out a hand and drew him gently to the bed.
John himself did not have the option of evening wear but he was scrubbed clean, his hair neatly barbered by Hudson and although he was painfully thin and his leg and back clearly stiff, his tanned cheeks and sun-lightened hair gave him an adventurous air. His deep, blue eyes shone with happiness and his manners, Hudson observed, were faultless.
“He hasn’t ever had a chance to be a boy, Hudson.  He should have that, and not be worried about looking after me.”
John at nearly eighteen was well aware of what sexual arousal felt like but he had never experienced it in another's presence. This was new and…. alarming. It seemed to be sweeping over him with the force of lava erupting from a volcano.  His soft feeling of serenity was twisting rapidly into a fierce urge to supplicate his body before Sherlock; fiery need was burning up his quiet sense of contentment and his soothing sensation of warmth was giving way to a writhing heat. The force his desire took his breath away and before he knew what was happening it had taken over not only his body but his mind as well, as unbidden images flooded his brain…. Sherlock rising above him, mastering him, his bright eyes blazing over John's exposed heart and soul, owning him as he strained hard and purposefully between John's spread thighs…
John, in severe distress, clung tightly to his saviour. It was too terrible to find himself in perilous danger once more when he had thought himself safe at last. The threat was made all the worse by having met Lord Holmes whose respect and affection toward him contrasted so greatly with the awful experiences of his former life. The thought of returning to the hell he'd escaped was all the more terrible for this. Now too, held in the security of Lord Holmes' arms, the possibly of being handed over to someone like the disgustingly depraved man who had touched him in his stepfather's study was unthinkable. The wonder of this comfort from Lord Holmes, which to anyone else would have been perceived as merely kindly paternal affection, was a revelation to John. It made the possibility of being pawed or much worse by another man, an incalculable horror. John was utterly distraught and beyond reason.
“Very fruitful, Sir.  I sent several correspondences, as you requested, and I believe everything has been taken care of.”
Sherlock raised John carefully so he could cut his bonds and free his arms.  This brought a gasp of pain from John as his shoulder took the full weight of his arm again.
John was indeed being dragged away from Sherlock and Hudson.  Terror rising in his throat, he resisted his abductor, digging his heels into the ground, but it was unable to obtain a solid purchase on the sand smoothed rock. It was just out of sight of the fire that he found himself thrown to the ground, stunned almost senseless from the force of his landing.   He had no chance to recover before the soldier threw himself on top of him.
Never mind, he thought fiercely as he made his way slowly from the cedar to the apple tree that overhung the embassy's garden wall. Tomorrow, if everything went as planned, he would escape Constantinople aboard Lord Holmes' sleek private yacht the Wind Shadow to a safer and better life. The yacht was now moored at the city's busy docks but as John had just heard she would tomorrow be setting sail for England. He intended to be on-board, well hidden and safe at last from his stepfather before she began the first leg of her journey home. He had no time for morose thoughts; he must move quickly to make his preparations for the trip and say goodbye to Molly.
John’s heart sank when he heard this.  His hope of spending more time with Sherlock was dashed by the unexpected appearance of Duchess Lewisham and Lord Westrey.  He felt the misery of it down to his toes.
John, basking in the affection and warmth that enveloped him, felt a little like the sea tortoises he'd seen on occasion by the shore of the Bosphorus; floating, suspended in the warm water, safely hidden in gently waving sea grass.  He let go of conscious thought and basked in physical and emotional bliss. Happiness and contentment flowed through him, warming every part of his body making him hum with pleasure and… what was that? Something else… Oh. Excitement. That kind of excitement.
But what a silly dream that was! He’d been a fool to fall in love with his rescuer! He must accept Lord Holmes’ kindness and affection in the spirit in which it was offered and be grateful.  He had no right to wish for more.  Lord Holmes was simply carrying out what he believed was his duty toward John, whom he believed to be no more than a child.  He’d said so himself that first night on the Wind Shadow.  He was grateful for John’s help on the journey, of course, but that didn’t change the fact that John was ultimately just a social responsibility. Any noblemen of good character, which by now John knew without a doubt Sherlock was, would have done no less.  Therefore the sooner John quashed this foolish dream of remaining at Sherlock’s side forever, the better!
The two below John in the garden were now locked in a passionate embrace which caused John to look away in irritation. Of all places, why had they chosen the location that he considered to be his sanctuary for their illicit liaison? Not that he wanted to examine the cause of his annoyance, after all, what did he care who Lord Holmes chose to give his obviously exceptional kisses to? (Obviously exceptional based on the sighs emanating from Lady Adler). The information he had overheard regarding Lord Holmes' travel plans was invaluable to him.
"Thank you, Hudson." Sherlock said quietly, sounding almost himself once more as he straightened his jacket sleeves. He then strode over to John, who was still lying motionless where his attacker had left him, too weak to move beyond an attempt to cover himself where his trousers had been torn. Once he had understood he was no longer in danger he had focused his will on trying to regain enough strength to sit up but hadn’t quite managed it yet. As it turned out it wasn't necessary. He found his nakedness covered by Sherlock's seaman’s jacket and light fingers brushed his bruised forehead and cheek as Sherlock asked him urgently how badly hurt he was.  At this close proximity even in what little light there was, John could see the both shock and fear in Sherlock’s expression. John tried to reassure him by opening his mouth to speak, but his voice refused to function and no sound came.
"John," Sherlock's gaze met John's again and he lifted his hand to touch John's cheek lightly, "Just trust me, it will be alright." He turned, "Hudson?"
None of it was true of course, John's late father had left a considerable amount of money to his wife and infant son, but once John's mother, always a delicate woman and desperately lost without John's father, had been bullied into marrying the Major, she had lost control of the money. Grief-stricken and hopeless she had succumbed to her weak health and had died while John was still very young.
"Good, we haven't much time. Their mate is likely dying, it won't take long. When he does they'll want to even the score."
John managed to rally his fuzzy thoughts and mumble, "I had to leave home in Constantinople and I cannot go back. I was planning to go ashore in Athens and then to take a seaman's job perhaps on a merchant ship and work my way back to England. That's all."
John intended to stay awake but of course did not.  Of the three, only Lord Holmes remained awake; no longer reading, if indeed he ever had been, but gazing at John with such an expression of tender affection on his face that anyone of his acquaintance would have been quite astounded to see it.
With his supplies in hand, John returned to the inn in full haste.  In all, by the time he was clambering through the window of their room, he judged he had been gone less than an hour.
John held on to Hope as those blue flames danced about his lover’s head. Nothing would save the Cupid responsible for those lights. Obsession. John felt his wings heat at the challenge, not for Sherlock’s heart! John knew that was his but for his… attention, as childish as it sounded, for his focus, that extraordinary mind. The obsession was trying to take it over.
Job done and report sent off, by John as Sherlock was happy to make his brother wait, John had to wonder again about spy bugs and code phrases and how he might be living in a spy novel with the madman, Sherlock Holmes.
“It’s an interesting case John.” “I’m a BattleCupid Mike, just because I got shot doesn’t make me a baby sitter, how at war can one man be. It’ll be a few weeks of couple’s therapy and he will have her back, right as rain.” “John.” Mike said patiently for the third time. “He’s at war. His heart is at war with his mind and his body. His soul is shutting down John. He is trying desperately not to let himself feel, let alone be loved. He’s just out of rehab, uppers so his heart has physically been under strain and there’s been so much nonsense from his childhood.” Mike pursed his lips. “Mike how bad can it be?” John chuckled at the strained look, it didn’t suit the GuideCupid who was an endless fount of patience and of course Love. “He’s Mycroft Holmes’ brother.” John and Mike exchanged a look. Mycroft Holmes had waged a quiet campaign against Cupids in the government, claiming their emotional focus was illogical and ill suited to serious work. Very few people knew of Cupids as they blended in well but Love Save the man or woman who was caught out by Mycroft because they always lost credibility. “So, not a babysitter then?” “No John not a babysitter but there’s a heart that needs to be saved. Okay?”
After two logical arguments; one Sherlock's, the other John's and one lengthy sulk, all Sherlock's. It was agreed that Sherlock's rank would be used on all military bases as it would be the most efficient and was also slightly more intimidating.
Sherlock studied his new flatmate, clearly a Cupid like Mrs Hudson but was John on assignment or just looking for a place to stay. Sherlock’s mind coiled in on itself, he didn’t need fixing and Mrs Hudson had been the only one whose help he had accepted; when he had just returned from rehab and felt so overwhelmingly lonely. The heart support she had given by wrapping him in rarely manifested wings, it had hurt to feel so much but he had been able to breath again after a few hours. She loved him like a mother and the memory still made his eyes burn before he could shove it back down. John however just trotted about seeming quite content or was it Sherlock who was content to have the army doctor beside him and always just one pace behind him when he raced through London. Sherlock suspected that John might be causing his contentment and he couldn’t figure out why it bothered him so much that John might be here on assignment, might not actually just be here for him. The state and position of John’s wings would tell him so he snuck off to his room to fetch the sonar scanner he had doctored, it was all a question of frequencies and his field tests had been successful so far. The sonar’s pulse shifted the molecules in the wings from the invisible frequency of Feelings to the frequencies of visible light. There were at least seven other Cupids in the area apart from Mike Stamford and Hudders. The scan seemed to have some noticeable affect on the subject but John was distracted by preparing supper, so just a quick check wouldn’t do any harm.
Hand in hand with his Lovely, John approached the bastard who’s love was only for himself and had become a poison. John watch him try to breathe around the pain. “Yeah, breathing is a bit of a bitch with that injury. I’ve had one similar myself.” Doors opened and Ian, Mrs Hudson, and almost every other Cupid in the city slowly filed into the room. A battle like this would have reverberated through the frequency of Feelings for miles and now it had to end. Mrs Hudson had seniority in the flock and she simply shook her head at James Nicolas Moriarty before turning her back on him and beckoning Sherlock out with her. John nodded Sherlock after her and the other London BattleCupids joined John in surrounding the fallen one. Ian placed a hand on John’s shoulder. “Go, we’ve got this. You got the bastard John, we’ll clean up. Go to yours.” John nodded tiredly and turned to leave as Ian and five more joined hands and began to beat their wings. Moriarty burned in the fires of six sets of wings, there would be nothing left.
"Bed? What for? I'm not tired." Sherlock was blushing more in the light as he'd watched John eat from the same spoon he'd fed him with. Feeling those lips, the strong edge slightly of teeth from his firm jaw as he sucked off the slender fingers. He felt John hoist him up easily and grip his round arse in his strong hands. "A am I not heavy? I I have gained you know." He said bashfully. "You feel great Sherlock, just perfect." John got them to the bedroom and slid his blushing genius onto the bed.
Fortunately for Sherlock he was his own best company for the salacious appreciation of John Watson-Holmes and John really truly did enjoy being appreciated, so he was busy chuckling to himself over the appreciation they had enjoyed on the stairs last night when a dishcloth flopped onto his grinning face. “Yes, it was a spectacular shag. You’ve been staring at the stairs for the last two minutes came here and help me instead.”
Sherlock could see John gloriously burning with a passion he knew was for him but now he saw Moriary as Cupid too and the hideous wings he raised sent revulsion through Sherlock’s heart. He stepped around his previously fascinating adversary and timed his steps with John’s steady wing beats. Standing beside his Beloved, Sherlock chose, he chose the Love of John Watson over the twisted obsession Moriarty had clearly been pushing on him. Brave John hadn’t blamed him, he had just patiently stood beside Sherlock, loving him and he felt his heart burn with their shared passion. Settling against John’s side he unbound John’s hands then rested his cheek against silver-blonde hair as the red and gold of John’s fire swelled to a triumphant white hot inferno. The walls rang with Moriarty's outrage.
. His hand slid into surprisingly soft curls and John hummed approval as long fingers twitched carefully as the hem of his jumper. A sigh escaped as perpetually cold hands roamed over his back pulling him against Sherlock who leaned back too fast and almost toppled them over.
Sherlock exhaled and ignored his flushed ears, Lestrade was watching so he needed to be calm. This would go smoothly: evidence, deduction, tedious explanation, home to John! He flew through the gore strewn room. 3 dead, but 2 killers! Oh God sentiment. “They were going to kill her husband and run away together but she had second thoughts so he kills her in a panic, the husband then kills the lover for killing his wife and dies from the injuries the murderous lover gave him. BORING! I have better places to be Lestrade. The evidence is in their phones, don’t call me!” His hasty exit made him miss how Greg grinned at his retreating back.
The Blind Banker was next, I told the tale of Chinese smugglers but left out nearly getting my employer killed. I may have also omitted sending drifts of fear into our captors. It was just a few feathers push and I certainly had plenty fear to spare. Sherlock showed up to save the day just in time and stayed to comfort rather than chase the bad guys. I was so proud of him.
Sherlock had emailed Mycroft a report during their trip home including the phrase, I needed it and now John knows. There had been no reply but he hadn't expected one, passive aggressive might be his brother's second language but stilted silence would always be his first.
John lay in bed remembering a sweet weekend and an even sweeter Sherlock. It had been weeks since they had danced and dined, long over due in his opinion. “Could you make sure you get home at a reasonable hour please Lovely. I’ve got a surprise planned for the weekend and.” A scrambling sound interrupted John who was cackling by the time his husband was back on the phone. “Did you drop your phone Love?” “No, of course not.” His barely restrained laugh wasn’t fooling Anyone so John calmly continued. “I have a surprise planned for the weekend, you know it’s your birthday, and it’s nothing extravagant but I would like you home soon please?” John had worked late that night and the previous few evenings in fact to save up hours, for a very good cause naturally. Sherlock had mentioned he’d long ceased celebrating his birthday and John was determined to fix that.
Sherlock held onto the wing, planted his foot and pulled John over as he rocked into the touch. John gave a sharp cry at the shocking sensation, yanking the wing against his body he curled around it before fading them and lying back as a tremor ran through him. “Oh Beloved! Oh my Beloved I’m so sorry!” Sherlock eased himself off of the startled Cupid and held him close. “I was too rough, I’m sorry John.” “It’s alright Sherlock, bit of a shock is all.” They finished up in a tender embrace Sherlock wrapped a leg over John’s hips and held on as John rocked slowing into him, bringing them both off with breathless gasps.
Sherlock snuggled closer to the wings that now lay on top of him every night. He was keeping his John! His concerns that it was too early had been brushed aside when he’d escorted Mrs Hudson to her shopping so a gorgeous gold ring was waiting in his bed side drawer, but what better time than now! “John?”…
He draped both of the legs on offer around his waist and leaned over a suspiciously pliant genius. “I know you’re planning something.” “But you can enjoy me while you figure it out.” That went straight to John’s groin, no point in denying it. Sherlock squeezed and a plush bum brushed John’s now very interested erection. “Distracting me.” “Well it is working. Leave the deductions to me John." Sweet lips claimed John’s mouth as Sherlock sat up into his lap. “Please Beloved?” John was doomed so he surrendered and slid his hands down to pull at Sherlock’s pants.
John watched Moriarty spread his malformed wings as the object of his obsession rejected him and then the idiot raised a gun, swinging the barrel towards Sherlock. He wasn’t even looking at John who pulled his Browning from Sherlock’s waistband and put a bullet through Moriarty’s right shoulder, the sick one went down screaming.
John woke late the next morning with a bed-octopus curled sweetly around him, he would never figure out how Sherlock grew extra limbs in his sleep but every one of them would be wound around him by morning. “Happy Birthday Husband” A scratchy groan answered his whispered greeting. John wriggled closer somehow. “Happy staycation Lovely.” “Beloved, my Beloved.” John waited for the rest of Sherlock’s sentence but it never came, those fascinating eyes slid shut and Sherlock drifted back to sleep.
. It had been two years since John Watson had killed Moriarty in defending me.Two since the trial. He was found innocent, as in an act of protection and defense. It had been two years since John moved back into Baker Street. Two years since Sherlock Holmes officially quit smoking and nicotine patches.Two years since he gave up morphine and cocaine. Two years since he began to eat regularly and healthily to his astonishment, but with his help.To “Subside and feel the grief with John."To the detective's bewilderment he didn’t go back into the dating scene. John had said something to the fact of ‘Not wanting to make that mistake again.’ The pondering question of if Sherlock could ever tell him has arisen again. John will be home soon, Sherlock assumed he should just should stay here. in his Mind Palace.
Mrs Hudson didn’t have a mobile phone but Sherlock couldn’t message anyone. That had been the rule all along. It was just supposed to be the two of them, but the bomber had taken John so Sherlock went to the pool, tucking John’s gun into his waist band as he raced out the door.
