doesn’t. He wants me to stay here when he tells you. And you can thank my self-control I haven’t ripped you to pieces yet. Frankly, I can’t believe
“Okay.” Tony felt like crying when the fingers that stretched him disappeared. He whined and tried to rock his hips more as if it would bring them back.
He hoped he would come back because now it became evident that he had been his best chance to finally be loved, be accepted. The thing he had always wanted.
He would’ve almost laughed. Only Steve Rogers was able to be obnoxious enough to blame the hormones instead of reflecting his shitty behaviour. “No, Steve. You alpasplained me through my
He was too exhausted to protest and was at the moment just glad to have someone near him now, even though he knew this feeling was some Stockholm Syndrome Bullshit.
Tony shrugged. “As if he was the worst one. From all the Alpha’s I know, I’d give him a 6/10 in being an ass. And I mean what’s the alternative? Either I leave him and get a lawsuit for hiding my presentation or even worse, the PRO decides Justin Hammer would just be the perfect Alpha for me. Nah, I’m staying.”
“Strongest on the market. The CIA uses them for their Omega baits in case they need to seduce someone. It’s not a suppressant but you won’t get pregnant.”
“You will receive a set of rules now. Your genius brain is surely capable of recalling them by heart without writing down notes.”
There was only so much time Tony could give someone to adhere to the new modern world. Even if this special someone was an ice cube from the forties. The fact that Steve Rogers belonged to the part of Alphas Tony wanted gone only showed how old-fashioned the standards really were. He had had more than one fight with Rogers about the fact that Omegas ‘needed guidance’ and ‘needed protection’.
He had confronted her once, asked her why she was so nice to him because this was by God not the norm he had found out.
“It’s soup. Something an upset stomach can bear.I know it was not the best punishment for you. I made a mistake and I am sorry.”
It was nothing he hadn’t been prepared for. Well, more or less prepared for. He had learnt much at the seminars he had visited. He knew how to nurse, well, at least how to nurse in theory. His son would have to do the most of them both anyway.
“I… I am so sorry, alpha. I am so- I’m an idiot. Please, I… I’ll fix it.” He was bonded, he reminded himself. He belonged, he was wanted. He would get punished and then it would be over.
He had not even realized that he had not counted number nine. It had been a simple slip of his mind. But that didn’t matter, he thought bitterly.
He was startled when Steve’s hand was on his backside again, this time to soothe him. “Shh, it is over and you are forgiven. I am proud of you. You took your punishment so well, Omega.”
He nodded and stepped into the lift, hoping he could leave them both alone. He had come from Florida to New York just to check up on him and he would certainly do it again if he called Rhodey sighed. Only Tony could get himself into those messes. He could have stayed, of course, but he knew this would make Tony more trouble than it was worth. One unprofessional move and he would lose his military rank and with that any power to help Tony if things got even worse. No, leaving had been the right choice.
He frowned and clicked on the first hashtag. There were dozens of entries and he couldn’t help but smile. About graduation, about accomplishments and moments of independence. He liked all of the entries and put the phone back on the table. Just now he saw Steve’s expression.
had to admit that being held like this as an Omega did things to him. He felt sleepy, usually happy and could have happily dozed off to Steve rubbing little circles into his scalp. Sadly, this didn’t hold for long.
She nodded and waited until he was gone, then she sighed. “It’s always the same with those Alphas if you ask me. In most cases, they want to command everything and everyone but as soon as you are telling them about the gory details of childbirth they want to be everywhere but here.”
Tony needed a few moments until he saw that Steve was holding a spoon in his hands. A spoon with scrambled eggs on it. He had no idea why the hell he was insisting on food now, after all, he had just gotten a decent punch into his stomach. No optimal condition for eating.
“I don’t need a pillow fort, thank you,” he scoffed. No need to highlight his presentation, his bed would do just fine. It had nice, warm pillows in it and was comfortable.
In his distressed state, he hadn’t even noticed that Steve had stood up and approached him. He had woken up with the sentence
When Steve had explained to him he would receive rules he had thought he would get dragged into a corner and Steve would yell them into him. Instead, he had been told to get something to drink for himself and to sit at the table. That didn’t sound too bad so he had complied and was holding a steaming hot mug of coffee in both of his hands, looking at the (technically) older man. “So, you wanted to talk.”
After five minutes, Steve was done and came out with a towel around his hips. He looked very good. Tony hadn’t been able to really pay attention yesterday with his nervosity but now he could revel in the sight. he was toned, very muscular and his skin was a perfect shade of porcelain. All in all, he was glad he had enough self control to not jump on him right away.
“It’s twenty. You will count them. If I don’t hear you properly or if you stop, we will start all over again.” Steve said sternly before his features softened. “It will be my hand because you did as you were told. Otherwise, it would have been the paddle. As you can see, Tony, it is much easier when you just obey.”
The third option would be to call Rhodey, explain this shit to him and ask for his knot. No, totally not going to happen either. This was not debatable. First of all, this was a shitty favour he would ask of his best friend and second of all he didn’t want Rhodey to see him reduced to his basic biological instincts. Hell, he had just had one heat before his father had given him the suppressants and it had sucked.
Tony was scared he might be mad at him but as soon as Steve saw the pups every anger seemed to vanish.
“We don’t plan on interfering. But we need some information from one of the members. And undercover-”
This morning, the taste of his normal Starbucks order (a venti skinny latte macchiato with soy milk and two extra shots of espresso) had tasted stronger than usual. It had been almost unbearable to drink, and he still didn't know why. There was a weak link he wanted to draw but he shrugged it off almost immediately.
When he heard Steve growl lowly, his attention was brought back to him. Not that he could do much. All he could do right now was to hope Steve would fuck him now. Or not. Either way he wanted this decision to be made as soon as possible because he felt how he burned up even more. Although he hated Steve’s guts right now, he was impressed he could hold himself back this well. After all, he was sure his scent was extreme.
“Are you kidding me? You’re Tony Stark. You won’t tell me you’ll give up after less than a year to-”
And there was something else. There was something he longed for, something he needed. He was too muzzy to think the sentence to an end. He needed. He needed something and couldn’t quite name it. He knew it was his heat, although this knowledge got harder and harder to access. There was only the itching feeling, the longing.
He thought about it with a frown but shook his head. “I’ve got some kids now. It’s easier to just stay with him. And… well, hope he dies on a mission. And I mean it’s not that bad. He cares about me. More or less. I mean something to him. I mean, yes, he’s a control freak but at least he does it because he wants to protect me.”
business what I am eating and what I do with my tablets. And I meant every single word about you, just for your information.”
Tony didn’t answer. His head was facing the water. He knew what would come now. Normally, he would have panicked, screamed and tried to get away but somehow, he didn’t have the power to do even
“I…”, he sobbed and tried to stop so he could give Steve a normal answer. “I am sorry, I just… nightmare and Afghanistan and it… it was- It was real and then you had your-” he burst out into tears again and needed another moment. Steve let him take his time patiently. “And then you had your hand on my reactor and I thought-”
He had been more than indifferent when Steve had set his rules and when he had punished him. It had sucked but he had never felt so anxious before. Maybe because this was an extreme injustice. His only crime was his PTSD, not that Steve
There it was. Tony was too exhausted for this conversation. But last year he had gotten to know Steve better and he knew his way around words by now to keep him from losing his composure. “I know what you mean… Actually, I thought about it as well. But I think we should give them a chance to have their own name, you know? Since we two also started a new chapter in our life.”
Tony had needed English lessons from a private tutor, Dominique had been fired and to this day, he dreamed in French and not English. Not that Steve knew that. Tony didn’t like him enough to tell him these anecdotes.
“Okay,” he said bluntly. There was no way in hell he would have more than three children. He hadn’t wanted them in the first place, he didn’t want even more. Even
He knew there were other things he would have to think about as soon as he was out of here, but not now. Now his adrenaline was high and he was breathing heavily enough to be a worthy competitor of an asthmatic.
- sat next to his new Alpha, head held low. He didn’t talk and just remained in the same position. Judging by his make-up, he’d been allowed to freshen up a bit after his first night. The bonding mark was clearly visible, as was the despair in his eyes. Steve didn’t know what to think of it. Well, he did. This boy was merely a child, not old enough to get pulled into this shit, or any shit for that matter.
“Sure, Steve. Three pups are almost ripping me apart from the inside. But don’t worry, I am all good. Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy.” He took deep breaths like the nurse had said, trying to keep his mind clear at least.
“I was hoping you’d say that, Rogers. Now, I think we should discuss the formalities tomorrow. For now, you should probably go and discuss this.”
Tony wondered if Steve was thinking about this injustice too. And he wondered if this would finally make him realize what he’d done to Tony. He was disappointed to realize it wasn’t so but at least his Alpha pitied the teenager in front of them.
To him, it was really astounding how one single changing fact could ruin his reputation forever. Many articles analyzed his behavior and tried to link it to his nature as if it had been evident all along that he wasn’t a Beta. He knew they were merely doing this to relieve their conscience. After all, he knew how the press worked.
“You can do this after breakfast,” Steve said sternly although the bastard really had the audacity to make it sound like a proposition.
Immediately, he punched the intruder in his face and fell from the soft surface. Hectically, he tried to orientate himself as he moved back into a corner, his body still on the floor. He wanted to ensure there would be no one behind him.
“Wanna bet?” he asked. “Because I am pretty good at winning those.” With that, he activated the repulsor and aimed for Steve’s arm. It wasn’t anything deadly or remotely serious; merely a warning shot that would hurt like a bitch.
By the time Steve was allowed inside again Tony was exhausted. He knew they had to call Steve to scent the pups, but honestly; If it had gone according to
And although most Alphas assumed he was secretly jealous of their presentation, they couldn’t have been more wrong. By being a Beta, he could refuse to take part in this whole Alpha-Omega drama that was going on for decades now. The Omega Rights Movement had grown big in the 80s and hadn’t really stopped until now, although there had been little to no change since then.
“Listen to me-” Steve took a step towards him and Tony and Rhodey immediately stood and put himself in front of the former playboy.
“Yeah, because most of us can’t graduate college before some dickhead decides to knock us up.” He rolled his eyes and took the screwdriver in the other hand.
The first thing he noticed again, was how someone undressed him, relieving him at least from a part of heat. He sighed contently, not knowing why. His mind was racing, not comprehending what was happening. He was off suppressants, this was a literal fuck or die situation. Even in his state, he mused that this whole situation fucked him already up so much that he would probably survive the next 72 hours.
Tony bit back a sob of frustration. “Please, Steve. Please, Alpha, I need you inside me. Now. God, I’ll do anything, just-”
Of course, Steve could free himself from him rather quickly, he was a super soldier after all. Nevertheless, Rhodey had made his point clear. “You better go now,
“I was frustrated and desperate. it was not okay of me to lose control like that,” he continued. “But it’s done. All I can do is make it better.”
it only took ten more minutes for Tony only feeling the pleasure and nothing else. He was whining, begging and mewling, desperate to get knotted as many times as possible. Steve turned into Alpha, stop turned into more. When he finally felt like himself again, he was sore and disgusted. He realized he was kneeling in front of a tub. Steve looked at him, probably calculating whether his mind was still hazy or not. When he seemed to be sure Tony was back from his drug trip, he grabbed his neck, causing Tony to flinch at the sudden movement.
Having three kids to take care of at once was challenging but they were not that much work he had to admit. He was glad he hadn’t gotten three kids who would scream all the time or couldn’t be alone at all. No, it was like they knew he was struggling with it still. Most of the time they were either sleeping or playing with each other on the blanket Tony laid out for them. Of course, he played with them, too. Sometimes he would shake their rattles or do the classic peek-a-boo (it was something they very much liked). Most of the time,s though, he was working on his tablet. Steve was a dick. He had told him he could work eight hours a week (way too little and he knew that), but that the pups had to be his first priority, too. This meant he couldn’t go to the workshop without endangering them and that bastard knew it.
I'm not dead, just stressed. I am not giving up on this story or Eyes on Fire, I just need a break sometimes. So... enjoy!
He had already missed them. The fluffy things; The blankets and pillows and plush things, although he was sure it was only because his heat was approaching. Steve didn’t have to care about it in the first place but he was glad his alpha did care for him.
“Mrs. Gatehouse,” he nodded politely and gestured Tony to sit. The engineer waited until Steve himself was already seated. He was not a dog. “We came to you because Tony seems to have withheld his Omega nature from the Registration.”
Rhodey to stay for that talk since Tony didn’t want to know how bad it would get along with the other. Rhodey didn’t need much of persuasion. He didn’t want to leave his best friend alone with Rogers either.
Steve bit down his bonding gland until he tasted blood. Immediately he felt how their scents were mixing, how Tony’s scent was changing. Everyone would know now that he was his. Tony panicked and tried to push away. No. No. Just no. But before he could struggle any more, the hormones pushed him into an ecstasy he couldn’t quite fathom. The rush, the endorphins, the oxytocin… he knew about them theoretically, but experiencing this himself was unbelievable. Steve’s knot swelled almost at the same time, leaving Tony breathless and too overwhelmed to cope.
Like Steve had said earlier, the guilt fell from his shoulders. Maybe being an Omega had really its advantages. If he had been an Alpha in this situation he would have had abused his Omega and considering his strong attitude towards abuse he would have needed much of time to get over this fact.
me this way. Your attitude towards me and others will change now. You will treat me with respect and in exchange, I will make sure you will be cared for and that you stop being so self-destructive.”
“The problem is” Fury started to finally get the attention on him again. “That it is a very exclusive party. You need to apply for a spot and to be invited. And you need to be someone they want to have. Of course, they would never turn down Captain America.”
Finding a babysitter for the triplets had been easier than he had thought. Bruce was taking care of them and Tony was sure the Beta would do a decent job. He was more worried about Steve’s reaction when he’d find out Tony was at SHIELD instead of being the nice obedient stay-at-home Omega he wanted. Actually, he didn’t care that much. He could take punishments quite well by now.
“Every time ever since we met you don’t give a shit about if other people are comfortable as long as
When Fury had called he had felt like he was close to freedom. Now he knew it was even worse than he’d thought.
A sharp noise had him flinch. The glass he’d been washing up had slipped from his fingers and was covering the floor in shards. He stopped breathing. The whole world slowed down.
Tony had no idea how the whole scenting process worked but he was more than glad he was finally allowed to sleep a bit. The last few hours had been tough to say the least and his body demanded immediate rest.
It made sense now. The fever. The inability to concentrate. His hypersensitivity. The itching, the scratching, the- “No, no, no, no. Damnit, JARV, what the hell can I do now? Okay, uhm...”
“Omegist, yeah. He gets the picture.” Tony turned to Steve and looked at him, ready to spill the beans.
Ah, there it was again. The omegist view that Omegas couldn’t do shit. Tony sighed internally. Steven seemed to notice that and promptly continued.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You are not scary, Cap. I know you wanna be. And I know you think I would give a shit about your att- ah-!” Tony flinched when Steve pulled him up the chair. His coffee mug broke into a million pieces. Tony was shocked, to say the least, both startled by the noise and by the sudden movement. He got almost
Not the good kind of burning. And if he was really honest, not the bad kind either. He was just so hot, his skin was itching and he felt like he was spending the hottest day of summer in his winter jacket.
At the end his chest was not as tense as before and he went back to lying in bed. After another well-deserved nap, he heard a knock on the door and told whoever it was to come in. Probably Steve.
He would find a way to smuggle birth control into the tower. He would not get pregnant again. Maybe he couldn’t shut down his heat anymore, but he knew someone who could give him something to counter the effects of pregnancy now that he knew.
“That’s how it generally works, yes. If we do have pups, I would appreciate you taking care of them or us taking terms. We can split the chores if you want to. I’ll just be at work sometimes and-”
Rhodey had never questioned his desire to be independent. Also due to the fact he had thought he was a Beta, but even now he couldn’t see any difference in how he treated him.
alpha before who would want to miss the heat of his mate. But he figured Tony’s circles were quite different in that regard. Probably the reason why richer folks didn’t have too many children. “Look, I wanted to go to the store with you anyway. We need some things for you.”
He shoved it away, denied the signs and tried to keep working. Something of an odd feeling started to grow inside his stomach. A tickling. Probably the coffee. Maybe an intern had messed something up, not the Barista. Those students could not even distinguish the stock market points from their GPA.
“Excuse me?” Tony had done many things way over his comfort zone already but this? This was too much. “We have triplets at home who would like us back alive.”
After he’d ensured Tony was fast asleep, he locked the door of their guest room and went back to the party. Mr. Hammer and his Omega had returned by now. The boy -
“Rhodey jr. or James?” he asked with a grin before he thought about it. “You know what? Nice idea. Say hello to Jamie.”
When he strolled into SHIELD he was confident on the outside. A mask he had perfectioned over the years; Think less, smile more. He winked at some employees who seemed to talk about him behind his back and pretended like self-doubt didn’t exist. Fury waited for him in one of the conference rooms, it seemed. He already thought about a good excuse to give Steve as to why Bruce had needed to babysit when he stopped.
Tony was so glad Rhodey was here. He was like his personal rock sheltering him from the turbulent waters that were his life now. He was Tony Stark. He didn’t need protection from an alien army, he could deal with a robot trying to kill the entire human population but when it came to his team leader, he was at loss. And scared. The first time in his life he was scared. Not scared to die; Dying hadn’t scared him since he had flown through a wormhole in the sky. His fear was not to die. To grow into the submissive quiet person his mother had been throughout her life. He didn’t want his personality to fade away, to become what Steve wanted of him to become.
Tony nodded although he already knew he would be responsible for all of it. He didn’t want to have it any other way. Why would he shove this responsibility to Steve who was working? No, he could deal with everything he was given, he was Tony Stark. He could do this. “What are you doing in your free time?”
Steve ignored him. “You will get up at 8 AM and go to bed at 12 PM every day unless I say otherwise.”
“Haven’t decided yet. I’ll think about it, after all, it’s one of the few honors I have.” Steve may have had the right to decide over their residence and their bank accounts but Tony and only Tony alone was allowed to name them. Actually, he had wanted to involve Steve in the progress but now that he thought about it the moment was perfect. He was gone for at least two days so he couldn’t pressure him into calling them however
“Yeah…” it was like he had no energy left to give him a witty remark. He was pregnant. Him. He was no longer the Tony Stark he had loved to be. No, if he would have to keep the pups, he was damned to stay at home and take care of them. Even if Steve finally stopped being an abusive piece of shit, he would never take care of them. No, he would basically be a single parent.
Actually, he wasn’t eating breakfast much; He didn’t have the motivation to stand in the kitchen to make food only for himself. Tony, however, seemed to be the type.
Steve tensed. Tony seemed to have succeeded in making him uneasy at least. He was annoyed, obviously, like he had to deal with a defiant child. “Apart from that, you will eat three meals a day. I will prepare them the first few weeks. In time,
“Everything went well, Mr. Rogers,” Midwife number two informed him. Well, at least Tony had called her like that in his head. Now that he could finally think clearly again he could read her name tag; Kathleen. “Mr. Stark needs some rest now, if you would follow me?”
Steve sighed and continued speaking. “It was impossible how you behaved at the PRO, Tony. Really, I can’t believe that you would embarrass yourself
He himself knew many Omegas and neither of them - bonded or not - looked like they would need help. Not that Rogers would have cared. He was the same traditional idiot as always and Tony had gotten tired of contradicting. The topic was still brought up from time to time but both men had made their point too clear to discuss it further.
known. After all, it was everything his Alpha agenda desired; Omegas were treated like objects, valuable enough to bid on them, especially when they were virgins. Tony refused to keep thinking about it or the idea of someone being less worth after being knotted to another.
His entire demeanour changed from curious to worried. He could see the little frown and those ridiculously big eyes. “Oh Gosh, don’t tell me you do drugs.”
That was his main concern. If it would go wrong, horribly wrong, they’d be orphans. Maybe it was his own history that made him be terrified of it. He knew just too well how it was to lose his parents that early. And frankly? Steve did too so he didn’t understand why the triplets weren’t an argument.
His hands trembled when he opened his jeans button but he managed to undress with as much elegance as possible. “I am s-”
he asked. “Do you think I like punishing you and teach you how to behave? I don’t, really, if I could choose you would just behave like every other person on this planet but you need some tutor lessons when it comes to that.”
It was obvious he didn’t believe him. but Tony didn’t really care about that one. He thought about doing something, going out maybe but it wouldn’t be wise, considering many people wanted to kill him just to make a statement.
“I- What?” Steve was completely brought out of concept by this and let go of Tony’s wrist. Tony himself didn’t know what was happening. It hadn’t been a lie: They had started to kick and completely surprised him. He put Steve’s hand on the spot. “Here.”
Tony realized what he had done and fell into shock. He couldn't move, everything went numb. "I..." he had hit him. He had hit Steve. No matter what these men had done to him, he was sure Steve would have even worse ways of making him regret what had just happened.
The engineer cursed silently; even freshmen at MIT would have done better. But he had not been able to think straight since yesterday. Surely, he was getting sick. All the signs were there: He had a high temperature, bordering to fever, and a headache that didn't seem to go away. Probably just the flu. But since Tony normally worked through his flus without turning a hair, this was not something he considered tragic. Just annoying.
“My…” It was embarrassing to talk about it. At home, he wasn’t allowed to talk about it and he doubted Steve wanted to know about it in advance. “My heat is due in two days. And I…, Of course, you don’t have to participate. But is there a room I could-”
“Well, you’re big.” he shrugged and gave him the newspaper. He kept feeling his mating mark. It meant safety. Even if his father had changed his mind, even if he rather wanted him to be with a business partner, he couldn’t do it anymore. All he had to do to stay in that position was to make Steve happy. He could do that.
so far.” Really, he felt like he was in kindergarten again. On the other hand, these rules weren’t as catastrophic as he had imagined them to be. He could work with that.
In the end, both of them had realized that an illegal abortion was too much of a risk for Tony’s health and well being, not to mention that it was punishable by death, adoption without the permission of his Alpha was illegal as well. So there was no way he could do anything without telling Steve how much he had screwed up. He had
Tony glared at him to check if he was really serious or just oblivious. Both, it seemed. There was no reason for Steve to lie to Fury, so he really had to think this. If it’s that horrible you could fucking stop acting the fucking same!
This was the first time Steve apologized and really, it surprised him, caught him completely off guard.
Tony grinned at that. It was good to have his College friend back with him. At least they could pass time like this. He felt save with Rhodey, appreciated. He was everything Steve wasn’t. Even back in college, he would’ve been a nice pick as an Alpha. And if the suppressants had failed earlier he was sure he could’ve ended up with Rhodey. His best friend wouldn’t have let him on his own just like that and actually most people had already expected them to end up together.
Steve didn’t press the issue further. but at least this explained the hostile attitude Tony had given him the moment they met. “How did he evade the recognition procedures? You can’t just drive to the PRO and declare your presentation without backup checks
“Not another word from you, Tony. You will not contradict me like this. And just when I thought we had established some rules.”
Still not dead although it definitely looked like it! Thank you very much for all the comments, they're what keeps me going tbh.
Yes, I am still alive. A new chapter for you now that I can finally go to my favourite starbucks again to write
He thought of Tony. Was Tony the same? No. No, definitely not. Ton had kept harming himself, had worked himself half to death, barely eaten because of those bloody heat suppressants. He had
“Noooo,” he managed to breathe out softly. No way. This was a very humiliating position and Rogers would never see him like that. He looked away, trying to do… well,
When he had regained his balance he heard how the door got slammed behind them and he swallowed thickly. He had gone too far, it seemed. And although he had claimed not to be scared of Steve, a shiver ran through his spine when the taller man approached him with slow, even steps. Tony resisted the urge to step back and decided not to lose face and remained.
“An- Tony, nothing happened.” he said gently. “You dropped something. I want to check if you are hurt. Will you let me?”
The stock markets would fall, all the publicity for the Omega Rights Movement would be in vain. No, he wouldn’t have any of that. So it would be option one.
“Not at the moment.” ‘Uncle’ Rhodey seemed to be very fascinated with the boy in his arms and Tony couldn’t blame him. Even if admitting it hurt him somehow, these children had a presence that automatically had him pamper them. He knew the team would surely visit him soon, too so he needed to present a third name by the time they were here. He needed to come up with something but he had never liked to choose something under pressure.
I am literally so sorry for not updating for so long, my updates will obviously take less long now. I didn't forget about that story, just had some problems within my relationship and the family... yeah, you know how it is...
He closed his eyes yet again and dozed off until he heard a muffled cry. When he looked around to find the origin of the sound, he realized it was his newborn son. Girl one and girl two were still sleeping safe and sound. He wondered where Steve was at the moment but then again he didn’t care enough to actually look for him. Instead, he put the little boy into his arms.
“Are you now? Oh, I guess you are right. All wanton and wet for me, Tony. If you could see yourself now…” He hit his prostate with each push, tired of the foreplay. Tony wasn’t sure if he could handle it anymore.
“For… for… I don’t know, Steve. I don’t know. I am too stupid to know. Please, just tell me.” the words came out just like that, he frantically fisted his Alpha’s shirt to have something to hold onto.
Steve took a deep breath. “Exactly. And you will be polite. I can’t believe I even have to mention this. You will not insult me. And you will not attack me either or you will regret it.”
She sighed. “It doesn’t work like that, Mr. Rogers. This test would but your pups and Mr. Stark at risk. And we don’t do them here because we think it isn't morally justifiable.”
“Tony.” Steve’s sigh made him sick. He had fucked up. He knew he had. “Of course you can eat breakfast. Why shouldn’t you?”
“Thanks. Not much I can do without the lab,” he said, avoiding to show it had actually been fun. As soon as Steve would see a sign of that he would feel like he had done the right thing by knocking Tony up and he wasn’t having it.
He would wake up hours later in a hospital bed, in Steve’s arms with three little cribs next to them. “Morning.”
“You threw a $1700 gadget at a window.” he started. “You started to say very disrespectful things. You only ate an apple which is little.”
“I didn’t know it was SHIELD’s field of activity. You don’t usually interfere with political parties. Why now?”
The next thing Tony felt was the cold water on his face and his aching lungs. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t-
“Stark?” Adam Ford, one of Hammer’s partners, looked at him mischievously. “What are you doing here all alone?”
“I get it now,” he said, leaning back and crossing his arms. “I get it, Tony. I thought I could save you from yourself. I thought I could make you a better, healthier person than you are.”
“Steve, I am sorry. Please, I don’t want to-” He would not rape him again… would he? No, Steve Rogers was many things but not a rapist. Last time he had had a bit of a dubious consent but he was sure that he would not do this. Not against his will anyway. It was not his style.
“Yeah, sure. When you were a kid people still died of tuberculosis.” he managed to say. “I want to be pain-free. Period. Either you accept that or you can wait outside.”
“Mhh, I- God, Alpha, please-” Tony couldn’t form coherent sentences anymore, it was too late. There was only Steve. There were only Steve’s hands and Steve’s cock and Steve’s growls that made him feel good, made him feel needed. Only he could give an Alpha this pleasure, only
someone to take care of him. So he’d done him a favour, right? Of course, he had. had Hammer done that boy a favour? No. Probably not.
No, she regularly snarled at him, talked to him sarcastically and figuratively kicked his butt if he had gone against her orders. In other words, his personal Pepper Potts for all questions concerning motherhood.
Seriously? Had this been a test? Had Steve just wanted to see if he would ask for permission to meet Fury?
Steve frowned, he had a look Tony had never liked before. Ever. “I am not so sure about that. You might get hurt. You know you are-”
When Steve came back, Tony had calmed down enough not to get a panic attack by his sight. Rhodey had tried to comfort him and to tell him to calm down. After all, he had several options in that matter. Not all of them were legal but his friend had assured him he would gladly break the law if it benefited his mental health.
His expression was unreadable and for a brief moment, Tony thought he’d turn him down. Finally. Some common sense.
“Is that a passive-aggressive command? You are improving, Steve. I wonder if we can expect a swear word by next year.”
His pregnancy had been polarizing (“Even more people who are trying to have an opinion about my body. Great Rogers, really, good job”) and discussed in several magazines. Half of the people were content he had finally been
“I always call the shots, sweetheart. And if you don’t let go of me, I will kick your ass so hard your vertebrae will pop out of your mouth one by one like a PEZ dispenser.”
“I… uh… Are you sure you want to know any of them? You don’t have to check how resilient I am. I can assure you that I am quite flexible. I can adjust to any rule given to me. I promise nothing will be too hard to handle. Whatever you-”
It had been weeks since he had been backhanded the last time and he was sick of it. Rhodey had been right. He should have left Steve and just face the justice system. Oh, he had been so stupid.
Tony immediately bit his lip. He had said something wrong again. Why was he even trying still? It seemed he was always getting it wrong ever since he and Steve had bonded.
Whatever he had just said seemed to convince Steve because he nodded. Tony really wondered how he had not been able to get how to talk until last month. Of course he knew they should be able to talk without having to think about how to present it. But that was a battle for another day.
He got pressed underneath the water again. He couldn’t breathe, his lungs hurt so much, the pressure was building up, slowly, slowly, he had to breathe, had to breathe, he needed to, to-
Half of the time, he was almost sweet, trying to make life not so shitty for him. Tony had always been a fairly social person and the fact that he couldn’t leave the penthouse without someone potentially trying to stab him in the stomach.
“My role is to protect you and to take care of you, make sure you’re safe. I’d like you to at least accept me in return. We both didn’t expect to end up with each other so I think we should make the best out of it.”
He took a deep breath. He was Tony Stark, not a stupid, daft Omega like Rogers would think. He had taken those illegal suppressants since he was thirteen, that made about thirty years now. If he would find no one during his heat he might die. This had always been a risk of taking them, right after infertility and distress. It had been worth it. Without an Alpha, he might die. Might. The first option he had was to go into his panic room, get some toys on the way and just hope that he would survive the next three days. Not the best choice he had, really.
Rhodey nodded. He didn’t wear his uniform for once but a simple white shirt. “You could leave him, Tones. I know he isn’t good to you. Hell, everyone with more than two brain cells knows.”
He nodded at that. True, Steve might have not always been decent, but he was better than those men in Afghanistan. He had comforted him, made him some milk. He was holding him and had not made a fuss because of his nose.
“You have no idea what kind of club this is. Hell, you didn’t even know it existed until five minutes ago. They did some things to people… there are people in mental institutes never coming out of it again because they messed them up so bad.”
“Don’t even end the sentence, Fury.” Tony stood. “You have agents for that shit. If you even think I will go to the OPP alone without my suit, you’ll goddamn-”
“Protec- He used a condom, right? When you were in heat. I mean, you surely don’t want to get pregnant.”
“And normally, I would agree to home birth, but Mr. Stark’s reactor has decreased his lung capacity. He will need much of it during birth and there are already high risks of him dying, should we not intervene.”
Fury was facing the window, though he knew he could see him through the reflection of the glass; Fury was too paranoid to look away otherwise. He had crossed his arms and looked into the distance. That wasn’t what made him frown though; Steve sat at the conference table.”Tony.”
“I am on your side, Mr. Rogers. Natural birth is the best way for healthy pups and doctors should just be called if something goes wrong. I think both of us can agree on this, yes?”
“I will not punish you, Omega. You have done nothing wrong. You were in distress. If even, I should have woken you up. It’s my job to care about you, remember?”
He moaned when he felt a thick finger circling his entrance. A great part of him tried to push away, to tell whoever this was to fuck off, but the part of his stupid biology leaned into the touch instead.
to know. He had just said this because he knew Steve wanted to know it desperately (he didn’t know why - probably because the fact you
“Stop being nervous, Rogers. You are not the one who has to push out three kids in a few hours,” he made clear. Really, there wasn’t anything worse than having Steve run around all nervous while he was trying to stay as calm as possible.
First, he thought the blanket was a heated one, then he figured the heating was on, then it became clearer. He let out a soft hum.
Steve wasn’t finished yet, though. He pushed eagerly into him, his tongue licking over his bonding mark. He wouldn’t, would he?
Tony thanked him quietly and started to take little sips out of it. Stupid flashbacks, stupid weakness he had just shown, never again. He swore himself this wouldn’t happen again. He would never need Steve’s comfort again. From tomorrow on.
It was the tenth night he was sleeping alone again and Tony had to admit that he had grown accustomed to someone holding him all night. Listening to someone’s heartbeat all night had been relaxing, soothing. He could fight his biology all he wanted but the responses were still there. but now he was alone. No one to hold him, to reassure him.
“For what it’s worth, you are allowed to keep working, but I want you to ask before you do. And you will have to earn it. If you break rules deliberately or if you start to think you can defy me just for sports, I will take this privilege away from you and you will engage in things Omegas should normally engage in.”
Eventually, he left the party again, something made him sick. Omegas were supposed to be corrected, yes, but also protected. They weren’t slaves. He walked back into their bedroom and found Tony sleeping on the floor, completely exhausted.
Too well he remembered how his mother had received not the least bit of help with him and he had been a handful. His father had shrugged it off, occasionally even punished his mother for the way Tony had spoken or acted. And he could imagine all too well how Steve would do the same. This pregnancy was a potential set of punishments that would come much later.
“I see.” he didn’t. Not even in the least. “So… you… what’s my role here? I mean… I don’t know what do do, what will make you happy. I just want to make you happy. I am
If anyone else would have told him about the signs, he would have laughed. He would have told them what was going on and probably made fun of them for suppressing the only logical explanation. But right now he was way too oblivious to see them.
Steve’s soft voice was enough to assure Tony he was safe, that he was calm. He wanted to make a comment about how sexist it was that the girls wore pink while the boy was dressed in baby blue but he was not awake enough for this yet.
“Gonna bring you back, then. Your Alpha will worry. You’re not even able to orientate yourself in a fucking house. See? That’s why you can’t live on your own. You’re here to carry pups, not to be smart. But you know that now, don’t you?”
” Steve stepped forward, Tony had no idea what he was intending to do. He didn’t have to find out, though - Rhodey was faster and twisted Steve’s arm behind his back. “I said
But now it felt better. It was just a simple tweet. Nothing too bad; he’d written worse. Nevertheless: He had just announced to the entire world he was not beaten down yet. He would not become docile and quiet. No, he was Tony Stark. He would roar if he had to but he would not be forgotten. he was the genius of this generation. He was popular, a role model of MIT students. Whatever he was doing now would be a motivation for other people.
at comfortability. He realized his mate didn’t even have a pyjama. “Looks like we’re gonna shop for some clothes, too.”
When they finally reached 20 (Steve had decided he didn’t like uneven numbers) he was sobbing into the pillow he was holding to muffle his sounds. His whole body was shivering to cope with the pain.
Maybe some of you have already noticed but this will not only be a porn without plot fic. It is also a fanfiction that will criticise society. And porn. Lots of it. But you get my point. Comments and kudos are appreciated as always since that keeps me going
It took Tony about twenty seconds to kick him into his crotch, punch him in his throat and leave. He couldn’t go into the room in question without him seeing, though, so he quickly returned to the festivities. Steve was talking to a very successful lawyer when Tony came back. He’d put enough O fragrance on himself to eradicate Adam Ford’s existence. Steve would not know they ever met. It was better this way.
He was relieved that Steve understood that eating food was not really on his to-do list at the moment. He could not believe that he had done this. He couldn’t believe he has gone this far. His throat was still sore from the gastric acid that had found its way up to his throat.
“I am very sorry. Believe me, I would rather have it otherwise. Might I talk to your Omega in private? You can stay, of course, but it’s about details concerning his placenta and breathing patterns.”
“A ticking time bomb, yeah, got it.” he sighed. “Just a stroll, Cap. I am going insane here. You don’t want me to work, I can’t go outside… what am I supposed to do all day? Knit?”
Tony did. He had tried to struggle at first but really; the consequences weren’t to his liking. It was better to avoid handcuffs or even worse. It seemed like they would go to the OPP if he wanted or not. And it seemed the night wouldn’t turn out like he had wanted it to turn out anyway.
Feeling them kicking for the first time made him happy although he was aware that Steve had been about to do something very inappropriate and very violent. Really, he had no idea how to handle this idiot any longer.
The light got switched on and it was blinding for him at first. He squeezed his eyes shut and could only open them twenty seconds later. Oh god. Steve was bleeding from his nose.
“S-Steve, please, god I-” he couldn’t hold back any longer. His muscles clenched around Steve’s length and Tony let out a cry of release. He now knew why Steve had changed positions: he would have collapsed on the pillows otherwise.
“That’s not true.” he said. “You know it isn’t. They loved me. Yeah, they weren’t the best to show it but they did. Just like Jarvis.”
panic rose inside of him. He wanted to hide, to activate the suit, to disappear through a hole but his mind was even more clouded when he smelled the scent of an Alpha. His biology worked for him now, no matter how much his mind protested. He was panting, supporting himself on the wall. He needed and needed and needed and he felt like he was fainting soon.
There was silence for quite a time. He had no idea if this was a good or bad timing but both of them were too taken aback to continue their fight.
Something inside of Tony just snapped and he called his armour. The metal was not entirely adequate anymore; His figure had gotten slightly curvier and thinner without the suppressants. But it still fit. He pointed his repulsor at Steve. “Try me, Priklopil!”
He just laid there, eyes wide, and tried to comprehend what had just happened, without much success. Instead, the Omega closed his eyes, drifting into sleep when the itchy feeling disappeared and got replaced by utter and complete exhaustion.
As always, thank you so much for supporting me with comments and kudos, it's a real motivator to keep on going!
how Alphas think and feel. And yes, sometimes having a mate isn’t all fun and games, but do you think I
“Jokes on you, Cap. I just run on caffeine, anxiety, and spite.” As if he wanted to demonstrate his point, he emptied his mug with one single gulp.
Tony let out a soft whine, that was the only answer he could give. He was just glad he wouldn’t get pregnant again. He could endure a few hours of artificial heat. As if he’d read his mind, Steve put his mouth on his ear. “I found them, you know. Your new ones. Replaced them with placebo pills weeks ago.”
Steve’s tone of voice had changed and frankly? Tony didn’t feel too self-confident anymore. This man was more than capable of breaking his neck with one hand. he could not escape. And even if he would activate the suit and get the fuck out of here, the authorities would be after him for his whole life. After all, he was not very popular along them unlike Steve.
“We will.” Steve said. It didn’t sound too promising, at least for Tony. And really, he wasn’t wrong.
His eyes widened and he started to struggle. Steve wouldn’t have any of it, though, and pinned both of his arms down with only one hand. “Oh no, Tony. You did this to yourself.”
Seconds later, his head wandered to Tony’s ear, sucking his earlobe. It aroused the Omega even more and he felt yet another trail of slick wander down his thighs. “Please, Alpha, I am
Tony didn’t trust the Alpha. Not even a bit. But his upset stomach would trust that damn soup. He was hungry. After all, he had barely been able to digest breakfast. At the same time, he never wanted to eat again. Steve was not friendly. He was one of those entitled Alpha idiots thinking they could do with their Omega what they wanted. He was one of those Alphas Tony hated. This was no change of heart. He just didn’t know what would await him.
He sat down and browsed around. Twitter, Instagram and Facebook talked about him non-stop as well, but a certain post, retweeted by an old college friend, made him curious. His name was linked to it but he had not seen it before.
“N-No. No. No, you’re- It’s just a rule. In the cl- In the environment, I lived in. I, uh… What are the rules
His head got put underwater again. By the time he finally got to breathe again, he couldn’t form a single thought.
“Now to the specific rules. Before I tell them, it’s important for you to know that there will be more rules in time. But I will never punish you for not following a rule you didn’t know before. I will be fair.”
Tony flinched when he heard the voice but put on a cocky grin to hide it. It then changed to a neutral expression. He tried not to look scared, because honestly? He wasn’t. His mood swings were all-present and he constantly moved from
There was another pregnant pause and Tony decided that Steve wouldn’t understand anyway. The other still seemed to change his mind about this.
Sorry for the long break, I am currently writing on another similar fanfiction, this time with a slightly better Alpha Steve (he's a good guy) and a very disturbed Omega Tony (ma bean) in the 1940s. It's called Small Steps. (https://archiveofourown.org/works/24113185) Feel free to read and comment!
“Jup, I know.” he crossed his arms. “Steve, really, I don’t wanna know how many or what gender. I am huge already so I already know it’s more than one. Enough for me.”
to be a parent! You took this choice from me and now I will make sure I will have one again. I don’t want this spawn of evil growing inside of me just because you
As soon as they arrived home, Steve smiled at Bruce, thanked him for babysitting and made sure he was gone before he pressed Tony against the wall; and not in a romantic way. “How. Dare. You?”
Steve seemed to be surprised as well as uncertain. Good. Tony would not make this easy for him. He would leave, even if this meant to get chased by the government, his team and the PRO together. he didn’t care anymore. He would get this abortion. He would go underground and live a not so rich but at least happy live somewhere. He didn’t really care as long as he would no longer be Steve’s personal plaything.
noticed. They went about their day without knowing that they had given him the inspiration, the looks he had needed just in that moment. it must feel overwhelming to feel like this. He couldn’t imagine it.
Tony nodded, mostly because this meant he didn’t have to look into the poor boy’s eyes again who’d come back from his first night with Justin Hammer. Tony didn’t have to imagine how bad he was in bed; he could smell dissatisfaction on the boy. Not to mention the other’s.
“You need to take them every 24 hours. They should work immediately. And they are highly illegal so don’t get caught. I could lose my job.”
From then on, he had been respected more or less and doing stuff with Rhodey proved to be fun. He didn’t even leave when Tony started to get… well, off track.
“I see,” he said. It was not what he wanted but if the risks were really that high, he wouldn’t take chances.
“‘m lost. Can’t find the party anymore.” he lied although, in retrospect, this excuse sounded silly.
Steve sighed. “Let’s make an agreement. You will let your doctor check how many pups we’ll have and their gender. In return,
Even beforehand, he and Steve had discussed what to say to the press as even Steve knew that the truth was unconventional at best. They were not in the forties anymore. Not that it would have mattered; well over half of the population were still dicks. No matter what Tony would have said; in the public eye he had it coming. An unmated Omega in hiding? Scandalous. He often joked that they’d soon release a movie about that aspect of his life.
“Didn’t we? No, we didn’t,” he sighed. During the pregnancy, he had tried to avoid looking for names. He knew Steve wanted to give them names of family members, their parents maybe. But Tony knew all too well that this was a legacy they didn’t want. He had only gotten the second name of his father and it had been enough for years of self doubt.
On one hand, he couldn’t wait to finally get rid of his pregnant belly and the back pain and the people who thought they could touch him whenever they wanted. On the other hand, he was scared. As soon as they were born he’d have to take care of them. Alone of course. He didn’t have any illusions in that matter.
There was silence for a while. Neither Rhodey nor Tony or Rhodey said anything. In the end, though, Steve nodded and sat down. “What’s the matter, Tony?”
Today, they had discussed it again and Tony had just been too pissed to give him a sarcastic reply. Instead, he had told everyone he’d work in the lab and had stayed there. And he hadn’t come out. Twelve hours later, he still sat there, tinkering on his newest suit and living off energy drinks, coffee and spite.
He was okay with being called a self-centered asshole but he was not a traditionalist. He did his best to support the Movement, to advertise its advantages. He might have been a Beta, but the people listened to him and were astounded every time he donated another eight-digit sum to the leaders of the ORM.
It was like something inside of him was released he hadn’t known he even possessed. Not for a long time, at least. “What, are you gonna kick me into my stomach now, Rogers? Is that how you guys did it back in the forties?”
“You! You are responsible for this shit! Fuck you, Rogers! I wish you would have stayed in the fucking goddamn ice!”
“Please.” Really, he would destroy him with facts. Slowly, meticulously. But not now. Right now he wanted nothing else but Steve to push inside of him, to end the heat, the burning.
When he saw Steve flinch he knew it had worked. “If you excuse me now; I am tired of your bullshit!”
He turned around, went towards the elevator and stopped when it opened. JARVIS didn’t say anything, which meant it could only be a handful of people. When he saw who of them it was, he sighed internally.
“Yes, Ma’am.” he grinned and put the shirt off. She was a Beta so Steve didn’t see her as an immediate threat but Tony knew he didn’t like it when he flirted. Well, not
He stood and went to Steve in the living room. “What you did this morning was fucked up on so many levels.”
“I beg your pardon?” Tony frowned. There was no way in hell he would do this without medical staff, without painkillers and without professionals.
Tony could not think straight. He was just relieved it was over. He tried to stop the sobs that had not entirely come from the pain. No, most of his tears were tears of humiliation. He had been ordered to go on his knees and Steve had punished him as if he was a little child. And it had hurt but what had even been worse was the fact that he knew he could not escape his fate, nothing could have changed Steve’s mind. It terrified him, this thought.
Just then, he remembered he had seen the boy back the first time they had visited the society. He’d been bubbly and full of life. He remembered him so well because he had laughed so beautifully with his glass of champagne in his hand. With his mother being Irish, Steve had no problem with people under twenty-one drinking something. The boy with the golden locks had no life inside of him anymore. His entire willpower seemed to be directed towards not trying to cry. It was shocking how two hours could change a person. If he was his son, he-
Steve smiled. Softly, not afraid anymore. It was strange to see and made Tony frown. “You would never hurt me.”
“It’s a club. Well, since March they are also a political party. They want to fight for a change in the constitution and they want a tightening of Omega laws. Very conservative and very-”
“Shhh, I know. I am gonna help you, Tony.” Steve pushed a second finger into Tony, then a third. He wasn’t sure if preparing him was even necessary. But he wouldn’t risk something to tear. Who knew how long Tony hadn’t done this - the fact it hadn’t shown, that Steve had never found out told him Tony had taken illegal suppressants. He knew their risks - after all, there was a reason why they were prohibited.
Steve didn’t seem to know what was going on. Tony did. Of course, he’d known they were doing biddings here. This society was known for it. Honestly, he was surprised Steve
“I thought about what you said - about the forties. I think I was just mad at you for keeping your presentation a secret. I wanted to punish you for it as every Alpha would. Because you don’t have the judgment
For a moment, Steve could see how this boy really was when he’d warmed up to him. He seemed to be sassy. He could need that with Bucky being his best friend. He immediately went back to looking down, though.
wanted to call them. That was the reality in most conservative families anyway: The Omega would go to the PRO with some names their Alpha had chosen and they called it a day.
Tony already knew this conversation wouldn’t end too well. But there was no way he would say sorry to this. “Yeah… Listen-”
He would be able to show him off to other people, to claim him as his own with every look they gave to Tony. He’d even managed to get his hair under control.
Steve ran his hands down his sides, caressing Tony’s back, then his thighs. In the end, one wrapped around Tony’s member and stroked it in a fast, merciless rhythm. Steve knew Tony had been very lucky with his body. His length was astounding for an Omega. So this was why none of his previous lovers had suspected anything. He didn’t doubt it was more than functional, especially with the suppressants.
“Tones….” he set Jamie down. “Look, I am also glad you sleep more but what he does is not right. he might not break any laws as your Alpha, but if he wasn’t, you’d press charges, right?”
“No.” Steve frowned, not really sure of cornflakes. Tony looked at him, half doubting he really had no clue. Then again, Steve was so oblivious to this kind of shit sometimes.
Steve transferred half of his plate on another plate and let Tony eat it. it broke his heart how thankful Tony looked. “Thank you so much. So you’ll be at work and I’ll handle the rest.”
This is merely a chance to thank you all! When I started this ff I told myself to keep writing as long as only two people would keep reading this. And now? We've gone up to 127 comments, 93 bookmarks and over 400 kudos, as we speak, not to mention my 220 new subscribers. Thank you for your support, your ideas and your exact description of feelings you show me with each chapter. It's an honor to read them all and to see how many people enjoy my writing!
He nodded and showed Steve his hands. Apart from a little cut, he was fine. Steve cleaned the mess for him and instructed him to take a shower and pick something out of his closet for the store.
“Uh huh. That’s nice but I meant really. Come on, you can tell me. Is it embarrassing or just something you think I’ll think is boring?”
Steve approached him and Tony tried his best not to flinch away again. Steve was furious with the statement and frankly, this was what Tony had intended. He winced when he felt pressure on his wrist.
“Take a breath - please. Just breathe. It’s okay, Omega. It’s alright.” He had hesitated to touch him yet. He knew about these sorts of things. He had been in the war, after all.
He sighed. “They want a world where about twenty percent of the population gets reduced to breeding machines. Basically.”
He remembered how angry Howard had been that his son didn’t speak a word of English. it was telling, however, that it had taken five years to figure out Tony talked french non-stop. it was beyond him how Howard could ignore his “Je peux avoir l’eau, s’il te plaît?” or the usual “Je n’veux pas aller au lit!”
He still stared at the shards. Only now his knees gave in and he tried to collect them with his hands. He didn’t know where the broom was or if he was allowed to use it. He didn’t know if Steve wanted him to stand on the shards or have him beg on the streets until he had enough money to replace it. All punishments he could imagine.
Steve had never seen him like this before. No cocky smile anymore, no restrain, just utter desperation and distress. He slowly put his arms around him and let him cry on his shoulder. “Shh, that’s right. Let it all out. Can you tell me what happened?”
As soon as he stood, he felt how slick he actually already was. Goddamnit, stupid biology. The fluid almost gushed out and he was sure that every Alpha in a radius of 700 Meters would smell him like that. He needed to put on much of aftershave and hope he would not get caught by his teammates instantly. He didn’t even want to imagine what would happen then.
“I am leaving. Keep the fucking penthouse.” He balled his fists and went towards the door. Steve was not having any of it and caught up with him, squeezing his wrist.
“Yeah, look Cap, that won’t work.” Normally he worked until about three or four and slept about two hours. Sleeping eight hours was nearly insane. He had work to do, after all.
Steven frowned and did so, probably just because of the shock Rhodey would ask something like that of him in his own house. “Do we have a problem, Lieutenant Colonel?”
There was a fine line between being a prisoner and five months pregnant, Tony had found out. At least in Steve’s mind. He didn’t know if he had made the right choice. He was sure that every book about domestic abuse would tell him to get the hell out of here. But he had made this choice and he would stand for it. And Steve was not that much of a bad guy if you lowered your expectations. He could even be sweet at times. Sometimes. Mostly in the moments Tony managed to shut up.
Tony hated the fact Fury was right and nodded. Steve seemed to have the same thoughts and gave him a polite nod. It was idiotic to claim otherwise and Fury knew that. So Tony just let him have this smug grin without complaint. “What kind of mission is this?”
“At least call him James. Jamie reminds me of Jamie Oliver. Really, I’ve never seen someone cook so messy.”
Tony wanted to give him a snarky reply but the first blow took his breath away. Being a playboy, Tony had often done this to his one night stands after they had asked for it, but he had never been the receiving part. He got that this could surely be arousing when done gently, right. But Steve was hitting him with such brutal force that he made his point more than clear.
The flu would have been one thing, but there was also his hypersensitivity that was going on for days now.
It was scientifically proven that Omegas without a mate tended to be self-destructive, tended to neglect their own needs in favour of other things. After all, this was how nature had created them; It worked this way. If Omegas did not have those issues, there would be no reason to look for a mate. Simple biology.
“Mr. Rogers, it is a pleasure to see you again.” The woman reminded Tony of Michelle Gomez with her strict look and her dyed titian hair.
Still, he tried to put the pieces together. Last night, Steve had taken care of him. He had not hit him (and knowing Steve this was a miracle) and he had soothed him. He had held him tight and reassured him. This was something new. Tony was used to being ridiculed for his nightmares or told not to be overdramatic. Never before had there been anyone to actually acknowledge his feelings. Well, apart from Rhodey.
I thought first the abortion laws in my AU were insane and then I remembered that this is exactly what Alabama intends to do. Stay strong, guys. They can't do this inhumane law forever!
Immediately he shook the thought from his head. Not happening. He would not like this. Steve was helping him through this shitty heat. After that, he would probably pay him to shut his mouth and everything would be okay again. Or at least he hoped so. He had to hope because his mind got cloudy again.
“How dare I what, Steve?” he asked back, finally having found his anger again. “Are you fucking serious? You want me to go to the OPP with you? You want me to become one of those damned-”
“And the many galas? What about that one? Come on, Tony, we both know the champagne and the other people were more important for them than you.”
When Steve woke up, Tony was not in bed anymore. For a brief moment, he was worried his mate had fled the house and was walking around without much orientation in the middle of the city. He didn’t know where this fear stemmed for but he didn’t know how traumatized his omega was and he didn’t know how he reacted to stress (yet). He thought quite a long time where he could be. The bathroom was open, the house was quiet.  Then the smell of bacon hit his nose.
Tony laid the positive pregnancy test on the table. Steve didn’t know how to react for a very long time. Something inside of him was immediately obsessed with the life presumably growing inside of Tony, told him to protect it whatever the cost. And he knew Tony must feel something like this as well, as hard as he wanted to suppress it.
“I don’t mean it as an insult, Tony. It is only natural, right? Nature wanted me to take care of you when we are bonded so it would be stupid to give you the same judgment as it gave me. In that case I would be futile.”
The clock was ticking too loud. Why did he even need a damn clock? Why did he need machines that made that kind of noise? Why could he not even listen to his goddamn music? Black Sabbath sounded like an odd noise someone would put into an alarm to make it sound gruesome. His head was throbbing to the music. Fucking stupid headache.
If there was something he knew, then that not many people were really concerned about what happened to his kind as long as the population grew. And she was Beta, so the whole conflict would not have to affect her at all.
Other people thought this was against everything they stood for. The highlight had been him being on the Ellen Show. Really he was a fan of her but sitting in an oversized chair and talking about how he got knocked up was not one of his favourites.
Steve growled. Enough stalling. He couldn’t wait longer himself. After all, Tony’s scent was incredibly increased, probably because of the withdrawal of suppressants.
