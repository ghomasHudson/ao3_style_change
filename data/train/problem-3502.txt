I was no one, I had lost all hope, I was just a stray cat waiting for death, and you showed me happiness again. I learned to appreciate the little things that happen to us, and I learned the real meaning of family.
"Yeah, yeah, you too."
“I’m curious about one thing, though”
They exchange small talks just like old friends do, and Dean is drunk with the sensation of maybe being on the way to reconstructing something.
He has to set things right again for the last time, or either way the incertanity will kill him.
That's how, two grown men, a vampire and a hunter no less, found themselves, shoulder to shoulder, fighting for who should spy the couple through a keyhole.
“Hello” he greets, slipping in front of the man while wearing one of his glorious smiles.
“I would do anything for my family”
After a minute or so, everything ended. Maybe because there weren't any more lightbulbs to explode.
“According to your mad plan, you would have left me without giving me the occasion to see this beautiful face. That would have been a real shame honestly” He grinned, still running his thumbs across Cas’s face, earning a hesitant smile and a blush on his cheeks.
I haven’t had a home in years, and you gave me the world, Dean. You have always been so kind to me, and I thought I could pretend I was just a normal cat, live a little slice of happy life before I was forced to leave you and hide somewhere else.” Castiel’s voice broke, his eyes now filled with tears that he angrily wiped away.
Cas approached him gradually, and, when he was sure Dean wouldn’t hit him or something, pushed his head in Dean’s palm.
He doesn't get near him this time. He feels ashamed for what he did the last time he saw him.
"Goddamnit Castiel, stop please!" Dean yells, and he doesn't care if he's making a scene in the middle of the street, and people are coming out from the house to watch him funny. He's not letting him out of his sight again before getting some answers. "I swear if you take another step I'll punch you, you son of a bitch!"
But it's pretty hard to tell when it seems like you're in the middle of a forth-of-july parade, your brother is making out with your best friend and you're hiding under a table.
“You know what I was thinking?” Dean asked a morning over coffee
Cas tilted his head, an adorable habit he had shown from the very first day they had met
Cas pushed a cup of coffee towards him, offering a shy smile “I.. guess so..”
Do you remember the day you found me, in that alley? That was the work of an old.. friend” he air quoted
Dean was sure now. This couldn't be anyone but Benny. The sacrifice he had made to help them had left an open wound in Dean's heart; the bitter sensation of losing another loved one for "the greater good". Benny, Kevin, Charlie, death hunted Dean's life, and those close to him.
"Woooh! That's our boy! That you can call a kiss!"
Tomorrow first thing we 'll settle everthing, but now, please Dean, don't think about it anymore.
Maybe one day you'll wake up and you'll decide you don't want to put up with my shit anymore, and you'll go away. Or worse, one day I'll have to decide between us and the rest of the world, and i will have no choice.
What he really missed though, were human interactions.
Determination replaced confusion, and in a blink of an eye, Sam was pointing his gun at him.
Only then Sam noticed his brother was lying on the floor, and coming closer, surprise of surprises, he saw on top of him there was Benny! The vampire! With a knife in his hand!
He curled in the crook between Dean's stomach and legs and started purring; the only way of saying “thank you” he could think of.
He is devastated, partly drunk and probably delirious. Another one of their friends has died.
I took these things this morning by the way, I hope you don’t mind.” He pointed at his tshirt.
"It's alright Dean, I love spending time with you. And besides, it's not like I have 10 orgies per day! I always have time for you.
Before he could grab the mug to take a sip, he found himself squeezed in a bone-crushing hug, the former cat whispering thank yous like a mantra in the crook of his neck, leaving Dean unable to do anything but to hug back.
“Alright, alright, tiger, don’t get pissed too easily.
Face already red as a tomato, with a shrug he pushed Benny off him, and once on his feet again, he mumbled something that resembled "Yeah, don't worry Sammy, it's alright",looking anywhere but at the men.
"You know what? We're leaving this to you two, see you later buddy" With a strong hand Benny started dragging a way too much confused Sam out of the room, closing the doors behind them, but not before trowing a meaningful face at Dean that said half -I trust you, you can do it, and half -screw this up and I kill you.
What the fuck was going on here? Not ten minutes ago he was comfortably sleeping in his bed, and now he was sitting beside a crying, shaking man, that apparently could transform into his cat. When had his life transformed into a young adult novel?
Is that.. is that still alright for you? I can stop if that makes you uncomfortable."
We can start again from the beginning."
“My family!” he shouted with bitterness “Those fucking cowards thought I had been marked by the devil himself, they didn’t want a monster under their roof. The first time I talked to them about what had happened to me, they gathered all my things and throwed me in the street. That’s why I’m telling you the man I was before is dead.”
At the same time, Cas was out on a hunt too. Last time we had heard of him, he had just salt and burned a body, and was mere minutes from packing everything and heading back home.
Something was wrong with this man.
The sudden noise of the front door bursting open interrupted him, and, with wide eyes, they both watched as Sam and Castiel descended the stairs, almost running, face concerned.
When Dean’s stomach growled, Cas jumped on his feet, grabbing a plate from the counter.
At this one, Dean laughs, and he squeezes firmly the “angel’s” hand.
"Hello?"
"That's right! You better not forget that." He point his index finger in the middle of Dean's chest to emphasize his statement, and then he lowers his head again to resume their previous position.
I think Dean's arm was broken. He couldn't stop complaining about it, at the point where I had to drive us back home. Fortunately, he fell asleep two hours after our drive started, so i didn't have to hear his whinings for almost nine hours.
"Of course it can!" Cas squeals his fake horror in a way that shouldn' be possible for his deep voice. "I thought we had established that years ago.
Silence settled between the two men, only interrupted, halfway to the bunker, when Benny suddenly begged Dean to stop at the first hospital. "I haven't eaten in years, and, for as much as I like you, I could rip your throat out right now. Let's go find some blood bags."
"Excuse me! Do you care to explain me what just happened? What was that, and how are you even alive! Wha- why are you looking through the keyhole now?!
I'm gonna stay as long as you'll want me"
June is finally here, and, with it, his beloved pride parade.
"Of course Dean, what is it? Do you need help with something?" His head tilted in his usual, confused way.
The two men are sitting on the cabin's porch, Castiel's legs spread over Dean's lap; the latter absentmindedly massaging his feet.
"I.. almost eleven years now? Why do you ask?"
"Well man, I don't know how you did it, but you were right, i will be thankful forever.
The couple ran past them, towards the bedrooms, hand in hand, not even noticing the men pratically howling at them like fans at a football match.
“You know what? I’m calling in sick. I can’t go to work knowing you’re here alone in this state. And there are things you still have to explain me, if that’s alright with you. What do you say?”
So, you can only imagine our shock when we opened the front door and an incredible, mouthwatering smell of food hit us like a punch. Not microwave food, but real, handmade, fresh food.
“It’s all right baby” Dean whispered, scratching Cas’s belly “We’ll talk tomorrow”
“Dean!” he turned, and, were those pancakes?
Last time I made it very clear my place was down there, but apparently someone thought it different.
It looks like he WANT to say something, but decides against it in the end.
The boy beside him has changed so much since he last saw him; his voice is deeper, his body is muscular and tanned. Dozen of new tattoos cover his arms and, presumably, his whole body.
But the voice who answered back wasn't Sammy's. "Heya buddy, how ya doin'?"
A weird sensation settled in Dean's stomach. "Who's this?"
You may have lived with me for a year, but I lived with you for a year as well. Nothing you had done have ever made me think you were bad.
“I.. I am a shapeshifter, Dean. I was born human but one day I got bitten and I transformed into this animal form.
“Castiel.. that’s an interesting name to match my interesting tattoo”
“Sam is not stupid; I think he’ll figure out those can’t all be odd coincidences. And we could tell him, one day.”
Dean hadn’t even stopped to think that this wasn’t his cat, he was allergic to cats no less, he agreed immediately to sustain every cure himself, the only thing that mattered was saving the cat’s life.
Suddenly, after some seconds of hesitation, the man starts laughing, and it’s such an unexpected change of events that now it’s Dean the one with wide eyes in the middle of the street.
Dean had asked wide-eyed, falling abruptly back into reality form the state of drousiness he was in.
Dean would come home after a long day at work, and he would find his cat, stretching after his countless hours of sleep, greeting him with a bump against his nose.
You know what they say; rest in peace." The last word accompanied by a snort.
"No" Dean's answer is immediate. "You're a stubborn pouty child" And for Cas's goodness, there's a hint of a smile behind the man's words.
"Not at all, I was minding my own business, beheadind some leviathans, when something hit me in the head. I blacked out and next thing I know, I woke up in that field. I hope I didn't brought up with me those sons of bitches, but there weren't any signs of someone else beside me.
Okay, you may have forgotten to mention you weren’t a cat, but you’re my family too Cas. I was so fucking alone before meeting you, if you still trust me even if now I know your secret, I’ll never ask you to leave. Having a doubled version of you is better than don’t have you at all.”
When his eyes adapted to the light, he saw something he would never have expected.
“There is one thing I’m really pissed at though.” Castiel’s eyes widened in panic
"A good lead?"
Wait a second. I’ve just read this book, the main character is an angel called Castiel, what do you say of this one?”
Benny's face fell, his expression blank with confusion and, what was that, rage?
"Yeah Cas, he's right. I.. have something I would like to tell you.. if you have time of course."
“Anyway, going back to what you still haven’t told me” Dean said, dropping his hands “would you care to explain me why you were naked in my bed last night?”
I lied to you, and I regret it heavily, but I was scared.
But you needed your space, all those years without one word from you, I swear I would rather have had one call in wich you told me I was suffocating you, that you had other plans for your future than the silent treatment you reserved me. Because at least I would have known it was over, you would never came back to me.
The sun has already set, and, even if the street is still pretty packed, the crowd is already starting to disperse; young teenagers are waiting at the bus stop and families with sleepy children on their shoulders are gathering their things and leaving.
A loud noise came from the kitchen, and, a couple of seconds later, Cas was standing in the hall's doorway, his figure almost naked without his usual coat, but only a white shirt with rolled up sleeves.
Castiel is now facing him, his face is contorted in a sad smirk
“You would really do that? Dean couldn’t hide his surprise.
“I’m Castiel”
"That's enough for today, Dean, Castiel is right. This is already too hard for all of us. Come on, we're gonna go to their parent's house and see if we can help with the party.."
“Go where? Dean! What’s the matter? I’m never gonna find you again in this crowd!” but Dean is already too far to hear the complains Charlie and Dorothy are throwing at him.
He keeps calling him boy, but he's already a man.
And now they're at it again. They're falling like flies. Maybe next year it will be his turn. He always said he will die in this place, after all.
Not that he's any different.
When the doctor announced it was finally time for the little patient to go home, Dean carefully cradled him in his arms and brought him home.
Actually, it’s been a perfect day so far. Hot girls. Hot guys. A cold beer in his hand. He had waited a whole year for this day, and he will enjoy every second of it.
"Sam! A pleasure seeing you again! You don't need to worry, i mean no harm to your brother. We were just.. remembering the good old times? Tell him Dean, we were having so much fun!"
"Okay, listen, I believe you buddy. Where are you? I'm coming get you."
"You are hurt Dean. What happened? Thalk to me"
“Jesus, what was in that steak I ate at dinner? This is the weirdest dream I ever had in my whole life.”
"Well, what can I say.. sometimes words can be very powerful."
And I was a coward. After I left I told myself 'it's not a big deal, I'll go back, 'cause they love me, and they'll understand me.  But then months passed, and you never called, and i got angry. You were rightfully pissed at me 'cause i turned my back at you. but I didn't understand why you'd rather stay with the asshole that was your father instead of leaving this place and beginning a new life. Sam could have come with us, we just needed to think it through. But you closed that door as soon as I mentioned it."
With the minimum effort and renewed boldness, he lifts Castiel up bridal-style, and, quoting that old Rolling Stones' song, he sing softly into the angel's ear "
"How long have you been living with these two pining idiots?"
Dean jumped from the chair, backing away while raising his hands. "Benny. Benny calm down. I think you're overreacting. He's my best friend, I couldn't leave him there, couldn't I? Come on, it wasn't that bad after all! We had a good time!"
I had to use all my strenght not to say this comment out loud, almost choking on my laughters.
“So, cat. We need to find you a name. I can’t keep on calling you cat if we’ll be living together from now on.
Castiel has a little pan flag painted on his cheek and a black ring on his right middle finger.
A hand places on Dean's shoulder, and interrupts his ramblings.
The drive was shorter than he had expected, and when he arrived there he saw him: cheeky grin and crooked hat, sitting on top of an abandoned car.
“You can say that”
“Oh god it was all real” Dean mumbled, slumping on a chair
I should have imagined something like this would have happened, given the previous events. Every single angel of the universe had heard Castiel scream "Dean Winchester is saved" the day he had pulled Dean out of hell, and Bobby had told me he had made every lightbulb of the barn they were in explode the first time they met him.
“Gladly, sweetheart. But I hope you have some time cause I’m going to tell you a very long story”
Benny didn't waste time, jumping immediately on top of him, trapping Dean like a prey, forcing him to face his emotions, like it or not.
His family was everything to him, he couldn’t imagine treating like that someone ever, even when things went horribly bad. Hell, things had gone horribly bad in Dean’s life. Sam was the only precious thing he had left, and he would protect him with his life.
Well, isn’t that something nice, Dean thinks, and a warm feeling begins to stir in his belly, a fuzzy sensation that leaves him dizzy like he hasn’t been in a very long time.
“WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THIS NOW? A STRANGER BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE AND THEN HE TRIES TO MOLEST ME WITHOUT ME NOTICING?”
Every single lightbulb in the bunker exploded.
It was a late afternoon, and Dean was heading home after a walk in the local park when, from a neglected alley, he heard a cat desperately calling for help. He immediately started looking for it, since nobody else in the street seemed interested by the meowing, and after some seconds of frantic searching, he found the cat slumped under a trash can, all bloody and almost unconscious.
There was a time when they were inseparable, when Dean could throw an arm around his waist, and Cas would sit on his lap every time it was possible, sometimes because he wanted to, sometimes just to piss people off. They would excange classic books to read at day and write graffiti against society's oppression at night. They were two souls intertwined together as they were one.
He approached him carefully, still afraid of a rejecting reaction, but Dean was already almost asleep, lying on his side towards the centre of the bed.
Listen, it’s four in the morning, I’m exhausted and I’m not even sure if I’m dreaming all this. Now I’m going to sleep, you do whatever you apparently do while I’m asleep, and then we’ll talk tomorrow morning. Okay?”
At first nothing happened.
I know I'm not the best Cas. I'm stubborn, and relentless, and I feel like I'm not giving you all the attentions you deserve. You're human now, and how am I helping you? To cope with all this shit you took on drugs, and all I do is run around the camp barking orders.
I haven’t cooked in years, but I hope my pancakes are still okay”
What are your plans now, you still haven't told me how are you here and what happened while we were away."
“Of course I would. He’s my family after all. And I would do anything for my family”
Dealing with those ghouls had been awful, and we got there just in time. Poor Donna and Claire were kept in an abandoned house's basement, all bloody and bruised, and alive just because Jody was keeping all three monsters busy and away from them. While I sneaked in the basement, Dean took care of the ghouls, but, while Jody got out of it with only a black eye, Dean became their personal punching bag before having the chance to behead 'em.
"I AM OVERREACTING? I AM OVERREACTING? I SHOW YOU OVERREACTING!" His body tensed for a second, and the next moment, he was chasing Dean through the bunker's hallways, knife raised, screaming like a mad man
"What has gotten you into such a good mood tonight?" Cas can't help but ask, the first words spoken in hours.
It may not seem much, but it's a beginning. They both have a lot to discuss of.
He would never forget the immense amount of gratitude directed at him that transpired from the little animal’s eyes the first time he woke up and blinked at him.
Back at home, later in the evening, both exhausted by the tiring session of shopping, they collapsed on the sofa, and Cas, gathering all his courage, kissed Dean for the first time, hesitantly, not quite sure of what to do.  Dean grinned like a madman, hugged him, and peppered his face of small kisses, Castiel blushing furiously below him.
He blindly reached for the light, abruptly turning it on.
“WHAT THE FUCK?” He screamed, jumping from the bed.
“Dean, I’ll try to explain, but you need to calm down. Please, you don’t need to worry.” The man got up from the bed, one hand still clutching the sheets, the other raised in the air as if trying to approach a growling dog.
“Stay still, Dean. I’m trying to sleep” A sleepy voice said from beside him, while a hand softly poked him on his forearm.
"Ugh.. nah Cas, I think I'll leave the hippy-guru stuffs to you."
His body started to change. His back arched, his whole body shrinked, and then, he disappeared.
I’m Cas.”
“Oh man..” he is clutching at his stomach “you know, just today, six people asked me if it hurt when I fell from heaven, and then you show up, say the most awkward thing you could have possibly ever said, and still you indeed have my face tattooed on your leg! How is that even possible?”
“Should I keep on calling you like that? I named you, I deprived you of your identity.”
What do you suggest?”
"I need you too, Dean. Fuck I missed you so much.
Sometimes I like to stretch my legs, these legs, so at night, when I’m sure you’re deep in your sleep, I shift back and.. take a walk in the kitchen or.. sleep.  As I said, you kinda sleep like a bear. Last night I must have been too tired to notice you were waking up.
Holy mother, that voice, he has just barely heard a couple of words and he is already.. wait a second, he hadn’t planned for the man to watch at him with a bit of unease in his eyes.
“Well, I would say..” he takes a step back, frowning “that is the creepiest pick-up line someone ever used on me”
Car keys already in hand, he sprung out of the bunker. Sam and Cas had left him there to rest a little after their last hunt, where a ghost had thrown him out of a window, breakin two of his ribs. The said he could help with the researches from there, having the bunker's archives at hand, but he was growing restless  minute after minute, and this was exactly what he needed. A breath of fresh air couldn't do him anything but good anyway, couldn't it?
Every doubt sorted out, Dean covered the already little space that divided them and hugged him, whispering "It's so good to see you again brother"
And when our last day will come, Dean, I will follow you without hesitation, because I know it will be the best thing to do, don't doubt it for a second. Capisce?"
With a jump he makes them both stand, and a smirk is now painted on his face.
How could this be real? Yeah, Dean had only knew him in his cat form, but Cas was the sweetest, most adorable cat Dean had ever had the luck to know.
The pie was delicious tho. I ate it all.
He got out of the Impala and marched toward him, but before Benny could say anything, he found his face splashed with holy water, a silver knife pointed at him. His smile never left his lips anyway.
"Yeah, your boyfriend, the angel! You mentioned him so he must still be around."
He must have been so embarassed back then, being with the poor city drunk's son. Pitied by half the city and despised by the other half. Finding freedom only after moving into another city and never coming back. He tells him that, and by the twitch of Castiel's eye, he can tell he striked.
But on the other hand.. those eyes.. they were the first thing he noticed.
“Ehy, ehy, there. It’s alright Cas. I don’t need all this devotion.” He started patting him in the back “I fed you with leftovers, it’s not like I saved a bus of children from certain death.”
"I'm afraid to lose you, Cas. As we've lost anyone else.
"Oh! This?" A shy smile painted the angel's face "When I came back the bunker was empty, then I saw the message you had left me, and I figured it wouldn't have been very wise to call you back, since I could disturb you, so I decided I could at least make myself useful. Your fridge was desert, so I went on a supply run, and started to cook something. I made bacon and a pie, and well, I hope they're good. I followed every instruction I found on the internet but I couldn't taste it cause, you know, molecules.. but - wait a second" he focused his eyes on Dean, who was standing beside him with his mouth hang open
Two things happen simultaneously. Dean turns the key to start the car, and he presses the brake pedal. There's a loud pop, and blue, green, and gold glitter explodes all over Dean and Baby's once-immaculate interior.
FUCK. What am I gonna do? Everything is suddenly too much, and he slides down against the bathroom wall, head in his hands. Tears fall down his face, splattering on the tile. Sobs wrack his body as he gives into the need to cry out his fears. He thought himself a fuck up before, but this is a whole new level. He isn’t just responsible for himself now, he has a child. A child that will need him to get his shit together and stop feeling sorry for himself on the hard bathroom floor. He blows his nose in a wad of toilet paper, splashes cold water on his face, and drinks from his cupped hands. Blowing out a breath, he strips and slides under his pile of blankets. His hands automatically move to his stomach, gently rubbing circles over the sleeping inhabitant. In the quiet, he whispers:
“How much more is there?”
xxXXXxxXXXxx
"Here, you'll need this." Gabe tosses something over Dean, and he immediately feels a measure of relief. Gabe has covered him in Cas' trench coat. It smells strongly of
“Overrated, in my opinion.” He looks into Dean’s eyes. “In all seriousness though, is this okay? Tell me, and I’ll back off.” He makes as if to get off of Dean’s lap, but Dean latches onto his thighs.
After Cas returns from his French vacation, Dean slows down on banishings. He manages almost two whole months before he poofs Cas to another random location. No matter what Sam says, Dean was not being childish.
He wants to draw him.
have gone overboard in the baby department at Target) into another drawer. The kid can’t have too many clothes, can he? Babies puke a lot. Besides, who knows how long it will take to get Dean’s luggage from Amtrak, and what condition it will be in when it arrives? So yeah, lots of clothes for baby and daddy. The bunch of balloons go in the corner, and out of the second suitcase comes a teddy bear that Gabe puts on the table next to Dean. Empty luggage goes into the small closet, and as he looks around, Gabe decides that he’s done the best he can. Now, it’s time to talk to someone about his nephew.
xxXXXxxXXXxx
Finals are breathing down his neck again, and Dean’s fucking wiped. The further into his program he gets, the more complex his courses get, which means his finals become less about regurgitating information and more about applying what he’s learned. He’s also back to pulling doubles at Pam’s on the weekends, in addition to his work study program. Even so, he’s going to have to find a second (third?) job, if he wants to keep the little studio he’s renting. There’s really just not enough hours in the day. He hasn’t talked to Sam since Michael left. He’s been so stressed out that he knows there’s no way he’d be able to hide it from him. Then he’d just have to argue about how he’s not coming home, how he can’t face John after what Michael did to him, and how he’s not going to burden Bobby with another of John Winchester’s sons. Just because Dean knows Michael’s an asshole doesn’t mean that he’s not still blaming himself for him leaving. It doesn’t make sense, but it’s how his mind works.
"Where the hell have you been, Cas?"
The roads are clear and traffic is light. Dean makes it to the mall and begins the search for a parking space big enough for Baby. He doesn't mind walking a bit to keep her from getting abused at the hands of careless mall patrons. It takes a bit, but he's finally able to locate an acceptable space in the same postal code as the mall entrance. It's fucking cold outside, so he makes his way quickly into the artificial heat of the crowded mall.
He'd heard Cas come home last night, when he had turned on his own shower. That was one of the curses to living in these older buildings, the noisy plumbing. He'd been in the middle of a
“Goin’ to the library. I’ve got finals.”
That’s it. Dean feels like family. Granted, Jimmy doesn’t get to see his as often as he’d like, but he remembers how it feels to be around them. Sometimes, it’s comforting to know that all he has to do is pick up the phone, or send an email or text message. Other times, not so much. Like when his older brother sends him questionable memes at all hours. Or when yet another planned visit from his younger brother gets postponed—again. They’re both supposed to come see him in a few months. Maybe he’ll be able to introduce them to Dean. Happy with this current train of thought, he starts thinking of ways to get Dean to come hang out with them. He should probably get to know him a little more before he springs his brothers on him.
“Well, that’s awesome. When were you going to tell me this?” Dean’s not hurt, he’s pissed. He follows as Michael takes a load of luggage out to the hallway to place on a cart that Dean had missed when he first came up.
“Lead the way.”
“What’s going on, Michael?”
He doesn’t tell Gabe about the difficulties he had. He didn’t really have much trouble until he came to Dean’s room.  He’d found himself unable to spend much time in there without...problems. The room was absolutely saturated in pregnant omega pheromones.
A crease mars his brow, and a low moan escapes him. Slowly moving to consciousness, he kicks the blankets off, suddenly too hot. The ache in his head is persistent, but it’s quickly losing its slot as Dean’s Number One Discomfort to the roiling in his gut. He swallows and his eyes fly open. Scrambling, he just makes it to the bathroom before he’s heaving over the toilet. Dinner was long enough ago that it’s mostly bile, but the cramps are threatening to rip him apart. Of course, the pressure caused by the heaving only exacerbates the throbbing in his head, and he groans as he rests his cheek on the cool tiles of the floor. What the actual fuck is this? He hasn’t felt this bad since he first presented. That heat had been...heat. He scrambles to his feet and rushes across the room to the pile of textbooks that serves as his night table. With shaking hands, he opens the HeatTrak app on his phone.
Dean’s not afraid to admit that he’s out of his element in Sephora. Judging by the glazed eyes of several other guys in the store, he’s not the only one. The place is packed, and he’s got no idea what exactly he wants. He knows that he wants some of those face mask things that are supposed to be relaxing and make your skin feel amazing. The question is, which one? There’s literally dozens of choices. The directions mention skin care routines, and now there’s even more stuff he needs to know. Which moisturizer works best? Is a toner really necessary? Why is the tiniest pot of goop the most expensive one? Should he have done a little more research? He’s about to cave in and just get another gift card, when a voice straight out of his fantasies asks “Can I help you find anything?”
xxXXXxxXXXxx
More scrubbing.
“Easy, tiger.” Carefully, not sure how well Gabe would do, she transferred the sleeping infant into Gabe’s arms. “Support his head, there ya go.” Gabe stares down into the face of his nephew and takes a deep, shaky breath.
He locates the tape marked “Dean's Kick Ass Christmas” and inserts it into the tape deck. “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town” blares out of the speakers and Dean backs out of the garage, singing along and bobbing his head.
Gabe looks at his shoulder. Sure enough there’s a damp, sticky patch that he missed while he was cleaning up after Jellybean spit up on him. “Gross. Thought I got all of it.”
Number the first!
Dean’s not even angry about it anymore. It used to infuriate him that he was expected to do everything for everyone else. Now, he accepts it. He molds himself to what everyone needs to be. He’s gotten good at playing roles assigned to him—so good that sometimes, he’s not even sure who he is anymore. Whatever. He shrugs.
Dean slides the card into his breast pocket. “Awesome. I’ll definitely call you. Thanks for all of your help. I am officially the best brother out there.”
Jimmy shoves his face away, laughing. “Ass!”
“Fuck!” Holding Jellybean close, he lets the tears fall.
“No,” Michael shakes his head. “No, Dean. After what you’ve just told me, I don’t want you living out of your car. Come stay at my place. No funny business, I swear.” He holds out his hands in the universal gesture for ‘honest,’ and Dean leans in on the table.
He’s tall, almost Dean’s height, mussed hair, beige trench coat falling around his calves and a bulging messenger bag worn crossbody over what could possibly be broad shoulders. It’s hard to tell with the flasher coat obscuring his view. He starts at the sound of Dean’s storm door opening (
Fine.
, omega stereotypes!) but as it was, his only concerns were for his baby and Jimmy. “Where are they?! Where’s my baby! Where’s Jimmy?!” He’s so busy thrashing that he doesn’t notice a nurse emptying a syringe into his IV.

“Look, Dean. This was never going to be a long-term thing. I was only here on assignment. Now, my assignment is up and I’m going home.” Checking through the drawers and closet, Michael zips his garment bag. He removes his shaving kit from the ensuite, places it in his last open duffel, and zips it closed.
“I’ll have to thank him if he ever comes back.” Dean’s not about to refuse cash, not when he and Sammy are putting aside any extra money they can. Not to mention the outrageous prices of textbooks.
“Honey, I’m home!” he calls into the apartment with a cheeky grin. He knows it’s a line, but it’s a classic for a reason. The living room is empty, and the place is quiet. When he goes into the kitchen for a glass of water, he finds that empty, too. Placing his glass in the dishwasher, he heads down the hall to the bedroom and stops in the doorway. Michael has several duffels and suitcases, as well as his garment bag, spread out on the bed. Most are full. He’s obviously been at this for a while.
“Dean. I’m Dean, and my sister in law is Eileen.”

“I’m telling you now, aren’t I? Honestly, this is why it’s so bothersome getting involved with omegas. You’re all so needy and clingy.”
at Dean. "Did you banish Cas?
A couple days later, Dean finds another ornament in his mailbox. It's one of those miniature bottles that holds ridiculously tiny amounts of booze, all done up with a red bow. "Raise your holiday spirits" is written in script on a gift tag that’s shaped like a sleigh bell. Dean laughs and looks at Cas’ closed front door.
"I worry, Dean, because from the first time I walked in here, you struck me as family. I need to help you, protect you, and I keep having to remind myself that it's not my place. I can't explain it any better than that. I wish I could. I'm angry at the people who've abandoned you, and I get angry at you, working yourself harder than you should be."
Dean didn’t even know he
“Dean.” Michael’s voice is a strained growl, his irises ringed with a thin line of red. He hands him another card. “My address. I’ll be waiting.”
“Mmm, good,” Cas says, ghosting his lips over Dean’s jaw. “Do you know how long I’ve wanted to have you like this?” Dean groans as he continues down his neck, across his face. “The day you came out to introduce yourself. Those pants left
, he thought as he once again wiped his hands on his jeans.
“Thanks, Balth. I don’t deserve you guys.”
“Mr. Charles Novak?”
Cas snorts out a laugh. “What? It worked, didn’t it?”
The next time it happened, Cas had been gone for 3 days when Dean's phone pinged with a notification.
And sore, as he discovers when he shoots up in the bed, suddenly wide awake and alert.
successful. Not only did he have stuff to make other stuff with, he also had stuff to organize and store that stuff in and with. And stuff to label that neatly organized stuff with. He had a lot of new stuff, and he couldn't wait to get started.
“There are quite a few options. You wouldn’t be the first to be a bit overwhelmed.” The man turns around, and Castiel is struck with
Dean's quite proud of himself for not freaking straight out when Cas proposed. Fortunately, his brain had short-circuited, leaving him rooted to the spot as he watched Cas talk to JB, as if he hadn't just dropped a bomb on Dean's entire life. Gods, he wanted to say 'yes' to Cas, but he can't. Cas thinks that JB is his nephew. He thinks Dean was married to Jimmy. He has no idea that Dean's just a lying sack who didn't have any options after being abandoned while pregnant. "Gods, Jimmy. I've fucked up."
His shopping was done, and he had scored a date with a smoking hot guy. This day goes down as a win.
“You know, Cas, if you wanted my number, all you had to do was ask.” Dean smiles, all charm, as Castiel merely lifts his eyebrow again and continues ringing.
He wants him moaning underneath him.
His finals finally (heh) over with, Dean’s first morning off finds him burrowed under a giant pile of blankets, catching up on some much-needed sleep. As if the stomach issues weren’t bad enough on their own, he’s been plagued with a splitting headache for the last week. It made his last final almost impossible to get through, and he’d been violently ill as soon as he got out of the building. He’s starting to worry that there might actually be something wrong. He knows stress can really fuck you up, and he’s doing what he can to take it easy. For Dean, that means he’s only tending the bar during the week, and taking Sunday’s lunch shift off. Sunday lunch tips are usually garbage anyway, so he’s not too worried about the time off.
“Don’t have to tell me you love me, Jim Jam. I know.” Dean made kissy faces at him and batted his eyelashes exaggeratedly.
“The way he just
He rubs the back of his neck and laughs nervously.
I have more pics. Brace yourself.”
for an angel. He never claimed to
At the nurse’s station in the hallway, Gabe asks for Dr. Mills. It’s only a few minutes before she arrives, smiling and reaching out a hand to shake. “Hello again, Gabe. Did you get everything squared away?”
He’d only meant to close his eyes for a moment, really. Just long enough to stave off the headache he felt brewing behind them. Of course, this meant that he woke up several hours later, face smashed into his textbook and a champion crick in his neck. Too tired to be truly disgusted with himself, he shuffles to the laundry room to put the wet stuff in the dryer, then goes back to his room to go to bed. Dean’s not the master of self-care by any stretch of the imagination, but he recognizes when his body is demanding a change of pace.
He doesn’t remember doing it (pity), but suddenly John is laid out on the floor, face bloody and unconscious. Sammy stands in the doorway, concern and fury warring for dominance on his face.
“Eventually…” Cas leaned in and pressed their foreheads together, resting his hands on Dean’s shoulders. Dean closed his eyes and fought with himself a moment before he wrapped his arms around the other mans’ waist.  He would not make this harder on Cas than it already was. Of course, it was hard on him too. However, he had the luxury of being in his home with the rest of his family. Cas was banished from them with no one. He knew as difficult as it was for him, he had the better end of the deal no doubt.
“That was your fault…” Cas groaned out; his pupils blown to black holes as he flopped back on the pillow. “Do it again…” He moaned as he bucked his pelvis up.
On nights Sam was at the bunker, usually with Eileen, they all hung out at the War Room table, swapping stories and laughing till all hours. It felt good to laugh and to see them laugh. The oppressive blanket of Chuck’s control had been thrown off their shoulders. Even Dean’s small affections had increased. A hand on his shoulder here. A squeeze of his arm there. He had not, as Cas had feared, withdrawn from him as a result of his confession the night he died. Quite the opposite. Dean seemed more comfortable with him, their elbows brushing as he sat next to him at breakfast each morning. However, nothing was ever said about the night he’d died and the things he’d said. Not by Dean and certainly not by Castiel himself. He was brave, but he wasn’t stupid. If Dean was happy with their arrangement, Cas was happy as well…and if he felt a lingering hollowness at those touches, always craving for more, that was
Dean looked at him and put a hand over his heart, pretending to be hurt. “Low blow, Cas. Low blow. This time we’re both kicked out.”
Sam closed down his laptop and stood up, stretching his back by putting his hands to the small of his back. “Well, why don’t you stay here and wait on him. I hate for him to spend New Year’s alone…” Dean was about to argue when Sam added as an afterthought, “Oh, and this show is alcohol free. There will be little kids there.”
A silent nod of agreement followed from everyone as a whole. As the Angels ushered Cas away to continue healing him, he turned to Dean. “Be ready. She will most likely have her eyes on you as much as she will me.”
“I don’t eat…” Castiel said with annoyance in his tone as he tried to maintain patience.
“There are not enough versions of it to describe you,” Castiel growled out as he grabbed up his socks and shoes and started putting them on. Dean grabbed the door face and pulled himself up to a standing position.
“Let’s roll,” Dean said with an air of authority as he twirled his car keys between his fingers.
Dean pursed his lips and nodded. “Sounds about right.”
“As a heart attack, Cas. All I can think about these days is telling you how I feel but I could never make the words come out right and I was…I was still scared. Because if you
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, but not here. Come on,” He rose and stretched his back from sitting so long. He nodded his head toward the hall and Castiel followed, heading toward Dean’s room. Dean pushed his door open but Cas hesitated at the entrance. He looked around, noting every little difference from his last time here. He tried to memorize every detail, from the hastily made bed to the dangerously high stack of tapes and cds. Sam had encouraged Dean to buy his songs as MP3s on his phone, but Dean had rolled his eyes. He was an old soul, and he liked old things…Castiel smiled to himself as he lumped himself into old things Dean seemed to like. He leaned against the door frame, watching Dean. It really was his favorite pastime.
Cas and Dean are called to dine with Chuck, better known as God, but there is an unexpected and unwanted guest joining them that could take away the freedom that Cas has just begun to enjoy. Deals made may come back to haunt them but Chuck may be able to help him find the true freedom he seeks...but there's always a cost in any deal.
Dean took another sip and rolled his eyes.
“What else could they be doing if they
“I’m sorry I pushed, but he was so resolute that you and Sam that helped him through…” Jack said as he looked guiltily down at the floor, feeling the blame for Cas' unhappy outburst.
Sam looked to Jack, who joined him in his confusion. He shrugged in response and they followed him into the kitchen.
“I don’t feel so good,” Mary said, her face pale as well.
Sam couldn’t disagree so he stayed silent. He wouldn’t be opposed to just the tiniest bit of normalcy himself. He sighed and typed in the next interviewee's address in the GPS. "Take a left up here. Then we turn onto the highway."
“You said you wanted pie.”
Dean held a finger up, and idea springing to mind at his words, and Cas waited patiently. “Okay, swearing I get, but what about racist and homophobic shit people say? Wouldn’t that make this place end up kind of toxic?”
“GUARD THE EXITS! NO ONE LEAVES!” boomed a deep, gravelly voice amongst the Angels. Dean looked more closely. That voice….The armor covered their chests and shoulders, even going across the top ridge of their wings. They all wore helmets of the same material, making them all look the same except for their wing colors. He’d never seen Angel wings before other than in shadow form. How could he see them now….and how were there so many of them? Castiel had said there were less than twelve of them, but here there were hundreds. The demons streamed down from the bleachers, meeting the Angels in a noisy clash. Angel blades flashed in the hands of the Angels, but many of the Demons appeared to carry them as well.
Cas slowly slid his arms into it and fixed the collar and when he looked up, Dean’s eyes were saucers and his tongue flicked out to wet his lips.
“Oh shit, Cas. You know I don’t do your travel well,” Dean groaned, and he looked green just at the thought.
“Naomi, I will take you apart…” Castiel thundered out. The Angels from both sides began to back away from Castiel and Naomi. Even they could taste the danger in the air. The desperation.
“Excellent. Let me get you a box for your things.”  Cas turned as the bell on the door chimed and watched Dean go out to the car.
Dean grabbed the other duffel and jumped quickly out of the car. Excitement made him almost giddy as they entered and he whistled softly, admiring the dining area for the restaurant and the small store they had for toiletries and snacks. This was a far cry from the No Tell Motels they typically stayed at, with their stained carpet and thin walls that left nothing to the imagination. He set down his duffle on the floor in front of the check in counter and fished out his wallet, feeling Castiel at his back. He was greeted by a young girl with fiery red hair and freckles who could not have been more than twenty. He smiled charmingly, a skill he was very good at, and the clerk smiled back.
Dean smiled but quickly scrubbed his face with his palm and it was gone when he dropped it. “Don’t worry about that. So, did you pick up what she was putting down?”
“So…yeah," Dean said softly as he knocked his hand against the dessert box. "We can talk about these things like adults."
“Is…is it gonna be like that every time?” Dean was awash in a mixture of nervousness and anticipation at the prospect.
“Sure, that’s why you kept me around,” Castiel let heat leak into his eyes as he ran a finger down Dean’s jaw and watched with smugness as the man shuddered. “I’ll go talk to Aberia and the others…” Cas said abruptly as he left Dean standing alone in the kitchen, the only room they could find without Angels in it.
“Don’t leave without saying goodbye, Castiel,” Jack murmured as he groggily hugged him.
“Well, as you have all since figured out, Angels are essentially batteries. We are waves of celestial intent. Heaven needs us to function, but it, in turn, strengthens us the more time we spend there.”
and I've made my peace with him. Castiel isn’t perfect, but neither is Dean, and both of them have convinced me to give the other one a chance before, because they care about each other. You don’t have the right to stand there and tell them who they care about is wrong. They’ve both saved me and people
Castiel’s eyes narrowed and his jaw tightened. His fists clenched and unclenched at his side in a hidden show of frustration he’d picked up from Dean. “That is most definitely not something I was going to do. Where have you been?! Why are you hiding out in Heaven while all of this,” Cas gestured wildly around him, “is going on? You think I’d actually BOW right now?”  His voice held every bit of the frustration he was holding back.
“That is correct, Dean You are perfectly safe here.” Cas said softly as his eyes locked with his.
Sam sat down beside his brother, hesitating on his words a moment. “Even if we could, should we? If he’s the only thing standing between Heaven staying up and running and all the souls falling….”
The hotel room was dark save for the bathroom door that was open a crack, illuminating the tan carpet and the edges of the beds, their hunter green comforters about 30 years out of style. Jack had insisted on taking the couch since he wasn’t sleeping as much as in previous months. That had left Dean and Sam to one full bed and Mary with the other. Dean slept closest to the door, his back to the others. Jack’s bed for the night, the couch laid out in a loud pattern of pastel plaid that clashed with the comforters, was pushed up against the wall closest to Sam’s bed. Dean’s eyes were just slowly cracking open due to the snoring coming from his younger brother when he heard a loud gasp from Jack. Dean’s years of survival instincts kicked in and he rolled off the bed, taking a knee and feeling for the nightstand light. As it popped on, Sam sat straight up and had his pistol in his hand, aimed at the front door, which was sitting closed and harmless.  Mary, too, was sitting up with her weapon in her hand.
After a bit of cleanup, Dean is on the sofa while Cas gets them some water from the kitchen. He comes back with two glasses and the gift bag he’d brought. He hands it and a glass to Dean before taking his own seat. Excitedly, Dean tears into the bag. “Oh man, I can’t wait to see-”
Monopoly is serious business though.
“Cas, you don’t have to—”
attempts, but he had finally managed to get them angled and labeled ("Dean," and "Cas") the way he wanted them. Around the outer edge, he'd painted "It’s the most wonderful time for a beer." On the back was an invite to his place for said beer and burgers. "You, me, beer and burgers. My place at seven." Due to his not at all stalkerish attention paid to Cas' comings and goings, he knew that he usually got in around 6-615. He'd give him some time to unwind before he expected him to come over. Then, in a move that resulted in him questioning his life choices, he applied fine, shimmery glitter to the front of the ornament and left it to dry.
Finally it’s answered with a curt “ ‘lo?”
“Don’t, Sammy. He’s not worth it. Keep your head straight, get out of school.”
. Dean can practically
“Yes, Alpha. Please, Alpha. Fuck me hard. I’ll be good, I’ll—” they both cry out as Michael slams home with one thrust. Not giving either of them time to adjust, he pounds into Dean furiously. It’s not long before they’re both riding the edge, Michael’s knot catching on Dean’s rim on every pull out.
This year is shaping up to be one of Those Years. Finding Eileen's perfect gift this year is difficult. She and Sam just welcomed their first baby in September, and Dean wanted to give her something special. He already had the “World's Best Mom/Dad” novelty mugs, and a brewery tour booked for him and Sam. He needed something great for Eileen to finish up his shopping. He'd offer one of those “free babysitting, whenever” coupons, but he was enamored of the tiniest moose ever and had a standing offer to take him off their hands whenever they needed some alone time.
Two birds, one stone. Pick up JB, see Cas. Not that he should be looking for opportunities to spend more time with Cas, not if he wants to survive this with his heart intact. He already feels terrible about the ruse, even if it’s unintended. Dean might be lots of things, but he’s never been a malicious liar. He’s got to find a way out of this before someone gets hurt. The idea of leaving this family behind tears something inside him, so he puts it aside to think about later. Pasting a grin on his face, he bumps Cas’ office door open with his hip, hands full with the tray of snacks.
Dean just laughs, slapping his thigh. “Worked, didn’t it? I got you where I want you. Guess this just leaves one question, Cas.”
It’s ten o’clock by the time Dean drags himself into the apartment he shares with his dad and brother. He’s been going full-throttle since six this morning and all he wants to do is collapse onto his memory foam, but he’s still got a paper to work on, an exam to study for, Sammy to check on, and whatever mess his dad has left for him to clean up. Just once, he’d like for John to do his share of the housekeeping, so Dean would have some spare time. As it stands, he knows that he’s looking at an hour of clean-up before he hits the books.

He’s not sure what it is, but he
The baby stares at him.
Cas takes a sip from his beer and drapes his arms over Dean’s shoulders.
“Maybe I do, and maybe I don’t. But it’s what I’ve got right now. No use whining for what I don’t have.” Business picks up after that, and Michael leaves again before Dean’s shift ends. Again, his tip jar is sporting a few large bills.
He just plain
(See the end of the chapter for
Cackling, Dean grabs a glass of water and joins him at the bar. Pam makes him take fifteen minute breaks every hour. “Safety, Winchester. Suck it up,” she snarks at him.
“Thanks, Cas. Looks like he’s gotten attached to you.”
The shame that burned in him after those times was unbearable. This was his brother’s husband, father of his nephew, and he wanted...he wanted what belonged to Jimmy.
Michael’s nostrils flare, and Dean continues. “Been thinking about talking you into my back seat since you first came in. Fog the windows up, test the shocks. She doesn’t have a/c, so it’d be really,” he exhales on a moan “hot.” He sits back down, shooting a cocky grin across the table and slinging his arm over the top of the bench seat.
. Thankfully, Castiel manages to keep that particular recommendation to himself as he shoves himself back into retail mode. He can’t resist entirely, though. He may be named for an angel, but he’s only human, and he has a powerful need to know more about the man in front of him. “First, I recommend you tell me your name, because this is going to take awhile.” He’s going to make sure that this guy is the last one he helps this evening.
“Shhh...I know you will. Gonna be so good for me, Omega,” Michael lets out a deep sigh as he frees his cock from its confines and presses against Dean’s ass. “Mmmm, is this what you need?”
"Dean, don't you think that's a little childish?"
He has the good grace to wince. “It didn’t occur to me until afterward how that probably looked. I promise I’m not trying to bribe your boss, or imply that you can be bought. I just remember how it felt waiting tables through college.”
Now Dean’s looking at Cas’ crotch, again obscured by the flasher coat.
he thinks as the door flies open, bringing a gust of wet air, some leaves, and a...man. His eyes narrow in concentration as he takes in the new arrival. About his height, messy dark hair, snug dark wash jeans, and a grey t-shirt damp on the shoulders and spattered with rain. The man shakes his head and throws water everywhere, making his hair look even more like he got personal with an electrical outlet. Wiping his feet on the entry mat, he makes his way to the bar. Dean slides behind it just as the guy takes a seat.
"Dude. I heard you two bitching at each other. Now you're here and it's quiet. You either sorted things out, or-"
When Dean had stood up, Jimmy was able to see the small swell under his apron. His protective instincts had flared, and they’d only gotten stronger when he’d seen neither ring nor bite on Dean. An omega, alone, tired, and carrying. And with
When Cas returns this time, he comes bearing pie and beer. He lifts the items with a cautious grin. "Peace offering?"
Forty five minutes later, Dean is holding a shopping basket loaded with jars, tubes, boxes, and a kit that claims to be essential to his grooming ritual.
“Yeah, well, I’ve basically been raising him since our mom died. Dad only took an interest in him after he presented as alpha. ‘Course that just pisses Sammy off, since he couldn’t be bothered to be a dad before, why should he bother now? They fight almost constantly. I’m actually glad to be gone so much.”
“When I think about you, I touch my elf.”
“Dude, calm down. You’re fine. I just wanted you to know that table five absolutely raved about your service. One guy tried to get me to give up your number,” Pam laughs, mostly because Dean getting a number from a customer isn’t an uncommon event. She used to amuse herself by giving customers who asked for her waitstaff’s numbers the numbers to phone sex hotlines instead, but word got out and people rarely ask now. “Must have been new to the area,” she comments, “Haven’t seen him before.”
Seven o’clock has Cas at Dean’s door, his ornament in a festive gift bag. He’d had just enough time after finishing his project to take a quick shower, so his hair was going in all directions and he was sporting two days’ worth of five o’clock shadow. The nice thing about the current trends being what they were meant that his habitual stubble and bedhead was considered “stylish,” rather than “I hit snooze too many times this morning.” He knocks on Dean’s front door, a grin splitting his face.
Dean's phone pings.
“Now I’m not gonna be able to watch Captain America without getting a boner!”
Dean looks at the card. On the card is Castiel’s name and phone number and the words “For a good time, call.” He snorts out a laugh.
“They should buy you a mug. Good night, Dean. I look forward to hearing from you.”
. He begins rambling “My sister in law just had a baby a couple months ago. I want to make her an awesome new mom gift, and I was thinking along the lines of bubble baths and-” he gestures at his face “that skin stuff that's supposed to be all relaxing and energizing. She’s dealing with an infant and my kid brother, so she deserves some pampering. Gotta be honest though, I wasn't expecting all these choices.”
“Dean, can I tell you something without making things weird?”
“Did you seriously hum
“Yeah, um, please.”
...the mall.
The only downside to Dean's Christmas-palooza? His near obsession with finding That Perfect Gift™ for each person on his list. Some years were simple, and he managed everyone with minimal fuss. Other years, he was grateful that he started hunting in October. Those are the years that he's glued to his phone, watching as the package tracker gets closer and closer to his house.
Could be worse, he thinks. He could expect me to stay at home popping out a litter every year. Dean’s at least grateful that Michael doesn’t expect him to conform to the same secondary gender bullshit that John had thrust on him. If John’d had his way, he’d be married off to one of his drunken alpha buddies. The thought makes him sick to his stomach.
Interesting.
Castiel stayed gone for a week.
He'd enjoyed that last wood disc ornament, so he was making another one. What he wasn't expecting, though, was exactly how fucking sticky his homemade modge-podge would get if he had to rework some things. As a result, the screen on his phone was cloudy where he checked his pins, he had bits of paper stuck in various places on his body, and his hands were covered in different-degrees-of-dry-or-drying sticky white goop.
“We. Where are we going? I’m going to crash with a friend. You’re going to Bobby’s.” Dean doesn’t trust John not to take his anger out on Sammy once he wakes up, and he’ll be damned if he’s going to take the chance. Odds are good he’ll find couch space somewhere. If not, Baby’s backseat is plenty comfortable. It takes Dean less than fifteen minutes to grab what he considers essential, Sam takes less than that, and they’re out. He’s still got a few hours before his lunch shift, and he’s in no shape to deal with people right now, so he heads to the library after dropping Sammy off at the bus stop.
------------
He wants to paint him.
“Thank god,” Dean says, throwing his head back on the sofa. He’s hanging on by a thread. Who knew Cas was a freaking sex-fiend? Dean’s not complaining. He’s usually the take-charge type himself, but he’d be lying if he said being the sole focus of that deep blue gaze wasn’t hot as fuck.
he thought with a smile. He’s got enough time to make his next ornament.
Dean’s more than happy to move the conversation into food. Less likely to be awkward for both of them. “Can’t go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger. Goes with everything.” He takes the rest of his order, returns the menu to its place, and moves down the bar to pull the draft he ordered with his burger.
Not that Michael lets him pay for anything. Dean’s tried, and Michael just looks at him and tells him to keep his money. He didn’t bring him home to contribute to the expenses anymore than he expected him to trade sex for a place to live. He could do a lot worse than having Michael as his alpha, and Dean knows it. He’s not exactly in love with him or anything, but he’s also never really considered love a requirement. He’s seen what it did to his dad to lose his mom, and he has no desire to experience that level of loss. Give him a relationship with mutual respect and some affection, and he’ll be satisfied. Bringing it up to Michael has been an exercise in frustration, though. Every time he mentions the future, Michael either changes the subject or distracts him from his train of thought. It all comes out to not talking about it at all.
Cas, in his slacks and rolled up oxford, wearing a sleeping JB while he speaks into the headset on his ear. He’s got one hand on the baby’s butt, and the other is scrolling on a tablet while he paces back and forth. He must have had another meeting today. Dean has to bite back a moan at the absolute perfection of the scene in front of him.
A few hours later, Castiel returns to Jimmy’s apartment carrying several (reusable) bags from a local fiber arts store just before the movers show up. After directing them what to take, he carries his haul to a café  he’s been frequenting since he came to town. He doesn’t want to get in the movers’ way, and he doesn’t want to see the remnants of his brother’s life hauled out of his home in boxes. Instead, he orders his coffee and pastry “for here” and sits in one of the café’s “comfy chairs,” as he’s heard the baristas call the overstuffed leather chairs near the window. He passes a very comfortable afternoon knitting a pair of bee-striped booties to match JB’s hat.
Castiel wanted to roll around in it.
“I know I don’t. I
“Ding ding ding! Tell ‘er what she’s won, Johnny!”
He's a grown-ass man that doesn't throw fits over board games.
Gabe lets himself into his hotel room later that evening, juggling a bag of takeout, a six pack, and his phone, on which his brother is video calling him.
Castiel is momentarily put out. “Why do you get to be the cool uncle? Jimmy’s my twin, that should automatically make me the cool uncle.” He’d complain more, if he weren’t absolutely enthralled with the small human in the new photographs. “He needs those little feet things. His feet will get cold.”
Dean just stands there for a second, goggling at Cas.
Gabriel is all but rubbing his hands together. “But as Cassie’s gonna be busy for the next few days, ya get me. What do you need me to do?” Gabriel opens the notepad app on his phone and makes a list of the items Dr. Mills tells him to bring to the hospital. He’ll have to stop in town for some of it, and then he can head to the hospital. He’s all but bursting to get his hands on his new nephew.
******
Part of Dean’s worries are put to rest when Pam gives him a hug and tells him he can keep working as long as he’s careful. The other part isn’t so easily fixed. He’s only got a six month lease on his studio, and no ideas for what happens when that runs out. He could look for a different place, but this one was hard enough to find, and he knows exactly how hard it is to find affordable housing in this area. Getting a second (third?) job is out of the question, since few employers are willing to hire a new employee that they’re going to have to replace in less than a year.
“I know, Gabriel, and I’m so very sorry. I’m calling because Dean’s son needs help.”
The first time it happened, it took Castiel 34 hours to get back to the bunker.
No one asked you.
Dean doesn’t remember ever being this exhausted before. Sure, he’s been tired, he’s been sick, he’s been sick and tired, but there’s always an end in sight to that kind of tiredness. Jimmybean decided that sleep was for the weak, and Dean can’t remember the last time he slept more than fifteen minutes at a time. He’s about to invest in a new baby carrier because he’s wearing this one almost 24/7, and it could really stand a wash.
He makes it into the lot of a deserted park and throws himself out of the car. He barely makes it to the grass before he's violently ill, the pining toxins already suffusing his body. When he finally has nothing left to bring up, he struggles to the passenger side and opens the door, falling across the bench seat.
For the next few weeks, Michael is a regular fixture at Pam’s during Dean’s shifts—sometimes alone, often with coworkers, always tipping too much. When he’s alone, they talk. Well, Dean talks. It strikes him that he never talks about himself this much, to anybody. It’s nice to have someone show interest in him. He tells Michael about his job, his work-study, his classes, and what he wants to do with his degree. He brags about Sammy.
Because he’s a stubborn bastard on the best of days, Dean’s loaded down with bulging plastic bags. No, Sammy, he’s not gonna carry his own reusable bags. A guy that drives a car older than himself doesn’t exactly have his mind fixated on his carbon footprint. He pointedly ignores Sammy’s voice in his head saying that’s exactly why he should be concerned with his carbon footprint. By the time he gets inside, he’s gotta tap a kidney something fierce. He debates leaving the tests in their package, just to be an asshole. Considering the only one that’ll bother is him, he grabs the box and dashes into the bathroom for the second time today.
Dean’s totally down with that plan. It sounds like a blast.
Dean wanders through the store with little to no purpose in mind other than stocking up on easily made meals and snacks. Plenty of Gatorade. Laundry stuff. A couple new car magazines. Mattress protector pads. Three EPTs. He can feel his brain short-circuit as he looks at the innocuous packaging.
The next day starts as usual. Coffee, breakfast, research, supply check. Dean's feeling like a pot roast for dinner, so he makes a quick list and grabs Baby's keys.
he’d leave small, handcrafted ornaments that depict whatever home the new arrivals have settled down in. Most folks don't even know where they come from, and he's okay with that. Still, Dean's acknowledgement was leaving him with a warm glow of...satisfaction?
“The plumbing is old, and the walls are thin. If you didn’t want your neighbors to know what you’re doing in the shower, you should make more of an effort to be less loud.”
Dean's eyes almost bug out of his head. He thought Balthazar had bit it years ago. Stranger things have happened to them.
“I’ll figure something out. Worst comes to worst, it won’t be the first time I’ve slept in my car.”
“Dean,” Cas says, a bit drowsy-sounding, even though he’s wide awake.
“...Okay, Gabe. This is Doctor Mills from Memorial Hospital. I’m calling on behalf of your brother-in-law, Dean Novak.”
Sam just
Christmas music.
“Yes.” He smirked as Dean groaned. Cas stepped away, raising his own brow. “I believe I was promised beer and burgers?”
He’d eventually packed what he’d wanted to save, and the rest was waiting on the truck from Goodwill. Jimmy hadn’t had a car, so he assumes the keys are Dean’s. No keyfob means checking cars in the lot. A little ways down the sidewalk, Castiel hits the jackpot. A sleek black muscle car with a car seat strapped in the back was parked under a streetlight and covered in a fine dusting of yellow pollen.
“Thank you,” he mouths silently, for the benefit of the person on the phone, or the sleeping baby, Dean doesn’t know. He doesn’t care, because at that moment Cas licks his lips, chasing stray juice. Dean has
I’m not ready.
“I will. Being here beats my empty apartment.” Michael smiles and sips his drink, and Dean can feel him watching him as he works the line of customers standing and sitting at the bar. His smile is all charm, and not even the 85% fake one most people in customer-facing industries develop over time. Dean genuinely likes talking to people, most of the time. He even has more than a few regulars, if the casual touches and deep laughs are anything to judge by.
“Yep!” He lists all of the things he brought with him and what he did with them. Jody gives her approval and walks him to the nursery. Gabe is practically bouncing with nerves and excitement. He hasn’t seen his nephew since they admitted him and Dean, and he’s psyched to get to actually meet the baby. His face is almost pressed against the glass, watching Jody as she lifts a small blue sausage-shaped bundle into her arms before she turns to leave the nursery. Gabe’s at the door when she comes out, making “gimme” motions with his hands.
far enough to let Cas squeeze in, purposely rubbing against him. Cas inhales deeply.
He scowls as he unloads his cart onto the belt and continues his mental argument.
“Do you have more pictures?” Castiel’s voice is still quiet, subdued.
With that, Michael walks out the door, leaving Dean standing in the middle of the living room, mute with fury. “Oh, don’t forget,” Michael pops his head back in the door. “The lease is up at the end of the month! You can leave your key on the counter, the manager will take care of it.”
Castiel finds that once he begins knitting again, he doesn’t want to stop. He rationalizes it by touting the stress relief it’s brought him, as well as helping to care for JB. Northeastern winters are harsh and the little guy will need all the warm clothes he can get. If he’s started making a blanket for Dean too, well, it’s what he’d do for any of his family. Dean’s going to need comforting just as much as the rest of them do. The downside to this is that he now has a large bag of caps and booties, more than Jellybean could ever wear. He decides to keep some and make a donation to the hospital that’s been caring for Dean and JB since the accident. He decides to make the donation in memory of Jimmy, and it soothes a tiny bit of the ache in his heart. Gabe comes to help out on the day that the Goodwill comes for the rest of Jimmy’s things and takes Castiel’s offerings back to the hospital with him.
“A little damp out?” Dean asks, grabbing a lunch menu from underneath the bartop. This close, he can see the guy has striking blue eyes and a sharp jaw. Dean’s both drawn to and intrigued by him, and it takes him a minute to figure it out. They guy’s attractive, sure, anyone with eyes can see that, but there’s something else he can’t quite explain. He feels like family. His scent both calms and relaxes him. For the first time in weeks, Dean’s headache fades.
He pulls out his phone to check his list for the stores he wants to check out. The more organized he is, the less time he spends dithering and stressed out, and the more time he gets to enjoy the holidays. He compares the list with the map and decides to start at the farthest end and make his way back.
John’s voice plays in his head. “Not good for anything but knottin’ and breedin’.” Joke’s on him. Michael never knotted him. Now he knows why, because he never planned to stay. Looks like he left something behind after all.
The man grins and leans forward enough to be easily heard over the noise of the Saturday night crowd. “Your real number, preferably, but I’ll settle for a scotch.”
Cheeks chipmunked out, he nods his head quickly, trying to wash down a large amount of burger with a swig of his beer. He wipes his hands on his jeans and holds one out. “I’m Jimmy, and I think this place has ruined me for all other burgers.” Jimmy’s got a good grip, strong without trying to crush Dean’s hand. If they hold on a little longer than is considered normal, it doesn’t seem to bother them.
"Calling Short Stack…"
Dean licks his lips and cocks an eyebrow at him. “Me, or the burgers?” Cas brought his mouth right next to Dean’s ear.
“Watch out, I’ll hold you to that.”
Michael loads the last of his luggage onto the waiting cart, then steps up to Dean. “We had a good time, Dean. I saved you, took care of you. You could at least be grateful for what we had.” He pulls a thick envelope from an inside pocket of his suit jacket. “Here. This will help you stay afloat until you catch another alpha. I had fun. I’ll call you next time I’m in town.”
If anyone said that Dean Winchester basically skipped out to the parking lot, they were dirty rotten liars.
As he handed off his current customer to a cashier, he scanned the store for anyone in need of assistance. At this time of year, there were many new customers in addition to the frequent shoppers, and they were extremely easy to spot. Ah, yes. Over there in the skincare section, a single man in a leather jacket. Must be shopping for his girlfriend or wife. It was Castiel’s experience that many (not all, mind you) men were still averse to the benefits of proper skincare. It was as if they felt it impugned on their masculinity or some such bullshit to slather their face in clay and just relax for a few minutes. He shrugged mentally and walked over towards his target, reading an easy sale. “Can I help you find anything?” He's all but oozing customer service and professionalism, ready to point him towards their selections of gift sets, until the guy starts rambling about a new mom Christmas gift for his sister in law. So, not here for a wife or girlfriend then.
Wait, what?! What’re those for? He almost turns his head, as if he’s going to answer a physical human being.
-----
"So I banished him. Looks like he landed in Denver this time."
, because Dean and Cas have been arguing for the last twenty minutes at max volume. At this point, he's not even sure what they're arguing about. Hell, he doesn't even think they know what they're arguing about anymore. He wishes he could just lock them in a room together until they either came to terms or fucked each other into a handy surface.
Dean bites his lip before leaning further across the table. “I’d be lying if I told you I haven’t been thinking about it.”
,) perhaps a little
And the worst one, the one that he repeated to himself every morning since.
Two weeks before Christmas.
“‘Sup Cassie?” Gabe drops his takeout on the kitchenette counter and cracks open a beer. After his emotional purge earlier, he figures that he deserves it.
“Same. You gonna be here for a while?” Dean would like to talk to him more, but duty calls and customers don’t tip for slow service, no matter how hot the bartender or how firm his ass.
“Dad’s sleeping off his latest round of doctor-prescribed painkillers. Try again.”
“Hi,” he says, holding his hand out. “I’m Dean. Just moved in a couple weeks ago.”
When he walked back into the bunker, Dean met him at the foot of the stairs.
Castiel glances around him. The living room is empty except for the furniture that will be donated. The kitchen is in a similar state. “Not much. Everything should be out in a few more days.”
“Ummm...Mr. Castiel Novak?”
He’s just added another item to his to-do list before he sacks out, so he doesn’t forget his idea. He was also going to have to stop at the store tomorrow, because there’s no way he’s not asking Cas over for beer and burgers this weekend.
threw up on me. I’ve met Jimmy’s son.” A wave of melancholy crests, and is pushed aside by joy as Gabe pulls up his photo gallery and starts texting photos.
“Yeah, Pam doesn’t take anyone’s bullshit, no matter how much cash they throw around.”
Cas is surprised by the strength of the pain that sears his chest at the thought of losing his nephew and Dean, even if he hasn’t met them yet. He knows Dean by scent, and losing him...he doesn’t even want to consider what that might do to him. He’ll do whatever it takes to keep Dean and JB close.
“Oh yeah? Which hotline did you give him?” Dean loves a good prank, and Pam had some really niche hotlines saved.
-” he grinds down in Dean’s lap, “to the imagination. And I saw how you fixated on my mouth. I bet you thought about stretching my lips around your cock, didn’t you?” He seals his mouth to Dean’s, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth and biting softly.
at me. Feels like he’s staring at my
“Caaaaaas…” Cas cracks one eye open to stare at Dean.
Then it doesn’t matter if we buy these. They’ll be negative, and then we can go drink ourselves stupid one night to unwind.
He pauses in the act of pushing the disconnect button.
"Sorry to burst your bubble there, Jim, but I'm alone because I chose to be. Trust me, the alternative is worse."
He’s barely inside when the scent hits him. Content alpha. Happy baby.
“Heya, Cas! Come on in,” Dean steps aside
louder than he usually was? Wouldn't be the first time he'd been described as a brat. Between that and his memory foam, he was feeling pretty pleased with himself. He sat down at his kitchen table with his coffee, queued up his Kick Ass Christmas Playlist, and got to work on his newest design.
The next time Dean banished Castiel, Cas kind of deserved it. Sam had told Cas about their old prank wars, and Cas found the idea intriguing. It started out as small things: the itching powder in his boxers was a classic that Cas couldn't pass up. Then he spent an afternoon swapping labels from all of Dean's beers onto a case of non-alcoholic beer and sticking them in the fridge. Changing the Netflix queue to all foreign art films and nature documentaries took him a couple of hours while the boys were sleeping. While doing laundry one day, he cropped a few of Dean's t-shirts. That one almost backfired on him, because Dean just cut the sleeves off, too, and paired them with his obscenely short cutoffs to wash Baby in. He even swapped all of the labels on Dean's cassette collection. (He made a list first, he's not a monster.)
feel, however, is restless. Knowing that he needs to settle his mind, (and his libido,) before attempting to start his grading, he goes upstairs to change into his running clothes.
Dean scrubs extra vigorously at his nail beds.
An accomplished flirt himself, Dean lets loose with a full-body laugh. “You comin’ on to me, Cas? I’m not that kind of girl. You’ve got to at least buy me dinner, first.”
Finally, exhausted from all of the emotional upheaval, he sleeps.
Chapter 1
Dean was actually pouting. It was cute, but Jimmy found it cute in the same way a chastised puppy is cute. Affection without heat.
Gabe takes a minute to get his voice under control and when he speaks it isn’t quite as shaky as it was before. “Like I was saying. Your alpha daddy was the one who kept me and Cassie in line. I’m older, but he was more mature.”
The phone barely rings when a panicked Gabe answers. "Dean! Where the hell are you? What the fuck happened? Cas is out cold on the bathroom floor!"
“Next time, Dean, I’m going to ride you.” Cas’ voice is rougher than usual, hot in his ear. “I’m going to touch every inch of your body, taste your flesh on my tongue.” Dean forces his eyes open. Cas is straddling his lap, fisting his cock while he whispers filthy promises into his ear. “And when you’re writhing, begging for mercy-” his hand speeds up, the other one grabs a handful of Dean’s hair, jerking his head back. “Then, and only then, I’m going to climb on top of you and ride you until we both come screaming.” Dean takes hold of Cas’ ass, urging him on.
“That’s great! When can he have visitors?”
mate and child sleeping soundly. Quietly, Cas draws all of the curtains closed, dimming the room. At a whimper from the sofa, he glances over to find JB stirring in Dean’s grasp. Knowing that Dean hasn’t slept well since Jimmybean stopped sleeping regularly, Cas tries to will the infant back to sleep. As if he senses him, JB’s eyes pop open and he stares at Cas. Cas freezes in place.
Another week passes before the proverbial shit hits the fan. The semester is ending, which means finals, which means that if Dean’s not working, he’s studying. His finals and Sammy’s midterms coincide, and neither of them have done much (any) housework that wasn’t strictly necessary. The laundry is done, the trash is taken out, it’s livable even if it’s not fit for Better Homes and Gardens. Everyone’s clean and fed, but that doesn’t satisfy John. It’s early on another Saturday morning when Dean’s jerked (literally) from his bed and onto the floor.
“This is going to sound really weird, and I promise, I’m not trying to hit on you—”
Michael takes his hands. “Dean, you do too much. When do you take time for yourself?”
"Right. And Cas is the baby. Now let me finish. What I was trying to say, before you opened your big mouth-"
Suddenly aware that he’s been staring at Cas’ mouth for what is probably a creepy amount of time, and that his “loaf around the house” pajama pants leave
One would think he’d birthed Jellybean himself the way he smiles. “Seven pounds, six ounces. Before you ask, I asked Doctor Mills. Ten fingers, ten toes. Dark hair. Reminds me of you, actually.”
“Okie dokie, spit it out.”
He snags a candy bar and tosses it onto the belt with the rest of his crap.
Castiel. Kiddo’s barely two weeks old and he’s mastered your thousand-yard stare already. His eyes are different, though.”
His Saturday lunch shift is busy, as usual. Dean’s pretty sure he’s walked thirty miles so far, and it doesn’t bear thinking about how much weight he’s lifted. He’s not sure what it says about him that he considers his bartending shift relaxing, but he’s looking forward to the downtime tonight. He’s in the midst of pre-busing one of his tables when his manager calls him over. Dean’s anxiety level immediately skyrockets, and he’s grateful for the dampeners he applied on his last break.
“Help! Somebody help me! Jimmy! Help! Where’s my baby? What’s happened to my baby?” Dean can feel hot tears coursing down his face, and the absolute physical and emotional emptiness inside him isn’t comforting in the least. Dimly, he registers the sound of pounding feet over his own ragged breathing.
Dean comes home from work and finds a handmade ornament in his mailbox. “Welcome to the neighborhood,” written in some fancy handwriting across a scroll curled underneath a building that looks just like his duplex. He grins, gently nestles it on top of his mail and duffel, and goes inside.
Dean is able to sit up enough to see that Jimmybean has been given one of Cas’ shirts. “I fucked up, Gabe.”
“Don’t look at me in that tone of voice, Jellybean. You’re the first baby I’ve ever had extended contact with. Cut me some slack.” The newly-christened Jellybean merely blinks, yawns, and shoves his fist into his mouth. After a moment, he dozes again. Gabe reverently touches all of his fingers and toes, and the moment is more poignant because Jimmy will never know his son out of the womb. Gabe sniffles softly.
xxXXXxxXXXxx
“Um, Gabe?” Castiel seems to be staring at something on his shirt. “Is that vomit on your shirt?”
“Mmmmm,” Michael’s head is resting on Dean’s shoulder, his hands now massaging the hips he had been clamping down on moments ago. “Welcome to my home, Dean.”
Around 5:45, because he's also a paranoid bastard, Dean took a break from cooking and grabbed a chilled beer from the fridge. He stuck the new offering in a Ziploc baggie with a note "there's more where this came from," taped both note and baggie to the bottle, then went outside to carefully arrange the day's mail around both items.
The man at the bar laughs. “Yeah. You could call it damp.” He’s still perusing the menu, but Dean notices his fingers tapping on the bartop. A nervous habit, maybe? Why would he be nervous, there’s only the two of them out here. Unless he’s having a reaction similar to the one Dean is having? “What’s good here?”
, is...dead.” He will never, ever get used to the stabbing pain that comes with those words. He can’t imagine how Cassie must be feeling. “I imagine he would be sick.”
Suddenly, it's much quieter than it has been. Sam just assumes that each man went to their separate corners to fume in peace. He shrugs to himself and continues reading.
you. Don’t fucking pout, someone has to be immune to you.”
The second and third times took half that.
! I’ve heard of ‘leaf green’ or ‘grass green’ eyes, but I’d never seen them until he opened his eyes this afternoon. Must have gotten them from Dean.”

xxXXXxxXXXxx
“I meant me. I didn’t know I could hate him.”
A corner of Michael’s mouth turns up. “Dean, my offer isn’t contingent in exchange for your body. I do want to help you out.”
“Dean woke up an hour ago—”
“Marry me, Dean. Let me be JB's alpha dad. Let's be a family." He kisses Dean gently. "You don't have to answer now. I just wanted you to know my intentions. You can say yes tomorrow." Cas kisses him again and crosses to Jimmybean’s crib. He's awake, but sleepily gnawing on his fist in a way that suggests he'd be happy to go back to sleep. "Put in a good word for me, kiddo. Daddy cares about what you think. I just asked him to marry me, which means we'd be a family. I'd be your alpha daddy, and you'd be my son, too. It sounds great to me, how about you?"
“Dean, look at me.” Dean opens his eyes and fastens them on Cas.
“I should think that obvious, Dean. I’m leaving.” He continues packing another suit into the garment bag on the bed, mostly ignoring Dean’s presence.
Gabe can feel his stomach drop.
he thought.
An hour later found them on the sofa, facing each other as they talked. So far, they’d hit all of the major points of jobs (Dean’s a firefighter, Cas is a high school lit teacher.) Both have siblings, and while Dean’s foray into crafting is a recently discovered hobby, Cas has been creating since he was a kid.
Heaven help him if Cas ever smiles at him.
I can’t do this.
“You’re family, Dean. Both of you. I don’t understand it yet, and I don’t care. I’m here for you. Whenever and whatever you need.”
“They’re so
And rings.
“I can’t imagine how bad this is for you, Castiel.”
We ARE sure. Stress is a bastard. That’s all!
Dinner preparations are underway as Dean detours through the kitchen for a quick snack. He’d slept through lunch and woke up ravenous. The cook hands him a tray with snacks and a pitcher of juice, and sends him to Cas’ office.
The nirvana of a long, hot shower is calling to him as he slowly backs away from JB and Castiel. “Thanks, Cas. Really. You have no idea how much I appreciate this.”
, Gabe. He needs to be held. We don’t have enough staff right now to, well, cuddle an infant for an extended period. He needs to be close to Dean and his family so that he can form healthy familial bonds. In this case, as your brother’s twin, Castiel would be the ideal candidate, but—”
Castiel heaves a massive sigh over the speaker. “Boxing up Jimmy’s stuff is hard, Gabe. I knew it was going to be difficult, I just didn’t expect to spend the majority of my time bawling my eyes out.”
Dean coughs out a laugh. “If that’s the welcome I’m gonna get every time I walk in the door, I might have to leave a lot.”
“Whatever, Gabriel. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Right now, there’s a hot shower and a cold beer calling me. Send me more pictures tomorrow.”
Couple of things before we get into this chapter.
He dumps the mail back into the box and tears open the baggie.
Castiel squints at the screen, trying to discern Jellybean’s eye color from the photo he’s got pulled up. “Different?”
“Mr. Gabriel Novak?”
nice mental scenario starring his hot neighbor sprawled in a desk chair, pants open, shirt pushed up under his armpits, biting on his own tie as he stared down at Dean as he swallowed around Cas' cock. So if
Cas and Sam spend the weekend in Denver, taking a day tour through the Rocky Mountain National Park, trying out a zip-line, and ending their mini vacation with a haunted pub tour. Dean spends Saturday sulking and Sunday in his underwear catching up on his Netflix queue. On the nightstand, his phone pings.
Well, it’s a little late for that, asshat.
Dean’s body is sandwiched between the front door and Michael’s unyielding heat. He can feel the ridge of his cock riding his ass, and he moans. It’s been awhile. “Sorry, Alpha,” Dean pants against the door. “I hurried.”
"Maybe he'll sell it to me next time." Dean dries his hands and leaves the kitchen, Sam staring at him like he just can't believe what a dumbass his big brother can be.
“Smells delicious in here,” he says, staring into Dean’s eyes.
“You’ll need this.”
Cas smirks. “Oh, you have
“Hello, Dean.”
Why did he have to think of his frankly gorgeous neighbor in the same sentence as satisfaction? This was going to make his evening plans of grading essays difficult.
Cas opens his mailbox the next evening. Mixed in with the usual junk mail and various periodicals (that
Twenty minutes later finds Dean and JB sacked out on the sofa in the living room when Cas walks in, following the scent of exhausted omega and cranky baby. It warms his heart to see his—
Several deep breaths later, Cas is thrilled by the roar of the engine. He strokes the steering wheel. “Dean takes very good care of you. We’ll have to make sure to keep that up while he’s resting. He flips on the radio—no CD player or AC jack, how quaint—and smiles at the power ballad pouring from the speakers. He rolls down the window, signals, and pulls away singing with the radio about the glory of love.
Jimmybean gurgles at him. "I think he likes the idea," Cas says. "I'll see you in the morning, Dean." He gently closes the door behind himself.
Definitely worth it for the results, though. This time, he'd modge-podged two beer bottles, tilted towards each other in a toast. It had taken several (
“Leaving? What’s wrong? What’s going on?” Dean’s confused. He thought they had a good thing going. Neither of them was in love, but he was pretty sure they were content, at least.
"Gabe's the... don't tell me—" Dean clicks his fingers a couple times. "He's your older brother, right?"
“Gonna come, Omega. Gonna fill you up until it runs out of you.” He reaches around and takes Dean’s cock in hand, letting the force of his thrusts push it through his fist.
“Two more years and Sammy will be out of high school. I’ll have my degree, and then we’re putting as many miles between us and Dad as physically possible.” He tries to turn away, but Michael is still holding on to his hands.
“Try them? They’re not for me, why do I need to try them?” Castiel can’t tell if Dean’s trying to be a dick, or if he’s honestly curious.
“No! I mean. Yes! Yes, this is totally okay, Cas.” And Dean sees that he was right about Cas’ smile. He’s sunk. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do to keep that smile trained on him.
---------------
Dean had been teetering on the precipice of love for a while, and the idea of Cas taking care of little Jimmybean has pushed him right over the romantic edge. Oddly enough, Dean isn’t as terrified as he'd expected to be by falling in love. It just seemed right.
He floated on that feeling the whole bus ride home, even through the short, snowy walk from the corner stop to his house. As he climbed his porch steps, his thoughts turned to his next crafting project. He’d heard Dean in the shower last night. How couldn’t he, when they’re sharing a wall? And since he’d never heard him in the weeks before, he was inclined to believe that Dean had been loud
“He’s healthy.” Gabe practically
Dean’s smile widens. “You’re Table Five, huh? Pam told me about you. Enjoy your phone call?”
Dean is a man that knows how to relax.
🍹🍔😘😇🕶🌊🌈🌞
Cas’ hands are busy pulling Dean’s jeans and boxers down just far enough to free his cock. Still maintaining eye contact (
“Speakin’.”
“My dear, no one deserves us. That’s what makes us family. Not genetics.”
Dean’s hands latch onto Cas’ hips, driving his own up against the body moving above him. Cas releases his lip to trail his mouth down his throat, pulling aside the neck of his t-shirt to lave his tongue across his clavicle. With a moan of his own, Cas fastens his mouth onto Dean’s neck and rolls his hips.
The lightweight knit blanket goes over Dean, of course. Some of Dean’s clothes in the drawers so he can go home in actual pants. A pile of onesies (he
“I can’t promise to fuck you against the door every day, but there are a lot of horizontal surfaces in this apartment.”
“Hmmm?”
Dean grimaces. "It's my fault, Gabe. I need your help. I’ll explain everything, just come and get us. Please." He tells Gabe the name of the park and settles in to wait. He's sick twice more before Gabe and Balth reach them.
He doesn't know where he's going, he's just trying to get away. He hopes against hope that Cas doesn't come after him. He won't be able to deny him, or himself, what they both want. All Dean's ever wanted is a family of his own. He was going to have it with Jimmy and Jimmybean, until the crash. Now, he's had the closest thing to family that he's had since his mother died. He should have left once he was healed. He shouldn't have let himself get attached, and he shouldn't have let himself fall in love with Cas. Dean only realizes that he's crying when he can't see through the tears. His body is in knots and JB is wailing. The stink of upset, anxious omega fills Baby's interior, and Dean has to pull over.
“He’s wearing the hat you made him,” Gabe says. When he gets no response, he pauses eating long enough to look at Castiel, expecting the worst. All he sees, however, is Castiel staring at what Gabe assumes is Jellybean’s picture. When Jimmy had mentioned the baby, Castiel had knit a tiny yellow and black striped hat, complete with antennae and a pair of tiny wings. It’s sickeningly adorable, and Gabe thought it would be a perfect way to introduce Castiel’s scent to the newborn. He also thought Castiel might feel better seeing their nephew in something he had made with his own hands.
Cas sticks his mail under his arm and takes Dean’s hand. He absolutely does
With a sigh, he opens his textbook. Midterms are quickly approaching, and he doesn’t want to risk dropping his GPA. He’s careful to keep it comfortably above the minimum required to keep his scholarships, but “comfortable” is the key word there. He doesn’t want to be stressing out over a few tenths of a percentage point at the end of the semester. He scrubs a hand over his face and through his hair. Tomorrow is Saturday, and he has a double at the restaurant. He always takes the weekend shifts because he can get the most hours on those days. He’ll be waiting tables during lunch and tending bar in the evening. In between, he’ll work on his paper and get some errands on his list checked off.
“Dean.” That one word had Dean stupidly stepping further into the wooded area. He heard movement behind him and he whirled to see…. It wasn’t Cas. His heart fell in disappointment and raced with adrenaline at the same time. He was in danger. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up as he laid eyes on her. The woman had scraggly brown hair, hanging below her shoulders. It hung heavily, greasy and unwashed. Her eyes were deep-sunken and full of a rage he could relate to. Her face appeared pinched as if she hadn’t had a good meal in weeks.....Her mouth stretched wide, flashing rows and rows of teeth, a smile that made Dean step back.
Castiel looked between them, his eyes shining with feeling. “Jack…Dean…I am so sorry….I feel like I abandoned you all. Sam too. Jack, I hope you can understand why I had to leave so suddenly. It wasn’t by choice.”
“Is that the truth?” Dean growled out as he crossed his arms over his red t-shirt.
Dean grinned. Oh, he was going to enjoy this.  He cleared his throat importantly, drawing their attention to him. “Nah, it’s true. He gripped me tight and raised me from perdition.”
They stared, Dean’s chest rising more quickly than he would like for a moment, then Dean nodded succinctly and dropped his hands, tucking them shyly into his pockets. “Good...good. Glad we understand each other.”
“Mom, That is more than enough.” Dean finally stood and crossed his arms over his chest. “You don’t talk to Jody that way.”
“You don’t have to Dean…” Castiel said softly as he sensed his hesitation.
“Cas…” Dean pleaded with his tone as his fingers dug deep into the mattress.
“He said he had to be brief. I think other Angels can hear this type of communication, or maybe other Angels were nearby,” Jack said as his smile faltered.
“Help by fucking me…You’re so selfless,” Cas said with a deep chuckle.
Holding the cardboard box awkwardly with both hands, Cas frowned. “Wha…no? She didn’t…Did I need to get it for something?”
Through gritted teeth, Jack spoke. “Angel…Radio…Somethings…wrong. It’s chaos…a mass of screaming and static. I can’t make out a coherent thought.” Dean and Sam both lowered their weapons as the perceived threat was proven to not be in the room. It took them all a moment to let the words sink in before two sets of eyes found Dean’s. He set his pistol on the nightstand and he instinctively looked Heavenward, dropping his gun back onto the comforter as he pushed up off the floor.
Chuck smiled and went to sit next to Castiel on the couch. “Castiel, I created you but I afraid I cannot take credit for who you have become. You are humble, full of contrition, and always striving to be better than you were. You have fallen down and instead of giving up, you got up and tried harder. You have sacrificed so much for the greater good, and you are still sacrificing. You have given up so much…more than you admit to anyone. But I can see you, Castiel, and no matter what you have done, those things have made you who you are….and I am proud of who you have become. You should be too.”
“Would you
Dean grumbled as he typed in another text and waved his credit card at Cas, who took it quickly. “My friend also wanted the apple pie.”
of those. I’ll leave it up to you to pick, blue eyes.” The woman grinned, a playful inviting smile that Cas couldn’t help but return. Dean, however, stiffened at his side and he glanced at him.
With Angels back in the picture, the WInchesters find themselves with little to do. Meanwhile, Cas waits for Naomi's next inevitable move.
“I didn’t text you to come baby me,” Dean grumbled as he tried to stand. “I’m fine.”
Dead added quickly, “and Serafina with Adam.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t know,” Cas’ face fell, and Dean could see his own nsecurity reflected back in his eyes. He took his hands and cupped his face in his own.
-----------------------------
He quietly padded to the bathroom in the other side of the suite, his feet making little sound on the light tan carpet. Cas rolled out of the bed gracefully and pulled off the bed sheets. He could have mojo’d them clean perhaps but he hated wasting grace on such small things. After being without his grace or with low grace for so many years, he’d learned to not use it needlessly. He put them in a heap at the floor of the closet and grabbed up a new set from the dresser he’d spied it earlier when unpacking. He worked to make the bed as he heard the shower come on in the other room. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath as an overwhelming urge to slip into the shower with him came over him. He let a breath out and opened his eyes and forced himself to continue his task, knowing Dean needed recovery time and food. Just as he was pulling the comforter back into place and tossing the pillows back on the bed, his own phone, discarded on his nightstand, began to ring. He picked it up and shook his head at the unknown number, but he hesitated and hit the green phone button to answer. As he held it up to his ear, Dean appeared, smiling and with a towel wrapped around his waist, not yet damp from the shower...He froze as he saw the look on Cas’ face and the one finger held up toward him. Dean studied his face, which had become hard and his eyes tight. As Castiel hung up without saying a word, he cocked his own head in confusion.
--------------
Castiel smiled, letting his teeth flash, and Dean almost gasped by the sheer beauty of an Angel smiling at him. “I hear you, Dean.” He looked Heavenward and then back at Dean. “I would like to try something…. I hope I have time.” He leaned forward and closed his eyes, letting his instincts find Dean’s lips. It was something he’d wanted to do for so, so very long. The kiss was nervous, soft, and Dean tasted of good whiskey. He pulled away when he heard Mary and Bobby step foot into the woods.
“Picked it up from a thrift shop in Phoenix. It’s vintage, just like you old man,” She grinned. “Try it on.”
“I know, Dean. I feel it too,” Castiel panted out, his voice having lost some of its otherworldly growl. “It’s your soul and my grace. I believe they recognize one another,” Cas’ chest was rising and falling more quickly than Dean had ever seen and he was frozen, afraid to thrust deeper, fearing this fog of sheer bliss was something insidious. Cas continued, his eyes wide and unfocused. He was not unaffected by whatever was happening. “I…I carried your soul out of Hell inside of me. It’s...I believe we’re safe. Please,” Cas arched his back and Dean groaned out as the movement made him sink more deeply into his warmth. At this point, there was probably no going back if a cadre of demons broke down the damn door. Dean felt as if he’d licked a battery, hell maybe ten batteries. He didn’t understand it but there would be time for words later. He trusted Cas and he’d assured them they were safe. That would have to be good enough. Dean slid out slowly, gently then drove in, ripping a groan from Cas that sent his own head spinning.
“It’s a part of me I am more than willing to give up to be with you,” Castiel countered as he put a hand to Dean’s face, running a thumb along the new stubble.
“No..no..Chuck, not the….the other thing…” Chuck said with a dismissing wave of his hand. “And please, no grand gestures or bowing or any of that stuff. It makes me uncomfortable.”
was. The only one didn’t just see a killer, a drunk, a hunter, his father's protege, or a broken man. He saw
“Damn it…” Dean growled out as he pushed out of the chair and tapped on the door. “Cas? Don’t do anything stupid…” He jumped back as he felt something hard plunk against the wood door. “Shit. Cas, just…you’re mad. I get it. I’m an idiot.” There was silence in the room as Dean talked. “Okay, I’ll take your silence as agreeance. I’m sorry…I just…” Dean looked behind him at his eavesdropping family and he groaned. “Don’t make me do this in front of them, Cas…”
Castiel knew this was going to complicate matters, but he would do almost anything to make the shrieking sensation of Angel Radio in his head stop. Heaven had been broadcasting in his head for weeks, demanding he return to Heaven to speak to Naomi. He was no fool. He’d go, but Heaven wasn’t on the game plan. He and Naomi had agreed to speak at a park near the Heaven portal. She’d told him to come alone…but sometimes concessions must be made.
“I think I offended your friend there. It really was just a joke,” the woman added and Cas glanced over to Dean again.
Aberia cocked her head to the side now and her forehead scrunched in confusion. “Why are you not celebrating? You’re free of her.”
“Love you too,” Dean said, his voice shaking only slightly. The intimacy made him shudder and he buried his face in Cas’ shoulder, sighing as Cas ran his hand along his spine. He rolled to the side, bringing him with him as he found his lips. Dean lazily ran his hand along the length of him, smiling as he felt him shudder under his fingertips again. He softly parted Cas’ lips with his, running his tongue along his lower lip, coaxing Cas’ tongue to play with his own. It was definitely different than it was earlier. Cas was softer, more pliable in his hands. His body responded with more earnestness and he felt warmer under his touch. These were not bad things, only observations as he and Cas lazily made out, hands softly roaming across any bare skin they could reach, under shirts, dipping into waist bands. The pace was unhurried, simply enjoying the closeness now. Dean found Castiel to be much more responsive to his touches, which he took full advantage of as he once again nipped Cas’ earlobe between his teeth, making Cas’ groan loudly into his mouth.
enough candles,” Cas spoke aloud as he looked around at the gathered hunters.
“I’d disagree but you’re not wrong, but I’ll be fine,” Castiel said with assurance as he locked eyes with Dean as best he could. Though he was injured, his eyes were strong and filled with determination.
?” Dean said warily as he pushed himself to sit with his palms on the comforter.
Pamela laughed at Dean’s incredulous expression and shrugged her shoulders. “I’m dead, not blind, Dean. Well, not anymore,” Then she winked at Cas.
Sam interrupted, coming to stand near them by the bed. “Cas  is one of the good guys, mom, and-“
Jody nodded knowingly, knowing all too well what he meant. "Well, for what it’s worth from a mom, I’m proud of you. I know this had to be extremely difficult for you, but you both handled it well, and Mary will come around. Even moms are wrong...once in a while.”
“And yet we get babysitting duty….” Aberia groaned.
“He the jealous type, huh?” Her eyebrow was raised as she followed Dean outside with her eyes.
Cas shivered under Dean’s touch, his eyes closed in happiness now. A small frown crossed his face though and he slowly opened his eyes again, wariness present. “Now would probably be the best time to show you the other one….” He slid his shirt off his arms, his body now naked from the torso up. Dean looked confusedly at his chest, only seeing the mark at his side. Castiel turned to reveal his back, wincing as he heard Dean suck in a shocked breath.
“Hmmm. Should have known after the pizza man incident you’d be looking into that more,” Dean said with a humored smirk as he ran his hand down Cas’ back. “I can show you my collection some time if you’d like. We could watch it together…”
“I’m simply trying to understand you. You’re appeal. To Castiel. I don’t understand.”
“I don’t know…” Cas answered honestly, with trepidation of his own.
“Yeah, thanks…” Dean said as she began undoing his chains. “Who are you?”
“That you do, Dean Winchester,” came the familiar gruff voice Dean had been longing to hear. He spun on the stool and saw him, his figure surrounded with the bright light from outside and he swallowed nervously as he stood on trembling legs.
“If Handriel has something to say, she has my permission to say it,” Castiel said as he raised an eyebrow calmly but the other Angels in the room took a step back, sensing the false calm by the set of his wings and the timbre of his voice. The growl all but made the room itself tremble. No one would ever know he agreed with Handriel...in his own way. She saw the humans as weak, and in that she was wrong. However, he was sure Dean at least would be targeted quickly. His mind raced with every possible way this day could go wrong, even as he stood defending his family being here...even while he wanted them nowhere near the battle when it began. Emotions were a complicated matter.
“Okay, great, yeah. That’s…okay, let’s get the rest of the list and head out.” Dean stumbled in his hurry to turn around and Cas remained more puzzled. Dean’s flustered mood seemed to die down by the time they were loading the groceries into the trunk, placing the paper sacks over the weapons like it was normal to have machetes and Enochian brass knuckles riding alongside turkey hot dogs and sodas. Dean even seemed in a much better mood on their way to the bakery after they’d stopped for gas. He watched as Dean grabbed up a cassette tape and read the handwritten label before popping it in. They didn’t talk as Dean pulled out and drove toward the bakery, but Dean drummed his hands on the wheel and jiggled his knee to the music, which was normal for him. However, Cas looked at him with further confusion when Dean gave a snorty laugh through his nose as a song came on. “Zeppelin,” Dean murmured as he glanced at Cas.
“I’ll get there. I’ll have to actually do training with you and Sam when we get back to maintain my body and reflexes,” Castiel said with the first hint of sulking in his voice. Dean noticed.
