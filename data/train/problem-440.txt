"Did the worker specify why she was being placed in foster care?"
"I'm glad that your friend appreciated that bee," Mr. Aherne told John.  "I told Moira he was a bit too old for a toy, but she looked at me and said 'His got taken away when he was little and he didn't do anything wrong,' and after that I was putty in her hands."
When he woke up the next morning, it was appropriately raining.  Not just raining, but pouring, with bursts of thunder and lightning. "Figures," he said to himself before shaking Sherlock awake.  "Come on, up.  You should take a shower and dress before Lou and Susan get here."
John fixed on the only part of the message he could possibly understand.  “And ‘on call’ is a doctor’s term.  Someone on call is in house at a hospital and deals with patient problems overnight.”
"Maybe," Mrs. Hudson countered.  "Lots of people think they'd do differently if there was one thing changed about the situation but most of them wouldn't."  John must have had a stricken expression on his face, because she went on to add "Not that she would have done nothing no matter what, but people don't want to get involved."
"Tell me about what happened."
"Go ahead," John told him.  He put down the umbrella and Susan followed suit.
"I'm not sure exactly.  I was in a flat.  On a bed."
“Come on.  Lestrade just rang me.  Someone’s tried to break into the Aherne’s flat.”
"I think so, yeah."  Her shoulders sagged with visible relief.  She looked at her brother.
"They must not live in London, then."  John couldn't imagine a homeless family would have the money to be able to drive in London.
All three of the Aherne children were in there.  Dierdre was off in a corner by herself, sitting amongst a herd of My Little Ponies.  Moira and Kieran were spread out over half the floor, with action figures of what appeared to be half the casts of both Star Wars and Doctor Who all around them.  Moira was making the Millennium Falcon circle above them.  She had her back turned to Sherlock and didn't turn around until he said, "Moira?" quietly.
John couldn't even think of a coherent response, so he went with his instinct.  "I'm so sorry," he gasped out.  "It's just all too much.  Whenever you talk about her your voice just changes."
At that moment Lou and Susan both arrived.  "Good to see both of you," Lou said in his typical cheerful tone.  John nodded in their general direction.  Sherlock said nothing.
Before the conversation could go on, Rodney entered the room.  He had such a hangdog look that Eli said "Bad week?" as soon as he stepped through the door.
"Oh yes, you were on the potential witness list," Lou said pleasantly.
The wine turned out to be a very good idea, as Sherlock didn't appear to be interested in carrying on a conversation.  Any time John tried to engage him in some line of discussion he would reply in monosyllables or silence.  When John finally gave up Sherlock silently picked at his veal parmesan and sipped at what would turn out to be several glasses of wine.  This unnerved John more than he thought possible, so he ate his fettuccini alfredo as fast as he could just so they could get back home.
"What?"  Lou leaned towards the judge's stand.  He looked very tired all of a sudden and John suddenly realized the impact the trial had on him.
"No, I didn't.  Did you want to play the saxophone?"  He tilted his head in a curious look.
"And that was it?"
"Yes," Sherlock firmly replied.  John guessed that the people he intended to ring began and ended with "Mycroft."
"I have to do something," Sherlock replied, looking at the floor.
"Well, She... what did She say?" Phillip sounded terrified.
"You're in the thick of it," Peter said. "I can remember having the exact same conversation."
"No, but considering he claims to be Sherlock Holmes, we're probably not going to get much out of him."
"Four or five years, I think."
"Good afternoon, Dr. Sawyer."  Susan's tone held great respect.
"What do you want me for, then?"  Her whole face crinkled in confusion.
John nodded. "The combination of all those hurt kids and the fact it's now Sherlock's case is hard to deal with. Even he was angry about it, and he never gets angry at crime unless he can't figure out who did it and why."
“You're going to hell for this,” John blurted out.  “You're going to pay.”
"When it's all that's on your mind, yes it would."
"Good afternoon."
"Of course.  Phillip wanted friends.  He wanted to be loved.  Who would give that to him but Her?"
“No, like sex attacks.” Phillip looked again like he wanted to evaporate on the spot.  “She said She knew that because of my touching Her when we met first even though She hadn’t given me permission.”
"Of course!  Won't it be fun?"
"What could they possibly say about me?" Mr. Aherne said bewilderedly.  "That I'm negligent for letting her walk the dog alone?"  John wanted to laugh at his naivety; he could think of many things the solicitors might deem suspect.
"All right," he simply said.
"What sort of things did you discuss?"
Moira turned to him in surprise, obviously not expecting him to speak.  "The afternoon of the day I went to hospital.  I took Rory for a walk and She was in the park.  I almost always saw Her there first.  The other times She'd come in my room."
"No.  Why?"
"Are you going back?"  He looked frenzied; his hair was tousled and his eyes were wild.
"Which patient was the one that upset you so badly? And those are from a cow, not a person, so don't ask Molly why she let me have someone's internal organs. Not that it should be a problem in the first place; if someone's organs were taken out that means they were either autopsied or were an organ donor and even if neither were true they don't need them any more anyway." Sherlock didn't even look up from what he was doing as he said this, and for some reason it felt so oddly comforting that John almost laughed.
"What was his name?"
"Sometimes she would come back with no pants on, or asleep in the middle of the afternoon.  She also called the place she was taken 'the fucking room' and once she even asked me if I'd fuck her.  Where does a child learn that?  I didn't even have a TV license then," Mrs. Bena shot back.
“No leads there, then.”
"Sometimes."  Sherlock visibly drew back, knuckles going white from clutching Hamish.
"Why don't we go out?" Sherlock said.
As she walked back to the bench, Judge Foster slammed down his gavel.  "The time is now six in the evening and the court is dismissed for the day.  We shall begin session tomorrow at nine AM."
"And you've been married for a year and a half?"
"But you shared custody of her."
Clark obviously got the message and switched subjects.  "Are a great deal of your teenage patients sexually active?"
"Did you just describe all of them?"
"Sometimes," Phillip whispered.  "I shouldn't have given you that address," he continued a second later like that was a perfectly natural segue in conversation.  "I was at Her flat that evening and She was sleeping.  Usually She's holding me so tight I can't move but this time She'd let go with one arm."
"Yes."
John finally breaks down.
"But you knew you were hurting those children, right?"
"I'm going back home," he said.  He wanted answers to where Sherlock kept disappearing to, and waiting until the end of the day seemed much too long.  He strode towards the front door, down the steps, and out to the pavement, where he hailed a cab back.
"When did you hear about this?"
"So you miss her."
"Are you close to your dad?"  Clark obviously knew that line of questioning was going to hurt their case; he switched the subject without a second thought.
Sherlock seemed to pale even more.  "I didn't know how to hug.  I couldn't tell where the arms went.  She said She'd teach me that.  So we'd hug every day.  Sitting down sometimes.  And She kept teaching me how to kiss.  Then one day She said it was hot since it was the summer.  So She asked me if it was okay if She took off Her clothes.  I said yes and She did.  Then She asked me if I was hot and I was.  She said it was okay if I took off my clothes because She was a doctor and I didn't have anything She hadn't seen before.  So I took off everything but my pants."
"'Cause She paid Mummy lots of money."  She didn't seem particularly distressed by this, probably because she was too young to realize what that meant.
"Is the woman you saw kissing your sister in court today?"
It turned out that he didn't have to say anything at all, as Sherlock was still sequestered in his room and hadn't left since they had arrived back home. He set out with a vague feeling of unease. While John had a lot of questions, he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answers to many of them. However, he had little time to be lost in thought, as a car pulled up next to him and the window rolled down. "John," said Mycroft. "Lovely to see you. You signed your last message with 'JH'; have you eloped with my brother?"
"No," Phillip whispered.  "It was just like the other times and She had Her hand down my pants.  She had the same blouse on, the flowered one, and it was unbuttoned, mostly.  My head was against Her breasts and this time She said something about it."
"If you're all so stuck why don't you just –" The sentence was halfway out of John's mouth before he even realized he was saying it.
"I'm a caterer. I currently work out of my flat. It's with a larger company, but I'm responsible for a lot of their smaller work, mostly in London."
From Lou's sigh, it was clear he knew very well what the juror intended to say. "He's going to say that he would have voted to acquit."
"Did you say anything else to them?"
"No."
"Tell us what you now know you saw first."
Lou's voice broke him out of his thoughts.  "What did she say after that?"
Once Lestrade had left the interview room, Mr. Ogbeide, Sherlock, and John arranged themselves in the remaining chairs.  Sherlock stopped to push the record button on the tape recorder before speaking again.  “As you know, Mr. Ogbeide, we're investigating a series of cases of child abuse, and your daughter has been mentioned as a potential victim.”  He nodded, and Sherlock continued.  “You are on the record as having brought your daughter to the A&E at Bart's.  Can you explain why you did this?”
"Not the same thing at all.  In that case I had no evidence there was a crime in the first place.  In the previous one there were reported statements from the victim to another person.  While you can't prosecute anyone on that, the involvement of the third party would add credibility to the claim of a crime."
It dawned on John what he meant. "That I love you? Yes. Both romantically and as a friend," he added, to prevent what he was sure was the next question. "That's the reason I hate to see you like this. You shouldn't have to get high to drive her out of your brain when it's me. And I'd like to try to help you with that. That's why I want to go to this group." Not wanting to push the issue further, John changed the subject. "How long have you been using again?"
"Well, we'll be here together all day, so we'll need lots to do!"
"How old were you then?"
"It doesn't look much like the bees you see outside, does it?"
"Not that much.  Not like usual, I mean, since Rory was there.  I thought it would be okay because She said She just wanted to touch me.  At first that was all She did but after a bit She started to use Her fingers."
Sherlock woke up a few hours later, just when John was about to head off to bed, and spoke for the first time that day. "What should I wear tomorrow?" he asked, like a small child.
"She said not to."
"So you didn't mention his occupation when you told the police about this?"  Harvey glared at him.
John paused in mid-sip, surprised he'd brought the subject up on his own.  "Yes," he finally replied.
"At work. I mean, where they worked."
“What do you mean by ‘get it all out?’  Is that something she said to you before?” Lou asked.
Tammy caught something in his voice and said, "But it's your friend too, isn't it? You sound like it's something you're going through every day, like me."
"But what's -"
"I just hope you didn't wake Sherlock up."
"Was that all you did there?" Susan gently asked.
"Well, your right arm was recently broken. You have no cast because it was removed, but the pale skin and the obvious difference in size between the two indicates until recently it was in a cast. The muscles have weakened, making it smaller than your left arm. If you were right-handed the difference would not be as pronounced, as you would be trying to build up the strength in the arm as soon as possible." He smiled at Phillip, and it looked sincere, not faked.
"Yes," Victor said, sitting up straighter.
"Even if it's stupid I'd still like to know."
"I know you're taking this very personally, but that just means you have to do this right.  You want to connect the dots so K is in jail for a long time."
"Sherlock's bee. Why did it get taken away from him?" He had no idea why he said that, of all things, but it worked. Mycroft gave a heavy sigh.
"He wanted all of her records here.  I only knew her for a little while; she left here five years ago, but she never..."  Sarah shut her eyes for a second, like she was thinking of something.  "Actually.  Now that I think about it, it's not the case.  You know she worked in the pediatric clinic here, usually in the evening.  One thing she always insisted on was that she examine children without their parents in the room at the same time.  She said it was because parents so often get hysterical over minor things."
"That would be correct," Lestrade said as they stepped into the flat.  "The material is of a sensitive nature so you may want us to go through them in a less public spot."
"No."
John hadn't expected to be asked that question.  "No."
"You say that you felt dizzy after drinking it?"
Sherlock was the one who broke the long silence. "You're a very brave girl, Moira. Thank you for telling me all this."
John intended to say "I know you don't," but to his surprise he found himself saying "Where do you keep vanishing to?"
"Once you're done talking to me we should be heading back anyway.  I hope this will be brief."  Sherlock gestured for John to exit, and he did so, shutting the door behind them.
"That won't be needed," Sherlock responded, still looking uncomfortable.
"No," the other three said in unison.
"When was the next time you saw the doctor?" Lou asked.
"I'm sure you were."
“But if I can’t it’ll never work!” Sherlock howled in despair.
"You've remembered an awful lot of conversations today."
"Did the same things happen there?"
"K's at the Yard?" he made himself ask.
Mr. Ogbeide reached for his wallet and pulled it out of his pocket. He opened it and revealed a picture of a mocha-skinned small girl, about six years old.  Her dark brown hair was pulled into multiple small braids and she wore some sort of school uniform.  Her smile revealed a missing front tooth.  “That's Jennifer.  When this was taken she'd been with me for a year after being in care and her mother being arrested.”
"Did you both want Dr. Martin in an intimate way?"  When Sherlock merely stared silently at her, Harvey added: "You both say you spent a significant amount of time with her."
He shook his head.  "No.  Thinking about music or what I want to draw."
"Sometimes I had to lie down on the table by myself and She'd kiss me all over."
"Good to know you're back amongst the living," John said as he sat down and took a sip of tea.
"He must be anxious."  If John felt anxious even though he was only going to be an observer, he couldn't imagine how Phillip felt.
"Let's just go back to my place," John said, and headed out the door.  Martin, noting that he hadn't said "home," followed.
He wrote a quick response: "I would also like to see you, hopefully more than once. Any time that is good for your father and you will work. They are pleased because you are a talented flute player. A present on my birthday is not needed. Sherlock." When he was done he tried to think of anything else that needed to be done, but there was nothing, and the rest of the day stretched forward without relief. John could usually provide some amusement, but who knew when he would be back. Molly was currently out of the country and wouldn't be able to give him any body parts for at least a week. At least John wasn't going to make him eat. Even at the thought of food he gagged slightly.
On that disturbing note, Judge Foster broke in with, "The court will adjourn for one hour."  Phillip was led away by an usher and the rest of the courtroom filed out the door.
"You can't say that now," Sherlock replied.
"Do you think it might be easier if you meet with him with the prosecution there?  They could at least make sure the conversation didn't get too descriptive."  John couldn't be sure they'd even be open to that, but he knew in his gut that it would be better if Phillip and Sherlock were able to talk.
"There were ones you didn't?" Clark glared at Sarah.
"Did you ever ask Her if you could choose what the two of you did?" Harvey used the capital letters, but not out of fear; she said it in a mocking tone, like Phillip couldn't possibly be afraid of K.
"I assumed it wasn't going to rain." He hung up his jacket and went into the kitchen to see what he could make for dinner.
“Imagine how he must have felt, then,” John commented as he flopped on the sofa.  A few minutes later his mobile rang.
Mr. Aherne took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.  After a long period of silence he told the court the same story he had told Lestrade last February.  When he finished it he added: "I tried to think of a person that could have done it and I couldn't think of one."
"How old was he when it started?
"The eleven year old should know the truth, I think," Mari commented. "If your wife's okay with telling them that. The others are really too young. Tell them she's sad because of some things she's remembering."
"I didn't say anything."  Moira sounded close to tears.
"Did they ever say anything about what Jennifer had said?"
“What would you say to him when he revealed he was sexually active?”
"Hugless... Douglas?"  Sherlock repeated.  He wondered if this was a bit of popular culture that had slipped him by, something that didn't exist in his universe, or something else entirely.
"Since I was born.  Me mum gave him to me.  He was hers first."
"Hello.  Are you going to the trial tomorrow?"  John knew that Graham and Christine were going to be testifying that day.  Sherlock looked over at him as soon as he heard the word "trial," but didn't say anything.
"Who's she?"
"Yeah," Phillip said, voice steady.
"This is the last picture I have of Phillip," Mr. Rodgers said as he put a photograph on the table.  It showed a black-haired boy barely out of toddlerhood examining a music stand.  He smiled in the photo, something John hadn't seen Phillip do in real life.  "I play for an orchestra and he always loved to come to work with me."
The walk seemed twice as long as it normally would be.  Sherlock didn't seem like he was looking forward to the meal, but he didn't seem to be concerned about it.  He seemed more resigned.
"Are you going back to sleep?" John asked as he got out of bed,
I'm sorry for being so late in posting this. I have five writing projects I'm working on now, so updates might be a little slow.
This line is the lynchpin of the story. And he's right.  Even Mycroft assumed.
“Yes,” Phillip whispered.
John was decidedly glad when he left for the clinic Monday morning. When he woke up and came downstairs he found that Sherlock had left his room, but was sitting sideways in a chair again, Lestrade's file in his lap. He didn't respond to John's tentative, "Morning," and seemed not to notice that he was there. It was a relief to leave and descend into the hustle and bustle of the city, and even more of a relief when he arrived at work and was greeted with a few welcome remarks of, "Hello," or "Good morning". Even though his patients that morning had a tedious repetition of symptoms (London appeared to be in the midst of a flu epidemic) it was still enough to distract his mind.
"Hopefully you can go home in a few days." It was clear that the girl was feeling more at ease in his presence, but he didn't feel the time was right to bring up the issue of why she was in the hospital. "Is Rory named after Amy's husband on Doctor Who?"
"A while.  It was winter when I started there and spring when they let Daddy take me home."
"It's fine," Sherlock said as he stood up. "I think I've asked enough questions for one day."
"I've met her," John said.  He wondered why Lou didn't use her name.
"That's the girl," he confirmed.
John assumed at this point Sherlock had shut off the tape, as he heard nothing but static. Lestrade still looked rattled by what he had heard on the tape. "You two can head back home. Sherlock, you said something about giving Phillip your number?"
Harvey looked back towards Clark and the dock, then back to the stand.  "No further questions," she finally sighed.
He typed it in.  "Still nothing." John looked down at the drive again.  "Wait.  Since there's eight digits there counting the dots, maybe it's an eight digit code?"
"Your brother.  You care about what he thinks?"
"The woman said something but I don't remember what it was.  She took her clothes off then.  I really tried to get away then, because I'd never seen a naked woman before and it didn't seem right, but it was too much effort.  I felt like everything weighed a hundred pounds."  For the first time, Sagnik hesitated.  Even though he had shown far more confidence than any of the other victims, he obviously didn't want to describe his own assault.  "Then she lay down on the bed next to me and started to touch me."
"Do you know why they wouldn't let you live with your father?"
"Born with what?" John asked.  He couldn't figure out what Phillip was trying to say.
"You both had wanted the affection of a friend or parent, correct?"
Unlike the previous days, Lou and Susan appeared in the courtroom before even the reporters.  They ushered a man, woman, and three children to a space near the back, on the other side from the dock.  The family sat down, and Lou and Susan left.  John could see they all looked anxious, with the exception of the baby on his mother's lap.  One of the girls, the older-looking of the two, said something to her father, who then put his arm around her.  Neither the buffalo nor the reporters that came in appeared to pay them any notice.
"And no one saved him."  John turned to Dr. Dodson.  He didn't speak very often, at least from the two meetings he'd been to, which surprised John.  He had thought that the psychiatrist would lead all the discussions.
The stilted formality of the question made alarm bells go off in John's head, but he couldn't figure out why.  "Angelo's is fine," he hastily replied before leaving the room.
"They apparently went to the courthouse on the day of the plea. Everyone there thought it was sad she seemed convinced she'd be convicted."
Jason nodded. "Do you think they're too young for an explanation?"
"You're so smart, though.  Did you get good grades?"
The meal was not exactly torture, but it was certainly one of the most uncomfortable meals John had ever eaten. Sherlock came along, to be true, but he merely sat with them and stared off into the distance while he and Lestrade tried to make awkward small talk. It would have been easier if he had at least been pretending to pay attention, but he wasn't even looking in their direction. Lestrade seemed to feel just as he did, as after about ten minutes he gave up the pretense of conversation and they just ate their turkey sandwiches as fast as they could manage. (Sherlock didn't order anything himself, but he did steal the cucumber off of John's plate. That was fine with him; he didn't particularly care for cucumber anyway.)
"I don't suppose you'd be willing to do it again?"
"Because it's not a romantic one."
"Why did they want you to talk to her? You couldn't have admitted her," he finally said.
"So what did she say then?"
"And your wife died of a pulmonary embolism?"
"Thirteen, I think."  Mari looked like she'd had a sudden revelation.  "That must be why he's so caught up about it."
"You're not going to testify."  It was almost an accusation.
The one thing I have the most trouble with in writing is, weirdly enough, naming characters. I once came up with a background for a character that was longer than the entire story he was in, and I still couldn't think of a name for him. If I'm not inspired, I'll use an initial or symbol for the character until I come up with a suitable one. Obviously this couldn't be done in this story, so when I tried to think of an easy way to get names, a thought occured to me. The story's named after a book about missing people, right? So why not name the original characters, or at least the victims, after missing children in the UK and Ireland? I did, and it worked very well in the end. Some of the victims are very similiar looking to the child they're named for, and some are not. Whenever we meet a new character, I'll list and link to the inspirations for their name/appearance.
"No, just attending a trial," John responded.
"Yes."  John's throat closed up and instead of saying more he nodded at her as he went out the door and hailed a cab.  The driver played a loud and obnoxious station where the hosts clearly thought they were much funnier than they were, but John didn't object.  It neatly curtailed the discussion of anything.  Even so, he felt relieved to get out at the court.  Just as his cab left, another came and out came Lou, brown bakery bag in hand.
"No.  I am capable of learning from my mistakes," Lestrade retorted.
“Yes!”  Sherlock held up the item in his hand. It was an old-fashioned tape recorder.  Not the digital kind, but the one that used magnetic tapes.  He pressed the play button and a tinny recording started.  At first it was just static, but a few seconds later music began.  It wasn’t the sort of music that a station would play, but a music box.  The strange sound went on for a few minutes.  Sherlock only spoke to say “
"Yes we are." Arthur, the woman, and the other man all walked off into the distance. He was now alone with the large man.
"What did they say after that?"
"And what is your profession?"
John stared at him for a second in shock before saying "The best suit you own."
"No further questions," Susan said with satisfaction.  She took her seat next to Lou.
"No.  She even asked if She was going to take pictures."
"You know Her solicitors are going to try to savage you on the stand," Sherlock warned him.  "They won't be too hard on Moira since she's a child and no one wants to be seen as harassing someone that young.  You're out in the open."
“Her flat.”
This Molly had to be fairly unflappable (Martin supposed anyone who worked in a morgue had to be that way) because her only sign of shock was a hand to the chest.  "So there's someone named Martin in Sherlock's body?"
“How many times has K done this before?”
"Don't worry, I didn't."
"I pled guilty.  I knew I was guilty.  Just like before."
Sherlock looked over the fence before following him in. From the looks of the yard, geese did indeed live there. He supposed the shed near the back of the garden was the goose shed. He'd have to take a good look later.
"When you came to the country were you fluent in English?"
"Almost a year."
"Then I guess it's my turn," Tammy said.  "It has been getting better.  Not past the 'sleeping in separate rooms' bit yet, but she's stopped snapping at every little thing and glaring at the vanilla extract."
Phillip had just finished the cocoa when John heard someone coming up the stairs.  He took a deep breath.  Sherlock turned his head towards the door for a second.  Phillip didn't seem to have heard it.  Less than a minute later someone knocked on the door.  John jumped up to get it.  He opened the door to find a tired-looking Mr. Rodgers.  Before he could say anything, Sherlock jumped up from the sofa, blocking the view of the door.  "Good to see you here," Sherlock told him, carefully not addressing him by name.
John wasn't even sure what to say as they got into a cab headed for the Yard. He had a hundred questions buzzing in his head, but he doubted Sherlock would answer any of them. It was a good thing Sherlock had gone back to staring distantly out the window, because then he couldn't see the text he sent to the one person who might have those answers.
"How did he look?" John dared to ask.
"Your captain appears to have suffered a head injury or ingested a hallucinogen.  He won't do the walk around and insists he is Sherlock Holmes."
"Obviously not so no one can ever see it, but there may be some specific function that needs to be performed to access the data.  There was a case where a website only gave hidden content when a specific access sequence was followed..." Sherlock abruptly stopped, blinked, swallowed, and then went on.  "He may have not remembered to share that with his daughter.  Or he deliberately kept it from her so she could be shielded by never knowing what was on it."
Mr. Aherne fortunately understood what Sherlock was asking without the need for elaboration.  "That it was a woman?  I hadn't ruled it out.  I was in care as a child, you know, and back then that sort of thing wasn't a reason other children came in very often.  But they talked.  Not always to the carers, but to other children.  Mums, dads, sometimes both.  It made me think I was lucky.  Nora told me the same thing, and she heard stories like that too."  He nodded at Sherlock and stepped up to his daughters.  "Let's go get those ice creams now."  Moira removed a hand from her bear and took her father's other hand.  The four of them walked out into the hall, forming a small, touching moment of a family cracked, but ready to take steps to heal.
"Not all of it." Sherlock shifted again, trying to move away.
Once he had positioned the wheelchair in front of the stand, he smiled up at Susan.  "Hello, Thomas," Susan said.
"Is this a joke?" the woman at the other end said, sounding irritated.
"Do you think any of the children in the photographs were previously her foster children?"  John had just thought of it now, but it seemed frighteningly logical.
He sighed at John's words.  "I guess."  He slunk back to the bedroom he'd woken up in.  The library books came with him and he put them on the side table before letting himself fall to the bed with a sigh.  It felt like he had fallen down the rabbit hole.
"Yes, I was," said John, truthfully.
"What is this group for?"
It was only when he turned to look at himself in the bathroom mirror that he screamed.
"No.  She didn't even give me her first name.  She called herself Mrs. Williams.  Jennifer once called her 'the doctor lady.'  I'd give her Jennifer and she'd give me the money."
She nods. "I've told the therapist there I'm bringing someone new."
"What was he doing on the bed?"
"But if you had it at the airfield it could be a business expense!"
"Year nine."
"No, thank you."  John didn't want to spend any more time with the prosecutors, even if he intellectually knew what they said made sense.  "I’d better go and grab a seat."  He nodded and ducked into the courtroom before anything more could be said.  It was mostly empty other than a few of the more dedicated buffalo.
"Upset, like I said before.  A few days after she came here she told us she was supposed to go back to her mummy's today and if she knew that Jennifer was here.  I told her that her mother knew she was here.  She wanted to know when she'd be seeing her parents again and I said she'd be visiting them soon.  The schedule set up for visitations had her seeing her mother and father once a week, at separate visits.  She saw her father first, and he brought some toys and clothes to give to her, and that helped a bit."
John led the way into the clinic, hoping Sarah would know where Dr. Arthur had decided to wait for them.  She spotted him before he saw her, and waved to him.  She ducked into an examination room and John followed, Sherlock trailing silently behind.  "Thank you for getting here, John.  If I have to hear that man tell one more idiotic 'joke' I'll be part of your next murder investigation."  She raised her eyes to the ceiling.  "I hope he gives you some good information, but mind you he can be very certain about things, no matter the facts.  I remember when a well-known child psychologist was due to give a lecture here, Dr. Tracy Newsome, and Dr. Arthur kept going on about how he wanted to talk to him.  Bit of a shock when he was face to face with Dr. Tracy Alice Newsome," she added, clearly amused by the memory.  "Anyway, he's in the conference room on the second floor.  You know where that is."
"How did she respond to that?"
Yes it's late, yes it's short, yes I'm sorry, I've just been doing other writing things too.
"How did you respond to that?"
“I’m not sure what a dog obstacle course looks like.”  It was the truth.
Susan strode up to the stand once the judge had spoken and said "The prosecution calls Jane Henderson."  Another usher led a plump woman into the room.  Her light brown hair fell around her shoulders in slight curls; she wore glasses and a gray blouse and skirt.  She seemed motherly, like K had first seemed, but her face was open and kind and held nothing back.  Once she had settled herself down, Susan said: "Hello."
He went up to his room, rummaged around in his closet, and took out jeans, a jumper, a shirt, pants, and socks.  All were old but otherwise in good shape.  He then went downstairs and folded up the clothes beside the bathroom door.  "There are clothes for you outside the door," he told Phillip, and then went to the kitchen.  Sherlock was already in there heating up some water.
Whether it was that she had a cancelation or that she was so alarmed at John willingly planning to see her he didn't know, but she could get him an appointment later that afternoon.  Now he was sitting on the Tube trying to not think about the feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach.  It's for Sherlock, he told himself.  It doesn't matter what you think of it.  Sherlock needs help.  While that didn't make the feeling go away, it was enough to calm his nerves until he got to his stop.
"Sometimes She'd say She didn't know why She let me come around.  That I was terrible company and it was only because I was so good in bed."  Sherlock looked John in the eye, as if he needed to make sure John understood what he was saying.  "I - I'd beg Her to let me stay.  I promised I'd try to do better and be more interesting."
"Yes.  One drawing I found in the bathroom trash."
"So you just looked at her and knew?"
"Longitude and latitude!"  Sherlock pulled out his own mobile and began to type furiously.  "John, put the flash drive in your laptop and pull it up in the main computer.  Then enter N 27 E 78."
James looked at him for a moment. "We'll all be outside, then." He got up and left. Sherlock had no doubt that he was going to gather as many of the other homeless network members as he could to stake themselves outside the building. It was almost funny how they seemed to think they were the ones who had to protect him.
"When I went to the drug program at first I was just pretending to listen.  But every now and then this psychiatrist came in, and she sat down and gave me some tests once.  Said that I was depressed and got put on some medicine.  After that I started to pay attention.  But when I saw her on the news I knew I needed to come clean."
"What happened on that date at approximately four PM?"  Susan stepped back, as if to give her space to answer.
"'Are you sure?'"
"Yes She would, and She did."
"Did the doctor listen to anything you said?"
"Sometimes.  She liked me to touch Her too.  The same things She did to me, except She liked me to touch Her breasts.  And She had these things She liked me to put in Her."
"What happened after that?"
"At Bart's again.  A few days later."
"She stopped letting me go with Her to Her office when I started secondary school, although I still would wait for Her there.  She said She didn't need my help anymore," he replied in a childlike tone.
"They just stated he had been told."  Sherlock sounded like he didn't want to discuss it.
"Yes."
"He…" John tried to think of a delicate way to put it. "He told me about your bee."
"Bathroom.  The big stall."
"First K's solicitors will ask you questions of their own."  Before Sherlock could continue he was interrupted.
The older man looked the woman and the large man up and down with a suspicious air. "Why do you both look so grim?"
"Come in and see."
"Good morning," he replied.  "Hello Phillip, have you been here a long time?"
When he woke up, his first thought was that Phillip would be testifying today.  It weighed heavily on his mind as he got dressed and went downstairs.  To his surprise he could smell coffee, and instead of being curled up on the sofa, Sherlock was at the kitchen counter, typing furiously away on his laptop.  Hamish sat next to the computer.  "You made coffee?" John said in surprise.  He poured himself a mug and drank it down quickly.  Surprisingly, it was very good. John deliberately stood far enough away that he couldn't see the screen.
"Yeah.  After Darren and Josie and Shane went in.  She didn't see Aubrey or Blessing."
"Although he thought a crime had been committed?"
Sherlock gave Lestrade his typical "you're an idiot" look.  "Do remember that he had to keep his eyes shut the whole time.  K could have driven in circles for who knows how long and Phillip wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Furthermore, the park where this boy was left is the same one Moira met K at, if his description is accurate."
Before John could even process what was going on, Sherlock had knelt down in front of him and was grabbing at his belt.  He undid the buckle, opened the button on the front of his trousers, and would probably have gone for the zipper if John hadn’t grabbed his hands and forced them on either side of him.  “What are you doing?” he said in horror.
"Slashing your bedsheets with a knife, or setting them on fire."
"I missed you too.  You're very dear to me."
"Yeah, it was like you see in those romance movies."
Both of them walked together to the exit doors, John going to hail a cab while Victor pulled out his mobile and said he needed to be picked up.  John's ride home was silent and grim.
“Yeah.”
"Maybe not. But until you're off that stuff - not forever, but off your high now - I'm gonna watch out for you."
"Was your daughter living with you at the time?"
"It was right in front of me," Phillip said, and John and Sherlock both laughed at his frankness.
"Yes, she'll be sitting with her solicitors," Sherlock quietly replied.
Martin realized at this point he hadn't asked the obvious question. "Who is it that I'm in the body of?"
"Yes, but this has some initials on it, or there wouldn't be the dots."  He turned the flash drive over in his hands.  "It's not ten years old.  He must have moved the information."  At the moment there was nothing but interest in his voice and deduction in his eyes.  This case might be just what Sherlock needed to distract himself from the horrible news.
After Judge Foster had seated himself and asked both parties if they were ready, Lou made his way up to the stand.  "The prosecution calls Phillip Rodgers."  An usher led Phillip up to the stand.  In fact, he was more leading him by the arm, as Phillip walked slowly, hesitantly.  He looked petrified.
John realized he was next.  He wondered where he would even begin.  "It's been a strange week," he finally said.  "I've found out he's been vanishing to get high every time he leaves the flat.  He stays gone until he comes down."
"Yeah," Kieran replied, and the audience laughed.
"No laundry, but this flat has a washer and dryer."  Mrs. Murray stepped out of the bedroom and opened the other hall door, which revealed a washer and dryer stacked on each other.  "The only laundry nearby lost a few of my things right after I moved in here, so I made sure the tenants all had their own.  Of course my mystery tenant already had a set."
"I don't know.  I haven't been sentenced for solicitation yet."
"Moira wants me to come back, so yes, you will. We have to deliver the tape to the Yard first, but Lestrade says that if you want to listen to it you can go down there tomorrow." Sherlock sounded once more confident and professional. It was hard to imagine he was the same person who had been so gentle with a child minutes ago.
"No," whispered Sherlock, who looked like a scolded child.
"Once he finds out that his father didn't run off, wants to see him, and loves him, he will want to live with him.  He's hungry for love."  Sherlock looked away at the last sentence.
"What did you see that's so important?" John asked Sherlock as he stood up and turned towards the desk in a dramatic twirl, grinning wildly.
"He said that I acted oddly around Her."
"If that person broke your arm, even if it was an accident, then they've committed a crime."
"Get out of here now!"  Sherlock leapt off the sofa and turned towards his brother, clearly furious.  "I thought I made it clear you weren't wanted!"
Seemingly from nowhere, Lou produced a small collection of photographs.  John took a deep breath as he realized what they were.  "I'd like you to take a look at these photographs," he said as he held one in front of Mr. Aherne.  "Do you recognize where this was taken?"
“There’s a small container I use for that sugar, so I can have a place to put it if I travel. I keep it on one of the top shelves in the kitchen.”  Realization appeared on his face.  “Are you saying that this K told Moira if she told me my sugar would be poisoned?”
"Mr. Aherne, keep that feeling with you.  You'll need it for the trial," Lestrade said.
"I want to go to bed."  John didn't register what Sherlock had said for a second, since it wasn't a response to his comment.  He had to pay attention when his head emerged from the ball he had made of himself.  At first John wondered if this was an escape tactic, as Sherlock usually went for so long without sleeping and he'd slept for so many hours yesterday, but when he saw the dark circles under his eyes John figured he was telling the truth.
"Understandable," Sherlock replied flatly.
"And that's our job," John concluded.
When Jennifer didn't go on, Lou asked: "What happened after that?"
"Did you make the connection between that and Moira's visits to the park?" said Lou.
“I’m not going anywhere and I’m certainly not dying.  And K can’t just adopt you.  K couldn’t even take you into their home unless they had a foster license.” Mr. Aherne was firm.  A brief look of surprise appeared on Sherlock’s face, but in a second it was gone.  John suddenly had a horrible feeling that K might in fact have one of those.
"Yeah."
"I understand," Sherlock replied.
Unlike someone covered in blood and wielding a harpoon, the cabs of London were more than willing to take two men with a large stuffed bee, even if the driver kept looking back at it in confusion.  Sherlock kept it tucked under his arm the whole time.  John couldn't tell if he was happy with the gift.  He seemed numb, as if he was in shock.  In fact, until they clambered up the stairs and back into 221B he was oddly expressionless.  Whether this would have continued after they were at home John didn't know, because as soon as they stepped through the door they were greeted by a visitor.
"And me," Jason added.
"Do you find that to be the case yourself?  With children and their parents?" Clark asked.
"Do you ever talk to your father about these things?"
"Do you have any idea why the students didn't like him?"
"I know that.  Why are you doing this now?  You've never wanted to do that before, and if you have you've never mentioned it."
“Should I be going?” Lestrade asked.  “Tape recorder's here and you've wanted to interview the others by yourself.”
"Because.  He said he didn't agree.  That I hadn't been telling horrible lies.  That it was all true."
"Hello," he replied.
"That would be fine."
"Flat.  Depressed. Evasive.  All of that was what made me file a report for child abuse."
"Twins, I take it,” Sherlock said, not asking a question but rather stating a fact.  "They're from Nigeria?"
"No," she whispered.
“When I was listening to the interview with Phillip, I noticed that he said the flat didn’t look used, and I remembered that case.  Since it didn’t fit the pattern, and he didn’t live in the same neighborhood, he wasn’t originally thought to be part of all this. But he did say the flat was very clean and the shades were drawn.”  He opened the door to his office as he spoke, and at that moment a mobile let out a sharp series of rings.  Sherlock’s hand disappeared into the pocket of his coat and he pulled out his phone.
This is the beginning of Lestrade's awkwardness with Sherlock. Some of it at first is from fear the investigation will go badly, but as the story progresses it's from what he finds out.  Lestrade thinks he's intruded on Sherlock's privacy to know what he learns, even unintetionally, so he begins to avoid talking to him directly.
"To make sure you don't run off instead of testifying," he clarified.  Sherlock looked at him for a moment, then rolled out of bed.  "I'm going to take a shower now," John added as he headed out of the room.
"Yeah."
"You've come a long way in a month, yourself," Eli said. "I can tell you're not as angry."
"A friend."  He sat down in the nearest chair.
He walked over to stand with Susan and John.  "Ah, you're late.  The family of Victim Five is in the waiting room already."
Sherlock sat at the other side of the table with John.  He had put down the papers when they had first come in, and now he looked right at the family.  "Hello," he said gently.  "I understand that this is difficult for you.  However, right now there are children still around your foster mother.  They need your help now."
If he hadn't taken the drugs, he would have made the connection sooner. James Warren, victim twelve at the trial. Since Alla Pinyakova had been victim eleven they must have met then. Not wanting to go into all this, he just nodded.
"Did you stay in the park all the time when you met K there, or did you go somewhere else?" said Sherlock.
“A bunch of times.”
"What did they tell you?"
"It's not something I thought about until recently," John admitted. He turned and started towards the door
"I like your ribbons.  Who did your hair today?"
"I'm not me," Martin quickly replied, and cursed himself internally for saying it. Just like him to put his foot in his mouth.
"I wanted to see Her again and I knew She worked there.  Mum was at work and the sitter I had was an old lady who fell asleep a lot.  Our flat's pretty close by, so I just walked there."  At this point Phillip's hair curtained his face.
"With Jennifer never saying who'd done it and Mr. Ogbeide being ruled out, I believe the case was just closed."
"No, I haven't," Sherlock responded, still sounding flat, like he hadn't heard the apology.
“No, I'm afraid.  I've never had the courage to ask her and I know she wouldn't understand what I meant if I asked about being sold.”  He looked to the ground.  “That's all I know about this.  I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.”
The commotion was enough to bring the other pilot, Douglas, out of the plane.  "What's going on?  Can you all not get enough of Frankfurt-Hahn?"
"What happened after that?" Lou asked.
"And one of Jennifer's parents, at least," John added.
"That settles it, then."  Knowing Sherlock was uncomfortable with the intimacy of the moment, he changed the subject.  "I'm going to start supper soon.  Tea before then?"
"What was she like at other times?"
"One more thing." Phillip's voice was quick. "Do you still know that person?"
"Did you at one point?"
Sherlock walked over to the table the clock sat on.  The only thing on it besides the clock was a battered wallet.  The size of it indicated it belonged to whoever his body did.  He opened it and found one five pound note, a torn paystub with "get more laundry detergent" written on it, and a driving license, reversed so he could only see that the man was certified in the UK to drive a car, a minibus, and a motorbike.  He flipped it over and was faced with himself in his new body.  The man's name was Martin Crieff.   Nothing else was there.  The pay stub indicated he wasn't paid a lot, but he must have had some job that required travel.  The other man was probably a co-worker; if this Martin Crieff had a lot of one-night stands he would be carrying a great deal more money in his wallet, if nothing else.
"Hello," said Mr. Ogbeide in response.
"Not any more. They moved and I no longer live in the same area."
Sherlock squeezed Hamish tighter as he said:  "When I was four years old my brother went to school..." and proceeded to tell the story he'd told John about when he'd met K.  Since John was in the front row for the first time, he could clearly see the buffalo's expressions; most of them looked shocked even though they'd been at the trial for every day John had been there.
"Yeah.  Then She did the same thing with me."
"Sometimes when she came back she'd be singing that children's rhyme.  'Ride a cock-horse to Banbury cross...'  Other times she'd fall asleep as soon as she got through the door.  She never said anything about what went on though. She did call where she went 'the fucking room' a few times but never explained why."
"Died when he was little."
"Do you have any brothers or sisters?"
"I didn't mention who it was, but yes."  He didn't bother to mention she'd figured it out anyway; this was hard enough on Sherlock.  "I wanted to see what I could do to help you.  And - it hurts hearing all this from you.  I needed to talk to someone about it."
"And we leave later tomorrow. After we've both eaten dinner at the least. You will find it a lot easier to talk to a child who's got food in their stomach." John turned to leave the room and almost didn't hear the response he got.
"He said he wanted to see you," Mr. Rodgers said.
It was a bee.  A large stuffed bumblebee.  Its yellow and black stripes shone like any new stuffed toy did.  It had two beady black eyes, six legs, and antennae.  Sherlock continued to stare at it as it sat in his lap.  He seemed paralyzed.
"Yeah."
"No, of course not. K won't know we've talked. Thank you, Moira." Sherlock emerged from the room. He looked paler than usual, although it was hard to tell. "Come along, John," he said as he walked down the hallway. They returned in the kitchen where Mr. Aherne was still waiting, his other two children now eating a biscuit each. To John's surprise, he thrust a plate of biscuits wrapped in plastic at Sherlock.
"Well, the father was fighting the mother for custody.  A man who wants to take a little girl from her mother?  It doesn't make sense.  Also, the perpetrator was probably someone known to the child, and statistically it was most likely to be the father."  He seemed pleased with his logic.
Harvey took a step back and looked at Phillip.  John could guess where she was trying to go - if K really was sexually attracted to children, it would seem odd if she wanted to marry one as an adult.  Of course, she could easily be lying, and even if she wasn't John suspected that her desire to do so had nothing to do with sexual attraction and everything to do with having someone who would do anything she asked.  "You must like her a lot to want to marry her, then," she said.
"Come and see," Sherlock replied.  John came to stand over him.  It was a periodic table, an exact copy of the one Sherlock owned.  He had already wrapped it in bubble wrap.  A large box sat waiting for it.
"Hi," she chirped out.
"We're not sleeping on the street," he replied, sounding offended.
"No!" he said with a sharp intake of breath. "He can't know that, he'd hate me!"
"Kind of, yes."
"She was neglecting Jennifer - not taking care of her properly.  And she wasn't trying to change.  We argued about it and she said she'd do something about it but never did."
"How well did your mother know Dr. Martin?"
Resisting the urge to respond "That was it" he just said "Go ahead."
"Yes.  The mortgage was paid off by a one-time bonus to the CEO.  Me.  Now the house is ours, and we can continue to conduct the business the money was so generously earmarked for."  So, their business had once been in financial trouble, only saved by someone, probably a client, dying and willing them a large sum of money.  The woman didn't look like the type who threw money away without thinking.
"Are you referring to his brother?" Lou asked.
Susan started to walk up the steps again.  John followed her.  As she walked she began to speak again.  "Well, today we have Victim Five, Victim Four, and Victim Four's mother.  If all goes well tomorrow we'll have Victim Four's father, Victim Four's former foster mother, and Mrs. Murray the landlady.  Thursday will be Victim Ten and his parents. Friday will be Victim Six, Victim Eight, and their mother's cousin.  Monday should be Victim Fifteen and the current foster carer of Victims Fourteen and Fifteen.  Tuesday is Victim Thirteen, Victim Eleven, and Victim Twelve. So after the officer who arrested Victim Twelve testifies on Wednesday, he'll be up."
"Yeah."
John could see where this was going and cut him off before he finished the sentence.  "If what you're talking about is masturbating, that still doesn't mean you enjoyed it.  That's just all the experience you've had with sex and it carries over.  She is the adult here.  Not you.  Even if you demanded something from her when you first met, she has the responsibility to refuse. Legally you cannot consent."
John expected Sherlock to try to bolt again, but he didn't. He merely looked away and mumbled, "Yes, it does."
"Why am I listed as Victim Three?  None of the charges involve me.  Statute of limitations and all that."  While Sherlock clearly meant to sound angry, his shame crept into his voice.  He laid down the paper he was holding and John noticed it listed Victims One to Fifteen, with their real names in parenthesis by the side. He couldn't make out any of the names.
"Asleep.  At least I hope he's asleep."
This part is where it starts to get more descriptive. Throughout writing the story, I struggled with the writing of the actual abuse.  I couldn't very well gloss it over, because that would take away the horror, but I didn't want to be accused of overly focusing on the details.  I also knew very well if I wasn't at least somewhat explicit, some acts of abuse would fly over people's heads.
"I saw them carry one out.  I wasn't in the flat but was standing outside it."  Mrs. Murray looked like she was about to go on, but before she could Clark interrupted her.
While the flu patients were a welcome distraction on Monday, by the end of Wednesday John was thoroughly tired of them. He wanted nothing more than to not think for the rest of the evening and prepare for tomorrow's visit with the Aherne family. Lestrade had got permission to have them interview Moira again and to tape the conversation, and had even provided a tape recorder from the Yard ("you'll have to give it right back, of course"). Since Sherlock had been so silent over the last few days, he figured this would be easy. John hadn't even seen any new experiments around the flat. When Sherlock's nose wasn't buried in the file, he was writing things down in a notebook John had never seen before. Of course, the bubble burst as soon as he got home and saw Sherlock bouncing like he usually did in the throes of a case. "John! Before the visit tomorrow I'd like to run some ideas by you." He sounded delighted.
"Primary in King's Cross."
“Correct.  He did say that he thinks they are still in London because he can hear a lot of cars go by.”  There was still a definite feeling of restraint to Sherlock.  His words were carefully measured; his mood determinedly flat.  This confirmed to John that Sherlock did in fact strongly identify with Phillip.  He had been kind and understanding with Moira Aherne as well, but he hadn’t exploded after any of their talks.  For his part, John still got chills when he thought of Moira’s childish voice repeating K’s, “Are you a boy or a girl?”  Phillip hadn’t shared anything nearly that disturbing.
"That would be nice." He sounded like he had perked up a bit.
Phillip let out a sob. "Did you, um. Did She ever find out about those dreams you had?"
"No?  Why not?"
"The children?" John echoed.  He had a feeling this was about more than the children K had abused, but wasn't sure what it was.
"That he knew I was shy and it'd just take some time. He asked if they were teasing me and I said no because they really weren't.  The other kids just ignored me."
“Sometimes.  Not every day, though.”  Moira placed her hand over Sherlock’s.
"She's a pediatrician," Sherlock clarified, like this was an obvious thing.
It had been four months since K had been first arrested.  Next week was the start of the trial.  John couldn't help but think of it in the same capital letters he used for Sherlock's Issues.  The Trial.  They were meeting with Lestrade so late that the sun was setting, and in the middle of summer to boot.  John welcomed the privacy the time gave them.  "I'm not going to testify, am I?" he asked.
"You talked about both of them when you mentioned their responses.  Did you notice anything different from parent to parent?"
"Did anything else happen when you were there?"
"Your age?"
"Very. I keep telling him that it'll help all the other kids she could hurt and that helps." If anyone in the room knew it was the trial that was all over the news they didn't mention it. They all listened to Gloria like it was new to them.
The answer dawned on him.  “You mean the flash drive?  But that won’t help at all.  It’s got to be months if not years old, and they wouldn’t be stupid enough to re-use a pad, right?”
"So you never told him you had a hard time making friends?"
"Yes, I have."  He sounded confident.
"Not until today, no," he replied.
"That's probably a good idea for now. Tea?" John figured someone had to be hospitable here, and he'd just heated up a kettle full of water.
"You didn't see a different thing that was similar between the two of you?"
John didn't need to be directed to try it.  "Nothing again."
"I'll make sure he gets it," John reassured her.
“Why?”
John wasn't sure if he was referring to Sherlock or both of them, but responded anyway.  "I've got an older sister."
"Not very much, no."
"The next day I went down to the social services office so they could interview me.  They asked if I knew anyone who I thought could have hurt Jennifer and I said I didn't know.  They asked about Debra and if she had a boyfriend, and I said as far as I knew she didn't.  I did mention that she did quite  a bit of drugs but even with that she'd never hurt Jennifer.  I got asked about our relationship, and I told them the drugs had ended it and we'd shared time with her since."
"I missed you," Phillip said.
"Have you ever lived in London?"
“Maybe.”
"Did you say you were sure?"
"She said that most people in the world have some bread with breakfast, and Mum didn't think Skip should eat the sausages they have."
Without a word, Sherlock brandished his laptop.  The flash drive stuck out of one side, and on the screen was an open folder with a program in it.  “If we get a chance to look through the history of the program, we can figure out what the recording says.”
"Even when your daughter talked about this, did she ever say who was doing something to her?"  Harvey gave a slight shake of her head.
"Fine," Sherlock replied flatly. There was no anger, just blankness.
"Considering the way you shower I should have woken you up earlier."
"Or bathe in acid." Sherlock knew they both didn't literally mean what they said, but he knew the feeling.
He’d assumed Sherlock would be gone all night, so he was a bit surprised to hear a key turning in the door.  Sherlock stumbled in without his usual grace.  “John!  It’s time!” he barked out, and made his way over to the sofa.
"This is giving me a headache." Martin wasn't joking; his head had started to throb. "You don't know any famous Martin Crieff's in fiction that happen to be pilots, do you?" If he was a fictional character in this world he wasn't sure how to react.
"No."
"Apparently he has been able to locate the four siblings that K fostered eight years ago.  One of the boys now has a child and it came up in the medical record search."  He sounded detached, but John suspected it was artificial detachment rather than the standard distance he usually placed between him and the victims of a case.
"No, they're watching telly in the lounge. I just couldn't leave them with someone. We have no living family…" He trailed off with a sigh. "Should I be in the room with Dr. Watson?"
"Probably," Mari admitted.  "He's thirteen so it's not like he's too young for it, but he's so protective of him, especially since his mother died."
"And try to talk to your father.  He cares deeply for you."
"Yes."
"Crisis?" he asked.
Sherlock still had not removed his arm from the bee.  "I presume you had some sort of object like that as a child?"
"Darren, Shane, and Aubrey."
"With my daddy."  The crowd laughed.
As I said on my other story, sorry for the delay. I am working on five different writing projects and trying to juggle them is hard.
"She said I needed to practice more.  That I needed to kiss like a grown-up.  Then She said She'd show me that, and She kissed me back."
"Both."
"You delete his texts," John pointed out. "Is there a particular reason you want to avoid him so much?"
She was now frowning. "But you're all grown up. Why don't you have a dog now?"
"Almost two years."
"Circumstances."
"No. Once the two of them come out we can go back in and listen to the interview." He leaned against the wall, apparently content to wait.
"Is there any pattern to his usage?" Dr. Dodson asked.
Moira Aherne is physically modeled after
"Do you know how it happened?"
"Not exactly suspicious, but there were a lot of odd things there."
John knew he was right, but he also had a nagging feeling that if there really was a dangerous predator on the loose with at least thirty victims NSY needed all the help they could get, Sherlock included. He'd never even seen Sherlock question a child before, so there was no past experience to rely on.
"That's very direct of you.  The answer is yes.  And the answer is yes to that as well.  No, that doesn't change what I said before."  John heard shuffling.  "I understand that too.  There's not an answer to that.  Phillip, you're – " Sherlock abruptly stopped talking.  "No," he began again after a long pause.  "None of that is true."  His voice was quieter.  "And you can..."  Each word was softer than the next, so that after the "can" John was unable to discern any of the conversation.  After a few minutes Sherlock spoke in a normal voice.  "Yes, you should go to bed.  Please remember you can ring me any time and I will talk to you.  You are never an inconvenience.  Good night, Phillip."  He heard the creak of someone going down the steps.  John lay there in the dark for what seemed like a long time, unable to get the conversation out of his head, even if he hadn't understood most of it.  He didn't mention what he had overheard the next morning, and if Sherlock was truly aware that he had been listening he never let on.  Despite that, John was almost certain he knew, and that he had intentionally let him hear the conversation.  What that meant he couldn't figure out.
"Lestrade and Donovan asked me to," John responded without thinking.
"How are you?"
"The number of passengers required to carry a flight attendant?"
Arthur perked up at this. "If he sleeps on GERT-I can I do it too? We can have popcorn! I know where Karl hides it!"
"John is well acquainted with Victim Three," Lestrade added.
"I see," Sherlock replied, not expressing any emotion at all.
"Yes."
“The Czech Republic has admitted to running OLX, but you are otherwise correct.”
"I understand," sympathized John, who only realized after he said it was revealing something about himself.
"In theory, but they also have to have special conditions for wherever they live."  Lou didn't say anything more and John wondered what those conditions were.
"Has she talked about it since?" Lou continued.
That set off even more alarms.  "Fine," he said.  He couldn't think of a reason not to short of point blank questioning Sherlock's motives.
"She got here before us, actually.  Rang me when I was on my way here."
"And that was all you did?"
"It doesn't seem the best place, no."
Before all of this began, it would have been the sort of lazy Sunday he rarely got to have.  Now, however, there was something sinister about it, and not just in the fact Sherlock was asleep upstairs and not working on one of his experiments or stealing his laptop or pacing around or sulking.  Everything suddenly seemed tainted by K.  John thought he'd been angry at K before, but then she had just been some unknown monster.  Now she was the person who had broken his best friend.  Someone who made you think all relationships caused pain and the best you could do was keep that pain familiar.  He knew that there was nothing he could do at this point, so he spent most of the day doing small things that needed to be done and doing his own sulking to try to control his anger.
"Let me ask you this.  If you had a friend like She was, one who talked to you and spent time with you, but didn't want you to have sex with them, would that be enough?"  Sherlock's voice was soft.
"What did you hear of those little things?"
"So your toy was taken away forever?" To John, that seemed cruel, but without any knowledge of the circumstances it was difficult to draw a conclusion.
He knew that he really should have known better, that he didn't know anything about K to make a mental image of the person.  But truthfully he had never once thought of K as being anyone but a man.  If he had to line up potential child abusers, and K was included, he'd have put her dead last.  It only took a second to make the next horrible connection.
"Why the world news?" John asked.  Peter narrowed his eyes, and John quickly added "It just doesn't seem like the best thing for someone with mental problems."
"Why?"
"Actually, yes. Some.  A few of the images were originally traded online, on a password-protected forum.  It was brought down in a sweep a few years ago, but several members, including some frequent posters, are still unidentified.  Dr. Martin might not have been a member of that board - and nothing on her computer or laptop indicated that she'd been there at all - but she clearly knew some of the posters there."
“Obviously.  But if we don’t know what it means that’s useless.”  He couldn’t make heads or tails of it himself.  Was Jan a name or a location?  Or was it a reference to Jain, since there was already an Indian connection?  Even Sherlock wasn’t likely to know that.
"I didn't think it was anyone in particular.  If you're asking whether I'm pleased to see her arrested at last, I can't deny that."  Mycroft continued to look at Sherlock.  John suddenly felt very like a third wheel.
Mr. Rodgers nodded, and the two of them went to a small burger place nearby.  "I don't know Phillip as well as Sherlock does, you know," John warned after they got their food and sat down.
"I said something to him."
"What are your brothers' names?"
"He lived down the street from me so I started to walk home with him after school.  He first started to say all sorts of things he had figured out about me.  None of it was anything I didn't already know, so I just acknowledged that it was all true.  After that went on for a few days he told me he wanted to be alone.  I said to him that I didn't think anyone always wanted to be alone.  He stopped making those remarks then but he didn't say anything to me until I mentioned a physics lecture my mother had recently attended.  He said something about spectrographic analysis that had been in a book he read, and that broke the ice for good."
Phillip's eyes were now both visible as he lifted his head to face Sherlock. He looked rather surprised.
"But you never saw any sign of any person there?"
"No, not at all."
After a minute or so of uncomfortable silence, John made himself say, "Go on."
“What do you mean?”
"I told her to be good, but that was about it."
"No new news here," Eli said. "Her brother's staying with us for a few days - not any crisis in his family, he's just got work for a few days in London - and it's nice having him around. It's eerie how much they look alike."
He suddenly understood a bit more of what Mycroft was getting at.  “To see if they had large expenses they couldn’t account for?  Or large influxes of money?”
"No.  It just... changed."
"Not now. I want you to wait until you've talked to Moira Aherne again. I'd also like to tape that conversation, and I'll talk to her father about that. If you're going to be working on this case I think we'll need proof that you're good with the children you're going to question." He took a long sip of his tea before speaking again. "Once the other Yarders hear all of that it'll be easier for me to convince them. According to her father, she gets out of the hospital in two days. There's a school holiday on Thursday, so if you want to go over then I'll talk to him."
"It's... well... I don't know," he finally admitted.  He looked ashamed.
“Are you here for a reason?” drifted up from the window.  John looked out and saw Sherlock standing in front of Phillip Rodgers, hands in his coat pockets.
The boy spat on the ground. "No. James. Jim is what my mum called me." After a minute he said "I saw those papers today."
Day two of the trial.
"If you still wish to be at the trial early today, you should leave soon."  Sherlock began typing furiously again.
John thought suddenly of the "helper" comment K had made and felt a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.  "Well, I am.  Finish your tea."  Sherlock put both of his shaking hands on the mug and drank the rest of it in one long gulp.  He was still looking at John and wasn't curled up on himself again, and at that moment it became all too much for John to handle.  "Give me ten minutes to go upstairs.  I'll be back after that and we'll talk some more," he made himself say.  Sherlock nodded silently, his eyes suddenly very large.  That was enough to propel John up the steps and into his room, where he shut the door and finally allowed himself to cry.
"All right, and I know you said you have no living family, but is there anyone else you know that might be capable of something like this? Anyone in the area that seems too fond of children? Some man who's always around but doesn't appear to be doing anything? Strange behavior from a father or a relative of one of Moira's friends?" Lestrade hadn't broken his gaze on Mr. Aherne since he had begun the tale of the trip to A&E.
"It would be helpful."
John realized quickly that it was good he had his wallet on him; Sherlock was apparently heading to the railway station.  Fortunately, he seemed so absorbed in whatever he was doing that he didn't notice he had a follower.  He curtly informed the man at the ticket booth that he was going to Yorkshire, shoved money at him, and took off toward the platform.  John quickly bought a ticket for himself and returned to shadowing Sherlock.  He attempted to ring Lestrade but only was able to leave a message.  "Sherlock got some information from Phillip Rodgers that caused him to take off for Yorkshire.  I'm not sure what he's up to but am following him.  I'll give you a location as soon as I have it."  He hoped that Lestrade would get the message as soon as possible.
John froze halfway to the microwave.  "I suppose they didn't tell you how he reacted?"
"Romantic?" Tammy said.
"My gran died when I was little.  I don't know what happened to my dad.  Mum said he ran off."
Just before six, Mrs. Hudson came up, supposedly to retrieve her tea mug, but as soon as the evening news came on she sat in the remaining chair.  "I can watch just as well up here," was her excuse.
Eventually he drifted back to sleep. He slept lightly and uneasily, and woke as soon as dawn came. After getting dressed, he decided to go to the kitchen. He wasn't hungry in the slightest, but he could at least make coffee and read the papers; they were always here by this hour. And when he went into the kitchen the papers were indeed piled up by the door. He made the coffee and drank down half of it before taking the pile and looking at the headlines.
