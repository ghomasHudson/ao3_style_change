“Oh, my love, you are so perfect. How the hell did I ever get so lucky?” John smiles, kissing Sherlock softly.
“I know you do, love. I want you too. Let's get you home, you beautiful creature.” John sighs, reluctantly pulling away from his husband.
John crawls back up Sherlock's body, brushing back the curls that are starting to stick to his boyfriend's forehead, “Let's go get a shower, baby.” He whispers softly, kissing Sherlock's cheek.
“That's a good point actually. Maybe telling me you were a vampire before sex would have been more appropriate.” John giggles, looking up at Sherlock.
“Well, me and your father thought it would be a good idea for you to interact with the other children but, we know you hate breakfast club so we’re sending you a little later so you can still socialise but you don’t have to be there long.” John smiled at his daughter.
Mycroft moves round from his desk, dropping solidly to his knees and taking both his partner and his little brother in his arms.
He shifts over and sits up as Sherlock pulls out some lube and pours it on his fingers. The younger man starts to prepare himself and John watches with undisguised hunger as Sherlock moans softly.
The older vampire bites hard into the flesh and Sherlock releases John's neck to scream his mate's name to the heavens, just as John wanted; as he orgasms all over John.
John starts to pull off his shirt, just as Sherlock looks back up again and stares intently at his friend.
“That's not funny, ya bastard.” Greg replies, fighting the urge to grin. “And if we're anything, we're
John is completely undone and he orgasms shortly after, looking up at the blood he's drawn from Sherlock's neck.
“Sorry. Who are you?” John asks worriedly, as he's walked out of the bunker and into the glaring Afghan sun.
John was dramatically losing control but did as Sherlock asked; biting him hard and sucking at the skin, leaving a dark purple mark that was beautiful against the stark paleness of Sherlock's skin.
"Right.” She replies in a nervous whisper, stepping back from the strange man. “What did you mean, you need ... blood?"
He was incredibly surprised when his partner placed the final plate of spaghetti bolognaise on the table and the kitchen was still in a reasonable state.
Tentatively, John brings a hand up to Sherlock's curls, tangling his fingers in them and pushing his head slightly so the kiss deepens. Sherlock's eyes flutter and he feels like his brain is going fuzzy, caught up in the moment, in John.
John's hand starts to work on Sherlock slowly, preventing the younger teen from worrying. Sherlock moans into John's lips, indicating for him to go faster.
“So how come the girl never like, grew up? I mean, you look thirty now but obviously you were a kid once so when did you get bit?” Maggie asks curiously.
"Now, enough talk. Make yourself useful, Doctor Watson." Sherlock growled seductively, directing John's hands to his jeans.
Three more days it takes before Sherlock self-destructs and Detective Inspector Lestrade has to try and find the broken hearted kid he's come to love as his own. And after two months, Sherlock falls off the grid completely, leaving Greg and Mycroft to search for the younger man.
I should know because I'm Harriet. I'm fifteen years old and just as clever as Father, if not more so. But I'm also compassionate and like to help people, just like Dad. All in all, my dads are raising me well.
Mycroft pulls up to his home and Sherlock immediately jumps out, running through the door and into the living room.
Mrs Hudson agrees, she's had to deal with a starving Sherlock once before and she barely made it out alive that day.
Sherlock does as he's told and obediently follows John to a table, sitting down and waiting for his lunch.
“Move away from him, Sherlock. He's going to need blood, and he's going to be much stronger than you. I'll need to …”
“I had better get to bed,” John said, “I don’t know how long she’ll give me… I have to take it when I can you know.”
Seconds slogged by like minutes as Sherlock desperately tried to piece together the fragments of his thoughts. He felt reality slipping under him like shifting sand. On the one hand he knew he should say something quickly, put John’s mind at ease, but he did not know how to form words any more.
John and Rosie had been living back at 221B for several months, happily it seemed. They had fallen back into an easy routine as though setting the needle back on the record, as though the last several years had never happened. But of course Sherlock had to expect that John would start dating again. A year had passed since Mary’s death – they had marked the occasion by resolutely not talking about it. But when Sherlock had ventured out in the afternoon to visit her resting place, there were lilies, so he knew John had been there earlier. How often had John lamented Rosie’s lack of a mother? The thought of sabotaging John’s dates, as he had years ago, was out of the question. Not if it meant that Rosie got what she needed.
“People call you a freak and a psychopath, but you’re not. You never were. But all along, right beside you was the real monster.”
He’s standing outside the door but it feels like a million miles between them. John leans his forehead against the door and strains to listen, hoping to hear some signs of movement inside. Normally once Sherlock closes a door it’s a fullstop on a conversation, and John has never intruded on the other man’s privacy before. Now, however, he’s desperate enough that he tries the door and finds it locked.
“I can’t stay here,” Sherlock confessed. “He’s already done it- killed me- and it’s only a matter of time until I finish the job.”
“Yeah, well, there’s always something,” John smirked behind the brim of his mug as he took a tentative sip of tea.
“You’re terrified,” Sherlock said plainly, hardly taking a moment to breathe before launching into his deductions. “Could be because this is the first date you’ve attempted since Mary died, more likely because the stakes are higher than you’re used to. You’ve been to the gym three times this week and after work today, which explains why you were so late coming home. You changed your clothes there, obviously you’re eager to go- don’t let me keep you.”
“What I mean Sherlock, is that if I move back in, this is it for me. I won’t leave again. Rosie deserves a family- one she can count on to be there.  You’ve confided a great trust in me today, and I wish I could give you more to go on, but I mean. It’s a process right? … So- ya. This, “he gestures between them, “Whatever it turns out to be, is it . . . if you’re ok with that.”
It was perhaps a bit early in the year to keep the fireplace lit in the sitting room of 221B Baker Street, but Sherlock liked the warmth and comforting glow. Though the first real frost had yet to creep across the window panes, the temperatures began to steadily drop as October progressed. The sky was already settling into an inky pall when he heard John’s footsteps on the stairs; lighter than normal- no Rosie then. A familiar and altogether uncomfortable tightness settled in Sherlock’s stomach. Date night.
“Sherlock,” and even to John's own ears it sounded like he was pleading. For what, exactly ? John wondered, for him not to confess anything because the intimacy of an honest conversation was too much for him? Because John couldn’t handle the fact that his best friend was not as indestructible as he claimed?
They are locked in a staring match now, and John can barely breathe. The lines around Sherlock’s eyes soften ever so slightly, instantly making him look younger, more vulnerable. Sherlock is an expert in Baritsu, he has seen him bring a man twice his size down, and yet he has never once raised a hand to defend himself against John. Not when he came back from the dead, not in the morgue.  John feels the question rise up in his throat unbidden and when it escapes his lips it is nothing more than a raspy whisper.
“Good morning mummy,” Mycroft replied with just the tiniest huff of a sigh. Violet could clearly see him rolling his eyes, and chuckled to herself as she raised her freshly poured coffee to her lips to gently blow against the surface. “I hardly think you’ll think it’s a privilege once I have related my news.
Taking Mycroft’s advice was seldom a good idea, but Sherlock hurls himself into his work with gusto.  It works for a time, pushing away thoughts that he’d rather not examine. If he just worked hard enough he could convince himself that it was just like old times.
“Ta,” He said, clearing his throat, and blinking away the vapor of impending tears. He took the strap of the bag, shoulders it, and then reaches for Rosie, who nestles deeper again Sherlock and babbles in protest and John extracts her and carries her to the sofa while Sherlock returned to the kitchen.
“And I am still so sorry about that,” Mary says, squeezing his arm emphatically. Laughter rumbled in his chest, so she continues, “The point is, Sherlock, I like you. I really do. And it doesn’t bother me at all that you’re in love with John.”
“No,” John shook his head, his fingers tangling in the curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck as though willing Sherlock to understand. Sherlock shook his head, his eyes clenched tightly shut, “He hasn’t won! You’re alive- you’re here!”
“Oh John,” Mary said sadly, pushing back from the table and staring with sympathetic eyes. She stood and collected her plate and put a hand on his shoulder as she passed. “Just give him some time to get his head back together,” she said, and the dishes clinked as she set them by the sink, “Let him build up his armor before going back into battle, yeah?”
Sherlock goes to bed but cannot sleep, instead he contemplates all the many wonderful facets of the two letter word that has all his hopes hinged upon it.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John seethed fiercely, taking Sherlock’s face in his small hands and forcing the detective to meet his gaze, “He has not defeated you-"
“Well, then I won’t keep you long,” Violent trilled, ignoring his surly “hurumph” sound. “You on a case, then?”
They move to their chairs and Sherlock carefully pours the tea. He is not a religious man, but this is an act of reverence. He hands John the cup, careful to avoid touching his hand.They sit and quietly sip and for the first time since John arrived, Sherlock begin to feel the tension easing. So they didn’t do small talk. Maybe they didn’t need to. Maybe they could have this, cups of tea by the fireplace and occasional spatial proximity and it would be enough. It was enough. It was more than enough, Sherlock reasoned, it had to be
In actuality, he hadn’t noticed her absence at all. Sherlock chews his bottom lip as he parses out how he had let that detail slip. It seemed only yesterday when she was nattering at him about something or another, important phone numbers or some such.
Sherlock wasn’t sleeping when he heard the knock on the door and he decidedly did not fall off the sofa in his frantic attempt to deduce his late night visitor. It was raining so the knocking was urgent. Not a client though, didn’t ring the bell, suggesting that it was someone who knew Sherlock would be awake but Mrs. Hudson would be sleeping. Then above the rain he heard the plaintive wail of a young child. The pieces slotted neatly into place as Sherlock whispered “Oh!”
“Molly insisted,” John replied. The two flat mates regarded each other for a moment before John shrugged, “Well?”
“He was so angry,” Sherlock says, wishing desperately for a cigarette, “I doubt he’ll ever fully forgive me.”
“You didn’t!” Violet accused, and was met with a telling silence. “You know he doesn’t like you interfering. Honestly Mycroft, you’ll drive the wedge between you even further!  You’ve recovered this information with subterfuge and all your little cameras haven’t you?”
“I know what I am,” John says, “I know what I did to you, and I will live with that for the rest of my life.  I can tell you I am sorry for it- because I am, but I can’t promise you it will never happen again. It should have never happened in the first place.”
Sherlock groans dramatically and leans back in the chair and looks up at the ceiling. “Uh, God no! I am not interested in a romantic relationship.”
Where even was he? John checked the posted schedule, but no buses were due any time soon, so when he saw a rare cab with its light on, John wondered if perhaps his luck might just hold out for one bloody night. He raised his hand, ears aching from Rosie’s hoarse cries and praised God when the black Prius rolled to a stop at the curb.
“You know, I was just thinking, maybe you could go in on a flat-share. It would be nice to have someone to help with the rent wouldn’t it?”
“I took the liberty of packing an emergency bag,” He said, and then seeing John’s gob smacked expression worried if maybe this counted as over stepping and tried to back pedal. “For Mrs. Hudson. You know, if we got caught up on a case or something… clothes might be too big, I wasn’t anticipating needing it so soon.”
Sherlock sometimes pretends the words that John swallows were the words he would have like them to be, but he knows better. Mycroft was right about so many things, Sherlock mused, watching John from the corner of his eye as he mixes spackle. Sentiment is a tremendous weakness. Hadn’t Mycroft proven that at Sherrinford? Sherlock had never once considered aiming the gun at John, had been willing to kill his own blood if he hadn’t been able to think his way out of it. But, looking at John now, in the soft rosy glow of the late afternoon sun streaming through new windows, Sherlock knows that he would do it again in a heartbeat.
Minutes like eternity pass and John’s mind is still reeling, little scraps of evidence floating to his consciousness- each time he’s noticed and then dismissed something, each aborted hope, each time he’s squashed down his errant thoughts of desire.  The two years he spent grieving- accepting that the gaping hole in his life would never be filled- and then the anger, the blinding rage that propelled him into one bad choice after another until this is where they stood, a door and a universe between them.
“This frenetic energy; throwing yourself into your work to avoid something that scares you. Only this time there are no serviettes to fold.”
Sherlock reached to flush the toilet with a shaking hand. John handed him the water and watched as Sherlock sipped carefully. Florida. Where he had met Mrs. Hudson all those years ago- of course, John realized belatedly, he was in rehab. Mycroft’s doing, probably. Cut him off from all familiar ties an ocean away.
“I don’t need a flat mate.”  Sherlock sniped. His voice was echoing, violet noticed, probably in a long hallway- from the echo she would guess the tile was lino. Not NSY- it was eerily quiet. NSY would be bustling and she’d overhear conversation.  Somewhere else then.
He hopes that the imperious summon will mask the terrible panic that is currently welling up in his chest. Instantly his mind palace offers him an array of senarios to explain why John hadn’t responded immediately the worst of these see John seated across a table with some simpering woman on a date, even though Sherlock knows that this is highly unlikely, given that Mrs. Hudson isn’t minding Watson tonight and that John has been reluctant as of yet to dive back into the dating arena.
Sherlock’s nose scrunches and he looks confused. John finds him adorable when he’s baffled, and where the hell did that thought come from?
Sherlock blinked rapidly, just as he had when John asked him to be his best man. Usually his brain was cacophony of sounds and thoughts- a mass transit hub, but now it was just the hum of white noise. He was glad he was sitting down because he had the strangest sensation of floating, like the ground had given way. John’s brow creased but he waited patiently.
Molly understands cats better than people, and for lack of a better analogy, Sherlock had been an arrogant and pampered cat before he went away for two years and before he lost his best friend to marriage and then watched Mary die and lost him a second time. Now he was acting like that cat who, after being stray for a long time, seemed repentant and starving for affection.
“Greg’s asked you to move in.” Sherlock announces, and realizes belatedly that it’s the first words he’s spoken aloud today. It’s obvious now, the brunette hair on his sleeve and the vague smell of formaldehyde.
Sherlock looks wrecked, John thinks guiltily as he watches his friend’s eyebrows lift in concern. Over the last few years he’s become quite adept at deductions himself. The shadows under Sherlock’s eyes indicate that he hasn’t slept much, as per usual. But, his hair is sticking out at all angles. He’s been thrusting his hands into it again, which he only does when he’s very agitated. He can’t keep still, even sitting and waiting for John to speak, his hands are fluttering, pulling at a fraying thread on his robe, Sherlock is buzzing with nervous energy,  but not like he’s been using again, thank God. John thinks Mycroft has secretly bugged the flat again. He shouldn’t have left this conversation so long. He should know by now that Sherlock Holmes left to his own devices for too long makes the man crazy.
“She knows what I like,” Sherlock says simply and looks at John under his eyelashes, a blush creeping onto those impossible cheekbones.
“Well that’s obviously out of the question,” John said, the idea of Sherlock leaving again turning him cold. Sherlock alone, in a miserably hot and humid American rehab facility, a thousand miles away while John was left to wait and worry, no, the thought was preposterous. “You’re in the middle of a case, yeah? And you’ve got friends here to help you through it.”
Sherlock nods. 'Three times. I'd had non-penetrative sex for about a year before that, though. How old were you the first time?'
'Fuck,' he mutters when Sherlock lowers himself and John slides all the way in until Sherlock's seated.
Now that was almost flirting, wasn't it? John slowly pushes the chair forward. When they reach the door, Sherlock leans forward to open it.
John blinks. There is a quick beep sound, repeated. His laptop doesn't normally make this kind of sound, but he does know it, he is sure. He blinks again, suppressing a yawn and straightening on his chair. Slowly, the tiredness sets him free and he spends a few seconds hating himself for having fallen asleep in the hospital. Well, nobody has noticed hopefully. Most certainly not Sherlock.
Sherlock's lips curl up in an amused smile. 'Worrying about cleaning?' he asks, not in a mocking way, though. 'I can explain you how to do it. Is that awkward? There are good guides online.'
He opens his mouth to say something, but she shakes her head. 'You don't even know him,' she says. 'Yet you keep mentioning him. Don't make me compete with a stranger, John. You know what? Don't call me again. Merry Christmas.' She storms off and John's left alone in midst the crowd.
A nurse arrives soon enough, the computer having called someone. Together, they work quickly, figuring out what exactly is wrong, what needs to be done and how. They have to be fast, but Sherlock will be in the stable position again. He will, John tells himself. And some day, he'll wake up. They just have to be quick and professional now.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. 'Fascinating. I've been dying to sit at the table instead of in the bed. Besides, I can't make my way to the toilet on my own yet.'
For quite a while it goes on like this. They're getting to know each other on another level. John learns how much he likes it when Sherlock kisses his neck and his slightly scrubby chin brushes over John's skin. After that, he discovers how he can make Sherlock gasp if he tugs at his hair. Biting his lip appears to be appreciated as well. John's hands roam over Sherlock's back, arse and shoulders, feeling his muscles work under the fabric of his shirt. He explores his mouth and takes in his scent when he presses his lips to Sherlock's jawline and neck.
John chuckled at Sherlock's obvious avoidance of the word 'sperm' and instead using the scientific term.
Harriet giggled at her father, grabbing her own plate and filling it up before adding a large portion of beans.
“A double chocolate with chocolate pieces muffin? Yes.” John smiles, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pulling him towards an experiment-free desk.
dull.” Sherlock replied, but that didn’t stop his hands from wandering over John’s body seductively.
“Sherlock Holmes! Honestly, teaching a thirteen year old how to blackmail people. You'll regret it.” Mrs Hudson warned, giving Sherlock a displeased look.
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson became good friends of mine and, with the help of Harriet herself, allowed me to write their story for you, dear readers.
Greg pulls away from the kerb and continues his hunt for the younger Holmes. Finally, eight drug dens later with a lead telling him were the younger man might be and Greg pulls up to the kerb of the shadiest den he's seen so far.
“I swore to myself I'd never let it get that bad again. Mycroft knew the state I was in and arrived in time to stop me. I made him give her his number, just in case.”
going to get me presents from different planets.” Harriet giggled, giving her dad a reassuring smile.
“Our daughter is going to be very mad with us. We'll have to find a way to make it up to her.” John continued, stroking Sherlock's hair.
“We are trying to find him, Sherlock. And Mrs Hudson is right, we don't leave our own behind.” Mycroft says calmly, his anger now hidden away under his mask of professionalism.
'Tell me everything you know so far,' Sherlock commands and Lestrade gives him a notepad. 'John, push me so I can focus on this.'
'Right here,' Lestrade says after two corridors, pointing at an open door. In a rather small room, there's a man, leaning against the wall. The eyes are open and a trail of dried blood runs from his mouth down his chin and neck. John doesn't see a big wound, nor is the shirt very soaked so it has to be either a wound on the back or just internal bleeding.
It is day three and now they have officially identified this as a coma. John stops by with his cup of coffee and a newspaper. Unsurprisingly, it is comfortably quiet in Sherlock's room.
For quite a while, nothing really changes, but John has long since figured that this Moriarty stuff has messed with Sherlock's brain and body. And well, coma patients don't all wake up normally anyway. Some stay in the coma for decades and then die. Some wake up after years. And almost half a year has passed when it gets really bad for Sherlock, worse than the last time.
Moaning softly, he puts his hands on Sherlock's arse to pull his hips down and feel his erection slide along his own. 'Sounds very good,' he says.
John takes a deep breath. 'You came to the hospital about one year ago,' John starts. 'With an ambulance. You had an overdose of a drug called “Moriarty” and after telling me about a killer and the victim's lymph knots you fell unconscious. That was the first time we met. I'm your doctor.'
'Don't go away,' he mumbles against John's lips and breaks away again. 'But don't call me stupid again. And put more sugar into my tea next time, while we're at it.'
When John slowly shakes his head, Sherlock looks disappointed but he wipes that expression off his face within a split second.
The novel of the mysterious ghost hound is the first that John reads aloud again. It's a good one, he feels like sharing it with Sherlock, having thought of him when he bought it. They watch telly together sometimes, Lestrade doesn't stop by very often anymore, but shoots John a text now and then. Peace returns. Or as peaceful as it could get with Sherlock still being in a god-damn coma.
'Is it good when I do it like this?' He scissors his fingers, stilling instantly when Sherlock clenches around them.
'You wanting to date me was what helped me through the whole thing with finding out everything had been a dream. It was one of the few good changes,' Sherlock says and tips his chin up.
'Am I allowed to eat this, Doctor?' Sherlock breaks the heavy silence and turns his menu, pointing at something. His tone is teasing.
'Like I imagined it,' Sherlock says and smiles, picking up his violin. 'How are you going to introduce me in your first blog post? Any way you can leave out my drug habits?'
John smirks and picks up a menu. 'I'm afraid internet research will have told you it's little things like these,' he mutters, skimming through the menu.
'You go and try to date your best friend who doesn't have the memories you thought you shared with them.'
'Oh, what's his name?' a certain nurse asks him when he tells her. She's the only one here he genuinely likes.
John remembers that Sherlock can't hear him because of the coma. Well, most likely can't hear him. 'Because I had a row in the shop with the chip and PIN machine,' he admits.
John mutters an apology and pays the cabbie as they stop. When he gets out of the cab and helps Sherlock into the wheelchair, the atmosphere is tense. Sherlock barely speaks until they're in his room.
The moment lasts too long for John to not feel the heat creep into his cheeks so he turns away and sits in the chair. 'You are officially allowed to leave the bed now, you know?'
Sally comes in suddenly and John tries to appear busy; checking this and that, taking the new bag with certain liquid she brought and replacing the old one.
John closes his eyes for a moment, considering jumping from the rooftop. 'Yes, yes, sorry for that,' he mumbles, but suddenly remembers Sherlock's excited “yes”. He looks at him and squints his eyes a bit. 'You were totally in for it,' he says incredulously. 'You thought we're best friends and nearly died together a couple of times and, and you were surprised by my terrible flirting but you…' John stops because Sherlock looks utterly mortified. 'Sorry,' he mutters again, stepping back.
'You're in no position to talk to me like that,' he mutters. She's a nurse after all. He's the doctor. And this is his Sherlock–has John really just thought that? He straightens. 'Mr Holmes woke up from his coma last night. I talked to him and as it appears, he was able to hear what happened around him and thus knows about his state.'
A sound of something hitting the floor. John blinks. There is the remote of the TV next to Sherlock's bed. It's switched off and the room is relatively dark. He groans and straightens in the chair. His whole body aching.
John gets the wrong thoughts, again. 'Let's find our cab,' he says which is a lame comeback but whatever.
'I'll rather take it with me then, I guess. All the other nurses and visitors, you know. I have to come here every day anyway.'
'You're planning to pay for me but let me stop you right there,' Sherlock says when John walks up to him on Wednesday. They're meeting in a small Italian restaurant, Sherlock's already sitting in a booth by the window.
'Naturally,' says the man with a roll of his eyes and falls back into a state of unconsciousness, though his eyes move behind his eyelids as if he's slipped back into a dream.
When John enters Sherlock's room Friday night, he's wearing nice clothes. Sherlock is not. Sherlock isn't wearing any clothes, to be precise.
When they arrive, Sherlock is much more awake again but Mrs Hudson isn't at home. Or she's sleeping. Nobody opens the door anyway.
'You're not just a friend, John, you're my best friend. But why would you hit on me?' Sherlock gives John a puzzled look.
In the week after, he sees Lestrade walking through the corridors and stops him. 'Do you know he's found out?' John asks without preamble.
'Yes,' Sherlock mutters, running his hands over John's chest. 'God, yes, I've dreamt about this too many times.'
'How did he react?' Mike asks curiously, ordering another set of beers for them. 'My money is on him hanging up.'
'But as I gathered,' Sherlock says when they break apart several minutes later, 'you used to talk to me a lot. In reality. You said you didn't just read out case files and novels but you told me about your day and thoughts. Considering that I showed no sign of understanding, you probably didn't fake anything. And you must have interacted with other people in my presence. Friends, girlfriends, colleagues, Mycroft, Lestrade… That should have given me a relatively broad spectrum and obviously, my vast intellect makes up for the fact I had no visual context.'
They quickly make their way to an elevator. Luckily, their cab is already waiting outside. Even if Sherlock didn't do anything himself, the short trip already exhausted him and he leans back and closes his eyes as the driver leaves the parking of the hospital.
'Obviously.' Sherlock pauses. 'I do admit that the extensive use of certain substances that could be called drugs might have had a hallucinating effect on me so that I perceived unimportant details slightly differently, but I'm getting better.'
He finishes as they're nearly back at the hospital. John's absolutely amazed. And he has to admit, he likes the version of them in that story. 'Your mind came up with all of that? That's–'
John laughs. 'Are you taking a cab?' he asks then and gets a nod for an answer. 'I'm taking the tube.'
'The victim's uncle. Goodness, John why are you so stupid today? Call Lestrade. If I'm right, you help me get out of here. If I'm wrong, you can go home. I'll bribe someone.'
They are five people standing around a hospital bed, talking about the man lying there and trying to ignore that their impromptu Christmas party seems a bit like a funeral. It's not because he could wake up anytime. He's breathing and alive, after all. But the conversations die out nevertheless eventually. Molly has to leave, the nurse does. Lestrade tells John how he got it sorted with his wife now, since she's cheated on him a while ago. John drinks away Sherlock's champagne and Jeanette eats the biscuit, he stops the music and puts the phone into his pocket. It's turning dark outside when they leave the hospital and head for the nearest tube station. It's snowing, so they rush.
'Fine, what juice do you want?' John is a bit irritated by Sherlock's childish behaviour. Perhaps he should overthink all of this.
“You're really breath-taking, you know that, right?” John asks softly, hovering over Sherlock; who's lying on John's bed.
“On the couch, of course not, baby. I'm going to take you to bed properly, treat you like a proper lady.”
Greg falls silent, he knows it's pointless to argue with Sherlock about this and he still has to address the issue of what Davies claimed.
"Yes, and you can have it when you're nineteen." Sherlock replied, eyeing the necklace carefully and placing it on the mantel.
“Challenge accepted.” John grinned, heading for the bedroom, slowly stripping off his jumper as he went.
"No.” The Doctor snapped, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the younger man. “I told you we can't. Now, I'll drop you off at home and you can wait three years to see Doctor Watson. Let's go."
be careful when you're near a Weeping Angel, the one I stumbled across sent me back to the year 1870.
Greg glares at Sherlock and calls him a dick; it's not the first time obviously, but at least this time Sherlock has the decency to look chastised and even apologises.
Sherlock and the Doctor disappear downstairs, when they reach the bottom, Sherlock turns to the Doctor.
'That what I first believed to be real, then turned out to be a dream caused by a high consummation of drugs, was in fact partly true but different in reality than what I thought? Yes, I am aware of that, John, and to piece it all together correctly, prove it to myself and move on I NEED TO GO TO MY FLAT.'
She looks at the monitor. 'Looks rather problematic,' she comments, not at all caring. It really is 'problematic' though, Sherlock's not exactly doing well. 'The finale's coming then?'
John stares at him and doesn't know if he should be in awe that Sherlock knows about Rosie or confused because his speech doesn't make any sense. 'That is my private life, Mr Holmes,' he manages in the end, voice tight.
'Has anything happened or did you spend hours goggling at his face again?' she asks sarcastically and studies the monitor.
Mike laughs again. 'Man, I didn't mean that time! I meant when you were hiding in a literal closet with him. To be fair, you were dead drunk.'
Sherlock is sitting in a wheelchair near the ticket counters, waiting. The wheels are small and there's a joystick on one armrest. John walks faster. It feels like he's the only Londoner here.
'What's this about?' Lestrade asks quietly while him and John observe Sherlock drive through the room at different speeds. 'You being here, I mean.'
Not stopping the kiss, John slips his fingers between his legs again, the other hand lying on the small of Sherlock's back. Sherlock moans into John's mouth when John carefully presses the tip of his digit into him. Slowly, he pushes his finger further until it's as far in as possible.
'I know,' Sherlock says. He dips his head down to peck John's lips. 'You've never had sex with a man and I've never been this much–' He stops himself and frowns. 'You're important,' he says then and John knows what Sherlock means. Best friend. Love interest. Adventure companion. And Doctor, stupidly.
John grumbles, turning in Sherlock's back. The TV is still on and there is a woman's voice, music and moans. He opens his eyes. 'What woman?'
'I need to call Lestrade. No, I need to see him,' he says after the drinking, glancing around the room.
It's heavy and deep, hands are running over backs, chests and arses, pulling slightly at hair. John's lying on top of Sherlock on the sofa eventually, enjoying the easy slide of tongues.
John gives him a look. 'New to going on dates with men. Hence the awful flirting.' He feels his pulse going fast after he's made it clear he considers this a date.
He returns to him. 'No, I'm not,' he says softly. Why would he be angry at a patient for spilling some water?! 'I don't approve of the drugs, though.'
'John?' he says, smile growing now and his voice is that quiet, dark rumble that John… fell in love with? No! Came to love? No, no. Not gonna use the L-Word. Likes? Yeah… well, more than “like” though. Adores? Hm. Sherlock's deep voice is perfect and that's what it is. Also, John's attention is drawn to his lips and those are perfect as well. What would ensue now is some waxing about the cupid bow and the shape of the lower lip as well, but Sherlock has in fact more asked than said John's name so he looks to the (perfect) eyes again.
It's him. It's Sherlock. It's definitely him. It's his face, his hair, those cheekbones and he's sleeping. Is he? John doesn't dare to wonder if this is a normal sleep. If he'll wake up in the next few hours, if he could wake him up by shaking him. Next to his bed is a monitor, and there in Sherlock's hand is an envelope with John's name, inside a piece of paper with two words.
'No wallet or phone. He's been unresponsive since we fetched him at St Paul's. Civilian called,' the paramedic says and looks at John. 'Can you take over?'
She chuckles. 'We've all seen how you looked at that Sherlock Holmes back then. You'd have asked him out, had he ever woken up.'
John grins. Without really thinking about it, he reaches out and put his hand on Sherlock's cheek. He turns his head and shifts closer. The scowl is wiped off Sherlock's face just like that and instead his eyes widen a little as John leans in. His lips part a bit and they look even better from this up close, John thinks. He doesn't allow himself to stop and get all too self-conscious or nervous. In the next split second, Sherlock is tipping his face up and the last inch of distance is being closed.
Sherlock asks more questions and slowly, John gets an idea of what his dream has been like. He kind of wishes it could have been the truth. They order food eventually and John makes Sherlock eat something as they keep talking. It's amazing how Sherlock stays this calm and attentive. His whole world is out of joint.
'I'll bring “Casablanca” next week. We might need to watch it on my laptop if your TV doesn't have a DVD player.' He sighs. 'Pity you can't see anything.'
'Someone under the influence of the drug broke into the Tower of London in an attempt to steal the crown jewels,' John tells Sherlock on a rainy day in February. 'The guy danced, and then actually managed to break the glass with a diamond and a fire extinguisher, Mycroft said. When police arrived he just said there and told them 'not to rush'. They call it the Royal Drug now. It's special, I don't know how exactly, but it opens you up in new ways or whatever. As if your brain is a world full of locked doors…'
Again, John smiles. 'Yes. Okay. I'm your friend,' he says because Sherlock looks strangely lost. John straightens then. 'Let's eat and get you back to the hospital before anyone notices you're gone.'
'He's indeed over the moon to hear that you're awake,' John informs Sherlock after anding the call. 'He'll come by tomorrow.'
Sherlock thinks for a moment. 'I was attracted right away,' he says, 'and I really wanted to be friends with you. But I didn't dare hope for more, especially not as you went out with one woman after the other. I think I was still in denial of my jealousy the first time we celebrated Christmas together but I accepted it eventually. Then I needed to fake my own death and when I returned, I interrupted your proposal to Mary.' There's a faint smile playing on his lips. 'You asked me to be your best man once you were done being angry with me.'
His first destination is the coffee vending machine. Ah, elixir of heaven. John gulps down all of it before he even reaches the right floor to start his shift. It's a dull day at work, a particularly exhausting but dull and tiring day and the only person not complaining is Sherlock but then again, he never does. Sometimes, John wishes he would.
He looks away, a little nervous suddenly. He wanted to ask the question later. 'So, er … listen, um…' Calm down Watson, he tells himself off, you're not proposing or so, you're just asking if she'd like to move in with you. 'I know it hasn't been long, but … if you see me almost every day now, I moved into a bigger flat, so could you imagine… um, could you see your way to…'
After a whole month, John goes to look for Sherlock but he's gone. When he asks someone, they tell him that Sherlock's been transported to his parents' house. He probably has a personal nurse there, doing the physiotherapy with him.
John helps him into it. He's brought the wheelchair right away so he pushed it next to the bed and lifts Sherlock by reaching around his torso. This time, Sherlock clutches onto him and feels less limp in John's arms. John's weirdly conscious of every place where they touch, especially when Sherlock's thigh presses against John's crotch. Now John is almost sure he's bisexual.
Surprised by that suggestion and Sherlock's sudden use of the crude words, it takes John several moments to realise Sherlock had merely meant to put John off his stride. He huffs a laugh. 'Not what you imagined the glorious first time with John Hamish Watson to be like,' he tosses back before thinking. Crazy how they can joke about it like this.
Sherlock groans. 'I didn't have much material to go by, especially not considering my brain was only hearing you, not seeing anything. Besides, it was years ago!'
It is John's turn to sigh then, getting up as well. A bit later, he goes home and the next day, today, is his day off so he stays at home. The small, dark flat is downright depressing.
'I'm thinking about giving him an MP3-Player for Christmas. Or rather a radio?' John jokes as he grabs his walking stick.
Sherlock shrugs. 'Physiotherapy is going well. I can walk for short distances but it's exhausting.' He pauses. 'Mycroft made me go to a psychotherapist. She disapproves of my affinity for murder. It's tedious.'
Sherlock gives him a small, sad smile. 'I'm sorry,' he says with a small smile. 'Did you actually have an appalling moustache?'
It doesn't take long. John is louder than Sherlock indeed, and when the waves of pleasure ebb away, he pulls out and rolls off Sherlock. He turns his head after a minute or to look at him, grinning exhaustedly.
'You're rather concerned, Dr Watson,' Mycroft Holmes interrupts the steady flow of facts that comes out of John's mouth.
'What? …oi, Dr Watson, you don't need to – there are competent people in there taking care of the junkie. It's covered, you can go home.'
It takes the detective in the book awfully long to get a single hint and John rants how even he has understood more. His gaze falls on Sherlock's calm expression as he talks and he loses track of the initial topic. Instead he asks him questions about his consulting detective work. It really is ridiculous so he stops after a while and instead just imagines going on a case with Sherlock. Chasing criminals through London.
So John does, quickly changing Sherlock into the pants and the suit he's found. It's true, he does see naked patients often enough and he has the medical view on it. In the hospital, for him as a doctor, it's just another part of someone's body. Even if he's had brief thoughts about asking this particular patient out.
'Maybe I'll introduce you to the joy of having a cock up your arse,' Sherlock whispers when he breaks away. 'Pressing over your prostrate with every single thrust.' He highlights the last three words with a grind of his hips each.
John wonders if Sherlock still wants his number but he doesn't dare to ask so he just nods and turns to leave. None of the two says another word.
John doesn't look at Sherlock and puts the blazer aside. It'd be the work for a nurse to change Sherlock's clothes. 'Am I calling you “Mr Holmes”?' he asks.
'And you call your therapist ridiculous?' John asks after reading it. He can't help but snicker. 'Or are you just doing this to piss her off?'
Sherlock carefully slides out of his wheelchair, kneeling on the floor by the victim's feet. From a pocket he draws a small magnifying glass and examines the soles of the old trainers. He lifts the hem of the jeans to take a sniff before waving at John, giving him the sign to come over.
Mycroft becomes serious again. 'It's a new mixture called “Moriarty”. The dealer who sold it to Sherlock is a certain Bruce Partington, but the origin isn't clear. I'll have them found and imprisoned, don't you worry.'
'Last time, I ran away all by myself to talk to a master blackmailer. And I was more dead than alive. So you better stay with me this time, don't you think?'
She stares at him. Around them, people rush for an arriving train. 'You know, my friends are wrong about you.'
Suppressing a flash of doubt in the Special Moment™ and a sigh, John gets up and walks over to the open plan kitchen. He ignores all the weird things (that thing swimming in the half-filled cup of coffee looks suspiciously like an eyeball) and grabs the opened envelope. After returning to the sofa, he leans against the backrest from the backside. Sherlock looks up at him, a bit excitedly but also like there's a silly booby trap inside the envelope. John takes out a sheet of paper and unfolds it. He feels Sherlock's eyes on him as he reads the title.
The desk is a small one in a large room with many others. It's half eight pm now, so nobody is here right now apart from a caretaker and a manager. In the victim's wallet was an ID, now on the desks there are plaques with names. Sherlock pushes the chair away and rolls his wheelchair there instead. But instead of looking into the drawers, he just sits right in front of the computer and looks out over the room. Then, he checks the position of keyboard, mouse and screen and corrects his own.
'That's good,' Sherlock says. 'I suppose, I'm five years ahead of you. Well, I thought it was five years.' He swallows, watching John with uncertainty in his expression. 'I duly apologise for ruining the mood.'
It's late when he leaves. They've talked some more, kissed some more. To be honest, when they were kissing in the hallway next to the door, John was close to asking Sherlock if he could just stay the night, but then Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and told John to bring milk, cucumbers and curry next time.
Sherlock pokes him. 'I thought you were going to fall asleep,' he complains. 'Must you always have the last word?'
John grins, closing the door of the cab and leaning back in the seat. 'It's nice to know something you don't.'
'It. I… I meant the sex,' John forces himself to say. He feels guilty and stupid. 'But I…' Is he in love? Already?
'Doctor Watson?' He glances aside to see the nurse that's been running in and out of that room next to Mary and him. 'About this new patient, could you come and have a look for a moment.'
Sherlock's smile is proud, like a child who has tied their shoe laces for the first time. 'Thank you for not making this too awkward,' Sherlock says and the words “thank you” seems strange on his lips. It's the second time he's said it to John now.
She would know, Sherlock assumes, it’s been nearly a year since she called off her engagement to Tom. But Molly had cats. Her nurturing side has ensured she hasn’t ever really lived alone. Molly pretends to be busy wiping up the counters but Sherlock knows she’s just stalling while she puzzles out how to phrase what she wants to say next. She had better not suggest he get a cat.
A small smile unconsciously forms on Sherlock's lips before it vanishes with the remembrance of what's happened.
"Don't worry 'bout it, you've said before that Friday is when all the drunk buggers come in to sober up. Tomorrow will be fine and I'll tell Tisha. You get some sleep and be ready for an all-night party tomorrow!" Amy replies, understandingly.
I'm going to apologise in advance for the next chapter and say, I turned into Moffat and Gatiss' evil little love child with the next one.
Sherlock stumbles as John pulls him up, his limbs still heavy and numb. John guides Sherlock into the shower, leaning him against the wall as he grabs shampoo/conditioner and soap to clean up his boyfriend with.
fucked, but we didn't. God, I wasted some good shit on you as well.” Davies sighs, sitting up in the dingy bed.
“Not til I get what I want.” Davies growls dangerously and Sherlock realises he's made a very fatal error.
"Okay. Yes, I'd like to go back in time. And dare I say it, to see you being born again as that was the second best day of my life."
John kisses Sherlock's curls and runs his hand up his boyfriend's back, settling it into Sherlock's hair.
“I'll have to stretch you out first, so you'll have to be patient, okay.” John says gently, reaching over to grab some lube from their bedside table.
The blow to his head is serious and the knife sliced through a main artery in John's chest, meaning he doesn't have long to live.
“Urg, Mycroft is making out with Lestrade!” Sherlock growls, snapping his head back towards the door and allowing John to drag him out.
“I just don't want you to regret this, John.” Sherlock whispers sadly, resting his hands on John's hips.
to blackmail people for stuff. No sexual tension there, Sherlock.” John replied, glaring at his partner.
Needless to say, I was the one who washed the blood stains out of his clothes that night; it wouldn't have been right to frighten our poor landlady to death.
“Someone was taking notes ... when I gave him a blow job, wasn't he?” John moans, recognising his own technique.
Can I first just apologise for my absence, real life tends to get in the way AND I have a new job - yay. On the up side only two chapters left after this guys (I'm adding a final one given where this is heading) and I've already started the next chapter after this :) xxxx
“They're perfect together. And you know it. No one puts up with Sherlock like John does. And John totally fancies Sherlock, no matter how many times he denies it.”
“The girl will 'grow up' eventually but whereas humans age day by day, for vampires it can take hundreds of years to look any older. And yes, I was a child once and now I'm a vampire but that's all I'm saying on the matter.”
"I will. I promise. And I love you too, John." Sherlock replied softly, bringing John into his arms and hugging him tight.
I smile at him softly, to be honest, I thought he'd forgot about the necklace too but maybe that was wishful thinking.
John spluttered on his drink and tried to process what she meant, because he hoped it didn't mean what he thought it did.
There's a pause as both men process this, of course their other halves have unofficially dubbed them as boyfriends but officially, well ...
. But there's not even a single drop of blood and with Sherlock's sensitive sense of smell, the common household bleach used to clean up is making his nose itch and his eyes burn.
He giggles at the memory, then he suddenly grabs me and kisses me while I laugh; its unexpected but not entirely unpleasant.
"Sounds just perfect, Sherlock." John pulled Sherlock in for another kiss, his hand still in the detective's hair.
He gives me a grateful smile and I can't help but preen under the praise; not that I'd ever let Lestrade or John see how much I like it, of course.
Maggie yawns and stretches, looking over at her alarm clock before giving it a glare as it flashes 6:30am.
“What does it mean 'missing in action', Mycroft? How can he be missing?” Sherlock asks desperately, re-reading the file in the hopes it will say something different.
Sherlock's eyes snap open and he rolls over, falling straight out of bed and narrowly missing smashing his head on the bedside table.
The Doctor rushed to the doors, turning to look back at Sherlock expectantly and the younger man didn't disappoint.
“I know, Mrs Hudson. But the wound sliced a main artery, he'll be dead before they get him ready for surgery.”
John lunges for Sherlock and pins him on his back on the couch, driving his teeth into Sherlock's neck and drinking his fill.
“Just remember, you're not the only one who can be manipulative.” John grinned back, pulling his partner towards their bedroom.
That was the first story my father told me of the Doctor but it was certainly not the last, for the Doctor kept popping into our lives for a very long time.
When he took his companions to the past, they wanted to change it and when he took them to their future, they wanted to live it. Why didn't he just leave it alone?
“Sher, what have I told you about playing with your food? She is very pretty though, darling.” An older blonde man says softly, dropping down off the shed roof.
Sherlock applies enough pressure to Mr Cambria's throat that he struggles to breathe before he passes out.
“John Watson. Your boyfriend is a twisted boy and I insist you do something about it.” Kate seethes, storming past the teen.
Premature greyness in his early thirties and he's pretty sure between the Holmes boys and John Watson, they're the route of it all.
“Are you up for a little faster, John?” Sherlock whispered into John’s ear in a husky and seductive voice.
But now at seventeen, John drags Sherlock to a Christmas house party and the boys end up under the mistletoe.
“Don't think you're off the hook either, young lady. You should know better.” John called from the kitchen.
“Hey! It's alright, ya know. I understand, he's an attractive guy and you're worried people are gonna notice.” Greg shrugs, swigging back his drink.
The Doctor stood and headed for the TARDIS, watching as future Sherlock turned and walked the opposite way up the street.
"You know, I remember a time when you wouldn't partake in sexual activity. Now, you're as horny as a teenager." John smirked.
She considers ringing Mycroft but decides against it. She knows why he wants to turn him; not just to save his life today or even to stop him dying of an injury in the future, the poor vampire is in love with the good doctor and wants to keep him forever.
"Bloody hell, John." Sherlock gasped, gripping John's hair. "Now I know why they call you 'Three Continents Watson'."
Harriet looked around at her presents and spotted one from their old friend; the Doctor. She picked it up and ripped off the wrapping paper, wondering what he had got for her this time.
She climbs out of bed and heads downstairs, looking forward to a nice cup of tea and some breakfast.
“You too.” John smiles, moving back over to his bedside table. “Have you finished in the bathroom, I'm gonna do my make up.”
"Actually, it's Captain Watson to you." John quirked an eyebrow and began unzipping Sherlock's jeans.
Greg stops short of the door at the sight of the two of them and smiles, his own partner stopping beside him and gently finding his hand, linking their fingers together.
“We don't intend to get caught.” Mr Cambria laughs, dropping John's head back down. “That's why we have to get rid of you.”
Maggie turns down the next street, debating whether to get chips for tea or just have some toast when she gets in.
He slides it from his shoulders and pulls away to drop the shirt onto the floor, Sherlock already starting on the buttons of his jeans and sitting up to pull them off.
John chuckles to himself as he makes his way towards the science lab, ready to drag Sherlock out in order to preserve his and
Maggie pulls out her phone and is just about to dial when the man grabs the phone and throws it at the wall, smashing it to pieces before shrinking back into a corner.
“Piss off. You got what you wanted, now go back to your little slut of a girlfriend and pretend you're not gay.” Sherlock snaps, pulling away from the man and getting dressed.
“Besides, we're young, right. I mean, I'm seventeen and you're eighteen. Who knows where we'll be in ten years time.” John adds, summoning the waitress to get a muffin.
They walk back to their room in silence, Sherlock stamping and fuming all the way while John just walks slowly behind him, determined not to let the whole of college see their little
“Don’t worry, she has some of your mannerisms and traits as well. Like her God-awful taste in jumpers and even a limp.” Sherlock grinned over the newspaper he was reading.
"I know it's not. And we don't have to argue, Sherlock. You could just try having an interest in our daughter. Oh, Sherlock, I love you, I really do and I'd never want to change you. But please, just try."
Unfortunately, that's the worst mistake the pair make because as soon as Sherlock steps outside, a figure appears in the darkened hallway outside the bedroom.
We started solving crimes together and I'd blog about them while we slowly became friends and ran around the city like mad men; it was good, fun even.
“Well, you’re eager this morning.” John grinned, running his nails up Sherlock’s sides as the detective straddled him.
“You know, Dad. They help me out and I help them. It's like this, they give me certain presents and I
"Hey! Don't talk to me like that! I only asked a question. I don't actually come across vampires every day. Like you said, 'You don't get seen. Normally'." Maggie replies, not willing to be talked to like a child.
Of course, he was a complete arse when Mike first introduced us, but he was clever and mysterious, and quite amazing with his deductions; even if they were personal to me.
Sherlock moans a little as John massages his hair gently in soothing circles. He'd always imagined this; seeing John naked and dripping with water. He moans again at the mental image and has to rest his hands on the shower wall.
“I'm sorry, John. I … I thought you were dead. I … I just … I couldn't cope.” Sherlock sobs, the shudders shaking his small frame.
“How about a little eye-liner then? Or some blusher?” John grins wider, watching his friend's face through the mirror.
Sorry about the wait with this one guys. I've been a bit busy. But here it is now. I thought I'd be a little sappy because why the hell not xxxxx
“I thought you might like it.” Sherlock grins back, running his fingers down John's chest and to his cock.
He smiled and walked over to the couch, gently lifting Sherlock's head and placing it on his lap as he sat down.
He soon gets impatient and throws Sherlock onto his back, driving his tongue into his mouth as Sherlock moans.
“Well, after breakfast you can open your presents, then I've invited some of your friends around for a party. They can sleep over too, if you want.”
Harriet knocked gently on Mrs Hudson's door, smiling gratefully when she opened the door and ushered the girl in.
Maggie laughs softly at the vampire, wondering what exactly his brother has done for Sherlock to dislike him so much.
“Patience, love.” John whispers, stroking Sherlock's chest. “Let's take this slow, shall we? Enjoy our time together while we can.”
Greg grins as John walks into the café looking a little mussed and ruffled; no doubt thanks to Sherlock's new found libido. He was definitely going to give the younger lad stick for not properly checking himself over this morning. And of course, he'd take credit for him and Sherlock finally getting it on, he did instigate their first kiss after all.
That was why he was stood in the graveyard watching John and Mrs Hudson mourn his death. He smiled sadly as Mrs Hudson recalled his atrocious habits in explanation as to why John was angry.
“Mycroft! Don't hurt him! Granted, he deserves a good slap but have some self-control.” Greg orders, grabbing Mycroft's arm.
He rolls his eyes when he gets to the top of them, walking down the hall and into the bedroom he hasn't stepped foot in in over ten years.
” Sherlock's voice cracks as John's tongue runs from his collar bone up his neck and to his ear teasingly.
He's spent two years wishing he could fix the broken heart of his little brother and bring John back home. Little does Sherlock know but Mycroft has sent in practically every (un)known operative to find John and his troop; unofficially of course.
“I'll be waiting.” Mycroft whispers, his tone still suggestive as his hand touches Greg's waist and moves down lower.
“No, thank you, my love. Thank you for letting me do this and thank you for saving my life in so many ways.”
“Listen, I'm sorry that I was hitting on your husband and I'm sorry that your niece was kidnapped. I'm guessing you got her back?” Maggie asks softly, hoping to diffuse the situation.
Sherlock hums before gently scraping his teeth over the sensitive head and the moan John makes has probably woken up their classmates in the other rooms but neither teen cares right now.
“Stop worrying, Dad. I promise from now on, I'll only use my powers of evil for good reasons.” Harriet grinned, proving she was getting more like her father every day.
“John, I can hardly help it if I was born with naturally pale skin.” Sherlock replies indignantly, following his friend into the bathroom.
He lunges at John with a knife but of course, I'm too quick and step in front of him. I feel the pain as the knife makes contact but all that matters right now is that my John is safe.
Sherlock threw the newspaper down and sprinted after John, slamming the bedroom door shut after him.
“You're so beautiful, Sherlock.” John whispers into his boyfriend's lips, cupping his face in his hands.
John smiles softly, pulling away from Sherlock and bringing his hand up to his face. His tongue darts out to lick experimentally at his fingers, causing Sherlock to moan loudly.
“I dunno, maybe. I mean, everyone goes through boyfriends and girlfriends throughout their life. What's the point in thinking that far ahead? Shit, I'm seventeen and don't even know if I'm set on going to uni yet, never mind thinking about what I'll be doing in ten years.”
Sherlock hadn't dared say anymore to him, he sensed that this man was very dangerous and he didn't want to make him angry.
“There. Perfect. Just remember to have a shower when we get back, that way your hair won't get knotted up.” John replies sweetly, running his hands under the hot water.
. I did weed at the last party I was at. Tobacco ain't exactly high on the illegal drugs list.” John replies mockingly, kicking Greg in the shin.
Sherlock hears the front door close and collapses to the floor; tears burning his eyes as he drops his head into his lap and, for the first time in years, actually cries.
He's committed every act of treason from the very beginning, just to help his little brother, even the biggest crime of all; telling his partner
'I was thinking of starting with the Serial Suicides and the cabbie. Mike Stamford introducing us to each other, the first case.'
His eyes fall on the newest case file. Greg left it here just yesterday and John hasn't opened it yet. 'How about you stay in bed and take a look at this? That's the file Greg brought.'
just isn't working out and you want us to go our separate ways?” Greg shouts back, his voice breaking at the end.
“For the love of God, here we go again.” Harriet sighed dramatically, dropping her head in her hands. “I'll go see Mrs H while you sort out your unresolved
John smiles softly and grabs the muffin, breaking a piece off and holding it to his boyfriend's lips. Sherlock takes it between his lips and uses his tongue to slip the piece of muffin and John's finger into his mouth.
“You need to ring an ambulance, dear. He's bleeding out too much, if you don't call soon, he'll die, Sherlock.”
“Ah, your decision, not mine. I’d quite happily pound you into the mattress right now but, you said we have to think of our daughter.”
John finally gives in and starts to suck his boyfriend off with slow, long strokes, making sure to lick the underside. Sherlock's hands bury themselves in his boyfriend's hair, gripping tightly as he thrusts into his mouth.
further? Which is fine, we can … just forget about, whatever this was. I'm okay with that.” John whispers awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Sherlock? Shit, I'm on fire. I feel like my head's about to explode.” John replies, blood dripping down his chin.
“Shit, does it always feel that good?” Sherlock asks in wonder as his body twitches from over-sensitivity.
“Ya know, it’s such a turn on when you do that wicked smile.” John smiled, running his hand down Sherlock’s chest and down to his crotch.
Sherlock sighed and ran his hand through John's short blonde hair; for once thinking about what to say.
“Okay.” Sherlock replied, speeding up and making each thrust harder and harder; causing the doctor to moan louder with each thrust.
“Are you going deaf or do you just have selective hearing?” John chuckles, the vibrations humming through Sherlock's body.
"Are you saying that I would make something like that up? Is that why they call you 'Three Continents Watson'?"
So it only stands to reason that Sherlock would have the great idea of teaching his daughter the art
The older teen smiles and moves his hand faster, moaning softly into his friend's lips happily. Sherlock's continuous moans encourage him to go even faster and in a few minutes John feels Sherlock spasm as he comes in John's hand.
"Harriet Hamish Holmes-Watson. Sit down, otherwise I'll take your telescope away." Sherlock shouted.
“We still have time. You can do a lot in six days.” John smirks suggestively, sliding onto the bed to sit behind his boyfriend.
This is set right after the last chapter so Harriet is still eleven (I changed her age, just because lol). And she still has to be taken to school because it’s miles away (just go with it) xxxxx
Suddenly, the door bursts open and there stands Anthea, looking every bit as worn and tired as the three men, gasping for air as her long hair fights to free itself from its hair tie.
It was the first time John had lost his temper so badly and it caused Harriet to jump and move away.
John doesn't receive a response and he gets an overwhelming feeling that Sherlock has zoned him out so he can focus solely on giving him pleasure.
“Sherlock, sorry, I dropped a plate. You’d think with me being a waitress I’d be a little less clumsy but you know. Anyway she kicked me out the kitchen …” Maggie rambles causing Sherlock to smile at her.
“You look fucking gorgeous when you're so into your work.” John comments, seeing his boyfriend practically poured over an experiment involving; what he hopes, are
“Lift your legs up a bit, it will feel better.” John says, gently guiding Sherlock's legs up into a bending position.
Sherlock pulled off just long enough to reply, “Mrs Hudson will keep her company. And if you hurry, I can finish you off faster before you help me.”
“You told me you are a doctor. A doctor of what? John is an army doctor.” Sherlock replied proudly, a smug smile gracing his features.
He looks back up and replies, “I know there are things you're never going to be able to tell me, matters of national security and everything. But things concerning your brother, that's different, Myc.”
So Sherlock followed that mad man into his time machine, wanting to see what the future held for himself and his blogger.
He quickly heads back into the flat and dumps the bags onto the kitchen table, pulling off his shirt as he enters the bedroom.
They continued to watch as future Sherlock suddenly runs down the steps and hides in the doorway of Speedy's cafe.
“What? Seriously? But Mycroft could face a death sentence for treason.” John breathes, immensely worried for his friend.
Minutes later and John is coming with tears in his eyes, so privileged that he has this beautiful and amazing boy in his life.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson. At least someone else agrees with me.” John replied, pointedly looking at his partner.
“Wait, Black Ops? Don't you only rescue people of importance?” John asks warily, having to shout over the sound of the propellers.
“Christ, my daughter is blackmailing people for money.” John sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair.
"I'll ring an ambulance and tell them what's happened. Do you know how much blood you've lost? I think you'll need a blood transfusion."
Sherlock pulled out and thrust into the doctor harder, making John’s hips rise of the bed and a loud moan to escape his lips.
Sherlock smiled and helped John pick up the shopping bags, practically bouncing up the steps to their home.
“I told you, I don't do that. And you weren't complaining when I was sucking your cock, were you, arsehole?”
So, it's the morning after and John still can't believe what happened between himself and his best friend.
Sherlock smiled in satisfaction, standing up and crowding John into the corner; the older man reaching out to help Sherlock with his own issue.
“I love it when you talk like that.” Sherlock purrs, sliding back down his boyfriend's body and getting back to what he started.
Sherlock crawls back up John's body as the older teen shuts his eyes and turns his head away, determined not to embarrass Sherlock.
, saying that in a well-to-do place like this at such an early hour.” John replies, raising his voice so the nosey old biddy can hear him before breaking into giggles.
Greg backs up slowly, turning around to go find Mycroft Holmes; hoping to kiss him properly this time.
It's been two months since I moved into Baker Street now, and from that very first moment it was hard to deny there was some chemistry between us.
? Never mind, where's my converse?” Sherlock asks, shaking his head and searching around their room for his shoes.
Mycroft is ready to argue with his brother until Sherlock moans loudly and he sees John's hand descending south on his brother's body.
John stepped into his partner's personal space and roughly grabbed his chin, causing Sherlock to shiver.
"Don't be obtuse, John." Sherlock cried, bouncing up into a sitting position next to John. "You are one of the most attractive men I've ever met, and truth be told, I did have feelings for you from the day we met. I just couldn't comprehend what they were."
John’s hands moved from Sherlock’s sides to his back and he scraped his nails down, causing red scratches that made his skin look even paler in comparison.
“What? I don't want to end this. I love you, Sherlock. I was always planning on going in the army but that doesn't mean I want to break up with you.”
“Back home with Mycroft and Greg. She has a few cuts and bruises but nothing that won't heal within a few days.”
So against my better judgement after re-reading the last chapter I decided to start the next chapter, despite having around four other stories on the go. I wrote this 6.30am, after being up all night and only just managing to finish one chapter for one story but I've only just got round to uploading it here (apologies, it's about two weeks old now). But anyway, I’ve always considered morning sex; too much info, I know but let me continue – so after re-reading the last chapter I decided, well, morning sex, that should be fun. So I guess I kinda used my own life experience prompt ;) hehe. So yeah, enjoy, johnlock morning sex and then maybe later on I’ll do experimenting with food ;) if you’re all good xxxx
“You mean the British Government can't find six British soldiers?! Then what bloody good are you?!” Sherlock yells, throwing the folder at Mycroft.
Sherlock brings his other hand up to the back of John's neck as the older teen's tongue runs teasingly across Sherlock's lips. The younger teen opens his mouth and allows John's tongue to roam his mouth; causing them both to moan softly.
But today something changes, Sherlock makes a tactless comment about Greg's relationship with his wife. He deduces that Greg has already started looking else where because he's tired of trying to save the sinking ship of his marriage when his wife clearly wants something else.
“If it's with the right person, yeah.” John breathes, laughing softly at the fact that he's just had amazing sex with his best friend.
He stripped the detective of his jeans and boxers but before he could go any further, Sherlock dragged him up by his jumper and kissed him passionately. Then he roughly pulled off the jumper and t-shirt in one, throwing them across the room.
“Very well, brother mine, I shall be round tomorrow. Blood is in Mrs Hudson's fridge. Be sure to get it before she returns, she might turn utterly monstrous otherwise.”
Don't worry, this wasn't inspired by the song by 3OH!3 ft Ke$ha (just in case you thought it was ;)) xxxxx
"Are you okay?" Maggie asks again, kneeling down by his side and placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
