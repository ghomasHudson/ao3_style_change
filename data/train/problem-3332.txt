“Dean,” Castiel grunts. He grips his hands around the firm muscles of Dean’s thighs on either side of him just to have something to hold on to. They flex under his fingers.
“Alright,” she says softly and grabs his hand to squeeze it. Then, as if in parting thought, she nods her head towards the service window. “Sounds like a Swan’s coming through. If it ends up being Eileen, tell her that we have fresh honeycomb from the Linden apiary.”
Castiel waits for their shock, and instead gets two matching placated expressions. Perhaps the men were related to each other. That makes the nearly identical plaid shirts even weirder.
“Do you know what set you off?” Dean hedges.
He bristles at Dean’s tone but turns around anyway, dragging his eyes off of the bees.
“Mmm,” Dean’s hum is a rumbling. “‘s good. Don’t stop.”
It’s actually not about crying in front of people in a bad way at all… but that maybe, sometimes, crying can feel so good that he wants to do it alone.
They end up out on Cas’s usual lunch spot, and Dean finally drops Castiel’s hand in favor of reaching for his belt. Frozen, Castiel watches the deft movement of Dean’s fingers. Big delicate hands. When the belt gets thrown to the ground and Dean starts in on the button, Cas looks away blushing, and busies himself by undoing his own pants. They undress together in silence until they both stand barefoot in only their shirts and dirty boxers with their shoes and jeans in piles next to them. Castiel wiggles his toes in the soft ground and wonders what to do next.
“I… don’t understand,” Cas responds with worried apprehension.
Because he thinks about Eileen, and the way she had patiently shown him how to execute the proper hand movements to sign an order for honey, even if it is just hers, so that he can communicate with her when she comes by for her Linden.
Castiel grips his own erection harder. “
When Castiel fucks back into Dean just as achingly slow, a whine gets caught on the inside of his teeth. He clenches his jaw. That same wild thing from all those nights ago raises its head. It’s too much, too much, the heat.
Because Castiel is the most dangerous person in this bar, and he’s here talking to Dean in a tender voice about a guy who lost his pieces.
It seems to help, because Dean clears his throat and says, “
“I want-” Castiel gulps, “I want to spoil you. I want every cell in your body to recognize me on the most unconscious of levels, and know that my presence means something wonderful is going to happen. Something that makes you feel good in one way or another.”
“Absolutely,” Dean agrees. He can feel Anna’s eyes on him from where she stands in the background of the stall. “Oh! And, uh, speaking of delicious things…” Dean’s tongue pokes out between his lips in concentration as he fishes around in the pocket of his pants. His fingers close around the little honey stick and he pulls it out to set it on the stall’s serving counter. “This was definitely my favorite- uh- varietal, right?”
Castiel learns that the location of the witches they killed was three hours away from wherever the brothers are usually stationed. This is, apparently, a very short drive for the men, and despite the panic that the memory spell induced at first they seem to be in good spirits.
“Sure,” Eileen says, and points to the makeup bag at her feet.
“Oh god.” Dean tries to take another impossibly shuffling step that gets him nowhere. “Cas, will you please get these pants off me before I just do it myself?”
There’s a hand, Cas’s other hand, in his hair now. It pets through the strands in one broad motion that makes Dean look up. Their eyes meet. Cas looks into him. His head tilts to the side while his eyebrows pull up in a considering softness that’s so potent it turns almost hurtful. Cas stares.
Now that Dean knows Cas’s not-so-secret secret, it’s like he notices the angel on his phone constantly. Always turned horizontal, always with his earbuds in, always with a sleepy look on his face.
Even though everyone is relieved of kitchen duty, the three other members of the Bunker stay seated at the now clean table, nursing drinks as Sam explains whatever his show of the week is. From what Dean picks out, it has something to do with architecture.
“First, you have to get out all the ingredients. It’s good to see what you’re working with when you’re cooking. If I don’t have everything out, I’ll forget to add somethin’ important. Cinnamon pancakes are easy to make, but they’re not very good when you forget to put sugar in them. That is a mistake I have made more times than I’d like to admit, especially if I’m off my game in the morning. Lucky for me and everyone else, the second batch always seems to turn out alright.
“Yeah,” Dean finally manages out into the material of Sam’s shirt. He gives one last squeeze, and when he pulls away Sam claps him on the shoulder. Dean looks him in the eye. “Thank you, Sammy.”
Cas’s fingers fall gentle onto Dean’s feathers. The secondaries, if he remembers, just to the left side of Dean’s body. Dean sighs, fights a shiver. It feels good the way that Cas touching his neck in the honey stall had felt good; sensitive and comforting until Dean wants to shake out of his skin at the same time he wants to fall asleep. A part of him that’s rarely touched being so- so intently held. It makes his arms break out into goosebumps.
Another breakup song, maybe? Dean gets that feeling she’s talking about, sorta felt it after what happened with Lisa.
“Okie dokie, sweetheart.” Dean grabs her little hand into his and reaches it forward to the wing he has wrapped around from his opposite side so that it crosses over his chest in a half cocoon. “Like this.” Bringing their hands up together, he guides Ella’s arm through a petting motion before he lets her continue on her own.
“Yeah, which makes you the Dodo Bird.”
Dean’s tone borders on joking, but the words burn uncomfortably in Castiel’s ears. He can feel where the whole line of his body tenses. He needs to leave, needs to escape and wrap all of his rotten fantasies up in a tight little box and throw them away where they will never see the light of day again. Castiel swallows, jolts as his eyes dart around and refuse to meet Dean’s.
Before he gets the chance to start groveling, Cas continues, “Was there something you needed, or did you come here just to bother me?” The words are mean, but they come out fond.
Dean didn’t realize how much he’d missed that light. And the memories of it don’t do it justice, how sweet and kind it is on the eyes. The way it banishes the monsters of Dean’s bedroom back under the bed so that there’s no chance of any dark figures sneaking their way in and causing irreversible harm. Cas was right, too, because the sight of that grace in one piece makes the last of Dean’s skittering skin settle.
The flowers in him grow up into his throat and he never wants Cas to stop looking at him like maybe he is worth more than being ordered around or being a parent to Sammy or being some girl’s one-night stand.
And so Castiel’s name is there in the intimacy of Dean’s mouth. It exists in that warm place. It’s as though Castiel doesn’t just hear the word, but its components, every individual letter floating in the air above Dean’s head. Little ribboned kite tails. Suddenly, Castiel likes very much that the name is his.
Bee… like, honey bee?
” It rattles the Earth. “Oh!” His eyes are rolling in his skull as he throws his head back against the soft grass, the hard ground, and his body knows exactly what to do. Belatedly, Castiel realizes that he is practically humping Dean’s hip, but Dean doesn’t seem to mind as he grinds down in counterpoint.
Uncertain, at first, that next Monday when they both showed back up at the stream again, Dean in human form and wearing a hopeful sort of smile. But that uncertainty was replaced by something kinder as the minutes wore on, as they sat toe to toe in the green clearing grass like they had before, and talked about the things that ailed them, or the people they made stories up about that day.
He scowls through the hurt. “Bullshit. That is such horseshit, Cas. You did what you did for the right reasons.”
The smile that stretches across Dean’s face is so genuine it almost feels wrong, like a programming error. “I’d like that, Cas.”
“Not as soft as a kitty, is it?” Dean asks.
He makes his way closer until he’s standing above Dean at his side. They exist together in silence.
“No,” Dean finally says in a way that even he doesn’t believe, “no, I was just curious.”
They walk in together, the sudden warmth of the bunker hitting Dean like a blanket. His eyelids are already drooping, and he allows himself, for the first time in a long time, to imagine the amazing sleep he’s about to get. He wonders if the nightmares will be any better with the new change or not. Shuffling in the direction of his bedroom, he turns to Cas.
“I look forward to it, Dean,” That light in Anna’s eyes has only gotten more perceptive, more mischievous. “See you tomorrow.”
“Because I need you to be,” Dean’s face crumbles into something pleading. “I’m a selfish prick and I need you to be okay. You don’t haveta be okay with me or with what I did, but I’m not leaving you here to cry by yourself because I wanted to play pretend. You don’t deserve that.” His cheek is already discoloring slightly from where Castiel had struck him. “Please, just le- let me walk you home, Cas. Let me make sure you get home okay, and then I won’t bother you again. I won’t tell anyone, I won’t talk about it. It’ll be- it’ll be something we both forget about.”
“I’ll have it waiting for you when the time comes. But there’s no rush.” Jack looks serious as he says it. He stares at Dean with something a little too perceptive. Dean clears his throat.
It doesn’t stop her from saying, “Didn’t you start crying just from looking at the book cover of
Cas places his hand on the side of Dean’s neck as the kiss deepens. It’s absolutely glorious. Every time Castiel kisses Dean, he can’t help but think that if the sensation never ended, he’d be alright with that. Besides, Dean is his favorite person anyway. The list of people he would miss is not too long. Anna could run the honey stall in his kiss-induced absence.
“We’re doin’ it t-today, and then we’ll do it again tomorrow, and- and I’ll fuck you next time, in the stream, and- anywhere- fuck- anywhere- every day- ‘cause you’re mine now. Finally mine now, Cas, and I ain’t letting you get away.”
Dean just nods dumbly. “Uh-huh.”
“Yeah,” Dean says.
Dean frowns, an eyebrow raising. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Wait. “Wait- Is this- Am I touching your angel dick right now?” His voice is freaked out, rising in pitch and volume as his eyes widen. For some reason, he still doesn’t take his hand away though.
Dean takes a steadying breath. “Want you inside.”
Dean kisses Cas’s collarbone where it’s already close to his mouth before setting his head back down again. “Yeah, you are.”
“Miraculous. That’s a good word for it. I’ve never been more grateful for my fate than the moment that we met each other.” He squeezes Dean’s knee, and it calms some of Dean’s turbulence.
For the first time, at least that Castiel can remember, he is grateful to be human.
That seems to be the correct answer to Dean’s probing because his soul sparks like a lighter and a hum comes from deep in his throat.
He’s sorta surprised he’s made it to song three and nothing has happened yet. Maybe this won’t be as bad as he thought. Famous last words.
Dean huffs, “Sounds like this Dean Winchester guy knows what he’s talking about. How’d you even get here, anyway? We’re a mile from your house.”
The word echoes through the barren store, off of its linoleum floors and too-high ceilings, until it becomes hollow in radio. The hair on Dean’s arms stands on end. He blinks down at the treacle pie. It feels like everything is moving in slow motion where his eyelashes catch on dust particles and the closing of his eyes lasts almost a full second before they open again. Slowly, he looks towards the ceiling where the PA speaker is.
“Uh-huh…” he says, sounding strained. Before Castiel can panic, which is pretty much exactly what he wants to do right now, Dean continues, “So what I’m hearing is that you wanna do dirty things to me while I sleep.”
“No,” Mystery Man finally responds, “you’re not. You’re very observant in a way others aren’t.” The compliment is so genuine that it makes Dean's fingers twitch, that someone he just met at a bar could find anything good about him. “I haven’t lost anyone in the sense that you’re referring to. But I suppose you look like…” He swallows thickly. “It is possible to lose parts of a person without them dying. That maybe it can be even more painful to see them living and know that not all of them made it to that moment.”
Behind him, Anna lets out an impressed and surprised sort of giggle at Castiel’s suaveness. He can hear the clinking of jars as she busies herself to give him and Dean some sort of privacy, though Castiel’s aware she’s most likely listening to every word.
Both of Dean’s eyebrows raise in realization. “Oh- um- uh, I’m sorry, man, but I don’t swing that way.”
“Peachy,” Dean grits.
“He-” Dean tries, but the words get lost. “Sam, he told me-” and he can’t make himself say the rest.
“I’m happy that I could help, Dean. If anything changes, I trust that you’ll let me know.” This time, Cas speaks with confidence. Maybe this was Cas’s olive branch back.
Dean feels out happily.
As Castiel continues to speak, he notices Charlie’s eyes drooping, getting heavier with every blink. A minute later she yawns.
It’s a Tuesday night. A bad day before what’s about to be an even worse one. Dean hadn’t even bothered to pretend to be friendly with every person he had passed when he went into town to get more drawing charcoal. Tomorrow, they’ll all be avoiding his eyes anyway, for once. For once, the people of this town will have a little bit of shame.
Inside of him. Like- and Cas has thought about that. The surety in Cas’s voice is so thrilling. Dean wants to give in to it a little bit, the same way that Cas held him in the honey stall and made him safe just by being there. And what would that be like if it were Cas in him instead? Where maybe- maybe Dean wouldn’t have to perform. Maybe Dean could just get fucked while Cas’s knowing eyes watched him.
Funnily enough, Dean’s penis-
Dean pushes his lips together against the smile trying to bud on his face. “I know you’re into the instruction videos, so I figured I’d give you a step-by-step on how I make my cinnamon pancakes. How does that sound?”
“Yeah.”
A pause. “Well, I do… a lot of nature studies. Um…”
Cas’s blue eyes watch him back as though in hope, as though in amazement.
“I have to go slowly,” he tries the words on his tongue and feels a little bit foolish. This pretend situation that both he and Dean know is false. But perhaps the point is to pretend. “I have to be very careful… I wouldn’t want to wake you.”
It’d almost be ticklish if the sensation wasn’t so deliberately teasing when Cas’s fingers count down Dean’s sides where he innately knows his ribs are, and then move in to skirt around his belly button. Dean’s dick is certainly getting back with the program, and it bobs when Cas’s hand passes across his treasure trail.
Very suddenly, he is struck by the fact that he is touching Castiel.
Dean isn’t sure for how long exactly, but it’s long enough for his muscles to relax, for his fear to settle out of him. He never wants to forget the way that Cas smells.
“Yes,” Cas says, sounding amused, “I think I did a wonderful job.”
And, oh, he had every reason to be worried. Because before the first verse is even over his eyes are wet. It’s a song about a romantic relationship, Dean’s pretty sure, but, god, if it doesn’t remind him of his childhood, of looking up to his father. Fuck-
“I’m just gonna say it. The old man wasn’t always right, Dean. He was almost never right. And if I tried to live my whole life wondering whether he’d like the way I was living, I would stay miserable trying to please him. Because I love Eileen, and I’m not fucking ashamed of it. I love the new Taylor Swift album. I love that I have my family here with me all of the time and that we have dinner together and watch Disney movies.”
“Dean, what’s going on?” Sam asks.
“Dean?” Anna asks as they walk through the market together. The sky above them does not exist because Castiel is not looking at it. All of the stalls are flying flags that Castiel doesn’t understand the meaning of. “Dean Winchester? The Swan?”
With that, Cas moves closer until the orb is just inches from Dean’s stomach. It pauses there for one final long second like Cas still isn’t entirely sold, before it passes through Dean’s skin in gradual movement so slow that Dean can actually see the orb’s glow get fainter and fainter as it disappears into Dean’s body. Because that’s exactly what it’s doing. Dean hadn’t really thought ahead about what exactly he was giving permission to, but he had assumed it was gonna be possession on some account. To be honest, Dean’s sorta surprised it’d taken this long for that to be the only option to get out of a sticky situation like this. Hell, he’d probably say he’s even mentally prepared to be a living puppet at this point.
Because once they talk about it, there’s no going back. Something curls in Dean’s chest at the thought, protective in a painful vice in awareness of what is at stake, of what he has to lose.
“Yeah. Me too, Sam.”
Dean looks mildly alarmed. “Not Cas, right. Castiel, sorry- didn’t mean to- ya know.”
“Ugh, I hate the cold!” Charlie huffs. “Who invented winter, anyway?”
Cas doesn’t respond, so Dean starts towards Jimmy’s body. “Like I was saying, Sam said it should be pretty easy.”
Something in the trees ahead of him moves. It is big, bigger than a rabbit or a squirrel or even a swan. Castiel’s heart beats wickedly as he ducks back behind the apiary, holding his breath and peering around its corner with wide eyes.
“You’ll have to let me know when we’re done, once you get a good look at it. I can always redo it if you want. Practice makes perfect, right?”
, Dean wants to say.
Dean shoots Cas an incredulous look before he huffs a shocked laugh when he finds Cas already watching him mirthfully. Just like that, Cas has him smiling through what must be a swollen and battered-up face by now.
“I’m so- almost-” Castiel moves his mouth to Dean’s cheek and grits. “I won’t be much longer.”
So Dean lets his own sniffle out, which makes Sam look up curiously. He startles when he finds Dean already looking at him, but his face smooths into something that almost says
The little girl looks genuinely stricken, so Dean hurries to say, “That’s why we’re gonna have enough fun for her, too, right? And then I’ll bottle all that fun energy up and take it home with me so I can give some to Charlie.”
Dean barely lets him finish his sentence. “
“And lucky for everyone, they’re pretty easy to make. Let me tell you, Cas, Castiel.” The use of Cas’s full name earns Dean a small shiver. He grins. “Castiel,” Dean puts emphasis on the
And those big hands move from Dean’s waist up his body until they’re cradling his face so that Cas can pull Dean closer for a kiss. It’s like the best feedback loop of all time, every point of contact, and Cas kisses Dean like he’ll take care of everything, like Dean is something precious to be handled thoughtfully. Cas’s mouth is hot and wet in invitation.
Cas seems to sense some of his distress, because his chiming tone is oddly comforting when he replies, “They’re just stars, Dean.” And when Dean barks a watery, disbelieving, manic sort of laugh, Cas repeats all steady in vibrations like rain falling, “They’re only stars. Big burning masses of hydrogen and helium. That’s all they are.”
“Of course.” Castiel turns to the shelves to grab an eight-ounce jar before returning to place it on the counter. When Dean reaches into his pocket, Castiel waves him off. “There’s no need, Dean. Consider it a Get Well Soon gift for Charlie.”
Dean, who just a day ago was a memory turned daydream turned fantasy that held no real weight in Castiel’s life besides something to think about in the slow hours of the stall, is now a person with a smile. A person who tips too much and who wants to know about honey. Who listens to what Castiel has to say with interest and impossibly kind green eyes.
“I apologize. The witch must have targeted me from behind, and I didn’t realize because the curse took so long to go into effect.”
” Castiel feels his face heat at the comment. Before he can stammer anything out, Charlie is smiling back at him again, bright against the sniffle she produces. “Now that we’re all acquainted, I actually do wanna know about the honey. It’s like, so fun.”
“You still good, sugar?”
“So if you aren’t watching some skin on skin action, what’s with the headphones?”
But Sam still has a peculiar look on his face that tells Castiel the subject won’t be dropped until he explains.
“Uh-huh! You can even ride real horses!” Jack nods enthusiastically.
“Shhh,” he soothes, feels his own heart rate cool, “shhh, shhh, everything’s okay. You’re safe. Everything is okay. Relax… just relax. I’m right here. I’m right here, Cas, taking care of you. Easy. It’s that easy. Me doing all the talkin’, you doing all the listening. It’s good. It’s all good, all good. It’s all okay. Sammy and Eileen down the hall, Claire and Kaia all safe with Jody, Jack just a wing flap away. Mmmm. Nothing to worry about anymore. Just my voice. Just my voice.”
“What are you doing tonight?” Dean asks before he realizes what a stupid question that is.
“I get how it is, when you see someone like that. It kinda feels like you can’t even look at ‘em cause you know you won’t be able to stop, and you don’t wanna be a freak about it or anything.”
“Over on the other side of the fire. Charlie beat me at Hands so I had to make the drink run.”
“God?” Castiel suggests.
“Dean Winchester’s World Famous Cinnamon Pancakes,” Dean corrects him. He turns back to the stove and moves the skillet full of bacon before dumping it onto a plate covered by a paper towel. Those are set down on the table in front of Castiel as well.
He lets out the breath that he didn't realize he was holding. It feels like being pulled from underwater after forty days of rain. Like he is breathing for the first time. He hums pleased to himself.
“Oh,” Castiel breathes. The dream had him so on edge already. He is so close.
“C’mon. There’s a sweet girl who likes your pumpkin pie out there that’s worried about you.”
“Yeah, well, I’ll just marry Cas, then.”
Research isn’t fun, but Dean knows it’s necessary, and he’s goddamn good at it when he puts his mind to it.
All Dean has to do is think about last night when Cas had stood up from the movie they were watching together to get popcorn, and he had squeezed Dean’s knee as he departed. That was how easy Dean was these days for Cas. He wants to answer, sort of, but Cas and Sam are both staring at him. He’s getting better, but he’s not cured of his no-chick-flick syndrome.
He takes shaky steps to the bed and knees up onto it as Dean watches. Something about the way Dean’s eyes track him makes Castiel hyper-aware of his own skin, like maybe he wants to preen. Slowly, he turns around and settles himself between Dean’s legs, spine ramrod straight. He can feel the way his body prickles with goosebumps.
Castiel turns back around to look at them to find a small sneer on Dean’s face.
It hits Dean in the chest where it stops his heart with the sweetest of twists. Little strings being played on a violin the size of his aorta in a drizzling performance. Cas is- Cas is warm. A solid weight for Dean to push against in resistance so perfect that they could balance in the middle if they wanted to. With stubble that tickles against Dean’s shaved face.
Cas’s eyes drop down at the table where he’s twirling the earbud wires around. “Yes, every so often. It’s- very pleasant.”
“Yes!” Dean calls over his shoulder with a laugh. “All yours- exactly!”
but Cas leaves little room for debate.
“A little warm. Even warmer now that you’re here.”
He carries his toolbox in hand, his smoker and gloves inside, because he didn’t get a chance to check the apiary on Monday. Even if he had, Castiel would have still made the journey out. It’s his spot, he thinks, and perhaps Linden’s as well. And to be quite honest, Linden is better company than most.
“Dean,” he says warmly
Oh, Jesus. Dean’s gonna keel over, ‘cause this is not good. This can’t be good right? That his swan brain is doing the hokey-pokey over a guy he’s only talked to in person twice?
“What’s it like to be a bird?” Castiel asks into the leaden silence of the clearing over the buzz of the bees. He can feel the weight of Dean’s eyes on him, but he resolutely doesn’t look up from the honeycomb he’s inspecting. A few of the bees circle him curiously.
They smile at each other in the bashful silence that follows, like neither of them are quite sure whether they’re on the same page or not. But Castiel doesn’t care for pages, or the words that other people say should be on them, so he simply asks, “How has your day been?” because he wants to know.
One of Cas’s hands moves to settle broad on the back of Dean’s head and holds him even tighter. An anchor. Until Dean isn’t adrift anymore. Until he wants to believe it when Cas says he’s going to be okay because Cas seems so sure of it. Like it’s a god-given fact that Castiel somehow knows.
They are, they are, they are.
Oh, yes, he is touching Dean. Under his palm, there is fabric and there are all those sensitive nerves and blood. He bets the skin is flushed red. He moves his hand up and down over it, pushing down against it, knowing what is underneath just as satisfying as the idea of touching what is underneath.
Dean doesn’t know whether he wants to laugh or cry. What a fuck up he’s had to have been, to make Cas think that the only way he’d miss him is if something was wrong with his brain. The thought hurts in a new way, in its own way, when Dean realizes how much pain he must have caused Castiel through the years.
And Cas has been MIA for over seventy-two hours now. He had told Dean he would be, that Jack was doing some major reboot that required time and patience. Cas had left with a heartfelt and almost apologetic kiss, and now there’s a grayness seeping into Dean’s bones that he doesn’t want to think about.
“Not quite,” Castiel says like he’s not feeling the effects of the touch the way that Dean is. “It was odd in the way that dreams can be, where the understanding is more important than the reality.”
“So hot inside. Made to take me, Dean. Made to take me. Oh,
He wants to take him to the town fires and hold his hand and glare at people who seem a little too friendly or a little too mean. He wants to hear all of Cas’s wise words in that stoic voice of his and nod at all the right spots and kiss him when Cas loses his place in the memory. Maybe make him lose his place for a little bit longer. He wants to be close and feel the warmth of Cas’s body and the realness of him until it settles his skittering skin. He wants Cas to touch him. He wants to touch Cas back.
“Yes, I suppose you have a point.”
His tears blur the light of the watchtower in the window.
“Will you tell me?”
Maybe his eyes are even damp with it, but still, there is something freeing about letting the sentiment out. Of not pretending it is not the truth. There is no one waiting for him at home, there is no one to hold, to love, to keep safe. Little girls do not approach him wanting to be picked up and lost children do not look to him for direction. He does not bump shoulders with strangers in acts of casual intimacy, and he barely even shakes their hands.
“I’m going to kiss you… now.”
“You already know the answer to that question.”
“Yes, I’m here,” he says once he’s found his footing.
“But that doesn’t matter, as I’ve said, because the physical evidence is there either way. That the cursed advisors, while no longer trapped in the form of a swan, still passed down their mutated genetics to their children, and then them to their own children, and so it continues. Now, the kingdom is left with a handful of people who still bear the mark of the curse. People who are treated with more interest than some of the royalty, I would say, because of the heroism of their late relatives. Until the legend perpetrates the fascination perpetrates the legend in circles.”
. The mysterious beat on it almost gives him whiplash from the previous depressing-ass assault he just sat through.
“You really don’t remember, do you?” Dean asks with some sort of morbid fascination, and it earns him a glare that says
“You could have not come back. You could have recognized that I thought I was talking to an actual bird with no understanding of the human language and moved thirty feet up the stream so that neither of us would bother the other.”
“Think you could magic up my sketchbook and charcoal from home?”
Dean stares back at Cas, and he can’t explain why there are unshed tears in his own eyes. Why there is a lump in his throat.
“Hey, uh, Castiel, got your ears on? Well, I guess you don’t, technically speaking. Doesn’t matter, where’re you at, man?” Dean prays, looking up at the sky to a beautiful clear night that lets the stars peak through.
Those broad shoulders jerk in surprise as Cas finally turns to face Dean. When Cas looks at him, his expression opens just to fall into something urgent. “Dean, are you alright?” Cas approaches the window to glance back and forth around the empty market, and his eyebrows furrow further. “What are you doing here?”
“So you let him live?” Cas asks thoughtfully.
“That is the dilemma.” Cas sighs, deep and labored, and Dean wonders how long he’s been waiting to bring this up, the concept seeming a burden. “The brain is very complex. I could attempt to heal some of your neural pathways, but I fear the consequences. I’ve never done anything like this before. You may lose memories or become disorientated. You’ve had too many entities meddling with your brain, Dean. I would not like to add to the stress of that.”
Cas taps his foot impatiently. “If you would prefer, I could book a ticket on a commercial airline. It would only be about twelve hours in the air.”
“Then hit me.”
“Seriously, Dean? You’re going to deny it?” Sam couldn’t believe him. He’s just seen them holding hands! How this man ever convinced anyone he was an FBI agent when he was this bad a liar, Sam would never know.
He pulled out three envelopes, each with a name on the front, and handed them to the respective person, and kept one for himself. “Passports, driver's licenses, birth certificates, social security numbers, college degrees, et cetera. I had to change a few things so it wasn’t immediately obvious we’re the same people.”
“We’re going to have to work together. On your knees.” He waits for Dean to follow the order. “Now put your foot up so we’re kneeling. Now, Sam?”
At the back of his mind, Dean registers the absence of grace, how weak his muscles suddenly feel, how the toes in his left shoe are pinching uncomfortably, but he can’t focus on anything other than the body in front of him. The still, unmoving body.
Use of alcohol as a coping mechanism, suicidal ideation, both brief.
Cas sighed and carried the plates over to the dining table. “Correct on all counts. The police caught her trespassing in an abandoned building while on a hunt, but they let her off with a warning. Her new girlfriend is called Amber. They met at the bar Claire’s been working at recently. And yes, Jody has invited us to dinner again.”
He spun the coin with a well-practiced flick high above his head, then caught it and covered it on the back of his hand.
“Left leg.”
The next few weeks seemed to fly by. Sam filled Eileen in on what went down with Chuck and told her she was out of danger. She had been absolutely terrified, standing at the side of the road, waiting for Sam to turn up, but not telling her what was happening.
“Never. Can’t wait for that kid to get here. She must be, what, twelve weeks, if you’re telling me?”
“Are you okay?” he asks hesitantly.
Dean barrelled his way past the other parents and made it to him first. He punched Jack in the same spot, causing him to wince slightly.
“Yeah, I know what the usual is, babe. Always with the no cheese.”
“It doesn’t work like that. Normally, an angel can’t possess a corpse at all, because there’s no one there to give consent, but I got Jimmy’s permission before he died, so I can re-enter him at any time, as long as he is freshly dead. If I wait several days, he will be uninhabitable, even if I heal him. I need to keep him in this state or I’ll be stuck in you, and you’ve expressed your displeasure at that idea.”
“Tomorrow?”
“It’s seven in the morning. Wait, Italy?”
“No. No, that can’t be true. I must have said it.”
Dean was about to playfully punch Cas in the arm but he saw Aunt Brigid approaching them.
Dean closed the final distance between them and placed a quick but passionate kiss on his lips, then before Cas had time to properly kiss him back, he pulled Cas’s hand and lead him towards the bedroom.
“What about it?” Cas seemed slightly alarmed by his sudden stammering.
The next morning, after Sam's guy confirms he has what they need, they start loading their supplies into the Impala. Dean is pleased to note that he doesn’t have to pack a change of clothes, or any snacks, or even stop to sleep or pee. It would be the easiest road trip ever if he didn’t have to bring his annoying human brother with him.
Dean can’t make his mouth move.
Dean snickers, and to his shock every one of the ten or so people scattered around him turn to him and roll their eyes. “Damn, alright, sorry Cas. Not a joke, got it. Sam and I’ll look into it as soon as I’m up.”
Some of them are a little lengthy, but it’s not like Dean is swimming in work these days, so he makes himself sit through and watch each of them. It’s rounding on two hours later when Dean finally finishes with a sleepy and satisfied smile. He looks down at the pad of paper he’s been keeping notes and doodling on, nods to himself. Not too shabby, Winchester.
“How would you know? I ran into Mrs. Frankfurt and she tried to set me up with her son again. I’d call that pretty life-threatening.”
“Yeah, if you wanna watch some poor bozo get his finger separated from his body.”
Castiel freezes.
“Let me see what all of this fuss is about,” Cas says. He watches his own fingers undo the three notches of Dean’s button fly, and then pushes Dean’s pants down to his lower thighs. Cas leaves them there in favor of carefully holding onto the elastic waistband of Dean’s navy boxers as he peels them down very, very slowly. Under Cas’s intense scrutiny, Dean shivers. Because Cas’s face is so hungry, so oddly captivated, as Dean’s hard dick is revealed inch by inch to the air.
“Hey, hey, hey!” Dean gripes more intensely than necessary. It gets Cas to stop though, and he looks at Dean in alarm. “Where do you think you’re going, hotshot?”
“It was warm the way that dreams are. Where you can be in love at the same time that you have sex and both feel equally pleasurable. Equally rewarding. Because in my dream you had-” Cas stops abruptly. “It might sound… silly, I suppose.”
Dean’s added sound effects earn him a single, soft laugh, a peel on a puff of air, and a decidedly delighted, “
“Oh,” he says distantly, “I wasn’t aware.”
“Cas!” Dean shouts, all shocked panic.
Dean’s chest tightens up again and he moves his nose from Cas’s neck to the vulnerable skin behind his ear where his hair curls in. He thinks about the fact that Cas could leave him. He thinks about the fact that Cas hasn’t yet. Lets out a flickering breath into Cas’s skin.
With both of Eileen’s parents dead, she had no one to walk her down the aisle, but she looked radiant in her white lace gown as she walked down the short gap in the chairs. She handed her bouquet off to Valerie so she could take Sam’s hands and beam a wide smile at him.
Dean took something small out of his jeans pockets. He held the black meteorite and sterling silver ring up to Cas.
He spat on the floor.
“Hmm. It’s actually not bad.”
“Good, then go get some. Bring me back a cup, too.” Dean rolled off of Cas’s stomach and onto his back.
“Did you seriously just
“You barely knew her either, but that didn’t stop you from having intercourse with her in the backseat of your car. The same seat you have made me sit in on numerous occasions.”
Dean paused while Sam spoke.
He spun back round and took a step closer to Cas. “I want to have sex with you.”
“Throw pillows? Really?” Sam scoffed.
“Good evening,” Dean smiled, indulging Cas with one last kiss.
She barely took a breath throughout her whole speech. Christ, he’d forgotten how much she could talk. Dean, Cas, and Jack shared a sideways glance.
“Kind of expensive, though,” Sam said, frowning at the price on the pamphlet.
In the morning, as soon as Sam knocks on Cas’s door, he turns off the TV, grateful to be rid of the canned laughter in a repeat of a nineties sitcom Dean had already watched three times.
They walked down the aisle as quickly as Harry’s toddling legs would allow them, then sat down in the front row next to Cas.
“My apologies. Now, if you sit still, this will hurt less.”
“With great power comes great responsibility, Mr. Potter,” Dean said in a poor imitation of Yoda's voice.
He could just about make out Cas nodding, so he settled his head on Cas’s chest, and curled into his side. Cas tentatively placed one hand on Dean's hip and the other in his hair.
“Why does everyone keep asking that?” Dean muttered to himself. “Wait, I know that voice.”
“But–”
“I was kind of preoccupied!”
She squealed again and ran off, pulling Chad by the hand, causing him to stumble slightly before getting his footing and following her.
On day eight of their cohabitation, Cas starts his turn in control as he always does by heading into his room, but instead of his usual two-finger press to his vessel's chest, he heads down to the feet.
The next room had a horrendous mix of furniture that didn’t match each other or the wall color. Said walls were covered in posters, magazine clippings and random junk Jack had accumulated, and the bedsheets a truly disgusting shade of green. Dean pursed his lips as he looked at the one blight in his otherwise perfect home. He quickly hurried everyone out of there and shut the door.
"Why?"
“No idea. Can’t wait to find out.” Dean leaned backwards and let his arm fall over Cas’s shoulders. Cas instinctively snuggled closer and looked up at him.
“...No,” Cas lies.
After all the food was eaten and the fourth bottle of wine drunk, Eileen put a very tired Harrison down in the guest room for the night, stumbling slightly as she walked.
God, he was just sex on legs. How had it ever taken him twelve years to realize he was into Cas? But, speaking of sex…
“And doing nothing, that’s your idea of true happiness?” Sam winked at Jack but Jack didn’t seem to be following.
“Oh, no, we’ve never met, but I’m a huge fan! I drove all the way out to Phoenix to listen to your TED talk on Neolithic cave drawings. It was amazing!”
“Why are we stopping?”
Sam stammered again.
Cas sits in the car, unmoving. Sam raises his eyebrows.
Sam steps between the barrel of the gun and his brother, and speaks calmly, whilst maintaining eye contact. “Okay, easy. That
She grabbed him by the arm and dragged him with surprising speed, given her footwear, towards the door.
Eileen grabbed a pair of jeans from a nearby rack and held them up to Cas’s waist. She shook her head and grabbed a size bigger. With a nod of approval, she handed them to Cas.
Cas tilts his head to the side.
“Don’t I know it.”
She flicked up the bottom of her dress to reveal a gun in a thigh holster. Sam frantically tried to cover it back up before Aunt Brigid noticed. A quick glance to the back of the room showed she was mentally criticizing the floral displays and had seen nothing.
Jack watched the scene with amusement. He studied his own piece for a moment before pie-ing Dean too.
Cas places his hands hesitantly on the steering wheel. “Driving?”
Becky squealed and clapped her hands in glee. “What about Sam. Where’s he now? Is he happy?”
“Seriously, guys? It’s like a mirror!”
The evening started to get hazy somewhere around Dean’s fourth cocktail. It all became a blur of feathers, glitter, and dancing until it all went black.
Dean scoffs.
Most of them shook their heads. The old man in the corner didn’t look up from his meal. He probably hadn’t even noticed the fight.
Cas turned away from Dean, as though he could hardly stand to look at him.
“No?”
“Harry?” Sam hedged, and he took him in his arms.
Sam put his food down on the table and looked over Jack’s shoulder at his work. His face of confusion matched Dean’s.
“Got it?” Sam asks.
Dean turned his teasing attentions onto Cas. “Oh no. My
He opened the door and bowed like a footman to Eileen.
“Yes, I think so.”
Cas snaps his head back to the front. “Dean, did you just use me to check out your ass?”
“That is fun!” Jack says gleefully.
They all grabbed a side of the cake board and carried it out to the dancefloor, careful not to drop it a second time.
Sam raises his hand in a sort of half-wave and leaves for his bedroom.
Dean scoffs.
“They won’t melt,” Jack answered with surety.
Charlie conjured what Dean was sure was a fake driver's license from somewhere near the top of her dress and handed it over. He couldn’t work out where she’d been stashing that. There were no pockets on that tiny dress and she had no purse with her.
Dean barely has time to register the fact Cas has firmly pressed their lips together before he feels the familiar sensation of grace entering his body.
Dean pulled out of his grip to look him full in the face. “So this is your fault!”
Cas has no choice but to cling onto the steering wheel and focus on the road while his right arm fumbles blindly for the ejected tape. Dean reaches for the box of cassettes in the footwell to set it on his lap and pulls each one out, in turn, to hold in front of his eyes until he finds the right one and puts it in the stereo.
specifically. Cas never gives me, or anyone else, bedroom eyes. Have you even talked to him about this?”
Dean paced up and down past the table the café’s waitress had given him. He knew he was getting weird looks, but he didn’t care.
Eileen and Donna made their way to the kitchen. Dean could already feel this evening going downhill; a wine-drunk Eileen was a force to be reckoned with.
have you, forever.
“I’m restraining him for his own good,” Cas interrupts.
“No.”
“In the cupboard.”
“No, I don’t get hangovers.”
“You got money?” Dean replied snarkily.
“You’re off work again tomorrow, yeah?”
Cas walked through the door with a book in one hand and one of the dining room chairs in the other. Like the true old man he was becoming, he had taken to reading out on the porch recently. He settled in the chair, put on his reading glasses, and started to read Lizzo’s new autobiography that he’d just picked up from the library in town.
handling.”
, it prompts in that same buttery yellow as before,
“Is it working?”
“Yeah, you died. Or your- uh- grace, I guess. What I saw at the apple orchard.”
“G’night, moon,” Dean mumbles as he shuts his dry eyes. He doesn’t know why the phrasing sounds so familiar until he remembers a children’s book, one that he’d definitely stolen from some local library as they rolled through so that Sammy could have a bedtime story. Dean used to have the little poem in it memorized, but these days the words are lost to him.
“Yeah, me too.”
. “I could try to spell cinnamon, but I’d probably fuck it up. However, just because I can’t spell it doesn’t mean you don’t need it. You can’t forget the cinnamon, Castiel, or else they’re not gonna be cinnamon pancakes, and where’s the fun in that? It’s like Frozen without the singing. Who wants cinnamon pancakes without the cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon?
“I’m close-” Cas chokes. He’s wearing those same wide, scared eyes as the first night Dean had kissed him, like he doesn’t believe what is happening right in front of them, like he doesn’t know how to proceed in this dreamscape.
“Good,” Dean claps his hands together. “I needed to be out these clothes, like, yesterday.” He checks his watch. “Dinner should be ready around eight.”
“You’re soul is just as beautiful as I remembered,” Cas praises. He leans in for a real kiss.
“Shut up.”
“I’m glad you’re no longer there. I remember Hell, and it is no place for someone like you.”
“What if I told you that you were holy? That, to me, this is as consecrated as ceremony?” Castiel pauses, then breathes, “That the inside of this body becomes a place for unity? Here.” He presses his finger all the way in before drawing it out with little effort. “Right here. Where you become a vessel not through lineage, and not through coercion, but through the desire for us to be closer.”
Castiel pauses, pulls away an inch. “As much as the thought tempts me, the people in town would bother you about it relentlessly. The personal satisfaction wouldn’t be worth the hindrance it would cause you. Perhaps, lower down,” his voice deepens in suggestion.
Cas eyes him up, just staring at him, and Dean feels his slightly terrified smile drop with nerves. Cas’s damp hand lands on his shoulder to give a squeeze before it trails up to cup the side of Dean’s neck. “I’m sure it’s lovely, Dean. Now hand me the cup you’ve been washing for the past five minutes while you were pretending not to look at me.”
“I’m not sure- it’s-it’s-” Castiel’s teeth chatter together. His body is trying desperately to jerk away, but Dean has him pinned in place. It’s as though it feels so pleasurable that it doesn’t anymore, that it hurts, but Castiel doesn’t want Dean to stop touching him. “Keep going.”
“Wait- Are you
“Okay, okay, I’m listening.”
He watches with glee at the subtle hitch in Cas’s shoulders. Then, to Dean’s surprise, Cas let out a pleased little, “
Eventually, Castiel finds the will to move and leans in to kiss at each of Dean’s closed eyelids. When he pulls back, Dean’s eyes are open again. They remain empty and blown.
“Yeah,” she says and then nods her head as if making a decision.
“They like you. They want you to touch them.”
And then Eileen is grinning too, motioning them to get closer to each other as she takes her phone out of her back pocket. “I need a picture for the family group chat. You look like idiots.”
He doesn’t wait for any response as he walks up into the trees at the side of the clearing where Dean had taken his clothes off earlier. They’re still there in a pile and he grabs them carelessly with his trembling hands. When he clears the tree line, Dean’s head and bare shoulders are bobbing up out of the surface of the stream. Linden is nowhere to be found.
“Yes, I can feel you,” Castiel smiles down at Dean’s fuzzy eyes, “I know.”
“Like I said, I’ve been practicing.” Dean can’t resist straining his neck to press a kiss to Cas’s shoulder blade, but he doesn’t linger on it. “This time I’m gonna draw on your back.”
“Everything good?” Sam asks before stepping haltingly into the room.
“No-” Dean finally manages- “no, I- uh- I had a bad dream.” He feels stupid saying it, but it seems to soothe Cas’s panic a little bit.
understood their weight until now. Their import. I could not explain to you the feeling I had when I realized I had a home here with you. How I could have been so lucky to have found a home outside of Heaven.”
They lock eyes, and Dean forgets to breathe. He wonders what his face looks like, dopey and open in surprise because his brain feels clogged with all of the emotions that rush to the surface at once. Probably idiotic with the shaving cream covering half of his face.
“What am I watching right now?” Eileen’s voice comes from the doorway. “It looks like you guys are screaming.”
“Uh, I guess?”
Everything in Dean, human and swan and all of the freak places that the genetics can’t seem to separate themselves cools to stasis in satisfaction. Because his swan brain is wiggling happily under the sensation of water, and
This spot has become his reprieve of sorts. Away from the bustling of the shop, the chatter of people and the concern of Anna and Gabriel. Where it may be a little lonely, but the bees and the sunlight don’t judge him. Where there is no one, there is no one to be an outsider to.
“You know what, angel?” Dean eventually breaks the quiet with his voice still pitched low.
“What happened to Jessica is not your fault, Dean. Nothing would have prevented her death, as tragic as it was. Please, understand that and stop blaming yourself.” There is no room for doubt in Cas’s unyielding tone, deep and heating like good, dark roasted coffee. “Not to mention that you are the furthest a person could be from selfish. Sam came with you, and you have your brother now. That is how it is supposed to be. I shouldn’t be telling you this but- but Dean, please hear me. Your father is unharmed, and you will find him. Sam isn’t going to leave you. Understand that there is an end to this loneliness that you feel. Where I am from, you have so many people in your life who love you. Do not forget this.”
Dean stares at his phone. Two minutes to midnight Eastern, eleven o’clock Central. He wills the number to change and they look right back at him and spit in his face because they don’t change even though he’s trying to make them change with his mind. 10:58 points at him and laughs.
For one sick fucking moment, Dean is really glad that she can’t hear him. Because there’s disgust in the back of his throat, at how easy it was for him to disrupt their moment. How easy it was to yell, especially with her there. Sam had heard worse, had said worse, but Eileen didn’t deserve Dean’s bullshit. And if he did something that scared her- if he did something that made her scared of him- he feels sick.
This time, when Castiel wakes up, the TV is black with a screen saver and he remembers everything.
Dean frowns and finally pulls away. He would be worried, maybe is a little bit, because when do they ever really catch a fucking break, but Cas is looking at him with something so fragile in his eyes. Something light and hopeful and sad all at the same time.
Castiel nods with a long-suffering sigh. “My mother was religious.”
The answer appears to be not, because he can tell that Dean is stiffening too, just against the top of his thigh. That is- it’s Dean’s- A part of him that no one else gets to see or touch. A physical manifestation of his enjoyment of their closeness. It is a sensation that Castiel will not forget anytime soon. Even if he and Dean were to never do this again, Cas thinks that he could reach orgasm every day for the rest of his life just from the memory of Dean’s hardness against him.
That’s all it takes. Before Dean can even register Cas’s fingers leaving him, he’s being filled up with Cas’s cock in nearly one push. It’s big and it stretches him out just right. His body accommodates for it as if it’d always been inside of him, like a key into a lock, made to take Cas like this. Castiel looms over him once again, and Dean’s arms wrap around him to clutch him close. He can feel the way his fingernails are digging in so harshly they’re most likely breaking skin, but he can’t get himself to let go.
“Absolutely!” Dean practically has to turn over his shoulder to say it with how much distance he’s already put between them.
Dean has never been more grateful for anything when Castiel doesn’t ask questions, just smiles. “Of course, Dean.”
Everything is so slippery and hot, wet, wet, wet. Castiel’s finger’s wrap around-
Charlie winks at him. “You got it, hot stuff.” Then she disappears into the crowd of townspeople shopping for their groceries.
Then they are kissing again. Castiel is pinned down and held. He can feel where the delicate sweat on Dean’s skin transfers to his in a way that is so intimate it makes him wish it were possible to be even closer than this. Maybe there is, but Castiel doesn’t know if either of them is ready for it quite yet. One day, he thinks as Dean nibbles on his bottom lip. It will happen one day. For now, Dean is on top of him.
Dean doesn’t respond, doesn’t so much as move, just continues to blink up at him with eyelashes still damp and clumped together. But his soul is that buttery yellow, maybe even more pastel, so Castiel holds off on panicking.
And then he holds up an unsteady hand clutching at his phone and begins to read, “I’m elated to tell you that my 9th studio album,
“What can I get ya, hun?” she asks around the gum clenched between her back molars.
And something settles in Dean’s shoulders at Castiel’s awkward reassurance.
he reminds himself.
She sings about a tennis court and dancing, which makes Dean feel a little bit pleased that he already understood the energy of the song. Must be his innate cowboy senses.
“Dry ingredients: Done, D-O-N-E. Now we focus on the wet ingredients. We need a separate bowl to mix them, like I said, I have no idea why. I will say, though, the hard part is over. The wet ingredients are a little easier.
Dean has to prop himself up on his arm as he giggles maniacally. “No- no, Cas, that’s the funniest part. He couldn’t figure out what was wrong so he ended up buyin’ all new pants.”
Dean nods, fights the way his face is threatening to heat when he says, “And Castiel. The- uh- guy from the honey stall?”
Cas just continues to stare at him as if he had never stood up in the first place. Dean scowls back.
It’s absolutely insignificant information, but Castiel keeps it like a secret anyway. He feels he owes Eileen, any of the Swans really, whatever shred of privacy he can give them. Sometimes, a person, even if that person is a Swan, just wants to buy honey to mix into their tea, and it’s really as simple as that.
Once again, there is no response. And for some reason the lack of discussion on the matter almost makes Castiel feel better. Where he can let all of his thoughts and worries out to a bird that can’t understand him, can’t judge him. He could say anything he wanted to, could confess to murder or sit here for three hours and talk about the idiosyncrasies of honeybees until his lungs gave out without another person across from him to judge him for any of it. Perhaps sharing his refuge won’t be as pesky as he thought it’d be.
But his eyes are narrowed. His eyebrows drawn down in suspicion. The book he’s holding stays opened at chest level, and Cas doesn’t lower it when he speaks.
“You’re right, man.” Dean chuckles, moves towards him in a similar fashion to Sam, arm raised for just a moment before he seems to catch himself and drop it. His smile drops with it. “I’m gonna go see if Sam needs help.”
“You… think of me as your mate?”
When he walks out into the main room, Sam and Eileen are both sitting at the map table on their laptops, their ankles hooked underneath. Dean looks at them, feels scared and shriveled and small in a way that makes bitterness rise up in him. His hand is shaking around the top of the garbage bag where it’s tensed into a white-knuckled fist.
“You stupid, stupid son of a bitch!” And he cries in violence. He cries like something’s wrenching out of him and maybe it is.
“I-” the guy stutters, “I was just-”
But did he really not know? He had sat there and told Dean all about the Swans, with details to the story that even Dean hadn’t heard before, and Dean had been waiting for the
“Right,” Dean nods, keeps walking. This is about to go very badly. He should’ve thought about this a little bit more. “Not right,” he decides and digs his heels into the dirt.
The corner of Cas’s mouth twitches. “While that sounds wonderful, this is… I enjoy the feeling of your hands. Knowing that they’re your hands.” He doesn’t say anything else, but Dean thinks he understands.
“Yeah, and humans bleed. We’re in the middle of nowhere, we’ve got no antiseptic. You really want to do this here?”
“You’ve got reading.”
“What? That’s not what this is. I’m just meeting up with an old friend.”
They both take a few minutes to soak in their surroundings. They could probably spend a thousand years there and still find something new to amaze them every day.
Eventually, it grew late, so Sam and Dean headed to their rooms to get ready for bed. Jack also retired to his room, but he had no need to sleep. He liked to pretend, though. He found it made everyone else more comfortable if he didn’t act too unusual.
Dean takes the angel blade out of Cas’s sleeve and pokes an imaginary enemy in front of him, then slashes the air a few times for good measure.
“Damn, it only took them five hours?”
“Okay,”
Cas starts to prepare his wings, still invisible to Dean’s eyes, for flight, but he can feel Dean’s side of the body hesitating.
Dean steadied his grip on the angel blade.
Dean woke slowly the following morning. He cracked open one eye just far enough to check his alarm clock. He had slept for ten straight hours. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept that long. He startled briefly when his bed seemed to shift under him before he realized he was still laying on top of Cas.
“Told you. Getting burgers. Grab some of those,” Dean pointed at some nearby tomatoes.
’” Zehra mimicked. “He’s so modest. The guy is a savant. He’s revolutionized the field. What must it be like for you, to be in his presence every day?”
“No, I do.” He thought about it for a moment. “If it worked so well for the last God–”
Even though the last thing he wanted to do was pull away, he did need to breathe. He placed a small kiss on the side of his mouth, then his cheek, temple, and finally his forehead.
“You called him babe!”
“These are on me. Or, more accurately,” she leaned closer so only he could hear, “they’re on Mr. Bezos.”
Sam chuckles. “Yeah, that sounds like Dean.”
“Yeah, um, that kind of sex. Uh, why haven’t we…?” Dean let eyebrows finish the rest of the sentence.
In all his surprise of finding he had a co-pilot tagging along, he had almost forgotten his reason for taking a new vessel in the first place. He looks down at Jimmy Novak’s unmoving form and gets a good look at his injuries from the outside for the first time. Somehow, it is worse than he imagined.
“I warn you, with my grace as weakened as it is, it won’t survive for long outside of a body.
Jack tried to interject. “I told you, I thought they were Smarties. I didn’t know what they’d—”
Dean and Cas walk toward Cas’s room. There’s no discussion; it’s like they can read each other’s thoughts.
Donna wrapped an overly supportive arm around his shoulders and squeezed so tight he thought something was going to break. “What’s a family dinner without drama, eh?”
Three weeks ago it would’ve driven Dean crazy, made him irrationally mad with that easy anger. A mantra of
“We need to dress these wounds,” he replies as he pushes open the door.
Warnings in the end notes.
He puts one arm around the shoulders, and one under the knees and heaves, groaning under the strain.
Dean hesitantly swings his leg out of the car and plants it firmly on the ground. Cas does the same with his. They both straighten their knees at the same time so they are standing.
“A lot of hearing parents teach their children sign language. They can pick it up quicker than spoken language at this age. And, of course, it will be useful for Eileen when he’s older. Oh, crap,”
Cas smirked. “You were quite a long time.”
“She seemed nice.”
“If it will allow me peace from you, I’ll read every book in this bunker.”
“Seriously, man, I asked you to help because I thought you’d be good at this. You remodeled your whole house single-handedly, you’ve rebuilt your car from the wheels up, but you can’t assemble a crib?”
“Nice curtains,” Sam smirked and pointed at the light yellow frilly drapes.
The bouncer looked at him more intensely now he was closer. She ignored the license and scanned her eyes across his face, from his crow's feet over to his graying temples.
Cas takes an even bigger bite of the sandwich.
Cas changed his grip so his hands were on the man's shoulders, and used his new leverage to bring his body down and knee him in his chin. Then, while he was doubled over, Cas elbowed him between the shoulder blades, causing him to fall forwards and cut his palms in the road.
“Didn’t take you for the type, Cas,” Diego mused in awe.
The others had finally made their way over a few moments later, having not elbowed any jubilant parents. “Hey, I went to college,” Sam pouted.
“Same here. I’ll start again tomorrow.”
She shrugged. “Cas doesn’t look like my dad to me. Not anymore. There are the obvious things, like the voice and the glasses, but also, I dunno, he holds himself differently, laughs differently. My dad was a straight-laced, church-on-Sundays type. And Cas is, well, Cas is a doof.”
Just as the sun was starting to set, they took a turn down a narrow dirt track that was so bumpy he apologized to his car’s suspension the whole way. The track led to a river separating two fields, one of wheat and the other corn. Dean parked the car and reached into the back for the beers, then gestured for Cas to get out. They sat on Baby’s hood and watched the sun disappear under the horizon, and the moon rise to take its place.
“I’ve been waiting for the right moment. Some alone time, something romantic, but it’s been difficult with Harry now.”
“You and me against the world, then, huh?” Dean lightly tapped the top of Cas’s head with his own.
“Can you do that?”
“Wait, what?” Dean said, as he raised his hands to defend against the attack.
She checks the ancient computer on the desk next to her for a moment before saying, “We have two double rooms, next door to each other. How does that sound?”
“Will you stay with me tonight? Sleep next to me?”
They spent weeks searching online for the perfect house. Dean nearly tore his hair out reading mortgage pamphlets and threatened to just start squatting in the first empty house they saw in town. Cas had to kindly remind him several times that this was only the start of a normal human life, and it was only going to get harder after this. He didn’t like it that much.
Sam runs straight to the nearest draw and pulls out two magazines of witch-killing bullets. He stashed them all over the bunker a few days ago just in case. He loads one into the gun in his waistband and tucks the other in his back pocket.
Cas cut him off with a kiss. In all the resulting commotion, no one noticed the first aid kit and the small glass vial get shoved to the floor.
“Wait, seriously?” Sam took the top bun off his burger and grabbed the bacon off the top and gave it a sniff. With a doubtful glance at Dean, he took a small bite. “Woah, that actually is veggie bacon.”
“Yeah, well I didn’t have a choice. I was stuck with him. But you chose this.”
Fuck. “I thought you weren’t interested in things getting more X-rated.”
“Me neither,”
“I was texting you updates all evening!”
“Moose. Your turn.”
“Shh, don’t tell her. I want it to be a surprise.”
Cas stood from his chair, then paused and looked at Dean, as if asking permission, which Dean granted with a nod and a small smile. Cas kissed the top of his head and left the room.
“Damn straight.”
He looked down at his shoes. “I really liked that shirt.”
