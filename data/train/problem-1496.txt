Sherlock swallows against the sudden dryness in his throat as something painful tugs in his chest. He hasn’t even met the boy, yet he’s afraid of losing him. Sherlock scolds himself inwardly for his moment of weakness. He has to pull himself together. He is Sherlock Holmes. He doesn’t care, can’t care about John. Caring is not an advantage, and Sherlock knows it.
(12:00) Nope! I mean, you can be rude but as far as I'm concerned, the recipients have all deserved it. I like you :)
The words stung him, and he faltered for a second before replying, "I'm not a child, Mycroft. I can take care of myself." Sherlock hated the betraying strain in his voice, knowing very well that nothing escaped his brother's notice.
He came with Sherlock’s name on his tongue, spilling his come on Sherlock’s hand and cock. Sherlock shortly followed and bit down on his neck hard as he came. It would leave a mark.
That afternoon, John felt increasingly anxious. Despite it having been a week since his father had had an angry episode, John's chest still hurt when he took deep breaths, and it stopped him from going for a jog, something he normally did to distract his busy thoughts from becoming overwhelming. It didn't help that Sherlock wasn't answering his text messages. Not that he had sent many, or that they very especially urgent. He just wished he knew what Sherlock was doing.
The wall on the far right was covered with a large oak bookcase which stretched from the floor to the very last centimeter underneath the ceiling. It was filled to the brim with books. John's eyes darted over them.
Sherlock. The I-consider-myself-married-to-my-work-though-I-am-flattered-thank-you-and-goodbye Sherlock. John had never seen Sherlock like that before; he was brooding and texting a lot, and he seemed almost love-struck. He became defensive whenever Irene was brought up in conversation and was painstakingly irritated with John at all times. Jealousy burned hot and red in John’s veins, and he had to do a lot of counting-to-tens to prevent himself from doing something incredibly reckless that could potentially ruin everything.
(16:30) I mean, there’s plenty of room. We don’t even have to see each other. I can stay out of your sight. SH
The building behind her doesn’t seem to be inhabited at the moment; all the lights are off and the curtains are drawn, and there is no one down the alleyway toward the main street either. Suddenly their secluded meeting location seems, well… a little odd. He tries to shake the uncomfortable feeling away but Sherlock’s words are nagging in the back of his head; he is in danger.
Sherlock swallowed uncomfortably, not liking the fact that H was drunk. "His name is Victor. He's transferring to our school after the summer."
Firstly, we have made some changes to the story. In the text that Mary sends Sherlock there are no longer coordinates included. We realized it was pretty stupid, why would she include coordinates?
(00:55) No. No, it's not your fault. None of those things were your fault. And this isn't your fault, either. It's my fault for dragging you into this. You deserve better. You deserve better than me. It's probably for the better if we don't talk anymore. I hope you'll be happy. You deserve that. SH
(19:10) That's not what I said. I said, Mary doesn't appreciate you. She's just trying to get to me through you. You have to trust me. SH
There is one anchoring presence in the universe around which everything revolves, and that presence is Sherlock Holmes. There may be distractions and temporary cosmic glitches, but eventually everything comes back to the world’s only Consulting Detective. Not that John has anything against that, mind you—on the contrary, John thoroughly enjoys the crazy adventures that Sherlock brings him along on. It’s just that
[14:35] This has nothing to do with John. I swear, if you lay so much as the tip of your finger on him, you'll wish you'd never been born. SH
"You know I will not tolerate having a faggot son," he spat and punched John again in the stomach, hard enough for John to double over and for his vision to become blurry with tears.
John turned his neck to the right and spotted the big, rusty door behind him. It looked industrial and was no doubt bolted shut from the outside.
He didn’t have much time to think, yet alone react, when the cab suddenly stopped, signaling that they had reached their destination. Looking over at Sherlock, who was wearing his tight, purple shirt and dark, black jeans, he noticed the slight smirk, rolling his eyes. He would have to remember, when they entered the building, that this was for a case, and wouldn’t be anything but the means to acquire information that would otherwise be impossible to retrieve. Somewhere, inside this dark building, a criminal was waiting to make a mistake.
(12:18) And why is that? I promise to keep my mouth shut if you're worried that your friends will find out that you've been texting someone like me. SH
(10:50) I did. But it's highly unlikely you know me. Unless you, too, work for Scotland Yard, that is. SH
(06:20) Thank you for the socks. Not really the same quality as my old ones, but I guess they'll do. SH
As soon as he is shaking Rose’s hand, she pulls his sleeve up and inserts a needle into his arm and he gasps in surprise just as a deep, baritone voice behind him shouts his name.
Following the dark curls, he found himself inside a dimly lit, damp room, the air heavy with the smell of sweat and bodily fluids. There were men and women in compromising positions to either side of the entrance, couples entwined in each other on couches and makeshift beds, some engaging in group activities. John felt his pulse rise, his breathing becoming heavier, the sounds in the room tickling his arousal, praying desperately that Sherlock would be too occupied by the case to notice. Looking around, John noticed a few people stopping to look at them. Well, more accurately, looking at
Then he sees it. He sees her. A woman standing behind one of the cars, as if she is trying to hide, looking up at the window, up at him. Her expression is serious. Angry? Perhaps. There’s something odd about her.
John got up from where he had been lying, and hurried downstairs, nearly knocking Mrs. Hudson over in the process. He uttered his hasty apologies and scurried down the second flight of stairs in the main hall. He quickly found the corridor and the second door on the right. He hesitated.
(03:10) If Moriarty is our killer, he must know that I’m the only one who’s clever enough to realize that these serial suicides are not actually suicides. SH
(16:45) No, it’s fine. And don’t worry, I’ll stay out of your way. I can have someone else show you to your room, if you want. SH
going to drop dead. He was going to die of cardiac arrest, a broken heart or something equally ridiculous. Not only was the woman incredibly beautiful, but there was something about her that seemed to appeal to Sherlock.
In the next moment, Sherlock let out a surprised gasp as he was forcefully dragged into the alleyway they were just passing, and found himself pressed backwards up against the dark brick wall. In an instant, Victor's lips were on his, and it took Sherlock a few seconds to process what was happening, but once he had regained his senses he opened his mouth slightly, allowing Victor better access to his mouth.
As a yawn escapes his lips, Sherlock knows that he has to sleep. He still hasn’t managed to prove Scotland Yard that he’s right, but he’s been awake almost 72 hours, and the lack of sleep is slowing his thought processes, making it difficult to focus. But he can’t go home, not when John is there. Sherlock’s desperate to meet him, to see his sandy-blonde hair frame his tanned skin, to see his mouth curve into a smile and his blue eyes twinkle as John tells his impossibly dry jokes, but he can’t. He can’t risk losing him, not now. Not when he’s let himself get sentimental, let himself care about the boy. Caring is not an advantage, and yet here he is, worrying and caring about a boy who will eventually leave him. No one who meets him ever wants to stay. Why would John be an exception? He won’t stay forever, Sherlock knows, but he’s willing to try to prolong the inevitable.
His eyes were glazed and his lips were swollen, and the intensity in his gaze was a little intimidating. Sherlock could see he was also struggling to regain his composure and catch his breath, the outline of an erection visible through the fabric of his jeans.
Sherlock’s phone gives a last warning beep before going dead as he stuffs it back into his pocket with trembling fingers. He has three minutes and twenty-six seconds left before a car pulls up, three minutes and twenty-six seconds left to get himself together before one of Mycroft’s men sees the state he’s in, but he can’t bring himself to move, can’t bring himself to care, his pride being the last thing on his mind.
John smiled a little, propping his head up against the headboard of his bed. He clutched his phone to his chest and let out a shaky breath. This was extremely selfish, extremely self-destructive, but he couldn't help himself. He had watched Sherlock for a year, never once gathering the courage to talk to him; he couldn't talk to him. The only reason he was allowed to talk to Mike and Greg was that they were already in relationships, and had no way of "damaging" John, as his father so sweetly put it. When Harry had come out as gay and ran away, his father hadn't taken it well. He was used to it now, making excuses and feigning sickness in the aftermath of his father's rage. Bruises, cuts, sometimes even fractures. Gingerly, John rubbed the side of his neck which still hurt and was little purple from a few days ago. If he was going to keep Sherlock, even only secretly in his phone, he was going to have to be extremely careful.
(04:45) People generally leave me alone, and I'm fine with it. I'm fine being alone. I don't need anyone. SH
(14:17) Not gonna happen. And yes, I’m 17, like I already told you. Why is it so hard to believe? Because I don’t know every stupid slang word? SH
"Oh, that old thing? It is resting safely with a 'Greg Lestrade' of Scotland Yard. Did you really think I would allow him to have a gun in our home? I confiscated it upon his arrival. The one he has is a fake." Mycroft pauses for a moment. "Sentiment really HAS made you slow."
Sherlock gently pulled him down on top of himself and kissed him senseless, his hands firm on John’s buttocks, grinding their hips together. John swore he could see fireworks.
‘Serbia,’ Sherlock answered and pulled away from John’s scrutinizing gaze. Silently he discarded the rest of his clothes and strode into the shower, turning the hot water on and letting it wash over him, softening his stiff muscles and joints. He heard John exit the bathroom and close the door behind him, and his barely contained panic came bubbling to the surface again. He had to bite down on his hand hard to not let out a loud sob as stinging tears formed in his eyes. He was so
"Lost two, actually" Mycroft replies dismissively before he continues. "What do you want, Sherlock?"
(12:20) No, Sherlock, Christ, no. That's not it at all. But I really, really can't tell you. I'm sorry. You can call me H, though
Some part of John realized that Sherlock would probably notice that his bedsheets weren't arranged in the same way that he had left them, but he didn't want to think about that now.
Silver stripes lined Sherlock’s pale back; there were narrow scars and broad ones, long ones and short ones. Some had healed poorly, John saw. Those were eerily pale and looked to be painful still. The rest had healed relatively well and showed no signs of previous infection. John couldn’t stop staring.
(11:25) Observed? What, you just looked at her and knew? Also will add mental note, Susan is not a friend of yours :)
(13:12) So now you're angry with me? You are the one who slept in my bed although I told you THREE times not to touch anything. I should be angry with you. SH
At 05:53 John is out of the front door with all his belongings packed in a trolley and a pulse of over 120 beats per minute. His left hand is shaking and twitching nervously but he clenches and unclenches it, willing himself to take a deep breath and calm down.
The early morning summer sun warms his neck as he wanders along the country road with something akin to determination. He isn’t sure where he’s going, exactly, but he knows that he needs to get as far away from Sherlock as possible. His phone feels heavy in the pocket of his jeans.
(05:30) I don’t know. Neither. Your father belongs in prison, and you shouldn’t need to give up your studies because of him. That’s just not right. SH
For a moment, Sherlock couldn't bring himself to utter a single world, staring at the dark-haired, rather tall man standing in front of him, unable to remove his eyes from the sharp jawline, trying not to focus on the smirk playing on his full lips.
Pulling his fingers through his already slightly grey hair--he was only in his twenties--he sighed and pondered his options. He could give in to Sherlock's demands and risk his newly acquired position at the Yard, or he could ignore him. The result would be the same either way; Sherlock always got his way.
(19:02) Not for a while. There's a library down the hall if you get bored. You can also watch telly, I believe that's more your thing. There's one in your room behind the cabinet doors. SH
John had no way of telling. Gently he pulled Sherlock’s face closer to his own and pushed their lips together gingerly.
John awakes to the sound of thunder, loud rumbling startling him from his restless sleep. Harry’s living room lights up momentarily, casting shadows around him where he is laying on his back on the hard couch. He sighs heavily and shifts to an upright position.
But this time he was on the receiving end of attraction and his mind was running on overdrive, trying to make sense of what was happening, his brain registering the firm pressure of the boy's lips on his. Sherlock melted in the sensation of Victor's tongue against his, the tip of it moving along his lips. His lungs burning in his chest, he felt a rush of heat flooding him from head to toe, the new sensations sending tiny sparks along his spine.
He pressed send and pushed his phone into his back pocket again, opting to take a shower, desperate to relieve some of the pressure and anger that was gradually building inside him. He stomped off into the bathroom, slamming the door for good measure, and sank down on the cold tiles, his head resting against the wall.
He’s back in the bathroom, staring into the mirror, looking at the bathtub reflected in it. Sherlock spins around on his heels and settles his gaze on the victim. A woman. Mid-40s. Sherlock shoots a look at her left hand. No ring. A boyfriend? A girlfriend? Sherlock takes her phone in his hand and scrolls through her text messages and emails. No affectionate messages, no endearments. No partner, then.
(04:04) Yes. I mean, just looking, nothing weird about it. Listening to rants in class. That thing. Definitely nothing gay or anything. H
‘I know’ he simply replied, too nervous and too scared to say anything else. He instead settled for comfortable silence as he watched her take another drag from her cigarette.
John let go of Sherlock’s face and turned the shower off, moving to the tower rack and handing Sherlock a dry towel. He wrapped it gently around his shoulders and grabbed him around his waist, gently lifting him to a standing position.
‘Can you walk?’ he asked, and Sherlock nodded. John led him out of the bathroom and to Sherlock’s bedroom, where he sat him down on the bed.
Thrumming the fingers of his left hand impatiently against his thigh, Sherlock opened his text conversation with Greg, scolding himself for not having double-checked the number. He should have known that even such a simple task was beyond Greg's capabilities.
Fighting the sick feeling swirling inside him, Sherlock closes his eyes and enters his mind palace. He needs to solve the case. It’s the only way he can keep John safe.
The stranger flicked his thumb over the roll on the lighter and a small flame erupted. Sherlock took a cigarette between his lips and leaned down, sucking in deeply as the tip hit the flame, his eyes never leaving the other man's.
'Sherlock, I really do have more important things to do than to look after your pretend boyfriend' Mycroft replies with an exasperated sigh.
He turns, and just before the light goes out in front of his eyes, he swears he sees gorgeous dark curls lining a worried frown.
Gently, he set his phone aside on Sherlock's night stand, and sat down on the bed. The smell of Sherlock was already soothing him and he gently laid his head down on Sherlock's pillow, taking a deep breath.
"Excellent," Victor purred again and hooked his arm in Sherlock's, practically dragging him along the street. He took the cigarette out of Sherlock's mouth and put it to his own lips while regarding Sherlock hungrily.
"Just leave me alone and go enjoy that breakfast buffet which I'm sure you're already salivating over."
"Need a light, baby?" the stranger said as he reached the café and held his lighter out beneath Sherlock's face.
Before Sherlock could think about what had just happened, Victor reached into his back pocket, pulling out a pen and paper. He quickly scribbled his phone number and gave it to Sherlock, leaning in and kissing his cheek.
He’s sitting in St. Bart’s lab, the desk before him a mess, piled with case files and papers, littered with empty coffee cups. He has gone through every piece of information about the bathtub murders, analysed every bit of data, and examined the evidence under his microscope over and over again, but he still can’t understand why the victims were killed, or what their position in the criminal organisation was.
John is growing desperate. He doesn't understand why Sherlock won't see him, and it hurts. He thought that they had connected on some level but he was starting to think that maybe he'd been wrong. He spends most of his time at the Holmes estate lying on his back on his bed and occasionally eating when Mrs. Hudson brings him something. He chain smokes, hoping it will help still his itchy nerves.
Sherlock tosses the phone onto the table and buries his head into his hands. His skin is itching, as if small insects are crawling under it, trying to eat their way out to the surface, and he can feel the exhaustion wearing him down, fogging his mind. He hates Mycroft. Sherlock hates his condescending words, his ability to make him feel inferior, to make him feel like a child. His brother’s stinging words echo in his head, playing over and again in his mind.
The window. There’s a window in the bathroom, covered by a thin, almost transparent curtain. Sherlock takes a step closer, opens the curtain slightly, and peeks through the window. Trees. A few cars. More trees. A young girl walking her dog. A calm neighbourhood. Irrelevant.
Sherlock had already given up hope of ever hearing from the mysterious H again, and felt his heart rate speed up a little when he saw that the text was from him.
John stretched out on his back in Sherlock's bed, not wanting to leave it just yet. He hadn't felt safe since he was a little boy and his mother was still alive. But the scent and the presence that were both so very Sherlock had lulled him to sleep. He rolled over and buried his face in Sherlock's pillow.
as well. It was like adding insult to injury. John was dying a slow, hormone-induced death and Sherlock just kept on existing. Just like that. It was unfair, to say the least.
(09:10) John. 4. Number four. 4 victims. What do you know about number four and roses? Is there any connection? Do some research. SH
(10:05) Well, Mrs Hudson changes the bed linens every third day—she’s irritatingly pedantic. The bed doesn’t smell like you anymore. SH
Sherlock's first reaction was to open his mouth and tell the creep to leave him alone, not having the patience to deal with another idiot, but just as he was about to spit the words, his eyes caught sight of the stranger in front of him and his mouth snapped shut.
[14:36] Mary! I had a great time too. Did I really sing Bohemian Rhapsody in front of everyone? Dinner sounds good. JW
But his heart kept pounding in his chest, ignoring his feeble attempts to slow down its rate, and Sherlock became more and more aware of the fact that he was extremely turned on.
He feels pathetic. He is pathetic. He’s lying in his bed like a heartbroken teenager, wishing John was there inside his arms instead of the pillow that is damp with his tears. Sherlock knows that he should be in Bart’s lab, trying to find clues, evidence, or anything at all that could help him to solve the case and find Moriarty, but he can’t bring himself to move.
"Nah, just moved here, transferring to West Bank after the summer," he said with a shrug. "Need to scout my territory, ya' know?"
‘You- I understand if you wouldn’t want to be around me after—you were never meant to see this and, I-
(07:30) Look, what I said before, John. I meant it. My brother could help you, but I need you to go to the police. You have to tell them. SH
(17:20) Oh, please. Do keep up, John! What is it that you don't understand? Criminals. People who want to commit crimes. He's a spider. A spider at the center of a criminal web. SH
They had solved more crimes together than John could count, but the criminals of London never ceased to fight for dominance, providing an endless stream of–a bit not good—entertainment for Sherlock. When Lestrade had called that afternoon, John wasn’t sure what he had expected; he never knew what to expect when it came to Sherlock. He certainly hadn’t expected this, however.
Groaning in frustration, Sherlock ran his right hand through his unruly curls, failing to notice the young man who had started approaching him from across the street.
Sherlock had never dreamed, never thought it possible that another human being would be attracted to him. The thought of someone like Victor being interested in a pathetic little freak like him felt too good to be true.
John tilted his face enough to allow Sherlock better access to his neck, and he licked a long streak down his sternocleidomastoid muscle. Unable to suppress a shudder, John's body trembled, but Sherlock didn't seem to pay that any mind. Instead, his hands had come up into John's hair, and they were tugging at his strands hard enough for it to be painful, but not quite so painful that it hurt. Unable to see Sherlock’s face properly in the dim lighting, he closed his eyes, adamant to remember as many details from their encounter as possible, as it was very likely this would be their first
Hunched over his microscope, Sherlock is sitting in Bart’s lab, looking at one of the bathwater samples, trying to find anything that could bring him closer to Moriarty, but he finds nothing. The case seems impossible to solve, and he’s frustrated, and tired, and it doesn’t help at all that he can’t get John Watson out of his mind. John is messing with his thoughts, invading his mind palace, and stealing his attention away from what matters the most. All that matters to him—all that should matter to him—is the work, and now he’s pining for John like a hormone-riddled teenager, pining for a boy who will never be interested in him, not in the way Sherlock wants him to.
2017 UPDATE: lots of  things have been going on and the fanfiction writing has been put on hold for a very long time. Our sincerest apologies for the time in between chapters. Hopefully we'll be able to push more content out soon! Love!
‘John,’ was all Sherlock could manage, and it was all John needed to hear to understand that the world would keep spinning and keep revolving around Sherlock, but that Sherlock would revolve around him, too.
(00:32) John, all of the victims belonged to a secret criminal organisation called Order of Roses. I believe that's why the bathwater was rose-scented. It was a reference to the name. SH
Sherlock felt a warm fluttering in the pit of his stomach. Knowing that someone had been watching him and listening to him made a tickle of excitement grow inside him, a new feeling to him that almost felt dangerous in some inexplicable way. He wasn't used to positive attention.
(10:34) It's not! They choose not to believe me although I'm right. I'm always right. But I lack proof! The killer's clever, cleverer than Scotland Yard. SH
He isn’t going to meet his recruitment officer for another hour, but he didn’t want to stay in the house longer than necessary. Harry had cried when he had said goodbye and he really wasn’t good with those kind of things. So he had left early, telling a white lie. Now that he is outside, though, he isn’t really sure what to do.
This, as John had named the situation in his mind, was very problematic indeed. For their case, Sherlock and John would have to go undercover. They wouldn’t have to go undercover in just any place either. No, that would be far too convenient and un-Sherlockian. This time, they had to act undercover at a swingers club, and they would have to act as couple.
"For God's sake, Sherlock. I'm not giving you his number. Will you please let me drink my coffee in peace?"
(22:10) At least I wouldn’t be the one who gets too drunk and needs to be admitted to a hospital. SH
(10:31) The killer's getting bored, and well, I can't really blame him for that. He craves appreciation. Applause. He wants to attract attention. He wants the police to know that these are not just suicides. This is only the beginning, something is about to change. SH
And now here he was, loitering outside a nearby café, still completely and utterly bored, observing the passers-by to pass the time.
Sherlock knows that John will be angry. Hell, John will probably never forgive him, but he’s willing to take the risk. If John is going to hate him, Sherlock can live with that. It will hurt and it will metaphorically break his heart, but at least he won’t need to bear John’s death on his conscience.
"Shut the fuck up Harry, or I WILL smother you in your sleep" John shouts away from the phone. "Sorry 'bout that. Mmmm, if you mean that, why are you avoiding me all the time? John slurs. “’S not like I*m going to stab you.”
(11:20) Oh, I think it was very appropriate, considering all three of them, Susan, her boyfriend and the one she cheated with, were present. SH
The last message was perhaps a little too much to hope for, John knew. The Sherlock in his phone didn’t seem too eager to talk to him.
(08.57) Not much. No one at Scotland Yard has ever heard of this Moriarty before. No new victims, nothing. At least, they finally believe me. SH
Sherlock managed to crawl back to John’s face before collapsing on his body, their breaths erratic and hearts pounding, a slick layer of sweat covering their chests and foreheads. Opening one eye lazily, Sherlock’s eyes golden in his post coital glow, he licked his lips, uttering the words that would change their lives forever.
Sherlock was hardly paying any attention to the commotion around them, his eyes focused on finding the man they were here to gather information about. Quickly spotting him in a more secluded corner, he dragged John with him, trying to make it seem like they were searching for an available spot for themselves. All beds were taken, the only available space being a sofa in the far back, next to a bald man in his forties. He was looking at his phone, seemingly texting, waiting for somebody to arrive. Sherlock pulled John a little closer to the man on the sofa, standing in between two marble pillars, the stones on either side obscuring them from curious eyes like a heavy curtain. The sounds were muffled, but John was already too aroused and terrified to think of anything but how absolutely stunning Sherlock looked, his lips parted, his fingers absentmindedly running along the soft bottom lip.
(09:37) In order to catch the offender, I need to ask you a few questions. Meet me at Charing Cross Station in thirty minutes. SH
intoxicated, he came home and Sherlock was standing in the living room intently watching him. John could feel his scanning eyes taking in everything there was possibly to know about him. Drunk? Slightly. Date? No. Drinking alone? Yes.
Finally, he felt the vibrating surface of his phone under his fingertips, and grabbed it. A quick glance at the phone screen made his annoyance skyrocket. Cursing under his breath, Sherlock pressed the button to answer the call.
he had done had been to protect John - his John – but now John would leave and Sherlock would be on his own again. Deeply, utterly alone like he had been in his years away. It had all been for nothing.
(10:11) Crime??? I haven't reported any crime, not that I know of anyway. And the Yard?? Are you like a police officer?
“Moriarty sends his regards. He was wrong about you, you know? You are just a useless addict. There’s nothing extraordinary in that.” She crumples her nose in disgust, shooting one last glare at Sherlock, and exits the room.
‘You’re an idiot,’ Sherlock finally breathed, and suddenly Sherlock wasn’t the one pressed up against the door—it was John. And suddenly Sherlock’s lips were on his neck and their bodies were pressed tightly against each other, and John let out a barely contained groan. Then their lips were meeting and Sherlock was kissing him hungrily, his tongue trailing across John’s bottom lip. John opened his mouth slightly to allow better access and Sherlock eagerly followed, his left hand pulling on John’s hair and the other one trailing its way down to his lower back. Their erections pressed flush together eliciting a moan from them both, and John felt light headed and very warm.
No, he simply couldn’t. Sherlock was out there somewhere doing God-knows-what, possibly something dangerous, and John was stuck here thinking about what could have been if he had just fought a little harder.
(03:27) Which part of it? You missing me or you having something in your eye? Might want to have a licensed doctor take a look, I'm hardly qualified. SH
John stepped away from his back and pulled Sherlock around to meet him. His eyes were riddled with fear, uncertainty and disgust, and it startled John to see Sherlock express such emotions. He placed his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks again hoping it wouldn’t startle him. Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned into the touch slightly.
(06:12) If you can make Scotland Yard believe that they're dealing with a serial killer instead of several people just committing serial suicides, then yes, you can help me. SH
Sherlock knows that there’s something important he has ignored, an important clue that has been staring him in the face the whole time.
(21:32) No, I haven’t. I have more important things to do than rot my brain watching some tedious TV show. SH
He was supposed to find John before he met the woman so he could warn John, tell him that he had figured it out, solved the case. But he didn't. He had been too stupid and too slow, and Sherlock knows that John is going to pay for it.
(10:21) My source must have made a mistake then. Regrettable, but not quite surprising. I apologise for any inconvenience. SH
(11:30) Susan uses a very distinctive perfume, so it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on when suddenly Mark starts smelling like her. SH
(10:09) Was it something I did? If it’s the thumbs on my desk, I can clean them up. It’s the eyeballs, isn’t it? SH
Bright, cold, fluorescent lamps hung from the ceiling in the room he was currently in, and the walls were dull and white. He was propped on a chair with his hands back bound and his feet tied to the legs. There were no windows and no indication to where he was being held, and the only other object in the room with him was an oak table on which a small radio stood. It was blaring The Four Season’s ‘December, 1963’, preventing him from listening to sounds from anywhere else. He
[14:29] It's not your duty. It's in fact none of your business. I'll always find a new one. You're wasting your oh-so-precious time. Shouldn't you be eating your afternoon cake? SH
Sherlock let out a chuckle. “There was,” he said, his voice low and rough with desire, “I solved it when Lestrade called.”
Stalking off toward his bedroom door, John quickly entered and slammed the door shut behind him, slowly lowering himself into a sitting position, his back resting against the wooden surface. He basically tumbled backward when the door suddenly opened behind him, falling right into the crotch of one Sherlock Holmes.
John wakes up in Sherlock’s bed, and for a short moment he is blissfully unaware of the events that took place the previous night. He stretches out like a clumsy cat and reaches out his phone which is lying on top of the night stand. His fingers run across the shattered glass, and he remembers everything. He is on his own again.
Harry opens the door with a wide smile which quickly fades when her eyes dart over John. There are dark circles underneath his eyes, and they are red and swollen. His knuckles are white from clenching onto his training bag and there is tension in his jaw that wasn’t there before. Harry quickly ushers him inside and closes the door behind him. She doesn’t dare ask and he really doesn’t feel like talking.
couldn't tell Sherlock that he had been so close to ending it all when his mobile phone had vibrated in his pocket just a few days earlier.
Without thinking about what he was doing, he leaned over to the left and reached for his razor that he used to shave. He pressed it against his inner left arm and quickly pulled it sideways, surprised when a thin red line appeared on his skin. Dropping the razor, he looked at his arm with fascination. A small drop of blood had started pooling in the corner of the small cut, and he squeezed it gingerly until the surface tension broke and the droplet started rolling. Finally, if only for a few minutes, his thoughts stopped spiraling.
It wasn’t like him to be reduced to this mess. Normally he would shrug it off and soldier on, bracing himself for whatever would be thrown at him, but about
Greg had met John in his PE class in his last year of high school, and despite John being a junior, they had soon become friends. They shared an interest in sports, and John's easy-going manner and humility made it hard not to like him. John was one of the very few popular kids who didn't look down on others even though he could have had any girl--or guy for that matter--he chose. And although Greg was too embarrassed to admit it out loud, John felt like the little brother he never had, and maybe that's why he couldn't help but be worried about the boy.
fault that things had become a little off between them. John understood, though. It wasn't easy to keep in touch with someone who was so weak and pathetic, who couldn't even please his own father, no matter how hard he tried. Sherlock was far too intelligent to waste his time on John and his petty problems. Still, it hurt a little.
‘I- I understand if you will want to leave,’ Sherlock said quietly, pulling John from his trance. ‘It’s all fine, I- I will adjust.’
(10:13) Is this some kind of joke? I got your number from a reliable source, you reported a crime last Wednesday at thirteen past eight in the evening. SH
find out. He had planned in great detail exactly what he would wear and how he would conceal it; he would wear long sleeves during the days, and never sleep without a t-shirt on. He would start locking the door while he was showering. It had been a foolproof plan, up until the point it
Harry keeps not asking, and John keeps drinking. They sit like that, John on the floor with his back against her couch and Harry on top of it, a glass in their hands and a bottle of whiskey on the floor. When the glasses empty, they refill them in silence. There is something comforting about it and John can finally feel his tense muscles relax. He clears his throat.
Sherlock could only think of two possibilities, both of which made his heart sink. The stranger either must have mixed him up with someone else or it had to be some kind of sick joke. People just didn't like him. Hell, they barely tolerated him.
Just as he pressed the send button, he realised, a fraction of a second too late, that he was texting a complete stranger.
John removed his coat and hung it on the coat rack, and then very deliberately ignored Sherlock and went into his bedroom, closing the door behind him. Sherlock’s gaze had been very intense and John hadn’t known what to do with himself but run off and hide like a scared animal.
Startled by the anger in H's voice, Sherlock stayed quiet for a moment, the sudden change in him making something lurch uncomfortably in his stomach. "I was just thinking about someone I met. Nothing important."
Sherlock could have sworn his heart stopped beating for a moment. Blankly, he stared at his phone screen, reading the three words over and over again, as if to make sure that his eyes weren't lying to him. No one had ever told him that they liked him. He was rude and obnoxious, certainly not the type of person people liked.
Then the thought hits him like a punch in the stomach. John wouldn’t be in danger in the first place if it weren’t for him and he has to swallow hard against the lump in his throat to keep the acrid bile from rising into his mouth. It’s all his fault. John might die, and it’s his fault.
"Oh, yeah... just some guy," Sherlock said, trying to appear nonchalant, attempting to turn the conversation away from himself. "Why are you drinking?"
John was so desperate to find out more about Sherlock; he wanted to understand him. He had a primal urge to do so. But he was also afraid of what he might see.
It was all the reassurance John needed. He pushed Sherlock off of him and backwards until the back of his thighs hit John’s bed, then pushed him. John straddled Sherlock’s legs with his thighs and bent down and kissed him again. He bit Sherlock’s lower lip and was rewarded with his hips bucking upward. He pulled his fingers through Sherlock’s impossibly soft hair as he kissed him, then beckoned for Sherlock to take his shirt of as pulled his own over his head. Sherlock was quick to comply.
(03:55) And what might that be? Not sure if it has occurred to you, but I haven’t met your family. SH
There it is, the finish! We (sherlockianworld and elle_m) would like to thank all the people who have given us comments and kudos. Words can't express how grateful we are. Your kind words and reactions have been what has kept us writing, and kept us striving to be better and do better. It has been hell of a ride, but we sincerely hope that you've enjoyed it. We sure have.
John had no idea what to make of it, but he knew, in the furthest depths of his soul, that this couldn’t end well. There was no way he was going to be able to suppress his emotions if they had to act like a couple, and definitely not in a bloody swinger’s club. Realizing he was becoming slightly hysterical, he tried to ignore the confounded look Sherlock gave him as they rode in the cab to their location together, his left knee twitching nervously. The fact that they hadn’t really talked about this properly didn’t help calm his nerves, either. John really had no idea what they were going to do. How far were they going to go to ensure their cover remained intact? Were they going to hold hands? It was a little silly, of course. They would have to do more than hold hands to blend in with the crowd of people in various states of undress. Would they… kiss? John just didn’t know.
He didn't need to convince himself further, because he had already made the decision. He opened John's contact information and copied the phone number. He pasted it into the text conversation he had with Sherlock, which pretty much involved Sherlock calling him stupid, and pressed send.
"I can tell you don't. Alright, so I might be a little drunk. But I do miss you when you're not around."
Sherlock chuckles, hoping John can’t hear the nervous tone in his voice. “I don’t know, John. I—I’m not sure if it’s a good idea.”
Closing his eyes for a moment, Sherlock breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth, in an attempt to quiet his mind of the worried thoughts. He needs to focus.
"What is your business with Sherlock Holmes?" the man said. His eyes were cold and his demeanour was collected.
Sherlock listened to the beeping sound of the disconnected line, too stunned to lower the phone from his ear.
Absentmindedly, Sherlock reached for a cigarette, placed it in his mouth, and started looking for his lighter, annoyance creeping up on him as he realised that he had forgotten it at the station.
John awoke from harsh pounding on his bedroom door. His head was throbbing and the room was spinning, but he didn't have time to think about that at the moment, because two seconds later his father entered the bedroom, and he was furious.
Dumbfounded, and extremely aroused, John tentatively opened his mouth as Sherlock crushed their lips together once again, their bodies close, but not quite pressed together. John’s hands moved up into Sherlock’s hair, and he blamed it entirely on the fact that they had to keep their cover and blend in. He was playing his part.
(10:39) They don't think it's important that the woman was left-handed. They told me to get a hobby. A hobby, John! SH
John was starting to panic. He should never have opened his phone knowing damn well how drunk he was. This was bad.
He misses his friends back at uni. They made him forget all of his troubles, and it made him sleep a little better at night. He hasn't slept in Sherlock's bed since he left the note. He is tired.
He hails a cab that happens to pass him by and tells the driver Harry’s address. She really is all he has left, now.
‘Sherlock,’ he interrupted him in between kisses. ‘You don’t—this isn’t, you’re married to your wo-‘
After deducing some harsh truths about Greg’s colleagues and rather loudly informing everyone of them, the man had shooed him away, telling him to shut his smart-arse mouth and sod off.
He hadn’t gotten much sleep at all; his head had been spinning with thoughts and questions. Sherlock was gone, it hurt like fucking hell, and now he was off to start a new life—possibly to never return—and John was utterly
Then there was his bed. It was undone and messy; it was something John recognized in himself. Light sleeper too, then.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Greg's text, not even bothering to reply. "Unbelievable,” he muttered to himself with annoyance.
Blood rushed to Sherlock's cheeks as he read Victor's reply, the notion of being called baby instead of freak making something warm bloom in his chest.
John's phone buzzes in his pocket and he is startled from his restless sleep. It had been bright daylight by the time he had finally managed to fall asleep. He read the text message. It was from Mary. He hovered over the reply button uncertainly.
Being pulled further into their corner, John suddenly found himself harshly pushed backward, staggering into the wall, his breath leaving his chest as he collided with the hard surface.
(03:12) And to answer your question, it’s obvious. The language you use says you’re in your teens. You’re going to a party at your friend’s, not to a bar—you’re underage. Then there’s Sannah. You’re asking a girl out on a date and you focused on describing her appearances, fit and blonde. That suggests you’re a hormone-driven teenager. Possibly 16, but I’d say 17. SH
He feels warm as the drug enters his bloodstream, flowing through his veins, heat spreading through his body, and his eyes flutter closed.
“Sherlock?” John asked as he took a step backward into the room. Sherlock took a step forward and closed the door with his foot. Fighting to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s face instead of his muscular abdomen and pale, translucent skin, he saw the small movement the tall man made, the tip of his tongue grazing across his own bottom lip.
John was in an equally dreadful state. Water was dripping down from his short hair and into his eyes, and his trousers – which were normally loosely fitted – clung to his skin tightly. He was angry, too, because Sherlock had disappeared off on his own after John had lost him behind a corner. It was only fair, John thought, that he was allowed to boss Sherlock around and hopefully avoid either of them catching pneumonia. Sherlock had been too tired to protest and too tired to think clearly.
Mycroft chuckles lightly over the phone line. "What do you know about anything, aside from your petty murders? Speaking of which, the reagent of Morocco is on the other line. Something about 'national importance', I believe. Bye, brother dear."
Opposite the books stood a fancy, dark-brown desk, and on top of it stood a microscope, petri dishes and a number of test tubes. There was also a gas burner and what looked to be a small container of hair. John chuckled softly at himself. Of course he had been genuine about his experimenting.
‘To hell with Irene Adler,’ Sherlock repeated as he nibbled on John’s earlobe and John swallowed loudly. ‘You are
Before he realises it, he’s running. He runs and runs, stumbling along unending corridors, his feet thumping down endless stairs. Thump. Thump. Thump.
He knew he was treading on dangerous territory, his brother's countless warnings ringing in his ears, but the idea of being wanted by someone made his heart race rapidly, a wave of heat flooding through his body, settling low in his stomach.
Lately, Greg had noticed a change in John, even though he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Ever since the summer holidays had started, the boy had become quieter, more distant, and anytime Greg happened to mention John's family or ask something about his parents, he became evasive and changed the subject. John was spending more and more time alone, always turning down invitations to parties and always making excuses for having to leave early. He didn't seem like his old self who had always been surrounded by friends.
Sherlock stops in the door frame, his hand freezing in mid-air. For a moment, he can't bring himself to do anything but stare at his bed, and at the body that is hidden under his bed sheets. John Watson is sleeping in his bed, his chest rising and falling to the rhythm of his steady breathing, his lips slightly apart, and Sherlock can’t bring himself to do anything but stare. He can feel his heart pounding, threatening to escape his chest, and something warm flutters in his stomach, as John suddenly mumbles something meaningless in his sleep, and in that moment Sherlock realises that he’s screwed. He's utterly and completely screwed.
Stunned but not surprised, Greg listened to the beeping sound of the disconnected line for a moment before lowering the phone from his ear.
Sherlock's fingers hovered over the keys as he tried to think of a reply. His heart thudding against his ribs, he slowly started typing, painfully aware that no one else had ever made him feel so vulnerable, so naked.
"You'll thank me later," Sherlock said in his usual cocky tone, ending the call without saying goodbye.
Sherlock chuckles nervously. "Yes well, I'd like to see you try... John, I'm not avoiding you. I'm just busy with the case, and--"
(11:45) No one really. As you might have noticed, people don't really like me. Besides, I don't mind being alone. SH
He needs to breathe the London air and be around normal people for a while. The Holmes estate is only a few minutes out of town, yet it feels like a different timezone. Hell, a different universe.
He rubs his hands across his face and throws his phone aside next to him on the bed. It is always him chasing after Sherlock like a maniac. Otherwise there is radio silence.
“Get Sherlock? What’s that supposed to mean? You said his name was Moriarty? I’ve never heard that name.”
“Sherlock, wha—” John began, but he was interrupted by the press of another set of lips on his, and John froze, unable to respond. The detective slid his tongue across his bottom lip, but still, John found himself completely unable to move, his mind trying to catch up with the fact that Sherlock had just kissed him.
With those words, Sherlock pulled John down again, their lips locking together, Sherlock’s fingers unbuttoning his shirt. John shrugged it off, revealing his muscular chest and abdomen, the faint silver tattered skin of his scar standing out on his left shoulder in the dim light.
(18:34) Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not a drug dealer. Shouldn’t you be texting Sannah Hannigan? I’m sure she would be delighted. SH
Then Sherlock’s hand came down between them, gripping both their cocks firmly in his hand, and John moaned Sherlock’s name. The friction between them was too much and not enough all at once and John found himself desperately bucking into the skilled movement of Sherlock’s palm.
“So this--” John gestured between Sherlock’s naked form and his fully clothed one, “was to get me in bed?”
"Good morning to you, too. I know you're desperate to solve this case, and in case you have forgotten, I'm your best chance of doing so. And technically speaking, you won't be breaking any laws if you just happen to forget to lock the door to your office when you leave for your post-coffee trip to the loo."
'I will have someone review the appropriate CCTV footage in search of one John Watson' he said, and added 'we will find him.'
Sherlock gives his head a violent shake, knowing that panicking is the worst thing he can do in this situation. The worst thing he can do to John.
(02:29) No, you didn’t offend me. I got a call from Scotland Yard. Just got caught up, that’s all. SH
The sudden beat of sounds against John’s eardrum pulls him from his deep, dreamless sleep. His head is groggy, but he doesn’t recall downing any liquor the prior day. With a great deal of effort, he opens his right eye but closes it immediately as bright light hits his cornea, and he groans with pain. When he tries to lift his hand to rub his sensitive eyes gingerly, he finally notices…
A little confused, John stood and pulled his trousers, boxers and socks down, before climbing back in between Sherlock’s spread legs. His cock was resting beautifully against the alabaster skin, the head leaking with precome. Pressing their lips together again, John suddenly felt Sherlock shift, and suddenly he was the one on his back, the detective looming above him, licking his lips.
Noticing Sherlock was entirely nude underneath the blue fabric, John suddenly released Sherlock and grabbed him by the hand, pushing him down on his bed, climbing on top in between his knees, their lips locking together again. With nimble hands, John pushed the blue robe off his shoulders, and Sherlock sat for a moment, shrugging it off entirely.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open and John pulled away quickly, staggering backwards and stuttering apologetically.
Sherlock stopped breathing for a moment. He knew that he could always deny it, say that H didn't know him, that he was wrong and had no right to make such assumptions, but deep inside he knew that there was truth to his words.
(07:42) Oh, I’m sure my parents could recommend you some therapist if that’s what you want. After all, they made me see all the best ones in town when I was younger. Apparently I’m a lost cause. SH
John rolls onto his side in Sherlock's bed, desperately fighting the sadness that makes his chest clench. Sherlock's smell is neither soothing nor doing anything to cheer his dark mood. There is only one person John has actually managed to fall head-over-heels for, and he can never be his.
Breaking away from their kiss, Sherlock placed his hands on either side of John’s head, his mouth coming down to nip at his neck, biting gentle marks onto John’s sensitive, flushed skin. John was fighting the urge to moan loudly, aware that Sherlock would know immediately that he wasn’t acting. It was difficult to not let his urges take over, so very difficult.
It is 05:21 when John finally moves from the couch and into the bathroom to shower. His head is pounding and his eyes are bloodshot, and he thinks to himself that he is s never going to drink with Harry again. He knows that is a lie as soon as the thought reaches his consciousness, but he is too depressed and too tired to worry about what it might mean, or how alike his father he is becoming. John shudders and turns the shower tap on.
He slammed John into the wall again one last time, leaving one last good punch to his side, and John swore he heard something crack disturbingly. He hunched over and fell onto his knees, his arms clutching his sides, little droplets of blood running from his cheek onto the floor. Without looking back, his dad stomped out of the room and slammed the door behind him.
He walks over to the door and locks it before picking up his bag from the floor. He rummages through it, and with shaking fingers pulls out a small flat box. Sherlock slides down the door until he’s sitting on the floor, and for a brief moment he closes his eyes. He’s not proud of what he’s going to do, but he needs it. Drugs will calm his overwhelmed mind and help him to reach a solution; they will help him to concentrate on the work, and make him forget the boy for a while.
Pinching his eyes closed, Sherlock forces himself to focus. There has to be something he has missed, something he has forgotten. Think. Think. Think!
John laughs. Louder than he’s laughed in a long time. “Alright, you prick. But can you stay? Just… hang up when you get uncomfortable?”
Slowly, Sherlock climbed off him, turning around on all fours, slowly crawling backward until his face was aligned with John’s cock, and his own hard member was hanging in front of John’s face. Holding his weight up by his forearms, Sherlock experimentally swirled his tongue around John’s shaft, causing a loud moan from John, which was quickly stifled by the sensation of a hot mouth around his cock. In unison, they started moving, their tongues swirling desperately against the other’s cock, the pressure in their groins buildings, their moans only partly stifled, saliva running from the corner of their mouths. Feeling the pressure building was almost unbearable, and Sherlock sucked down harder, John matching his movements, and in a moment they were both coming, their seed spilling into each others mouth, both lapping it up greedily.
John decides to sleep in his own bed that night. Before he goes, he leaves the new pair of purple socks on Sherlock's pillow. On a small paper he scribbles "The colour suits you. John" and gently sets it down next to the socks.
The thought of never talking to H again made Sherlock's chest feel tight, but at the same time he was afraid he would get hurt if he let his guard down. Sherlock had never let anyone get close, and the idea of trusting another person and letting them into his life frightened him beyond measure. He had learned early on that sentiment was a chemical defect and that other people were not to be trusted. But what if he was wrong? What if H was different? There was a tiny part of him that wanted to believe that H was worth taking a risk for.
Hi guys. Sorry for the massive delay in updates! We have been flooded in school work, personal life and we have both had severe writer's block. We haven't forgotten this story and it will be continued. Slow and steady wins the race, right?
Sherlock stares at the screen, hoping the ground would open up and swallow him. Why would John want to stay at his place?
John was crouching on the ground beside him, his left hand uncertainly hovering near Sherlock’s face. Sherlock opened his eyes and wished the ground beneath him would swallow him whole.
His thoughts are interrupted when a black car screeches into the alleyway through a sharp turn and stops in front of them, and the smile from his officer’s face fades.
With trembling hands, he unbuttoned his own jeans and took them and his boxers off, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. Then he unbuttoned Sherlock’s suit trousers and waited for Sherlock to take them off. He shivered at the sight of Sherlock.
He clenches his chest as he lets out a quiet sob, slumping down to sit in Sherlock's room, his back resting against the bedroom door. John lifts his knees up to his chest and rests his head on them, rocking himself back and forth. All the things that have happened to him fade to nothing in comparison to this gaping hole in his chest.
They were kissing and the pressure was building inside John’s body and then Sherlock’s lips were on John’s neck again and John just couldn’t hold it together anymore.
John lingered for a moment longer than perhaps socially acceptable, trying to take in all the pieces of information about Sherlock that were present between the four walls. He took one long last look before he closed the door behind him... and stood face-to-face with a young, costume-clad man.
Greg picked up his phone again, and he knew that he was close to giving in. Again. Opening his contacts he started scrolling. Donovan, some other colleagues he didn't know very well, and then a name that made him stop and hover. John Watson.
They hadn't really spoken since John's last incident, and John felt it rest like a heavy weight on his shoulders. Of course, it was
"Name’s almost as gorgeous as your face." Victor leaned in close against Sherlock's left ear, his breath tickling Sherlock's neck. "Say, fancy taking a stroll?"
Greg slumped back in his chair and was just reaching for his coffee when his phone buzzed again. And again. "Oh, c'mon", he groaned in frustration and picked up his phone, but before he even had a chance to click open the text messages, it started ringing.
without knocking and gently closed it behind him and John was certain this was the Devil punishing him for something. Sherlock was in his bedroom. Sherlock, in his bed room. Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlo-
No one had ever said anything like that to him before, and the fact that H had sounded so sincere baffled him, his mind unable to grasp why someone would care about how he felt.
He can feel Mary’s stare on his face as he holds his gaze down, waiting for him to answer, but Sherlock can’t bring himself to speak, his mouth impossibly dry, his thoughts spinning and tumbling in disarray. Why has Mary, John’s date Mary, John’s possible future—if not current already— girlfriend Mary, come to meet him? How did she find him? What does she want from him?
(17:32) Why would I be “shitting” you, as you so finely put it? No, I’m not Sannah Hannigan. Now please, I have more important things to do. SH
As Sherlock is lying on his back, his phone starts ringing, startling him. He stares at the screen, at the caller ID, and a flicker of panic makes his stomach twist. John’s calling him. John Watson, the stranger in his phone who has tolerated him for so long, is calling him. John’s been patient with him longer than anyone else ever has, and now Sherlock’s going to ruin it. He can’t control his spoken words. He’s certain he’ll say something that annoys John, something that makes him never want to text Sherlock again. He cringes. John is going to hate him, of that Sherlock is sure.
(10:37) One of the victims was shot in the right side of the head. And she was left-handed. Why would a left-handed woman shoot herself in the RIGHT side of her head? SH
The sight of Sherlock was breath-taking. His chest was pale and skinny yet muscular, and his lips were swollen and red from kissing. His pupils were dilated and he was panting slightly, his eyes fixed on John’s.
Sherlock is back at the second crime scene, standing in front of a window. He glances out through it, and sees the same woman, this time sitting on a bench. She has covered the most of her face with a newspaper, but her eyes gaze upward toward the window.
After a short moment he straightens his back—almost soldier-like—and starts walking down the paved sidewalk toward the set meeting location. It is in a fairly secluded part of town and soon John finds himself walking in circles just to make time lapse faster.
It had been the first time Sherlock had been kissed, and his mind struggled to process the experience, all the new sensations and feelings kicking his brain into overdrive.
Sherlock shakes his head, trying to clear his thoughts. Something is wrong. Very wrong. He has seen the woman before, but he doesn’t remember where.
(02:15) You really seem to enjoy wandering around dark streets alone. Don’t you have any friends? SH
Greg wasn't the type to play matchmaker, but something told him that Sherlock and John had the potential to become good friends, and if he was right, they would hopefully help to balance each other out.
Sherlock had felt fleeting attractions in the past but he had never acted on his desires, knowing that his feelings would not be reciprocated. He had learned early on that he was different, and that fact had been drilled into him by the constant bullying he had been enduring since secondary school.
Sherlock knew he was being reckless, but the strong arm holding him close and the delicious smell of the man's cologne were clouding his judgement.
Pinching the bridge of his nose, Greg closed his eyes and sighed, "I swear, one day you'll be the death of me."
[14:40] Oh, dear god. I'm not sure about this dinner thing anymore then. Don't think I can look you in the eyes anymore. JW
Sherlock had spent the whole morning at Scotland Yard, going through reports and helping Greg solve a few cases that had turned out to be child’s play, even though Greg had assured him several times that they were “impossibly difficult”. Due to the lack of challenge and mental stimulation, it had not taken long for Sherlock to get bored and start observing the people around him, not bothering to think about the appropriateness of letting everyone know who at the Yard was unfaithful to his husband, and who had a serious porn addiction.
Thrumming with nervous energy, Sherlock exits his mind palace. Disoriented, he rummages through the papers on the desk until he finds his mobile phone. With trembling fingers, his heart racing in his chest, Sherlock opens a new text message.
He meets a woman that evening; she is nice, beautiful and intelligent. Not in a Sherlock-way intelligent, but there is definitely something to her that catches his attention. He finds himself fascinated as he is sipping on his beer - the bartender was sloppy with checking IDs - opposite her in the bar, and Sherlock is fading to a distant buzz in the background. It's a nice change, considering he has been all that's on John's mind lately. He doesn't even feel his phone vibrating in his back pocket.
Sherlock stops running, his legs giving way underneath him. Gasping for air, he slumps to the ground, barely noticing the jolt of pain that travels up his legs as his knees collide with the hard surface. He can feel his heart thumping in his throat, the thud of its beat ringing in his ears. He curses between the gasps, slamming his fist into the ground. Too late. He was too late.
A loud buzzing penetrated Sherlock's consciousness, and it took a moment for his sleep-filled mind to clear enough to register that the buzzing sound was his phone. Groaning, he forced his eyes open, blinking in the bright light of the morning sun as he reached for his phone on the nightstand, his tired brain struggling to control his fumbling fingers. Sherlock let out another frustrated groan when his eyes caught his alarm clock--it was nine in the morning, and he had barely been asleep for three hours.
"Why do you care?" Sherlock asked, his question coming out more harshly than he had intended, embarrassed by the fact that some part of his brain very well wanted Victor to be his.
There was no denying that Sherlock was right about his being desperate--his consulting a high school student with no education in criminal justice whatsoever was definitely something only a desperate man would do--but he hadn't yet reached the point where he was desperate enough to risk losing his job.
Sherlock was lounging on the steps of their front porch, smoking a cigarette, when his phone  vibrated in his back pocket. Startled, he fished the phone out of his pocket, assuming Greg was working late and in need of his assistance. It wasn't unusual for Greg to text him late at night; the man knew that Sherlock always stayed up late and wanted to be kept up to date in case any new evidence was discovered or any progress regarding a case was made. But he was wrong, it wasn't Greg this time. The message was from H.
Maybe it was the fact that this was the most intimate moment they had ever shared, or maybe it was the fact that they were so
It hadn’t taken John long to realize his deeply rooted attraction for Sherlock. There was something in his slender figure and long, pale limbs that spoke directly to his groin. The way his cheekbones were highlighted in certain lightings, the way his dark, auburn curls lay chaotically across his forehead, and the way his silver eyes bore into John’s soul. John was completely, utterly lost to the powers of this married-to-his-work man. His Sherlock Holmes.
(03:27) Hey, Sherlock, I'm sorry, everything is really complicated, and I really shouldn't be talking to you... I might be a little drunk? You have every right to just block my number. H
"Yet you were sneaking around his room like some perverted villain. I will be watching you, John Watson."
More sobs wracked through his chest and he sank down to the floor, resting his back against the hard tiled wall. He was so deeply lost in himself that he didn’t notice that John had entered the bathroom until he was face to face with two concerned eyes.
Sherlock grabbed him by the hand and dragged them inside, John’s hands already moist with sweat. He desperately hoped Sherlock wouldn’t notice his erratic pulse, but he didn’t count on it; Sherlock wasn’t one to miss the details.
Greg looked at his phone and flicked through the text messages, unable to suppress an eye roll. He was not surprised to find that Sherlock was once again requesting something that would require him to break the law. Placing the untouched coffee on the desk, Greg sighed again and typed a reply to him: "You know I can't give you the victim's phone number. I would be breaking the law and could lose my job. And besides, it would be extremely unethical."
‘Sherlock,’ John said hesitantly, his both hands coming to rest on either of Sherlock’s cheeks. ‘Look at me.’ He beckoned Sherlock’s face upward gently. ‘Whatever you are thinking—it’s not true.’
(03:37) Is the party really so boring that you’re choosing to text a complete stranger? And no, of course not. SH
Not bothering to await Sherlock's reply, John quietly slipped from his room and down the stairs toward Sherlock's bedroom. He knew what he was supposed to do was wrong, and Sherlock would probably never forgive him.
John spent more time outside than he normally would have, but Sherlock didn’t seem to mind or wonder where he was. It was self-preservation really to get drunk and forget about Sherlock Sodding Holmes, or so John told himself at least.
Greg was about to take a sip of his coffee when his mobile phone buzzed for the fifth time in the past fifteen minutes. Even without looking, he knew exactly who was bothering him during his usual mid-morning coffee break. Sighing with resignation, he paused his coffee cup in mid-air and reached in his pocket for his phone. He knew there was no use trying to ignore Sherlock Holmes. He had learned the hard way that if he didn't reply to his texts, the boy would find another way to contact him--Sherlock had once stormed into his office during an important meeting with his boss when Greg had not answered his numerous calls.
(01:17) John, you don't need me. I'll just end up disappointing you again and again. I can't be the person you want me to be. SH
With each passing second, John is moving further and further away from him, and he can feel his mind going into shock. A bead of sweat rolls down his forehead, and feeling dizzy, Sherlock fumbles in the pockets of his coat with trembling fingers until he finds his mobile phone, growing more panicked as he notices that the battery is running low. Adrenaline coursing through his veins, Sherlock somehow manages to punch his brother's number and raise the phone to his ear despite his shaking hands.
The water is scolding as it pours down over him, and soon his shoulders are pink and aching. John doesn’t care much; he never has when it comes to pain. On some subconscious level he thinks he has always deserved it, and therefore hasn’t paid much mind to it. It is going to be useful in the military, but John doesn’t want to think about that now. He pushes all his thoughts away and closes his eyes, letting the water stream over his face and ears, and he tries to relax his tense muscles. It almost works.
As he heard the receding footsteps of his dad in the staircase, he slumped together on the floor and let his tears fall free.
Mycroft seemed momentarily stunned, but quickly recovered. "You think this is caring?" he scoffed with disdain. "This is minimising any inconvenience you may cause, should you spiral out of control again. You know what happened last time."
(11:02) Yes, you're allowed to explore, and no, we do not have dungeons. You might want to avoid my brother's room, though, unless you want to end up alone in a dark cell god knows where. SH
(11:03) Oh please, the class is full of jocks and popular kids, and judging by the way you text, you're more likely to be one of them than one of the so-called losers. SH
After several hours of hesitation, Sherlock had finally made up his mind, his whole body tingling with nervous energy as he started tapping out a text message.
"I wish you'd just tell me why we can't see each other. Too much to ask I guess. I’m not nearly drunk enough for this. Hang on, Sherlock.”
He worried for both Sherlock and John, and had tried to think of ways to help them, but it had seemed like there was nothing he could do to save the two boys from themselves. But maybe he had been wrong, maybe there was something he could do. Maybe instead of giving Sherlock what he wanted and putting his own job and career in danger, he could "accidentally" mix up the victim's phone number with John's, and thus avoid any prison time and possibly even bring two people together, two people in need of a friend.
practically ogling him. John couldn't really blame them; Sherlock was the most gorgeous human being he had ever encountered.
(07:31) He likes sticking his nose into everybody's business and every single day he's trying to make my life as difficult as possible. He can make yours difficult too. SH
Sherlock was aware that he was now choosing to text a stranger instead of working on the case he had been trying to solve for the past few days, and he very well knew that replying to the messages would not benefit him in any way. But he was bored, unbearably bored, and the fact that someone in his chemistry class had noticed him piqued his curiosity. He usually kept to himself, and most people left him alone, apart from a few guys at school who called him names and deliberately pushed into him in the corridors, so he couldn't help but be surprised to find out that someone other than one of his bullies had been paying attention to what he was doing. Supposing there was no harm in continuing their text conversation a little longer, Sherlock typed a new message and pressed send.
(13:21) Well, there are probably better ways to get used to it than getting yourself drunk and picking a fight with some strangers in the middle of the night. SH
(03:17) I don’t know. No one outside Scotland Yard was supposed to know that I’m working on the case. SH
The grin on the man's face only seemed to increase as Sherlock's cheeks reddened slightly, and he extended his hand in greeting.
Sherlock retracted his hand and placed his palm on John’s chest, making him stay in place. He had a mischievous grin on his face, and John had to swallow around the sudden dryness in his throat.
(04:36) No, I need you. Give me some data. Tell me everything you can find out about Casino Cosmo. SH
John knew he shouldn't push this too far, but his heart was beating wildly in his chest whenever his phone vibrated. It was dangerous territory he was on; there was a reason his acquaintances were mostly female. His dad. John shuddered, but pushed the thoughts away. This was anonymous. Sherlock would never find out who he was, and he therefore couldn't rat him out.
Not before long, John's breathing slows, his cellphone plastered to his face. His breathing is calm and steady, much like Sherlock's on the other end of the phone.
“I warn you, you better stop texting him, you junkie. Do you understand? Don’t contact John Watson again.”
"You... met someone?" John asked carefully, praying to whatever deity was out there that his voice conveyed no trace of the inner turmoil he was experiencing.
Waiting for John’s reply, Sherlock stares at the screen for three minutes, watching the numbers change, and then puts the phone back in his pocket, assuming that John has finally fallen asleep. He needs to get back to his room, needs to get some sleep. Rising from the chair he’s been sitting on, Sherlock leaves the café and waves down a cab to take him home.
[23:33] It was rather difficult not to get involved. He posted a pic of my face on his website. It was a bit hard to ignore that. But I do see what you're saying. You were too stupid to get caught, and now I'm paying the price for your mistake. SH
Sherlock knows, he knows perfectly well that Mycroft is right, but he can't help it, the tightness in his chest too much to bear. ‘Promise me. Just say it.’
Sherlock wasn't used to getting this much attention, let alone hearing so many compliments on his appearance. He felt dizzy and light-headed, instinctively leaning into the touch of the man's arm against his.
‘I—the fall, the t-torture. I was so alone and I—you were in danger, and I- I couldn’t. Not if you were hurt, you- John’ Sherlock was rambling without realizing it. He was hushed by John’s index finger on his lips.
Did he mean he met a friend, had me met someone he liked? Despite himself, John felt jealousy flaring up, hot and red.
John is pretty sure he flat lined when he discovered Sherlock and Irene had been flirting. Mutually. Back and forth.
A wave of nervous anticipation swept over him, his heart rate reaching a new high as he read the text again and again, just to make sure that he hadn't misunderstood anything.
[23:22] Oh, I very well know how simple it is for you to sit on your fat arse and watch while he's making my life hell. SH
He hadn't meant to phrase it as a question but he just felt so distant to himself, as if he weren’t in full control of his body.
Slowly, Sherlock swallowed around the sudden dryness in his throat, and forced himself to speak, "Um... yes. Thank you."
“Come along, John,” Sherlock said cheerfully, already walking back toward the exit, leaving John a second to compose himself and to attempt to look like he had not just been snogged. Inhaling a deep breath, he held the air in his lungs for a moment before exhaling through his nose, attempting to stop his weak knees from buckling as he started walking out. Hormones were racing through his bloodstream and his erection was painful against the tight denim of his jeans. Swearing under his breath, he headed for the exit, desperately thinking unsexy and off-putting thoughts. It helped, sort of.
Expecting some slimy douchebag, Sherlock wasn't prepared for the intense gaze looking back at him through impossibly long, dark eyelashes, sliding up and down Sherlock's body before settling on his face.
Secondly, we are looking for a beta-reader! Feel free to contact either sherlockianworld or elle_m if you’re interested, and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.
He sits up quickly, suddenly very eager to get out of Sherlock’s room and out of his life. Nausea hits him like a wave and he has to focus to not throw up. He throws on his clothes, grabs his charger and his phone and makes it upstairs to his own bedroom. There he packs down all his belongings and throws the bag over his shoulder. He is out of the Holmes’ Estate in less than ten minutes.
(18:30) Ask Mrs Hudson to prepare you something you'd like to eat. Otherwise she'll be outside your door in 30 minutes with a tray with overdone meatloaf and potatoes. SH
Sherlock couldn't stop thinking about Victor, about his intense, dark brown eyes that had suddenly made his knees go weak, his prominent jawline and carefully styled hair that had had just enough product in it to make it look accidentally tousled; about his slim but strong body, the broad shoulders and solid arms. And his lips. His lips, kissing Sherlock's. Just the thought of those full, pretty lips, pressed against his, sent shivers down Sherlock's spine.
