They did easily manage to kill the witch thanks to one of Rowena’s spells that held her in place. They were gone for less than an hour but Dean was on edge the whole time. Wanting to be there when Cas woke up but at the same time scared of what would happen when he did.
Dean watched as Cas poured himself a big mug full and then sat across from him on the kitchen table to join him. Dean already had the sugar and creamer on the table, prepared for Cas who always gets up a few minutes after him.
Dean woke up to the sound of rain coming from the new noise machine that sat at Cas’s bedside table. His breathing was a little off from the nightmare that was staring, but luckily he woke himself up before it became a big deal. Before he got dragged back into hell. Before he saw his reflection.
Cas blinked at him a few times before he fell back against Dean, his arms crossed over his chest. “Well, I don’t like it.”
By the time the car stopped at the hotel he couldn't remember what he saw outside the window and just helped Cas out with his bags again. He wanted to open Cas door but a worker had done that and even took their bags so Dean just walked beside Cas to the front door. He wanted to reach for Cas hand but he figured they have done enough hand holding for two strangers and if Cas wanted to hold his hand then he would have done so.
Dean couldn’t find the words. He wanted to say some dumb joke or push Cas off but he stopped himself. Instead, he relaxed under the touch and leaned into it.
“No, Sam is just being an idiot,” Dean informs Jack, who frowns, and Dean’s heart aches at the sight. “But we can have a game night tonight if you want.”
Sam and Jack were looking at the grocery list, walking ahead of them a few steps, and when they were far enough away, Dean leaned into Cas’s space. More than he already was.
He grabbed a couple of rags and soaked them in cool water to wrap around the burns. This is how Jack found them, and he was ready to break his vial to heal him, but luckily Dean stopped him, asking him to grab the keys so he can drive them to the hospital.
"Good job best man." Dean patted Sam's shoulder as he walked past him and down to the kitchen. "You want some breakfast."
Jack has been gone for only a few hours but Cas, fuck, he’s been gone for 11 days now. They have been trying to get him back using spells, Jack’s new God mojo, and even once Dean considered ending it hoping the new reaper will follow through with Billie’s promise to dump him into the Empty. At least Cas would not have been alone in there. But it wasn’t a guaranteed plan and his kid needed him alive more than ever, with the big promotion and all that world-saving mess that tingles through him.
“Thanks for waiting, kid. Where we going?” Dean buckled up just in time for Claire to slam the breaks. Unfortunately, he hit his head on the front dash because the damn seat was scooted forward, his knees were practically pressed against his chest, which made sense knowing a tiny
Cas’s eyes dropped closed for a second, his head turning into Dean’s palm, and relaxing into it. Dean let out a shaky sob as a result of witnessing something he never thought he would see but here they were. Alive. Together.
“It’s um,” Dean digs his hand into his jean pocket as he clears his throat. “Since I’m keeping your um…grace, for now, I think you can have something of mine to wear.”
Dean stood where he was griping at the vile in his hand. Easily he can break it in his grip and force the grace back into Jack.
Dean pulled at Cas’s shoulders to bring him into a tight hug, honestly not sure if he could handle saying these words out loud with Cas’s baby blues staring at him with so much awe.
“Okay, enough of that.” Cas said walking Dean to a chair and sitting him down. “It’s time for breakfast since Sam won’t be here till this afternoon to open presents.”
“You ready to go, Angelito?” Dean looked Cas over; he’s dressed in dark jeans and a grey long sleeve. He has never seen Cas in anything but that rumpled old suit. He never minded the suit, but now he wished he could burn it because all that suit did was hide Cas’s muscled body. Dean couldn’t stop the whistle that escaped his lips as he said, “Mira! You look good, Cas.”
“Nope!” He heard Sam say as Dean easily lets himself be pulled into the backseat with the angel. “I’ll wait in the..you don’t care.”
He really didn’t want to see that but it looked like Cas only kept his eyes on him. Even with Sam holding his shoulder down, Cas kept his glare on him. That is until Rowena said some spell that made Cas’s eyes roll to the back of his head and then collapse.
Cas smiled as he sat himself up way too quickly and got dizzy in the process. He lifted his bandaged hands to grip his head before muttering, “Can you make the bed into a chair again, please?”
“Jack, hug your Dad before he spirals.” Cas took Jack from Dean with a glare but no heat behind it. How can you be mad or annoyed when the cutest four-year-old was hugging you with all his little strength and showering you with tiny kisses.
Still, Dean didn’t want to tell anyone about Cas. Afraid to even speak of him because that would mean that his crush was real. That he had actual feelings, romantic ones, for another guy.
Dean lowered his gaze so he can meet Jack’s own. He got a stiff nod in response, and Dean can work with that.
Cas made his way to Jack’s side, dropping the bag on the nightstand while he watched Jack sleep for a few seconds.
Yes, I keep adding unnecessary chapters to this story but I'm already excited for you guys to read the next chapter! Which I will post tomorrow.
When they broke apart Cas kicked Dean out so he can relieve himself and Dean left telling him to hurry so they can explore the place.
“Don’t worry, bud.” Dean watched Jack’s eyes that showed how much he has experienced, how much he understood. “He’ll be fine.”
“Mmm.” Bobby hummed in reply, going back to turn off the beans once they looked how he wanted it. “Llévate a tu hermano.”
“Are you mad at me?” Dean looked at the empty kitchen as Cas stood between his legs, but his arms stayed limp on his sides.
Sam was sitting on the bed laughing his head off while he enjoyed the show. Teasing Dean constantly by saying. “Cas, Dean needs a break. How about you come over here?”
And that's how the conversation on 'who's the biggest fan' and 'who knows more' started. They even made plans on watching Guardians of the Galaxy as soon as they go home.
Dean looked down at the hand that was burning him through his clothes, knowing damn well that Cas was giving him the chance to make this into something more. Algo que se sentía que iba a ser cósmico en su vida. Y Dean quería eso en su vida.
Cas gave Dean a confused look but his family must have found it funny so Cas decided on giving him a small smile.
“Cas.” Dean practically beams at him even though he was trying to stay cool. Smooth. “Mi Angelito.” Dean winks, and he doesn’t miss Cas’s eyes widened and ears blushing at the nickname. “How you been?”
“Then it should’ve been you! You should’ve died! Not him!” Dean flinched at the words that have been echoing in his head since that night. “It’s not fair!”
… he loves you. He-he loves you like you were his own.” She didn’t look at him, but he could see her face scrunch up, ready to argue. “He worries about you constantly, and Jack knows all about you because he won’t shut up about how awesome you are.”
“The toilet.” Cas explains while he tried not to move and get an uneven beard. “Jack, did you text Sam what you wanted for dinner?”
“I love you.” Dean breathed out as soon as they pulled away to catch their breaths. It didn’t click in Dean’s mind that Cas had to do that as well. All he can think about is his words spilling out of his mouth. “I love you. I love you, Cas.”
They both knew it wasn’t going to last long, the separation, because as soon as the night drags on they always find themselves in each other’s space.
“All that matters is that it was good for you,” Cas tells them as he stands to pick up his clothes from the motel floor. When he’s fully dressed again, he holds his hand out for the rest of the payment, already planning the bus route to the motel across town where they had a bathtub.
The cameraman who got on the plane with them was walking around them filming from each angel as best he can and Dean did his best ignoring him.
"Night rituals and all." He said and Cas could read annoyance on his face before he sighed with defeat.
Dean was heading out with Eileen to fix her car that broke down along the way while Cas and Sam stayed back to test out another theory to separate Jack from Amara again. He wasn’t going to be gone longer than an hour, he was also going to pick up dinner with Eileen, but it would be the longest he would be separated from Cas since he came back. They both knew it, but Cas couldn’t leave Jack right now, and Sam was the only witch in the family who can properly do the spell, so Dean had to leave.
Touching was starting to become a thing they both wanted more often now, but being in the same room brought peace to his mind.
“We can start with something easier. You can catch me up with your life since the last time I saw you. I know you dealt with a great loss at the time. How are you dealing with it now?”
Cas of course also likes making Dean wear some of his shirts too, which Dean pretends to hate. Dean also pretended not to look at Cas chest when he didn’t button the shirts all the way up. Or not look when Cas takes off his trench coat to show off his arms in a short-sleeved pink shirt with teal leaves. This was one of Cas’ picks and while Dean teased him at first it became one of Dean’s favorite shirts to see him wear. He looked even more manly than before.
Dean pushed at his knees to stand up and rolled his stiff shoulders back. “He went to help Eileen with something but should be back soon. Why? You need something?”
“This is not real.” Dean says with his eyes closed shut. It get’s quiet then. He repeats it again and again until he feels himself breath again.
They haven’t really been an open pair, mostly keeping everything behind closed doors, but Dean has seen this pain in Cas’s eyes before. And back then, he couldn’t help because he was letting the wrong emotions be front and center, but now he had a better grip with all this love and…love stuff. At least he thinks he does.
Tell me what you thought of the last chapter! Please! If you hated it that's dope too just let me know!
He pushed the dumpster lid open to get some light but found the night sky welcoming him instead. He liked the nights a little more, but today there was no moon out to help him see. So he relied on touch and hoped the duffle was just thrown in here with him.
“Dean,” Cas stops in front of him as they walk on the sidewalk now. “Stop for a second. You’re angry and I'd rather not get in a car with you if you’re just gonna glare at the road the whole time.”
He kissed Cas cheek and Cas couldn't help the blush that reached up to his neck to his ears. He liked that Dean was so happy they got married and he seemed like the cuddling type which Cas was very fond of.
“I know that, but I want to. Talk, I mean. If that’s okay with you.” Cas looks at Dean with soft, warm eyes, a drastic difference from the red-rimmed eyes from the last time they saw each other. “After you’re done with work, of course.”
He eventually got him back to bed, but he only slept for another few hours before he got up again, saying he was hungry now. Dean couldn’t go back to sleep, so he was up at 6 a.m. making breakfast for his sleep-deprived —they haven’t talked titles yet, but boyfriend seems fitting even if feels like he was already married to the guy— boyfriend.
Before Dean can open his mouth to apologize — because, of course, he didn’t mean it — Miracle whined again before running from Cas’s reach.
Jack was about to close the door, but Dean quickly reaches for it and opens it wider to catch Jack before he left. His hand gripped Jack’s wrist, stopping him mid-turn before Dean let go. Using the same hand to rub at the back of his neck.
It was Dean’s turn to look away. He wiped his hands on his jeans before he reached to brush Jack’s hair out of his face. He remembers John doing this to Sam, carrying him and brushing his hair out of his face. Looking at him like he was the last thing he had that mattered, and Dean wondered if his Dad ever looked at him like that when he was asleep.
Dean ran after Claire, forcing his way to her passenger side as she started to back up on the driveway.
It wouldn’t be the first time that Castiel was left for dead–shit, it wouldn’t be the first time Castiel wished someone would actually finish the damn job and kill him already–but this time, he woke up inside a dumpster wrapped in a bloody bedsheet. It was a new one for him, but his first thought was his duffle bag.
Dean walked over and pressed a kiss on the top of Cas’s head. If anybody saw, he didn’t care. He saw Cas visibly relax when he turned to look up from where he was sitting.
He felt panic rise in his chest as he unwrapped himself and ignored the pain on the back of his head. That’s where the lamp struck him, but his vision was fine; he can do without the piercing ringing in his ears, so he’s taking that as a sign to not go to the hospital.
“Take it.” Dean dropped Cas’s arm and took the few steps forward to grab Cas’s face in between his hands to press a hard stiff peck against his lips. This was still so new, his heart-stopping for just a panic-filled second, but when he pulled away to look at Cas, eyes closed with such a content expression, Dean felt like he was brought back to life. Again.
“Yeah, Jack, as a family.” He tried to smile back as best he could, and before he knew it, he had Jack wrap his arms around him. Holding him in a tight hug. Comforting him.
“Okay, pues, have fun! Bring her home to say hi.” Bobby practically pushed him out the door with Sam happily towering behind him with the same annoying grin.
liked to say, she was dealing with feelings the Dean Winchester way. Of course, he’ll argue it wasn’t true, but he knows he won’t win that one.
“Dean,” Cas gasped and then Dean pulled Cas back. He closed his eyes enjoying the soft fabric of Cas shirt in his hands. Enjoying the little gasp Cas makes inside of Dean’s mouth as Dean couldn’t help but want to taste Cas. Dean leaned against the Impala as he pulled Cas against him, his arms around Cas’ waist and fingers grasping at his shirt. They made out in the parking lot like teenagers for a few more seconds before Cas finally pulled away with a smirking smile.
, eyes wide filled with tears, but she still looked at him with a pained grimace. “Did you even think of me? When you were out there being a damn hero. Did you-Did you think of
“I don’t care, Gabriel.” He heard a voice coming out from the bathroom as they struggled with their shopping bags. “I don’t understand why I have to be the one to come back and plan this whole thing when Dad was obviously closer to Michael. And may I add that he hated my guts.”
He can have this. Can have Cas and it was a damn Christmas miracle that Cas was dumb enough to want Dean the same way. And fuck his stubble did feel great against his skin.
“Hey.” Dean stands up but crouches until he catches those glassy blue eyes that were still looking too far away for Dean’s liking. “Cas, look at me.”
Dean didn’t argue. It was nice not to be alone during the holiday season but at the same time, he hoped Cas didn’t stay behind just for him. Dean would have done what he always did for Christmas. Go to a bar full of lonely people and find someone, or someone’s, to have some fun holiday party on a motel bed.
Dean smiled back, feeling a sense of relief because right now, everything was okay. They walked back to the car feeling okay. Things weren’t great, no they still have a lot to talk about before things were even good, but it was okay. And Dean could fucking live with okay if it meant he could keep Cas’s hand in his.
had a smile plastered across his face. They hadn’t had a chance to talk about what happened, considering
A few years ago he wouldn’t have thought it was romantic - there was no kissing or grunting in this scene what so ever- but the soft touches is what he craves now. He was already so close to Cas as it is. Feeling the warmth radiate off his best friend while his blanket was now over both their laps, he doesn’t even remember when that happened.
I can tell by the comments on the last chapter that you all LOVED Mick haha! Thank you so much for your comments omg your theories omg I loved it so much and enjoyed reading them! You guys have real good ideas and it takes me a while to answer them cause I keep trying not to give anything away haha
“Dean, are you listening?” Cas waves a hand in front of Dean’s face. They were sitting at a booth at an old dinner, sitting across from each other with cold food on their plates. “You are the one that called me over.”
“Yeah, um, how about when I’m done with this,” Dean motions to the scattered books around him before smiling back at the preschooler. “We get some ice cream and head to the park?”
“It feels…awesome.” Cas tested the word and Dean laughed before he pulled Cas in for a fresh clean mouth kiss. Cas is getting used to this, used to Dean, fairly quickly. He really liked it and he was really scared.
Instead, he tightened his hold on the steering wheel, fingers burning in protest, as he melts into Cas’s smile. Wanting to relax and just be with him for tonight, not caring que alguien lo va mirar. Enjoy this non-date that looks like it has the chance to become an actual one.
"I guess we are going to have a lot of time to get to know each other on the honeymoon." Dean starts and he notices Castiel had kind of froze up. Was he regretting his decision already? Was he going to run and leave Dean already? "You know if you want to run I won't-"
“Dean,” They heard Jack call out, and they both turned towards the voice. “Can I also get a haircut?”
“Dean, please.” Cas walked over to him and took his face in his hands. Dean noticed that Cas looked brighter, a little lighter, as he leaned forward to press a single peck on Dean’s lips. “Talk later. Leave now.”
“You aren’t a nobody, Dean.” Cas’s expression softens at the words. His eyes brighten as he looks at Dean, almost as if he can see into his soul. Then, just as Dean was about to drown in those baby blues, Cas looked away. His fingers started to twitch as he looked sheepishly at the ground. “Plus, my problems are small. I can deal with them by myself.”
When he finally found the familiar fabric, he unzipped it and felt around until his hand landed on something small and cold.
Cas was in his suit, just got out of work probably, and Dean can see his stupid blue tie was not straight. Well the owner of the tie wasn't straight either so Dean wasn't complaining. He liked being the one to fix the tie anyways, give him an excuse to touch him, and stand close.
“Cas?” Dean walked towards him and saw Cas jump when Dean grabbed his shoulders. Dean doesn’t remember the last time he ever got the jump on Cas.
“I don’t know who that is.” Jack picked up the cup with the hand Cas wasn’t crushing and put the cup to his mouth as he looked at Dean with a confused look.
“Victor.” Victor raised an eyebrow at him but reached over to shake Cas’s hand in response. “What can I get you and the pendejo around you?”
Sam laughed and pulled away so the rest of his family can hug him. As soon as they said there goodbye and Cas was by his side again they left in the car that was waiting for them.
“No.” Cas made a disgusted face but then groaned. “Sam, if you are willing to kiss me can you please?”
“Fuck. Finally. Kiss.” Cas turns Dean’s around and with his damn stupid strength picks Dean up and sits him down in an empty morgue bed. Kissing him harder than before as he forced his tongue in Dean’s mouth and Dean could only wrap his arms around Cas’s shoulder to pull him closer. Letting himself be manhandled by the angel and loving every second of it.
Luckily Rowena called again after Dean got out of the bathroom, not to mention Cas jumped him as soon as the door swung open. “It’s an easy curse to lift, lucky for you boys. So I’ll be there in a few hours. Don’t have too much fun without me.”
“How does it feel to be an official Winchester?” Dean asked and a big side grin was on his face as Cas looked at him through the mirror. Dean waved at their reflections and Cas rinsed his mouth before he answered.
He dropped the pan in the sink and ran over to see his kid standing on a chair with the phone in his hand while talking in his most serious voice — it was cute with his little concentration face — before he made eye contact with Dean.
Jack says it with no room to argue. He’s not wrong, but if someone else heard it, they would think some vamps gave him a concussion. Especially when Jack starts touching his face like he now doubted his words.
Dean can feel warmth tickle up his chest as he swallowed hard while he watched that twitch of a smile again. Cas retook a step towards him, baby blues never leaving his face as if to read every micro-expression on Dean’s face.
So, please tell me what you guys think? I would love to hear it! I love reading all your predictions too! Some of you are real close and it's exciting. While others made me wish I would have written that instead lol
Dean had to look up at him to see if he could read his expression but of course, he was straight-faced, maybe looked more lost than mad or hurt. He was worried that he would think Dean took advantage of him in that situation and hoped he could explain himself better but Dean knew those words are never getting out. Not any time soon anyway.
“But you won’t do it.” Gabriel sighed, already knowing Cas’s answer before he verbalized it. “Yeah, I figured I’ll ask anyway. Still, healing your arms is okay?”
A happy sigh escapes Cas’s lips as he rolls his shoulders back and reaches for the untouched toast on Dean’s plate. “Merry Christmas Eve by the way.” He took a bite of the toast with butter and then made a face before he reached for the jam. Sweet tooth. He took another bite before he started talking with his mouth full. “I know you don’t celebrate but I still hope we can watch that movie you wanted to show me.”
Dean looked in the review mirror to see Jack and Cas both looking out their windows, both developing the nervous tick of playing with their necklaces absentmindedly while they both looked like they were ready to pass out any second now. Cas nightmares have been getting worse, but he still wasn’t talking about them. Sometimes he won’t even have a chance to fully wake up before he had Cas’s whole weight on him, clinging to him as if he was scared Dean was about to disappear. While Jack has been feeling drained. He hasn’t really talked much since waking up human, but Dean could hear the kid walking around the bunker in the middle of the night. Sometimes Dean would find Jack passed out on the kitchen table with a bowl of cereal by his head.
"Nice to meet you guys." Dean said shaking their hands but not letting go of Cas own. "Thanks for being here."
“Amara.” His voice didn’t sound as threatening as he wanted it to sounds. No, he sounded like he was ready to beg.
Cas couldn't take his eyes off him and he tried his best to control himself and just pay attention to what the minister was saying but all he can think about is how those green eyes may look in the sun. He couldn't believe this man actually is marrying him right now. This must be some dream.
“I love you.” Dean whispered into the room as he laid on his back and Cas was falling back asleep with his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean reaches to press his palm on his boyfriend’s cheek, and that grabs his attention. Cas raises his head just enough to look back at him, the small smile was heartbreaking, but Dean had to use his words. He had to find the right ones so Cas can know exactly how he feels. How scared, lost, and alone he felt without Cas.
“Do you want me just to stand here? I mean, as an angel, I wouldn’t have gotten tired, but as a human, I think I would find this very uncomfortable.”
“Yeah. Yeah, we are staying married.” Dean tells her and Cas grinned, full-on teeth grin that Dean loves seeing on him. He leaned down to kiss that grin.
Cas loosened his grip on Dean’s shirt as he sighed in relief before he quietly replied, “I love you.”
He has been a little out of it since separating from Amara and losing his mojo, but nothing some good family time couldn’t fix. Or a good dog cuddle from Miracle who followed Jack around like a…well like sad little puppy. Jack was hesitant to leave her behind, but she wasn’t going to be allowed in the grocery store.
He didn’t look at the audience around them when he finally opened his mouth to say, “Claire, Ca—” He couldn’t say his name. He felt like it would tear the fragile wall that was keeping him on his feet if he did. “I’m sorry.”
He felt a kiss at the back of his neck as the foreign arms wrapped around his middle to pull him in close. Cas pushed himself up to sit at the edge of the bed and away from the stranger’s grasp. Not wanting to be touched anymore.
His phone fell to the ground but he could still hear screaming from the other end. Cas quickly picked it up and hung up since Gabriel kept screaming Dean’s name.
“Cas, sweetheart,” Dean moved his hands down Cas’s arms until he was holding his hands. “You’ve been doing fine. There’s just a lot of change in your life lately.”
“Ah.” Cas nodded, another smile. This one was softer and warmer. A smile that felt reserved for just Dean. Cas’s cheeks were even rosy from the cold wind piercing through their many layers. “Understood. I’ll take the cart back and you start the car then.”
He should be the one consoling his boyfriend, but instead, here they were, Cas carefully comforting Dean even though he had no idea what set him off because Dean never got the words out. He was afraid he would never be able to tell Cas how lost he was without him. How scared he was to lose him again because this time, after having him the way he has only dreamt, it’ll be near impossible to come back from.
When they got to the motel Dean walked to the bathroom but Cas was still following close to him. “Hey, you stay out here while I take a quick leak.”
I hope you like this angsty mess. I am not one to write angst for this long or in general. I like fluff so expect a happy ending from this story. However long it will be. I will get there! Thanks for the lovely comments on the last chapter by the way! They really made my whole day.
Both Sam and him have been itching for a drink but they wanted to make it less harder on John who has been doing good so far on being sober for Dean's day. Dean couldn't ask for a better present from him. John had been quiet though and Sam decided to get them all some coffees or whatever else he can find before Ellen gets here and tells then they may dirty themselves.
Su Tio, though, cared a lot. Dean has to constantly remind him that Dean didn’t cheat on her, and he just broke it off cause Cassie was too smart for him.
“I am!” Cas gave him a look that read through his bullshit. Dean sighed and scratched at the back of his neck. “Damn it, Cas! I just don’t wanna do this!”
Dean didn’t like going down this neighborhood. It never made him any money, plus the block is a dead end, so he always ends up circling back around with his heavy cart. His Tio always yelled at him for it, wasting precious time in a block where nobody paid him any attention because these Americanos aren’t used to people walking around selling comida.
He finds no pleasure in it, but luckily, his body doesn’t show his discomfort or disgust in the act. It became routine to have somebody else have control of this body. To do whatever it is they want with it before they throw him away in disgust. The feeling just as mutual, but sex meant more money and more money meant a shower.
Sam walked closer to Dean and didn't object to Dean fixing his tie or shirt like he was a child again. Instead, Sam talked about how Jess was already in a taxi and on her way. "How you holding up?"
Cas nodded as he closed the door to Dean’s bedroom. “Yeah, Gabriel’s waiting for me outside. We’re gonna try to leave before Dad comes home from work.”
Dean got up, grabbing a jacket and some shoes that fit, and walked out the bedroom and down the stairs hoping he can leave unseen. This just has to be some weird dream that is too vivid and...fuck he can smell bacon.
Cas looked up at Dean as he answered and by the third week Dean kind of knew that he may have started to fall for Cas and his strange ways but they never said anything about it. Just the fact that they are still together now is enough for Dean. The fact that Cas understands that Dean has to work for the money that is really needed and that Sunday family dinners are mandatory is what Dean looked for in a person and luckily that person was Cas. Luckily Cas even liked going to those things and spending his breaks in the Roadhouse or in the garage watching Dean work. Cas pretty much works from home but he sometimes has to show up at the office for meetings or whatever but besides that, they would spend each free second together.
“Just come here already.” Dean pulled at Cas’s hand, and without using his words - because how can he possibly ask Cas to cuddle with him - he maneuvered Cas to sit between his legs. Cas kicked off his shoes as his back gently fell against Dean’s chest.
“Like I said,’’ Dean kept his other hand on Cas’s cheek, letting his fingertips play with the scruffy beard, and he turned his head, taking a deep, shaky breath before he leaned forward to press his lips on Cas’s throat. Leaving a lingering kiss before he pulled back to hide his face on Cas’s shoulder again. “I missed you.”
The Empty wasn’t budging until Jack showed up at the bunker that morning saying the Empty visited heaven with a deal to make. One that Dean agreed to without hearing what it was. Lucky for them it was something simple because the big scary entity only wants one thing, silence.
Dean looked over his body again just to make sure there was no blood and when he looked back at his face he was meet with hazy blue eyes staring back at him.
“Cas!” Dean took Cas’s arms and turned him away from the steaming hot water. Just touching it for a brief second stung his skin. Dean looked down to see Cas still holding the steel wool sponge tightly in his fist. “Drop it, Cas! Let it go!”
“Morning, Sunshine.” Dean finally tells him as Cas placed his mug down on the table to smile back at him.
?” Cas didn’t look at him as he talked, but the air quotes were definitely there. “Or have I been wrong?”
“Cas! The music...make it stop.” Dean grumbled as he got out of bed and putting on his robe as he was still half asleep. It wasn’t until he realized that he was dragging his feet on clean carpet that he realized he wasn’t in his bedroom. He rubbed on his eyes and counted to three thinking this room will disappear when he opens his eyes again. But that didn’t work. “Son of bitch.”
“Hey,” Dean grabbed his face in between his hands and made Cas look at him. His blue eyes looked strained and the flicker of red was starting to grow as he fought the curse. “I’m fine, Cas. Probably fine is an understatement but I’m good. Seriously, Cas, I don’t mind. Plus, the alternative is you kind of humping yourself to death and I’m not gonna let you go out like that.”
They both suck at the whole touchy feeling crap, Sam was the only one in the family who can even say shit like this, but today was a special day. His special day. Fuck.
“Dean, I don’t think I ever heard you express so much...feeling. You are,” Cas stops to think for the word and Dean watches his nose scrunch up as he thinks. “A sap. A hopeless romantic.”
Cas’s fingers stopped just over Dean’s lips, and he carefully reached to kiss them, wishing that for once in his life, he could heal instead of harm.
It was only supposed to be a quick peck but Cas chased after him, sitting up as he let his hands reach to rest at the base of Dean’s neck. Kissing him again and again until they were both on their knees tugging at each other to get closer. Desperate for the touch they have been craving and holding back for so long.
Dean didn’t know how to use his words as well as Cas, but he instead reached to pull Cas into a tight hug. Falling into him as his eyes closed when he was flooded with warmth and comfort because Cas was right. Touching was starting to feel different between them, and it was scary, but it wasn’t stopping them. Not anymore, at least. Before he pulled away, he left another peck at Cas’s temple.
Cas laughed as Dean accidentally spit all over the mirror and he handed Dean a tissue from the small box on the counter. The camera was passed to Dean next as it was Cas turn to brush his teeth and Dean asked the same question. Kind of.
Dean crouched beside Cas’s chair and hesitantly reached to take Cas’s hand. Squeezing it once before looking up at him. “Don’t worry. He’s fine. He’s still in there.”
Dean swallowed hard as his hands nervously squeezed into fists before looking up at Mia. “Yeah. Yeah. I heard I was just…thinking.”
Cas hummed as his eyes fluttered closed for a few seconds, a little drugged out, before looking up a Dean with a half glare. There was no fire behind those eyes—just a worried stare. “I thought I told you to go home. Get proper rest.”
Charlie started fiddling with her phone. It was already set up so it was linked to his Amazon Echo and she could override his music choices at will. A catchy guitar riff came out of his Alexa connected speakers. Dean recognised it as the beginning of ‘How Do Girls Even Do It’ by Childbirth.
Dean took Cas's face in his hands, forcing him to meet his eyes. “It was perfect. Here was the perfect place. I got to have my baby in my Baby,” he quipped, patting the backseat affectionately before kissing Cas.
familiar with that reference.” Cas’s eyes were slits now as he glared at him. Dean made a sad little moue of disappointment. It was a look that Cas could never resist, no matter how silly or dramatic Dean was being. Cas blew out a loud breath in resignation. “Oh, fine.”
It was only later that he found out that that’s what Bobby and John had fought about. Not the Impala, but the accident. John had been driving under the influence, which was the only way he did anything by that time. Sam and Dean had been in the backseat when he’d run a stoplight and gotten T-boned by a semi. It was a miracle they’d all survived and John hadn’t wound up in jail. He’d gotten off on some technicality because of a screwup in the Sheriff’s Department.
Despite Meg assuring him that he wasn’t as bad with people as he thought, social interactions weren't always easy for Cas. While he’d gotten better over the years, those hard-won social skills seemed to abandon him when he was stressed. It wasn’t as bad as last week, but, still, he didn’t feel up to manning reception right now.
When the teams came out onto the field, Cas turned to him curiously and asked, “Dean, are we here because the players wear tight pants?”
Cas passed Sam a present wrapped in Rudolph paper he’d purloined from Dean. It turned out to be a book by an author that Dean had never heard of, on a subject he didn’t understand. The book seemed to make Sam’s little nerd heart happy though, which pleased Cas, which in turn pleased Dean, so they all sat around grinning stupidly for a bit before Cas cleared his throat.
“No women, right, ok...” Dean looked thoughtful and a little awkward before rallying. “That's fine, dude, I'm open minded, I can take you to a gay bar, wingman for you, find you some hot guy to take home. I promise I'll try not to let
The one time that Castiel had trusted someone enough to be himself with them, or at least the person he was slowly becoming instead of just being his father’s idea of him, it hadn’t worked out so well. The experience had scared Cas back into submission whilst simultaneously making him more determined than ever to one day escape his father’s control.
Dean sat mulling things over while the angel watched him patiently. Cas had told him he was his husband again. He was very adamant about that. Ignoring that for the moment, he was apparently someone who worked with him and Sam. The three of them had been chasing a couple of real nasty witches who’d been leaving a trail of dead behind them wherever they went. They had them pinned down and managed to gank the guy but the female witch, the guy’s wife apparently, was able to get away. She was injured but, unfortunately, she’d still managed to hit Dean with a spell. Sure, it sounded a little preposterous, but a lot of Dean’s life was preposterous. So much so that the witch and the spell actually didn’t seem at all farfetched, the part he was having problems with was the part where he was married to an angel he couldn’t remember.
“Are you calling me or Ken a cock slut?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows and grabbing his beer from the counter to take a swig.
“Dean said that you like sweet things too. I got it at the farmer's market. They said it’s made by local bees, so, who knows, maybe some of them got nectar from flowers out front.”
Cas smirked at him, the self-assurance from last night back in place, the brief glimpse of vulnerability Dean had seen earlier gone. He held his hand out and Dean nearly put his own in it before realising Cas wanted his phone. Cas’s smirk widened as he typed his number into Dean’s cell. Yeah, he’d seen Dean’s hand twitch toward his before he picked up the phone.
Dean looked at him curiously and said, “Don’t get me wrong, it’s hot, but why do you always act like my come is fucking delicious?”
Please leave kudos if you liked it because I crave your validation the way Dean craves his father's approval! If you want to leave a comment as well, I'd love to hear from you :)
Once play began, Cas didn’t say anything or look away from the field for a long time. Dean found himself ignoring the action in favour of feasting his eyes on his husband. Cas was a riot of cheerful colour today. He’d left off his trench coat in favour of a dark pink hoodie, which he had declared was his ‘weekend wear’ when Dean had mentioned it earlier. He wondered if Cas had been watching Tan France on Queer Eye talking about the difference between casual and business attire again. The hoodie went nicely with his purple baseball cap and blue foam finger. Cas looking freaking adorable. Come Monday, Dean was sure he’d be back in his old trench, for now though, it was wonderful to see Cas looking this relaxed. They were off duty for the weekend and they got to be just 2 regular guys at a baseball game. Well, one guy, one multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent crammed inside a guy, whatever. They sat like that, Cas watching the game, Dean watching Cas, until a hotdog seller came through their section of the stands.
Okay, historically, that might be part of the reason Dean watched baseball but “We’re just here because I thought you’d enjoy it,” he told Cas honestly.  Anyway, the pants weren’t that figure-hugging, not many players still wore those tight, old-fashioned breeches, more’s the pity.
Cas held onto his phone after he hung up. There was another call he should make. Or at least a text he should send. He’d been pretty much ignoring Dean for the last week. Dean had texted him just saying ‘Hey, how are you?’ the day after they’d last seen each other. Cas hadn’t replied.
“And this one still hasn’t gotten around to proposing,” Cesar added, slinging an arm around his boyfriend.
“You startled me,” Cas said, ignoring the compliment completely because he didn’t know how to respond to it when he was feeling so discomposed. “I wasn’t expecting you to sneak up on me. I’m surprised you even recognised me from behind.”
It was harder to shake off the incident the second time it happened. Cas felt like he was going crazy, but maybe that was overly dramatic. It was unlikely he was actually going crazy. He was pretty sure it was unlikely, anyway. He was perfectly sane… but then, ninety-four percent of psychotics thought they were perfectly sane… No, if he had a psychotic illness, chances were that signs would have shown up before he was twenty-seven, right?
Dean laid down and pulled Cas atop him. The weight of the other man felt like the only thing anchoring him to this world. Reality was solely made up of the two of them. They kissed languidly for a long time, lips meeting sweetly, taking soft slow licks into each other's mouths. Cas’s hands moved in his hair, stroked down Dean’s sides, rasped against the stubble on his cheeks. Dean’s hands just stayed on Cas’s back, clinging to him tightly. He couldn’t seem to release his hold on Cas’s trench coat. He didn’t ever want to let him go. Cas broke the kiss for a moment to look at Dean, to look inside him. Dean rubbed the side of his face against him, like a cat marking him with his scent.
“I just don't want to get come on the upholstery,” he said sardonically, turning away. “Again...” Cas thought he heard him mutter.
They were both dressed ridiculously, and it was just as comfortable as hanging out in sweatpants. Not for the first time, Dean thought how lucky he was to have such an awesome best friend. They chatted about random shit until they finished their beers and got ready to leave.
CW for suicide obviously. This video is interesting but the topic of historic/religious attitudes to suicide might be triggering for some.
“Is this the part where we go round the table and say what we're thankful for?” Cas asked, as he sat down next to Dean.
“Good things coming out of bad experiences? I think I like that better too.” They grinned at each other and Cas continued, “I don’t always understand it, but I do enjoy Eliasson’s work. He’s done a few installations that are kind of like free-standing waterfalls. From the back or the side, you can see the scaffolding and supports but from the front, it’s almost like the water appears from nowhere, like there’s a rip in the fabric of space and water is just pouring in from a river in a parallel universe. It’s magical.”
When Dean was sixteen, Bobby had told him that the Impala was his if he wanted to fix it up. He’d spent the next two years doing that, coaxing his baby back to life. Dean had gotten a weekend job to pay for parts, and Bobby had taught him how to fix cars. It had been one of the proudest moments of his life when he first got behind the wheel of the car he’d fixed up himself, his very own car.
He should probably clean up too, but moving felt like too much effort. Idly, Dean ran his fingers through the come on his stomach. He wished he was covered in Cas's come instead of his own, though an orgasm Cas had wrung out of him, even by proxy, was almost as good. Dean floated in a post-orgasm haze, his mind fuzzy.
“Aw, bro, you’ve heard of it.” Gabriel grinned at him. He looked proud, but Dean wasn’t sure if he was proud of the TV show he produced or just proud that Cas watched TV now.
Cas shook his head. “Can you talk to him? The idea of seeing him again already feels strange enough. I don’t want to reunite over text after all these years. It would be too awkward.”
“I can’t believe you didn't tell me you were coming as Kaylee,” Dean complained. “I would have dressed up as Mal. You know how much I love
Dean was pretty sure that Cas liked the possessive implications that coating Dean in his come had because he stared down at the mess he’d made for a long time. Cas ran his fingers through the small pool that had settled in the crease of Dean’s hip, massaging gently like he was trying to rub it into Dean’s skin.
Apparently, a young woman killed herself in nineteenth-century Italy and some anatomist used her body to practise a preservation technique.”
Dean had only meant for them to have a drink at the bar when he suggested it. But Cas looked so damn cute. All Dean wanted to do was drag him into a dark corner and have his way with him. He knew he shouldn’t. They had a nice, comfortable hotel room to go to after the bar. Dean hadn’t felt like driving back the same night, so he’d found someplace close online. Well, technically, Sam had found it for him because Sam was a good brother like that. The hotel was nicer than the usual no-tell motels they stayed at on the road. It was the sort of joint that put mints on the pillows instead of somewhere that probably didn’t even put clean cases on the pillows. The problem was that the hotel suddenly seemed so far away. Dean wasn’t 22 anymore. He was probably too old to be doing this, but, damn, he needed to get his mouth on this man.
As Dean had stopped to let him out near the shop, Cas had blurted out that they should meet up on the weekend too. He snapped his jaw shut as the last word left his mouth, but it was too late. He couldn’t take it back and he didn’t want to as soon as he saw the smile that bloomed on Dean’s face. It was warm and open and so, so happy.
Right, yeah, he had noticed that come to think of it. The other day Cas had shared some of the pie Dean was eating. And a few weeks ago, he had made himself a viciously hot vindaloo and Cas had taken a few forkfuls of it straight from Dean’s plate.
Cas kissed his laughter away. Dean let himself be pressed back into the wall. The solid line of Cas’s body was warm and hard against his own. The small, illicit thrill of kissing somewhere they shouldn’t be made both their breaths come faster. Even if they were just kissing, even if no one could see them, it felt somehow risque... which was ridiculous, but there you were.
“Are you shaking right now, Dean, desperate for my touch? Do you wish I was there, holding you down while I take you apart?”
Dean woke the next day feeling pretty damn good. Cas was snuggled in his arms. He’d been a little worried the other man would sneak out in the dead of night to avoid the awkward morning after, but there he was, snuggling Dean. His head was pillowed on Dean’s shoulder and his leg was thrown over Dean’s thighs. The soft, warm weight of him nearly lulled Dean back to sleep, but his stomach was rumbling and his bladder was full.
Dean read the caption underneath. “They call them water bears and moss piglets? Okay, that’s adorable.”
He sat down on the little loveseat and looked invitingly at Dean. No way was he going to sit there next to him, so close he’d practically be in his lap. Dean turned one of the chairs in the kitchen around and sat there instead. The angel put the cell down on the little wooden coffee table in front of him. Dean wondered if he should make a grab for it. Cas saw him looking and said “We can call Sam again after we've talked.”
“You should eat some breakfast before you split, dude. Not to toot my own horn, but someone just made the fluffiest pancakes and the crispiest bacon. Be a shame to miss out.”
And, if Dean was honest, maybe he’d wanted to protect John, not let the world know what a shitty father he was and expose him to Bobby’s anger and judgement. He’d idolised his father as a kid. God only knew why since John had never done anything to deserve it. Dean had known by the time he was a teenager that John didn’t deserve his adulation, but he’d still been loyal to him.
“Me too.” Cas smiled back at him for a moment before saying, “I can think of a piece you might like.”
“I loved my father,” Cas said, which was not at all what Dean had expected him to say. “I tried so hard to be the son he wanted. He barely paid me any attention when I was young, but by the time I was fifteen or so, all my brothers had disappointed him. I think he saw me as his last chance to mould a suitable second in command. For a while, I was his favourite, but I turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. He shouldn’t have been surprised. He always knew there was something wrong with me—”
“I'm the one who loves you above all others, so I suppose you could call that a boyfriend, though it hardly seems like an adequate word,” Cas said seriously.
Abby was just as prickly as Meg on the outside, but he wasn’t sure what was underneath. He half expected Abby to have gastralia like a t-rex just because he couldn't imagine her having anything so human as a soft underbelly. Perhaps Meg was close enough that she could see the hidden vulnerability that he did not. Or perhaps Meg just needed someone who was cold and hard all the way through to their core. Meg, who was ashamed of her own kindness because, to her, it was inextricably linked to weakness.
A large man with salt and pepper hair and an impressive beard entered the room, looking a little uncomfortable.
“Meg and I usually spend Christmas together. Neither of us can do a decent roast—I think the fire department was called last time we tried—so we just eat Chinese food and get drunk.”
“Or if someone I tattooed falls into a bog!” Cas added laughing. “But barring those scenarios, my art will still last for decades. It’s on living breathing canvasses walking around, ongoing exhibitions for people they meet.”
Dean kissed his forehead and Cas drifted off to sleep only moments later. He slept much better than he thought he would after making the difficult decision to reach out to Gabriel. He felt warm and safe in Dean’s arms, though, so the decision didn’t upset his equilibrium as much as he’d expected it to.
Dean thought. Cas drank the beer without complaint, even though Dean knew he would have preferred something sweeter. They chatted for a while before Dean glanced over at the crowded dancefloor.
“It’s the nature of the spell. A spell like this, it’s complicated. It’s best to go the slow, gentle route. I’ve set the healing in motion. The root problem is fixed but your brain needs to take its own time to remember things. It’s a process. It might take a few days. I know it’s frustrating and I don’t like it eith-”
“Don't worry Bobby, hard as I try, I just can’t seem to get the dude I’m seeing pregnant.” Dean sighed. “Maybe I’m doing something wrong.”
“Of course, there's only one bed. We’re married,” Cas told him yet again. He was so sick of having to say that.
Bobby had taken one look at the pair of them and folded them into his arms and into his family. They hadn’t even met Ellen before that, Bobby not having been married to her the last time they’d seen him, but she’d taken the two boys under her wing anyway.
Even though Cas assured him that everything was fine, Dean still wanted to find a way to make it up to him. It was just that he wasn’t great at apologies. As far as past relationships went, if he fucked up, he’d just try to buy forgiveness with a gift. He really didn’t think some gas station flowers were going to cut it this time. Flowers had never seemed like the best apology anyway. Here, have some dying plants and be reminded of the terrible thing I did while you watch them wither. Better to get something meaningful. But what did you get an angel who wanted for nothing? Cas wasn’t materialistic. He didn’t care about possessions unless they had sentimental value, like his trench coat. Dean didn’t think he would ever give up that particular worldly good. He did like to give his husband material things sometimes. The fact that they came from Dean tended to give the items automatic sentimental value as far as Cas was concerned. Mostly though, if he wanted to give Cas a gift, he gave him an experience. That was what Cas cherished most. Dean had been trying to think of something special to do for Cas since he got his memories back.
“I'm not like you. I can't just go to the bar and pick up some strange woman.” Cas looked mortified by the thought.
Cas knelt up and removed his coat, followed swiftly by his shirt and tie, tossing them carelessly to the floor. He leant down to help Dean out of his own shirt and t-shirt, then paused disrobing to kiss his mouth and then his neck, stopping to linger on the spots he knew were sensitive, licking up the side of his throat and sucking just beneath his ear. He continued down his body, kissing and licking and sucking until he got to Dean’s waist and began to remove his pants. Dean’s erection bobbed free and Cas placed a quick kiss on the head. It was a chaste kiss, not a prelude to seduction. It was more like a greeting, as if to say, ‘hello my old friend, it’s good to see you again’. Then he continued to draw Dean’s pants down his legs. Dean toed off his socks while Cas quickly got rid of his own pants and socks before laying down on him again, naked flesh pressed against naked flesh. They kissed with growing urgency, lips and hands becoming more insistent. Cas sucked hard on the side of his neck, leaving a mark where anyone could see it.
“You make a cute couple,” the guy said, looking over to the dancefloor where Cas’s erratic arm waving had cleared a small circle around him.
Cas lay with his head on Dean's shoulder for a long time. Dean gently rubbed his back before falling asleep with his arm slung loosely around him. It was comforting, but Cas was restless after lying there for so long. He lifted Dean's arm, carefully so as not to wake him, and placed it next to Dean's torso. Then he rolled onto his side and wriggled over slightly until he could feel Dean's side against his back. That way they were still touching even if they were no longer entwined.
“I glossed over some of the details of my childhood earlier. It was worse than just a strict religious upbringing. He wasn’t just a cult leader,” Cas said quietly to his hot chocolate. “My father was a sociopath with a god complex who tried to kill me.”
Dean felt a moment of kinship with Gabriel. He knew exactly what he meant and he felt sad that Cas hadn’t had that escape when he was a kid too. Cas had always been so scared to break the rules when he was young, even if it was something as small as sneaking out to watch TV. He made up for it now though. Living his life in a way that made him happy, regardless of what his father would have thought.
“Well, awesome is my word, but you get the gist.” He turns to face her even though she doesn’t meet his gaze. “
He looked at his wall for a full minute before he convinced himself to sleep in Cas’s space. To use his boyfriend as a pillow and hold him until he could lull himself back to sleep. When he slowly turned around, careful not to wake him, he found Cas’s side of the bed empty.
“More.” Cas moaned against Dean’s lips as he took a hold of Dean’s collar and easily started to pull him into the back seat with him. “More. I need more.”
Those are the words Dean wanted to say to Cas, but if he didn’t believe them, how can he even say them. Instead, Dean stood behind Cas, a hand stretched out to lay on top of Cas’s shoulder in solidarity while they watch Sam and Rowena perform an ancient and risky spell. Eileen was standing along the sidelines with them as Jack stood in the middle of the library’s floor.
“I’ll kick her ass,” Dean growled, remembering that lady getting up at Jack’s face in the playground. “I should have just shot her as soon as she pointed her damn wrinkle finger at my kid.”
When they finally landed and Dean, who woke up with three hours left of the plane ride, helped Cas with his bags to their next car ride to the hotel.
As soon as they came home that first night back, Dean took Cas to his room so they can catch up on sleep but when they woke up they both stiffened up in each other’s arms. They really haven’t kissed since then. They haven’t even held hands and just settled with simple touches every once in a while.
Cas reached forward to brush their noses together before Dean relaxed into the next kiss. Properly kissing him without the panic and desperation that kept getting in their way. Dean slid one arm around Cas’s waist to pull him close while the other rested at the base of his neck to keep him close. This kiss was slower, sweeter, as they found their rhythm, and Dean tries to remember a time when he thought he couldn’t have this. How stupid he was for not asking. For not saying it out loud.
He pressed on the only name on his contact as he jumped out of the dumpster, but he only ended up falling on his ass. His whole body felt like it was asleep while his head spun.
“His present is coming tomorrow.” Claire said holding up her phone to show she was tracking the package.
Dean shakes his head to stop him from arguing any further. He jumped back on his bike and looked back at Cas as he said, “You can get me something later. Is seven okay?”
Amara put her cup down on the table as she jumped off gracefully to walk over to Jack, bending down to run her hands through his hair and smile down at him.
He felt Cas’s full-body shiver as his arms tighten around Dean. “So ‘I miss you’ kisses are acceptable?”
Cas reached out for the camera and then turned it on as he followed Dean into the bathroom where he started to brush his teeth.  “Second day of our married life. How are you feeling?”
Claire’s angry fist collided with his chest. He flinched at every hit but didn’t back away as her punches became sporadic but still filled with grief. Maybe even guilt.
“I think I’m happy today too.” Cas beamed at him, and for the first time in a long time, Dean believed him.
Dean tried to sound as sincere as possible, talking soft and slowly so Jack could feel comfortable with him because all he wants is for the kid to look at him again with a real smile. Look at him without the fear that reflected Dean’s childhood self. He wants to try and be…good.
“Hey, I thought I was saying goodbye at your place.” Dean cracked a smile, it was just a twitch as he stood up from his bed to walk over to Cas. “Are you...are you leaving already?”
A flash of bright light blinded them all and blasted them into their backs. Dean swore he died for a couple of seconds when he woke up gasping for breath and watch the only person standing, Amara, eyes flicker between the bright white light and black that Chuck had.
“No, it’s not, Dean. I’m just forcing myself on you and you don’t want this.” Cas made a pained noise. “I’m sorry. I’ll do my best to behave myself.”
Dean saw Cas run up to him and push him out of the way to remove the frying pan from the fire just as it started to smoke up. Cas turned off the flames and turned to glare at Dean, more worried than angry, while he stood so close.
“Dean?” He looked up to see Cas was focusing on him again, maybe a little far away still, but he was focusing on him. Eyes filled with tears but wide, almost like he was begging him. “Dean. Make it go away.
Cas held him for a second, comforting Dean when it should be the other way around before Mia knocked at the open door, asking if he was ready to continue their session. Dean didn’t hesitate when he told her that he was.
Oh, bother me on tumblr - under the same now - and share with me your thoughts! Or send me prompts cause I should start taking those lol
"I meant to sleep. Like, share the bed. It's big enough for both of us." Cas corrected himself and he wasn't sure if he saw the disappointment in his expression but then he smiled and nodded with agreement.
This fic is almost over! There is one last chapter left! I know it says 9 chapters will be posted but chapter 9 is just a little extra side piece lol So tomorrow's chapter is the last one! Technically. Kind of.
Dean didn't pay attention to much of what the host was saying as he fought the urge to reach over to hold Cas hand. He knew by now they would be showing videos of their marriage and Dean didn't want to listen.
“Dean,” Cas reached over to gently touch his arm as if knowing that Dean’s mind had wandered off. He looked hesitant, as if not sure if he was allowed to. “Do you want to go eat? We can if you want.”
"I want to apologize for invading your space like this." Dean whispered as he moves away just a little. "Sam always made fun of me cuddling whatever warm body was sleeping next to me."
They didn't have much more time to talk since their families came out to congratulate them and introduce themselves. Cas seemed overwhelmed by the many names he had to learn but he accepted the invitation to dinner that Ellen offered when they come back from their honeymoon.
A cameraman sat in the back seat of his car and Dean warned him to not leave a scratch on her. He was alone in the car so that's when the cameraman started to ask him how he was and to speak to the camera so Dean did just that. He spoke looking down mostly and shrugging his shoulders a lot as he even scratched the back of his neck talking about the nerves he has but that he was excited.
“¡Pero nada! ¡Piensas que soy pendejo como tu, pinche mamón! Don’t think I don’t know you spend that time babeando por tu novia.”
At that moment, Dean wanted to lean in and kiss him more than he has wanted to kiss anyone in his 26 years of life, but he won’t. He still wasn’t sure if this was Cas asking him out as a friend or as something more. He was scared, but he knew his heart raced in excitement more than anything.
“You sure you want me to? I mean he looks pretty damn happy to me. Don’t you think, Samuel?” She nudged Sam who grinned back at her.
followed behind her, watching as she walked straight past the living room and towards the front door. “Claire. Claire, where are you going?”
“Cas?” They hear Jack call for him, and the only reason Cas even looked up was that Amara has been calling him by his full name. “Dad, I’m fine.”
“¡Oye! ¿A dónde vas tan cambiado?” Tio Bobby was by the stove, smashing the beans for dinner, as he raised his eyebrows at Dean. Sam was standing by the sink peeling tomatillos as he cranes his neck to look over at Dean.
. What happened to him.” He sighed and looked back at her. “Sorry. I should have called, but I wasn’t—I was a mess. I couldn’t be there for you. I couldn’t even be there for Jack. I should have-”
Two hours into the flight, four and half more to go, Dean had his head on Cas shoulder and his grip on Cas hand wasn't as strong but still, Cas held on to his hand. He liked the roughness of Dean's hand and it tells him that Dean works a lot with his hands. The stubble from Dean tickled Cas neck but he didn't move as he read his eBook, he figured getting his actual book will take some work to flip the pages since his other hand was busy holding on to his husband.
“Can I have another gift then?” Cas asked, leaning his head down so he could catch Dean’s downward gaze. He was blushing -fuck he was blushing- as he smiled at him again and Dean was taken back to that morning. Where he thought that he could live with just having that smile in his life but now he knows how that smile felt against his own.
Cas slowly walked Dean to the garage, shoulders bumping the whole quiet walk over before they stopped in front of the driver-side door.
Dean finally looked up to see Cas’s red-rimmed and glazed-over eyes. He looked so lost that it made Dean want to pull him in to hold him but right now was not the time.
“I know it’s customary to give gifts now.” Cas started reaching for something on the floor while Dean opened his mouth to argue but Cas looked at him with those
Dean took a deep breath, ignoring the tightness that came with that action before he was walking toward the body. Towards the familiar trench coat. Towards the familiar pull that used to scare him but right now he was so happy to feel it again. He was running before he knew it and when he tripped, he only kept crawling. Desperate to finally have him in his arms again.
When Sam came he was talking about work and about how not so bad it is to work with Gabriel as a partner in their law firm. He mentioned how he was dating again and that he was adopting another dog. He was happy and didn’t look so tired and old from late nights of hunting or trials. When it was time to open presents he sat with Cas on the couch, both of them so close together they might as well be sitting on top of each other, watching as Claire opened present after present. He liked turning his head and kissing Cas on the cheek or lips, even for those few seconds. He liked the idea of going to bed tonight with Cas even though he has been doing it for so long.
"And this is Sam and his munchkin girlfriend Jess. Don't let the smile fool you, she's evil." Dean warns Cas and that got him a punch on the shoulder from Jess and a bigger smile from Cas. His smile seems to grow after every introduction and when he got to his Dad he stiffened up. "Relax Cas."
Something in the way her eyes went cold and far away made his fight drain out. He didn’t know what else he could do or say, but he opened his arms just in time to have her fall against him. His face mushed into her curls while he hugged her tight into his chest.
"Dean!" Dean turned to the sound of his name and saw one of the producer ladies waving at him through a door. "This way please."
"Dean this is Gabriel." Short. Longish hair but not as long as Sam's. "Balthazar." He was tall and he had this smirk on his face like he just did something bad but nobody had caught him yet. "And Alfie." Alfie looked young. Like adorable kid kind of young.
"Oh, we wouldn't miss our Cassie getting married for the world." Balthazar said and Cas turns slightly pink but still smiled warmly at all three of them.
Cas jumped into Dean and wrapped his arms around his neck to bring him down for a kiss. This time Dean reacted as he dropped the bags in his hand and wrapped his arms around Cas to kiss him back.
Dean walked into the hospital room carrying two duffles, mostly filled with clothes and stuff Cas may like and some hex bags for protection. Lucky for him his little brother is dabbling more into witchcraft and can successfully make them a charm too.
Claire drove with loud rocker girl music vibrating the windows and didn’t stop until she finally parked outside some ice cream shop.
“Good morning, Dean.” Cas walked into the kitchen, dragging his bunny slippers across the cold floor and towards the coffee machine.
Cas doesn’t come out to see him the next day or the day after that, and now he has to wait until next week to see him. If Cas still wanted to see him.
Dean drove them home while Cas turned on the radio. Tapping his fingers on his knee to the beat of the music. Dean wondered how Cas would react if he just reached over and twined their hands together but instead he gripped the steering wheel tighter.
She rolled her eyes, once again the gesture was familiar, before slamming the shake on the hood and sliding off the car. She crossed her arms over her chest, looking so small as she kicked a pebble on the floor.
They drove back with the music luckily a little lower but Dean just watched Claire drive with a growing smile on his face. He’s gonna have to admit that
Dean doesn’t remember how many movies they watched that night or how he ended up falling asleep on a couch too small to hold two grown men. But he didn’t care because now he had Cas’s fingers making small circles on his back and the touch was so gentle.
Dean shrugs. “Potential customers then.” Dean grabs another napkin and reaches to wipe the tears that were already falling. “Estas bien, Angelito. Talk to me.”
"What are you doing outside, Sammy?" Dean called as he walked towards him and Sam turned to give him a big grin. "Come here. Let me fix that tie."
"Shall we get started?" Dean turned towards the minister that he didn't even notice was even there and nodded as he pulled his hand away from Cas. "You can run out now."
“Jack!” Dean called out as he laid Castiel on the floor, careful not to touch his still raw bleeding arms.
Cas nodded and started walking to sit on the chair, but Dean cleared his throat loudly to get his attention. He held his hand out and motioned for Cas to come over to him. They haven’t cuddled outside these four walls, and maybe that’s what made Dean so brave even to suggest the idea while Cas took hesitant steps forward until he took Dean’s hand, unsure of himself.
“Come on, you two. We still need to go and buy Jack some new clothes, remember?” Cas called out to them.
“In your head, you’re four,” Cas confirms while Jack nods in agreement; it was stiff and a little sad. Almost like he was regretting talking about this to them. “And it’s not the body you see yourself in.”
Sam held back a laugh, tried hiding it in a cough but Dean saw right through his dumb grin. “Wow, you know if you need a break I could always step in.”
He still wasn’t sure if he was going to apply. Not yet anyway. Not with two new humans in his family with fucked up heads and sleep schedules.
“I can take all those pesky memories away, Cas. Leave in all the fun and good, so you can just live.”
Dean watched him walk away, unable to figure out words to stop or comfort the kid when he was so close to falling apart himself. He knew they were both feeling guilty for being so unaware of Cas’s pain. Realizing that what they saw before didn’t even scratch the surface of the old mind of this multidimensional creature turned man.
“I love you.” Dean leaned in and pressed a kiss to Cas’s cheek, hearing the shocking breath he took, before turning to really look at Dean. He took a fistful of Dean’s shirt, pulling him closer, as his squinty eyes looked him over, looking for something before he relaxed. Finding it.
"Okay, we are going to start in five. Four. Three. Two." And they didn't say the one before the little red light was on in the big main cameras.
“You can have me.” One of his arms wrapped around Cas’s shoulders while his other hand found itself cradling the back of Cas’s head. His fingers curling around the hair while his face hid into Cas’s shoulder. “I want you too.”
“Come on, my little girl, go with Jack!” Dean tried pushing her, but she wasn’t budging as she sat in between Cas’s legs, already resting her head on Cas’s knees, whining to get scratches.
Castiel, he’s Steve to those around him, learns pretty quickly that he doesn’t like his hair tugged.
“That he can film us any other time that we are not in our room and I will film us,” Dean got out a small camera and held it out to Cas with a big grin. “While we are in our room. It’s more like vlogs. Not like creepy filming.”
He took deep breaths, not wanting to be angry or raise his voice, but these are things he kept pushing so deep into himself that acknowledging it will only make the levee of his stow-away crap spill. And he can’t have that. He had to stand strong. He had people that depended on him. He can’t be doing this. He can’t be sulking and drowning in his guilt when he should be focusing on Cas. On his new human son. On his brother. On Eileen. And he hasn’t even checked in with Donna or Jody this week.
, his childhood Christmas movie he watched with Dad, but Dean had a feeling that Cas wanted a movie where it was actually about Christmas. So he picked his other childhood Christmas movie.
Dean turned his head so his cheek was resting on his arm while Cas’s fingers slowly hovered over his cheek and down the bridge of his nose. He sniffled just a little before he repeated Cas’s words back to him. “I wish I could heal you.”
Cas looked at Dean and squeezed the hand he was holding, it seemed to relax Cas more if he held his hand, before he nodded. "Nice to meet you sir."
“So does this mean you two are staying married?” The host lady, Dean should have really learned her name but he doesn’t care enough to do so. Instead, he nodded.
"Sorry." He mumbles and pins his arms to his side so he wouldn't move them but then he looked up to see the smiling faces of the family who was sitting across from his own. A lot of the seats were filled and Cas was jealous. "Hello."
Porfa, to excuse my bad spanish again. I am not getting a beta for this fic since I am dumb so perdon. Pero, gracias de leer <3
When Cas pulled away to take a breath, he felt his hair tugged so he could look up at the man who made him feel small. It made him realize that his once great self was long gone, and this is all that’s left. He hated it. Hated this man. Hated himself. Hated the whole damn world.
“Do that.” Dean quickly answered as they stopped in front of the store’s doors. Dean looked down at their hands. “Just keep holding it.”
That was the only response he knew he was going to get from his angel - oh wow! Not his. Not even a damn angel anymore.
Cas opened his mouth to say no. To finally tell the only person who still called him by his name with warmth and concern, he was so fucking miserable. That he wished he was fucking dead than to walk another step in this life.
Dean thought it through, imagining meeting Cas in a normal timeline. Where they are both teenagers, in love, going on stupid cliche dates, and nervously kissing each other for the first time. Dean wished he remembered...Wished this was real. The small voice in the back of the head reminded him that this is real and he believed. Just because he wanted to believe.
was working on it. Just cause he saved the world, and everything was calm for now doesn’t mean he was now filled with the ability to communicate. He was trying, damn it, but it just isn’t always so easy to ask for forgiveness when he wholeheartedly doesn’t believe he deserved it.
“Hey.” He reaches over with one hand to lay on his boyfriend’s cheek. “How are you doing, sweetheart? You hungry? We can go to the diner we passed getting into town.”
Dean hummed a response as his eyes traveled down to Cas’s tongue poking out to lick at his lips. His heart was hammering in his chest until it came to a stop when he heard, “Dean! Oye, cabron! I ain’t calling your name again!”
“It’s going to be okay. I get it.” Jack stood up, and without looking back at Dean, he muttered. “I need some air.” And began to walk away.
"No! No, it's not that at all Dean." Cas reassured him as he blinked and came back to life somehow. "I just can't believe I- we got married. It's so bizarre."
He has a list of stuff he doesn’t enjoy, while the list has for things he does enjoy is currently blank. He can’t speak of his discomfort out loud; he also learned that pretty quickly because people won’t pay him, and he needed the money for food. Or at least enough for a night at a motel where he can just sleep in a bed all alone. Not to be woken up by a stranger telling him he had to leave or wanted something else from him when all Cas wanted was to be dead to the world. To dream of a life where he had a home. Had a family. Had somebody.
Ellen and Bobby came into the kitchen too, Claire hugging Bobby and kissing his cheek. Cas was talking to Ellen about what she brought in the tupperware dishes while Dean can feel his eyes tear up upon seeing them, seeing Bobby. He didn’t know why since he sees them all the time. He rubs his eyes and brings Ellen and Bobby into a hug as soon as he could.
Dean rolled his eyes and hugged his baby brother back. "I'll be in my best behavior, bitch. Plus it's going to be on tv soon."
Thanks for reading and commenting! I haven't written anything that has gotten a lot of attention like this before so I hope it wasn't disappointing to anyone. Thank you for sticking with me!
Then Dean walked closer and heard, understood, what Cas is saying. It wasn’t singing like he originally thought. No. Cas was almost maniacally chanting.
If Jack wasn’t ready to hear his shit apologizes and excuses, then Dean wasn’t going to pressure him on it. He wanted to give the kid some space, too, but he also didn’t want to give him the impression that he was keeping his distance from him or didn’t want him around. Fuck, this was all giving him a headache now.
What the fuck was he supposed to say to that? Luckily his voice decided to leave him at that moment, so he can only respond with a single stiff nod. He didn’t even realize his hands were gripping at Cas’s t-shirt, shaking in its tight hold around the fabric.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, pushing away from Cas so he can walk over to sit on the edge of the kitchen table. His hand scrubbed down his face as he looked down at his slippers. “But whatever I gotta do to make sure that
“I was dreaming. I think. Like what a djinn does. I been through this before but before I dreamed my Mom was alive and Sam was at school with Jess. Everything was normal. No monsters.”
She screamed in frustration until her punches weakened, and he was holding her. Then, finally, she fell against him, her face hidden in his chest as her grip tightened on his shirt.
His family was supportive and they were all coming to his wedding today, Sam was even sleeping in his old room while his Dad didn't pick up a bottle last night so he wouldn't have a hangover today to help him get ready. It was finally a day where Dean can think about himself but he wasn't doing that. He was worrying too much about his...fiancé. Of course, he isn't picky but he worried if they are okay or if they are having second thought about the whole thing and not show up. He worries about things like if they ate breakfast or if they got the right kind of socks on.
“How about I read you a bedtime story?” Dean offered too quickly. “I used to do it to Sam when he was a kid. He would knock right out.”
“And who’s Jack to you? Before you have called him your little brother, but Jack told me otherwise. I also sensed hostility back then.”
Feeling Cas wrap his arms around Dean’s neck to hold him as their grins were so close together made Dean’s heart leap. Eventually, Cas’s forehead fell against Dean’s, and the dancing slowed to a nice sway even though the beat was only getting quicker.
Dean didn’t answer. Instead, he leaned forward to capture Cas’s lips again. Kissing him until he was dizzy because kissing Cas was the best change in his life. Having him. Loving him. He can do this for as long as forever.
You’re mine. Was what Dean wanted to say but instead, let Cas pull him back into a kiss. It was softer this time and not as desperate so Dean melted into it.
“Fuck.” He let his head fall into his arms as his shoulders slumped down, trying to hide his own quiet cries.
“Gross.” She pushed him away this time, tucking her hair behind her ear before smiling at him. It reminded him of Jack’s little shy smile. “But I-I think you’re right. Maybe I’m done wasting time.”
“Yeah. Apparently, John really fucked me up because he is the subject of the next session too.” He tried not to make it sound like a big deal. Cas knew everything that John ever did; the whole rebuilding of him kinda made Dean an open book to Cas. “Mary too. Bobby. You know…parents.”
The sun was setting already, and Dean was sitting on the blanket with Cas, who was grinning from ear to ear because Miracle kept climbing onto his lap whenever Dean would lean over to kiss his boyfriend. His lips landing on her fur instead, and then he’ll have to be quick to block her kisses.
“Dean! You scared me!” Cas said as he put the spatula down and turns down the fire before turning to Dean with a grin he has never seen on his Cas. Dean loved it and couldn’t help but reach to lay a hand on Cas cheek. “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
“We are both dealing with this differently, Cas, but I promise you, I’m still the fuck up mess you first met. Probably worse.”
may not be your Dad, but he loves you like a daughter. Sometimes—yeah, a lot of the time actually—he makes stupid decisions, but it’s cause he is trying his best. And he cares. That
"I'm coming! I'm coming!" Dean said as he turned off the water and wrapped a towel around his waist. "Keep your panties on."
“Dean? Have you seen Jack? He’s not in his-.” Cas walked into the room with a doggy bag in his grip while he stopped short when Dean shushed him.
“Fuck.” Cas hands rest on his knees as he tries to catch his breath. “Are you-are you trying to run away from me?” Cas looks up with a teasing smile, it was beautiful, and Dean didn’t realize how much he missed him until now. “I am your only customer around here, so that’s a pretty bad business decision if you ask me.”
"Your mother would have loved to be here." John said and it surprised Dean because he never mentions Mary. Ever. Dean even had to hide all there photographs and whatever reminded him of her because that's how hard of a time he had accepting her death. Right away Dean got that talking about his mom was a big no-no and if Sam had a question about her he would ask Dean somewhere where John couldn't hear them. A few times Sam would ask John and that never ended so well...for Dean at least.
had been dealing with the silent treatment from the killer Barbie. She only replied with the thumbs-up emoji, and when
“Well, you can try, but you are quite annoying.” Cas looked away from Jack to give Dean a smug little side smile and — fuck — just seeing the same pair of blue eyes coming from his son and boyfriend really just made his stomach do flips.
“It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Dean, I-” Cas was interrupted when Dean pulled him from his shirt collar and kissed him. Cas tasted like peppermint. His lips were warm and chapped. Dean has never knew anything more real than Cas.
The too-small plastic couch was making him miss his bed so much he could cry over it, and he’s been doing a lot of crying, but instead, he tried to make himself comfortable. That’s when Dean starts to listen to the words, to the voices, and realizes that he can’t move.
“Victor,” Dean called his friend over again. “No le digas a nadie que estaba aquí. Okay? Or I’m gonna steal all your customers otra vez.”
And with that Cas fell asleep for the first time as Castiel James Winchester. He really liked the sound of that.
They sat Cas down on the bed as he squirmed and looked at Dean with wide pleading eyes. The whites in his eyes were almost nonexistent as he licked his lips slowly. He tried to get up a couple of times but Sam pushed him back down while he sent Dean to stand on the other side of the room. Dean was gonna complain about how he didn’t want Sam near Cas too because he looked like he was slowly losing control and he wasn’t sure how he’d react if Cas did kiss Sam.
And that’s how slowly Cas closet began to fill up. What was once empty now held hangers filled with different shirts that Dean bought him. Even in the middle of a hunt, Dean will ask the witness, “Sorry but where’d you get that shirt?”
Cas froze for a second, just long enough for Dean to notice, before he relaxed and looked at Dean with a small smile. “It sounds...perfect.”
She barked again before whining, understanding more of Dean’s tone, but sometimes he did wonder if she did understand his words.
He flipped the phone open, and the light of the cell hurt his eyes but he blinked a couple of times until he could read the screen. He had eight missed calls and ten text messages waiting for him.
So Jack went to help settle things back down in the big empty and hopefully, fuck, please dear god please, will come back with Cas by his side. Jack had been complaining that the Empty makes him not only powerless in there but also tiers him out. So they would have to go look for them if - no,
Dean gently finished cleaning as much as he could from Cas before standing up to face Amara. She was much more powerful than before, and yeah, that fucking scared him, but he still manages to trust her not to hurt him. To hurt them. He was afraid of what she would ask of him because, of course, nothing ever came without a price to pay.
He hasn’t wanted to talk much about the Empty or any of his nightmares for the past week but Dean didn’t bug him about it. He’ll talk when he’s ready. In the meantime, Dean would do what he can to bring as much comfort to him as he could. Even if it meant sleeping with the light on and humming a familiar song until Cas can fall asleep again.
“Ugh…kiss.” Cas whined as he moved just enough to press a soft lingering kiss on Dean. A sigh of relief washed over him before he went back to hiding behind Dean’s back.
She motions for him to join her and holds out another glass with at least three fingers of whisky in it. He takes it but can’t make himself drink it; he just stares into the glass cup, waiting for her to talk finally.
Cas fluttered his baby blues at him before he gripped Dean’s arm. “I wish I asked for these a long time ago.”
Dean wasn’t telling Cas until it was a sure-fire plan, but he didn’t want Cas to remember this painful time. He already has enough to deal with without visible scars to remind him.
They did, and Dean’s breath catches in his throat before he works on chicharrones, lots of limon, and a little bit of chile.
“It’s what he wanted.” Amara continued. “What he needed, really. It’s a gift he was never going to ask for because, just like my little nephew,” Her eyes traveled to Cas before looking back at Dean. “that you’re so…
Dean came back downstairs clean and with the Christmas sweater he has found in the closet on. He followed the scent of bacon and found Cas making breakfast in the kitchen. Dean was sure it was his Cas when he heard him singing roughly to the jingle bell rock. Maybe Cas will know what’s happening.
They somehow moved closer on the couch with every little comment Cas made. From the mention of yellow eyes. To ask what was put in Ralph’s mouth after he said fudge.
Sometimes Cas would wake him up by clinging to him or his screams, but other times, Dean would wake up to an empty bed.
“We had a deal. You get me off, and I pay. Simple.” Cas heard before he was lifted by his shirt and pinned against the truck’s cold metal. “It’s not good to break a client’s trust like that.”
“Lo deje en la casa!” When Dean took a step back, he put his arm around Cas’s shoulder to squeeze him close. “Pero, I brought a new customer.”
His smile took Dean’s breath away, and all he wanted was to lean forward to kiss it, but even he wasn’t comfortable with that yet. Soon though. Maybe soon.
Jack climbs off of Dean and runs out of the room, Dean listening to the quick little squeaks fading away before he lets his face fall into his hands. Once again, he wondered if he was that small when John gave him so much responsibility.
Dean’s leg has been shaking nonstop since sitting down on the couch. He never thought he would be back to visit Mia, let alone come back to have an actual therapy session. It all started as a suggestion for Cas, who was doing better, sleeping a little longer, but was still dealing with phantom pain on his arms. Nightmares still woke them up at different times of the night, and one night Cas had even snapped at Dean, who was trying to help him back to bed.
Cas nodded as he placed a hand on the back of Dean's neck to pull him down for a kiss, hoping morning breath won't bother him like it wouldn't bother Cas. "Yes. Adorable."
Cas stayed stiff under Dean’s arm as they ordered and waited for their food. Eventually, Dean couldn’t help himself; the street light and the neon sign were the only things keeping this place lit, but it was still pretty dark, so he turned his face to press his nose against Cas’s temple.
“You aren’t coming with,” Dean mutters to him before begging Bobby again. “Tio, I’ll take Sammy with me tomorrow! Nomas hoy no.”
"Not much has changed since then." Cas spoke up and he looked at Dean quickly before he looked back at the host. "I did get a promotion at work and a new car."
“I love you.” Cas said into his neck as the tears kept falling, he sniffled as he let out another broken. “I love you, Dean.”
As soon as Cas opened the door, Dean felt so sure that there was nothing more right than having Cas sitting in his passenger side.
Then he felt a hand on his back, gently rubbing it up and down, before he heard, “It’s okay, Dean. Dad’s going to be okay.”
“That’s why I’m asking now.” Cas looked back at him before he sucked in a shaky breath when his eyes fell into Dean’s lips. “As you say, I saw the chance, and I wanna take it.”
So Cas gives him the exact change to the quarter and smiles sadly before he waves goodbye. Dean waves back as he gets on his bike to pedal out of this neighborhood and into a more comfortable one. He didn't ring the bell until he was out of there.
“As a person and not a fantasy in my head. Yeah. I got that. But what was so wrong and keeping her in my head? Was my life not shit enough for you. Did the one -
Apparently, not saying anything was just as offensive as saying something because then he felt a ring-covered knuckle strike his mouth and send his head back to hit a metal knob. He wished he could have just slept until he was gone, not wanting to deal with pain, but this will do too. As long as the job was done, then he didn’t care how he went anymore.
Dean and Jack’s relationship still wasn’t the best. Whenever Dean tried to do anything alone with him, Jack always found an excuse not to do it or invite Cas along. He has tried to apologize and talk about it a few times, but Jack always held his hand up to stop him. To tell him it was okay and he understood, but Dean just couldn’t believe him when Jack can’t look him in the eyes.
Dean swallowed before he nodded, grabbing the duffle from Cas’s grasp so he could carry them both. “I’m right behind you.”
Everyone else came in next along with his best friends Charlie and Benny. They all excitedly got ready and looked pretty for the cameras that Dean keeps forgetting are there. He was jumpy and pacing the room most of the time as he drank some cold water to keep him from burning up in this damn suit.
Claire is too mad to even look at Cas let alone talk to him. Dean knew he had to step up because two people with messed up childhoods and anger issues really need to spend more time together talking about their feelings.
Life really has a way of pulling the rug from right under him sometimes, and yeah, sure, his life was constantly controlled by God himself, but who the fuck thought Dean would ever be walking down a grocery store with a little four-year-old in his cart giggling for Dean to go faster.
When the last vamp head rolled on the ground Dean groaned as he stretched his hand out for a high five from Cas. Cas quickly high five him as he was always quick to humor Dean with small things because Cas knew it was the small things that meant a lot to Dean.
Dean quickly pulled Cas into a tight hug knowing his boyfriend responded more with physical touch than words. It took a couple of seconds before Cas relaxed into the embrace, his hands slowly trailing up Dean’s back until they rested to grip on his shirt.
“Our kid is crying cause he’s stuck in the wrong body. How the hell are we supposed to help him, Cas?” Cas was sitting at the edge of the bed, only watching Dean with defeated shoulders. Yeah, Dean knew Cas had no answers but talking out loud was helping him vent. “That’s his body! It’s not a damn vessel like — it’s not a vessel, right?”
Cas was not used to someone saying things like that and he couldn't help the big smile that now spread on his lips.
She shrugged, her lips pinching together as if trying to hold something back, before retaking control of her expression. A glare directed towards Dean replaced the lost child stare into the stars, but the lost child was still there.
Cas meet Dean's eyes again and he wanted to read Dean's expression for the right answer but he couldn't find it. "I would like to...sleep?"
Dean's eyes widen with fear as he thought maybe Castiel would leave now but luckily he didn't move instead told the minister to continue. "Unless you want to-?"
Before it went too far Cas pulled away and rested his forehead against Dean’s shoulder. “I’m…I’m sorry.”
It has only been a few hours of Amara, but Dean could see Cas tense up with every second, his eyes never looking over at where Amara was talking and mostly humming in response.
“I can give you a ride home if you want.” The words escaped his lips before he stopped himself. So he tried to play it off as cool as he could. He gave Cas - fuck Cas was right there - a wink and smile.
Now he lost his chance at another life, and he would die at the hands of an angry man. If not by this one, he was sure his death would have involved an angry man. He just figured it would have been the angry man that called him three times a week to check if he ate. To check if he was doing fine or if he needed anything.
“Dean.” Cas hesitantly stretched his arms out to grab at Dean’s waist, he was never one to initiate touch, always waiting for Dean to do it so he would be comfortable with it, but right now, he held Dean’s hips in a firm grasp. “Look at me.”
“Oh.” Cas stood up straight as he ran a hand through his overgrown hair; his clothes looked neat again, though. “I didn’t mean to make you think-”
Cas leaned into him a little more, untucking his feet from underneath him so he could lay them flat on the ground. Dean noticed every fidget of Cas’s fingers and he wondered if Cas was uncomfortable with the closeness but then in a sudden move Cas had an arm around Dean’s shoulders. Cas cleared his throat as he squeezed Dean’s shoulder closer to him - trying to act like this was a normal thing for them- while Dean stared at him with wide eyes.
Dean rolled his eyes, his tongue poking at his cheek because he knew what Cas would say. He has memorized those words already and, still, he isn’t sure if he deserved to hear them. When Dean didn’t look at him, he felt Cas’s hand reach to cup his cheek gently, and Dean sighed, letting his hand fall into the rough hand, before covering it with one of his own.
Dean looked back down at Cas’s arms and hands that were bleeding, red and raw, from the hot water and sponge he was scrubbing against his skin. He tried to swallow back the lump growing in his chest because right now wasn’t the time to get emotional. No. Right now, Cas needed him. He needed to take care of him. Help him.
When Monday rolls around, Dean forces himself to come down Cas’s street again. The bells rang softly at first, only getting louder as he came closer to the house. He didn’t see a car in sight, so he thinks maybe Cas isn’t home.
“No.” Dean looks back at Jack, seeing the little face frown at him. “How about you go bother your Dad. You know he’s probably doing that hippie meditating thing, but he’s actually-”
“How can I? I made the kid into a damn bomb! I made him into a weapon!” Dean heard his voice raise, and he saw Mia blink at him in shock for a second before she fixed her expression. He shook his head as he shut his eyes tight. Spitting things through his teeth. “I made him think that he was only useful if he
Cas stayed quiet then as if reading Dean’s mind but Dean trusted the angel not to do that. “Are you…no never mind.”
“He looks so peaceful.” Cas lifted the folded blanket at Jack’s feet and covered him with it. A soft fond smile playing on his lips while Dean stopped reading to catch the interaction. Watched as Cas’s fingers brush Jack’s hair back while he seemed to visibly relax before he looked up to meet Dean’s gaze. “Why are you still reading to him if he’s asleep?”
Dean laughed and it always felt like he was floating when it was Cas who made him laugh. Yeah, he can live like this. If he can have these mornings everyday then he can live with Cas as his friend.
Dean heard a little whine, and he looked down to see Miracle looking up at him, nudging his leg with her nose until his hands reached down to pet her.
Miracle found them in the bathroom a second later and started pushing her way in between Cas and Dean.
“Cause,” Dean took a deep breath. “Cause I didn’t like that dude kissing you and ripping your shirt like that.”
“You do.” He challenged back. Glaring back at Dean as he tries to take the shopping bags back but Dean keeps holding them back. “You have every right to be mad and I-”
"Time to get this show on the road," Dean said as he drove out of the driveway and towards to hotel where he would be getting married to a stranger.
“I know Jack never ratted me out on how much of a dick I was when you…before you came back. When Jack was born, I mean, but if I have to admit this to someone, then I think it should be you.”
“She’s gay, dude.” Dean tells him and then calls back to Charlie over his shoulder. “If Bobby calls, tell him I went home with a headache!”
Dean quickly followed after his boyfriend and ran to his son, standing by the water, looking down at his hands.
“What the fuck is going on?” Dean whispers to himself as he looked through memories he knows he doesn’t have. Dean started to pile everything back in the box and that’s when he noticed a gold wedding band on his finger. “Oh hell…”
“Yeah!” Jack runs to him, and Dean pushes his chair out for Jack to climb into his lap. He gives Dean a big hug before he looks over at the open books. “I can help!”
was in the hospital. She freaked out, yelled at him for being stupid, and then passed out by his bed only to leave the next morning like nothing ever happened. Still, it made
“Okay, well, you better get your Christmas sweater on before Dad gets all fussy about it.” Claire said with a smile as she started to walk away but then she ran back towards Dean and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “Merry Christmas by the way.”
Cas is healing up in the hospital but him and Dean still need to heal emotionally. Special Appearance from favorite brother. The Hurt and Comfort they needed.
Dean turns towards the voice and sees Cas walking into the kitchen. His hair was growing out more, and Cas rarely puts anything in it, but it was still sticking up at random places. His beard was also coming out nicely, he looked so human with it, and Dean wanted to go over to him now and just run his fingertips through it. He looked so…is handsome the word? Beautiful.
“No. No, of course, you didn’t. Cause if you did, then you wouldn’t have-” She bit her cheek as tears started to fall. She stood tall, presenting as strong, as her expression harden.“You left
“If you want me to. I’ll understand.” Cas’s voice was lower, almost hurt. Not in the same pained grumble, he has been using the last two days but still, it hurt to hear him like that.
Dean felt a kiss on top of his head that made him realize how cold he was because as soon as he felt those lips in his hair, he warmed right up. As if he came back to life.
Dean ran with Jack giggling in his arm before he stopped beside Cas and put his free arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders while they walked.
He was about to take it as a rejection, and he had a speech ready if this did happen, but then Cas firmly ordered, “Put it on me.”
“So what?” Dean sat down on the chair at the end of the table to be between them, be close, while he put the cups in front of them. “You feel like you have some kind of Benjamin Button disease?”
Looking at Dean he was sure this was all a joke or a huge mistake. Dean was...he was beyond what he can ever imagine. He was beautiful and handsome any word that would be a synonym for drop-dead gorgeous that's what this man was.
Mira. No se. I just know I needed to post this cause I had it for a while so I can motivate myself to finish cause the fandom has been a lot lately aka j2 breaking up and the spn revival. Gonna finish the next and maybe last part this weekend so yay! Hold me to it!
Dean looks away, packing the ice into the cup before reaching to pour the vainilla as he talks. “Yeah, I know you can, pero; I just wanted to let you know that you don’t have to.”
“¡Estas pendejo! After this, you’re gonna help me clean the bathroom and throw away the trash before Tio comes home.”
“Cas!” Dean ran over to kneel beside him as Rowena reassured him that he was fine. He’ll wake up soon enough back to his old self.
Cas looked at him with the same confused squint before his eyes widen. Dean watched as he flustered just a little, looking down at their hands again with the smallest fond smile.
Cas grinned as he looked back at Dean, his hand reaching to cradle his face gently. His thumb was caressing Dean’s freckles on his cheek before he happily announced. “
I hope you all know that this whole story was literally inspired by 15x18. Well, just Cas's confession. Also, all the chapter titles are song names that I listened to while writing the chapter. I just suck at chapter titles.
And that’s how Jack ended up sleeping on Cas’s side of the bed while Dean sat against the headboard, reading from Charlie’s old copy of The Hobbit.
“Night.” Dean closed his eyes and relaxed into the touch, his hand reaching to cover Cas’s own for a second before they pulled back. Back to their sides.
As soon as he was inside Ellen pushed him out. "Nope! Get in your car and heat her up. As soon as your damn father finds the tie I bought him we are leaving!"
Cas opened his arms, and Dean hesitated for a second before taking Cas’s offer and fell into him. Knocking them both back into the bed as they stayed watching the cement ceiling reflect stars from Cas’s night light.
“Merry...Christmas.” Dean stood in the stairway confused as he sees Claire leave and it wasn’t until he heard her door close that he slowly walked back upstairs and to the room he was in. Maybe he can enjoy this dream?
This was supposed to be a safe nonromantic movie but Dean hasn’t watched it in a while. He forgot the ending when the parents sat in the dark, just like they were in now, and enjoyed the snow falling. With only the Christmas lights shining.
Dean only nodded once before Cas fell back into him. Their lips smashing together into a grinning kiss, teeth smacking together, as Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist to pull him closer. Then he pulled away just enough to kiss Cas again, slowly as he took everything in. Cas’s weight on his lap. Cas’s fingers on his face while he held the back of his neck. The soft noises Cas kept making at the back of his throat as they moved against each other that was making Dean crazy.
When John let go, giving a gentle pat on Dean's back and sat beside Jess and Sam out front, Dean just stared at the beautiful blue-eyed man before him. Holy crap he's nervous and usually, he's very smooth but attractive guys always make him much more nervous.
“Yes,” She sat back in her chair again. “But you can’t talk to Sam about these things, now, can you?”
They sat on the hood of the impala, eating and talking, as the sounds of the waves crashing to the shore mixed with la musica norteña coming from inside the car. Dean soon finds out that Cas doesn’t know how to dance, so he puts on one of his favorite mixtapes, and cumbia plays loudly through the speaker.
“I’m fine.” Dean dismissed him as he raked his fingers through Cas’s hair to push it back and away from his face. “Do you want your present or not?”
Dean makes it back to Cas, who automatically reaches for the drinks to help, and motions for him to walk back to the car.
They pulled apart, and Dean jogged over alone to grab their bag of food. Dean decided to get a few of his favorites and drinks.
Sam was in the kitchen sharing a beer with Gabriel who just needed to answer little Cassie’s prayers.
Everything was falling into place so easily. Everything was normal and happy just like it should be.
Cas is married and his husband is not only a good kisser but he doesn't snore. Cas could see by the change of clothes that Dean was the bad boy type that everyone wants but he was kind, from what Cas has seen. He liked that Dean always ask permission to first kiss him and he always seems to ask Cas how he feels about things before they do it. He even carried all of Cas bags for him and explained the camera people to strangers by saying, "We just got married. I'm a lucky son of a bitch right?"
When Sam asked if everyone was ready, Cas reached to squeeze Dean’s hand once he let go. Then the witches started to get down to work, the electricity started to go haywire, and the bunker went into a full lockdown mode, but nobody worried about that. Right now, everyone’s focus was on their kid.
Cas was told he will be waiting on the aisle and it took a bit of time to calm him down from his small panic attack but as soon as he checked himself in the mirror again, and the cameraman said he looks good, he went to the room where the wedding should be happening.
Grocery shopping took a while even though the place was mostly empty. Dean had a list and Cas kept ignoring it to add random junk he wanted to taste. Some of the stuff Dean hasn’t even tasted himself, “Then we can experience it together.” Was all Cas said and Dean couldn’t argue with him on that.
arms on the couch. Dean quickly walked over to pick him up, pressing a kiss to his head while trying not to let guilt eat at him. “Is Dad okay?”
“I got you a present.” Dean dropped the bags on the one plastic half couch that he has been using as a bed the last two days before walking over to drop a kiss on the top of Cas’s head. “It’s for protection.”
"Fine, son. Just dandy." He gulped down and reached to pull his tie off but then he thought it threw and didn't touch it. John’s hands were shaking along with his jumping leg but that's all the signs that Dean can read. Of course, this isn't easy on him and Dean understood that and that's why he was thankful that John was willing to stop drinking for the day.
Sorry, the chapter is so late! My fever kinda spiked today than the days before so I slept in a little and moving the screen was making me dizzy lol but I finished writing! Now I'm hoping it made sense but if it didn't then let me know...I will reread it and fix it haha
“You’re all dead! You’re gone!” Dean yells at them and the first to disappear is Jo. Gabe goes next along with Ellen. Bobby was slow to fade away but now he was alone with Sam, Cas, and Claire. He turns and runs up stairs to the room where he woke up in. Maybe if he lies back down and sleeps he will wake up in the real world again.
, and it wasn’t until he saw Claire run down those steps that the world focused again. She smiled at him, a rare big grin, before her arms wrapped around his neck to bring him down for a hug with an intoxicating giggle.
On the drive back, Cas and Dean fell asleep in the back seat, bodies slumped together, Dean resting his head on Cas’s shoulder, while Jack fell asleep in the passenger side with his head against the window. Sam drove, smiling as he took his family back home.
“I love my Mom.” Dean marches to her this time. Looking her over to make sure she was listening to his words. “And I hate her so much, but I love her. And now, because of you, I lost her twice. I lost the Mom I thought I had all over again. And I lost Mary.”
“Dean.” Cas sighed as he roughly slid a hand down his face. “Do you think this is about the other day? He has been quieter since that woman yelled at him.”
Sam was right he did not give a single damn about anything right now cause all he wanted was more of whatever the hell was going on. Cas pulled Dean on top of him, straddling the angel as Cas hands pinned his waist down. Their lips and breaths becoming more desperate as Cas muttered, “More. Dean. I need more.”
"Forgot how you guys just pop out of nowhere," Dean comments and then noticed it was a familiar face. "Jim, right?"
“Taste better when you do it.” Just as Dean walked down the kitchen steps, Cas reached to take his hand, pulling him back. “Can I also ask for a hug?”
Dean decided that driving wasn’t the best idea as the last time they stopped at a red light Cas pulled Dean’s head back to kiss him until he was dizzy. The honking was ignored but Sam made the right call to do the driving from now on.
Maybe he should have cooled it with the cumbia, making it too obvious that Dean was in a good mood because as soon as he was heading out the door—smelling great, he may add—su Tio called him over to the kitchen.
Jack looked between them, trying to focus, and when he opened his mouth to answer, no sound came out. Instead, Jack’s eyes watered before he threw himself at his Dad, almost knocking him down before he cried into Cas’s shoulder.
Dean falls back against the couch again as his hands start to tingle, so he squeezes his fist a little. As if he had an invisible stress ball in his palm.
Dean having Cas. Sam having Eileen. It was more than either of them thought they would have. Sharing their life with someone and being happy was more than either of them ever asked for, but here they
“Ask Eileen if she needs anything.” Dean hit his brother’s arm from where he sat in the Impala's passenger seat while Dean drove them. “We can drop it off at her place on the way back.”
Dean petals a little bit faster until he breaks in front of the pretty face he sees at least three times a week.
When Rowena did end up coming Cas was in the middle of following Dean around the room whining about another kiss. Dean had his phone to his ear while trying to push Cas off of him. “Dude, back off I’m on a call.”
Dean could feel the relief wash over him as he heard those words. Maybe old habits are hard to break but adding new ones was surprisingly getting easier.
Dean was in the middle of emailing Garth back some pictures of Jack and Cas so he can make the IDs with the same last name and maybe have the same story when he heard a knock on his bedroom door.
Dean tried to ignore him as he was in the middle of talking to the damn witness of the last witch attack, the poor guy humped himself to death in a crowded bar, while Cas kept rubbing himself against Dean’s ass. Sam tried to step forward, noticing as Cas pushed himself closer against Dean’s back in a not so appropriate way to do in public. Luckily Sam ushered the witness away before they noticed.
This is going to be something new for all of them, considering it wasn’t in the parenting books Cas insists Dean reads in his spare time, but they will get through it. They will figure out a way to make Jack happy with who he is.
A wave of 'hello's and hi's happened and Cas smiled at them. He wanted to ask them a lot of questions, and by the look on their faces so did they, but then the familiar song started to play so Cas stood taller and waited for those doors to open and show him who he was to be wed with.
Ahi esta! La confirmación que necesitaba. This is an actual date! Pero, las palabras no le dieron pánico. No. Instead, Dean squeezed Cas’s hand as he laughed, feeling like he would just fly away if he didn’t hold on.
Sam rarely comes with Dean to get all these things since he was always busy with school, but today he came along on the day that Dean ran out of maiz azul. It just meant more trabajo para los dos.
He didn’t look up until he heard the door click close. When he was alone, he stood up and started to pace the room while he bit at his nails, something he hasn’t done for a long time. He noticed that since some of the hero mojo left him, more of his old habits started to come back. Comforting him in knowing that these were all his actual nervous ticks, that he had nervous ticks in general. A new one that appeared was putting Cas’s grace necklace against his mouth, feeling the warm buzz tickle his lips.
Dean and Cas finally use their words. And sometimes it's too late. Sometimes it's just the relief of just knowing that makes someone truly happy.
“I’ll wake you when we get some news.” Dean patted the seat next to him again. “Come on. I can’t have both of you pass out on me.”
Dean wakes up to whispers in the middle of the night, which wasn’t anything new when the nurses and doctors came every hour to check on something. Usually, Cas would wake him up if needed, so Dean tried to go back to sleep.
“Jack!” Cas was up as they watched Miracle bark up at Jack, who was not giving her any response. Her bark and whines were getting more desperate as she nudged Jack with her head but still nothing.
Dean has an official novio for like half a night and he just can't stop thinking about it. Pero los dos son haci de pendejos.
Cas looked at him with soft, warm eyes, a small smile tugging on the side of his lip. “I’m fine. How are you?”
Dean grimaces because she was right. He can’t talk about a lot of things with his brother or Cas, for that matter.
Dean forgot about his phobia about flying until he was in the airport and was shaking like a leaf. Cas reassured him, after they changed into more comfortable clothes in the airport’s bathroom, that everything was going to be fine since it was just a short flight to Hawaii.
This was just something else Dean would have to get used to. Another change in his new life. It was for the better, of course. He wasn’t going to complain that the only sturdy and constant in his life was his brother by his side. Because he is still there, he knows this. Sam is still in his life. Hell, he’s coming over later to finish organizing some cursed things that Dean wasn’t paying attention to.
“Dean?” Dean turned to look back at Cas, humming in response. Cas looked at him for a solid three seconds before shaking his head and looking away. “Never mind. Have a safe trip.”
“The houses are nice to look at. One day, Sammy!” Sam was already groaning at Dean’s words that sounded more like an old man’s recurring ‘when I was your age’ stories. “One day, I’ll get us a house like that! One where we can each have our own room. And bathroom.”
Dean automatically wrapped his free arm around Cas’s waist and held him close to him as he glared at his brother while also speaking to the phone, “Okay, thanks. We’ll go check it out as soon as we can. Bye.”
He knew it wasn’t going to be easy for any of them to move on, even for Sam, who was debating moving in with Eileen when she asked, but he freaked out with the big step he hasn’t taken since Jess. Luckily, Eileen understood and has been staying over at the bunker more often. Making this her home with no hesitation, and Dean liked her more for it. Especially for being so understanding about their fucked up family relationships.
“El trabajo es duro but I like it.” Dean pats Sam’s shoulder before they go back to the car to get the rest of the things. “I like going down neighborhoods and saying hi to people.”
Dean lifted his arm up and Cas quickly tucked himself underneath it. Reaching to cling on to him as he took deep shaky breaths.
“No. I dreamed of perfect. Of the perfect Christmas with Ellen and Bobby being my parents. Jo was my sister. Sam and Gabe were working at some lawfirm, I think. Claire was my,” Dean cleared his throat closing his eyes as he squeezed Cas hand. “Claire was our daughter.”
“Of course.” Dean laughed before shaking the hair at the back of Cas’s head. He hasn’t cut his hair or anyone’s hair with scissors in a while, but he remembers doing it to Sam when they were little. He left Cas’s hair still a little long, loving the way Cas wakes up with all of it sticking up, but cut it short enough that it wouldn’t touch Cas’s neck or go over his ears anymore.
Cas had his back turned towards him, looking down at the sink they wash the plates in. There was a lot of steam coming up, and for a second, he wondered what mess Cas had made that he needed so much hot water to clean up.
They got out of the car as they made their way back to the room. Cas walked behind Dean, his chin resting on Dean’s shoulder as if the closeness was enough to calm him down. A small whine escaped him every few seconds but Dean just let him be. Let him wrap his arms around Dean’s waist and hide his face between Dean’s shoulder blades.
“I know!” Dean puts his drink down and holds tight to the vial as he glares back at her. “I fucking know what I fucking did, and I have no damn excuse! Okay? I was a shit wannabe Dad, and I deserve the fact that the kid hates me!”
Dean was sleeping, laying on his stomach hugging his pillow, when Cas started to shake his arm. He blinked a few times to see Cas’s intense stare and trembling lip.
“Then what’s wrong? You have been acting a little off lately. Sam only laughs and walks away when I ask him about it. Jack tends to copy Sam and excuses himself. Ever since the last case with that man-”
“What? What?” Dean rolled off the couch with his fingers already reaching for his gun, even if he was half asleep. “What’s wrong?”
But Dean couldn’t get a damn word out cause Cas also staggered in wearing just pajama bottoms and Dean’s dead-man robe left wide open so Dean could enjoy the view of his chest. Especially his tattoo that Dean liked to gawk at whenever he got the opportunity. Because underneath that ratty old trench coat and a suit that left everything to the imagination, Cas was…Right now wasn’t the best time.
—who looked like he had been sitting in that seat freaking out since they left—and asked if they could try talking outside again. He blinked up at her a few times before nodding, following her to the backyard again.
Dean pulled away and gave Cas a few quick kisses on his smile before they were asked to turn to the camera for another picture. A few more posses and kisses before it was time to say goodbye to his family and go off to their honeymoon.
It’s Christmas Eve and the bunker was quiet. It was just him and his best friend in this big place, their footsteps echoed the halls like no other time before. When it was just him and Sam the place always felt okay. It was home and it was nice but with Cas - finally human and finally staying - the place felt warm. It was a damn home again.
It felt like old times and Dean wasn’t sure if he liked it or not. It was comfortable and easy to just gravitate towards Cas again, they both seem to have the same plan of wanting to be in clear view of one another at all times, but the only difference between them now was that Cas always followed Dean to his room to sleep.
“Stay with us, Dean! Stay!” He could hear the three of them yelling again and again making it hard to sleep to concentrate on what the real Sam and Cas are saying to him. He has to wake up and go to them. He will not leave them alone. He wants to go home. His real home.
Dean was left speechless for a moment too long. By the time he forced himself to move again the car was already disappearing around the corner. He had no chance to catch it.
Dean watched with wide eyes as Cas scooted closer towards Sam and he knew he had half a second to react because his brother was about to kiss his best friend. And that shouldn’t matter. It shouldn’t bother him. It shouldn’t make his blood boil and stomach turn in pure jealousy. He shouldn’t be jealous because if he wanted to kiss Cas then he should have done so in the last hour of Cas begging him too. He has been only asking Dean again and again but Sam was asked once. Once is all it took apparently.
A small gasp breathed against Dean’s lips and it made him shiver but he started to kiss Cas back again. Their lips trying to find a rhythm as Cas started to move closer to him but the bench was in the way. His desperation was becoming known as he reached over to take Dean’s face in his hands, his fingers sliding up to run through his hair.  The kiss was softer this time and with every move of their lips, Dean wanted more.
“Oh geez, thanks.” Cas turned to roll his eyes at him as he smiled playfully while his eyes landed on Dean’s lips. “I like you today too.”
When he opened the door he was already being filmed but ignored the cameras and walked to his room to change. He figured his tux will already be there; laid out on his bed because Ellen was there. And he grinned as he opened his bedroom door and his tux and shoes laid out for him.
“These are great, Cas.” Dean laughed looking down at his gifts. “Looks like you already planned our next date night.”
Then he has Jack, who is more recently human who still wandered the halls in the middle of the night but sleeps until noon. He always says he just couldn’t sleep, so he likes to tire himself out, and they all keep finding him at random places in the bunker by morning. One morning they couldn’t find Jack anywhere until Dean finally found him curled up inside Cas’s truck and hugging his teddy bear to his chest. Dean tried his best to get him out of the car and carry him to bed without waking him. Sam helped by opening the doors for Dean while Cas trailed close in front of him just in case Dean’s arms give out.
“Dad? Dean?” They heard the quiet voice and then felt the familiar brush of Miracle knocking against their feet. “Is everything okay?”
“It won’t come off.” Cas’s voice was shaky, and he sounded as defeated as he looked. “It won’t come off. So much blood. I-I have so much blood…It won’t-It won’t come off!”
Dean took Cas’s face and kissed him softly hoping he could take his pain away. Before he glared at his brother. “Wait outside, Sam.”
“Stay with us, Daddy.” He hears Claire say and Dean shakes his head because that’s not his daughter. He doesn’t have a daughter. Claire is just learning to accept Cas. Claire is with...Jody.
When Dean did pull away Cas’s lips didn’t leave his skin. Instead, he pushed Dean’s layers off and sucked on his neck as he did so.
He didn’t feel like drowning today, but he would like to take a long hot shower and then soak in a hot bath. He would like to feel the burn of the water instead of the burn of skin against his own.
“Yeah.” Cas sighed, shoulders slumping as he reached to run his hand through his hair—that probably explains the bed head—before smiling back at Dean with a deep breath. “Yeah. I’m fine.”
“How was your session with Mia, by the way?” Cas picked up some fries; he used the claw method, which made Dean fall in love with him a little more, before looking back at Dean. “You were a little out of it when you came out. Did you talk about your father and the um…cycle?”
“Quedate?” Cas nodded, looking back at Dean, waiting for him to explain. It brought warmth to Dean’s chest, knowing he’ll have to repeat it in English when before it came out as a joke. He swallowed hard as he looked back at those baby blues. The words barely came out in a quiet whisper, “Quedate. Stay. Conmigo. With me. I said, stay with me.”
“Why did you kiss me then? If it’s not a goodbye kiss.” Cas’s alien but adorable slight tilt of the head made a welcoming appearance that made him smile. “Was it a mistake?”
"The cameras stopped shooting a few months ago. Anything you guys want to add?" The host said and Dean fought the urge to sigh with annoyance and instead sat there looking at the host as he shook his head.
