Tony looked over the letter and set it aside. It took a quick walk to find Jarvis, as he predicted. And Jarvis was indeed doing something with knives. More accurately, Jarvis was chopping celery. Tony watched his hands move smoothly as he finished the stalk and looked up. “Is something wrong?” Jarvis asked, watching him as Tony stood for a moment.
I may not be much, but I promise I will be whatever you need me to be. If that is just a friend, I understand. But if you would have me, I would like to be your boyfriend. To just know that … I am yours. And you are mine. For however long we have.
I was both delighted and surprised to receive your letter. Franklin was becoming frustrated with how often I would ask if any new mail had come; whenever he would come to visit he would not even greet me before telling me there was nothing new. But today! Today he came, armed with his ma’s soup and his sister’s bread, with good news for me. He had a letter. And when I read your words I felt flustered and enthralled. You have such a pretty way of saying things that it almost seemed you were speaking right into my heart. I am simply grateful Franklin did not notice the way your words made me blush, as he would never let me forget it.
“Demi, I support your rant, but don’t you have a flight tomorrow?” Tony asked as he grabbed the spare quilt. He turned off the mini projector as well.
After taking a couple of photos of the mural, Serena looked over at him. “Guess it’s a good thing the next stop is a bar,” she offered. “But… I did bring you something. Since you were interested in these murals, I did some digging.” Reaching into her bag, she pulled out a folder and held it out to him. “These are copies of photos we have of both murals. From different eras as art historians tried to keep track of them. Sorry, they’re not all the best quality, but…” She shrugged. “Technology.”
The war had been slogging on for a seeming eternity when the alpha’s world turned on its head. But not in the way any history book or documentary has ever told. It was yet another mission to destroy a Hydra base - this one a terrible breeding facility on the northern border of France.
When Bucky dropped the package in Steve’s lap, the blond nearly choked. “What the – Buck! You punk!” He kicked out at the man’s leg, missing entirely.
“I don’t have specifics in mind, but someone paid a great deal of money. Or someone willing to spend a lot, because I wasn’t privy to even try to examine the bodies at the wake.” Jarvis seemed to stare at the bourbon catching the light. “Or willing to pay for this information to be hidden. Aunt Peggy would have more ideas, I’m sure, but things have been difficult recently. I’ve been worried for a while.”
The anniversary of Ma’s passing is coming up soon. October 15th. Usually Franklin and I go to Mass, because it would have made her happy to see me going to church. I pray for her soul. Though, if I am honest, I cannot imagine God turning her away. Unlike me, she was good and faithful. Me … Well. People like me are only really fit for Hell.
I think … I am a little jealous of Pendragon. Growing up, he could get anyone he wanted. I never saw him go without a date or a partner on the dance floor. Or to take home. But I could never find the right partner. Now that he has the love of his life, I look at him and just wonder… why not me? Why do I not have that? It is difficult, because I do not want to talk to him about those feelings. Or even Franklin, if I am honest. Because Franklin is the same way, just with the molls. When we would go to the dance halls, the dames would swarm him, and he always gets his choice of partners. I do not think he has ever had a girl turn him down, Lee aside. Then again… I get the feeling you are the same way. Maybe something is broken in me.
Gabe nodded. “Yeah. What landed you in a hydra base here?” Out of the corner of his eye, he carefully watched his captain. After all, it was said Steve could smell a lie.
Steve made a face at Bucky’s back, just to be petulant, before folding the letter open. His eyes carefully scanned the lettering, which was bold and sharp. There was something about it that made him smile: the letters each felt like they were almost stumbling together, as though the man’s brain moved faster than his hand could keep up. Oh, sure, the writing was still pretty enough, but it wasn’t as stiff and practiced as Steve had been expecting. He felt his hopes rise just a little. “Says it took him a bit to write back because at first, he thought it was a prank or somethin’. But that my second letter made him realize it was genuine,” Steve reported. “Says he’s an engineer. Which means you’re probably right that he’s in the money.”
Smoothing down his hair as best he could, Steve went down to the street and walked far enough to catch the trolley. At Pacific Street, he then got aboard the subway, cramming as best he could against the wall to avoid the press of the midday crowd. A quick switch to the West End El, and in a (relatively) short time, he had arrived.
When the cab pulled up to the curb, Tony passed off an obscenely large bill before slipping out of the vehicle. Serena followed closely behind, but she stopped at the mouth of the alley. “If you go down there and around the corner to the left, you should see it.” The woman checked her phone for the time. “I’ll check on you in … fifteen minutes?”
“As long as that don’t include me, you can give up on social interaction all you want.” Throwing an arm around Steve’s shoulders, Bucky grinned impishly as the pair started up the street to where they were supposed to meet Arnie.
The mural had clearly been the victim of time. At one corner, all of the paint had flaked away, while in the bottom had traces of graffiti that someone had mostly cleaned off. But there was enough of the mural remaining that Tony could clearly make out the subject matter. It was an evening scene set in Central Park: a quiet lane stretching through the trees off into the distance. Standing in the middle of the pathway was a couple, both wrapped in heavy coats to protect them from the rain that could be seen streaking in the distance. To most, the pair would simply look like a man and woman embracing each other in the quiet of the evening. But Tony knew those figures - how Steve loved to render them. Especially in the size of the smaller figure’s hand as it rested on the taller man’s shoulder. What shook the brunet the most, though, was that Steve had painted them kissing in a way that was heartachingly tender.
The sight of the photo booth served to make Steve stop short. The Photomatic. It was an almost obscenely bright green on the outside and proudly declared “Your photo already framed - one minute” on the metal exterior. This was it, he thought. A photo that would capture him as he was - not through the eyes of anyone else.
His mornings were icy sheets and throbbing headaches; fragile desire and empty promises. After hurrying whoever he had brought home out the door, Tony would take a shower and crawl into whatever outfit was closest at hand. He would then stagger through his day, squinting at life from behind his sunglasses, until he rinsed and repeated the previous night’s events. Tony hated to admit it, but it was just … boring. That was without even going into how Jarvis felt about the behavior - the disapproval clear on his face every time Tony stumbled into the kitchen each morning, hair still dripping wet because he couldn’t bother to dry it.
Tony was halfway ready to say, ‘Yeah and my boyfriend is in 1940’s Brooklyn try harder.’ But, he wouldn’t. He hadn’t mentioned his boyfriend at all, and she’d demand answers he didn’t want to give. “And I had to send a drone to my artist to get him some decent medicine. He lives in assfuck nowhere. You have your life at least twice as together as mine, you can do it.”
“Sure I can,” the brunet declared. “What, you goin’ to come over here and try to beat me to take it, huh? I’d like to see you try.”
Reaching over, Bucky wrapped his hand around the nape of Steve’s neck and gave it a squeeze. “You’re welcome, punk. Though, maybe you could try to take better care of yourself, huh? Make me worry a little less?”
Arranging a date with a model was both harder and easier than Tony had imagined. Getting in touch with publicists and finally reaching the proper number so he could actually arrange it with the model herself was a whole other headache. The first model was named Hallie, and she was the Maxim May model. He had originally hoped the model Pepper knew, Pat, would be his first date; he had met her once, and she seemed nice enough. But, he made the mistake of asking for Pat’s schedule, and it looked hellish. He wasn’t even sure he’d be able to make a place in her schedule next year, let alone in time to keep Obie off his tail. Pat was apologetic about being unavailable, and she was kind enough to at least give Pepper the contact information for Hallie’s publicist.
And yes, I do have a favorite Grant. Have you seen Cary? He has the dreamiest eyes and a perfectly delicious voice. Nothing makes me swoon like that man can. If I ever met him, I would be an absolute catastrophe. I would make an absolute fool of myself just trying to tell him how much I admired his work. I cannot even think about meeting him without blush; it is ridiculous.
In the morning, Bucky grabbed the letter off the table before Steve had managed to wake up. He did not even hesitate to post it, not considering that the blond might have written it while drunk out of his mind.
And of course he was getting hard thinking about that. It was something about how Grant wrote about him. About how Grant imagined him. He would need to be blind to miss that the guy liked him.  Made him feel wanted.
“Oh, and oh good Friday had paused it. And yes I am. Do I wake you from the couch in the garage Tony?” Jarvis asked with a yawn.
Sunshine, if hitting Obie with a 2x4 solved my problem and wouldn’t be murder, I would have done it. Repeatedly. I also would have used a baseball bat too. Be real through about it.
And of course you manage to know people who have done wild experiments. I should have known you would have. But, see, now you actually have to follow up and ask them. Failure to report back will make your artist very pouty.
When they arrived at 7 Middagh Street, the trio stopped short. The building was an odd thing among its much blander brick brethren. While the others were brownstone, February flaunted its difference with white stone mixed in with the brick; fanciful wooden trimmings that looked as though they had escaped from the British countryside; and, a peaked roof that caused the building to stand tall among its fellows. Steve was absolutely charmed by it. Seeing his smile, Arnie laughed, “They only got it habitable a couple months ago. Renovated the place themselves.”
Honestly, you know I would have hit Obie with a piece of lumber if I could. I hope the meeting went alright. Any fun new innovations you and the company are working on?
“Thank you,” Tony answered both in regards to the toast and getting his watches back from the thief. Tony rested his head against the counter, riding out the wave of nausea. After a careful bit of breathing and some sips of water, Tony carefully nibbled at the toast. “Did you see if we had any mail this morning?” Tony asked casually, wondering if Jarvis had noticed the mailbox at all.
Tony lingered on the description of the token, recalling that they were something like a precursor to an engagement ring or kind of related to the concept. He didn’t think he’d ever reach the point of making that kind of promise to a person. Not with the shit luck he’s had in relationships. But here Tony was wondering what he would give to someone, supposing he could ever meet the right one face to face. Even more ridiculous, he was going so far as to work on cracking time travel for the try at meeting his artist in person.
The February House was a real place, and it felt fitting to include it in this story. After all, Steve being an artist is an important part of who he is; having a community is an important part of that. I (Nev) did my best to research February House and its occupants, but do note that these are fictitious representations of real people. Some liberties have been taken, in terms of personalities and the actions they take in this story. I do highly suggest reading up on the real people, though, as they are all so unique and interesting!
Explaining his choice of gifts in a letter form, though, proved to be a great deal more difficult. Steve hemmed and hawed over the words, struggling to capture the rush he had felt in those moments of inspiration. Ultimately, he erred on the side of brevity, trying his best to avoid looking like a fool.
You make me want to survive, though. Having friends like you and like Franklin and Pendragon… it keeps me anchored. Keeps me going a little better than I do on my own. I am grateful for that.
When Buck delivered the letter, he had to fight back a smile at the way the blond lit up like a firecracker at the sight. “He wrote me back?” Steve asked, all but flinging himself at his best friend to grab the letter.
I will be turning twenty-two in just over a month. Native to Brooklyn, born and bred. And my friends like to tell me I have more fight than any one body could contain.
You feel so real to me, Eddie. Sometimes I almost imagine I can hear your voice. And your letters offer me so much happiness. Even if I never meet you, I would not regret a bit having our names thrown together. I am so proud of the way you have been working on being a better man. You are hard-working and kind and thoughtful. Anyone would be lucky to know you. Just do not give up on yourself, hear me? The world needs men like you.
… And I can send the reference back for Ana and Jarvis, once I finish the sketch. I will take real good care of it until I can get it back to you. I am sorry I am not responding to the rest of your letter. I just… I cannot focus on it. My thoughts are all of you.
The 1940 film was almost eradicated by MGM, who tried to destroy all copies of the film so it could not compete with their release. But it did manage to be saved and you can view it on Amazon Prime!
Rolling his eyes, Bucky collapsed on the bed next to Steve and sprawled over as much of the surface as he could reach. “Dunno. Where would I be?” He playfully nuzzled Steve’s calf. “Not taking a certain punk to the hospital. He avoids it like the plague.”
Tony sent that letter and slid to the floor. He was a tiny bit proud of himself for finally just being clear about his feelings and their situation. Being the person to ask: what the hell are we? Clear communication skills being practiced; go him. Rhodey and Pep would be so proud.
Steve outright giggled at the drawing. In response, he sketched a quick comic of Jarvis having a cup of tea poured by a robot. The man looked utterly unphased, even though the robot had a precarious grip on the teapot. On a whim, he added Edward peeking around the doorway, a bright grin on his face.
Steve pouted. “Didn’t mean you had to drop it on me like that,” he complained. “Coulda broke me, and then where would we be, huh?”
The brunet sighed. “Can’t. Ain’t got a dame right now. Seems like all they want right now are army fellas. Think they’re real heroic or something.”
“What do you mean, Stevie?” Arnie slung an arm over Steve’s shoulders, drawing him close for a bit of a cuddle.
My father would probably have some stories like that, but I think that is partially what led him to the bottle. Probably some family curse I guess. I might jump down a bottle tonight to try to get some sleep. If you see any shoddy writing, feel free to burn the letter.  I don’t plan on any writing til I hear anything back from you.
And I am sorry if that is more than you want. I wanted to be honest, though, so you knew exactly where I stand.
I still haven’t heard anything about the doctor by the way. It’s taking a lot of things to keep me from going stir crazy. So thank you for the new hobby. I don’t know if he’s alive or dead. Still. He is an amazing researcher. I really enjoy how he does his papers. He has this great bleak sense of humour but still manages to be positive somehow?
At that, Steve simply deflated against the dark wood of the sill. “James,” he whined. “Gimme my letter.”
He unfurled the paper and stared at the painting in awe. It was beautiful. Personal, soft, and so lovingly rendered. There was something familiar about the son at the edge of his brain. They were a lovely family. Franklin’s family Tony presumed. And that menorah was stunning. Tony bit his lip a moment. This one needed a frame, because it was a painting and just lovely. Tony called Pepper as he measured the size “Pepp, happy new year, and how mad would you be if I took down the copy of the OSHA certificate I have at my place and hung up a gift I just got?”
“I guess so,” Bucky agreed. “It’s nice, though. Having artwork like that in a holy place. Muter always says that beautiful things remind us of the divine, and some of that fancy glass was mighty fine.”
“Your date seemed to think he was entitled to those,” Jarvis said as dry as the toast on the counter.
When Steve still hadn’t responded, Bucky frowned. “Stevie?” Going over to the glass door, Bucky gave it a good shove until it popped open. He sighed at what he found. Steve was still alive - thankfully - but he was also an absolute mess. The man was stripped down into his undershirt and his boxers, just sitting in the windowsill staring out at the very stimulating fire escape. His hair was matted with sweat to the point where it looked brown, and the strands clung to his forehead like they were trying to meld with his skin. While the undershirt had probably been white once upon a time, it was now a dingy tan color that Buck really didn’t want to think too hard about. And Steve’s skin. This meschugener looked like death itself: Clammy, pale, rail thin, and utterly miserable. “Should I tell my ma you did die just so she can come over here to beat some sense back into ya?”
“Yeah. Definitely. It needs somewhere safe. Somewhere it will be seen. I just need time to arrange it. And I don’t think the Carlyle does know. They’d either charge a lot more or be open more to let the people under 21 see the place like a restaurant or something,” Tony smiled as he moved to keep pace with Serena.
“Friday, baby you have got to have something new for me here, honey,” Tony asked desperately as he put the letter under the fume hood.
For Tony, it mostly showed in working on project Chronos every spare moment. He had nicknamed the time travel project that after having been inspired by watching the Salvador Dali and Disney collaboration, “Destino.” Which led to yet another way Tony’s love bubbled over into every corner of his life: The List. The short film just one of the many items kept on The List to show Steve when he made it to the future - something of a pop-culture catch-up. It even bled into building a friendship with Happy while talking about classic cars. He couldn’t help thinking of how Steve would be in awe over each vehicle, and maybe even how much he’d get along with Happy. And almost without realizing it, Tony would talk about wanting to take a friend to places like the national parks, art museums, and concerts.
The moment the man’s identity clicked, her mouth fell open. “Captain Steve Rogers?” She could see it, in the bird bone frailty of the blond and the fierceness of his eyes. “You have letters from Steve Rogers about his art…” Turning to Tony, she hesitated. “Maybe you could provide historians with edited versions? Or put together an art exhibit. Since you feel like people have forgotten he was an artist before he was ever a hero. Those are absolute treasures.”
As always, we do our best to research and keep this fic as correct as we can. But sometimes mistakes happen... and sometimes our beta process isn't the best. So if you find any errors, feel free to let us know! Or you can just scream in the comments to tell us about your feelings... we enjoy that a lot.
Did you at least give Pendragon a hug? Sounds like he deserves that. And Grant that sounds perfect. I wish there were more spaces like that for you. Would you believe I already am across the country from Obie? Work has us travel enough it’s a little hard to avoid him sometimes.
With wireless phones, people would make both great decisions and very stupid decisions with those phones. It’s people Grant; they will be people about it. But I would probably chat my head off to you. My problem is making it affordable. And finding a frequency that isn’t in use by radio. Maybe a different wavelength could work.
“I would go for it. I don’t know the actual name but you see the cute lighter haired one by the jukebox?” Tony pointed to Pendragon and his boyfriend by the jukebox. “That’s his friend that sculpts. They met in anatomy. I’ve been distracted or I would have more on him besides he’s  a ginger.”
I saw the piece you did for the cover, and Grant, Grant, Grant, that is fantastic. I love her hair. I like the movement and the colors are great. And that’s your art on a cover! I want to use it for wallpaper. It's so stunning.
“You really do need to eat. Sacrificing your safety isn’t going to make it better for anyone. It’s not me, but someone has got to have some kind of hunting or trapping skills. You have strength and skills that are just as useful, barter some for yourself too." Tony suggested.
Grant, I enjoy you calling Sunshine because I think that is one of the first positive things you remember being said about yourself. That your hair gets like sunshine during the summer, and that is just damn gorgeous. I am glad that it makes you so happy. And oh my god, you’re calling me honey. You are just going to miraculously kill me without laying a hand on me, aren’t you?
“Eh, wouldn’t want to escape it if I could. Ma always said that remembering where you were from was important.” He leaned out the doorway and
Why didn’t you tell me you were an artist too? The way you rendered that watch is one of the most beautiful things I think I have ever seen. Your eye for line and movement … I barely know what to say. You have made something so mundane into something beautiful. I hope you do not mind, but I have hung it on the wall next to my bed so I can see it first thing when I wake up in the morning. I have the feeling we could sit side-by-side for hours, just you designing and me sketching. I think I would enjoy that very much.
Tony bit back a yawn before pushing to his feet, teetering a little before he could start towards his projects. And then he saw it. Movement out of the corner of his eye. Turning his head, Tony stared in abject shock as the little flag on the mailbox completed its upward movement.
“Of course. Anytime.” Arnie quickly went about packing up his materials while Michael swept up the shavings from his whittling.
“If you should spread anybody’s name, it’s Arnie’s. He’s such an amazing sculptor, and people overlook him because he’s mated to another alpha.” Steve scowled down at the floor. “Me? My name seems like it’s everywhere.”
I think you would be an amazing father, Eddie. Honestly, you seem like you would put your child before the whole world – do everything you could for them. And the fact you know what was bad about your dad and your grandad… I dunno, sometimes just knowing what shape the danger takes can help you avoid it. So, no more creepy men who ply you with alcohol, and you should be golden, alright?
"You're welcome Ty," Tony answered, shifting back slightly.  He did not sign up for this. But well. At least he wasn't hiding it. Was the pill an upper or a downer? Tony wondered as he watched Ty continue to play tonsil hockey with the woman. He wasn't sober enough for this.
Is this easier? And yes I can try to read through the book slower. I go through books very quickly.  Be it textbooks, novels, legal documents. Damnit Grant you have dedication for deciphering my chicken scratch.  Thank you.
And took a moment to shut his eyes and look over it again. This had to be worth a hundred kisses via letter for Steve. At least that. Rhodes looked stunning, joyous. There was joy in every figure. Comfort. Like he and Steve had booked the diner for their friends. “This was the one he did first and he’d gotten references for some of the people in the mural from the guy. Some of them are his friends, some are the friends of the guy who’s getting his pie stolen. I really can’t give the letters up. The rest of the stuff in them is really personal.”
Tony watched the pair of them exchange numbers and Demi gave her a drive home while Tony sat in the cab alone. He wrote on the tablet on the way to the hotel since he didn’t feel quite ready to even attempt to spend the night in the Manhattan house. He didn’t put the date on any of the letters. He’d have to wait a while before he sent this. But it was the only way he would be able to explain not looking for Bucky right away. Why he wouldn’t look for scrappy Hurricane Rogers.
"And with this many people, it's a generation of people. Of Romani- of Jewish - of any people they described as other. Of people trying to recover," Tony shuddered.
I am real sorry that you are so worried about your safety, though. I cannot imagine living every day wondering if one of the people around me was going to try to poison me or something. Honestly, I would probably do more than jump out the window; I would move to the other side of the country. At least then I might have an excuse to avoid their parties. But you are a brave man for sticking it out. I do not know what keeps you there, but I do hope you stay safe. The world would be a sadder place without you in it.
They sat around on the posh furniture Jarvis had personally selected last year (replacing what had been damaged by the awful party Ty had thrown), and Tony felt ridiculously like royalty holding court. Rhodey and Pepper were settled together in the loveseat while Jarvis sat, legs neatly crossed, in one of the wingback chairs. Tony, meanwhile, had the entire sofa to himself, with his gifts spread out on the coffee table in front of him.
I still think I dreamed it - the injuries. I must have though, right? I’m a creative guy in my own right, Obie reminds me of that too. I might’ve watched something I shouldn’t have as a kid that gave me the idea. I don’t know. Obie knows me well; he’s been a part of my family's business for a long time. Functioned as an advisor and is one of the most senior members of staff. He might have been friends with my dad even.
On the bright side, he did not have to worry about how long things were going to take to get to Steve in terms of gifts. The chalk pastels he’d ordered for himself and Steve had arrived. Trying to capture Steve in colour led to some amusing debates of ‘Just how blue were Steve’s eyes?’ in some forums. And debates about just how correct was the colour in the Captain America posters. Tony had a few nights in between build projects where he went over the early letters and smiled. He would have to make up a cute nickname for Steve about his eyes.
After dinner, Steve headed back into his apartment with the package still wrapped. He carefully set it down on the table before putting away his shoes and jacket. Then, nearly vibrating with excitement, he peeled back the paper to find a book - a book unlike anything he had ever seen before. Inside were a series of photographs and instructions, each detailing different defensive and offensive moves. Steve poured over one of the first pages, which was written in an unfamiliar hand. It detailed how to turn mundane objects into weapons and how to think of exit strategies. He loved every single bit of it. Reading over the letter that went with it, the blond smiled to himself. Immediately, he began to work on a reply.
I uh. I could be happier in other parts of my life.  A person I spend time with, for all that they reassure me of interest and feelings, I find myself reserving myself.  I talk them through discoveries, and they tell me to calm down or it's not that big of a deal.  I have to argue for things that are for my own health and safety.  And I end up under the influence of things I keep saying I am avoiding.  And I am so frustrated by all of this.
"I know," Tony sighed, "I just worry because the only one with any sensible instinct is Pepper. Happy is hot-headed so it often clouds his judgments and Rhodey well he acts like he has good preservation skills but most of the trouble I got into as a kid was because of his ideas."
They were in the middle of a training session right now and Tony was giving him some snarky comments as he threw a punch at Steve who easily dodged it. Tony was swift and light on his feet and knew a bit about using his opponent’s weight against them. Too bad for Tony, Steve was well versed in combat and knew how to hold his own quite well from attacks. “That all ya got?” Steve provoked Tony who seemed to have taken the bait. Tony went for a low kick which Steve caught mid-air causing Tony to not only lose balance but unceremoniously to the ground. In quick movements, Steve caught the collar of Tony’s shirt and held him in place to keep him from hitting the ground too hard. If anyone had come they would find it quite odd to see a man and a harpy standing in such a way that looked almost comical.
“You took over my life you know,” Tony whispered as he sat on the bed not really trying to touch the other man, “I hated you but I always looked for you to save me. I wonder how my life would have been if never went under. That was such a selfish move. Anytime someone brings it up it makes Aunt Peggy sad. Ugh for one man you sure have a big impact on many people's lives. It's not fair.”
“You know Buck I wouldn’t intrude on you guys like that,” Steve shook his head as he began to run again.
“Uh, well, um, yeah, uh you're welcome I guess,” Rogers stammered and suddenly the person on the bed was no longer a hero or a legend just a man who was trying to make conversation with the first person he met. And Tony found that he wanted to talk more with him.
Steve knew that but he wasn’t so convinced he was okay with going out with some person his own company picked out for him.
. If Steve had known that the Erskine trials cost him his greatest love he would have never agreed to participate.
Once Steve ran out of coin to buy items with, Steve lead Tony towards the west exit where he had first entered from. It was easier to retrace his steps that way and find his way back to the team without having to do more recalculations in his mind. They walked in silence with Steve trailing ahead of Tony just by a little trying to make sure they were moving in the right direction. It did not take long for Steve to deem this a good place to release Tony from those shackles. The skin underneath looked like it was chaffed and inflamed. Seeing that made Steve’s blood boil. He really hated those men so much.
Steve spotted Tony laying down on the ground but looked nothing but annoyed and pouty. Tony was far from angry or scared and it just seeing that made Steve come to an instant halt in his movements. Thor stopped too realized the same thing Steve had. Tony looked okay for the most part and it seemed that he was more or less exasperated with what was happening to him but not...angry or hurt.
He drifted off looking at Tony’s face. The harpy just sat where he was pressed up against Steve blinking at him dumbly. It seemed to take awhile for his words to hit because a moment later Tony’s face turned beat red and he quickly bolted out the tent. Steve just sat there not knowing how to feel or what to do. This whole time Tony thought of him as his master. That Steve was just another one of those human men who would abuse him. He felt the anger and frustration at those who bought him and hurt him come boiling back. But he was also angry at himself for not seeing it sooner. That Tony had spent weeks silently doing what he was told, staying with him and the team, stubbornly staying in Steve’s tent thinking he had to because somehow Steve peeping in on him meant he wanted to force him to have sex with him.
Tony had seen the way the adults looked at him. Their eyes were filled with disgust and disappointment. His father had the worse of them all. His eyes help a cold hatred for Tony. It was a look he almost rarely saw but when he did, it meant a good lashing.
Steve blinked and saw Peggy-Agent Carter- had bent down to look at him trying to get his attention. Steve smiled shyly and laughed at her tease. He wanted to love her. Steve really did but he could not bring himself to take the next step. Like something was holding him back.
It did not take him long to realize that Tony was following him from a bit of a distance. It seemed that he wanted to follow Steve or he just had nowhere else to go Steve did not mind either way. Steve just wished Tony would walk with him not behind him. The harpy was free now he can do what he needed to heal and do what he wanted. Still Tony followed.
It was early morning when Tony finally stumbled into his room. His back was marred with new cuts and lashes from the earlier punishment. He spotted Jarvis standing at the foot of his bed holding up a warm soaked rag to help clean off his back. Looking down, Tony shuffled up to Jarvis and sat on the bed with his back facing the much older man.
“40 dolls would be good,” Dum Dum opened his palm waiting to be paid. Steve was about to argue that he knew that this was all worth a lot more than that but Dum Dum wound not have it. In the end, Steve was forced to reluctantly underpay his friend for the toolset.
He saw Agent Carter one more time as she climbed into the car. She locked eyes with him as it drove away and she smiled softly at him before turning away leaving Steve to stare at the back of her head. There was something familiar about her. Like he knew her well but he knew that he did not know her at all. He would remember a gal as pretty as her.
cage walls. A flare of anger burned in his chest as he stepped in front of the man stopping him in his tracks.
Steve could see the stiffness in Rhodey’s posture and he knew that the harpy was on edge since last night. He had a harsh frown painting his face which brought Steve and Tony back to the situation at hand. It felt like the small moment they were sharing was so long ago as the air grew serious and the subject grew dark.
After a few days of meetings that Tony was irked couldn't be switched to another week he was finally home. The letter was neatly sealed with some small sketches of trees he'd done in between meetings of what he could see from the windows. They still looked a bit too much like clouds. Pepper and Jarvis had sent pictures for him of the celebration for Rhodey's promotion. But it still wasn't the same. Tony couldn't shake the feeling Obie was trying to isolate him.
There you go, I’d fit in your place. And it sounds like something you’d want to change as far as your dressing goes - can’t have you looking too much like a grandpa. I am much more comfortable in the coveralls. But I don’t think I photograph that well in them. At least not professionally photograph; coveralls don’t work well in those kinds of pictures.
So, have the murals treated you kindly? I’m going to look for them the next time I’m out there. I also have lots of options for reading and we did talk movies. That said. Have you landed anything new for covers at all yet? Enquiring minds must know.
Favorites. Grant you are asking the hard questions. Cary Grant is amazing. Is he part of the reason you went with Grant for these exchanges?  Because I don’t blame you one bit. I’m a little partial sometimes to Buster Crabbe. But that’s simply because I sometimes wish he could pick me up. And lift me. I’d like to lift people, but only with permission since I know they’d sock me real good if I didn’t have permission to. Probably kick my teeth too.
You are in luck, though. It is finally getting warm enough that I could survive having Pendragon draw me. He is going to come over next week; we plan to have me laying out in my bed. Figure you might as well see me where I write most of my letters. I should be able to send it along with my reaction to the movie. Or, if I am feeling very generous, maybe sooner. But it might be more fun to make you wait. I am not sure yet.
Steve’s eyebrows arched at the four different drawings. “You’ve gotten a lot better since anatomy class.”
“Name specific people who will receive your things do not divide anything among your board. Talk to my lawyer and see if they can get you assistance with the corporate part of it,” Jarvis mused as Tony looked over multiverse theory.
“If you can, that would be a hell of a feat,” Tony replied like there was a joke in there. “Might just figure out a way to stick with you.” It was probably the safest bet, Tony figured if need be he could try something using the tesseract as a power source to get back home. Or at least the tesseract fuelled power cells.
… What if you get drafted, and the same thing happens to us? I know you say you are safe, because of the weapon design work you do. But, I trust the government about as far as I can spit, and I have chronic dry mouth. I could see them drafting you just to have greater control over you - making you do whatever they wanted you to. It is selfish of me, I know, to be so worried about the possibility of you being drafted when I should be focused on Pendragon. But losing you is one of the scariest things I can think of. I have even had nightmares about it. Of you dying, alone and terrified, in some battlefield somewhere. It is becoming harder and harder to sleep, because I know what is waiting for me when I close my eyes.
What if we were to see a movie at the end of this month? There’s a Hitchcock movie that is a little different coming out with Carole Lombard. And she is looking forward to it. It sounds like fun. A lot of fun. I think it’s called Mr. and Mrs. Smith. What do you say?
And we are in unfamiliar water for me too, sweetheart. I’ve never dated anyone by letter. But I think we are on the right track with the movies and taking the time to share things. And in a way, we do nothing but talk like this.
“You did more than a good job, Arnie.” Steve leaned easily into the hug, careful to not harm the drawings. “Guess now I owe you a favor, don’t I?”
How Roger lifts his wife so casually is one of the cutest things.  If I tried to lift you like that, you would probably fight me.
When he got home, the blond carefully hung the slicker over the tub so the water could drain off the fabric. He also leaned the umbrella in the tub after giving it a good shake on the landing. Sighing, Steve then looked down at his hands, which had not stopped shaking since the moment George had loomed over him in the hall. “You’re fine,” he growled at himself. “You’re home. Door’s locked. You’re fine.” His fingers continued to shake as he unbuttoned his shirt and dropped it into the laundry basket. Soon after his socks and slacks followed.
The first of some of the more letter heavy chapters. There might be a surprise a little later in the week.
I want you to take care of yourself, Grant. I don’t do great around the week my parents died. My nightmares act up really badly unless I drink. And well. It’s a lot of drinking those nights. And use the change for whatever you need okay? I can’t be there like I want to. But I can do this at least, right?
“Get someone to teach you perhaps. And I think once you learn, you’d be really good at it. You probably have better than average senses so you could make better shots or know sooner if you’ve caught anything depending on the trap.” Tony mused. “But I think you’d still need rations and all. But being able to supplement it would be helpful.”
“Thanks, if you need anything fixed I can figure it out,” Tony replied, stretching out a moment. He did manage to conk out quickly. Whether it was the distance or the fact he couldn’t smell much else but Steve was debatable. He really did smell that great.
“When his phone works. I write letters to be really sure. I just draft them on my phone,” He watched Demi get confused, flip to amused, then settle on a soft little smile.
I am not going anywhere.  Darling, you have to trust that. I know it's going to be hard to trust anything right now.  But I am doing my damndest to be okay. You have to put some faith in your friends too. They are skilled people who want to come home to you and their loved ones.  It's going to be hard.
“But we’ve got to help,” Steve whispered vehemently, fighting with his whole soul to keep his voice down. “The Allies need us!”
Tony almost wrote yours. He almost wrote yours at the end of a letter where Grant was just talking about someone coming onto him way too strongly.  And creepily.
“Friday, you mind annotating what I’m saying? Starting in five seconds. Document name draft one since I don’t want to write a letter twice right now.”
Tony nodded momentarily wishing he’d brought the wallet with him, patting at where the wallet would have sat. “Yeah, that should do it.” Tony strode with his back straight and momentarily rubbed his fingers together as he walked. He took a sniff ignoring the alley smell and tried to brace himself. He was going into this blind. Besides the fact it was in disrepair, he had no idea what he was going to see as he turned left and stared. “Oh, honey.”
Grant. I repeat, are you trying to kill me? Because, yeah, I can imagine that: you in my garage, draping your legs over a couch and sketching away. Also, Sweetheart, any of the nicknames you mention are perfect. I will also accept jerk and punk. I think I’ve referred to you both in my head and to some friends as my favorite vigilante, brat, honey, my artist, (Pepper has asked literally ‘How’s your artist doing’ and I’ve told her how you’ve been). Not sure how friend-like that sounds, but I really do like talking about you.
“Probably. The letters were super hidden in the Manhattan house and I was only looking at some of that stuff recently. How about we get that food going?” Tony smiled as the server thankfully approached them.
Steve flashed Bucky a wide, toothy smile. “Yeah. I bet you’re right. I’m hopin’ it gets easier to write once we know each other a little better. Right now it’s like… It’s like he’s a dream instead of someone real, y’know? Like, at any moment I’ll wake up and it’ll be like he was never even there.” He stared fondly down at the envelope in his hands, eyeing the way the letters danced across the page. “So I am just goin’ to enjoy every minute of it. Until I wake up.”
Waking up in the Garage on New Year's was different. Tony hadn’t attended any parties. He’d made all the Christmas ones that were before Christmas and just stayed in once those were over. That morning, he rolled off the couch and ran a hand through the nest of curls atop his head. After a cup of coffee, he began working on his to-do list that Pep had been hounding him to complete. By lunchtime, he had emailed over the designs he’d wanted done and the cellphone upgrades he was putting in place to Research and Development. He then dragged himself over to the mailbox. The blizzard was done according to Friday, and the newest letter sat in the spot Dum-E had been programmed to place it on. Tony gave the bot a fond pat and took the letter, and its accompanying painting, as he sat on the unofficial letter writing chair.
“You don’t know?” Tony chuckled, letting himself linger looking at Steve’s face. “Your eyes couldn’t be different. Your cheekbones couldn’t have changed, I like your nose. And I don’t think any science could change the shape of your mouth, though I guess they could have made your jaw bigger?” Tony raised an eyebrow in challenge. “I think you’d have caught my eye even a head shorter.”
After a moment Tony grabbed the new wallet, tracing his fingers over the patterns and opening it to look at the photos again. The simple shot that Tony was pretty sure followed the Booth instructions but was cute. And then the piece de resistance. His little stubborn jerk holding out the flowers and having the nerve to look bashful.
Tony combed his hair and mechanically went about putting on what counted for “decent clothes” for the club scene: a v-necked t-shirt, a blazer, and a snug pair of jeans. He moved through the evening as though he were performing the half-hearted steps of a dance that had become so common it had lost its shine. First, slipping into Ty’s car and staring out the window as they drove to the club. Then, breezing past the bouncer and straight up into the VIP lounge. And the night then fell into a blur of substances, high-pitched giggles, sloppy grinding, and too bright lights. But then came the worst part of the evening: taking Ty back to his place.
So that was part of his life now.  Still texting Patricia (Pat please), or Maxim March, had only led him to more questions than answers. How could one woman be so busy? And the strangest stories. He joked about Grant being a vigilante, but Pat. Pat made him wonder.
“Edward is a good name,” she mused. “I’m glad you have someone, chickadee. He better take care of you - you tell him that for me.”
If this is something that is going to take ages to fix one of the first things I am going to do after I kiss you is sink my teeth into your ear punk. And then probably kiss you again.
Was that him? Tony chuckled as he looked over at the sketch of the raven and nodded to himself. Yeah, it was. He was a proud little shit disturber that liked shiny things; that was him.
Tony felt the adrenaline slowly start to simmer down, the thoughts coming back down to a good baseline for him. He will be okay, he reminded himself. “Thank you, Jarvis,” Tony was finally able to say as Jarvis settled the fabric back in place.
And if a place serves that much latke and matzo ball soup, I am sure Franklin would be alright. After all, why serve that sort of thing if your primary audience cannot eat it? Maybe if you ever get back to New York, we can go to both places. Matzo for lunch and pizza for dinner. Seems like an even trade to me. Plus we could ditch Franklin when we went to dinner, and I could keep you all to myself for a little bit.
It is kind of funny, how you see yourself blending into my world. But we both know there would never be a place for me in yours. My sweet bird, you fly so high while all I can do is watch from the ground.
I don’t know about you but February is such a weird month. I would rather hibernate than go through it again. Glad it’s over.
Right now, I am sitting in bed and looking out the window of the tenement I live in. The view is not much, since I live in the back of the building. Franklin’s family is in the front half, as they need the space. Franklin’s mother and three sisters make their entire apartment feel overwhelming sometimes; they chatter up a storm from morning until night. I do not mind, though, as the sound of their voices makes me feel a little less alone. Franklin tries to visit as often as he can, but he and his father work as much as they can to make ends meet. I pull shifts when I can, though my health has been so frail lately… I get so frustrated with my body. It is hard to convince anyone to hire me; shifts mostly go to men who are much stronger than I am.
“Well as long as it would be of use, but just how do you think it would be of help to them in the alley,” Jarvis mused as he started rinsing off the dishes. Tony loaded the dishwasher in a slight daze and nodded at the reminder. Tony thought of the reminder now on his shoulder and still healing.
The answer ultimately came the next day. Sitting on his bed, back against the wall, Steve looked at the myriad of sketches strewn across the blanket. He had been trying to draw Arnie and Michael standing next to a jukebox, but nothing seemed to be coming together right. So, he had switched to trying to draw Rhodey, based on the photos Eddie had sent. But somehow, entirely without Steve’s noticing, the drawing became of the engineer instead. He had sighed before simply giving into the urge to draw Eddie in as many different ways he could think of. And by the end of the afternoon, he had more sketches of the man than he knew what to do with.
“George, that is quite enough,” Steve said, his voice pure iron. “I think you need to go to bed.” Without another word, the brunet turned and stormed off. Steve deflated once the man had stomped off down the stairs. He suddenly felt trapped inside the fine house; unsafe. The sound of another door opening down the hall made the blond almost jump clean out of his skin.
And then came the worst reveal of all. Paul was not who he said he was, but instead the vanished murderer returned to find the lost jewels. His wife had mistakenly uncovered his past, leading Paul to decide to destroy her credibility by destroying her mind. By the climax of the film, as the cops stopped Paul from attempting violence against his wife, Steve was nearly on his feet. He both loved and hated every moment of the film, but felt a grim sort of satisfaction to see the murderer clapped in irons.
“Tell him he can apologize by taking me out to dinner,” Bucky muttered, eyes starting to drift closed as he melted under the blond’s hand.
Tony did a quick sketch of Grant waking up from that nap. He drew the smaller man trying to stretch his back - tracing the slight bend in the spine that was no doubt the result of scoliosis. The brows were easy, since Tony had confirmation on just how full they were, and he did his best to match that beautiful mess of post-not-sex hair as much as he could.
The sight was breathtaking and Tony was so happy he was able to save papa Rhodes from being sent away to the Americas. Tony knew he would have never made it and that none of them would ever know his fate. Now that he was back with them those thoughts were no longer needed or wanted. Tony was a content knowing that his adoptive family were officially back together.
“You didn’t eve-” “what Happy is trying to say is thank you for taking care of Tony and saving him from the creature traders. We are very grateful and if there is anything we could ever do to repay you for the service you have done for the harpy kind please let us know,” Pepper cut in with a more cool response. Steve knew there was more she wanted to say but had stopped herself.
Steve walked into his apartment to find Tony wrapping his wings in bandages covered in the medicine that Bruce had made him. Bruce had told Steve, and Tony, that Tony’s wings only needed about a week more of wrapping for them to be safe and healed from the infection. It was good that Steve was able to get all the ingredients Bruce needed to save Tony’s wings. It would have been devastating to have to somehow convince Tony that his wings had to go.
“There is but I don’t have the ingredients for the remedy and if he doesn’t get it soon...well we are going to have to cut off his wings,” Bruce replied.
Tony smiled and pulled Steve’s hand into his intertwining their fingers giving a tight squeeze as his reply.
Tony stood up to retaliate having enough of this asshole talking to him in such a manner. Tony maybe an omega but that does not mean he is weak. He opened his mouth to say something when another voice cut in saying, “you dare raise your voice to a lord, sir?”
Then they left and Tony just stood at the edge of the forest and watched them go. Steve stood with him in silent support. Tony turned towards him with open tears and rushed to press up against Steve's side. Steve turned to pull Tony fully into his chest and cupped Tony's head in his hand letting Tony cry. The harpy showed a lot of emotion but rarely allowed himself to show such sorrow.
“Man you are thick,” Sam shook his head but did not elaborate on that instead he changed the subject entirely and began telling Steve how each of the Avengers was doing. Turns out each of them have been taking turns watching over Steve, and consequently Tony as well. No one had any major injuries except for a few scratches and bruises which was great to hear. And it seemed that Happy is almost done with his recovery and has been moved to the palace infirmary immediately once more of the dust settled down.
Pulling away, partially reluctant he had to say, Tony looked down to see wide blue eyes staring up at him. Tony could still feel the fingers intertwined in his hair and the change of breathing under his fingertips. The man was awake and staring at Tony in the most curious of ways before he pulled him close again as if trying to get a much better look at Tony’s face.
He looked at himself in the mirror that hung from the wall in front of him. There stood a man. Tall, well built and blonde, the same as his father. But his eyes belonged to his mother, the same shade blue like they were cut from the sky itself. He always starred at himself and thought only of how beautiful he looked. How strong he was. But at this moment he looked at himself with disgust. He saw a weak man who gave into temptations. Who just cared for himself when he claimed he cared for another. His lover had told him he loved him. Had asked him to be faithful to him. To not lay with another until they parted. He had agreed. And now being caught in the very act he vowed to the man…to the man that he loved…made him fill in rage at himself. How foolish he was for letting such a kind soul down. How selfish for breaking the innocence of such a naïve man. How sickening for stepping all over the man’s heart.
“Who is this prince you speak of Sir Happy so we may aid in locating him for you,” Thor asked and Steve was too lost in thought about this revelation. It seemed that the situation got ten times worse. Steve had heard of the wayward Harpy prince who ran away from home because he couldn’t take the responsibility of being king. At the time he had been angered about hearing about the story but now…now he knew better.
“What is the meaning of this?” Thor asked sounding just as confused as Steve felt. Weren’t they here to rescue Tony from the dangerous harpies?
“Stark? Are you related to Howard Stark by any chance?” Rogers asked Tony pulling him back to sitting position. Tony felt like a rag doll in this man’s hand.
Steve made it to the supply tent where Clint and Sam were putting the supplies away and on the cart. Clint smiled at Steve but dropped it when he saw the large scowl on his face. “Who spat in his coffee?” Clint whispered which Sam shrugged in return. Steve always loved how his teammates often forgot how sensitive his hearing was.
“Well I am definitely not letting you go all hero alone,” Clint pulled out his bow and gave it a good shake to bring it into use.
“So…,” Tony broke the silence as they entered the busy diner as if safe from either of them turning back and running, “do you wear my watch to every first date that you go on?”
The team, except Bruce who was still making the remedy, were standing around Tony’s tent in confusion. No one was talking or making a move they just stood there in silent support. Sam was the first to spot him and raised his eyebrow in question. Steve just shook his head as he pushed his way to the front of Tony’s tent. He shooed the rest away before turning his attention back on Tony who was behind the tent flap.
Steve realized at that moment that he really did not need to compete with Rhodey, Pepper or Happy for Tony’s attention or affection. The harpy gave it in folds and he was standing there ready to continue their little routine. He was glad that Tony was willing to train with him still. It helped recenter Steve and calm him.
There he was. Freaking out moving away from the doctors looking a bit crazed and angry. He stopped dead when he turned to move towards the door and saw him. They looked at it each other for what seemed like a long time. Everyone else seemed to seep away and it was only them. Steve looked into those eyes and he was so happy even if Tony's seemed filled with shock and an undertone of anger.
Pepper sat in the room with Tony as he got changed into the borrowed clothes. She kept a close eye to the streets making sure that nothing was going to jeopardize the mission. If anyone that knew them was out in the streets it could blow their cover. If a servant is seen wearing a lord’s clothes they either are sent to prison or to the Americas.
He married Steve. Steve married him. They got married and had a child. Tony couldn’t comprehend the facts sitting right in front of him. All the evidence that they share a life together. A part of him didn’t want to believe it and another really hoped this was true. His vision began to blur and the world began to spin. Tony’s world began to fall into darkness and the last thing he heard was Steve calling out his name…
When the fire began to dim and new wood had just been added, Steve felt a small press against his shoulder as someone came to sit down to his right. Steve turned expecting to see Bucky but instead there sat Tony with his wings wrapped in bandages that held the medicinal remedy to Tony’s infected wings. Steve just gaped for a minute and Tony began to fidget a bit. It wasn’t until Sam nudged him again that Steve smiled largely at Tony and welcoming him to the team circle.
The shackles on Tony’s hands, feet and neck had come off with little difficulty. Tony shuffled in place rubbing his wrists and testing out his new found freedom. The Harpy seemed to gain a bit of confidence as he moved around more freely. Steve could swear he almost saw a smile spread across Tony’s face but as fast as it was there it was gone.
“Star-Howard never had such kind big eyes,” Rogers replied and it was as if a dam broke loose inside of Tony and he began to cry.
Bruce climbed out of his tent and went straight for Tony’s without giving anyone else any face. That was fine with Steve as long as Bruce gave Tony the medicinal help he needed to save his wings. He watched as Bruce stood there whispering softly to Tony before climbing into the tent. A part of him was still jealous of Bruce’s ability to get along so well with Tony but Steve knew that he could still had a chance once he proved to Tony wholly that he is free to do what he wants. Steve just hoped Tony decided to stay even if there was a slim to no chance that was happening.
There was a story a mother would tell her children as they drifted off to sleep. She would sit on the bed in their small apartment and whisper it to her daughters like it was the most precious secret. The tale she wove was one told by her family for centuries. It was a tale of heroism in the most unlikely of places. A tale of an arrogant prince who died for his lover. The tale of a prince from a long-forgotten nation.
Steve enjoyed their session as it was the first time Tony began using his wings in combat. They were healed enough to play with now and it warmed Steve to see that. It would have broken Tony hard and Steve would have probably never met the person he is talking to today. Their almost nonexistent relationship would have fallen apart before he could even get it started.
Bruce hands Steve a list and with that Steve turns towards the weapons stash to grab his cloak, sword and trusty shield. He should take as little as possible. So he limited what he took to a small bag that had some snacks and his weapons. He did not need much since he had taken the potion to make him what he is. Steve could go with less sleep and food for a few days before he actually needed either of these things.
“Not my business,” the man tried to continue on but Tony stood frankly in front of him, “Move along omega whore.”
“All you got to do is ask sugar,” Tony winked at Bucky and Clint who chuckled in response. Steve watched Tony throw a few more comments and his teammates’ easy response.
Steve stepped out of the tent but before he let go of the flap he gave Tony one last reassuring smile. He knew Tony still felt like at any moment Steve would change his mind and Tony would be forced to go back to slavery but Steve would never let that happen. He shook his head and chased those thoughts away. They were on the move again and Steve needed to help get the camp packed for their journey. Maybe the next investment should be a carriage horse instead of forcing him and Thor to pull the supply cart around.
spent all his time when away from home trying to figure out how to wake him up. What would have happened if Rogers did wake up? Tony would never really know.
Anton was back this time standing in front of the window of the plane and said, “you’re coming home now Steffan. Hang in there. We will be together soon. I need you to do one last thing, Steffan.”
Steve heard Bucky smack his hand on his forehead before looking over to see Bucky’s head leaning into his open palm shaking his head, “you are such a dumbass! You do this to yourself. Go talk to him you big punk!”
It really was no longer his place to try and be Tony’s shoulder. Tony had Rhodey back. Steve was no longer really needed.
“Well I would say don’t do anything too strenuous but knowing who I’m talking to I know I would be wasting my breath,” Rhodey said as he placed a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. He gave Tony’s shoulder a right squeeze in reassurance before releasing Tony from his grip and stepped aside.
“Well you see, I overheard this conversation because you know as head of security,” Happy paused to tap a little signia on over his heart, “I have access to places so I thought I could get more information by following some higher-ups in Stane’s secret council. It was good that I did because I overheard Killian, you know the harpy that always yearned for the crown, and this other guy talks about some kind of potion that can enhance someone while also giving them control over them. Of course, they said they wouldn’t tell anyone who took it the other part of the truth of course. So I followed Killian around until he gave another harpy a briefcase which then got me following the harpy with the case all the way to the square where he gave a third harpy the potion. I went in to not only get a closer look but to confront the harpies only for the third to begin to glow orange and then the explosion happened.”
They left the wretched place as quickly as possible with Steve pulling Tony softly by the arm into the crowd of people. He kept a firm grip onTony but made sure he was not hurting him in any way. Steve just did not want to lose Tony and Tony somehow ends up in a worse situation than before because of his negligence.
“I understand we were young and you didn’t have the capabilities to challenge your father that way,” Steve answered, “and I would like to believe that if given the choice we could have figured out a way through it. But I want you to know that one of my biggest regrets was letting you walk away. For not fighting for what we had. Still, a part of me always wondered if somehow the circumstances change we would find a way back to each other.”
“Please, calm down,” Stane tried but the people roared more loudly and it looked like Stane was not taking it well. Steve noticed armed harpies making a semi-circle in front of Stane and Steve worried that they would harm the innocents who had come looking for council in their leader. Steve turned to look at Tony and knew he thought the same thing, those armed harpies were not going to have the chance to hurt anyone.
…until Steve was laughed at when stood in front of the army men. He never felt so humiliated in his life. The angry dark side grew like a peacock and frilled its feathers in triumph. It was telling him that it
“It's not like that,” Steve felt his face heat up and he knew Nat could see his blush, “I, he, fuck this, I don't have to explain anything to you Natasha.”
“Yeah what Thor said! The annoying talker grew on me like a weed and now I miss his little nonstop babbles he goes into in the middle of the night,” Sam pipes in and soon the rest were also giving their two cents on Tony. It seemed that Steve was not the only one who came to care deeply about the energetic and rambly harpy that joined them not too long ago. It was a wonderful sight for Steve but now was not the moment to dwell.
“Hey calm down. I was not try-” “yeah well stop trying,” Steve cut Natasha off and stormed away. He hated how most his friends could be and he really did not want or need their teasing antics towards him about Tony. It might cause another big misunderstanding that he really did not want. Better to cut their teasing short now than to let it continue.
Steve stopped dead in his tracks in shock never expecting to hear those words she just spoke to him. It took him only a second to change direction and head towards the center. Steve knew exactly where it was. He ran by it a lot wondering if this was the day and somehow it never occurred to him that it would actually happen.
The town of Manten was large in size and was close to being considered a city but had not reached there yet. Still, Steve could tell that most of the people who lived here were of high upbringing and knew a thing or two about what they were doing. It made it harder to negotiate but Steve knew how to bargain. It was one of the few things growing up poor in Brooks taught him. Manten’s marketplace was buzzing with life when Steve entered. It was located on the outskirts of town to make it easier for travellers to reach. Mantennites did not like having outsiders lingering longer than they needed to within their city. Steve maneuvered through the crowd of people trying to find what he was looking for but stopped in the middle when he heard a small cry that broke through the all noise bombarding his sensitive ears. He did not know what drew him to that noise or why his ears picked it out of the many that it parsed through but now that he could he could not bring himself to ignore it.
“Who put a lemon in your drink?” Clint asked Steve pulling him away from Tony and Bruce. Steve did not bother to really reply but sent Clint a glare. The man raised his hands in defeat letting Steve go back to his inner broodings but he found that he really was not in the mood to watch. Tony was free to befriend whoever he wanted but Steve really, really wanted it to be him. It was not like he was not trying to get the harpy to like him and open up to him but no matter what he did it seemed to have the complete opposite effect. And now seeing Bruce easily touching Tony without the Harpy freezing up bugged him more than it should. Steve should be glad he was getting along with his teammates!
“Thanks, Steve,” Tony said as he pulled on his gauntlets, “there are many ways to get to Stane but we are going to take the secret halls that lead to the throne room from behind the throne. It’s probably the best place to catch Stane off guard while also getting our hands on him fastest. There will be some trusted guards in those halls but they are not exactly fully trained to go up against fighters like the Avengers so hit quick and hard and move on. Do you guys understand?”
“Ah, yes. I am Anita Marson,” the woman introduced, “as I remember correctly, you signed up for the reanimation program. Do you remember?”
Steve turned back to the fire watching it dance around. He tried hard to concentrate on anything else but he really just wanted to know how Tony was doing and if he could fully recover. It would be a wonderful sight to see Tony’s full wings even if he never got to see them.
“It’s his wings. Tony is getting better, his body is healing, he’s gaining some fat and much needed muscles but his wings are not healing properly. They look much better than when I first examined them but I noticed that they are infected,” Bruce explained.
“Friend Steve,” Thor smiled stepping up into Steve’s space and placed a strong hand on his shoulder, “worry not we shall make sure you come out of this unharmed.”
“Haha very funny,” Steve rolled his eyes, “no it’s just...my company’s throwing this raffle for a mystery date for Valentine’s Day and I guess a part of me is more interested in it than I thought.”
“It’s our decision to make,” Clint added in helpfully, “let us make that. Plus, we have gone on dangerous missions before and to save a whole people from tyranny? That would be great for our reputation!”
“H-hey! What are you doing?” Tony squirmed, not knowing if he was more mortified by where Steve’s hands were freely exploring or how much he
“Thank you,” a voice croaked at him and although it was harsh from disuse Steve found it soft and gentle. He turned around so quickly to stare at Tony who looked at him ready to cry, “Thank you. You...this means a lot.”
“Nice going Stark,” Tony rolled his eyes laying down on the cold cement floor and staring up into the night sky. There weren’t even stars in the sky to keep him company. Just himself and his thoughts. Figured what he tried to run from had found a way to follow him anyway.
“Well let’s hope that this lucky streak continues,” Bucky chuckled, “it would have sucked to drag you on my date night with Nat to be your wingmen while also trying to be romantic.”
Tony turned to look at her in pure shock. It had been five hundred years. Tony had been dead for five hundred years. Everyone he ever knew was gone. They decided to wake him up anyways.
Steve looked straight into Bruce’s eyes wondering what was wrong. A sickening feeling churned inside him as he waited for Bruce to continue. It was as if time slowed down and the air began to thicken. He really needed Tony to be okay. He was obsessed with the harpy but most of all Tony deserved to have a comfortable time and gain strength to leave and go where he wishes to go.
“They have my contact information…” Steve whispered, “let me know when-if you want to see me again. I know I am not who you wanted to see but it’s easier to deal with things when you have a familiar face around. I will be uh, sitting in the quad for a bit.”
Steve really truly needed to get to Tony right now. He could probably make that distance pretty swiftly if he took only himself and his shield. It was important that he got to Tony quickly before he got hurt or worse killed.
“Nothing in particular,” Steve shrugged before asking Tony the same question. The harpy looked like he contemplated the answer and started telling Steve about some ideas he had for an upgrade to some of their teammates’ armors and weapons. It seemed important to Tony that each of them had good working equipment at all times. None of them had to fear of a malfunction because Tony made sure it worked as intended. The harpy surely was a genius in his own right.
Tony had successfully saved papa Rhodes. He could not wait until they were home and the Rhodes family was reunited once again.
“I…that is not what I meant!” the girl tried to deflect but it only added fuel to Steve’s fire of anger. He was about to retort when a strong hand came to his shoulder and squeezed hard effectively shutting him up. Once he heard Bucky start diffusing the situation he zoned out.
The mechanic booths were located towards the left center of the market plaza where a lot of the heavy-duty forges had been built. Steve remembered his Pa took him here when he broke something that needed repairing. Most of the smithies and mechanics were kind and fixed things for much less than they should charge because most people could not afford it anywhere else. He hoped the same men were still there and were willing to help Steve buy a good toolset for a traveling mechanic for a fair price.
Tony, huh? That was a good name. Steve spoke it aloud to test it out and saw the har-Tony shift a bit at hearing his name. He smiled at Tony as he bent down as slow as possible hoping not to scare him anymore than he probably already has. “Hello Tony,” Steve began letting the name roll off his tongue, “my name is Steve. I look forward to getting to know you better.” Tony just looked at him silently and  backed further into the cage as Steve reached in to help him out. It made Steve a little sad to see such a beautiful person be so scared and mistrusting. It was well deserved, Steve bet, but he hoped he can work on getting Tony to like him while offering a place for him to from his wounds and traumas.
