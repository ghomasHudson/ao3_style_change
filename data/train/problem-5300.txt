“Seems like we have something else in common now…” replies the other, looking down but not hiding a small smile from his lips.
That is, admittedly, a good save, and when he looks at him, Tony can’t help but recognizing a certain urgency and (maybe) desperation into his friend’s eyes. Which is why, after throwing a quick glance at the clock on his desk, he decides that perhaps a distraction is just what he needs to help him figure out the tiny detail that has been escaping his calculations for the whole afternoon.
Sitting in front of each other at the restaurant some time later, Tony is making casual conversation, trying to get Steve to give something more substantial than simple, short answers, when the maître approaches their table, the wine list into her hands. Before Tony can stop him, Steve quickly stretches his hand to get it, prompting yet another sigh from the man in front of him, who shakes his head and waits just until the maître leaves to scold him.
So that’s why he didn’t know about it. Feeling somewhat relieved, Tony’s brain fires up a couple of moments later as realizing that this will give him a perfect opportunity to have a face to face with Fury (and hopefully Steve too). He just needs to get the message along.
What follows is, to put it mildly, the weirdest and most nonsensical recap that Steve has ever witnessed. It starts relatively normal – something about a robbery, although according to the slide only one thing was removed from the premises, a little container which resembles more a treasure chest than an ordinary box – but once they get to the fourth slide, things take a turn for the illogical pretty quickly.  Steve barely has the time to process a bit of information that a new, more puzzling one gets deposited on him. He can’t even venture a look around the table to spot the others’ reaction for fear he’s going to miss out on something.
. He yawns again, weirdly feeling the urge to hide his face away while doing it, and spins on the chair, giving the other his back. He’s tired and should really make it upstairs to sleep in a proper bed, but the thought of leaving the chair and actually standing up is even more exhausting.
“Tony, we need to talk.” Pepper sighs out of the blue one evening after dinner, and those five words are enough for him to start getting frustrated. He doesn’t understand why they keep being blurted out to him over and over, why nobody gets that what he needs is fucking
Before Steve can ask him again – which undoubtedly it’s what was going to happen – he pulls his shirt again and kisses him gently, closing his eyes and breathing in his smell. He’s not a fan of reviving the recent past – too many painful memories, too many ghosts – but with everything that has been happening to him in the last year or so he’s made a promise to himself to not let a single moment go, no matter how small or insignificant it might appear in the present. When Steve kisses him back this time, he gently slips his tongue inside the other’s mouth, caressing it softly, which makes Tony quivering again with pleasure. He’s about to suggest they move somewhere else when a new voice calls out his name.
That does the trick, because Tony finally opens his eyes with what seems to be a huge effort, blinking a couple of times as taking the room in before focusing on the two arms around his body.
Tony giggles softly and then jumps up on his feet, starting to dance to the rhythm, looking at Steve as inviting to join him; but of course he shakes his head, chuckling nevertheless.
, he wonders to himself, passing a hand over his face to keep himself from saying it out loud, knowing that he’s not ready to risk it, not yet, although it’s been six months now, which is the minimum recommended to wait before going back. He didn’t even want to do this initially, he felt it would be inopportune, wrong, and could be interpreted the wrong way. Not by Steve, of course not, but he couldn’t be sure he wouldn’t tell anyone, even if just to seek some comfort, some reassurance that he wasn’t going completely insane after all. But then as the date approached, he started to feel like he
Nobody can say that he didn’t try, of this he’s sure. It had been relatively easy for the first couple of days: reading files (plus a book) and watching documentaries he had been meaning to for ages, letting Clint teaching him how to play computer games and hanging out with Natasha while she was busy cracking a code. Then he got progressively more restless, monotony setting in along with the feeling of being useless every time that damn alarm goes off, all because of Tony and his fixations. As a matter of fact, Steve had grown convinced that the other was purposely avoiding his company, for reasons completely unknown to him. But today his personal mission is to find the guy and have a straight conversation with him, no matter how hard or awkward that can be. Because today marks two weeks since he’s been back home, he’s feeling well, and, quite frankly, he’s had enough. He wants his shield back (and access to the gym again).
. It’s like he’s discovering a whole new side of him, after all these years. It’s surprising and nice.
suit?” Tony asks, his tone suddenly curt, and his eye catches Steve’s frown, and maybe surprise. It has the same effect on Tony himself in a way, although it’s no wonder he feels
“Never thought… I’d see you cry, Shellhead” he whispers, and Tony wants so desperately to laugh it off and tease him and act
The voice breaks the utter silence he had immersed himself into, and it’s so sudden and unexpected that startles him. He almost drops the pot he’s holding, has to catch it midair.
But Tony doesn’t have time for this, definitely not now. He’s already on his feet, and on his way to the door.
Steve’s voice interrupts the flow of his thoughts for a moment. His hand is firm and steady on Tony’s shoulder, and although if he really wanted to Tony could get free, it’s enough to keep him in place.
After a few more seconds of stillness, both Carol and Jessica follow Tony’s example, and even Steve, having tried a few times unsuccessfully, eventually manages to bring a roll to his lips, and the tiny squeak of joy that he emits doesn’t go unnoticed to the man sitting next to him, who can’t keep a smile hidden away.
so he closes his eyes as he starts pounding inside the stranger’s body, and soon Mark’s moans begin to echo inside the room, covering his own grunts, telling just how
“Okay, I’ll go first then.” Tony sighs, defeated, taking a sip from his virgin Mary, “I’ve always liked engineering more than anything else because I felt I could control the outcome in the middle of life’s chaos, even as a kid. That’s why when things don’t make any sense – and in our line of work they often don’t – I go down to my lab and tinker.”
“A-Ant— Anthon—hony…” he replies, putting all of the energy he’s got left into that word, because once he’s spilled it out consciousness slips away from him.
Okay, now he’s confused. “This way,” Steve adds, replying to the silent question and preceding him to his bedroom.
that could stop whatever law rules this alien world from making him spill his guts out. But it doesn’t take a genius to know that he’s fighting a lost cause.
Holding a sigh in, he takes a step forward as his turn to be sworn in is up, and for a split second, when he lies his hand upon the Constitution, is tempted to throw the whole stupid plan away and tell people what is actually
At 7:15pm of the following day, Tony makes his way to the rooftop of the restaurant, feeling like an idiot and starting to wonder whether this was indeed a good idea. He seriously had to fight the impulse of wearing a traditional suit (the easy and less problematic choice but, of course, he’s pretty sure that would have embarrassed Steve beyond measure) so, after almost an hour of trying, he finally settled for a more practical look with black chinos and a white shirt without a tie (another difficult decision), the first two buttons undone just to reiterate the casual vibe he’s going for. Still, these fifteen minutes of waiting around are proving to be a real headscratcher: he keeps looking down at his clothes, feeling weird and out of place, wishing he had indeed opted for the suit because it’s what makes him comfortable, what he is used to whenever is in public, or dining out. Appearances, right? They are important, don’t believe what hippies say. If you
that even though he’d like to launch into a detailed explanation as to why he would never do such a thing, he’s so mesmerized at just the
Steve nods, although his face tells that he’s not entirely sure he can keep his promise; nevertheless, after a few more seconds in which he reminds himself of what exactly he was saying, he begins talking again, and for a short while he seems to have found his pace. That is, until Tony decides to step up the game and nonchalantly starts rubbing his thumb against the back of the other’s hand. With what seems to be an enormous effort, Steve forces himself to not stop at this, although it’s clear just how
“I don’t want to… waste time…” he mumbles, and the moment after a long yawn interrupts his words. “I’m gonna take a piss.”
. Take all of your knowledge of gender stereotypes and throw it away, okay? I’m serious. The gender of the person in front of you doesn’t matter, you just can’t act like you’re the only one who can make decisions. You already have… a really defined body that give off that vibe, you don’t need your actions to match it too. You get what I mean?”
be found his level of paranoia is skyrocketing to the stars. When he eventually arrives to Steve’s farm – how stupid that sounds into his head – he takes a good look around and waits about five minutes before stepping outside the vehicle and quickly reaching the front door.
“Gotta say, I was surprised when Stark told us about this, I mean… No offense, Tony, but you’re about the last person on earth I would go asking for
“I’m sor—“ he starts, mostly to not let the silence between them grow out of control, but before he can complete his sentence the other stops him, quite abruptly, a low sigh escaping his imposed self-control.
“Buck…” he starts to say, but two different hands close around each of his biceps, almost carrying him inside the club.
“I have no recollection of this, Stark. Plus, T’Challa told me that you said in the meeting earlier you drank too much last night, so for all I know, you could be making this up, maybe to get me to forgive you or god knows what/ Hell, wouldn’t be the first time, would it?”
It takes him a while to have enough energy to stand up, but eventually they get moving, and Tony notices with a bit of relief that as they shuffle along his feet gain more confidence. They haven’t got a plan
“You didn’t really believe I would back down so easily, did you? Don’t worry, your baby is safe and sound. Just a couple of scratches, but once I finish with this new coating paint I’ve been developing, it’ll be good as new. As I said, you’ll get it back once I’m sure it’s safe for you to be active again.”
“Relax, Cap, it’s all good. Let’s go finish this, c’mon,” he winks at him, patting softly his bicep before answering, loud enough for the rest to hear: “Coming!”
As surprise and awe run through their veins, they see the automaton taking a tentative hand to its opposite arm to push a button there. A second later, cracking and screeching, the front of the armor opens up to reveal something none of them had ever even considered.
It makes perfect sense, of course it does. We’re talking about Pepper, after all, one of the most logical persons he knows. And still, he can’t help but feeling somewhat taken aback by this news.
he tries he just can’t stop them. He lets himself on the bed, staring up to the ceiling and staying still for the longest time before sleep eventually catches up to him.
“Not at all, I’ve been up for a couple of hours already.” he lies, grabbing his sPad to order a triple shot caramel macchiato from the coffee shop nearby. “How are you, John?”
Steve giggles softly, already on the balcony, a leg over the barrier, the rest of his body still close to the other’s; Tony lifts up his chin to steal a last kiss from his lips, and then, taking a deep breath and looking into his eyes, he whispers softly: “This is possibly the most selfish thing I could ever say right now, but… I love you, Steve.”
know? But we’ve studied the odds, this is the best way we can make sure the United States don’t completely collapse in the next ten years or so. You have to trust me, I have my sources.”

, which is why I needed to stay away from you and the Avengers and pretty much everything for a while. But in my mind, there has never been a single doubt revolving
He’s asleep in his old/new room at the Avengers Tower and although his rest is everything but peaceful, the stress and tiredness of the last battle are enough to keep him knocked out during the visit, which last only a couple of minutes, no more. Tony enters the room as if he was tiptoeing, as if he was afraid to make a sound, and goes sitting on the edge of his bed, not daring to touch his body, but studying it from his feet upwards, trying to absorb every tiny detail, to get a reading on the other’s physical condition, not having access to his psychological one. Although with Steve is always hard to tell – blame it on the super soldier serum – Tony knows him all too well to get fooled by the appearances: the gym trousers and shirt he uses for pajama are looser than normal around his body, his muscles less bulgy, his skin has more cuts and scratches than usual and his face looks so tired even though he’s well asleep.
“Cut the bullshit, Rogers. I’m counting to three. If you don’t say those words in your mind out loud, I’m leaving. And I’m not kidding.” Or is he?

And to you, because you deserve a good person next to you, someone who can give you their undivided attention, who’s always there for you no matter what. Let’s face it, I’m not that person, and you deserve
but then he would have given in and kiss Tony back, because even though he claimed he wasn’t superstitious, that was their go-to ritual before any battle and it didn’t “feel right to tempt fate like that”.
he is – and Steve has no idea why he carries on doing this to the man. He could easily trick himself into thinking it’s to keep him safe, but he knows too well that’s not the case. So then, why does he? It’s not even that he doesn’t trust him –
Tony is stumped, doesn’t know exactly what to say or do, although he has a very precise idea about what he would
“What does it matter, Tony? Her signature is on my chart so I guess she’s the one in charge. Anyway, she said I could go whenever I wanted to, as all levels are getting back to normal and I’m making a speedy recovery.”
Tony nods as he stands up, all of the sudden feeling a mad need to get out of there. He doesn’t quite know how to explain it – for sure it has something to do with the claustrophobic room, although that’s not all of it – but he can tell his heart is beating slightly faster and his throat is tight as a knot, all signs that if he doesn’t breathe some fresh air as soon as possible he’s bound to have a panic attack.
. All of a sudden everything makes sense, and he doesn’t even need to turn his head to confirm the identity of that voice, because he
happened, because I have no clue. All I know is… I needed to do this. To see you. I’m sorry if it’s painful.”
He lets himself on the sofa and sighs deeply, throwing his head back and passing a hand over his face; he should be surprised that Rhodey doesn’t know, but at this point nothing really shocks him, especially not with Fury and the extraordinary level his paranoia has reached. Nevertheless, he knows too well that keeping this from the
“… I can’t. Don’t you think I want to? I just can’t. Everywhere I go, everything I do, all I see is your face, all I hear is your voice. I wish I could just snap out of it, but I can’t. Not right now, anyway.”
“That explosion, it shattered all of the Stones. And in order for you to ‘get out’, someone must employ the Soul Stone once again. Hence, if its pieces are scattered…”
, it hurt too much the first time…” Tony spells out the hard truth, swallowing and closing his eyes, hoping that will be enough for his head to start working again,
“Do you know the story behind the mistletoe, Tony?” the other replies, plainly ignoring him, “I didn’t, until I had this… very interesting conversation with Thor a few days ago. You’d never guess, it actually comes from his family. I won’t spoil it for you – you’ll
“Well then…” Steve looks at him again, a slightly different light in his eyes now as he kisses him again, leaving his sentence hanging while his hand leaves Tony’s face to gradually make it all the way down to his belly, lingering on it for a brief moment before slipping gently into his boxers, starting to caress him with soft and measured touches. He swallows, caught somewhat unprepared, and then lets a surprised, little moan escape his lips when he feels the other’s hand
“Do you… think he’ll act differently now?” Steve eventually asks him, turning in his direction, but before Tony can answer he spots his glasses and blinks, adding: “You wear glasses now?”
Although the secretary’s voice sounds distant, it gets to his brain anyway, pulling him away from his own spiraling thoughts; he smiles and thanks her, then stands up, unclenches his jaw and heads inside the office. Tony didn’t have the time – nor, to be frank, any interest or will – to google the man standing in front of him now, perfectly aware that the more he knew about what kind of person he is, the less able to put on a façade he would be – especially here in Washington. The one adjective that now pops up into his mind to describe this guy would be average – height, skin color, eye color, hairdo, body type: try to conjure up every and each of these characteristics personified in the figure of a random, standard politician into your mind and this would be the result. John Grey – even his name is so bland and
He doesn’t see Steve again until half a day later, when they show up for the meeting they had scheduled with Fury – and even when they’re in the same room, he actively avoids looking anywhere even remotely
Being still unaware of what is actually wrong with him, besides the broken arm, Steve decides to answer the question by looking to the plus side: “Better than earlier.”
“Great…” he mutters, yawning and looking around even if there’s nothing really to look at. “I gather this is all recent?”
This doesn’t make any sense, and if it wasn’t for the dead-ass serious look on the other’s face and his hardened eyes, Tony would think he was trying to fool him. So although deep down he
…” he moans as Steve catches up with him, leaning both hands on top of Tony’s shoulders in a gesture that has kind of become his signature move after Tony told him that the other’s hands always make him feel
“Tell me the truth, how are you doing?” Steve whispers into his ear after a bit, leaving a kiss on his cheek that sends shivers down Tony’s spine.
. It might be short of a miracle – I certainly can’t explain it – but you’re perfectly fine, despite all that time down that cave. No long-lasting effects. Your body temperature should regulate itself within the next twenty-four hours, and after that it will only be a matter of physical rehabilitation. Getting your muscles to move again. Considering your age and health, I’d expect you to get back on your feet within a matter of weeks.”
The voice that suddenly resonates in the room – following the echo of the door being shut with a bit too eagerness – sounds kind of familiar, but there’s a depth and strength to it which are completely new, so much Tony believes his first impression was wrong, he doesn’t actually know it
Steve looks at him, staying silent for a couple of seconds as trying to figure out how to pull the invisible plug that seems to be feeding the man on his right, and it’s quite ironic to see how their roles seem to be reversed now.
He shakes his head, shakes those thoughts out of his mind, he really doesn’t need them right now, not if he wants to get through… well, not today, but even just the next two hours, until his appointment is scheduled. Planning for more than a short amount of time is not a luxury he has anymore, his brain just won’t allow it. Blame it on the love of your life dying in your arms in freaking space. He really doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to get over that, especially because his thoughts always seem to circle back to
Steve blinks, definitely not expecting to hear these words right now, and turns to look at him, his face concerned and serious as his voice is when he replies: “Is there something wrong you’re not telling me, Tony? Are we… going to war?”
“Wait, are you… going?” the other asks him, quite surprised, standing up as well but forcing himself to stay put; Tony notices how his body seems to be gravitating towards his own, and the thought alone is enough to make him shiver with anticipation.
need to know: what was the secret mission about?” he asks once they’re sitting comfortably on their respective beach chairs, a big umbrella providing them with much needed relief and shadow from the boiling sun.
“I’m sorry, I don’t… The only thing I know is that he’s on a really secret mission somewhere, but other than that…” the other eventually says, his voice slightly lower as if he was whispering a secret. “I’m sure he’s fine though” he then adds, and Tony can tell it is just wishful thinking, but he’s glad to hear it anyway.
“Steve? Tony? Can you hear me? The explosion threw us apart but Bruce, Hank and I are all fine. What about you guys?”
, unusual as it is, but because he can’t quite believe his own eyes. A woman soldier. And his new friend doesn’t seem to find it weird in the slightest. He hasn’t even

he shakes his head, telling himself he’s an idiot while stretching backwards to grab them from the furniture. These were the very first thing that had popped into his mind when they were on their way back to Earth, and again while he was on the flight from L.A. just a few hours before, but once he had stepped inside the compound they had seemed to vanish from his thoughts. He looks at them now, and a part of him wants to set fire to them without re-reading whatever he had written, because he’s never been a fan of the past and he’s not about to start now. But then a tiny voice inside of him tells him
it is,” Steve echoes, hand leaving Tony’s now that the fidgeting is over to find its place back on the other’s shoulder. “How long do you think it’ll take to get the exact location?”
now, and although it’s nothing unbearable, the gesture alone is enough to enrage Tony more than he frankly has the right to.
They’ve arrived to the garage now, and Tony hurries to a wall in the far end, types in a numerical code and waits as the shutter rolls up, revealing a storage room. He puts the boxes on the ground, slightly out of breath, and double taps his reactor again so that the suit can retire back into it. He dries up the bit of sweat from his forehead and sighs deeply, thinking that at least he’s done everything he needed to do without that highly feared encounter.
Tony sighs dejectedly, passing a hand over his face mainly to interrupt the eye contact, and then tosses out a jumpy laugh: “I don’t know, I… I’m not used to this kind of thing either, people don’t usually…
He doesn’t know what to reply. For once in his life, he can’t find anything worth saying, not after what the other has just told him anyway. For a couple of interminable seconds, all he manages to do is staring into those navy eyes, trying desperately to believe them. But as it turns out, he doesn’t
“You can’t… know that for sure…” Steve replies, smiling softly nevertheless. Tony’s heart skips a beat.
. Just… not now, okay? I can’t formulate a simple coherent thought as it is, let alone having some sort of… philosophical discussion with you about life, love and death.”
After a few minutes, he feels Steve’s hand on his shoulder, its firm but delicate grip has become so
. The elections are only a few months away and frankly, it’s not looking very good. People are scared, they’re bound to make

If he had known what would happen after that night, he wouldn’t have showered, to hold on to Tony’s odor a little longer, even if it’d soon be vanished because of all the sweat and blood that his body would leak out within twenty-four hours. In hindsight, he’s come to realize how
Tony recognizes the puzzlement in the other’s eyes before he even speaks, and can’t help but smiling at that.
“And here I was, thinking I’d be the recipient of that very sentence tonight...” Tony can’t help himself from saying, sighing softly and looking down, a fake, overdone, distraught expression on his face.
His head literally buried deep down the hollow cavity of the suit he’s been trying to repair for the last couple of hours or so, every bit of his attention devoted to it, Tony doesn’t hear Steve as he makes his way into his lab, although it takes him only a few seconds to notice the intrusion and knowing at once it’s him, even before the super soldier can open his mouth.
There it is, the question he has been thinking about nonstop for the past few hours. He knows what his ideal solution would be (“Fancy a holiday, Steve? I’d visit during weekends!”), but alas, that’s not even worth bringing up, he already knows what the reply would be. So he goes for the third down his list, the more practical and – in certain aspects – legal.
“Hello, Stark. Long time no see.” Nick’s replies, his voice sounding as angry as usual, even if it’s not. At least, Tony doesn’t think he is. He scrambles to hide away the suit’s schematics even if he’s pretty sure Fury has already noticed them.

, but as he holds Steve’s self-portrait in his hands, he can’t deny that his heart is strongly disagreeing right now, because this guy is surely something else.
“Yeah, I… I’m fine…” he nods, stretching a hand up to caress Steve’s cheek before kissing him gently, smiling more convincingly on his lips: “Still can’t believe we’re married now…”
“What the fuck, Nick? You left me on my own without even a warning! How can you possibly think this is a good way to handle this fucking situation?”
“Do you think it could work?” Fury asks him when he’s done, and as much as he would rather not to admit it, he nods.
“Hold on, let me check my calendar…” he says, opening the Twitter account of the bakery around the corner to see if their bagels are out of the oven yet. It had been Thor’s discovery years ago, although they had never managed to get out of him just exactly

“Hey, Tony… Why do you keep calling me by my first name?” Steve asks after a while, the tiniest smirk on his lips as he turns to look at his companion.
, stays quiet and follows him for the time being, speaking only once they’ve inside, about to take the stairs.
“You too?” Tony asks, not expecting such a response from him. It somehow feels odd, out of place. He lifts up his eyes on him, to see if he’s heard it right.
taught me it’s a very effective way to end a speech – when I remembered this one from Shakespeare,” he swallows, and closes his eyes as reciting it by heart: “When he shall die take him and cut him out into stars and he shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.” His cheeks wet and cracked, he has to suppress a new spasm of tears and pain from coming out, so he forces himself to open his eyes, looking at Tony’s picture again as asking for the strength to give yet another in memoriam. “I think that’s perfect for you, my love. I know you’re up there so… look after me, will you? You’re the only one who knows how much I need it. And just how much I miss you. I love you, Tony.”
Tony frowns, now visibly puzzled, because how can Fury possibly know about that? It hasn’t been made public yet. “So what, you know
, I know that for a fact. It’s always harder at the beginning, isn’t it? Just think when we first met, all of us. We were a hot mess, and we… we couldn’t stand each other, could we? Look at us now.”
“What?” Steve frowns, putting the crown down and looking up to meet his glaze. “Are you getting cold feet, Mr. Stark?” he adds jokingly, but Tony is deadly serious and doesn’t smile back.
“What is this, bad cop, good cop? What is really going on? If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you guys are Axies, but the way y’all speak… that’s American alright. Especially
“To my knowledge, this is all. Bear in mind though, I’m new to this myself. Fury sought me out – summoned me, actually – just ten days ago. To tell you the truth, I haven’t even had the time to try and make some sense out of it.”
But as time went by, and the weeks turned into months, nothing changed. Steve kept getting sick at least once every fourteen days or so, and although Joseph kept up with the injections, eventually he had to admit they simply weren’t working. Despise and frustration took over once again, only this time they didn’t find any external outlet – rather, they turned into self-deprecation, which pushed Joseph into a spiral of alcohol and violence, especially towards what he came to consider his biggest failure: his son. When the bruises became hard to hide, the school summoned both parents, demanding an explanation. That afternoon, following a particularly aggressive argument, Joseph got into the car and drove away, never to be seen again.
He stays silent for a couple of seconds, caressing softly the lines on Steve’s face and returning the gaze, then eventually spits it out, figuring it’s only fair to share his line of reasoning.
, dude. We don’t even know whether we’re actually gonna manage to get through a meal without being called away…” he offers, although the real answer would have been that giving him more warning also meant more overthinking from Steve’s part, a risk he is not willing to take.
. So there are people with super powers. So you are one of them. Is there really much difference from leading a platoon formed by soldiers with different abilities?”
They’ve spoken in the same exact moment, and that makes them both chuckle in embarrassment; the analogy with teenagers continues in Tony’s mind, and for the life of him he can’t remember when was the last time he felt so awkward around someone. This is just not in his
. He throws a quick glance at their hands together, and then at him, who replies with the briefest nod before moving his body even closer to Tony’s, now effectively shielding it. In any other circumstance Tony would
Yeah, that’s what going to happen. He knows it. But he’s going to make sure that Steve is well rested and looked after for at least a couple of days before he lets him out of the doctors’ sight again, no matter how hard Roger will try and protest. That will also give them the chance to catch the perpetrator and make sure they don’t see the light of day ever again. He might even try and push for the death penalty. Sure, Washington doesn’t have it anymore, but hey, special occasions call for special measures, right?
“Don’t be absurd, I just told FRIDAY to notify me whenever he’s in range…” he claims, and it’s only once the words leave his mouth that he realizes just how
“Damn you know me so well…” Steve replies, a smile on his lips that you could call admiration, and that makes Tony hold his tongue for a few moments, as if he himself had never realized just how much
Steve has no idea where this might be going and is a bit afraid to ask, so he just stays there, eyes fixed on the cactus in front of him, nodding as if he’s actually getting it.
The doctor nods, and Tony is relieved that he doesn’t have to fight about this. “What about… family? Did he have a partner?”
go see him, and that’s the only reason he’s here now, in this room, looking over him as he endures a restless and grey sleep. He hasn’t prepared any words to say, or signs to leave behind, anything that could make the other be aware that Tony has been there, in that very room, when morning comes. When he had been trying to come up with something –
“Wait a second, I think I saw something!” Janet cuts Steve’s sentence short, immediately sprinting towards the wall opposite to where they’re all standing. Time that the rest can turn their heads, and she’s… gone.
“Why, Mr. Rogers, don’t you look dazing in those clothes...” Jessica notices, and Tony has never seen Steve blushing before, but that’s exactly the effect that those words have on him now.
…” the other is all too eager, offering his bent elbow as support. And Tony takes it, fingers latching onto it as much needed oxygen after a long time spent underwater. With that help, the rest of the descent is a walk in the park, and once they reach the bottom floor, Tony is glad to see the soldier stopping almost immediately in front of a closed door. She quickly unlocks it with her fingertip and leads them inside. The room’s lights come up as they move across it, but even as they do it’s hard to distinguish much around them.
“How in hell…” he begins, frowning, but of course, he already know the answer to that question: Nick Fury. “Did he tell everyone about it?”
“I trust you.” he nods, and then kisses him for a second time and a third, because now that they have started again, it would be an insult to the dead to stop.
again. As foreign hands slowly slide down his hips, and Mark steps closer and closer until eventually his lips land on Steve’s, the thought re-emerges into his mind after
,” Juan remarks, a sad smile on his face now as he unlocks the gate, pushes it wide open – it’s 9 sharp. “That reminds me, we’re closing an hour earlier today, senor. Mayor’s orders. Seems a storm is coming.”
“Steve…” he whispers – now even just saying his name gives him goosebumps, and how significant is that? – shaking his head lightly whilst struggling to find the courage to say the words he
He takes a look around the room to see if there are any cameras recording; it appears to be none, so he’s about to open his mouth and pour his heart out when Steve beats him to it.
, do try. You can’t be talking about work when you’re out with someone, you’re gonna bore them to death. And yes,” he hurries to add, already anticipating the question about to leave Steve’s lips, “it doesn’t matter if you’re dating another superhero, although I strongly suggest you don’t go down that route, definitely not advisable.”
doesn’t want to get punched senseless for the third time in less than twenty-four hours: he cups his face and presses his lips against Steve’s, closing his eyes as sucking softly on his bottom lip, just the way he knows the other loves. He stays still for a whole minute, and when he finally leans back, short of breath, he immediately searches for Steve’s eyes, to spot the recognition of their connection.
“Oh, okay, that’s great, Tony! I’m so happy you two have made up…” Rhodey congratulates him, patting his shoulder and smiling enthusiastically at him.
?!” he cuts him off, sitting upright and taking his sunglasses off to look directly into Steve’s eyes, as if this was all part of a very elaborate joke he was late to catch up to.
, only real and, you know, homosexual. Yet another mess he’ll have to figure out. Will it ever stop?
Steve’s voice brings him back to reality, making him realize that while he was lost in his thoughts the other two had started to walk. He nods, hurrying to catch up with them, and once he does the woman leads them through a series of corridors first and down some stairs after. Only they prove to be a bit too much for him, so after just a few steps he finds himself stretching a hand to touch Steve, needing his support. For some puzzling reason the other almost jumps off his skin.
, that’s what he should answer, along with a list of reasons as to why that’s about the stupidest idea he’s ever heard the other coming up with.
think it’s a good idea to go talk to him on your own? As I said yesterday, I’m not entirely convinced he’s going to see reason this time…”
be, but mostly because it doesn’t make any sense, and he can’t risk exposing himself before having the chance of rationalize it.
he almost said, which is the same sentence he used to say every single time they had sex, no matter how frequent it had become at one point. Because he couldn’t risk causing him
. He’s got bigger worries on his mind right now. He jumps on his feet and hurries to the small safe in the corridor, now missing its door. He kneels in front of it, stretching a hand inside to touch the cold surface. Nothing. He sighs softly, and a second later Steve’s hand is on his shoulder, its owner looking down to him.
“I suppose it’s for the greater good…” the President sighs, nodding his approval. Tony is about to reply something overly witty like ‘Oh, absolutely…’ but he forces himself to just thank him for trusting him on this.
“Glad you accepted my invitation,” he greets him, and Steve finds himself jumping on his feet and shaking the other’s hand before even realizing it, as if answering to a reflex.
“Nonsense. You’re my guest, and guests deserve the best. You’re taking the bed, and we’re not having a discussion about it.”
“Fine, okay, I won’t tell anyone, Jesus…” the other man eventually concedes, lifting up his hands in surrender.
it’s not, he knows the other could be referring to literally anything else in the whole universe, but still, he can’t help but feeling as if it’s a direct reference to him, to
“I’m armed, and if you have any idea of who I am, you know that I’m not bluffing.” he states, taking a couple of steps forward as he waits for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.
He could ask for more info, even just to make conversation, but it somehow feels superfluous, so he just nods and hums, his gaze returning to the pot.
is (he has no idea at this point). He can’t point down the reasons as to why, exactly, but it’s a feeling that originates from his lower stomach and goes all the way up to his throat, sometimes making it hard to breathe properly. Maybe because it goes beyond simple attraction, it’s like their brainwaves are perfectly aligned right now, and when they vibrate, they produce a unique, unison sound. If he was sure that Tony was going to appreciate this analogy, he surely would have said it out loud, although he’s not totally convinced he would have managed to do so maintaining eye contact throughout – not that it matters. But he has no idea whether this would be the case, so he just nods whilst swallowing awaythose words, looking ahead as the snow starts covering the streets: “Sure, no problem.”
“Edward,” he replies instantly as he shakes his hand, even though he had had no idea he was going to give his middle name. But he has no doubt the other hasn’t been honest in his statement either, it’d be stupid
“This could be a long shot, but I need Cyclops to meet me in Brussels when the NATO meeting is. I’ve been doing my job, and it’s time I see results, or I don’t think I’ll be able to keep at it.” He doesn’t know exactly why he’s talking in code, perhaps out of habit or maybe the paranoia is finally getting to him, because even if his end of the line was somehow compromised, it’d be impossible for the Wakandan side to be as well; he pauses, mostly to help words he doesn’t want to say from coming out. “I don’t know, do you have a way of get in touch with him? You’re kinda my last option here.”
“W-What…?” he mumbles, still not totally awake, confused because he just was in the middle of a fight – hell, he was
as a father to equip his son with every possible tool for survival in the upcoming dark times ahead. And if that meant going back to some of his training – specifically the part about medicine – so be it.
And Steve does, because he doesn’t see what would be the point in arguing about that. Plus, Fury is right, Loki still has the other rings and chances are he’s realized by now he needs the missing tenth to get them to work properly.
And then Steve does it again. And again. All throughout the dinner, he surprises Tony beyond his wildest expectations, doing just about
“Hey, handsome…” he says softly, approaching him from behind. Steve lifts up his head just in time as Tony lets his arms fall gently on the other man’s chest.
Before he can complete the question, Steve kisses him again, this time deeper, sliding his tongue into the other’s mouth for good measure, figuring he needs to be more assertive if he hopes that the topic will be put aside for a bit longer. And now Tony finally understands what is going on, because he smiles on his lips as getting goosebumps on his skin and he moves closer, his free hand caressing Steve’s chest and abs while they keep kissing, breathing his smell in to help his mind letting go of his thoughts.
That manages to put an end to Steve’s rambling at last. He turns to look at him, flabbergasted, and for a couple of moments Tony has the vague feeling that he’s about to get hit in the face.
“... He had help.” Tony comes to his rescue while he finally takes a seat, giving the brief shake of head to Carol to divert further questions on the topic, hoping that the movement would prompt his partner to follow his lead. Which, although in an extremely robotic way, it does, Steve nodding to nobody in particular as sitting down next to him (Tony had made sure they agreed on the seating plan beforehand to avoid further elements of disturbance to Steve’s ability to get through the dinner - read: foot touching foot, rubbing of each other’s hands and so on).
at a restaurant of his choice – which, unsurprisingly, it’s a more refined version of a traditional diner, although he suspects that’s mostly out of respect for his rather sophisticated standards, Steve looking at it like some sort of compromise between the two of them.
Among vague murmurs of dissent, the President raises up his voice so it can be heard on top of it (as if nobody had any idea about what the third issue was about): “The last thing I want to discuss today is the superhero problem. Now, I know Tony here used to be an ‘Avenger’, but I believe we can all agree that the situation has become ridiculous. We simply can’t have these
Tony has been to many a wedding in his lifetime – especially before becoming Iron Man and even more so before his parents died – mostly because, as his father never failed to remind him, being a Stark mostly meant doing things you don’t necessarily
be, and he for one is not going to perpetuate this line of conduct. Besides, now that secrets are about to be revealed to the press and the public anyway, he feels that the more they know the better, so he takes a deep breath and brings Rhodey up to speed. When he’s done, a couple of minutes later, his friend is staring at him, a perfectly still puzzled expression on his face.
, he wants to shout, as although what he’s doing is a purely symbolic gesture, it still carries along implications and responsibilities that he
Of course, that’s just wishful thinking and he knows it, deep down, but, even if he likes to play at being always right and behaving almost as a god, he’s only a stupid mortal after all, and right now a very basic, very
getting my clothes wet. It’s gonna seem irrelevant to you, but they’re designer’s and dirty water ruins the fabric. Now you can go ahead and laugh.”
At first Tony doesn’t respond or even move, and Steve wonders if his voice was high enough for the other to hear him. But just as he’s about to repeat his question, comes the reply.
“Honestly? I don’t have a clue!” he replies in all honestly, finally turning to face Steve, grabbing the hand that’s keeping him in place by the wrist and pushing it away. “Now if you don’t
Steve has said these last words somewhat slower, and if Tony didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was because he was back at being his usual awkward self, but that’s not it. He could be wrong – and he probably
“… Okay?” Tony replies, not convinced by the beginning of that pitch, and frankly quite unsettled. Resources? Position? Sure, he’s got money, that’s a given, but last time he checked he held no official title (if you don’t count ‘retired Avenger’ as one) and had pissed off one of the highest ranked commanders in the US Army in a not so subtle way, coming this close to politely tell him to fuck off.
a proper shield. I took the liberty to… well, make it for you. As a thank you gift. For, y’know, let me stay at your place and feed me for free and…” he stops himself before letting out emotions he doesn’t want to share, still embarrassed by them. “Yeah. Anyway. Here it is.”
“Pointless for you to think of a plan, boy. You don’t think I don’t recognize that look on your face? Probably never fired a gun before, have ya?” Mr. Field teases him, and of course he’s right, Tony actively
So he starts tinkering with the suits, once again. As it turns out, productivity spikes up when you focus all of your brain on one single task and you don’t have people around you wanting your attention for something else. In little more than a week he completes the MMI Mark, aka his Intergalactic Iron Man Suit, designed to protect his body from all kinds of nasty junk he’s observed fluctuating in space, plus to provide enough food and water
. But we already knew that, didn’t we? Because no matter what, we keep coming back to each other, and I know if I just said that, you’d dismiss it out of hand, so I thought I’d use some of the magic you’re so scared of to prove my point.”
“Relax, he’s fine, he’s just busy with a mission…” There’s the smallest shift in the way Fury is sitting – he moves his weight from the right leg to the left – and whilst it should be undetectable and possibly irrelevant, Tony’s senses are way too used to catch the tiniest of details by now that even this one doesn’t go unnoticed by his subconscious, and once he registers it in his mind, it rings his invisible alarm bell.
be there!” comes the angry reply, and Tony takes it as his cue to take a few steps forwards to the counter, smiling at Miss Goodwin, whose face displays a mix of frustration and embarrassment – she told him a couple of times that she can’t take when people
who doesn’t get it, Nick!” he shouts, and although they’ve both been raising their voices his yell has something quite
“Okay, let’s do this here. Don’t wanna have to explain what we’re doing to anyone, it’d be time consuming and, quite frankly, a little embarrassing for you.”
Steve sighs deeply and yawns, moving a bit underneath the duvet, lazily, as if he really didn’t want to hear it, not in the middle of a cold night anyway; he’s about to say that when his brain suddenly starts working again.
“I can think of one reason why you were needed back here…” Steve starts, smiling at him the way he always does (or so he gets told, he himself has no idea he smiles in a particular or different way whenever he looks at Tony) and nodding for him to get close.
The mission – although of the diplomatic kind – ends up dragging on for almost ten days, in which they get stuck on the dark side of the moon in the company of Skrulls and Krees, definitely not the type of situation to spur a conversation about dating or relationships, even if they hadn’t had their hands full all the time trying to make the two races agree on a compromise. They’re actually so busy trying to prevent a cosmic war that they barely have time to exchange their usual banters in the morning or right before going to bed, and when they do talk, it’s to discuss strategy (and why exactly they got called in this mess in the first place).
A shy smile appears on the stranger’s lips now, and perhaps for lack of an appropriate response, he stretches his hand forward to introduce himself: “I’m Grant.”
he shakes his head, throwing a quick glance around at the rest of the team. They seem to be doing alright, although he can’t say for sure. He doesn’t know them, after all, and it’s behind him how they agreed to do this.
without the need of a logical explanation. But above all, he’s missed having someone by his side who
when Tony is still caressing his hand: it makes him strangely uncomfortable, not necessarily in a bad way, it’s just damn impossible for him to divert his attention from what’s going on.
“See, this is where you’re wrong. What you told me… that was beautiful. This place, whatever it is… it’s making you
There it is, the chuckle again; Tony has to distract himself to keep from jumping on Steve, so he figures the time has come to actually take a sip of the tea; it’s overly sweet and watery and he doesn’t like it one bit. Which is perfect, in a way.
Ross is not convinced, but he also knows there’s nothing he can really say or do to change Tony’s mind. He’s learned that the hard way.
As it sometimes happens, Tony doesn’t actually know what that word means, so he just shrugs lightly: “Getting acquainted with it…”
There’s an exasperated, loud sigh in the room, which he ignores anyway, because he really couldn’t care less. After just a few seconds more, he slides his hand to touch the armor’s forearm, hoping that the residue of battery which allowed him to come out of it, back in the cave, will be enough to unlock the fist still holding the ring. Thumb and forefinger pressed together, he almost closes his eyes in an attempted prayer, but before he can think of anything, as if answering his wishes, the suit gives a low-key buzz, opening up the hand to reveal the ring.
he needs to be from here on out. In the series of Cabinet meetings that follow Inauguration Day the President makes sure to remind everyone in the room that he intends to keep the promises he made to his peers during the campaign, and that he wants the three important ones done by the end of the month, which leaves them all with about ten days to work the logistics out.
Looking back at it now, as he’s saying his goodbyes and taking a last, long look around the compound, he can’t help but wondering whether he shouldn’t have just offed himself eleven years ago, instead of building a chunky suit out of scraps to escape. Would have Nick still tried and assemble a team without him? Possibly. But what about when SHIELD went to shit? He took it upon himself to provide the others with a home and financial resources to keep at it, so had he been out of the picture, the Avengers would have ceased to exist more or less in 2014, right? And that would have saved the world (and Sokovia in particular) from Ultron first and their stupid Civil War second; Cap would have never become a fugitive, Bruce wouldn’t have wandered off to a weird ass planet and maybe, just maybe, Thanos’ plan to wipe out half the universe would have never worked out. And this is without counting all the pain and the misery his behavior has caused over the years to people close to him.
“Of course. I’ll see you in a couple of hours, alright? Just want to give my armor a last check,” he explains, and before the other can say anything else, Tony gives him the quickest pat on the shoulder and goes.
pulling away as their bodies come in contact – and after exchanging a few pleasantries outside the restaurant, Carol and Jessica take their leave amidst some conspicuous giggling and winking which Tony hopes the other won’t understand the nature of.
Steve has never taken a decision more quickly in his whole life. The moment Anthony collapses in his arms, his brain already knows what he’s going to do next. The original mission can wait, the important thing is to get the guy to a hospital as soon as possible. Steve carefully slips a mask connected to an oxygen tank over Anthony’s head, and carries him back to the submarine, leaving Thor and Hulk in charge of bringing the Iron Man suit back to their vehicle. Half an hour later, they’re sprinting all the way back to Punta Arenas, where their jet is located, and from there it’s just a couple of hours more till they reach the helicarrier. Fury is on the lunch pad to greet them as soon as they step out of their jet, but right now Steve doesn’t care about anything else except getting Anthony to sick bay so, although he’s submerged with questions, he plainly ignores them all, locking himself into a silence that nobody can break. The first words that he speaks come out only once he’s reached the medical wing, and they’re directed to the doctor on shift.
Slowly, as if it had a brain of its own, one of his hands slips gently on the other man’s, leaning on it and crossing their fingers together. Tony looks at them as if he was truly mesmerized at what has just happened, and at the same moment he blinks, letting a couple of tears run down freely against his cheeks. He brings Steve’s hand on his lips to leave a kiss on its back, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths to calm himself down, to at least restore some of his composure. Or trying to.
Again, a small grin creeps up on the other’s lips – Steve knows it’s there even though he can’t see it, still not ready to face the azure eyes – preceding the answer that sounds more serious than it was intended to be: “You talk like you’re unaware of the fact that I’ve got alerts with your name set up in every possible language known to mankind, Steve, alien ones included. Remember how complicated Krullian is?”
“S-Steve?” he mumbles, a tight knot in his throat that he didn’t know he had. He uncrosses his arms to stand up again, and leans forwards towards the other man, hands desperately seeking one of his. “Oh my god, you’re awake…”
Once everything is done, he gets closer to Steve – who is now learning from Jocasta how to make floral crowns, if you can believe it – and sighs, wrapping his arms around his neck from behind and leaving a kiss on his head.
In any other circumstance, Tony would have burst into a hearty laughter: the whole thing sounds ridiculous even just
“S-Sorry, I-I just thought… Sorry, I…” he mumbles after a few tries, taking a few steps back as if afraid Tony might start throwing punches at him.
Tony can’t help but giggling, slightly amused and decisively impressed, because he wasn’t expecting him to not fail.
But before he can finish his thought, he sees Steve bending forward with the upper part of his body, and again everything seems to be happening so
Steve is a little taken aback by this revelation, and looks at him with sincere eyes, the kind of stare which makes about anyone have little doubts about his sincerity. “I... had no idea that’s the reason why you spend so much time down there...”
?” he replies, puzzled albeit all too happy to see Steve in front of his very eyes, in his joggers and t-shirt, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.
In about ten minutes they reach the hangar, which makes Tony forget about the ring and his suit for a few seconds, because what he sees completely takes him aback. Aircrafts had always fascinated him, back in the day, to the point that for a (very) brief time he had even considered becoming a pilot – the idea hadn’t exactly thrilled neither of his parents, and his father had explicitly prohibited such a career. So now, watching a bunch of these modern jets, the sense of admiration and wonder he feels are comparable to a country kid entering a big toy store for the first time in their life.
gift, you’ll see that you do have one for me after all,” the other replies, a tiny smile on his lips as he nods again: “Your eyes, please.”
as well. It was not supposed to be for real, not at the time it had happened anyway, it had just been an excuse for an already planned press conference, but then she had kept the ring and he’d figured, ‘why not?, it’s not like I’ve got anything else going on’… And to say the truth, Pepper
Tony seems to be about all of this. If it was him, he would probably be freaking out, thinking it’s some kind of prank.
– you can lean in and give them a kiss, just like this…” and with that, he gives him a little smile before going for his cheek, pressing his lips against the freshly shaved skin and breathing in the other’s aftershave for a couple of seconds – there are notes of pines and acorns and for some reasons Tony thinks it’s very fitting for him – before pulling back and reprising talking as if nothing happened: “Okay? Then you smile and take your leave
– it, Stephen needed to show me something, and I was around the area anyway, so I told him I’d drop by.”
Tony closes his eyes and leans forward now, leaving a small kiss on Steve’s lips and staying there, silent, because he really doesn’t have any word of comfort or that could make the situation somewhat better. But then, much to his surprise, it’s Steve who whispers quietly: “It’ll be enough…” before returning the kiss.
“You can’t what?” Steve whispers, taking his hands into his and looking at him, wanting their eyes to meet so they can communicate without words, as it always happens, no matter what they’re up against.
Nose almost touching the paper he’s scribbling on, Tony is so deep into his thoughts and calculations that even if the radio is on, he doesn’t really hear the music coming from it, the sound less than a background detail in his mind. It’s December 1944, and the last couple of years have given him a few strands of grey into his hair and some wrinkles across his forehead, but overall Tony hasn’t changed at all despite the harshness he’s experienced since the military has taken over his life.
“Yeah, well, you also said you didn’t want anything to do with me anymore, so kindly fuck off, alright?”
That was Tony’s voice, which in itself is a relief, because it means he’s safe, despite not being able to see properly and having a tube in his larynx. He gives a tentative nod, unsure if his movements are noticeable enough to the other.
Steve shakes his head and goes to take Tony’s hand into his, but the consistency of the other’s body is not high enough for that to happen, so his hand ends up on his own cheek instead. Tony looks away, trying to mask his own disappointment, and before Steve can ask anything related to it he quickly changes the subject.
But they actually win, and ‘plan S’ doesn’t even get close to be considered. Tony can’t believe it. It was a possibility that never really entered into his mind, defeating Thanos
“Would you have waited if I had asked you to?” he says eventually, and is surprised to hear not sadness or resentment in his own voice, but sheer curiosity.
“I never expected to survive.” he admits adamantly but without looking at the other man, knowing it would be impossible to hold his gaze. Sometimes he wishes he could lie straight to Steve’s face as he is so used to do with all the other people in his life – and as Steve himself was able to, with him – but for some unknown reasons he just can’t; once he’s learnt this, he has given up even trying.
. I’ve seen what you’ve been doing with the Parker boy, there are others like him who could really use your help.”
. “Second, and most importantly, this is a date, remember? I know it’s hard to forget I’m Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, but
“Of course not!” Mr. Field replies, slightly frustrated, and Tony sees him walking towards Steve; if this wasn’t real life the scene would seem taken straight out of an old western movie, both of men pointing their guns against each other. “Put the iron down, soldier. Your friend needs medical aid as soon as possible. You don’t
“Yeah, I haven’t been back long, just over ten days or so.” he replies, feeling somewhat proud that he had managed to not let his position known to the government: it meant his security system was still top notch in the country.
After it happened, people had tried to convince him to take up another room – the compound has plenty of free ones, just another reminder of what could have been if only the mission in Laos had never taken place, or had gone in a different direction, the
“Why would I mind?” Tony yawns again, and it’s clear his brain is not fully awake yet because if it was, he would be already up and hurrying to get dressed and go, because he doesn’t get days off, and judging by the light outside there’s a good chance he’s already late. But he still doesn’t know it.
“Well… Let’s consider the situation for a moment, shall we? There’s no better time than this for me to check out. Nobody is attacking us, you guys have quite a big rooster of superheroes to pick and mix – I believe you have enough for
“Casted off, uh?” Steve comments as he sees him making his way back to the pit, letting himself go to the seat just next to his.
The jet is almost back to the Tower when it happens, and although there’s only the tiniest change on the screen (if you can call the fact that for just a couple of seconds the blue dot doesn’t move as such), Tony immediately picks up on it, because… well, it’s not that he has a sixth sense or had a premonition, but by now, worrying has become sort of his second nature.
Steve gets up too, mechanically, just to do something because he has no idea what he’s supposed to say even if he so desperately wants to; but he’s never been too great at talking and knows he’s not about to start now. They stare at each other for a few seconds, the same expression on both of their faces: hurt mixed with pain mixed with love; how is it possible for such diverse feelings to coexist not in one but in two people, all at the same time? Tony has no idea, but one thing he does know is that he has to be the one to break whatever spell they seem to be under, or he’ll never get out of here alive, not emotionally anyway. So he launches himself onto Steve, kissing him deeply and for a long time, letting his tongue into his mouth to have a last taste to relish him with, and then, without saying anything, he abruptly pulls away, turns and heads outside, towards his car. He doesn’t stop or look back once as he drives off.
“Can I… make you an offer?” Tony asks out of nowhere as he keeps moving his legs around, listlessly, in the clear water of the swimming pool. After having dinner – Steve wouldn’t shut up about how exactly was it possible for food cooked by robots to be so
sorry, of course he is, even if this is not his fault, not really, but the point is, he should have said it earlier, when there was still time to contain the situation. Now, it would sound like something you say just because, and that’s not really how he operates.
They order a sharing platter for four, mostly because, as it turns out, Steve has never been to a ‘sushi only’ kind of restaurant, and he has no idea what 99% of the items are (it becomes quickly clear as he leans over to Tony and asks the explanation of three different kinds in less than a minute). The conversation, much to both Carol and his surprise, moves to baseball, and for the first time since they’ve entered the place, Steve seems to relax and let himself go as he begins discussing the latest Yankees game with Jessica, who is also a fan. As seeing his companion more at ease, Tony lets a small sigh of relief go, winking at Carol, who smiles back at him as if they were sharing a secret. Unusual for him, he decides to stay quiet and just throws discreet glances to Steve every now and then, taking sips out of his iced almond matcha latte to give the other the time to calm his nerves down before he moves to the ‘dating’ part of the evening. He’s decided on their way here that he would avoid any form of physical touch, not in front of their friends anyway, to keep Steve from totally flipping out on him, something that he’s quite positive would happen. Nevertheless, it’s kind of hard for him to do this, as although this is as fake as it can be, his mind keeps reminding him that it’s a date nevertheless, and once that idea is in his mind, his body strives to treat it as such.
“Cold. But fine. Hey, uh, listen Steve, I want to ask you something, but… will you be honest with me?”
, and it’s so crazy to imagine that this is the very first time he’s actually realizing this, despite knowing the man for a ridiculous amount of years.
“Hey Nick. Nice to see you.” he says, taking a seat next to him in a totally mechanical way – as if this was just another boring meeting at the Pentagon – and, same as it usually happens there, he forces himself to count till ten before actually saying what he’s been wanting to say since the moment he got inside: “Where is he?”
In front of them, the two women exchange a brief, confused (but also amused) glance, which doesn’t go unnoticed by Tony, tilting his head towards Carol, a question mark flashing into his eyes. But she only shrugs lightly in response, stretching to kiss Jessica’s cheek, and when she talks, it’s like that gesture never happened.
“I… am not sure how to use these things, Tony,” the other admits, raising his eyes to meet his, and he can read a tiny amount of desperation which he doesn’t particularly like.
“—I was referring to mission details, isn’t it?” he anticipates him, returning a giggle, “Yeah, I gathered that by the way your eyes seemed to double in size within a second.”
This time is his turn to get shushed down with a kiss, as Steve’s lips find his again, and they linger on for the longest five seconds.
his eyes are, how their shade is so different than his own and how they seem to be staring right deep into his soul now.
, but the suit is propriety of  this man here, and I won’t be allowed any further remarks on this subject. Have I made myself clear?”
“My god, Steve…” he whines, fighting back some unwanted wetness that has been gathering in his eyes.
,” Tony reiterates, feeling like they’re meaning the same thing but speaking in two different languages, and this time it’s him who smiles confusedly. “So you’ve found the ring too,” he then adds, thinking maybe he needs to be more
“Hey, but this... this is a sushi restaurant...” Steve whispers to him as they make their way between the two row of tables, a slight note of panic in his voice.
“What? No, of course I’m not…” he hurries to mutter, and then, as seeing Tony’s cheeky smirk: “I mean, have you seen where I’m living? Hard to meet people when you’re this far away from civilization…”
“… Right.” Tony bites back, briefly, and maybe it’s just his impression or his heart playing tricks on him but he can
loudly against this, but right now he knows it’s for the best. He can’t take risks, not with everything that his body has gone through recently. ‘
“Well, I’m glad we got that out of the way, and I can see your point, it’s smart. Anyway, what I thought we ought to do is to have only one official team to respond to… extraordinary threats – aliens and that kind of shit – and have everyone else as substitutes. Of course, their deployment would be subject to government control, and I was thinking, it wouldn’t hurt to put some sort of… tracking device on them, just to make sure they respect the law.”
, because that’s a word that can be used when talking about your friends too, you know? You can actually
The revelation comes up casually one Saturday night, when the two of them are sitting on the sofa watching an old screwball comedy Tony has been bringing up so much that eventually Steve has agreed to see it.
And then, just as he tries to make himself believe it has to be an hallucination, it suddenly clicks inside his head what day is today.
. But he can’t do it at this point, so he says the only other thing that makes sense to him, that can make them both feel better.
When he opens his eyes, the morning after, a streak of light illuminates the small room and the bed whose sheets he seems to have stolen all for himself during the night. He blinks some of the sleepiness away and smiles lazily, hand roaming to find the other’s body, and when it’s not found, he starts pulling himself to a sitting position, frowning slightly, but before he can call his name out, a voice echoes in the room, reassuring him of his presence: “I’m here, don’t worry…”
It takes then about half a day of marching to get to the signal, because although they could have easily landed closer to its source, everyone had agreed it was better to take the long way around to avoid getting made and losing the bit of advantage they have. When the sun starts going down, around 5pm, they stop to set camp, the plan being resting for a few hours and attacking at nighttime, when human’s visibility is reduced – or it should be, if the people they’re about to face are indeed humans.
the truth, he waits a few more seconds to give him the chance of coming clear. When that doesn’t happen, Tony reluctantly stands up again – the headache as piercing as ever – and reduces the distance between them, leaning a hand on the door both to close it and to steady himself. Something in the way he does this must seem particularly desperate to Steve, because this time he doesn’t put up a fight about it nor tries to get Tony out of his room.
about itself, like if he had just spoken from deep down his soul – and maybe he has. Fury is now staring at him, possibly waiting for an explanation (of his screaming, at least), and although Tony really doesn’t want to give it, he’s painfully aware that it could be his only shot at shutting down this plan. “Look,” he starts, taking a deep breath, “Steve and me, we want to give it a try…”
The robber doesn’t indulge him further though, carelessly waving his gun in the air as he warns him: “Not another movement of
“What are you…” he yawns out as he turns in the opposite direction, his eyes finally finding Grant, sitting on a chair with what looks like a notebook in his hands. The other shoots him a quick glance, smiling a bit shyly – why, Tony doesn’t know, nor he can guess – and gives a reply before the question is complete.
about it, not just because he and dating don’t exactly go along, but also because Steve and he have very different taste about people, not to mention the qualities they look for into a potential partner – the subject has come up a few times before, because although being a superhero sounds thrilling, there is indeed a lot of waiting around involved, with related boring conversations.
“Buenos dias, senor. I thought today was gonna beat you, but I was mistaken,” the old man replies, making a hint of salute as passing him by, something that he started once he told him he’s an Army man.
He shakes his head in response, hand covering his face for a moment, just in case the hint of a fluster decides to creep up on him (luckily it doesn’t): “Nothing. Sorry. I’m just… tired.”
Tony lets out a long sigh of relief as Fury leaves the room, leaning forward with his hands on the table and briefly closing his eyes as he speaks: “I swear to god, he pushes all my wrong buttons sometimes…”
kind of money… the sky is the limit, Mr. Grey.” he smirks, trying not to feel disgusted with himself, while the guy next to him is struggling to keep his excitement under control.
. His eyes widen a little as to fake surprise and sudden realization. He’s a master at this game, after all.
“Okay, so, I had meant to talk to you about something, Tony... and please, don’t take this the wrong way, but I’ve seen you hanging a lot around Namor recently, and I don’t think he’s a particularly good influence on you. I mean, he’s... unhinged to say the least, and so arrogant, like... you c—“
“We’re not in the habit of receiving… guests, so you’ll have to excuse the simple… design of this. It should be… comfortable enough, though.”
All during the last weeks there never has seemed to be a moment for that, too busy with their respective jobs in daytime, too late as they roamed the city streets at night. Not for the first time in his life, Tony wonders about what it has to be like not feeling the urge of being in constant movement, always focusing on what’s next, just because that’s all you know. And maybe Steve is the same, and that’s why they have gotten so close in such a short amount of time. Maybe underneath their differences, they do share a similar outlook on life. Maybe…
, at the deep core of who he is there are ordinary wishes and desires: happiness, stability, feeling that his actions bring along an important change and have indeed a positive effect on the world, leaving it better than how he found it. Nobody has ever understood that, not really, but right here, right now? He kind of believes Steve, in fact,
“Ahah, very funny. Seriously though, we can’t have humans flying around the galaxy, littering it, getting into fights and so on. Rumors spread quickly here. You’ve had your fun, it’s time to head back. I bet you’re missing American food. I know I
It’s indeed during one of these searches that an ad about “spending the holiday of a lifetime on a deserted island” pops up in the right corner of his screen; he disregards the offer, but that gives him an idea that right now sounds just about perfect (although he couldn’t tell if it’s the suggestion itself or rather the fact that he’s bored beyond his mind): he should buy himself an island. Why? Just because. Also, he reflects, that could be useful in case of a big catastrophe, or, you know, if his game gets discovered and he needs to disappear from the face of earth (it’s funny what kind of scenarios your brain can conjure up when it needs stimulation). He opens a black market server he’s been a member of since he was sixteen and does a quick search, setting filters like ‘less likely to get hit by a tsunami’ or ‘availability of a helicopter pad’; ten minutes later, he’s shortlisted three possible candidates, and he puts an offer on each of them, just to be on the safe side.
Steve Rogers? With sushi? In front of other people? He can feel two sets of eyes looking curiously at him, so he clears his throat and takes advantage of the moment to quickly take his long anticipated nigiri to his mouth, mostly so he can have the time to formulate a response of sorts.
“I got that the first time you said it, but thanks for refraining it. Still, my statement stands. Not to sound insensitive, but we simply have bigger fish to fry.”
But after Mjojnir accidentally destroys a couple of walls (thankfully not foundation ones) to get to him one night when Thor is staying with Bruce – Steve was just stretching in bed, trying to ignore the sounds coming from the other room – he realizes that
After the brief tour – he quickly grows tired of showing a bunch of empty rooms and Steve doesn’t seem all that bothered about not knowing exactly how many bedrooms and bathrooms the place hosts – Tony insists to have what he calls a ‘welcome cocktail’ on the beach, saying that he’s been looking forward to try this new recipe, and Steve, even though he’s not that fond of them – he thinks they’re overly sweet for the most part – agrees to go along with it all the same, because why not?, so he excuses himself to get changed into more appropriate clothes.
The morning alarm pierces through his ears and brain, making him painfully aware, even before he opens his eyes, that a huge headache is going to hit him as soon as he does, about fifteen seconds later, unable to ignore the incessant blip on the clock.
.  But eventually he started to run out of excuses, and when the pictures from Guantanamo came out, he knew that yet another chapter of his life had come to a conclusion. Only this time it was accompanied by a deep, personal crisis. When he had become an orphan, Steve had looked at the Army as his new family, but now even that had turned out to be just another illusion. Even worse, it felt as a
that had happened, and ever since they would always stop there on their way back to the Tower when they had to pull an all-nighter mission. “Could do 12:30, if that works for him? I’ve got a conference call with Japan scheduled for 3pm which I can’t possibly miss, but that should give us enough time I believe.”
Steve stays silent a bit, seemingly trying to absorb this scale that he had no idea existed until a minute ago. But it must somehow make sense to him because he eventually nods, much to Tony’s relief: “So, the story... how many points was it?”
Steve stays silent for a while, probably because he doesn’t quite have an appropriate response to that revelation, then eventually whispers again into his ear: “You’re my hero, you know that?”
back to the bank because he’s lost track of time during lunch, browsing Amazon first and eBay then to find some sort of micro camera with a live feed he could access using his phone. The idea has come to him all of a sudden, just as he was eating his bagel, overhearing a conversation between two other customers who were discussing pros and cons on getting a similar gadget to monitor their babies once they were born. That had sounded like a solid idea to him, so he’d taken his phone out and started researching them: as it turned out, there were
, as if bracing himself to deliver a hard blow. Tony doesn’t like this, not one bit. “And I’m not a cop, none of us are. My name is Steve, by the way,” and he extends his hand towards him. Tony ponders for a moment about it, but decides to shake it all the same.
He thinks as long as explanations go, this one is not bad. It’s certainly enough. There’s no need to further elaborate on the details, right? Unfortunately for him, Steve doesn’t see it that way, because he shakes his head and, fearing his hold won’t be sufficient, he steps in front of the other.
Fury opens up in a smile – such a rare thing to see – but it’s a defeated one with no trace of joy: “When you said no I put it on hold until your return, but, unsurprisingly, the project has now been scrapped. Except for Parker, they were all from minority groups, the last thing our ‘president’ wants.”
But he never finds out what it was actually about, because at that moment a nurse enters the room bringing the news he had been waiting for: all his levels are good, so he can be discharged whenever he wants to. In a couple of seconds, he’s standing on his feet, looking for his clothes, under the other’s gaze.
“Let’s wrap this up,” Tony eventually nods, the biggest smile on his face, “There’s a cute guy I really want to ask out back home.”
As he walks down the newly finished hallway he can’t help but feeling a bit antsy, a knot in his throat and his heart beat slightly accelerated; it’s not because he doesn’t think Steve wants to see him – Steve would never dismiss him like that – it’s more because his mind can’t help but wondering if the other man can already feel like this is his new
), or have visitors, or both, and here he goes, showing up on his doorstep like this after a full ass year of having disappeared. He knocks again when he receives no response, mostly because he feels nervous and awkward just standing there.
At first Tony thinks he hasn’t heard it right. It can’t be. Maybe his ears have got a little fucked up in space. Pressure and all of that. But as Fury keeps staring at him, he’s all too aware that nope, there’s nothing wrong with his hearing.
The way Ross speaks has always given Tony a mix of amusement and belittlement, because he’s never quite sure whether he’s being made fun of or if it’s just the way old school military people speak.
it because his own body is refusing to cooperate; his hands are on Steve’s back now, almost grasping to it, and his legs want to cling around his waist so he can be held into his arms, suspended from the floor, away from every perception of being somewhat grounded. As if he was indeed reading into his mind, Steve catches both of his legs to give them the chance to wrap around his own body, and in that moment Tony has to make a plea, because it’s now or never.
He arrives in D.C. in the early afternoon – trains are so fast nowadays that he doesn’t even have time to doze off before the conductor announces over the speakers they’re approaching their destination – and sure enough both of his friends are right there to meet him. He doesn’t really get a say of what happens next: although he tries to resist, his protests are shut down every step of the way, until he just resigns to the idea of letting them have all the decisional power for once. The first stop is a barbershop (“Really, Steve, the long hair is fine if you take care of it, but you
, he thinks as Nick’s voice invites him in and he steps inside, his eyes immediately surveying the room to meet Steve’s. Except he isn’t there, not
“Then I have to put these around your neck, or it’s not valid…” Tony rolls his eyes, pretending to be annoyed, but that goes away when Steve flashes the tags in front of his eyes, giving him a proud smile that he has never seen before. “I’ll keep yours and you’ll keep mine, okay? Nobody knows we use these nicknames so I figured it’d be safe.”
“Apologies. Had forgotten something,” he feels like explaining, mostly so not to jinx the mission with early complains – the last thing they need.
Tony looks up at the sky for a few seconds, thinking his idea over one last time before spilling it out, although by now he has studied it from every single prospective he could come up with: “Let’s get married… here, tomorrow.”
But before Rhodey can finish his sentence he closes the line and slips the phone back in his pocket.
Steve sighs, pretending to be annoyed, but Tony knows it’s just a façade: “If I do… promise you’ll elaborate on what you just said afterwards?”
Resigning from something that you were never formally invited to be a part of is very weird, because nobody really knows what the correct formula to use is. Plus, the bureaucracy alone is a living nightmare. Once he reaches the compound the first thing he does, because it’s the most nerve-wrecking of all, is to Skype General Ross to communicate his decision to him. He was expecting the man to simply not care, given the last time they properly spoke he told him without hesitation that no, he would not have anything to do with leading an international manhunt against Captain America, as if they all didn’t have way more pressing matters on their hands. Ross hadn’t liked that, not one bit.
“Great, you know me, so you know I’m not just gonna take your word about not being able to get out, right? I mean, that’s my trademark. One of them, anyway.”
“That wasn’t the end of the story, Doctor,” Fury replies, and for a second Steve stops thinking about that name, feeling even more like a fish out of water.
“No. No we don’t.” Tony cuts him off, shaking his head and smirking tiredly, his eyes on the project lying on his desk. “I just got caught up in the moment and forgot for a second it was you, alright? No need to turn it into a big deal. It won’t happen again.”
it happened (just as if he was a teenager sharing the details of their first kiss with their friends) but right then a few footsteps echo in the close distance, making Tony stop abruptly and hurrying to button his shirt up again and knot his tie before whispering to Rhodey: “Not a word.”
– and still, he just can’t bring himself to start. Pepper probably guesses it, because she breaks the ice, leaning towards him in search of his glance.
”Is this how it’s always going to be?” he asks, voice bearing all the drowsiness of the sleep he has just woken up from. He doesn’t even need to open his eyes to feel Steve’s glance on his naked body, which prompts a sly smile on his lips.
“Tony, you’re not hearing me...” the other replies, and this time his voice has an edge to it that he really doesn’t like, because it sounds so...
“My island…” is the eloquent reply, which doesn’t mean it’s not the truth, it just sounds very weird to say it out loud, and that makes him chuckle.
“Because… Love makes humans weak, Steve. And us doing what we do…” he shakes his head, and in a normal situation that would be the end of his sentence, because he’s the master of leaving threads hanging, isn’t he? But there is nothing normal about this, so he carries on, against his own will: “How do you think Ultron came into being, huh? Y’all got so mad at me back then, but did you ever stop and consider how that idea even started into my brain, Steve?”
“I know that, Shellhead…” Steve replies, for the first time in the whole evening opening up in a relaxed smile, immediately returned by the man sitting in front of him. For a couple of seconds it’s like time stops, neither of them moves or says anything, their hands still together, and Tony wonders if Steve is actually aware of this, if he has just plain forgotten about it or if he’s doing it on purpose to prove he’s able to, although he doesn’t think so, because that’s unlike him.
Tony is approaching him now, and suddenly his aftershave is everywhere around Steve, who finds himself unable to keep his gaze down any longer.
“I… guess…? I mean…” he pauses, bites his lower lip and sighs softly before finally meeting Tony’s eyes, waiting for him. “I had a… really nice time, Tony. Thanks for agreeing to it.”
But this time he’s the one being cut off, Steve’s voice covering his words in a rush that makes Tony understand the other didn’t even heard his question: “I love you too, oh my god, I had the weirdest—“
“You jerk…” he mutters, leaning a closed fist on his wet chest to softly pushing him away, narrowing his eyes at him. “How long have you been… back?”
He’s right, of course he is, no matter of much Tony doesn’t want him to be. But instead of just giving up, a sly smile appears on his lips now.
From his part, Tony is one hundred percent sure that he hasn’t heard him correctly, it just can’t be what he thought the other just asked. He frowns, and although he’d rather not have to do this, he pulls out of the armor and back on the table, grease on his hands and his face as he grabs what used to be a white towel to wipe some of it off his skin as much as he can before looking at Steve.
“But I clearly remember someone telling me that you did not – how can I say this? – collaborate in the aftermath of the Accords becoming law?”
for it – and then he starts to tell a story – completely made up – about how the Avengers would have lost each and every time if they didn’t have weapons –
“Do you… want to go on another fake date? I feel a last one is all I need, just to… you know, apply your teachings to practice and see if I got them right. I promise I’ll do my best. What do you say?”
“You’re the closest friend I’ve got…” Steve begins, and then before Tony can insert himself into that pause, he adds: “… who is also very popular with people.”
, exactly. Maybe because he’s the one who usually has to do this, whether it’s for dates of more or less formal meetings with the Avengers or other superhero groups, so it’s nice to have a change of pace for once. Or maybe because it’s
What’s left of the dinner goes by without any further incidents – Tony manages to keep his hands mostly in check, with the notable exception of when he slides an arm on top of Steve’s chair, and his partner ends up leaning back and
“I’ve got shore leave until 9am tomorrow…” Steve replies, smiling widely as kissing him again, deeply and slowly, his fingers intertwining with his.
? Shouldn’t that be a sort of moral obligation, especially given his resources? Plenty of times he’s actually considered maybe this
Not much has changed for Steve in these past couple of months. He would love to say that at least things haven’t gotten
Unbeknown to Fury, Tony has been in regular contact with the Wakandan king, mostly for diplomatic reasons but also for a more personal need of talking to someone whilst he’s in his office, to ask for advice on political strategies and, generally speaking, to hear a friendly voice. Plus, just a couple of weeks before, he had passed on information regarding a military strike the US was planning on a foreign country in which he knew for a fact there were some Wakandan diplomats working.
About a month after that January morning, Joseph called his fragile kid into the basement, sat him down and gave him the first – and only – genuine smile Steve would ever associate with his dad. “I’ve got you, son,” he said just before sticking a thick needle into his kid’s arm. It hurt like hell, but Steve bit his inner cheek until he drew blood and didn’t make a noise. He knew he was a disappointment to his father and wanted to remedy that. The moment the liquid was all into his blood, he started to throw up, so Joseph took him into his arms and brought him to his bedroom, placed a tender kiss on his forehead and reassured him that everything would be alright, adding that soon Steve would be the one carrying him like it was no big deal.
It takes a total of four days for him to reach a saturation point. On Sunday afternoon, he disconnects FRIDAY from the Wi-Fi, turns it off on his phone and computers and he’s about this close to get rid of them
“Oookay, enough is enough!” T’Challa’s voice echoes in the room, powerful and hard, making them both shut up all at once. “Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on with you two today, but I don’t want to hear it. Solve whatever problem happened last night
It’s not until a few days afterwards that he texts Steve to confirm their date, and not because it was all part of some sort of ‘waiting game’ or anything like that; to put it mildly, he just didn’t have time before. As the news of his comeback begun spreading, his phone and email got flooded with requests for interviews, comments, donations and so on, spanning from magazines to government agencies and charities; there are so many of them that FRIDAY goes in overload by the second day and he has to reprogram her almost from scratch to keep it from happening again. If this wasn’t enough, Peter texts him nonstop until he gives up and agrees to meet him, Happy shows up on his doorstep out of the blue and starts crying on his shoulder, Rhodey insists to throw him a ‘welcome back!’ party and Fury Skypes him every day at the exact same time to debrief him on everything he has seen in space, as if he was an undercover soldier who just got back from a mission.
“The hell with that,” is the curt reply, a hand already stretched out to find the reassuring hardness of the wall; only before it can, his strength already abandons him and his body gives way. Luckily for him, Steve is already on his feet, ready to catch him.
“Yeah, buddy… I’m afraid that’s not it because, well, it’s not Pep I’m engaged to…” he says, not being able to hold a giggle in, maybe because exhaustion is finally catching up to him, or because the whole situation is actually so tragic to seem hilarious by this point.
“Why? It seems you already know!” he mutters, bouncing his fist on the table a couple of times before talking again: “I’ve been working with Banner, but as you know he’s in India and I can’t communicate with him from the office because I don’t want to risk revealing his location, so… The prototype should be ready in a couple of weeks we believe. I’ll test it on myself first, make sure the backdoor works, and then I’ll get it to the President.”
“I’m not,” he admits now, hiding behind the shadow his cap throws over his eyes, “but there’s nothing you or Sam can do about it. It’s just the way it is.”
“Gotcha...” Steve replies, and then, quite surprisingly, lets a small chuckle go, looking apologetically at Tony: “I’m sorry, for a moment there I thought—“
. Then, as if he was watching this scene develop in front of his eyes instead of being the one in control, he lifts his eyes to meet Steve’s, his jaw dropping slightly as he tries to push words out of his mouth – for a reason they seem to be stuck against his palate. When he eventually succeeds, they’re the wrong ones, because his brain has stopped working a good minute ago.
“None taken,” comes the flat reply, along with a tiny smirk, only a second too late. He should add something, possibly a joke or something along those lines, but he can’t, words escaping his control; instead he leans back against the chair, distancing himself from the table and takes yet another long sip of water, and funnily enough he wonders how long till he’ll have to go to pee considering all the liquid he’s been swallowing.
, upon which respecting social rules was definitely in the top three in that list. And still, this one –
“Thought I’d give you the benefit of the doubt… Besides, if I had said something, you’d have never made it out of bed. You know that, right?”
But Fury stops midway through his sentence as the door once again opens, although this time is mostly
“… Okay, you got me there.” he admits, and before the other can ask him the question again, he changes the subject: “It’s so quiet here, I
“Yeah, that has been Hank’s understanding as well. We should get back there as soon as possible. How does tomorrow sound?”
“This is the real reason why you pulled out, isn’t it?” Tony whispers a few seconds later, looking at him even if he’s not returning his glaze this time. Steve nods again.
“See, you keep mentioning my ‘abilities’, but I’m telling you, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Sure, I’m strong, hard to deny it, but other than that…”
“What?” Tony smirks as hearing him, spinning on his heels to look back, “Is it my little waltz? It’s almost Christmas, I’m trying to get into the spirit…”
good, what with his tongue running slowly and precisely along its length just before stopping on the tip, or the way he’s holding his balls tight, as to
, he thinks, without saying it out loud. “Are we done here?” he replies instead, standing up before he can actually hear the answer.
, he tells himself. Except that’s not just it. He’s not stupid, despite sometimes he really wishes he wasn’t so quick to catch on details. He can tell there’s a buzzing in the air now, and furthermore, he
“I... uh, thank you, Steve, they’re lovely,” he mumbles, saying his name on purpose as to remind himself just whom exactly he’s talking to. And still, that can’t keep him from leaning in to leave a kiss on the other’s cheek, although he should have really avoided doing that.
participate in this thing, whatever it might be or involve. After all, when his own father abandoned them and especially once he started reading those comic books, the scrawny kid grew more and more fascinated with the ideology and ethics which motivated the first American superhero: Iron Man. Sure, he always knew those were just stories… except now it appears they actually held some truth. Only one way to find out for sure.
Tony nods and holds his breath as if he was underwater until the man leaves the room and closes the door behind; the silence explodes between the walls and inside of him, and all he can do is dropping on his knees, shaking as he begins to sob and cry as quietly as he can.
last night after Tony mentioned his hotel, and if Captain America reacts like that to an innocent suggestion, you can bet your ass it’s as serious as a matter can get. And that’s why he knows his brain has already made a decision, although his heart is begging him to ignore it.
“It’s your schedule for the NATO meeting, sir. The Chief of Staff sent it over last night I believe.”
“Shut up and let me do this. I can’t stand looking at you covered in your own blood like this. I’m gonna fire all of the nurses in this dump of a hospital, I swear to god…”
“Hey…”  Steve says, and the way he talks brings back memories of a really distant time, making him somehow sound younger even though he hasn’t really aged a bit throughout these years thanks to the super soldier serum.
Caught in the midst of drinking some wine, Jessica ends up spitting some out of her mouth as hearing these words, and as she fights against a fit of cough, Tony narrows his eyes to his companion who gives him the smallest of winks and a smile, leaving him speechless yet
“Stark, look, I’m sorry about how this situation has been going on. Believe it or not, I am trying my best to make sure we do this the right way and nobody’s safety is put in jeopardy. I understand you’ve had a tough time, but I think things are gonna get better as our side has something to work with. Good luck, and I’ll be in touch.” He shakes Tony’s hand again, then turns to Steve: “I’ll see you later.” he nods, and without waiting for a reply from either of them he walks out.
“Called you ‘Manchurian Candidate’…” he suddenly says, after a few silent seconds, the lightest scoff escaping his lips, “That’s a m—“
They end up talking at the same exact time, nothing more than a coincidence really, but it makes them chuckle because it’s never happened before, and isn’t that a sign of a deep connection with someone?
Steve sighs deeply, decisively not happy about to pronounce those words out loud for a second time, but nevertheless he repeats the line exactly the same way, as if it was something he had memorized by heart – and maybe he actually had.
” he comments, trying to lift up the tension, but his attempt falls short (although Steve might have been holding himself – he felt the lightest spasm going through the other’s body thanks to their still linked arms).
. It’s only a couple of days later, during lunch time, that he learns in a conversation their lines have been wired to receive and make only what the military denotes as “approved calls”. Which definitely don’t comprehend homosexual one night stands.
“I’m not going back yet, I’m just getting started!” he protests, and he’s already lowering his visor once again while figuring out a way to get out of this ship when Quill’s words make him stop abruptly.
. He seems to be in a valley, but the grass is ivory and the river is burgundy and there is no apparent movement all around. No wind, no flow. Just…
it has been, it makes him furious with himself – and tonight Tony has promised himself that enough is enough, Sundays are meant to be kept free even if Japan is thirteen hours ahead of the East Coast which means he should actually be on his way there right now, rather than entering the Avengers base garage in upstate New York. He’ll think about that tomorrow, he’ll come up with a plan like he always does.
“They’re… not from around here.” Nick replies enigmatically, and Tony doesn’t manage to get him to say anything else on the subject, no matter how hard he tries.
As he stares into the deep blue eyes in front of him, Tony is speechless, and the only thing he can think of doing, is to lean over and…
“Uh? What do you mean?” comes the reply, telling him that the other has been up for a while instead, maybe an hour or so.
, I was just saying, hypothetically…” rebukes Steve, quite taken aback by that strong reaction, his eyes wandering around without stopping on a specific object.
. But it’s not just that. It’s that for a fraction of a second – exactly what took him to realize what just happened – he was about to reply.
“Okay, that’s enough,” Tony intervenes again now, when it’s clear that this is not going to have a peaceful resolution, “Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to s—“
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you guys own space?” he replies, and by god his mouth is so not used to speak anymore that it aches a bit, and his voice sounds off, foreign to his own ears. He frowns as hearing it, thinking for a moment that someone else has spoken instead.
If only he could do it all again, he’d grab Tony’s hand on the battlefield just before he snapped his fingers. Maybe that would have worked, and they’d both be alive right now. Or maybe it wouldn’t have, and they’d have both been drained out of all of their energy, and drawn their last breath in unison, two heroes fallen to protect the Earth.
“You’re lucky though because you’re cute and silent. Usually with the muscular types is all a ‘me, me, me’, but I bet I’d have to pull every single word out of you or you just wouldn’t offer.”
“Vibranium. I’ll tell you about its properties later if you’re interested. But we’ve got more urgent problems right now.”
Those words direct his gaze downwards, where he sees how fast his right leg is moving up and down. He wasn’t even aware he was doing it.
The sound of the alarm – yet another thing that he hasn’t changed, because Tony had been the one setting it, at 7:05, such a peculiar time he had always thought, until he was explained that would give ten minutes for just the two of them, before the daily chaos started, and from that day onwards he had loved the reminder – brings him back to the present, making him finally stand up and getting inside the shower. He lets water fall heavily on his head, mechanical movements reach out for the shampoo first and the liquid soap after as he washes his body, his mind elsewhere, because the one stain he wishes to erase is impossible to scrub away. Ten minutes later is finally out of the bedroom, wearing a black wool jacket on a black shirt and black trousers, such an unusual look on him and he hates it with a passion, but couldn’t help himself while he was choosing his clothes, Tony’s voice in the back of his mind telling him that sometimes social costumes are there for a reason, specifically in an occasion as today. He drags his feet to the kitchen and is surprised to not find anyone in there, although he soon realizes that it’s not because everyone is still asleep, but because they know better that to stumble on his path today, especially
“Funny, I was thinking exactly the same thing…” murmurs Steve in return, turning into the embrace to kiss him again, pulling his body as close as possible, sending shivers down his spine although it’s July and it’s hot as hell. Tony wants so
What appears to be a cast is engulfing the limb up to the elbow, explaining both the stiffness and the impossibility of the movement he has just tried to perform.
, because the stakes are too high for them to reignite their feelings now, it’d be pure masochism and there’s absolutely no need for that, not when the line they’re walking on is already as thin as it can possibly be; one single misfire and it will break.
Steve thinks for a split second, before realizing how stupid that sounds. He starts walking, making sure to go as slowly as he can, and although Tony still stumbles a couple of times, pretty soon they’re able to find some sort of pace and balance between their steps.
“Let’s just… keep this for the next time, okay? You seem quite… confused,” he says eventually, slowly slipping his hand off Steve’s, before he can realize what’s been going on and freaks out.
, he calls again, and when he gets no answer, the sense of loss overcomes his body, giving it a light twitch of frustration and misery. But then little by little he starts to feel safe for some unknown reason, the room he’s in becomes clearer, and when he calls the other’s name again he could swear he hears his voice saying something to him, although he can’t exactly make out
it sounds. He puts Anthony down on the bed that the doctor points at him and sighs deeply before turning his attention back to her. “I know it sounds impossible, but I believe this man has been underwater for seven decades. We’ve found him in a cave, inside an armor made of metal which showed very little sign of oxidation, absurd as it is.”
They speak at the same time, which makes him smile, earnestly albeit just a bit, because that always used to happen and it’s good to see that after all old habits are indeed hard to die.
He takes a deep breath before blinking a couple of times to clear his vision, hand reaching out to take his gun out of its holster.
As he was saying, Pepper is smart. Sometimes even more than him. And he doesn’t want to lie to her, not anymore, he’s tired of it. Truth be told, he’s tired of
“S-Steve! Thank god you’re okay…” he smiles slightly, because there’s something about the other’s demeanor and rigidity that doesn’t sit right with Tony: he’s opened the door, yes, but the moment he saw it was him he leaned his free hand against the wall, as to reduce space to avoid Tony’s slipping inside the room. Which, of course, is
From the moment he wakes up, it takes him several moment to acknowledge that he is, in fact, conscious; he naturally rolls on his side, blindly stretching a hand forward, looking for the reassuring body of the other, but of course he doesn’t find it, because, well, there’s no one there. Steve is away on one of the ambassador missions they ask him to lead from time to time, and he’s going to be gone for a couple of days more, nothing he can do about it, except…
