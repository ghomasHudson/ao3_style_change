Sherlock was looking at him oddly, hovering around the door.
Moriarty smiled softly. “But we both know that’s not quite true.” He bit his lip and sighed. “There are certain people whose opinion you could live or die on… Certain people who could
considered to be a mess.
“People tend to find giving orders difficult after they die.” His eyelids were heavy. He fought to keep them open.
“Not necessary.”
“More things have occurred to me this afternoon than will to you in your lifetime.”
“We have our net drawn around him, but it’s—” Sherlock stopped. “Did you hear that?”
“Stay.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, broken by the night’s events. His eyes were still closed.
“They won’t let you stay here,” Mary said, glaring at him fiercely.
John scrubbed a hand over his face. The whole thing was scarcely believable. Him, Sherlock… But the evidence was there. What was it Sherlock was always saying to him?
The lock had broken again tonight and with a sinking sense of dread it occurred to him that he might not be able to do it anymore. There was too much piling up. Apart from family, there had never been anyone present in Sherlock’s life long enough to acquire such massive amounts of information about, and certainly no one to collect so many Feelings about. He had never tested his limits before, and grimly he was aware that he must be reaching them now.
“What do you mean you’re staying in my room tonight? It’s tiny. There’s only one bed!” John said, standing in the lobby, scandalised.
“I did,” Sherlock shrugged. “But then you also saw me jump off a building and hit the ground.”
Of course Sherlock knew immediately that he had something important to say, apparently just by the sound of his footsteps on the stairs, since the consulting detective hadn’t even glanced up from his microscope before proclaiming John had news to tell him.
“I knew you’d see the indisputable quality of my reasoning,” Sherlock said distractedly. He was looking around at the room. “God hotels are dismal places. You couldn’t have found one where they do more than pretend to hoover?” He wrinkled his nose at the carpet in an altogether spoilt fashion.
Sherlock returned it. “Might do. If I promise you danger will you come?”
“What?” It was one word but Sherlock could hear the edge in it.
His voice was one of several factors Sherlock used in deciding, within a matter of seconds, that John would be the ideal flatmate, and then later an ideal assistant. (Sherlock had also quite liked that John was left-handed but shot a gun with his right: Interesting.) Only John would do. He remembered how off his game he’d been when he brought Molly along on a case. It hadn’t worked.
John was mostly passive when he played Sarasate and Paganini, hardly looking up from what he was doing. He shifted and sighed or even got up to make tea when he played Vivaldi. He mentioned the songs sounded familiar when he played Tchaikovsky (of course anyone would recognise the songs from
He was thinking Sherlock often had good ideas as sank into sleep.
“I'm only a few inches shorter than you," John muttered. The man thought he was a giant (no doubt a consequence of his ego). But in fact the detective was
“Not last night,” Mary corrected. She’d been surprised to find in the visiting records (confidential unless you knew where to look) that Sherlock had not been in John’s room since Monday night. But then she supposed that was Sherlock; he wouldn’t have the patience for sitting by a coma patient.
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson looked worried, “are you sure? He was very insistent I let him know right away. He was a bit scary actually.”
Sherlock had reappeared at John’s shoulder, and noticing his gaze had petulantly crossed his arms to deliver his anti-weekend tirade.
“You chose an inn that has a total of six rooms, all of which are full. What did you expect?”
He reclaimed his mouth, demanding and fierce, and Sherlock melted into him with a small noise that made John’s blood pound in his veins. He yanked Sherlock’s shirt out from his trousers as he worked his mouth. He ran his hand down the front of that expensive grey shirt, flicking open buttons and letting his fingertips trace the trail of bare skin. Sherlock responded by slipping his hands beneath John’s shirt and sliding them up his back.
They dropped their hands as fast as if they had been burned. John spun around and walked a few paces away. Sherlock stopped the music.
Sherlock flopped back against the pillows, the confrontation evidently having drained what little energy he had, “was my brother.”
John snatched a protein bar from the shelf in his office, the only lunch he'd have time for today between the crush of patients. Apparently flu season was early in London this year. He was just tearing open the wrapper when his phone buzzed against his desk.
“You don’t touch him,” Mycroft warned them.
“You can leave this evening, if you’d like.”
An echo. Sherlock felt pain in his jaw and realised he’d been clenching his teeth, apparently hard enough to be clenching them in the real world, outside of his mind palace.
“Oh, brilliant, yeah, nice one.” John pushed past him, pacing the space between their chairs. Sherlock watched him, feeling his control of the exchange slipping as confusion trickled through his mind. As with most injuries on pale skin, the bruises made it look worse than it was. As a doctor, John should know that. He’d meant to irritate him about Mrs. Hudson. The intensity of this reaction was… unexpected.
“He hasn’t left the lab since Monday and he’s done a shocking amount of cocaine.”
John looked at him sceptically.
“Plain pasta will be good; it won’t shock your system after fasting for a week.”
“Really.” The taut strain in the word might have had pain beneath it, but Molly would be embellishing if she said so. It was only one word.
“If it’s the sex you’re worried about, I hear a lot of straight couples specifically
Sherlock looked down at the cookie in his hand. He took a bite and it was just as good as he remembered it. Cinnamon, sugar, vanilla, soft, sweet.
As Sherlock watched Moriarty snorkel away he almost envied ordinary people who must have inane dreams about flying or being late for their school exams or whatever. Almost.
The call ended and Molly stared at the phone. Did that mean he would help? Or what?
"I'm Sherlock," Sherlock had said, offering his hand stiffly to the tall, auburn-haired gentleman, who shook it warmly.
John dropped the gym bag. His lips parted in surprise and Sherlock pressed his advantage, pushing his tongue into John’s mouth. His taste shocked through him, filling his head so completely he could barely think beyond the word 'more.' Sherlock was on top of him, pushing into him, his mouth, his hands, his hips. That expensive almond shampoo blurred to a background note beneath the raw scent of Sherlock’s skin. He smelled like the night, like the electricity of a storm, like adrenaline. It sent a wave of aching desire through John's body and he nearly groaned at the sensation. For a moment he wanted nothing more than to kiss back just as roughly; bite at the detective’s full, improbably soft lips. He’d never wanted anyone more, and at the same time he knew he wouldn’t be stupid enough to put himself in the same position he’d been in three days ago.
"You're being ridiculous. You don't have to do work you don't enjoy just to prove your independence. People won't think any less—"
"Really? Now?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I don’t think so.”
John halted in his tracks. It was like warmth filtering through the mist: invisible, intangible, but it surrounded him, comforting in a way nothing had been since the embrace of Sherlock's arms around him in the street before he'd closed his eyes.
“Tell me what’s going on.”
And he couldn’t shake the memory of the detective’s eyes when John had pulled back from the kiss… Had he imagined it? It was three o’clock in the morning. He had just given Sherlock two pills of oxycodone. The softness in his eyes John wasn’t even certain he was remembering correctly could have been the effect of the drugs more than anything else. But what if—
“You didn’t seem to mind,” Sherlock said offhandedly.
John went back to the window now, running his fingers over the dressing he’d just finished on his own hand. He knew his flatmate’s erratic behaviour was a direct result of that phone call. He suppressed a shiver. Sherlock’s expression—colour drained from his face, eyes unblinking, shallow breathing.
It was a shame Tweedledum had already aligned himself with Moran. Sherlock rather liked his conversational skills.
John Watson was being impossible.
“Because he hurt
“It’s not impossible,” Harry repeated, bringing John’s attention back. “Look, you can bugger off and forget I said anything if you’re positive you could never love him. But I’ve read your blog, John, and the way you write about him, the way you describe him—I  just don’t want you to be a dickhead and automatically rule out the possibility just because you believe ‘straight’ is some kind of authoritative, prison cell of a concept. I have friends from all points on the spectrum, and I’ve had friends who’ve made themselves miserable over these stupid labels. Stupid words. I thought I could save you both time and pain by telling you what it takes a lot of dumb twats years to figure out: Don’t let a word prevent you from doing whatever the hell you want. You shouldn’t give a fuck about what label it would fall under, or what anyone else would think. You’re a free adult. Why should you care if some random wankers can’t categorise you into their simplistic little thought boxes? You don’t owe anyone anything, and it’s none of
John slid his phone back into his pocket and returned his attention to Sherlock. He marvelled at the dexterity with which his fingers flew across the strings, never hesitating, never faltering, even when at times the notes came in flurries at seemingly impossible speeds. Sherlock had the hands of an artist—pale, slender fingers with a delicacy that was entirely missing from John’s own hands, which were thick and rough and sturdy. John supposed it wasn’t surprising that Sherlock controlled the violin with the same agility he used to pick locks or handle fragile vials of dangerous chemicals.
“Perfect!” she smiled. “Well, I’d best be off then—”
“And that’s important because…”
John sniggered and Lestrade shot him a withering look. “By
“And?” Lestrade had to ask. “What about it?” Sherlock never explained anything without constant prompting.
He stared at the silver dish in his hand and thought about how his wife had shot his best friend and how nevertheless he was standing in their kitchen, like an idiot, feeding her obnoxious cats. A wave of disgust coursed through him and he slammed the bowl back on the worktop, oblivious to the yowls of protest coming from near his feet.
In the following three weeks John had six more nightmares. He didn’t always shout out loud like the first time, but Sherlock, awake most nights working or neglecting sleep as a general habit, had listened carefully for sounds of movement—distress—and crept up the stairs each time he heard it.
There were pictures of three corpses labelled A, B, and C. Bodies A and C were men with scars remarkably similar to Rodgers': thin silver lines of varying lengths and angles crisscrossing the upper inner thighs on both legs. Body B was a woman with no visible scars.
“Excellent, John! I thought of those possibilities myself. They are, of course, incorrect.”
“I’m not crying!” Sherlock yelled, tears welling in his eyes. He turned his head aside. “What mistake?”
“Well, it’s Sherlock. He’s, erm, here at the lab. Actually he’s
“And what,” John ground out the words, “reason was that?”
But Redbeard was one year older than Sherlock in human years, and by the time the dog was nine he was fifty-five years older than Sherlock in dog years. Sherlock was eight when Redbeard began to slow down. He had arthritis in his hips and he couldn’t run the way he used to.
John looked away and something occurred to Sherlock.
“Whisky neat’s fine.”
"We're not moving until you get used to the position and
John looked at Sherlock with concern. He knew the first stage of grieving was denial, but at the moment Sherlock had the sort of energy in his eyes that always gave John pause.
“Is that
“Oh, erm, hello, my name is Molly Hooper. I work with Sherlock, er, sometimes. I work in the morgue at Barts.”
“What about?” he asked, returning his attention to where he was securing something into a smaller shoulder bag.
“Little old lady.” Sherlock grinned, thin fingers still circled around John’s arm. “I told you before, they’re better than security cameras. Had to find out if one lives in the building with a view of the victim’s flat.”
It wasn’t out of pity, Sherlock knew that much. John had started to look at him that way—a doctor’s concerned eyes on his neck—but Sherlock had stopped it in its tracks. He’d flattened his palm over John’s shoulder, reminding him of his own wounds. Sherlock was not one to be pitied and John knew that. He had understood when Sherlock touched his shoulder, touched the cut on his cheek. They were both damaged. John understood. And that’s when he’d kissed him.
Sherlock didn’t respond. He didn’t know anything about normal relationships.
"I'm going to teach you how to waltz."
"There are many unknowns in this universe,” Sherlock snapped, “including how you manage function on a daily basis with such a miniscule store of knowledge in your brain.”
have just done something immensely problematic, if not colossally stupid.
“What do you mean ‘optimistic’?” he asked, holding John in place. “Don’t accuse me of optimism.”
But still when the headlines came out in the tabloids John had been stunned enough at catching sight of them on the news rack that he’d halted in the street, causing the man walking behind him to slam into his back. He supposed Sherlock had been sleeping with Janine (although he didn’t miss the fact that the morning he’d found her in Sherlock’s bedroom Sherlock couldn’t have actually slept with her that night. He’d evidently preferred to kip at the crack house where John had found him earlier). After all, Sherlock was dating her—undercover for a case, but still he’d wrapped his arms around her and kissed her thoroughly enough. It wasn’t a stretch to assume he’d done everything else necessary to play the role of ‘boyfriend’ convincingly. John knew better than to believe the tabloids. The ‘Seven Times a Week’/‘He Made Me Wear the Hat’ headlines would be Janine getting some kind of backhanded revenge for the way Sherlock had played her, but there was no reason to believe it wasn’t simply exaggeration rather than complete fabrication.
Sherlock huffed in frustration. “Every time you so much as touch me I get waterfalls worth of
The sharpness of Sherlock’s gaze was not something memory could hold. It didn’t matter how many times he’d experienced it. Each time Sherlock looked at him like that John felt his hair prickling the back of his neck and his muscles tensing. John crossed his arms, looking off toward the trees lining the park’s paths, empty on the cold, grey afternoon. He waited for Sherlock to come to him.
“Do you mean…” John faltered. “Did you not… Have you not…”
“Upstairs,” Sherlock indicated John’s bedroom with a tilt of his head.
Sherlock shook his head, “You couldn’t have come this time. It was a matter involving the Credit Suisse Bank and the client insisted upon the strictest confidentiality.”
John felt a smile tugging the corners of his mouth. It never ceased to amaze him how seamlessly the detective could switch from genius to batty. "And what words are those?"
John tipped Sherlock’s head back and kissed him like he loved him.
These thoughts were not new. He’d been left alone with them once before. A week in prison. Solitary confinement. They’d driven him mad. Mad enough upon his release that it had taken sleeping pills and then painkillers and eventually heroin to silence the voices that tormented his waking hours.
John lifted his eyebrows. "Really?"
“No. There’s nothing further to be found without the autopsy results.”
Leave it to Mycroft to give young Sherlock illegal ‘toys’ to play with. The strength of the laser was undoubtedly higher than regulations allowed.
He yanked one of the crime reports off the wall. “Why would I want to contact her?” He sat down again at the table.
“And I’m doing the best I can!” Lestrade snapped. He took a breath and continued more calmly. “I do trust you to get the job done, you know I do. But if you’re going to be pulling guns on people and getting emergency services called on you, then I’m going to have to keep showing up here.”
“He’s an assassin,” Mycroft was saying. “He had a successful career being paid to kill various criminals and gang leaders by various criminals and gang leaders.”
As a child Sherlock was just as nightmarish as you would expect. Far from being in control of his emotions, his was a personality of extremes. The things he liked delighted him to a state of joy that had him giggling and jumping up and down and charming everyone in the room. On the other side his tantrums were enough to make the neighbours call to confirm the boy wasn’t being murdered.
“You are. Sherlock’s off tonight and you still have to leave the house.”
bed while you’re gone.”
John sighed, "No, I am, but we could set the record for the world's shortest marriage if Mary dumps me at the reception for being shit at dancing."
The words Sherlock had said to John exactly one week ago replayed in his mind.
John fought an impulse to reach out and grab him as he turned back down the steps. He watched him duck into the waiting cab and drive away.
Sherlock stared at him, almost gaping as the understanding hit him. John was describing not one moment from years ago, but an image he’d seen over and over again. One he’d seen even recently. John’s nightmares. After the pool—it wasn’t about Moriarty or a Semtex vest. It was the closest Sherlock had come to dying since they’d met. The sniper’s light. Moriarty was the first of Sherlock’s opponents John believed was truly capable of killing him. And then after his fake suicide—
“I wanted to give you my compliments on your poison.” Sherlock tilted his head back to meet Moran’s pale eyes. “The one you used on Rodgers, Parker and Riley. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“Don’t be dramatic, little brother. You chose your fate when you pulled the trigger. This is the best I could do for you.”
"If there was anything more boring than wheat it would certainly be wood."
better repeat that, Sherlock,” John said, voice shaking. “Now, again, WHAT?”
“Sure.”
Sherlock sprang from his crouched position on the chair, striding over to his laptop. He sat down at the living room table and flipped up the screen.
However, his brother had called him a virgin, in more or less terms. And Mycroft would know, wouldn’t he? Sherlock could read a person’s sexual history in a glance, and John had seen first-hand that Mycroft’s skill in deduction was at least as good, if not better than his younger brother’s (John remembered Mycroft even correcting Sherlock’s observations once or twice). Assuming Mycroft was right, would Sherlock really have sex for the first time with Janine for the case? John supposed he would. There was nothing he had known Sherlock
Sherlock snapped his head up. John was gazing at him steadily—irises flecked in shades of blue… This exchange might have been easier if he had imagined John with a bag over his head.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John thought Sherlock must be the only person drugged with heroin who could still manage exasperation. He gestured limply out at the space of the warehouse, and for the first time John looked around.
Sherlock scowled. “They had only miniatures of food at the party, and the fat people were guarding it.”
He sat up fast and the room swam around him. Drugs. He had been given more than morphine at the hospital.
The door shut and in a flash Sherlock was pressed up against it.
“Really?” John raised his eyebrows.
“I need you to send a text to Lestrade,” Sherlock murmured low in his ear.
“How I’d do without you,” John echoed, horrified.
float by. He looked upstream and squinted at what looked like a plastic tube, vertical in the water, moving toward him.
Sherlock walked quickly through the streets, destination only on the periphery of his consciousness. He knew the city well enough that he could put the part of his brain concerned with directions on autopilot. The night air was cold on his face; he tried to let the sensation ground him while the chaos of his thoughts blurred the edges of reality.
It was cold. The air conditioner was loud.
, he decided. He would think about it soon. But not tonight. For now he was content just to have Sherlock here, so close to him, on top of him even
“No time.” Sherlock cut his eyes sideways towards John. “Not that I wouldn’t like to see you ask Lestrade to get us a warrant for this particular purpose.”
The answer to that question, he imagined, was complicated enough to keep London’s best psychologist busy for a year. But he could say definitively he missed the distraction. Silence hung heavily in the empty flat. He’d never needed to be distracted more than he did now.
"You don't; I saw you draw it. It's just a red."
And Sherlock had told him he loved him, hadn’t he?
Sherlock felt his fingers clench the chair's arm. It was true; he hadn’t noticed. The information was there, subconsciously recorded; his mind had tried to warn him in the dream just a few days ago, lying on the living room floor, holding onto John:
John did not want to talk about it, but he also knew that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t rest until she’d wrung it out of him and then properly consoled him. So John sighed and said, “I killed her cats.”
were…” Sherlock waited, but John just ducked his head and smiled ruefully. “Look, what do you think about a stir fry tonight?” he asked, shrugging off his coat and walking toward the door to hang it up.
And she had resented him for it. She was sixteen when he was eleven, and she was made to stay home every Saturday night so his parents could go out. And that was even before their mum died, and their father had needed help with everything. John understood. But at the time it hurt. She was cruel, making no secret of the fact that he was nothing more than a burden. And John, recognising her lack of love for him from an early age, had been as difficult and nasty back toward her as possible. The damage was too deep, too long-lasting to be repaired just because they were adults now with better perspective.
anyway—dashing out the door and slamming it behind him, but not before slicing John’s hand and his own with knives, collecting their blood samples like a deranged serial killer.
“Someone’s coming.” Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and pulled him around behind the back of a monument.
“Yes, the woman at reception sympathised deeply with Waffles’ untimely death.” Sherlock grabbed John’s jacket and held it up.
“Such an assumption would be purely guesswork at this point. Best not to make assumptions with insufficient data.”
“He’ll need three times the dose of heroin you gave me.” It was a rough estimate, but Sherlock could size people pretty well.
“What are we doing?” John asked.
She’d gotten next to nothing out of him about what they were doing. She knew they were working with John’s blood. Considering the tests they were running on lab rats she also knew it had something to do with vasoconstriction. None of it made any sense. But even the slightest inquiry on her part was rebuffed by a demand for silence, and she’d given up trying to ask.
John’s senses automatically re-geared to focus on two priorities. One: protect Sherlock. Two: neutralise target. In the span of a second, John did two things at once. With his left hand, he grabbed Sherlock (who had been walking slightly in front on John’s left side) and pulled him
Sherlock felt a wave of endorphins rush through his body. It was exactly what he’d needed to hear—what he’d wanted to be true but couldn’t believe was. John had proven his courage and tenacity time and time again, but somehow Sherlock had never quite believed it was possible he could have found someone who would—or not
“Who?”
he wanted to say because he wanted Sherlock not to hurt. But his mouth wasn’t responding. The fog was settling back down, pressing in around him.
The Ricoletti case had reminded him of Moriarty's own death of course, but that had been the point from the beginning. In fact it did remind him of
“Correct. So, how are you going to get a body out of a posh flat like that, past the CCTV cameras and Mrs. Bennis’s twitching curtains? You can’t just drag it down the stairs in a bag.”
Sherlock was marking some notes on his sheet music when John returned with the drinks. He handed one to his flatmate and sat down in his chair. Sherlock joined him a moment later, sitting across from him.
“And what, he’s the only hitman in England?”
“Your prattling will be much more tolerable when you’re doing it under water,” Sherlock rejoined.
also has scars on his thighs?”
“Modesty is a waste of energy. It accomplishes little more than to cloud facts with half-truths.”
John swallowed.
Such exchanges were necessary; they kept Sherlock’s arrogance in check (if only slightly). But Sherlock probably never forgave him for it—one of the many reasons for the bitter rift between them.
“No problem,” he said. “I’ll find something.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “What makes you think I have?”
“So, Sherlock,” Mycroft continued his speech, “since you have proven yourself incapable of living independently, without supervision, we must implement a new system. These are your options.”
“Mrs. Hudson took my skull.”
He realised all of this before his seventeenth birthday and he was determined to teach it to Sherlock. He’d been through hell and back but Sherlock didn’t have to. He could avoid all of it, all of the pain. Mycroft had always been level-headed and stoic to the point of unnerving his teachers. Thinking about what loss had done to him he knew he couldn’t allow it to happen to Sherlock. Because if it hurt him that much, he was certain it would destroy his more sensitive little brother.
"God, it's too early," John mumbled. "I'll just brush my teeth. Be down in a minute."
He put his palm over the scar on John's left shoulder. John felt the heat of his hand burn into his skin. He’d forgotten he was also shirtless, and was suddenly very aware of what their position would look like if anyone were to walk in. Thankfully it was too late for Mrs. Hudson to come up—she would have been in bed hours ago.
” the bearded man said in Russian.
John felt his face get hot. He noted with interest the feel of his capillaries dilating.
He didn’t have a second to reach for his phone (to text John and Mycroft his coordinates) before the man lunged at him. Sherlock ducked, twisting at the same time to switch their positions. The bodyguard grabbed his collar and he bonelessly shrugged off his coat. It gave him just enough time. He reached the door, throwing himself against it. It opened an inch and then jammed against a chain. Someone had fastened a new chain on the door. Perhaps Moran wasn’t as enthusiastic about him living to see his surprise after all.
John turned onto a dark, quiet side street. He was always amazed that such a thing could exist in the centre of London. Even somewhere between Piccadilly and Westminster there were empty streets, sheltered from the noisy throngs of tourists just a few blocks over, all herding up and down the same narrow routes.
“I want to know how good you are,” Sherlock said. “Go on. Show me. The doctor’s wife must be a little bit bored by now.”
“Stuck,” John replied. Having got the waistcoat off he’d moved on to the considerably smaller buttons of his shirt. Upon failing to get them he had attempted to pull the shirt over his head.
“I thought so. Took you
“No blood or vomit in my cab,” he warned, eyeing them as though they had come from some kind of warehouse rave party. “Or any other bodily fluids,” he added for good measure.
“I’ve already proven I can pin you down,” John said. “I can do it again if I have to.”
Moran chose to ignore him. “Moriarty liked stories. He liked drama. He liked you too, you know. He had a very specific plan for you. We don’t want him to be displeased.”
“Ok,” John said, returning to his laptop to type the note. “And how about the movers who stuffed the body into the armoire? Any more info on them?”
Sherlock smirked. He leaned back again, speaking to the wall opposite but feeling John’s presence behind him all the time. “As far as poisons go this one is rather brilliant. The murderer distances himself from his victim by a matter of weeks and there’s no poison found in the autopsy. He gets away clean.”
John Watson was filling Minnie’s food dish when he was suddenly paralysed by a flash of blinding clarity. Holding a bowl of cat kibble, John realised his marriage was over.
So his instructions to Mycroft were tell him nothing of John barring serious illness or injury. Funny to think that if John had only come down with pneumonia, or gotten non-fatally stabbed, Sherlock would have been at his side as fast as he could get to an airport. Mission paused. Experiment cancelled. But John didn’t do either and Sherlock deleted all of the half-written messages he typed into his phone.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and it probably occurred to all of them just how literal that statement was.
“Hooks like that are used, most recognisably in Amsterdam, for moving furniture in and out of flats that don’t have lifts and are too narrow to carry large objects up and down stairs,” Sherlock explained. “Our killers probably thought it would be a quieter method of getting the body out of the building in the middle of the night.”
Sherlock glared. “I’ve told you before. It’s a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”
Sherlock had chafed at the insinuation. “I’m not a child anymore, Mycroft.”
Could it have been Moriarty on the phone? Sherlock had said he was dead; no question. Maybe it had only been Moran. But what could he have said to make him react like that? John had seen Sherlock talk to Moriarty before. The consulting detective was invariably snide and detached in the face of criminal masterminds. But this time he hadn’t said anything at all. And his expression… Could it really have been fear?
John stuffed his phone in his pocket and went to the living room table. He flipped open his laptop. There was something he could do before he died after all.
Through the confusion a vision of that afternoon surfaced. The same turmoil—the rushing thoughts slick like poison in his head. But he’d known how to handle it then. He’d known how to hush the storm even as it surged through him…
“My father used to say ‘only boring people get bored,” John hazarded, kamikaze style.
“Like a RAT in a CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT,” John shouted. “Just like Dartmoor, right? You wanted to torture me and watch how I’d do?”
He touched his left upper arm, tracing the cut where Carl Reeves’ bullet had grazed him through his sleeve. That, he assumed, was how the poison had gotten into his system. The bullet had been aimed for Sherlock. And John had taken it for him. Perfect.
“It’s not obvious to me.”
“Yes I do.”
“No,” Sherlock said, catching his wrist. “This way.” He’d pulled him, John remembered.
“And you named our imaginary dog ‘Waffles’?” If he ever thought he had reached a point where Sherlock could no longer surprise him, he was proven wrong time and time again.
Mycroft watched his little brother solve the Rubik’s Cube he was playing with, not as fast as he would have done it, but differently. Mycroft would never admit it to his already over-spoilt little brother, but he had always been impressed by Sherlock’s intelligence; he had a unique and creative approach to everything he did.
"I think it's time we went home," Sherlock said sternly.
“I knew there was a good chance the shot would kill him,” she’d said quietly, keeping her eyes down. “But I hoped—”
John looked at their latest target’s cover photo. It had been taken at a wedding, and it showed the groomsmen with their arms slung over each other’s shoulders, some laughing some looking at the camera. John almost felt sorry for the guy. They didn’t even have a plan yet, but he was fairly certain that of all the possible solutions to this particular dilemma, zero of them were going to involve a pleasant evening for Tony Bauer.
Sherlock began to play, and with no small amount of trepidation John made his way upstairs.
John stuffed his hands into his coat pockets a bit awkwardly. “I’ll just go lie down for a bit then.”
Mycroft had seen it too. They rushed to John’s side as he shifted, lifting his arm to embrace the man curled around him.
Co je sakra s tebou? Neumíš anglicky? -- What the hell is wrong with you? Can't you speak English?
He placed his hands on her waist and he turned his head to look at Sherlock thinking,
In all fairness John’s amateur writing—with his overly romanticised perspective of their cases and his questionable use of punctuation—was an easy target for mockery, and by all means Sherlock would continue to do it. But that wasn't what he'd meant to say. Not then, anyway.
steps. I thought everyone did."
Moriarty fell silent, watching Sherlock with interest.
A pause.
John swallowed too quickly and the whisky burned the back of his throat. “A prostitute.”
crime scenes, and that he was only there by invitation. Unfortunately Lestrade knew he was going to get absolutely nowhere on his own with only a pair of mismatched socks to go on, so he set about steeling himself against everything that was
John thought uncharitably. But in his defence he was sore and exhausted from sleeping on the floor all night and—
“COME ON, WATSON!”
Sherlock had figured that as a successfully (at least for the most part) retired assassin, Mary would be able to balance him. John would continue to work on cases with Sherlock, and the rest of the time Mary would do the mundane things with John that Sherlock couldn’t—like going to the cinema, and cooking dinners, and seeing people in social situations. Sex too, he supposed, due to his own aversion to it and John’s rather frequent yelling about not being gay.
“You—what?” There were clouds covering the moon and Sherlock’s ivory skin was striking against his dark hair, against the dark night.
It was the first time his little brother asked him for something he couldn’t do.
“If it wasn’t meant to be a puzzle for me, why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” Sherlock asked, looking up at John from his seat on the stairs.
John pushed his hands through Sherlock’s hair on either side, pulling those soft curls back from his face. He stopped, just for a moment, and opened his eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were still closed and he nudged his face forward at the sudden absence of John’s lips. When he didn’t find them, his lashes fluttered slowly open and John was struck speechless by the open warmth and transparent need in his eyes.
“Waffles?” John asked, hardly daring himself to guess. He turned and put his arms into his black coat. Sherlock did this so often when he was in a hurry—helping John into his coat—that John almost didn’t notice it anymore.
Sherlock squirmed ineffectively, and John knew he’d won. He’d pinned army guys much bigger than him with this same hold and he knew it would work as well on his flatmate. Sherlock seemed to realise this and stopped struggling.
“But a person would notice if his blood pressure dropped that low,” John added. “Why wasn’t Rodgers checked into a hospital when he died?”
But the past was nothing compared to now. He’d never been more furious than he had been this past year. And he also knew, with a conviction that made him squeeze the pillow harder, that his anger had never,
But Sherlock had stopped listening. His eyes were skimming over his new data.
“You mean you guess.”
Sherlock recalled the reference to John’s wedding. However, he maintained there was nothing ‘weird’ about preventing a violinist from butchering a Mozart classic. One would expect a so-called professional to recognise the difference between forte, mezzo-forte, and fortissimo, and that he should be reprimanded upon his failure to do so.
“I meant, thank you. Moran was a powerful target. With him eliminated Moriarty’s gang might never recover.”
He could, of course, hire someone to take care of these things for him. But then he would probably have to pay that person. One can’t pay a person to fix his financial problems if one has such financial problems that he needs to pay a person to fix them. Sherlock furrowed his brow. This was not his kind of puzzle.
died.” Moran’s pointed out. “But as I was saying, I think you’ll agree that for the sake of practicality it would be much more expedient to kill you now, while we have you here.”
“You want to do experiments on me? Hm? You want to manipulate my life according to what you think is best for me?”
The men disappeared through one of the various doors leading off of the warehouse’s main space, and the lackey who remained behind brought over a chair. Sherlock knew there was no use trying to fight. The sniper at the door was still in position, and when he looked up he could just see the outline of two more snipers in the shadows of the rafters. He wondered if the Russians had noticed them. They probably hadn’t. People never notice anything.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
Dizzy. John was dizzy,
"Oh shut up."
“We’ll cut you loose,” Moran assured him. “It’ll be a fair fight. No weapons.”
Tearing his eyes from his flatmate he looked back at Hannah and couldn't help feeling surprised. An embalmer. He never would have guessed. But then he’d known from the beginning that the science of deduction was never going to be his forte (despite Sherlock’s continued attempts to get him to try it).
“Or haven’t died
” John gaped at the raving detective.
John caught the ball and raced forward. He made it the few metres to the halfway line before an opponent slammed into him. On the ground, with heavy bodies strewn over him, he managed to scrabble the ball out to his teammate. The crush of weight pressing him to the grass lifted and John sprang to his feet, darting back into position.
"Mrs. Hudson woke me up," Sherlock said tetchily. "I'm paying it forward."
“Whisky and soda?”
"I don't want wheat, wheat is boring," he'd said.
“Cameras which you will not tamper with,” Mycroft clarified, clearly having anticipated Sherlock’s answer, “under pain of my
John had said in the lab that day. And how sure Sherlock had been then that he already knew everything—his deductions speaking for themselves. But then John had shot a rogue cabbie and Sherlock learned there was more. At every turn there was more. How was it possible? Sherlock needed less than a minute to learn all that was worth knowing about a person, and he’d lived with John for a year and a half. He knew his scent, his posture, his gait, every expression, every one of his laughs. He could identify him in the dark by his breathing. He could draw every detail of the contours of his face from memory. (John’s face had aged only subtly in the five years since they’d met. Sherlock suspected John would always look young for his age. The boyish quality that correctly suggested a mischievous personality wouldn’t fade.)
“Only the strongest can withstand it,” he explained to Sherlock.
“You’re welcome,” John said, saving Sherlock the trouble, and fell fast asleep.
Mycroft said, holding up his phone.
“What’s he saying, Boss?” Sherlock heard a voice in the background.
— And what if he did? Was John ready for that? For what that would mean? John felt his heartrate increase. He had started this, and he really
“Right,” John said, backing out into the open space of the room from where Sherlock had him trapped between the couch and the coffee table, “if you do go mad, any chance it could
Pause.
His flatmate was gone by the time John came back from his run. When he undressed for a shower he felt almost a pang of regret as he undid the gauze Sherlock had wrapped earlier. He smiled as he remembered the detective's careful concentration as he followed John’s directions. As flippant as Sherlock had been in the alley after the shooting, the gentleness of his touch as he cleaned the cut suggested the concern that had been missing from his words. It had been… nice.
John lowered his eyes.
The cold crept up and tightened across Sherlock’s chest. Of course that’s what it must have seemed like to John. He and Mycroft had structured it that way, hadn’t they? The plan had been for Sherlock to jump off the roof and the world (and John) would believe he did it because he felt worthless—his detective skills faked, the world against him, no reason to live. Newspaper headlines:
“But that’s boring,” Sherlock objected.
“I’m not.”
John stepped to the side of the pillar, in plain view of Moran but careful to keep in the camera’s blind spot. He supposed it didn’t matter much if the security got a visual of him, since he would most likely be dead in a few days. But still, he didn’t want to leave Sherlock with a mess to clean up.
“That doesn’t mean you have to encourage—”
He lifted his gaze from Sherlock’s neck and was surprised to find he was looking at him hesitantly, and all at once John remembered that Sherlock (most likely) had never done this before. Technically John had never done this before either, not with a man, but he was a doctor: he knew the logistics at least in theory. But Sherlock had chosen not to be physical with anyone until now, and John resolved not to push him. They would go as slow as necessary—
Finally he heard the door to the lifts open and when he looked around the pillar it was Moran walking into the garage. He was certain. He’d memorised his picture from the web page. He was alone. Perfect.
Mary shut the door gently behind her. She took a deep, shuddering breath. She’d done all she could. If she didn’t want to see John get hurt, there was nothing she could do but not watch. It was over now, and she was determined to hear no more of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. One day, she knew, she would see John’s name in the obituaries, or his murder on the news, and at that time she would have to take solace in knowing she had spared no effort in trying to prevent it.
. In a flash of clarity Sherlock understood: In John’s mind Sherlock had been a good enough reason for him to live, but he hadn’t been a good enough reason for Sherlock to live.
had nothing to do with—
He navigated Sherlock’s phone as easily as his own and prepared to type whatever Sherlock would tell him.
Mary remained silent, sliding the pendant on her necklace back and forth on the chain.
Sherlock nudged him and John realised he must have been gaping.
Lestrade sighed, “Because, Sherlock, you are so nearly mad I’m afraid one day you’re going to go round the bend and I won’t notice.”
foot. Again. One, two, three…"
“She’s smart. She knew what I was going to do,” Sherlock mused as they walked. “I didn’t expect her to kiss you though. She added a bit of drama to the scene.”
“The location of the scars has been chosen with concealment as the priority. He’ll deny having scars, whether he has them or not, just as he’ll deny knowledge of Riley’s scars whether he knows of them or not.”
Sherlock pulled a key from his pocket as they reached the door to the room. “Relax, I had them bring up a spare bed.”
"What happened?" John asked when his giggling subsided. "I started out the night as an undercover agent watching topless strippers. Now I'm wearing lip gloss and playing Candyland."
“The kind of businesses that sell kitchen appliances or the kind that sell drugs?”
Sherlock hesitated, crossing his arms over his chest. “You said you’d never play it with me again.”
He knew he could text Sherlock, but if Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to let him know he was leaving, then John was not going to bother texting him to ask when he’d be back.
John leaned his head back against the pillow. “How long are they going to keep me here?”
John mentally pulled him toward the door. (If Sherlock could read his mind, John decided he might as well use it to his advantage.) Sherlock didn’t resist, and only paused to say, “Thank you, Mrs. Bennis, you’ve been most helpful,” before following John out of the flat.
Not until after the pool.
John sighed. It had been a long day and he wasn’t in the mood to talk about it. But considering he’d just barged in on Sherlock in the middle of the night, he figured he owed him an explanation.
Curious, Sherlock laid down on his back next to John.
“What? Is there something else you want, Mary? Since we know that what
“Give her money and she’ll move on.”
“Simplicity!” Sherlock yelled, disappearing into his bedroom. When he arrived back in the living room he was carrying a black duffel bag. “While rarely useful in my work, it should never be entirely overlooked. John, you are the very reminder of simplicity.”
“There had better be some
“Hello!” Sherlock said brightly when Tony Bauer opened his door. “I’m Sherlock; this is John. We’re friends of Kathleen.”
“I thought you were stronger than this”—Moriarty dropped his head—“I thought you were smarter. How disappointing for you. How disappointing for everyone who thought you were better.”
Mrs. Bennis blinked her large eyes behind her glasses. “Why, yes they were."
“So, how shall we start?” she asked, moving to stand in front of them. She undid the silk belt around her waist and the dressing gown fell open. John swallowed, dragging his eyes up from her lingerie to her face. “How about a private dance?”
Despite appearances he truly did care about Sherlock, only six years old and already the only person clever enough for Mycroft to speak to without having to feign interest. He would help him by counterbalancing his parents’ spoiling and endlessly forgiving manner by preparing Sherlock for the real world. He invented stories about The East Wind to tell him at night.
Sherlock was silent, glaring at the opposite wall.
The plan was almost absurdly simple. But then, John knew better than most how simple it really was to kill a man. Especially if you happened not to be concerned with the consequences.
there had been no pulse. Sherlock had cut it off himself to trick him. His anger flared. His hold, which had slackened slightly in surprise at the force of Sherlock’s pulse, retightened to a death grip. His dominant hand crushing Sherlock’s dominant wrist.
, does it?”
The spinning in John’s head was being replaced by a floating sensation. “Yeah, wait, no; what?”
It was the biggest mystery in John’s life, and the only one he knew he couldn’t ask Sherlock to solve.
He looked over at John and saw him gazing at Sherlock with rapt attention. Lestrade bit his lip in agitation. Maybe John was secretly a Zen master, skilfully trained in the art of patience. He furtively glanced sideways again to recheck John’s expression: still captivated. On the other hand maybe John wasn’t so much enlightened but simply mad as a March hare. For all he knew John was currently mistaking Sherlock for a football match. He shook his head and decided that waking up at five was not good for his reasoning processes.
John knelt over him. He felt his forehead, checked his eyes. In the soft mixture of street and moon light John could see Sherlock’s pupils dilated to the correct level in the dark. The heroin had worn off. His eyes ran down to the detective’s neck. Sherlock swallowed and winced. John knew the pain must be considerable if the detective wasn’t able to ignore the complaints of his transport the way he usually did.
She regarded him silently. Normally she would rise to the bait, call him a twatface and storm off. But this time she was quiet. She let the silence go on until John felt uncomfortable and even slightly embarrassed by his outburst. He crossed his arms and sank back into his chair. He supposed they had taught her this strategy at her AA meetings.
“I need the freedom to work.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, I will eat it.”
Sherlock may have a low opinion of his detective abilities, but Lestrade hadn’t gotten to the rank of Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard by accident. His observation skills, while admittedly lacking in comparison with Sherlock’s, were much sharper than the average person’s. And what he saw when he watched Sherlock and John together was nothing short of incredible. Despite Sherlock’s expertise in concealing, burying, locking away, tamping down with a shovel, or whatever it was he did to his emotions, they somehow managed to shine through, like the faintest filter of light through the smallest of cracks, when John was close by.
John raised his eyebrows, not that Sherlock could see his expression under the mask.
Then there were voices. Bizarrely, Mycroft’s was first. Something about an injection. Murmuring of other voices—he couldn’t hear them. Only Mycroft. He caught enough words to understand he was in a hospital. Coma, it seemed. And then there was Molly’s voice. She was crying. And then Mary’s, telling him everything would be ok. But where was Sherlock?
“Or,” he said, voice low, warning, “I wouldn’t treat him like a child. We don’t
“I think the dead men were guinea pigs. Randomly selected test subjects. I told you before the drug is new: they’re testing it. I think the woman who administered the poison is merely a pawn in a much larger game. We have to find the king.”
“I need you to hold this end.”
“No time for buttons,” Tweedledum said.
"Oh, love, you know how much I care about you. I'll support you in whatever you choose. But just… think about it. You still have time. I know you boys don't think much of my history, but I've learned a thing or two in my years and I can tell you it's better to change your mind now than later."
"Ugh," John said with his usual eloquence, "this is a nightmare."
Pause.
something at the back of his mind shouted and Sherlock reacted like a switch had been flipped. He grabbed John’s arms and pushed him back, propelling himself off the table.
John closed his eyes:
He was older than Moriarty, closer to forty, sharp suit: Hugo Boss if Sherlock was not mistaken (he was never mistaken about suits). As Sherlock walked closer the deductions about his new opponent scrolled through his head.
“I’ll stay,” John said softly. “I love you.”
He sighed into John's t-shirt. He couldn't think about this now. It was a future bridge to be crossed (or demolished with dynamite) when he came to it. There were more pressing matters at hand. Moran for one. And to deal with them, first they would have to get off the floor. He cast about for ideas, careful not to move while John's regular breathing told him he was still asleep.
“Why didn’t he wake me?”
She set the knife down and picked up, John was surprised to see, a tube of lip gloss. She applied it slowly, set it down, and walked back.
Eyes still closed John smiled. Sherlock’s fumbling was reserved only for attempts at sentiment.
John stilled and took a deep breath. His eyes flicked up and locked on Sherlock's. Sherlock's muscles tensed but he willed them to ease. He was role modelling, after all.
“It’s been scrubbed within an inch of its life,” Sherlock lamented. “It’s horrible. Absolutely no dust left. Not one speck.”
“And the, erm, what The Woman said… That time at her place…” Sherlock wasn’t meeting his eyes.
Sherlock didn’t know whether John meant it as a description: ‘I’m always forgiving you when you turn our kitchen into a biohazard, when you steal my laptop, and when you get us into a hostage situation in lieu of grocery shopping,’ or as a promise: ‘I will always forgive you,’ which caused him to feel a brief tightening in his chest. He didn’t have time to decide, because in the next moment John looked back at Sherlock, focusing brightly on his face and saying in a clearer, more present voice, “So what’s open at this hour?”
Sherlock looked puzzled for an instant—perhaps at John’s tone or perhaps at the question—but it faded quickly. He glanced down John’s body and up again. It was all John could do to keep still while the detective’s penetrating eyes raked over him, reading god-knew-what from the thin material of his clothes, his skin. Sherlock stepped forward, ducking his head to kiss him. But John grabbed a fistful of his coat and thrust him back, holding him at arm’s length.
The first door he came upon was slightly open, but a padlocked chain barred it. He glanced down. There was a cut chain lying in the dirt. Had Sherlock cut the it? Had someone re-chained the door shut? With burning veins John stepped back and scanned the building.
Flipping his dressing gown back as dramatically as one can manoeuvre a dressing gown, Sherlock sat down in front of his laptop and retried the purchase, this time using Mycroft’s credit card information. It worked.
average.” He dropped the tea bags into the mugs as if to punctuate this point. “I don’t know what you were expecting having me back here, but I’m still a goldfish, and I won’t be any less boring than I was the last time.”
Because he was there, standing in the doorway with a duffel bag across his shoulder and a suitcase at his side, and that’s what he did say.
, John thought.
“Don't be ridiculous, Mycroft; I would never accuse you of having a heart.”
. It was incredible people were stupid enough not to understand the obvious truth: All lives end. All hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage.
Sherlock swallowed, shutting his eyes. Ah yes, the reason his desk was currently underwater in his study and there were rapids in the hallways. John. The inopportune, heart-quickening aesthetics of John in the dark of the room, the soft glow of streetlamps, the sturdy lines of torso beneath light t-shirt, the smooth planes of his face.
“No.” Sherlock said firmly, needing John to believe him because it was true. “I was looking for his supply, not him. If I had thought there was any real probability of encountering him I wouldn’t have gone alone, and especially not unarmed. It was”—Sherlock wrinkled his nose in distaste—“a coincidence.”
"Why would I reconsider my marriage?"
In the past John’s presence had been enough to stave off any lingering temptation the idea of synthetic supplements might offer. He didn’t need chemicals when he had his blogger, through the cases and in between. But things were different since he’d come back to London from his previous mission. John didn’t live here anymore. And now—now there wasn’t any question about what was necessary. Because he knew what it meant to say goodbye to John. He’d done it once before. And he wouldn’t—he couldn’t do it again. At least not sober.
The lackey shrugged. “It could be my name. It’s a very ordinary name.”
“No, Sherlock, I told you I won’t have sex with her. I won’t—”
As he’d expected, there was a considerable backlog of Sherlock’s clothes to be picked up. They were delighted to see him when he walked in.
“What?”
Sherlock paced Mycroft’s obnoxiously posh flat as he worked his way through his third cigarette. It had taken two before his hands stopped shaking. He didn’t bother opening the window. Mycroft was a prat; he deserved whatever smoke fumes he got.
Sherlock looked up at him, laptop screen illuminating his features.
“No hat,” Sherlock muttered.
Sherlock’s efforts, was exactly what Sherlock hadn’t dared to hope for.
Breathing hard he tried to steady his thoughts. This was everything he’d ever wanted. He had it here, now, wide-eyed underneath him, but still he had to know why—
Sherlock laughed and stopped and turned to face John. The cool night air intensified the heady rush coursing through him: endorphins flooding in the wake of adrenaline. God, he had almost shot the explosive vest, taking the building and everyone down in one rhapsodic wave of destruction. What fun. John’s flushed face mirrored Sherlock’s own high, and he wondered how he’d ever been satisfied doing this alone.
Surprisingly he received a response just a few minutes later.
“Because you are everything to me.”
As much as he hated to give his addict (or, what was it Sherlock had called it? 'Occasional user’) brother a drug like morphine, he felt he’d made the right decision. In this circumstance it was undoubtedly preferable to have Sherlock sedated in a controlled environment than it was to leave him up to his own devices.
“It worked,” John returned.
“Don’t talk,” John reprimanded.
“The leads? You said you had leads.”
Nathan nodded. "That is good."
“I believe Mary said she’d take him back to her place. She is a nurse, among other things. She’ll see to his recovery.”
Sherlock didn’t appear to acknowledge the comment except for his eyes—they blinked a few times rapidly and Lestrade knew he’d heard it.
"Oh, Sherlock, I'm sorry, love, how was I to know you two would be up here…
John checked his watch. They were to meet Mrs. Hudson downstairs in twenty minutes. “Do you want a drink?”
The on-call nightshift men of MI6 were no strangers to unusual requests at all odd hours of the night. They were unfailingly reliable and incorruptibly trustworthy. This would not be the first or last time they moved dead weight.
“Yes, John, you’re much cleverer today than usual.”
Sherlock was as strong as any man, stronger even, sure, but he was graceful; he was antisocial, but fashionable and cultured; genius, but entirely impractical; domineering, but helpless in so many ways… John remembered the flutter of fondness in his chest the first time Sherlock had called him from the hallway: “John! What’s it doing?” he had asked blinking with large eyes at their washing machine. John had to reset the machine to clear all of the buttons Sherlock had pushed. He remembered Harry’s words to him at the café not so long ago. Perhaps she had had a point…
“The whole operation was clearly orchestrated by powerful people with resources. They were able to arrange a stabbing, a burglary, and have a car run off the road. The only problem was that Parker’s body was sent to the same funeral home as Riley and Elliot’s. The killer couldn’t have foreseen the coincidence. Or that the embalmer would be a fan of your blog and put the two together.”
“Really?” John said when he’d finished unloading the food and walked back into the living room. “But she didn’t have scars.”
There was a silence and Sherlock listened to the waves lapping at the cliffs below. The sky was a brilliant array of warm colours but nothing was more interesting than the person sitting in front of him, sitting cross-legged with an unzipped hoodie hanging loosely off of one shoulder and his hands slowly worrying some blades of grass he’d unconsciously ripped from the ground. He was looking out over the cliffs and Sherlock watched the profile of his face. John’s face had such soft features, his rounded nose and kind eyes; nothing sharp, nothing dramatic. Women probably liked him for his honest, youthfully handsome face. He seemed built to inspire trust, and Sherlock had done everything in his power to shatter it. Now he waited, one more time, as always, for his friend’s forgiveness.
“Give me the victim’s name and address,” Sherlock said. “Need to have a look at his flat.”
Sherlock was watching him as he ran his thumb over his cheekbone—delicate bone structure—wishing there was a way he could tell Sherlock how beautiful he was without having to use anything as clumsy as language.
“I suppose you have no idea how many nights I laid awake trying to think of what I should have said to you in that two-minute phone call,” John said. “How many arguments I put together… carefully constructed sentences, perfected word choice… Which words would have saved you? In what order?”
“Might have to remember that one for my blog,” John said mirthfully. “'Scotland Yard baffled, calls in Mr. Sulky.’”
“Which explains why he has scars but no poison.” Sherlock liked watching the moment John twigged. His blogger was just as eager as he was to find the puzzle pieces that fit together. And though it always happened for him a bit later than it did for Sherlock, he still enjoyed seeing the energy thrum though him at the moment of comprehension.
And then he’d met John Watson.
in his entire life he’d never had a kiss like that (only kissing Sherlock the other day in the kitchen could rival it). He should have known tapping into an emotional side of Sherlock would be as explosive and dangerous as any other side.
John stepped forward to fill the space Sherlock had made when he'd stepped back. He took Sherlock's right hand with his left and he wrapped his right hand around to Sherlock's back. The spot was warm from where John's hand had been before, and he felt the heat of his palm again through the thin material of his shirt. The music was still playing and Sherlock counted, "One, two, three."
Sherlock had told him once. No, they would still play the game; that wouldn’t change. In fact, there might even be little visible difference to those who knew them. Because they were right; they were all right: Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Sally, Irene Adler, all of his girlfriends, even Moriarty and Magnussen and Moran. He was Sherlock’s boyfriend. He’d been Sherlock’s boyfriend since the night they’d run through the alleys after the serial killer cabbie, forgetting his pain, his loneliness, his past, as Sherlock pulled him into his world and asked him, without ever asking him, to stay.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, typing on his phone. “I just need to make a call.”
Sherlock’s eyes swept the Ikea-laden room as he and John sat on a fading green couch. Sherlock checked off the deductions in his mind.
“Right, erm, you should rest. Take my bed; it’ll be more convenient on the main floor.”
He refocused. “Take a look at this,” he said, pulling the page he’d memorised from his pocket. He handed it to John. “Mycroft says there’s an answer here.”
“Dej mi další podložní sklíčko,” Sherlock snapped, repeating what he’d said the first time.
; John, waltzing, hand on his back; John, drunk, hand on his knee:
Sherlock started when he found John standing at his side. “It’s not quite as moving when he says it with the ducky hat on, is it?”
John stood up from the bed and took the paper. “It’s a poem,” he said with some surprise.
This was right, exactly right, and his body only confirmed it as his nerves sang with every touch that burned in the best way. It made sense. They fit together. They balanced each other. They could push each other as easily as they could restrain each other. They could get through to each other when no one else could. They needed each other. John could see it now in Sherlock’s eyes as he ran his hands over his flatmate’s bare chest: the hazy, needy, heart-wrenchingly clear want that had him more aroused than he’d ever been. He was going to give Sherlock everything he wanted and more. Always, he hoped. He hoped he would always be able to give Sherlock everything. Because he fully intended to spend the rest of his life trying.
John scoffed, “Yeah, once or twice—”
John quirked his eyebrow. “You were dead set against tea a minute ago.”
The kiss from the alley flashed his mind, sending a wave of heat out through his muscles. Sherlock had only done it to prove a theory. But when John gripped his wrist hadn’t he felt the detective’s pulse quick beneath the delicate skin? John willed the memory back to him. Yes, he was positive: it was quicker than it should have been considering they’d only been walking. John hadn’t registered it at the time (too overwhelmed by being kissed without warning by Sherlock Holmes in an alley), but his subconscious must have recorded it, because the sensory memory came back now in full: Sherlock’s pulse beating fast and hard against John’s hand as he was pressing John’s shoulders into the wall and kissing him. John felt his heartrate increase now in equal measure.
“I have
“You’ve lost your sheep.”
The detective leaned against the doorframe.
His flatmate blinked at him. “No, nothing. Waste of time. Why, erm, why are you…” he gestured at John’s attire.
"Pleased to meet you," John said, taking the hand of a woman who looked to be about the same age as Mrs. Hudson.
So Sherlock had accepted the marriage as necessary, although he didn’t like it. He didn’t like it because it meant that John wouldn’t be around all the time to talk to him and to wear jumpers and drink tea and make him laugh about things it never would have occurred to him to laugh about. In his entire life he’d never found anyone’s company tolerable, let alone desirable, until John. But he knew he couldn’t keep him. He had nothing to offer John besides cases and crime and danger, and while this had always been enough for him, he knew John needed more.
Did John remember the moment? Of course he must; it couldn't be a coincidence. A thought struck Sherlock and his eyes perused John's face in attempt to confirm it. Did John record information about him the same way he did about John? One thing he’d eaten voluntarily and John had remembered it all this time. Was John quietly cataloguing his food preferences? And using the information to manipulate him into eating more, as John, ever the good doctor, was always insisting he do?
Silence.
For god's sake, you would think they tumbled through doors groping each other by the way people reacted.
John scoffed. "Yeah, maybe everyone who went to public school…" He trailed off looking up at Sherlock, who was standing directly above him. "What?"
John's eyes snapped open. Hot embarrassment shocked through him as the situation crystallised from soft, dream-infused nonsense to tactile reality. Cuddling. Sherlock Holmes. His brain scrambled to make sense of the inflow of stimuli.
Sherlock looked up at the doctor and Lestrade caught a smile on the detective’s face before he turned his head back toward the body.
John had stood up from the stool, catching Sherlock's arm to steady himself. Mrs. Hudson had smiled at how readily the two of them depended on each other, leaned on each other…
“No,” Mycroft said significantly, “it’s not.”
After brushing his teeth in a kind of dazed, overslept way in the half bath across from his bedroom, he made his way down the stairs and found the flat empty. He checked his phone, no messages. He didn’t have the energy to guess where Sherlock had gone or what he was up to. He decided a shower would clear the fog from his mind. He had only just finished dressing afterward, and was putting the kettle on, when Mrs. Hudson burst through the door.
Pause.
"I am relaxed." John squirmed.
They reached the car park and it occurred to Sherlock to mention, “Someone ransacked the flat while we were away.”
Pause.
Sherlock briefly returned the smile before looking back to his music.
Sherlock was coughing, gasping, struggling to sit up, and John was at his side in an instant. He knelt to prop Sherlock up, allowing him to lean against him to support his weight. John ran his hands over Sherlock’s neck, thumbs brushing over his hyoid and trachea, fingers pushing gently into his cervical vertebrae. He breathed in relief at feeling nothing broken, but remained grimly aware of the serious bruises that would already be forming fast beneath porcelain skin.
Or perhaps Mycroft was just delighted to maintain such a direct system for keeping tabs on him.
Suddenly feeling restless and too hot, John shut his laptop and stood up from his chair. He’d almost forgotten about the lie. The story Mycroft invented and John had relayed: A witness protection program in America…
She wasn’t listening. “You’re quite tall,” she grinned at Sherlock, reaching out to touch his knee. He jerked it back.
"I work at—" she started.
“What are you—”
There were multiple other doors in the building but he wagered they would be locked. Also, he was not optimistic about his ability to outrun anybody in his current state. Running wasn’t an option; fighting didn’t seem to be one either. His muscles were practically useless at this point. He briefly wondered if he should just allow the man to kill him and save some dignity in the process. But he supposed John would never forgive him for that.
“Clever cop,” she said, raising herself up off of his lap.
“Out!”
Sherlock didn’t miss a beat. “Your father was an idiot.”
John rolled his eyes. No, she didn’t do any of those things. She didn’t even
"This is fine for a beginner's waltz."
Sherlock looked up at John, who was hovering between the kitchen and living room.
“Worse,” John agreed, “but probably not weirder.”
want, Sherlock? That’s what you meant. That’s what this is all about. You’re weak, Sherlock Holmes. You want him.”
“Don’t get your knickers up your arse; I'll pay it,” John said, easing Sherlock into the cab. “221B, Baker Street.”
“Where are we going?” John asked him.
Sherlock Holmes straightened his jacket, leaned up, and tucked the note into the band of the stripper’s thong. The people around the stage whistled and clapped and she moved on to the next group.
John breathed slowly in an effort to calm himself and was surprised to find Sherlock's scent—something he'd been unaware of in sleep and too shocked to notice until now—was doing just that: quieting the frantic buzz of
He was so dizzy it was hard to see. He just needed to sleep. Sherlock’s wiry arms were around him—the lean strength of the detective’s body—it was comforting, like something he’d wanted all along.
John to do things, Mary. He makes his own choices.” Sherlock had learned this in Ireland, and he’d had the bruises to prove it.
He lay back on top of the bookcase, holding the wet book to his chest. He could wake up now, but he didn’t want to.
why one needs one’s blogger.”
John was satisfied with his decision to leave. Things had changed since they’d been flatmates the first time around, and he was determined to prove that despite having left Mary, Sherlock would not be the only thing in his life now. He was not a shadow on the periphery of Sherlock’s awareness waiting to be called into focus. He was an independent person, capable of doing and enjoying things that had nothing at all to do with Sherlock. And if Sherlock thought John was so enamoured with him that he’d just be sitting on the front step of 221B waiting for him to come home—
His eyes were heavy but he was prying them up. Blurring, blurry, sharpening image: Sherlock. Not a child. His eyes were shut but his arm was around him and John’s hand was tangled in the back of his hair, like it had been a moment ago in the garden. The warmth he’d felt had been real. Sherlock was here, lying in his hospital bed, holding him, radiating body heat.
John groaned, "
“He'll be released tomorrow.”
After a moment Sherlock sat up. His curls were hopelessly tousled.
"I thought you said he was dead."
“John!” Mrs. Hudson breathed. “That temper of yours! You really ought to see someone about it. My friend Rose goes in for anger management groups; I could ask her for the information if you want. She’s been going every week since she ran her husband down with the car. He’s all right now, thank god, but—”
John didn’t bother wondering how Mycroft already knew he’d moved back. He searched Mycroft’s expression for any judgment about his marriage having gone up in flames, but Mycroft’s grey eyes were as icy and stoic as ever. There was probably no one he knew who cared less about his relationship with Mary than Mycroft Holmes. It was refreshing.
John breathed. Sherlock wasn’t poisoned. He was.
“I know, but—”
John scowled. “Thank you.”
Sherlock turned in his chair to face John. "Either directly or indirectly, yes. The pattern of scarring is too unusual. It would be a considerable coincidence if it was entirely unrelated to his murder."
“You want to check Bauer.”
Sherlock leapt off the bed and groped around the floor for his shoes. Images of a flatlining monitor, nurses pulling him off the bed and trying to restart John’s heart, Mycroft barking orders for Sherlock to be sent home—Sherlock nearly choked, bile threatening to surge upward from his stomach.
“In that case I believe I know. Thank you for your call, Miss Hooper. I’ll look into the matter.”
Sherlock looked up. “No, it’s not in
John lifted his eyebrows at the redirection. “Oh,” he said. “Well, that’s… good.”
"He's teaching me to waltz," John said hastily. "For my wedding."
John shouted back into the fog. He wished she would leave. He wished she would shut up.
Undernutrition. Overdose. Collapse. They had treated him immediately and Mycroft had waited by his side. He’d done it once before. Six years ago. Sherlock had overdosed on heroin. A detective inspector from Scotland Yard had brought him to the hospital and Mycroft had sat by his bed all night, only getting up to leave sometime mid-morning as Sherlock woke.
And John had chosen that moment—as opposed to a much more convenient two minutes prior—to lie down on the bed and pass out.
Sherlock braced him, eyes flashing over his body. “Are you ok?”
“Quite.”
For a minute they only breathed together, Sherlock’s weight pressing heavily into him, and John felt his adrenaline seeping away, down into the ground, as his muscles relaxed.
“Precisely.”
“I am human, Sherlock; I am capable of tears. No, try again.”
He breathed to calm himself and reached for Sherlock’s left hand with his right. Sherlock intertwined their fingers, locking their hands together. John felt a slight tingling where the recently healed cut in his palm was pressing against Sherlock’s: Mirror image scars that were neither the first to mark their skin nor would they be the last—the latest in the lines of silver thread that wove them together, visual evidence of the damage that connected them, deep and permanent.
John glared. “Yes. I wrote it in my calendar: ‘Saturday: sit.’”
Sherlock stared at the page in amazement. His infuriating older brother had anticipated everything. He had been at the hospital. He’d known. He’d seen exactly how it would play out with John, right up to Sherlock being here, looking for cigarettes, and searching his desk before the bookcase. It was only at times when he was forced to interact with Mycroft that Sherlock got the smallest glimpse of why ordinary people hated him so vehemently.
him. ‘Sherlock Holmes’ was only a synonym for ‘consulting detective.’ If he allowed emotion to flood his mind palace, he wouldn’t be who he was. It had taken him nine days to notice John was poisoned because he had been distracted trying to hold back waterfalls of feelings that were threatening all the time to sweep away his identity, leave him with nothing but a headful of emotional need and sexual want. He had an addictive personality. He knew this. If he allowed himself to want John… It was doubtless the addiction would follow swift and all-consuming.
John, he knew, would attribute this behaviour to guilt—Sherlock being the indirect cause of the injury. It wouldn’t be the first time John was wrong.
“Because I don’t do bollocks like graduations and funerals and weddings, and I know I’m better out of your life than in it, but believe it or not I do care about you.”
“Mary was furious,” Molly continued. “They had to get security to escort her out.”
while his sanity had apparently gone on a fifteen minute break. He’d lost the plot: the plot in which he was a heterosexual male living with an asexual (or
Of course he knew John liked danger, had needed it even, but how long could that possibly last? With a few years’ hiatus—without Sherlock monopolising his time—John would be able to clearly assess his other options. By the time Sherlock arrived back in London (assuming he wasn’t killed in action) John would have stabilised enough in his new life to make an informed decision about how much time he wanted to devote to Sherlock and his work and his danger. With enough distance and the option for a different life, surely John wouldn’t choose Sherlock. (Would he?)
information about his investigations”—the elder Holmes shot Lestrade a look that nearly made him jump—“should you continue to use illegal substances.”
Sherlock blinked, unresponsive as though he didn’t understand.
But the house was different than when he’d seen it last. The windows were black. There was no doorknob on the front door. John walked the perimeter of the house looking for a way in. But when he reached the back garden he understood that what his mind wanted him to see was not inside the house.
John was falling and Sherlock caught him but it didn’t seem to matter how tightly he held him because John was still falling.
Sherlock chucked his phone into the couch. He knew the price for using Mycroft’s money was his brother’s prying, but he needed these chemicals. London had been dismally quiet since the obscure “Did you miss me?” message almost a year ago. There had been a handful of cases interesting enough since then to keep him sane (see Blog, Dr. Watson), but that message… It had saved his life, pulling him back from what would have been a suicide mission, and initially it had been so promising. The promise of intrigue, thrill, a distraction, a
The experiment was necessary, he believed, because John was too close to him. Sherlock had never been a constant presence in anyone’s life before. Based on his peers’ reaction to his presence for even short durations he concluded that prolonged exposure to him must be significantly detrimental. And he needed to know. He wanted evidence—measurements, exact numbers—that could tell him how adverse his presence in John’s life had been, and how much John’s life would be improved without it.
"Just think about it, dear. Be certain. That's all I'll say on the subject. If you choose to marry her you'll have nothing but my warmest wishes and total support."
Sherlock grinned. “True.”
When John finally lay down on the spare bed it was not as terrible as he’d imagined. He stretched his aching muscles. Sherlock rose from the bigger bed and paused. “You’re not going to take my bed while I’m gone?”
“Not exactly. But I remember the name. It was called Monroe’s. Do you want me to write it down?”
). He smiled when Sherlock played Mozart, and closed his eyes listening to Brahms and Schumann. He put his reading down completely for Bach.
“I met him on the stairs on his way out. He was in a hurry as usual.”
Sherlock could practically hear John’s embarrassed silence through the door before Mrs. Hudson continued, “Do you think Sherlock knows how lucky it is for him that he’s so pretty?”
From the infamous Angelo’s conversation he had gathered that Sherlock was gay, but not interested in dating (girlfriends were ‘not his area,’ but he simply said ‘no’ when John asked if he had a boyfriend). But after living with him for some time John had changed his opinion to believe his flatmate was more likely asexual. His antisocial dislike of all people, regardless of gender, combined with his contempt for sentimental emotion seemed to preclude the possibility for any kind of romantic interest. Perhaps his meticulous attention to his appearance was only part of his sardonic streak—to make himself as attractive as possible while knowing he would never return the interest.
“You have no idea,” John growled.
Without thinking John crossed the room and grabbed Sherlock’s slender wrist. Seemingly stunned, Sherlock followed as John guided him to the couch. John pushed him down onto it and found his pen light on the table.
The club was an enormous space, darkly lit and alternatingly illuminated by neon lights. A sleek, modern bar stretched almost the length of the place. Dotting the area were circular platforms featuring silver poles. They served as miniature stages for the strippers, who, topless, were performing their routines to their respective audiences: a ring of chairs around each stage filled with hollering, note-waving revellers.
“Hello to you too.” Lestrade crossed his arms over his chest indignantly.
Sherlock whirled around and found Mycroft standing in the doorway sporting a similar pair of black wellies.
John ran his eyes over the detective, his flatmate, Sherlock, the most important person in the universe. He had gone back to John’s dog tags and John felt like something was breaking inside of him as he watched Sherlock play with them, feeling his trust in the weight of his body as he allowed John to fully support him.
Sherlock watched John half-sleepwalk (fully sleepwalk?) up to his bedroom and remained standing in the living room after he’d gone.
Tony arrived back a moment later carrying a purple jumper. “This is probably what she’s looking for. Left it here last week.”
he’d been stupid. The dream, the overdose—he’d missed everything of importance.
“So what if I had wanted to come with you? I always come with you on cases.”
"We'll wait until the beat comes around… One, two, three… No, your
John wondered.
“Gave him a list of places,” Billy continued. “Told me today he didn’t find what he needed though. He only had three places left on the list so I doubt he’s going to find what he wants. I told him you can’t be too picky. You got to take what you can get, innit? There’s plenty of quality stuff around—”
“Billy,” Sherlock barked into his phone in the back of the cab. “Meet me at the lab. Now. Bring an eight ball of coke. At least.”
Sherlock swung the door shut behind her.
John snickered, “Not
“Sherlock,” John said, never more certain about anything in his entire life, “I will never leave you. Not if I have a choice.”
Sherlock glared to his left at the skull perched on his stack of
“And we need anything she can tell us about Karina.”
Sherlock was digging in his pocket and when John looked up again he was holding out the small container he’d seen in Alexa’s room.
John blinked at it. “You stole her lipstick?”
He dropped his hand and bit his lip. Shirtless, Sherlock’s pale skin looked vulnerable in the dark. John traced his eyes down over the damaged neck, the syringe puncture at his collar bone, the bullet wound in his chest— He was surprised when he felt Sherlock’s hand on his left shoulder. John was wearing his t-shirt but Sherlock was touching the exact spot where his own bullet wound was.
John shook his head, smiling at the ground. Only Sherlock could be endearingly blithe when discussing chopping up bodies.
“Have a seat, Mr. Holmes,” Moran said lightly, as though they were standing in the waiting room of his clinic. “I’ll be with you in a moment.”
“Why would we do that?” Sherlock's tone meant he already knew the answer.
“Yeah,” John bit back, “I told them to go ahead and start without me.”
John sitting next to him in a cab, head turned to look at him, eyes filled with amazement; John giggling,
John was asleep, and Mary sat anxiously by the side of his bed. Her name might have been removed from the list of visitors approved to say after nine p.m. (Sherlock’s doing, no doubt), but it was midday on Wednesday, regular visiting hours, and she was resolved to stay until 8:59.
She waited for a response. Receiving none she went on. "It's true I read Dr. Watson's blog.” Her blush faintly reappeared. "I couldn't help thinking this was something you might be interested in..."
"Does one activity negate the other?"
Dizzy, John tried to keep his thoughts from spiralling. What was it about Sherlock’s expression that was bothering him? It was panic. John had seen it on Sherlock before but never when Sherlock’s own death was imminent—not in the times he had faced Moriarty and never when a gun was pointed in his face. No, Sherlock didn’t look like that when confronted with death. But he
John: His companion, his Boswell, his closest friend (
he asked as he hit 'send.'
Sherlock wondered if he could put enough pressure on the right people to get Mycroft transferred to Siberia.
Dinner was an unremarkable affair. They made the typical small talk about work. They’d met when they were working at the same surgery several years ago. But now (thankfully) they were at different locations. They smiled a bit, exchanging stories about patients.
Molly didn’t look back as the door swung shut behind them. John and Mary were divorced? How? When? Why? And more importantly, what did that mean for Sherlock?
He guided John into the room by his wrist and let him go. But that wasn’t the end of it. John remembered he had sat down on the bed, undoing his shoes.
“You pulled your punch.” Sherlock’s voice broke through John’s thoughts. His flatmate was looking at him with some amusement in his eyes.
“Thanks, Billy,” John kept his voice cordial though he would have liked to bash the junkie’s face into a concrete wall for being such a lousy
John met Sherlock’s eyes. “Extraordinary.”
John grinned. Sometimes Sherlock reminded him of a printer. If you send a request to a printer while it’s busy, the request waits in queue and is processed only after the previous task is complete. Sherlock, he knew, would not be too keen on this metaphor, which was why he’d kept it out of his blog so far. A supercomputer, maybe, but a printer… probably not.
“Besides the two of them there’s no apparent connection among the victims.” Sherlock leaned forward, balancing his elbows on his knees and steepling his fingers together. “Their deaths all look like isolated incidents, and whoever killed them wanted to keep it that way. But there must be something that links them. In order for all four men, if we include Bauer, to receive such similar scars they must have seen the same person, or people. However, my research shows they had no mutual work, family, or friends. What else connects complete strangers?”
Sherlock crossed the room in a few strides and stopped directly in front of John, towering over him and glaring. Sherlock, John had understood from the day they’d met, had little concept of personal space and often stood inappropriately close for an Englishman. But John, used to this, met Sherlock’s gaze easily and held his ground.
He was stunned by the feeling. He wanted—needed—more. John was looking at him, dark blue eyes beneath blond fringe. He was here, truly present the way he hadn’t been when he was dividing his time to be with Mary. There was nothing between them now and yet he wasn’t close enough.
And he did.
John was kissing him slowly, deeply, intensely, and Sherlock felt warmth spreading from his core out through the rest of his body. He held the back of John’s head. His hair was cold and damp from the shower: a pleasing contrast to the heat of his skin. He wrapped his arm around John’s back, feeling the energy in the tension of his muscles, smooth in their movement beneath his hand.
“221B, Baker Street,” Sherlock said to the driver when John shut the door behind them. He turned to John. “You’ve thought about that blog title before. You didn’t just come up with it now.”
“Hey!”
“Just now.”
“I assume you’ve done it before.”
The time was almost ten, and the club was in full swing. It was crowded. The majority of the patrons were men, although John spotted a few women here and there, and one particularly conspicuous group of women surrounding a platform, shrieking and cheering.
John kept his door ajar and it was easy to push it open. From his position in the doorway he could see John tossing and turning, muttering incoherently, hands working, jaw clenching. But Sherlock never woke him. He knew John would be embarrassed, like the first night. So instead Sherlock waited, watching, muscles tensed, standing by in case… In case what? He didn’t know. But he stayed anyway, ducking back away from the door if John woke up or eventually turning away after John stilled and his breathing steadied.
and you can’t think of anything to do with your time? Why don’t you go out and win the Nobel Prize, or break the boundaries of human knowledge with string theory? I don’t know; why don’t you invent a bloody cure for cancer? There must be a better use of your talents than lying around here and whinging at me all the time. …You total prat,” he added for emphasis.
John had taken care of their finances when they’d lived together. John had, apparently—Sherlock hadn’t paid much attention—handled the payments from their clients and deposited them (presumably) fairly into their respective bank accounts. Sherlock would have assumed John had been ripping him off for years (and rightly so, if one couldn’t be bothered to monitor one’s accounts one perhaps deserved a bit of ripping off) if Sherlock hadn’t known John to be so incorrigibly Upright and Moral. Shame about that. Inflexibility is limiting, after all.
“Come on,” he growled, the frustration of breaking off the kiss scraping his voice course.
He paused in front of the correct door this time. The last patient of the day. He would have to go home afterwards. He took a deep breath. He had forgiven Sherlock for so many things; he hoped Sherlock could forgive him for this.
The East Wind was a force that ripped through the Earth, destroying everything in its path and flinging people into oblivion.
He was back, and now John was back too—with the divorce papers signed he was
“It was my pleasure.”
Mycroft stopped at the door and turned. “‘Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on.’ The world goes on, Sherlock.”
must be worse than dying, because dying has an end.
Sherlock smirked harder. “Very noble of you to defend my honour.”
Sherlock smirked. “Was that you being chivalrous?”
kiss each other. Except when Sherlock needed to test a method of drug transmission for a case. Then apparently it was all right.
John pushed aside Sherlock’s unbuttoned coat and reached into the inner pocket of his jacket. It never seemed to occur to Sherlock how intimate it was: the way he was always asking John to get things from his pockets.
“So what now?”
“Berlin isn’t far,” John couldn’t let the point go unremarked. “It’s not far at all.”
“Forgive me?” Sherlock asked, stuffing his hands into the front pockets of his trousers and posing two questions at once.
“What does that mean?”
“Crucial, yes crucial,” Sherlock muttered dismissively, using his phone again to record the numbers. “Keep your arm still.”
The detective raised himself up a bit, peered around the edge of the stone, and sank back down.
“I can’t believe I can no longer say I’ve never kissed a man,” John said with some astonishment, half to himself.
From the window Sherlock watched John get into a cab and drive off. He dropped the curtain back into place and pulled out his phone. He still had three more locations on his list that could be used to store a large shipment of drugs, and he fully intended to check them all.
“John, leave.”
cemetery. It’s very convenient to own a cemetery when you have a body to get rid of. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest.”
Something flickered in Sherlock’s eyes. “Suit yourself.”
“He was arrested ten years ago in connection with a case Sherlock was able to assist Scotland Yard with. Reeves wasn’t the man they were looking for, more like a smaller fish caught in the net with the larger one. He was sentenced to life in prison but it appears an interested party has been able to negotiate parole for him.”
He ran his eyes over John’s sleeping form. Fascinating. A soldier who regularly faced murderers unflinching, yet was wrecked by the shadows of his mind. An enigma: the real danger invigorating, the unreal debilitating.
John closed his eyes, replaying the dream-sequence from the garden and seeing Sherlock as his brain had imagined him. He was so young. Why? He thought for a moment and it occurred to him that the answer might be quite simple. Sherlock had to be a child in the dream because John was incapable of imagining the adult Sherlock saying any such things. The child could be vulnerable—the child could say what the adult couldn’t.
He examined his flatmate. John’s breathing was still slightly rapid, though returning to normal. His hair was sticking out in odd places from the pillow, fair enough to look almost silver in the pale light. Callous wasn’t an option.
Sherlock threw a glare at him.
Sherlock said slowly, staring at the results on the screen in front of him as they blurred in and out of focus. “
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath as he felt the liquid burn through his veins.
“Yeah,” John said out loud, “that’s it. I’m done.”
She took a breath. “If you loved him, it wouldn’t mean you’re gay.”
here for three days now and I think he’s in trouble.”
What had Sherlock’s expression been? Had he rolled his eyes? Been irritated? No, John didn’t think so. He’d been amused, hadn’t he? Trying to stifle a smile—
“You think it was Moriarty.”
John knew he should ignore it. He knew from experience that any words at this point would provoke an attack. However, he really wasn’t in a pacifying mood. The break up with Emily was still fresh from the morning, and the reason she’d dumped him was petulantly stomping around the flat trying to make John as miserable as he was. So a fight had sounded pretty good right about then.
The plan had required him to call John to ensure John saw him fall, and to keep him in place. But from John’s perspective… He’d never even considered it from John’s perspective.
He recognised Moran from the search he’d done. One of England’s leading psychologists, exclusive therapy clinic, patient roster blocked. The waiting list was a year long to get a timeslot to see him, and the fee was astronomical.
“We believe the poison was administered on the night of Friday, October ninth.”
,” John said, bemused.
“Why? What does Tony Bauer’s blood have to do with the Rodgers case? And what about his accusation that you ordered him to pull down his trousers in order to take a picture of his—”
“Can’t say without further data. Need the autopsy report at the very least. Send it to me as soon as you get it along with photos of the body.”
He walked slowly through the first row of cars, observing where the cameras were just out of the corner of his eye. He wove through the row and stepped behind a pillar. A blind spot. There was no camera facing his direction. He could get Moran as he came through the door. He checked his watch. Seven o’clock. Moran’s last appointment would just be ending. He was proud of himself for having gotten so far without the genius of deduction at his side, though he wished Sherlock were with him anyway.
“I suppose you’re high now too?” John asked, coming to stand next to him.
“Now,” she said, moving closer to Sherlock. She put one foot on the edge of his chair and he had to tilt his head back to see her face. “What do you want to talk about?”
“Look at these!” John said. “Look at them!”
“I thought we might get to know each other a bit first,” Sherlock said, eyes boring through her. John knew he was ascertaining as many deductions about her as possible. The detective leaned back in his chair, crossing one leg over the other. “Tell us something about you.”
She turned on her heel and went back to the drawers.
“Beautiful,” came an amazed voice from the door.
They had walked a few blocks out onto a main road and Sherlock raised his hand to signal a cab.
“Ex-girlfriend?”
“Yeah, all right,” John said, taking the envelope and standing.
But what did it mean? Was it a spontaneous, impulsive display of affection, never to be repeated? Did Sherlock want it to be repeated?
“You haven’t been listening,” Sherlock growled, grabbing John’s right arm and jerking him towards him. “I told you I fixed it.”
“It’s Saturday. You promised we’d spend the day together.”
“Oh, really?” John shot back, standing up from his chair to let his anger radiate further.
John put a hand on his shoulder and Sherlock turned toward him. “You can fix this,” he said.
He walked around to the other side of the bed, shrugging off his jacket and pulling the dog tags over his head. He sat down on the edge of the bed, undoing his boots, slightly amazed to think the night had started off as innocuously as dressing up to go to a work party. But that was life with Sherlock.
“I missed you,” Sherlock said, voice low, and he watched John’s pupils dilate at the sound.
John had rolled onto his right side and Sherlock rolled to his left so they were facing each other. John moved closer and put his left arm around him. He was warm; Sherlock could feel his body heat. He slid lower, and tucked his face into the base of John's throat. John tightened his hold, and as though it were natural, a repeated action and not a new one, Sherlock slipped his knee between John's thighs. Warmth; muscles generate heat.
More than a little irked, Sherlock reminded him, “Unless the problem was whether to prattle prosaically or babble senselessly, I didn’t hear a dilemma in any of that.”
Unbidden, a memory of Irene Adler in the abandoned Battersea power station appeared in his mind.
If John had been on his game before, with Sherlock’s eyes burning into his back he was a force to be reckoned with. He hadn’t heard from the detective since the
“I suppose this means you have a better plan than the dinner date?”
John crossed from the window to sit down in his chair. He would have to think like Sherlock if he was going to figure this one out.
John pulled the sheets from the envelope and read out the relevant information. David Rodgers, thirty-five years old, lawyer: successful enough to afford a flat close to the park in Knightsbridge (the direction their cab was currently headed), unmarried, no children, no history of medical problems, no criminal record, nothing remarkable in his background that would make him a target for murder.
had he? He'd gone from fast asleep to striding off in an instant. There were no in-between moments with Sherlock. It was just as well, John supposed, because if he had noticed the row might have ended with him looking for a new flat.
Dully he was aware of movement on the other side of his consciousness. The bed dipping: John getting up. Footsteps: John leaving.
“We’ll have to move him for rounds in an hour,” the nurse said to Mycroft, looking sceptically at the extra body in her patient’s bed.
Unfortunately for this plan, John heard fast footsteps coming up behind him and he’d barely had a moment to groan inwardly before a hand was on his upper arm arresting his movement and spinning him around.
Moran’s eyes roved across Sherlock’s face. “You
“John, I’m sorry. I should have been faster; I should have known sooner. I don’t deserve to have you back but I’m asking you to come back anyway because I’m spoilt and selfish and I need you. There. I’ve said it. I need you. I’m sure it was obvious anyway but now I’ve said it. So...”
“I could give you a note on your bedside manner,” Sherlock said, deep voice purring in his chest.
problem, you know.”
Lestrade put his hands on his hips. “You can either tell me here, now, why you were harassing Tony and Kathleen Bauer tonight, or we can go to Scotland Yard and you can tell another officer who won’t have my talent for being patient with you.”
“He asked for them, innit.”
When Mycroft was fifteen there was a girl.
you didn’t—”
“He’s fascinating,” John breathed.
Breathing heavily, eyes locked together, neither one moved.
Possibly Sherlock didn’t hear it. “We’re running out of time,” he said. “His sister could call him any minute and mention us. She might have done it already.”
“I got him to eat breakfast, but no luck with lunch,” Mrs. Hudson was saying. “And I gave him a pill at four, so don’t let him tell you otherwise.”
John stood and crossed his arms over his chest. “Well?”
The client who had dropped the information into his lap this morning had been surprisingly convenient. Too convenient to be accepted at face value, of course. The moment she mentioned the scars he’d surreptitiously sent a text to one of his homeless network who worked the Baker Street underground station and was never far off. He was waiting for the girl on the street when she left and a text confirmed he’d followed her directly to the funeral home where she worked, no deviation. Only partly satisfied Sherlock had done a quick search while John was upstairs getting dressed. It revealed Hannah Walsh had been a member of Facebook since 2008 (not a new identity) and a subscriber to John’s blog since 2010 (not a new interest).
A few days later Sherlock was looking out at the back garden and Mycroft caught tears in his eyes in the reflection of the glass door. He stepped up behind him.
“No one back at headquarters is going to believe this is anything more than a routine mugging until you prove otherwise, and no one is going to be happy about a prolonged investigation on a routine mugging.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's bloody complicated!" John huffed when he'd been corrected, yet again, about starting with his left foot.
Focus.
“Oh, Sherlock, you’re a very stupid little boy.”
Sherlock looked up from his laptop, startled. "What?"
John stalked off to the bathroom and as he brushed his teeth he wondered if there was anyone else living with such a difficult detective. He wondered if there was a support group for people living with difficult detectives.
He'd been reviewing the Rodgers case, which could now more accurately be called the Moran case. There was an entire bookcase in his study dedicated to Moriarty, and tonight he created a new shelf on it labelled 'Moran.' He had spent the last few hours sifting through his information on Moriarty looking for references to Moran, Monroe's, any connections. He found a few hints, some possibilities. He had no doubt he would tie him in with Moriarty soon enough.
John was motionless, head down.
“By making the necessary inquiries I discovered that there was one woman who had appointments with all three of our dead men on Friday, October ninth. Her name is Karina. More likely
John replied.
“Yes, dear?”
John shook his head. “I don’t want to upset you but I thought you should know.”
Sherlock breathed deeply through his nose as he realigned his concentration. He couldn’t think about endings now. They were only distraction. Now he needed to focus on the problem. The problem and the method.
“Confirmed”—he glanced at Sherlock—"I guess he chose the wrong target."
He concentrated hard. The flat. Last night. How did he end up here? He got a flash of an image. Stairs. And then… Yes, that was it. He’d fallen on the stairs leading up to the flat. He confirmed the memory by touching the bruise on his leg. The resultant dull pain brought back the memory in full.
“You didn’t lose me.”
Rendered speechless, Sherlock found his awareness narrowed to the person in front of him. Dark blue eyes watching him uncertainly beneath sandy hair. It was just a few hours before he’d been forced to consider the possibility he might never see them again. But they were open now and active, searching his face.
“Then why don’t you leave?” Sherlock hissed, close enough John could feel the warmth of his breath on his face. “Or am I the closest thing you have to feeling important?”
He heard his flatmate hum in agreement from somewhere beside him.
John reached up, gripping his jacket, and his eyes searched his face in the same expression of wonderment that had made Sherlock pull him out of the Barts lab and into his flat and into his life all those years ago.
John reminded himself sharply. The young version of Sherlock he’d met in the garden was a figment of his own imagination. It was a highly realistic figment, based on the childhood photographs he’d seen (the outfit the boy was wearing was the same one he wore in a photograph on his parents’ living room mantel, the ten-year-old glaring at the camera as though whoever touched the button would have hell to pay) and his memories of what Sherlock had told him (“Mycroft hasn’t been any fun since he gave me lasers to play with,” Sherlock had complained after one of Mycroft’s unwelcome visits to Baker Street), but it was an illusion all the same. The words the child had spoken were inventions of his own mind.
The text came through. A quick search told him the first place on the list was also the closest to Baker Street. Sherlock would probably start there.
“An existential struggle with morality?”
“Well, it was after midnight!” she said indignantly. “It must be against public ordinances to be lowering an armoire out of your window in the middle of the night.” John twisted around in his chair in time to see Sherlock’s lips twitch to a half-smile before it dropped. “I could tell they were trying to be quiet about it,” she continued, “but it’s noisy business loading furniture onto a moving van. I can’t imagine why they couldn’t wait until a proper hour.”
John was referring to Sherlock’s last serious bout of boredom when they’d lived together. It had resulted in an experiment involving the effectiveness of duct tape to gather particles (hair, fibres, dirt, dust, etc.) for forensic evidence. John had come home to find many things wrapped up in the tape, not the least of which being his laptop, all of his socks, and the couch.
John glared at his entirely unmanageable detective. He supposed he wasn't treating her any more abominably than any other client, but she was sweet, and John's more gentlemanly principles objected to Sherlock handling her as roughly as any other bloke that walked through their door.
It was hard to say who was more surprised to see the other, Sherlock Holmes or Sebastian Moran.
“Please don’t enjoy this so much.”
All had gone relatively smoothly—excluding a few outbursts: failed tests that required her to shield the equipment with her body in order to keep him from smashing it—until now.
When Sherlock cried, asking why he never survived in the stories (Mycroft took particular pleasure in thinking up new and imaginative ways for little Sherlock to die each night), he replied simply, “The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
Sherlock turned away and with a few strides he was back at his chair, dropping swiftly down into it.
John breathed. Billy said Sherlock was looking for drugs. It didn’t necessarily mean he was looking for drugs to get high, he reminded himself forcefully. It could be related to the case. Moran was involved in drug dealing. He could be investigating the drug ring connected to Moran.
Sherlock pointed to the skull on the mantelpiece. “He’s dead.”
“That was more about Mrs. Hudson, less about tea.”
Someone who was not John was in their flat. The door—left slightly ajar—said as much, and one whiff of Claire-de-la-lune on the stairs was enough to solve the mystery.
John barely had time to think as he jumped to his feet and was immediately almost knocked over again by three of his teammates and the combined force of their enthusiasm.
Sherlock, he supposed, had gone to the lab to try to find an antidote. Perhaps he would succeed. Perhaps he didn’t have to die. But hadn’t Sherlock said himself the poison’s progress was unstoppable? He knew Sherlock would do everything he could, but if there was no solution then there was no solution. He had to be prepared for that. Because Sherlock had studied the poison carefully, and of all people he was the last one to declare something ‘perfect’ if it had even the smallest flaw. And to Sherlock this poison had been perfect.
I don’t need you to—”
Sherlock quirked a brow at him.
They were doing their best to eviscerate each other with their eyes when John walked in. He cleared his throat. He was wearing jogging bottoms over his rugby shorts and a hoodie under his coat, gym bag slung over his shoulder.
“Did Karina know him?”
Sherlock was sentimental about nothing, and John supposed his virginity wouldn’t be an exception. On the other hand, while the detective was a first rate actor, John knew there were some things that couldn’t be acted. If he was as contemptuous of physical affection as he seemed, and if he was as disinterested in Janine as he proved to be while barely sparing her unconscious, injured figure a glance as he swept past her into Magnussen’s office…
“So, how about shut in a large armoire, out the window, and onto a moving van?”
"God, I feel like I'm twelve," John said, blinking away tears.
John moved quietly into Sherlock’s bedroom. He was sleeping exactly the way he’d left him, on his side with his back turned toward the door. John put his hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock let him go when they were a safe distance away and John went back to work on his buttons. He was feeling a bit numb, which was odd considering he’d only had one drink. He attributed it to the hangover that was probably still lurking beneath his consciousness.
He never told him the truth.
But John was too much the English gentlemen to say no. As he walked out onto the dance floor he silently cursed Mrs. Hudson with as many Sherlockian social catastrophes as could be pulled off in a single night.
John crossed his arms and tried not to sulk. “I was simply—”
“You requested a driver, sir?”
Um, has everyone seen this? Thank you, BBC Sherlock, for creating fan art for my story. (But seriously, it's perfect, right?)
He remembered this part clearly. Sherlock crossed the room swiftly and grabbed his arms to prevent him from tearing the shirt. With deft fingers he’d undone John’s shirt in an instant.
And Sherlock found that whenever he revisited Mendelssohn John was similarly affected. He asked who it was each time and laughed when Sherlock gave the same response. “I guess he must be my favourite then."
“Ok,” he said slowly. Patience. Always patience with Sherlock. “Is there a reason you’re awake at six o’clock in the morning and attacking my things? Or does this one get chalked up to ‘general insanity’ too?”
“Do you remember the address?”
Sure enough, opening the cover revealed a large, rectangular hole cut out from the centre of the pages, leaving only the margins intact.
If Sherlock hadn’t survived… And he shouldn’t have. A moment of weakness had prevented the direct kill shot, but still he
“It’s intricate and odd enough to make it a possibility.”
"She was worried, so I told her I'd come up to check if you were here…" she trailed off. "Should I not tell her you're here?" she asked conspiratorially.
John grabbed his wallet out of his back pocket and flipped it open. His card was gone.
his conscience
“You’re saying the stabbing didn’t kill him.” Lestrade was always hyperaware of how clueless he sounded next to Sherlock. How could John stand it all the time?
John’s adrenaline kicked into gear; his heart sped up and he tried to keep his words under control. "Because, Sherlock, I am a doctor. That's what I do. I am John Watson, Doctor of Medicine. I am not John Watson, Sherlock's
had done that to John.
“The average mind is far more simply placated than mine,” Sherlock said, voice dangerously low. “Of course it’s easier for normal people to entertain themselves; they’re like
The phone was empty; the only possible reason Sherlock could want it was sentiment.
to use it, the look he’d received had been sharp enough to slice his head off. He’d been informed, in no uncertain terms, that not to use readily available information just for the sake of not using it would be negligent and contemptible and moronic and whatever else John didn’t know because he’d already put in his earphones.
But now, he could take a week off. Why not? He would go somewhere with nice scenery to gain some perspective. He needed a reminder that the world was still a beautiful place—that the timeless perfection of nature endured unaffected by such petty human quibbles as failed marriages and assassins and difficult friendships. Yes, a holiday would do him a lot of good. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to throw Sherlock for a loop for once, by being the one to disappear wordlessly. The thought of giving Sherlock a taste of his own medicine was not the primary reason for John’s decision, but it really didn’t deter him either.
“But, what about…” Sherlock hesitated.
John guided Sherlock up the stairs to their flat and down the hallway to his bedroom. He was walking all right, but in a kind of half-asleep, half-drug-induced-trance. John pulled off Sherlock’s top layers—coat, jacket, ripped shirt—and he dropped heavily onto the bed. Sherlock pulled weakly at his belt but gave up when his numb fingers wouldn’t work the way he wanted them to. John gritted his teeth, silenced his accusatory mind-crowd, and undid his flatmate’s belt, sliding it off of him. He moved down to the shoes, unlacing them and pulling them off. Sherlock immediately curled onto his side and John pulled the blanket up over him, his hand lingering on his shoulder.
"I know."
Sherlock turned from the window as he played and John tensed, feeling as though he were intruding on something private. But Sherlock’s eyes were closed. He almost never played with his eyes closed. It occurred to John that Sherlock was feeling the music this time instead of seeing it, and the result was incredible. He couldn’t help thinking that such a performance was being wasted on him, who was hopelessly ignorant about such things—that Sherlock should be on a stage being judged by international experts, who would no doubt be impressed. But just because John couldn’t evaluate his technique didn’t mean he couldn’t appreciate the intensity of the sound enveloping him. The drama of the melody captivated him: its urgency and its insistence and its melancholy.
"What time will you be home? I'll see you when I get back from practice then, or whenever you bloody happen to come back through the door, whether it's in two hours or two weeks. Have a nice day!"
The next morning John deposited all the cheques before work. And after work, as he was walking out through the large, clear doors at the entrance to the hospital, he was hailed by Mycroft’s pretty assistant.
The first year of their cooperation was rough, however. It was more than against policy for Lestrade to consult with an amateur detective and in the beginning he’d genuinely tried not to do it. He pushed Sherlock away time and time again, even having him thrown from the building on a few of the more memorable occasions.
Sherlock sighed. “Contrary to what I’m sure the staff at Barts believe, I don’t spend time beating corpses just for the fun of it. I
“One that works for the same... establishment. I have good reason to believe the woman who killed the men is dead too.”
John was an idiot for not knowing, but it was obvious he cared for Sherlock a great deal. He looked at Sherlock like he was the most amazing person in the world, and the most important person in his world. It had broken her heart, seeing him at Sherlock’s funeral. She’d spent sleepless nights wondering if she should break the promise she’d made to Sherlock and just tell John he was alive. What did she owe Sherlock anyway? He’d never exactly been kind to her in the years they’d known each other. But in the end there had never been any question where her loyalties lay, and she had avoided John the best she could.
Sherlock smirked, “I don’t know much about the world of prostitution, but I’m sure they’ve seen weirder.”
“CCTV,” was apparently enough of an explanation.
It wasn’t seldom John wondered how it was possible that this man, who was so wholly extraordinary, had chosen
When John pulled back and Sherlock opened his eyes, there was no damage. Not even stray splashes. The water lessened, dwindling back down to quiet streams, thin enough just to glisten along the walls as it caught the light from the palace windows. Sherlock turned, looking around the room as the realisation sank in. He had done it. The water his mind had chosen to represent his emotion for John was contained.
John watched Sherlock guide his partner across the floor as fluidly as if there were no one else present. As if the steps were as natural as walking. Mesmerising. The consulting detective was a violinist. The violinist was a chemist. The chemist was a dancer. Incredible.
“Could you please go faster?” John asked for the second time.
Sherlock had a surprising affinity for children’s games. (John had been floored the first time Sherlock had walked into the living room, stopped in front of his chair, clasped his hands behind his back, and asked, “Do you want to play Battleship with me?”) Sherlock typically preferred strategy-based games like draughts or chess or Sequence, but on occasion would suggest something sillier like Operation (John was pleased to play at least one game at which he could regularly beat Sherlock) or even Go Fish. Sherlock had no interest in resource/money accumulation games, refusing to play Monopoly and being decidedly uncooperative on the night John and Mike Stamford had tried to explain Settlers of Catan to him. (They needed a third player and John had mistakenly thought Sherlock might like it.)
“Moran told you to say that.” God, he was dealing with a psychologist. He hated psychologists.
Sherlock’s gaze roamed down over John’s neck and paused where John’s identification tags were hanging in the space between them, flashing in the low ceiling lights. He lifted his hand and caught at them. He leaned his weight more fully back against John and he felt the chain tug against his neck as Sherlock turned them over and over.
Sherlock was looking at his friend with raised eyebrows. "I wasn't aware a dance could be an arsehole."
But of course John would see Sherlock’s call from the rooftop of Barts as a mirror of his own distress when they’d met in the lab. Except Sherlock had saved John and John hadn’t saved Sherlock. He couldn’t have. There was nothing he could have said. There was nothing he could have done. It was rigged. Sherlock was always going to jump. He was always going to die. John’s part in it had only been for show.
The new design fully integrated his feelings for John throughout his entire mind palace. They took up no space at all, but at the same time they were omnipresent, surrounding his mind completely—insulating it the way John insulated him from the world. They were like John’s presence at Baker Street: Unobtrusive and quiet, but so essential, so thoroughly woven throughout the space that it would be someplace else entirely without it; comforting, pleasant, always with him, in every room of 221B and now in every room of his mind palace.
Startled, John looked up from his phone. Not a nurse. “Where is he?”
Sherlock did his best to lock his eyes on his abhorrent older brother even as he blurred out of focus. His skin was buzzing. He could feel his heart beating at a pace that would have been alarming if he'd cared even slightly.
John felt his heart pound in his chest and it was a moment before he responded. “What?”
“If you will
“Do you remember where those three places were?”
“I thought you’d left.” He turned to busy himself with putting away the instrument.
“He’s up,” the nurse said urgently. “We have to examine him”—she jabbed her finger at Sherlock—“and we need this guy gone.”
“Sorry, but three years is a bit optimistic. No one could live a month at Baker Street without losing his sheep.”
John had said half to himself as he was on his way out. Where had he been going? Probably to see one of his old girlfriends…
in the same way Mary was.
“You’re lying right now.”
It's my
It wasn’t John. It was his mind’s words in John’s voice, posing possibilities... The women he’d admired: Lady Carmichael and Irene Adler.
Sherlock had never wanted Mrs. Hudson to shut up less. Weddings were despicable, melodramatic displays of sentiment—wholly repugnant social constructs designed to cultivate embarrassing and frankly pathetic levels of emotion. If John could be reasoned out of such an appalling affair Sherlock would not hesitate to shake the hand of the person who did it. John didn't need to marry Mary. He didn't need to live with Mary either. He could live here, at Baker Street, like they had before.
No, Sherlock was not a child anymore. And of all the lessons learned, this was the one Mycroft had hoped he would never have to.
When he arrived home, it was close to five o’clock and Sherlock was up. Or not ‘up,’ but awake at least. He was lying on the couch, wearing his wine-coloured dressing gown over pyjama trousers and t-shirt, reading an article from a medical journal he was holding above his head.
“Mycroft.”
Mycroft smiled humourlessly as he folded the paper, tucking it neatly into a small notebook that he replaced within his jacket.
“Modest as always,” John muttered, walking over to his chair and dropping down into it.
referring to me as a child who is not present,” Sherlock interjected petulantly.
“It is a bit slutty,” John agreed.
Mycroft held up his hand. “It’s another story for another day. Perhaps you can ask Sherlock to tell it to you at bedtime.”
“You don’t love anyone?”
"Are we done then?" John asked. Sherlock was surprised to hear a trace of disappointment in his voice. "I think I was just getting the hang of it."
“We were both working that night,” she said. “But Karina did not kill them. She would never do that. I knew her better than anyone.”
He held out the plate of toast to Sherlock, who merely glowered at it before glowering at him.
Reaching back further, John remembered the fog; he was surprised to find he remembered the coma dream with vivid clarity. It wasn’t like other dreams where the details slipped away with consciousness, leaving only remnants of vague impressions. He remembered everything as though it were a memory and not a dream. The voices—Sherlock’s voice: “You are everything to me.”
The detective’s eyes ran over him, reading him, John knew, in that piercingly analytical way of his and John was suddenly hyperaware that he was still wearing only his boxers. The only clothes he had in Sherlock’s room were the ones from last night, and in his current state he truly couldn’t be arsed to get them on again. Sherlock would just have to cope with his boxers. They were nice boxers, anyway. John’s head swam and he wished his unbelievably intense flatmate would stop looking at him like—
you did it… would have additional…” He couldn’t believe he was saying this. As soon as Sherlock had shown up in London he’d determined never to speak of it, never to think of it again. “Never mind,” he said abruptly.
“So I’m basically filling in for your skull,” John had responded, incredulous.
As a goldfish, despite being a highly superior—if not the most superior—goldfish, John would want to do goldfish things sometimes. Sherlock couldn’t ask John to forever forego pub nights in favour of crouching in dark alleyways, trade movies for morgues, and love for labs.
“What?”
He blinked in amazement. Shouldn’t he have known? Because wasn’t the reverse true for him? Wasn’t John’s death his own greatest fear?
She’d been working with Sherlock night and day, not fully understanding the project but following Sherlock’s orders obediently: prepping chemicals, running tests, recording reactions, only going home in the early hours of the morning to get some sleep.
“This one does.”
"A funeral home," Sherlock finished for her. "Easy. I could do this one blindfolded."
to fool him…” John trailed off as it dawned on him.
“Now I really must be going,” Mycroft said, checking his watch. “My best wishes for a quick recovery.”
So John continued to avoid Sherlock’s searching gaze as he explained, “I haven’t been happy with her since… For a long time.”
Moran grinned like ice. “Search him.”
“Don’t you get tired of being right all the time?”
“No. He’s a successful lawyer in his mid-thirties with no history of anxiety or depression. I searched his flat this afternoon. There’s nothing there to suggest hidden angst.” Sherlock scoffed the last two words.
Sherlock waited, curious.
Sherlock muttered, “I’m only saying it wouldn’t hurt to treat the spellcheck function with a little more deference.”
Sherlock lifted his hand from John’s shoulder to his face, brushing his thumb over a scratch on his cheek he’d gotten from the window. John shut his eyes. When he opened them again he saw Sherlock looking up at him questioningly and suddenly it was all too much.
” John’s voice was deep, desire scraping it course. Sherlock’s eyes fell shut for a moment at the sound of it. He knew without a doubt that whatever John would do to him now, he would let him. Because he wanted it just as much. He could feel the nerves in his skin crying out to be touched the same way his veins used to beg for heroin. But this was new. In the past he’d found kissing thoroughly unpleasant. It was nothing like this. He had never wanted anybody like this. The chemicals in his brain were giving him a rush he hadn’t thought possible without synthetic supplements. But he felt a touch of anxiety weave through his desire—he’d never been here before and, for once, he needed John to guide him.
“We could get a warrant—”
“John—” Sherlock started having absolutely no words to follow.
“You don’t need to lie to placate me,” John shot back, jerking his arm out of Sherlock’s grasp. “They’re your cases; you decide how to handle them. It’s nothing.”
John dove down kissed him decisively, deeply, with no less passion for the slow pace. When Sherlock gripped his hips John couldn’t stop himself from rolling them down, and the soft groan the contact pulled from the detective was enough to make John force himself upright, panting. He had to take control of the situation while it was still possible. They had to leave. Now. The things he wanted to do his flatmate were not legal outdoors.
As John looked out the fog lifted enough to see farther down the path. There was ocean that way. He could see the shore. Soft sand; the steady pull of the waves. It was nice there, he knew somehow. Everything would be all right if he walked that way.
“Come on, you must have a theory,” Lestrade pushed his luck.
Sherlock. His best friend. But no, not his best friend. Sherlock was so much more. He was everything. The hero of his stories. Sherlock had given him a reason to live at a time John was sure he had none. He’d cured his limp and turned his world upside down within a day. The man who’d saved him. The man who he devoted all his time and energy to protecting in return. And she—the woman he’d chosen to love—she’d
Slowed heart rate, excessive vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels), loss of elasticity in red blood cells causing them to clump together and move sluggishly, not delivering oxygen fast enough. Fairly straightforward precursors to shock, the potentially fatal panicking and eventual failure of the body’s circulatory system.
Sherlock stared at him.
John gave him a concerned look. "A problem?" he suggested.
He’d been explaining something urgent and imperative (as usual) when John had asked, “But why are you telling all of this to
Sherlock shut his eyes and let the swarm of thoughts descended on him.
If Mycroft was surprised by the unusual request for assistance, he didn't show it. He stepped behind the worktop, surveying seventy-two hours’ worth of crazed calculations.
The warmth of Sherlock’s body spread through John’s limbs, thawing his numb skin. He felt his nerves prickling like pins and needles, like waking up. He held tightly to Sherlock as the fog dissipated and the garden began to vanish. He would have been falling, he knew, if it weren’t for the weight of Sherlock in his arms, anchoring him while the chaos of the in-between rushed around them.
*And it would have taken much longer if it weren't for the amazing
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It wouldn’t have gotten worse.”
He only waited an instant to see Reeves fall from the fire escape (confirming he’d hit his target and there was no danger of a third shot) before whirling around to check Sherlock. The panic that had seized him when he heard the other shot dissipated when he saw Sherlock looking up at him, startled, before leaping to his feet, clearly unharmed. John had pulled Sherlock aside in time; Reeves had missed his mark.
“Let’s hear it then,” John said when they were settled into the cab.
In spite of everything he found himself chuckling. “We literally scared the trousers off him.”
Sherlock turned around. “Yes?”
“I believe Mr. Holmes is just as surprised to see us as we are to see him,” Moran explained placidly.
“I’ll go.”
Molly blanched. “What? Why not?”
Uncoincidentally this was the same night he met Mycroft Holmes.
They barely spoke in the time John was awake, and in many ways he was grateful for the silence. He was exhausted as his body healed itself, and in the brief periods of time he managed in the living room it was soothing to sit quietly and listen to Sherlock play the violin, or to watch him methodically working through an experiment.
Mrs. Avery laughed. "Not to worry, dear, it's all in good fun."
“We thought something terrible might have happened,” the woman smiled.
They had met when John was twenty-nine, far too late to make a ‘best friend’—at least for someone like him, someone who didn’t have close friends. And the relationship hadn’t developed over time. It had been immediate, urgent—
The case had never been important.
"I'm a doctor."
In the waiting room at the hospital, Lestrade stood as the doctor approached. Relief flooded through him when she explained they had been able to stabilise Sherlock’s condition. “We’ll have to notify the next of kin,” she was saying. “Can you tell us who that might be?”
He looked over at the detective and was dismayed to see The Look on his face. The ‘we both know what’s going on here’ look. It was John's more diplomatic (and shorter) name for the ‘I’m very annoying (with my designer shoes and my poncey, curly hair), and I’m about to get us both into really deep shit’ look.
“You think I care?” He threw on the soaking wet jacket to prove his point. “Is that it? If I punch this little twat in the face,”—he pointed up at Sherlock—“you’ll get my jacket wet?”
“Yes, he hurt me.”
“I hated myself for two years for not being able to save you.” He heard John take a breath. “I couldn’t stop thinking that the phone call was you asking me to do the same thing you had done for me…”
"Yes."
John reached out for it. “Thanks, I can get it back to her tomorrow.”
He’d been fooled by his own brain’s red herring, even while it tried to hint the deception to him. Even the contemplation of Moriarty's death had only been a piece of what his mind was doing.
“I should have thought it was obvious.”
“You do know that I let you win the fight just now,” Sherlock opted to change the subject as he started back toward the path.
He’d been getting nowhere on a murder investigation, and was feeling particularly hopeless about it when Sherlock walked through the door telling him the name of the murderer and the time and address where he would find him. With no other leads to go on Lestrade decided he may as well go off on a wild goose chase as sit banging his head against the desk in his office. He was amazed when the boy’s advice turned out not only to be sound, but entirely brilliant.
“Hang on,” John said several hours later. They were both on their laptops, John in his chair reading an article about a new drug for narcolepsy, and Sherlock continuing his research at the table. “I asked you if you thought Irene Adler was somehow involved in the murders and you said you
She kissed him. He froze as she wrapped her arms around him beneath his unbuttoned shirt and deepened the kiss. Knowing he had to play his role for the camera he placed his hands on her waist and kissed her back.
Sherlock clenched and flexed his hands looking down at the first person he’d ever been able to call a friend. John. Intriguingly complex John. He had liked him from the moment he’d set eyes on him. John’s voice, his moderate dress (masculine but neat, casual but coordinated), his good physical condition (minus the psychosomatic limp), the fact that he was left-handed (Sherlock liked the deviance from the ordinary, along with the idea that John lived in a mirrored world), etc. Sherlock had been surprised—he’d assumed he would never meet a person he approved of so readily.
Sherlock was standing in profile now: eyes still shut, only the occasional flutter of eyelashes or twitch of the mouth when the emotion of the piece shifted.
John’s mouth fell open. “
Add the last remaining variable—that John had fallen for Sherlock almost immediately, despite his brother’s frankly shocking list of flaws—and Sherlock had caved, falling for John in return. Mycroft had seen it the night John shot the cabbie.
He blamed the drugs for the sentiment involved in going to John’s blog, to the story of when they met, after take-off.
“You almost died last night!” John raised his voice sharply.
Lestrade shook his head mumbling something about a ‘consulting liability’ as he left the flat.
“As soon as it stops suiting my purposes so nicely,” Sherlock said, moving from where he was leaning on the table to drop down into his chair across from John. “I would ask you to have a seat, but you’re clearly just on your way out.”
“And he chose me,” Sherlock growled.
“John.”
“IF YOU LIE TO ME ONE MORE TIME SO HELP ME GOD!”
It was ironic working at a surgery full of equipment and medications and knowing none of it could help him. He’d poured over Sherlock’s notes on the poison that first day, and though they were mostly haphazard chicken scratch, he’d been able to decipher them well enough to understand the basic pathophysiology.
It was a headache Mycroft didn’t have time for. Normally he wouldn’t care—normally being forced to consider his brother’s sexuality would have made him rather cross (in fact it was a blessing that heretofore there hadn’t been one to consider)—but this was different.
“Interesting business technique,” John muttered. If the drug enhanced sensory awareness, the clients would leave feeling like they’ve never had better sex. But the dose would be small enough that combined with the effects of natural sexual stimulation and alcohol the clients might not realise they had been exposed to a drug. Sober sex comparatively feels dull, and they keep coming back.
John didn’t bother denying it. He shrugged. “I like your face.”
“You wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for this,” Sherlock said, voice low, reading his mind the way he always could.
Now there was no case, no argument. There could be no other meaning in the touch at all—no excuse for it—other than intimacy. Sherlock slowly closed his hand on John’s arm, feeling his lack of reaction like a physical ache. How many times had he seen John wake up and taken it for granted? When John napped on the couch, when Sherlock went up to his bedroom to wake him--But of course he’d taken it for granted. He’d never considered there could be a time when John might not—
“It’s a violent game,” Sherlock remarked.
“That’s the one,” Sherlock said, dropping his head back.
Sherlock nodded and John helped him to his feet. He grabbed Sherlock’s coat from where it lay on the floor and held it up while Sherlock put his arms through it. Sherlock swayed trying to step forward and John caught him around the waist, allowing him to brace himself on his shoulders.
