“I’m sorry to leave you like this. But Sam’s right. There are a few things I have to do before I can be around a school full of other people again.”
“You called him stupid. He has ADHD, Castiel. He struggles with school and when we were kids all the teachers called him stupid. So, um, yeah, nice going.” Sam told him.
“Hmm, so, what you’re telling me is that you’re a snobby rich bitch with friends in high places, who are just as snobby and pretentious as you are. People who could ruin your life, make you an outcast, if, say for hypothetical purposes, they found out that your homophobic ass refused to allow your now disgraced gay sons to collect their stuff in order to abide your wish to never see them again.”
Castiel did as he was told and then ducked his face back into Dean’s chest, swearing viciously. “They’re pissed. Is it possible for a human head to combust just from suppressed rage?”
After a third, albeit half hearted this time, attempt to get his brother to react in any way, Dean pouted and killed the motor. “Asshole.” Dean grumbled when Sam made it to his window and crouched down so they could talk through the window.
Neither of them were seen in any of their classes for the rest of the day, and when Jo tried calling them at the end of the day both numbers went straight to voicemail, so that left her and Gabe to get Castiel home on the bus. It was no easy feat with his leg. The bus was crowded, and Cas had needed an entire seat to himself and no one wanted to give theirs away.
He blacked out, and when he came to, Dean’s head was thrown back with a look of absolute euphoria on his face. And suddenly, he could feel something spurting all over his insides, and all over his chest. This time he screamed for a whole other reason.
Once Bobby got there, things moved pretty quickly; and before they knew it Castiel and Gabe had their stuff loaded into the back of a small truck Bobby had borrowed from his friend Rufus. Twenty minutes later they were back on the road.
But class went off without a hitch. Monroe was a stern teacher, ran a tight ship when lecturing. But he was also fair. He knew when to laugh at a student’s innocent slip up without being cruel about it. And he also knew when to come down hard on another student’s lazy work ethic when it came to handing in assignments. The students all seemed to like and respect him and he treated them like they were actually human.
"Hmm. You're right, these are third degree. You said you were trying to lift a burning piece of wood?"
“It’s complicated. I wouldn’t expect you to understand unless you knew what kind of life my brother and I live, lived, whatever. It’s hard for me to trust anyone. The only person who hasn’t ever let me down is Sammy.”
Neither twin were aware that Jo and her friends were talking to them, or that Jo had asked Dean if he and Sam wanted to hang out after dinner.
“The nurse gave me six stitches and she’s just gone to get me a moon boot for my ankle. Do you know why Dean would say he’d carry me everywhere with crutches?”
The woman behind the desk, a young pretty thing with dark brown hair and pale skin, looked up from her computer. She was even younger than Dean realised as she stood and approached them. She had blue eyes and her mouth seemed to be permanently set to polite-smile. Again, neither twin noticed much more than that. It was only ever the eyes and a few minor details to give them a sense of how to react in a situation; flight or fight. This woman, like the girl outside, weren’t threatening, but they weren’t anything that would warrant a second thought, either.
He was so lovestruck by Castiel, even as kids trying to figure out their sexuality, that Dean often spent days after speaking to the other teen with the same vacant look in his eyes and that same dopey smile on his lips.
Dean got to his feet so sharply he knocked the table, glaring down at his twin. “You… you told them everything, huh? Even though we both swore we would never breathe a word of it to anyone. Not even Bobby knows it. And yet, you just randomly decided to tell the whole school everything! Nice. Thanks, Bro.”
He also had a point. You don’t live the way they did as kids and grow up warm and fuzzy and well adjusted. That knife in Dean’s hip holster wasn’t just decoration, either. It may not be visible, but it had blood on it. Lots of it. Even Dean’s.
“So, how about, instead of telling him you’ll carry him up a flight of stairs, how about you tell him that you’d like to kiss him.”
Sam noticed his omission and shot him a quick look before looking away. No one else noticed anything amiss and Dean continued to talk to Cass about that afternoon’s errand. Jo and Benny and Charlie began discussing their computer classes and Sam and Gabe went on to talk to Crowley about Crowley’s mother possibly being available for Chuck to get some legal advice if he needed to fight the Novaks in court.
Sam loved it here, with these people, with Bobby and Ellen. He loved the friends they’d managed to make at school. He didn’t want them to think badly of his brother because of something out of Dean’s control.
Cas steeled himself to look at his precious baby and couldn't help a small sob. She was hooked up to IVs and breathing tubes and all kinds of equipment that were obviously keeping her alive.
Finally, Sam looked up from his books and turned to Dean. He’d managed to eat the sandwich, but he was still struggling with the last bite, which had been packed into his mouth until his cheeks puffed out like a squirrel with nuts in its mouth.
They sat in silent vigil over their daughter's unconscious body until Bobby, Dean's boss, appeared at the doors. He spoke quietly, displaying his own grief - and of course he would, after Dean's parents had died Bobby had adopted both Dean and Sam and raised them like his own sons, Summer was as much Bobby's granddaughter as Dean was his son. "You're done here, Dean. You're no good to this team right now. Cas. You get them outta here. Take care of my boy and that kid of yours." and with that he closed the doors and Cas heard a loud bang on the side, signalling that Bobby had smacked it to give the driver the all clear to leave.
“Right. There. He’s said it loud and clear, there is no way you fucks could mistake that. It will be your only warning. The next time I have to speak to you about touching him, I will not let you walk away.”
“Ok. See you this afternoon.” And then Cass reached up to stroke Dean’s face, sweeping back and behind his head to pull Dean down until their lips met in the middle. When Dean groaned Castiel pressed his advantage and opened his mouth to sweep his tongue across Dean’s bottom lip.
“Mister Winchester?” The officer began, but Dean held up a hand to silence him before he could say anything else.
There, on the ground, staring up at him in shock and surprise, was Castiel Novak. Dean growled and snarled as he rounded on the other kid – Alistair Morningstar. Of course. He’d seen the kid leave right after Castiel. He should have figured it out then.
“The boy that came to the house last night. The one who picked you up when you went to the movie with Alex. Was that the same kid that drove the car that crashed?” Dean asked.
Dean accepted his and immediately took a big gulp. Sam accepted his own, but didn’t take a drink, busy as he was, talking to Gabriel.
The woman reached for the phone hanging on the wall beside the fridge. Just as her hand wrapped around it, a large blade soared passed her ear and lodged itself into the wall in front of her. “You don’t wanna do that. You call the cops; I’ll have to beat your ass. The cops’ll get here, they’ll ask questions, and I’ll have to tell them that I was here helping my friends get their stuff because their homophobic parents kicked them out. They’ll ask why you got a beat down, I’ll have to tell them you attacked me when you found out I’m not just here out of the kindness of my heart for a friend, but that I am actually going to take your son Castiel home tonight and fuck him good and proper. ‘I’m sorry officer, I really didn’t mean to crush her skull, but she threatened to blow my head off. I acted in fear of my life’.” Dean let his eyes go wide in fear, imitating her high, whiny voice to highlight his mockery of her.
Gabe swallowed thickly. Dean’s attention never wavered from his brother, and Gabe couldn’t decide if that made the threat towards him more, or less, intimidating. Nevertheless, he raised his hands, palms out, and made a show of taking a giant step back. Dean was wild and unpredictable, the incident in the car this morning with the knife had shown him that, he wasn’t about to get on his bad side.
“Hey, Cas, do you need help getting out of the car?” It was Gabe’s voice, and Dean looked up as the other Novak approached, Jo a step behind. Dean eyed him as the other teen got closer, clenching his fists into tight fists. After threatening him in the car Dean had no idea what Gabriel would do.
But Sam wasn’t patient this morning; too much was riding on him getting Cass out to the car before Dean changed his mind and disappeared. He turned and threw the other teen over his shoulder, like a fire fighter rescuing a person from a building.
Sam was cowering against the back tyre of the impala and one look at his pretty little bitch-face all bloodied up and swollen had Dean seeing red. He reached for the baseball bat he kept in the trunk of his car and walked back around to where he’d left the drunk guy when he’d pulled him off of his brother.
Dean scoffed and shot the other teen a doubtful look. “My mother died when we were kids. My father drove us around the whole country looking for the nearest pub to get drunk. He’d leave us in the car in the parking lot of the seediest places you can think of. It was our only home in most cases. Which meant it became essential that it be kept running, whatever the cost. I learned to drive and repair all its faults before I was even old enough to see over the dashboard. And that’s the nice part. Life gets worse from there.”
“Uhh. Oh. I get it now. Look. I told you before, Dean’s a very protective person. You go hurt. On his watch. And you refused his offer to stitch you himself. And now you obviously chose the boot over his offer to carry you… do you see where this is going?”
“In simple terms. Yes. In medical terms the burns led to your inability to breathe on your own. Therefore, you required mechanical ventilation and a breathing tube.”
“Oh, right. Yes, I was told to expect you. Find a seat and then see me at the end of class so I can give you an overview of what you might need to catch up to the rest of the class.” The teacher told them, signing the sheet and handing it back before gesturing back behind the boys in a vague, general sweep of the room to indicate the seats available.
Dean was convinced he’d never amount to anything and always heaped the attention on Sam whenever there was some kind of award. Dean never thought twice about praising any of Sam’s achievements. But if Sam ever tried to return the favour, like that time with the shanty hut he’d made, Dean would get mad and refuse to take credit for anything.
Years later Rowena was doing a lot better and with the help of Fergus had opened a little cafe, which was thriving with the frequent business of the fire fighters she doted on.
“Yeah. You were running to escape and tripped. A support beam fell on your leg. The weight broke the leg, and then it caught on fire and burned it as well. It took your father and Uncle Cole both to lift it off.”
This class room was also backwards, so they had to walk down the centre aisle, past the students at the desks, to get to him. He stopped and stared at them and Dean felt like he had to turn around and run. But Sam was at his back, which made him relax a bit. He DID NOT like having so many people behind him like this. Too many chances for an ambush.
Sam loved that about his twin. More than a couple times he’d had to stand on the side lines while Dean had literally fought off poachers wanting the meagre scraps the boys had gathered to eat. And Dean had a habit of hiding weapons he’d hand made in various places on his body, which meant that any unlucky opponent quickly learned that Dean was not one to fuck with.
And then one day, after one of the worst fights Dean had gotten into, Sam had taken over Dean’s school work. Suddenly he wasn’t such a bad student.
Bobby, watching them go up to their room, almost died with relief and finished off the last of the beer he’d been nursing for who knew how long, before following his sister’s boys up the stairs to his own room. Inside Ellen rolled over and curled into his side. “Did they get home safely?”
Dean shrugged. “Mostly. I was in no shape to be anywhere near that place, but I did need to keep myself busy somehow, so Sam and I worked out a plan to keep our word to help you and Gabe get your stuff.”
He turned into that room, while his brother strong armed the man of the house into the room on the left; a plush looking lounge room.
Although Dean was technically a patient, he was mostly compos mentis enough that his doctor was happy for him to be left to his own devices. To be honest, if it wasn’t for the fact that they were at the hospital with Summer anyway, Dean would have been treated as an Outpatient for his injuries. That left him with the free will to leave on a food run for them both instead of waiting for the canteen staff to bring them something.
“No, Dean, you didn’t ‘have to’ do anything. You did it because you wanted to thank Mrs Tran for taking us both in. Despite the fact that she spoke perfect English, you chose to learn her mother tongue because you knew it would mean more to her because you took the effort to do so.”
Dean smirked, pulling Cas into his body with a firm hand to his waist. Castiel let out a small ‘oomph’ as his body impacted Dean’s solid, unyielding chest, one hand happened to land on Dean’s right pectoral as the other wrapped around behind Dean’s back and fell to his shoulder. Dean dropped his head and spoke against the column of Castiel’s neck, “I speak with the confidence of someone who knows he can back it up with action.”
“Oh, honey, I love you too. I’m alright. I promise. You just gave us a scare, is all. I’m trying to make myself believe that, after seeing the state you were in, you are still alive. I still keep thinking this is a dream.”
They got up together and left the room, bickering, as usual, about whether they were clean and presentable enough for dinner. Sam argued that Dean should have a shower. Dean shoved him into the wall and simply refused.
“You do like me, don’t you?” Castiel turned shy – teasing, if Dean had to describe it – and twiddled his fingers like a demure young virgin.
“Right. So, obviously your eyes aren’t painted on; you can all see we have two new guys in the class. So get your staring out of your systems now, but save your disrupting noise for the lunch room. Anyone interrupting my lesson will be writing a four thousand word essay on the difference between Shakespeare and Lord Byron. Now, let’s get back to the lesson.”
Just as Cass began to move his hips against Dean’s groin, inches from having his hand down Dean’s jeans, Sam hit his palm against the window. The couple froze, but they didn’t move to cover their activities. Dean turned to glare at his brother through the window before winding it down so Sam could speak.
“Well, you were right; it ain’t broken, but you’re gonna have a nice size football for a few days.” Dean told him.
But Castiel, still fussing and tucking, growled in outrage. “HEY! I’m a parent, it’s my job to be overbearing and protective. Especially since I almost lost my only child!”
“For you, maybe. I had so many girls sleazing all over me I’m gonna need a fucking shower. I feel dirty and slimy. God, give me a fucking man to bury myself into and all will be right with the world again.” Dean muttered.
Dean gulped, but gave him a short, sharp nod of affirmation. “No one’s touched me since. Though, not from lack of trying.”
“He would too. Dean, stop it. You can’t go around bashing up everyone you don’t like. And for heaven’s sake, put the knife away!” Sam scolded.
Cass’s face split into a wide grin, like he’d won some great prize – though what that could be, Dean had no idea.
“Why Castiel seemed so submissive at lunch. I hate homophobic fucks. Sam and I have been targeted on more than one occasion before we began standing up for ourselves. It’s never nice. It never ends well.”
Dean smiled quickly, like he was trying to fit in – like Sam – but he was pretty sure he was failing miserably.
And with that he got up, drained his coffee mug, and followed his brother from the room, carrying both plates with him. Hell, free food was free food. When you go hungry more often than not you don’t turn down food when it’s given to you. Probably not a habit either of them would ever be able to break.
“Then I definitely wouldn’t have stopped. I’m in enough trouble as it is without you actually seeing me do it.” She remarked.
Cass and Gabe both stared at him. Even Crowley looked a little green. Benny and his sister Charlie were silently captivated and weren’t really giving anything away in terms of how they felt about this new information.
Sam kicked his brother under the table and when Dean looked up at him he shook his head, mouthing “don’t do it.”
As if to answer his father’s question Jack appeared in the door way behind them. “What’s going on? Why are the police here?”
Dean grunted but he’d taken the plate from his brother, so he wasn’t too angry. “Yeah, I know.” He said after a long silence.
The nurse radioed it in on her portable that she needed someone from the burn unit to come and look at a possible third degree.
Jo giggled at the incredulous look on Benny’s face. “You’re right, Benny. Sam’s just messing with you. But you know Sam by now, right? He’s not usually the violent one. So, imagine, if Sam can do that, and Dean is the violent one…”
“Just wanted to show you my supply of condoms that I found in my sock drawer. I forgot I had them.” Castiel said, casually lifting up a box of condoms. He eyed Dean like he was daring him to make a comment; Sam and Jo had said to ignore the comments in front of his parents, but they hadn’t said anything about making his own.
Sam nodded. “Figured it was something like that. If you’d gotten the blade in, he wouldn’t have been breathing.”
Benny got the hint and grabbed his sister by the arm and walked her out of the cafeteria, only now becoming aware of the audience they’d attracted.
So, Dean’s way of coping was to be the big strong ‘alpha male’ type of guy. The ‘real men don’t cry, and real men don’t use kitchens because that’s women’s work’ sort of guy.
Ellen smiled to see Dean so happy. Jo made a gagging noise and her mother jabbed her sharply in the side of the ribs.
“Oh, baby. Oh my darling, beautiful, precious child. I thought I’d lost you. I… my god, I… that beam, your cries… a parent’s worst nightmare… I love you so much, Summer-girl. Oh fuck, so much.” Dean rattled off. He didn’t seem to notice or care that he couldn’t manage to finish a single sentence.
“Before I answer that, let me ask you this. That woman was one of four people who helped raise me and my brother. All of them were old and cranky and had mean tempers, especially when it came to someone hurting family, I inherited that ‘family’ trait. Now. Imagine we’ve just found out, that instead of Alex, it had been Claire. Could you really see me keeping my cool and playing cop in that scenario?”
After a few more moments and at least a million more questions, even Summer agreed she would rather stay in the hospital until the doctors were comfortable in letting her go.
Straight into the deep pools of blue eyes. He inhaled sharply. He hadn’t realised that he was being watched while he’d been focused on his brother. His eyes narrowed into a challenging glare and Castiel blushed and looked away.
And, like that, as if he could see where things were headed, Sam blasted the horn, which caused Dean to jump away, if only at the mouth, and glare down into the car. Given that his hand was on Castiel’s zipper, and by extension, his prick, the bitchface Dean managed to give his twin was severe and deadly. If it were anyone else, they'd have been a pile of ash by now.
In the back Cas and his own twin exchanged nervous looks. They were aware that the Winchester brothers both had tempers, and while they’d never seen evidence of it, they’d also never seen them fight between each other either.
“I hesitate to answer that question, Mr Winchester, given the display you’ve already given them.” Castiel scolded.
"Oh, right. Yes, I was the one who looked at her leg. Very lucky young lady. Haven't had the chance to speak to her parents about treatment though."
“Wait, that outburst about the Novaks? That’s what you mean? That’s him ‘just annoyed’? What does ‘severely pissed’ look like?”
“They’re healing, slowly, which is good news. Maybe another ten to twelve weeks. Good news is that we won’t keep you in that whole time. You can even go home today. I know your husband must be exhausted. The bad news is that you will be left with some scarring. Just how much, I can’t say.”
Truthfully, he’d known all along that he’d cop it well and good from Bobby. And, he honestly didn’t have an excuse. He was a firefighter and a paramedic, his hands were vital to his continued employment.
Crowley scowled at him and Dean smirked back. He wasn’t about to tell the kid that he and Sam had had to improvise with a lot of things while they were on their own; building and construction had been one of those things, especially when it came to shelter.
The Dream, according to Sam, was symbolic. It was symbolic of wanting someone they could trust enough to let their guard down. Let someone take them in and away from the nasty reality of what the world was truly like; the monsters under the beds of children who had no idea because they were safe and protected.
Cass and Sam had their own law firm, meaning Cass had no Higher Ups to answer to for missing work, and with his hands in the condition they were in, Dean had been put on indefinite leave.
Jo, Bobby’s stepdaughter was already seated with a tray of food, which she passed around after she called them over and shamed them into sitting with her. She gave them both a salad sandwich and a coke and chatted about her day. “I heard you two stood up to Old Grinch.”
Finally, alone with their daughter again, Cass heaved a deep exhausted sigh and fidgeted with the blankets around Summer, for the thousandth time.
“And as I blow my load all over him, wanna know what my last thought will be? It’ll be this moment, the looks on your faces right now as the visual settles into your heads. I will always remember the looks on your faces as the realisation dawns on you. For the rest of your lives you are going fall asleep knowing that your son is being fucked by another man. Is his voice breaking around repeated cries for me to fuck him harder? Or, maybe he’s on his knees with my cock in his mouth, tasting every last bit of come I give him?”
“Yeah, and he’s the only one who gets to call me that. So don’t try it.” Sam spoke up, now sitting at the other end of the table with Gabe, Benny and Crowley.
It was a long discussion, and clearly Summer had gotten more than she’d bargained for once the doctor began describing, in as much detail as he could, exactly how lucky she truly was. He explained that because the burn was just too extensive and could possibly take too long to heal, the leg couldn’t be cast so they’d had to insert a metal rod.
For years, he and Dean had done as they’d pleased; eaten when they were hungry, showered if and when they felt like it. For Dean, he’d aged past needing a parent, and now, suddenly he had a couple who wanted to do exactly that; parent him, like an idiot child.
Before Dean could respond the back door on Dean’s side opened and his brother hit the side of his head from behind. “Break it up, we have to get to school.”
The silence that followed his confession was deafening and then after a moment Dean felt his chest getting tighter and tighter and suddenly he was feeling claustrophobic and he had to escape. He turned and wrenched open his door and fled.
Dean hadn’t even noticed he’d pulled out his knife until Sam said anything about it. Dean growled and did as he was told, reprimanded like only Sam could do.
Dean heard both but he was already worked up. He punched Sam in the face, knocking him off the bench and onto his back on the ground. He leaped on top of his brother, blind with rage.
“Don’t look at me like that, Sammy, I hate that one. That one is always followed up with trouble. And I’m usually the one who gets into a fight that finishes it.”
“Since when are we feeding the neighbourhood?” he asked, a little snidely, reaching for a dinner roll from the centre of the table as he threw one leg over the back of his chair and sat down, heavily. He turned to smirk at his neighbour – none other than Castiel Novak.
“You’ll have better luck keeping her off the leg if she’s in here than we ever would at home. She’s an active child. Running, swimming, and I think she was talking about netball this season.” Cass answered.
Cass smiled fondly up at his bossy husband. Dean always had looked out for him, even as kids in school; if anyone had dared pick on Castiel, they’d wind up with a mouthful of fist and a stomach full of their own teeth – that had happened to Arthur Ketch, in fact. Dean had walked around the corner of the library to hear Ketch call Castiel a fag and had wound up having his stomach pumped for the six teeth he’d choked on.
“Why, you want me to?” Dean replied, seriously. “I can if you want, but I was going to get Sam to do it, he sews straighter.”
Sam sat and eyed his brother for a moment longer before getting out of the car and dashing inside. Castiel was seated at the breakfast table with Bobby and Ellen, and now Jo and Gabe were there too. He didn’t stop to greet everyone. He grabbed Cass by the collar of his shirt and pulled. “Come with me.” He demanded.
Dean simply shrugged and ate another segment of Orange. “You heard me. You wouldn’t have gotten defensive and tried to insult me by calling me names, if you hadn’t.”
When they’d been kids, going to school regularly, Dean had often been mistaken as stupid. It was mostly why Dean had started fighting. Everyone had picked on him. Called him names, said he was dumb; even the teachers told him he was useless and a waste of their time trying to teach him.
“Only because you were panting after his brother. I was keeping an eye on the guy in case he knifed you for hitting on his brother.”
“Sleeping Beauty was awoken by a kiss from her Prince Charming, not by the baying of a mule. What is it with you and your brother? You wind each other up so much people are going to start to wonder if you actually hate each other.”
“Actually, stupid, he did. You think he would offer to carry just anyone with an injured leg around everywhere? You think he’d offer to stitch anyone’s head? We grew up on the streets, stupid, it ain’t easy for him to trust people. Hell, he doesn’t fucking trust Bobby. And then just after I spend the night driving around with him, trying to convince him to at least try to trust you, you go and ruin everything by calling him stupid! Nice going, stupid.”
Dean pulled the car up to the kerb and put the brake on. Sam and Gabe were in the back making out and Cas was sleeping. Dean snorted a soft laugh at his boyfriend and then turned and whacked his brother over the back of the head. “We’re back, quit that shit and get outta my car.” He snapped, grinning cheekily.
“Maybe it’s a subconscious thing. Maybe you’re haunted by the dream as a substitute. You’ve always wanted someone who could be trusted to take care of us and protect us from shit like that. And Bobby’s offering that. Now, suddenly you’re dreaming again.”
“Oh, right, and it has nothing to do with the fact at that we have class with the Novak brothers right now?”
Ellen had learned to ignore his death stares in the last few weeks; she knew they weren’t a personal attack against her. They hurt, for sure, but they weren’t directed at her in a way that would imply she’d done something wrong. They had both lived a hard life, one without a tender parent. They’d been forced to grow up fighting for survival. Trust would be hard won on her part as far as they were concerned.
“We can get the school bus from around the corner. Or we can actually walk it. That stop is like the last one before school anyway.” Jo was saying as the car revved back into gear and sped off, screeching loudly.
“What do you need me to say, Dean? I think I’ve run out of advice for The Dream. You killed a man to protect me. He had his penis out and my pants down. Would you have done it differently?”
“Oh. Wow. That’s big. How’d they take it?” Dean asked, still completely focused on Castiel, trying to get his attention.
“Yeah, but I need to get out on the other side. I was sick here.” Cass explained, gesturing to the mess he’d made, just seconds before Gabriel stood in it.
“I’m leaving soon. Just waiting to see the doctor one last time.” Dean told her, kissing her hair as he spoke.
“You boys need a place to stay, we have a spare room if you would like to stay here.” Bobby offered as he appeared and took his seat, handing Sam and Dean a bottle of beer each.
After that, Garth led the procession of the ones on scene. The fire was out and there'd been only two more casualties. A young boy who had been trapped in a toilet, he suffered a broken wrist and minor burns. And a female teacher who had gone back into the building after she'd found out one of her students was missing.
“I am such an idiot. I knew she was up to something. I knew it, and I still let her get in that car with the bastard. He was too polite. He was too well behaved. I’m an idiot.”
If Cass wasn’t so horny he’d have realised that, yeah, of course Dean would be skittish about having anyone back there after what he’d endured. And with what he knew of Dean he could see how much it would take for him to develop that level of trust in a partner. He certainly wouldn’t just lay down and let it happen again without a fight either.
“I can live with that.” Cass said quickly. He was ignored, even though Dean did thrust forward a little bit and drop his head onto Castiel’s shoulder.
Benny, enraged at the fact that Sam and Dean were in this fight because of his sister’s careless mouth, rounded on her and dragged her to her feet, forcing her to face the squabbling pair on the ground when she tried to turn away from it. “You’ll fucking watch this, sister. Your careless mouth got them into this. This is what happens when you don’t bother to think about what you say and do.”
This drew Dean’s attention and with it, came the sharp slap across the back of the head and the savage punch to the arm. “You told them what? Tell me you didn’t.”
“Wrong, dick bag. You’re both as bad as Alistair Morningstar. If it’s not him, its one or both of you. I’ve had it. I want you to leave me alone.”
Dean was a true product of the streets; nothing came for free and all doctoring had to be done by your own hand, or you died. Survival of the fittest. There was no such thing as a weak homeless teen.
“Dean. No. Look around us, brother. We’re at school. He’s safe here. This isn’t the streets. He is not going to be pulled away from you, or from me. If you give him a knife you’re telling me that you don’t trust me with his safety.” Sam stepped up beside them, effectively blocking anyone’s view of what was being passed back and forth between his twin and Castiel.
There was no paramedic in the back with them since obviously they figured Dean would take care of any issue that arose while en route into the hospital. Cass was grateful since it meant they had a little bit of privacy to worry about their little girl.
This time, the scene would definitely end in his pants, if the steel rod down there at the moment was anything to go by.
Castiel squirmed and wriggled, trying to dislodge the intrusion, but Dean had anticipated that and held him down. “Shh. Its ok, the pain will stop soon. But it’s going to last longer if you keep tensing up. Relax and let me make you feel good.”
Dean nodded mutely and got out. He went down stairs and began breakfast for everyone, expecting Castiel to be finished by the time he was finished.
But he needn’t have bothered, because at that moment Summer’s doctor walked in after knocking quickly. Dean pulled away from Summer, turning to the doctor expectantly.
“What? Turned on? Very strenuously holding onto my restraint so that I don’t rip your clothes off and fuck you right here against this wall, voyeurs be damned? How much more obvious was I supposed to be?”
“I did not tell them anything! Not about that. How could you think I would ever tell anyone the one thing neither of us wants to get out? Huh? Damn it, Dean. That’s my trauma too, Dean. That happened to me as much as it happened to you.”
Dean chuckled darkly, which sent another shock of arousal straight to Castiel’s cock. “So, making you drop to your knees to suck me off in front of them wouldn’t be on your to do list right now?”
Dean sucked in a breath and the look in his eyes told Castiel he’d gotten the rise he’d been looking for.
For Hannah, it was obvious that these boys had no patience dealing with many other people. Their uncle had warned her that this might be the case due to certain circumstances, so she was prepared to show them more patience then she would otherwise show to a teenager who appeared to be rude and arrogant.
Cass watched his daughter’s reaction during the officer’s commentary with mounting horror. His daughter was lucky to be alive. He and his husband had been sleeping peacefully while their daughter had been involved in a police chase and the resulting car crash.
“Nothing!” Castiel snapped. “That’s the problem.” He muttered under his breath. It was obvious he wasn’t supposed to have heard it, but Dean was so attuned to everything Castiel did and said that it was impossible for him to not have heard it.
Gabriel gaped at him for a moment and then nodded. “I stood up to them and told them that Cass isn’t the only gay son they have and if they’re going to throw Cass out, they’d better throw me out too.”
Castiel could barely function and Dean wanted him to answer that? He forced out a weak nod and Dean chuckled again. “I told you I’d make you feel good, didn’t I? Castiel’s eyes rolled back into his head again and he lost all control of… everything.
Again, Dean tensed, his fists still bunched into fists, but tucked into his armpits, Cass didn’t notice them. Dean watched him wearily until they were toe to toe.
She didn’t know a lot about what their lives had been like before she was born, but she did know that they’d both been dealt a ‘shitty hand’. Her papa told her that much at least, because it had been a part of the speech he’d given her when trying to explain why he and Castiel tried so hard to shelter her from things like guys who thought it was funny to grope her after they ‘accidentally’ fell. Her uncle Sam did let slip one day that he and Pops had been adopted by Grandpa Bobby in their teens and implied all the ‘damage’ for her father had been done ‘in the years before that’.
Truth be told. He couldn’t guarantee he’d be inclined to put a stop to anything she had planned, even if he were there. Knowing his temper, he’d be just as likely to help her, if not, watch.
Dean turned to look his brother in the eye. “You got a good thing going here, Sammy, why would you leave with me?”
To her credit, Claire took her grounding with grace. She didn’t like having to choose between the bus and her brother, obviously, but she acknowledged that she’d done wrong and that it could have been a lot worse. After all, being a cop, Dean could have pushed for traffic charges, which would have led to some level of criminal prosecution, however minor.
But Dean was still self-conscious about his ADHD. And their father wasn’t around to care much, so that left the two pre-teens to muddle through. It was how they’d learned about their strengths and weaknesses – where they’d learned Dean’s strengths and weaknesses.
Lightning quick before anyone could register what he’d done he reached down and dragged the blade across Lucas’s cheek, once, twice, three times, and then once more. And then, with another two more cuts Sam stood back, and smiled crookedly at the tiny star shaped scar on the other teen’s cheek.
It took a moment for Sam’s calming influence to penetrate Dean’s rage-haze, but slowly he pulled the knife back and slipped it away in it’s place down by the centre console, where he kept it while he was driving. Once he’d turned to face the front again, his hands clenching and unclenching around the wheel, Sam turned to Jo. With a jerk of his head he gestured for her to get out.
Lucas looked up first. When he saw Castiel, he smirked, his face twisting into a predator that had found his prey. If he was paying attention, he’d have seen the same look in Dean’s eyes. And then, he did see Dean and the look went from predator about to feast, to prey wanting to hide. He grabbed hold of Uriel’s arm and by the other teen’s flinch, Dean knew it was going to leave a mark later.
Dean laughed uncontrollably when the Brit presented his to the teacher at the end of the class and then produced his own box; perfectly aligned on all sides, hinges of the door tightly screwed in place and the locking chamber in perfect working order.
“I said that to him to get rid of him. I did not say it for your ears to tell your brain to conceive the notion that I have to be paid to do it. If it makes you feel any better I lumped my own brother in with you; him, I protect for free.”
She stayed for a moment longer, asking more questions, but after a while it became clear that Dean and Cas didn't know any more than what they'd already told her.
“Hmm, it is why you married me, I guess.” Dean retorted, earning himself a swat on the ass. He chuckled and led his husband back to their room.
“Why were you sick?” Jo asked. “If you’re not feeling well, maybe we should ask Dean to take you back home so you can rest.” She added, following Gabe so she could help get Cass out.
“Because that ‘good thing’ ain’t worth shit if you’re not here with me, Dean. We’re brothers. More than that, we’re twins. We’ve never been without each other. And you were just gonna start now by leaving me? We’ve left foster homes that we loved because the other one hated it. And don’t tell me you haven’t. We stick together, no matter what. Remember? You and me against the world. That’s our mantra, right? So don’t sit there and tell me you were just going to leave me here because I ‘had a good thing here’.”
Before closing the door he leaned down and caught his husband’s lips with his, bracing his weight on the side of the car door so that he didn’t fall. “I’ll see you at home. Get some sleep.”
“Now you know how we got the label feral and wild. I bit his head off for saying it, but your friend, Benny, was right; if we can turn on each other… well, I guess it really does throw our sanity into question, doesn’t it? ‘Animals’, remember?” Sam told them before turning to heft his brother to his feet.
“Oh, yeah. He was at the club the first night we were here. Good times, him and me. Rode my monster like a champion little slut. Until he started getting pushy and you had to step in before I knifed his ass. Wait, you’re Lucas? The Lucas that did that to Castiel’s face? Ooooh, boy, are you in trouble. You think Dean beat your ass then. That’s nothing compared to what he’s going to do to you for messing up Castiel’s pretty little face. You know he held a knife to Alistair Morningstar’s throat for doing that to Castiel’s leg, right?” Sam said conversationally, stepping up beside his brother, gesturing towards Castiel, who had collected his crutches by now and was standing off to the side with Gabe and Jo and their friends.
“What are you watching?” He asked her, because if he didn’t say something his heart would burst out of his chest and splatter all over her beautiful face.
“You really think I’m going to let you have your first fuck in my car? With your leg all banged up like that?” Dean asked him.
"God. I can't get her fucking screams out of my head. And that damn beam... God. I swear it weighed more and more every time I tried to get it off of her. She'd tripped as the beam fell, it's why it only got her leg. God. If she'd been on her feet when it landed.... fuck. Fuck. Damn it, Cas, why? Why did it have to happen to our little girl?"
Dean watched him silently by the window. "Oh, please, playing this off like I'm the one whose going to be impossible. Look at you, fussing over how straight the blankets are. You're the mother hen." Dean teased. He leaned down to place a gentle kiss to Castiel's head.
So, either, these people really were so rich they didn’t care if they got robbed, or it was all fake.
Dean shrugged, his grin turning predatory. “Well, if its only been for a test drive it stands to reason it hasn’t been put through its paces and reached its full potential, don’t you agree?”
“We grew up on the street, Cass, we didn’t have the luxury of a doctor every time we got hurt. If our father was good for one thing it was teaching us ‘army field medicine’. And then you refused his next offer to take care of you when he said he’d carry you.”
“Shh. Just let me make you feel good.” Castiel murmured as he inched towards Dean’s lips. Their lips met and this time Dean was ready. His hand tangled in Castiel’s hair at the base of his skull, holding him in place as their tongues collided.
So, while Sam got their homework sorted, Dean set about creating the biggest sandwich he could. He started off with bread, a layer of cheese and ham, and then just got more ridiculous from there. He added a pork chop, which had been shredded from the bone, another piece of cheese, a burger patty, tomato sauce, another patty, mustard, more ham. Then on went another slice of bread, more ham, bacon, cheese, bacon – again, another patty, bacon and cheese, ham, another squirt of tomato sauce and more bacon. Finally, a last layer of ham and cheese and the third piece of bread went on top.
Constructing and destructing things – usually faces, or cars? Sure, just point him in the right direction and he’d have the task completed in no time. Dean had once constructed a shanty style hidey hole for them one night, the first winter after their father had died, out of rusted sheets of metal, the car, and some wood. They’d frozen their asses off, but they hadn’t died of frostbite, either. In fact, it had probably been one of the better ‘huts’ they’d slept in for a long time. And had never seen anything to match it since.
Cass and Gabe did end up staying that night. And Dean drove them to school in the morning, but he didn’t say anything to them, and they didn’t know what to say to him. They had just been witness to one of the most important moments of his life. A moment in which he’d totally flaked.
Dean nodded. “I’ll tell him what happened, but I might need you to tell him the whole story, and for that, I’m going to take a walk.”
After about fifteen minutes another doctor in blue scrubs entered the room and they had a conversation where Dean was clearly the subject. The pair approached him and Dean lifted his hands, because, duh, what else would they be looking for?
“She asked.” Cass shrugged. He folded his arms across his chest and leaned against the bench behind him.
“Why would you need a well hung man, you don’t bottom, so it’s not like they’d be getting it up there. Me? I don’t mind having it; waste not want not.”
“Nice to be here.” She retorted back, for which she received a slap to the back of her head from her other father, who had come in behind her without her knowing about it.
With no retort for that one Dean grunted and stomped off, up to bed, throwing, "ye comin?" over his shoulder.
“Well, she did break curfew. Even though she did have a reasonable, if not inexcusable, purpose. And since she was not driving the car when it crashed, and therefore had no control over the situation in terms of running from the police, I move to strike the charge from the record.”
After a while, a short British kid wearing an entirely black outfit sat down next to Dean and introduced himself before Jo could as Fergus Crowley. “My mother was Irish, which is where the name Fergus comes from, but I was born and raised in England before coming here. Mum’s a lawyer and her firm back in London promoted her and asked her to head up their Branch here in Austen. So, here I am. Oh, yeah, don’t ever call me Fergus. I only answer to Crowley, got it?”
Castiel’s face was a bloodied mess. One eye was already swollen shut and the other one had a giant gash above it; it would probably need stitches. His lip, too, was bleeding and his whole face looked like he’d been thrown face first into the gavel and then dragged behind a car. His shirt was ripped and there was a new hole in the knee of his jeans, so Dean could only imagine what other injuries his friend had.
“Get him out and up stairs, I’ll be in later.” Dean said after a while and it was then that Cass and Gabe realised they were outside of the Singer’s house. Sam looked into the back seat and nodded for Gabe to help his brother.
Dean looked conflicted, making one last attempt to hand the knife to Castiel, who stubbornly kept his hands glued to the handle of his crutches.
“Yeah, come on.” It would go without saying that Dean’s ‘watch my back’ may have been left unsaid as they approached to break up the fight, but it hung between them as loud and clear as the school bell. They’d reached a point in their lives that ‘watch my back’ was an instinct for them.
“So, it looks like the Winchesters have a new home for the next few days, at least.” He said tiredly, feeling justified when he felt more than heard Dean puff out a soft chuckle.
There was a response and the nurse gave Dean a satisfied look and directed him over to the one other bed in the room. She obviously didn't have anything with her since she hadn't known what she was responding to when Cas pressed the button, but she was a nurse and even without supplies to treat the wound, she still had a few tricks and tests she could do.
“How can you be so sure, Dean? You have fought tooth and nail to hold onto your lack of trust in the world. Aren’t you tired?”
“You have two choices. You can shut your mouth from now until you get to school, or you can get out and walk. But if you speak to me again I will break your face and you will be eating out of a straw for the rest of your high school life.” Dean didn’t raise his voice, if anything, he’d lowered it, but there was an edge to his tone, backed by the appearance of his ever available knife, his fist gripping the handle so tightly his knuckles had gone white, with the sharp blade laid out across the back centre piece of the front bench seat.
“Good to hear. I’m about to start dinner. It will be done at Six, so get whatever homework or activity done by then. Wash up, whatever. Bobby will be home about five thirty.”
“Yeah, but they don’t know that. To them, I’m just the kid with ADHD and no attention span to learn anything.”
Dean turned serious, all evidence of their nit-picking conversation just now gone. “I’m a jerk to everyone because no one has proven to me that they deserve to be treated differently. I’m a jerk to you because that’s how you let me blow off steam so that I don’t punch a wall or break someone’s face.”
“I am so tempted to slap you with it, you know that? What do you think I’ve used it for? It’s only ever been used on me, by me. Until now, no one knew I had it, much less played with it.”
“Hmm, what?” Dean turned to look at Castiel so that he wasn’t being rude, or whatever the ‘procedure’ was, and jumped a mile when he realised just how close Castiel was to his face.
“Nah, I’m thinking I’ma fuck you up, you ever come at me like that again. See, right now, the point of this blade is wedged between your second and third rib, one quick thrust, lung deflates, fills with blood. Two, maybe three, hours of excruciating pain before you eventually die. That’s if you don’t get to a hospital immediately. If you do, and you’re lucky enough to get an exceptional doctor who can drain the blood and reinflate your lung, it’s gonna be a bitch of a recovery for a few months. Ever break a rib, pal? I’ve had all of mine broken, all at once, a deflated lung is worse.”
“Not sure who you’re trying to poke with that display, but believe me, Castiel, you are playing with fire showing me that.” Dean warned him through gritted teeth.
“And we will deal with that. As we always do. But we do it together, and we don’t involve others, especially one who doesn’t fight, Dean. Look at him. Does he look like someone who knows how to stand up in a ring on his own? What do you think will happen if he pulls that on someone around here? He won’t be the one walking away, that’s what’s going to happen. Now put it away.”
“Alright, so, this afternoon, we’ll go and pick up a few things to get you through the week til your uncle gets here, yeah? You’re still staying with Jo’s parents?” Dean deliberately didn’t say Bobby or Ellen’s names; it felt too much like he was acknowledging their apparent relationship to him. Didn’t have to use the words aunt and uncle for them to be just that. And he wasn’t ready to call them anything of the sort just yet.
Not wanting to leave Castiel alone in case he hurt himself again Dean rushed his shower and hurried back down the stairs just as Castiel was pouring more batter into the waffle iron. “I told you that you didn’t have to do that.”
Sam shrugged again. “If by ‘a million’ you mean twenty four. Then yeah. We didn’t always stay with dad. Every now and then they’d track us down, we’d go and stay at another foster home, Dean would have to cut and run when things turned bad. We’d meet back up with dad and hit the road again. It went on for most of our lives. Then dad got himself deaded and we were split up. That was our last one. Dean booked it, dragged me away from my ‘new daddy’, a drug dealer who used his foster kids as drug mules. We disappeared from that one and decided we were better off on the streets. That’s where Bobby found us.”
“I have a few waffles in the waffle iron, but they’re not ready yet. Actually. Are you ok to watch them while I have a shower?”
“It’s mine. There’s no need to carry on like he’s holding a radioactive nuclear device. Jesus.” He snapped at Dean. And then, with as much grace and force as he could manage balancing at the top of the stairs on crutches, he shoulder barged Sam out of the road. Dean could see that Cas struggled to keep his feet under him as he struggled with his crutches on the stairs, but when he moved forward to help, Castiel simply glared at him.
Dean would have left it there, but he rather enjoyed seeing the lovely shade of puce that coloured the old bitch’s face the more he spoke, so, just to drive it home he added, “And why is that going to haunt you? Because they’re not ever going to fit into your perfect little world and when word gets out that your son is a pillow biting queer who chose cock over you, people are going to judge you. You’re gonna be the talk of the town for a long time to come, and not in a good way. Maybe people will even stop inviting you to social events. So, was I hoping to get a rise out of you by fondling him just now? Nah, not really. Nothing you could do or say against that display will ever match the years of delicious torment I’m going to get to see you go through later.”
Not long after she wondered over to find a seat Cas and Dean heard two more familiar voices approach them. This time it was no one from Dean's side.
Dean groaned and pressed Castiel’s hand harder against him. “Hmm, baby.” He mumbled around a wave of aroused dizziness.
“Because she tells us the same damn thing every afternoon. Like we’re idiots that need reminding every day to do the same thing. We’re not idiots, Sam. At least, you’re not. I hate being told what to do.”
“No. Leave him. He’ll only run further. So, when we were thirteen, we were put in this home where the parents sold their foster kids into the sex trade. Some of them were hired out to out-of-town johns who simply wanted a play while they were in town on business. Others, like Dean and I, were sent to the sick fucks with a twisted sense of ‘foreplay’, you know, like, blood play, mutilations, beatings, strangulation, that sort of thing. One day we came home to find our foster parents tied up and gagged in the kitchen. There was a group of about ten guys we’d never met before standing over them. One of them told us our foster parents owed them money and that to pay their dues, they’d basically sold me to them, like a sex toy. They were either going to kill me or make me their bitch. Pass me around amongst them and the rest of their gang back at their ‘den’. Dean went bat shit crazy. Killed one of them, hurt a few more. It took four of them to hold him down. The other two pinned me to a chair and held a gun to my head. They shot the woman in the head, to prove that it was loaded, and told Dean to choose. Either they would kill me, or they would put the gun in his hand and force him to do it himself. Instead, he told them they could fuck him, but they had to let me go first. Him, for me.”
The doctor had warned them that they might need to wake Summer out of the coma manually. So, when her hand twitched in his, it gave him the shock of his life. Up until that point he’d been sitting beside her bed – where he’d planted himself three days ago, only moving when he had to be with Dean in the other bed – his hand tucked into hers, reading case notes for one of the clients he and Sam were set to defend next week in court. He’d been so startled he threw the case file over his shoulder as he leaped to his feet. The file was forgotten almost immediately as he leaned forward to stroke his daughter’s face, smiling through his tears.
“Fine. Yeah. I guess I… yeah, ok. See you at school, Cassie.” Gabe stuttered before he followed Jo and got out of the car.
Dean shot the doctor an 'are you serious' look, dropping one burned hand to his knee, showing off his gear. "I'm a fire fighter. Its kinda my job description. This time it was a giant support beam. And it had a girl pinned under it. That one." Dean told him, pointing over to the bed where his daughter lay.
He led Cas over to where the ambulance was, the back doors wide open. Dean was sitting in the chair beside the stretcher, their daughter's hand clasped tightly in both of his and pressed against his lips. His dirty, soot covered face was streaked with tears and when he looked up to see Cas climb inside his shoulders shuddered with fresh ones and Cas pulled him into his body, pressing his face to Dean's jacket. He kissed it, allowing his lips to linger for a long moment, expressing his grief and sadness.
Cass was silent for a moment; not because he had to consider the question, but because he was trying not to visualise the scenario his husband had just painted for him. He’d once seen Jody lose her shit protecting her family, after a nutjob off of his schizophrenia medication stormed the primary school Claire, Alex and Jack were at. It had not ended well for the man. So for Dean to put himself in her place had the roles been reversed, it made Cass see his point of view; a cop can be professional and behave as the situation called for it. But. Make it personal, and all that went out the window.
And when Dean gasped in surprise but didn’t pull away, Cass slipped his tongue past Dean’s lips and met the green eyed teen’s own. This time Dean moaned and leaned forward, pressing their mouths together tightly.
When they got to school both sets of twins separated and Dean dragged his brother over to one of the outdoor tables in the courtyard where students ate lunch when it was warm and clear enough. He climbed into the table and sat down, his feet planted on the bench seat below him. Sam stood off to the edge and waited for whatever it was on Dean’s mind to work its way to his mouth.
Dean shrugged and dug around in the fridge for his brother’s coke, grabbing one for himself. He carried them and his over-the-top sandwich up to the room he shared with his twin and silently set the drink beside him. Sammy hated being distracted while he studied. He dug into his sandwich while he watched his brother work; there was something in the way Sam worked on his books that helped Dean pick up more by watching him than he ever could by listening to a teacher drone on about the subject in a classroom. His brother had a calming effect on him, too, so it helped when Sam had to explain what Dean didn’t understand.
“Why would he let himself go through all that? He knows how to fight, why wouldn’t he just fight back?”
“He didn’t always know how to fight back, Gabe. And he took the shit because of me. We’re not identical, obviously, so it wasn’t like they mistook him for me, or the other way around. They beat and abused him because he refused to let them do it to me.”
“That’s bullshit! You can read and write. In two different languages. And don’t say you don’t know what I’m talking about. Twin, remember? How stupid can you be if you can actually teach yourself to read, write and speak Chinese? Dude, they don’t even use letters. But you taught yourself.”
"I'm on my way." He hung up sharply and then ran the rest of the way to his brother in law's office. "SAM! Sam. I have to go. I have to cancel the meeting." He all but screamed as he entered the office.
“No problem. I can’t say I’m all that surprised. Being woken up at three in the morning. I probably would have done the same. Well, enjoy the rest of your night, sir.”
And now, here they were again, faced with a man who had offered them the one thing they wanted above everything else. The one thing they couldn’t trust to be real, or without strings attached.
By ten, they’d pretty much learned to be self-reliant, whether their father was present or not. In a hotel, they could cook basic meals to keep themselves fed. In the car they’d creep into outdoor dining restaurants and eat the leftovers from tables that had been vacated before the cleaning staff could come by and sweep everything back to the kitchens. In some of those cases, they’d been busted but when they’d been forced to give up the location of their ‘parents’ the staff had taken pity on them and given them food to take away, as long as they didn’t make a habit of stealing the ‘dregs’ of uneaten meals.
It did more than shut him up; he stood up, picked up his books and his bag and moved to another desk up the front.
All the while Dean was making a bee-line down Castiel’s body, straight for his cock, which he quickly pulled from his jeans and took into his mouth. It didn’t take long after that for Castiel to completely blank. And it wasn’t until Dean made the first push inside of him that Castiel’s mind came screeching back to reality. He grunted and then let out a small, muffled scream of pain.
Dean grunted a response not fit for Ellen’s ears and flopped down onto his bed, ignoring the looks he was getting – the bitch face from his brother and the barely concealed hurt from Ellen.
“Dean, I’m on crutches, how do you expect me to get there before you do? I can’t even get out of the car unaided.” Castiel whined.
The woman paused for a moment, apparently to take stock of what she was seeing. After a short hesitation she smiled, her attention zeroing in on her young patient. “Welcome back, Miss Winchester. I must say, this is a much better, more preferable vision. I’m Doctor Barnes. You can call me Pamela. I’m the pulmonologist assigned to your case. I had come in to prepare to wake you up, but I see that’s not needed now so I guess the plan now is for me to hand you over to the next doctor. Because now that you’re awake we can start working on healing that leg of yours so we can get you home. But, before I go and bring in the burns specialist do you have any questions?”
“You so much as breathe towards that door and I will gut you where you stand.” Dean murmured against Castiel’s collarbone.
Again, they asked a few more questions, but, like Ellen, wondered away when they didn't get anything new.
“Dunno. Guy was looking for a fight the moment the car pulled up. Asked me if I liked what I saw. Didn’t stop to think if he was talking about the car or the girl with him. I said no to both so he called me a fuckwad, of all things.”
“I’m Sam Winchester, this is my brother, Dean, we’ve just transferred. Are you Mister Monroe? The lady in the office said you’re our English teacher. She said to give you this to sign?” Sam handed over the sheet the office staff needed for the end of the day to mark their attendance.
“You were spoken to, young man.” Nor did Dean pay that one any attention. They’d both been trying to get some sort of response out of him from the moment they’d sat down and he’d taken up position at the door. Obviously they weren’t used to being ignored in favour of their sons.
“Nope. Bobby did it this morning while I was having a smoke out the back. Heard him talking about his ‘twins with the troubled youth who are staying with him’ to some bitch named Hannah.”
“I love you, dad.” She murmured into his neck as she tried with all her might to squeeze the life out of him.
It was at that moment that Sam walked into the room and Dean shoulder barged past him as he stormed out. “Trust him, you said, he likes you, you said. Bull fucking shit! I’m outta here. I don’t need that shit. Fuck you. Fuck you all!”
Dean didn’t expect anyone around here to know what that meant, but it had always been something he and his brother had done as they moved from town to town. They had a reputation, if you knew who to ask, if you didn’t know them by name, you knew them by reputation.
Sam cleared his throat, no retort on his tongue. Instead he rolled his eyes and pushed open the door to go inside.
It was a struggle, since obviously Sam wasn’t going to help, and Dean kept revving the engine like he was about to drive off whether Cass and Gabe were out of the car or not. Gabe was annoyed that Sam refused to help, but what he didn’t realise was that in sitting in his seat, Sam was actually keeping Dean from driving off. It also meant that when Dean did drive off, he had no choice but to take Sam with him.
“Tell your mum we said thank you. It will only be for another couple of days. Gabe rang our uncle last night and he’s making arrangements to come and get us.” Cass interjected.
He took another couple of minutes by himself to calm his own raging emotions before leaving the room to find his husband. They’d been in the process of laying out Claire’s ‘sentencing’ when Jody had rung. When he found them again, Claire was sitting in the lounge room, sulking morosely and Cas was in the kitchen just about to set the kettle back on its base after pouring two strong coffees, one of which he handed to Dean as he entered.
“Come on, lover boy, let’s go and see this granddaughter of mine.” Ellen told him, gently guiding him back inside so he could lead them to Summer’s room.
"Wait, what?" The nurse looked over at Dean in confusion and noticed that he had his hands under the water in the sink. She snatched one to look at it and gasped. Dean huffed an annoyed breath and shot Cas a bitchface to rival Sam.
“You let your sons drink alcohol?” Gabriel asked in utter shock, eyeing the bottle in Sam’s hand and the absolute professionalism in the way Sam removed the top.
Dean leaned back against the car, tucking one ankle over the other as he folded his arms across his chest. “Oh, yeah? What else she tell you?”
“Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, of course. Of course, I’m in. I’d never let you go into enemy territory alone.”
“Dude, we were thirteen, and there was a gun to my head. There were four of them, Dean. Even you couldn’t have fought that many off before they shot me.”
“I didn’t refuse his off… did I? I thought he was just being macho, or something… he really wanted to carry me everywhere? But, why would he do that? Not like I mean anything to him. I’m just… his friend, right?”
“In a few moments I’m gonna go get them out of the car, and then I’m gonna take them around to pack what they need; but first, my brother and I have a few words to say to you.” Sam added, pushing his way inside, a step ahead of Dean.
Finally, feeling himself get angry at himself, and frustrated that he couldn’t seem to get rid of this dream, he got up and headed for the bathroom. No one was ever up this early, so he didn’t bother to knock.
“Don’t! You don’t get to judge him. Not you. Before I let him up, get your sister the fuck out of our faces.”
Sam rolled his eyes and didn’t comment. Instead, he changed the subject; “So, these twins from school. They’d be Jo’s friends. You think she’d mind if I tried to get into Gabriel’s pants?”
They drove around for another hour or so before Dean finally turned the car around towards the house. When they got there Bobby was waiting for them on the porch. “Just checking to see if you boys got home ok, is all. One day, maybe you’ll feel comfortable enough to tell me what’s going on. But, right now Ellen’s got dinner ready, go wash up and get some grub.”
“The driver was killed. The car spun out of control on a slip of ice and smashed into a tree. The paramedics were concerned your daughter may have a concussion, which is why they wanted her to go to the hospital, but she refused. No one else was seriously hurt.”
Dean was a fighter, in the strongest sense of the word. Throw the guy into any situation and Sam would bet his brother would walk away from it, beat up, for sure, but definitely walking. Ok, maybe it would be more like limping, but still… his brother would come away from the situation on his own, anyone else would be carried away, himself included.
Sam’s return to the car shook Jo out of her head and she and the Novak twins fell into a conversation about yesterday’s History lesson. But none of them could ignore the tense silence emanating from the front. They tried very hard to ignore it, Jo and Castiel succeeded for the most part, but Gabe couldn’t stand it any longer and finally burst out, “So, Dean-o, want to tell us what happened yesterday?”
“Awww, come on, man. I know you’re new here so you wouldn’t know better. He’s a fucking faggot! And a fre…” Uriel didn’t get a chance to finish the word before he was spitting blood from his mouth all over the floor.
“Because you called him stupid. Dummy. Please, just talk to him. Let him talk to you. Please.” Here, Sam stopped and put Cass back on his feet, just inside the front door where they could both see Dean sitting in the car, looking so sad and beaten. “Please, I am begging you, Castiel. He is on the verge of leaving. And if he leaves, I leave with him. And I don’t want to leave. I like it here. And I like the people. Please. He needs to hear you tell him he’s not stupid, and that you do like him.”
“They should be ready in about a minute or two. Don’t worry about adding more to the iron if you don’t want to cook anything.”
"That's us." Everyone stood up and took a step forward, to the doctor's surprise. But Dean shot everyone a withering glare and, with Cas pressed to his side, walked forward.
Dean caught him and held him tightly. Cass barely managed to suppress a sob, but the fact that he clung tighter to Dean’s shirt told the firefighter that he was crying, and his arms wrapped tighter. Dean had gotten his grief out at the scene, now it was Cass’s turn.
“She said you were detailed. She said she knew.” Dean argued, not ready to let his anger go just yet, but he’d stopped wailing on his brother, so that was a plus.
Summer nodded and leaned forward, positioning herself so that the doctor could reach her chest. As the woman began her exam Summer glanced up to see her parents leaning into each other at the foot of her hospital bed, as usual her pops had a tight grip on her father, like he was trying to hold him up.
“You’ve already pissed my brother off by going after Castiel. And when my brother is pissed off, I get pissed off. And one thing you don’t do on the streets, is piss off a Winchester. Congratulations, you’ve pissed off both of them. That’s our family. We may not share blood, but they are. We protect our own. Now, normally I leave the fighting up to Dean. He’s the blood thirsty one of us. But as I said, you’ve pissed me off. So, I’m only going to say this once; and so help me god, it better sink in because the next time we have this conversation, it won’t be done with polite words.”
And Dean told her everything Claire had told him about his adopted niece’s boyfriend. He spoke like he was speaking to the family of a person who had been the victim of a violent crime, informing her of details he thought she needed to know in order to answer the questions that he had to ask her in a few moments.
The first thing he said to Dean once he was in the car and had given him the plate he’d walked out with was, “You know Cas didn’t mean what he said in there, right?”
“Dean!” Sam bit out warningly. He didn’t move, didn’t react in any way to suggest Dean was about to go bat shit nuts, simply called his name, but he’d tensed up and if no one else noticed, Dean had.
Dean blushed and glared at the floor. He couldn’t stitch the guy’s head, and now he wasn’t strong enough to carry him around? Of course not. Not like he was anything to Castiel.
Dean wasn’t as hard assed and violent as he pretended to be. But then again, Summer was a special case. She was his daughter for one, and like any other ‘Big Bear’ dad, Dean was overprotective. And nothing set off an overprotective father like finding out his daughter was being sexually harassed at school. Summer not being ‘good enough to play’ just because she was a girl was just one issue in a long line of problems the poor kid endured. They’d offered to pull her out and send her somewhere else, but she refused to give them that satisfaction.
“Alright, now. Since her treatment can’t begin right away, let’s say we look at those hands of yours. You’re right, they are third degree burns. Which is to be expected, your daughter at least had jeans to protect her leg. I understand you had nothing, correct?”
Castiel nodded. “I know…” He trailed off, leaving Summer to wonder what he left unsaid as she reached out to hug him. She didn’t like thinking her parents might be suffering in their own ways because of her injury so she reached out and grabbed him by the arm and yanked, meaning for him to lean in so she could hug him. But he wasn’t expecting the tug, apparently, and he had to throw out his other hand to catch himself so he didn’t fall on top of her.
Cas snatched the dildo out of Sam’s hand and tossed it into the backpack he’d slung across the front of his chest to make for easier handling with the crutches. Jo had been helping him with any boxes he had, which left him with only bags he could carry over his shoulder, while Sam and Gabe had been working together. This had left Dean at a loss as to how to help at first until it became obvious that the Novaks clearly needed babysitting to prevent them from interfering.
“The hell we don’t! Spill! Have they ever hit you? Abuse you in any way? Just tell me and I’ll make it right.” Dean vowed.
“So, I’ll just run a few errands and then be waiting for you in bed, wearing nothing but a boner and a set of beads in my ass?” Castiel smirked.
“I wanted to apologise. I didn’t mean to be so cruel about calling you stupid. Had I known it would cause you such grief, I wouldn’t have said it at all.”
The officer nodded and then he left and Dean closed the door. “Go on up to bed, Claire. We will discuss your reasons for being out after curfew and why you thought it was a good idea to get into a car being chased by police in the morning.”
“…She’s still got a few issues; like I said, don’t be alarmed if she develops asthma later. And I wouldn’t recommend she do any sports for a while, even after her leg is all healed, her lungs probably won’t be up to one hundred per cent capacity for some time.” The doctor was saying when Summer tuned back into the conversation, focus now completely on her father’s hands.
By now Cass was out and propped up against the back panel of the car, he raised his eyes to look at Dean, but Dean wouldn’t look at him and Cass realised that Dean was waiting for him to go spilling everything to her and his brother. He looked back at Jo. “Really, Jo, I’m fine. Honest.”
“I will cut you, if you even so much as think about throwing that filthy thing at me, I swear, twin or not, your ass will be minced meat if that thing comes near me.”
Dean got up and dumped his tray and found that Cass had got up with him and they walked out together, talking about how Dean had gotten to be so protective of his brother and how he’d learned these fighting skills he’d been hearing about.
"I swear, I'm already on it." She told him, pulling out her phone as she began to walk away, dragging Greg by the shirt sleeve - not stupid enough to leave him alone with Dean as worked up as he was.
“Yes! It is! You called him stupid. He’s not book smart like you. But that doesn’t mean he’s stupid, stupid!  If there is one word that could get Dean’s temper to flare it’s that one. Good luck in trying to get him to like you after this.”
They were silent for the rest of the ride home. Unfortunately that also meant a ten minute walk from the bus stop closest to Jo’s house and Castiel was already in a lot of pain from the bumpy bus ride.
“It’s the name we use for doctors that specialize in the respiratory system. In your case, being trapped under that beam caused you to inhale more smoke than anyone else. It means that your lungs were severely burned. We had to put you into a deep sleep to give them time to heal.”
“God damn Charlie and her big bloody mouth.” Jo snapped, watching Cass struggle to get comfortable, leaving her and Gabriel to stand in the aisle close by.
As soon as she was upstairs and out of ear shot Dean turned to go back into the lounge room, where he promptly began to pace in front of the couch where Cass was sitting.
“You like LARPing too? My brother is a huge fan.” Sam told the girl, gesturing to Dean, who took a page out of his twin’s book and shot him the severest bitch face he could muster up.
“Hear tell she needs some girl time while her parents run off for a little Up Time.” Jo couldn’t resist, despite her mother’s scolding.
Dean was pissed. Gabe had accidentally let slip at breakfast that morning what had happened at school the day before with Castiel’s face.
Dean turned to smirk over his shoulder when he felt Castiel press in behind him and mouth at his neck.
Cas nodded. “Yeah. That was Jo’s birthday sleep over, remember? She wanted you and Sam to join in, but you both refused. You’d only been there about a week or so, I think she said.”
“Well, as long as those girls don’t have an excuse to join our table at lunch, I’m all good. That,” Crowley pointed over to where Gabe was now inspecting a nasty looking cut on his brother’s hand while the teacher, Mister Garrison, rushed over with the first aid kit, “That, however, even I don’t work that hard for my meals.”
“Don’t play dumb. You know perfectly well who the fuck I am. You’ve met my fists before. Haven’t you, cockrider671? How ironic that we meet again, and this time, it’s my boyfriend that you’re in trouble over. My brother said to give you this, by the way.” And Dean punched him in the face again. This time, like some grisly display of a squished banana being popped from its peel, Lucas’s nose had suddenly been spread across his face, which was smeared with blood.
Dean’s face crumbled into a look of pure disgust. “You will be taking a swim in a shit ton of antigerm everything before you put even a single toe inside my car. What the actual fuck dude! Why are you even touching it?”
The Impala pulled into a park and idled for a moment, purring like a beautiful animal. The two teens sitting inside it looked up at the building in front of them with the same sense of foreboding. They hadn’t gone to school in at least four years. Not since the death of their father presented them with more important challenges… like the effort to survive through the day, one day at a time.
“The girl? No. Not really. The car? Definitely not. They’re both dressed up too much. Give me a classic muscle car any day.” Dean answered honestly. He was going to get into a fight with this guy no matter what he said, may as well be honest.
Dean grunted. He closed the boot and walked around to the front and got in behind the wheel. “Didn’t think you’d leave with me.”
Dean’s face wasn’t any better, either. It was all black and blue, and his nose looked like it might have been broken and then reset. More split lip, even more lacerations, both eyes as black as night, not to mention blood smeared through his hair.
Cas took Dean, by the wrists, gently, and led him over to the sink to run cold water over them before moving to the bed to call the nurse.
Dean stopped his actions to give Castiel a chance to ease back into it and then at last Dean began moving again, and this time, Castiel was singing. With every thrust inside of him, Castiel could see stars and moaned louder and louder.
“Oh. Yeah, right, of course. Sorry.” Dean made a few movements, not looking at Castiel as he stood and tried to get Cass into the car gently. He threw the rag in for Cass and then walked around to the driver’s side and got in. He heard Gabe get in the back with his twin and Sam climbed in the front with him.
“Don’t you speak to your father like that. Not after the stunt you pulled this morning.” Dean snapped at her.
“I’m glad you boys came back. Jo told me what had happened. I want you to know, that door is always going to be open, I don’t care what happens that makes you want to walk out of it, it will never be closed when you come back. Anyway. That’s all I have to say.” The old Crank told them, putting enough emotion and force into his words that even Dean could see he was genuine and spoke from the heart.
Cas groaned and rolled over. His bleary eyes caught a glimpse of the clock, even as another knock sounded at the door. “Dean. Dean, there’s someone at the door.”
“Correction, they love the money you throw at them to look the other way. How many DUI’s have you paid to sweep under the rug this month alone? Twelve, just, so you know. And, how much did it cost you to have that gym shut down? What’d you call it, ‘a disgraceful display of skin and sexual deviance’. I tell you, I read about that one and I had to wonder how you managed to have kids, being such a high strung prude, I mean, what you do, did you just make your husband jizz in a cup and then squirt it up there with a turkey baster? And, how about that park down the street, didn’t you buy off the city workers to walk off that job and come and do your back yard? I saw that by the way, it looks stunning right now. Imagine what could happen if someone came through some time in the night and covered it with a shit ton of herbicide, say, like glyphosate. Hell, it could even be done with vinegar, Epsom salts and some dish washing detergent. All of which, you happen to have right there in the cupboard over there.”
Dean deepened the kissed and pressed his full body weight down onto Castiel. Castiel’s hands slid up and under Dean’s shirt, over the ridges of his stomach, over his pectoral plate, scraping his nipples. Dean thrust his cock against Castiel’s own bulging pants, serving as a reminder that they were both still clothed. Castiel’s hands flew down to begin unbuckling Dean’s belt and jeans.
That said Dean and Sam both turned away and headed towards their friends like nothing had just happened. Gabe was staring, open mouthed at Sam and Castiel was only minutely better at hiding his shock.
The difference was that Jody was a cop too. She knew the procedure. That didn’t stop her from reacting the way a mother would after discovering her daughter was being beaten.
“She’s not going to kill the kid, if that’s what you’re thinking! Even if she did vow to do exactly that. I am worried she will track him down and react like a mother defending her child, rather than a cop. And now, more than ever, she does need to deal with this like a cop; build the case against him to put him away and make sure he never hurts anyone, much less Alex, ever again.”
For the second time that morning, Sam’s retort died on his tongue. He nodded. “Yeah. I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, though. I’d really like to have at least one more person in my life that I can trust.”
“Please, pretend I don’t care about you and Novak getting it on. In fact, don’t pretend. You’re a great guy, and Castiel is a very good friend, but seriously, it is not my idea of fun.”
Try man handling a drunken and unresponsive John Winchester in, and then out, of the car with one hand while trying to keep your barely conscious twin from bleeding out from a knife wound to the gut with the other. They’d been, maybe nine? Ten? At the time. And what fun that had been with Dean trying to drive the car to the hospital.
It was the same when it came to surviving the streets; Sammy could fight. He was a mean fighter, for sure. But Sam could never match his brother in hand to hand, just as Dean could never match Sam in school. Dean was brutal, savage, vicious, and unrelenting when it came to surviving on the streets.
“Adoption papers of your mother when she was brought into my parents’ home. I was about ten at the time.”
“Your lungs sound good. Not great, but enough to make me happy. I’ll go and get the other doctor so you can talk to him about your leg.” Doctor Pamela said then, patting Summer’s shoulder to indicate that she could sit back and relax now.
But Dean, in his worked up state, didn’t think of that. He was thinking as a parent with an injured child by his side, not as a professional who had to hand off patients to someone better qualified to take control. So when the nurse asked Jo to talk, Dean snapped at her and began talking over Jo. "Why are you asking her? It's me you should be..."
Their conversation dropped off as they began to re-focus on their metal projects. Something about making a metal lock box, according to the teacher. Crowley’s project looked somewhat in the range of ‘box’, though one that might have been run over by a Mack truck a couple times before being dropped over the side of a cliff.
Suddenly a body pressed into Dean's chest and his husband buried his face into his shirt, his own silent tears wetting the material. Dean tilted his head down and tucked his nose into the crook of Castiel's neck as their arms wound around each other.
Alistair nodded vehemently and Dean removed the blade from his throat. He stepped back and then shoved the other teen away from Castiel, in the direction of where his brother would see to it that he vacated the vicinity without further dramas.
Castiel's legs gave out and Dean's quick reflexes caught him before he hit the ground. He turned to pull the lawyer into his chest and held him tightly.
“Well, why the hell are we still sitting here, get me up to the room, you bastard, and stop teasing me.”
"Dean!" Cas snapped sharply. "You're wearing your firefighting gear. How was this poor nurse to know you are also a paramedic? Calm down and be a professional about this. Right now you cannot be here as Summer's parent. You need calm your shit and let the hospital staff work. Now come over here and help me. I think I'm going to be sick."
At least. They did, until a group of fire fighters from another station house showed up, and one by one they stopped in front of Dean to pay their respects. One, a big guy, about Benny's size, introduced himself as David, stopped and actually spoke to both Dean and Cas for a few moments. He said his wife, Kim, would kick his backside if he didn't at least come and show his respect, regardless of the fact that Dean wasn't on his truck, Dean was a fire fighter, and that counted.
“Cass is sensitive about the Novaks.” Gabe told them. “He’s suffered the most at their hands but he still takes it personally every time they attack him.”
“Ah huh. And what if I was to tell you their parents are religious fucks who bible bash homophobic bullshit into their fucking skulls?”
Finally Cass burst out with an annoyed grunt and shoved at Dean’s chest. “Get me to the hospital, you idiot. They’ll do it.”
The two paramedics jumped in surprise and turned to see Dean standing in front of them, a hard gleam in his eye. In that moment, that look, Jo knew her brother had heard their conversation. She gulped and immediately began to apologise.
