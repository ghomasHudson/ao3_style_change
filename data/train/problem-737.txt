“We can talk more about this at a certain date, you intrigue me, Watson”.
‘Where am I going to find a doctor on short notice...oh no, this is terrible!’ The voice exclaimed, the large man pulling his shirt sleeve over his watch, Watson couldn’t help but let out a tiny snicker. A doctor was simply a feet away, and maybe it was coincidence...or karma that he got a phone call.
‘I shouldn’t have left those two alone in there’ A voice similar to Lestrade’s rang through Watson’s ear, he seemed like a very collected man but he noticed the underlying stress through his thoughts voice. Another voice, however, was yelling, loud and it pierced through his temples, the voice was subdued however due to the wall but he was dreading to hear it behind the door.
“I don’t think it should be removed, he’ll more than likely die from blood loss…” John informed, seeing the reflective surface of the bullet penetrated deeply in the thigh, though there was a part that didn’t reflect. Was it a risk to delve in and try to find what it was? A hundred percent, but if this was a case of evidence, he truly had no choice.
He remembered the concentrate as an increasingly loud voice pierced his ears, it came from behind him, from the other detective. He ignored it, however, placing the tweezers down on the table and proceeded to disinfect the wound, hearing the shuffle of feet around him, and the muttered quarrel between the woman and man.
“We’ll be outside the station, yeah, speak to him? Oh, okay” He pulled the phone away, handing it to Watson.
“Hello? Who are you?” Watson questioned, looking the man up and down to inspect, he seemed normal enough. A white button up held his large stomach in, while the bottom bulged out through his trousers, the inner thigh seams seemed to be holding on for dear life. “Harry Stannford, I couldn’t help but overhear you refer to yourself as a doctor, is that true?” He asked, the train doors beginning to open but Watson remained on the platform to hear this desperate man out. Watson nodded, a relieved smile spread across Stannford’s face, and a sigh of relief as well.
was the one that started Turning them.
He did growl now. “It’s a rerun, Mrs. Hudson, and you know it! The woman’s been dead for years!”
34 ACRE AVENUE
” Morris reiterated, her eyebrows raised to her hairline.
“He was human,” the consulting detective stated. “There is a second, fainter scent in this room. It’s mundane but is tinged with gunpowder. Gunpowder, cedar....wolfsbane.”
. Opting for honesty, he said, “Well, it was nice to think of you when I wasn’t busy worrying about my other responsibilities that come with the Moon.” He paused before uttering the dreaded words. “Imogen, we need to talk about something.”
“And I don’t plan to!
“Cheers,” the tall man said with a bright smile before he captured her hand and placed another kiss, barely firmer than a breath, onto it. “Good night.” With one last smile, he turned and headed for the stairs.
He then went to the man’s current job and found no one there that fit the stature of the killer. He also found that none of the coworkers found him to be hard to get along with but they generally avoided him. A lonely existence outside of Baskerville and the Full Moon, apparently. If it hadn’t been for the obvious, he would have ruled the murder a suicide.
The other man nodded, rising slowly from his seated position on the couch. He spun on his heel, already feeling the familiar ache in his bones as the moon sang to him, calling him into his other form.
“Is it bad that I am more nervous now than I was when I Shifted in front of Parliament?” he asked, laughing nervously as he stood and smoothed his suit. His hand stopped over the bump in his shirt, his fingers closing around it nervously. As an afterthought, he pulled the lump from beneath his shirt and let his tags hang over his tie. He was done hiding.
Evelyn set the pot in the middle of the table without spilling a single drop. She beamed at him, quirking an eyebrow. “Yes, yes,” he exhaled. “You did a fine job, Evelyn. Your father will appreciate that you are learning to cook. It will save him some time.”
She smiled, allowing her teeth to be exposed. “I’d love to see him.”
Praying that she was given some shred of privacy tomorrow when she was in with the man, she readied herself for bed and a rather uneasy night’s sleep.
As their steps, echoing about the linoleum, brought them towards the main entrance. The mingled odor of thirty humans with their recent meals, over-priced perfumes, and stale cigarettes caused his nostrils to flare at the cacophony. It reminded him of London, of the countless cities he had dwelt in for a time, and of the life that surrounded him in the steel jungles of the world.
Sherrinford was positively snarling, not pleased with their older sibling’s statement.
He opened the door, looking his eldest sibling in the eyes blearily. “I’ll join him. I’m not talking to Mum.”
“You too, Mycroft,” she said softly, a small smile on her lips. “I am looking forward to working an end to this discrimination that my family has only helped to advance.”
A nurse pushed him back at the surgery doors. “Take care of him! Please!” He collapsed, unable to support himself anymore, his hands shaking uncontrollably. "
She knew that she was trembling now, her mouth open and her eyes wide. She knew that the plan they had worked so hard on had vanished. She knew that her family had never intended to give her the opportunity to kill Sherrinford Holmes. She had been the bait, the person to draw him there, and nothing more.
The younger man shook his head once. “Meet up after - just to be sure.”
“Me? Ridiculous?” he snorted. “What a notion!” He stopped, his ears pricking up at the sound of John’s steady and reliable footsteps on the sidewalk. “Get the bread out of the oven before it burns. Your father’s home.”
He looked about the assembled Pack members, pleased that nearly everyone was here. Mrs. Hudson was really the only absent member as Lestrade was on speaker phone. “What happened?” he asked, his eyes fixed on Mycroft.
he chided, trying to push his sliver of uncertainty away.
Shifting a bit in his chair, the natural born wolf replied, “Soon, Molly. Very soon, I think.” His eyes traveled to the rounded stomach that punched upwards like a beach ball. “What are your plans for the birth? Hospital?”
“Yes, I can smell the raw steaks.” The veterinarian turned to face him with a large smile on his face. “Brilliant. Especially if we’re not getting out tonight.”
A small uproar raced through the listening Wolves, fear filtering through their scent. He raised his hands again, this time as a means to silence them. “I will be with them all night, as will Mycroft Holmes, our main advocate in the government. If you do not wish to be observed, I suggest that you Shift and exit into your enclosures prior to sundown. They will be making the rounds shortly after that. I am hoping that you will join me in welcoming them and showing them that we are
Sherlock sighed, ruffling his hair thoughtfully. He didn’t mind the laws. He knew that they irked Sherrinford, who didn’t understand the need for laws governing wolves. He just viewed his natural inclinations as what should be (
Evelyn came bounding back into the room, tugging an already tired looking John behind her. “When can we see the werewolves, Uncle Mycroft?” she asked excitedly.
Sherlock waved him away, already fascinated by the month old Pup and his tiny appendages. “Grab my mobile and my measuring stick while you’re out!” the detective called, completely unaware that both items sat on his bedside table.
. “I’m just a bit too large for this chair, darling,” the woman groaned, rubbing her stomach. “That’s all.” Mycroft didn’t look so sure but he smiled anyway. “Uncle Sherrinford is here to be with you when the babies come. And he’ll be staying with us for a while - if that’s alright with you?”
“She doesn’t know about us,” he stated, knowing it to be fact even as a thrill of fear raced through him.
. “He’s Mycroft’s.”
“I was shot leaving my short stay in the finest penitentiary Britain has to offer - which I’m sure made international news, along with my release from hospital - so I can assure you that I am at least on their radar. More importantly, I know I am their next target because my killer came to visit me while I was incarcerated.”
The domesticity of it all made him smile.
“John?” he asked, looking up from his musings, concern perforating his features. “Is everything alright?”
“I’m sure that could be arranged, Evy,” her father stated from the stove, giving her adoptive father a look. She beamed, glad to have her ‘dog,’ though she’d never tell her father that.
“I hope that he’s thought this through,” he breathed, allowing the sentiment to slip through his lips as he hung up on his brother.
“Turn it off,” he muttered, throwing a hand over his eyes, “I’ve seen enough.”
“Thank you, Brother Mine,” he muttered, “It’s getting harder to hide. I’m not sure how Sherrinford does it.”
“Nah,” the short man responded as other shook their heads. “Stevenson was our Omega - he got along well with everyone.”
escape?”
After an hour of staring, he pulled his robe off and shook himself onto four legs. Shifting did nothing to stop his whirling thoughts - it hadn’t for a long time. He was focused on what was coming, on what his brother had done. Taking the step from the shadows and into the glaring light might have given Sherrinford freedom to be himself but it felt like he was being further restrained. After all, the Holmes family had a reputation to uphold and one monster was more than enough for the public to handle. Having two sons and a grandson mucking about on four legs would ruin everything that his posh parents had created and it would ruin Mycroft and his powerful career.
“It will come to light eventually,” the other man said, wriggling in the chair again, his nostrils flaring.
He growled again. It sounded weak in his human voice and it made him grind his teeth in frustration.
He shook his head. He could use a couple of hours of sleep, too. Lord knew that he’d barely be sleeping when the twins came.
But, the moment he had opened the door the most beautiful, delicious, and miraculous aroma flooded his senses and all thoughts of truly focusing on his niece were gone. The bouquet’s source was a small, finely boned woman with jet black hair and enchanting green eyes. She was dressed smartly in a slate grey blouse and a black pencil skirt that stopped just below her knee.
is mad.” He closed his eyes and inhaled slowly, regaining his composure. “
“Found it!” called Lestrade, rushing over, needle full of tranquilizer held aloft.
Blue eyes, widened, blinking at him as her breath became shallow. Afraid that he had frightened her, he flattened his ears against his skull and tenderly licked her fingers. Her brow furrowed and she murmured, “Uncle Sherrinford?”
,” he gritted out between his teeth, “
He couldn’t stop pacing. He never could when he knew that his baby brothers were running about the moor. While his Werewolf Registry protected wolves when they ran free, it was public knowledge that the Turned remained in captivity during the Moon. To find a Wolf running free would stir national, nay international, panic and for it to be discovered that it was Sherlock and Sherrinford Holmes, the trouble-making brothers of Mycroft with his
The statesman smiled and sat with a sigh on his sofa, releasing the odor of sugar and old books into the flat. “We, Molly and myself, will be coming with you to Baskerville in a few days,” he said, digging the tip of his umbrella into the carpet. “Sherrinford-” he paused, eyes finding the natural born wolf wrapped in a towel exiting the loo before continuing, “Sherrinford has discovered that Molly is carrying a natural born Wolf and we want to be near to-to...when it happens.”
He awoke to the sound of a fussy infant, his voice shrill and needy. His sight had blessedly returned and he used the sense to follow Molly’s journey around his sickbed and to his side. Thomas was held in her arms, thrashing about unhappily in his blankets. The woman, seeing that he was awake, smiled at him, her eyes wide and terrified. “He’s been upset all day. I really don’t know why.”
The older man chuckled as well, the action making the baby protest.
he wondered, smirking slightly.
“We’ll have to see.”
He inhaled deeply, his lungs filling with the distinct odors of London, his beloved home. While it was nice to get away to the wide open spaces of the countryside of Oxford, he was even happier to be back where his heart truly lay. Glancing to his left, he found his Mate, his blue-grey eyes closed even as a small smile played on his lips. They had had an interesting trip, their relationship moving a new direction that gave him an intense emotional response that he could only describe as overwhelmingly protective and possessive. A soft growl rumbled in his chest, making John’s smile twitch into an even bigger grin. “Happy to be back in London?”
, she realized, tucking the odd information away to dissect later.
Biting his lips, he broke eye contact with the grey-haired man. “I think that you and Sherlock could fix that issue,” he breathed, flushing. “But everything will be fine, John.” His eyes flickered upward to capture John’s equally grey eyes. “You are ready.”
“She’s worried about you, of course, but she’s been keeping up with her school work. I’ve been taking care of her for you, though she’s really been taking care of herself - she’s quite a remarkable young woman, John.” He smiled broadly, lips closed. “Would you like to see her?”
. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Imogen. He trusted her with everything that he was and more. It was her family that he didn’t trust. He had flashbacks of his life with his adopted father, moving every three to four months, being chased by Hunters.
“You have been living with this condition for five years now, Eddie,” he said quietly, calmly, trying to calm the man down. “It is unfortunate that it should happen to you, but it has happened and now we must deal with the consequences. Might I recommend a human doctor to you? I am only the Baskerville veterinarian. I am not well-versed in the medical needs of humans more so than you are. (
). He continued his explanation, “I’m on patrol, not sure how it happened. He killed one and Bit four. Five good men - lives changed forever.”
“How did they handle you?” John’s question was pertinent, but surprised him nonetheless.
, he flinched, his nose already regretting the coming hours. Pulling a professional smile on his lips and slowing his stride just a tad, he entered the fray.
“So you can trace it out of here?” he asked, gaining hope.
_ _ _ _ _
The younger man swallowed visibly. “What are my options?”
Sherlock shook his head, fringe falling across his brow.
“And she’s my Mate,” Sherrinford breathed. He could hear the man’s devotion and commitment to the woman in that statement. “We’ve pledged ourselves to each other. She accepts me as I am, and she loves me. As I love her.”
“You have an incredible home,” he stated, his voice hushed as his eyes continued to rove about the foyer.
Gesturing Imogen into the Red Lion with a bit of a bow, he turned to face the Turned wolf. “Sherlock,” he grumbled, peeling his upper lips back a bit to reveal his teeth, “Back. Off. I do not need a
) running about the place.
“Away from the River House, I see,” the man continued, ignoring his statement. “Coming to protect your
, he panted jovially,
“Sherrinford?” he murmured, knowing that, if the younger man was awake, he would hear; his hearing was impeccably sharp. “My office, as soon as you are able.”
She smiled thinking about everything that her family had gone through and everything that had advanced the Lupus sapiens to their equality with the normal humans (
He would give the man his privacy, his gaze flickering to the front seats where Mycroft and a very pregnant Molly sat. Molly’s hand rested on her abdomen, stroking it tenderly through the light jacket that she was wearing. His elder brother, the Ice Man, had foregone his nickname to grab his wife’s hand, his thumb stroking the soft skin there as he drove.
“Oh, good,” Evelyn chimed in, “I’m glad you’re awake, Uncle Ford!” The girl smiled at him, offering a hand. He placed his head beneath it, allowing her fingers to play through the soft, short fur there as well as over his ears, which she tugged playfully. “I’ve taken a side. And I’d like you to come to the debate. If Ms. Crowley is alright with it.”
). She lay on top of him, her stomach covering his back, her arms wrapped around his neck.
The smirk twitched into a genuine beaming smile which gave him a split second to brace himself for the incoming impact. The young woman flung herself into their arms, wrapping them close together in her unbridled joy. He pulled her close, inhaling her wonderful aroma of fresh-cut grass, crayons, vanilla, gun powder and a bit of his own scent of chemical compounds. It was the most wonderful scent in the world in his (admittedly) love-addled mind. Unable to stop himself, he pressed a gentle kiss into the top of her head before turning his head to capture his Mate’s lips.
can handle that,” he muttered, rolling his eyes with a huff. He had several patients that refused to reconcile their wolf with themselves. Their Wolves would not take well to being surrounded by thirty, potentially hostile, politicians. “We can pick and choose. Most of the problem cases will be in their enclosures where they can only be viewed from a distance or via CCTV.”
He did enjoy the thrill of the chase but neither of them were young anymore. His shoulder throbbed when the temperature dropped below sixty degrees. His newest scar, courtesy of St. Pierre, was still pink and puckered like it was just healed - which it had - and pained him on a regular basis when he tried to reach over his head. If he had any trace of Wolf within him, he figured that he wouldn’t have a trace of the Bite on his shoulder.
Placing that thought at the back of his mind, Sherrinford refocused. He gave them, especially Evelyn, whom he had missed desperately, a soft smile before rushing past to stop the over-eager elder pair of twins.
She was horrified, her eyes fixed on the telly and the only thing the news reporters seemed able to talk about. Her...well, she didn’t even know if he was her boyfriend...watching his strong, lithe body break itself into the furred form that she had never seen but had suspected. “Oh, Sherrinford,” she breathed, her hand over her mouth, her eyes wide and filled with unshed tears. “Why?”
Progress was slow. The filthy water and thick waste slowing their already tired steps. John plowed ahead, his torch lighting the walls eerily, casting long shadows. His own torch, held along his gun barrel, only revealed tributary tunnels, rats, and piles of shit. “We should check these smaller side tunnels,” he muttered to the two men beside him, knowing that the tunnel would carry his soft statement to the Wolves. “If I was hiding, I’d be in one of those, not in the main drag.”
It was then, as he chased behind the pair of four-legged men through the streets of London, that he realized that he
“Wonderful!” Sherrinford continued, “I will see you in about an hour.”
He slipped into his elder brother’s study, and closed the door until only a sliver remained, enough to stick his muzzle through to escape the room. The Goddess was beginning to rise, he could feel the roiling in his blood, his muscles and bones aching for the release they received with the aid of the Moon. He stripped quickly, folding his clothes neatly and placing them onto a chair. All except his tags, which hung, as they always did, warm against his chest.
“Besides,” the doctor continued, taking a seat in his comfy arm chair, “You’re Registered but not on the public Registry, knowing Mycroft. Neither is Sherrinford, and Thomas won’t be either. Thanks to Mycroft I’m sure.”
“Or we can crash at mine,” Sherrinford stated, holding their charade a bit longer. “Meet you for breakfast in the morning.” They waited until the teenager left, her overnight bag tucked under an arm. “This is becoming ridiculous,” the younger Wolf continued. “When shall we tell her and give up this farce?” His nostrils flared and his head whipped around to face the eldest Holmes. “Did you bring Angelo’s?”
). Living without those rules for over thirty years of his life, his younger brother could understand why the notion of safe-change zones and registration with identification tags made the general populace feel secure but did not understand other regulations. Trevor seemed to be of the same mind as his younger sibling, which is interesting, considering that the younger man had Turned him.
, he calculated, though it did not seem like a short enough time for Molly, who groaned, rubbing her stomach gently.
“You’re
With a sigh, he lay down at Molly’s feet, warming them and her swollen ankles with his high temperature. His eyes, still blue and human, he knew, followed the frantic hands of Evelyn Watson as she gave his Alpha, her quasi-parent, a belly rub. John, who had adapted surprisingly well to being the other Wolf’s Mate, rubbed too, laughing at the carefree detective.
my family - I haven’t killed; I’ve never wanted to, though I’d never second guessed it before. And then I met you...Now I know how wrong my family is, how wrong all the Hunters are.
“Yes, darling,” the government murmured, “I’ve got it all ready for you.”
Smiling back, she wiped her own eyes and took a step back. “I should go.”
He turned the corner into their master bedroom to find his beloved wife sitting on the end of their bed, struggling to get off the squishy surface, her rounded stomach making it difficult for her to move. “Oh, goodness, Myc,” she grumbled, looking overwhelmed. “Thank God that you finally showed up. I’ve been trying to get up for the last fifteen minutes! How embarrassing.”
John shrugged, looking worried, his eyes darting between the Wolf and his child. The detective continued, “That is such a small bit of our history. I don’t truly see why you should be wasting your time researching something that you and your classmates will never witness.
“Yes, sir,” she replied, obediently, keeping her facade in place. “It would be a shame if the Lupus sapiens movement lost their leader.”
Slowly, she allowed her fingers to open her Messenger app. She scrolled down her messages, finding the last text she had sent to the man who kept breaking on the tv screen.
“Uncle Ford!” the twins yelled in unison, leaping from their chairs and rushing into his open arms.
“Fine,” she blurted out, trying to hide her anxiety.
The dark, shaggy wolf trotted ahead of him, allowing him to stand at his shoulder. It was the position of the Pack Beta, the second-in-command. If Mycroft understood Wolf dynamics and hierarchy, he’d be stewing right now.
He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and gave her a one-armed hug. “Believe it or not, Darling, but I think I may have just gotten a date with your Ms. Crowley.”
All CCTV in the area had been put on a loop from the shots the night previous. Kensington definitely had personal access to the live footage and the last thing he needed was the man bent on bringing destruction of the Lupus sapiens knowing that they were gathering on his doorstep.
“I fail to see how this is good news,” the British government stated, “We can’t arrest her for a crime that she hasn’t committed yet.”
“Yes,” he replied, gently cocking his head and giving her a shy, quirked smile.
Knowing that the teenage years were an extremely vulnerable time, he murmured, “I think, Evelyn, that anyone would be glad to have you call them Pop. To have you in their lives as a daughter. I do think that he will say yes, but you do have to ask him first.” He ruffled the blonde head beside him before changing the subject. “How about some ice cream? I think the debate winner deserves a treat, don’t you?”
“We’ve me, police sergeant Sally Donovan and detective Sherlock Holmes, then we have the patient himself” Lestrade continued as he quickly made his way through the hospital, bringing them down an open hallway.
He came across many common thoughts, people who were running late, women wondering if it was that time of the month, boys wondering when the next time they would go training for sports, so on, so forth. Watson preferred to tune into more interesting conversations, perhaps it was quite invasive of him, rude, a bit manipulative even whenever he decided to interrupt the thoughtful conversations.
‘I’ve to warn them of a…’
“I beg your pardon?” Watson furrowed his brows, looking at the solider with disdain and shock, rising to his feet. The soldier opened his eyes with bewilderment, he never said a word. “W-What?” He questioned, glancing around to avoid eye contact with the disrespected doctor. Watson simply let an unconvinced, ‘hm’, sneak out as he looked down at the state of the soldier.
“He’s under anaesthetic because he was quite panicked, and we’re unsure of explosives, just bullets that are in the skin, not penetrating through the opposite sides” Lestrade told him hurriedly as they stopped outside a closed door. The slim window into the room was distorted but it was obvious there were figures in there and their voices seem to collide.
“That’s Sherlock, don’t pay him any mind…” Donovan whispered to him as she guided to him to where the man was, behind a blue hospital curtain. “He’s a bit of a freak, a psychopath if you ask me” She muttered, not afraid if he overheard.
‘Am I losing my mind?’ Watson asked himself as he approached his injured soldier, hearing the groans he emitted, he propped the crutches next to the chair. Watson brought him through the general procedure of using crutches and as he practised, he wrote up a summary of his medical leave, which was then down to his commander to handle from then forth.
“H-How did you know I have a wife?” The soldier questioned, he was panicked, and exhausted. “You said she’d be...disappointed...no matter, we’ll supply you with a pair of crutches for your departure” Watson informed and made his way past various doctors and nurses who scurried around as he approached a rack of medical supplies, crutches by the nearest wall.
“Surprised?” Sherlock smiled, but the smile was empty, his lips simply moved yet no other wrinkle in his face happened to be affected.
“Hello, so you’re the ‘doctor’ employed to this job? Can I ask your name?”.
All these thoughts waved over him like a rampage, they were all different voices, some louder than others.
“Hello” John began, awaiting a reply.
“Stannford, stay here, Watson, follow me” Lestrade instructed as the door closed and the chatter between the two figures stopped immediately, and they both turned away from each other. One of the figures now was a young woman, curly hair held back in a large, clean ponytail. Her face was stern and stiff, she radiated tension and voices from her ran on quickly, most sentences didn’t even complete when another thought would interrupt. Her arms were crossed stiffly, and she looked across to Watson and smiled slightly and uncrossed her arms to hold her hand out.
John Watson found himself living a mundane life now, after being dispatched after a strike to the shoulder with a bullet, he found himself in the same routine; Wake up, attend therapy, return to flat and ponder for the rest of the day, sleep.
“Allow me to properly introduce myself, Sherlock Holmes” He cleared his throat, holding his hand out at a short distance which John took and sternly shook before Holmes’ quickly pulled his hand back.
“Does there need to be a doctor, immediately?” Watson raised an eyebrow and Stannford nodded quickly, “One moment” He added.
“Will I be able to walk, Doc?” The soldier asked, his sweat dripping into his hairline, black hair glistening against the bright sun that shone through the tent’s seams. “Maybe not for five or six months, sir” Watson replied and saw all light leave the soldier’s face. “You may be sent back to England on medical leave” He delivered the news slowly and watched as the soldier tried to rise, grunting as he did.
“Thank you for helping us, we appreciate it a great load” Lestrade smiled at him, releasing his hand and proceeding to push past Donovan to peer at the letter, Sherlock holding it above his head as he seemed to study the letter intensely, the voices emitting from him becoming distorted, and working incredibly fast. Soon enough, he placed it back down on the metal table and turned to look at Watson, eyes narrowing and scanning over him before he let a short ‘hm’ pass his lips.
Watson peered out the window with curiosity, examining the large building with an abundance of blue tiles. He exited the car and noticed a man standing outside, greying hair stuck to his head and grey eyebrows that were knitted together in frustration. The man’s head rose and he seemed to let out a sigh and smiled in Watson’s direction, quickly approaching, hand beginning to rise to shake his hand. John shook his hand carefully while the man’s grip was quite strong and his eyes turned to Stannford and his expression turned to further frustration before turning to Watson once more.
“Oh, Dr. Watson, there’s someone you should be told about” Stannford began as the car began to quickly make it’s way throughout the city. “He...well, he’s not ‘normal’, you could say, I think he’s pretty strange at least, his name is Sherlock Holmes...maybe you’ve heard of him”.
“I’m up to the task, sir” Watson replied as they pushed past everyday people, their whispers flooding his head as they exited the building, finding a black car quickly pulling up outside the station.
“Apologies, Watson” The man said without care, not even turning to look at him before turning to stare at the body of the man.
Stannford pulled out his phone, quickly going through his contacts and calling a number. “Lestrade, I’ve a doctor to remove the evidence-! I know, I’m sorry, okay...j-just send a car, outside of St Pancras International...it doesn’t matter how I found one, I found one and he’s qualified-” Stannford spoke into the phone and the voice of a frustrated man on the other end yelled at him, his eyes turned to Watson who nodded at being qualified.
“I didn’t expect you to actually retrieve something” The Sherlock character muttered, taking one of the disposable gloves John had put on the table and using it to pick up the laminated paper, which he shielded from being seen by Donovan.
“Dr John Watson” He replied back, taking her hand and giving it a quick shake before pulling away. The man on the other side had his back turned and most voices came from him, the subdued voices were certainly louder but since their arrival, they quietened down. They were incoherent and distorted, unpleasant to say the least. Watson could only see the tall figure from behind, thin frame hidden beneath a large coat, collar popped up, a mess of curly black hair atop his head. He couldn’t distinguish the face from the window’s reflection, just a pale face with unrecognisable features.
“Dr Watson, great to meet you, Greg Lestrade, detective inspector for New Scotland Yard” The man introduced himself, letting go of his hand as he guided the two men into the hospital.
“Excuse me, sir” The voice spoke, he turned to see the large man. His skin sagged off his skull like an ill fitting jumper, bright blue eyes piercing into him as he stared John right in the eye. His wrinkles intensified as he raised his eyebrows.
“Alright, so, while this is very irresponsible to grab someone off of the street, there are no other doctors on hand today and it’s an urgent situation, we’ve a man who was taken hostage, and they seemed to have implanted a bullet in him or some other object and it’s crucial evidence, as probably promised, there is a sum of money for the task” The man concluded, his voice had an essence of finality,
“Seriously, if I were you, I’d ignore him, he doesn’t get paid to be here...he probably jacks off to just seeing a man unconscious” She continued as she watched Watson inspect the body, picking up a piece of paper which held general information, becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the woman’s choice of words.
“You are quite the person, aren’t you? Missed a train, to where? Just outside London, I presume, and not a wink of sleep either, and stress has certainly taken its toll, especially with that lack of a smile” Sherlock listed off, and Watson looked over himself, wondering what information he was gathering by simply looking at him, stood in the most basic outfit he could come up with.
‘Doctor Shepard, Doctor Shepard, where’s the bastard’.
‘My wife will be so disappointed’ The faint voice cried, and while the soldier had no tears, the voice appeared to be crying. “Your wife will be thankful for you serving thus far” He added, glancing to the man’s fingers, he had no ring.
He stood reading the information when suddenly the curtain was opened viciously, causing him to almost jump from his skin. He turned around and found himself face to face...or more face to chest with the man who was in their presence, in obvious shock.
John tried to ignore the peering eyes. He hadn’t had such a crowd watch him work in years, he simply went on as he would any other procedure.
He brought the tweezers into the wound, a soft squelch of blood and skin pressing against the tweezers. His hands moved incredibly slowly, trying not to shake as he performed the procedure. As he inched closer to the bullet, he found it to merely be a shell, with a hollow entrance, minus a tiny slip of...paper. He took a small breath, holding in before he exhaled, placing pressure on the tweezers and extracting the small piece of paper, cautious not to let it slip from the grip, feeling the laminated surface almost slip from the grasp. He slowly brought it out and once it was outside the wound, he let out the breath, placing the laminated paper on the table where supplies lay.
“I’m deeply sorry, but thank you for your service so far” Watson replied and watched as it seemed the soldier’s eyes seemed watery.
“Unlike you, Sally, I have the respect to not jack off another woman’s husband” The detective retorted, resentment spitting off his lips at the visibly appalled woman.
Gently, he handed the furry twin to his sister-in-law and moved off deeper into their apartment. He found Mycroft’s empty study and closed the door to a sliver. Stripping, he folded his clothing and placed it on a wooden chair in the corner, where it would be out of the way. With a prolonged sigh, he called the Wolf and Shifted, almost purring at the sweet release. His paws sunk into the rich carpet, the fibers tickling his toes. Gripping it a bit, his nails biting into the pattern, he shook out his coat and headed to the door.
“Even though he can see as a human?” she asked, her eyes widening, fascinated.
“Hunters,” he stated, his gaze hardening, his lips pulling into a flat line.
The room was large, certainly larger than his bedroom at 221B, at held two cradles, a changing table, a pair of dressers, several toys and stuffies, and a pair of armchairs. Mycroft was seated in one of the armchairs, a baby in each arm sleeping soundly, a soft smile playing on his lips.
). They were no longer required to Shift at Transitional Facilities, hence why Baskerville had more areas open to the general public than ever before. The original transitional facility had found new life as a museum after the occupants no longer used it as a safe Shift space. Sherrinford was still in charge of the campus but now so much of what her uncle oversaw fell under medical research, creating better Shift delays while still trying to crack the formula that would prevent the spread of Lycanthropy to those that were infected against their will. The giving of care to patients was something that her uncle took very seriously, carrying out his therapy sessions weekly with those that requested it. Some Lupus sapiens still came to Baskerville monthly, whether due to nostalgia or personal comfort, but most remained at home with their friends and family for the Moon, thick leather collars worn when they ventured outside on four legs. The collars served as a means to identify them as human while bearing color-coding that warned whether they were friendly (Blue) or just wanted to be left alone (Red). It allowed them access to public places, though most simply took the freedom to rove the streets and traverse the parks without fear. Wolves were simply who they were. They were no longer seen as terrifying ‘others’ but as
He shook his head slightly. “If we live through this, I will tell you why.” He scooped the eggs onto two plates and placed them on the table. “And please, Imogen, believe that I truly want to tell you.”
Quickly, he went to his bedroom and stripped his clothing off and crouched, willing the Shift. John needed comfort, needed protecting, and his instincts screamed at him to take his hardier form to do so. The Shift was mercifully swift, being only a few nights from the Full Moon.
Mycroft’s heavy steps raced up the stairs and down the hall. The man, severely out of shape, came panting into the room, Benedict held securely to his heaving chest. “Have I missed it?”
Knowing that he needed to stop thinking, he turned his back on the wall with a huff and pulled off his robe, tossing it onto the worn sofa in a heap. Striding purposefully towards his room, he quickly and efficiently stripped his rather fitted clothing off into a heap on the floor. Crouching down, he willed the shift, letting his instincts pull him from human to wolf.
“No,” Molly replied, frantically gesturing him over, “It’s just started!”
Sherrinford!”
Evelyn looked down at the table, rolling her food about her plate as her cheeks flamed in humiliation. “
Evelyn sat, notebook drawn into her chest protectively, her eyes wide. He cocked an eyebrow muscle, confused. She had seemed alright with everything when he had left a few minutes ago. Now she looked (and smelled) terrified of them.
The man had a rather canine attribute at the base of his impressive member. And it drove her absolutely mad. She was terrified when she first saw it, much less felt it seeking entrance, but she closed her eyes, told herself to relax, and took it into her body. She knew, in that moment, that regular human penises were forever inadequate from that point on.
Once the Pup quieted, Sherlock snuffled the little ears and back before lapping at his muzzle, welcoming him into their Pack. He carefully, and painfully, stretched his head back to snuffle and lick at Thomas’ pink, flared nose.
_ _ _ _ _
Sherrinford whined again, turning to look up at her, his tongue hanging out almost tenderly. “I know,” she whispered, taking each step one at a time, one hand wound through the wolf’s ruff and the other on the bannister. “You have one very lucky nephew and I have one very lucky son.”
He smiled a bit, shooting a look at Mycroft before he inhaled slowly. “Well,” he began, building suspense for the two little ones that sat across from him, their faces lighting up. “The reason I know about the wolves is because I am one. I always have been and always will be. I was born with the ability. It runs in our family, you see, and one of your new siblings is just like me.”
). With (What he deemed) a sympathetic frown, he continued, “I’m sorry for your loss, which is why I want to help you and catch his murderer.”
Her feet led her back to Baker Street along their tried and true route, weaving in and out of various levels of foot traffic and automobile congestion. Going to school, as much as she enjoyed the variety, was becoming harder to do. Her father was dealing with an enormous workload while trying to play it off like nothing was happening, though he was never a talented liar. Sherlock was going crazy over the case because it effected him more than he’d ever tell anyone, his nose pressed to the grindstone. He was after it like a dog after a bone because, despite hiding it deep down, he was scared, making living with him rather impossible. It made her wonder how and why her father had put up with it for years and years.
“It will be fine.” Molly emphasized each syllable with clarity. “Really, Sherlock, he won’t bite.”
“Sir,” Eddington said with a small, soft, smile on his face, “We both know that I am not human. I
“Sleeping means that my body is recovering,” he replied, knowing that the doctor knew that. “But I am terribly sorry that I missed her. She is my favorite niece, after all.”
Watching his brother shift was fascinating. He had seen himself shift back from his four-legged form, as Mycroft had taped it during his first change. Natural born wolves apparently shifted very differently. It started at the extremities, his toes and fingers shrinking and becoming paws and claws, as the shift traveled up his arms and legs, popping joints, elongating and rotating. As the shift reached his shoulders and hips, his sibling shook, completing the shift in that motion with maw and tail sprouting, ears pulling upward, and fur erupting all at once. It took no longer than thirty seconds, which shocked him, seeing as his own was only that rapid the night of the Full Moon.
John was nearly obscured by the flying fur about him. He was screaming inhumanly, pressed against one of the rounded walls of the tunnel that appeared to be a scarlet color.
“Because, if it is not, you think Parliament will not allow it to happen. I understand.” The red-ish blonde head cocked slightly. “And you want me to run it.”
Imogen laughed, a truly beautiful sound, as she agreed, “He’s certainly different, but I kind of like him.”
He nodded again, panting slightly around the tennis ball in his mouth. Slowly, he took another step forward. He understood her hesitance. Sherlock was tall; his shoulders were at her father’s waist. That left him just below her chin, his ears brushing it.
Imogen took the seat and watched the graceful yet predatory movement of the werewolf as he took his own seat. Smiling crookedly, he offered his empty plate to her. She smiled back, opening a roll, slathering it with mustard, filling it with onions and placing a sizzling sausage on top. “Bon appetit!” she sang, making the man flush as he brought the plate back to sit in front of him.
, he reprimanded, allowing a brief wave of disappointment to roll down his spine.
“Don’t,” he whispered, placing a hand on the younger man’s shoulder. “You’ve paid for that, over and over again, Sherrinford. This murder - it’s most certainly not your fault.”
He nodded and gave a soft yip, his eyes drawn to the ball. His tail, wagging furiously, pulled his back end off the floor in anticipation. With a small smile, the teenager tossed the ball back to him. He jumped catching it easily in midair. “Would you like to play?” she asked, giggling. He nodded, nudging John to open the door.
“Talk to Sherlock,” he replied, rising to pull his mobile from his pocket. One of his staff could get the needed files from his office at Baskerville and overnight them to Downing Street. Lestrade could get the K13 files. He needed to get his own thoughts and lessons from his father down. “I think his murderer might have a connection to your new legislation.”
“Hello Benny! How are you?” she exclaimed, tickling the little boy. He giggled excitedly, his limbs thrashing.
He woofed in acknowledgement, his stomach aching with hunger. Shifting and coitus were tiring and required so much energy, his expedited metabolism needed fuel.
“The consulting detective!” the teacher beamed, offering a hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Ready?” she breathed, trying to hide the tremor in her voice.
He rolled his eyes at the sentiment, not wanting to scoff again and upset his shoulder. The other man’s smile turned into a smirk. “I know. Sentiment.” His mercurial eyes flickered back to the Pup who had started to kick his legs a bit, as if he were chasing a squirrel. “The Pups bring it out. Call it Alpha instinct.” The older man paused, fixing him in his now steely gaze. “Don’t get used to it.”
His smile widened briefly. “I could step in for a few minutes. I’m just making the rounds before the Moon. Making sure everyone is comfortable.”
Smiling at the backs of his hosts and admiring their obvious love for each other, he followed, tying the borrowed dressing gown shut. He was glad to see that the sitting room that the couple had chosen was close by, poor Molly was moving less agilely these days and his heart went out to her. In all honesty, he knew that she could go into labor at any second, which was part of the reason behind his urgent visit to the very private residence. Something that Mycroft brought up with a bit of annoyance as he sat down in an armchair opposite the couple.
she wondered, plastering her smile back onto her face.
The girl smiled at him again, giving his hand a knowing squeeze, and followed her father up to 221C. He watched then go with a soft smile playing on his lips, his nostrils flaring at the lingering scents of gunpowder and fresh-cut grass.
Hours later, a case for the freedom of the K13s had shaped itself rather nicely. The fine men of the New Scotland Yard would no doubt support it, many glad of their colleagues with advanced senses. Sherrinford had no doubt that agencies such as the Armed Forces or MI6 would be tapping some of his more able patients before the end of the presentation. After all, who wouldn’t want to hire the best? Sean was working as private security, proving that Wolves could be a perfect line of defense. Proving that Lupus sapiens were not mindless killing machines…well…Of course, he had another plan to address that matter, but it was one that he was keeping tightly hidden from everyone else.
“Sure,” he said, understanding the importance of parental bonding at birth and he had no plans on getting in their way. “When are you planning on telling them? The Pup will have very little control around the Full Moon, including the days before and after, and I’ll need to be in my four-legged form more often than not. Pups long for comfort that can only come from that form, even if they can’t match it all the time.”
“Famished,” he replied, his eyes still on his brother who had moved the Pup to his shoulder and was patting his back tentatively. “You don’t need to burp him in that form, you know. He can digest everything just fine.”
“So…what is the master plan that is going to end this trouble with the Hunters?” Sherlock drawled, his face composed into an unimpressed mask despite the fact that he was definitely on edge. The small muscle twitch around the corner of his mouth gave him away.
Silence perforated the room. Sherrinford took a shuddering breath and held his head in his hands. “I remember him, Greg,” he breathed, barely louder than a whisper. “I remember how he ran. How I caught him in my jaws, latching onto his leg and tearing the flesh. Tasting his blood.” He shook his curled head. “
“What about...” She stopped, scanning about them before leaning in conspiratorially. “
“A scene unlike any other in Parliament today. Dr. Sherrinford Holmes, the world’s leading expert in Lupus sapiens, revealed the reason behind his success with his patients. I warn you, this can be rather disconcerting to watch.” The image of Sherrinford’s Shift appeared on the screen, the screams of the members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords piercing his ears.
Sherrinford showed up about twenty minutes later, tugging Mycroft rather unceremoniously behind him. The man looked tired and a bit overdrawn as he bent and released the younger man from the lead, giving him free rein to explore as he pleased.
He inhaled sharply, reasserting his dominance with a growl. “Trevor Stevenson. You met and played trivia with him every Tuesday.”
“Are you saying that there is a type of Lupus sapiens that can transform on the New Moon?” His stomach was sinking rapidly.
“We have a target on our backs,” he stated, then stopped, an idea blazing through his mind like a hot knife through butter. “You’re hoping that the killer will come for Sherrinford.”
The backdrop of Baskerville, with the line of tourists that trekked through the old buildings where Sherlock had first transformed and Sherrinford had taken his stand after his public Shift at Parliament, was almost romantic at this point in her life. So many important things had happened there. Her uncle and her soon-to-be-aunt were living there, along with their charge, her cousin Tom, and she came and went as she pleased. They had a guest room just for her, which she greatly appreciated, and Sherrinford had promised her an internship once she was in uni in a year or two. Unlike her father, he understood her fascination with the Lupus sapiens and he understood that she wanted to help them, and, maybe one day, in the future, go through the process to join them. Started by her soon-to-be aunt and approved by her fiancé, the process was similar the process that those who are transgender undergo., Those who desired to be ‘Bitten’ had to undergo several doctor visits and therapy sessions to be sure that they understood the risks and never lost their want of the end result. Once they were approved by the experts, they would receive an injection of venom (extracted through a rather painful process from her favorite uncle’s salivary glands) under the light of the following Full Moon. Over the last eighteen months, after Imogen Crowley became the first of the next generation of Turned Wolves, there had been a total of ninety-seven individuals who had joined the Lupus sapiens ranks.
“Where?” Sherlock was brusque to say the least, his strides eating the ground between the cab (Where he’d left John to pay - again) and the run-down house. Someone had not had a very good New Moon, apparently.
The other man did not grace him with a reply even as his face drained of color.
Unlocking the door to his family’s flat, he ushered the duo of wolves in and knelt. Sherlock’s nostrils flared but he sat, the sunrise beginning to cast lengthy shadows across the floor. After a moment’s hesitation, Sherrinford followed suit, keeping one eye on the Alpha. “I’m just going to take these off,” he murmured softly, keeping his voice deep and low, non-threatening. He quickly pulled off Sherlock’s well-worn collar, shaking the tags free and ruffling his neck a bit, causing his younger sibling’s tail to thump on the floor a couple times. He repeated the action with Sherrinford, who took the collar from his hand and began to chew it off in a corner of the kitchen. He watched Sherlock retreat down the hallway and into the guest room, the door clicking shut behind him. Silence descended upon the flat. Molly, and hopefully, the babies within her, would continue to nap for another couple hours.
shouldn’t have to be muzzled to perform their job.”
The perfume of new baby, spices and the inevitable scent of Wolf played through the air beneath the musk of the new parents. “Molly is sleeping,” he muttered striding towards the stairs, his nose leading him on. “Nursery on the second floor?”
,” Eddington cut in. “He may be human but he’s our undeniable leader. He’s our vet, our psychologist. Our Alpha. Alpha’s run Packs, that’s what they do.”
. “I wasn’t expecting to see you, Eddington,” he stated, taking the seat beside the werewolf and sitting upright with his chin raised, trying to carry some guise of power within the room.
“Are you staying furry?” his Mate breathed, pulling his jumper about his chest, covering a bit of their mingled scent with the smell of wool.
Her brother-in-law licked the baby once more before nuzzling her own arm tenderly. “Thanks, Sherrinford,” she murmured, drifting to sleep.
Sherlock blinked at her rapidly before giving him the same treatment. Abruptly, the detective left his seat and vanished into the rest of the pub. The small woman guffawed at the abrupt departure of his older sibling, making him chuckle. “He’s a bit of an odd duck,” he admitted with a shrug, realizing that he was even more of one. After all, their parents had given him up for being too different but had kept their two boy geniuses.
Mycroft inclined his head and held the door for him to pass through. Much to his chagrin, the entire entourage of politicians and the like piled in after him. His brother closed the door with a firm click and a sympathetic twitch of his lips, his mask firmly in place. “I think the kitchen area, along the counter and behind the island would be the optimal viewing location, don’t you think, Brother?”
Sherrinford took a step back, surprised, dread settling into the pit of his stomach. “You think they’ve found a foothold in England?” he breathed, voice shaking with fear.
“Right, right,” the other man yawned, reaching for his coffee cup. “I had a long night shift last night. Eddington went out in his Wolf-shape for the first time. Things went well.”
“Daddy!” Evelyn said enthusiastically, emerging from the kitchen to wrap her arms around his waist, snuggling close. She placed a kiss on his weathered cheek before adding, “How was your day?”
“All you need is some sleep,” he breathed, giving the woman one last kiss before giving her a gentle push towards the bedrooms. “You’ll feel better in the morning. Sherrinford’s got Thomas settled now and I’ll get Benedict to bed. Go.”
John shook his head, gripping his side as he continued to chortle. “I never asked you to buy milk! Let’s face it, Sherlock, you never go to the store!”
He shook his head, watching the woman pour about half a bottle of milk into her mug. “None. Thanks. I’m just used to drinking it straight out of the pot these days.”
The doctor released a sigh. “This had better not become a habit because this is the second time I’ve had to pretend to be a vet for him and I’m too old for it.”
DOWNING STREET IN AN HOUR. BRING THE K13 FILES. THANKS.
Mycroft, stoic features in place, gave him a single nod before setting Thomas into the playpen where he could toddle about without getting into trouble. The little one promptly walked into the mesh wall of the pen and fell onto his bottom with a sharp yip and a bounce. He snorted, shaking his head, so glad that he couldn’t remember being that small. His brother sent him a dark glare the quickly melted into a small, amused smile. “Someone has to fight for us,” he murmured, still smiling. His nephew would grow up with a family that loved him as he was, even if he was ostracized for it. He could be the martyr so long as the future was brighter for Thomas and those that followed.
become his friend though, Sherlock had seen that happen, and was surprisingly grateful for it. He didn't really have friends because few people could tolerate him just as he was. John, meanwhile had been his staunchest defender when Moriarty's trap had closed in around him, his trust never once wavering.
"Sod this!" John turned and furiously tugged on his coat. "I did
"I'm not talking about games, Mycroft!" Sherlock shouted back, the hurt obvious in his voice. "I can do all sorts of things I'm not supposed to be able to do! I have for years, you know that!"

He pulled her closer and pressed another kiss to her temple. "It's not your fault, harry. I'm just glad you're okay." John did manage to hold her at arm's length, for just a moment, before declaring, "You look great!" and pulling her back to his chest.

Moriarty nodded as he placed his phone in his jacket pocket, and strode out of the room.
They found Laurali with her hands braced against the sink, a sizable puddle of clearish liquid pooled at her feet.
Greg looked up and met Sherlock's unreadable gaze. "You did a good thing today," Greg said softly.
John didn't stop, however. Instead he growled softly and scraped his teeth over Sherlock's neck before moving up to nibble at his ear, while his hand continued its ministrations unabated. Sherlock groaned softly, feeling himself about to tumble over the edge. He wasn't frightened or uncomfortable, far from it, but this couldn't end now. "B-Brain dead," he finally gasped.
"You don't want me to make your tea?" John asked warily. It felt like the ground was starting to slip away from underneath his feet.
" No one argued with Mummy Holmes when she was in this sort of mood. No one.
John enlightened James about the details of various cases he hadn't included in his blogs, and James sat in awe of John's adventures. When they had finished their food they stood in tandem and walked to the nearest bin to dispose of their refuse.
John's glower returned. "And being here for almost nine months makes you an expert does it?"
Nikki nodded solemnly, and Sherlock knew she would take his advice. "Here," She said, lifting her violin case out to him with her good arm. "You'll need a violin if you're going to play for Mr. Walker."

to you about your oncoming heat."
A long arm snaked around John's shoulders, and pulled him flush against the chest of the world's only consulting detective. "We'll be there soon," Sherlock murmured, for the cabbies benefit, glaring menacingly down at John.
"They're walking away now," Sherlock observed, and John turned back to the screen, watching the two men walk away together, hand in hand.
Sherlock let out a slow breath, feeling suddenly cold in the absence of John's body heat. The dominance that he saw so readily in John was one of the reasons he had hesitated so long in telling him the truth. Sherlock had known their connection was strong enough that if he added a bond to it, he would be utterly lost to it in a way that had both thrilled and terrified him, and he had been right…there was no going back now…
Lestrade shrugged. "He was wealthy and active in politics, that and he was only forty, with a relatively unremarkable medical history; he should have recovered smoothly."
"No, now they're suspecting that we've started a relationship," Mary clarified, smirking at him, before taking another bite.
"There has to be something we can work out," John insisted.
Something pricked at the back of John's mind as he considered Molly's words. She was a very dedicated, organized morgue assistant. Why
it takes."
"Yes, Dr. Watson," Nikki replied dutifully, a slight wryness creeping into her smile. "Trust me, Sherlock's given me plenty of opportunities to practice." Glancing over her shoulder at Sherlock, Nikki asked, "7:00pm right?"
John rolled onto his side, and his eyes flickered up to his phone, currently resting on the small cabinet beside his bed. He thought of all the people that he'd been ignoring. Other than Mary he hadn't spoken to anyone outside of his work in weeks… It really was time to fix that.
She smiled as she accepted the check. "Thank you for coming Dr. Watson, I think you'll really like the show."
. Even now... he couldn't regret it.
under his slides, and studied them as well. Sherlock hmmed' to himself and reached to a thin pipette, sprinkling a few drops of water onto his slide, stirring it gently, then adjusting the focus of the microscope once more.
He was in love, but not with John. He'd been in love for years. He had the same quiet, resigned demeanor John had these last few years. He was in love but didn't believe he could have the person he did love. Instead he made a habit of one night stands.
"Is it true? Have you really broken up with Sherlock, Dr. Watson?"
Sherlock stared aghast at the wrecked instrument before him. The frame was slightly crumpled, one leg was completely severed, a handful of lose keys were scattered on the floor around it, and, given the fading echoes of its dissonant notes, several of its wires had snapped. The bench which had accompanied it lay fractured beneath and around it. He did not register the rushing feet until his mother's hands were one him.
Actions speak louder than words.
"You're welcome," John replied, leading Mary up the sleek stairway. Their seats were located in the front center of the first balcony. This vantage point would allow them to clearly see the entire stage without being so far way that they would miss anything. Nikki had been very thoughtful in her selection.
. The grey-haired man cleared his throat, causing the Wolf’s head to whip around, facing them, hackles raising and teeth exposed.
“Why would one of you want to help one of us?” the bald man, obviously the Alpha within their little gathering.
The worried silence was broken by the ringing of his mobile. The soldier leaned forward, picking it up. “It’s Mycroft.”
The door opened to reveal her mother. She was a powerful woman and her outfit for the evening revealed that. Her greying hair was pulled back from her sharp, severely pursed face. The woman’s thin lips, however, left their lemon-sucking expression to fold into a grin that could only be called menacing. “Oh, hello darling,” she stated, her grin growing. “And this must be Dr. Holmes, whom we’ve all heard so much about.”
She simply raised her eyebrows as another contraction froze her muscles. A warm gush escaped her legs, soaking the sheets and mattress below her. “
“If the shots came from below and above, how can you guess this man’s height?” Lestrade asked, lost and not following.
“Then pay attention to their hair color and eyes and, for the most part, their personalities, you’ll be fine,” he beamed, placing his empty plate in the sink. “Shall we?”
“I think that you’re creating concentration camps for men who deserve to be treated as equal to the rest of us, my Lord,” he replied, his face trained and blank even as his worry and fury roiled in his gut. “Why do they terrify you so much? What did they do to you?”
When silence fell again, the teenager tossed her beautiful blonde head back and gave her own melodious howl to the Moon. His Alpha joined her, giving him permission to add his song to the night, the sound mingling with the others harmoniously. After a slight nudge from his Mate, the doctor joined them, his notes in perfect unison with Sherlock (
He tried to nod but his head was so heavy, he couldn’t move it. A knowing hand rested on his side, well away from his injury, feeling his ribcage rise and fall. “Get better first. Bedrest for the next couple of days, according to the good Dr. Watson. Sherlock will get anything you need and Molly will bring Thomas in a little later. He’s fussy.”
He greeted the DI, laptop in hand, at the end of the hour. Greg looked concerned but was decidedly calm. The new proposed bill did not effect him directly, only through his colleagues and through his interactions with the Holmes Pack.
“Sherlock,” the smug voice of Mycroft stated over the line, “Am I disturbing your sad excuse for a thought process?”
. He tucked the information away, trying not to let the worry ruin the evening. He could be wrong, after all. There were ways to test and check, all of which he knew but could not perform, due to his lack of hands. John, on the other hand, could run the tests next month, just to be sure.
He shook his head, chuckling a bit at her train of thought. “You are so right. I never thought of it that way.”
His rumble deepened. Sherlock grabbed the blanket, tugging it away from the shifting limbs.
Evelyn was practically wriggling out of her skin with excitement. Her odd fascination with the whole thing made him curious.
, really) existed in the first place. Every predator needed prey and big game hunting was a common past time among those that had status or wanted it.
He smiled, recalling the conversation that he had had with the young man who had inspired the movement.
he noted.
His lips, thin and kissable, pulled into a kind smile. “You have a lovely home.”
His parents, to their credit, were trying. Still, he felt as if they were trying more for Sherlock’s sake than for his own. He was a lost cause, born with a pelt and a tail. Sherlock had been born normal and had simply suffered an accident. The feeling of loneliness, of never being able to fit in, and, at times, self-loathing, was not something that Mycroft (The wanted, perfect child) had ever had to face. He would never understand the awkwardness of sitting in silence with the pair of them simply staring at him, wringing their hands with looks of pity on their faces. To him, it was sadly commonplace.
They had been up all night, the morning sun was just peeking through their curtains as the twins yawned and she handed one of the blue bundles off to her husband to burp. Exhaustion was coming on fast, making her glad that Sherrinford had come to stay for a while. The older twins would need a sitter to get them ready and off to school today, seeing as she and Mycroft would not be leaving this room for a while. Of course, her in-laws would be over as soon as Mycroft called. She prayed that he’d wait until the afternoon at least. They didn’t know anything about Thomas’ inheritance from his uncle but they’d discover it soon enough, she was sure. It would certainly wake old memories and regrets.
“She’s not,” he replied, “The woman is not that great of an actress and she doesn’t smell like a threat.”
The older man smiled back and rose to stand. “All this open space, best not to waste it,” the soldier murmured, his fingers digging into his pocket and pulling out a new tennis ball. “Fetch?”
The older man obeyed, his own fingers trembling a bit. His grip tightened on his swaddled baby, holding him tighter against his chest as he leaned forward slowly.
project?”
“Of course, Brother,” Mycroft intoned, pen scratching, “Excellent idea. And what about the baby?”
“If it has to do with Stevenson, we’re all terribly sorry about it Sherrinford but a phone call would have sufficed. A text even, as is Sherlock’s wont.” The statesman’s annoyance at being disturbed was quite evident and it irked him, the hair on the back of his neck rising.
The woman (Most likely in her late twenties or early thirties) blushed, taking his hand. “Imogen Crowley. Thank you for coming, though, I must say that this debate will make you wish that you hadn’t.”
He would be lying if he claimed that he was feeling the same as he had a month ago. That tended to happen when a maniac took a chunk out of your shoulder. While the wound was healing nicely, though he could do without the near constant throb of pain that accompanied it, he had noticed something else. Sherlock, in all his insufferable flaws, was suddenly becoming something more to him than he had ever imagined. The thought of sexual and romantic attraction to the consulting detective was really new and a bit terrifying. After all, Three Continents Watson was entirely straight, thank you very much. He had never found a man that made him more than jealous (And that was usually because the bloke had landed a woman that he had been attracted to).
They sat in compatible silence for a while until Mycroft’s rather loud entrance, complete with door bang and umbrella being thrown into the holder. Benedict, napping soundly in his bassinet until then, shrieked at his abrupt wake-up call. His brother’s distress sent Thomas howling, the shrill sound making his heart leap within his chest and his Wolf scramble against his human facade, trying to escape and toss his own head back in a howl of his own.
She did not expect a response, knowing that, at the time, the man was on assignment. It hurt to see how plainly she needed him in writing. Exiting the app, she pulled up the number for her uncle.
The wolf chuffed out his response, leaning into her leg and allowing her fingers to continue to scratch his ears, his tail twitching. Another contraction wracked her body, making her gasp, her fingers tightening subconsciously on what she was grabbing onto: Sherrinford’s fur. The wolf whined but stood his ground beneath her, supporting her body with his head and shoulders.
Sherlock’s eyes open and lock with John’s, and the moment stretches, brewing.  His lip turns up, soft and slow, and he reaches two long fingers back into the container for more.  John is transfixed; he cannot stop staring.
John laughs a little into Sherlock’s shirt and brings himself up onto his knees, and without another moment’s thought, he presses his lips to Sherlock’s, dry and warm.  He feels Sherlock’s inward breath, pulls back to check everything’s okay, and then Sherlock leans in again, this time with lips parted.  John slides a hand around to the back of Sherlock’s head to steady himself and lets everything be as simple as it should have been all along.  When his knees begin to hurt, he stands, pulling Sherlock up with him.

“True,” the voice says.  “You play the violin when you’re thinking.  Sometimes you don’t talk for days on end.”
John fires off just as the train pulls in.
of the time.
His eyes open.  John’s face is there.  Everything hurts.
Sherlock realises he’s stopped in the middle of the pavement. He blinks water from his lashes. Sherlock steps in close to John without saying anything.
Sherlock stops suddenly at a kiosk, ordering a coffee for himself and a tea for John. He hands John his cup as he sidesteps to the attached shelf for add-ins. Sherlock slides the insulated carafe of milk over to John as he shakes out two packets of sugar and dumps them into his own cup.
“No,” he confirms.  He sounds—sad.  She so wishes her heart didn’t plummet down to her belly.  She wishes her eyes weren’t filling with tears again.
John feels his head tilt. What’s
John turns to look at him. Is Sherlock actually reading to him?  He raises an eyebrow.  Sherlock shrugs.  There is a pause in the captions, and John wishes he could hear the music, but he takes the moment to once again try to get more comfortable.
over the frustration of not having any more stairs left once they’ve reached the bottom.  Then, it’s back to the lobby again at her vociferous indignation at having to climb the stairs to get back to their seats.  She won’t be diverted with any of the toys from her bag.  She won’t shut her eyes in the dark and let herself rest.
I know.
against him, hips rolling in time with his curling tongue.  John breathes open mouthed, lips against his cheek, and Sherlock’s bottom teeth scrape the underside of John’s chin.
Hands over ribs, spine, buttocks. Legs part, bodies fitted, erections together;
This chapter is unbeta-ed, so apologies for lingering mistakes and typos. I've no one to blame but myself! :-)
Sherlock leaves his sodden coat on the hook downstairs before climbing up to the flat. His hair is dripping, his toes are rubbing together uncomfortably inside his wet shoes, and the case that should have been a seven turned out to be a two. Well, one and a half. Dull. Disappointing. Solved.
John doesn’t really know what to say next, so he musters up a small smile and holds Sherlock’s eyes until he returns it. He really does need the loo though, so he nods once, heaves himself from the sofa, and goes.
, John,” Sherlock grits out through chattering teeth. John sets the towel and clothes on the coffee table.
Sherlock nods.  “They’re all there.  They are yours.”
Sherlock’s fingers flex, warm and fluttering at the back of John’s hand for just a second.
She sends about twenty heart-eye emojis along with it.
It’s not terribly loud or crowded in the bar, but the opening strains of the song are quiet, a bit difficult to hear well, but it doesn’t matter.  He recognises those familiar rolling drums easily enough.  John snorts into his drink, and though he has had this song memorised from the time he was about ten, he listens to the lyrics like they are brand new.
“No, just some old things from the basement.  Broken pipe.  Mrs Hudson sent them up.”
“No,” Sherlock says. “Until his entire network was gone—you had to think that… I had to
“You both are, you know,” Sherlock says, so quietly, and then he turns, facing John.  “Home.” His face does something complicated and raw, making John shiver with gooseflesh rising up on his arms, almost electric as it reaches his scalp.  If John keeps looking at Sherlock’s face looking like that, it will burn him blind; he can’t make himself turn away.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say, so he follows John’s lead, sitting in an armchair when John sits on the couch. “Any, er… any news on the elephant thing?”
.  He and Sherlock had discussed his going back to Mary as a part of some sort of grand plan to keep her monitored and threat-neutral until after the baby came.  It made so much sense at the time, so he’d prepared his words about the memory stick and had swallowed down his revulsion as he embraced her in the Holmes’s lounge on Christmas day.  He was so pleased with himself then.  He thought he could do it, could go through the motions and play nice, pretend that he wanted the life he’d built with her, but he’s so far removed from wanting that life, from wanting her, that the pretending isn’t even worth it anymore.
. . .
One look in the mirror, and she knows it wouldn’t take Sherlock Holmes to deduce the exhaustion in the lines around her eyes, evidence of prolonged and pathetic weeping into glass after glass of wine until the tears and alcohol forced her into an early bed.  Hopefully with some tea and a walk in the London chill, she won’t look like a walking basket case when she shows up for work later.
Sherlock parts his lips, sucks in John’s upper one, grazes teeth against skin, tongue to soothe the burn, and John’s mouth opens wide, sealing against Sherlock’s as his tongue slides inside.
Yes, bees.
. . .
Sherlock feels at ease for the first time all day.  “I couldn’t have managed without your help. Thank you, John.”
“I’m starting with Bart’s on Wednesday,” John says as he removes his coat and scarf.  “Mike put in a good word.”
“Try this one,” Sherlock says, quiet, close.  The heat of his breath makes John want to sip it into his own mouth—slowly, carefully.  He sways forward, letting his lips brush Sherlock’s thumb as he takes what is offered.
Sherlock’s nose brushes his cheek when he leans in, and John closes the distance, kissing him.  Why did it have to take them so long to get here? Something this new shouldn’t feel so familiar: the sounds of their shared breath, the small, wet noise of lips-on-lips, the pounding of his own heartbeat steady in his ears, the rustling of fabric as they shift closer, closer, closer.  His hands slide over fabric, along Sherlock’s waist, ribs, chest, nape, and he opens, opens, opens his mouth to drink in the warmth, taste the lingering spice from dinner. He could do this forever.
Sherlock lifts his head from his phone again and squints his eyes at the television, just a bit.  “
And where his breath was, now John feels the warm outer skin of Sherlock’s lips burn just there, beneath his ear, before they slide, giving way to the refreshing cool of the inner slick as John leans in, tilts his head for
John tries to protest again, but he can only sniff around the blob of snot that has suddenly decided to escape his right nostril. He catches it with a serviette. Jesus.
John pats him on the back. “Looks like you have this under control. I’m off to the pasty shop for a bite. I’m
He looks up from his phone and visually takes stock of the items in his lounge, one-by-one, and it strikes him:  the lot of it are things he either has no feelings about whatsoever or actively hates. He sips from a mug that Mary picked out for their wedding registry and sits on the sofa he bought while Sherlock was dead.  He can’t help but huff out the smallest chuckle at his own mad realisation. He doesn’t need it. He doesn’t want it.
Sherlock moans, thunder in his belly, and drags John up with him as he stands, hands sliding along the back of John’s sweaty arms, fingernails gathering sweat along the small of his back, and what he needs more than anything right now is to press his chest to John’s, bite his earlobe, and feel the exact contour of his gluteal muscle against his hand.
John has been by with Rosie throughout the renovation to help decorate the downstairs, to put things right, to build it all back.  He has not been upstairs, but not for lack of inquiry. (This must be a promising sign, Sherlock hopes.)
.  It’s been far too long since he listened to this particular melody, and his smile fades when he remembers why.
Sherlock’s warm fingers wrap around his ankle fully, and John sighs.  His eyes feel heavy.
, he is.) “Thank you,” he says.
The outside chill hits him like a physical blow, stealing the breath from his lungs as it curls in front of him like smoke. He wraps his scarf tighter, does his jacket buttons up the rest of the way. His normal bus route has shut down for the evening, so he walks quickly to the Tube station, thankful for the warmth as he descends the steps. His phone pings with a text alert, and he checks it, expecting (hoping) Sherlock, but it’s from Mike Stamford.
There is a soft
He holds up a hand, a gentle “wait” sort of gesture.  She can only imagine what her own face is doing.  She takes a breath and swallows.
Sherlock has water in his eyes and a little in his nose and around his mouth where it is sealed against John’s, and he is anything
On the way up the steps to the flat, John reaches into Sherlock’s coat pocket for the keys, leaning in close. Sherlock feels his body lean forward as well, and everything is warm and a little hazy, and John’s mouth is slightly open, soft. The sky is clear above them, the air crisp. John’s mouth is inches away from his, getting closer, and he doesn’t know if it’s him or John or both of them moving. John’s breath is settling hot on his lips when Mrs Hudson opens the door. John jumps back as if burned, and Sherlock stands straight, eyeing the clear sky above with something like disdain.
They wrap their scarves close around their throats as they leave.  Tube there, taxi back--because of the bags, and if they hurry, they might miss the worst of the weather.  John will call an estate agent for the house on Monday at work, but he and Rosie will need a few things before the movers can get the rest.  John lists them off, planning--and Sherlock
“Not by a bloody mile,” the voice says.  There is a pressure on his forehead, a soft thrum of warmth that tugs lightly at his hair.  It’s like his own fingers on the strings of his violin, a quiet sound, precious, unmistakable, lovely in its familiarity.  He’s known it for almost his entire life.
John huffs, knowing he’s lost Sherlock’s attention entirely to the siren call of sweets.  He turns back to his task, getting milk and eggs and chicken into the fridge.
John sighs, bunging his teabag in the sink and pouring milk into his cup. He pinches the bridge of his nose. Exasperated. Sherlock waits.

Sometimes, he breaks things on purpose: a glass of whiskey against the wall, the mobile phone that
When John stops in front of the steps of 221, there is a moment. They are very close, and John is looking at him, eyes moving from his eyes to his mouth, and Sherlock thinks—
“Thank you,” John says. “I’ll just go open it, let it breathe a bit. Mary’s just finishing up in the kitchen.” He sets the bottle down on an end table. “But first, let me get your coat. I’ll put it in the study.” Sherlock shucks his coat and scarf and hands them to John, who folds them over an arm before picking up the bottle again and moving out of the room. The house smells strongly of lasagna and garlic bread. It is heady and warm, almost stiflingly so. Mary calls hello from the kitchen without emerging, and Sherlock answers back briefly as he surveys this mostly-beige living room, wondering how on earth this is John Watson’s home.
“Always,” Sherlock breathes, rolling on top. He twines their legs together, kisses John’s mouth, sucks John’s chin.  He aligns their hips, fingers sliding against John’s cheek, rolls of wet trailing down both of their faces.  His eyes sting; it’s not only sweat.  “
He knows the way down. He does. He
,” Sherlock replies, muttering into his own fingers.
you,” he says.
John smiles as he stands. A drip of water falls from the tip of his nose down to his chin. Has it been raining this whole time? Sherlock hadn’t noticed.
“Okay,” she responds.  She doesn’t understand.
Turning to go in, he hums to himself--a tune he is only just learning.
God, he’s tired.  So bloody tired of being angry, of being hurt, and from everything having to be so damn complicated all the time.
Sherlock fits his hand against John’s nape, thumb brushing the soft skin under his ear, deepening the kiss, becoming something brand new.
John leans forward to read the scrawled label on the bottom one.
“Sure,” John replies, already walking through the kitchen hallway door.
“All right,” he says.  “A real one next time.”
John turns back to his programme, and Sherlock heads to his room. He towels off his hair and changes into his pajama bottoms and a tee shirt. He won’t be going out again today. Or tomorrow. Or possibly Thursday. The world is boring, and boring is bad enough.
John returns with two bottles, handing one to Sherlock as he sits across from him.  Once settled, John clinks the necks together, meeting Sherlock’s eye with a wink as they each sip.  John’s feet stretch toward Sherlock, and Sherlock, in turn, stretches his out as well.  After only a minute, John presses his ankle against Sherlock’s, and the fire, warm against his side, is making the blonde in John’s hair light up gold.
He did not account for the small, needy sound John makes as he presses even more fully into Sherlock’s palm.
On the screen, the protagonists are in a boat. It begins to rain. It’s apparently raining everywhere now—even in the works of fiction. God, Sherlock hates everything. The rain plasters the man’s shirt to his chest, does not make the woman’s makeup run. Good God, are normal people actually entertained by this drivel? Well, John would know.
“I got you these from your room,” Sherlock says, pressing his favourite pajama bottoms and tee shirt into his chest. “I’ll help you up the stairs if you want, but I thought you might want to stay here.”  He looks oddly sheepish, like a child who's not sure if he’s done the right thing or not. John also notices that his pillow and duvet have been placed at the other end of the sofa.
Sherlock is combusting.  The ice from his own tongue melts on John’s, and now it’s Sherlock’s soft moan filling John’s mouth.  Sherlock is powerless against the overflowing
much more closely. Sherlock blows a raspberry against Rosie’s cheek before kissing it, and she giggles blowing a very sloppy raspberry against Sherlock’s cheek in response. John exhales. Sherlock steps back, just a bit—but the warmth in his eyes is still there.
Sherlock smiles against his mouth, nips his bottom lip, hooks his thumb under the elastic—and slides John’s pyjama bottoms off.  John’s head arches back on the pillow.
“Rosie’s spending the weekend with her Aunt Harry, so I could get some shopping in.  Was in the area and thought you might fancy a takeaway or something,” he says.
Bees.
“Shut up,” he says, lungs burning as he tries to fill them. He gets a sharp pain in the sinus just behind the corner of his left eye, so he presses into it with two fingers. It doesn’t help much.
By the film’s end, it’s close enough to her regular nap time that Rosie does doze a bit, and Sherlock hopes her routine is restored well enough to allow her to sleep through tonight.
“Did you tell him, too?  What you told me?”
John doesn’t let him finish the thought. He has to know. He runs a finger over a well-healed mark high on his left shoulder blade. Sherlock doesn’t pull away. “What is all this, Sherlock?” he says, and he hears the hitch in his own voice now.
John breathes.
.  Progress indeed.
“Bit of a rough one there, love?” the woman behind the counter asks.  He remembers a time when he had rather an impressive poker face.  Apparently, that’s gone to shit these days, too.
Just under his ear, along the damp line of his nape, Sherlock blows out carefully--Arctic cool, blissful contrast, relief, comfort; a whisper, a question.  “John, I--”
“What?” John manages, witless, watching Sherlock wrestle with his trousers until he can pull the mobile from the pocket.
Sherlock looks at him, not talking now. Has he solved it? Or maybe they are meant to go to the library, or something about concrete scrapings? John blinks and tries to clear the goo from the back of his throat. That
“Yes,” Molly agrees.  She follows him to the door.
Sherlock’s eyes soften. “You are useless to me like this. Lestrade can handle this one from here; we’ve already done most of the work for him. I’m bored of it already.”  He’s got his phone out as he speaks, texting quickly. He thumbs the button to darken it before pocketing it with a small flourish.
“Wh-what are you doing here?” she asks, trying and failing to keep her voice steady as she stares steadfastly into Sherlock Holmes’s infuriatingly handsome face.
What?
“Are you even listening?” John asks, and Sherlock feels his own face fall, hates that he even has to ask.  But, he knows, Sherlock
Okay.  . . . Your tile is cold.
“Very good,” John replies, letting his own face reflect the gravity here. He is serious about this, too. Sherlock shifts closer first before stepping away, a silent promise, and then he’s gone, giving John a moment of breathing room.
Oh, God. It’s everything. Everything he never thought about wanting. Everything he’s
.  Snow has clung to John’s shoulders, hair, arms, shoes; brilliant white in flecks and patches, swallowing him up.
Once his bladder is empty, he heads to the kitchen for water (vicious circle), filling his glass entirely with ice first.  He runs a cube along the insides of his wrists before sliding it against his nape and the pulse points under his ears; it drips blissfully cold down his back and chest as it melts.
The room has grown dark enough in the late afternoon that he has to blink against it, and he comes back to himself a bit. He should switch on another lamp.  He hears music start, coming in tinny through the vent over the hob, funneling in from Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. Carols. She’ll likely be up in an hour or two with some biscuits or mince pies.  He can’t smell them yet, but he will.
He doesn’t get to finish because Harry starts to laugh. “Oh, Johnny.” She places a hand over his own.  “I’m just sorry you didn’t do this two years ago!”
, over and over and—
,” he reads.  “
? He leans in, feeling John’s body heat, smelling his smell, heart hammering inside his chest.
He observes the delighted look on Rosie’s face, the soft posture of his best friend.  He notes the warmth of John’s fingers through the fabric of his shirt, the solid weight of his hand on his arm--and suddenly, he is light-headed, absolutely sure that if he were standing, he would wobble.
Sherlock is still awake when John enters the room. The sound of his breathing is quiet, much quieter than the sound of rustling fabric-against-fabric, fabric-against-skin as John strips: his socks, his jumper, his shirt, his trousers, his pants. They fall to the floor in a whisper. Sherlock watches him as he does it, as the streetlight from the window paints him gold in patches—stripe of hair, an ear, the gnarled scar on his shoulder, ribcage, nipple, navel, hip, the side of one thigh. John’s gaze is on him, too, hard and
Right.  Hm; right.
Sherlock frowns at the evidence before him on the microscope slide. This is not what he’d planned for.  He sighs, rolling his shirtsleeves to his elbow.  He’ll need to think, to work out the best way to proceed from here.
“Shut up,” Sherlock says, but he’s smiling as he reaches to help John with a corner.
While they eat, John asks good questions about the crime scene from yesterday, helping Sherlock shift the data in his mind into three promising new ideas.  They’ll need to make an extra stop to re-interview the mistress.  He needs to observe both her behavioral response to this new avenue of inquiry as well as her home, particularly the bathroom.  He needs a look into her medicine cabinet.
What Sherlock did not account for was the effect of the
by the rhythm of Sherlock’s breath warming the fabric covering his heart, and so he stays.  Tentatively, he reaches out to brush Sherlock’s fringe as he remembers doing last night.
John feels his heart rate increase a bit as he feels an initial urge to bolt away—but he stops himself.  There
“I should have told you,” Sherlock shouts through the din, into the void as the wind lashes his cheeks, cold and wet.  “I should say; I’ve always meant to say and I never have--”
.  He mentally pens each rise and fall of John’s voice as notes on the page, circles and dots gliding along the manuscript staff.
He moves into the lounge, opening up Facebook to kill just a little more time as he finishes his tea.  Stamford’s family are on holiday in Spain,
Sherlock dismisses the very notion of food with a halfhearted wave of two fingers.
Say it again.
A final 221b to round out this series. Real Life got in the way of me doing all of the prompts, but before the new year, I wanted to finish this sweet little story.  It's all going to be all right.
Sherlock listens to the water running in the shower, to the small sounds of movement: of bottles clunking against tile, intermittent splatters as a body moves beneath the spray.   John’s body.  Sherlock grins into his pillow and wonders how to translate the rasp of a towel, the clink of a razor, into notes on a violin because this is

They take a taxi from Victoria station, and Sherlock catches himself staring at John in the setting light angling through the window. It turns his eyes a deep blue and lights on the highest points of his cheeks. When John looks up, Sherlock turns away, feeling that heat come into his cheeks again. He clears his throat.
It’s a bone-deep revulsion that he’s trying very hard to get used to.  It’s been a near-constant problem ever since he moved back in with Mary after Christmas.  She’s trying so hard to be normal, and so his he, but—he just can’t seem to manage it.  In his mind, always, is the sound of gunshots, the feeling of betrayal that he just cannot move past.  His jaw clenches, the tips of his fingers tingle, and there goes that jittering of the marrow in his tibias that makes his toes twitch inside his shoes.  Sometimes the sensation will become something like bearable if he simply waits it out, so he does his best to ignore it.  He breathes carefully, praying that the familiar scent of tea will put him right.
The scene shifts, the music intensifies, and the narration starts.  And good lord, it is the worst sound he has ever heard!  “Gah!” he can’t help but shout, scrambling in the folds of the duvet for the remote.  “Make that stop!”
“’S late.  I’m sorry—dropping in like this,” John announces.  Then, “Wait.  No.  No, I‘m not.  This is where I’m going.  This is where I’m meattobe.”  He stumbles over his words, feeling drunker now that he was ten minutes ago.
Sherlock feels as though he might combust.  “John, I--”
He’s swinging lazily in the garden hammock, re-reading a particularly insightful article on blood spatter when he is brought back to his Baker Street sofa by the loud squeak of a kitchen cupboard.  Sherlock can hear John working through his breathing exercises and feels the corners of his own mouth turn down.  He’s woken from a nightmare.
“So, little brother,” Harry says.  “What’s up?”  She’s got a knowing gleam in her eyes.

must have let your keys slip when you rushed inside the other room," he accused, thrusting the guards keys back at him. "Normally I'd have to make a report, but right now I have an unresponsive patient with a needle in his arm!" The guard peered into John's room and paled.
All the sassy comments Sherlock could think of died on his lips. He swallowed as John's steady blue gaze held his once again. For such a soft hearted doctor, he went right to the point... "Yes, absolutely. Modern medicine and my own experiments can do nothing to alleviate my situation." Sherlock's lips quirked in a fleeting smile. "It's a lifelong condition."
They were so close to each other, that Mycroft never saw the punch coming. There was a sudden burst of light behind his eyes, and the snap of bone. Mycroft hunched over, shielding his broken, bleeding nose.

Our best source of data is likely to be his office, he spends most of his time there. He's at a meeting with the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust board of directors. He's blocked off his entire afternoon for this meeting, so we should have time."

"Christ!" Greg spat, pocketing his badge and striding forwards towards Sherlock.
, hunting all over London for a man who was forever underfoot, and he'd inadvertently given him every possible advantage through John...
The cupids bow lips parted in defeat, and the tablets were pushed inside. John pressed the glass against Sherlock's lips next, and watched him drink. Sherlock's eyes narrowed and he turned his head away after John had pressed over half the glass of water into him; much more than was necessary to wash the medicine down. John smirked, victoriously.
"You usually settle back down when I play this waltz."
"I just sent you for milk," Laurali called over her shoulder, "What else did you get?"
While it wasn't uncommon for Sherlock to throw John right into the thick of a case with no warning, the ex-army doctor usually had at least some grasp of the situation by the time Sherlock arrived at the pacing and muttering stage of his deductions Except…John had never seen Sherlock's hands shake as they were now. It was probably the result of too much caffeine, seeing how Sherlock never slept. At least John hoped it was caffeine . His stomach turned at the thought of watching another person's addiction tear them to pieces, he was barely coping with his sister's difficulties.
had him cornered. "Go on," he murmured, mirth twinkling in his warm blue eyes. "Don't want them to get cold, do you?"
Once his hands were free again, John reached for Marcus's shirt, tugging the shirtsleeves from his trousers. John's fingers stayed at Marcus's waist for a moment, pushing against the warm skin the gap revealed. Marcus sucked in a breath when John's fingers started their work on the buttons of his oxford shirt, starting from the bottom up.
"How long?"
Sherlock's legs tightened around John's waist, and he rocked forcefully against John's thrusts crying out softly each time John pushed against his prostate. "John, please," Sherlock repeated, gasping when John pushed roughly inside him. "Yes!"
"Roughly a month," John replied.
Right or wrong?  Suicide or Murder?
My apologies, this is completely un-beta'd. I hope you enjoy anyway.
John carefully folded up the letter when he was finished an placed it in a waiting envelope. After a few mouse clicks he had printed the picture he had promised Alexander. John studied it for a moment before adding it to the envelope. Lestrade looked as unhappy as Sherlock had ever made him, and he was ringed with people in black shirts with the words "I believe in Sherlock Holmes" clearly emblazoned on them in white. The image still made John smile.
"I am not moping," Sherlock declared, lifting his cup for another sip and draining it.
Sherlock pushed away his irritation that he had reached for his scarf so automatically when he noticed John struggling. The only things that should be that reflexive should be case related; there wasn't room for anything else! Refocusing his attention, Sherlock opened the door to the basement and walked inside.
"We're adopting a dog?" John asked slowly, suspecting he was off the mark.
"Stop that," Harry insisted.
Eric shook his head. "No, thanks. I'll do it." There was a long pause before he added, quietly, "I'm worried they might call for a full investigation not only into the death of their daughter, Emily, but into the hospital in general."
true…but no job in the world could simulate the cases he worked with Sherlock… and it wasn't
"You mean how people insinuated that you were a couple?" Mary asked
John smiled as he got into a cab, and gave them the address for Charing Cross hospital. Once the cab was on its way he lifted his phone back to his ear. "You don't have to do that. You have the day off tomorrow, don't you?"
The doors of the train had just shut when John felt his phone buzz. Plucking it from his pocket, he read the waiting text. It was from Mrs. Hudson? John didn't think she bothered with texting. She was a very practical woman. She still had a flip phone for goodness sake. Still, there it was.
His eyes tracked John's every footstep until his blogger was out of sight. Then and only then did Sherlock release the breath he had been holding, and remove his phone from his pocket to view the final text.
Sherlock's glare was very subtle, but John had lived with him long enough to call the younger man out for just thinking about being unpleasant. Sherlock's voice, however, was warm and open as he gushed, "You'll love the scallops here; the chef focuses on the basics, no hiding behind fancy sauces, just the natural flavor of the shellfish." He was the picture of joviality. He even nodded to the party being seated at the larger round not far from them, just under one of the room's massive chandeliers.
Sherlock nodded and felt John's warmth leave him. He counted the good doctor's steps to the bathroom. He dawdled in their long enough to call the Thai place down the street and order some Tom Yum Goong. When John returned he dimmed the lights to a tolerable level before ordering Sherlock to sit up.
"We wait," Mycroft drawled softly.
The ex-army doctor shook himself and squared his shoulders. "Deal," he said firmly, putting out his hand for the world's only consulting detective to shake. Sherlock grinned, took it, and pulled his blogger out into the night.
Mr. McGregor blinked slowly before asking, "How, exactly, were you able to do that?"
John was just passing the couch when his offending leg was grabbed out from under him. John let out a soft cry of surprise as he sprawled backwards onto the couch. He glared at Sherlock who was currently looming over him with John's cramping leg between his long fingers.
Sherlock's eyes never left the computer, and his other hand was still busy typing, but his grip never wavered, despite Mr. Murphy's struggles. When he spoke, Sherlock's voice was low and threatening. "This is
"Do you have a case for me, or don't you?!" Sherlock snapped, cutting off the question before it could be properly voiced. John and he were
Sherlock waved one hand dismissively without bothering to look up. "Dr. Watson is a trusted associate. Whatever you want to say to me can be said in front of him."
Sure enough, the saline was in the cabinet above the sink. Sherlock snatched it up and strolled back to the kitchen with smug satisfaction. He paused at the table and tilted his face up to administer the drops so that his eyes would behave. Once he was done, Sherlock tossed the saline back into its
John cast his gaze this way and that, but he couldn't spot Nikki anywhere in the crowd. "No, I don't think so," he murmured, his eyes still searching. By chance they settled on a woman with a simple black dress, elegant for its lack of embellishments. Her honey blond hair was swept in a loose bun at the back of her head and in her arms she carried a large flat basket of roses. Her green eyes met John's and she smiled, immediately turning to walk towards him and Mary.
They walked inside and up the stairs. John had seen the light on in Mrs. Hudson's window, but thankfully she left them to their own devices. Only when they passed the threshold of 221 B did John finally let go of Sherlock's hand.
Harry's answering smile was slightly bewildered, but equally joyful as she met her brother in a fierce hug. She yelped softly when John actually picked her up and spun her in circles.
"Dr. Watson is a trusted associate," Sherlock said evenly. "Anything you have to say can be said in front of him."
Sherlock shrugged. "Tedious details are for lesser minds."
keep the saline? Sherlock concentrated, bringing up and sorting through conversations he's shared with his former flatmate, searching for the data he needed...
Forcing his numbed limbs to bear his weight Sherlock shuffled off down the passageway in front of him, focusing on the different pathways around them and how he could best keep up with Moriarty.
"I notice that you've never denied that your gay," Sherlock rumbled in an amused baritone.
"Alright, Sherlock," John said, stepping into the apartment, "What is it?"
John leaned forward and kissed her softly on the forehead. "I promise," he whispered, and meant it with all his heart. He vowed to himself, as much as he vowed to his sister, that he would do what was necessary to secure her the treatment she needed, even if he had to make a deal with the devil.
John's eyebrows furrowed closer together and he frowned. "Because you could get a nasty infection otherwise," he spoke slowly, as if he were speaking to a child. "I'm surprised you're awake already. You were injected with a very heavy dose of sedatives."
"Maybe? I've gotten them intermittently for the last few days, but I've had such bad indigestion it's hard to tell. Plus, my back's been
Sherlock's back arched, a long, desperate moan falling from his lips and John's tongue pressed inside him. "John!" He gasped, his legs twitching over John's shoulder's and back as John's mouth invaded and possessed him.
John lifted a hand to caress the side of Sherlock's face, but his expression was rigid as iron. "Silence is
"We made the front page," Sherlock observed.
James had wished him a good night and said, "

is missing, and I sure as hell didn't lose her in the back garden!"
he been thinking?! He'd just been checking Sherlock's temperature, whatever illness he had did the damndest things to him sometimes, and then...
"I wouldn't exactly call it a kindness," Sherlock replied, his arms resting atop John's, which were wound determinedly around Sherlock's torso.
Mary must have seen him looking because she said, "I was in a bad car accident when I was younger. Since then I get migraines sometimes, and indirect light is easier to manage."
James chuckled softly, and placed a hand gently on John's outstretched arm. "Save your breath. I've eaten here a few times, and I've seen him at this before. He's bound and determined to fix up anybody and everybody."
"Yes doctor," Janet replied again, preparing the next dose.
"You're absolutely right," John deadpanned. "It's my fault for forgetting that."
And that was the problem... John still believed that. After everything, he still believed that Sherlock had a heart, one he guarded so closely that few people ever managed to see it.
"Mycroft," John spat, his face twisting into a sneer as he tugged at his bonds.
irredeemable, Harry. I will
His damned flat mate had been a terror all week.  Moody, experimenting, stupid running around on stupid cases, interrupting John at work, no sleep--NONE--for three days.  John had had enough.  Even if they weren't in-between cases at the moment John would not be dragged out of the apartment for anything.
Setting his violin down, his hands were shaking too much to properly grasp it anymore, Sherlock crossed to the windows, making sure that he was far enough in the shadow of the room that John wouldn't be able to see him if he looked back. Sherlock doubted he would look back, but John Watson had always been the slightest bit difficult for the world's only consulting detective to figure out.
Feeling John's breathing slip into the steady, comforting patterns of sleep, Sherlock gently closed the book, placed it on the nightstand, turned out the light, and nestled in close. His mind was still a busy one, but he found John's presence greatly soothing. He did not doubt he too would be asleep before long. They would not be this peaceful forever. Tomorrow would bring another adventure, and the truth would come out to the world at large eventually, but right now, everything was perfect; they were both
The ex-army doctor shrugged, still grinning. "I'm not sure about that. I'm not even sure I really got under his skin, but it's nice to think so. It would be decent revenge for the constant eyeballs in the microwave."
Once they were stopped at a light Greg turned and glared sharply at Sherlock. "Do

It was John who broke the silence first by asking, "
Lestrade stepped into the opening that Sherlock had created and started speaking softly with Susan. Sherlock couldn't quite make out their voices but he could read lips. He watched Lestrade suggest that they talk privately, away from all this noise. Lestrade offered to escort her back to the station himself, and in a separate car from Dan. Susan started to glance up after a moment, started to look to Dan, but Sherlock shifted, and intercepted her gaze with a meaningful one of his own. Slowly he lifted one eyebrow and waited. At last she turned back to Lestrade and nodded once.
She smiled indulgently back at him, her eyes crinkling up in the corners. "Any time, John. It's nice to be able to help."
Mr. Brenton nodded glumly, and John stood, moving to join Sherlock in the kitchen. Sure enough, he was cutting away bits of the nightgown and placing them in slides under the microscope
Sherlock paused when a breeze ruffled his curls, and looked up. It was a shaft, really, judging by the size of the grate covering it. It would be a scramble even to get into it, and it would be a tight fit, but it should do. Sherlock slipped his phone into the inside his trouser pocket, and reached up to remove the grate. It came away with a screech that was louder than Sherlock would have liked, but he wasn't overly concerned. The space underneath London creaked, groaned, and wailed more than an old farmhouse. Too many echoes from the trains, sewers, and the life taking place in the streets and buildings above.
"When in doubt about motive, its best to start with the three R's," Mary said, stepping beside, then slightly in front of John as though her physical presence could prevent him hurling insults at Sherlock.
Moriarty paced the room idly, running his hands along the objects in it. Most people would say he looked calm, but most people were idiots.
here, Sherlock?!" John stood in the corner of the room, close to the window, dressed in plain gray scrubs.
"John!" his cry echoed in the cold, empty building... That's right. He'd forgotten. John had left hours ago, too triggered by Sherlock's deterioration to stay. Mrs. Hudson had come up a few minutes later and made some concerned inquiries before shuffling out herself. He'd heard her put on her long coat, gather up her purse and head outside, locking the door behind her. She kept a very regular schedule. It was Wednesday...grocery shopping day. ...He was alone...
John smiled and nodded. "Yes ma'am." He followed Mary into the kitchen, and did as he was bid. The countertops were blue, just like the walls, and there was a small round table with two chairs tucked close by the windows along the far wall. Just like the sitting room there was an overhead light, but the light Mary had turned on appeared to come from LED lights nestled under the cabinets.
is Dr. Watson not with you?"
are you running that way?!"
Sherlock studied John's face for a moment before lifting his fingers to John's neck and tracing a mark he had never seen, but had imagined to have been there at one time. Sherlock was both jealous, and grateful that John had someone when he needed them. "His name is Marcus Oylear." Haltingly Sherlock found John's eyes again. "I believe you have been acquainted with him."
There was also a slight curl of the lips indicating a sneer when he asked about Donovan's credentials, which gave a strong indication of his dislike of women in general. He was subtle about it, though. He tone was nothing but friendly, and if he focused on Lestrade, Sherlock, and John more than Donovan, well, they were leading the investigation, weren't they? Perfectly excusable. To idiots.
you are able to place your brother in rehab, you are wasting your time. The exit is back that way, please stop wasting my time as well; it's much more valuable."
"We found it on the floor at his feet. It must have slipped out of his hands after he shot himself."
"I will," John promised, smiling at her over his shoulder.

Lauren stilled, then her eyes lifted to meet Sherlock's before narrowing ominously.
"You've looked me up then?" Sherlock asked with an expression that was half smile, half sneer.
"Get out!" Mr. Brenton insisted, pointing forcefully at the garden gate.
John glared up into a face pulled taunt with regret. "Your friends were already on their way to you, John, when I
The bed dipped slightly and John knew Sherlock was beside him again.  The ex-army doctor gasped in surprise and pleasure when a cold washcloth was pressed to his head.  He still had a fairly elevated fever and the cloth felt heavenly.  John turned his head to give more access as the cloth slipped down his neck and onto his chest (he wasn't wearing a shirt).
were you shooting at the wall?" John tried again, biting out every word.
A smirk flittered along John's lips once he was fully sheathed and his hands crept underneath Sherlock's back. Sherlock arched at the touch and found himself lifted until he was straddling John. Sherlock's lips parted in surprise, nowhere near a full "O", but given his usual guarded expressions, it might as well have been.
"Where is John, Sherlock? Do you even know?"
John scrubbed gravel and dirt out of the dreadful scrape along Sherlock's shoulder, cursing colorfully under his breath. "That was an idiotic thing to do, Sherlock!" he scolded, "A very
"Hey, shouldn't you still be having drinks with Greg?" her voice was warm and welcoming, if somewhat concerned.
"What do people usually say?"
"Don't say that," John yawned, stretching as he stood. "I might take you up on it."
. It wasn't a strong sexual pleaser, but a lazy sensual haze, sweeping down his body from his neck as John's saliva mixed with his scent glands, forever changing them.
John's eyebrows creased. "And what? That stopped you? Were you so determined
Mary smirked, patting his shoulder as she passed him. "I'm not in the habit of saying things I don't mean, so take me up on it whenever you want to. Although if you wake me and it's not an emergency, you will be taking your life in your hands."
Again they had stared at each other for a long moment before John spoke. "
Marcus raised an eyebrow. "He worries about you that much?"
"That's Donnevan," Greg said, coming to stand beside John. "She's on my team, and she's a hard worker. She'll do a thorough job of questioning them."
Sherlock looked up as he accepted the phone, a small wry grin on his features. "It's never stopped you from getting it for me, has it?"
Sherlock's breath caught in his throat and his heart stuttered in his chest. It couldn't be, he had dismissed the concept entirely... but he could not deny the way that John was looking at him right now.
"Oh, that's not the half of it! You know he keeps a skull, a real human skull, on his mantelpiece for 'company.' And, he has a riding crop mixed in with the fireplace pokers. When I asked, he informed me that he had used it to
The police and Sherlock had tried to convince him to go to the hospital, but John had adamantly refused. Sure hypothermia was setting in, but a night under warm blankets would fix that right as rain and he would be a hell of a lot more comfortable in his own damn bed. Being a doctor, John knew there was relatively little, outside of prescribing, he could do for people that they couldn't do for themselves.
"Yes," John agreed, moving his finger more forcefully inside Marcus. The muscles were tight around his finger, but Marcus was experienced and eager; he didn't seem to be in any pain or discomfort.
Sherlock shrugged. "What would be the point in lying to you?"
"I'm sorry, John," Mycroft said evenly.
under control."
"Don't try to deny it; the evidence is all against you."
"This is something chronic?" John pressed. "No cure, you're certain?"
Lestrade's voice was warm when he said John's name, and Sherlock bristled at the implication that John was an expected part of his life. He had been who he was for a long time before John Watson ever came on scene.
John leaned in to kiss her cheek and replied, "Thank you, love. We noticed when we set our bags down."
Greetings, and welcome back for another chapter of Choosing Love! ^_^

When John did pull back, it was only slightly, their breath still mingled as he opened his eyes to smile at James, who was smiling back at him. "I'll see you around, John."
