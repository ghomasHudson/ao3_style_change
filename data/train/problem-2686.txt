“Roses are so lovely,” she says, carefully snipping the stems at precise 45 degree angles, “They really brighten the place up.”
Then one summer day John felt the wind whip up around him, encircling him with an overwhelming sense of loss unrelated to the relief he’d been feeling about the end of the school term. The music swelled as it spoke of heartbreak and memories and John felt tears that were not his own slide down his face. Without thinking he reached his hands into the gale.
“Oh, come on.” Sherlock said, seeing their blank looks. “Carolers ring the doorbell. People disable their alarm system, open the door and stand at the front of the house while they sing two, maybe three songs. Then, depending on their level of holiday spirit, stand there chatting for another 5 minutes.”

Go home. -SH
John felt his heartbeat quicken as Sherlock’s pale eyes met his. He felt that perhaps he should say something but then Sherlock turned up his coat collar and resumed texting, somehow navigating the path with ease despite the fact that he didn’t glance up once the rest of the way home.
“Look at this,” she said, handing him an envelope from her purse.
Maybe then you can perform an experiment of your own if you know what I mean.
An overwhelming sense of helplessness washes over John and he does the only thing he can think to do, which is to slide in beside Sherlock and pull him into his arms. He whispers wordless sounds of comfort and brings his cheek to rest against Sherlock’s soft curls. After a while Sherlock’s sobs turn to little hiccups, then his breathing evens out but he stays buried in John’s arms.

“Real crowd pleaser,” John grumbled. She had indeed seemed charmed when he’d handed it to her and he was sure the evening would have ended quite differently if he could have just kept his stupid mouth shut and his mind off Sherlock.
Yellow Rose meaning: sincere friendship (without romance)
“Well, well, well,” he murmured, “If it isn’t one of the players now.”
Before John could ask how any of this was relevant, Sherlock added, “I couldn’t risk you getting arrested too. There’d be no one to bail us out.”
“No.”
“I needed my phone,” Sherlock said calmly, as if that explained everything.
“Now do you see, Watson?”
Sherlock’s reply came immediately.
“No, but you want to be.”
“Sherlock, you okay?” John asked, sliding to a stop in front of him.
16 December 21:37
Here’s the rest of the story he got after Winter’s interrogation:
“Maybe he moved out after he finished?” John suggests.
They both looked at him, John with visible relief and Cynthia with annoyance. John nodded and placed a hand on Sherlock’s arm, pointing to the seats in the third row near the aisle.
“We could go now if you’ve got time,” she offered, gathering the packages around her.
Rosebud meaning: Anticipation and the opening of the heart and spirit to treasured dreams and the fulfillment of desires. Also a symbol of new romance. [
Sherlock had no idea. He couldn’t think. Another hit. That would make everything better. Whenever the drugs wore off the voice returned again and again and again. Sometimes the voice was hopeful (

I found myself liking this man less by the second. He was clearly one of those fellows who would tell people what they wanted to hear in order to manipulate them and get what he wanted. Luckily Sherlock Holmes was not one to fall for such a cheap trick.

“Look,” John says, “I’ve been trying to figure out how to do this. I’ve wanted this for so long but I just kept convincing myself it wasn’t possible.
“Why aren’t you there now?" he asked, "This is the Christmas murder you were waiting for.”
Mycroft wrinkled his nose. He wasn’t sure what his tailor would have to say about that request.
John laughed. “No, idiot. I mean here, in this moment.” He paused for a beat, in which he brushed his fingers against Sherlock’s wrist. When Sherlock’s hand twitched but didn’t pull away, John continued, “I wish I could stay like this, with you, forever.”
By the time he got outside though, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John had half a mind to turn around and head straight back to Baker Street, maybe have a cuppa and a few minutes of quiet before Sherlock came swirling in, ranting about the incompetence of everyone in the criminal justice system. Instead he began walking toward the courthouse, fully aware that the way he continued to follow Sherlock like a dutiful puppy was the reason people assumed he was either crazy or in love.
?” Sherlock snapped, “like the way you look at Molly Hooper?”
“Then why do you insist on skipping meals when you’re on a case?”
John watched Molly and Greg descend the stairs together and tried to ignore the prickle of jealousy as they stepped out into the street hand in hand. He was happy for them of course, but their easy flirtation that had intensified as the night wore on made it difficult for him to deny that what they had was what he wanted with Sherlock. The knowledge that they both felt the same way, the rising euphoria of falling in love.
“That is unimportant,” Holmes said. “Pray tell us why you are here, Lord Queensberry, and I will see if your case warrants our attention.”
“Several of the children were singing the same insipid Christmas song. Coincidence, you say? No. They were in different houses, were different ages, and judging by the toys, had different interests. So why would they be singing the same song unless they’d all heard it earlier that evening. None of the residents were playing Christmas music. So, carolers. Ridiculous tradition but not uncommon in a neighborhood like that.”
He turns toward the officers who are converging on Winter’s collapsed form.
John sighs and tries to tell her it’s not like that, that he’s just helping Sherlock through a tough time but his heart isn’t really in it. He can’t help wishing that this change was permanent, then feels guilty all over again because what he really should be wishing is for Sherlock’s insecurities to ease sooner rather than later even if it means sleeping apart.
So, this is pretty much based on my own first time skating. I’m a dancer, so people said it should be easy enough. Turns out, it’s really freaking hard. Like Sherlock, I got the hang of it eventually (after spending the first 15-20 minutes inching my way around the edge while my partner went zipping around the rink like he'd been doing it his whole life).
“And yet you still insist on living with me.”
After a minute John manages to pull his attention away. He’s not sure how long it will take before Sherlock decides to emerge from his mind palace so he settles in with a fresh cup of tea and opens his laptop to write up yesterday’s case for the blog. Instead he finds himself glancing up at Sherlock’s reclined form. Sherlock is fascinating even when he’s quietly sifting through his mind palace like this and John has almost managed to convince himself that his silent observations of his flatmate are entirely for practical reasons. Like enabling him paint a clearer picture of Sherlock in his stories - not that he ever writes any of this on his blog. Of course not.
“John thinks she needs to spend more time with kids her age,” Sherlock said, then added, “He’s probably right.”
“So you were just interested in getting into her bed? Sorry John, I don’t think there’s a flower for that. Although I suppose coriander could work. It’s supposed to symbolize lust.”
“The guy who disappeared two weeks ago.”
“Sherlock?”
It didn’t matter what they thought. Sherlock did have someone to confide in, someone who seemed to know him better than he knew himself. The more he played his violin the more the connection to his mysterious friend grew and the returning breeze was fueled with feelings of adrenaline and purpose.
He starts to turn away. “Apparently I miscalculated. I’m sorry. I just-”
“Thought about it, but she was dating someone else most of the time I knew her.”
“Look around. Do you see any?”
7 February 13:13
In which a cup of holiday tea and a conversation with John brings up some bittersweet feelings for Sherlock.
Sherlock frowns. “He should have figured it out by now. It’s been three days and he hasn’t said
Evans nodded at the plastic bag containing Sherlock’s personal items that he’d left behind - watch that cost more than John had in his savings account, scraps of paper with illegible scribbles, phone with multiple text alerts blinking, and a wallet, which contained exactly the amount needed.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, “You only have to look at them to see that they weren’t a couple. They’d never even met until they were forced into this car together and left to die.”
The Yard is a hive of activity when they arrive. A couple of techs are running the images of the victims through a database and several others are searching manually through vehicle records, missing person reports, and immigration visas. Lestrade is in the conference room, annoyed by the lack of help the forensics report provided.
Behind him Sherlock still looked perplexed. “But why?”
“It wasn’t very efficient. It took over an hour before they arrested me. I realized that there are quicker ways to get your attention.”
Of course, he’s still Sherlock Holmes, brilliant as ever, and once I was there he went off to solve his Christmas murder. The body really had been frozen through so it would take about a week to thaw properly for the autopsy. However, it was clear that Davies’s body had been frozen elsewhere after his death, then moved to the woods, so Sherlock went looking around for clues.
Mycroft said nothing but handed Sherlock his violin. He cradled it gently, plucked at the strings, grimaced, and fiddled with the tuning pegs.
“Nothing unusual. Just Christmas dinner. You know Father likes Christmas carols so we were forced to listen to him humming off-key for the entire month of December. Mummy would usually make me play something on the violin to drown him out after a few days. And I’ve already told you about the ridiculous family photos and Mycroft’s gingerbread mansions.”
He shook his head and glanced down at the next item Rosie was adding to her list:
less than four years to learn my name.”
-----
A horn honks on the street below and John jolts out of his reverie only to realize that he’s been staring at his blank screen for an hour. Or rather, he’s been staring over the blank screen at Sherlock for an hour. His cursor blinks accusingly at him. He sighs and returns to the kitchen to replace his now cold tea. When he returns to his desk he brings the lavender rose with him.
Sherlock’s eyes sweep up and down the papers and he frowns, “Nothing in his business records showing what the job was.”
Holmes half-rose from his chair. “Anything you have to say to me can be said in front of Watson or not at all.”
“I hope I never have to find out,” he said quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
She stopped suddenly as she realized what she’d just said.
Sherlock sighed. He was trying to focus on the images that a girl in his homeless network had sent him - a lead on Lestrade’s missing person case, but his mind kept returning to his conversation with John last night at Angelo’s. They’d talked about their first case, the fact that John considered Sherlock his family, and...there was something else he’d been about to say, but they’d been pulled away on a case with Hopkins before he’d gotten the chance.
The way John’s hand lingered on his shoulder when rousing him from some experiment or other, the way he didn’t pull back when Sherlock grabbed his hand to lead him through the dark London streets on yet another midnight chase.
“Social experiment, John. I thought certain biases might prompt a premature assumption which would result in an unfavorable reaction.”
I looked away. “But couldn’t he just be more...discreet? I mean, if it would save him from -”
Each day the list grows, but there’s always one thing that John never says.
“What?” John and Stella asked in unison.
“Got caught impersonating a police officer.”
because you’re being deliberately unhelpful. Tell me what you know or leave.”
“Do you know how they’re connected?” Lestrade asks.
-----
John pauses, thinks of the roses sitting on the table in 221B, then types, “Experiment?”
Sherlock nodded.
John made a noise of disbelief.
“No, don’t apologize. We always save each other. It’s what we do. Since the day Mike introduced us at Bart’s. When we met I had nothing. But you see through everyone and everything and I think even then you knew that we could be so much more together than we could ever be apart.”
John appeared behind him. His hair was still slightly damp from the shower and he was wearing a new holiday jumper covered in snowflakes and pine trees.
Back in the sitting room, Sherlock hovered awkwardly by the door as John dropped another log onto the dying fire.
John eyes the liquid in the cylinder suspiciously. It’s clear and looks innocuous enough, but there’s no telling what sort of chemicals Sherlock has lying around the flat.
“Obviously,” said Sherlock, “Unless I have a companion who can magically turn invisible.”
They sipped their coffees in silence for several minutes.
John chuckled. “Well, yeah, I guess it would be nice, but I don’t expect it. Don’t think she expects anything either. It’s just a nice gesture. Bit traditional, you know?” He looked back at his reflection.
“Not to my knowledge, but it’s something I would be unsurprised to hear you say.”
“I’ve got a shift at the surgery. One of their doctors is on holiday.” John says as he begins clearing the table.
Lestrade's frustrating week improves when he meets Molly for coffee.
“My dear fellow, have I ever talked of women with rainbow coloured hair?” Holmes asked as one walked past our hiding place.
So, Sherlock solved a murder and was home in time to help Rosie hang Christmas stockings by the fireplace. Even after all this time, I’m in awe of the way he cares so deeply about her. She’s incredibly lucky to have him in her life. And so am I.
Sherlock gave a sharp nod and waited as John tried to figure out how to express just how much he didn’t mind having Sherlock in his bed without scaring him off. In the end he gave up and settled for commenting on Greg and Molly’s new closeness during the party. Sherlock shrugged it off, saying it was inevitable and began rearranging the stack of presents Molly had left under the tree.
When they arrive at Baker Street, John is grateful for Sherlock’s help up the stairs. The meds they gave him at the hospital are wearing off and he feels a dull throbbing in his ankle and a faint headache beginning to form. When they reach the landing John glances wearily at the stairs that lead up to his bedroom but Sherlock steers him forcefully down the hall to his own room. He all but lifts John into the bed then whisks out of the room. He returns minutes later, arms full of supplies - a bottle of painkillers, water, an extra pillow and an ice pack.
was hurt, possibly dying. He left the crime scene at a sprint, ignoring Lestrade’s confused shouts.
“Family photo sessions are tedious. I have no desire to relive that.”
“Why?” Sherlock looks at the clock, “You’re always here for at least another hour. Oh.”
After a time, Holmes emerged from his reverie.
“I know what he is, Watson,” Holmes said, “and that is why I must find young Robbie. It is imperative that I understand the whole story behind these stolen keys before I decide whether the case can be safely abandoned or if it needs to be seen through to a satisfactory conclusion.”
Sherlock ignores her. “Are you sure I can’t stay? I’ll lock up for you.”
Sherlock nodded and fiddled with the oven as Rosie ran over to give John a hug.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
They descend and find a shelter that would have been big enough for at least 20 people to take shelter from the blitz but at the moment there’s barely room for the two of them. John squeezes around the machines at the center and peers under the sheet covering one of them.
“This is nothing,” John says. He flexes his foot tentatively and gives a slight grimace. “Bit inconvenient at the moment but I’m fine.”
When John wakes, he feels long fingers wrapped gently around his wrist and in the dim morning light he sees Sherlock’s pale eyes staring back, filled with doubt and longing. John remembers the words whispered into the night and finally realizes that this has little to do with half-forgotten memories. It has everything to do with him, John, and the future. Their future.
But at that moment a loud ring sounded from Sherlock’s pocket. They both jumped and John reluctantly let go of Sherlock’s hand as he reached for his phone. Sherlock glared at the screen but answered anyway.
“You’re deflecting.” Sherlock says, “That means I’m right. And also that it’s someone we know. But who - ”
Same here. I’m always happy to help.
He taps his screen again and over his shoulder John sees a photo of the closed up locksmith’s business they had circled the day before.
Every morning John wakes first and waits. As Sherlock stirs, John brushes his fingers lightly down his arm and gives his hand a gentle squeeze. Sherlock wraps his fingers around John’s wrist to feel his steady, if slightly elevated, pulse while John whispers all the things he wants Sherlock to remember when waking:
“If you are not averse to a bit of adventure so late in the evening I should enjoy your company, Watson.”
Still, I feel compelled to set this story down, if only as an attempt to make sense of the confusing series of life-altering events that transpired. Certain precautions have been taken in the intervening years and Sherlock Holmes has assented to let me recount the case for my personal files, though only after I swore that it would never be published. On that account he should not have to worry, as my days of serializing our adventures in the Strand are long gone.
Cabbage Rose meaning: Ambassador of Love
He disappeared into the kitchen, then returned a minute later with a candle and some appetizers.
“Yes, but why? Why does it matter what anyone says about me?”
, John thought as he shoved the money over, then hurried after Sherlock before anyone in the station could comment further.
He hated himself for hoping, but maybe, just maybe...
Sherlock glanced out the window. As far as he was concerned, a night alone with John would be a far better way to spend the evening than filling their home with unnecessary people. At least this year it would only be Molly and Greg joining them. Mycroft had thankfully declined John’s invitation; they’d see him at Christmas anyway and that was more than enough.
Sherlock, of course had insulted two junior officers for their inability to immediately comprehend his rapid-fire explanation of the deductions that had led them to the abandoned warehouse, and had vanished as soon as Lestrade confirmed that the suspects were in custody. As often as he chastised Sherlock for the way he constantly insulted the Yarders, John had to agree with him today. Lestrade usually took their statements but he’d been pulled away to meet with the visiting Superintendent and the two officers who interviewed him this time took so long that it seemed intentional. They’d also spent a good ten minutes of the interview making not-so-subtle hints about the nature of his and Sherlock’s relationship.
. Come say hi!
When Sherlock doesn’t return by lunchtime John ventures out for a walk. He wanders aimlessly and as he passes a flower shop, decides he may as well pick out some roses to replace the ones from before the Garridebs case.
“But this wasn’t supposed to happen,” Sherlock says, gesturing at John’s ankle.
Sherlock realized he’d been staring and turned back to his violin.
There was every indication that the man in question had run off on his own, but something about it still nagged at him and he couldn’t bring himself to close the case. He’d even brought Sherlock in to consult, but the frustrating man hadn’t found it interesting enough to be worth his full attention and had pawned the legwork off onto his homeless network, none of whom had found any leads.
12 roses: be mine. Also, a single red rose means “I love you very deeply”
“So?”
John shrugs apologetically and Lestrade tries to hide a smile behind an exasperated sigh as they follow. They still don’t know who their suspect is but Lestrade makes arrangements to stakeout the area. To Sherlock’s annoyance, Lestrade excludes him from the plans.
7 February 13:47
Sherlock’s eyes drift over the roses on the mantelpiece before settling on the one in John’s hands.
Sherlock gave him a searching look and John thought he could hear his own heart beating, filling the silence.
Sherlock pulled a small package from inside his coat and tossed it to him.
If you feel like making some paper airplanes
“Only because you have me,” John shot back. “What would you do if I weren’t around, huh?”
On nights when Sherlock is particularly restless, John reads out stories of their adventures from his blog. Sherlock tries to scoff at John’s romantic prose and sentence fragments and the way he overuses parentheticals but John knows better than to take him seriously, especially when he drifts off to sleep with a smile on his face as John runs his fingers through his hair.
“I’ve been told I have that effect on people.”
He shoves his own pillow over and curls up on his side using a corner of the bedsheet to wipe his nose. John sighs and rummages in the bedside table until he finds a handkerchief. He passes it over and rubs gentle circles on Sherlock’s back as he snuffles into it. When he tosses it aside John pulls him over gently to face him again.
“Ready?” John asks.
John laughed.
“Yes, thank you. Bye bye, now,” Sherlock says, wiggling his fingers as Mycroft shows himself out.
“You were right.”
Sherlock tugs on the blanket that John doesn’t remember having when he fell asleep.
Chapter 4: "Winter Sports", In which Sherlock goes ice skating for the first time and discovers it’s not as easy as it looks. Lucky for him he has an excellent teacher.
“John?”
“Do they ever get you anything?” Sherlock asked.
“Come on, it’ll be fun.”
“The time traveling tomb?” I laughed, “That’s a hoax, a fairy tale.”
“Is this part of your experiment?”
This morning when he limps into the kitchen he finds Sherlock hunched over his microscope and a reddish-orange flower sitting next to a freshly brewed pot of tea. Like yesterday’s rose it looks more like a garden variety than the type usually found in flower shops.
A prelude to something amazing.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says again.
“And you must be Dr. Watson. I’ve read your stories in the Strand of course. I hadn’t realized you would be here.”
John smiles. “Come on, Sherlock. It’s your experiment. The data is all in front of you. Figure it out.”
John made his way up the stairs, arms laden with groceries, and found 221B deserted. Rosie was downstairs with Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock had disappeared earlier that morning. He’d said something about seeing to her Father Christmas gift, but John thought it was probably just an excuse to get out of preparations for their holiday party that night.
Of course when Sherlock learned the name of the famous counterfeiter he called all the investigators on the case morons for not making the connection between that case and the Garridebs sooner. Nice to know his sympathies don’t extend beyond the walls of this flat. I’d be a little worried if he was suddenly being nice to everyone.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice sounded odd, there was a bit of an echo as if he were in an empty room. “Can you meet me?”
“We don’t get to control how these things work,” his father said, laying a hand upon his shoulder. “There are some things we’ll never understand.”
He hold out the bank statement and the corresponding page of Prescott’s ledger.
Time always passes slowly when Sherlock goes into one of his silent spells but it’s even worse now that John can’t do anything to distract himself. He never realized how often he normally gets up to fetch something or other throughout the day. Sherlock seems happy enough to bring him whatever he needs but continues to ignore any attempts at conversation.
“Sure, sweetie,” John said, and shot Sherlock a look before he could say anything else about his brother.
He can’t say he misses the being on constant alert but the blood pumping through his veins would at least keep him awake during long hours of waiting. He wonders though, if it’s purely the threat of discovery that causes his elevated pulse on those occasions or if the real culprit is the proximity to Sherlock, who is usually squashed next to him in some dark corner instead of sprawled in the back seat of Lestrade’s car.
Holmes rose and began pacing the room. “They’re using his novel against him. Since when is fiction used as courtroom evidence? It’s absolutely ridiculous.”
John shook his head but felt a smile creeping across his face in spite of himself. This was what he loved about life with Sherlock - these small, thoughtful gestures blended with the pure unpredictability of everyday life. He still wasn’t entirely sure that Sherlock felt the same way about him, but he’d never know unless he tried again.
-----
“How did you even -” John started, then shrugged and headed upstairs.
That’s amazing!
There's one more chapter (a brief epilogue) which will be posted by next weekend. Have a wonderful week!
“What are you waiting on?” John asks.
John rolled his eyes. Of course he didn’t care. The longer they lived together the clearer it became that money was of no great concern for Sherlock. Sometimes John wondered why he’d claimed to need help paying the rent when they’d first met.
She handed him a paper that looked to be a few days old.
John laughed and turned in a quick circle to check that they were out of the other skaters' way.
“Not so easy, is it?”
“Well, come on then, my rosebud boy,” he says.
“Sherlock...are you baking?”
John lifts his hand, hesitates, then reaches out and places it over Sherlock’s, willing him to relax his grip.
At this point Sherlock would normally be jumping up and down with excitement, like a child at Christmas, but this time he had an actual child with him. Not knowing he was about to stumble across a murder case, he’d taken Rosie with him to the Winter Wonderland. Yes, I know what some of you may be thinking and there’s a reason I don’t talk about my daughter on here much, but Sherlock really is an amazing parent.
As always, thanks for reading. Next chapter will be posted sometime this weekend.

Sherlock blinks up at him blearily, “Tuesday?” The end of the word rises in a question.
“John. I’m -”
Also, It's the weekend! Which means I have time to play catch-up on these prompts. Stay tuned.
Dr. Montgomery’s mouth twitches in amusement as she turns back to John who nods his consent. She begins to go over the details of John’s chart, interrupted frequently by Sherlock’s questions until his phone rings and puts a stop to the interrogation.
7 February 14:28
Sherlock nods, then raises an eyebrow. “A coffee date? Really?”
“Of course it’s not, said Sherlock, “Because unlike me,
Also, you may have noticed that the number of chapters has increased. My plan on how to break up the remaining sections changed and that is the result.
But the feelings that drifted back to him on the last quivering notes of his most recent composition were far too human. He knew then that this was the person his mother spoke of when she told him his music would save a life and he prayed that one day fate, or circumstance, or whatever forces of the universe existed, would bring them together.
John himself had been just as enthralled by the graceful lines of Sherlock’s body, the way he made every movement look effortless, and the passion that radiated from him during his performance. Still, there was a different element once ice skates were involved.
Greg couldn’t help smiling at the way Sherlock looked at Rosie with such love in his eyes, the way he put her and John before everything else, even his work.
Sherlock nods and takes a seat in his chair by the fire but gets up almost immediately and moves to the desk. After a few minutes of typing on his laptop he discards that as well and crosses to the fridge to peek at one of his experiments. He finally settles for picking up his violin and drawing the bow across the strings. The tune is familiar - one of his own compositions, and John lets the music wash over him.
“Why couldn’t she?”
“Of course I was,” says Sherlock, but John can see the relief on his face. He snaps a couple of photos with his phone then they climb back up the stairs and replace the trapdoor. Sherlock frets about the dust they disturbed but John assures him that no one would notice unless they’re Sherlock Holmes.
“So, let’s go over this again,” he said once they had returned to Stella's office, "some of the houses were broken into but nothing was taken."
What on earth would I want a vase for? It’s an
“John! John! Are you hurt?”
A second later, he stumbled forward and only avoided falling by grabbing onto John’s arm.

Sherlock met his gaze in the mirror, his eyebrows raised, clearly skeptical.
“It’s just...I don’t know what’s real anymore. I can’t trust my memory. Victor was my best friend but I forgot he ever existed. How could I have done that?”
Blue rose meaning: A tantalizing vision that cannot be totally pinned down, a mystery that cannot be fully unraveled. Since the blue rose itself is a rarity in nature, it stands for something that is hardly within one's grasp. Thus the blue rose is admired and revered as an unrealizable dream.[
“Fine then, what’s yours?”
He breathed in the steam and caught the faint scent of...what was that? Ugh, Peppermint. He sighed. He should have expected this when he’d asked John to have tea waiting for him despite not having done the shopping. Why did Christmas make people feel like they needed to infuse every beverage with melted candy canes?
He was absolutely amazing making sure I was okay. Though if I’m being completely honest I think he went a bit overboard. I doubt the hospital staff were too pleased to have him around. If any of them are reading this, I’d like to apologize for whatever he did or said while I was asleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
John should be used to finding unexpected things on the kitchen table. It’s an occupational hazard of living with Sherlock Holmes. He’s gotten used to the severed heads in the fridge, eyeballs in the microwave and toxic chemicals on the drainboard but this is different. Less hazardous, yes, but also more...confusing.
I thought of my marriage to Mary Morstan, who I saw only sporadically these days, and our home to which I often returned only to sleep. I rarely even ate there anymore, instead taking most of my meals at Baker Street with Holmes while my wife paid social calls to her dear friend.
Then he remembers the circumstances under which Sherlock set out his yellow rose. The declined dinner invitation of the day prior, Sherlock’s sulking response to John’s admiration of the flower and his subsequent uptick in mood when John admitted to liking the orange rose better.
“You’re thinking too hard.”
He stopped until I caught up with him, then set off again at a more reasonable pace.
Her phone buzzed and she fished it out of her pocket reluctantly. No doubt it was Meena following up on her promise to set up an online dating profile for her.
“Sorry about him,” John says, nodding toward the door, “hope he wasn’t terrorising you all too much while I was crashed out.”
Molly looks up from the brain she’s examining. Sherlock is leaning back against the counter with his arms crossed, looking for all the world like a pouting child.
John nods. This unwavering trust they both have in Sherlock scares him sometimes.
“You’re doing a good job with her. You’re good together.”
She chuckles and shakes her head, “There’s the understatement of the year. We had a group of nursing students here doing observations when you came in. I think two of them decided to become lab techs instead.”
John shook his head and returned his focus to her. They both got through a summarized version of their current work and living situations, and had started on their entrees before John’s text alert chimed again several times in rapid succession. He glanced down, meaning to turn it off, but couldn’t help reading:
(See the end of the chapter for
John chuckles and leans back against Sherlock’s arm, taking in the patch of sky and the twinkling stars. Sherlock continues to stare up at the sky for several minutes and it strikes John once again how very like a child Sherlock can be with his pure fascination with the world around him.
Greg sighed. Molly was right; it might take a miracle for the two of them to admit their feelings for one another but that didn’t mean he couldn’t try.
That night John dreams about Sherlock. It’s not an unusual occurrence but it’s particularly awkward this time when he wakes up in Sherlock’s bed thoroughly aroused with the lingering image of Sherlock lying naked beside him, long thin fingers slowly caressing every inch of his body.
Over the past months, John has begun to catalog the hundreds of expressions that cross Sherlock’s face. Lately it seems that he’s memorized every detail about Sherlock, to the point that he feels he needs his own mind palace to store it all. Perhaps he’ll make himself a little memory bungalow, he thinks. But then he realizes that the only things he’d store there would be about Sherlock and what would that accomplish?
“Right,” John said, shifting uncomfortably, “Well, be sure to follow up with us if you don’t see any improvement in a week.”
The table was set. Twinkling lights were draped over the tree and the majority of the room. Their guests were set to arrive any minute.
“Sure,” John said, “but you’ll have to convince her to give up some of her other ones. She’s run out of space on her bed so they’ve started migrating over to mine.”
So, I’ve been laid up for the past few days as a result of our most recent case. Nothing serious, just a rather badly sprained ankle but I swear Sherlock’s been acting like I’m on death’s doorstep. Can’t say I’m complaining though. It’s nice to have him take care of me for a change.
They lapsed into silence, then after a few minutes, John nudged Sherlock.
In desperation Sherlock turned to his music but the connection had dimmed. His ‘friend’, for lack of a better word, seemed to have moved on, or at the very least, had found someone else to confide in. So when a young man called Wiggins offered him a way to escape, he reached without hesitation for the needle.
John found himself glancing across at Sherlock more than usual as they worked their way through the meal Angelo had prepared for them. Sherlock was always fascinating, but the flickering light dancing across his face made him seem ethereal and John wondered, not for the first time, whether what he wanted was even possible. Whether he should just be happy with what he had.
“Why is that, I wonder?” he asked with a smirk.
Sherlock is kneeling, a flashlight gripped between his lips as he runs his hands across the floor. John crouches down and joins him, using the light from his phone to aid their search. The dust is much thinner here and John realizes that they’re looking for a hidden compartment or trap door. He wouldn’t have expected to find one in a warehouse, but he supposes this falls under Sherlock’s theory of “when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
An hour later John has taken over squinting through the binoculars while Lestrade checks in with the rest of his team - no sign of anyone approaching the area except a couple of teenagers sneaking past for a river-side snog.
Sherlock’s back was turned to the door but he heard John place something on the bedside table and take a seat at the edge of the bed.
Mycroft rose to leave, “You might try contacting Detective Inspector Lestrade at Scotland Yard.”
Hope you all had a happy Christmas! I'll still be updating regularly even though these chapters will be a bit after the fact now that Christmas is over. Thanks for following along!
He watches as Sherlock receives the text and types a reply. There’s a two second delay before he receives the message.
not your patient isn’t it?”
Still, now that it was the three of them, John couldn’t help wondering. Sherlock had embraced his role as a second parent in Rosie’s life, but what exactly did it mean about their relationship? There were “nontraditional” family structures, and then there was them. He wasn’t sure how many more times he could stand correcting people who mistook them for a couple when all he really wanted was for it to be true.
“Didn’t Lestrade mention this place?”
“Darling, he’s at peace now,” Mummy whispered, “I’m so sorry, but we need to let him go.”
John watches the even rise and fall of his friend’s steady breaths and feels a sense of contentment wash over him. Every now and then there’s a slight wrinkle in Sherlock’s brow as he peruses a piece of information before his lips quirk upward in an amused smirk or a look of satisfaction. John doesn’t write about these things either.
Holmes shook his head wordlessly and pushed the door open.
When John entered 221B, he found that Sherlock had pulled everything out of the freezer. The space was now occupied with several large cubes of meat instead.
John just stared at him.
16 December 22:05
Sherlock shakes his head .
“How?”
“Sherlock?” He reaches out to touch his shoulder and is surprised to see tears in his eyes, “Did you have a nightmare?”
16 December 20:59
“I’m pretty sure you saved my life on that case last month, you know, the one with the superstitious salesman?” John says.
The song ended as he pushed the sitting room door open and there in front of him stood the person he had been longing for his whole life. The music he heard for so long was no longer just in his head. It was real. It was
Warnings: a (very brief) conversation about murder.
Slight change in the schedule for this coming week: next chapter will likely be posted on Thursday due to some other projects I've got going on.
The five minute walk over wakes John up a bit. Sherlock is a bundle of anxious energy, muttering to himself and striding down the pavement, coat billowing out behind him. After a careful check to make sure the area is deserted, Sherlock forces the window open and they pull themselves inside.
He came to a stop in front of a cafe and blinked in awe. He could hear the music. It wasn't just in his head or floating on the wind, audible to him alone. Passersby glanced up to where the rise and fall of the song drifted through the open window above him.
My companion tore his gaze from the foliage rushing past the window.
“How was deducing the relationship status of the entire jury relevant?”
“So, what, he moved from robbery to counterfeiting?” John asks.
“You got your results then?” John wonders if he’ll finally get an answer as to what the experiment was about.
“They seem favorable.”
Sherlock shrugged.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It doesn’t matter. It’s been a long night. We could both use some sleep.”
John’s brow wrinkles in confusion, “Sorry?”
Sherlock considers for a moment. His eyes flick toward Lestrade who is peering intently toward the warehouse through a pair of binoculars.
Thanks for the reminder! Got to remember to make reservations for me and the wife. How about you, John? Got a date this year, Casanova?
“But it’s not really your fault,” he continued, “You know, I used to read her the stories from my blog at bedtime. I mean there’s only so many times you can say goodnight to every object in a fictional room. I think that’s how it started.”
“Wow, that’s delicious.”
John merely glared at him. The man continued, “You’ve been with him for a while, right? Tell me, is he really as mad as he seems?”
But he didn’t have time to finish the thought before John took his hand. Not the way he had when they shook hands upon first meeting, or when Sherlock led them crashing through back alleys at midnight, or during moments of quiet reassurance in darkened rooms. John’s touch was hesitant but determined. Sherlock’s gaze traveled from their hands to John’s face. In the afternoon light John’s eyes were the color of the stream that ran behind Sherlock’s childhood home.
The look on Sherlock’s face made John immediately regret his words.
As he counted the possible escape routes a murderer could have taken Sherlock felt the wind whip up around him. For a second the body in front of him disappeared and he felt a rush of fear unrelated to his surroundings. The wind twisted itself around his shoulder, bringing with it a dull phantom pain. Then he understood. Something had happened. Somewhere, his
They each go about their own business for the rest of the day but at 6:00 pm sharp, Sherlock disappears into his room to get ready. John retreats upstairs to do the same and is struck by the odd sense that he’s preparing for a date. Which is ridiculous of course. They’ve gone out to dinner together like this countless times.
“Here,” he said, draping it over John’s neck, “Don’t worry. I’ll call you at the usual time with an emergency in case you want a more exciting way to spend the evening.”
John runs his fingers over the rippling petals. “What’s so special about it?”
“Sherlock, what the hell?”
John reached for a book on the dresser but Rosie stopped him.”
Finally Holmes nudged me and I looked up to see a slender silhouette making its way swiftly across the grass. We followed at a distance, ducking in and out of the trees. Eventually we came to a clearing near the center of the cemetery in the middle of which stood an impressive twenty foot high mausoleum made of granite. Its peak resembled a pyramid which towered over the rest of the grave markers surrounding it and I was so intent in taking the sight in that I nearly missed the young man pull a set of keys from his pocket.
Sherlock shrugs. “You saved my life. It’s only fair.”
John wakes slowly. It’s extremely comfortable lying here among Sherlock’s silky sheets and unusually fluffy pillows. He rolls over and breathes in the lingering scent of Sherlock’s shampoo and wonders what it would be like to wake up in this bed every morning with Sherlock by his side. After recent events the thought doesn’t seem quite as impossible as it used to.
-----
I have been cautioned against setting this story down on paper for a variety of reasons. The most obvious being that, if found, this entire manuscript will likely be dismissed as fraudulent - a cheap and badly planned hoax with little to no credibility. But the real fear is that this tale, fantastic though it seems, could be believed by the wrong people who would take the facts and use them for their own malicious ends.
Sherlock stood at the edge of the trees, watching the officers walk back and forth down the path, cataloging the scene. He had made sure Rosie was facing in the opposite direction so she wouldn’t see the body when it was removed. He knew he should take her home but couldn’t help himself.
11 roses means “You are my treasured one.”
“Of course not,” Sarah said. “Besides, it wasn’t that much of a lie, was it?”
“Go talk to Greg before he has you arrested.”
“Why?” Sherlock asked, but didn’t wait for an answer before settling at John’s side and following his gaze upward.
I sat and helped myself to the savory meal while wondering what Holmes had in store for us that evening. I was sure it had something to do with the case though I couldn’t imagine Holmes consenting to help the Marquess for any reason.
“Yes, I did. I even wrote my schedule on the calendar because I knew you’d delete that information.”
John was right - his ankle isn’t broken but it turns out he also has a mild concussion from when he hit the ground. That, combined with the lack of sleep over the past two days and the adrenaline crash causes him to slip in and out of consciousness as he waits between scans. Sherlock hovers nearby complaining about not being given information and demands that the doctor run more tests than are strictly necessary. Finally John is admitted to an overnight room, a single thanks to Sherlock. He drifts in and out of sleep, vaguely aware of Sherlock’s presence by his bedside. Nurses come by at regular intervals to wake him and take his vitals. A couple of times he thinks he feels Sherlock’s hand grasping his, but slips off to sleep again before he can be sure.
“Sherlock?”
“John?”
“I know you don’t really like peppermint,” John said, handing him the second mug, “but at least it’ll warm you up a bit.
John opens his mouth then closes it, unsure how to respond. Sherlock pulls out his phone and falls silent again but John’s brain refuses to follow suit. Too many thoughts are now swirling through his mind and he wishes it would just shut the hell up.
“Can’t say the same of that young lad he’s accused of being with,” I continued, “Apparently the prosecution isn’t permitted to speak his name aloud in the courtroom due to his status.”
Sherlock gave him a look that said it should be obvious.
Not that John had bothered mentioning anything to Sherlock ahead of time. It had been obvious the second John walked through the door though. The usual weariness that hovered around him at the end of a long day at the clinic was absent and in its place was an air of excitement. A last minute invitation then, Sherlock mused as he listened to John climb into the shower down the hall.
“Oh, hello,” she said to Sherlock, then glanced back and forth between him and John, “So this is your -”
“Morning,” John says tentatively.
“At least 12 break-ins were attempted this evening. It’s possible that not all were successful but whoever did this was on a mission.”
Despite his mood, he smirked as he noticed the way the fabric of her dress hugged her body in all the right places and added, “Though perhaps
Sherlock laughed. “That’s generous of her, using one of her Christmas wishes on me.”
“You’re lucky that’s all I did. If you had killed John you would not have left here alive.”
“He’s being impossible.”
Rosie was delighted to have all her favourite people in one place and refused to go to bed while everyone else was still enjoying the party. Finally, after Mrs. Hudson bade them goodnight and returned downstairs, Rosie fell asleep on the couch with her head in Sherlock’s lap while John, Molly and Greg shoved the leftover food into the fridge.
“Nothing,” John replied. He turned off the ringer and slid his phone back into his pocket.
For several minutes, they lay there, just breathing. They’re so close, but with an infinite gap between them.
Rosie giggled. “Can we give Uncle Myc a gingerbread man?”
7 February 13:46
“John. What is all this?”
He kept talking as Rosie's eyes drifted closed, telling her about the dogs and the trails where they’d gone hiking.
John shook his head. “Dad made it clear that he wouldn’t have any of that under his roof. Our Aunt Jo brought her girlfriend ‘round to the house when she was in town a few years before and they had a big row about it. He said she was a bad influence for Harry and me and basically told her to sod off. ‘Course it didn’t matter by then.”
Later that night as the faint strains of a slow lullaby drifted in through the window his mother pulled him close and told him not to worry. She told him that the music on the wind was the sound of his soulmate calling for him across space and time and that someday, when the universe was ready, the pull of the melody would bring them together.
Sherlock remains silent but leans into John’s touch. They stay in this awkward half-hug for several minutes until Sherlock pulls back and his eyes find John’s.
. Beautiful. Perfect.
John paused for a moment to take in the scene in front of him. Sherlock was stirring something in a large bowl while Rosie stood on a step stool beside him and poured in a cup of flour.
“It’s about John.”
Sherlock raises his bow again and this time sets about playing a coherent tune, “I’m sure you’ll figure it out eventually, John. You always do.”
“I know, I’m just saying that’s why she remembered you. She said she was surprised at first when she heard you had a kid. But then she saw you with Rosie and that’s what made her trust you.”
“Yes, thank you.” He turned to Rosie, “Stay with Uncle Greg okay?”
. Come say hello :)
warning: brief mention of homophobia
“That’s why I brought you.”
Also, I’ve settled on an update schedule. New chapters will be posted on Wednesdays and Saturdays unless otherwise noted. Thanks for reading!
Sherlock nods and they venture downstairs for sandwiches at Speedy’s.
“Yeah, no…” John stammered, wishing he knew how to exit this conversation, “I mean, I already have...someone.”
Sherlock frowned at him and snatched the spoon away.
Sherlock nods and leans back against the cushions. They sit there for several minutes, shoulders brushing, each lost in his own thoughts. John is wondering what would happen if he were to reach out and take Sherlock’s hand when Sherlock breaks the silence.
-----
“John?” Sherlock stops, lips hovering millimeters from John’s pulse point, breath ghosting over his skin.
John feels a dormant spark of hope flare up then forces it back down.
“It’s so wonderful getting the post and seeing smiling faces and holiday wishes from loved ones.”
He frowns at the number on the screen. “Mycroft. Why can’t he just bloody text,” he mutters. He gives John’s shoulder a light squeeze before sweeping out of the room to take the call.
John finally managed to get her to sleep by promising that they could decorate the remaining gingerbread people tomorrow, but only if she went to bed without a fuss.
At midnight Lestrade sends his team home, but Sherlock won’t budge. Eventually Lestrade finds a couple of spare blankets and John helps him set up a camp bed in his office before returning to the conference room and curling up on the sofa.

“It’s a surprise.”

“As if I didn’t have enough to do with an ongoing counterfeit case. Now I’ve got to investigate a murder and babysit a consulting detective.”
“No, that’s not it. I’m not -”
7 February 14:25
We had arrived at the entrance to Brompton Cemetery. As Holmes led us on a meandering path through the headstones he rested a hand upon my shoulder so that if any late night mourners saw us we would seem like a concerned man comforting his grieving companion instead of a detective and his partner.
“I’ve pulled her records and Prescott’s,” Lestrade says, waving a hand at the stacks of files on the table. “Maybe we’ll find something.”
“And maybe,” he looks down at the red rose, “Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this was all just another crazy experiment. But you said you wanted some sort of result or reaction or whatever and, well, if it’s not what you want you can just log it down in your notes and we can move on.”
With a shock of horror, John remembers the man’s raw knuckles and the woman’s scratched fingertips, “They were trying to get out.”
“You could have just called. Why the visit?”
“Look, Sarah, about that. I didn’t mean...I was just trying to get her to stop playing matchmaker.”
“Yes, of course,” Queensberry nodded, “But I only wish to recover my property. There are some keys to items of a very sensitive nature and I do not wish to have them inspected. Nothing illegal, I assure you, but highly personal items, as I’m sure you’ll understand. I simply need you to find Robert Ross and retrieve the keys. You will of course, receive compensation for your services.”
Sherlock smiles as he reads the text then replies, “Stay awake.”
-----
“Maybe.” John laughed. “Did it work?”
“What is it?” I whispered, reaching into my pocket for my revolver.
“They talk but they don’t know anything. They call you mad, then call me crazy for sticking around. They think the only reason I’d stay is because I’m getting laid.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but Mycroft caught the fond smile on his face. Despite his apparent indifference to human emotions, Sherlock had always been the sensitive one in the family. No matter how many times Mycroft had tried to warn him that caring was not an advantage, Sherlock’s big heart and desire to be loved had always been his greatest weakness. Or so he’d thought. True, he had watched many times as Sherlock’s unconditional devotion to John Watson had almost destroyed him, but seeing them now, raising this child together, made Mycroft think that perhaps he’d been wrong after all.
John buys a couple of sandwiches from a cafe around the corner. When he returns, Sherlock is seated in the same position, alternating between tapping at his phone and frowning at the list of real estate agents. He places one of the sandwiches in front of Sherlock, who ignores it as expected.
recently been able to admit it to himself – that what he really wanted from Sherlock, the reason he put up with all the crazy adventures, was something more than friendship. Still, it was getting rather costly having to keep bailing Sherlock out.
He hears Sherlock’s exasperated voice in the back of his mind,
Lestrade sighs and tells his team to pull up information on all the locksmiths and real estate agents in London.
Undoubtedly, Prescott knew what he was building but he’d been paid well to keep his silence. In the end though, he started asking questions so Winter decided to make absolutely sure he wouldn’t talk and to take care of Elizabeth Saunders at the same time before she discovered her role the creation of the counterfeit money she deposited as payment. He figured it would be easy enough to make it look like a suicide and gave them false identities to throw the police off the trail for long enough to get out of town.
John forces himself to ignore the way his pulse picks up speed as Sherlock’s fingers brush his wrist. He takes another look through the lens then bites back a laugh, torn between amusement and disapproval.
“Still, it’s generally considered rude to cancel a first date so you’ll probably want to do something to make it up to her.” Sherlock continues, “Perhaps you should give her a rose. Apparently they make everything better, though I would recommend
16 December 21:15
Outwardly Sherlock seems to be doing better even if he still refuses to sleep unless John leads him to the bedroom and slides under the covers with him. They start taking cases again though Sherlock seems content with what he would previously have considered “a five at best”. At crime scenes he keeps John close and constantly glances toward him during his deductions, silently asking confirmation that what he’s observed is really there.
“As if it’s not bad enough that you’re letting her believe in a fat old man with flying reindeer.”
After a long pause, Sherlock said, “I thought I did at the time.”
They both smiled fondly at it, drinking in the festive chatter around them. Other parents greeted them and made the usual small talk as they came up to search for their own child’s ornament.
“Relax, John. We’re fine.”
“A experiment of utmost importance,” Sherlock continues, “one that requires my full attention.”
John goes to the kitchen and dries the dishes just to have something to do. There’s something bothering Sherlock. John knows it has something to do with what happened at Sherrinford, but every time he’d asked about it Sherlock had brushed him off, even going so far as retreating to Mycroft’s for hours on end. Perhaps it’s for the best, John had thought during the first of these excursions - Mycroft would be able to provide some much needed answers about their past, though John’s not sure he trusts him to be entirely truthful, especially now that he knows the lengths Mycroft took to shield Sherlock from his memories.
Even as Sherlock let the bow drop to take his hand John heard the music swell around them.
“John, before you, I never had a reason to think someone could appreciate me for anything other than my work. When Mike introduced us, I asked you to move in because I thought it was what we both needed, but -” he looked up into John’s eyes, “I never imagined you would stay.”
.” John said, lacing his fingers through Sherlock’s, gently squeezing his hand.
“Grant’s out of town.”
“What makes you say that?” John asked.
They sat there for several minutes until Mycroft broke the silence.
Sherlock lifted her gently and carried her to the upstairs bedroom. He tucked her in among her stuffed animals and took a seat on the edge of John’s bed. He watched the steady rise and fall of her breath and listened to Molly and Greg’s voices drifting up from the landing below as they said their goodnights and happy christmas-es.
Really, John? Now who’s being dramatic? I was just being helpful. Isn’t that what one is supposed to do in this sort of situation?
Another message from Greg popped up:
“You miss it.”
The music seemed clearer in the desert than it did in the city. Maybe it was due to the lack of other noises. Or maybe it was simply John’s renewed joy at hearing it again when he thought it was gone forever.
On the surface though, not much has changed. When John posted an announcement about their new relationship status on his blog it turned out that most of his readers had thought they’d been shagging each other senseless for years. It’s a bit anti-climatic to be honest but it doesn’t bother him. Or at least it wouldn’t, if not for the fact that they haven’t actually
“Or how much he was paid,” John adds.
“Tea?” Sherlock asks, by way of greeting.
At first he had wondered if he was going mad. After all, he’d first felt the connection the day they buried Redbeard and once the grief had subsided he thought perhaps the presence that had taken up residence in his mind was his old friend coming back to him.

provides a list of International Suicide Hotlines that you can call any time.
“I’ll never leave you.”
“Relax, John, we were in Lestrade’s conference room the whole time. Actually, I think it helped having Rosie there. She seemed more willing to talk than at the previous meeting.”
So, the Garridebs case is completely wrapped up and we're back on our way with Sherlock's experiment. I ended up writing John's blog because there were some loose ends about the case that I couldn't fit into the previous chapters. The details aren't  really crucial to the overall story but they were bugging me, so here we are. Plus, the comments were fun to write.
“Hmm?”
He must have dozed off because the next thing he knew, the soft sounds of a holiday television programme filled the room and John was sitting on the other end of the couch.
John continues to scroll through the page, looking for anything that could give him a hint about Sherlock’s emotional connection with this rose. Most of the varieties on the list have more fanciful names like “Gilded Sun” (a deep golden yellow), “Sultry Sangria” (a unique purple-pink combination), “Candy Cane Cocktail” (a pink flower that would not look out of place at a princess tea party), and “Rainbow Sorbet” (which looks exactly like one would expect with that sort of name).
“They actually made a holiday card,” he chucked in disbelief.
Sherlock found a good rhythm working with Scotland Yard. Lestrade in particular seemed to take a liking to him and kept trying to invite him over for dinner with his family. He seemed concerned with Sherlock’s lack of support system. Sherlock knew this had at least a bit to do with Donovan and Anderson’s frequent comments about him being a freak with no friends but he didn’t bother to correct them.
This is unchartered territory. They’ve spent the night together in the same room many times, of course. Multiple cases in the English countryside, tiny inns and certain
When John simply glared at him in response Sherlock continued, “This inn is a popular spot for couples on holiday. Well, as popular as anywhere in a town this small can be, I suppose.”
“Holiday visits now, brother mine? Is domestic life turning you sentimental?”
“Okay, and the houses excluded were 2 with owners out of town and 3 with dogs in the backyard.” John continued, counting them off on his fingers.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking,” he said, “sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.”
Also, I really struggled with whether to include the bits about suicide, but in the end it fit with the case. That being said, no matter how bad things seem, there is always another option. You are important. You matter. If you or someone you know are ever considering suicide, please talk to someone.
Oh, roses. How sweet :) Glad you’re doing okay, John. How many roses has he brought home now?
“This area was rebuilt before the Second World War,” Sherlock says, “so it’s not all that surprising.”
“Anticipation,” he whispers.
“What were you thinking, Sherlock,” he asked.
“Ex-wife,” he corrected her, “and no.”
“What?” said Sherlock, “Sleeping together? You have an odd definition of habit - we’ve only done that once before.”
Mycroft had warned him long ago that if he gave into invitations such as these, the elders would find a way to harness his powers to find and unlock the fabled door between this world and the next. He’d never thought much about his brother’s warning - Mycroft had become obsessed with government schemes ever since he left the village and his music for a life in London but Sherlock wasn’t interested in becoming anyone’s tool.
John shook his head. “I don’t mind. I would have let you sleep, but I just...well, it’s still early. I thought maybe we could talk?”
John has never seen him so vulnerable before. Rosie’s been sleeping through the night much better since they moved back to Baker Street so John nods and slips out just long enough to fetch the baby monitor. When he returns Sherlock scoots over to the far side of the bed and John places a hand on the covers. Then he freezes when he realizes the significance of what he’s about to do.
He shook his head to clear it and pulled out his phone. Usually there were a dozen texts from Sherlock throughout the day - requests to add things to the shopping list or random thoughts that were too important to discard but not important enough to file in his mind palace. But today there had just been one text shortly after Rosie finished school saying that they were going to the Winter Wonderland, then another half an hour ago informing him that they were back home.
The day is torture for John. Every time Sherlock brushes his shoulder as he passes or bends to check the wrap on his ankle John fights back the desire to reach up and kiss him or better yet, drag him off to the bedroom to re-enact his dream - he wouldn’t need to worry about his ankle once they’re horizontal.
“Hmm. Well, I suppose this matter can wait a few days,” he says with a smirk. “I see there’s a more pressing case that requires Dr. Watson’s full attention.”
Sure enough when he enters the living room of 221B, Sherlock is curled up on the sofa, back to the door, clad in pyjamas and dressing gown, his bare feet tucked up under the cushion.
“He knows where to find me after he’s located our man. I’ll be waiting.”
John walked over and opened the freezer door. Sure enough, Sherlock had somehow managed to make several large icicles grow from the ceiling. One had fused itself to the top of an ice cream container.
He proceeds to map out the entire itinerary of her evening, complete with a prediction about getting stuck in traffic on the way to the restaurant.
“Do you have acetone?” he says, changing the subject.
“It’s fine,” he said, extending his hand, half as an introduction, half to make sure that Sherlock was real, “It’s all fine.”
“What were you expecting an elf to look like?”
*Comment deleted*
Instead John steps into the shower and closes his eyes as the water slides over his body. He contemplates sliding his hand downward but decides against it. The only thing more mortifying than waking up hard in his best friend’s bed would be having said best friend pick him up off the floor after his ankle gave out while wanking in the shower. So he turns the water as cold as he can stand and lets the icy sensation numb his body.
Valentine’s day is right around the corner. Just saying.
Daddy, look! We’re making gingerbreads!
Despite, or maybe because of this, the elders began to take a greater interest in Sherlock’s music which had developed into his own haunting style. The master violinist who could make water dance as gracefully as a swan offered to teach him to make the wind do his bidding and a famous music theory teacher from the neighbouring town offered to take him on as her protege. But Mummy always said it was up to Sherlock to decide what he wanted to do with his life so he closed the door in their faces.
A hansom was waiting on the street for us and after a word with the driver Holmes climbed in after me. The streets were still crowded but our driver wove in and out with precision and we had soon left the busy streets behind.
John should have known better and just booked a room ahead of time. It would have made this whole thing a lot less awkward.
Then Sherlock breathes one word, “John.”
I was having a bit of technical difficulties uploading this chapter so sorry if you got more than one notification if you've subscribed.
On day five John wakes to find Sherlock rummaging through his wardrobe. Before he has time to ask what the hell he’s doing, Sherlock thrusts a shirt and a pair of jeans at him and races downstairs, talking a mile a minute about dead bodies, love suicides, and “Graham” being “wrong, wrong, wrong!”
“I think that’s appropriate given how long it’s taken us to get here,” Sherlock says, his voice low and rough as his hands fumble with John’s belt buckle.
“Because most valuables are kept in the master bedroom. Stupid thing to do, really.”
His defeated silence was worse than any answer. I felt his pulse pounding beneath my fingers and sensed his confusion and fear.
“You should just talk to him,” she said, “let him know how you feel.”
-----
“Can I pick your outfit too?”
I shook my head in disgust and set the paper aside. “They say they have proof. Does it not implicate them both?”
The holiday decorating in 221B was almost complete. Mrs. Hudson joined them for the finishing touches and snapped a few photos when Sherlock lifted Rosie onto his shoulders to place the star at the top of the Christmas tree.
“When people say relationships cost a lot of money, they usually mean dinner and roses, not bail for repeat offenders.”
He shook his head and forced himself to focus on the task at hand. With some difficulty, he shoved the groceries into the crowded fridge. Then, seeing the mess of experiments and notes covering the kitchen table, reached for his phone and typed a text:
Sherlock frowns at this. “Molly’s expecting us at the lab. She got a couple of new bodies in that she promised we could look at.”
“Good,” said Sherlock, “That thing would haunt my nightmares.”
Sherlock drops onto a chair with a dramatic huff and prods the small collection of fingernails on the table, sorting them by thickness.
“Same alarm system as all the other houses on the street except the one on our left, so same level of difficulty as the other targets. Christmas lights draped over every inch of the roof, add that to the level of upkeep the yard requires - clearly they have enough money that utility costs are not an issue. Probably plenty of valuable trinkets hidden away in there. Light on in the kitchen and second story bedroom at this hour, but no one at the window trying to see what’s going on. Whoever lives there is away for the holidays. Their lights are on a timer. Obvious. Easy and rewarding target.”
“But what about your reputation?” he pressed on as they made their way across an intersection, now heading toward Baker Street, “I swear, you get arrested more than most of the criminals we track down.”
After several minutes, they broke apart.
“Oh!” Mrs. Thompson looked both satisfied and disappointed at the same time. “Well of course you do, dear. I keep telling my Millie that she needs to hurry up and settle down before all the good men are gone.”
She nods, a smile creeping across her face.
“Well, it’s lucky he has you to save the day,” she said.
Sherlock shakes his head, “Look at the dust. Nothing’s been moved in this room for at least a month.” He turns to Lestrade, “your report said the most recent batch of counterfeit bills was printed two weeks ago. Although that’s assuming Anderson and the other idiots on forensics actually know what they’re talking about.”
Sherlock was surprised to realize he hadn’t. The moment he’d seen the corner of the plastic sticking out from under the pine cuttings, he’d known what would be beneath it and had been focused on getting back to Rosie. Curious reaction, he thought.
“Well, he’d be an idiot if he didn’t feel the same,” said Greg.
“Yeah, I mean, I suppose...well, the thing is -”
John reached around him to straighten one of the baubles on the tree and Sherlock felt his breath catch in his throat as their arms brushed. Everything about this holiday season made him long for something more, despite how dangerous he knew it was to hope. But even after John had finished adjusting the ornament, he didn’t pull away.
John gives an exaggerated yawn then types, “Tell me something interesting.”
“It’s good that you’re there, mate,” Lestrade says, “He might not admit it, but he needs you.”
John glanced at Rosie and was struck once again by how quickly time flew when you had a young child. Sure, he and Sherlock had hundreds of photos of her on their phones, but it wasn’t quite the same.
“Oh. Greg,” John corrected automatically.
“We’ll be there in seven minutes,” Sherlock says. He hangs up and sweeps out the door. John drops some money on the table to cover the bill before rushing after him.
He looked over at Rosie in alarm but she was stacking a pile of cushions into a fort for her stuffed animals and looked entirely unaffected.
“What?”
have a warrant. Me. The police. Not you.”
He takes a breath. There’s no going back and maybe it’s selfish but he needs to say this as much for himself as for Sherlock.
Yellow and orange together: “passionate thoughts”
“What about the rose?” Sherlock asked.
. You have a little over an hour to go home and get ready before he picks you up for your dinner reservations. It would be more efficient to just meet there but I suppose that’s part of the romance or something.”
Sherlock looks up and John can see by the way his eyes dart across his face that he’s trying to deduce exactly what John means. He sees fear mingled with hope and knows that this is okay, more than just okay, but he also sees the doubt that creeps into Sherlock’s eyes. There was never any logic when it came to their relationship and though Sherlock has been doing so much better lately, John knows he still has trouble knowing whether his memories and perceptions are fact or fiction. He needs Sherlock to understand now, no ambiguity or chance for misinterpretation.
One look at John’s face was all the answer he needed.
When the foot traffic around him changes from afternoon commuters into couples holding hands on their way to dinner Sherlock turns toward Baker Street and resigns himself to another quiet evening while John does...whatever it is he’s been doing.
Sherlock let those last words sink in.
With everyone he’s dated before there was a certain social protocol, a script to follow. There was the romantic dinner complete with candlelight and wine, the walk home with increasingly suggestive touches, the lingering on the doorstep followed by an invitation to come in for a cup of coffee or to look at a pet tortoise or something else ridiculously transparent. Even the few one night stands he’d had were prefaced by an evening of heated flirtation and a whisper of “my place or yours”.
These people who could not turn melodies into tangible power were called “the silent ones” but Sherlock’s teachers were anything but silent. They taught him about chemical reactions and DNA, they forced him to see below the surface of human emotions, and they shared their stories about other worlds that not even the elders seemed to know.
Yes, of course. I couldn’t have done it without you.
“You might,” Sherlock whispers.
I handed the card to Holmes and an inscrutable look crossed his face.
paid cash. Thousands of pounds in paper currency.”
Sherlock claimed that John’s help would make or break the case, but how was he supposed to be helpful if he was locked out here with Sherlock ignoring his calls to be let in. He’d been half ready to head back to Baker Street on his own to salvage what he could of his day off when two police cars pulled up, sirens blaring. A second later he received a text saying simply:
“Everything alright?” Sarah asked.
“Four that we know of. I’ve got my guys checking in with the other residents now.”
In this manner they made their way around the rink, John breaking eye contact only to glance over his shoulder to check that their path was clear. Every once in awhile, Sherlock’s grip on John’s hands tightened as he steadied himself, but gradually he began to gain confidence.
“I won’t let that happen.”
That being said, you know you can always ask me for help.
“Well? John’s awake to give consent now so will you please tell me what’s wrong with him?”
“Same difference,” Sherlock says and leads the way into the building.

She chuckles to herself then asks, “But what happened with your experiment?”
7 February 13:01
“Restaurant. Family owned and run. Your missing man was seen there several times in the company of this man.” He flipped to another photo, taken the day before, of a man outside the restaurant. The blurry picture quality made it difficult to make out any distinguishing features.
is where Sherlock learned to make the origami rose.
Chapter 6: "Cold", In which we take a peek into Molly Hooper's life.
“What is this?” he asks.
When he returns to Baker Street Mrs. Hudson emerges from the hall as he starts up the stairs.
“Can’t, sorry,” John says as he takes his coat from the hook, “I promised Harry I’d meet up with her this month and tonight’s the only time she was free. I might be out late so make sure you eat something, yeah? There’s some leftover takeaway in the fridge.”
“It’s almost midnight,” John said in answer, “I’m surprised she didn’t wake you when we came down earlier. She wanted to show you her Christmas letter.”
“Did you have any when you were growing up? Christmas traditions, I mean.”
“Maybe you should take your own advice,” he said, turning to look at her.
“I’ll always be here, Sherlock.”
“He sent you, didn’t he? Queensberry?” Ross said, glancing around as though expecting the man to materialize beside us. “You’re known to be a fair man, Mr. Holmes. If you know what that man has done surely you will not take his side.”
John took a steadying breath and started up the stairs, savoring the rich melody ahead of him and the way the air around him shivered with anticipation.
“They must’ve had a system,” John said.
Just as John is slipping off to sleep Sherlock speaks, so softly that John wonders if he’s meant to hear, “I could never forget you, John.” Sherlock’s voice breaks and he continues, “but someday you’ll leave and I’ll wish I could.”
“Well, excuse me.” John grumbled, pushing the gingerbread walls upright again, “You’re the one who refused to let us use milk cartons like normal people.”
“Wait, your family used to send Christmas cards?” John asked, “Why haven’t I seen this?”
“How many times must I tell you, once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.”
16 December 21:27
I offered the article I’d been reading but Holmes waved it away.
John turned the box over and read the description.
“I’m sorry,” he said, “Just…come lay down. The bed’s big enough.”
“This. Dinner. Bringing me out tonight.”
heyhey! it's finally done! sorry for the massive delay but thanks for sticking with me and these two idiots :)

is what the boys ended up getting for little Miss Rosie instead.
John was just getting ready to leave the clinic when his phone chimed with an incoming text. As he reached for it he heard another ping. Then another, and another.
Cheers, Harry
He set the mug aside and rummaged through the cabinets. Surely they couldn’t be completely out of normal tea. Ten minutes and a broken saucer later proved otherwise. All he’d found was the rest of the tea sampler the peppermint blend had come with. Likely a holiday gift exchange from one of John’s co-workers. He turned the box over and scanned the label, unconsciously deducing the gift-giver.
When had this become his reality? John wondered.
After a week of their new sleeping arrangement Mrs. Hudson asks John if they should turn the upstairs bedroom into a proper nursery for Rosie now that her boys have “finally sorted themselves out.” She shows him a sample of wallpaper with cartoon elephants being held aloft by hot air balloons.
On a related note, did you know the
“You lot are all so dim!” Sherlock says, “Look! What’s missing?”
John texts back, “Typo?”
I sank onto the bench and buried my face in my hands.
He turned and they stood facing each other.
Sherlock disappears into his mind palace for a while, only emerging when Lestrade slams a stack of papers down in frustration and exclaims, “It’s got to have something to do with the case. Why else would he have killed them?”
As this thought passed through his mind the music changed into something less soothing, more demanding and John’s addled brain knew immediately that this time it was a message directly for him:
In case you're feeling crafty
“Aha!” said John, picking up the anatomy kit he’d been looking for. He held it out to Sherlock who nodded his approval.
“Who are you?” a voice broke through the odd sensations as the world righted itself. Holmes was still by my side, blinking in the light of a lantern held aloft by a trembling young man.
“It says here ‘red roses signify a true love stronger than thorns and can outlive all obstacles. It also has the connotations of desire, a throbbing heat of new love and consummation.’”
John groaned. “Oh god, what’d he do now?”
“Doesn’t count.”
), sometimes angry (
“That’s not the point!” John said. “I don’t want my daughter going around asking for a Christmas murder. People will get the wrong idea.”
I found him crouched just outside the warehouse door but someone else had found him too. Winter was there and had a gun pointed straight at him. I managed to drag Winter away but in the scuffle I injured my ankle rather badly. Still, it could have been much worse. I don’t even want to think of what could have happened if I hadn’t found him when I did.
After wrapping a few presents for Harry, Molly, and Mrs. Hudson, John peeked over Rosie’s shoulder again and saw that she’d completed her own wishlist and had moved on to requests for other people.
In the morning John wakes to find Sherlock fast asleep beside him, fingers inches from his own. They spend the day as they have for the past week alternating between their solitary pursuits and entertaining Rosie.
As for that date...
John pulled his head back around the corner as Dimmock turned to scan the area.
John closed the gap between them.
Garridebs, guys. Garridebs. I couldn't resist. But now that the case is over we can return to the experiment.
“Well, I’ve got to get to work. But I’m sure you can manage your experiments, social and otherwise, without me.”
“For what?”
So, what’s it like living with Sherlock Holmes?
“It’s not nothing. Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
end up solving it. You probably didn’t notice thanks to John’s inability to write a decent blog post.
Then Sherlock Holmes stepped out of the shadows and strode down the street dodging around strange mechanical contraptions and blinking signs.
She laughed, “I can try talking to John next time he comes by to drop off Rosie alone, but you’ll need to talk to Sherlock.”
“Very well. I am here because something has been stolen from me. And if you’re as good as your friend’s stories claim, you should be able to make quick work of it.”
Sherlock’s voice broke into his thoughts
Greg froze. He’d known for a while that he was falling for Molly - that the amount of times and the ways in which she crossed his mind had reached beyond the normal boundaries of friendship. But knowing something and hearing it said aloud were two entirely different things.
“How? It doesn’t even have feet?”
-----
The bottom one was a photo of all three of them. Rosie was in John’s arms, laughing as Sherlock pointed to something out of view. Sherlock seemed to be explaining something to her, but John’s gaze was on Sherlock, his eyes alight, a smile spreading across his face.
I vaguely recalled the sensational stories that circulated near All-Hallows Eve about graveyard mysteries and morbid curios.
When he was young the music came and went without warning - a few notes while he brushed his teeth before school, disjointed chords on the bus ride home, and sometimes a few minutes of frenzied screeching that made him fling his hands over his ears. But the music quickly improved, the squeaky chords becoming steadier as the weeks went by. It was almost always the violin, though for a few months the melodic strings were interspersed with bouts of rich but disjointed scales on a grand piano. While Harry ran about getting into mischief with the other neighbourhood children John could spend hours listening to the music on the wind.
“Really? Never?”
Halfway through his last year of medical school John noticed a change in the music. There was a stretch of melancholy, a chaotic crescendo, a flash of brilliance, then silence.
“You’re upset,” said Sherlock, looking up from his notes.
John reflects on past Christmases. Despite all the bad memories he finds something to hope for.
Holmes strode down the street, eyes darting back and forth taking in the new sights, already cross-referencing them with the London he knew.
Instead she smiled as a photo from Greg popped up. She tapped the screen to open it and saw a darkened image of the ice rink at Hyde Park.
When I returned to Baker Street at nightfall Holmes was nowhere to be found but a tray of food was laid upon the table along with a hastily scrawled note.
John takes a seat on the edge of the bed. “Sherlock, whatever happened in the past was terrible and I know you’re still trying to sort through it all but nothing like that will ever happen again. I promise.”
Chapter 5: "Decorating", In which the inhabitants of 221B spend an evening making gingerbread houses.
Sherlock tried again, trying to imitate John’s stance and focusing on the placement of his feet, but the blades on his skates didn’t seem to want to stay parallel and he stumbled over to the side once more.
“You said she sold a warehouse," Sherlock says, "What’s the address?”
“Sherlock, what -”
“No, definitely not.”
Greg turned to Rosie, “What do you think? Will Sherlock behave?”
“But where did he go?” I repeated. There had been no side tunnels, I was sure of it and yet here we were at a dead end, alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You were willing to die in my place at the pool,” Sherlock counters.
“I can.”
Despite this, John couldn’t stop himself from bursting out laughing at Sherlock’s horrified expression.
John smiled and he was near enough that Sherlock could smell the peppermint on his breath. Strange how the scent that had caused him to roll his eyes earlier was now so intoxicating. He shivered and pulled the blankets closer around him.
Sherlock reached for his mug, letting it warm his hands. It has been a bitterly cold day and he’d spent most of it wandering the streets, checking in with various members of his homeless network, trying to find a lead on the missing person case Lestrade had yet to solve.
“Must be nice to have a second chance.”
Sherlock unlocks the door, “Well, this isn’t working for me. I’m going to have a closer look.”
John’s heart sank. Of course he’d misread the signs. He’d been stupid to let himself believe that they could be anything more than what they were. He sat up and tried to swallow the lump in his throat and opened his mouth, unsure if he should apologize or make a joke about having too much to drink. But before he could say anything, Sherlock continued.
“Of course not.” Lestrade says with a smile. “Anyway I’ve got to go. Just be sure to come by the Yard tomorrow.”
Sherlock had still been awake when he returned home. Of course he was still awake, John thought, it was only 9:00.
“What, Sherlock?”
“Sherlock?” he said again
“It’s fine. I’ll go grab a fresh one.”
Instead his song morphed into something of his own composition, alternating between a call for Redbeard to come back to him and a flurry of sound meant to drown out the world. He barely noticed the wind whipping frantically around him, didn’t hear Mummy and Daddy calling for him through the trees. What he did hear was a quiet voice floating back on the wind telling him everything would be alright.
-----
“No thanks.”
Sherlock picks at a stray thread on his sleeve. “If I had just stayed in the car you wouldn’t have come looking for me.”
“How did you get here?”
“Her name’s Alice. We had several classes together at uni. Used to grab coffee at a little place off of Smithfield. That’s where I ran into her actually.”
,” Sherlock says, crossing his arms, “And I thought we’d be closer.”
John frowns, “Sherlock-”
“And one with the master bedroom facing the front of the house,” added Sherlock.
“It was our third date, Sherlock. That was kind of the point.”
“John too,” says Sherlock.
Sherlock deposits the dishes in the sink then hovers near the doorway fiddling with the sleeve of his dressing gown.
The day had started out as expected. They arrived at the station a little after 8:00 and were greeted by a man in his late 40’s named Cooper, who explained to them that half of his sheep had been swapped with those from neighboring farms over the course of the month.
John searched his memory, trying to ignore the thought of his last few Christmases at home. He thought back to ice skating with Harry and secrets shared under the Christmas tree.
“No.” Sherlock tightens his hold on John. “Just...stay. Here, you can have mine.”
Dear Santa,
He picked up a gingerbread man and nibbled off its leg.
If you're in the US, you can also text HOME to 741741 to reach the

I tensed at his remark. Perhaps I was reading too much into his words but the way he stared at me seemed to imply disdain for something beyond having a third party present.
John shakes his head. “You still saved me first. The day we met at Bart’s. If you hadn’t come into my life when you did…” he gazes at the flickering candle between them, “you saved me the moment we met, Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded as they turned down another aisle.
“I don’t want things to stay the way they are. I want more than this. More than spending my days with you, knowing that you might leave. More than spending my nights imagining things that will never happen. I want to be more than Rosie’s godfather and your best friend. And I want more than to look at you and know that you’ll never want me the same way.”
As if on cue, his phone chimes with an incoming text. John laughs and gives him a shove.
Sherlock scanned the street again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock, it’s time to let him go,” Mycroft said.
Lestrade pulls out his phone, runs a hand through his hair with a sigh and addresses his team, “Let’s take a break. Get some food. We’ll regroup here in an hour.” He disappears into his office, staring at his phone with a dejected look on his face.
“Wrong,” said Sherlock, his eyes sweeping up and down the street, “There are 18 houses on this street. For someone to break into so many in a short time period is impressive. But the ones that reported break-ins are not the most affluent houses in the area. Why then, would those be targeted above the others?”
“So, this is the famous Doctor Watson?”
“It’s...nice,” John replies warily. He’s still not sure where this experiment is going or how he’s meant to be involved. “I think I liked the orange one better though.”
16 December 22:11
Holmes held up a hand.
They lay there in silence, John hoping Sherlock couldn’t feel how quickly his heart was beating, hoping he couldn’t deduce how badly he wanted to bridge the distance between them. He’d only
“Ah, that.”
“Oh, we don’t need -” he reached for the candle to nudge it back, but John placed a hand on his wrist to stop him.
John waited until he heard Sherlock’s bedroom door close behind him before whispering his answer to the empty room.
Evans gave a small shake of his head before speaking into the phone once more. “It’ll be fine. Just bring him out.”
“Are you trying to make me feel bad for lying to her?” John asked.
of learning the names of planets when they might all turn out to be asteroids or moons or stardust instead.”
Sherlock and John help DI Hopkins investigate an unusual series of robberies.
“Are you really saying we’ve traveled -”
“I - wait, you remember what I was eating? Never mind. Do you remember what we talked about?”
“So, that’s not why you came back here?”
John nodded. More than anything else at this time of year, he missed Harry. They had been so close as children but now he was lucky if they talked twice a year.
He sighed. So far Rosie had accepted their explanation that not all families looked the same and that Mary had loved her and was watching over her always. But despite all the bad that they’d been through, John wished that they’d had at least one Christmas together after Rosie had been born, just so he’d have a memory to share with their daughter when she got older.
“It’s fine,” she said, “Is he out on a case?”
“Good deduction,” John mumbled as he leaned back and closed his eyes. How had this happened? He was supposed to be halfway across London engaged in delectable foreplay instead of here discussing the intricacies of dating with a bored consulting detective.
“No.” John says, “I know I did before and I’m sorry. I was hurt and confused and so, so stupid. But from now on I swear I will always be there because-”
“The writing’s rather appalling but this one is the most comprehensive and I’ve cross-checked the meanings with other websites and they seem to be more or less in agreement.”
“Fine, you can come,” Lestrade says.
“Oh boys,” she said, “You should really start sending Christmas cards.”
Dimmock ignored this and asked, “You’re here alone?”
“Sherlock. Great, we could use your help.”
Lestrade steps in before Sherlock can open his mouth, “Just let him ride with you. He won’t cause any trouble. Right, Sherlock?” He shoots a look at Sherlock who nods quietly. The paramedic shrugs and turns back to John.
“What case?” asks John once the front door closes.
As they stumble backward onto the bed John knows that everything, the crazy “experiment”, the waiting, all the anticipation, was worth it.
It’s one of those strange in-between hours after the clubbers have gone home, but before the early commuters have risen so it takes a while for Sherlock to find them a cab. John struggles to remain vertical and sighs with relief when a black cab comes trundling toward them.
It was still night but the sky was ablaze with thousands of coloured lights. Beyond the boundaries of the cemetery impossibly tall buildings rose, cutting a path across the night sky and piercing it with specks of light.
“Did you find a body?”
“Even after all this time, every day with you seems like some kind of dream. And I’m sorry that I may have screwed it up a hundred times over. But...dinner the other night. And the case last week. When I saw the gun aimed at you...I couldn’t think. I don't know what I would have done if he’d already pulled the trigger because I can’t imagine a life without you.”
“Want what?” Sherlock asked.
Before he can click to another page Sherlock appears at his elbow and John slams his laptop closed.
Sherlock’s phone rang again but he continued to ignore it. If it was John he’d know to text.
“Oh. That’s -” Sherlock glances at the flower then trails off.
“He’s fine,” Lestrade said, “but you need to come get him.”

Sherlock falls silent again, picks up one of the menu inserts, and begins folding it as John tries to process the meaning behind his words.
“How’s the diet?”
to, but he has no idea how to proceed from here.
need to go then?”
“I take it back. You’re an arse.”
Sherlock waved his hand. “How hard can it be? You know I used to dance.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “It could have been so much worse. If - if something had happened to you, I -” his voice trails off and he looks away, refusing to meet John’s eyes.
The nurse catches sight of the rose and winks at John as she slips out of the room.
. Come say hi!
He was about to slide his phone back into his coat pocket when it rang. Alice nodded for him to take it while she flagged down the waiter to ask for a dessert menu.
“We’re not
-----
“Judge Randolf’s wife left him and he was hoping to hook up with one of the jurors, apparently,” John said.
“Cynthia,” was all he had time to say before a slim blonde woman in a short, red dress greeted John with a hug and started chattering away about how adorable Rosie looked in her costume and how her own daughter was so excited to be onstage and oh, there’s a couple of seats over there and John should come sit with her.
7 February 14:14
He nodded and felt the blinding pain tear through the haze. The music acknowledged his will to live and also his agony. Silky melodies wrapped themselves around him and John felt the pain recede into darkness.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“Listening to the wind, Sir.”
“Thought you might like breakfast,” Sherlock says, nodding at the box and revealing a pot of tea that was hidden behind the assembly of flowers.
John glared at her, then felt a rush of guilt when her smile wavered. Stella had always been friendly toward both of them - appreciative of Sherlock’s help and had never questioned John’s presence at crime scenes. She’d also never poked fun at their relationship, as most of the other officers did. If he hadn’t known she had a steady girlfriend, John might have been jealous of how well she and Sherlock worked together.
John rushes out the door and Sherlock counts his retreating footsteps. 17 stairs, two extra steps to the front door, the click as it closes, then the silence that seeps into the flat every time John leaves. Sherlock turns to the fridge and catches sight of the calendar John mentioned. Sure enough, he sees a familiar messy scrawl on 29th January that reads, “9am - clinic”. He scowls at the offending paper then tears the page off and throws it in the bin. It’s not as if John will be needing it - January’s almost over anyway.
“So, you’ll come?”
When I woke some time later, I was surprisingly warm considering the gray drizzle falling in ripples on the river’s surface. Holmes, who had likely remained awake pondering our situation, had draped his cloak over my shoulders while I slept and wandered off. A moment of panic passed through me at his absence, but my fears were allayed when I scrambled up the embankment and found him on a bench, chatting with a homeless girl who looked to be in her late 20s.
Sherlock shrugged.
Holmes froze when he reached the doorway.
-----
It was stupid, Sherlock thought, the idea that if he just got out of his village he would immediately find his person, the one the music spoke to. He had been naive to believe it would be as easy as going out into the world with just his violin in hand.
-----
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to steady his breathing.
Sherlock glared at him and John laughed.
His first thought after he turns off the lamp is that he needs to find something to do with his hands because his left keeps straying toward Sherlock’s side of the bed. His second thought is that perhaps Sherlock would appreciate a gesture of comfort tonight. His third thought is interrupted when Sherlock’s fingers gently encircle his wrist. His fourth thought isn’t so much a thought at all, but rather, a jumble of confused and bittersweet feelings as he slowly drifts off to sleep.
“For all you know, she might have some. She does have other natural medicines.”
“Have you not heard the rumors of the Courtoy Tomb?”
Sherlock takes the long route home. He doesn’t see a reason to rush. John has been acting oddly for the past two days, slipping out of the flat alone for hours at a time. Normally it was easy enough to deduce where he’d gone but John had strayed from his normal patterns. He’d even taken to wiping his internet search history. Sherlock sighs and thinks that perhaps John had managed to get a last minute Valentine’s date after all. He wraps his coat tighter around himself and takes another unnecessary detour.
