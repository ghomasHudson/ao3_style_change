Title taken from Richard Siken's The Dislocated Room
, even, to accept that this is your eternity. And you do, because what else is there?
One more voice in crying out for mercy he doesn’t have, one more tortured soul to add to a very long list.
The thing about Tessa is that she doesn't seem to know how to feel pity. She's completely without empathy where Cas is- was- is- just a really weird little guy who felt too much and very clearly didn't know what to do with it. Dean misses it. Misses it so much that when Tessa nods and holds out her hand, Dean grabs it without asking where they're going and it simultaneously thrilled and terrified to find himself standing on the main drag of something that could have easily been a set
Grief. Is that the choiceless thing welling up in his chest? He remembers Cas promising him months ago that love will destroy him, but not with Cas' hands and he probably should've known then that it would be his own. "Dean. My name is Dean."
Sam drops the knife completely and it clatters to the floor, loud in the silence as he fails to answer. He just stands there looking like
So Castiel frees it.
And he
Sammy’s put himself in the Hell in a Cell match to end all matches and Dean’s going to have to throw away the key. He’s going to have to be alone.
Still, Dean tries.
Tessa still looks the same as when she reaped him as a kid. She smiles despite her annoyance at being summoned, clearly fond of him still. "What do you want, Dean?"
violent, yes, but he knows it’s not, Castiel
Cas shrugs- it hadn’t occurred to him that it was anything else and if it was, it certainly doesn’t matter. “Romantic love? No, this is religion.”
"You are not wrong," Cas says. "I took great care with you- even your freckles are in the same place. Everything is as it should be."
. Desolate like the inside of a grave. It makes something in Cas ache and he reaches out a helpless hand, helpless words. “Eve is the mother of humanity, too.”
"Reapers can't go there. The souls of monsters just kind of find their own way, like homing pigeons." She pauses and adds hesitantly as if remorse is foreign, "I'm sorry, Dean."
Castiel tilts his head like a confused puppy, squinting as though the dark makes a difference to how well he can see Dean. "Good things do happen, Dean."
“Yeah, well, maybe you just didn’t know me was well as you thought.”
Cas’ face grows thunderous and Dean almost hopes he’ll get hit again, but the angel subsides, and paces back to the mouth of the alley and the unconscious prophet. His back is turned but Dean is drowning in the sensation of being watched, surrounded, and the smell of ozone burns his nose.
“Me,” he says, also closing the distance between them, “and you.”
“And what part is that?”
"Meet me here at dawn, Dean. I've got things to clean up here before I meet my maker. Awful things of my own to do. I suggest you get some rest- you'll wanna stay awake where we're going."
He strips and gets into the shower in a haze. The water is just a little too hot; his scars ache with every movement. Castiel's grace and care had been holding his old bones together for the last decade and all that clawing himself out of graves seems to be catching up with him now. He counts his scars in the mirror afterwards.
my son, you will never know hunger again."
and Lucifer curls in on himself, no longer standing tall and smug. The air begins to smell like myrrh and morning dew while Sam's face twists up in anger.
Dean wants that, that absolute serenity. He wants to be at peace with his decisions, but he hasn't truly been at peace since… since his mom put him to bed the night their house burned down and even then he was fussy, anxiously reaching out for his brother. It was Dean's job to protect him, right? Never let him go, never let him feel alone, never let him let other people make him feel small and, damn, he couldn't even do
“It’s
he was gone.
He hadn’t understood then why they’d chosen to die. Now he knows that Leviathan are almost the antithesis or purpose and to declare one would be tantamount to breaking the commandments of her realm. It was the perfect catch-22 and if Eve had so easily done that to them, what could she have done to Dean, an unknown human?
Because he still has those ring of scars on his shoulder. The inside of his right arm is still a little gnarled from badly done stitches made by a shaky thirteen-year-old Sam. There's still a scar above his eyebrow from a fight he and Dad had right after Sam left for college. The freckles across his nose and clavicle still appear every single summer in the precise places they always have.
Elias makes toward the saloon at the end of the main road, his steps slow and halting. Dean reaches out to grab his arm as he passes. "You're not gonna ask who I am? How I know?"
he only thought that. He adds, "Bitch."
grace and whatever happens next is his fault. It
Sam keeps his eyes lowered as his talks, but his hands move slower now, more methodically. There’s no enthusiasm for whatever he wanted to tell Deanna, but there’s no grief, either. She wonders what happened. “If I had been there-”
Castiel assumes Dean means God. He assumes Dean means to demean Castiel's- whatever it is that he feels for Dean. Affection, loyalty, duty, whatever this hot, roiling feeling in this vessel's stomach is called. He replies, "I am not a female dog, Dean," Castiel says. "I have no such eagerness to follow orders, though I would follow yours, if you gave them."
are the Righteous Man. When I went to Hell in search of God's most perfect weapon, I was guided to you. If Heaven can recognize the truth, why can't you?"
, she'd said and Dean thinks,
“You’ve met
Cas squints and tilts his head in that vaguely unsettling, reptilian way of his. “You did. Every word out of your mouth is somehow about love. Every word, every taunt, every prayer.”
It doesn’t feel even remotely convincing when Dean tells himself that first thing in the morning, right before bed, in his sleep, in every waking minute.
He has to keep going for Sam.
He considers praying to Jack. If anyone would know what’s going on with a certain blue eyed celestial being made of avoidance, it’s the new God himself. But that’s a terrible idea. Jack wants to be hands off and Dean will respect that. Fuck knows he’s done enough to fuck up the kid’s life.
“I don’t know… I’ve heard that children need discipline, but Mary is almost seventeen. Is that considered a child?” Castiel’s cerulean blue eyes sparkled.
“You were rambling.” It’s the only explanation Cas gives before he’s on Dean again. He looks so smug now. There's no trace of the crushed angel from before.
Dean should feel great. Castiel’s death wasn’t in vain. He sacrificed himself so that Dean could save the world one last time.
Still Dean can't help loving his mom. Or his bastard father. But he will love John from a distance for now.
“What the hell are you wearing?” Dean gave her an incredulous look, towel now firmly around his waist.
“Cas, am I doing the right thing with her?” Dean looked up at Castiel hopefully.
“I love you.”
They were in art class.
This morning Dean didn’t even have time to focus on Cas’ untimely depart from Dean’s side. He was too busy tracking down the goddamned son of Lucifer himself.
Dean suddenly feels all the time apart from Cas like it’s a physical wall between them. He’s going to take a fucking sledgehammer to that wall.
“Mary Winchester, you listen to me and you listen good.” Mary stopped in her tracks, face reddening. “I am your father and you will respect me. If I say you need to wear a more appropriate outfit, you will. Understood?”
Dean takes a shallow, ragged breath and then rolls over. He won’t go back to sleep tonight, but he can pretend.
“You came.” It’s not a question. Dean can’t deny the reality of the man standing in front of him. Well, he could, but he won't.
But now that he stands here, watching Castiel’s body burn, feeling the overwhelming heat of the fire on his skin, he thinks about it. It threatens to take over every part of him. This anger. This grief. The thought of life without Cas. It’s like life without oxygen, life without Sam. It’s unthinkable. Unbearable.
It’s been months. It’s been minutes. Sam is here. He has a little house on the lake with Eileen. Dean is happy to see them together. It hurts so fucking much to see them together.
“Have you visited your father?” Mary asks tentatively one afternoon. She knows it’s dangerous territory to mention John. And she doesn’t know who is more volatile: John after a few beers or Dean in eternal paradise. “He keeps asking about you.”
“It’s good to have you back, Cas.”
He’s so tired of it all.
The sun eventually rises, filling the room with a golden hue that could only be created by the kindest of nephilim. But neither Dean nor Cas really notice. They’re far too busy making up for lost time.
“Yes, angel?” Dean looked at her. Her hair was now dry. It was white-blonde and extremely curly. It reminded Dean of his mother, who Mary was named after. She even had the same green eyes.
Dean refuses to pray. Cas came back to life without so much as spitting in Dean’s direction. Cas holds the cards here. Dean will just be sitting on his fucking thumbs and waiting for Cas to either play his hand or fold.
“I think Mary took it to the pool.” Castiel said, walking into the bathroom with another towel. “Here, use this one.”
When it’s clear to Dean that Cas isn’t going to loosen up, he pulls away. But only enough to look Cas in the eyes. Fuck, they’re so close. Breathing each other’s air. Inches apart. Dean could just lean forward and-
“It wasn’t that bad, Cas…” Jo reasoned.
“Dad, it’s just a swimsuit. I don’t see what the problem is.” Mary rolled her eyes, pulling out her bag to find some clothes.
Dean doesn’t bother with a response. Mary knows the answer. The only acknowledgment that Dean heard at all is the bitter chuckle he lets out before the tinny scrape of his chair signals that he is about to make his exit from Mary’s lovely little house she lives in with her not so perfect husband. How she stands to be around John, ignores all the abuse he dealt his sons, Dean will never know.
He asks himself these questions when he wakes up, when he goes to bed, when he sees dark hair or blue eyes or hears a rough masculine voice.
Dean was sitting at the table with what looked like the social outcasts of the class. To his left was a skinny guy with a mullet, beside mullet-man was a blonde girl who wore way too much flannel ,in Dean’s opinion, beside her, was a red-head with a star wars t-shirt, and to Dean’s right was an awkward-looking guy with stunning blue eyes, mussed up hair, and a trench coat.
“Yes…” Mary looked at her feet.
Cas is dead.
Why is this fucking kid here? Why couldn’t Cas be around to keep him in check? How the fuck are we supposed to do any of this? Dean asks himself over and over.
“It’s always worked before.” Sam reasons. He’s right. But Dean can’t.
Cas is dead.
Cas inhales sharply. He’s stiff as a board. Feels like he’s gearing up for a fight.
Mary went into the bathroom without a word and slammed the door. Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and sat down on the bed.
“I had to scrub toilets for three months! Jo, you’ve never seen how disgusting the boys’ bathroom is!” So, blue-eyes had a name: Cas.
“Dean, please.” Cas begs, still very much the teary eyed man he was when last Dean saw him. But he looks far more wrecked. Like Dean has all the power to tear him to shreds with a handful of words.
“Uh… I’m Dean… By the way,” Dean decided to speak up.
The first time they met, Dean thought nothing of the other boy, except that he was odd. Dean was the new kid, who didn’t know anyone and Castiel’s group of friends welcomed him.
“Cas,” the name is forced past his lips before he can even wake enough for reasonable thought. “Castiel. Please.” He chokes out. “Please.”
Across the dark room stands an angel. He’s as beautiful as he’s ever been. Ethereal. A descriptor that seems on the nose, but is absolutely true. Cas is ethereal. He is lit only by the moonlight that filters in through the blinds of Dean’s window. Little slats of light reveal that ugly ass trench coat. He looks like a mirage. He could definitely quench Dean’s thirst in this desert he’s been stumbling through since Cas died.
And he’s so angry. It’s consuming him. Swallowing him up. Only it isn’t choking on him like he’s choking on the fact that Cas is gone.
He’s in love with Cas. Has been for fuck knows how long.
Only he feels like a giant piece of his soul just got ripped away.
“I know, Dean.” Cas says in a rasping whisper, tears in his eyes. God, Dean missed the low rumble of his voice. Missed the way Cas’s eyebrows furrow when he’s concerned or confused by some human phrase or custom. Missed this electric feeling that runs through his body every time his eyes meet with Cas's.
And that’s the thought that pulls him out of his miserable, borderline catatonic state.
But I love him.
Dean’s eyes prick with near scalding tears. He remembers the last time Cas said those words to him. An eternity ago. Back when they both meant so much to each other, but neither of them really knew it yet. It was too raw to speak aloud. Now they both know. Dean thinks they both know. He hopes they do.
“The problem is that there are guys out there and I know exactly what they’re thinking when they see you almost naked.” Dean put on his stern parent face.
Then another moment.
This is good.
Because Christ knows even when Dean had nothing to keep him going, he had that fucking kid. That overgrown baby brother of his. Even when he’s been dead terrified of every end of the world they’ve faced, he’s had Sam.
Dean doesn’t allow himself to think about it too much. But he can’t help when a single thought floats up unbidden and unwanted. He loves Cas.
As if on cue, Mary walked through the door, towel wrapped around her shoulders and hair soaking wet. She was also wearing a strapless bikini, which Dean didn’t approve of.
“You have to know,” Dean starts. Suddenly it’s urgent that Cas knows how Dean feels. Those three words Dean has been keeping locked away in a most precious lock box. Somehow Dean is now standing. His hands are shaking and his legs are freezing from the cool air of the room and he’s breathing hard. Shit. This is the most important moment of his life… afterlife. But life too.
But Dean is thrilled Cas is back. It’s like a thousand pound weight is lifted right off his chest. His ribs are still broken and his organs damaged from the weight having been there in the first place, but at least he can take a ragged painful breath.
“Well, Dean, considering we both had absent fathers, I’d say you’re doing fairly well.” Castiel sat down next to Dean and grabbed his hand.
“Stop it,” he rattled out in a breath at his nephil. “That hurts, you’re not being helpf—ahh!”
While Dean rolled his eyes, continuing his quest for something in the brown box, Castiel felt like there had been a minor explosion in his chest. ‘Date’. Kevin said they were going on a date.
She wore one of the shortest, most revealing dresses Dean had ever seen in his life but for some reason, she looked classy, the fitted dress sparkling under the flashing lights. She looked like a diamond personified.
Those blue eyes couldn’t belong to anyone else.
The comment probably wouldn’t be welcome; honestly, it  seemed out of place when the environment around them was upbeat and joyous, when Miley Cyrus shrieked something about peace and love just on the other side of some t-shirt merchants. But to his surprise, Dean’s teeth flashed as he smiled.
“Move!” Balthazar barked, pushing his way through stagehands and angels. They parted for him, revealing Castiel sitting on an apple box backstage, her face slack and hands twitching in her lap. Hannah sat at her side, an arm around her, and Meg kneeling in front of her. Michael and Gadreel stood on either side of their star angel like two bodyguards, frowning with concern, eyes sweeping her face.
While it made his hands shake, Dean yanked off his seat belt and opened the door once Cas stepped back to allow him to. As he climbed out, to his chagrin Cas and Sam looked amused. Too amused.
But Hannah waved him off, shaking her head, a loose curl bouncing around the nape of her neck.
“A year?”
“Car seat? Did...you two plan this? Am I being punked?” Dean asked, looking between Cas and Sam, who’d stood up and was walking around the car, disappearing to open the trunk.
“If she offers to lick your other fork in private,” Pam said, “give us a thumbs up or something so we know that we can stab her.”
“Dream big, filthy cow,” the woman sneered, glaring at Winchester right in the eye as she wrenched his hands up over his head and locked his wrists in restraints hanging from the ceiling.
“Say it,” Naomi ordered, the tip of her blade once again returned to Castiel’s skin. It pressed in threateningly, blood pooling around the tip. “Tell me your purpose.”
His heart was pounding in his chest. He knew she was trying to send him a message, to dissuade him from feeling for her, but he couldn’t help but recall the way she met his eyes when they were making love, or her genuine smile that appeared over her lips when they sat on his balcony, legs intertwined, sharing stories and passing a cigarette between them.
Against his mouth, Cas stilled and for a brief second of suspended time, Dean thought he’d been too bold, moved too fast. They’ve only been in love for nearly twelve years, but they’d only known for twelve hours. Cas’d hardly been back from the Empty for two hours, maybe he needed a second to breathe—
Dean pushed off the wall and stood in front of Gadreel, shoulder-to-shoulder with Castiel. “Listen,” he said, lacking the anger that everyone else harboured. Desperately, Dean asked, “You have to tell me; is Cas alive? The visions…”
“Nah,” Dean shrugged, raising the last few bites of his sandwich to his lips. “We’ll do it without her. She didn’t seem like she was interested in helping and if she wants out of the life, we gotta respect that.”
“You know what other number I might like?” Dean asked, raising his brows. “Your phone num—”
Full of mountain dew, tacos, and beef jerky, she shook her head. “Not really,” she admitted, but at the concerned look on Jimmy's face, she added, “But I could go for a coffee.”
So Dean chattered to her a bit louder, even though she was sleeping, not caring who heard. He told her about the Impala, and about the Zchitri, and about the angels. He stroked her back and wiggled his finger into her palm, teeth gnawing on his lip happily when her tiny fingers curled around it in her sleep.
“Show me,” Castiel said, his raspy voice sounding more gravelly than usual. With hands that felt like they were buzzing, he reached up and began to loosen his tie, but Dean’s hand snapped out and he grabbed Castiel’s wrist.
“Mr. Winchester will be here soon,” Uriel said, kneeling down at Castiel’s feet. He dragged his finger through her blood and held it up to his face, rubbing it between the pads of his fingers. He glanced up at her and over at Anna. “This will all be over soon, sisters.”
“I want to go home,” she breathed, eyes stinging. “Take me to your bed. Make me your mother’s soup, I just want to go.”
As hot and mind-blowing as the sex had been last night, the next morning Castiel found himself hissing in discomfort as he climbed down the ladder from his bunk. Dean was already up, sitting at the desk under his bunk, feet up on the table top, flipping through a book.
She was going in.
“Weird, right?” Dean asked, unsure.
That was
“Your third eye is busted, buddy!”
'Time to Dance' by the Shoes. Listen to it here: https://youtu.be/pt9wnawn7xQ?t=107
Her nails were digging into his skin. Dean jerked his face away and swung, bringing the iron bar through her stomach. Mary snarled and blinked away, leaving nothing but cold air in her wake.
Castiel sighed heavily, looking exhausted suddenly. She shook her head and tilted her chin down, her gaze on the water as it grew darker in the absence of the sun in the sky.
But Bobby, he was firm in his stance. When Dean screamed, all he did was blink and press his lips together, continuing with whatever task he was doing.
A small, soft smile spread across Cas’ lips. Charlie thought maybe it looked pitying or perhaps sad?
“Nononono,” he sobbed, shaking his head, droplets of water running down from his hair, dripping down onto his shirt, disappearing in the dark material. “Where are you gonna take me? P-Please don’t punish me, I didn’t d-do anything—”
“Of—Of course,” Jimmy replied, nodding quickly. He stepped closer to Jamie, tugging at her sleeve. “Come on, Jamie. You, uh, hungry?”
Hannah shoved him in and Castiel managed not to tip forward as the cell door closed behind him.
Three minutes later, all of the gooey, fresh-looking pods were cut open and in each of them were the children that’d gone missing. They ranged in age from a few months old to six, but the worst part was that they weren’t even dead. They had just mutated into monsters themselves. Dean and Sam found them at various stages of transformation; some were fully covered in scales and growling from the inside of their cocoons, only recognizable from the clothing they wore, while others were half-mutated versions of themselves, with extra fingers and fangs, or only one eye a bright red.
“Then we won’t,” Sam said, taking a moment to ruffle Dean’s hair before he began walking towards the door. “Maybe one day you can ask Cas to fill in the blanks. She...seems to like you.”
Castiel swallowed, her eyes a bit wide. Then, after a pause, she looked down at herself. “What do I wear?”
“Stop!” Castiel interrupted, pressing her hand against the wall to steady herself. She looked up at him, a curl falling into her face, her mouth trembling. “I don’t need your help.”
Sam had to push him forward to get him to move with the crowd of men and women pouring into the venue. Dean had been too busy staring up at the art, enthralled in the details and dimensions. He felt like he was witnessing a crusade into Hell. He felt, for a moment, like he was in a church, staring in awe around at the luxury of the room.
“That’s all for us!” Sam interrupted, clapping his hand down onto the table as a warning to Dean. “Thank you so much, Patty.”
Staring at the bottle held loosely in his fingers between his knees, Castiel shook his head. “No. I had several foster-siblings during my time in the system, but none that I ultimately kept in contact with. My adoptive mother spoke about adopting another child after me, but one year into our relationship, she decided against it. ‘Too much trouble for little reward’ were her words.”
“Consequences? Like what?” Dean spoke up, his tone sarcastic. His voice sounded loud in the silence, voice carrying across the large space. He tilted his head a bit, eyes narrowed to slits, his lip curled with displeasure. “Like no phone calls to our friends and families?”
“Thanks,” he said as he sat down adjacent to her, his knee grazing hers.
Dean and Cas turned to Hannah, who looked like a deer in headlights.
Before they could recover, Zachariah spat, “Prepare Castiel. I’ll imprison Anna. I wish to deal with her myself later. For now, we get back on track, ensure the demons have prepared the altar to standard. Lilith arrives soon and we need to be ready.”
“Can we just be two adults here and get what we want?” Dean asked. “You know...like…”
Castiel’s hands stilled on Dean’s waist and they gazed into each other’s eyes, their kiss broken by only an inch, held together by thin wisps of their breath.
“Hope you like cheap beer and makeshift cocktails, ladies,” Ash chuckled, one arm lazily thrown around Charlie, while the other slung over Hannah’s shoulder. “‘Cause booze is costly and these saloon owners will try to water your drinks down as much as they can. Do yourself a favor if you wanna get nicely buzzed; order it straight and order it from Bobby.”
Dean crossed the room and slowly reached out, letting Hannah drop the little satchel into his palm. It was heavy and made small chiming, rattling noises, like rocks sliding over each other. He was nervous for some reason as he opened the velvet, dark blue bag and peered inside.
“You can’t be seen,” Charlie whispered, looking over the rack of costumes she and Dean hid behind. She ducked back down and stared at him through frightened wide eyes. “Raphael is pacing around backstage, ready to kick you out if he sees you.”
He looked over his shoulder and saw Dean standing behind him, one hand on his ass still, massaging circles into it as his eyes stared at his hole, looking impossibly turned-on and lustful. The other hand carded through his hair, messing it up.
And with that, Dean stepped away from the counter, pulling his t-shirt up  by the collar and swiping his face with it, unconcerned for the smudges of dampness splotching his collar.
Chuck looked between them all, his throat working as he swallowed hard several times. Then, blinking tears from his eyes, he said through chattering teeth, “I saw what happens tonight. I saw s-sn-snippets of it. I saw Dean with black eyes, dr-drinking demon blood, like a lot of it! A lot, a lot. And Cas, I saw her bleeding out, hung somewhere. She’s been captured or kidnapped or something. With Anna—”
Dean muttered under his breath, but Cas got the opportunity to ignore him as Sam reached out to her and pulled her into his arms, giving her a bear hug, several babies be damned.
Upstairs, once Sam had carefully pushed open Dean’s door, moving slowly to alert Dean that he was no longer alone, he found that the damage to the room was actually almost nothing compared to Bobby’s living room and kitchen, though there was a shattered water glass on the floor and bloody footprints across the hard wood.
Sam looked startled, blinking. “What? Really? I thought we were gonna have a drink? Hannah is—”
Blue eyes, that he hadn't noticed were so blue until he was a few feet away, flashed and her jaw clenched. With a careful tone that hinted at limited patience, she warned, "I expect you to tread lightly when you speak to me, boy." And after a beat where she and Dean held a stare, both fighting for dominance of the moment, she turned back to Sam. "You have a very special role, Samuel. The gifts you’ve had throughout your life will come to aid you as your purpose becomes clearer.”
Dean groaned. “Of course it was, Hermione.”
Dean stumbled across the room and unplugged both the gas stove and the fridge. Four strides into the kitchen and it occurred to him that maybe someone had spilled something on the floor… Sam had showered. He could have tracked wet footprints across the smooth linoleum. Dean was only slip and fall away from cracking his skull open.
“I’m glad you like it,” Dean whispered, no longer able to back up or lean away, not when she had essentially expressed interest in the play idea. It’s all he’d promised Charlie. Castiel seemed to be in with the story, and frankly, she seemed to have returned to the idea of having sex and Dean wasn’t about to deny the girl what she wanted if she was going to convince Balthazar and the investor to go through with his story.
“I am
Dean nodded. “Good luck, Cas.”
Damn it, the girl was a challenge. Maybe Dean wanted to prove himself. Maybe he wanted to—
. Yeah, got it. You’ve reminded me like six times since we left the stake out.”
While Gadreel, Meg, and Rachel acted out the final scene between Shaun, Ruby, and Lilith, Dean and Castiel waited breathlessly in the wings.
The whimpers melted into soft baby hums, and Leia’s little mouth went all mushy and scrunchy, her eyes wide as she stared at him like he had two heads. Morose situation momentarily forgotten, Dean looked up at Cas with a grin, impressed with himself for calming her down quickly. Granted, he knew she was probably too perplexed to cry rather than impressed with his comedic prowess.
“Hey,” Sam greeted, sliding off the bed, grabbing his laptop. He waggled it at them as Cas shut the door behind them. “I found some stuff about sirens.”
Dean opened his mouth to reply, but to everyone’s surprise, Castiel spoke first, smirking. “We make no promises.”
“Yes. My other caseworker abruptly moved…” Cas groaned. “Now I’m considering the possibility that she’s dead.”
With a raised brow, she mimicked one of Celeste’s lines, saying dangerously, “I pulled you out of hell, I can throw you back in.”
It had been ha-ha funny that Dean and Cas were cooped up in Dean’s room reading fake-stories about their fake-selves having fake-sex and being in-fake-love, but now it was weird. It was completely silent in there and that was quite ha-ha-peculiar.
When did they even get so close? Cas was there, less than an arm’s reach, looking unsure, his cheeks coloured in a patchy red, his eyes shining.
“SAM!” Dean bellowed, pushing off his heels, his feet thumping against the hard marble. Behind him, the sound of Cas’s heavy footsteps bounced off the walls, too.
“Oh, really?” Sam laughed, pushing open his door. “‘Couldn’t be because if you think he’s car sick, the front seat is better?”
“Heaven has a purpose for me?” he asked quietly, and damn it, he sounded small. “Why?”
“They’re stunning creatures with so many stories untold!” Metatron snapped. He jutted the rolled up script at Dean. “Don’t tell me you like this twit’s gardener idea! It’s ridiculous. It’s boring.”
“Thank you,” Cas whispered, blinking quickly. “Thank you.”
Maybe the Fleshlight jab had gone too far, because Uriel stared at him, his wide eyes slowly narrowing and his scowl dropping open into a gape. “Wait… Do you not know?”
—” Dean's hand squeezed harder around Sam’s throat, but Sam still wheezed, “M’gonna kill you, y-you ugly, a-ancient cu—”
Winchester was sitting on the bottom step of the ladder up to his bunk, his own arms around his stomach. He shrugged.
Gadreel stepped away from the wall he’d been backed into and he begged, “Show me how to fall, how to remove me grace. I-I can be of assistance. I wanted to stay in Heaven, to protect it, but my loyalty, I realised, is not to Heaven, it is to the angels who serve as God intended—”
Sam and Dean exchanged looks, then said together, “It’s not what
“How do you know you can trust me, then?”
“Cas?” Dean yelled out into the steamy shower room, a hand over his eyes. “You naked?”
She looked around but saw nothing. Her gulp was audible in the quiet. She nodded.
“What would I even say to get her to come with us or...or…”
Feeling faint, her skull snapping apart down the middle, Castiel leaned forward, causing everyone to suck in sharp breaths and jerk forward to catch her, but she leaned into Dean’s arms and threaded hers around his waist. He smelled like cigarettes and firewood, like warmth and comfort.
Daphne slid her hands up, covering her eyes. Her shoulders shook. “Cas, you remember how we, um, we were trying for a baby last year, b-before my dad got sick?”
She was definitely going crazy, because when Castiel walked over and their giant form took up her entire field of vision, she wasn’t scared. They rested their huge hand on the side of her face and smiled.
Dean jerked them onto a highway, looking back in his rearview mirror. Between his teeth, he said, “If you can’t handle the heat, get out of the car.”
“You just let her fly off without us?!” Bobby yelled as he and Pamela zoomed past the motel rooms, tugging on their clothes over damp skin.
Seeing figures scramble inside Bobby's home, Dean took the keys from her and nodded. “I’m on it.”
“Stop!” Dean’s voice cried out. “He’s not part of this. Naomi, please—”
This was it.
Dean shook his head, flapping his hand out to the side and staring down at his chest where beer dripped and curled down towards the sheets. "Holy shit. I can’t believe the words ‘toss my salad’ just came out of your mouth."
He pulled away and she opened her eyes, flashing a challenging look. “Hannah wouldn’t come to that. Despite what you may think about angels, we don’t often ‘party’. We’re busy, we have clients to—”
“For a bit, perhaps,” Cas replied in a murmur, nodding again.
Dean grinned. “You haven’t left yet, though.”
“Nah, nah, nah,” Lee interrupted, pulling away but holding onto Dean at an arm’s length, staring at him fondly. “None of that, man. None of that. It’s so good to see you. I…” His smile faded a bit, his tanned, round cheeks drooping. “I’m sorry ‘bout your old man. Always liked that crusty sonuvabitch.”
Castiel raised his hot hands to his face and just breathed.
The cupid shook his head sadly. “No, brother. I cannot. Your love was prophesied by God. It can’t be undone.”
He broke down. Jamie listened to him crying and couldn’t control the flow of her own tears as they streamed down her face and dripped onto her knees. She leaned an elbow on her knee and pressed her palm into her forehead as she cried, too.
because he’d only known this girl for not even three hours and she definitely wasn’t interested.
There was a rustling noise. Dean was reaching into the trench coat she wore, and for only a moment did she ponder what he was doing, before she realised she still had the blood packets in her pocket from when they’d rehearsed the original ending.
“I wouldn’t,” Dean interrupted, throwing her a meaningful sidelong glance.
“Sam,” amended Uriel, his lips twitching a bit. “The rising of Samhain is indeed a seal we didn’t wish broken, and rest assured Sam, if the Host wished that it remained unbroken, we could have easily stopped this. We had notice, we knew who the witch was—”
Seemingly completing the warding, Sam slid back and settled in the front seat. He and Dean exchanged looks, and Sam asked, “You saw Dean with her?”
While Dean struggled not to look as sick as he felt, Castiel went on, shoving a rogue lock of hair behind her ear. “God didn’t lift a finger, but those people did. In your absence, I had the staff teach me how to be a good human.” Her eyes shone, clearly pulled back in a memory that didn’t involve Dean. “Those good, pure people helped me learn how to be a good mother and how to take care of myself. They helped me develop skills--marketable skills.”
On Thursday, half a day after turning off his phone, Uriel pulled a fast one on him.
Dean stalled by licking his lips. Then he stalled further by drinking from his beer. Once it was washing down his throat and churning in his stomach, Dean wiped his mouth on his sleeve and coughed. “I don’t remember much. Like I said, I remember some stuff. I remembered them feeding me demon blood, and it’s kinda hard to forget the pain and the feeling of choking on hot fumes and steam. I remember the smell and the sounds, but memories are hard to patch together.”
Licking his lips and struggling for words, Dean ducked his head and fished his phone from his jeans, pulling it out only to find that it was dead. “No battery,” Dean replied, raising the phone and waggling it. Wincing, he croaked, “You, uh, called?”
So he turned to the cabinet that Dean has pointed to with the same sense of confidence he'd felt a few nights ago, fuelled by the understanding that he could take the lead, that he could be looked upon to make decisions—
“I know,” he whispered, his chin—covered in blood—trembled. “I know. I’m fucked up. I came back wrong, Sammy. I...I…. I don’t know what to do. I’m just so hungry for it. The...The demon blood. It makes me feel so good, and I don’t understand why. I—”
The smallest flash of nervousness crossed the navy gaze but it passed quickly as he saw her build a wall, brick-by-brick around her heart, and press a small fake smile onto her lips. Two gloved hands slid into his palms and she got to her feet. Behind her, Meg and Hannah closed in like two guardian angels, hands out in case she fell back.
Dean swallowed. “Oh?”
Castiel stopped in the middle of the row. Dean stopped too, turning towards Castiel, undressing him with his eyes.
we were saving
,” Castiel muttered into his beer. “I wish I could have heard them perform but she was screaming the lyrics at them.”
Castiel turned and smiled at Uriel sadly, though he felt his own face harden as his eyes dropped to Naomi’s rightfully-ashamed face.
“Yes, yes,
“That makes no sense,” Castiel said bluntly, before raising his beer to his mouth and drinking deeply like he should’ve done in the first place, instead of being rude as usual.
Leia sighed the smallest sigh Dean’d ever heard, and her eyes closed slowly.
“I think I’ll just go,” the Duke said, his voice clipped. Dean un-crouched just a bit, peering through the grating at the top of the screen.
Dean laughed harder as Castiel began to laugh and cry at the same time.
Bobby snorted. “At this rate, one of you’d better call one of your angels down. I’m sure they could point out a siren in a second, and cut this whole dumb process in half.”
Her face blank, Cas' shrugged. "I don't know."
There was a flurry of movement as Hannah tugged on Cas, pulling him up and back over the bench. On autopilot, fuelled by desperation and panic, Dean lunged across the table and grabbed Cas’ hand that was already outstretched towards him. Their fingers intertwined and grasped desperately.
He wasn’t sure what possessed him, but Castiel reached out and took Dean’s hand where it gripped into the covers for balance.
Sam’s mouth dropped open, gaping for a moment. Dean felt anger bubbling in his chest,but before he could say something he might regret, Sam spoke up. “You’ve been watching over us since we were kids and you let all the stuff happen to us?” Sam asked, his weapon swinging at his side, his voice sounding breathless.
Then Dean realised, from her silence, and from his memory of her calendar, that tomorrow was Monday.
He shook her.
Dean blinked. Well, that was fuckin’ specific. “Wha—”
Every time they reached a new level of Hell, the terrain changed, the assailants were different, more vicious. They passed cells, and mutants, caves, and prisoners in cages with bulging eyes or gaping holes in their faces where eyes used to be. But he always did as he was told because as the years passed, he could not imagine Hell without his rescuer. He ran when he was told to run, he hid when he was told to hide, and he never, ever let go of the fingers intertwined with his.
“Trying is not enough,” Castiel replied, looking between the three of them gravely. “The Rise of Samhain is one of the 66 Seals that protect the gates of Hell and the cage of Lucifer. It’s our mission to ensure the seals remain intact and Lucifer does not rise. Since you both have not killed her yet, we have no choice but to destroy this town to end—”
“You have bigger things to worry about right now than explaining some text messages that were never meant to be seen in the first place,” Castiel replied in a murmur. Instead of holding out his hands and expecting them to be taken, he leaned down and took Dean’s, wrapping his fingers around clammy palms. “But we can talk, if that’s what you want. Let’s just do it somewhere more comfortable than the bathroom floor.”
There was a light inside, warm and flickering like a lit fireplace. Cas
She was going to ask it what it wanted when it stepped towards her a bit, causing her to step back against a wall and the question on her tongue to tumble down her throat and get stuck.
Dean and Cas burst out from the basement of the Roman basilica, pushing open the heavy stained glass door. Castiel stepped out calmly, his dress shoes clicking on the stone floor. As Dean charged ahead of him, the angel paused, wiping the blood off his shoes onto the red rug in front of him.
He was a monster. How could he live? He was just a maggot, Uriel was right. He lied to his brother about what he’d done, and he betrayed a friend today. He was hiding secrets and trying to bury his crimes, to bury his lies, to—
Dean patted at his jeans, and felt the welcome lump in his right pocket. A series of thank yous to a god he didn’t believe in fell from his lips in a hushed whisper. He pulled out his keys. He pawed at the keyring in the dark, feeling a series of random keys—to his horror, he didn’t feel the Impala’s big, clunky key—and found his pocket knife, as well as a small flashlight.
She had to look away. The way his gaze scrutinized... It was ridiculous, because angels could only read mortal minds, but she felt the hairs on the back of her vessel’s neck lift as if she was worried he could read her thoughts or hear her heartbeat pick up.
Dean frowned. “How am I supposed to take that information and convince
Hope tugged on Dean’s heartstrings and he sat up taller in the bed. With a new found motivation, he carried on, “Then you can live in the bunker with Sam and I. And I’ll try to do everything I possibly can to make it up to you. I'll call you while you’re at work to just talk or whatever. I'll put food in the fridge, and get Leia a real stroller-thing so you don’t have to carry her around anymore. Cas, I will drive you to work every morning and pick you up every night.”
Sam seemed to jerk out of his content observation of Dean and Lee’s reunion, his face falling. “Adam?”
“You should go,” Balthazar growled.
“That’s a lot of drama,” Dean murmured, watching Castiel speak quickly to Balthazar who nodded sympathetically.
“Shhh,” Dean whispered against his neck. “They can’t hear us, Cas. You gotta be quiet.”
“Dibs on the Impala!” Charlie yelped, jumping into a jog towards the shining beauty of a muscle car parked out front of the memorial home.
Castiel released a small hiccup and more tears slid down her face. The rest of the world seemed blurry but Dean was uncaring, only focusing on her, standing in front of him, waiting, his thumbs brushing her cheeks.
“Quit hittin’ on my boy,” Bobby growled as he and Sam ducked down and started hacking at the restraints that held Dean down in the chair.
They fell into step with each other, their boots grinding into the fluffy sand, shoulders bumping as they navigated the soft terrain.
Hannah looked embarrassed, scratching at her cheek. She blushed a bit and shrugged, eyes flickering to Sam. “Oh, gosh. Sorry, Sam. I...just...it’s habit, I suppose. It’s what we do when we’re here, y’know? I didn’t make to make you uncomfortable.”
“Sure am,” Dean piped up, wincing. “Your Dean, in the flesh. Bleeding all over the floor too, might I add.”

But Jimmy didn’t look convinced. “You’ve been acting weird ever since…”
It was, entirely and inescapably, the most arousing thing Castiel had ever seen in his mortal life. Or his immortal one, at that.
Naomi’s cold smile curled on her lips, her eyes shadowed under the brim of her grey hat. "Why is it that you make the same mistake over and over? How many times do I have to come correct you?”
When the door closed, Dean sat up and threw his legs over the edge of the mattress, pulling away the ugly green comforter atop his bed. He crept over to the window and pushed aside the curtain.
“She woke us up eight times last night.”
Castiel picked up a brush and carefully pulled the teeth through her shining, uniform waves.
“Sam, of course,” Castiel said bluntly, reaching his hand out to shake Sam’s after Jack got a few pets from the new stranger. “I just...wasn’t expecting you. We’ll have to add another place at the table. I…”
Anna quickly tucked hair behind her ear and admitted, “I know almost everything. The angels talk about you all the time, like I said. And they talk about the demons, and they kept mentioning some prophecy, but I think they know I’m listening, but it’s all very...cryptic.”
Eventually, Dean pulled away, watching Cas’ big shining eyes that searched desperately for forgiveness or understanding.
“No!” Dean said at the same time everyone else said, “Yes!”
Eventually, he managed to put some food together and returned to Dean's room. He was disappointed to find Dean was not resting, but rather sitting up in bed, his legs now covered by the sheets, and staring across the room at the picture of his family hanging on the wall. Castiel glanced at it on the way in, and figured that the frame had likely been intact before Tuesday.
His Spanish sucked, he shouldn't have skipped so much fucking Spanish class in school because the language was beautiful, but at hey, least he'd said it, spoken his truth. At least he'd said it instead of 'Don't do this, Cas', which was the kind of stupid bullshit only Chuck could've come up with.
Sam-as-Daniel looked only half-apologetic, otherwise looking over Hannah, who was a stand-in, reading for Ruby, with distaste. “
Cas winked and nodded, reaching up to pull blowing hair from her eyes.
They both laughed, Castiel bowing his head to chuckle damply into his hand, a tear dribbling over his fingers.
At the same time, the angels and Balthazar strutted out from behind the red curtains again, fanning out on stage in a rehearsed formation. Balthazar had his arm around Castiel, bringing her up in front, twirling her under his arm until they reached the end of the catwalk, when he then jerked her close to his body, and slowly dragging her leg up around his waist, one hand curled under her knee.
Dean wished so badly to reach out and take Cas’ hand, to feel the human heartbeat in his wrist.
Dean chuckled and sighed, dropping his hands to his sides and sitting back down beside his friend. With a hand on Cas’ shoulder, he nodded.
Dean laughed so hard chia seeds came out of his nose.
“They…” She squeezed her eyes shut and then breathed shakily. “They’re coming. I-I can hear them.”
“Oh, um—” Dean said in surprise when her cool fingers wrapped around his hand and tried to tug him to his feet. “Right, well, uh—I don’t really dance, it’s not my thing—”
Hannah was jumping up and down, bopping along to the song the band was playing, clinging to the bottle in her hand and spinning. Castiel was actually laughing, watching her friend enjoy herself. Her blue eyes sparkled, even in the dim, smoky light.
Dean went to answer but Sam glared daggers at him, as if daring him to open his big mouth again to ruin someone else’s outtake on life. “Don’t know,” Sam admitted, scowling at Dean, but turning his eyes on Hannah, who stared at him sadly. “Last time we voluntarily travelled between universes, we had help from an archangel.”
He’d stumbled over every word, but instead of rolling his eyes and calling him an awkward nerd as expected, Dean leaned in and pressed his lips to Castiel’s.
The touch of Sam’s fingertips against the back of his arm made Dean feel even more humiliated. They were treating him like he was fragile.
“She’d been telling her psychologist all about the apocalypse, and the sixty-six seals, and the rise of Lucifer,” Sam said, hand on the bathroom door. “And now she’s out there on the streets with angels whispering in her ears, and demons on her ass. She needs our help.”
“Dean, you were always right. The angels have been lying to us. Chuck...had a vision and he saw you with black eyes, and… Listen, Dean, don’t listen to anything they tell you, and don’t drink the blood—the angel blood isn’t healing you, it’s grooming you to be the perfect vessel for Lucifer. It’s making it so you can wield his powers. They tricked you, they fooled Cas. The angels are…they’re dicks, Dean. Just like you always said. I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you, and I’m sorry that we locked you away. Just...don’t kill Lilith, because if you do Lucifer is going to rise. Killing Lilith won’t save the last seal because killing Lilith
He yanked his head up and the artery he’d cut squirted him in the neck, though the pressure was fading and when he dropped the demon’s body onto the floor, she rolled on her side and the blood dripped weakly over the spray paint.
“I gave birth to a daughter, Dean,” Castiel choked out, looking frightened—of what, Dean was unsure. “You and I, we…we conceived in that bathroom. I heard your prayer, I know you know. But she’s yours and she…” Castiel glanced past Dean out into the hallway, his eyes darting up at the flickering lights. “I won’t leave without her.”
Her high pitched yelp of amusement echoed in the open crossroads and she raised a hand to her mouth, the long, red nails of her hand shining. “Don’t remember? Give me a break.” She smirked at him, her eyes hooded under dark lashes. “Hell is written all over your face, Winchester.”
He waved as she opened the doors and disappeared, the fluttering fabric of her dress was the last thing to disappear before the doors shut with a heavy thud.
“Odd. I felt you pulling at me, and I heard your request for help.” Dean looked up in time to see her shrug and turn away, facing the door, her back to him. Still, she didn’t move to get up.
“But they can make more?” Hannah asked hopefully, looking between the brothers with round eyes. “They’re fertile? Able to reproduce, surely…”
Uriel | 8:38 (October 20th, 2019): SAM. I said what i said. Your boytoy’s brother (don't think i don't know youre with him, getting some good secret dick. Hope that shit is worth it, because my show is—
Oh… Dear God. Dean wanted to have sex. With him.
and I never got to a place where I felt I could tell him b-because he never told me it was okay to be gay, he never even addressed it in our house. He was always
He looked up at the sky and tried to smile, his skin still hot and clammy from the humidity in the bar and from the sheer amount of love he’d experienced in the last few hours. Hugs, kisses, people saying nice shit to him that he finally felt he deserved. His chest was simultaneously exploding with affection and acceptance, and also unbearably aching with the understanding that he was missing the key piece of his happiness.
He didn’t tell her that he’d learned this from Lisa, and Cas didn’t ask.
to this party!” She let go of her niece and took her by the shoulders, holding her back. “O-M-G, Britney, I’m such a bit fan! Can I have your autograph?”
She watched him carefully. “My body was easily aroused by him, and I don’t exactly know if he was possessed yet during our time together. He was very good to me, Dean. Very kind, very gentle.”
They stared at each other, then Dean bumped his nose to Castiel’s and teased, “Way to make this a real chick-flick moment, Cas. But yeah, to answer your initial question, I’d like to do this again.”
“Oh, right,” he said, getting to his feet. “Well, I hope you feel better.”
Castiel’s mouth hung open, unsure if he should be offended or pleased by her easy dismissal of their previous plans.
“Charlie’s Angels,” Dean offered, raising his brows and gesturing at her with a dirty rag. “Hot spy ladies? Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore? No?”
Sam sat back abruptly and nodded, clearing his throat and looking embarrassed. “Right. Of course.”
“She tried to blow you,” Dean supplied bluntly.

He was stuck.
The older he got, the worse he got at holding back emotions. Repression was hardly a coping mechanism that worked anymore. It was like he’d whittled away his resolve as he experienced one heartache after another, decaying his resilience. Only days ago had he driven out into the forest in the middle of the night, his hands shaking, his eyes burning, just to have a private moment alone, just to bawl and grieve his mother.
Summoning some courage, Dean pushed off the bench and walked the short ways down the path to the willow tree by the water. He wiped his hand over his mouth and rubbed his palms over his jeans, drying them, hoping he didn’t look like the sweaty, nervous wreck as he felt inside.
Dean, despite his man-handling and the way he’d pounded into Castiel like he was trying to teach him a lesson, came with a groan and he pulled Castiel in close, kissing his shoulder as he jerked his hips up one, two more times.
did it!”
“Jamie? Hey, what’s wrong? I’m sorry if I depressed you with that story, I—”
“Should we take it from the top, then?” Kevin proposed, dropping down onto Castiel’s bed and shrugging.
“Well, they’re—”
Sam jumped to his feet, Dean whirled on the spot, and Castiel brandished the angel blade still held tightly in his hand at the source of the voice behind them.
“I am very impressed,” she replied, and Dean nearly melted as she grinned crookedly at him again. “You are a great teacher.”
As always.
A weird, dull ache shuddered somewhere near his heart and Castiel dropped his gaze to the ground. “I am gay, Naomi. I...can’t love you like that. We can never—”
“So what the fuck do you want?” Dean grumbled.
“Oh,” Dean murmured, his stomach feeling heavy, his chest occupied suddenly by two giant rocks where his lungs should be.
“It’s what you are,” Dean said coldly, though something in him made him feel guilty. She was frowning at him, but in a way he felt wasn’t entirely voluntary. She looked like his words were tugging down her features sadly. “Just a bunch of hammers, takin’ orders without question. Do you even ever have a thought of your own?”
Castiel rolled his eyes as he swept around the front of the car, feeling entirely not ready to take another long car ride of Naomi and Uriel bickering. It would be like the trip to the music festival, though at least this time they’d have air conditioning.
Music:
He’d established the setting and had written about Daniel’s escape from his grave. He had reunited him with his brother, Shaun, and friend, Robbie. The tricky part was introducing Celeste. He’d written a few scenes but scrapped them. Celeste's aborted dialogue sat in a growing mound of balled up pieces of paper at the base of Dean’s dresser.
“Yes,” Cas said on autopilot, her eyes locked on her baby, looking so sad for some reason. “Yes, Barbara. I’ll be here tomorrow at seven after my employer relieves me. I-I have childcare arranged during the day, it shouldn’t be a problem… What? No! There’s no one here. No, I’m alone right now, there’s no one else.”
Night was fading and the sun was rising over the city, flashing into Dean’s apartment from the reflection bouncing off the apartments across the street. Still packing, Dean was worried, his head buzzing as he tossed books into a rickety suitcase. Castiel was nowhere to be found. Next door, Dean could hear Hannah speaking to Sam in a panic as he packed too. She’d gone to find Claire only to be met with a morose look from Jody and a warning that the child wasn’t to be seen until the show tomorrow. When Hannah had gone to find Cas, she hadn’t been at her rooms. She said she’d looked everywhere, but the angel was missing.
“You’re standing very close,” Castiel whispered.
The song finished, and the angels stayed posted at the end of the stage as the crowd cheered. The diamond necklace around Castiel’s neck shimmered almost excessively in the spotlight as her chest heaved. Castiel looked sultry, her eyes dark and hooded as she watched the crowd, but Dean’s stomach dropped as he realised she looked angry, her eyes glancing in his direction quickly.
“MEG!” Uriel barked from the doors, his eyes bulging. “Stop instigating!”
, he told himself while his knuckles went white around his fork and he dug four holes into his napkin with it.
“Don’t!” he boomed, though his voice wavered. ‘Leave her! Leave them. I-I’ll go see if they’re all right!”
Her brother turned around and picked up two flimsy paper plates that said “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” all across the bottom. “Yeah. Move fast. Grab what you’re gonna eat and let’s go before Lia tries to get me to do something else. I think channel 47 is playing Cops as we speak.”
“Hey,” Dean greeted airily, wiping his hands on his jeans.
Castiel did grin, trying to hide it behind his hand as he scratched his cheek, but he began, “Perhaps tomorrow—”
Dean blinked hard and repeated, "Demoted? Why the fuck so?"
Dean’s stomach felt like stone. Despite his own instinct to snap back at that, to defy it, he stared out through the windshield, and he murmured numbly, “Maybe.”
“That’s fine,” Dean chuckled. “If you stabbing me is as much penetration as you’re willing to have with me, that would be okay.”
“Did you miss the part where he blamed me for bringing the demons in that kicked his ass, and then said I’d planned it all when
Castiel shoved him off and made a noise of annoyance in her throat. “I told you not to do that!” she growled through her teeth, turning her head to glare at Dean.
like he lived there.
“If I recall correctly, you were the one on your back most often, Dean.”
Dean winked at him from across the room. “Well, more resistant than I was now. I did a bunch of shit to piss them off and I ended up locked in solitary for three days. So really, it’s been like, I dunno, 15 visits to the dairy farm? I had been counting when I first started but…y’know, you kinda feel hopeless after a while.”
Hannah’s light eyes rolled and she sighed, shifting onto her hip. “Do you need to go to the infirmary, Winchester?”
“They don’t really
The lead singer snatched up the mic again and he sang, “
As the ceiling above Dean’s bed collapsed, Dean joined Sam in his unmanly shriek of alarm, flailing forward so hard he went sprawling across the floor. The two brothers squeezed their eyes shut and shielded their faces from the clouds of dust and debris.
Jack actually laughed, his shoulders jumping a bit. “No,
“I can think of a rather direct way to warm you up. It’s...right on the tip of my tongue,” Castiel teased, secretly pleased with himself for being so clever. He ran his hand over Dean’s hard cock through his black boxer-briefs as Dean toed the pants off his ankles and kicked them aside. With easy access, Castiel tugged down the underwear and gently took Dean’s cock in his hands before he swirled his tongue around the thick head, lapping up sweet pre-come.
“All right!” Ash exclaimed, clapping again. “Ash has had his giggle-smokes and is ready to dance like it’s 1899!”
“I’m trying,” Cas said quietly as Dean ran the brush through her hair once more, trying to catch any tangles. “I’m trying to fit in. References, brushing my hair, shaving, having sex... It’s what I’m supposed to do.”
After half an hour, they others were done. Dean looked especially rough, actually moaning when he got down from the restraints. He usually never made any noise, not wanting the milkers to have the satisfaction. But Meg had been particular rough with him this time. Castiel noticed she hadn’t used as much lube as she’d used on him, nor as soft a touch or intricate movements. Castiel thought, perhaps, that their conversation earlier had re-ignited her disdain for Dean.
Cas. We’re aware, which is why you’re to be separated. If you believed your shenanigans yesterday would go unpunished, you were mistaken.”
“I’m surprised you remembered that detail.”
“No, I’m good, really,” Dean assured, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees, giving his head a shake. “Just...slow, alright?”
Castiel lowered his gaze, his jaw clenching. He stared at the Led Zeppelin graphic on Dean’s t-shirt unblinkingly and he dropped his hand from Dean’s face, letting it land softly atop Dean’s thigh. His thumb brushed the skin exposed by a rip there.
With that, Castiel felt blood leave his face and he pressed his palm to his neck, as if trying to transfer the chill from the wall to his hot skin.
When she became a puddle of limbs, when all she could do was lay there, panting, too sensitive and overwhelmed, he lifted himself off the floor and leaned over her. He kissed her, fingers gentle on her face, brushing over her shoulders, arms, up her neck and jawline. He pushed damp curls from her face and didn’t demand or take a single thing from her.
And Dean was desperate to have an excuse to see her. He needed a legitimate reason to knock on her door and see where she was living. He wanted to make sure she was okay, that she was fed, and clothed, and that she
Then a green light flashed, and the final door separating them from the waiting buses opened.
Cas would have groaned at Dean’s recklessness. He might have even called him some fancy name like “insouciant” for his impulsive, batshit crazy instinct to cause mayhem. But fuck it, what else did he have to live for? For all he knew, Sam had already tried to get them out and died trying.
“—went to sleep, like I told you not to,” Anna scolded, but Sam didn’t miss the way Anna’s arm tightened around her sister.
She trailed off as she glanced at Sam and Bobby, who both looked disturbed at the description. Dean was sure they hadn’t forgotten it since Pam told them.
Cas relaxed back onto the rug, his chest heaving, his legs spread. Dean’s knees bumped the inside of his thighs, and his shoulders raised up and down under Cas’ hands with every gasp of air.
he told himself when Dean exhaled audibly, shakily, and he was momentarily swept up in the fantasy of his cock sliding into that asshole, deep, in and out, slow, then fast, and Dean would push back and fuck himself on—
Fingertips on his knee made Dean jump a bit. Bobby’s green eyes met his and Dean was shaken to realise there wasn’t hatred there, just worry. “You don’t need that shit to be strong, Dean.”
supportive. “Uriel,
Sam kicked at Dean’s boot. “
“What the…” Sam looked confused for a long second, then he stared back at Dean and rubbed at his forehead. “Why are you staring at me like that? You look like someone just kicked your puppy.” Sam paused to laugh. “Or left a dent in the Impala. What’s up?”
“Do you fuckin’ mind?” Dean snapped back at Chuck. Sam kept his eyes lowered, watching his hands work in his lap.
“Sure, I’ll let you know,” Castiel said slowly, instead of screaming “
The phone was already ringing when he brought it up to his ear.
“I didn’t expect
“Tell me it’s okay,” Dean punched out, his desire leaching from his pores, his eyes stinging with tears of relief, of happiness. “Tell me it’s okay to touch you anywhere, and I will.”
Dean swayed on his feet and suggested conversationally, “No babysitter she was particularly fond of?”
Kevin moaned, rubbing at his sweaty forehead with his arm. “This is a terrible plan!”
The building, roiling rage inside Dean built and pulsed, crackling with energy. He could hardly see straight, his vision turning red around the edges, and it only got worse when Sam swung the heavy, long pieces of wood at his head, forcing Dean to duck. His finger curled around the trigger and he almost straightened up completely to aim his shot, but Sam growled and launched himself forward, tackling them both to the floor.
The glass was drying in Castiel’s hand, his skin wet from the water, too. But he was still, aware he had been incredibly rude and presumptuous. Yet, something made him say; “You’d never know. You’re a natural.”
“I see,” was all he said as he yanked open the back door and slid in.
“Yes,” Alfie nodded. “We can die as humans die. If it helps to understand, consider us humans with access to angel radio and all of life's secrets.”
Dean’s brow twitched like it wanted to raise, then Dean whispered throatily, “Did you want to test it?”
He watched his roommate leave through the open door and he felt admittedly frightened to follow suit. A part of him feared he’d be shot for leaving the room, but hunger won out and he slipped off the bunk and followed the man into the corridor, where dozens of other men were gathering too. He hadn’t been hungry earlier, too sick to have an appetite, but physiology was catching up to him and his stomach growled.
Castiel’s whisper was loud in the silence of the night, competing only with the sound of a dog barking a few houses down and a car that drove up a street a couple blocks over. Dean watched the curtains blow gently in the early morning breeze, and he watched the stars through the window, feeling endlessly euphoric with Cas’ head shifting on his arm, her naked hip against his.
scripted, not entirely. The line was ‘we fight’, but Dean thought he kind of meant that anyway.
“Nah.” Dean grinned. “I’m all fro-yo-and-cheetos’d out since they ran that article in the paper about it. It was cute for a second but then the heartburn was unreal. How about we drive past it onto Main and I show you my store? Kevin wants to leave early, so I’m just working his last hour. The store is always dead before close so it’ll be a good chance to show you around.”
There was silence as no one initially brought up Mary. And Dean’s trigger reaction was to turn and leave, to not say anything, to potentially blow a gasket, to remind Jack that he’d left a hole in his heart that couldn’t ever be mended, but…
After pushing himself up onto his elbows and staring down at Dean kneeling before his legs, Castiel noted that Dean’s hands were shaking, despite his experience and overall bravado until this moment. But with a look of determination, Dean grasped the cock in his hands and leaned forward, taking the tip into his mouth cautiously. If Castiel didn’t know any better, he’d think Dean’d never done
Dean smiled, sliding his gaze away to follow his knuckle as it dragged over Castiel’s bare arm, gently running over the soft skin on the inside of his forearm.
Before she could protest, he beamed at her and bounced with her too, singing at her, “-A-N-C-E-in-the-city! T-I-M-E-T-O-D—”
Dean and Sam climbed out, inhaling the crisp, cold air, and watching as Hannah and Cas went around the back, opening the trunk and slinging bags of weaponry over their shoulders.
"No, your real bed,” Dean corrected with an impatient sigh. “The one that's comfy and you look forward to seeing every day after work."
didn’t. But
Jimmy turned his head and smiled, nodding at him. “Hello, Dean.”
Immediately, Cas yanked his hands up his chest, rubbing them with a moan, while his eyes flashed with dull light, his grace obviously flaring back into life.
to become mortal, to not even be
“You’ll speak with Sam,” Castiel reassured, linking their pinkies and giving the finger a tiny squeeze. “Perhaps not now, but eventually.”
Castiel was silhouetted against the moonlight shining through the translucent white curtains just to the right of Dean’s bed. He couldn’t see her face, but she had her hands in her pockets and she was leaning back against the window sill. She appeared to glow around her head as moonlight shone through wisps of wavy, thick hair.
. Yes. Of course. Yes, yes, yes--”
But there was no stopping the angel whose children were in danger, and despite Castiel and Sam yelling at Dean to stop too, there was no stopping Dean from protecting his mate and offspring, so who was Dean to be pissed he wasn’t being listened to?
Dean ran the sponge up his stomach, his eyes never leaving the soapy, sudsy trail it left over Castiel’s tanned, freckled skin. “You spread your legs,” Dean rumbled, leaning forward over Castiel’s body, their cocks pressing firmly together, “and you beg for it when you want it harder, or faster, or if you want me to come on you. Anywhere you want.”
“Anyway,” Dean walked backwards around the corner of the bed, waving his hands a bit as he spoke, “we should get started. Should we discuss details—” She was following him around the bed, her intense eyes locked on his. Dean stumbled a bit, saying in a rush, “—or do you want me to give it to you fast and dirty?”
She raised a gloved hand to her neck, pressing the back of it just under her jaw and swallowing repeatedly. “It happened, didn’t it?”
look into his eyes and potentially see disgust or dislike. When it came to Castiel’s mother, he hadn’t ever felt many emotions other than negative ones. She’d given him a shelter and basic necessities, and hadn’t ever laid a finger on him, but she’d treated him like a burden and spent most of their time together reminding him that he hadn’t lived up to her expectations.
“You should try it for yourself,” Castiel said before he realised what he’d said, and immediately felt his face grow hotter than the sun and probably look redder than the plaid in Dean’s tie. All the blood that had flowed to his dick uninvited now swiftly exited and made right for his cheeks.
“Food is ordered,” Castiel murmured, absolutely hating himself for thinking that despite the dark under-eye bags, the redness in his waterline, and the pale look to Dean’s face, that he still looked damn fine. He knew Dean probably hadn’t changed out of that wrinkled Led Zeppelin shirt in a few days (judging by the two days of stubble and slightly dirty, messy hair), but Dean pulled the look off well.
“Okay? Of course, it’s okay. I just—Weren’t we just talking about baby steps?” Castiel asked, hesitant.
“An orgy?” Sam asked, grimacing.
Then, from the needle in his arm he felt heat rumbled through his vessel, carried by whatever drug had been in that syringe via his bloodstream. Castiel breathed in punches of air, his eyes squeezing shut. In a rasp, he growled, “What’re you doing to me?”
“Can you never refer to yourself as ‘Daddy’, please? It’s so creepy,” Sam snorted, twisting the key into the lock and wrenching open the weapons closet. Inside the cabinet was a line of clean, almost new looking shotguns and pistols. The interior of the doors were lined in a deep red velvet that sheathed various knives of different sizes, thicknesses, and lengths.
While Sam scowled, Chuck pulled a matchbook from between the cushions of his couch, the flap half-ripped off, and he lit his joint. Shaking the match to extinguish it, he tossed it aside and took a long puff before he held his breath and released the smoke.
Twisting a napkin in her lap, Hannah murmured, “Follow the stairs to the left of the west lounge, down past Jody and the children’s quarters. It’s the white door just at the end of the hall.”
Dean opened his mouth against the rough material of Sam's jacket, willing words to leave his throat but he felt like he was choking on black sludge. Again, he wished it would take him.
“We used to.”
“That doesn’t seem fair."
Dean wondered why he’d bothered at all, why he’d opened his trap and let forty years of pain pour from his mouth. He thought after purging his anger and resentment, that’ he’d feel free to fill the space with some peace, but—
Castiel found himself smiling. It seemed there were few situations where Dean couldn’t find an opportunity to make a joke.
They were assigned rooms with one other “depositor”, as they were referenced as. They were given a few pairs of scrubs and shirts, and the rooms were very much like tiny apartments. To Castiel’s surprise, the cell door that locked behind them was the only aspect of their sleeping arrangements that felt like prison. There was a separate room housing the toilet, and their tiny room did have a book shelf and small desk under their respective bunks. It
During the showers, Castiel didn’t look at Dean once, though he felt him watching. He could see the concerned face on him in his peripherals, but Castiel kept his face towards the shower head, scrubbing at his skin more than usual. He spent extra time between his legs, rinsing his cock off as much as possible. The memory of Meg’s hot mouth had his skin crawling.
Maybe it wasn’t a date and maybe Naomi was right—a seed of doubt had been planted inside his stomach, twinging a bit—but Dean’s subtle flirtation had Castiel scrunching his lips together as they settled to watch the show, trying not to smile for entire minutes at a time.
“Yeah, well…” Dean trailed off, dropping his gaze to somewhere on Castiel’s chest, eyeing his t-shirt (which was still on—Castiel made a mental note to take it off ASAP). “Dunno. We don’t
“No, no,” Dean shook his head. He flashed her a charming smile, hoping to diffuse her anxiety. “No trouble here. I just have some questions for her.” He gestured through a set of glass doors. “Apartment…?”
“What did you do for a living when you were out there?” he asked, clarifying, “Before.”
Cas tilted her head at it, but then reached up cautiously and pulled a long, shiny red candy from the bag and raised a floppy end to her mouth. Laughter bubbled up in Dean’s chest when she swiped out her tongue and licked it.
Barbara the Zchitri released an ear-splitting scream as Cas drove the blade through her heart with the rage that could only be summoned by an affronted mother--or a Millenia year old celestial warrior. They were inches away from each other’s face, Cas’ twisted in hatred. With a grunt, Cas pulled the blade down. Dean groaned with disgust as he heard the monster’s insides slosh around and then land on the ground with a splat.
He waited.
“Uh, Annette!” Dean called after her, before she pushed her way into the staff room. The woman turned around in surprise, and he smiled nervously at her, waving awkwardly as he approached her.
“....Michael
Jamie struggled to her feet, crossing the room on trembling legs. Her face was patchy and wet, her eyes swimming with tears. “Don’t you dare, Castiel!”
The Duke—as he positioned himself at her entrance, ready to hurt her, to take what he thought was rightfully his—leaned over her and near her ear, he whispered, “Where is your hunter now, angel?”
All of this? It was his fault.
Cas, apparently immune to babies crying, launched herself to her feet--still holding Leia against her chest with one arm--and swung her blade around, easily cutting through Dean’s restraints. Once up for his wrists and swept down through his waist restraints.
Naomi began raising her middle finger, her acrylic nails flashing in the sun like tiny little knives.
As if that makes a difference! Dean...are you a vampire?”
The knot of anxiety tightened and Dean kept smiling, scratching at his cheek. “It’s really fine, Dad. We just moved those old bins from the front to the back, and put up some shelves for the books and games, and then shifted the table and chairs in the middle so we could—”
“As you said, you will testify for me, and the Host will see what we’ve done down here, what we stopped, and I will likely be reinstated as your superior.”
That’s when Jimmy pulled away, holding Jamie by the shoulders, his eyes wide but brows furrowed. His face was patchy and wet, but he managed to look angry instead of…well, she’d sort of expected him to be shocked.
Until the things Sam said stopped stinging so badly, he was gonna hunt on his own for a while.
Dean thought, but was immediately pulled from his thoughts by the smallest of cries. A baby, a small mew. Then another baby. They were’t crying, they were simply letting themselves be known. Perhaps they knew their mother was nearby.
“He just seemed lonely, that’s all. A little awkward, but… Whatever, y’know?”
With a nervous hand, he reached down and ran his fingers over the whisper of hair on her head. She was warm and soft just like his nephil. When his skin touched hers, she mewed a bit and scrunched her lips together in her sleep, much like his nephil did.
Sam tucked hair behind his ear and laughed. He actually
Winchester looked furious, staring across the room at the blank wall in front of them with his jaw clenched. Castiel saw him fighting something back, saw a vein in his forehead protrude and his face turn a bit red. His worker—her name was Meg—kept looking up at him, irritated.
Dean’s hands slid down a bit on the wheel. He turned down the radio.
“—aren’t broken,” Dean finished for her, spitting. “That’s bullshit. We all know it’s bullshit. You label us as cowards and criminals, though half of us are only here because we’re from the poor side of town. Cut the shit, Dumah. We’re cowards, and we’re criminals, and we’re poor, but we not stupid. We want that phone call. I think you fuckers owe us that.”
Castiel lifted herself away from the vanity and slowly walked towards Dean.
“I do,” Castiel said quietly, leaning over to tug his pants up, shimmying them over his hips and tucking his damp cock back in his briefs, wincing a bit in discomfort.
“But above all else,” Dean said, eyes on her, “it’s about love.”
He pushed open the door to the chapel and witnessed the very moment when Alastair drove an angel blade through Castiel. A scream bubbled in his throat, and very nearly escaped, but Cas’ drowned his out. For the first time in all of his memories of Cas, he saw her panic. She clawed at her stomach, blood pooling over her hands and dripping from her mouth. All in a moment, Dean realised that in Hell, she’d never been scared for herself, only him. Not to mention, in Hell, the enemies hadn’t been a threat to her; they hadn’t been equipped with angel blades, with weapons powerful enough to take down an angel.
“AUNT JAMIE!”
“More than one brother?” Uriel asked, pretending to be shocked. “The nerve.”
“What’d you say, Sam?” Dean asked, grinning widely and tilting his head to the side. “Wanna be in my play?”
“You not gonna sit in the front with me?” Dean asked as he slid into the front, and scowled at Cas in the rearview.
confession of love, but this one hit him like a truck and he blinked for a few moments, stunned. Then, after realizing humans usually responded to amazing, extraordinary, mind-blowing, heart-swelling declarations like that, he croaked, “I know that.”
“I just
Between his palms, Dean nodded and for the love of God...he parted his lips. They parted like their sole purpose was to be Fuck Me Lips for Castiel’s cock to slide into.
One of Dean’s shaking hands reached up and he pressed his fingertips to his lips, his chin tilted down. Throwing up, it seemed, was quite a real possibility.
It was happening again now. His chest could hardly hold the coiled barbed wire ball of anxiety as he thought of Cas in captivity at the hands of angels who were going to use him to make more angels, who were going to… No, Dean couldn’t think of what they were going to do to Cas. He just knew he had to save him. Him, and their kid. Their kid who hadn’t asked for anything yet, who did nothing to deserve being left behind or forgotten, who shouldn’t pay for Dean’s baggage and former history with his offspring.
Alastair was strung up on the altar at the end of a long, dusty red carpet. He was humming and tapping his toe, staring at the ceiling with a grin on his face. Dean stood at the doors to the church, with Cas leaning on the doorframe looking grave, and Uriel standing on his other side, a smirk curled onto his lips.
“I didn’t rip it out,” Duma laughed, her face alight with pride. Her chin tipped up. “I took it out with care and dignity, and left it in the hands of alphas who kept it safe for me until I returned.”
“A profound bond,” Castiel supplied, tilting his head, turning his lips into Dean’s palm, lips grazing the tips of his fingers.
“I’m starting to really like it up here,” Meg murmured around her curled lips, taking a loud slurp from her drink. “Thought it was kinda quaint and boring and a little
. Sam knew Dean well enough to know that he was avoiding any opportunity that Sam gave to rehash the subject. It was obvious what Dean was doing, but that didn’t make it easy to deal with. He was grumpy, closed, and all-in-all exhaustingly bitchy.
“Jody is another of the house mother for the angels,” Ash continued to explain. “She’ll make sure they’re taken care of and that their patrons don’t mistreat them. You’ll meet her eventually.”
“Right,” he nodded abruptly, reaching out in the small space between them to take the papers from her. They slipped from her hands easily, and he moved around her to put them back on the table by the window where she’d retrieved them. “Well, I’ll definitely be working on it more over the rest of the weekend.”
With the basin emptied, silence fell on the room, and with a pang in his chest, Sam was sure that it hadn’t worked because Castiel remained still in his arms. “I don’t think…”
Dean shook his head. “Cas, I’m not mad. We’re being fucking tortured everyday. Everything feels like shit, and even when we’re scared, we still get hard, we still get boners. It feels like a betrayal to me when my body likes those first coupla orgasms, so I’m not surprised that you liked her mouth for a second. Relax, dude. You didn’t, like, cheat on me or anything.”
moved his body slowly. First feet, then thighs pulled languidly back and forth, the melody drawing a curl from his hips with every ethereal drone of
“Cas…”
Castiel’s eyes remained open, staring at Zachariah’s face as he relaxed and kissed her back. She held the kiss for only a few moments before pulling away, flashing her teeth in a crooked little side-smile. “Don’t think about it for too long,” she whispered. “I would so hate to wait to see you again.”
To his surprise, Hannah stood in the doorway, a big cheerful smile on her face. Over her shoulder Castiel stood half in the shadows, frowning. It the same look of concentration she always wore, although as soon as she met his eye her shoulders went back and she smiled softly.
“They’re corrupt!” Chuck exclaimed, opening his eyes, blinking more tears from his eyes. He raised his head and looked between everyone. “I heard Anna spill the beans. They’ve been working with Ruby—”
Castiel blinked, but Dean looked over and winked, triggering a quiet laugh that they both shared. Tension diffused.
Abruptly, Dean pulled away, his face draining of heat and colour. His hands pulled away from Cas’ skin and while they stood inches from each other, Dean was suddenly frightened to touch him again, feeling guilt ram into his stomach like a freight train.
Cas watched Dean’s brave face melt away as he saw everyone give in.
Everyone turned to John, who glanced up and did a sweep of the table before he ducked down for another bite, but not before adding, “You’re smart. You can do anything.”
For some stupid fucking reason, he felt a bit breathless looking around. The home was...well, home. He felt immediately like he’d been here before—or rather, his heart decided he had been, like this was where it lived, where it felt familiar.
Castiel realised he was hugging his stomach again, a natural reaction to feeling anxious, and he lowered his arms to his side with his fingers curled into fists.
The woman abruptly got up, yanking the towel off the floor and twisting it around her body with an angry jerk of her arms. “You’re a pig,” she retorted. “And a terrible liar.”
Shortly after they’d picked themselves up off the floor, Cas had been ushered to the bathroom and ordered to clean up; Dean didn’t explain why in detail, but he knew that kind of sex always required some extra thorough clean-up and he left Cas to figure it out.
Energized by the fact that this hot, nice guy wanted to spend
“Keep the griping to a minimum,” Dean snapped, grabbing the top of the hood and pulling it down. The demon’s screams and snarls were muffled under the dark metal, and blocked out completely by the rumble of Baby’s engine and the screeching of tires as the car swerved out of the crossroad, leaving dust in her wake.
By the end of the first twenty-four hours, most furniture in the room was broken; wood shattered, metal dented, and turned over if it could be turned over. Still, no one came except to bring him food.
"Non-believers, I suppose," Alastair supplied thoughtfully, bobbing his foot. Then he glanced over and Dean and asked, "Angels are like fairies, right? Clap if you believe and all that jazz?"
Around the most delicious meal he’d had in his lifetime, Dean nodded and replied, “Be happy to.”
“Well, thing about that—” a voice said from behind him, peppy and cheery, “—is that you’ve kind of been exiled from Heaven, Anna!”
Sam walked back towards the house, his hair curling at the ends against the humidity of the post-storm air. He was chilled to the bone, but it had nothing to do with the crisp weather and everything to do with the fact that he’d locked his brother in a room that tortured him, and basically screamed at him for being a faithless addict. He’d implied he would be better off dead than what he was. It had been so aggressive of Sam to say, and he wasn’t sure where it had come from, but to hear Dean say he
! It was all my idea—”
With a scowl, Bobby went back to filling the pints in front of him. He threw Sam a wide-eyed look of disbelief. As if it was his first night being a bar owner, Bobby barked, “Balls, this is exhausting! IRV! GET OVER HERE, I NEED BACK UP!”
“What the fuck is with you angels popping up all over my life unannounced?” Dean barked at Uriel, who crossed his arms across his chest and scowled.
Castiel watched the gears turn in Naomi’s head and he knew the idea of spending time one-on-one with Hannah, who was bright and bubbly and talked her way through any silence, was her idea of a nightmare. But...he also knew Naomi had been a young pre-teen when the Spice Girls had been at the peak of their fame—she’d be hard-pressed to turn down the offer.
It was heartbreaking. He could see her resolve crumble before him, and she was left looking shattered behind blue eyes. Her throat worked and Cas gazed at him, her expression otherwise neutral were it not for the wetness of her eyes that she was trying to quickly blink away.
“Open,” she ordered.
“You’re going to fix that, right?” Dean asked. He eyed her through narrowed slits.
Cas reached over with one leg and kicked Dean hard in the ankle. He hissed and mouthed a few choice curse words at her. In response, Cas whispered, “Don’t goad her! She has our daughter, you idiot.”
“Return to work is conditional on your voluntary submission to the repopulation program, and dependant on the results of the lottery,” she’d explained, tears in her eyes.
Lilith was frozen, her limbs pulled out, flexing and twitching. The tendons of her neck strained through her skin and she gurgled, choking, gagging.
Uriel appeared at the threshold to the kitchen and the study, smirking. Cas stood behind him, looking grim.
“Hold her,” he ordered to his goon as he stared at them across the bed. “She’ll fulfill her deal, I don't care how willing she may be—”
Dean snorted, “When did you have time to punch a bunch of people
“Man,” Dean said with a shake of his head, his chin tipping back as he gazed at the sky between the skyscrapers, “Tool was damn good. Who knew, not only would I not miss them at the festival, but I’d watch ‘em twice in one week. What a fuckin’ show. Did you have a good time?”
“We should catch up,” he said, giving Dean’s hand a squeeze.
Dean watched the exchange with a strange feeling. Everyone was so playful and carefree. It seemed almost as if…they liked each other. He felt a pang in his gut as he remembered his own tense family dinners. His father usually drank too much, if he didn’t it was because he was already drunk. More often than not it ended with something being smashed and someone being yelled at.
Castiel smiled such a bright smile that it was like a miniature sunrise on his face. In that moment Dean vowed to do everything in his power to see that smile more often.
Dean switched his cup to the other hand and laced his fingers with Cas’s, then let himself indulge a little and leaned slightly against Cas. The turtle was set neatly on Cas’s thigh, it’s glossy black eyes staring at nothing.
“No Dean. I — Did I hurt you?”
Cas shuffled lower, letting his breath ghost over Dean were he lay, twitching and already glistening.
Dean felt his jaw drop. Theres no way someone was that good. He wouldn’t have believed it unless he saw it with his own eyes, which he just did, and yet he still had trouble believing it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you have nightmares again?” Cas asked gently. But fuck, why not just stand up and announce it to the world? Dean blushed darkly.
“I promise you I’m real Dean. I’m right here and I’m just as real as you are.”
He brought the soup to a final boil, and the aroma of seasoned vegetables must have drawn Sam out of the library because he poked his shaggy head through the kitchen door.
He would kill Sam, drink him dry.
Cas turned his head out of the crook of Charlie’s shoulder to look at her. She looked heartbroken for him. He breathed out slowly, trying to collect the pieces of himself. Some part of him knew she was right. Soulmates didn’t always get along, but it usually worked itself out. And he had approached Dean kind of abruptly.

Cas swallowed. Ohio was pretty far, but from the torn look on Dean’s face, it was clear that he already knew that. Cas sat gingerly on the sofa. He didn’t know what Dean needed right now, but it definitely wasn’t a glimpse into his erratically selfish heart.
“Oh well thats sweet of him. You only have the one bag so it’ll be easy to switch rooms,” Benny said with a very uncharacteristic eyebrow wiggle. Dean threw a shirt at him.

raised in barns.”
“Hi. I mean hello. Sir. I’m Castiel. It’s very nice to meet you. We weren’t- I mean I wasn’t-”
“Can I see them again?”
Benny comes over to hang out. Dean has a nightmare.
On the kitchen table Dean found a still warm scrambled egg, a couple pieces of bacon, and a sliced cucumber arranged on a plate. The dishes had been washed as well.
“Cas you’re okay. It’s all okay,” Dean murmured by his ear. He knew this demon all too well, the viscous guilt, the back and forth, the mood swings. He was aware that Cas knew his mother’s death wasn’t his fault, but he was also aware that sometimes the logical train of thought just didn’t seem so logical.
And there it was. The exterior cracked. The poison was flooding out. Dean wanted to grab Sam and run but he couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.
It was a split second distraction, but it was enough for the ball to drop, and Dean’s hand swung pathetically though empty air.
Cole laughed. “Yeah right man. When was the last time you spent a planned day with anyone instead of a one night stand?”
He held Dean’s unconscious body close and lifted him, carefully tucking his face into his chest before he carried him up the stairs. Sam passed him on the way out and returned back to the car with a full vial of dark liquid just as Cas was settling Dean into the backseat.
Castiel turned his eyes to his own page and began working out the problems without even really thinking about them. His eyes kept sliding towards Dean, who was now tugging at his hair in frustration.
Undefeated.
“Ready?” Gabriel asked, flipping the keys on their ring.
This is set the night before Dean was dragged into hell. It’s not cannon compliant, not even if you squint, but bear with me. Also, minimally edited but what are you gonna do about it? (I’m kidding, please point out my mistakes <3)
the Righteous Man-"
Dean. He knew the map of his veins, knew the nightmares that kept him up, knew the atrocities he had committed happily in Hell. Being known wasn't so bad at all when it was Cas who was doing the knowing and somehow in the intervening years between that physical Hell and this mental one, Dean has forgotten what it's like to be alone in his head, to be unknown. It feels strange to let his mind wander and not think of the angel down the hall, strange to know just thinking his name won't make him appear.
He's free.
The angel has the nerve to look affronted. "He's a devout man, he actually prayed for this."
Not fully, he quickly realizes, but the rope and the body hanging from it are both blazing. The fire licks at the night sky, spitting embers and dark smoke, growing so large so quickly that Dean wonders how anyone hasn't noticed before it's just- gone. The fire banks and the body hanging from the noose falls to the ground. Dean's moving before he can think, running to- well, to the perfectly fine, normal-looking man standing up out of the ashes. If it weren't for the scorch marks on the ground and the half-melted remains of a set of handcuffs dangling from one wrist, Dean wouldn't believe this man was dead a few minutes ago.
Still, Dean has experience with this and Sammy is his litter brother; he will do everything he can to steer him through the rough days ahead. He adds, just in case Sam can only read his articulated surface thoughts, that neither of them deserved this and Dean will do what he can to spare his brother.
"I had your skeleton and general shape to work with, but yes, for the most part," Castiel says.
The answer comes so quietly that Cas isn’t sure he was supposed to hear it at all. “She said I’m the hunger of
The moment hangs between them, stretches out like taffy and then it’s gone. Cas flinches violently and closes his eyes, tilts his head like he’s listening to something. “Adam is gone,” he says. “My brothers have yours.”

"That's why you're such a brat now," Dean says shakily. He
Cas turns those luminescent eyes on Dean. “You perform?”
When Sam shows up at his motel room exactly three months and three days after The End, Dean is understandably pissed. His first instinct is to beat the thing wearing his brother's skin to a bloody pulp. It's luck, really, and hard earned skill that saves Sam from his initial furious rush and once he's momentarily knocked off track, Sam convinces him to run the same gamut of supernatural tests on him that Bobby had done when Dean clawed his way out of his own grave.
to see it now that he appreciates how fleeting the sight of it can be. "I know," he says lowly. "I was awake, in the Empty. Everything was. I heard every prayer you made, Dean."
Dean shakes his head frantically; by now, he understands what duty is to Cas, just the same as Cas understands Dean's love of family. "I wouldn't," he says.
Dean had always thought his brother’s anger was too big for a normal person and in this moment he feels vindicated. Sam's teeth are bared and his skin seems to bubble and the midday light bends around him- he doesn't just look angry, he looks
Cas takes back the ground he loss and then presses closer still until he and Dean are nose to nose. He knows that nose, the slightly deviated septum that he rebuilt so carefully. He knows the placement of every single one of those freckles, the careful sweep of eyelashes, the overlong bottom canines. He does
That's a good question and the answer, very broadly, is no. Very specifically though, just to Castiel, the answer is, "I am saying that you might be mine."
Cas closes his eyes and Dean instantly regrets it. That shade of blue doesn't exist anywhere else and he
"I missed
him instead of from him, its maw open and dripping hellfire like foam from the mouth of a rabid dog. It’s young, Castiel can tell, and, like a baby snake, all the more dangerous for it. He side-steps that first rush and lifts his first set of wings just enough to let the light of his face blind it. It’s stunned for just a moment, just long enough for Castiel to get his arms around it and restrain it against his chest. The young demon rages against him, spitting hellfire and attempting to claw at his wings, but Castiel is stronger, if only barely. He feels himself heating up in preparation to finish his mission when the demon manages to sink its teeth into his arm. A piece of him comes away in its mouth.
Coincidentally, Dean jerked his head back a bit, coughing into his hand and wincing. “I’m not great at...when it goes too deep, y’know? S-Sorry.”
and dragged his eyes down her body weakly, probably looking very pathetic as he drank in the long fitted dark blue satin dress. The thin fabric hugged every single curve of her body until her hips, where it then hung straight down to the floor, flapping around high heels that made her the same height as Dean. Nothing about the dress left anything to the imagination, though Dean’s ran wild anyway. It was clear as day that she wore no undergarments. The thin, spaghetti straps that held up the piece of clothing sat snuggly on her shoulders, holding up the low-v cut.
“I’ll call you later,” Sam called over his shoulder, waving as he left abruptly, the door closing behind him with a sharp thud.
“He ain’t a regular demon.” Dean shifted in his seat.
His hand hovered there, and he felt an overwhelming surge of grief. The moment seemed robbed from a timeline when he’d said something back to Cas instead of being silent.
Soon, the room filled with Dean’s grunts and moans, and Castiel’s breath picked up to audible rasps while their flesh clapped and their melded bodies made slick noises as they fucked. The sight of Dean’s back muscles contracting and loosening, the dip of his spine shadowed where beads of sweat gathered, pushed Castiel closer to the edge than he could control. He’d have liked to fuck Dean face-to-face, but they would get there another time. He didn’t have the self-control to slow down to switch positions, because he was there, right there—
As they settled into their stable, a charming woman in a glittering black off-the-shoulder dress sauntered up to them holding a tray of champagne.
“Are you sure, guys? Do you want me to come with you?” Sam asked, eyeing the girls as they both turned on their heels and swept away.
Castiel looked between the angels; Zachariah, standing behind the angels holding his legs, with a smirk on his thin lips and a twinkle in his eye. The two angels at his feet were looking at each other, their expressions exhilarated, inspired, like they’d done something honourable and miraculous. The doors to his cell opened moments later and Uriel and Gadreel stepped through.
The welcome party was loud, rambunctious. Turned out, getting drunk was a very real thing in Heaven.
“How do you know what Dean ‘sounds’ like?”
The way she’d said the last bit was confusing. What did she know about Dean? To make such judgement calls about him…
Castiel swept forward, hair and trench coat billowing, her blade poised to kill—even if it hurt her to destroy a sibling—when she was knocked off her feet. Zachariah—stronger, faster, more powerful due to his rank—had thrown Anna across the room with a pulse of magnetic energy. It trembled through them like an earthquake through the ground. The women cried out, sliding across the floor and landing with a crash at the base of a statue in the corner. They moaned, heads having collided with brick and stone.
Dean thought to himself. Instead, he smiled, staring at her. In a whisper, he leaned forward playfully and teased, “Now I know what the angel looks like.”
But Dean jerked the car out of the parking spot and high-tailed it away from the church, wailing on the horn as a group of drunk people tried to stumble into the road from a bar a few doors down.
There was an awkward pause and Castiel felt intense pressure to fill the gap. Clearing his throat, he said raspily, “Yes, we are. Although I’m feeling a bit unwell, I thought I’d get a drink and find somewhere to cool down before they come on.”
Their sweaty foreheads pressed together.
He saw it; the flicker of uncertainty. Then, it was gone. Cas’ face fell into a stoic expression and she stepped towards him, impassive and serious.
“You’re being a child!”
“You’re right, friend. I’ll explain where the gates are, and when I’m done…” Gadreel held out his blade handle-first to Castiel. “Ensure you make it look convincing.”
While Hannah blathered on about how excited she was to see TLC—she had been too young to see them when they were at the height of their popularity—the group moved through the crowd. The day was unendingly hot and the festival took place in the middle of a series of fields, each with huge professional stages set up and decked with flashing lights, decorative sets, and presumably pyrotechnics.
Gloved hands tangled in his shirt as they shoved him back, uncaring if his head hit the brick too hard and he saw stars.
“Stupid. An
“They got hit by a car,” Dean finished for her, seeing the corners of her eyes grow thick with tears.
She was beaming up at Sam, who talked to her in hushed tones, and was beaming back, blushing. Dean grinned to himself; Sammy boy had a crush.
He'd so easily picked up that blade. He'd so easily conjured an endless list of fucked up things to do for Alastair, and he'd taken pleasure in the demon's shrieks of agony.
“Oh, hey!” Sam said cheerfully, reaching out to let Jack sniff his hand. “You have a dog. Didn’t peg you as a dog person.”
“You brought Castiel into the bunker,” Zeke said in a clipped manner. “You...intend on keeping Castiel in the bunker. For how long?”
The men exchanged nods and Ishim disappeared after clapping Dean on the shoulder and stepping out into the hallway. To afford them privacy, Ishim closed the door behind himself with a click.
It became hard to swallow for a second, and then Dean said, “Yeah. I guess so.”
“Your wings,” Castiel breathed, his vision shaking with relief. His hands came up to slide over hers. “I can see your wings.”
He hadn’t expected, as he pointed his gun at the demon inhabiting Jimmy’s wife, for Cas to return. And he hadn’t expected Cas to return like
Jody, Ellen, Jo, Michael, and Luci all ducked through the crowd, moving tables out of the way to create a dance floor. Those angels who had their clients for the night tugged them out onto the dance floor, their hips moving and lashes fluttering as they pulled them into erotic dances, their bodies writhing.
“Hello Dean--” was all she got to say.
Any discomfort about Castiel’s intentions shifted from being about his vengeance to a chilling realization...
“Or,” Dean said, his teeth clinking together. Though it made him feel sick, he said, “I'll do whatever it takes, even...even if it means I gotta stay here and Sam goes back to Lebanon.”
Dean.
Dean couldn’t see Cas’ face, but he could see the way he bristled and his shoulders got tight, forming a rigid line under his beige coat. In his stomach, Dean felt a strange abrupt spike of anger and defensiveness.
“Speaking of joking,” Uriel said, sounding like he’d thought of something hilarious, his voice dripping with amusement, “boss man didn’t notice my email signature yet.”
“Oh yeah.” Ishim nodded, his leathery skin crinkling under his grey stubble as he smirked. “Farmers nearby said they heard a commotion near, and smelled sulfur so strong it stung their eyes and burnt their crops. They heard a couple of young men screaming for their lives by the tracks a mile away, then a train went by and it was dead quiet.”
“Dean?” Castiel asked, stepping forward and reaching out, his hand hovering over Dean’s shoulder. “What—”
Behind him, he was leaving a child.
Dean | 12:47 (October 21st, 2019): should I lie then?
“Wait,” Dean muttered against Cas’ lips, though Castiel ignored him at first, arching his spine, pressing their chests together. With a snort and a grin against Castiel’s lips, he growled, “
His teeth began to chatter, though it had little to do with the chill in the air and everything to do with Sam.
“In a very special place.”
“You’re leaving?” Hannah asked, looking up at Sam, her throat working. “You’re
When Dean came out from the washroom, Jack prancing along happily at his ankles, Castiel had forgotten about Naomi’s shenanigans. Half-way through his earlier reverie as he stared at the muted TV, he’d realised—like he’d been hit with a train—that Dean had said he really, really liked him. And he’d done it with sincerity, with feeling, with a show of trust and—
With his head turned away from Uriel, Castiel found himself staring at Gadreel, who was staring back, his eyes pinched, his mouth twisted into a grimace. Gadreel had his head turned away from Sophia, tipped towards the wall, although he did not tear his eyes away from Castiel’s face. For a stupid, small moment, it almost felt like Castiel had someone on his side. What an idiotic notion.
Dean and Sam looked at each other in horror, and he almost wanted to take the gun from Castiel’s hands because it shook so terribly. If Cas fired, he’d miss. He’d kill Hannah.
‘D’. Not ‘love, D’. Just ‘D’, like even the scratchy capital letters were trying to hold him at an arms’ length.
Turning around to rest his back against the railing and gaze into the house, Dean spotted Cas emerge from the bathroom, padding around in his underwear. Affection blossomed in his heart as he watched Cas go back to scowling at his lint-y pants. He smiled. “Yeah. I’m bringing Cas.”
“Naomi, she seems like a mean ol’ snake,” Dean pointed out. “I saw the way she spoke to you on that night a few weeks ago, at the last cabaret.”
“When?!” Dean burst out, louder than he expected. “Ash a-a-and Jo, and, and fucking
“Whoever survives,” Castiel said, “gets to be with me
The boys leaned away from each other as a tall, elegant-looking waitress spoke, alerting them to her presence. Dean blinked up at her, unsure how long she’d been standing there.
Dean was getting hard, his pants tight and restrictive, while his heart beat a mile a minute. He itched for Cas to put his hands on him too, to finally live his fantasies in real life.
Dean’d had every intention of not thinking about Cas, or feeling guilt over Cas, or giving into the feelings of deep-seated longing to see her and be forgiven. He wanted to respect that she didn’t want to see or talk to him, and he wanted to accept that she hated him for throwing her out.
Ice pooled in Dean’s stomach and Cas nodded, “We have orders that include terminating her, if retrieving her is too troublesome.”
“One baby?” Sam asked.
“But now, we’re like forty minutes past my check-in time, and we still gotta bring the Impala back to Sam, because he wanted to drive out to some beach that I have no freakin’ interest in going to. Sand gets in really weird places and—” Dean waved a hand, licking his upper lip with the tip of his tongue, dismissing himself. “Anyway, we got other hunter-related stuff to do now, and Sam’s gonna want a de-brief, and just...I guess the fucking like wild animals thing can wait.”
“Whatever, jerk.”
Anger twinged in his chest. His lips pressed together. Charlie didn’t notice, too busy scanning the script.
Two fingers, slick with lube, pushed into him and Castiel made a noise of surprise in his throat that Dean swallowed with a kiss.
“We found this case and had been wanting to interview the nanny,” Sam replied, his voice still tinged with shock and joy in a way that made Dean’s stomach hurt. Sam’s scowl was quickly morphing into an overjoyed grin again. “We had no idea it was you, that you’d be here. A-Are you okay?”
“Got it,” he mouthed at Cas, smiling despite how stressed Cas looked. She rubbed at her forehead and swept out of the room again, gnawing on her lip.
“Yeah, yeah, that’s not the issue.” Sam waved his hand. “I mean, yeah, it makes me weirdly proud of her. She did all of this on her own and she went from not knowing anything about being a human to like, scheduling her monthly payments. I mean, hell, it’s more adult than we’ve ever been, but, uh...”
“You gonna nap, Cas?” Sam asked gently, turning in his seat.
Dean rolled his eyes but did proceed forward, comforted to hear Sam’s footsteps follow closely. The boys reached the center of the cave and turned in opposite directions, going back-to-back as they stared around the cavern, their lights slowly moving over empty, dried out pods and fresh ones that glistened.
“Hi, Dean,” Hannah greeted, raising a gloved hand in a quick wave. Castiel stayed quiet behind her, peering into Dean’s apartment with an air of anxiousness.
"When you went to Heaven to check on the angels…" Sam exhaled slowly through his nose, talking to Jack but watching Dean clutch his phone. "Did… Was he… I mean—"
—the true extent of his humour. HR jokes, Christ—Castiel followed Dean, falling into step with him as they wove through the crowd and emerged onto the path between the stages.
“I have to go. I don’t have time for this nonsense. I have an appointment.”
He was ranting. Cas smiled at him over his shoulder, scratching Miracle on the head as he bounced up to lick at his fingers. “Yes, Jack told me as much as soon as the animal landed here—sometime between your death and Sam’s. It’s only been a day or so, but he’s settled quite nicely in this home. Eats my cherry tomatoes right off the vine, though. It’s probably for the best; they grow like weeds and I can’t keep up.”
“I’ll orgasm if you keep going,” Cas’s breathes were harsh and wheezing. “I can feel it.”
When Castiel said ‘shit’, Dean grinned a little and chuckled, “At dating dudes.”
Ironic, how she carried around one of the only weapons that could hurt her.
down. It gets in the way.”
Or rather, he realised, she was looking for someone.
“You sure you’re not an angel still?” Dean said thickly around a mouthful of piping hot saucy pasta and hearty, creamy beef. He hissed as it burned down his throat. “Didn’t—ah, fuck, it’s hot—You sure you didn’t mojo this into a freakin’ masterpiece?”
“Alastair!” Uriel growled.
As Dean picked himself up from the floor, the young woman blinked at them, her green eyes wide. Her two companions—clothed as if they’d gotten dressed in the dark—looked shocked at their own misfortune.
“‘Kay,” Castiel said, wincing as his stomach clenched and sent a hot wave of pain down through his torso. Dean caught on and took his hand, linking their fingers for a minute as he helped guide Cas up onto his bed.
Castiel sounded like a real piece of work. Dean instantly didn’t like her.
"Dean, I'm pretty sure there's no lore for whatever happened to me-"
Sam stands to his full height and his face twists into something sad, but the tears Deanna remembers coming so easily to him are nowhere to be found. He raises a knife-
"That doesn't mean he couldn't have been the Righteous Man," Dean says bitterly, "it just means I died first."
How could he get it so wrong? All those eyes and he couldn’t see what was in Dean’s heart? He takes a step forward, teeth bared. “That’s
Castiel blinks and tilts his head. "I recreated you as you were. Your own specifications pulled from your head."
"Sam-"
"We won," Dean says. "We won, you stopped him. We won, we- we lost Cas."
He doesn’t do the whole song- it’s like seven verses long and not nearly as fun to sing as
Dean would like to be sure of things again. He would like to be able to swallow down his anger and be kind. He would like to be the kind of man who decided to coax Amara to help them instead of threatening her, who actually managed to protect Kevin, who raised Ben instead of just putting him in danger. He would like to be whichever version of himself that didn't hold Death's Scythe to Sam's neck with every intention of killing him.
Dean realizes now that love looks different on Castiel. With Lisa, it had looked like sharing her home and letting him into her son's life. With Cas, love looks like blood. It looks like a civil war started for the sake of Dean's free will, like learning to tolerate and then love Sam, someone whose very existence threatened what Cas was created for. It looked like his serenely happy face as the Empty reached for him.
Dean shrugs, unaffected. “Not for lack of trying, man. I hitched a ride on a phoenix of all things to get here. To get to you.”
He wonders if he was telling the truth when he told Chuck that he wasn’t the same man he was. Just because he doesn’t torture in Hell anymore doesn’t mean he isn’t still capable of atrocity, culpable for them.
kisses him.
There's no more Cas.
Cas, the angel,
say yes!” She nudges his foot with her own to get him to look at her again. “Nothing we do is easy, it never will be, but somebody’s gotta do it. And if there’s anything I know, it’s that my baby brother is the most stubborn person in the world.”
,” he insists. “I’m one of her monsters; she just wants me to eat. She promised we could leave if I did.”
It’s a strange thing because Castiel is more intent made solid than natural-born flesh and he can feel that part of himself still, feel the compression and fire of the demon’s throat, feel himself get stuck there and burrow in where he doesn’t belong. The demon has swallowed a chunk of grace and it just doesn’t agree with him. It gags and that ever-present hellfire begins to burn white, lighting up his veins. Its angry growls morph into pained moaning and Castiel aches to reach out to it, unsure of what’s happening and guilty for that lack of surety. He’s never seen a demon
about Dean’s wellbeing and unfortunately for both of them, he learned how to care from the Winchesters.
The first time Dean prayed, it was beside his brother's hospital bed. He didn't go to the chapel downstairs in the hospital or even leave the room. He didn't call out for God, or strength, or grace. He had thought,
, okay? Let’s put a pin in that.”
, yes, but not the first
After centuries in Hell, Deanna’s version of a flinch is baring her teeth. She does it now, looking around the room for signs of occupation. It looks like it’s just Sam here, neat and unpacked. “Where’s Dad?”
In the end, Dean can't forget the sound of a man he had once honestly called a friend screaming out for him to
a monster, you are some of my finest work, but not because of your ill-fitting skin. Your soul remembers who you were before, that's what makes you so strong, it's what makes you
think I should do is serenade these good people here, if you’ll excuse me, Samantha.” Dean’s gone before Sam can respond, having shot up so fast that his chair rocks a little in his wake.
Regardless of his lack of thought, the place Castiel finds himself in still defies expectations. Castiel isn’t important in the grand scheme of things, he knows this- he’s not an archangel and his shiny new seraph status doesn’t make him the center of the universe or anything- but a whole plane of existence is a bit much for the higher ups to hide from view, right?
She hesitates. Sam steps back, a challenging brow raised. He’s so
He clears his throat and leans into the mic, incredibly conscious of all of the people paying him no mind, and he starts to sing. “
"I would not kneel for anyone."
He stumbles down the empty halls to his bathroom. He wishes it wasn't so quiet, wishes the hunters they saved from Apocalypse World were living with them again, but he's also glad he's alone for all intents and purposes- if anyone but Sam and Jack were haunting the bunker with him, he wouldn't be able to allow himself to grieve at all.
Purgatory isn’t what Dean was expecting, but the ride there is. It’s hot and fast and Elias starts screaming halfway there. Whatever he feared so much sinks its claws into him and drags them along to their destination even faster.  One by one, he can feel Elias’ fingers falling away from him and then there’s no more Elias at all. Dean’s back hits the ground hard and he’s alone in a twilight forest. It’s full of petrified wood and the smell of old blood; it calls to him.
Of course, when he gets his answers, the come violently. Every blow from Castiel’s disproportionately heavy hands feels a little like benediction and Dean finds himself leaning into the pain.
Somehow the perfect blankness of his face conveys absolute confusion as Castiel says, "I told you."
It’s so easy to set yourself on fire when you’re young. Dean may not have actually lived the years, but he can feel the age in his bones, can feel the way they creak sometimes when he squats. He wants so badly to keep living, but he knows he can’t do it alone. He won’t.
The next words shake the building again and something in Dean's chest freezes. "Because you are the Righteous Man. Because we have work for you."
He's already rushing to Bobby's side, feeling along his neck for a pulse. "You-" he starts.
Cas says without thinking, “Lovable.” And why should he have to think, anyway? He’s dead now and what he has to say doesn’t truly matter. Not like it did. He can’t break Dean’s heart more than he already has.
The third kiss is held off by Dean pulling back to suck in great lungfuls of air. He’d forgotten to breath and Cas had forgotten to let him, but it was fine, it was
Castiel walks to him and kneels so close that his knees brush the toes of Dean's shoes. He thinks, suddenly, that he understands communion, he understands that strange urge humans have always had to consume their gods. He says, "There have been a rare few things I have cared about in my long existence, but none have been more important to me than you. I would leave my post if you asked."
. Well, but Dean wants to let them try. He wants to see what walks out the other side.
“Why do you keep calling me that?” she says.
“But Dean, I think you should talk about-”
“And what was… ‘that’? Don’t tell me you went all
Jack is will be a kinder, softer God and Dean hopes that that means a kinder, softer world, but where does that leave him? The closer he gets to home with an empty backseat and a grown Sammy in his passenger seat, the more Dean feels like a relic of a passing age.
Dean smiles to himself and leaves Sam to it, pulling himself out of the car and grabbing their bags from the trunk. He
The second kiss is slower, quieter. A promise of a future full of ravenous moments, a reminder that they never need to ration this feeling.
desire, he is the desperate want of lovers and survivors and addicts.
“It does! It does to me!” Dean’s voice bounces off the petrified wood around them, briefly making the forest seem alive and
Strangely, that answer seems to please the angel and he leans back in his seat, too comfortable and too intense. He seems more solid than everything around him just the same way as Sam sometimes does when he comes back to the motel room late at night from the meeting with that demon Dean isn’t supposed to know about.  “No,” Cas says finally, “your performance is a private one.”
So Dean
And nothing happens. She doesn’t stop or disintegrate. She just steps in like a normal human and Sam eyes her suspiciously, leaning away from her hand. She tries not to feel hurt. “When did you turn into sasquatch, huh? I don’t remember signing off on that.”
The only thing that has ever truly healed is the handprint on his shoulder. It still itches from time to time.
Deanna looks down too. There’s a line of salt in front of Sam’s feet, perfectly white and undisturbed. Huh. Maybe she is a ghost- she hasn’t seen a single soul outside of Sam in the two days she’s been awake, but the car she stole worked fine for her and she’s eaten and drank water in that time. Probably, she’s alive. She would notice if she was dead.
Something about the tone of his voice makes Elias' shoulders slump. He looks down and away, face twisted into a sneer like whatever he's feeling is a personal affront to him. "I lost my wife two days ago. She was... if I had the chance to get her back, I would do anything, even face my mother again."
When she thinks of all that, it’s really only surprising that John Winchester lasted this long.
it was made until this moment.
It is trauma, Dean recognizes the taste of it in the back of his mouth, coating his tongue like copper. It feels like Chuck's fists left permanent divots in Dean’s cheekbones. It was such a strange thing to get into a fistfight with God and come out of it feeling clean. Every broken bone and drop of blood felt like another sin struck off the record because this was for the good of humanity. It was to
"But I know this one's name," Castiel growls and he focuses very carefully on not crushing the delicately human bones of Dean's hand. After a moment to collect himself, he adds, "John didn't last half as long as you did. He was already off the rack when I came for you."
"I'm an angel of the Lord." Lightning crackles at just the right time and illuminates the wide, dark expanse of his wings. He wonders about the other two sets, if the angel even has them in this form.
It sits with him after that, heavy and uneasy. Cas' voice calling him the Righteous Man again and again on repeat, louder than his heartbeat and twice as life affirming.
For the first time in months, Dean leaves Bobby's house of his own free will, Baby's trunk loaded down with the ingredients for a summoning. He drives for hours, looking for a secluded place far away from where Sam might think to look for him. Another abandoned barn at night, another hour of annoyance at how tight the scars on his chest are, another indeterminate period of waiting before the angel he called for strolls through the doors.
too like an animal- Dean Winchester does not wear anyone’s brand, he doesn’t follow anyone’s orders any more. The ringing is getting louder, drowning out his thoughts and matching his heartbeat. This feels like an insult, like an affront.
“I wanted to check on you progress.” It sounds hollow, like a lie. Cas doesn’t need to come to some dive bar to check on them, not really. Dean gets the strange idea that this is the angel’s version of a social call.
Dean doesn't take to grief well. It sits too heavy in his chest, makes him waspish, makes him mean. He thinks that maybe he just knows too much now to let someone he cares about stay dead.
"What's the matter?" The angel has no respect for personal space and no respect for his own safety. Every time he has gotten too close to Dean, he's come away hurt, but that doesn't stop him from moving to stand so close that Dean starts to sweat from the heat of him. "You don't think you deserve to be saved."
