Dean grins and kisses him again, then bends to whisper in Cas’ ear. “And when this is over, we’ll ditch the graduation parties our parents have worked so hard for, get in Baby, and drive ‘till we hit the west coast, gorgeous. You and me.”
Dean laughs again and leans forward to press a kiss to Cas’ cheek. Sam, sitting next to Charlie across from them, gags, and Charlie whips out her phone and snaps a picture before either of them can object.
about halfway through (some IRL stuff, some mental illness stuff, y'all know). It's a cute little story and I'm certain I will like it a lot once I have some space from it, but for now, I'm glad it's finished and I'm so, so very glad and grateful for everyone who read and enjoyed it. Y'all keep me going. 💜
Using a very small amount of compulsion, he says, “I need you to draw up the requisite transfer paperwork so I can take him back to my own facility, Nurse Moseley.”
He works to even out his breathing as he listens to Dean move around in their bathroom. A drawer opens and closes, the cabinet door swings shut, and the water goes on and off a few times before Dean comes back into the bedroom.
The man has extremely dark skin, with dark eyes and hair to match. His hair is cropped close to his head, as it has been since Castiel has known him. He’s wearing a business suit, which is jarring for some reason Castiel can’t seem to put his finger on.
It’s because of this that he forces himself to relax. There’s not a lot he can do about his pained scent, but he forces his body language to abandon the defensiveness he took on when Cas whipped his pup out of the room like it was on fire.
into his mouth, and after hurriedly hushing him, proceeds to pound at that exact spot mercilessly. The sound of skin slapping against skin seems obscenely loud.
He gets dressed as quickly as he can and hobbles into the kitchen. He’s not surprised to be the only one awake, but it’s the first time it’s happened. The farm is peaceful this early, birds chirping softly to one another in the nearby woods. The chickens are clucking and scuffling around just beneath the window in the kitchen, and Dean can hear the gentle movements of the cow, too.
When he was younger, Dean’s favorite Cas was naked Cas. All that pale, smooth skin, his to touch and kiss and mark up? It was no contest.
Gabriel asked, of course, after they fled Naomi’s house, about the First. Castiel tried to keep an open mind, tried to let Gabriel make his own choices, but ultimately told him everything he knew. That all of the research he’d done for Naomi to track down Lucifer had come up empty, useless. She’d never been happy about that particular report, but in the end, Castiel had never found anything.
Cas arches a dark eyebrow. “I have a feeling you don’t plan to stick around here, anyway. I’m not terribly concerned.”
A soft gasp from his left. Hester, then. She’s the youngest, only fifteen, and she hasn’t learned the advantage of keeping a good poker face yet.
He vaguely remembers setting Zeke and Meg up to sleep on his couch, piling it high with blankets. He supposes that it makes sense that he would have hugged Zeke, too. Cas hugs
Gabriel’s voice has them pulling away from one another, but not all the way. Cas keeps his arms around Dean when they both turn to glare at the shorter vampire.
Michael is quite easily led (like his father before him), and Hannah seems to be going that way, too. Anna idolizes Castiel, however, and is another in a long list of reasons that Naoi is shamefully relieved that Castiel has, despite (or perhaps because of) her attempts to lure him to a local college, decided to go to a university on one of the coasts.
Balthazar, from his place next to Sam, snorts disdainfully, though he doesn’t look up from the report he’s skimming through. “Speak for yourself,” he says breezily, “some of us are extraordinary.”
Dean shakes his head, a fond smile on his face. He approaches Cas slowly and takes his hand. Castiel finds himself completely unable to resist Dean’s gentle tugging, and he lets his boy tug him back toward the bed.
Dean keeps the gun pointed at Zeke, but he comes to Cas and uses his free arm to crush him close. Cas goes, shuddering and wrapping trembling arms around Dean’s neck. He buries his face in his husband’s shoulder and clings.
The girl knocks on the last door on the left. “Miss Naomi? James, Dean Winchester, and a guest are here to see you.”
Dean stiffens beneath Cas’ hand and lifts his head to share a look with him. Castiel knows that, if he says so, Sam will accept that this isn’t information that he’s willing to share. It will be dropped, and nothing will be held against him.
“Of course, pup,” Dean answers, his own voice much less composed than Cas’ was. “Go get ready, I’ll come in when you’re in bed.”
They let The Pack outside and Dean feeds all of them while Cas starts the shower. Once the dogs are settled, he hurries to join Cas. He flings his clothes off haphazardly and slips into the shower behind Cas.
“Yeah, I think so, too,” Dean rasps. He pulls his fingers out slowly and shushes Cas when he starts to whine.
Dean inhales sharply but stays calm at Cas’ side. He is, once again, intensely grateful that Dean has adjusted so well to vampirism. He doesn’t know how well he would handle this without Dean next to him.
Cas smiles, because he knows, but is willing to play along. “You know I’ve always enjoyed having a third person in the house.”
out of the ordinary, but the third time he has to drag his mind away from cheeseburgers and French fries, he has to at least acknowledge the problem.
Despite his fear, Cas keeps his gaze steady and his voice hard. “I won’t date someone who isn’t planning on graduating, Dean.”
“No complaining, pup,” Cas says firmly, but not without fondness. “Go now, please. The sooner you’re done with work, the sooner you’ll be able to play.”
“Just checking to see if you would be at Lafitte’s tonight, but I suppose your attitude has already answered that question, hasn’t it?” he asks, one blonde eyebrow arched.
He scratches at his jaw for what feels like the fortieth time in an hour. It’s been a long time, too, since he went more than a day or two without shaving, and the itching is driving him mad.
Dean’s breath is harsh when he presses his lips to Cas’ ear. Cas realizes he must have dropped his head back to rest on Dean’s shoulder at some point, though he doesn’t remember doing it.
Cas is covered in a fine, lovely sheen of sweat. His hair is fluffy and messy, as always, with strands sticking to his forehead and neck here and there. His eyes are huge and dark, staring up at Dean with just as much hungry gravity as Dean is looking down at him with.
If he believes nothing else about last night, Dean believes that Cas wanted it just as much as he himself did, and that it was as good for Cas as it was for him.
He’s been tuning out John’s droning justifications while he panicked, his body flashing hot and cold as he processed the entire foundation upon which he’s built his life disappearing from beneath him. He tunes back in, but only to interrupt.
But Michael is the oldest, was the closest of the Novak children to their father, and he believes what Bartholomew believed.
Dean comes in while he’s struggling to focus, drying hair still damp from his shower. He’s silent as he tosses the towel into the hamper and pulls on a pair of briefs and pajama pants. Castiel watches him, is always watching Dean, and gives up the pretense of reading entirely. He assumes the silence is a product of the same nerves he’s suffering from until Dean seems to steel himself and comes to stand at the foot of the bed in front of Cas.
As a teenager, resentful of the expectations put on his young shoulders, Dean had turned to petty crime. Small stuff, shoplifting from convenience stores and getting into fights. He’d gotten caught, got some therapy, did his community service, and put it behind him.
“We don’t, but I believe she will be expecting us,” Castiel says grimly. The girl in front of him is a vampire, and he would honestly be surprised if she didn’t recognize him.
As Sam asks, Gabe seems to materialize in the doorway from the kitchen wearing a floor-length silk robe and giant fuzzy bunny slippers. Despite what he’s wearing, the stress of the last day shows itself in his face, in the tightness he carries around his eyes and at the corners of his mouth. He grips his coffee cup too tightly, and his eyes meet Cas’ as Sam asks his question.
“It’s not much…” Cas said, hesitant in that way he gets when he doesn’t know how Dean will respond to something.
Instead, he sits rigidly on the bed while Cas oh-so-gently turns his face this way and that, runs the straight razor confidently across Dean’s skin, and studiously doesn’t make eye contact. He’s not thinking about how good Cas smells, not really, he’s thinking about how much it doesn’t
Donna beams again, which looks natural on her open, pretty face. “Well, don’t you worry. Everything is gonna work out great!”
“I… I panicked. As much as I loved Naomi, Anna and I were… Inseparable. I loved her more than I had ever loved anything. It was my d-duty to p-protect her.” Castiel lets his eyes fall closed and swallows hard. “That night, I took Anna and tried to flee. Naomi caught us easily.
Later that night, Cas is attempting to distract himself from his racing mind by reading. It’s not working, but he’s giving it a shot.
Cas laughs softly at Dean’s almost indignant response. “Of course, as well as a plow for them. But I don’t have seed, and couldn’t afford to purchase any. Even if I could, I don’t have a horse or a mule, and the fields are quite large. I can’t leave Claire alone long enough to tend them properly.” He stands and pulls the blankets back down over Dean’s freshly bandaged leg, then pats his knee over them. “Don’t you worry about us, Dean. I…” he tilts his head with a smile. “I appreciate it, I think. It’s been a very long time since someone has worried about us, but we make do. Another week or two and we’ll be in your dust cloud, I expect.” He smiles down at Dean as he gathers the rest of the supplies and makes his way to the door.
Dean kisses his temple lightly and wraps an arm around Cas’ waist to bring him close. “All right, all right,” he grumbles. “Only for you, gorgeous.”
“You agree to marry me for at least one year. That should be plenty of time for me to secure my position.”
The smile hits Dean square in the chest, and he smiles back, helpless and a little giddy. “I know, but I’m not going to make you put up with me for that long, sweetheart. I’m just… Spreading my wings, maybe. Seeing what fits and what doesn’t.”
Dean gives him what he knows is a dazzling smile. “C’mn, share a milkshake with me, gorgeous. It’ll be like the fifties.”
Claire’s brow wrinkles in concentration. “Papa says I’m too little for more chores. And I shouldn’t feel guilty, because it’s his job as a Papa to take care of everything.”
“When Gabriel became an adult, he asked to be turned. It took me a long time to agree, but Gabriel and Joshua’s faith in me allowed me to change him without harming him permanently. Once he was able to keep himself under control, he left the church to travel. After a time, I did, too. The cloth, Joshua’s life, while it was simple and healing, wasn’t for me.
Dean doesn’t know how he missed the sight of the massive copper tub they keep in the shed for baths. A few wisps of steam are still rising lazily from the water, so Cas must have continually boiled water and added it back into the tub until Dean got home.
Castiel has been saying the same thing for years. Somehow, long enough into their relationship that it was strange but early enough that Dean was still human at the time, Charlie found out that Dean had never expressed his exact sentiments aloud to Castiel. Once she knew, she was like a dog with a bone. She somehow knew that it bothered Castiel, even just the slightest bit, and had been running a campaign to get Castiel to confront Dean about it.
It’s only a day or two before Dean can stand and walk on his own. Cas scolds him if he tries to do more than walk around in his room (“You had a severe infection, Dean, you must let yourself rest.”) and Dean tries not to enjoy it too obviously. From the baleful look Cas gives him, he misses by a mile.
tragedies Castiel has had to face, yessir.” Impala snorts and shakes her head, responding to the irritation in Dean’s words. He struggles to reel himself back in, but everything about Ketch just
The relaxed humor on Dean’s face, along with the easy way he stands in the shop and effortlessly includes Jack in their lunch plans, makes Dean radiant, enthralling. Cas’ poor heart has never beat for someone like it beats for Dean.
with a very bright, very cheap Hawaiian shirt, and even more offensively vibrant sneakers. His only attempt to be in a costume at all is the mask, which remains pushed up on his head.
“Yeah, I bet you are. Love you like this, all desperate for me. Think you can come on my cock, baby?”
Dean has never expected anything like that for himself. He’s seen too many other marriages rot from the inside and fall apart. He doesn’t think the all-encompassing adoration his parents had for one another is in the cards for him.
Castiel is nothing but proper and brisk, though, pulling away the bandage and using a clean cloth to wipe at the wound. The bullet must have hit him at an angle, since there’s a long burn along his thigh where the bullet grazed him before burying itself high in his thigh, just below his joint.
Gabe blinks, then smiles a little and relaxes. Though he’s rather obnoxious and flamboyant, Castiel loves Gabriel like a brother, and he wonders if he should do a better job of showing it.
With a jerk, Castiel is pulled from the nightmare loop he was trapped in. There is a weight pressing down on him, holding him in place. He bucks in vain to get it off until warm hands land on his bare shoulders and Dean comes into focus, hovering over him with worry written plainly on his face. Castiel immediately stills, though his chest is heaving.
“Overwhelming,” Castiel murmurs, a correction as he stares at a tall, square, ugly building just a block or two away. It’s tall enough to be easily identifiable, even if only by the almost equally tall fences that surround it.
“This isn’t about the board anymore.” Dean straightens up, looks down at his father, and sees for the first time that the desk John sits at, the suit he wears, and the job he has is nothing,
“My shop,” Cas breathes, his panic receding as realization washes over him in cold waves. “You vandalized my shop.”
Claire cheers softly and runs to do as she’s told. As soon as she’s out of the room, Dean opens his mouth to say gods know what to Cas. Maybe he wants to apologize? Explain, maybe, that Claire might just be feeling a bit clingy, or that-
Not last night, however. No, last night found him tossing and turning, unable to focus on anything but that single note of anguish and the way it resonated so terribly with something deep within him. Perhaps that’s why he’s here today - he won’t be able to move on until he knows more about whoever is suffering so dearly.
The pup blushes and darts forward to plaster herself against Cas’ leg. She buries her little face in his pant leg and says nothing else.
Dean sits next to Cas and leans into him. Cas lifts his arm to wrap around his boy, pressing a kiss to his temple. Dean is always extra affectionate until he’s had at least a cup of coffee, especially if they’ve been intimate that day. Cas soaks it all in and revels in it eagerly.
After dinner, they continue to move to the couch to watch movies or mindless TV together. The only difference is that now those nights are more apt to end with Cas rocking down on Dean, leaving sucking kisses down the line of his throat and driving Dean wild. The Colonel has stopped trying to sleep next to them on the couch and lies in his dog bed every night with a disgusted huff.
“Then, we come back to Pontiac, use my mother’s influence and money to gently but quite ruthlessly and thoroughly execute a takeover of your parents’ business.”
He’s too tired to really worry, but he does rush to explain, “I don’t expect anything reciprocal, Dean, but I wanted you to know how important you are to me. You’re quite precious, really, and I love-”
“Don’t you worry, she was quite insistent that she get time with her alpha, too. We’ll make sure she gets it, but for now, come with me.”
with all of the trouble they’ve been having with the Lightbringers, who are very much still at large. When the idea of following Sam was presented, Gabe made a lot of noise about how good the food is in college towns. Balthazar ruminated on all of the young, tan,
“I know you weren’t going to steal from me, Dean,” he says finally. “Quite frankly, what would you even steal?”
Dean chuckles, but insists, “C’mon, Cas, there’s gotta be something I can do to lighten the load a little.”
A young Mary Campbell had her first coffee date with John Winchester at the shop that, at the time, just had an orange neon sign over the door that declared “COFFEE.” Mary was rather sentimental, so when the shopping center went up for sale twenty-five years ago, she created a subset of Winchester Motors to help local small business owners and bought it. She signed them in for their current fixed rent rate and put a twenty-five year expiration date on it.
“Outside, behind the bleachers.” Dean cocks an eyebrow and Cas sighs. “I was trying to do Professor Tran a favor.”
He does his best to put aside his brooding tendency for the evening, but in the back of his mind, that silent wail of agony emanating from the asylum plays again and again.
He must not succeed, though, because Claire tilts her head back to look up at him. The crown of her head thunks against his sternum, which is infinitely comforting in a way that he doesn’t want to examine.
Castiel shakes his head. Everyone agreed that he should be the one who did the talking. He’s not sure he agrees with that decision, still, but he abides by it, anyway.
Castiel’s smile is gentle, almost… Sweet. Though the bandage on Dean’s leg is already wrapped, Cas is still stroking over the material slowly, which may or may not be entirely distracting.
it and he never has. The board doesn’t, either, though they would never openly say anything to that effect. Well, maybe that slimy fuck Zachariah would, but Dean doesn’t make a big deal out of his sexuality, so the little weasel has never gotten the chance.
It’s been a stressful week. With Cas’ nightmare recurring early int he week and Dean’s search for a bartender, they both needed some peace today. With the birds singing, the sun highlighting the dark browns and so-black-it’s-almost-blues in Cas’ messy hair, and the three dogs behaving like angels, Dean feels like they’re getting it.
The pup huffs, but leaves without further protest. Cas sets the familiar tray with a bowl, spoon, and plate on the vanity and brings over the bowl of broth with a thick chunk of dark bread.
Charlie is also using her peripherals to watch Jo arrange the bar the way she likes for busy nights like they’re expecting tonight. Charlie and Jo have had a few good nights between them, flaring passion and solid friendship between the sheets. She’s not in love with the fiery blonde or anything, but she’s starting to wonder if Jo wants to get frisky after closing when the corner of her eye catches on something else.
Despite the ease of his kill, his chest heaves in excitement, in the muscle memory of kills before he became immortal, became
Cas frowns down at the cotton swab he’s using to clean Dean’s wound. “There is no wrong or right way to handle this situation, Dean.”
The room is the picture of elegance. Opulence without overcompensation. The walls are a dark, rich red. The wood on the crown molding is dark, too, and polished to gleaming. The tablecloth is pristine, no food would dare stain Naomi Novak’s linens. The wine (one glass is permitted for each child after the age of fifteen) is full-bodied and heavy. The food is magazine-quality, both aesthetically and to taste. The lights are rather low, and candles placed periodically on the table make up for the lack.
There is so much left to concern him. The Lightbringers, though they are without their guiding force, still need to be tracked down and dealt with. Dean, though he has taken to immortality remarkably well, is liable to spiral now that they do not have a set, definable goal to work toward. Castiel, himself, is probably going to need
bit shyer, eyes downcast and fluttering when he looks at them. This man, though, has been making direct eye contact, and what could be perceived as
- I know that it's kind of confusing with Charlie referring to them as Mr. W and Mr. N, but that's how she thinks of them, so... You know. Sorry.
“I just…” The omega shakes his head. “As I said, we have paid for being too trusting before. I cannot let it happen again, no matter if I think you are who you say you are or not.”
Finally, solid ground for Castiel’s overwhelmed mind to stand on. “We need your help,” he tells Lucifer. “I think they’re going to be gathering a show of force. I think having you there to negate what Naomi says will… Lessen the bloodshed.”
She nods and holds it out silently. Mr. W takes it, winks, and makes his way back down the hall to the offices.
There’s not much he can do for the land yet, anyway. He’ll have to go to the city for seed, expertise, and parts for the plow that he’s found need replacing. He’s going to put that particular journey off for as long as possible, really. It’s not that he’s scared that time away will make Cas tell him to hit the road, really, but Dean doesn’t want to spend any more time away from him and Claire than he has to. Especially with her little arm still splinted and his courting of Cas so new.
Everyone likes Nick. He’s friendly, smart, funny, and handsome. He fits in with everyone here, and his first two weeks go by very smoothly. Everyone likes Nick.
“‘Charity suffers long and is kind,” Mr. N says, his eyes glued to Mr. W, “'charity envies not. Charity brags not itself, it is not puffed up.’”
Dean aches to comfort Cas with warm words and gentle touches, but Cas doesn’t respond to anything like a normal person. The implication that he needs gentleness is also, to Cas, an implication that he is weak.
Dean stops his muttering. His head whips up and he stares at Cas, eyes wide, his mouth dropping open just a bit.
Cas stares between the two of them for a beat before sighing. “Cut from the same cloth,” he mutters.
Dean is frequently caught off-guard by Cas’ ethereal beauty, and tonight is no different. The light from the street lamps outside has cast him in warm orange and cool black shadow, highlighting all of his sharp edges.
Cas whispers, eyes darting up to meet Dean’s then down to stare at his chest, “but my bed, and we can-”
Cas is moving around the front counter before he realizes it. “Dean? What’s wrong? What happened? I-”
Dean keeps his hands out to his sides since he hasn’t had the chance to wash up yet. “It’s done,” he croaks. He realizes that he hasn’t spoken out loud in several hours and clears his throat.
Sam looks apologetic as he hovers at the door, phone in hand. “Uh… Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”
His scent, too, must be a mess, because Cas doesn’t hesitate to press even closer. His scent turns soft, soothing, and Dean can’t help but be comforted, no matter that he doesn’t deserve it.
Bela lays a perfectly manicured hand on Dean’s arm to laugh flirtatiously up at him. Even worse when Dean smirks down at her, though Castiel knows the dick only does it to rile him up.
Cas nods, relieved beyond belief that Dean is here, that Dean can take care of things. He leans against his husband’s strength and wonders idly how the hell he’s going to deal with the last fifteen minutes of his life.
Cas hmphs. “Not today, it doesn’t,” he murmurs defiantly as he buries his face in Dean’s chest again.
so when Cas started talking about his lease coming up due, Dean thought nothing of offering the other side of his queen bed. If he had had any reservations, the way Cas’ face lit up and his blue eyes softened would have banished them immediately.
As the silence spins out between them, Castiel sits back on his heels and closes his eyes for a final time. He doesn’t know how he feels. He expected, maybe, to feel lighter, to feel better, but he just feels unmoored without the weight of his secrets, of his shortcomings.
Dean’s heart is thundering away in his chest. There’s so much to parse out. Cas’ seemingly easy acceptance, Cas’ remark about his past, the words “my alpha” on Cas’ lips. There’s just… So much.
Cas watches Dean with a smile as his husband sorts pairs of jeans to go onto a rack, a studious expression on his handsome face. It’s not that serious, really, and mistakes are easily hidden or forgiven, but Dean insists on doing his best work while helping out at the shop. It’s incredibly endearing. With Jack running the register and Benny down the street at Oh, You Betcha on break, Cas has little to do but ogle his husband.
That’s how Cas finds them. Claire is sitting across from Dean, laughing at the funny faces he’s making at her. They both turn to look at the omega when he comes in. He stops in the doorway and stares at them, blinking rapidly but not saying a word for almost a full minute.
When they finally part for more than a moment, Cas whispers, “I want.. I don’t want… Dean, I don’t want to sleep in Claire’s room anymore, but I don’t want you to move to the living room.”
They don’t talk much after that. Cas helps Dean to the chamber pot (which makes the alpha blush, but Cas doesn’t mention that or the scent of embarrassment, so Dean doesn’t, either). He checks the wound on Dean’s leg and declares him improved.
Anna, his assistant, dutifully checks the digital calendar she keeps for him. Anna is a painfully kind, sweet woman who Dean hired mostly to get her out of the sales department, which is a sexist boys’ club at
Castiel finally finds Dean smoking behind the equipment shed. His shoulders are hunched, his face dark, and his eyes are red and wet. His hands tremble minutely when he brings the cigarette to his lips.
- *rolls in a month later with Starbucks* Hi, friends. Real Life has absolutely kicked my ass lately. There's no reason to get into all of it here, but I might bitch about it on Tumblr later. The point is, my bad.
Lucifer winks. “You ever need someone to show you the ropes, I’d be happy to. It’s been a long time since I had a vampire hanging around.”
Dean lets him hide his face in his shoulder until he recovers his composure, but there is no way to hide their besotted smiles for the rest of the night.
“Right,” Gabe says as he flops down into the chair at the other end of the table from Sam. “So now that we know what our next step is… What’s our next step?”
After they clean up, Cas goes into the office to start logging the new inventory. Dean and Kevin work on the schedule or the stage, what nights they’ll have live entertainment and what nights Kevin is available to work. The Colonel lies at their feet, content.  Benny is making the security rounds, keeping an eye on the back alleys and front walkways.
It’s only a moment or two before Dean covers Cas’ mouth with his own, swallowing Cas’ whimpers and cries as they get louder and longer. With one hand he holds himself braced above Cas, and the other he holds Cas’ hip in a firm grip, keeping the omega exactly where he wants him as he pounds into him.
He ends up on a lower level of the asylum, below ground level, certainly. He’s moving slowly, following the agony that brought him here. He feels twitchy, restless. His inner monster doesn’t like being caged underground this way, but as a man, he’s horrified that
Despite his internal reassurances, the wet-dog scent of upset alpha would still be hard to miss when Castiel comes back in. He frowns and tilts his head, squinting at Dean like he’s trying to puzzle him out.
Once he’s far enough away, he starts to dig. He falls into a rhythm that allows him to ignore his burning muscles and he loses time rapidly. Eventually, he realizes that it’s closer to dusk than afternoon and he’ll have to find hand- and footholds to pull himself out of the hole.
“Cas,” he says softly, and the seriousness in his tone has Cas waking up for real and sitting up enough to prop himself on his elbows to hover over Dean. “Cas, sit up for a second. We should… Talk.”
He shudders again when Dean sinks in one last time, as deep as he can go, so deep Cas can feel his cock pulsing as he fills Cas with come. Dean moans, long and loud, and leans his forehead on Cas’ shoulder while he wraps one arm around Cas’ waist to keep him tucked up close.
the kind of alpha that Dean has always despised. Too enamored with the strength and benefits nature gave him to worry about the fact that he did nothing to earn them, has done nothing to prove himself more or less worthy than anyone else.
“She’s quite the well-mannered young lady,” Dean offers with a wink to the pup. It doesn’t get the giggle he wanted, but she graces him with a tiny smile.
John holds up a placating hand. “I know, you’re past all that now. And I’ve done my best to reassure the board that you’ve changed, but they’re not… Convinced,” he finishes lamely.
“It’s your birthday,” a jet engine voice says softly from next to him, interrupting his survey of the room. “Shouldn’t you be out there with your friends?”
Dean is almost painfully grateful, though. His leg still hurts, of course, but it’s obviously been treated and bandaged. He’s hungry and thirsty, but not painfully so, which means whoever is taking care of him has gotten something into his stomach somehow. He feels clean, and his clothes are gone, hopefully either burned or washed thoroughly. He can feel that he still has his smallclothes on, and wonders if his saddlebag survived whatever journey he came through and if the scant clothing he’s wearing is his.
Dean smiles into the darkness as he listens to Chupacabra and Rugaru curl up next to one another on the dog beds in the corner (that won’t last long, the minute Dean falls asleep they’ll be up on the bed next to him). The Colonel, as always, is on the bed next to Cas, already settled in for the night.
“I travelled the world, sometimes with Gabriel, sometimes not. I met Balthazar during…” He frowns. “One of the world wars, anyway, and we became friends. He and Gabriel, I’m sure you can imagine, got on very well immediately. The three of us, we’ve been through much together and apart. Mostly, the last few decades, it’s been apart, unless one of them was in trouble.
moments before Dean follows Cas over the edge. He remembers, barely, to pull out and come across Cas’ softening cock and belly instead of knotting him. A deep, primal part of Dean is going
Dean winks at her. “Good morning, Anna. Mind your damn business, both of you,” he says mildly. “Anything I need to know?”
“What is it?” The most profound emotion is coming from only one person. Castiel can feel it ringing through his bones like a struck tuning fork.
He thinks of his father, as he so often does when he’s in a dilemma. Joshua Novak was a strong, steady man who took a chance on a strange, solemn little boy. Joshua had loved Castiel fiercely and without reserve, and Castiel had loved him back the same way. He thinks he would never have gotten out of the system alive if not for Joshua.
“Charlie said she and Ash are, like, seventy-five percent sure, which is almost a one hundred percent guarantee where those two are concerned,” Dean says easily. “I say we at least talk to the guy, scope him out, and if he’s not who we think he is, we at least have one guy to cross off the list.”
Intent on cheering himself up, he sticks his head out of his office. “Anna, do I have anything pressing to do before lunch?”
the face that Balthazar makes at their “obviously just got out of a shared shower” appearance, but he hears it in the other vampire’s voice.
He sits behind Castiel again, and then a warm, damp cloth is tenderly washing away the sweat on his shoulders, neck, and temples. He feels Dean behind him, all warmth and leashed strength, and Castiel leans back against him shamelessly.
“Dean, I would, in every aspect, like to protect you. If I had my way, you would never face a moment of doubt or danger again. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we live in, and I cannot possibly protect you from everything.
“Of course,” Dean murmurs against his mouth, and then proceeds to chase all thoughts of anything outside of the here and now from Cas’ mind.
When his alarm goes off the next morning, Dean tries to flail his arm over to his nightstand to turn his phone off grumpily, just like he does every morning. When his arm doesn't respond, however, he realizes that just about every single thing about this morning is different than other mornings.
Dean’s breath catches when bright blue eyes meet his. The man is tall and lean, his skin tanned and smooth-looking. He’s dressed simply in dark green breeches, a white shirt, and worn leather boots. There’s the shadow of a beard along his jaw and his dark hair is untamed. His lips are soft and almost made for kissing. A light, sweet scent marks the man who saved Dean as an omega.
Whatever they were like before, they’re perfect now. And they created The Bunker together, which may very well be a nightclub, but it’s also a home. They didn't just create jobs, they created a family.
With a whimper, she throws herself across the room. She clambers up onto the bed and collapses into Dean’s arms. Blindly, she flails behind her so she can get a fistful of Cas’ nightgown and tug him close until she’s squashed between the two of them.
Castiel feels as if he’s been suspended in time, in space - all he can do is stare at the young man, lost in awed indecision.
Watching Cas play with the pup, seeing a little bit of his raising of her and how good he is at it, makes Dean’s scent thick with contentment. From the way Cas meets his eyes and smiles, he can tell that he’s stinking up the place, but he doesn’t try to stop. He
She obeys, and Mr. W’s eyebrows go up when she carefully shuts the door behind her. She sits in the threadbare chair in front of the big desk, nervous but determined.
“You’re welcome to stay here while you recover, though I do believe it will be a while before you’re on your feet again. Your horse, too, can remain, though I daresay she’s more than capable of caring for herself.”
With a deep growl, Cas surges forward until he blankets Dean’s body with his own. At the same time, he pushes a third lubed finger into the boy. Dean chokes on his next inhale, shuddering in Cas’ iron hold.
Dean, at that point, had been studying Cas for a long, long time. He knew, then, a lot of the ins and outs of how Castiel thought. He knows the more now, of course, has travelled them many a time at Cas’ side, but then, he knew enough to realize a few things.
“I don’t… Dean, I still don’t think I spoke in haste, but…” Cas sighs, and tension seems to drain from him along with the gust of air from his lungs. “But okay. Yes. You can stay. For a while.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Regardless. Naomi was, and is still, apparently, quite unbalanced. The First is a fairy tale that vampires tell one another to assure themselves that we had a purpose, that we weren’t just created to be… Evil. To be predators. I don’t know why she’s still searching for the First, or why she ever started to, but she’s not in her right mind.”
Dean is still a little rough around the edges. He’s open about the fact that he was a scrapper when he met Cas, getting into fights almost every night, reopening the wounds on his knuckles before they ever really healed. He says he was too much, too directionless before he met Cas.
“Yeah,” he rasps, smiling so wide his cheeks ache. He nuzzles into the palm of Cas’ hand. “Yeah, that’s all right with me, sweetheart.”
be submissive, and he certainly has never thought so with the way his mother raised him, but they’re usually a
like this to yourself,” he says as he tugs at Impala’s reins. “Wouldn’t want anyone to get the idea that you’re picking and choosing which citizens of this fine township you’re here to protect.”
He thinks it has much more to do with the hissed gossip and not-quite-whispers of Cas’ name that follow him wherever he and Impala go, though.
“We had a… Trying day yesterday,” Cas says with a grateful smile to her. “We ended up home late and slept in, too. We decided to take the day off for personal reasons.”
Upon an explanation, Bobby rolled his eyes and told Sam to suck it up. Not that he didn’t have cause to be upset and scared, but if he was going to be mad at Dean, he would have to become angry with Bobby himself, too. When faced with that prospect, Sam instead calmed down, let go of his anger, and insisted he be allowed to help with the Lightbringer research.
Dean likes to think he’s a pretty laid-back boss. He’s not strict about start times, and he frequently lets the crew go home early if it’s a slow night. There’s no dress code. He doesn’t mind Bal cooking dinner for the crew if he has time. He’s generous with time off, or at least he tries to be.
Cas orders a few sandwiches to be delivered from a local sub shop while the others start to set up the bar. It’s still a few hours early, but they can pull stools off of the tables and roll any extra silverware they anticipate needing. Cas insists they all sit at a table and eat. Again, no one argues.
Cas sits up a bit and smiles, because this is his next favorite part of the plan (second only to Dean).
Dazed, he watches as Cas straddles him again and reaches behind himself to sink his fingers back into his hole. Dean finds the energy to wrap his own fingers around Cas’ cock and relishes the moan it gets him.
Dean is tense at his side, fingers tapping against the side of his leg. Castiel puts a hand on the small of Dean’s back, rubbing soothing circles there until Dean relaxes minutely.
Dean leans forward to rest his head on their clasped hands. “Goddammit,” he rasps. “Cas, I don’t know what to do.”
Dean doesn’t need to hear any more. With a growl, he rolls them so Cas is on his back, his legs spread sweetly for Dean as he grinds down on his omega like he’s been dreaming about doing for
Castiel knows, though. He has seen past the (admittedly, rather lovely) mask and into the vulnerable, beautiful soul beneath.
The idea hits Dean like lightning. It’s the perfect solution to his problems, practically gift-wrapped for him.
“Anna,” Dean says, frowning. “I don’t have anything lined up. I’ll do what I can for you, of course, but I-”
know is that the boy on the bed in there might be one of the most powerful empaths Castiel has ever encountered. While it’s not a particularly useful talent, he wouldn’t be surprised if the boy was also a telepath. The power, though passive and unable to be wielded in any way, is just oozing from him. It’s no wonder he’s here, humans wouldn’t have the ability to label him as he is, and even less ability to actually help him. Not that there’s much help to be had. Some meditation, some guidance in sorting one’s own thoughts from the din of anyone else’s. Maybe if an empath is powerful enough, they benefit from having something around to siphon off the massive amounts of emotions they’re constantly being bombarded with, take the edge off of all that psychic energy.
sensation of relief. He’s able to sort those out rather immediately and put them aside - whoever he’s here for certainly isn’t feeling any of those things.
They’re both half hard and Dean closely considers the idea of rocking down against Cas, of starting something fast and hard for the morning, of making up for all of the time they’ve lost not talking to each other. Before he can act on the impulse, they’re interrupted by three sharp, short barks from the door.
Everyone stands and puts their chairs in stacks against one wall of the little coffee shop as they chat amiably. Cas lets the sound wash over him and soothe some of his uncharacteristic anxiety.
“Good morning, Dean.” Cas’ voice rumbles through his chest and right into Dean’s, soothing the unsettled feeling that’s always there when he wakes up alone.
The ride is silent, save for the rock music coming from Baby’s speakers. Dean sings along softly, and Castiel finds it in himself to hum with the music after a while. His body gets looser as more scenery goes by, and his mind begins to relax a bit. Driving with Dean is familiar, known, and it’s hard to stay worried and alert when he’s in a scenario in which they’ve always been safe.
Dean manages to generate enough paperwork to keep them both busy, but he thinks Anna’s wise to his scheme. Either she’s grateful to not be harassed every day, or she’s too nice to call him out.
Castiel gratefully lets their previous conversation drift away. He won’t be able to avoid it forever, but he at least won’t have to have it tonight.
Charlie looks up again, watching them twirl around the dance floor. Mr. W effortlessly spins Mr. N, and for a moment, Charlie sees them as they were when they were younger. They’re not
Cas scowls. Dean knows very well how Castiel feels about the kind of strange shuffling that passes for dancing at high school formals. The Novaks, of course, have all taken extensive ballroom dancing lessons, but Cas is quite sure that’s not what Dean means.
“I suspect you’ll be fine,” Cas says, pretty eyes twinkling. “Now, stop with your complaints and eat your breakfast. I, too, have chores to complete.”
Castiel is well aware of the effect Dean has on others, though. It’s not the first time someone has been taken in by Dean’s green eyes or his dazzling smile. Castiel isn’t truly worried, because, after all this time, he knows that Dean will never waver. The bond they have is profound, unshakable. It’s not the first time something like this has happened, and he is not worried. It’s not even the first time someone has questioned their compatibility.
Finally, Dean comes back to himself, straightens, and crawls off the bed with a soft command to Cas to stay where he is. He does so, and moments later, Dean comes back with a warm washcloth. He cleans both of them of come and lube, presses a gentle kiss to Cas’ hip bone, and tosses the cloth into the hamper.
Cas smiles, almost dizzy with relief. Then, because he knows how hard this is for Dean, “Thank you.”
Cas is a study in contradictions in every aspect of their entwined lives. Normally, he wants rigid control over both of them. In bed, though, he gives it up, lets Dean tell him what to do and what to say and when to come It’s mind-blowingly hot, really.
Dean is surprised by the pang of hurt in his chest. Castiel has no reason to trust him, especially with his pup, but it stings nonetheless. Not just because his inner alpha is upset at the implication that he’d hurt the most vulnerable of the pack
Before he can move away, she surges up toward him and throws her arms around his neck. Her splint hits him on the back of the head, but he barely notices because she also presses a wet, clumsy kiss to his cheek.
The music and the background singers start to fade, and the men slowly spin to a stop, just holding one another close and pressing their foreheads together. It’s the goddamn cutest, gayest thing Charlie has ever seen in her
It’s too dark to tell if Cas is blushing, but Dean is a betting man, and he thinks his omega’s cheeks are a rosy color right now. It’s driving his inner alpha wild.
Cas looks him dead in the eye. “Azazel and his shitty little gang. Talley did most of the damage.” He indicates the eye he’s covered with the ice pack again.
“Why, so you can keep hiding things from me?” Dean shakes his head. “You may not be comfortable talking to me about some stuff, Cas, but you can’t keep me out of Lightbringer business.” With that, Dean gets out of the car.
When he’s given nothing but silence in response to his query, a bud of worry comes to life in Cas’ chest. He stands, placing the books aside, and goes to the front.
“I’ll have to find a way to thank you,” Dean purrs right up against Castiel’s ear. He shudders, and his pants are suddenly a bit tighter.
Dean smiles and reaches across his desk to shake Nick’s hand. “I think you’ll fit in here just fine.”
Castiel smiles and wraps his arms around Dean’s waist, savoring the automatic way Dean leans into him. “When did you become so level-headed and reasonable?”
Once he drops Michael’s body in, filling the hole goes much faster than digging it did. Once the soil has been replaced, Dean carefully tamps it until it’s level with the surrounding area, then spreads loose rocks, sticks, and leaves over the unmarked grave obsessively until it’s indistinguishable. Only once he’s satisfied that it will be nigh impossible for the body to be found does he settle a little ways away to eat the light meal Cas packed him to take today. His canteen is half empty, too, but he’s not worried.
“Impala is her name?” The omega smiles, just a quirk of the corner of his mouth. “Fitting, I think, to name her after an animal with no master.”
The omega raises a dark eyebrow in doubt, but he places the cup back on the tray before coming back to sit next to Dean on the bed.
Dean shrugs, and Castiel doesn't believe the nonchalance for a moment. They don't look at one another, still pressed cheek to cheek, still swaying slowly to the music.
Dean has to fall back on the training he got from his mother and father to heed Cas’ advice, but heed it he does. Any time he hears Cas’ name spoken loud enough for him to hear on horseback, he cocks an eyebrow but doesn’t make more of a fuss than that. He ignores the muttered accusations he hears and rides straight down the main road like he owns the whole damn town.
Gabe rolls his eyes. “Shut up,” he says fondly, and Castiel knows that he’s been forgiven. “C’mon, if we take a left down there we’ll walk by the asylum. Air’s bound to be soaked.”
Today, though, he joins her on her never-ending quest for flowers. He sticks with just flowers for his, but he picks quite a few of them, cutting the stems with a small pocketknife and making sure to gather enough to make two bundles.
As Claire hops down from the table and hurries to follow the request, Dean cocks an eyebrow. “What’s goin’ on, Cas?”
Castiel hasn’t taken his eyes off of Gabriel, who he’s sure would have gone quite pale by now were he possessed of any blood that might drain from his face. “She’s a… Terrible creature.”
The bell dings and, sure enough, it’s not a customer who walks through the door. It’s Dean, followed by Benny and Dean’s secretary, Anna. Cas makes the briefest note of the other two people before the haggard look on Dean’s face catches his attention. That, along with the fact that Dean isn’t scolding him about Jack not being in sight (he’s in the back), consumes him with worry.
“My ass,” Dean grumbles. “Look, I know it, and so does everyone who matters. Just because you’re weird doesn’t mean anything.” He reaches across the bench seat to tangle their fingers together. “You’re still the best person I know, baby, and the best thing that ever happened to me. No matter what anyone says.”
It’s not easy to keep his hands to himself, to keep the kisses he and Cas share short and sweet, but he does it. Mostly because he wants Cas to be in control, to lead the way for every step they take together.
and if he doesn’t think Anna sees the way he looks at her when he thinks she doesn’t notice, he has another thing coming.
The words burrow themselves deep into Dean’s heart, where they’ll stay forever, protected by his ribs and keeping his heart beating steadily for the omega beneath him. He kisses Cas hard, fiercely, and he slowly sinks into him.
And Cas discovers that he would forsake anyone, anyone at all, to take the terrible desperation out of Dean’s voice.
Dean plans one hand on the wall next to Cas’ head and looms close. Cas’ breath catches, almost unnoticeable. Then again, there’s not much Dean doesn’t notice about Cas.
“I should think so. You had quite wound, and I do believe a rather nasty infection when you rode up.”
It’s not that he’s whipped, per se (cue Sam’s obnoxious moose-snort, the traitorous dick) (and for that matter, cue Cas’ lecture about the patriarchy and all the sexist overtones of the term “whipped"), but it’s that Cas asks for so
Cas doesn’t believe that off-leash dog parks are safe, and Dean agrees, so they end up going to a pretty popular walking trail. The day is brisk but sunny, the feeling of spring finally waking up the world around them. The dogs all walk easily side-by-side, and Dean holds Cas’ hand because he knows Cas likes it as they walk.
“I think the multi-million dollar church, the BMWs, the eight-bedroom house, and the undoubtedly unfaithful marriage have probably done that for me.”
When met with her wide-eyed stares, she just shrugged. “What? Like I wouldn’t investigate the dude bangin’ my bestie?”
This is the opposite of a problem for Dean, except that he wishes Cas didn’t feel so on edge all the time.
He opens his eyes to stare into Dean’s green gaze, maybe for the last time, and he waits for Dean’s reaction. Waits for Dean to yell, scream, rail at him. Waits for Dean to call him a coward, a weakling, the worst kind of traitor. Waits for Dean to shout at him to go, to never come back.
it appears that it’s what Cas wanted, too. At no point the night before did Dean see anything but a desperate, burning eagerness in his husband. Every touch was exquisite, tender,
Cas’ eyes sweep across the house, and his eyebrows climb to his forehead steadily. That shocked blue gaze takes in the tidied kitchen living room, and dining area, takes in the neatened piles of laundry, Claire’s dolls and their dresses (all handmade) put away, and the swept fireplace. Cas’ eyes finally land back on Dean and Claire, sitting at the table with a third plate next to Claire, complete with Cas’ own sandwich.
He is, however, ready to hear this. “After I get my bachelor’s degree,” and, oh dear, there’s a bit of a wobble in Cas’ voice now, “you and I will be married. Your parents will attend, mine will not. Sam and Anna will stand with us. It will be a small, intimate ceremony in a park of your choosing.”
He pulls himself back with an effort. Cas looks flushed and sated, looking up at Dean through heavily lidded eyes with a soft smile on his face and making no effort to move at all. Dean is helpless to do anything but lean down to nuzzle at him, scentmarking him even more and kissing all across his cheeks, the bridge of his nose, and finally down this mouth.
then I want you here. Maybe not as…” he touches his neck where the neckline of his gown reveals the vicious scarring leftover from Michael’s failed attempts at mating. “I don’t know if I’m ever going to be ready to mate again, Dean, but I want you here with us. With
when I realized you were with him, and I must have blacked out, because the next thing I remember is-”
He never got to meet her, but his father spoke fondly of her. Of course, Joshua spoke fondly of most everyone he met, so that maybe wasn’t indicative of much. The contract she put together, however,
“-won’t, of course, fix things, but over time, once you’ve gotten this taken care of, I really think-”
The warehouse is generously named as such. It’s more aptly described as an enormous shed, really. Castiel has no idea what its original purpose was, but there is only one giant room. There are no offices and no second floor. Just one room, metal walls, and a rusting tin roof.
Castiel nods slowly, trying to think through the frankly absurd circumstances he finds himself in. His brain feels like molasses, thick and slow. “And what would being ‘married’ entail, precisely?”
“Yeah, you were kinda flailing around,” Dean says with a teasing smile as he climbs off of Castiel and lies back down at his side, head propped up on his hand.
Gabe’s eyes are sparkling even as they roll in his head. “As much fun as it would be to watch you two break some laws, and it
His opportunity comes when a small wild goose is caught in one of the traps. It’s big enough to feed the three of them generously, but not unmanageably huge. HE makes sure it’s a clean kill, then takes extra care when plucking and preparing it for cooking.
The man is almost of a height with Dean and has a bland face, and there’s a silver sheriff’s badge pinned to his shirt. The horse tied to the post next to Impala, presumably this man’s, is a bit older, but well taken care of for all that.
The people here are dressed to the nines, which kind of freaks Dean out. He ditched the leather jacket and is wearing a dark button-down and a pair of dark-wash jeans that only have a hole in one knee, so he got a little gussied up, but he’s seeing evening dresses, for God’s sake.
“What is it?” Cas whispers back. His hand is on Dean’s side, cradling his ribs. Dean finds the touch ridiculously comforting.
Cas goes easily when Dean pushes him into bed, then lets Dean arrange them to his liking. Cas ends up on his back and Dean flops down hard enough to draw an “oomph” from him. He rests his head on Cas’ shoulder almost defiantly before pulling the blankets up over them, grumbling the whole time.
Claire looks up at him again, her icy blue eyes imploring and sad. “You’re not just pretending to be nice, right, Dean?”
That night, while Cas is gently rubbing salve on Dean’s wounded leg with hands that somehow manage to be calloused and soft at the same time, Dean can’t hold his tongue any longer.
When Cas brings supper that night, it’s clear that he doesn’t want to talk. He sets the tray down with the bowl of stew and hunk of bread next to Dean and straightens, obviously about to walk back out without saying a word.
The Lightbringers are dangerous and should take priority over Castiel’s inability to communicate with the people around him.
“Like I went three rounds with a bear,” Dean croaks, his voice rough with sickness. He frowns a little. “What’re you doin’ here, Cas?” He starts to pull away, weak though he is. “Gon’ get you sick.”
He’s helping Cas sort through last week’s donations, a practiced hand now at eyeballing what’s what quickly and efficiently, when he tells Cas as much.
“Come now, dearheart, come back to me. That’s it, you’re doing so well, love. Come back to me, Dean.”
“Cas, look, I… I know this isn’t what you agreed to. And that’s okay, I didn’t know that- wait, no, that doesn’t matter. This isn’t what you agreed to, and I don’t want you to feel…
Before he can think much more on it, Dean is tugging him around to look at him properly. The frown doesn’t mar his handsome features, but makes them more intense, serious, masculine.
“Hello, pup,” he rasps, smiling. She doesn’t make a sound, so he tries again. “My name is Dean. What’s yours, darlin’?”
Their group has taken over 3 of the booths in the back of the restaurant. Benny’s dad doesn’t mind, he says it keeps them out of trouble. Dean loves it here, at the center of the action with Cas, it makes him feel like a king.
“I think he’s telling the truth,” Cas says, pulling Dean’s bleeding right hand into his lap and opening the first aid kit. “He knows your father, at least well enough to not like him. He seems quite earnest.”
And so Dean and Cas became Dean-n-Cas, a whole unit, rarely apart. Dean became a fixture at the diner, Cas became a fixture at the end of the bar. They bought clothes and dishes together, Cas researched better quality dog food for The Colonel, and Dean discovered that Cas can’t cook worth a damn.
Cas comes back in after checking on the cow and Impala for the last time before bed. Dean tries to hide the fact that his inner alpha is perking up happily and drops his hand away from his face. Apparently, however, he’s not fast enough.
Which is how she finds herself knocking on the office door when she knows Mr. N is out front and it’s just Mr. W in there.
Dean thinks for a beat, then shrugs. “Point.” He examines his younger brother with a frown. “Coffee?”
But creatures who are as good, as good as Castiel would like to believe himself to be, do not need control. They do not need as many rules or boundaries as Castiel has laid upon himself. They are good by instinct, reflex.
As if everywhere they walk isn’t saturated with fear, elation, and childlike joy. Humans from barely old enough to walk up to teenagers and young adults are running around in costumes, flashing in and out of the spheres of light provided from street lamps like apparitions. Only major holidays make emotions so thick in the air - it’s enough to make a vampire dizzy and giddy, much like Gabriel is.
Unfortunately for Michael, Castiel has a trigonometry test to study for, and he’s agreed to proofread one of Dean’s essays for him. He quite literally doesn’t have time for Michael’s bigotry.
Head Nurse Moseley - Dean is very sweet when he’s present with us. It is my opinion that he does not belong in so harsh a facility. No family visits since his tenth birthday.
life in his arms, Castiel can do little but laugh, and be grateful that he had the foresight to take that invitation offered to him by a rug so long ago.
The door opens to reveal Claire in her nightgown, a miniature of Cas’ own, her hair a wild cloud around her tear-streaked face. Arousal has never fled Dean so quickly.
It’s Dean’s turn to scowl. The man is an alpha, and the blatant challenge to his attack is going to pis him off something fierce. There’s no guarantee that he’ll chase Dean now, injured or no.
of therapy (Charlie’s turn of phrase, and quite accurate). Will Lucifer go back to Las Vegas, and will Balthazar follow? Hell, will
They hit the grocery store before lunch. Cas decides that he feels well enough to leave The Colonel at home, but he sticks real close to Dean as they navigate the aisles.
Cas is mumbling softly against his shoulder and Dean takes the opportunity to lift his head to blink blearily at the alarm clock. As soon as the numbers register, he stiffens in surprise.
He’s still reeling from the meeting with his father. The whole thing feels surreal, like a vivid dream (or nightmare). And he knows that he’s also struggling with the idea of John
Cas has foregone the pants in deference to the weather warming up, but he’s still wearing his long-sleeved tee when he crawls into bed next to Dean. When Cas is tired, he’s not subtle about cuddling, so he drops onto Dean like dead weight and pushes and pokes him until he’s right where Cas wants him. Dean ends up on his back with Cas’ arm thrown over his chest and Cas’ face mashed into his shoulder.
Anyone with two mating marks is bound to be sore on the subject, and hadn’t he already thought about how Cas doesn’t smell mated?
There’s an awkward beat of silence that Cas genuinely doesn’t know how to break. What Dean is suggesting is outrageous, insane, and borderline offensive. If it wasn’t for the earnestness with which he insisted that they’ll both get something out of it, Cas might even accuse Dean of outright manipulation.
When Mary asks Castiel to call her by her first name, John knows that his wife approves of their son’s boyfriend. Which is nice, because John does, too.
The omega shakes his head. “You were quite delirious when you came, I’m not surprised that you don’t remember. I don’t know where you rode in from, of course, but I was working out in the garden when your horse rode up. She was, ah, rather insistent that someone take a look at you.”
They follow her around the building to a second door. In letters four feet high along the path, the word ARBORETUM is displayed and lit up with minuscule spotlights as they walk. The foliage is thick, beautiful, a testament to the skill required to cultivate it. There’s another set of glass doors at the end of the path, and halfway to them, the scent of blood starts to fill Cas’ nose.
Dean snorts a little, and though the sound is rude in the silence, Castiel agrees. Naomi can hardly be considered “young,” although, from the First’s perspective, he supposes they’re all just babies.
The night Meg came back into town, too thin and too pale to be healthy, and asked for help is mostly a blur for Cas. He remembers overwhelming fear, love, and concern for his friend, and he didn’t hesitate for even a minute before deciding that she would stay there with him so he could keep an eye on her. Letting Meg stay there meant letting her boyfriend stay, too, but that was certainly no hardship - anyone who was there for Meg was someone Cas could get along with.
Charlie is like the gay sister she didn’t know she needed. There have been many a night when Charlie has shown up, intuitively understanding that Anna shouldn’t be alone, loaded down with movies, popcorn, and ice cream. They crash on Anna’s living room floor and carpool to work the next morning.
Castiel doesn’t remember when they met, but he remembers the magnetism was irresistible right from the beginning. He can’t really pinpoint the day they went from “Dean” and “Castiel” to “Dean and Cas,” just that it’s perfectly natural to have Dean’s arm flung in a seemingly careless manner around his shoulders as they walk down the halls.
Cas was happy being the assistant manager of the little diner he worked at when they met. He was happy with his messy studio apartment, covered in books and (mostly) clean clothes. He was just fine.
Dean scowls, but there’s no heat in it. “You know what I mean. I just… What the fuck am I supposed to do here, Cas? I didn’t ask for this.”
It’s just he and Dean when they leave. Sam has class the next day and Dean refused to let him miss, but Castiel refused to let him be unprotected. He bribed Gabe and Balthazar with promises of frequent updates (and, to Gabriel, a promise that he would be all right) to stay behind.
With that, Castiel leaves the bedroom, never looking back at Dean to see how his words were received.
“The fact that frightening humans has never lost its shine for you tells me precisely how good you think it is,” he says dryly.
personality, that one, but she’s been behaving quite well. Your tack and saddle has also been cleaned properly, and is out in the barn for you.” He stands and goes to the vanity, removes the cover from the dish there, and brings back a bowl of broth and a spoon. He sits and looks Dean in the eye again.
of Dean fucking Winchester. It drives him crazy, makes his skin feel too tight and twitchy. He wants to inhale Dean, to absorb him to get close enough that they’re so entangled that they’re basically one person.
For all that Castiel has dealt with their attraction by ruthlessly trying to control both himself and Dean, Dean has just
Dean insists that Cas let him do the dishes, so he’s treated to the way Cas gets done with the day’s work even earlier than he has been and gets down on the ground to play with Claire.
There are so many things Dean wants to help Cas shoulder. Running the farm, living so close to a town that has ironclad negative opinions about them, raising Claire. This one, though, Michael’s demise and his final resting place, is one thing that Dean will take completely from his omega and carry on his own. Dean’s not so unused to the darker side of life, and he’ll gladly take this burden (light as it is, really) for Cas.
He would lie, but he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to get another untruth by Dean tonight without a fight. “It… Has been a very long time since I lost someone important to me. I fear that not only does it not get easier, but the shock may in fact be more difficult to bear when it’s cushioned by a century without loss.”
Lucifer’s husky voice is earnest, eager as he waves for them to sit at the meeting table in the middle of the room. They do so warily, all of them on one side and Lucifer on the other.
He’s never gotten that impression, however. All Cas’ scent has ever revealed to him is a sort of bashful, confused pleasure.  That’s quite enough for Dean.
“Well, our alpha just told me that he's going to stay with us forever,” Cas says, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He’s whispering to the pup, but his eyes are just for Dean.
When he finally turns to let his eyes fall upon Dean, his boyfriend is sitting on his own side of the bed, head in his hands, elbows resting on his thighs. Frustration, anger, and sadness are written in every line of his lovely body.
However she did it, she must have made them seem important enough for Lucifer himself to meet with (words Castiel genuinely never thought he’d have a use for) them as soon as they’re settled in their rooms.
Everyone is shaking their heads and murmuring, but it’s Gabe who’s looking right at Cas, gaze softened where it’s normally hard and mischievous. “You did great, Cassie. There’s no reason for them not to sign.”
It takes them both a very long time to fall asleep, but the new silence is easy, comfortable. Cas runs fingers through the silky hair at the base of Dean’s skull, and Dean occasionally turns his head to brush a kiss against Cas’ chest.
