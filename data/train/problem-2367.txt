Dean shook his head looking away from him, not liking being locked between cas and the lockers, he felt a hand on his jaw painfully gripping it and pulling him to look straight into the others blue eyes
everyone saw his belly button pierced and they all commented that they liked it and that it looks good on him and that it wasn’t girly and dean would look good in anything
"Dean c'mon" sam said tugging on his brothers arm pulling him outside so they could start walking to school, dean sighed and started walking with him, he mentally kicked himself for even being scared of talking to sam but every time he tried nothing would come out
then he started sneaking out at night from his bedroom window and going out and causing problems down at skate parks, such as sneaking in after curfew and the park would be closed and then making sure to blast music and make sure to be reckless while skating making sure he would get reported and the cops would come around
benny had told him he’s not a fan of it so dean was gonna make sure benny didn’t taste the smoke that lingered in his mouth, he wiped his mouth with a towel and went downstairs almost tripping on his way there, he hasn’t been fucked in about a week and a half mostly due to being grounded for like the millionth time
“come on, pretty boy” cas said, climbing out of the car pretty fast after parking it on the side of the side near some random forest and road that was way to quiet, but huh
it wasn’t horrible and that was the only way they agreed for him to have the cat, he walked into the kitchen and ate breakfast with the others, helping jack get himself a plate since he was still new and didn’t know things as well as the others
cas felt more fear coming over his body, cas nodded desperately, he would do everything for the brothers and he did not want this happening to sam so if it was out of the two he wanted it to be him, it would even help dean when he was cured that he didn’t have to live with the quilt of his demon side hurting sam
“okay, alright dean..but i can’t promise to keep my hands to myself” cas replied, hands already sliding down from dean’s shoulders and to his ribs avoiding the bruise “who did this to you” cas asked quietly
after a awhile the four of them finishes walking around the school after pointing out certain important places to go and not to go, their was the weird kid corner that cas has remarked that dean would fit in there, sam clenched his fists at that but he wasn't gonna start a fight he probably wouldn't even win honestly
sam had to hold back rolling his eyes, he was afraid he would actually end up hurting his eyes with how much he’s rolled his eyes in the past 2 hours
dean pushes past all the resistance he was given and grunted at the feeling of the ex angel but quickly felt the resistance at the end “oh your poor baby, your bladders full isn’t it?” dean teased
Cas looked over deans schedule "well call you lucky dean-o, you have most of your classes with me except p.e cause i don't go to that class" he shoved the schedule back in deans hands well most like at his chest but dean quickly put his hand up to grab the schedule before it fell
“well that was fun, angel..or well, yk what i mean” dean smirked and pulled away shoving himself back into his jeans, suddenly the door shoved open and a devil trap bullet went into deans leg and dean howled and growled loudly, his powers releasing cas and cas just slumped against the bed in his own mess
it was a sloppy kiss but he didn’t care, dean lost the battle against benny’s tongue letting benny explore his mouth, benny explored every part of dean’s mouth until dean had to pull away for breath, letting out pretty little whines as what benny would call it
“don’t worry cas, just next time not so tight” dean smiled at the other boys flushed face, cas quickly nodded but then remembered “shit were supposed to be in class” cas grabbed deans wrist and pulled him to their class which they had together because most of their classes they had together
‘no wonder you like yellow, next thing you know your gonna be saying your favorite food is honey’ dean joked slightly, which is a sign to trust, cas noted
braiden took him back into his mouth and hallows his cheeks causing suction and gives it all he’s got and jack can’t hold it back anymore and releases thick ropes of cum into braiden’s mouth and braiden just swallows all of it
cas was walking to his class, un focused on where he was walking and ran into a smaller body and the other person fell “oh my god, i am so sor- dean?” cas said looking down at the green eyed boy who was looking up at him
“i told everyone this morning that i would be back early today dean, not late” cas said sternly then shifted his eyes to benny who was just sitting there awkward “leave” cas said, eyes stone cold and cas couldn’t help it, he felt like someone was sitting on his chest, it took him a couple minutes that he was jealous
"uh, that might be a problem miss..." sam said lowly "dean doesn't exactly...talk, he only listens to things i say, i was hoping i could be with him" dean flinched visibly hating that he has to put all this on his brother
braiden leaned over sitting up on his elbow and soon enough braiden smashed his lips onto jack’s and jack gasped at the sudden action but gripped the hair on the back of braiden’s head and pulled him closer
“yep” braiden said now leaning against the car next to him, he continued “so who’s the new guy you came in with?” cas simply looked at him then breathed in new thing of smoke before letting it out “he’s my new adopted brother- niece, i don’t know to call him, basically lucifer is in charge of him”
charlie got to the house and pretty fast and gave everyone a crown and then benny came in right on time and brought some bourbon and saw sam light up at that and sighed “sam only tonight your allowed to have some, only tonight” dean ordered not pleased with sam drinking but if dean was gonna drink then sam should also
"i will get you to talk, dean winchester..maybe not today, or for week or month, but i am not gonna give up" he said, the other quickly un gripped deans jaw from his grip after seeing some sort of fear in deans eyes and back away
sam got home pretty fast, first thing he saw while walking up to the house was his dad walking out of the house, knuckles bloody and a beer in hand storming to car then driving off like a mad man
cas parked in their normal spot and looked at jack who he allowed in the front seat due to gabes behavior this morning he booted him to the back “alright jack, first day is always scary...but i won’t let anyone hurt you so have some fun and don’t listen to any bullies alright?” cas sighed
"i'm not the nicest person you probably wanna hang around with, but i can protect you from others from completely harassing you, will you let me? nod for me if it's okay" cas was wondering why he's being so nice to this kid all the sudden but when he saw the fear in his eyes, it felt like something tugged on his heart
sam quickly followed upstairs into his own room and pulling on some jeans and a plain white shirt and grabbed a red and black flannel pulling it on, he grabbed his backpack and brushed down his hair
“oh that sucks little angel” dean grinned evilly and started pounding into the tight hole, deans tip started slamming against cas’ bladder from the inside, making the ache more intense
i am so sorry for taking so long to update this, i just started watching walker and i am already attached to the friendship between cordell and micki
cas felt his jaw stretching wider, aching more now and due to the lack of air he was getting he started getting light headed and he started to drift but then the stretch in his mouth was gone and deans wet and flushed was cock was now standing up tall in front of his face
“alright sam, hopefully your hair doesn’t just magically disappear in your sleep though..” dean grinned lightly, still a bit shy “no, must protect moose’s hair at all costs!” gabe gasped, sam smirked lightly and said “see dean, people like my hair long”
dean gasped and immediately held onto the arm of the couch and cas’ wrist with the other, cas grunted and couldn’t help himself and immediately went to the brutal pace he was holding back for a second and dean’s body jerked up with every thrust in and dean was moaning and held his back arched with cas’ cock jackhammering into his prostate
dean smiled a bit knowing how it usually is in the morning with the need to go to the bathroom, after hearing the faucet to the sink turn off sam came out of the bathroom and grabbed some food for himself and ate it a bit
”whatever, bitch” dean blurted out the last part, he didn’t know what caused it but he just had the urge to “jerk” sam simply responded
cas and dean hangout and get to know each other more, gabe annoys sam all day, dean ditches the whole day with cas and gets in trouble for it, dean lets sam help him
“just got a piercing kit and watched a vid on youtube, not that hard” cas shrugged then rolled his eyes at the other “cmon don’t sit on the edge of the bed, it’s more comfortable up here” cas patted the empty spot next to him
Cas noticed his reaction, being able to read him pretty easily “i don’t expect anything, honestly i think it’s pretty cool having a friend that i can talk to that well won’t verbally judge me” cas sighed
gabe just glared even harder “i just came to tell you that sam and dean are here..dick” he muttered before grabbing sam’s wrist and pulling him off to his own room, with sam reluctantly following behind
there were others but dean couldn't really get to see them cause cas was dragging him by the collar of his shirt leaving sam and gabe talking to the others in the group, dean frowned mentally, confused
dean smiled at him and grinned widely “hm who knew you were such a rebellion” he joked, and cas just chuckled and lent down to give dean a quick kiss “so how do you wanna do this?” he asked
lucifer mumbled something incoherent, after grabbing micheal by his jacket and pulling him out to his car and drove to work way faster then needed
“dean, that’s a good back up plan but i will go with you, i have the money” cas said and slightly moved closer to dean and put a hand on deans cheek and rubbed his thumb on deans cheekbone
Cas was surprisingly able to catch up to his brother and tackled him to the floor, immediately both brothers started wrestling aggressively, mostly because of cas but gabe was getting just as aggressive
Gabe went off after a bit after finding his group, that was including a girl with red hair and guy with an accent, dean held back a smile as the guy with the accent greeted him and shook his hand but didn't push for an reply back
the end of school came faster than sam thought, sam didn’t see dean all day and was hoping he wasn’t wrong about thinking dean already walked home and is alright
“but i’m bored” gabe pouted lightly and his knee kept jumping up and down, sam wondered if gabe had adhd or was just hyper active, gabe started leaning in his chair “gabriel novak” the teacher growled, leaning back in your chair was banned in her class and he knew that but he just didn’t care
one day he'll have the courage for dean, to somehow get help, they just moved so much he couldn't, sometimes sam wished dean wasn't so damn shy to stand up to their father but he couldn't blame him
cas moved his hands to deans ass and picked him up, on instinct dean squeaked (which dean will never admit he did)  and wrapped his legs around cas’ waist, their lips met and it was surprising sweet for the first couple seconds till dean deepened it by tilting his head and parting his lips in invitation
“aw, what’s wrong angel?” dean smirked “don’t have to be scared, we’re just gonna have a little fun, that’s all..if you cooperate this will go by quickly, well..just relax and let me do what i want” dean said, trailing his fingers down cas bare chest
“oh i know, now your gonna get me all wet so i can fuck that pretty hole that’s waiting for me” dean sat up now straddling cas’ chest and popping open his jeans and quickly unzipping them, hissing as he brushed against his dick
he grabbed the first aid kid that they now have in deans room now, because things like this happen way too many times in sams opinion, he gently cleaned deans new formed scars and bruises on his face
“so, there’s gonna be a sleepover at the novak’s and everyone is able to come that is at this table” charlie said happily “charlie just because we have a big house doesn’t mean our house is gonna be a sleepover go to” cas sighed, but he knew he wasn’t gonna win this fight
birthday two years ago, Sam had teased him so much that Dean had pushed him off of the dining chair.
“Tell Castiel I said goodbye and that I love him very much.” Meg murmurs. “That is my only regret upon death, that he never knew how much he meant to me,”
Dean realises that her sister must be Hester, the woman he remembered last night. He wonders how the lovely old woman in front of him could be related to the hateful faery that he once knew.
Cas waited for Dean to finish fingerspelling the word before he nodded. A whole flood of emotions poured on Dean—anger, sadness, frustration, hurt. Instead of calming down and keeping his feelings in check, he immediately began to explode in rapid sign language.
He had talked to Dean about birthdays once, when the two of them sat out on the hills, gorging themselves on the cookies left over from his mother’s birthday celebrations.
Dean follows her down the winding halls, letting her listen and lead the way to the control room. Although he can admit that it’s nice having another person physically with him, he can’t help but miss Castiel and the way the prince helped guide him during the other fortresses.
Dean, having not been used to rapid sign language for years, asked her to sign again slowly. He watched her intensely as she finger spelled the cookie’s name. Upon realising what she said, Dean began to cackle as he remembered what he had written on the special board out front.
He got home after a twenty-minute walk from the campus. He headed upstairs and began to bake immediately, creating the first part of the dessert. He decided on a chocolate flan as it was recently one of the newest desserts he had perfected and one that he knew Cas would like, since his friend was obsessed with chocolate. He didn’t care what Meg thought, or whether Meg would like it or not. His aim was to please Cas—that was it.
He remembered nothing of his past, at least discernable enough that he could find his way around. He could barely even remember his journey the day before, what path he took and in what direction. He was bound to get lost on his way around the island, which would not only lead to dangerous situations, but would waste time. Time that was needed in order for him to save the prince and save the island that he once called his home.
Claire paused for a moment, the doubts about her plan still in the forefront of her mind. She didn’t know whether she could really go through with it, disrupt the man’s life in front of her all for the personal gain of one of her friends. She had no idea how he would react—how he would take the news. She had no idea what the domino effect would be, whether it would lead to more disastrous consequences.
By the time they got halfway through the episode, they had finished their donuts and tossed the empty box onto the coffee table. Dean lay his head against the armrest, his back on the cushions, before pulling Cas down with him, so that he was resting his own head on Dean’s chest. They laid like that over the course of a couple of episodes, with Dean switching between running his hand through Cas’ hair and rubbing circles into his back.
Dean watched as Muriel, Anna and Gabriel left in Muriel’s car, whereas Michael, Cas, Balthazar and Inias hopped into the sedan. Tears stung Dean’s eyes as he watched the sedan drive away, knowing he’d really hurt his friend, even though he hadn’t meant to. He knew then that cards and letters wouldn’t cut it, he really needed to find another way to make it up to his friend.
She signed, fingerspelling his nickname before using his sign name. The man stared back at her with curiosity as he raised his own hands.
Dean goes to warn her to be quiet, to approach the room carefully, but it is no use. Her outburst has already summoned the monster, who appears behind her with a malicious grin.
The room is dimly lit, but Dean can faintly see the room’s layout. He walks forward slowly, to see a table a few feet in the distance. When he reaches the table, he is relieved to find clothing waiting for him. He places the clothing on; which happens to be a white tunic, brown pants and black boots. He puts them on slowly, the movements seeming familiar yet foreign at the same time. He knows how to put clothing on and knows what clothing
Castiel and Dean waited as Anna typed in the code for the fortress. Then, they stepped back and watched as the large metal doors opened, revealing a dark tunnel.
Dean had decked his store out in Halloween decorations—from skeleton cut-outs on the windows to Jack-O-Lantern paper machés hanging from the ceiling. A bunch of Halloween treats filled the displays to celebrate the Holiday spirit, something Claire—on her usual visit—found agitating.
“They know basic sign language.” Dean explained. “It’s hard not to when you grow up seeing Cas every…”
The real version weighed his options before deciding. “You know what? Fuck it. Fine. Do you want me to do my wish now?”
“I got a call from Charlie and-” Sam paused, taking in his brother’s tense figure at the mention of Charlie. Interesting, Sam thought, cataloguing that reaction away for later. “And she asked me if you were home yet, and, when I said no, I realized how late it was and wanted to go find you. Why didn’t you call me to tell me you’d be home late?”
“Where’s Bobby?” Castiel asked, emerging from Bobby’s cellar. Sam looked up at him from the kitchen table, holding an extremely thick turkey sandwich.
Dean thought of the slip earlier when he had spoken out loud instead of thinking, as well as the pain that he had felt in the beginning and the loss of control. “I...don’t know.”
“Hiya,” Dean greeted, standing, recovering himself from their intense staring contest. “What can I help you with today?”
Dean came back to himself. He felt hands on his shoulders and saw Bobby only a few inches from his face, wearing an expression that was a mix between horrified and worried. Panicked, Dean breathed through his nose and out his mouth, closing his eyes to do so. After he was calmed down enough, he ran out of Bobby’s grip and left the store with the voice chanting over and over:
“Well,” Anna said, looking at Castiel. “I heard that he’s working at that auto shop..Um, what is it...Singer’s Auto?”
The Spirit laughed. “I don’t necessarily have to look like you. This is just the form I’m currently in. I could look like this,” -it transformed into an old man with wild, white hair- “or this,”- he transformed into a guy who had an eerie resemblance to Nick Cage- “if you prefer.”
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, irritated that Gabriel wouldn’t just come out with it. Gabe held up a hand to keep Dean from continuing and then continued.
Sam smiled a little as the tension in the room began to fade. “Yeah, man. I’ll go make you one, and maybe in return you could tell me a little bit about this whole possession thing?”
The Spirit turned back into Dean’s doppelganger and smiled. “Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure you were comfortable with me in this visage.”
“Dean, it is no inconvenience to me. I want to make sure you’re okay, and, no offense to you or Sam, but I’m not trusting your brother to properly help you either.”
she was purring loudly now nuzzling her face into his neck, obviously loving all the attention she was getting “alright c’mon your giving me scratches on my shoulders with all that climbing” he easily picked her up from his shoulder and setting her down gently
Dean knew they always moved a lot, but for some reason he felt like this place would stay, it was a pretty nice house two stories and 4 bedrooms, the master was for their dad, obviously, sam got the second largest and dean got the smallest, even the guest room was bigger than his room
he was also naked, boxers off and laying on the ground somewhere, he was vulnerable in this position, hole right in dean’s sight and half hard cock laying against his hip
Sam tries to stop his dad but is always sent to his room, either by dean or his dad, he didn't like it at all, but he was too small to go against his dad, he's tried countless times trying to stop his dad but gets shoved into a bookshelf and knocked out
“wish i could say the same, but i don’t get into drama unless it involves me” cas replied, braiden nodded and smiled lightly “thanks cas, good thing i finally managed the balls to talk to you, i almost chickened out, though i guess people like to say wrong things about you” he admitted
“dean-” cas sighed, getting tired of fighting it cause of how bad he wants to give in “please, cas” big pleading green eyes stared into cas’ blue ones, cas tried so hard to not give in but after weeks and weeks of torture, he couldn’t hold back anymore
“y-you have..nipple piercings!” dean shrieks, getting all flustered all the sudden, truth was dean’s lower regions were liking what he was seeing and his jeans were starting to get tighter
lucifer was observing everything with a shit eating grin on his face “wheres the popcorn, lads?” he mumbled sitting down, with no intention to break it up
braiden and jack left to jacks room to go to sleep cause they were exhausted, and they both plopped down onto the bed and looked at each other, jack looked into braiden’s eyes and braiden smiled at him hoping he was thinking right about what jack was giving him here
sam had his suspicions about deans sexual activity around school but he honestly didn’t want to know so he stayed out of dean’s business, dean was thankful of that, even tho he knew sam at any point could blackmail him into something, sam has had chances where he wanted to but he knew how his mom was
dean hummed low in his throat sucking at cas’ rim while his tongue was seated deep into cas, for some reason cas felt tighter than any other virgin he has fucked and he smirked knowing he was about to take it away from cas, he didn’t even have it in himself to feel bad for doing this, he was thriving on the fear cas was feeding him.
the demon immediately pushes his length into the wet heat of cas’ mouth, dean groaned as his tip his the back of cas’ throat, cas gags and drool immediately starts pooling into his mouth and onto deans cock
“how? i mean dean... dad’s gonna be pissed and you know what’s gonna happen if we go through with this” sam said, already figuring that cas knows about what his dad does to dean mostly
cas whimpered, straight up whimpers when dean taps his tip against cas’ bottom lip, pre cum dripping onto his it lightly “open up” the demon ordered, cas squeezes his eyes shut and opens his mouth
dean looked at him then and his face lit up slightly “please” he replied, not even caring that when he gets home that he’s gotta make sure his dad doesn’t see it
“j-jack, cmon” braiden whines, slightly pushing jack down, jack chuckled “want my lips wrapped around your cock huh?” braiden whimpers and bucks his hips against the others hard on and jack gasped
“i’m gonna have my fun with you, your fear is great to feed off on and it’s exactly what i need right now after sammy decided to tie me into the devil trap” cas’ bottom lip trembled lightly, he knew he couldn’t win, not with his condition
"he will be showing dean around, since he is in dean's grade, sam though" she pulled in a guy with dark blond hair with a sucker in his mouth and looks like he's seen a whole thing of fireworks go off "this is gabe, cas's brother who is in sam's grade so works out" she finished
“ow!” both squeaked at the same time “stop wrestling and go get dressed for school, and don’t be such pussy’s that was nothing, now go” chuck commanded, sending the two boys to their room
cas would never get this image out of his head, never would he let it, dean really loved this sight but he was too close so he gripped dean’s hair and pulled him off with a pop “dean, please tell me you have a condom”
he also has both ears pierced but only one of them with a second piercing, his eyebrow was also pierced, well dean was used to guys like him..just no a hot one,
Dean put his finger on cas’ bottom lip, pushing down on it lightly watching it tremble under the pad of his thumb, cas grit his teeth together, trying to spot whatever plan the demon had for him
“honestly, i brought you here because, well your..different, there’s something about you that i can’t quite place” cas squinted his eyes obviously now thinking about it and tilting his head like a confused puppy
dean squinted “cas..don’t, you don’t have to do this for us-“ dean started but cas immediately cut him off “i want to, dean, we have plenty rooms here and like you said, you wanna get a job and move out when your 18..you’ll still be able to do that and maybe sam will do the sam when he gets to 18”
dean loved his dad even if he would get drunk and yell at dean, he tried getting over his addiction to alcohol but even after a couple visits to rehab nothing helped him, he still always apologized to dean when he would still be sober which was always before he left to work but would come back drunk after having drinks with a couple friends
cas tries to jerk out of gasp but the hand gripped in his hair kept his head still, he tried pulling his tongue out from under dean’s thumb but all it did was let out a slight gagging noise that was unpleasant
she was the kind of person that would ground you for months if she found out dean fucked almost daily, she was mostly at work and so was cas so he had a lot of free time and even sam was at a friends house for the night
also i am not the best at keeping stories going due to lack of motivation but i will try to keep this story going for as long as i can, i am also moving from wattpad to ao3 and still need to get better at grammar and all that
“see ya, cassie” gabe smirked basically running out of the car and over to sam who he spotted walking up to the school, cas rolled his eyes and got out of the car and leaned on the car taking out a cigarette and lighting it “идиот”
Charlie loved Dean. She loved how he understood her shyness about her orientation, she loved how he would drive in the middle of the night to comfort her, and she loved him even though he dropped out of high school during Junior year in order to take care of Sam. Long ago Charlie had realized that she would die for Dean as he would for her.
felt about something, whether it was the entire year she boycotted ice cream due to it’s “utter cliche-edness” or when he respected her not wanting to talk about her parents. He also respected her when she broke down while telling him about her parents’ accident, even holding her as she cried. Dean and Charlie just...fit.
His heart beat faster. God, all these people, dead at his hands. His breath quickened, and he felt himself go into the beginnings of a panic attack, until something sparked in the back of his brain.
In which Dean (or is it really Dean?) is a pervy creep, Ruby's just a plain old creep who thinks she's soooooo smooth, and everyone else is extremely worried.
Also, all of you who caught that Nick Cage reference, you get a metaphorical cookie. Although, for the record, Ghost Rider is a terrible movie.
Ruby stepped into her house and silently closed the door behind her. She moved into the main room, where multiple Demons were congregated. They all turned and looked at her as she entered.
Dean gulped and then refocused to see the gangsters looking an equal mix of extremely irritated and extremely perturbed. He put his game face back as the leader became more hostile. It seemed that while Dean had been speaking to the Spirit, the other party in the deal had gotten the hell out of dodge. It didn’t matter that they did though. Dean was only after the Demons.
(When he asked his brother about it that night, all he had gotten was a “Sometimes people have important things to tell you about themselves that not everyone reacts to the same, Sammy. It’s shitty that common courtesy can have that much of an effect on a person...really shows how little they have received it.” Those words echoed in his mind for a second, making him even more disappointed in himself for the way he handled the Dean situation.)
Dean had raced home to find his little brother sitting on the sidewalk a few meters away from their house, breath quicker than it should’ve been, with his crutch a few feet away from him and his head in his hands. As soon as Dean's voice rang through the air, Sam's head shot straight up. Once catching sight of Dean, he struggled to stand, only to immediately collapse back down onto the sidewalk. Dean ran toward his brother, arms catching Sam before Sam could make impact on the sidewalk.
He tried to remember what happened, but he couldn’t recall. In fact, he couldn’t really recall any recent events. Every time he tried to reach into his short term memory he got an overwhelming sensation of being shoved, beaten, drowned in darkness. He couldn’t breathe, and all he could feel was just...suffocation. He was suffocating.
To her, Dean was like the brother that she had never had. He understood her. To anyone else in high school, he had been quiet and shy, too nervous to ever even say hello to anyone. But, to Charlie, he was one of the best people she knew. He was caring and compassionate, especially when it came to his little brother, Sam, who he had been looking after his whole life.
“What’s up dude?” Charlie said, rifling through some CDs in her glovebox. “I’ve got Metallica, Creedence Clearwater, ACDC-”
The brunette stared down at his lap, suddenly interested in his fingers. “I..may have followed you back to your house after our first meeting.”
Sam gave him a sympathetic and worried look, and then nodded. “I know, Cas. Just...let us know if you’re okay, alright? After you do whatever you have to. ”
Castiel Novak was a small memory, a mere blink in Dean’s existence. However, Dean remembered him well. He was the only kid in the third grade to act like Dean existed. When he had left it had devastated Dean, because that meant probably no one would ever talk to the motherless mute boy with the absent father. In fact, no one had made any effort to acknowledge Dean in any sort of way since Castiel had left; that is, until Charlie transferred over in the eighth grade.
The man set the piece of pie on a plate and sighed. He held up the paper plate with the pie on it. “How about we take this outside?”
As soon as he finished his prayer, the archangel appeared, a worried look on his face. He quickly looked over Sam and, making Sam bend over a little, pressed a finger to the much taller hunter’s forehead, healing him of his injuries. The angel went to speak but was cut off by Sam shaking his head. “No,” the hunter said. “Help Dean.”
“Hello?...No, Bobby, he’s not gonna be there...Yeah, I don’t think he’ll be showing up for work for a couple of days...Well, he’s sick. He’s vomiting everywhere and it’s super super gross...No, Bobby, don’t come over here it might be contagious...Charlie called you? Why?...No, no, Bobby, don’t come over here everything’s fine.--”
a burden? You were a burden to Dad after Mom died. He had to deal with a whiny, snot-nosed brat who couldn’t stop crying about his mommy being gone. And then he left you to raise Sam as he threw himself into his work, leaving for weeks at a time, ditching that burden and leaving it to take care of the child he
Sam stifled a laugh while the other man looked at her, head tilted, confused. “I don’t understand that reference.”
Dean sighed and propped himself up on his elbows, earning a brief glare from Castiel. “Man, Sammy really didn’t make a good first impression, huh?”
Dean was returned to a normal, upright position sporting a confused expression before it dawned on him. “I’m trapped in my head.”
As his entire being faded into black abyss, the last things he heard were the Spirit screaming and Chanel Dean No.3 cackling.
“Castiel,” Michael started, softly. “You know that that is not true. I just...I worry about you. You’re my charge, and you haven’t been back to the park in months.”
“Shit!” he yelled, trying to scramble away but somehow frozen in his position, knife remaining in his hand.
As Sam talked, Dean felt frozen on the inside. He knew the question that was coming. Knowing Sam, it was inevitable. Just give the kid a few seconds…
Dean gulped. He knew exactly what this was about. “Sam,” he sighed, too exhausted by his issues to deny his brother an answer. “You wouldn’t understand.”
Sam shook his head in exasperation at his older brother’s antics, only to have it lost in the fray of his fretting sibling.
Gabriel turned to see Dean, still frozen in place. The archangel appeared in front of the elder Winchester to see Dean’s eyes totally blank, pupils dilated. “Shit,” he cursed, before touching the hunter and healing him...on the outside. “Sam, get over here; I need to get you two back to your motel. Dean’s in shock.”
He turned to see Gabriel gazing up at him with his golden-amber eyes filled with understanding. Sam wryly laughed. “Jesus, Gabriel. When will this shit ever end?”
. He wanted to feel blood drying on his skin and bathe in it, to feed on the death energy of the evil, laughing as he sends damned souls down to the boss-man in Hell. Even though he quit his job ages ago, it never hurt to stay in Old Scratch’s good graces.
“Gabriel, this is most definitely not the largest apiary collection in all the Earth,” Castiel grunted, steely blue eyes fixed upon his brother. It appeared as if he was going to try to smite Gabriel before he caught sight of the Winchesters. “Hello Dean.”
“Ruby,” her mom said slyly, her voice soothing and expression falsely innocent. “Tell me about those Winchesters. Sam’s in your class, right?”
Dean took a deep breath and cleared his head, before roughly running his fingers through his hair and standing up. He glanced out the window, seeing the moon, before doing a double take. Instead of the regular moonlight Dean, and, well, everyone, was so used to, it was as if the moon had been replaced with a blacklight.
“You know,” Michael started, ready to repeat a rant that Castiel had heard many times before. “You don’t have to work there. You could be much more well off working for the Angels.”
“What? Why are you laughing?” Dean asked. Sam threw his gaze at his brother, making Dean flinch back at the mix of frustration and bemusement in those hazel eyes.
Dean quickly realized he hadn’t been engaging in conversation for a few minutes and stuck out his hand. “Of course I remember you. Nice to see you!”
Sam couldn’t argue with that logic, but he still believed that Cas should continue to rest, so to console himself he face-palmed before responding with, “There’s cold pizza on the counter.”
Castiel filled Dean in on how there was a major Demon drug and arms deal going down at the docks. The blond could feel the bloodlust surge up just from the mere mention of Demons. The Spirit was growling in anticipation; it was ready to feed.
“Sam, I know,” Gabriel said, moving closer. “I know. But this isn’t fully under his control. Nobody could’ve foreseen this happening, and, if they had, they wouldn’t have been able to stop it.”
The blonde rolled his eyes. Castiel, after intently watching Dean for a minute, asked, “So what does he - is he a he, I don’t know - feed on?”
The blond wryly quirked his lips up at Cas, and that was when the waiter had realized he was staring. “...Um, are you okay? How are you here? What happened?”
“Dean, we’re going to find something eventually. Someone must know something about the attempt on your lives."
Dean winced. He didn't need a reminder of the overwhelming, too real memories that overpowered every sense as a form of torture.
Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath before swinging his fist into the creature’s face, barely feeling the impact over the ringing in his ears. It stumbled back, startled, before it smiled - a gnarly thing that could barely be called a smile. Maybe a better word would be a snarl. It wiped Dean’s hand across its mouth. “Wow, baby, didn’t know you had that in you.”
Castiel hurriedly walked through the park, weaving between the masses occupying the area. Gradually he made his way to the northwest corner. The farther he got, the amount of people tapered off until there were only a few people, scattered around, sneaking through the area. Castiel laughed at their fear under his breath and climbed into the trailer that everyone was not-so-subtly avoiding.
The monster came to him, carefully lifted his tired and useless body, and pushed Dean against the wall, holding him up as his body sagged. Tears ran down Dean’s face as it shushed him.
Sam made a chuffing noise that was a mix between a laugh and a groan, running his fingers through greasy hair. “Well, uh, to quote Bobby, ‘I know something isn’t right you damn fool idjit, and Red knows it too’. So it’s a stretch, but I think that they suspect something’s up with Dean.”
“Sorry, Sam, I just… I’ve been thinking,” he tried again. “About, you know, life, in general. You know, with this job I never thought I’d make it past 20. I was never meant to live, but, now, I’m getting old. I’ve been thinking about settling down. I know you’ve been thinking of settling down, going back to college. And I know it’s selfish of me to make you keep going through this life, but I don’t want to settle down...alone. Just like with this life,” Dean paused to gesture at the motel room. “I don’t want to be alone. I want someone with me.”
Thank you so much to all those who've stuck with this story. It means a lot. Also, I know I can be a little annoying so it really shows your strength of character 👏👏👏. Bravo :).
“So what you’re saying is that since I didn’t fully accept you, the shittiest part of me merged with the shittiest part of you?”
"You must. This is a matter of war. The Demons have declared it, and, with their prison break last night, time is of the essence."
He jumped away and waited with Bobby and Sam, looking on in worry and horror. Three minutes later, she opened her eyes, tears swimming in them. Charlie swallowed thickly and composed herself before turning to the men. “I know where Dean is. And you need to hurry.”
Cole Trenton sat at his desk sipping coffee. He hated the night shift; it was boring and monotonous, and most nights he struggled to stay awake. Staring at monitors was not the most riveting job, but, for fourteen dollars an hour, he could deal with it. He watched as Gordon Walker, his only other cohort on the night shift, made his rounds. Cole liked Gordon. He did his job well and efficiently, not showing any emotion except pure steel rage, which was useful when dealing with the lower-than-dirt assholes who were caged in this godforsaken penitentiary. The man took another drink of his coffee, closing his eyes and savoring the feeling of the caffeine hitting his system. He felt the need to at least obtain a little joy from
“Dean, you must realize that you have a very small bed. It’s not big enough for the both of us to be in without touching. It’s alright.”
His brother shot up as quickly as he could with a broken leg and stared at Dean, while Cas stared at him with worried and lost eyes, which was an expression Dean had never seen on Castiel before. He decided he didn’t like it.
They both went silent at Castiel’s outburst. Castiel made for the door, but at the last second, leaned his forehead against the cool metal. He took a few deep breaths.
“Hey, Dean. Slow day today. Can you stock up the shelves over on that side while I do some inventory?”
Somehow its eyes became even more furious and its grip became tighter, causing Dean to wince, before something overcame it (
“Hello to you too.” The god turned into his lover’s embrace and wrapped his arms around the Lord of Death’s neck, staring into those ethereal eyes. “How is the Underworld holding up?”
Silence overtook the conversation once more, an awkward tension in the air. Castiel took a moment to study the features of Dean’s face. Moonlight cast shadows over the other boy’s face, making him seem almost ethereal. He continued to observe as the boy watched the moon shine over the woods in front of them with a mysteriously wistful expression on his face. It was very calm until Dean disturbed the silence.
Thirty minutes later, bathed in the blood of gangsters long dead (and then some), Dean was pulling Castiel into a shitty motel room straight out of the seventies, shag carpet and all. Dean had a giddiness about him that only confirmed how un-
Completely and utterly broken, Dean nodded, tears dripping off his chin. The monster caught one on its thumb and licked it, savoring the taste. Returning that hand to the man’s shoulder, the monster lifted its other hand and pressed it to Dean’s forehead, an orange glow emitting from it as Dean’s entire body tensed and his eyes rolled back into his head before he went completely limp. The monster smiled and petted the side of Dean’s face. “Good boy.”
Sam rolled his eyes as he watched Dean move slowly (and what looked like painfully) to sit down at the table. The young Winchester observed Castiel and Dean exchange an unreadable look, one which made Castiel look even more worried. He waited for his brother to sit down, before unleashing the full force of his irritation on his brother.
Sam looked at his older brother as if he was an idiot. “Of course, Dean. I was there when a bunch of...gangsters, I guess, tried to kill us.”
Dean looked at the bullet that was lodged in his shoulder. The small chunk of metal promptly was pushed out of his shoulder as the skin and muscle knit back together quickly. The Winchester slowly lifted his head, revealing flaming orange eyes as his body began to turn orange, almost as if his insides were on fire, with the flames fighting to get out. Though it looked painful, Dean was oblivious, laser-focused on his shooter.
“Watch the shop for a little bit. Your cousin and I got some stuff to do.” Gabriel opened his mouth to protest but, to Castiel’s surprise, quickly closed it, seeing something in Dean’s face. The blond smirked and grabbed Castiel’s hand a little too forcefully.
“It’s…” she trailed off and reached into the backseat to grab a notebook and some crayons. Charlie worked for a little bit on her drawing and, when finished, handed the notebook to Dean, then put the car into drive. Dean looked down to see a miasma of gold shot through with dark red, black, and bright orange.
appeared in the room. This Dean was wearing a black leather jacket with jeans and motorcycle boots, looking pretty fucking hot if the real Dean had any say in it. He was snapped out of his ogling when Dean #3 levelled him with a glare.
The smirk widened and was accompanied by an eyebrow waggle, which cracked some of the dried blood on Dean's forehead. Demon blood. “Yeah, baby.”
I know I promised to shed a little light on the whole "Sam Ruby plotline" but please have patience. These things get away from me....the chapter is literally, like, ten pages.
Gabriel was in the middle of shaking his head when Anna walked in. “Who?” she asked, putting on her apron.
Unfortunately, that one innocent moment taken to relish the hot liquid was the same moment somebody chose to hit Cole on the head with an extremely hard object. He felt the sharp pain on the back of his head, spilling hot coffee all over his lap with the shock of it, adding to that pain, and fell to the floor. The last thing he saw was a masked figure shut off the monitors.
The Commander sighed. "It was the Demons, Castiel. They were waiting to ambush us. I know Inias was your friend and I'm sorry for your loss, but last night...you know what needs to be done, Seraph."
Sam smiled up at Ruby sweetly as she sat down next to him at one of the many study tables within the library, although it didn’t meet his eyes, which looked absolutely devastated. She shot him a quick grin back before donning the worried friend act.
over and over in his head and the fact that Dean had had murderous thoughts about random strangers he passed on the sidewalk today. While thinking on this Dean’s hand shook, causing some odds and ends car trinkets to tumble to the ground.
Its expression became mocking. “Oh, yeah, that's right: your precious little family. Sammy and Castiel. You think they’ll
Meanwhile, Sam sat downstairs with a worried expression on his face. What could be wrong with his brother? Then, at that moment, he came to one conclusion: the only way he would know what was wrong with Dean was if he found out himself. And, even if it ended with one or both of them being embarrassed, Sam resolved himself to following his brother the next night.
“I heard there were a few Demons over by the docks. Go see what they’re doing and report back to me.”
“I don’t want to be better. If going into the family business, which I barely tolerate in the first place, makes me better, then I’m good. Any other job? Sign me up. But not what you want me for now. Not for this.”
I love cliffhangers. And I hadn't brought Charlie in in a while so what the heck. Also, I both love and hate Ruby. Mostly hate cuz she's annoying af, but also kinda love her because she's so sketchy and somehow manages to get Sam to "play D&D" with her. Like what the heck. Yeah girl, you so smooth.
The archangel removed his hand from the giant’s shoulder and remained close-mouthed, silently urging Sam to let it out. Sam roughly ran both hands through his hair as he glared at the sky. “I mean seriously, Chuck, when will this ever end?! Dean, Cas, we’ve all been through so much of this bullshit! And- And we thought it was done, you know? The- The countless Big Bads around every corner, the plots that continuously tear down everything we attempt to build, and the witches and the curses and Hell and everything and now? Now when we are finally, finally allowed to have the chance to build just a tiny, tiny life of our own, another thing gets thrown at us! When does it END, Chuck?!”
, to entertain himself with until you get boring. You think a gang member cares about you? I’ve seen his soul, Dean, he’s no innocent. He doesn’t care about you. Honestly, when you think about it, nobody cares about you. They only pity you and use you.”
She looked up with tears in her green eyes before quickly looking away from the young Winchester. “It’s nothing, Sam,” she rasped. “You don’t want to see this.”
The younger Winchester winced, swallowed, and steeled himself before speaking. This thing in front of him wasn’t Dean; it was just another monster. “What do you want?” he gritted out.
Castiel’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Dean, I have no intention of hurting you. You must know that, right?”
“God,” the Angel scoffed, banging his head on the wall behind him. “Will anyone ever tire of asking me that fucking question?”
, that man was a nuisance. He couldn’t just put up and shut up. It was getting hard for him to even think.
All of a sudden, Dean was seeing what he could only describe as...Castiel. There was gold and blue mixed with a darker navy that just seemed to shine brighter than any sun.
“Ruby, I- I was wondering if you were free? I can meet you at the library. I- I just really need to be with someone right now.”
Castiel was nervous. No, understatement, he was, as Gabriel would put it, “freaking out”. Dean Winchester was even more breathtaking up close than he was from far away. Also, there was the small matter of him being..whatever he was, but, surprisingly, that characteristic didn’t deter Castiel’s interest in the slightest.
Sam recoiled and, cowed, suddenly became very interested in his sandwich. Castiel felt a pang of guilt strike him through the fog of feelings muddling his brain. “I’m sorry, Sam. I’m fine. I just...I have to go somewhere for a bit.” He swallowed down the bile that was creeping up his throat and stood. “There’s something I need to do.”
“Haha, that’s where you’re wrong Dean-o,” Gabriel announced, popping his sucker out of his mouth, lewdly winking at Sam.
Dean looked up from his empty glass of water. “When we were getting beaten up by those demons, I prayed for Cas.”
Bodies. Bodies were everywhere. The dripping that he had awakened to was the blood of a woman who was impaled on a nail in the warehouse wall as it fell from her many open wounds, her glazed eyes staring blankly up at the dark night sky. He looked around to find that many cold, dead stares lost to the cold grasp of the grim reaper. He swallowed. This was a massacre. How had he managed to be the lone survivor?
Possible tw: Non-con, but literally nothing happens. More like just the threat of it. Nothing explicit.
the man attached to his hand was. Castiel soon found himself being thrown onto the bed with the creature, as Dean definitely wouldn’t be
Sam unconsciously leant into the touch, leaning into the hand that held him when he had nightmares, the hand that held his own on the first day in every school they went to until Sam decided it was “uncool”, the hand that stitched him up after dangerous hunts, and he was almost convinced by the smooth voice of the god that was in his brother. But then he stopped and quickly scrambled away. “
“It used to be gold and teal. Your aura, that is. The gold, it stands for your righteousness, your purity, your heart. Not many people have gold. The teal was your burdens. It was all the weight that you carried that you didn’t have to. Now..what happened?”
SAM AND CAS ARE TEAMING UP! And sorry Cas got beat up and I left Chapter 12 on such a cliff hanger, but hey, I gave the man a pb&j. He deserves one.
I love you guys, thank you for enjoying this 😘. And if you didn't enjoy, well, thank you for attempting.
“Anna’s diner. Castiel, why do you stoop so low as to work with that...abomination. You should be doing what real Angels do. Not rolling in the mud with the pigs,” Uriel ranted, a look of disgust seemingly carved into his features.
“Castiel? Holy shit, what happened?” Sam paused, his worry momentarily abating as suspicion took over. “Wait, that’s your blood, right?”
They climbed up to the roof via the fire escape and sat on the ledge. For a minute, Castiel stared at the stars before he looked back at the blond man next to him.
cas’ bladder weakened and some piss leaked out of the tip of his dick, he quickly put a stop to it and his eyes blurred with tears due to the pain and the ache in his bladder
“f-fuck benny” dean moaned, head tilting back and pressing his chest closer to benny, benny wrapped his arms around dean’s narrow waist and pulls him close sucking till both of deans nipples are red and swollen a bit
after a long couple hours setting up the room for the others that are coming in 10 minutes cas laid on the love seat that was in the corner of the room, dean saw him and smiled big and went over to cas and laid beside him and cas instantly wrapped an arm around deans shoulder and pulled him close
cas took a couple breaths to calm himself a bit and when he finally did he finally decided that it was to far to go upstairs in a room so he set dean down and quickly got to unbuttoning his dress shirt and quickly pushed dean down onto the couch and leaned over and took one of deans nipples into his mouth and sucked, smirking a bit at deans surprised gasp and felt dean arch up into it wanting more
sam pulled off the sheets of cas’ bed and changed everything for him and started the laundry to clean the sheets even tho he was probably gonna burn it
he heard a knock on his bedroom door and he opened up to see his gabe and sam covered in glitter, he stared at them for a couple seconds then letting out a obnoxious laugh “oh my g-god! this is the best thing ever”
she handed them their schedules, dean's shoulders slumped when he saw that he had p.e first, he hated p.e
“hey, cas it’s alright, i promise, he can’t hurt you anymore, we’ll get our dean back and everything” sam held cas tightly rubbing the ex angels back feeling the angel relax
he made some extra bacon due to his own cravings but he hoped his stomach wasn’t gonna give up on him and throw it all up, he didn’t know what was wrong with him but he guessed it could be depression or some sort of stress issue cause some people’s stomach will reject the food if there’s too much stress
he held a tight grip on deans hip but not enough to stop dean from moving, dean puts his hand back and wrapped his right hand around cas’ wrist for leverage and immediately started sliding up and down loving the feeling of being full but a smart part of him hoped the condom wasn’t on but it was for the best
“also, lucifer quit teaching jack incorrect  things, now go to work before bobby rips you a new one, you know how he is when your late” chuck added, which was how he was like almost every morning but after he had his morning coffee, he was lighter on them
“okay alright dean, we can give it a try, but one thing tho dean....it’s sam” sam pulled his bitch face and dean smiled lightly knowing sam was just trying to brighten up his mood “bitch” dean said
he was lucky he even got a room so he was happy about that, ever since his dad figured out deans soul mark was a guy's name he started beating him up worse and treated him like a stranger in his own family
“you know my shoulder isn’t a chilling spot, Coraline” still petting his black cat, he named her after the movie Coraline due to his elementary obsession with the movie, he always liked it and she just reminded him of the movie
Dean knew the minute mary introduced her boyfriend of a couple months and now recent fiancé, he was doomed. The guy was basically sex on legs, no wonder why his mom wanted to bang this dude
dean nodded, trying really hard not to let his nerves get the best of him and jerk away from cas, he felt cas slightly pull down his pants to expose his hips and his soul mark, he flushed immediately realizing cas knows how that his name is on dean’s hip
“hey bitches”charlie chirped, everyone said hey back some said it with good in their mouths and some just mumbled it, like dean everyone smiled lightly and sam smiled brightly at his brother
every time the cops had came and mostly warned him to leave before they take him in, even though the kid was only 12, this had happened for a whole year of dean causing problems at the skate park but stopped after the cops had a cop stay around the park every night so dean wouldn’t even be able to step foot in the park
after around 3 cups he put the cup in the sink and walked quietly back to his room, he was still new to all these human things and didn’t realize his bladder would soon start aching for release
”3..2...1” cas said and pushed the needle through it through the skin till it came out the other side, dean squeezed his eyes shut and gripping pillow pretty hard but it wasn’t as bad as he expected
jack pulls away and looks at braiden with confusion “what about you..?” he asks, braiden just chuckles a bit “i um came while i was sucking you” he admits cheeks flushing
“i knew it” cas pulled dean around so they were facing each other “now i use to believe all this soul mark shit was bull shit, but now..” cas trailed off so dean interrupted “i can feel..our connection cas, i should be scared of whatever just happened in the past couple minutes..but i feel safe around you”
cas felt the every inch of dean and then cas physically couldn’t stop it from happening and his cock jerked at streaks off piss started splashing on his chest chin and some even managed to get on his lips and cas quickly jerked his face away
“jerk” sam replied, cas smiles at the two “okay, i will be right back, remember..this is for the best” cas leaves and walked up to his fathers room leaving the two in there
dean was still hard from before and cas’ actions only made it worse, his erection pressed against his own stomach and cas’ and dean couldn’t help but press himself harder against cas for friction
dean found his shirt and bent down to grab it but then he felt cas press up behind him and puts his hands on deans hips, cas half hard erection presses against dean ass “cas” he whines, slightly pushing back against cas erection
cas could tried not to look down at dean with his lips wrapped around his cock, but he simply couldn’t, not when dean made sure to put on a show, sharp green eyes looking up at him and shiny red lips wrapped around his cock, and younger boy even decided to arch his back a tiny bit to make sure his ass stood out
dean ate some bacon but quickly stopped himself feeling his stomach start to clench uncomfortably, he wiped his hands   and wished he would just be able to be like any other teenager but he wasn’t and he hated it but he quickly put those thoughts away
“i’m not, that’s why i’m telling you..i’ll be 18 in 6 months and i can’t just exactly get away from him, we move to much to have it happen but now i’m strong enough to say something but i need you trust the process” dean pleaded, he had an escape plan but it was gonna take awhile
cas smirked and patted him on the back “c’mon, hang out with me today..your clearly avoiding your friends” cas pushes himself off the car and dropped the cigarette on the ground and smashing it with foot before walking into the school with braiden following quickly behind
“what the hell! gabe, get your ass back here” with that cas got up and shot after his brother, the two were running around the way to big house due to their father chuck
“all you have to do is fuck me, and i’ll be outa your hair, after this you probably won’t even know i’m here” dean said, licking his lips getting desperate cause he’s been wanting cas to fuck him for like months and every time cas has always gotten out of it with “i can’t, your too young”
after that, sam laid with cas for the rest of the week together until they finally found a cure for dean
he felt himself sliding deeper into cas’ throat, he gripped hard around cas’ neck cutting off the ex angel’s air way and starting a fast face in and out of the wet heat
“castiel, you know this is risky” Naomi said, sitting beside his dad “guys, those two have gone through shit with their dad, we have to get them out of here, dean will only be here for a couple months till he graduates and sam will do the same and will only be here for a couple years, please mom..and dad” cas begged
dean loved cas being gentle with him but it wasn’t cas who was in control now, dean impaled himself down onto cas’ length and cas’ hands flew to his hips and hips rising to meet him on the way down, deans mouth fell open and he clenched feeling himself leak a strip of come as the tip of cas’ cock hit his prostate head on
Dean wasn't broken, no he was stomped on and in pieces all over the ground, at least that's how he felt like, after he lost his mom he couldn't bring himself to talk, he missed his mom, missed her smell, her cooking, everything a mother has
braiden took his chance and flipped them over “i’ve got a better plan” he said, then started pulling off jacks pants, once they were off braiden threw them on the ground and went down and licked at the head of jacks erection through his pair of grey boxers
the two just glared at him while he had his laughing bit, after a couple seconds cas stopped and rubbed his stomach after all that laughing
cas immediately took the invitation and slid his tongue into the elder winchester’s mouth, dean moaned as cas’ tongue invaded his mouth and moves against his tongue, cas could feel blood rush south at the sound dean made
Upon their arrival back into the town, they are awarded with a huge feast by the town’s people, supplied by Amara and Inias. The fortress is no longer the bleak sight it once was, with the red lights gone, the fortress somehow shines a little brighter. Dean tries to refuse their praise, but they are all insistent he takes it. So he enjoys the feast, the fine food and the conversations of some good people who have unfortunately grown up in a world full of such horrors.
She looks out to the side, “East of here, is a little village, one you used to be familiar with. Vale, it is called. Signs should point you to where it is, but make sure to follow the path. There is a woman named Missouri. At this point, I feel she will be expecting you. She will have answers for you that I cannot give.”
At some point Cas loses his suit jacket, and then a moment later, so does Dean. Dean ends up fiddling with Cas’ blue tie, trying to resist the urge to rip it off when he feels Cas’ hands slowly trail upwards towards the waistband of Dean’s pants. It’s then that he truly realises what they’re doing, what’s happening and what this is inevitably going to turn to. He pushes Cas off him, the man in front of him looking dazed and confused.
Two minutes passed and yet, Cas was still nowhere to be seen. Dean felt sick to his stomach and felt his hands begin to shake. He wanted nothing more at that point than to skip his lectures and just flee the building. He wanted to make sure Cas was okay,
Dean walked up and into Missouri’s open arms, embracing her. They held onto each other for a little while, where during that time Cas had wandered up next to them. As they stepped away from each other, Dean turned to look at this friend.
The man in question, the man he had been growing to like in a more intimate way, who had had a soul-deep battle with a supernatural being less than two days ago, was standing in front of him, looking a little worse for wear, but somehow somewhat okay, which is a major difference from when Castiel had seen him last. Dean looked exhausted, but he looked alive, so that was definitely an improvement.
Relaxing his body, he walked across the warehouse, stepping over charred bodies that were scattered sporadically on the floor. Cas looked up from the Demon he had just stabbed and dropped the body on the ground. Dean’s eyes lost their bloodlust and he tentatively shot a half-smile at Cas. Hesitantly, the dark haired Angel smiled back. They started to clean up any evidence that they were the ones behind the multiple corpses covering the warehouse.
“Dean Winchester is very strong, and his soul isn’t...fully embracing this new change,” he replied softly. “I can handle it, though, Hades. I’m stronger than I look...well, looked. This body is much stronger than my last.”
Ruby was a popular girl. She was beautiful, decently smart, and had a magnetic personality which either repelled or attracted people. One thing about Ruby, though, is that she had one major flaw.
Dean leapt to his feet. “Well at least I’m no body-snatcher who thrives off of making my life a living hell!”
After getting Sam to bed, leaving him with the lie that Dean had been with friends the entire night, Dean remembered that he had left Sam’s crutch outside. Rubbing a hand over his face, he walked outside, searching for the apparatus in the moonlight.
Sam stared at the area before him, dumbfounded. Concrete, once a gigantic rift that led to the Underworld, now only showed slight signs of distress, absolutely giving no passerby any impression that it had just swallowed up two people barely fifteen minutes before. The younger Winchester turned his face to the sky and pinched his nose, closing his eyes. Seriously, what the actual hell? He made a rough “chuffing” sound that could’ve easily been mistaken for either a laugh or a sob, and flinched when a hand made contact with his shoulder.
After getting a bus ride to a block away from his house, Dean started walking home, disheartened, thinking the entire time about what a waste this whole crusade was. Maybe he should just quit while he was ahead.
Castiel shook his head as it grinned. “I’m all the parts of Dean that matter. I’m Dean, just...with a twist. Tell me you don’t like that, baby. Me, better than ever.”
alone,” Gabriel interrupted, him and Sam smirking, causing Dean to turn bright red. The eldest Winchester stammered, rendered borderline speechless as Cas marched toward him with a purpose, righteous fury illuminating the angel’s blue eyes. Gabriel materialized a bag of popcorn and offered some to Sam.
Sam ducked his head and rubbed at his eyes, not really feeling like answering but deciding to anyway.
Dean and the Spirit were thrown onto opposite walls as a third person appeared in the room. Well, to be absolutely transparent, a third
Sam cooperated, and one second later they were in their motel room. Sam sat his brother down while Gabe got a glass of water. They gave Dean some space until he came back to himself, and then made him drink the water. Dean was still slightly confused, but the water helped to kind of clear his head a little bit better. Once it was established that Dean was okay, Gabriel sat back. “Okay, so what’s wrong with Cassie?”
“Oh really, babe? Let’s see. Cuz I can see a whole lot of shit that you’ve been up to. And you have been a very-,” it paused and tsked. “Very naughty boy. I mean, all the things that your uncle made you do? And the things that you’ve done willingly? All those people, lives ruined and taken, all your fault.” Castiel gulped as a faint outline of that otherworldly skull flickered beneath the creature’s skin, excited for the promise of violence. “I might just need to punish you.”
At that, the girl threw her arms around him; he caught her, shocked. “Oh you sweet sweet little thing, I’m gonna have so much fun with you.”
“Remember? Just some inter-family D&D thing. Nothing special. My family is really into codes and brain-teasers, and I want to be prepared for this next game.”
afterwards?” The last sentence was punctuated with an eyebrow waggle and a predatory gaze that made Cas squirm a little.
The Spirit winced. “If you want to put it crudely, then yes. Although, really, it isn’t the ‘shittiest’ part of you, more like the part that lusts for power and control, the part that doesn’t care about self control.”
Cas’ departure left behind two extremely dumbfounded and worried hunters. They stood in silence until Dean inevitably broke it.
Relieved, Castiel made for the door, but was stopped by Sam’s voice, suddenly weak. “This is gang stuff, isn’t it.” It wasn’t a question.
That was all Dean could manage, his heart was beating so fast with anxiety. Every beat felt like an impending death sentence.
“No, I...,” Cas paused before continuing. “I like it. It’s the first nickname anyone’s ever given me that I never actively despised.”
He searched the room again before finding the source at his hand. More specifically, his hand which was repeatedly stabbing into a long dead and charred body, blood making his fingers stick to the blade.
“Dean this is not dealing! Becoming an alcoholic is not a smart way to fix a problem!” Sam shouted, tired of his brother’s bullshit. Dean opened his mouth to shoot a scathing response back at his brother but was cut off by Cas.
His brother didn’t move to look at him. Instead, Dean sat up slowly, acting as if he was in a trance. He opened his mouth and one word came out in a voice that both belonged to his brother and didn’t.
He didn't give Sam any chance to reply, as he was already up the stairs and in his room, door closed. He took a swig of his beer, which was quickly followed by another, and another after that. Dean didn't want to deal with the conversation he had just had, and he had no interest in remembering it.
Sam sighed and then sniffed, as if he had been recently crying. “I can’t talk about it, Rube, I’m sorry. Can we meet in an hour?”
Thank god that he had Ruby. She’d really been his rock through this whole thing. She always came when he called, and always had a distraction ready to keep his mind off of Dean. Even if it’s that weird-ass blueprint puzzle.
He felt the Spirit sigh, resigned, before it retreated back to...wherever it went when it wasn’t talking to him. Dean sighed and put his head in his hands. Suddenly, he heard one of the voices raise, panic and anger making the words shoot through the air like a bullet.
“You mean the one that you stared at with an intensity that could’ve possibly made something spontaneously combust?”
“And then Sam, oh, sweet Sammy, he didn’t appreciate you. He didn’t appreciate you starving yourself so he could have a well-rounded meal. He didn’t appreciate you dropping out of high school to get that job at Bobby’s just so you could afford to get Sam new clothes and shoes. You threw away your future, Dean, and what did you get? A spoiled teenager calling you a monster and insulting you to your face. God, Dean, you even fucking got yourself possessed for him. He’s the whole reason you’re in this mess.”
The dark haired man seemed to be startled out of...well, whatever that was. He looked up at Dean with an unreadable expression on his face. “You may not remember me, but I’m Castiel Novak.”
I also promise to have out the new chapter soon. My grandma sleeps a lot and I have time to work on my projects sooo...this next chapter is already in the works. Honestly, 16 and 17 were originally one big chapter but I broke it up. Very very long.
His brother started walking away and Sam, stunned, hesitated to get up for a split second. “Dean! Don’t! We can fix this!”
The Winchester in question raised his head slowly, focusing sad eyes on the angel less than a foot away from him. “Cas, the person I love will never love me back. And if I can’t have you, then what’s the point?!”
“Michael,” Castiel ground out, sore and tired and not desiring his uncle’s worry in the slightest. “I. Am. Fine. For most of the time you know where I am, unless you spontaneously forget where your sister’s bakery is. I am quite obviously not off the grid, or else we wouldn’t be having this conversation, and, I can assure you, my well-being is fantastic.” The lie passed his lips as easily as the air he breathed.
Dean squeaked. “We?!” But Cas was already on his way up the stairs, the eldest Winchester in tow. Sam was left in the kitchen dumbfounded. Who the hell did this Castiel guy think he was?! This was between him and Dean. And what was it with this stranger and his brother? What was their relationship?
Dean stopped, momentarily startled. The Spirit had been quiet lately, having been sitting back happy and full while Dean killed his way through Demon after Demon (which was becoming way too easy these days, something that worried Dean very much). He resumed walking.
The tension that suddenly filled the air took the breath out of his lungs. The creature’s head turned toward Castiel. “What do you mean, Cas?” It’s voice was low and laced with a promise of danger.
“Sorry about my cousin,” Castiel said, dishing out a slice of pie for Dean. “He can get really annoying-”
“Sam, when have you ever known me to not?” she replied, plopping down on the couch, phone out, previous rageful demeanor apparently forgotten. Castiel turned his attention to Sam with a slightly shocked expression.
My Teen Wolf fan came out in this chapter but even I wouldn't catch it if I didn't know or even if I DID know so if you do catch it you are amazing. I'm sorry for rambling so much. I'll stop now.
Ruby nodded, glancing up at Sam while chewing on her pencil’s eraser. “So we would need to either figure out a way to crank up the furnace or somehow not have the body heat show up.”
Dean tried to lunge forward, but the cage which was his body prevented him from doing so. “SHUT UP!” he roared.
“Yeah. There’s just a..whole lotta shit that comes with surviving, you know? First there’s voices, then there’s the whole ‘hunger’ thing.”
The elder brother sat up in bed, wincing at the pain in his back due to the uncomfortable motel bed. He rubbed a hand over his eyes and sighed.
I'm curious to see if anyone spotted the reference to 15x20. It's "squint or you'll miss it" but it's there.
Castiel picked his head up and looked at Michael. Wide blue eyes met a calm blue. The elder nodded once more.
Laughter floated out into the air, a wicked thing that poisoned the atmosphere of the room. Dean opened his eyes, disoriented as they focused in and out. He heard laughter and a repetitive sound of...he didn’t know what it was but it sounded squishy.
Castiel whirled around to see his cousin Gabriel rolling his eyes at him and gesturing toward the disgruntled patrons who were waiting for their liquid energy. By said patrons was Castiel’s Aunt Anna, who currently was attempting to calm down patrons saying that more coffee was being made and that they should get some shortly. Castiel, after a split second of wondering what was going on, realized he was carrying the only full and ready coffee pots currently in the place.
cas was in the same state of mind, he knew he’d probably be able to last a bit longer than dean but he knew it wasn’t gonna be long before he’d be releasing due to pent up sexual tension between them, and mary wasn’t very active in bed which he actually liked about her, sometimes he had a very hard time getting it up which he was surprised he was so easily today
Cas stopped abruptly, causing dean to run into his back. Dean bit his lip to refrain from muttering a curse, cas smirked lightly clearly noticing deans reaction
their was the cool kid table then the emo and goths, that were more than pleased to see cas and gave him fist bumps on the way by, then their was the theatre kid group, then their was groups no one could really name just basic and boring as cas said it
dean nodded and wrote ‘can i ask you some questions also?’ and cas simply nodded, with a small small smile on his face
“not unless you let me have my suckers back” gabe said, sam snatched gabe’s lollipops during first period because gabe kept making too much noise with the wrappers obviously too annoy sam
“jeez, you need a haircut sammy” dean teased, sam rolled his eyes “no, i just simply like my hair long” sam explained to his brother, though he knew dean was just messing around and smiled lightly at his brother letting him know he knew he was joking
dean sobbed into cas’ chest, this all felt too good to be true but he knew he should give this a change cause it could change his life and he wanted a better life for sam and he was never gonna stop till they were both happy
as soon as he sat up from his bed something emerged from the shadows, cas squeezes his legs together slightly but still able to keep it in, he could feel the dark eyes on him in the dark room
dean practically whined, stupid teenage hormones making everything so easy to come too, i mean he’d probably be able to get it back up but he was too desperate to have this keep dragging on, he needed cas in him
Cas reached down pushing a rock to its other side, grabbing the key that was under it, dean looked at the key then cas in confusion
dean teared up, he never felt like he was actually loved well he knew sam loved him but this was different, this was someone who is already changing his life for the good “c-cas” dean said, trying to hold back the tears
“your right, i am avoiding my friends, just too much drama you know? sometimes i don’t feel like i fit in with the group, i love them but drama really ain’t my thing” braiden explained, walking beside cas seeming a bit more confident other than being around his friend group
this had gone out till dean turned 16, constantly getting in fights, getting suspended, then eventually the school threatened that they would kick them out if they kept up the behavior, dean held off after getting grounded for weaks and in the mean time micheal’s family decided that they had enough and they moved to some state that dean could care less about
the angle made it easy for cas to hit his prostate and cas was locked onto that angle knowing dean was gonna be coming any second, cas watched the sight of himself jackhammering into deans heat and almost coming at the sight of it, deans rim was very visibly swollen and shiny with lube and pre cum that cas’ has admittedly let out multiple times while dean was in control and is was smug right around cas’ cock
“your dad hits you! dean you can’t just let him do that to you” cas felt his anger rising, how could dean just let this happen to him “cas!” dean hissed trying to quiet the other, no one else had to hear about his asshole of a dad
dean gripped the waist band of cas’ pants and pulled him as close to the couch as possible making cas’ pants hit the couch a bit but dean didn’t care, he pulled cas’ pants and pulled them down all the way till cas’ erection popped out, now standing up at full attention against his belly, tip flushed a dark pink and wet
my writing is still very sucky but i do plan to get better :) leave some tips if you want it would be very appreciated!
cas gasps, feeling himself grow harder “dean” he pulled back slightly “you knew i was coming back early, there’s no way you forgot” he sighed, knowing dean had probably planned this
Cas tried moving his arms and legs but they were completely pinned to the bed and a thigh pushed between his legs spreading them, cas let out a little whine ignoring the ache in his bladder now remembering he has to use to the restroom
” dean slowly pulled out and slammed back into cas’ mouth, dean could barely fit most of his length into cas’ mouth due to cas being inexperienced and all, dean put a hand on cas’ throat pushing deeper into the wet heat
dean screamed, which he probably would never admit to doing and his body locked up he was coming all over cas’ fist and some of it landing on his stomach and some of it landing on his nipple and he let out a chant of cas’ name, slowly quieting down as came down from his orgasm, cas was at least nice enough to stop and let dean get out of the after shocks
Gabriel nipped his jaw in playful scolding. “Easy to say when you’re thirty-two. Just wait until you have to pee seven times a night.”
Dean’s grin widened. “I thought you’d be a challenge,” he said, ignoring Castiel’s response entirely. “I thought my charming one-liners would fall upon deaf ears. I thought you’d scoff at me, and yet… it turns out that you’re
Sam jerked away from Gabriel and began pouring coffee, pretending that he hadn’t been sharing a very heated kiss with the dragon as he pinned him against the counter mere moments ago. Gabriel blinked and stared up at Dean and Castiel with an innocent smile.
Head swimming from losing Cas earlier than expected, Dean eyed the door and made an ill-devised break for it. He ran exactly four steps before Billy swung the scythe towards his neck.
“Of course I did!” Castiel hissed. “They do it every year! It doesn’t mean I had anything to do with killing that poor man!”
“Hold up,” said Meyers with all the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. “Is there actually something going on between you two? Because it’s after the watershed, so you can tell us.” He winked at the audience, coaxing a round of whooping.
said something,” Hannah scoffed. “Or have you already forgotten that awful fight you had?” She shot Gadreel a glare. “I nearly slapped you after all those things you said about omegas.”
Surprisingly, it was Lucifer who replied. “You’re right,” he sighed, head on his paws. “We should have stood up for you.”
“He wasn’t important,” Chuck said calmly. “We checked. He had no home or family. No particularly close friends. The police won’t care. One less person to dirty their street, after all. He had nothing to live for anyway.”
“I have a boyfriend,” he blurted, causing Dean’s stomach to sink in disappointment. Castiel shook his head rapidly, looking even more flustered. “Where did you expect this to go, anyway? We’re rival candidates in a presidential election. We’re from opposite parties. What did you expect to come out of this… game?”
Dean scrubbed more tears away before slamming his hands on the wheel and grating his teeth together.
Castiel’s lips twitched upwards briefly before he rolled his eyes and butted Gabriel’s head affectionately.
“Hey,” he grinned as Castiel stumbled into him. The angel cocked an amused eyebrow at him. “Come here often?”
“I just wanted to say thank you,” Castiel said softly as he slid his hands into his pockets so they wouldn’t fidget. “For the watch. That was very thoughtful.” He dropped his gaze. “And far more than I deserve.”
. He liked the sound of that. He glanced up at Dean and studied his bright gaze and wagging tail. Now that he looked, all four wolves looked happy and excited – as though it was something contagious that they were picking up off one another.
“He also saved the object of my nest’s disgusting hunt,” Castiel continued, hoping to convey to Dean how much he had appreciated his company despite their sour end. “My father organises a hunt every year and this year, he chose a symbol of our ‘oldest and filthiest of enemies’,” Castiel mocked, complete with finger quotes. “So, he set an innocent wolf free in my garden and said that whomever killed it would win a Caribbean cruise.”
“Cas has a point,” Sam said as he regarded Jack carefully. “We could always just keep him on the outskirts until we feel that we can trust him. We can’t exactly just throw him out and leave him. If he really has been abandoned, he’s not going to survive on his own for long. Remember when Adam first came to us? He couldn’t even fight.”
His chest ached as loneliness crept in. He really was desperate to see Dean again – he couldn’t take not knowing the fate of their relationship and he could kick himself for all the times he had chosen politics over Dean. He scoffed at himself for believing that he could move on from Dean once the election was over; there was no chance of that. He was in love with the man and his heart would break into a thousand fragments if he had to think too long about losing him. Why had he scolded Dean every time he had pointed out that their relationship could work? Why had he told Dean that they could never be together? He had been naïve and ignorant and if he had only listened to Dean, he would be happy right now. Instead, their relationship was in limbo and Castiel was talking to a camera lens with no idea if Dean was even watching.
Castiel shook his head in exasperation. “Because if I was in your place, I would have strangled at least half of the nest by now.”
“My parents promise these strangers money and status if they can get me to marry them. They don’t care who they’re setting me up with as long as they’re rich, upper class, and of traditional vampire blood; anything to make me less of a disgrace.”
Warmth spread from Dean’s chest through every vein and artery at his rival’s sincere smile. The tone of Castiel’s words curled around him like a large, fluffy blanket, cocooning him in soothing and happiness. Dean had never relished a simple smile as much as he did Castiel’s.
Castiel gave an almost imperceptible nod, refusing to meet Dean’s gaze. “I didn’t say any of that to hear it back from you. I believed it would be the end for me and I… I wanted you to know.” He cleared his throat quietly. “I just… didn’t expect to be brought back.”
“I’m stating a fact,” Dean said, more seriously. “I would never mock or ridicule the LGBTQA community, or Mr. Novak, in any way. Nor would I lie to American citizens about my own preferences.”
He crept towards the strange noises, grateful for the surrounding trees concealing his position, and his eyes widened when he found Cas wriggling beneath another flying fox – this one entirely black from head to tail.
Castiel wondered who Andrew was and if he had a family who was worried over why he hadn’t yet returned home. Perhaps he was like last year’s sacrifice; homeless and without a family to launch a missing person’s investigation.
Adam wrinkled his nose and backed up. “Stop calling me that. It’s weird. My name’s Adam.” He watched Jack’s ears fall. “Why are you on the floor? Get up.”
The reporter glanced at him in distaste and Dean was dismayed to find that her hatred for him hadn’t lessened any over four years.
The next time Dean crossed paths with his rival was quarter past eleven in the evening at Seitz Park on the twenty-fifth of September. It was entirely coincidence and Dean wouldn’t have even spotted Castiel had the older man not blurted his name in surprise.
It had been a long, bumpy road to this point, filled with arguments and apologies and Dean being confused by his own identity whilst Cas struggled with abandonment and trust issues. They were still learning, even now, but Castiel was certain that Dean truly did love him and the way he was treated by Dean was so different to how he was treated by Bartholomew that he had to wonder how he had ever loved the other vampire.
“Tell Bart we said hi,” he winked before he dragged Castiel towards the door. As they turned their backs on a steaming Anna, Dean slapped his palm over Castiel’s ass and squeezed in full view of his sister.
Sam scowled and leaned back in his chair. “Ouch. Glad to hear that our friendship means so much to you.”
Michael shrugged and shook his head tiredly. “I don’t know, but Castiel looked happy with them. Gabriel was willing to die for them…”
Cas’ smile was infectious and Dean found himself reciprocating. He squeezed the angel’s shoulder in a subtle promise and was about to urge Cas to help him once more when suddenly, a dark, dripping limb shot towards Castiel and wrapped around his waist.
Sam snorted and shook his head to clear the shock from his face. “Yeah, no. I don’t think anyone expected
“How about you give me something to remember you by?” Lucifer purred beside his ear. “Something to get me through the long weeks without you…”
getting the position.” He fixes Sam with a raised eyebrow. “I don’t want to spend the next however-long-they-expect-us-to-work-here wiping an angel’s rich ass every time he takes a shit. I made sure there was no way I was getting picked. Meet you by the car.”
“No need to rub it in,” winked Dean and he watched in fascination as the spark vanished from the Democrat’s eyes. Castiel brought his glass to his lips with a mumbled “Oh.”
“If it were a case of want, I’d have your jeans around your ankles and your cock down my throat,” Castiel growled, squeezing Dean’s neck gently to emphasise the point – a feat that had Dean instantly hard and aching. “I’d swallow you down and suck you off until you spilled onto my tongue,” Castiel continued as his free hand drifted down Dean’s stomach to settle over his tented crotch.
