Pausing for only a moment, a simple “yes” was all it took from Castiel for Dean’s mood to immediately lighten. He pulled Cas in for another kiss, and after a few minutes they parted reluctantly, knowing if they didn’t stop now they were never going to make it out of the house. Holding hands as they headed out the door, Dean prepared himself to introduce the two most important people in his life to each other.
“Thanks Sammy, it really means a lot to me, I mean it. Would you mind helping me get ready for tonight? I'm a nervous wreck, and I’ve still got four hours before I’m meeting Cas.”
Dean discovers that sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you try something new.
There was that wink again, and damn if it wasn’t the most attractive, simple gesture, anyone had ever given Dean. He could feel the blush returning to his face, and took a few quiet breaths to try and calm himself.
When Dean continued to avoid eye contact, Sam decided there was only one way to handle this. Before Dean knew what hit him, he was sprawled on his back, pinned by his 6’4” moose of a brother.
Cas turned back towards Dean to acknowledge that he had heard him, giving him a little wave, and disappearing into his car. As Dean watched him drive away, he couldn’t help but smile to himself, wondering how he had gotten so lucky as to meet someone as special as Cas. The smile lingered on Dean’s face long after he had settled into bed for the night, thoughts of Castiel and their kiss still on his mind as he slipped into the most peaceful sleep he’d had in ages.
(See the end of the chapter for
By Dean’s fourth Friday there, Castiel is intrigued by the green eyed man who comes in weekly, and tries something new each visit. Most people who come in on a regular basis order the same thing. Castiel prides himself on knowing most of his regular's orders by heart. He wants to say something to the man, at least introduce himself, but every time he tries, the man seems to get flustered, thanking him quickly, and finding something to preoccupy himself with until his drink is ready. His shyness surprises Castiel, but intrigues him even more. He knows his name is Dean Winchester, that much he has gotten from his credit card information. Castiel has been keeping track of what the man orders each week, so he decides on his next visit to make him something he hasn’t ordered yet, and use it as a way to introduce himself. He knows that Dean had a vanilla latte his first visit there, and a mocha frappe, an Irish cream hot chocolate, and a caramel macchiato in the following weeks since. He wants this drink to be special, something he’s sure that Dean will enjoy, something as beautiful as he is. It may be a little forward, but it is definitely a conversation starter, and if things go well, may turn into more.  Castiel can only hope.
A rhetorical question. Maybe. Dean steps even closer, a hands-width apart from the beekeeper.
Yet, there’s a glint in Dean’s eyes that wasn’t there before. “Only good, huh?”
“Interesting.” Cas draws away to look at Dean—to look at him fully—like the way he did in Hell. He can’t see Dean’s soul anymore, but there’s still something about the man that makes him shine just as bright. “Since I’ve known you—in all the time I’ve known you—we tend to run circles around this one thing. Worthiness. But this isn’t about that.”
All he can think about is—he feels a hand at his elbow, guiding him backwards into a dry area.
, Castiel thinks. He presses a kiss into Dean’s hair.
He falls to the ground, knees stinging.
Cas is a dead weight in Dean’s arms, no life to him. Dean cannot breathe, too afraid that something has happened.
There’s a distinct furrow between Sam’s brow that will stay there for the rest of his life. Sammy tugs one of Dean’s hands towards him and places a kiss directly into his palm in exactly the same way the book Dean read to him earlier had it.
Mostly, these sounds become songs. Led Zeppelin sometimes, Queen others, but recently it’s been Hey Jude. Dean won’t—can’t—verbalize how safe it makes him feel.
Dean swallows roughly. Looks at something other than Cas. “Yeah.”
“Like what?” Dean sounds confused. He shifts in his seat. There’s the look in his eyes that Cas can’t place.
Castiel draws further into himself, one hand on the door handle. He looks frightened, ready to run.
Before Dean can say anything, the waitress arrives—big smile, bright lipstick. “Welcome to Maria’s! What can I get for you?” Her gaze falls expectantly on Castiel.
Dean shakes his head. He wants to say something, but nothing comes out.
Dean barks out a short laugh. Stares at the shattered glass. It takes a moment for the shock to settle in, hands tugging at his hair.
Her room is dark, lit only by the soft glow of a salt lamp.
The other man avoids Dean’s questioning look, eyes fixated on his shoes instead.  “I wouldn’t leave without saying thank you.”
There’s an immediate shift in Dean’s posture. He draws inwards, shoulders hunched over. Cas’ immediate reaction surprises him; he doesn’t ever want to see Dean this distraught again.
Cas leans in again, whispering against Dean’s lips, “Don’t you ever forget it,” before he kisses him again.
Is it worth finding out who Sam—and Dean—really are and learning about hunting? But then she thinks how lonely she’s been over the last week and Dean's last words.
He turns around to a grinning Dean with an empty plate. It astounds him how fast that man can eat.
Something’s changed since Cas’ death. It doesn’t look like a home. It looks devoid of light, of warmth. Dean hasn’t stepped outside his room. Every time he tries, the bunker seems too vast, too cold.
Dean frowns. “No?”
Dean’s stuck. Frozen. California is off-limits, especially because he knows Sam’s there. And Sam ran away. Sam left.
The nightmares, when they come, are something else.
A curt nod. “Yes. I need to go to California.”
, Cas thinks,
“Good news, Cas! Looks like it’s stopped raining. Want to head back?” Dean doesn’t even wait for an answer before heading towards the front door.
Dean gives Castiel another glance, deciding in that moment to do something rash. “You wanna come with me?”
“Did you?” Jess steels herself, opens her eyes only to stare down Dean. Something breaks in her. Maybe it’s her past self.
On those nights, he’ll drag his way out of bed—sweat-soaked and trembling—and just stare at the door.
Jack had told him this before—how the Empty wanted him, how it would do anything to make him stay.
Cas fills the silence. “I know you think you aren’t deserving, but you are.” The ex-angel wraps a hand underneath Dean’s shoulders, a way to keep him together. A slight wetness makes Cas reel back, only to find that a few tears have slipped down Dean’s cheeks.
“Can I help?”
It’s a startling thing to realize. Cas is gone. And for some reason, this feels different. Maybe it’s because it’s Chuck or this big ending or the way that their existence has been reduced down to a deity’s plaything.
. So Cas really is going to spill 30 jars worth of honey all over himself. Huh. Maybe it's unusual for a person to see their life flash before their eyes this way, but it’s definitely on Cas’ mind. The glass shards, the sticky honey, a scraped chin.
Dean reaches up for another sheet of joss paper. The silence is so loud he can’t hear himself think. One lotus flower becomes two, becomes three.
There’s a moment between Dean’s final words and Cas’ decision. He crosses over the other side of the table, brushing shoulders and placing his hand over Dean’s. “I slice, you drink. It’s not going to kill you, I’ve put too much honey in it for that.”
And if Cas is to be honest with himself,
Dean’s arms are warm around his body, one hand splayed out across his back, steadying him. The baker steps forward, taking more of Cas’ weight and trying to get him settled. It shifts him closer to Dean.
Dean has never looked more pentinent than he does right now—eyes fixed on Castiel’s face, unwavering—than in the time since Castiel dragged him out of Hell.
She lunges forward to stop the music, only to find Dean stealing quick glances her way.
“Careful there,” a voice says. Cas involuntarily freezes. Not Dean Winchester. Not him
“I’m fine.” It’s partly a lie—he can’t feel his face, but he’s not about to tell Dean that. The embarrassment is setting in fast. It’s like he can’t look at Dean now, now that he’s admitted to himself that he likes the other man.
Something heavy drapes over her shoulders. It smells like Dean and she finally realizes it’s his leather jacket. It fits her just right; her hands grasp it wildly.
It’s not like he’s going to initiate a hug fest with his brother. He’s still adamant about the
He presses a kiss to Cas’ hair.
Dean waits, taps his fingers on the steering wheel. Finally, the guy nods. He clambers up and into the Impala, one hand gripping a tattered backpack with a death grip.
The ache in his chest subsides, a slow, dull roar rather than sharp pain.
“I would thank you not to disparage my scooter, Dean. It is a very dependable vehicle.”
A voice in his head whispers how wrong it is. Dean looks away.
“I don’t know, Sammy. I don’t—he’s gone. He’s just gone.”
There’s a second—just one split second—where time stops. Where Dean is just staring down at Cas.
Castiel stares back down at the menu, hands clutched tight around the edges. He seems
Dean’s speechless. There are no words for this moment, for what he can have for the rest of his life. He’s never been particularly good at words, at articulating what he feels. It’s always been easier to reach out and do things. All action, no words. It’s easier to jump into bed than deal with the consequences of his emotions.
Seeing the guilty expression on Castiel’s face made Dean want to kiss it right off. He reached his hand up behind Cas’s head, lacing his fingers in his hair, gently pulling him back down, catching his lips in the process. The action caught Castiel off gaurd, and he let out a small “hmpf” of surprise, before relaxing back into Dean. Not wanting to push things, he decided to follow Dean’s lead, allowing him to set the pace. They laid in the back seat for hours, kissing, talking, and simply enjoying each other’s company. Neither of them wanted the evening to end, yet they knew that sleep was necessary, both men having to work early in the morning. Reluctantly climbing out of the car, Dean walked Cas to his own, giving him one last kiss, and watching him drive away. Dean was aware that he and Cas would need to have a serious conversation, sooner than later, but still high on the events of the evening, he couldn’t find it in himself to worry about that right now. He drove home, and slept peacefully for the second night in a row.
They tried to keep their focus on the game, but neither could manage to keep their hands to themselves for more than a few minutes, finally deciding to turn in their items and head out. They barely made it to the car before they were tangled in each other’s arms again. Fumbling with the door, they not-so-gracefully climbed into the back seat, Dean sprawling out on his back with Cas hovering closely above him. Heated kissing turned to wandering hands, and Dean’s breath hitched in his chest as he felt Cas reaching towards the buckle of his jeans. Panic washing over him, Dean grabbed for Cas’s hand to stop him, causing Cas to pause and give him a questioning look. Dean scrubbed a hand down his face, releasing the breath he’d been holding. “Sorry, Cas. I didn’t mean to ruin the mood.” Dean started to apologize, but Cas was quick to stop him from going further.
“Where have you been all my life, handsome?” Dean whispered, still slightly breathless.
“Now, we get you ready for a date.” Sam beamed.
This story started out as a quick head canon, and has evolved into something so much more. Thank you for reading!
“I understand Dean, and while I know we’ve only just met, would you be interested in going out to dinner sometime? Tomorrow, if you’re not busy? It would give us a chance to work on your communication skills, so really it would be like community service for me.” Cas teased, followed up by a wink.
“It doesn’t matter where I’ve been, it only matters that I’m here now, with you. I mean that, Dean.  I thoroughly enjoyed your company this evening, and can’t wait to see you again. Are you free tomorrow? You can pick the place if you would like, seeing as I chose tonight's location.”
“Be down in a minute, Dean.” Sam responded from his bedroom.
“Hey Sammy can we talk? It’s important.” Dean called up the stairs.
Once they were back outside, no longer having the separation of the table as a barrier between them, Dean’s shyness took over him once again. Cas noticed immediately, and before Dean knew what was happening, Cas had closed the distance between them, wrapping an arm around Dean’s waist and pulling him in for a kiss. It was soft and sweet, and Dean found himself leaning into it, eyes fluttering shut, chasing Castiel’s lips for more. After a few moments, Dean pulled back breathlessly, eyes still closed. When he finally dared to open them, he found a smiling Cas staring back at him. Dean’s cheeks were flushed now for a completely different reason, one that had nothing to do with his prior embarrassment, and everything to do with the man standing in front of him, a goofy grin still plastered on his face.
Having forgotten completely about the food, Dean turned his attention back to his tray as Castiel headed downstairs for more coffee,  leaving Dean to enjoy the remainder of his breakfast.
Getting it together would be a lot easier if those insistent butterflies in his stomach would calm down.
At that moment, the waitress returned with their drinks, and Dean realized he hadn’t even looked at the menu yet. Who was he kidding? On the rare occasion that he and Sam went out, Dean always ordered the same thing, a bacon cheeseburger and fries. At home, Dean did most of the cooking, but Sam was constantly lecturing him about cholesterol and the lack of leafy green vegetables in his life, so it was an indulgence when he got to enjoy a burger. Dean was silently thankful he could eat one tonight without suffering through the usual commentary from his brother. Seeming to find it a good choice, Cas decided to order the same thing. “Instead of my usual, I’ll have what he’s having.” As the waitress left, Dean gave Cas a look. “Hope my bad habits aren’t rubbing off on you, Cas. Wouldn’t want you breaking routine because of me.” Dean teased, relaxing a bit. He was going to have to loosen up if he was going to make it through this date.
Sam comes home to a nervous Dean, and Dean has no choice but to fill his brother in on his recent activities.
“My apologies Dean, I didn’t mean to be so forward. I got your name off of your credit card information. I’ve tried to introduce myself several times, but it hasn’t seemed to work out...” Cas proceeded cautiously. Dean gave Cas an affirming nod, still temporarily struggling to regain the ability to speak. “I hope you don’t mind, but I’ve taken the liberty of preparing something for you. I’ve noticed you never order the same drink twice, and I don’t believe you’ve had the pleasure of trying this yet. It’s my best seller.” Cas didn’t want to appear like a crazy stalker, so he didn’t dare tell Dean that he’d kept track of everything he’d ordered over the past few weeks, knowing full well he hadn’t previously tried the beverage Cas had currently prepared for him. He simply waited for Dean to respond.
When they were together, they were usually wrapped up in each other’s arms in some way. The need for physical contact was overwhelming, and who were they to deprive themselves? Sam teased them constantly, calling Dean needy, Dean just returning the comment with a smile and an affirming nod.
“Not a she, Sammy, his name’s Cas.” Dean said through a barely audible whisper.
I told myself I wasn't taking this story here, but these boys just would not behave themselves. I tried to keep them apart, but the gravitational pull was too strong.
Sam listened intently to everything Dean said, and when he finished, they sat there in silence. After what seemed like forever in Dean’s mind, Sam finally spoke. “Dude, since when do you drink frappes?”
Dean continued to try and wrestle his way out of Sam’s grip, but eventually he gave up, knowing fully that he wasn’t going anywhere until Sam was satisfied with Dean’s response. Finally accepting defeat, Dean proceeded to tell Sam everything, starting back at the beginning, with his first trip to the cafe.
Dean was seriously starting to wonder if this guy was too good to be true. He always told Sam to quit overthinking everything. It was time he started taking his own advice. He pushed any thoughts of doubt to the back of his mind, turning his focus towards the gorgeous man standing in front of him, holding a tray full of delicious smelling food.
They sat around the table, enjoying sandwiches and iced tea, random conversation laced within the silence of their meal. When lunch was finished and the kitchen was clean, they moved to the living room. Their conversation continued into the evening, stopping only when Sam retrieved left overs for a late supper.  Cas was seated on the couch, Dean sprawled out with his head laying in Castiel’s lap. As Cas gently ran his fingers through his hair, Dean found himself struggling to remain conscious with each passing minute. It wasn’t long before he was snoring softly, and Cas couldn’t help but find it absolutely endearing.
Thank you for taking the time to read...hope you enjoy the next chapter!
“I love you too, Dean.” Cas could not contain his smile anymore than Dean could, and the two sat there with matching grins on their faces. After a few moments of staring at each other, Cas broke the silence. “Not trying to change the subject, but I would like you to eat before it gets cold.”
Cas adjusted his position slightly to allow Dean access, and Dean slowly worked Cas open with his fingers. Dean was exceptionally gentle, and within minutes, Cas found himself relaxed enough to continue. He climbed onto Dean, sinking down on him slowly, until he could feel Dean filling him up completely. They rocked their hips slowly, small circles gradually building into something more desperate, and before long both men were moaning each other’s names through their shared orgasms. Cas leaned forward, resting his forehead against Dean’s, slowly regaining his breath. Dean took Cas’s hands in his, holding them against his chest. They remained there in comfortable silence,  foreheads resting together, and Cas could feel Dean’s breath puffing lightly against his collarbone. After a few moments they pulled apart from each other, Dean releasing Castiel’s hands so that he could stand up, slowly climbing off of Dean. Cas disappeared for a moment, grabbing a towel from behind the counter, and when he returned he gently cleaned Dean and then himself.
Sam was happy for his brother. He had sacrificed so much in his life for Sam’s sake, and he deserved this more than anyone else Sam knew. And Sam had grown to love Castiel just as much as he loved his brother. They’d become close over the past six months that he and Dean had been dating. As Sam watched Dean drive away, he couldn’t help but think about the fact that not only was Dean going to have a husband, but Sam was going to have another brother.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean continues to sneak off to the coffee shop while Sam is gone to class on Friday mornings, and Castiel is intrigued by his new weekly visitor.
The certainty and emotion in Dean’s voice brought tears to Sam’s eyes, and he quickly wiped them away as he pulled Dean in for a crushing hug. “Of course I’ll marry you and Cas. I’ll have to get ordained, but that shouldn't be difficult. I’m honored that you’re trusting me with something as important as this.”  After a few minutes as Sam began to pull away, he smirked, trying to lighten the mood. “I just need to know, which one of you is wearing the dress?”
“Thanks Sammy.” Dean replied sheepishly, still not good at being on the receiving end of compliments, even from his little brother. “Wish me luck, I need as much as I can get.”
“It’s been awhile since I’ve been around anyone other than my brother Sam and my boss, and apparently I’ve forgotten how to speak.” Dean tried to lighten the mood. “I’m just not great at meeting new people and small talk. I’m sorry if I appear as though I’m not enjoying this, because I assure you I am.” Dean managed a small smile, even though his heart was racing, and felt a little more at ease when Cas returned it.
A simple slice of Pecan pie turns into an unexpected evening.
He checked his phone, surprised yet thankful, that he wasn’t waking up to a handful of missed calls and text messages from his brother. Granted, Dean was a grown man, but preoccupied with more important things, he had forgotten to let Sam know he wasn’t coming home last night, and it was in Sam’s nature to worry. Hard as he tried, the kid couldn’t help it, and Dean admired that about him, even if it did drive him crazy sometimes.
“I’d like that Cas. Can I think about the place and get back to you in the morning?” It was then that Dean realized they hadn’t exchanged phone numbers. Cas, prepared as always, reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card with his number on the bottom. Dean accepted it graciously. Cas leaned forward, quickly pecking a kiss on Dean’s cheek. “Until tomorrow.” Before Dean could react, Cas turned to head to his car.
“You ass.” Dean chuckled. “You are so going to pay for that.” With one swift movement, Dean managed to spin them both around, reversing their positions. He pinning Cas in his arms, pinching his sides so quickly that Cas couldn’t catch his hands. He leaned into Dean, head tipped back against his shoulder, giggles flowing easily.
Sam took a moment to process the words that had just come out of Dean’s mouth. A date? Where had Dean been that someone would have asked him out on a date? Sam hadn’t seen his brother go anywhere in ages, other than work, and he was sure he hadn’t met anyone there. Only one way to find out…
Dean gave Sam’s shoulder a playful shove, and then pulled him into a headlock, messing up his hair, earning himself a disapproving “hey” from his brother. Releasing Sam’s head so he could stand up straight again, his look turned serious once more.
“No problem, Dean. Let’s go pick out your clothes. Can’t go with your usual attire for such a special occasion.”
“Would you like to spend the night with me, Dean?” Cas asked,  hoping for a yes.
“Okay, okay!” Dean held his hands up in front himself in surrender. He took a deep breath and blurted out “ would you like to meet Sam?”
“Do you have plans today, Cas? I know it’s Saturday, wasn’t sure what you usually do on the weekend? I can go if you need to be somew—hmpf” Dean was nervously starting to ramble and Cas stepped over to place a kiss on his lips, cutting him off mid sentence, before he could finish his thought.
He stood up, allowing Dean the ability to lift his hips, Castiel removing Dean’s jeans and boxers, and laying his discarded shirt across the seat, so Dean wouldn’t have to sit on the cold leather. Dean sat back down, and Cas removed his own clothing before resuming his position on Dean’s lap. Suddenly, very aware of the fact that he and Cas were completely naked, Dean found himself losing some of the confidence he’d gained only moments before. Sensing the change, Cas took Dean’s face in his hands, kissing him slowly and softly. Dean calmed immediately, slowly releasing the tension he had felt building. As they continued to kiss, he could feel Cas hardening against him, and Dean decided to take the scenic route with his hands, tracing a path down Castiel’s back, palming his ass, and then running his hands up and over the creases of Castiel’s thighs, until his hands reached their destination. When Dean’s hands brushed against their erections, Cas broke the kiss, moaning so loudly Dean was certain someone would hear them from outside.
When he returned, Dean was just coming out of the bathroom, having finished eating and getting dressed as well.
Castiel took a moment to process what Dean had just told him. It certainly explained a lot, especially Dean’s shy demeanor, and while there was no way he could have known, it also made Cas feel terrible for pushing so quickly towards something Dean was unfamiliar with.
“My apologies, Dean, I didn’t mean to startle you.” Cas gave him an apologetic look, as Dean tried to regain his composure.
Dean has important plans for his and Castiel's six month anniversary. First he needs to talk to Sam.
Regaining the use of his vocal cords, Dean proceeded to thank Cas for the drink, taking it gratefully. He looked down at the perfect heart sitting on top of the beverage, and flushed a deep shade of red. Trying to play it cool, Dean ignored his rising blush, opting to reach for his wallet instead, but Cas held up a hand, insisting it was on the house. When Cas asked if Dean would like to sit down and chat for a few moments, the simply nod was all the affirmation that Cas needed, and the two men found an open booth against the window. They sat there for a few moments in awkward silence, and Cas wondered if he had in fact made the wrong decision in introducing himself to Dean in the way that he had. “I apologize Dean, I can’t help but feel that I’m making you uncomfortable. I can certainly get back to work if you would prefer.”
Well there was the million dollar question that Dean was most certainly not prepared to answer. The fact that “she” was actually a “he”,  and “YES!” Dean wanted to scream.
Sam could see Dean visibility deflate as he released the breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “Nothing’s wrong Sam, I’ve just gotten myself into a situation I don’t know how to deal with.” When Sam gave him a look like he was going to strangle him if he didn’t continue, Dean decided not to press his luck. “I got asked out on a date.” Dean blurted out, immediately looking down, suddenly finding his shoes the most interesting objects in the room.
“Dean, please don’t apologize. I didn’t mean to rush things, and I certainly don’t want to push you into something you’re not ready for. If anything, I should be the one apologizing. We’ve only just met, and I didn’t mean to put you in an uncomfortable position.”
“Dean” Cas warned “don’t make me force it out of you.” He teased, advancing on Dean playfully.
It started out as nothing more than a way to kill some time while waiting for Sammy to get done with his Friday morning gen ed class at the local community college.  Sam normally carpooled with a fellow classmate, but Jess had come down with a cold, and Dean had offered to give him a ride. Not wanting to take the time to drive back home, to almost have to turn immediately around, Dean decided to find himself a cup of coffee, having left the house before his usual pick me up. Driving past the downtown shops, he spotted an internet café called The Bees Knees, with the slogan Come In and Bee Yourself, in big bright letters across the front window. Intrigued, he decides to find a place to park and investigate.
Dean walked in and looked at the menu and was taken aback by all of the choices.
“It’s not like that Cas. I just, I need to tell you something.” Dean took another shaky breath, trying to get the words out.  “I, uh, I’ve just...” Dean trailed off, avoiding eye contact. After another breath, he found the courage to look at Cas and finish his sentence. “I’ve just never been with a man before.”
“I’d like that very much Cas. After that, we definitely deserve cuddles.” Dean’s face held the goofiest grin, and Cas returned it with one of his own.
Right on cue, Dean walks into the cafe Friday morning at 8:15. Castiel has made sure to prepare his ice-breaking drink of choice ahead of time, just soon enough to have it ready when Dean enters. Either Dean will turn and walk out, or will finally speak to him. Castiel is hoping for the latter. Dean is a few customers back yet, and Castiel can see him fumbling with the hem of his T-shirt as he waits in line. When Dean finally reaches him, Castiel hands Dean the drink he’s made for him, before he can hesitate and change his mind.  It’s a simple latte with a foam heart on top. Dean approaches the counter with a look of confusion on his face. When he doesn’t immediately turn and walk away, Castiel decides to take advantage of his momentary confusion to speak.
“Give it up Dean, you’re not going anywhere. At least    not until you tell me who Cas is, what happened, and how it ended with you going on a date tomorrow.” Sam said matter of factly.
“Awe, Sammy, you know I get all warm and fuzzy inside when you get protective over me.” Dean kept up the teasing, and now it was Sam’s turn to blush, cheeks flushing immediately.
It’s been several weeks of Dean’s secret Friday visits, and though he hasn’t been keeping track, he’s afraid to see just how much he’s spent on these weekly indulgences. He’s choosing to ignore it, just as he’s choosing to ignore the insistent fluttering in his stomach, every time the man behind the counter looks his way, and that pair of blue eyes locks on his. He is by far the most gorgeous man Dean Winchester has ever laid eyes upon. Even if he didn’t enjoy the caffeine rush he gets from his weekly fix, he’d continue to spend an absurd amount of money on frilly beverages, just to get a glimpse of those baby blues peeking out from behind the coffee machines. That in itself is enough of a fix on it’s own to send him on a whole different kind of high, that has nothing at all to do with caffeine. Dean had overheard enough conversations to know that the man’s name is Castiel, and he is the owner of the cafe. Now if only he could muster up the courage to introduce himself...
“All good, Cas. I guess I wasn’t paying attention. Didn’t hear you come up behind me.” Dean could feel the blush rising in his face, quickly turning away for a moment, trying, yet failing to hide it. Castiel couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at the corners of his lips, as Dean’s freckles began to appear through the pink of his cheeks, making him look more adorable than ever. Dean scuffed the toe of his boot on the ground, avoiding his gaze, until he could feel the heat in his face slowly dissipating. After a few moments, Dean glanced up at Cas, giving him a nod, indicating he was ready to head inside. Cas proceeded to the door, holding it open for Dean. As Dean approached the open door, he pause for a moment to take in Castiel's outfit, faded jeans and a button up, the perfect shade to bring out the blue in his eyes even more so than usual.
“Looking forward to it, Cas. I’ll see you tomorrow, thanks again for the coffee.” Dean managed. When Cas turned to head back behind the counter, Dean all but slammed his head down on the booth’s table. What had he gotten himself into? He had a date. A DATE! Dean didn’t know how to date. When was the last time he had even went out with someone, other than for a few beers with his brother?  As realization settled in, followed by panic, he knew there was no way around it, he was going to have to tell Sam.
“Often enough. I usually eat at the cafe, but this place is a convenient alternative when I’m in the mood for something different.” Cas responded simply, backing off on the flirting a bit. He could see he was going to have to take the evening slow. He didn’t want to scare Dean away, and the man seemed to flush at the slightest attention.
“You come here often?” Dean asked, choosing to ignore the teasing statement from the other man.
The unbridled honesty and emotion that Castiel spoke with caught Dean off guard, overwhelming him for a moment. Eventually his brain managed to catch up with his emotions, and he trusted himself to at least attempt to speak.
“Oh ho, he can sass back.” Cas grinned, warming slightly, as Dean reciprocated with a grin of his own, rather than more bashfulness. Not that Cas minded. As much as he wanted Dean to open up and share things with him, the shyness that Dean emanated was an equally enduring quality that Castiel found himself seeking more of. He supposed that could wait. Dean seemed to be relaxing a bit, and Cas didn’t want to impede any progress he had made. There would be plenty of time in the future for teasing moments, Cas could only hope.
Sam managed to calm Dean’s nerves enough that together, they were able to accomplish the task of picking out Dean’s attire for the following evening. They decided on jeans and a simple black T-shirt. The outfit, of course, would be completed with Dean’s leather jacket. It had been a gift from their uncle Bobby, and Dean never went anywhere without it. Cas had mentioned that the diner was a few doors down, and Dean had taken the the liberty of checking it out after leaving the café, so he at least had a vague idea of where they would be spending their evening together. Now that he was here, waiting for Cas to arrive, his prior knowledge did nothing to alleviate the panic that was taking him over, little by little. Trying to focus on calming himself down, Dean failed to hear Cas approach him, nearly jumping out of his skin when he felt the tap on his shoulder.
Cas placed the tray in Dean’s lap, and climbed on the bed to sit next to him. Dean was grateful that Cas had taken the time to make him breakfast. He was starving. There was eggs, bacon, toast, fresh fruit, and coffee, more than enough for both of them, but Cas gave no indication that he planned on joining him.  “Aren’t you going to eat?” Dean motioned towards the tray.
“I’m asking Cas to marry me tonight.” Dean blurted out before he lost his moment of courage.
Cas made Dean feel things he didn’t even know were possible, and he barely knew the guy. How was he going to get through a date, he barely made it coherently through a five minute introduction.
They’ve got work to do.
Dean sure as hell feels like he’s in one now.
Cas moves toward the kitchen island, clutching the edge of it until his knuckles are white.
Dean grins, a half-smile that makes his dimples show. “So, you gonna let me drive you home now? Or would you rather keep shivering to death on your tiny ass motorcycle?”
He leads her back towards the car, letting her lean against the doorframe.
Dean tries to breathe in.
“It’s okay, Dean. Beloved, it’s okay. Just breathe.” Cas’ voice is rough like it always is, but it’s calming, like it always is. Dean breathes out, slowly. He closes his eyes. Focuses on what he feels in the moment, like the motion of Cas carding his fingers through Dean’s hair.
It’s a few minutes and then some before everything’s ready and Cas is walking out of the kitchen, only to find that Dean has his eyes closed, slumped back and head laying on the back of the couch.
Dean hums, eyes still closed. “Maybe learning one more time wouldn’t hurt.”
“Knew I’d find it! Are these the ones Garth brings from two stalls down?”
Dean let out a small laugh. “Then a long time no see for me.”
Dean shies into himself, shaking his head. “Just a few more minutes?”
“Okay.” Castiel replies. He still hasn’t released his death grip on his backpack. “Okay.”
, she’ll call him when he reaches up and clasps her face between chubby hands. There’s something about this moment that never escapes Dean, even as he forgets how she looked, the way she did up her hair.
Sam hits it away.
“I promise.” It’s one of the easiest that Cas makes.
He’s—Jess can’t bring herself to admit it. Logically, abstractly, she knows that. But it hurts too much. Sam's not coming back.
He can’t stop staring at it. At the brokenness of it.
Dean becomes silent again. There's a beat, two beats before he continues softly, “I brought him home safe, I swear.”
, she thinks, but she can’t find her words. Sam enters the room—content, satisfied—and flips on the bed.
kind and
“It’s good,” Dean hums in affirmation. “It’s really good.”
“Oh.” The word resonates throughout the car. It seems louder than it should be. In all this time, Cas hadn’t really thought about the possibility of Dean paying attention to him the way Cas does Dean. “You’re right.”
Dean suppresses the urge to reach out and flatten the one near Cas’ temple.
“I don’t mean it like that!” Dean blurts everything out, dragging one hand through his hair. “I mean, I got a motel room. A hot shower, a bed. It’ll be below freezing tonight. Don’t make me keep driving thinking you’re dead.”
Dean gently smiles, dragging his hands down the sleeves of the jacket one last time before moving away and rummaging for something underneath the table. After a few seconds, he pulls out an umbrella.
It’s then, when he passes the library mirror, that he sees his reflection out of the corner of his eye. Cas’ handprint is still there on his jaw—stark red, slightly pinking around the edges. Dean’s breath catches. The handprint never fails to surprise him. He catches glimpses of it everywhere he looks—the car, the kitchen, the television screen.
“Sorry, man. I thought—I thought you left.”
“Are you so afraid to voice it? That it will disappear the moment you speak it into existence?” Cas ponders. Maybe this is it; Dean’s want conflated with his need to be seen, all wrapped up in the idea that he does not deserve it.
Cas has to laugh. Of all things—of all things to say when he can clearly see Dean fucking Winchester himself has had little to no sleep.
“It’s mine?” Cas squints at Dean, still a tiny bit weary. This Dean Winchester is a little bit
Cas fumbles with the crate, grasp ever more precarious. The crate leans forward, the momentum taking Cas with it.
A numb feeling overwhelms him. Stepping out of the abandoned house, opening the car door and driving to the crossroads—all of it is a blur.
“You doing okay now?” Interestingly, he ducks his chin to catch her eyes.
Finally—that gets a response. “Do you—do you have water?” It surprises Dean. The guy’s voice is raspy, but much deeper than Dean expected.
Castiel tilts his head. There’s a moment of silence that stretches out longer than Dean is comfortable with. It’s like all the air has disappeared.
Scrambling around to get at the cooler in the backseat, Dean is quick to grab a water bottle and hand it over. For a moment, he can’t help but watch the long line of the man’s throat as he tips his head back and drinks.
They leave, and Dean sits up, trying to triage the situation. His jeans are ripped, a slight cut across the knee. He wonders if the blood will come out.
Dean looks up at the words. It’s some sort of sweet talk, this—but even as he looks back at Cas, at the sincerity in his gaze, that he means it.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “
Any person looking at both Dean and Cas would probably just see two men being friendly with each other. However, Cas feels like he might explode. Calling Dean kind, calling him charismatic was dead wrong. Dean Winchester is a menace.
“Come here,” Cas prompts. And Dean goes.
Cas’ voice is quiet. Decisive, maybe. “Not again. Not if you promise the same thing.”  He wraps a hand around Dean’s wrist, pulse point against his thumb, before leaving a gentle kiss there.
They stand there, perhaps a few minutes, maybe hours. Jess harshly inhales, trying to stop crying. There’s nothing left to give.
Cas could rationalize it in the beginning by saying that is how Dean shows affection. Platonic, a budding friendship even. But the things the baker does slowly start to get more and more bizarre.
Dean Winchester is going to be the death of him.
“Great! I’ll bring you some next week.”
good.”
Cas really has stared at these too long. Traitorous stomach. It wouldn’t hurt to eat just a little, right?
Dean doesn’t wake up gently this time. There are nightmares and other things that he will never get completely rid of. And even now—when he is safe and well-rested and the world isn’t ending—that hasn’t changed.
But Cas isn’t expecting to hear what comes next.
“Then go back to sleep.” Cas answers. “We have all the time in the world.”
, but it seems more a lie than ever before. Cas sees it in the way that Dean holds his body, the way he will deny himself what he truly desires. Cas has only known the man for a year or so, but even he knows this.
He didn’t—he didn’t know what happened. What he did wrong.
“Something wrong?”
A spot of blood drips onto the page. Dean wipes it away, somehow deciding to get up.
“Do you know,” Cas asks mostly to himself, “that most people don’t understand the significance of the word temple? Most English speakers don’t.”
Dean’s lips quirk up into a smile.
He knows, logically, that he should wake Dean up. But he doesn’t want to. This feels right.
mention to anyone besides his friend Charlie, Dean actively gives him a neck massage after complaining of sleeping on it wrong.
“I might take you up on that offer.”
Determined though, he folds the corners first, slowly turning it into a lotus flower. It’s shitty, the first go around, and he almost throws it away in frustration.
Dean draws Cas close, cradling him, forehead to forehead. He brushes Cas’ hair away from his forehead.
Cas is right in that Dean Winchester will be the death of him. He just didn’t expect himself to be that much of a masochist too.
“I’d like to think so.” Dean looks behind him, checking his blindspots. “So, I’m taking you home?”
A slow smile breaks out on Dean’s face. He brings the thermos up to his mouth, holding it by the lid. Cas is about to throttle him. Could he not just hold it like any other normal person? Before he can think too much about acting on it, Cas turns back to the task at hand. It’s a fair minute before he hears Dean choke and turns to the side, knuckles white around the handle.
But even as they’re standing there, Jess starts to think. About everything—the blood, the fire, the sulphur smell she couldn’t get out of her clothes. She thinks about the hands pulling her out, the way sam looked.
It’s gentle, this touch—a brush of fingers against Cas’ jaw; Dean tilts the beekeeper’s head up to view the damage. There’s some blood, his upper lip already swelling up. Dean winces in sympathy.
People start to slowly file out of the viewing room, leaving just her and an empty coffin, when she notices someone slinking around in the back.
So he walks, walks out of the hospital and up on stage, and even when he seems healthy again—well, the touch doesn’t stop hurting.
Dean doesn’t want to explain
The ground quakes, disorientating him. He calls out for Cas. But there’s no answer. A second time, a third time, but still nothing.
Otherwise, days blur into days. Dean doesn’t see sunlight. He spends hours at a time in the library, reading until he’s blinking the sleep out of his eyes and still keeps going. Everything seems too desperate, and yet, he cannot stop.
Cas frowns a little bit. “Not particularly. If you think about it, time is relative to the person experiencing it. What’s long for you might not be long for me.”
Silence again. Castiel looks out the window, shifts his weight.
The way the other man says his name—softly, gently—makes Dean aware of how tightly he’s clinging to Castiel. He draws back, an apologetic look on his face. Pats Castiel’s shoulder in a half-hearted way.
Cas shakes his head, only hearing the last half of the question. “What?”
It’s stopped hurting.
Cas has stopped breathing. Things feel intense, he’s so focused on what Dean’s doing—a hand on his cheek, a hand on his waist, the slight tilt of his head.
Dean’s coughing into one elbow. He finally gets out, “Biscotti strips of bread. That’s a first for me.”
“We usually just cut them in half. But that reminds me—next week we’re making some biscotti. I can do that, you know.”
It doesn’t stop him from saying, “Bring him back.”
Cas clasps a hand around Dean’s wrist, pulls him back towards Cas. “I want you to.” There’s a tense sort of moment when Cas panics about screwing this up.
Dean braces himself, ready to throw a punch, but they’re too many. He gets shoved, then shoved again.
Dean nods dismissively. It wasn’t like it was a hardship, giving him the water. He tries again. “What’s your name?”
Dean reaches out and tousles Sam’s hair. It’s getting longer, and Dean has tried everything to stop John from cutting it. Sam seems happier with it.
Clearing his throat, Dean starts with, “Can you get me and my good friend Cas here two breakfast specials?” He looks up to make sure he’s got the waitress’ attention. “And two slices of key lime pie, please.”
The expression must be bad for Dean to put the tea and step closer. He crouches down just enough to look Cas in the eyes.
He is not worthy of this. Not of anything.
Soft touch is a foreign concept, and sometimes he will poke and prod at his bruises, looking at himself in the mirror and hissing at his body’s reaction.
Cas sighs and shakes his head, a sort of fondness growing in him.
It ends far too soon, Dean breaking away from Cas. The other man has a grin on his face, though he’s still cradling Cas’ face.
“I mean
The beekeeper pries the bag away from Dean, turns away from him.
It feels like there’s a whole different world here.
The flames lick their way around her body.
Cas exhales, the air stinging his cheeks. There would be a storm soon. The realization makes Cas close his eyes; he hates, hates the cold. He’s always bundled up in two different sweaters, especially when it draws closer to the end of the season.
There is no answer, but Castiel continues anyway.
Dean veers off the road, the flickering lights of an empty gas station illuminating the night sky. Before Cas can say anything, Dean is slamming the door of the Impala and stalking off.
Dean Winchester wakes up late. There’s no joke about four hours of sleep, no long nights staring at the ceiling. But the rattle in his chest, the ache he knows all too well, threatens to rear its head at any moment.
Dean taps the wheel. “Been taking care of her since I was 16 and started to drive. Fixed her up from a junk pile in my uncle Bobby’s scrapyard.”
Sighing to himself, Cas presses his hands together, trying to get some warmth back into his hands after the ride over here. The scooter is perhaps impractical for this type of weather, but Cas can’t deny that the crate fits perfectly on the rack he’s built for the back. And he’s nothing if not stubborn.
Dean reaches for the umbrella, signaling hurriedly for Cas to stay put before he opens the door and dashes around to the other side.
“Dean, please.” Neither him nor Cas are young men anymore; staying here certainly guarantees back pain when he wakes up.
When Dean tells him to go, it is with a flurry of wings and purpose. To be ordered around by a mere human, even as one so important as Dean Winchester, is unheard of. It’s unspeakable.
The contentment he feels is broken up by someone sitting down next to him.
Dean is asleep on the bed, legs akimbo but hands clenching the pillow. He’s likely in the throes of a nightmare. Cas strides forward, one hand outstretched to dispel them. The angel’s hand goes so far as to sink into the short hairs at Dean’s nape before the man snaps up, a gun in hand.
Cas reaches for another jar of honey, setting it down in front of Dean. “You drink this with tea. It’ll help.”
Cas is relatively dry, but his hair is damp and the temperature is just the right side of cold to make Cas shiver.
The man looks up, while his body curls up into a ball to conserve heat. It’s the eyes that strike Dean the most—a vivid, stark blue. Dean thinks he’ll remember the color of those eyes until he’s in the ground.
The implications of what Cas just said are too big, too much. Dean is not a temple, he is a graveyard.
After a moment, he reaches out for it, trying to grasp the long neck. It wobbles, teeters on the edge. For a minute, it’s like the world stills. Dean watches it in slow motion. The beer bottle wobbles for a second more before crashing down to the ground.
It’s been so long since anyone has touched him.
Dean remembers everything in clear, vivid detail—the way Cas opened his eyes, turning over on his side to cough out black gunk. Sam and Jack standing over them.
But Sam's gone.
And he leaves. Just like that.
She says,
Dean’s eyes fly open, emotions like pain  and worthlessness flitting across his face. He tries to turn away, but Castiel holds still. Makes Dean look at him.
“You need ice.”
“All right.” Dean’s voice is raspy.
And he can’t mourn Cas because there’s nothing left.
Jess looks at Dean in that moment, both of them vulnerable in the fact that something very different could have happened. But they’re here now, dealing with the consequences. It wasn’t Jess, but somehow she feels like it should have been.
There’s that silence again. Dean can feel the other man tracking him with his eyes.
, he thinks,
“Cas,” he starts. Words are failing him. “Feels good.”
cannot
“It’s not—”
Cas says nothing, still astounded that the baker is talking to him.
Her reflexes are quicker than she had imagined, all pent-up exhaustion and feral instinct. She pushes the person back into the wall, pressing her forearm against their chest. A slight groan escapes them.
“Dean Winchester. I saw your soul and it burned brighter than anyone I've ever seen. And I’ve been on this earth for a long time.”
Trying again, Dean continues, “Is there something you want?”
A quiet laugh escapes Dean. “It’s either this or going back to sleep.”
“Can I—again.” The words are a demand. Cas steps forward this time, hands braced against Dean’s shoulder, and goes in for a second kiss.
It’s funny, how he catches a glimpse of Cas out of the corner of his eye. The way the light streams through the window makes it seem like he has a halo. But even more so, it highlights the way Cas’ hair has cowlicks.
It roars to life, a startling rumble that makes Jess flinch. She settles into the seat, getting familiar with the inside. Everything is mostly dark, sleek, well maintained. Two dusty boot prints mark the inside upholstery.
He just isn’t expecting Cas to be able to corner him.
But when she opens her eyes, it’s to a sleek, black car. She
He watches Castiel’s eyes go wide. His backpack is clutched to his chest
“I’m Dean. Where're you coming from?”
God said not to covet, and here Cas is, looking at one Dean Winchester.
The press of Dean’s lips against his is not an electric shock; it’s something warm and inviting. It’s a slow slide into oblivion. Cas doesn’t want it to end, even as Dean tilts his head a fraction more, deepening the kiss and licking his way into Cas’ mouth. The baker draws his hands up into Cas’ hair, making it more disheveled than usual.
He watches as Dean stands up, stretching his hands over his head. The hem of his tee rides up again. Cas averts his eyes.
He’s seventeen now, all fresh rage and longing for a life he knows he can live, wants to live. Studying for the SATs, busting his ass on every test and paper.
Before Cas can object, Dean gathers both of them close, enveloping them in his. “Better?”
Cas sets the thermos down with a massive thunk. “Did you not use the honey? Your voice still sounds like
Castiel tilts his head. “You called me Cas. Both just now and before.”
“I assume that’s what we were talking about, yes. My brother’s there. He said he’ll help me.”
Moving away to stand up, Dean fiddles with the jars of honey, turning them left and right. “You know,” he continues, “when I was little, my mom would do the same thing—tugging on my gloves, making sure my jacket was zipped tight. She’d always kiss my forehead after.”
“Tell me. I have a right to know.”
Cas has enough wits to ask again. “What did you say?”
“Oh.” Cas is at a loss for words.
He grips an empty jar as he gets up slowly, creeping his way towards the origin of it. It’s probably not the best idea that he’s had, but it’s better than nothing.
He wants to shout,
He looks up at Castiel. “Cas, where’s yours?”
The whole world has ended. Is ending. A thousand white stars all collapsing on themselves.
“Yeah. I guess I did.” Dean wants to say more, but can’t find the words. Is it
But Dean is nothing if not infuriating, again, and so he doesn’t budge one inch.
. Cas can’t take this today. The idea that he has to interact with Dean and make coherent sentences is more terrifying than anything.
“Hey,” Cas says, looking back at him, “It’s okay.”
Dean claps one hand over Cas’ shoulder. The warmth soaks into the fabric of Cas’ sweater, something that Cas appreciates
The words blanket them with comfortable silence, though Dean’s cheeks become increasingly redder. The man tucks his face into the softness of Cas’ shoulder.
It also infuriates Cas. Nobody should be
“I was there! I saw him too!” They’re nose to nose now, stepping closer to each other in rage. “That
“Are you okay?” Dean asks, “You look more tired than usual.”
But there isn’t time to ask, Dean already pushing away from the table and standing up. The table sways a little. Dean stops. Frowns.
There’s a fluttering of wings, the sound so familiar he sways forward, trying to follow it. Instinctively, he thinks
tactile person Cas has ever encountered.
Nothing helps. Not really.
The next sentence doesn’t really surprise him though. “I lost them, I’m sorry.” It’s such a blatant lie that Cas is surprised by himself.
“Oh, 親愛的. That wasn’t your fault. Not saving a person doesn’t mean you killed them.”
So here they are.
The space between one second and the next is all it takes to ask, “Cas?”
Blood fills Dean’s mouth as he bites down on his tongue. He won’t cry. There’s no time to do so.
And—”
, Cas wants to say,
“It’s a Chinese dish I learned from my neighbor during my twenties. It’s called dàn bǐng, which means it’s egg wrapped up in a scallion pancake. Do you like it?”
“Yeah, man, always.” Dean takes the crate for Cas, hands brushing against the beekeeper’s as he does so. “Don’t want you to get drenched. Although I think we might have lost that fight already.”
(Later on, Cas asks Dean if by being with him he’ll allow Cas to finally help with the raspiness.
Dean drags his eyes—shot red and dark—over to look at Sam. “No.”
Dean doesn’t want anything, doesn’t want
Dean grabs socks from the dresser, turning around only to find Castiel hovering around the beds. “That one’s yours,” he says, gesturing to the bed next to the bathroom. He holds out the socks to Castiel. “Do you—do you want these? Heard that hands and feet tend to get cold quicker.”
“Yeah?” The baker’s voice is hesitant, almost breathless.
He has to start all over again. He tries to make friends. He really does. But he’s got scraped knees and old clothing from thrift stores and a raggedy backpack that looks like it’s gone through better days.
For the first time, Castiel—Cas—feels hunger. He has felt so many things over the past couple of months, but none so deeply as this. It’s different than before— this want has never been this deep, this ravenous. He wants, he
Dean wants to say no. He wants to draw back, run away. His heart beats faster. His eyes widen. Yet, the constant is Cas, here.
Dean is doing this, but it’s not like he’s going to oppose it.
Everything is a haze—him stumbling down the corridor, the lights flickering above. It doesn’t feel right, this world after Cas. It feels wrong, different. When he finally gets his door open, there’s a moment where he just forgets. Stands there, looking around his room. Dean eyes the beer bottle sitting on his dresser.
Sam laughs.
“No! No, I mean it’s better.”
Golden light fills the room as Cas heals Dean and suddenly the weight on Dean’s chest feels a bit lighter, his breathing less shallow from the broken ribs. The sensation makes the man rock back, eyes finally closing, as flesh knits itself back together.
Dean glances at Castiel. “Do you want anything more?”
He looks up at the striped awning, then across to the person. “Hello Dean.”
“What?”
“Are we getting up soon?”
that car.
“Don’t want anything, didn’t you hear? Dead inside, that’s me.” Dean laughs, a pale imitation of the real thing.
He’s pulled out of his thoughts by Cas’ voice asking, “Do you know it?”
Dean puts an arm around her, helping her to her feet. The gesture feels more comforting than Jess originally thought it would be.
It’s enough shock to his system that he has this, but it’s another thing to actually realize that it’s not going anywhere. The words that come from Cas are even more unbelievable.
It’s no use. Chin, meet edge of counter. Edge of counter, meet massive amounts of blood. Cas is ready to meet his fate.
. “Lead the way.”
After the weather shifts, Dean starts driving by his house to pick him up in Baby. Dean’s leather jacket—which Cas has learned is revered, is an heirloom from his mother—finds its place in Cas’ shoulders more often than not.
Dean looks up at the other man—at his blue, blue eyes, at the way he’s looking at Dean. Cas believes in him.
“Leave it, Cas.” Dean clenches his fist. Turns away.
Instead, he sticks the incense in the rice, the smoke trails just thick enough to cling to everything. Sam does the same.
Cas nods, watching as Dean’s hands trail down the side of the sleeves. He’s unsure about
Raising one hand in concession, Dean says, “Hey, man, not judging.”
Cas reaches for the door handle when Dean stops him.
A voice startles him, making his knees bump the table. Cas’ eyes snap open to watch the filled honey jars shake and then upwards to glare at the perpetrator.
Cas makes the accident of looking down at Dean’s lips. A brief thought of how they might kiss flashes through Cas’ imagination.
But if there’s one thing for certain, Dean Winchester will be the death of him.
Continuing, Cas remarks, “It is shameful, to me particularly, that after all the hard work I went to after to rebuild this body, you seem intent on harming it.”
“I can’t.”
Impatient, Dean tugs the paper bag from Castiel’s clenched fist. Opening it reveals a singular breakfast pastry topped with glazed apple. It takes Dean a minute in his excitement to realize that it’s only
Drawing closer, Dean rests his head on the ex-angel’s chest. Ear to breastbone. There’s a steady thump.
Dean rocks back on his heels, the motion soothing.
“Like
“Hate you?” Dean whirls around, stalking toward Cas. “
Dean looks over at Sam, all curled in on himself. His shoulders hunch, a defined slouch that Dean knows too well to dismiss. The way he looks at the incense, but turns away from it.
Dean settles for giving him a glare.
Before any of that happens, though, a hand is bracing his shoulder and there’s somebody in front of him shifting the crate to make it more secure between them. No more glass shards. Cas breathes a sigh of relief.
The question lingers in the air, Dean violently shuddering at the contact. His hands clench into fists. Cas grabs his wrist, pulling him around to look him in the eyes.
Before Dean knows what he’s doing, he’s striding over and pulling Castiel into a hug. It’s instinctive to tuck his face into the crook of the other man’s neck.
Dean Winchester shoves two loaves onto the table and retreats hastily back to his own booth. Cas looks down, slow from sleep deprivation, and finally figures out what Dean has just given him.
Usually Sam’s words make him see sense, but there’s currently a bullet in him so what exactly does Sammy want him to do?
, all the space between them is Cas’ doing. Because if Cas is honest, he loves Dean Winchester. He loves Dean fucking Winchester with the grey in his beard and his crow’s feet around his eyes and the surety with which he carries himself.
“甜心, 拜託! Cas! C’mon, please!”
Dean wakes to Jack staring at him in the dark.
And now here was Cas—alive and well. A Cas he just told
There’s something weary about the man, something that tugs at Dean and makes him feel protective.
Was that why Sam died?”
Dean turns his head, away from Castiel, and says
“Easy.” Cas’ voice is a rumble. “Stop thinking you think you don’t deserve this. We’re here. We’re alive. We’re real.”
“Why must you belittle my opinion of yourself? I know you just as well as you think you know yourself.”
At the funeral, one of her friends slipped her a pamphlet about the five stages of grief. Jess can see them clearly—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
Wrangling themselves out the door and down to Maria’s Diner is easy. It’s quiet, especially in the early morning.
in front of Dean Winchester. “Almost dropped this.”
There’s a silence that blankets the room, makes Dean silently wish he hadn’t said anything. Words aren’t his friend most days and today is no exception.
Cas leans forward, the smell of sourdough too enticing to give up. The pattern though—it’s scored to look like a bee. The beekeeper looks up at his fellow vendor, confusion written all his face. He hadn’t expected this.
It’s a long minute until the man stops and says, “Thanks.”
“Dean.”
“And,” Dean says smugly, “one slice of apple pie, as promised.”
And she leaves, Dean still standing there, alone.
The beekeeper stands stock still, eyes wide in shock and immersed in the comforting lull of being kissed
When the crossroads demon appears—red eyes and curled smirk—Dean is solely focused on one thing.
Cas is a bit struck. He ducks down beneath the table for his supply in only to wordlessly hand it to Dean. He watches as the other man explains the different tastes and drizzles a generous amount of honey onto a thick slab of bread.
Some emotion—an elated feeling—rises up in Dean’s chest; tamping down a smile, he clasps the other man's shoulder, gripping it firmly. “All right, then. How about we get some more breakfast then?”
God said not to covet and didn’t say anything about it applying to angels. Cas thinks about this perhaps more than he should.
Sighing, Cas takes another sip from his thermos.
Castiel’s voice is still low when he continues. “It is not in my power to give you this, but I forgive you. I forgive you although it is not needed.”
It’s the singular question—the one in the whole world that Cas has avoided—come back to bite him in the ass.
How firm those words are, a surety. Dean Winchester is beautiful. He still is.
“What?” the baker asks, voice thick.
When he passes Cas’ plate to the other man, Cas’ thumb brushes up against the inside of Dean’s wrist. A shiver travels up Dean’s spine. Open-mouthed, Dean flounders for a minute.
bit of a cw for john’s a+ parenting, but yeah, should mostly be fluff!
He turns around, isn’t watching as Castiel hesitantly slip under the covers. By the time Dean turns back to ask a question, the other man is already asleep—face smushed against the pillow, mouth slightly open. He looks almost angelic now.
He pulls away first, fumbling for his back pocket before pulling out a beaten map and setting it on the table. “You—you said you knew where you needed to go.”
is never something he can have. And so he did the only thing he could at the moment.
Cas stills, the crate getting heavier by the second. “I was attempting to get to my booth. It seems like that won’t happen.”
“Are you,” Castiel starts, “Are you promising?”
It’s a chorus of voices. Dean tries to run, but he ends up surrounded.
“I had a nightmare.”
“You promise?” Dean smirks.
It’s like any other day. Dean is in the bunker corridor outside his room when he notices the angel. Booking it back to his room is not an option, though he tries.
Dean moves away toward Cas’ fridge, rummaging for something. It’s a fair minute before he pulls out a bag of frozen peas.
“There’s nothing, okay, Cas?”
“C’mere.” Cas hasn’t graduated to stringing multiple words together yet, but it’s still early. “Stop thinking.”
It’s by accident that Cas catches Dean’s eyes and it’s like an electric shock.
Dean is beautiful.
The whole world is in danger. And yet, Dean cannot bring himself to care.
. The pain is enough for him to gesture dismissively while gritting out, “Nope. It’s almost ready. Go sit back down.”
“Is it this?” Cas asks, drawing his hand away before gripping Dean’s jaw. It makes Dean look directly at Cas, to understand that Cas means what he’s saying.
, Dean says softly,
Cas tries once more. “What do you need?”
“What are you doing here?”
But before he can turn away—
Trailing off, Dean becomes silent; the memory is not so distant that he can’t vividly recall every second—the way Sam had rifled through his cassette tapes, mocking him like he’s done all his life. Jess peers at him, watching the way he tightens his jaw. Swallowing his words.
Dean nods, once. There are no other words, not right now.
Dean is tracking him, eyes still a bit watery and red-rimmed.
After everything they’ve been through, at least Cas knows this—to be tethered to Dean through fate, through one singular action of piecing his soul back together, has made his life more interesting.
The ex-angel draws back, though not fully separating from Dean, to lay on his side. He coaxes Dean to lay on his tummy, watching how the man’s limbs splay out, vulnerable in a sense that Cas never would have seen before.
Finally, he decides to lean forward, looking at the salt and pepper shakers. “I’m, uh, I’m glad.”
Cas breathes in.
He thinks maybe there’s something wrong when the most contact he’s ever had with other people usually comes in the form of flinging him across the room.  When it’s something that is expected now.
Castiel finally gets to introduce himself to Dean, and while it doesn't go quite as expected, the result is favorable.
“Looking forward to it!” he shouted, strongly resisting the urge to face-palm himself right then and there.
“I already had some toast and a cup of coffee while I was downstairs preparing your breakfast. I’m not used to eating much in the morning, as I am usually busy opening the shop. I wasn’t sure what your usual breakfast consisted of, so I took the liberty of making a little of everything.” Cas spoke hesitantly.
“Great!” Cas beamed. “There’s a diner two doors down from here. Should we meet, say around 7?” Dean nodded a confirmation, and Cas proceeded to stand. “I need to get back to work, I look forward to continuing this riveting conversation tomorrow.”
“I have nothing planned, Dean. Did you have something in mind?” Cas asked as he stepped back.
Dean’s usual coffee is black and strong. He doesn’t necessarily enjoy it, but it’s not about enjoyment, it’s about necessity . He requires the caffeine to function. He’s embarrassed, so he quickly picks something to order, not really knowing what to expect. What the hell, he’s here, might as well try something new. He can’t believe coffee can cost so much. Dean’s not certain of what the words mean, but anything referred to as grande certainly must be large enough to suit his needs. He winds up with some sickeningly sweet latte with a fancy foam on top, and cinnamon sprinkled on it. One sip and he’s silently melting inside. It’s delicious. So that’s how it begins, Dean’s secret weekly trips to the Bees Knees coffee shop, while Sammy is at his Friday morning class.
Dean awoke the next morning to the smell of coffee and bacon. It took him a moment to get his bearings, but as he settled into consciousness he remembered where he was, recalling with a smile the events of last evening.
When Sam arrived home after class, he found Dean pacing back and forth throughout the kitchen. Not wanting to startle him, he approached his brother cautiously. “Dean? Is there something wrong?” When Sam caught Dean’s gaze, he could see the panic laced within his features. When his brother offered no sort of explanation, Sam continued to prod a bit more insistently. “Seriously, Dean, you’re starting to worry me. What is going on?”
They eased into comfortable conversation, Cas talking about his business, and how it had come to be, Dean telling Cas about Sam and his job at the auto shop. The conversation continued through their meal, and when the waitress brought the checks and asked if she could get them anything else, both men realized two hours had already passed. Not needing anything further, they paid their checks and headed outside.
Dean Winchester was not a man that had been afforded a life of luxury. His mom had died when Dean was very young and his father was absent more often than not. Dean grew up basically raising his little brother. He wasn’t complaining by any means. He and Sam lived a comfortable life, it just wasn’t extravagant, and it certainly didn’t allow for trips to fancy coffee shops.
Once they were both dressed and the diner showed no signs of their recent activities, Cas turned his attention to Dean. He was fearful that he might see some sign of concern or regret, but when Dean’s face revealed nothing of the sort, Cas allowed himself to relax.
Sam couldn’t help the smirk that spread across his face. He loved getting a rise out of his brother, and sometimes Dean made it too easy. Sam released his pin on his brother, offering a hand to help him stand up. Once they were both vertical again, Sam decided not to push his luck with his brother. Dean could have a short fuse, and Sam didn’t want to reach the end of it.
Sam stood up, grabbing a blanket off the back of his chair and covering Dean with it. He and Cas exchanged “good nights” and Sam headed to bed. Sliding himself out carefully from beneath Dean, Cas managed to reposition himself until he was lying behind him. Dean turned over, and Cas was worried for a moment that he had woken him, but Dean settled immediately, snuggling deeper into Castiel’s chest. Something warm bloomed from within, and as he settled with a contented sigh of his own, he said a silent prayer for whatever he had done to have his life blessed with Dean Winchester.
Dean was currently twirling the small box around in his pocket, thoughts lingering on this evening’s plans. He had asked Cas to meet him at the diner at seven, the same diner they’d had their first date at, exactly six months ago today. Dean knew six months was a short time, a blink of an eye when compared to a lifetime, but he’d never been more certain of anything. He just had to tell Sam first.
“Honestly, Dean, it was no trouble. Doing something nice for you will never be considered trouble to me. I want to do things for you Dean, take care of you. Let me, please?”
“What the hell, Sam?! Let me up!” Dean demanded, knowing full well Sam wouldn’t let him go until he got what he wanted. That didn’t stop Dean from trying, unsuccessfully, to break Sam’s hold.
It took Dean a moment to process the fact that not only was Cas presenting an already made drink to him, even though he hadn’t placed an order yet, but that Cas had called him by name. Dean didn’t remember telling anyone his name at the cafe, so how had Cas known? A barely audible “hello” was all Dean could manage at the moment. Reading the confusion on Dean’s face, Cas proceeded to explain.
“It looks delicious Cas, almost as good as the cook.” Dean winked. “Thank you.” He dug in, and then continued to speak around a mouthful of bacon. “You didn’t have to go to all the trouble Cas.” Dean swallowed sheepishly, silently cursing himself for forgetting his manners.
“Hmmm, must be a Winchester trait.” Cas noted, smiling at the brother’s playful banter, causing Dean’s cheeks to turn a matching shade of red.
An hour later, the pair stood in Dean’s bedroom, Dean staring at himself in the mirror in disbelief. He looked good. He was wearing dark washed jeans, accompanied by a light blue dress shirt and a dark blue jacket that he’d purchased for his uncle’s wedding a few years back, one of the few occasions in his life when he’d needed to dress up.
“You don’t need luck, Dean. Cas loves you, there’s no way he’s saying no. Now get out of here before you’re late.” Sam gave him a shove out of the bedroom, following him down the stairs, closing the front door behind him.
“No Dean, I’m sorry!” Cas squealed, struggling unsuccessfully. After a few moments Dean relented, leaning forward to place a kiss on Cas’s cheek. But before he reached his intended destination, Cas turned his head, Dean catching the corner of Cas’s mouth instead, causing Cas to turn fully, greedily seeking Dean’s lips. The two stood there for a moment, caught up in the taste of each other, and when they finally released, they realized there was a couple watching them, waiting to take their turn. Giving the couple an apologetic wave, they grabbed their putters and balls and moved to the next green.
Not knowing what to say, Dean pulled Sam in for a bone-crushing hug. Sam reciprocated, holding on until he felt Dean release his grip. “Thanks Sammy.” was all Dean could muster, and Sam could hear the shakiness in his voice. When Dean pulled back, Sam could see the glisten of tears in his eyes. Quickly wiping them away and clearing his throat, Dean proceeded. “So what now?” He asked. Sam looked at Dean with the biggest grin he’d seen on his face in a long time.
Dean and Cas have their first date.
Once inside, they were quickly seated across from each other at a corner table. The waitress took their drink order, leaving them with menus, and the assurance that she would be back shortly. Glancing briefly over the menu, Cas set it down, apparently knowing what he wanted already. “I don’t know why I bother looking, I always order the same thing, unlike some people I know.” Cas tried easing into conversation.
“I was just teasing Dean, I’m sorry. It’s a lot to take in, ya know? Secret rendezvous to coffee shops, mysterious blue-eyed men.” Sam tried to be serious, but he just couldn’t help himself. When Dean turned around, ready to leave, Sam quickly changed his tone, placing a hand on his brother’s shoulder, turning him around to face him again. “Seriously, Dean, this is good news, and I’m happy for you. Ecstatic actually. You deserve this.  And before you get all awkward on me again, just know that I already suspected you may have a thing for guys, and I’m fine with it Dean, really.”

“No no no Cas, it’s not like that.” Dean quickly stuttered out.
Tears began spilling down Dean’s cheeks as he pulled Cas in for a kiss. “I love you.” He murmured, unable to hold his emotions back anymore than he could his tears. “I know it’s crazy, and we barely know each other, but I’ve never been more certain of anything.” Dean glanced up hesitantly, but then a grin crept across his face as he said it again. “I love you.”
“I want you to do it, Sam. I want you to marry us.” Dean’s voice was laced with confidence in his decision, yet he was hesitant as to how Sam would respond to the request.
Even so, he’s rooted to the floor. Everything is so different here. Better.
The words make Cas’ eyes soften. There’s silence between them, as well as an inexplicable tiredness that drapes over their shoulders. World-weary.
“I’m going to kiss you now.” It’s no longer a question, but a statement. Cas only nods, star-struck and having trouble forming words.
An unspoken are you going to leave me lingers between them.
“Cas,” Dean says slowly, hands already outstretched to refuse the offering, “buddy, it’s not that I don't appreciate it, but it’s not what you’re thinking. God’s honest truth, cross my heart, or whatever, it’s okay.”
“I’m not sure—” Cas said, already reaching for the bread to draw it back in, when Dean interrupts him.
“I’m not. I won’t.” Dean promises, voice suddenly shaky. “I’m sorry.”
Cas brings his other hand up to trace the contour of Dean’s jaw. The motion makes Dean shudder slightly, still amazed that Cas is here, is touching him.
, Cas thinks,
They stare at each other, Cas fidgeting under Dean’s ministrations. By now, Dean has slid his hand down Cas’ arm to run his thumb over Cas’s knuckles softly. As if to soothe the other man.
Cas makes to step forward—to clear the dishes, maybe to stare at that smile for a longer—when his foot catches on one of the honey jars. The beekeeper flails, trying to keep his balance.
Dean draws back, moving his hands up to frame Cas’ face. If Cas was a better man, he wouldn’t lean into it. But he isn’t. The touch burns, but maybe Cas will have the strength to suffer; he hopes to God he does.
There are things he cannot say aloud, things like I’m scared, I don’t know what to do.
There’s a beat of silence as Dean closes his eyes, unable to move.
Cas’ voice is sincere in a way that makes Dean shift. He remembers that sort of feeling, can still feel the ache of it now. The loneliness. The way somebody would pay attention to him, the way he craved being seen. It’s something that Dean has always wanted.
They’re almost out of time. Dean yells for Jack.
, and there’s certainly no way in hell he’s going back on it now. But it’s—it’s something else, this hungry maw inside of him; before, he thought he could tamp it down, use other coping methods.
The touch burns, just a little.
“Good things do happen, Dean. Haven’t you learned this by now?”
hey y'all! i know there are only four of you sticking with this and i thank you so much! finals took me out but here's a new update!
It seems so vivid now, the last moments she has—Sam stuffing his shirts in a duffel bag, his tone exasperated. Him ducking down to give her a kiss on her temple.
He stops breathing for a moment, somehow afraid that if he looks away, it will disappear.
They’re face to face, staring at each other. Dean is despondent; he’s searching for something like forgiveness.
“So you’re good with your hands, then. Baking. Fixing cars up.” Cas gestures towards the dash. Being here now, Cas can see the care put into making the car Dean’s. It’s meticulously taken care of, free of any dirt and every inch polished.
Dean feels Cas staring down at him with a smile, but he can’t bear to look. The skin hunger has ebbed by now, but the embarrassment of letting Cas—letting anyone—see him like this still lingers.
There’s no significant reason why Cas shouldn’t be able to respond, but he’s opening his mouth and nothing’s coming out.
It’s the dead of night when Dean Winchester sees him. Granted, he almost passes by the man; it’s dark, he’s only got the headlights to go by, and the guy isn’t exactly wearing flashy colors.
again.
“Huh?”
He balls up his fists, looks Dean straight in the eye.
Dean thinks of how he can’t even do that for Cas.
Dean’s cheeks turn slightly red. The baker backs away, slipping his hand out from under Cas’ and picking up the thermos with a mild look of distaste.
Him saying I love you and the way he
One part of him is telling him to stick by the baker’s side, the other part is yelling at him for being this gullible. To withdraw for the sake of his sanity.
So Dean goes along with it, drowning in ill-fitted clothes and shivering from the cold. His dad says the monster hunts children. And he has to wait. Stay still.
When the healing is done and the light gone, Castiel doesn’t remove his hand. Instead, he keeps it there. It’s interesting what the touch does to Dean. The man’s eyes are still closed, lips slightly parted, as he sways a little.
“It’s fine,” the baker replies, “Benny’s already off-loading our stuff. Wanted to ask you how you liked the bread.”
He involuntarily shivers, the cold air just a tad too good at penetrating his jacket.
“Me? What about you?” Cas’ voice is incredulous. The urge to shake the other man is almost undeniable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.”
It’s a refrain Sam has repeated over the past month. But sleep is for those who can rest. Sleep is for those who don’t have nightmares.
Dean fumbles for his phone, looking at his reflection in the darkened screen. He drags one hand over his left cheek, prods at the raised skin. Absent-mindedly, he thinks about the scar he still carries on his shoulder.
“Cas,” Dean fixes him with a stare. “No excuses, okay? I’ll drive you back later. It’ll be okay, I just want to get you out of the rain. You tend not to do well in colder weather.”
It feels right.
Cas. Covets. Dean fucking Winchester’s bread. There’s sounds coming out of Cas’ mouth that he didn’t think he could make. When he reaches for the butter, it’s the perfect combination. He needs to save some of it or else it’d be gone in under an hour.
That’s the question that’s haunted both of them over the years—the push and the pull of turning away from each other at their lowest points. Cas walking into the lake. Dean pushing Cas out of the bunker.
It’s almost like time has stood still—if somebody were to take a snapshot of the moment, it would be Cas standing in front of Dean, open-mouthed and wide-eyed.
Dean hangs his head, leaning into the touch. Still, there’s no sound, no acknowledgment.
Of course, that doesn’t mean that it’s any less infuriating. He’s in a car with Dean Winchester and Dean Winchester is kind and handsome and there’s nothing he can do about it.
“Yeah, man. All yours.” Dean slaps the bread, making Cas squint at him even harder.
But Layla comes back and talks to him.
It's Dean. Sam's brother, Dean.
It doesn’t make the want any less.
Castiel steps back. The change is immediate—Dean rocks forward, a product of exhaustion, even as he’s gripping the sheets. Castiel tilts his head, examining the man before him. A second passes before Castiel is gone, leaving Dean in his wake.
“Anyway, I just wanted to drop this off. Little bit of a lull and I don’t think we’ll sell enough of these so—”, Dean trails off, kneading at the back of his neck. An almost shy look crossed his face. “Here.”
Jess is firm. “You owe me that much. The truth.” There’s nothing left besides it now.
Dean grins ear to ear, taking his hand off Cas’ back to start the car.
He’s just hefting the honey jar crate up into his arms when he feels a trickle of water.
“I—I’m not very hungry,” the other man replies, even as his stomach rumbles, a loud noise in the vast expanse of the dinner.
“Cas? Your address?”
Dean is half-way to shaking his head when Cas’ fingers press down further, slowly kneading the back of Dean’s neck.
He shifts from one foot to another, waiting for an answer. Cassie tucks one curl behind her ear. She looks up after doing so, that radiant smile still there.
He’ll never tell anyone, but he’s scared.
.” Cas’ voice takes on a sarcastic tone even as he pitches it like Dean’s. Cas’ natural register is lower than Dean’s, but something’s different today. Is he sick?
The look that Cas gives him—unimpressed and thoroughly discontented—sends him reeling.
He places a hand on Dean’s back, trying to ground him. Dean’s eyes widen. The warmth is always a shock to him, something that wasn’t there when he was younger.
“I’m getting you out of here. I promise.”
Dean ran. He’s still running.
“C’mere.” Dean shrugs out of his leather jacket, stepping forward to bundle Cas in it. It’s heavy, thick, Dean’s warmth still there. The baker tugs it close, then pats Cas’ shoulders. “Better?”
Cas swallows hard. He’s torn between telling Dean or not telling him. In seconds, Cas flicks his eyes down to the carrier bag he’s stashed the gloves in. Flicks his eyes back to Dean and how he’s holding Cas’ hands.
“I’m not sure that’s necessary.” Cas tries to deflect.
She nods along, pen scribbling fast. “Will that be all?”
He can’t believe it. He doesn’t believe it. Cas’s heart beats a bit faster.
“Hey Cas.” Dean’s voice is gentle. Cas immediately raises the mug to him, slightly shuddering as their fingers brush each other.
Dean moves closer to Cas, eyes soft. There’s a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “I’m going to kiss you?”
logo on it.
A loud sound echoes through the room. Cas jumps, startled.
In this way, too, Castiel also feels right.
good-looking and
“Nope.”
, he says,
Cas looks into Dean’s green, green eyes; slowly, he brings his other hand up to card through Dean’s hair, thumb brushing against his temple.
She can’t help thinking back to her nightmare—the petrified look of horror on Sam, the smell of blood—and suddenly everything is spinning. She throws out one hand to steady herself against the dashboard.
Dean focuses on Cas. “Yeah. Yeah I do. You need to take you there?”
When Mary turns to say good night and cradles his face with her hand, he can’t help but follow. It’s been so long since he’s been comforted that way.
Castiel tilts his head, raising his eyes as if he’s thinking, then back down to Dean. “I guess that was implied.”
Michael smiles sadly. “I already told you. Since when do we get what you deserve?”
The baker raises one hand in defeat. “All right, all right. Not talking smack. I like Baby better though.”
Her voice breaks on the last word. There’s no fight anymore, only this overwhelming wave of sadness. If she had known, she wouldn’t have let Sam leave.
“I don't,” Dean pauses, looking lost. His leather jacket is too big for his shoulders. “I don't know.”
Dean Winchester wakes up late. It’s unusual for him, this slow stretch of his body instead of the gasping breaths he’s become accustomed to over the years after nightmares and loud noises. His body’s used to being a tight string, one pull away from snapping. But this is different now.
The thought is just enough to make Cas delirious.
“Do you hate me that much, that you can’t even look at me?”
, but there’s something about Castiel, something that made him stop in the first place.
Dean looks across the table at Castiel, a small grin tugging at the corners of his lips. There’s something peculiar about the guy—just a funky, little dude—in the way he takes everything so seriously. Even now, he’s staring at the menu in such concentration.
“Warmth.” Dean turns the key in the ignition. “Dry spot.” He points to the roof. “And—” he reaches back to pull out a tin and a thermos, “biscotti and cocoa.”
It’s at least a start. Dean’s touch is still a wildfire though—Cas is almost sure he’ll burn from it. The baker’s hands fall away as he looks through the window.
Cas is staring at him. No matter how many years later, there’s still something otherworldly about the ex-angel. Even without his grace. Even that he’s human now. Cas raises his hand, settling it on Dean’s cheek and running his fingers through Dean’s hair. It’s getting longer now.
Cassie ducks her head, a slight smile on her lips. She’s thinking. It makes Dean nervous as hell.
Cas hefts Dean closer to him, turning both of them over so Dean is lying on his back, half covered by Cas’ body.
Cas gives a small smile. It’s just for Dean, this look. He drags his hand down Dean’s shoulder—bare skin to bare skin—until he finds Dean’s hand. The calluses there are borne from hard work and grit. A good life.
