And sure enough, at five o’clock in the afternoon – five past, actually, Lestrade made a stop to the bathroom to freshen himself up and stare at his old suit, desperately wishing he’d worn the nicer one instead – a black car with tinted windows was parked just outside the entrance. To further dissipate any doubts he still had, the door opened as soon as he left the building, and a muscular young man walked out of it. He had long hair, perfectly styled in a bun, and wore a fancy looking suit; Lestrade suddenly wished for the pavement to collapse underneath him and swallow him whole.
Which was why Sherlock didn’t like the fact that she was not laughing now. She didn't look upset, either, but Sherlock knew her facial expression, had an almost unlimited database of them, and something was bothering her from the way her hands held the wheel, more tightly than usual.
Of course, everyone still recognized her at uni – it wasn’t hard, with her height and dyed black hair. She’d bonded with her labmates, she guessed, two brown haired boys with glasses who worked hard and didn’t ask personal questions.
He got that feeling again – the one he got quite often, given the nature of his job: that human beings did terrible things for reasons that were ultimately futile, because they were ultimately selfish beings, that nothing was ever noble and there was no higher purpose whatsoever. The feeling had found him more than once, during his career, although it had been more frequent at first, and now after the divorce it’d come back in full force: how can people really love each other, when they’ll strangle an old lady because she was listening to the Hail Mary at the radio?
“They… they’ll come around,” Sherlock said, with disdain, perhaps too much to be natural. “There’s not a lot I can do about it. Thankfully they haven’t asked us to come over for the big Christmas lunch,” she offered, looking truly disgusted, now.
As she sipped on her usual coffee – a necessity for early morning shifts – she opened the envelope, which was blank, although she knew that it could only come from two people, and Mrs Hudson usually preferred to talk.
“It was worth it, in the end,” Lestrade replied from the backseat, the letters safe inside the blanket in a grocery bag they’d found in the boot.
“It’s not just the public image,” Jo interrupted her. “Think about everyone else you know. The Yard, your…”
‘There’ was a housing estate in a not very nice part of London. The woman, Louisa Parris, occupied the top floor, and had done so since the sixties, when she’d married her late husband, Albert. He had died just six months earlier, after a lifetime spent working at a Ford plant and a short stint as a small business owner after he’d retired.
“I’d say so,” Mycroft replied, “unlike my poor sister. I hope she’ll behave herself. And that she won’t be too late,” she added, and then a familiar blue car passed them.
“She tried to write her life story,” Joanna continued. Sherlock said nothing, looking at them from the sofa, where she’d scattered another pile of papers. “Several times. She rarely gets past her teenage years – but they all begin in the same way:
“I don’t give a crap about contemporary French theatre and you know that,” she interrupted her. “I should have told you straight away – that I… all my life, since high school, I’ve refused to hide, Sherlock. Even when lying would’ve helped – at school, or in the army.”
The flat would soon start smelling bad, because of all the food still in the fridge, slowly rotting and going bad, and dust would begin accumulating, and no one would ever sit on the old people armchair in front of the television anymore. The investigation over, the landlord would rent it to someone else the second after the removal of the police tape.
“You didn’t know about your father’s activities, then? Must have been such a shock, to see all that money…”
Sherlock was leaning against the wall, and she’d taken out a cigarette, from a pack Joanna knew she had, since she looked resigned. With her other hand she held the phone close to her ear, only to lower it every minute or so, inhale and look up to the sky as she blew out the smoke, which looked very dramatic to Lestrade, who was a former smoker. Sound was muffled from outside the car, and Lestrade tried not to eavesdrop anyway.
“And I have to apologize for something else, as well,” Sherlock added, her voice lower, legs straight in front of her. They were sitting on the plastic chairs outside the interrogation room, where Joanna had waited for them as they made Michael Parris talk.
Then Joanna handed him the keys of the old, battered blue car, which he drove obediently through London; then he dropped them off at the entrance of St Bart’s. The first few minutes they were silent, on opposite sides of the backseat, almost like two kids who have recently been in a fight. Then Sherlock scooped closer – was she holding out the olive branch? Then Lestrade saw that the doctor’s head was bleeding profusely, and Sherlock was holding a napkin, that quickly turned from white to bright red. Joanna’s eyes were half closed now, and her head had fallen dangerously to the side.
“Yeah, don’t think I’ll do that. But,” and then Lestrade paused, as it was a sore subject for both, “Mum likes French stuff, doesn’t she?”
“It’s going to be alright,” he told her, feeling very fatherly, even though he had no children (he and Sophie had tried, but they just hadn’t come) and even though Sherlock was only ten years his junior.
Sherlock’s lips were shut tight. “She doesn’t have a driving licence,” Joanna explained – she’d stopped complaining about being taken to A&E, and she was quiet, which seemed like a very bad sign to Lestrade. “Oh God,” Joanna was saying, as Sherlock supported her for the short walk to the car, “I wasn’t supposed to be there… that sounds like an insurance nightmare!” she said, and Lestrade chose not to think about
“You’re here with your friend?” his mother was asking, when Lestrade sensed the danger, and felt the need to intervene.
They kept Joanna for the night – and Sherlock curled up in an armchair next to her, in a suspiciously nice room, in a suspiciously nice wing, that Mycroft was no doubt responsible for.
“Oh, they were, at least at first,” and then Lestrade remembered the dinner he’d offered and that Joanna had refused, and suddenly felt his ears go red.
“No. You did,” Sherlock insisted, and it was clear from her face that it was fundamentally against her own nature to say such a thing. “You had a hunch and followed it, and didn’t care about my opinion. That is a quality I appreciate a lot in a companion.” She said as if it were a poem she’d been forced to learn by heart.
“I don’t want them to think that I’m living off you,” she whispered. Sherlock didn’t really see how all those things were related – she would have been more than happy to cover for her half of the rent, if the need should arise, but it had never been necessary, because she had a job and she certainly wasn’t living off Sherlock, of all people.
“Your parents. Or what we just did. It’s out there now – it can’t be undone. How does it make you feel. How…” Joanna began.
“Some things never change,” Lestrade said. He thought it must be one of those things one truly understands only when he has children, a scenario which grew more and more unlikely every day, for him.
Back at Baker Street, after they’d driven Lestrade home, a long night was ahead of Sherlock and Joanna. They’d both left their dresses on the back of the sofa, and they’d changed into more comfortable clothes; Sherlock hadn’t been wearing too much makeup to begin with, and she wasn’t going to try to remove it, but Joanna had attempted to wipe hers away, and now it was mostly smudged on her cheekbones. Her eyes were red; she was tired. They’d changed in silence and she hadn’t tried to breach the subject of the phone call.
“No clue,” he said, “it’s the first time I’ve heard of this, too.” Which was true; because prior to Joanna reading the incipit of the poor woman’s memoirs, he’d almost forgotten her name.
They stopped on the side of the road, out of the way of oncoming cars. They were close to Lestrade’s house already.
“Do you want to read the letters?” Sherlock asked then, because she desperately wanted to talk about the case, or anything else, for that matter.
“You really want Mycroft there, don’t you?” Sherlock said like clockwork, as soon as she fastened her belt in the passenger seat.
It ended up not mattering because, come July, Victoria gave her a speech, short and concise, very well crafted:
Then, they drove back to Scotland Yard, because someone had finally managed to contact Michel Parris, the architect son.
Joanna woke up early to go to the surgery and found an envelope on the kitchen table. Sherlock was still asleep, in bed. She’d had to learn to get ready without making too much noise, in the morning, when she had to work and Sherlock was not on a case, because those were the rare times she actually got some sleep, and Joanna didn’t want to disturb it. So she picked out her clothes the night before. She enjoyed it. Despite the cold.
Then Sherlock shook her head, covered her mouth with a hand, then added, “I know what a plus one is. I grew up in formal situations.”
. They were standing close to each other, although they were no longer holding hands, Joanna noticeably more relaxed than Sherlock.
“You found out about Harry Walton,” Sherlock stated, returning that look – she was great at challenges: every single part of her face, but mostly her eyes, and her thin lips, could communicate such disdain, such unpleasantness, that it was hard not to feel challenged.
“You’ve been such a good influence on her life, before Joanna came along. She cares a lot about you, even though she does her best to hide it.”
“Yes,” he added after a while. “They were my mum’s! They were supposed to become mine soon, anyway.”
April and May, they spent every waking hour together, and they slept together too. Sherlock had a room alone, with a double bed; Victoria moved in with her. She listened to her, even when she talked about biology, or chemistry, or different types of soil, and never rolled her eyes. When she was seen around with Victoria, no one even tried calling her a freak.
“If you still don’t get it, I don’t know what to tell you,” Joanna replied. She could her from her tone that she’d lost her patience and she was at a loss.
She ordered a croissant and ate it with more grace than Lestrade had ever seen, covering her mouth with her hand as she chewed, which was making him a bit self conscious. They spoke of their families and about France, and Lestrade discovered that the Holmeses went to France every year, on holiday, and that a grandma had been French, as well – that both Mycroft and Sherlock were fluent in French. Mycroft looked interested in the life story of Lestrade’s father, and it made him realize that he liked to tell it.
Sherlock was almost running to the entrance, Joanna struggling to keep up in her heels. “Let her run. It’s not like she has the keys.”
“I do. Did. But it still wasn’t nice to say it out loud,” Joanna replied. Her posture was defensive, no doubt a parting gift from the Army, and her eyes cold, and unreadable, which scared Sherlock.
“Oh. I don’t have any ex husbands,” Mycroft offered, and Lestrade felt relieved that he did not have to ask, “just serious relationships, here and there, no matter what Sherlock says about it.”
He felt like he was being allowed into such a personal situation – even if it hadn’t been deliberate, hell, he’d just happened to be there. He still felt closer to the consulting detective then he’d ever been. And he realized something – that had already occurred to him during the play, even though he’d almost forgotten about it in the following events: that there are times when we are required to make a choice and do something, with some urgency, as well. Specifically, this was one of those times, and the choice was between supporting them or not, and both were definitely actions – lack of support would have been as decisive as open disapproval.
“Someone had been living inside the house!” Sherlock shouted, almost triumphantly, once Lestrade was done with the tale of the old woman and the iPhone charger. “I’d read about such cases, I couldn’t wait to actually see one, though. We’re going?”
“My mum’s coming to London again,” Lestrade explained. “We’ll celebrate at my brother’s house, with the kids.” He didn’t really see the point of sharing such information, except that Joanna was nice and he was beginning to consider her a friend, and they’d just decided to spend Christmas Eve together.
Lestrade tried to imagine the two of them – plus Mycroft – sitting at the world’s longest table, butlers and maids carrying the food back and forth, and with them were two mysterious figures, tall, with icy blue eyes, emanating authority and fear. Then he imagined himself, instead of Joanna, or beside her, and Mycroft instead of her sister. The female mysterious figure was asking him what he did for a living, expecting ‘banker’, maybe, or ‘Prime Minister’, and…
“Yes,” Lestrade said, “it could be big, or it could be nothing.” He never discussed police stuff with his mother and he always tried to phrase it in a way she’d understand. It helped him understand, as well.
Sherlock knew she should have looked around to check for anyone who could see them, because they were celebrities now, albeit on a very small scale, and in a very strange way; but the thought crossed her mind, almost sent by God himself, that Joanna wouldn’t have appreciated that. And perhaps, only perhaps, Sherlock had actually been waiting to hear those words: maybe she actually wanted to climb onto the hospital bed and hug her.
“...I want you to meet my mother and father, eventually, and I think they’d like you more than they like me. I want to work on another few hundred cases with you, then retire to the countryside with you and then we’ll do something relaxing, like beekeeping, even though you’re…”
“You’re not,” she said. “I’m doing this because I want to. I want to hold your hand in the street without tabloids calling us gal pals…”
“You’re right, I’m sorry. Please resume.” Sherlock sat back down, crossing her long legs and holding her chin with her left hand, a caricature of an attentive listener.
“And how are you planning to get there?” Joanna replied, and underneath her light makeup, so clearly applied by someone else, Lestrade rejoiced in seeing Sherlock Holmes blush.
He figured that he probably should have come alone anyway – he couldn’t exactly hand her the ticket in front of Anderson, who had worked on the case, too, even though he hadn’t exactly elicited the fair youth’s employer’s sympathies, with his snarky comments about contemporary theatre, that Lestrade only silently related to. He decided to do it before mentioning the case, hoping to downplay the effect the invite had had – on him, at least.
She led the way, picking a window table inside a fancy looking coffee shop. It had been so, so long for him – for Lestrade, the newly single man – since he’d last done that: dating. Just dating – two people who barely know each other, who feel too old to be doing this, and a table with two cappuccinos between them. Getting to know each other. So, do you have any siblings?
Inside the questioning room, the son still looked upset; not the way murderers did, more like a child whose mother has told him that he’s not allowed to jump on the bed.
“So,” Joanna breached the subject first, or maybe she just said it to break the silence. Lestrade felt the urgent need to stick his foot in his mouth anyway.
“It was not a hard one,” Sherlock said. “I want to be with you.” It felt really urgent, like it couldn’t even wait for the telly to stop screaming an obnoxious song. “I… want to be with you, whatever it takes,” she said.
The clock on his desk was white and cheap, a relic from his divorce, and it often fell behind. It was too slow at counting seconds, although it wasn’t really noticeable, even when Lestrade tried staring at it. As the employer spoke, the Detective Inspector checked his own wristwatch and corrected the time on the battered clock.
Sherlock considered pretending that she didn’t remember what she’d said, but she knew that Joanna would see through it. “They’d find you agreeable,” she confirmed. “You have good manners and you are attractive. These are the only two criteria they apply to people. Other than class, but they’d make an exception.”
“They wouldn’t take it away because of this; they already haven’t. If you weren’t so agreeable, perhaps. They tried, in the past, but not for that.” She was starting to speak fast, and not too coherently.
It wasn’t thick. She broke the seal with a knife; inside was the ticket for the play. There was no note.
“Why are there six of them?” he tried to ask, but the fair youth had already walked away. He was left staring at her coat and purse, in the cold London air. Christmas was approaching, and the shopkeepers had already filled their windows with obnoxious decorations; large, shiny balls of gold and silver were already hanging on cables in the larger streets.
But, as one neighbour had told the EMTs, she did not have any living relatives, not anymore, after her husband’s death: their only son, Michael, had run away in his early twenties, and was now a successful architect somewhere; he paid her rent every month and nothing more.
“A steaming pile of shit, that’s what she wrote. That my dad wasn’t my actual dad and that I was the son of this farmer she met – she was going senile, that’s all.”
Still, his mother was alive and lived was a rather fancy estate – as he forced himself to remember as they entered – nothing like the one they were currently in: the tiled floor was a different colour from the one it had started out as, as highlighted by the few stops where the original shade still managed to emerge. It had no lift, just a narrow set of stairs with low hand railings, that Louisa Parris must have climbed every day, to go to the bakery or to the supermarket. The walls had to be thin, because he could hear at least two different small children cry their lungs out.
The moment was, however, ruined by the loud notes of some kind of music, religious, upon further analysis, blasting from an old radio that was sitting on a table in the living room, together with large scissors and a sewing machine.
They did look a bit alike, in the shape of the eyes, maybe, even though Mycroft’s were a much warmer shade of blue, and the thin hawk-like nose, which looked lovely on Mycroft. Her makeup was always impeccable, and she chose her clothes carefully: she put so much effort in the way she looked, he could tell. Sherlock did, too, Lestrade was sure, even if Anderson often commented negatively on what the detective wore to crime scenes, as if it mattered. Sherlock favoured black jeans and slacks, and dark coloured shirts, with flat shoes, from the men’s section, apparently for comfort: but why the long coats, then, so impractical for chasing suspects and climbing up walls? No, Sherlock took just as much pride as her sister in her own wardrobe.
So Sherlock just leaned forward and kissed her – it was an awkward angle, and she was still holding the hot cup, but it felt more like the first kiss they’d shared than any other kiss they’d had since that day in June.
“We’ve been together for quite some time now, and we’ve been friends even longer. A year ago, I would’ve called you my best friend, Sherlock.”
“She knew!” he said loudly, at which Agamemnon barely raised an eyebrow. Mycroft had taken another car – she had an important work dinner, apparently. Lestrade guessed that was why she’d dressed so well, and felt a bit ashamed because he’d assumed it had been for him. Still, in her busy schedule, she’d found a way to go on a date with him, a middle aged, grey haired, soon to be round bellied Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard, and the thought warmed his heart.
Then they spoke of Lestrade’s nephew and nieces. They spoke about a dinner at an Italian restaurant they both liked, and even set a date. With mum, they agreed. She must want to see the kids more often. They didn’t say ‘I miss you’, but it was definitely there.
They walked past a shop with many different tabloids all lined up in the window – and Lestrade saw, couldn’t help but notice, the photos they’d all chosen for the cover.
“Anyway, Mrs Hudson has to leave for her board games at three, so we must hurry up,” Sherlock said, and crossed the room with just two long strides; then she stopped in front of the window, turned back on her heels, and walked back to Lestrade.
“That’s not a bad thing,” Joanna replied, an exaggerated look of confusion on her face, which meant that she wasn’t confused at all.
And that’s how Lestrade ended up at the chemist counter together with Sherlock Holmes, who was buying a box of pads and some painkillers.
“It’s not about the play itself,” Joanna replied. “I don’t give a shit about the play, Sherlock, just like you don’t – I don’t even know what it’s about. The Iliad, I guess.”
Somehow, somewhere, Lestrade still felt the need to save face; he knew that allowing them on the crime scene was a huge breach of protocol already, as it had been on every single other crime scene they’d been to; he knew their very presence at the time was highly illegal, but it had reached the point where even Gregson knew about them, and looked away, so he guessed he had nothing to lose.
They walked home in the streets, lit by the streetlights and the tacky Christmas decor. Joanna liked Christmas. Sherlock was going to buy her a new jumper as a present – red, because she liked the way it looked on her. They held hands and didn’t speak much, but it wasn’t an awkward silence. Soon they wouldn’t need to scan the crowds for cameras anymore – they still would, but not every time they held hands, she figured.
“I’m afraid the consulting detective is my sister,” Mycroft replied, polite as always, holding out a hand for Lestrade’s mother to shake.
As expected, she first raised some questions about the morality and legality of the whole thing. They were not stupid questions and even Lestrade conceded that he should have spent a bit more time thinking the whole thing through.
“That’s so generous,” he ended up stammering, after a long and painful attempt at declining, because it didn’t sound too professional, and he had nothing appropriate to wear, after losing his wardrobe to the divorce. “Tell your employer that he didn’t have to,” he tried one last time.
The bed was wide and they were both narrow enough; Sherlock wrapped one arm around Joanna’s stomach, then slipped the other one underneath her waist, between her warm body and the mattress. Then she laid her head somewhere between Joanna’s face, her collarbone, and the pillow. One side of her face was pressed against the mattress, and she said nothing.
“Whoever it was, an old woman’s still dead,” Lestrade reminded her, trying to think about what Joanna would’ve said.
Now Jo was sleeping, and Sherlock was watching her sleep, the way she did almost every night since they’d begun sharing a bed, in early June, just as the weather really began to warm up – but that hadn’t seemed to bother them: they’d slept embracing each other that entire first month. They fell asleep hugging, then, until Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night, and saw that they’d drifted a bit apart, so she immediately closed the distance again.
Sherlock knew she wasn’t supposed to do it, but she always counted all the times in a week they slept hugging, mentally measured the distance between their bodies on the bed. She knew it was supposed to come naturally, but she felt the need to quantify it. The past three nights they’d slept further apart and had hugged only briefly; there hadn’t been any sex.
“Bring your wife, of course,” the other man interrupted him, unknowingly awakening a foul mood in Lestrade that would probably last the whole morning. “And detective Donovan can bring her husband too!” he added almost as an afterthought, even though he and Donovan had worked on the case together, despite his colleague’s reluctance to the consulting detective’s involvement. “We want to have as many people from as many backgrounds as possible in attendance, in this new exciting season for our great theatre, full of history! Our new creative director…”
“Off your money and your fame,” she repeated, as if it weren’t clear enough. “But I know I have no right to ask you…”
“I hope it’s not weird, since you’re so close to my sister,” Mycroft interrupted his train of thought.
Sherlock had no clue and she liked the idea of Joanna choosing. She ended up dropping a light blue dress in her arms, that Sherlock ended up trying on and actually liking, and paying with Mycroft’s credit card.
Even Anderson came around at one point. “The old lady again?” he asked them. “Just leave it. It was the neighbour. It’s not like they’re going to give you theatre tickets for this,” he reminded them, because he wasn’t quite over the fact that he hadn’t been invited, even though he hadn’t even contributed to the big theatre case.
forced her to climb that chair.” Which was something she’d thought often, but never said out loud, in the past few days, that she’d spent at home, playing Joanna’s favourite tunes at the violin and staring at her from afar. Their relationship, already such a delicate affair, had never felt so much like walking on eggshells. What if she’d given her brain damage. What if she left while she was on the crime scene.
That June, she was invited to Victoria’s house in the countryside; Sherlock tried really hard to suppress the fear, and the anxiety, because she knew that she’d been lucky enough to be liked by Victoria: pleasing her parents would have been asking for too much.
“And the other two tickets?” Lestrade asked in the end, taking advantage of a pause in the employer’s loud monologue, that he probably only made to allow himself to breathe.
“No,” Parris said, “you’re just trying to convince me – of what the old bitch wrote. My dad was the better half of them – my dad is the reason why I turned out so well.” He smiled. “My mum was a cold bitch who hated us.”
“We’re celebrating at Baker’s Street instead, with Mrs Hudson and friends, I guess. Wanna come?” Jo asked him. Sherlock was looking at the floor. “Mycroft will be there too!” Joanna added.
“That much is certain,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. “But why rob and kill her and then pay someone else to confess – which has never worked, ever – when he could have stolen the money while she went to the supermarket every Wednesday for the elderly discount?”
She really looked like Lestrade’s primary school teacher now: her eyes were stern, but also cruelly compassionate, as if Parris were a particularly stupid and naive child, who’d just claimed to be the son of a celebrity.
Sherlock didn’t remember much about it – about that time – but she remembered thinking, such a stupid, meaningless ending, for what had been by far the most meaningful thing that had ever happened in her short life.
“I hope you’ll find whoever did that!” she said. She sounded very much awake, despite the hour. “Her poor son…”
“I’ll find someone,” the consulting detective snapped back, “but thank you for your suggestions,” and then Lestrade was about to show himself out, when he turned back on his heels to the living room and adjacent kitchenette, where Sherlock was still standing.
“If they sent that ticket to you, it’s because they explicitly want you there,” Jo was saying. “You can’t send your parents instead. It’s because of the big theatre cas…”
“I promise she’s never told me anything about it,” Lestrade said, even though it wasn’t exactly true.
She was not smiling now. “I guess I could,” she replied, after a few seconds during which she held her chin with her right hand, nails impeccably painted a deep burgundy. “I could know everything about anyone, in fact, with relatively little effort. I did, once upon a time,” she told him. “Before seeing… well, anyone I saw. But I discovered that it takes something away.”
Sherlock didn’t reply – they heard her fumble with something in the crawlspace for a few seconds, then she came down from the chair, carefully, holding a bundle in her arms. It was covered with an old blanket, and not as dusty as it should have been, which was so obvious even Lestrade could tell.
They dined at home more often, which was probably good for their health and finances, anyway, and when they ate out they always tried new places, always secluded, in quiet parts of the city and quiet hours of the day, and they still managed to get photographed sometimes. They held hands, sometimes, over the table, they didn’t say no to the candles and they called them dates; it was just a matter of luck if the tabloids hadn’t figured that one yet, or voluntary blindness.
“It was old,” Joanna said, digging it out from the pile. “They began dating when she was just sixteen – in 1956.”
Sherlock knew they weren’t actually going to buy Christmas gifts; she hoped she’d said that only because she was in the mood for driving. Joanna was a confident driver, although she drove too fast sometimes, which Sherlock Holmes didn’t mind. She’d inherited the old blue car when her brother had bought a new one, and even though it was ancient, and battered, she must have had some kind of emotional attachment to it. Sherlock Holmes didn’t really see the point of becoming emotionally attached to an inanimate object.
“I ran away, married a girl, went to uni. After I graduated I came back, and she forgave me. I paid her rent every month,” he added.
“Well, we most definitely aren’t. Sisters, I mean,” Sherlock said, “I guess you’re a very close friend, as well. All the pages I’ve consulted say that being friends already greatly helps with…”
“We received a formal invite,” his superior informed him instead, after he’d performed the customary bow upon entering his office and explained the situation as well as he could. Lestrade wondered why, then, the employer had sent that fair youth to wait for him outside his workplace, to give him the tickets inside a blank envelope, like some kind of mob boss.
So he drove, his delegation consisting of himself alone, through London traffic, to ring the doorbell of 221b, swearing to God, if He even existed, that he was going to sue Sherlock, the next time this would inevitably happen.
Joanna was on the sofa, on her side, to avoid the unpleasant rubbing of the fabric against the stitched side of her head. The wound was small and she’d covered it with hair easily. Sherlock wanted to sit next to her, but she didn’t quite dare. She was feeling better, Sherlock could tell, and she even made her some tea, without milk because she’d forgotten to buy it – as punishment for that, maybe.
Jo didn’t even have time to reply, before Sherlock took her hand and forcefully dragged her outside.
And afterwards they had to greet a lot of people again – important people, who were also there officially, as opposed to recreationally. After the last one, who even kissed Margaret’s hand, like in some kind of twenty-first century Downton Abbey, and took her to the director, to greet him, Lestrade supposed, Mycroft appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, in front of them.
The cab left them right in front of the entrance, so he paid and his mother thanked the driver no less than five times, and then she took his arm and they walked to the door, with a certain gravitas, Lestrade thought, as if they were entering a temple, the society of London’s strangest, and then his heart almost skipped a beat: Mycroft Lestrade was standing on the pavement, in a black suit and pumps, holding a black umbrella, a black bag slung over her right shoulder, and suddenly Lestrade could feel his back become a bit straighter, his head held a bit higher. He could feel that his mother felt it, too.
“I can drive you there,” Lestrade said, partly because he felt the need to leave the premise for a bit, but also because he still wanted to know whether Sherlock would invite her sister as a plus one.
“I’m so happy for you!” she said. He thought they were at risk of becoming relatives, all three of them. Then Sherlock rolled her eyes.
Two hours later, the first reports filed, Gregson placated, the architect jailed, he left Scotland Yard to find a black car parked right in front of the entrance. Agamemnon held the door open for him. “My boss has cooked ratatouille, monsieur,” the handsome man said, as he drove through the traffic to somewhere outside of town, which turned out to be an honest to God mansion.
Lestrade had to restrain himself from groaning. “Did you know about the money beforehand?” he asked.
“...never any money, or a hug, or anything, really, she hated my guts my whole life – not a single nice word! And then all that shit about my father, I… I…”
Lestrade suddenly wished for the floor to open underneath him, and swallow him whole, like the statue of Don Juan, maybe. He wasn’t sure.
“They didn’t disown me or anything – not after everything else I’ve done, but… they said it would pass. That I was confused, as if I hadn’t known since I was twelve… I think…” Sherlock stretched her feet, en pointe, they would have called it, because her parents had tried to sign her up for ballet classes, since she had the long legs and neck and arms that her sister hadn’t inherited. Except that it was nearly impossible to force Sherlock to do something she didn’t want to, even as a child, and therefore she’d never actually got to dance en pointe. “I think they were already disappointed enough. In me.”
“And you took the money, thinking it was your dad’s savings from a lifetime,” Sherlock said, with a slightly mocking tone, “and decided to flee to South East Asia? You already had an alias ready,” she pointed out.
“Your friend, the consulting detective, and her girlfriend! They are lovely together. How times have changed, and for the better!” Margaret added, before brushing her teeth and retiring to Lestrade’s bedroom, as he took one more blanket to the sofa, where he’d be sleeping during his mother’s stay, since he didn’t have a guest room.
As they worked, they bickered – about the milk, the experiments Sherlock left lying around, the microscope she didn’t quite treat with care. At a slower pace than usual, but they bickered. “Thank God you don’t do that with the violin,” Lestrade heard Jo say.
“You look great!” the doctor said, quick enough to almost cover Sherlock’s comment. She looked like she was in a hurry to join them, someone she knew among London’s best.
“The case is closed,” he said in the end, “and we’ll be there officially, as representatives of the whole police force. And Gregson says it’s fine, anyway.”
He called the fair youth’s employer first thing the next morning, thanking him again for the generous gift.
Once they were finished, Sherlock attempted to leave without saying goodbye, so Joanna dragged her to Lestrade’s office, where she thanked him for the patience, which made him smile.
For definitely not the first time, a thought crossed his head – admittedly unsupported by any kind of evidence: he simply could not imagine Sherlock Holmes in a relationship with anyone, man or woman. Even the tabloids never went past ‘gal pals’, although they’d gone to impressive lengths to demonstrate a relationship between Joanna and some handsome dermatologist who worked at her surgery. Sherlock had laughed when Lestrade had asked her for clarification.
Joanna’s eyes softened, at that – she stepped closer, put her hands in Sherlock’s elbows, looked at her in the eyes.
Lestrade guided them up the eight flights of stairs and through the police tape, flashing his badge, Sherlock completely unfazed, Joanna with her head bowed as if she was ashamed.
“Introduce me to your friends!” she shouted, so loud that Mycroft must have heard her. “Is she the consultant you always work with?” And she smirked, because ever since the very first time Lestrade had clarified that Sherlock was in fact a girl’s name, his mother had been convinced that they were going to eventually get married, even though Lestrade himself was already married at the time. Then again, his mother never really liked Sophie.
“All the children, crying,” Sherlock told him as they took him to the Yard for questioning, although he’d just pretty much confessed: he’d opened the door late at night, using his keys, because the old lady had started sewing again, and the machine was so old and so loud, and as if that weren’t enough, she’d turned on the fucking radio, and he’d heard the first two notes of the Hail Mary and his light had just gone out. He had a baby, for God’s sake, and she was a fussy sleeper, and she woke up every time the old bitch turned on the Catholic channel on the radio. You know, a man can try, but enough is enough, he kept saying, eyes on Lestrade, looking for his understanding, maybe, which he certainly could not give: he’d never had a newborn, or homicidal thoughts. Not seriously, although with Sherlock he’d sure as hell been close.
“I don’t want to lose what we have over a stupid mistake. And I will make a stupid mistake, at some point,” she articolated.
“What else did I say about them?” Sherlock asked, because she disliked talking about them and she knew it.
“Nonsense,” the employer replied, “it is a pleasure for us to have representatives of our police force, at such an important event…”
She’d carried the fancy dress in a small suitcase, when he’d driven all the way from her flat in the South to his own in London. He’d slept at her place, after arriving for dinner the previous day, after work. There, he’d found a very excited Margaret – the way Lestrade remembered being in primary school, the nights before school trips.
And even Joanna was upset, Lestrade could tell. As for himself, he’d never really considered the fact that someone, somewhere, must have generated Sherlock Holmes. And Mycroft, although it was even harder to imagine that they’d come from the same environment. Mycroft was much older; maybe something had gone horribly wrong in the meantime?
“You mean that someone killed an old lady because she listened to the Catholic channel so loud?” Lestrade formulated, mostly in disbelief.
“Maybe Jo’s into that,” he suggested, then. “Or you could ask your sister,” because Sherlock’s sister was much more well behaved than her and kind of nice, even, the one time he’d seen her – when a pool had almost blown up murdering both Sherlock and her roommate, and in the chaos that had ensued, Mycroft had emerged from a large black vehicle with a chauffeur and tinted windows and she’d solved a lot of said chaos with just a few phone calls.
“Yes!” Joanna said, with such intensity that someone who didn’t know her well would have seen her as hostile. “You’re everything I never bloody expected.”
“Don’t worry about the insurance – we told them she’d fallen from the kitchen counter at home. She always stands on the bloody thing when she’s trying to reach the high shelves, so it’s bound to happen someday, really. I always tell her not to…”
, one said; and it was by far the kindest. Mycroft saw them, Lestrade didn’t doubt it; but she said nothing about them.
“Yes, you can sleep now,” Sherlock replied, annoyed that she hadn’t been able to hear him. She took pride in being a light sleeper. “It’s five.”
“They’ll be on live television tonight, and our parents won’t miss a Racine premiere,” she corrected him. “I think she’s ready,” she added then. “Surely she must have realized what it meant. To take Joanna here.”
“The phone charger… she charged it in the living room, because she was scared of cancer or something. I wouldn’t have been sad. Not after some of the things she wrote…”
“So,” Joanna started, hanging her coat and sitting down on the sofa, in the space between her legs that was meant for her, “you’ve thought this through?”
At some point, somehow, Victoria Trevor, proud owner of a swimmer’s physique, the sweetest hazel eyes, and a French bulldog, managed to see in Sherlock the very thing she was trying to hide, and that not even she was entirely aware of. They met again that Friday night, right after another day of Sherlock studying in her room and in lieu of her usual night walk through campus. They kissed. Her lips were softer than Sherlock had let herself hope.
“You left home when you were twenty-two,” Sherlock said, a bit more bluntly than Lestrade would have. “Why?”
“I forgot to take it from the other car,” the Detective Inspector tried to justify himself, even though the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind.
Lestrade’s assigned partner was Anderson – not like he didn’t like Anderson; he was just a bit difficult to share an enclosed space with. The car ride was uncomfortably silent. The estate was large, old and poorly maintained, and it made Lestrade sad, like most cases involving the elderly. They reminded him of his old mother, who’d sold the family house in favour of a small flat after both of her sons had moved away and Mr Lestrade had died. She spent her days decorating it and crocheting and knitting and baking French bread, and generally trying to keep the vaguely French spirit alive – despite the fact that she herself was not French, and had no connection to France whatsoever other than through her dead husband. Lestrade tried to visit her as often as he could, and even though the occasions had multiplied since his divorce, she still lived pretty far away in the South, and she sometimes became a talking and walking reminder of his failed marriage. And even the walking part wasn’t to be taken for granted, nowadays.
“He or she – he, I think, despite the height – climbed down from the attic during the night,” Sherlock was saying. “Joanna, be a dear, move that chair over here. Like this.”
She took it from her bag, then stared at the screen, eyes blank, shoulders noticeably stiff. “Hello,” she said to the phone. “Hi, mum.”
“It’s just theatre. You don’t even like it. It will be boring and I’ll use my phone the whole time, and you’ll get angry. Why do you want to do this?”
“And how does it make you feel?” Joanna said, tilting her head as she asked, the way she always did.
He had a lunch date planned with Mycroft that day, and he was forced to cancel, on his knees, with his head covered in ash and two possible dates to reschedule, even if Christmas was less than a week away. At least, he thought, if Mycroft was as omniscient as her sister, which he had reason to think she was, at least she knew he was telling the truth.
“Never could sleep,” his mother said, “when you were younger, and you and Robert went out to dance every weekend, I could never sleep. Neither could your dad.”
“That almost never happens, Jo,” Sherlock interrupted her, and Lestrade noticed that there wasn’t any disdain in her voice, like there would’ve been if a Yard officer had said the same thing.
“He said to give the last two tickets to Sherlock Holmes,” he said, squinting, unable to help himself – his face had done the thing it did when he was a child and he broke the flower vases while playing with the ball in the yard. More specifically, the face he made when he had to tell his mum what had happened.
And sure enough, Sherlock appeared from around the corner five short minutes later – they’d somehow managed to park, Lestrade figured, because behind her, in a red dress and high heels, hair down and bright lipstick, came the doctor, looking embarrassed, but not too uncomfortable about the whole thing. And Sherlock and Joanna were holding hands.
“What’s going on in your life, Greg? Has something happened with that private detective of yours?” he asked him, because he, too, was deeply convinced that he and Sherlock were definitely meant to be.
Lestrade and the lawyer exchanged a look, a half smile, that meant that they were technically supposed to be disagreeing, but it was pretty obvious that they had a confession.
The man rolled his eyes – but his cuffed hands were shaking; Lestrade was sure they were close to breaking him.
Jo smiled. “Six months,” she said, which was less than Lestrade expected. “She knew I was… gay, and I knew she knew, and that she was also like that, but I thought she just… wasn’t interested. In dating, and in me.”
“Anyone would, if they were in her circumstances,” Sherlock replied, and Lestrade worried for a second that Parris was going to get angry, and stop talking altogether.
“They know.” Joanna scooped closer. “Your family?” she enquired. “There will be no coming back. They can’t ignore it this time.” Sherlock doubted that.
“But she bought the tickets like, forever ago, because she loves Racine,” Joanna continued, then smiled. And then a truly wonderful thing happened – Sherlock looked at her, and then she smiled, too, and something in her face mellowed, that Lestrade couldn’t quite identify.
“Not necessarily,” she shot back, even though, Lestrade thought, partner doesn’t necessarily have to mean…
And Lestrade foolishly hoped that she wasn’t only there to tell him that he was such a good friend to her gay sister, and that she was grateful for it. No matter how nice it felt, and how it was tugging at his heartstrings to hear it.
“So,” Lestrade continued, feeling like he was thinking out loud, and knowing it wasn’t wise in Sherlock’s presence, “if she was hiding money, it would be a robbery gone wrong.”
She nodded, then her face lit up. It was very easy to tell what she was feeling at any moment, Lestrade thought, which was a quality he liked in people. “How was your date?”
“But you did,” Sherlock pointed out. Something a bit heavy was in her chest and she didn’t like it. At all. She could hear her own heartbeat in her eardrums.
Lestrade’s shift was almost over – it was five minutes to five. His phone let out a single beeping sound, which was something it didn’t do as often as it once had, before the divorce. He picked it up without even thinking, expecting a text from his brother, a photo of the kids, maybe.
Still, no one had ever seen her room from the inside, and she spent most of her time studying during the day and walking around the university during the night, only occasionally sleeping; until one morning in late March she inverted her schedule, for some reason she couldn’t really recall, they might have had to do with Mycroft. She had time to kill so she went for a walk at one park she often visited at night. The French bulldog bit her ankle, the dog’s owner smiled at her, and one hour later they had become friends.
It was her first year of uni and it felt like the world had finally taken a break from tormenting her.
“Follow them,” Mycroft said, “I’m afraid you must,” and then, “I’ll take care of Mrs Lestrade. I’m sure we’ll have a lot to talk about. Just give her the keys, since you’ll most likely be late.”
The door, as Lestrade had gathered, had been still locked from the inside when the firefighters had finally managed to access the building from the bathroom window. Then they’d found the woman’s body on the living room floor, by the Christmas tree, her airways blocked and her windpipe shattered by the white charger of an ancient looking iPhone that some relative must have gifted her.
Sherlock was rambling. “People don’t usually guess it about me, though,” Joanna said, after a while. “Most of the time, with my exes, people assumed we were sisters, or just close friends.”
“Gave Mr Brown downstairs twenty grand to confess – he’s got a kid, she’s lovely, he wanted her to have an education or something. Something I didn’t have,” the son continued, “even though we had more than half a million stuck in the crawlspace!”
Once they got to the fourth, and last, floor, and once they were able to confirm everything they’d already been told on the phone, it was the Detective Inspector who dropped the idea first. Inside the flat the windows were all shut, and there were no signs of forced entry. She’d either choked herself to death with her own iPhone charger, and that, Lestrade felt he could safely rule out, or someone had been living inside her flat for a while, but only probably. He didn’t feel confident enough to take it for certain.
And Lestrade wondered, in no particular order, how on Earth Mycroft knew he was free – although that wasn’t exactly a wild guess, nowadays; and, more importantly, how on Earth she knew his shifts. Or maybe he’d told her – the memories of the previous night were blurry.
The truth was that she, unlike Joanna, who still occasionally had to turn away men who mistook her kindness for flirting and couldn’t take no for an answer, who simply couldn’t grasp the idea that Joanna Watson could be gay, she, Sherlock, was much easier to spot, or so she thought.
– had come out of her mouth for possibly the first time since Lestrade had met her, seven years ago, when she was a recent Natural Sciences dropout with too much money and no perspectives whatsoever.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. She joined her hands in front of her, and bowed her head, with black curls all around it like a halo.
“She’s not two years old!” Lestrade replied. “You didn’t force her to do anything. She doesn’t look like the type of person who lets other people force her to do anything.”
“I don’t want the bitch there,” the architect told his lawyer, who shook his head. Lestrade knew why he’d said it – Sherlock’s fame was well established; however enthusiastic they might have been, Jo’s stories on her blog were quite clear on her abilities. For a guilty person, Sherlock Holmes really wasn’t an ally. Still, it annoyed him.
Once again proving that something extraordinary was going on, Sherlock didn’t say anything else. Lestrade drove in silence another five minutes, mostly spent waiting in traffic.
Sherlock thought that it didn’t really make sense for them to sleep like this, hugging each other even though they were mad at each other, or at least Joanna was mad at her – Sherlock was mad at herself, too. She didn’t even try to close her eyes.
Soon afterwards they got to Lestrade’s flat, and they waited at the curb until he was safe inside, in the hallway. He climbed up the stairs to his door, at which point he remembered that he no longer had his keys. He hoped his mum hadn’t left it unlocked, because this was London, not some small town in the South. He was quietly considering sleeping in the hallway, to avoid waking Margaret, when he heard the lock, quickly followed by the door being opened.
They did find the son: two days later, on his way to the airport, with a one way ticket to Thailand in his pocket.
He dropped her off in front of Baker Street, where Joanna was waiting for them at the window, holding a cup of tea. She waved Lestrade hi from there, as Sherlock almost ran to the door. He’d never seen her run anywhere, except for crime scenes, or after suspects. Was the unbreakable Sherlock Holmes faltering?
She showed Joanna where to put her right foot and which cupboard to grab to lift herself off the floor and into the small crawl space. The doctor obediently copied her – her shorter legs more challenged by the height of the kitchen chair, until she could finally stand on its crocheted seat cover.
They didn’t hug all night, every night anymore, but most nights they did, at least just before falling asleep and early in the morning, to keep each other warm, maybe, since it was December, but also because it made Sherlock feel good, in a way she hadn’t experienced since her brief, fleeting months with Victoria, and perhaps not even then. She still disliked sleeping, still had a hard time falling asleep, still wished she could skip the nights altogether, but now a tiny part of her was looking forward to them, too.
was the nickname her classmates had given her at the all girls public school she’d attended. She could still feel it etched on her forehead in all caps.
“Letters,” Sherlock simply replied. “They were hidden by the blanket. Some have been taken. But there were too many for whoever did it.”
Sherlock wanted to hold, or to cover Jo’s tiny hand, which was resting on the stick, with her larger one, but she didn’t dare.
“Mycroft was an athlete, could do makeup, did extra curricular activities, had a lot of friends, and… he pleased people,” she said with something that sounded a lot like disgust.
“What’s this about?” Lestrade asked, praying to the gods, for his own sake but also for Sherlock’s, that it was something serious, because he’d been about to ask Mycroft out on a date.
“I’m sure Lestrade’s colleagues will be more than happy to investigate about that,” Sherlock said, then got up and left.
“I watched her all night, sorry I couldn’t make it sooner,” at which point Lestrade found himself even more confused, because he knew Sherlock rarely woke up before ten when she wasn’t occupied with a big case, and when she was, she just bypassed the sleeping part altogether. And no matter how late or early she arrived, she never apologized for it.
“Whoever did this must have been small,” Sherlock said, pointing, for some reason, at a tabletop, then at a cupboard. “Joanna will play the part of our suspect for us,” she declared, as her roommate rolled her eyes. It made sense, because she was smaller; she couldn’t be taller than five four. The truth was that she looked too much like Sophie, and Lestrade had been sort of relieved when she’d turned down the dinner.
“They were kinder… about it, than they were before,” and Lestrade could only imagine what exactly they must have said before.
“Bollocks” he shouted in the end. “All bloody lies.” The dam broke and he began punching the table in front of him, as his lawyer crossed his legs and buried his face in his hands.
“Have you read the letters?” Lestrade asked them, as soon as he remembered them  – he’d nearly forgotten about the letters when the team had called, with the news of the twenty thousand pounds. He knew it wasn’t good, to let two official nobodies bring the evidence home, instead of bringing it to the Yard immediately. He figured they were already in too deep and therefore it didn’t really matter.
“Thank you,” Joanna said, as soon as she was back on her own two feet, “I’m so sorry, I thought that something had touched my hand, and… nice catch though, that was…”
“For that consulting detective of yours, of course! She was such a great help in our case. She gets a plus one, too!”
, to be perfectly honest. They hadn’t kicker her out, or chased her with a shovel, the way Victoria’s father had, or the way some of the Irregulars’ parents had. They hadn’t hit her or called her names or anything, and they’d never done that on any other occasion. They were in fact pretty normal people, just not very loving. Everyone seemed to want to find something truly awful in Sherlock Holmes’s past, some great big trauma to justify the person she was. The truth was that there had been no such thing: they might not have been very loving, but nothing had, strictly speaking, happened. Actually, that was exactly the point.
And no one really knew how or when exactly she came along – she just started showing up to crime scenes with Sherlock at some point, adding medical advice and a further level of illegality to their consulting business. She was reluctant to talk at first, and Sherlock nearly had to pry her findings out of her; afterwards she’d grown more confident, and she was, all things considered, very bright. It was hard to notice, because she always accompanied Sherlock everywhere, but Lestrade didn’t doubt that, taken individually, Joanna was a very smart woman. She was a doctor, for Christ’s sake.
Afterwards she drank herself silly and she made a scene in front of her parents and Mycroft, mentioning the French girls in bikinis, Victoria and a few recriminations from her early childhood that weren’t strictly related. Mycroft surprisingly stood for her, although she was very careful not to cross the line. It ended up, unsurprisingly, not mattering at all. They used to speak twice a year, and they still did.
“Maybe it was a robbery,” Lestrade said, “only committed by the son himself. He gave poor Mr Brown twenty thousand to confess to the murder, and he was planning on moving to Thailand.”
“Not that there’s anything to make peace with,” Lestrade replied, then hoped he hadn’t crossed any lines.
They’d sewn her head back together – Sherlock knew that head injuries could bleed a lot, which made them look scarier than they actually were, and rationally she knew that Jo hadn’t lost nearly enough blood to be in any kind of danger by the time they reached A&E. But she’d seen her stumble on her way to the car, she’d seen her head fall to the side during the ride, smearing blood on the glass, as Lestrade drove fast across the city. She’d heard how slurred her speech was as she whispered ‘it’s nothing’, and she’d been… scared.
He made Lestrade sit in the back, as he drove to a rather fancy street by Hyde Park. Mycroft was waiting for him there. She was still dressed in black – he’d never seen her in any other colour; this time, it was a lacy blouse with a long skirt underneath.
“Was it the neighbour?” Joanna asked. “Is it solved finally? You were driving me insane. Why was Lestrade so busy, again?”
He’d never dreamed of asking something so personal to the consulting detective; but after he’d witnessed that phone call, he felt like something had shifted in their dynamics, like he’d finally breached some kind of barrier, which was supposed to be breached much sooner in most relationships. Joanna smiled with just one corner of her mouth, and without happiness.
“But they still think that it’s not a good idea given my public figure, haven’t I thought of my sister’s career, and that… they don’t want to judge, but they can’t agree fully, either,” she listed, staring out of the window. He hadn’t expected her to discuss it, especially not with him in the backseat; but he guessed it made sense, since she was trying to minimize. It reminded Lestrade of his own divorce, of the times he’d told Sophie about all the things that bothered him, just as quickly, staring out of other windows, while claiming that they weren’t bothering him at all.
“You were looking for something else entirely. What were you looking for? Christmas decorations? And you went searching in the crawlspace where you used to keep it – but you didn’t find Christmas decorations in there.”
Every single time it had happened – every single other time, she’d been concerned about her own interest: her own life, at the pool, her own respiratory system, when it had been on the brink of failing her, her own job and source of livelihood, both financial and emotional. But today, it had been about the doctor, and the doctor alone: the way she’d supported her head, checked for wounds in Joanna’s dishwater blonde hair; the way those words –
She’d been accepted into Cambridge, where her sister had also attended (and obtained a Law degree) and where she was studying Natural Sciences, although her parents would have preferred Chemistry. Unlike high school, no one was actively campaigning for her to make friends anymore, and she found it a bit easier to breathe.
“If your putative father didn’t actually dabble in stolen car parts, pray tell me, Michael,” Sherlock began, standing from her chair – she was taller than Michael Parris would have been if he’d been allowed to stand, “how do you think they made all that money? Working at a Ford plant? Please,” she said.
“This same identity is also the owner of a bank account in Barbados, containing seven hundred eighty thousand pounds. Do you confirm this?”
“The crawlspace,” she just said. “When we last checked it, I… wasn’t thinking clearly. I’ll climb there, this time.”
“I don’t think they do it for free stuff!” Jo snapped back. Which surprised Lestrade, because he’d never heard her snap at anyone, not even Sherlock, and that was saying a lot.
“Sherlock told you?” He felt the urgent need to run a hand through his hair, which was almost completely grey; his mother said it suited him. “It went well. At a café. We’re doing it again.”
“She was a writer,” Sherlock said, quickly setting the paper aside with the others. There was something derogatory in the way she said it that didn’t sit well with Lestrade.
And after all was said and done, after filing the report for the theatre case, submitting it and receiving a friendly pat on the back from his superior and an eye roll from Sherlock, Detective Inspector Lestrade ended up being stopped at the entrance of Scotland Yard, one Tuesday evening, by a fair youth who handed him an envelope containing four tickets for some modern version of Andromaque premiere at the most obnoxious theatre in all of London.
Mycroft was only one row behind them; she must have bought some really good tickets. She, too, stared at her own sister in amazement as she greeted their benefactor and his wife. She stared at the doctor too, with disbelief, mostly, and maybe something that resembled pride.
And those were all the words they managed to exchange before the time came to sit down and perform the boring rituals – and Sherlock performed them perfectly, to Lestrade’s amazement: she followed every nudge, every glance the doctor shot her; she didn’t say a syllable more than necessary, but she seemed very charming. The blue brought out the black in her short hair, and the grey in her eyes; Joanna brought out the softness in her features.
“But why did they have so much money? Or why did they live there, if they had so much money?” Joanna interrupted her.
“You mentioned that she likes theatre, sometimes,” Sherlock said, and Lestrade didn’t remember ever saying anything like that, which meant that it had to have happened years before, and Sherlock’s incredible memory had just stored the information somewhere, in some obscure drawer in the wing of her mind palace that was dedicated to the police force and maybe, hopefully, to him specifically.
“I always liked kids,” he began, then felt holy terror rise in his chest, because kids didn’t sound like a first date topic. “...but Sophie and I had none. I always took my nephew and nieces to the zoo, when they were younger, because I loved it when I was a child.”
Sherlock stared at the pavement for a few seconds – looking for something to say, she guessed, because nothing made sense, because she both felt like Joanna was right and like her own concerns were right and would eventually destroy everything. “Everything happened so fast,” she tried. “After the play, I mean.”
“Clichés don’t suit you,” Jo said. “I love you. It doesn’t matter if you deserve it or not, ‘cause I do.”
Sherlock was on the run – already in the hall, ballet flats clattering loudly; Jo stood at the entrance, looking at her flatmate – girlfriend, Lestrade corrected himself – the way a mother looks at a rebellious child.
“Now she won’t, after yesterday’s scare,” Lestrade said, not really sure of where Sherlock was going.
She dragged the same chair she’d told Joanna to use, then climbed on top of it; she was taller than the other woman, and could reach the space just fine.
Afterwards they went to a new restaurant – Indian, spicy, the way Joanna liked it. Sherlock, not so much, but she didn’t mention it. They hadn’t eaten out in quite some time. Since their thing had begun, a new awareness had dawned on them. Things that had never bothered them before now felt like concerns. Just like guilty men, who act unusually alarmed even when the situation wouldn’t otherwise warrant it, because they are guilty as sin.
Sherlock was waiting for them by the door, that Lestrade opened, struggling to find the hole in the dark hallway.
“Sorry, it won’t take long,” Joanna apologized to Lestrade, who was suddenly feeling very out of place, on the backseat. “I think they’ve seen the premiere on the telly. They’re the kind of people who do that, I think.”
“Such a waste of a perfectly good dress,” Sherlock said, when she finally ended the phone call and climbed back into the car. It was half past one.
“Let’s go outside,” the doctor said, as an affirmation, not an offer, and so they both got up and walked out of the police station, careful not to get too close to one another, always at arm’s length.
“From me,” Sherlock said. It was as if she had to sacrifice all the strength in her body just to say those two words.
Then she left for the car, and Lestrade was left scrambling for them, because he wasn’t going to call a cab at this hour.
“So what you’re proposing is to just go there and play close friends? Why not tell the press we have husbands while we’re at it?”
she replied, and at least, Lestrade thought, she sounded just as overager. No one had ever sent as car for him before.
They got to work. Sherlock, as smart as she was in most other aspects of her life, had never quite got the hang of the copy machine. John, on the other hand, was very efficient. “Mum was a secretary,” she’d told him once, “I might as well be one by now.”
“I… I didn’t want him to think we were together, which we were, or we were about to. I didn’t want to out you,” she said. She looked sad, if anything, that Sherlock had brought it up. “I may not have advertised it, but I never hid it, either. I’ve never… dated someone closeted, and if you’d asked me a year ago, I would’ve told you that I wasn’t going to start.”
“Lestrade!” Sherlock shouted, and, thanks to his good old days of playing football, the Detective Inspector was able to lean forward, and somehow, with his arms, catch the small of Joanna’s back, while the top of her head hit a nearby radiator with a thud, skull against yellow paint, peeling and stained black.
“How the tables have turned!” Mycroft commented, as her sister approached. It took him a bit to see why: she was wearing a dress. A plain blue one, with silver ballet shoes, no heels.
The piece was long and strange, and Lestrade had to shake himself awake twice, but his mother really loved it and it was all that mattered, he figured. Donovan was enthusiastic, because she was the kind of person who had the intellectual tools to actually understand theatre. Lestrade knew he didn’t.
She stopped in her tracks, and it took Sherlock a moment before she, too, realized the implications of what she had said.
She mentioned it first thing after the shift; Sherlock was reading some scientific papers on the sofa in front of the telly – she had no trouble focusing even with loud noises.
“For what I said, the other night, after the play. That you probably see yourself in that old lady, because of the… because of your upbringing, and because of the thing with Sholto,” Sherlock elaborated.
After a minute or so, DI Lestrade had to remind himself to close his mouth. They stopped at the Yard, for Lestrade to pick up the keys, while the two women waited for him in the car.
Later that night, in Mycroft Holmes’s bed, he thought briefly about Louisa Parris, née Elmer, about Sherlock and Joanna and, lastly, about himself and the warm body beside him.
At half past seven her wristwatch beeped – she looked at him with genuine disappointment in her eyes. “I have to go, I’m afraid,” she said. “It was nice to see you.”
After Margaret was ready, Lestrade stepped into his shoes and called a cab, because, official visit or not, it was insanely difficult to park near the most obnoxious theatre in all of London, and he didn’t want to make Margaret walk too far.
“Not as often as I should’ve, after my father died,” he replied after a while, which Lestrade knew was a lie, because the neighbours had told him otherwise. “I live in the North, you know…”
“You’re back, already,” his mother’s voice said. “Heard your footsteps on the stairs. Those shoes are loud.”
“Like this,” Sherlock praised, as Joanna’s body gradually disappeared, eaten by the foul smelling crawl space above them, “hold onto the little string thing – do you see any signs of…?”
“What if she got a haemorrhage, and the doctors didn’t see it? What if her skull’s actually cracked?
Lestrade was fully expecting Sherlock to escalate it – to say nasty things about Mrs Anderson and her profession, and he was fully prepared to physically stop either of them, if needed. But then Sherlock’s ears turned back to their original colour, and her lips, already ajar, ready to spit fire, closed again on her teeth.
He was unsure about how to go about it, though, so he just reached out with one hand, set it on Joanna shoulder, covered by her fancy coat and the sleeves of her velvet dress.
She smiled, exposing perfect white teeth; and when Lestrade thought she’d mercifully neglected to mention his pitiful state, she added, “You look quite handsome, as well.” He had to stop himself from shaking his head.
Treading lightly even on high heels – was she even supposed to drive in those? – Joanna reached her girlfriend, took out her car keys from her impossibly small handbag, and together, hand in hand, they walked to the blue car, Sherlock taller than Jo, even with her ballet flats. Lestrade was touched, really.
Joanna didn’t sleep, either – Sherlock could hear the muffled sounds of pages being turned, papers being handled by Joanna’s surprisingly delicate hands. And she felt a pang of hatred in her chest, towards the letters, towards the case and the old lady, and towards herself too.
When Lestrade called Sherlock the next morning from work, he was surprised to hear Joanna’s voice on the other side, and that he’d clearly awakened her.
“I wanted to make you realize,” she tried to say. “So you could decide whether you wanted to run away” she explained.
“Let’s not ruin this,” Joanna said. She closed her eyes. “I don’t want to force you and I don’t want this to be an ultimatum. I’m willing to do this for you. You have to think this through, carefully. Your parents, the trust fund…”
Sherlock and Joanna, clad in their dresses, wearing makeup, although Sherlock’s wasn’t as noticeable – and, most importantly, holding hands.
“So was Mycroft,” she pointed out. “Actually, I think they wanted another Mycroft – they wanted a boy, but another Mycroft would have worked too – and got me instead.” She drew a circle in the air as she spoke, quickly, as she always did when she was nervous.
“Are you OK?” Sherlock was between the two of them now, supporting the smaller woman with both arms around her waist and slowly guiding her to an upright position. Joanna’s hands were in her hair, and, as she pulled them out, Lestrade noticed with horror that her index and middle fingers were stained red.
“So,” she began, “who is going to be your plus one?” Which was a perfectly harmless question, really, after all, she’d listened to Lestrade from the kitchen, where she wasn’t even hiding, just enjoying her cup of tea in plain sight.
“Disappointing,” Sherlock said instead. She was not familiar with that feeling, Lestrade figured. “I really hoped there had been someone living in that ceiling.”
“The courting officially started much later, when she was fifteen and he was twenty-six,” Joanna resumed. “She resisted his offers, and started dating another farmer, Harry Walton.” Joanna looked entirely comfortable to the spotlight; Sherlock looked almost proud.
They made love that first Friday night, and then some more times, not too few but not too many. Every time it sent a new shiver down Sherlock’s back. When, in late May, she saw Mycroft for the first time since the fateful encounter, her sister shot her a knowing look. It wasn’t acknowledged.
The man whose name was on the ticket was also the owner of a recently opened bank account in Barbados, which took no more than fifteen minutes to find. On the bank account were eight hundred thousand pounds minus twenty thousand, and they’d been deposited there the day after the murder. His documents were skilled forgeries and he looked rather disappointed as the Detective Inspector was forced to arrest him.
“She used the sewing machine a lot,” she stated, as if it were evident, which it must have been, to her, at least, “and she listened to the radio while she did.”
“Here’s something you lesbos didn’t find in the bloody crawlspace: my mum had written a hundred and twenty pages of the same bullshit you’re telling me now.”
“You wanted to push me away.” Joanna stated it as if it were obvious, really; maybe it was for her. Sherlock wondered if that was how she always felt when Sherlock made her deductions.
“You looked so scared,” Jo began. Sherlock didn’t stop her. “I was unnecessarily harsh, in the car, earlier,” she said.
“Dad was a hard worker,” the man replied. “Worked ten, twelve hours every day, started out mopping the floors and made it to the top of the chain.”
“That they already haven’t… taken your trust fund away, because you’re… you know,” she said, gesturing at the two of them.
They ordered Chinese and Joanna finally ate her entire portion. Sherlock did, too. The last few days they’d slept together – the way they’d done at the hospital: coldly. The first night had been awkward, without the urgency, the sense of being in a situation that’s out of the ordinary, that the setting had given them there. The talk they’d had in the car, the one they’d had in the hospital bed, was heavy between them. The first night they hadn’t even hugged before sleeping.
They were at the Yard less than forty-five minutes later, standing side by side but not really acknowledging each other’s presence.
“I think… had I known… there was no doubt she was interested in you,” Lestrads said. “When you got hurt, on the scene, we all got scared, of course, but she… I’d never seen her like that before.”
“This is Sherlock Holmes? The famous consulting detective? The genius that other dyke writes about?” He spoke as if he had a large audience in front of him. “Because I know what you two are, you little…”
“I know you probably do it because you see yourself in them, but it’s unprofessional at best and I don’t have time to read through twenty pounds of Mother’s Day cards from an architect,” Sherlock let out, as if it were one single overly long word, without pausing to breathe or to think about what she was actually saying. She only knew she’d hit the mark when she heard Joanna leave, her steps made heavier by the late hour, the sadness, that Sherlock knew she was responsible for, and twenty pounds’ worth of letters and Mother’s Day cards. She made no attempt to stop her.
