“Your right. I should go.” Castiel smiles shyly at Dean and walks out of the room, shutting the door behind him. Dean doesn’t even have the energy to talk to Sam. It’s a conversation he would rather avoid. If Sam cares an ounce about what he just saw, Dean is going to be back on the streets when Chuck finds out.
“They call it the tree-house because it's a house set in the trees. All around this house is forest. No one comes out here and no one besides the people who inhabit this house know about it. The only non-inhabitants that know about this house now are you, me, Benny, and Chuck. Others have heard about it, but do not know the location. It should stay that way.”
“Yeah, Crowley is supposed to be here around five. I kind of want to get a few hours of target practice though before I leave. You down?”
Castiel smiles as he focuses on the words his mother just said. They’re meaning multiple, Hannah has multiple people with her. Castiel might be an uncle. Castiel and his parents all jump into his father’s Buick and roll away from the airport. The drive to his parents’ house is longer than he remembered. “Did you guys move? You’re going the wrong way.”
Dean scrunches his eyebrows as he thinks about the term. “Yeah, I heard it mentioned a few times, but what does that have to do with the tour?”
Charlie put the tape measure on a nearby hook and then shot Dean a serious look. “I’ll get all of your suits and then take them up to the front of the store for you so we can check out. You’re free to walk back to the desk when you’re ready.”
Sam rolls his eyes for the first time at Dean. “You know you're really stubborn. I’ve noticed that about you.” Sam turns over towards the window and cozies up to the door.
“Do you have a credit card or something?” Castiel grabs Dean’s wallet and searches through it.
“You scared me. I wasn’t paying attention. Welcome to Monroe's! What can I do for you gentlemen?”
“After you.”
Dean blinked a few times before shaking his head no. Crowley sipped his bourbon again savoring it like it was made from Jesus himself.
Dean snorts and chuckles a little. “Am I getting hit on at a hospital?”
Castiel closes his eyes to think of his next question. “What happens when I make my three wishes?”
Castiel smiles as they climb into his small compact car and make their way to the Salvation Army. Castiel thinks that donating to charity will up Dean’s good graces. It’s good publicity and it might give Dean new inspiration in life. Most celebrities give to charity just to have their name in the news, but if Dean donates to charity today then it’ll be different. Dean wants to quit music anyway, so his name in the news isn’t a win for him. It’ll only be a win if he was putting out a new album, or touring, or doing something that demanded the public's attention. Since he’s not starving for attention it won’t matter what he does. So why not use the charity to give Dean a new lease on life. Castiel continues to ponder as he grips the steering wheel. They’re almost there so he’s getting antsy. This is a big commitment, Dean will have to agree to give up his money. If he doesn’t agree this whole thing could go to shit, and it wouldn’t help anyone. They pull into the big fairly abandoned parking lot and climb out of the car. Dean closes the door slowly observing his surroundings. “What are we doing here exactly? I already give to a charity.”
to make your life complete. I want to do other things with my life anyway! I always wanted to go parasailing. I still can’t believe I haven’t done that yet.”
“What’s your name anyway?” Dean stands to his feet to survey Castiel like he’s a sculpture in a pristine museum. Castiel tries to straighten his posture and raise his chin a bit. “My name is Castiel. Castiel Novak.”
♩ ♫ ♩
Castiel sips the rest of his juice and walks his cup back to the kitchen. Dean walks to his room and flicks on the light. He opens his dresser drawer and picks an appropriate outfit. If he’s going to be working today he needs something light with pockets. Dean tugs on a shirt and then stills when he feels he has company. Turning around he meets a pair of blue eyes that are staring at him intently.
Dean nodded and continued chewing on the piece of food in his mouth. Crowley continued on without a long pause.
“Did he have brown beady eyes, short curly black hair, dark skin, and was kind of short.”
Dean puts his fork down and folds his hands up underneath the table. “Yeah.”
Dean fixes his eyes back on the road not saying anything. Why would he try to fight something that’s true? Dean startles when Castiel pipes up from the backseat. “I can drive Dean. I know you're tired too.”
Sam gets into position making sure to have his feet in the right position and then fixes his aim.
All the members of
Dean throws his head back and it thunks softly on the back of the couch. “Ask as many questions as you want. After all I am your genie for the time being.”
Sam pointed to a pin on the side and pulled it then slid it back into place. He waited for Dean to repeat his motions. Once Dean repeated the motion he spoke again.
Castiel opens the back door some more and peeks his head out. Meg is nowhere to be found. The doors to the pool house hang open and Castiel steps out a ways to close them. He overlooks the yard and swimming pool. There’s nothing out of the ordinary. He inches back up the walkway and to the backdoor, closing the door behind him. He turns around to face Meg staring at him quizzically. “Fuck! You scared me!"
head off too. He sits back on the couch, sighing in boredom.
Dean sighs and then gives Castiel a slight push towards the door. “We can’t have that happen again.”
So, like I was saying before not your typical A/B/O story. Alpha red and omega gold in this fic are achieved only by certain types of Alphas and Omegas and are only for certain reasons.
Sam nods his head.
Dean goes in for another punch but halts it mid air. Sam catches his fist, and Dean sweeps his leg to trip Sam onto the mat.
Dean nods his head in understanding before he slaps Castiel on the shoulder. “Look, here are the rules. You can wish for whatever you want. Your wishes won’t be
Castiel looks up to take in his sister’s appearance. She’s not that much different from what she used to be. The only thing that’s changed is her choice in clothes. Instead of wearing short shorts and tank tops all the time, now she opts for pants suits and blazers. “Hannah, how are you? It’s been a while.”
“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist for this job. Do you want it or not?”
“Alright those will come to fifty six dollars even.”
“Okay then, before you leave though. I heard Crowley saying that you didn't have any clothes. I have a few unopened pairs of briefs and a pajama set you can have. Take it as a warming gift.”
Castiel went back to placing the buttons slowly. “Yeah, I thought that was kind of odd, but go on.”
“How are things going with your training?”
“Ok, I’m going to measure you now. Don’t do anything drastic like suck in your stomach or move too much. It will mess up the measurements.”
Dean clutches the note and then puts it in the drawer of the night stand. He climbs into bed and tries to decipher what the note means until he drifts off to sleep.
“Hello Dean, I’m assuming you already went over the tour stops with Castiel. I need to let you know me and Chuck have already recruited an alpha for the Vietnam stop. We’ve taken him from treehouse and we have him at a local hotel. He’ll be stopping by your place tomorrow so you two can strategize about who’s going to be doing what. Your interrupting my message at the moment so don’t feel bad when I do this.” Crowley hangs up the phone without letting Dean get a word in. He looks at the phone speechless before he sets it back on the hook. Dean sits back on the couch and decides to spend the day and night looking over the stops and times of Castiel’s tour.
Charlie nodded her head and then walked from behind the counter. “Follow me and we’ll set you up.”
“Alright, I need a wee bit of your blood. Trust me it’s not going to be enough to fuss about.” Rowena takes a blade and cuts into Dean’s palm creating a gash that expels blood onto the dusty floor.
Castiel scrunches his eyebrows together and glances into Dean’s green eyes. He notices now how beautiful Dean is…for a genie. He has dirty blonde hair that’s to the middle of his back that’s in a bun on the top of his head. His face is blemish free except for a small unique pattern of freckles that brush across his nose. His lips are curved at the top creating a perfect bow in the middle and their plush with a swipe of spit from Dean recently licking them. He has broad shoulders that frame his body perfectly. He’s very symmetrically proportionate. It must be the genie genes. “That must suck. How long have you done this…granting wishes thing?”
Crowley looked at the redhead’s nametag and then scratched his chin.
Castiel opens the door and pushes inside. His eyes fix on Dean who’s sitting on the bed, playing the guitar and strumming lazily. Dean’s making it very clear to Castiel that he wasn’t expecting company. Castiel takes out some of the cleaning products and walks to the bathroom. “While I’m in here, do you have any complaints or issues that I should relay to my superiors?”
Castiel nods as he yawns loudly. “Yeah, I woke up like five minutes ago, but I’m going to go back to bed though.”
“Not yet. Junior doctors get twelve hour shifts. Lucky, aren’t we?” she smiles up at him, making Castiel squirm. “Want to keep me company?”
Sam looked at Dean before he smiled.
“Dean Winchester, how nice of you to drop by. Rowena was just making tea. Would you care to join us?”
He drives until they’re met by an oak wood sign where
“Cool, isn’t it?” agrees Garth, who breaks away from the conversation to run to the serving tables.
Castiel laughs at the familiar bickering. Even though his parent’s house has changed, they haven’t. Castiel slumps down in his seat. “I’m fine you guys. I’m just tired from the long trip.”
Crowley winked at Dean and then drunk some of his bourbon. He turned his head toward the window.
Castiel’s eyes scan around the room until they stop at the dining room table. The urn is back on it and this time it’s spectacular. All the diamonds and rubies are back in their original places. The urn is gold now and not bronze and dingy. The symbol on the top is polished and clearly readable now. Castiel still doesn’t know what it is, but it’s cool looking anyway. He walks over to the urn and lifts the top. He gasps when he looks inside and sees a little Dean lounging on a bunch of pillows. “What the hell, I didn’t know you actually lived in there. I just thought the urn called you when someone rubbed it. You’re tiny Dean. It’s kind of cute.”
“I said this is Castiel. This is who you'll be looking after until we tell you otherwise.”
Dean goes back to his oatmeal and looks on as Sam helps himself to a bowl. They chat away about shooting until they're scraping the last bits out of their bowls. Dean walks to put his bowl in the sink and then turns to walk towards the training facility.
Castiel stammers as he picks up his fork. “You didn’t even cook this, you just poofed this shit into existence.”
Castiel growls inwardly. “You're horrible. I got no sleep last night.”
“You can keep that I don't need it. You put it on like this.”
Dean huffs under his breath as he blows on his hands for warmth. Who knew he would be led around to fifteen thousand places in zero degree weather. Dean just want’s to go back to the hotel. “I didn’t know you were my daddy now?”
♩ ♫ ♩
Castiel smiles at the man before looking at his nametag. “Ezekiel, long time no talk. I was dead tired last night, I pulled a double so…”
Castiel pivots from side to side, his heart is thumping out of his chest. He’s talking to the sexiest man alive and he’s….he’s drooling.
Dean takes the time to process all the information. “Yes sir, I got it. Do you know who the help will be in Vietnam?”
“Yes, you did. I am sister Josie. Follow me.”
“Well, hopefully he won't try anything. I'm going to go to my room and take a shower and get some shut eye.”
Dean punched Sam in the arm before he gave him a disgusted look.
Meg brushes past him and opens the front door to greet the movers. She talks to them briefly as he looks on, doing his best not to intervene in the conversation. He sits on the bottom of the staircase watching Meg and the movers work their way through the house. They start downstairs quickly assembling the living room. Meg directs them where to put each item and the movers grunt in fatigue as they obey. Meg has always been stern with her thoughts, so he feels the movers’ pain.
Meg laughs a little at his flustered behavior before she fixes her mouth to point out the obvious. “This is new, right? Fenced in a community where you have to use a key code, it’s so fancy.”
The nurse picks up a clipboard and gestures for Castiel to follow. She leads Castiel down several corridors until they make it to a door that has a gold plaque on it that reads HR. Castiel thanks the nurse gratefully and then heads inside the small room. For a hospital this big it’s weird for there to be only one HR employee working. The man looks up with his smile bright and his eyes gleaming. Who can be this cheery while they’re working? Castiel brushes off the awkwardness and sits down in the chair opposite the burly man. The man extends his arm out to Castiel for him to accept.
“Give it a minute. He’s an idiot.”
Dean looked confused. He backed away slowly as he put his hands to his side. He sensed the man wasn’t a threat, but he kept his distance.
Dean winks at Castiel before he presses play on the remote “I’m just gonna umm…watch this movie first.”
Dean opens the door to the training facility and lets Sam walk in first. There are more people in here then there were yesterday. Sam finds an empty space on the blue mat and gestures for Dean to come to him. Dean walks over and paces in front of Sam.
Dean smiles and just pats Castiel’s shoulder again. “You’ll make it when you’re ready. No rush, I’m actually having fun here. So, take your time.”
Castiel smiled at the girl. He didn’t know their names he would have to go with endearments. “Yeah sweetie, here.”
“Ignore Dick, he's an ass.”
Crowley looks at Dean intensely, and the way that Crowley said that last sentence means that Dean should never speak about it. Dean nods and then looks onward trying to catch a glimpse at the guards. Benny drives on down the winding road towards the house. Dean flicks his eyes towards the tan and reddish-brown brick house. The house is big. It looks like a mansion with multiple rooms considering the sixteen windows he can see. The manicured lawn is immaculate with red rose bushes being watered by a sprinkler system. Benny pulls up in front of the house and stops. Crowley steps out and Dean follows. They walk up to the front porch and Crowley opens it. The inside is just as beautiful. It has a rose gold chandelier hanging from the roof of the foyer. The living room is to the right and the kitchen is to the left. Every room has a specific theme and color but the initial color scheme is deep reds and browns. There's a staircase leading to the top floor. It's wine colored carpet is inviting. There are men all over the house. A few in the living room watching television, and a few in the kitchen sitting at the island. A few are walking down and up the staircase. Crowley stands in the hallway and then turns towards Dean.
“Naomi said you’re the person to go to when asking the history of this house. She said you love to tell the story. I’m rather interested if you don’t mind.” Castiel leans his body more towards Raphael.
“The name’s Crowley. I see your down on your luck. How would you like a job?”
The older woman tilts her head to the side and drops the hanger in her hands. “This is just a family store. If you want to donate money the best place to do that would be online. I have papers that have the link. I also have a list that have other notable charities you can donate to. Hold on a second.”
Dean stands there dumbfounded wondering how Gordon was hired, how he got a hold of Dean’s case file, and how he barged in his house like he was welcomed. Dean shuts the door and follows Gordon to the couch. “How did you swing my case file?”
Dean nods as he finishes up putting the clothes away. He leaves a set of clothes out so he can take a shower.
Dean nods as he fiddles with his fingers.
In the morning Castiel dresses in comfy jeans and a hoodie. He grabs his keys and he’s out the door. Castiel zips through traffic until he reaches the hotel. He pulls into the hotel parking lot and parks his car in employee parking. Castiel pulls his hood on and throws his hands into his pockets. His breath makes white puffs of smoke as it hits the chilly air. It’s really cold this September, usually it’s warm around this time. He walks through the hotel lobby and straight to the elevator. Castiel feels bad for leaving his co-workers with an extra load of work, but this has to be done. Dean is important in his books.
“I thought so. Well it’s not too hard it’s more or less babysitting grownups. Do you think you can handle that?”
“No, it's just an old saying my grandpa taught me. He was a smart man. He was bat shit crazy towards the end, but he was smart. I'll give him that.”
Crowley walks out of the room and Dean heads to his bathroom. He takes a shower and brushes his teeth preparing himself to go downstairs for breakfast. He trudges out of his door and walks down the hall to the staircase. He makes his way to the kitchen where a group of alphas are eating bowls of oatmeal. Dean helps himself to some and stands at a distance while he eats.
“What's your story? Half of the alphas here are contract alphas and don't leave this house until they're on assignment, they die, or they leave to go home. Why are they giving you an out?”
Dean nodded.
Castiel throws his legs over the side of the bed and stands, popping every bone and joint he possibly can in the process. He walks over to the bathroom to relieve himself and brush his teeth. Looking himself over in the mirror he begins to shave the stubble starting to grow on his chin and cheeks. He finishes it up with aftershave and walks back to the bedroom where he opens the walk-in closet and changes into a pair of trousers and a button up. He begins to fix his cufflinks when a loud bang from downstairs stops him. “Honey, are you okay? What was that noise?” he calls out.
Dean cowers slightly, but makes himself known. “I….I asked Rowena to summon you. I would like to request a favor of you.”
Castiel puts on his white coat and he starts his first round. The ward is long, with the same blue and white tiles and wooden doors. There are forty single rooms in it, most of which are occupied by a patient right now. By the time he has finished his rounds and he has filed the records on the computer, it’s lunch time. Cassie comes back into the room. “Doctor Novak, would you like to join us for lunch?”
“He'll be staying at the tree-house. Make sure no one follows. Get him cleaned up and trained. I can't have him fumbling on the job. After he's trained bring him back here for evaluation. Now, both of you get out of my sight.”
“What can I start you off to drink with tonight gentlemen?”
, but you’re asking about the
He drives down the narrow road until he reaches the gate. Castiel blinks in confusion when the gate doesn’t open immediately; but it only takes a few seconds before the large gate exposes a road of cars. It’s kind of neat that he doesn’t have to enter a code to get out of the community, someone just needs to do some maintenance to it though.
Sam looks stunned as he pants for air.
“I only had to drive 50 miles. So, that should give you an answer.” Sam chuckles a little at Dean’s roughed up appearance. “I think that you slept too hard.”
Dean looks up to see Sam walking in his direction.
Crowley spoke up gesturing towards Dean.
“I think the big question that I would really like to know is why the hell are you here? You don't seem like the aggressive alpha type to me?”
“I assume Crowley here has told you the arrangement and the rules. There's nothing hard about this job just stay on your toes. If you fuck up and your not already dead, I'll kill you myself. Do I make myself clear?”
The large abode that the Winchester family calls home is the talk of the state. You cannot step foot in Virginia without visiting The Green House. It’s been in the family for generations, and it would soon be passed down to Dean if all the cards fell in the correct suit. It's quite a pity, because he could take it or leave it honestly. Dean doesn’t see the appeal for it. He actually hates it. It’s always dreadful to go outside with the swamps and heat, and he’s not really allowed to chat with the servants. Dean does so anyway secretly. Dean’s pretty sure they dread the day’s serving the Winchester family. The least he can do is be cordial. He’s next in line to inherit, and he finds himself wondering what would happen to them all then. Especially if he decides to give it all up. He would rather pursue his happiness via traveling the world and seeing everything it has to offer. He wants his father, John, and his mother, Mary, to give the estate to Sam, his brother. That chance was starting to look slim day by day though.
play something a little funkier but still rock sounding. Castiel is internally screwed. Spending a whole day with Dean Smith is going to be tough. He can’t touch him, look at him, or do anything he remotely wants to do to him. By the time Castiel focuses back on the music the cd starts replaying itself. Castiel looks at the wooden clock on his living room wall and realizes it’s almost 11:30. Castiel shuts the stereo off and heads to bed, wondering what day tomorrow will hold.
Castiel smiles at the table piled high with every food imaginable. This holiday might be his favorite holiday yet.
Dean blushes slightly and then pulls the safety on his gun and holds it at his side. The targets retract back into the ceiling and Sam puts his gun inside his holster.
Even though once upon a time ago Rowena gathered Missouri to be underneath her, Missouri has since proven time and time again that she belongs to no one. Rowena rolls her eyes before speaking up. “I barely know the man. He’s only been here a few times when he was younger. I’ve only dealt with his father. I’ve only got bits and pieces for helping one of the most prestigious families of Virginia. So where is my vindication?”
“Yeah my grandfather, Samuel, was an army nut and I feel like it's in my blood, hence the last name. He collected guns and army memorabilia throughout the years. I can tell you pretty much anything you want to know about any weapon ever produced. I can also teach you how to shoot. Which is what I intend to do. You ready?”
Castiel follows Naomi into the house and it’s even more impressive on the outside. He takes his shoes off in the foyer even though it’s mostly tile throughout. As soon as he shut the door his body collided with something. He looked down to realize two children were clinging off of him like a jungle gym. They peered up at him and they looked so much like Hannah. Castiel wanted to cry, he was officially an uncle. The girl looked about seven and the boy looked about four. The girl backed away slowly. “Uncle Cas, you said next time you saw me I could have a dollar. You promised!”
Benny rolled up the protective window and continued driving. Dean found himself adjusting into his seat. He kept sliding every time Benny hit a corner to sharp. Dean froze when he looked up to catch Crowley’s eyes. Crowley looked at Dean with amusement. He opened his mouth to say something then stopped as he gave a little chuckle. He cleared his throat before he spoke up.
Castiel laughs and points Dean into one of the empty rooms. “Maybe.”
“Where to boss?”
“It’s the archives and administration. And you shouldn’t be here, I guess. You are?”
“Of course it was a wish, Dean. I would like to be a well-paid surgeon.” Castiel closes his eyes again. When he opens his one eye to look around the room this time he’s holding a nametag in his hand. It reads Castiel Novak and surgeon underneath it in small red letters. He looks back up and Dean is gone. “Dean, where are you?”
“We're waiting for Chuck to get here and then we'll start.”
Dean waves a hand at Castiel and pounces on the hotel bed. “I carry it with me because eventually i’m going to get around to it. I just haven’t yet.”
as always i'm on tumblr if you want to come through and have a chat. we can talk about some of the projects im working on. @Ajacentlee.tumblr.com
“Wow, you're in a hurry this morning. You wanna spar, or shoot, or something?”

Meg nods as she shimmies into the kitchen. “Oh my gosh, honey come look at the kitchen! I can tell we're going to be hosting a lot of dinner parties here. I mean it's not my thing, but I can see it.”
The older woman nods her head yes as she goes back to folding the clothes. Castiel looks over the packet that Dean gingerly hands to him. “This is a nice start, but I want you to
Dean grumbles something back to him but it’s barely audible. Castiel decides to ask him when he leaves, so he doesn’t anger or frustrate Dean further. Castiel wipes surfaces tediously until everything sparkles. Once he’s satisfied he walks back over to the cart and puts the cleaning products away, taking out some clean sheets. Dean is now sitting in the chair facing the window. He’s still playing his guitar, but it’s obvious now he’s not even trying or paying attention to it. His gaze is directed at something down below on the sidewalk. Castiel hurries to replace the sheets. He has to be fast or else it’ll be out in the open that he’s clearly lingering. He finishes making the bed and directs his attention to Dean. “What did you say earlier? I couldn’t hear you over the water in there.”
“Nice to meet. You know my name, what's yours?”
It was an abandoned run down warehouse. What treasure would want to live here? He kept telling himself that this was an opportunity as he climbed out of the limo after Crowley. Crowley started picking up speed as he headed towards the two metal doors. Dean was right on his toes being careful not to scuff Crowley’s polished shoes. He looked back out towards the limo, but Benny was already gone. He took a deep breathe as they approached the doors and Crowley opened them. Dean was breathless at the sight before him. This wasn't just an abandoned warehouse this was a whole operation. Right smack dab in the middle of the sitting area are two cages hanging on the right and the left of the room. They have women in them. Dean figures they're omegas by the way the alphas sitting on the couches underneath them are squirming. The alphas are throwing money at the cages that the omegas will never get. The cages are sealed and suspended. There's a waitress going from couch to couch handing out drinks and getting her ass slapped. Dean assumes she's a beta because he doesn't smell a scent coming from her. The alphas are acting like animals. It makes Dean unsure if he was even supposed to be in here. He just started and he already feels like he jumped head first into criminal activity. He paced slowly behind Crowley as he looks from room to room. There were no doors on any of the room's besides one that was a huge double door at the top of the iron stairs. Every room was decorated in a velvet blue and cream color. He felt like he was in a giant palace except it was filled with smoke and the smell of liquor. Dean really focused in on one of the room's, and it looked like there were a few people cutting an ample supply of coke. They were packaging It into neat little boxes. Dean hurried past the room trying not to appear too nosy. Crowley proceeded to walk up the big iron stair case and paused waiting for Dean to catch up.
♩ ♫ ♩
Castiel and Dean stand by the register’s all day long paying for people’s groceries. Dean smiles as happy children and mothers leave with carts full of groceries. Castiel smiles too because it’s what he wanted Dean to see. Dean shouldn’t be worrying about pumping out the latest hit record, or writing a hit song for another artist. Those are semantics. Dean should be enjoying life as it happens. What’s the point of making all that money from record sales if you don’t put it in the right place. If you worry about everything you gain nothing. Castiel and Dean pay until the 3,000 dollars that was withdrawn from Dean’s credit card is gone. Dean still wears a smile as the last dollar is taken from his hand. They both walk out to Castiel’s car waving bye to the cashier’s. They climb in and Castiel starts the car, cranking the heater on. Dean looks out the window at the people crossing the parking lot. “What do we do now?”
“Dear, are you sure that’s what you want me to do? The darkness is impatient and if she’s called for no reason, she’ll have our heads.” Rowena stands up gathering the necessary ingredients to conjure up the entity.
The carriage slows to a stop in front of a rickety cottage with a large Willow tree in the backyard. Dean gestures to the coachman that he’ll be a few minutes before he walks up the cobblestone steps. His hand goes up to knock, but the door flies open before he gets the chance.
Dean smiles before he rests back on the pillows again. Castiel closes the lid then picks up the urn and walks it to the bedroom. “I guess we’ll see if you’re a real genie come Monday.”
Dean shrugged his shoulders. “Anything, I guess. I mean I was eating out of a trash can. Anything is better than that.”
Raphael scratches his chin with his fingers. “I’ll make sure to look them up then.”
“Yes, yes I am. Why?”
The receptionist wrinkles her forehead in confusion then fidgets with her mouse. She types on the computer before she looks up and shakes her head. “We have no one here by the last name Novak, sir. Can I appoint you to someone else?”
. “It’s Castiel and you can’t quit. It’s not fair to just give up on your fans. Who’s going to make good music if you do?”
starts playing out of the surround speakers. Dean walks to the stage and grabs the microphone. Castiel looks at all the bar flies who flock to the stage as the DJ announces Dean’s name. Castiel hears hushed whispers moving throughout the room. Some people wonder who this Dean Smith character is while others fill in the blanks. The crowd goes silent as they give Dean their full attention. Castiel orders a soda and sips it gingerly as Dean sashays on the stage. Dean puts the microphone to his lips, moistening them as he starts to belt out the song. Castiel is highly surprised Dean knows the words to the song at all. Whooping and hollering cheers erupt from the crowd of patrons. Dean eats it up, dancing from left to right on the stage. He bends down to shake a couple of hands, while winking vicariously. Castiel smiles at the sight of Dean in his element. He could survive off Dean’s happiness and nothing else if he had to. Castiel leans his back against the bar counter, waiting for Dean to finish engaging with the crowd. He slides his glass over to the left to signal to the bartender for another refill. Today is the day Castiel witnesses Dean get his mojo back. The bartender returns Castiel’s glass as Dean finishes up the song. Dean bounces off stage and bows to all of the bar patrons. Castiel didn’t think Dean could knock country out of the park, but the screams for an encore prove him wrong. Dean grabs Castiel’s glass out of his hand. “How did I do? How was that for connecting with my fans?”
“Why is it like that?” he asks.
Castiel just shakes his head no and then walks back through the lobby to the glass doors. He reaches his car and rests his head on the steering wheel. Next option is the hospital. This is so crazy. He doesn’t even know what he’s going to do once he gets there. He doesn’t know a thing about the medical profession. They’ll laugh him out of the hospital for sure. Castiel brings up the local hospital on his GPS so he won’t get lost. He starts his car up and drives down the road.
Dean looked confused. “Who’s an idiot?”
Castiel stares at the man and the table deciding whether to faint or try to get his phone back again. “I know what you’re thinking. Your phones outside on the front lawn, but you’ll never make it to the door. So, why don’t you….” The stranger claps his hands again and the chair opposite him slides out. Castiel screams again and he can’t help it if this time it sounds a bit girlish. The stranger laughs as he nods his head and closes his eyes. Castiel feels himself being pulled and as he looks around he realizes he’s now in the chair. “How you did…how did…oh my god.”
“You like it. I can tell. Do your job right and you can live a lot better than this. I bought you more suits I'll bring them by later to you. Don't take long with the sight seeing we still have another place to visit.”
The elevator dings and Castiel gets off on Dean’s floor. He makes his way to Dean’s hotel room and knocks with rapid taps. It takes Dean a few seconds to open the door. Castiel slinks into the room and throws the hood off his head. “Are you ready to get started?”
Castiel takes off his white coat before following her and Garth down the corridor as they head right towards the archives where he was earlier. As if she’s reading his mind, she says “This part is quite creepy, but the canteen is beautiful.”
Ezekiel looks at Castiel and laughs. “No you didn’t you nerd. You went home at like five yesterday. You said you didn’t feel good or something. You said you’d be at the bar though, but you never showed.”
“You heard me, hit me!”
Naomi fixes a frown on her face. “Chuck, you asking him if he’s on drugs isn’t any better.”
Dean chuckles a little. “I didn’t put it into the wish.”
The man inched closer but didn’t invade Dean’s space.
“Natalie, Tristan, stop bothering your uncle and go play outside!” Hannah rounds the corner with a frown on her face.
Dean scratches his chin again. “The only thing I can think of is my age was preserved. I was 25 when I made my third wish…so.”
“It was an old convent for the nuns. Now they live in a modern building beside the hospital. Most of them work here as nurses. The old part is now used for administration and archives and for the canteen. The rest of the hospital was built some years after that. That’s why the floors and walls are different.”
Dean mentally jots down the note and hopes that Sam is recruited. He kind of misses the alpha. He was almost like the brother he never had. Castiel taps the paper again. He does it loudly to get Dean’s attention. Dean’s mind is just everywhere right now. Crowley doesn’t have to worry about Dean being the distraction because Castiel is doing a pretty good job all on his own. The more he focuses on the job the more he’s unfocused talk about a contradiction. “Second country is going to be a little bit more tamed but still keep your guard up. We’ll hit a few places here instead of just staying in one location. Germany can be fun to sightsee and I intend on doing just that. Third country is Britain and I’ll more than likely stay in London only. I’ve been there countless times and I don’t plan on staying long. The fourth country is Italy which we’ll partake in the delicious food, and the fifth country which is my favorite, Russia. In Russia we’ll hit a few locations. I haven’t decided where yet, but they’ll be told to you beforehand. Russia is my biggest money maker. Since I’m a Russian phenomenon it’ll draw the biggest crowds. You’ll more than likely have help there as well. Got all that?”
The nurse waits patiently for the man to come back with the clipboard. The man doesn’t take long and the nurse calls the man holding his arm to the station. Castiel reassures his friends that he’ll be well taken care of before he shoos them back to the waiting room. The man holding his arm turns towards Castiel and Castiel gasps. He has shorter hair and he’s covered in dirt, but Castiel would recognize Dean from anywhere. The man smiles and winces at Castiel. “I’m ready, Doc.”
Bobby chuckles a little. “You’d like that wouldn’t ya, ya idgit. No, it’s not free. If it’s out there on the floor, I sell it. What’s your offer?”
Hannah smiles at Castiel before bringing him into a hug. The children scurry away from them and run into the living room. “It has been a while hasn’t it. I was telling Raphael that you would show up sooner or later. He’s been waiting to talk business with you.”
, or whatever that means. The only thing I can’t grant you is love, a departed person back from the dead, or granting you or someone else eternal life. Those are my three no, no’s. Don’t wish for those and you’ll be fine.”
Happy reading!
I thought about the direction I wanted this story to go in as I was writing this, and lets just say this is not going to be your typical A/B/O story. I want to write out of the box. Happy reading!
“Yeah… I mean, I will see you in the morning.”
Dean blinks his eyes and looks up at Castiel. Castiel continues to eat his eggs, but at the corner of his eye he can see sadness across Dean’s face. Dean looks back down and picks up his fork. “I’m ready to hear it, buddy.”
“What can I do for you, boss?”
“Before we walk in here I need you to know one thing. Let me talk, unless your directly spoken to.”
Dean sits up at attention to gauge whether or not Gordon is full of it. When Gordon's face doesn’t twitch or alter, Dean pales. “Are you telling me
Dean flicks his head towards Castiel and guffaws. “Sarcasm does not look good on you.”
Meg ducks back into the bathroom and spits out the toothpaste that’s foaming from her mouth, then she comes back out. “I said, you're finally up!”
“I told you Rowena, the next time you called me and you didn’t have something worthwhile…..”
“That's just Gordon. He's harmless. He mostly just stares at everyone a lot. He barely talks to anyone. I've only had a few conversations with him. He sticks to himself mostly.”
♩ ♫ ♩
Bobby nods and closes the book. “It’s not in here. It’s not even catalogued in my store. I don’t know what it was doing out there on the floor.”
“Hello Cassie. There is someone I would love for you to meet.”
Castiel takes Dean's hand and starts to lead him out of the bar. Everyone gives a huzzay to Dean as he waves bye to everyone.
“Don’t mention it. Really, don’t mention it.” Dean lays his head down on the suitcase and falls into a deep slumber.
The combination of a broken heart mixed with the illness is slowly becoming Sam’s undoing, especially if Dean can’t fix it. Which is why he’s currently sitting in a carriage on his way into town to see a couple of dear old friends of the family.
Meg wakes Castiel by opening the curtains and letting sunlight wash over him. “What time is it?” he groans, hiding his face in the soft pillow. “ I need like ten more minutes baby, please!”
“I'm sorry what?”
Castiel sits down on the recliner opposite Hannah and Raphael. “Oh, they’re great. The surgeries are easy and the pay is good.”
Castiel finishes the surgery and makes his way out the door and to his car. He has to tell Dean how his day went. He has to tell the genie thanks. Castiel drives down the road slowly, on account of the traffic, and makes his way home. When he opens his front door he sees Dean sitting on the couch catching cheerios in his mouth. Dean gets spooked because when he looks over to Castiel hundreds of Cheerios fall from the ceiling and land on the floor.
“What is this place?” he thinks out loud.
“By the way there is some talk going around that you might actually have to leave a little bit earlier then we planned. So, we might have you out of here by the end of week. Get as much shooting practice and hand to hand combat training as you can.”
Dean shoves the guitar back at Castiel casually. “And why should I? Give me a good reason?”
Dean shrugs his shoulders and then lets his fist fly to land a punch on Sam's jaw. Before it can connect Sam catches Dean's hands and then sweeps his feet off from under him. Sam backs away from Dean to let him get back up.
Castiel waves and then heads off in the opposite direction. Crowley and Dean leave the theater soon after that.
Dean wakes up to shouting down the halls. He blinks a few times trying to blink away the drowsiness as he rises slowly. He puts his feet over his bed and then stands up. He checks the clock on the dresser to see that it's nine thirty in the morning. He usually gets up a little earlier but last nights events took some much needed rest to adjust to. He decides to pass the time with exercise until Crowley can get there with his extra clothes. He does a few push ups and jumping jacks. If he's going to do this job right then he's going to need to put on as much muscle as possible. He's exhausted by the time that hears the knock on his door.
Dean backs away to let Sam get up. Dean gets back into stance and then closes his eyes and lets in a slow inhale. He exhales it before he opens his eyes. Sam comes at Dean with everything he has. He punches Dean in the jaw making Dean stumble back. Dean comes full force giving Sam a low blow to the right near his ribs. Sam is taken aback when Dean swings with a flurry of punches to his lower body and then one to the left of his jaw. Sam stumbles and then Dean maneuvers until he's on top of Sam with his hand on Sam's neck.
He looks at her with his quizzical blue eyes, not knowing what to say. She laughs loud and hard. “God! Don’t sweat it! I was being sarcastic! I’ll see you in the morning, sleep tight doc!”
. Dean grabs the microphone to address the audience. The audience has been screaming at the top of their lungs’ ever since the band walked out. Dean puts his finger to his lips and hushes the crowd. “I’m glad you all could make it. The band and I are happy to be here. I almost didn’t make it tonight because I was going to give up all this. I was at my lowest and I wanted to quit. I am kicking myself because I should have known better. One person helped me realize this is where I belong, by showing me that you all need me. Can you help me bring this special person on the stage please. Castiel, Cas, can you come up here please? I would like to sing you a song, baby. Is that alright with everyone that I sing a song?”
Dean gives Sam a concerned look but remains indifferent about the whole pulling over scenario. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. If we want to make the plane and keep good timing we need to stay on the road. I can keep driving, it’s no problem. You can go ahead and get some sleep.”
“Then I have no choice but to assume your mother had a birth that was outside of a hospital. It further proves my point.”
Dean gulps and holds out his hand for Castiel to shake. Castiel takes his hand and shakes it gingerly. He cocks his head to the side as a sign of confusion and then speaks up.
“Who exactly will I be babysitting?” Dean asked with a little hesitation in his voice.
Dean just nods and looks out the window preparing himself for his evaluation. Crowley drinks his bourbon and stays silent. He only speaks up to tell Benny to take them all to the B-course. Benny drives away from the house and Dean thinks about everything as he looks back one last time. They make it to the course and Dean follows Crowley out. The course looks like something out of a summer camp except it's filled with paper targets that are moving, different obstacles, and a tied up dummy with a few alphas surrounding it that sits off to the side.
“That was fantastic. You made time, and even better you beat the time by a long shot. You finished in ten minutes and fifty seconds. That's an all time best son. Let me just look over the targets. If you managed to do the right amount of damage we both feel that your ready.”
Castiel settles into his life as a surgeon easily. He also settles with the fact that Dean has also fit into his life easily. Castiel always comes home to Dean’s hi-jinks which at first he hated. Then he realized it wasn’t a complete day without them.  Like the time that Dean had rode a horse around Castiel’s backyard, the time Dean made a kiddie pool full of Jell-O in his living room, or the time Dean invited a few other genies for tea and croquet. That last one was actually pretty fun because Castiel got to meet a few other genies and they were hilarious. They pulled pranks on a couple of his neighbors. His neighbor Harry was pretty pissed off when his newspaper kept flying out of his hand every time he tried to walk to his door. Castiel realized that Dean was someone he had been missing in his life. He went through the actions day in and day out, but with Dean he actually felt alive. It was the week before Thanksgiving when Castiel made his second wish. He held out on making it because he knew he would be without Dean for a full week. That wasn’t fair to Dean though or so Castiel thought. Dean was lounging on the sofa flipping through the movies on Netflix when Castiel walked into the living room demanding his attention.
Crowley points over to a glass door that has a couple of alphas with towels draped over their shoulders walking out of it. He walks over the blue padded floors and opens a red metal door. Dean immediately hears gun shots and recognizes that this room is in fact an indoor shooting range. There are a few alphas doing target practice with pistols.
Castiel blushes immensely before turning away to gawk some more at the architecture.
Castiel screams and runs to the living room and grabs his phone. He pushes in 911 before the phone is snatched out of his hand. He tries to reach for it back but the stranger has it to their ear. “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to dial, dearie. I’m trying to call my grandkids in Topeka. Alright, buh-bye.” The stranger hangs up the phone and gives Castiel the death stare.
Castiel pulls his wallet from his pocket and digs out forty bucks. He places it on the counter. “Here, I don’t need a receipt. Thanks!”
“Thanks, I think I can get the hang of that with a little practice. I appreciate you teaching me how to shoot. Hopefully you can teach me how not to get myself killed in here. One of the alphas downstairs was just giving me the business.”
Sam looks towards his dresser.
“I would ignore him, but it's just...I have never seen him before. Why is he giving me trouble? I didn't even do anything to him for him not to like me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gordon flops down on Dean’s couch and gestures for Dean to join him. Once Dean sits Gordon continues the conversation. “Don’t worry about how I swung anything, I have my ways. You, you’re in danger, big danger. According to what I read you’re very unlucky. Have you ever heard of Alpha Red?”
“This is where you will be staying. Every room is stocked with a bed, dresser, television, and a phone. You will hang your suits inside the closet, your pajamas and normal attire are to be put in the dresser. You must also keep this room clean. The head in command here will do weekly checks to make sure of that. There is a washing machine downstairs so you always have clean clothes, and I will bring more clothes to you in your size tomorrow. Now, come along.”
“Remember what I taught you. Pull your safety, check your stance, get into position, look into your sight, fix your aim, and then pull the trigger.”
Dean cracks his neck before he gives a curt nod. He inhales slowly closes his eyes and then exhales before he opens them. Crowley gets out his stopwatch. He sets up the time and then tells Dean to get ready. Dean lines himself up at the start. Crowley takes out a whistle and sticks it in his mouth. Dean looks at the course before him and thinks about the best way to approach it. Crowley blows the whistle and clicks the stopwatch. Dean runs as fast as he can speeding through the obstacles. He jumps over hurdles, climbs through barrels, pushes through a 2 man sled, and runs through tires. He makes it to the targets and pulls his gun from his holster. He pulls the safety and shoots every moving target. He doesn't look at his work he just puts his gun back in his holster. He keeps going maneuvering over to the other side where the alphas are waiting for him. He slides in keeping a low stance and sweeps one of the alphas feet while he connects a chop to his throat. He jumps up and punches another in the groin. He connects a fist to the alpha coming up behind him. He uppercuts another alpha stopping him dead in his tracks. Once all of the alphas are subdued he unties the dummy. He throws the dummy on his back and runs to the finish. He drops the dummy gently on the ground and pants with his hands on his knees. Crowley has stopped the watch and is already discussing the time with Chuck. They both walk up to Dean. Crowley starts up with a chippy squeal.
Castiel hears birds chirping and the sound of a lawn mower mowing grass. He tries to blink away the sleep from his eyes. He smacks his lips and turns over on his side. He closes his eyes again and moves his hand over the other side of his queen sized bed. Instead of his hand being met by cold sheets his hand instantly heats up. He moves his hand again realizing that he’s not touching sheets. He opens his eyes wide and looks at the other side of the bed. “Hello sunshine, I didn’t know when you were going to wake up.”
“I think that we should at least pull over in the next town, get some sleep maybe?” Sam looks tired with the bags under his eyes that are puffy and slightly darkened.
Dean takes the duffel bag from Crowley and drops it on his bed.
Happy reading!
Happy reading! Make sure to leave comments and kudos for me. They really make my day.
Dean purses his lips up, smacking them to savor the taste of the drink. “ Damn it, is that soda? Anyway, I think I feel pretty good so far. I almost feel good enough to write a song.”
“So, you understand though right?” Castiel is looking at Dean trying to gauge an answer. When an answer doesn’t come he snaps his fingers in front of Dean’s face. Dean blinks and answers a slow ‘Yeah, I understand’.
Castiel shakes his head. “I can take this.”
“I’m fine. How are you dealing with everything?” Dean inches towards Castiel to be in his space.
“No you don’t. Pay attention Winchester, I will haunt you if you get me killed.” Castiel taps on the papers on the coffee table. “First country like I was saying before is Vietnam. My people say it’s good to hold something there for a war relief effort. This stop is going to be the most dangerous. There is a war ongoing and my little concert is not safe from it. I have a feeling that my father has something planned that he’s not telling me about. Don’t be surprised if you have help coming in.”
Dean thanks Castiel who is already walking to his door. Dean walks behind him. “Where are you going if you don’t mind me asking?”
Dean thought a little before he blurted out a random color. “Yeah, uh black I guess.”
“I’ll do whatever you want of me. I just need you to save my brother. He’s...he’s dying.” Dean drops to his knees, hoping to earn pity from the darkness. Dean is willing to do whatever it takes especially since he knows that the Darkness doesn't do pity.
Castiel is standing there holding his thumb, index, and middle finger like a gun. “Bang, your dead. Didn't you learn in your training to look through the peephole or ask who it is before you answer a door? Nice place....and nice umm....threads.”
The stranger laughs again. “Eat; I didn’t cook all this food for nothing.”
“People with no credit. Let’s go!” Castiel climbs out of the car with Dean’s wallet.
Castiel takes his chances and asks for himself. “I’m here to see Mr. Novak.”
Dean holds his index, middle finger, and thumb up to mimic a gun. “Shoot, I’m ready.”
Dean looks over to Castiel as they hobble down the hospital hall. “Do I know you?”
“Take us to the tree-house.”
Crowley looked at Dean with disgust. “Yeah, I suppose your right.”
“You're not fine. You're tired, and you're being completely reckless. Wouldn’t I be more at risk with you falling asleep and crashing, or me taking over for you and us getting there safely.” Castiel taps Dean on the shoulder a couple times to enunciate his words.
Castiel breathes a sigh of relief once he finishes sewing the patient back up. He did it. No accidents, no incidents, and no one knows he’s a fake. He goes back over to the wash basin as the nurses take over. Castiel takes off the protective gear and washes his hands and arms thoroughly. Castiel can do this. He has one more surgery this morning and then he can go home, he guesses. He doesn’t know how any of this surgery shit works yet. All he knows is he’s going home. He makes his way out of the room and reads over his clipboard one more time. The next surgery might be a little difficult since it requires a skin graft but he can do this.
Castiel takes the clipboard and nods at the nurse. When he starts walking away he can hear the nurse whispering to someone. “That was different. I knew he was weird, but I didn’t know he was that weird.”
He woke up at the crack of dawn and unfolded his blanket to look at the classifieds. Some of the jobs weren’t far from here. He could hitch a ride to the rest or walk if he couldn’t get anyone to pull over. He never got anyone to pull over, no one ever stopped for an alpha. They were too dangerous people said, too hot headed, too aggressive especially around omegas. People passed him by, but he kept walking. He heard no after no after no, but he still kept trying. He exhausted his search at sunset. He made his round trip to all the local shelters who accepted alphas. Everywhere was booked. He made his way to his favorite park. He watched the geese and the pond for a while. He people watched and wondered what others lives were like. The cold set in soon after that. He waited until there were a few scattered people around to rummage through the trash bins. He found a few scraps and dusted them off. He ate as much as he could. It wasn’t a lot. He walked to his favorite tree where it was secluded and set off to the side. He didn’t want a flashlight shined in his eyes by a police officer as he was sleeping. It had happened a few times before. It never ended well. He had been booked one of those times. It was a meal and a bed for a couple of days. The police were wary now to bring him and others like him into the station. They usually passed him up now and told him to move along. Sometimes it got physical. He hated those times. They hated housing the homeless they said. The station was for criminals they said. Dean laid down and put his hands behind his head. He slept briefly always waking up to geese pecking at his tattered clothes. He was used to it. He shooed them away and slept again. He repeated the notion several times throughout the night. He woke up at the crack of dawn and hit more places. He was cursed with no luck once again. He exhausted his search at sunset as usual. He chose an alley today. He went from store to store gathering old newspapers for his blanket and proceeded to make his bed. He set down enough newspapers that he felt were necess-
“Now, I better let you go. You’re starting in half an hour, which gives you time to get organized.” Castiel takes the folder, gets up and thanks Chuck, before leaving the HR office. He chooses to walk in the opposite direction from where he came looking for an elevator to get from the ground floor to the fourth. He finds one easily enough and up he goes. Out of the elevator there’s a white sign with the letters HDU written in bold, blue letters with an arrow pointing to the left; so he takes a left. As he walks through a pair of big oak double doors he finds himself in what seems to be a different building. The white walls are now a sad dark brown. The floor is carpeted with blood red coloring, rather than the blue and white linoleum tiles of before. The wooden doors of the rooms on either side are closed.
The house they bought is in a quiet suburb called Green Terrace. It’s a gated community hence the gate covered in lush greenery that blocks the inside view.
Happy reading!
“Table for two.”
“What? What about my eyes?”
“So, now you know how to arm and disarm a gun. Now, put the safety back on and then I'm going to teach you how to aim at a target. It's a little tricky at first because on some pistols like yours for example they have fixed iron sights. It leaves little room for you to adjust it. You wanna hold your pistol like this and then level your gun look into your sight and try to aim a little bit above it. I'll show you.”
Dean just nods as he thinks about the possibility of having a family of his own to look after.
“FYI, I’m not a man. If you wouldn’t have run from me I could have told you that. Now, are we having breakfast or what?” The stranger walks to the kitchen and flips a chair around to sit in it. He claps his hands and rubs them together. Castiel gasps in shock when he sees waffles, sausage, bacon, eggs, and biscuits all neatly placed on the table. The stranger smiles at Castiel. “Hopefully you’re hungry. Why don’t you sit down and help me finish this delicious meal I just cooked up.”
Crowley reaches in his pocket and takes out a MAC 50 and hands it to Dean.
Dean leans back on his hands sprawling out more on the floor.
“Listen, you can't think like that. The only thing that gets you through the tough shit is wanting to survive it. If you have motivation to survive you will prevail.”
have stayed at the hotel at least once. Dean was the only member to grow to love the hotel’s accommodations. Dean’s now a regular at the hotel, but he has certain preferences and requirements that Castiel doesn’t meet, so Castiel doesn’t see him that often. When Dean checks in he wants only women to clean his room. When Dean calls down for room service he wants the cart to be left at the door, with a knock letting him know that it’s there. He values his privacy which makes it difficult for Castiel to interact with him. Castiel only sees Dean when he’s checking in and checking out. Even then he has a couple groupies hanging off of him. He’s unapproachable and unattainable, which makes Castiel want him more. Castiel always volunteers to bring the cart to Dean’s door. Sometimes he’ll get lucky and hear a piece of a song that he’s working on. Castiel will quietly whip out his phone and record it. Other time’s he’s not as lucky and hears moans and groans coming from the other side of the door. It’s rather annoying considering that Castiel wants to be the one making Dean moan out
Crowley walks out of the shooting range leaving Dean alone with Sam.
have these freaky genetic traits? How? If you’re right they wiped them out in the thirties. How would I still have them?”
“Yeah, from what I can tell. It looks like it holds quite a few passengers plus cargo. I’m thinking that Crowley arranged for us to be ‘cargo’.” Sam puts makes his fingers into imaginary quotation marks to define the word cargo.
Dean nods and then clinches the side of the washer.
but i don’t know what i’m doing.”
Dean looks back up not moving a muscle. Castiel chews his bottom lip gently. “I want to wish for their freedom. Whatever happens after that I’ll accept, but I’m selfishly wishing for my chance at happiness. Dean…?”
The stranger rolls their eyes and chuckles a little. “On the contrary, I did cook it, but your mind only saw it as a poof. Let’s not get into semantics though. I’m Dean, and I’ll be your genie for the duration of your three wishes. Oh, and remind me to get the contract after breakfast so you can sign it. It’s kinda important.”
“I’ll clean that up.” Dean smiles nervously and snaps his fingers making the cheerios vanish into thin air. Castiel chooses to forget that happened, and makes his way to the couch. He plops down beside Dean. “Today was awesome. I performed two surgeries…successfully I might add.”
Castiel looks at Dean before he jumps off the couch to go fix dinner. He has work tomorrow and three surgeries lined up. He’s going to knock them out of the park.
“Well, we better make sure we're on it. Let's tackle the bags. Castiel…” Dean looks over the seat to see if Castiel is sleeping. When Dean sees Castiel resting against the door he smiles. “How long did he drive?”
Meg waves him off as she stands in the doorway. Since this is Castiel’s first day his anxiety is through the roof. This whole day is starting off weird, and he hopes it normalizes. Castiel climbs into their Nissan and rolls down the windows. Some fresh air might do a world of good. He has to be clear headed or else people's lives could hang in the balance. He waves back to his wife and pulls out of the driveway. Half of his neighbors’ cars are gone from their driveways too. Castiel vows that he’s going to pick up some gardening tools on his way home. Everything about this neighborhood just bleeds together. He doesn’t have a need to be different, but he would love to be told apart from everyone else.
Castiel tilts his head up at the rustic building that he found on google. It said all day karaoke on the advertisement. It was better than nothing. Castiel looks over at Dean who’s shaking his head in disgust. “Nope, no, nada, hell no, what is this?”
Mary had called upon Ruby to help take care of Sam, hoping that the bride-to-be would be everything that Sam chalked her up to be. Instead Ruby took another suitor faster than Sam could see a doctor. It devastated everyone, but it wrecked Sam completely.
Dean nodded putting his hand out toward Chuck for him to shake it. Chuck shook his head.
Castiel slaps Dean on the shoulder apologetically. “You need to get back to your roots. You need to connect with your fans again. I know you're a private person, but that ends today.”
I'm sorry to keep you lovely people waiting. I hit a roadblock with the plot, but i'm back. I bring you two chapters. This fic will have 15 chapters. I decided that 15 wraps it up nicely. I will be uploading 10 and 11 tonight, 12 and 13 tomorrow, 14 on Sunday, and 15 on Monday. So, this fic is going to be finished. Hopefully you all like the remaining chapters. Thank you for all who are hanging in there with me. Oh, this is also not beta'd so all mistakes are of my own doing.
Castiel closes his mouth that’s rudely hanging open before he fixes it to speak. “It’s October 12, 2017.”
Dean growls and clinches his fist. The alpha walks back over to Dean.
Castiel starts the car up and pulls away from the diner. “Yeah honey, get some rest.”
“Good, you’re done. What would you like to eat? It’s your choice.”
Dean looks at the evaporating black smoke, trying to decipher the foreboding warning.
Dean looks up at Sam with amusement.
“I don’t know, it sounded like you were asking me a question. Was that a wish or..?” Dean squints his eyes at Castiel.
“Is there something you want to say to me newbie. I've been watching you and frankly I don't like you.”
Dean’s eyes droop as his lips quiver. “I don’t know my parents. I was in the system until I was eighteen. I don’t even know how I ended up in the system either. I’m an orphan.”
Castiel slumps back on the recliner. Eight years, that means Hannah would have been twenty-two when they got married. This proves Castiel’s theory right. Natalie must be about seven. He’ll have to find out Tristan’s age in due time. He’s pretty sure he’ll find out during their next birthdays. Naomi and Chuck start setting out plates of food on the table. “Alright kiddos, this food’s going to go to waste if we all don’t eat soon.”
Chuck holds out a glass of bourbon for Crowley to take. He walks back to his desk sipping happily on his glass. He sits back down and waves towards the door. One of the guards leaves the room and Dean follows the guards movements. The guard does not come back. Chuck sips on his drink and then sets it down on a coaster on his desk.
Castiel starts waving his arms mimicking Dean. Dean gets up from the harsh snow and looks down at the angel he’s made. “Nice, I think I’ll call it Hope.”
Castiel blinks back disbelief as he picks up the thirty pound bag off the floor. He pours it on the bed emptying the sack completely. “This is what I was talking about. You need to reconnect with your fans. If you don’t reconnect then you could lose your fan base. Then you’ll seriously not have a reason to do music. Promise me you’ll read these.”
Dean and Crowley both thanked the waitress and began to eat. Crowley toyed around with the lasagna delicately. Dean could tell he was a man that enjoyed the finer things. His whole demeanor screamed upper class.
“Yes sir, Is there anywhere else you need to go?”
Castiel waited two months, texting and phone calls only with no update on the music front. It was the biggest relief for Castiel when Dean sent a letter saying he was officially on tour. Castiel will not admit that he ugly cried when he read it. He held the concert tickets that came with the letter in the air like Simba from the Lion King. Dean didn’t quit.
As you can tell updates for this fic are going to be a little sporadic until the beginning of next year. Happy reading!
Castiel just gives a polite smile and then answers back with a “Good, where am I at today?”
Charlie walked back over to the desk and started calculating up each item. She took her time to fold each piece of clothing. She bagged each item and handed it to Crowley. Crowley took the bag and handed it to Dean.
“I can smell you from here. You’re an alpha, right?”
“The names Carver, but everyone calls me Chuck.”
Dean’s eyes gawk open and rubs his chin. “Then it’s been almost 135 years that I’ve been doing this.”
Castiel rolls his eyes before he focuses back on Dean.
Crowley and Dean both shook their head no.
Castiel jumps up and falls over the side of the bed. “Who the fuck are you, and what are you doing in my bed?”
“Every alpha knows martial arts and boxing. This is where you will spar with the other alphas. There is also some exercise equipment in that room right there.”
“It has everything to do with you. You’re not getting what I’m saying. I’ve been watching you ever since you stepped foot in The Treehouse. You picked up how to use a gun and tactical combat within a week. That’s the fastest anyone that has been admitted to Treehouse has learned
“Night Dean!”
Crowley handed the omega the menus back, and then drank a little of his bourbon. Dean sipped on his water and waited for Crowley to say something.
Meg wisps out of the room, yelling in a high pitched tone behind her. “Not my problem.”
Castiel pulled a dollar out of his pocket and handed it over to his niece.
Dean walks back to his room which is right down the hall from Sam's. He opens the door and walks to his bathroom. He takes the longest shower he has ever taken. Hoping to wash away the remnants of his old life. He plans on making this new life stick and he'll die trying. He shuts off the water and changes into the clothes Sam gave him. He brushes his teeth with the toothbrush that was packaged on the sink. He puts it away and wades over to his bed. He still can't believe he finally has a bed. He lays down on it recounting all of the days events. He falls into a deep sleep soon after. He dreams that night, for the first time in a long time he dreams.
Castiel looks back up at the house again. “Yeah, I remember I just like to hear the story so I can see your smile.”
“This is in case you need to bring these back to have them readjusted.”
Castiel watches as the older woman gathers a packet of papers and hands them to Dean. “Is this everything we need?”
Dean gasps in shock at the harsh grasp on his chin, he nods his head nonetheless. The darkness let’s go with a shove to Dean’s head. “It is done. I will not retrieve you. You will come to me.”
Castiel smiles back before grabbing the clipboard the nurse hands him. He looks it over even though he knows everything on it. “Dean, right? Don’t you worry, I’m going to help you Dean because you’ve helped me.”
Dean holds out his hand for Sam to take. “Dean Winchester. It's nice to meet you too. So, he gave me this and I have no idea what to do with it.”
If he would have known he was going to be thrown in a soap opera, he would have prepared dialogue. All he can do now is just stand there and look at Dean like an idiot.
“Yeah? It's been a while since I've been on any assignments. I'm not complaining though. I like it here. I mean there's always your occasional shithead but you get use to that.”
Dean stares at Castiel dumbfound. “You have
Crowley nods his head before he turns to exit the room.
“I know.” she smiles “Just look at the countertops and the sink fixtures. Whoever owned this house before us remodeled it big time.” Meg turns the knobs on the kitchen sink making water rush out and splash against the stainless steel basin. “I know I don’t cook or wash dishes, but I might have to make an exception for this house. You said we have an alarm system though. I’ll have to call the realtor to see what the code is. First, I have to find the damn box. This house is absolutely incredible. I feel like we paid next to nothing for this.”
Dean nods his head as he tosses envelopes back in the burlap sack. “It should have been someone like you in my spot. You just seem to know what to do. I’m just lost walking around like
He turns to the voice. A white dressed nun looks at him from behind glasses. “I am doctor Castiel Novak, I was looking for HDU. I think I got lost.”
“I think this would be the jugular vein right?”
“I need this. Sam needs this.”
“First things first, the safety. Yours is right here.”
Sam taps his cheek a couple of times.
Dean stands there shocked.
Dean sighs and rubs his hands on his pants. “I go back…to my urn. The urn disappears and it shows up somewhere else. Just like how you found me the next person will do the same.”
Castiel takes Chuck’s hand and shakes it gingerly. He’s heard of Shurley before, maybe in a movie or something. He’s not really up to date in pop culture so it comes and goes. “Yeah, Castiel Novak. You can call me Cas for short. Nice to meet you.”
“You can actually call me Cas. It's much simpler. I don't understand why this man here seems to enjoy calling me Cassie.”
♩ ♫ ♩
Castiel taps his fingers against his thighs. “Like outer space type stuff?”
“This is Sam Wesson. He is going to show you the ropes while I get out of your hair. I will be back tomorrow around 10:30 sharp to drop off the clothes.”
Dean wipes the sweat from his forehead before trying to get up from the floor. “Like I said, it’s whatever you say.”
Crowley took Deans menu in his hand and then clasped them together.
Castiel smiles at her as she continues to mess with the sink and appliances. He does a 180 and explores the dining area. It looks big enough for a table and a China cabinet to fit comfortably in the space. He loves the hanging light fixture that would drift above their table perfectly, if their table was set up already. He paces himself as he explores more of the house. He goes from room to room and checks how much work he has to put into each one. The house is in excellent condition already, but it needs to be up to his standards. He finally ends up venturing upstairs and walks down the hallway, flickering lights on as he goes. The bedroom is huge and exactly what he expected it to be.
Castiel turns to meet Dean’s gaze looking puzzled. “Hard work and dedication huh, why didn’t I think of that?”
“I think my friend broke his arm. We were riding dirt bikes and he tried to land the impossible and his bike flew out and under him.” The nurse hands the distraught man a clipboard and tells him to fill out the forms. The nurse looks back over to Castiel. “Are you busy right now? All of the other doctors are on the floor with patients.”
“Absolutely not. I’m driving and I'm fine.” Dean rubs his eyes with the hand that’s not on the steering wheel.
Sam chuckles a little. “I didn't say that you'd land it Dean. I just gave you permission.”
Dean does as he's told and then fires. He makes four holes on the outer rings, and then two holes in the middle right on top of each other.
“I think I want to spar. I need to get as much practice as I can. I think I'm being moved at the end of the week.”
Castiel fumbles his way back upstairs. He can feel Meg's eyes on him the whole way to the top. He finishes getting dressed quickly and grabs his briefcase behind the bedroom door. Walking down the stairs he meets Meg at the bottom. He places a quick kiss on her lips and slaps her rear making her laugh in delight. “I’ll be home a little after five, hopefully.”
Crowley smiled before taking the paper. He quickly put it in his pocket and then started walking toward the door.
Sam walks over to the dresser and then hands Dean the packages and the pajamas.
Even the town sign is cheesy. Castiel glances at the buildings that look like movie sets. Everything is pristine and so old fashioned. The features of the town are colorful and the families that walk down the sidewalk don’t even look real. Where is the emotion? Where are the broken families? Castiel turns to Meg to gauge her reaction to the scenery that is about to be a part of their lives, only to be met by gasps and small smiles. “This is great! I knew this was the perfect place for us. Something just told me this would be it. Do you love it as much as I do?”
Here's where the historically accurate stuff kicks in. I hope I didn't butcher it to the max. I tried though. Happy reading!
Castiel clears his throat before quickly walking past Meg. “Yeah, I'm fine. I’m just hearing things, I guess.”
“Okay, I’m still freaked out by all of this. I understand what’s happening, but it’s still freaky so you’re going to have to give me a minute to process. I process by asking questions and I expect answers.” Castiel paces his living room flailing his arms about as he speaks. Dean is entranced by his fidgeting and just stares at him from the sofa. Castiel hasn’t even stopped to examine Dean closely. He should be fascinated by a freaking genie sitting Indian style on his couch, but he’s too focused on the monkey wrench that is this situation. How is he supposed to go to work knowing that a genie is in his house? How is supposed to sleep or go grocery shopping. How is he supposed to do anything really?
“Hired help? This is going to be...interesting. This is my first time actually having a body guard. I don't really need it but my father insists. I'm sure my father treated you with decency during your training?”
“Great, you got it. I feel like your picking this up faster than I did. I'm jealous.”
Castiel stares at Dean and doesn’t move a muscle. He’s hungry, but he doesn’t think he can eat. His stomach is in knots right now. Dean continues to smack on waffles only stopping to poof syrup in his hands to smother the waffles with. “Why me though? Why are you in my house?”
“You learn quick. I am very jealous now. I'm still going to kick your ass though.”
Dean nods and then rests his head on the back of the limo seat. He just met the man but he can't get him or his voice out of his head. He doesn't understand what makes this Castiel character so intriguing, but he's sure by the time he finds out rule number one will be broken.
Dean snorts after a few minutes and Castiel guesses he was speaking all his thoughts aloud. “This isn’t funny. You should be trying to help me instead of laughing at me.”
“Now, you try.”
“Good! Well, I'm going to go get changed, and then head home to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow Dean. It was nice to meet you.”
“Sure, why not? It’s a good ending to my journey. It feels like I’m passing my gift along to you.” Dean saunters back over to the chair and plops down in it, kicking his feet up onto the small coffee table.
“I don’t want any trouble. I’ll move somewhere else. I don’t want a fight.”
Castiel looks at Crowley with disgust. Crowley leans his head back and emits a full body chuckle.
“You do get a dollar, munchkin.” Castiel takes out another dollar from his pocket and hands it to the little boy.
♩ ♫ ♩
Naomi looks over Castiel again. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Dean looked at the carving and then back up at Sam. “You sure know a shit ton about guns. I feel like I've been put in good hands.”
♩ ♫ ♩
“I'm going to have to give you a strike for leaving your clothes thrown about everywhere.”
“Well Castille, you’re in luck. I would like to officially gift you my lucky guitar. I wrote
Sam stretches before he clears his throat.
The stranger sits up languidly and stretches their limbs. “What’s with all the questions, we haven’t even had breakfast yet.”
Dean just nods at Castiel not wanting to embarrass himself any further.
Castiel scrunches his eyebrows deep in thought. “Why was the back door open?”
Castiel stills in the snow to look over at Dean. “I’m thinking about it, but after you just told me all of that I’m not really sure now.”
the change immediately.”
“I'm nervous though. You have probably done this like a hundred times. I haven't done any of this, at all. I try not to fight if I can avoid it. I feel like I'm going to be horrible at my assignment.”
“Everything's good. I haven't sparred yet, but I almost got the hang of shooting. Sam is a great teacher.”
Castiel shakes his head and picks up the papers straightening them and putting them back on the table. “I’m going to leave these here. I already know my stops so I don’t need them.”
“These men are also employed by Chuck. They handle different things for Chuck so not one man is employed for one thing. You are the exception. Every alpha here has violent history which makes them useful for stickier situations. You will be staying here for the next couple of weeks to train and develop muscle. Your room will be assigned to you and I will check in periodically on your progress. On your last day you will be taken back to Chuck for your evaluation and to get the address of your permanent residence. You will also meet the client you are handling at the evaluation. Understood?”
“Yes, I suppose you're right. She just makes my skin crawl. Dean? You be careful what you ask, you hear me?” Missouri doesn’t wait for a response; she just steps outside, closing the cottage door behind her. Now that Missouri’s gone Dean can feel the evil seeping through the cottage. That’s why you need both of them; one cannot exist without the other.
Sam played with his fingers before he spoke up again.
“Continue on with your story.”
Castiel pulls up to the house and isn’t surprised at all to see Dean building a snowman in the backyard. Snow was to be expected around the first few weeks of December. He walks through the house to find everything spotless. He puts his luggage in the foyer promising himself he’ll put it all away once he feels like it. He walks out to the backyard to help Dean with his snowman. Dean sees Castiel and waves to him with the Carrot nose in his hand. “I didn’t expect you back so soon.”
“How did you do that? With the…with the…with the grandma voice. You’re a man!” Castiel stammers trying to get his thoughts in order.
This guest in particular though has Castiel foaming at the mouth every time he checks in. Dean Smith the lead singer of the rock band
The old woman grabs her purse and starts shutting down the store. She disappears to the back of the store as Dean and Castiel exit it. They climb into the car again and make idle chat until they hit the grocery store. Castiel pulls into an empty parking spot and turns the car off. “Dean, how much cash do you have on you?”
Dean nodded his head and gulped loudly. Crowley opened the big double doors and they were met by two guards standing on the sidelines. The guards looked Dean up and down suspiciously but remained quiet. Crowley took a seat in one of the lounge chairs in front of a big brown oak desk. Dean took the other seat beside him. Dean looked around at his surroundings, and felt like he just stepped into the oval office of the white house minus the American flags. There was an older man behind the desk who had a small stature but looked like he meant business. He wore a nice blue seat that matched his eyes. He had dark hair that was lightly peppered with gray. He tipped off the suit with a fedora that was cocked to the side of his head. He looked at Dean with disgust before he turned toward Crowley.
“Oh hush! Dean, what do you need?” Missouri stares into Dean’s eyes like she’s looking into his soul, making Dean flinch and look away.
There's a double window and a walk-in closet. There’s also enough room to put their king size bed in here without problems. He might be able to buy an entertainment center with a big screen television too. Castiel walks across the hallway into the bathroom  checking out the  black tiling along the walls. The puke yellow paint that aligns with it is sort of ugly. Castiel contemplates what color to change it until he hears a knock downstairs. He hurries out of the bathroom and down the stairs where he runs into Meg. “That must be the movers!” they say in unison.
Dean wakes the next morning in a lighter mood. Television commercials were right, when you sleep on cotton and satin sheets it feels exactly like clouds. Dean contemplates about getting up. He lays there thinking about everything that’s happened to me in the past week and a half. Someone going from homeless to satin sheets is remarkable. No one gave him a chance when he was out there. They all turned him away because of what he was and how he looked. Now he was resting his head and body on satin sheets and living in a stylish condo. How is that even possible? Dean stirs a little trying to get the will to get out of bed. He doesn't move until he hears a faint knock on his door. He gets up and slowly paces out of the bedroom and to his door. He opens it without a second thought assuming its Crowley only to be met by blue eyes.
with this thing. It was our biggest hit, you know.” Dean gingerly places the guitar into Castiel’s hands. Castiel’s eyes dart around on the instrument, looking at it like it’s a piece of the Holy Grail.
Dean stands at the corner of the room near his bed. He folds his arms in front of him as he waits for the head in command to make it to his room. He doesn't know who the head in command is yet because he's been too focused with his training. Sam has told him that these inspections are a walk in the park as long as you keep your room clean. They are only checking rooms for drug and alcohol substances which are hard to obtain anyway. Dean looks up as his door is swung open and his eyes land on an alpha who looks like he could be a talk show host. He has dark hair that's combed to the side. He smiles a slick smile before he looks at Dean. Dean looks down as the alpha strolls through his room. The alpha checks things off on his list. He walks over to Dean and snarls.
The darkness pushes Dean back onto the floor before grabbing him by the chin. “Do not ever speak to me in such a manner. You will hold your tongue from now on until I address you.”
“You're thinking,
Naomi smiles at her son and pinches his cheeks. “My precious boy, you’re too much for this world. Come on, I’m pretty sure Raphael doesn’t mind telling you the story. He loves to tell it.”
Castiel smiles as he reclines back on the couch. “I have new friends and everything. All of the people at my old job don’t even know who I am. I’ll miss some people, but I’m sure I’ll run into them again. I didn’t know you could do that. You changed my whole life with only one wish. I wonder what would happen if I made my next wish. I thought a lot about it at work. It’s not for me it’s for someone else, that’s why I’ve been thinking about it.”
“So no, I'm not aggressive but I have enough military training under my belt to make me feared. I guess that counts as another way into this type of work.”
“They were...they were...red. The only time I've seen that was when...never mind. Do you want to shoot now?”
Crowley drunk out of his glass again, he put the glass in the nearby cup holder.
Sam takes the gun from Dean's hands. “Wow, she's a beauty. Your on someone's good list. This thing set someone back a pretty penny. This beauty is all the way from France. You can tell, look here. You see that symbol carved there. This is an original production before they manufactured it.”
Castiel blinks and sits down on the sofa beside Dean. “I would rather be safe than sorry. Any movie I have ever seen that resembles this always has consequences for the wisher. Either the wishes get screwy or they wish for something they can’t have or whatever. I’m just trying to dot my I’s and cross my T’s.”
When he shows up at Clemming’s venue, it’s packed to the brim full of people. Castiel pushes through the crowd of people until he reaches the stage. He enters backstage and looks for Dean and the band. He hears hooping and hollering and heads towards it. Dean is high fiving a group of people before he spots Castiel. Castiel waves at him and Dean walks over. “What are you doing back here? Your suppose to be in the audience until I call you up?”
Clemming’s Hotel & Resorts helps and serves all types of guests, and Castiel just happens to work for them. Celebrities, chefs, teachers, doctors, veterinarians, you name it; they all come to witness and dive into the luxuries that one of the biggest hotel chains has to offer. Since Clemming’s serves high profile clientele Castiel’s met some big heavy hitters, and even has some pictures and autographs to prove it. Working with such big ego’s, Castiel is ran through a wringer
“What about you?”
? I don’t do favors sweetheart.” The dark entity, which is now made up of black smoke, strolls through the room preparing to leave the small cottage.
Sam stands up and adjusts his shirt before he turns to walk out of the room.
The figure moved closer and Dean backed away. He still kept his hands up just in case the person had a gun and was trigger happy. The figure moved closer until Dean could make out a man wearing a black long coat that hit his knees.
“Of course, I just wanted to tell you both that the captain is about to pull away from the harbor.” Sam pats his thighs quickly before turning and walking away.
“Everything looks good so far except..”
Sam walks Dean out of the laundry room and to the training facility. They shoot targets for a few hours. Dean's shooting has magnificently improved. His paper target doesn't have a single bullet hole on the outer ring. He knows though that a paper isn't the real thing and that still scares him. His sparring has also improved. He has learned the necessary fighting skills that all the alphas here have. He even has beaten Sam a few times since their first encounter. He leaves Sam in the facility as he goes to finish up his laundry. He hides out in the laundry room until his clothes are done. He goes back to his room and packs everything he has. He shoves everything in the large duffel bag Crowley brought him. He finishes up everything by five. He cleans the rest of the room to make it presentable. Crowley knocks on his door and ushers him out by five fifteen. Dean waves bye to Sam who's sticking his head out of his door. Crowley and Dean head down the staircase to leave. They pass a few alphas that are wearing protective head gear and are carrying a few vials of neutralizing spray. Dean see's them go into his old room. Benny is waiting out front in the limo. Crowley opens the door and Dean climbs in first. Dean has put on a significant amount of weight and muscle since he's been here. He's dressed in khaki shorts and a fitted tee shirt. His hair is styled and he looks fairly presentable. His holster and gun lay perfectly on his hip. Crowley looks impressed as he surveys Dean.
Crowley topped off his bourbon and replaced the bottle in the mini bar. He tapped on the black tinted window separating the back from the drivers section. There was a short pause before the window started rolling down.
“See you when Chuck calls for you.”
“Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow around twelve. Hopefully, I can get this whole shooting nonsense down quickly. Night!”
Castiel waves his hand in Dean’s face to get his wavering attention. “You can’t do that. I won’t let you. Take your guitar back. It was an honor just knowing you gifted it to me in the first place. I want you to keep making music.”
Dean hesitated but nodded his head yes. Crowley smirked and then smacked Dean on his right shoulder.
name. When Castiel knocks, Dean will answer the door in a robe, look at Castiel with scrunched eyebrows, and shut it until Castiel leaves. It’s truly the highlight of Castiel’s day even though Dean probably considers him a weirdo. This is the loop that is forever Castiel’s life, until one day it wasn’t.
“I'm here because I need the money. My family back home needs the money. All of my military training isn't going to get me a desk job, and I'm not going back to the army. I won't do that again. At least what I'm doing now I'm still in the United States. I'm closer to my family. Don't get me wrong, it is dangerous but it pays more. It puts food on the table for my wife and kid. It puts a roof over their head's without her having to work. She's an omega you know. I worry about her all the time since I'm not there to protect her. This is my last year doing this job and I'm out. I've been doing this for so long that I have enough money to break away for awhile. If I ever need more I can always come back.”
Dean doesn't have an answer. At least not one he'd say out loud. He can feel his throat burning, and tears he is flat-out
Quarantine got my writing speed at 💯👌🏽
"Dean," he says quietly, and Dean lets his breath out in something between a sigh and a sob.
It's a few moments before Cas connects, and when he does, Dean has to turn the brightness way up to make him visible in the sunlight.
Before he can think twice, Dean snatches his phone and accepts the call. Slowly, he lies back down and brings it to his ear, heart still hammering in his chest. He doesn't say anything. He can't. He just listens to the faint white noise until Cas speaks.
The light is orange at first, a rich golden orange like California poppies, and the wispy clouds in the sky are dashed with brightness at their edges. There's a slight breeze that ruffles Dean's hair, and maybe it's just being here, but it reminds him of the way that Cas used to absently pet him in passing. How that gentle touch had made his spine tingle, and the fond way Cas' hand would linger when he wasn't in a hurry.
He goes straight for the shower, and washes away the past 48 hours under a stream nearly too hot to bear.
The scent is strangely comforting, tugging Dean's mind away to a simpler time, a good old road trip hunt and the familiarity of a sketchy hotel. Sam warning him about the "lack of structural integrity" of a takeout container, then telling Dean he can't wait to take a huge sip of "I told you so" when that container leaks.
Dean obeys, and Sam clambers awkwardly into the driver's seat as soon as it's empty, adjusting it for his longer frame. Dean slumps dejectedly in the passenger seat, feeling frayed and defeated. He shuts the door, not even bothering to try and slam it, and just sits there like a kid in time out. He wants so badly to at least put on a show of his usual attitude, but he's drained. There's no point.
If Dean listens, he can almost hear more dominoes toppling to the ground.
Tucked under the base of the bedside lamp, there's a neat stack of sticky notes and scraps of paper. Dean recognizes his own handwriting on the exposed corners and edges. Curiosity will surely kill him if he doesn’t snoop now.
"Hey, Cas," Dean mumbles, shoving his hands into his pockets. He looks down at the floor, suddenly feeling like a nuisance, especially since he's painfully aware of why Cas is hitting the books—to help
Numbly, Dean watches as rust colored liquid runs off his body and circles the shower drain, gradually turning clear again like muddy tap water after a storm. He can still smell the scent of the blood and miscellaneous filth that was splattered across his arms and chest only minutes ago.
Dean finAlly gets his honey back. lots of feelings are felt.
"I'm fallin' apart, Sammy, alright? I don't know what's
The car rumbles beneath them, a constant, strangely soothing sound. Dean lowers his head down between his elbows and grasps the ends of his hair, hands shaking. And he just tries to breathe.
The last few words sounded almost like a snarl, and it made Dean jump. Still he had ignored it. He wanted to believe this reality.
"I'm fine," Dean mumbles without even being asked. But his voice falters at the last second, because he's just noticed the fucking
Spending who knows how long
"Dean."
Two empty beer bottles sit on the nightstand, labels peeled off and a little bit of water inside. Air plants had been placed in the neck of each bottle, one small and spiky, the other cascading gracefully over the edge of its container. Pale rings of water damage have scarred the wood beneath them where Cas has put the bottles in different spots.
"Just go get the fucking food so we can bring him home." Dean's voice falters on the last few words and he curses himself internally. He sure isn’t making a good case for not needing any comforting. "And don’t waste cash on me, I'm not hungry," he adds hoarsely.
" He demands. "So you're gonna just waltz off to Heaven with some random ass angel and, what? Find the mean girls table and ask for some gossip? And what's the backup plan if someone wants you dead, huh? Puppy dog eyes?!"
got you back," Dean says, quieter than he had wanted to. "And now you're leaving? Again? Every time I get you back you leave. Look, I'm sorry that I was the asshole you got saddled with all those years ago, but come on! You can't keep doin' this to me. I get that Jack is a priority, believe me, but dammit, anyone outside this bunker can burn if it means you don't die again." Dean's voice has started to waver, and he really hadn't meant to say all of that, so he falls silent and just meets Castiel's eyes, pleading.
The bathroom door opens with a long creak. Yellow light floods in, searing, brilliant, then gone.
Dean is jolted awake again by Sam grabbing the wheel, swerving the car hard to the right.
fucking worn out.
Eventually Dean can't avoid wondering. How many of the days in between, when Dean can't check on him, is Cas overcome by the Mark, hurting himself? How many days is he suffering alone? But Dean can't talk to him, not until Cas calls.
in the way Cas had said it. Maybe Dean would've said something then, if it hadn't been for the next thing Cas asked him.
Dean retrieves a fleece blanket, one he's slept under so many times when the car was the only hotel he and Sam were gonna get. It's worn soft, threadbare in a few spots, and smells like home. As he spreads it over Castiel's body, flinching when his fingertips brush cold skin, Dean knows this blanket will never mean comfort again. This is a nightmare, and he isn't going to wake up.
"You okay man?" Sam asks, voice grainy with sleep and concern.
Whoa I'm baaaack with a chappyyyyy
Dean ignores it. Dean wants to be pissed. He
Dean scoops up a handful of sandy dirt and lets it fall slowly through his fingers. He does it again and it's soothing for some reason. There's grit under his nails by the time the sky is painted pink. His palm is coated with dust by the time the clouds darken to blue-gray and pink burns into crimson. The crickets keep on singing. Dean wipes his hand across his face and a smudge of mud is left behind.
It took some effort to keep his voice steady. This line of speculation scares him, makes him feel ashamed. He has no right to assume he would ever get more from Castiel than he's already been given. He just isn’t worthy of it, least of all from such a powerful, divine, pure creature. An angel who saw humanity begin, who had flown every inch of the sky, who had torn through the legions of Hell, unafraid, unstoppable, just to…
Dean drops his head into his hands for a moment, swallowing back the lump in his throat. He hates to be in such a vulnerable state that simply realizing he's alone makes him want to break down. He fucking
Before he can think twice, he grabs Castiel's blue tie, clumsily undoes it, and tosses it off the bed.
Dean decides to go with that, because if he doesn't, then he has to go with "Cas sang me to sleep" which is much more difficult to even
Mind👏🏾the👏🏾tags👏🏾
He truly has no idea, no plan whatsoever, and that scares him. Bad.
It's late, and he lies on a relatively tolerable hotel bed, watching a moth circle the ceiling light, making a pitiful little tapping sound every time it slams its body into the plastic lampshade. Perhaps Dean feels some strange connection to the poor little bastard, killing itself slowly trying to find a moon that it will never have.
Dean winces, a raw cry escaping through his teeth. He nearly doubles over as jolts of pain stab into his temples, and he starts to stagger away, pressing both palms into his forehead. Following that deep-seated instinct he has to isolate himself when he's in distress.
Dean sits on the floor in what had been Jack's nursery, his back to the wall, knees drawn up toward his chest. He stares numbly at the cheery paintings above the empty crib, a distant bit of his mind wanting to make a throw-up-in-my-mouth joke about the overdone cuteness. That bit of his mind that defaults to joking his pain away, protecting him from anything that could break him.
"Dean. You drifted to the wrong side of the road. Get out and switch with me. Now," Sam says firmly. "I'm not losing
He's tried so hard, but he's failing to settle his nerves, still reeling from the horror of coming way too close to watching his brother die. A couple of seconds— that's all it would've taken for Dean to be too late to save him. The wraith had already gotten a few stabs in. Just one more would've been the end. Sammy lost so much blood on that drive back, and Dean had been so frantic he could barely stay on the road. He was in tears when he saw Cas, barreling through the bunker door before the car had even stopped, hands already glowing.
Night has descended completely now, cloaking the lakeside in the thick darkness that only wilderness offers. But even in that darkness, somehow those scars in the earth still stand out. The ragged silhouettes of huge, beautiful wings burnt into the ground, darker than the night itself.
Cas doesn't speak. Instead, he carefully lifts one unsteady hand to Dean's face, his thumb brushing over Dean's lips, leaving unbroken skin behind with that familiar, brief golden glow.
What happened? You're alive?! Just…just, what the
Dean fights to move, to breathe, to even
Cas sounds worse every time Dean hears from him. Occasionally he breaks the rules and sends Dean a tiny text, usually just one sappy emoji, and Dean's heart can't decide whether to swell or to break all over again.
Dean dreams of his little brother's blood, on his own hands, on the floors, dripping slowly down the wall that Dean's just smashed his head into.
The room goes silent and dark again.
was the one who asked what was bothering him, he was just responding truthfully."
Dean storms back into the room, knowing he's going to need help fixing up his hands again but unwilling to ask for it. Sam gives him a long look, his expression one Dean can’t really place in his stunted emotional dictionary. Then Sam simply grabs the medical kit from the nightstand and opens it.
calm down. But still he trembles, because the concept of forever—it's only this now.
Dean needs to see Cas. Just to know he's alive. He kicks himself for how irrational that is; of course Cas is alive. But rationality is the quieter voice tonight, so Dean gets out of bed, shivering as the chill air cools the sweat on his bare skin.

Life goes on, but Dean falls behind, and every day he watches it get further and further away.
. I know it's fucking selfish but—,"
Dean gives up trying to hold back his tears. He just lets them fall, feeling utterly defeated. Does it even matter, if he cries or if he doesn't cry? He's going in the ocean either way. There's no point in being strong, in holding on, in putting on a brave face. At the end of the day, he's

After a miserable moment, Sam nods, looking defeated.
The bittersweet, metallic scent of gore hanging thick in the air.

Dean pounds on the coffin's walls, claws desperately at them until his fingers are a shredded mess, skin peeled raw, nails split or missing. Useless.
Castiel just listens at first. But when Dean at last lets himself cry, albeit silently, he moves closer, until there's no space between them, and wraps both arms around Dean's trembling shoulders. Dean clings to him until shame begins to rise back up again, burning his face.
Dean sleeps, a suffocating, sludgy sleep that consumes him like quicksand. He dreams of light, searing, brilliant, then gone. He dreams of rain, of drowning, of black wings and the stench of burnt feathers.
Sam gives him that "but I just wanna talk about our emotions™" frown that Dean loves to roll his eyes at, but he gets up after a moment and crosses the room to his own bed.
Dean screams to fill the silence.
"You drank the bar last night," Sam states, his voice thin and tired, but level. He starts slowly unwrapping the soaked gauze from Dean's hands, taking care to avoid the many cuts.

"I'm sorry," Cas whispers, "we both knew this time would come. But I am so sorry."
This time, Dean finds his hand instead. Holds it close against his chest.
"I should've known."
now I can finally go all out on other fics without feeling like a complete fucking ballsack
Before long, the terror comes back as it always does, haunting images robbing him of sleep again, and Dean drags himself to the door, bringing a blanket this time.
They go on vacation. Dean hits rock bottom.
Dean's grip is still fused to the wheel, but he instinctively stepped on the brakes when Sam had shoved him back and pulled over with some difficulty.
"…I won't ever think any less of you," Cas finishes instead, his voice low and soft.
Dean drifts off not long after, tuning out the words and losing himself in the soft, low rumble of Castiel's voice.
"Dean. I can't—,"
his brain supplies— "wanna crash right now," he finishes instead.
Cas sighs wistfully. "I couldn't bear to put that burden on you," he says, and Dean believes him. "I wanted you to get as much solace from this as you possibly could before I told you."
None of it means
Dean thinks,
Cas closes the book in his hands and puts it on the table. He leans forward and fixes his gaze on Dean, squinting a bit as if trying to figure him out.
"Okay," he says calmly, and steps away from Dean to get himself ready to leave. Dean watches him, chest still heaving, adrenaline swimming in his veins with nowhere to go.
Dean whirls around and sweeps the blanket back up to cover Castiel's face. He could swear he felt the cold radiating from his dead friend, and something about it violently turns his stomach, giving him the sudden urge to vomit. He stumbles out of the Impala and stands there a few seconds, head spinning, willing his heart to slow down, forcing himself to think about literally everything
So maybe it took a few drinks for Dean to forget his anxieties, but what can you do.
When Cas shows up, Dean is lying on his side, facing the angel, blanket pulled over half his body but still very much awake. Cas lingers in the doorway, and Dean begins to lose his nerve.
Sam finishes patching him up, quietly and methodically, for a few minutes of heavy silence. Then he switches gears.
he thinks.
Another breath. Another try. No dice. He can't even get more than one fucking button done.
Dean is sure he'll at least feel a little less insane after Cas is laid to rest, and he doesn’t have to look at his friend's corpse anymore. That’s how it has to be. You lose someone, you say your goodbyes, and you suck it up and move on, right?
Dean holds his breath, not moving at all for almost a full minute before he realizes that he accidentally prayed.
two chapters today because i'm a playa i'm a playa
Dean closes his eyes for a moment, intoxicated by Castiel's breath on his skin.
He hits it again, this time with the other hand. Over and over until the pain drowns the panic out and blood pools in his open palms. He lets it trickle out, watching numbly as it slowly makes its way to the drain. The sink and tiles below are littered with the shards of red-streaked glass that escaped the mirror frame.
"If you say so, man." Sam's voice jars Dean from his self-loathing reverie. "All I'm saying is, you don't see his face when he's watching you."

Dean clears his throat and looks away. "Uh, yeah…yeah I'm okay."
He doesn't even know
Dean had been prepared to be as good as dead, and now he feels oddly empty without that doomed anticipation.
Welp we got another month of quarantine here in Washington and ya bitch is enjoying the hobby time.
Dean gasps desperately when he finally breaks free, breath hitching, taking in huge gulps of air like he's just nearly drowned.
" Dean sobs, no longer bothering to stay quiet.
sometimes your imagination runs away with you.
Dean drives up to the foothills of the Rockies at the east end of Colorado, and he finds them a spot that's high, deserted, and beautiful. He turns off the car. The windows are rolled all the way down and he can smell the sweet, green scent of the wilderness. It's crisp outside, but the sun is burning bright, scattering silver sparks across the small lake below them. Dean gets out and settles down on a log near the edge. He turns on the video chat.
Castiel is really, truly gone.
Dean doesn't speak for a full couple of minutes. He doesn’t move. The silence stretches thinner, tenser with every passing second. A drop of blood falls from his right hand, the tiny splash like a firecracker, separating Dean from his trance.
"Dean," he whispers, "my love. It's good to see you."
I heard you say
reason he can still see that box he
Dean's mind fills with static as he takes in Cas' words. He tries to hide from the conclusion, tries to think about anything else, but it's no use. His days of being able to contact Cas have always been numbered, and now that number has gotten way too small to ignore. He didn't have a plan for when his plan ran out of steam.
"Just breathe, Dean," Cas whispers, and
Nearly a year has passed now. Not a day goes by that Dean doesn't think about Castiel. It hasn't gotten better. Sam and Eileen try to help him, try to make his life less painful, and Dean appreciates them, but he knows he's not responding the way that they're hoping he will.
Castiel's not having any of it. He catches Dean as he nearly topples to the floor, hauling him back. He's not exactly rough, but there's a definite insistence that Dean can't find it in him to disobey. He bites the bullet and meets Castiel's eyes, preparing for one of the well-meaning reprimands everyone's been giving him these days.
Because for some
, even if we don’t ever
he thinks miserably.
Dean is gazing at the ceiling now, as if Cas could hear him somehow. He's praying, more desperately than he ever has, except maybe in Purgatory. He halfway expects to hear that familiar rustle of invisible feathers behind him, feel the breeze that carried the scent of Castiel, a scent that doesn’t exist now.
"Will you…just rest for a little while? I want to watch you sleep beside me one last time. If you would."
Dean has no memory of the past few minutes, much less actually falling asleep. In the sudden stillness, Dean stares at his brother for several seconds, eyes glazed and unfocused. Then all at once, his whole body just deflates, hands slipping from the wheel, shoulders sagging pitifully as the tension abandons them. He blinks a few times and looks away.
thinks he might've just figured out how to make an angel tired.
He's not prepared to feel the warm weight of a hand settle carefully on top of his.
"Listen to me, Dean." His voice is low and commanding, and Dean immediately feels his pulse react unbidden. "That extremely powerful, dangerous child is

Dean's breath hitches and he shivers, from the intimacy of the unexpected action as much as how fucking
"Yeah. Yeah I…I just wanted to see you."
Dean is about to reach for another, when he realizes he's been disturbing the pile with every note he pulled out. In a rush, he returns them all, hoping it looks at least close to the way he found it, then spins around and hurries back to his own room.
At first Dean assumed he was just reading into things too much. But he's getting less and less certain of that.
Days drag by in a haze, but no amount of whiskey, or trashed hotel rooms, or letting vampires choke him out a little longer than usual, can take the pain away. No amount of excessive stabbing long after the monsters are dead can erase the image of Cas being stabbed from his brain.
Cas is completely frozen at first, his pulse fluttering beneath Dean's fingers, heart beating wildly against Dean's back.
And he is in the front seat of the
On the other side, Cas exhales softly, but stays silent.
He glances in the rearview mirror and feels his insides fill with sand again. Castiel's body is lying still on the backseat, the blanket covering him pulled back a couple of feet to expose his ashen face. Sunlight spills over his neck and lips, adding a sickly false color to the skin.
Things are looking up. Dean is dense.
Sometimes, though, their eyes will meet, and for the briefest moment, something unspoken is communicated between them. Something that words can't express, some kind of understanding that feels peaceful and intense all at once.
It's not until his first night alone in days, that Dean begins to understand the full scope of
Cas takes a breath.
"You've got more freckles than I remember," Cas says softly.
Dean lifts himself up on one elbow. "Okay guilty as charged but I'm not fucking blackout, Cas," he says. "Just sayin' the shit I don't have the nuts to say
Paralysis. Dean is familiar with it. He knows it's not real, tries to focus on keeping that thought at the front of his mind, but it never works. The utter helplessness is too much.
"Cas, I
Dean nods, propping his phone up right next to his pillow as he settles into bed. He flips on the bedside lamp and curls up next to Cas.
Dean screams until he can't scream anymore, until his throat is ruined, until he can only wail hoarsely in anguish, until all he can taste is tears.
Is the unspoken question that Dean hears.
This prison.
Dean starts to shake. Panicked, he reaches out and flips the light on before Castiel can react.
Castiel doesn’t sit outside Dean's door anymore. That domino already fell. Now, he comes in, around the same time every night, and perches on Dean's bed to watch over him.
Then at last, he whispers, "Alright. Alright." He almost sounds a little sad.
He tries to ease into some sort of new normal, tries to have days or at least hours where he doesn't torture himself thinking about Castiel. About his beautiful angel, his angel who's been condemned to suffer in a living Hell for eternity—fucking
But nothing is okay. Dean can feel despair swallowing him up, flooding his lungs, drowning him. Still he forces himself to listen.
"I'm scared," Dean finally whispers, his voice shaking. "Cas, I'm scared I won't be able to keep him in, that—that one of these days I'm gonna let my guard down and he's gonna get out. Every day, every fucking hour I'm scared of him, and I
There are books everywhere, some of them open, and Cas' coat and jacket are draped over the back of the sofa, his blue tie crumpled halfway under him, sinking in between the cushions. He's undone the top three buttons on his dress shirt, and his sleeves are rolled up, and his hair is messy. He's fucking gorgeous.
Dean breaks the stare to squint at the dusty red glow of his digital clock. It's only been two hours.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay," he replies quietly.
about killing people. People I love. And it won't stop, Cas. I just want it to stop! I want him
Real sadboi hours
"It's okay," Cas says, "but Dean, we don't have much time left. I'm at 5% battery life."
Dean laughs a little, feeling both relieved and dismayed at once. "You're givin' me way too much credit, man."
With every step towards the fallen angel's body, so gracefully framed by those black markings, Dean feels the hole in his chest being torn wider. He steels himself as he stops a few feet away.
Dean wakes earlier than he should've. The storm has passed over, and the morning sun still shines pale and thin. Dean hears birds chirping and the occasional car rush by.
He wants to make this last—shit, he's actually
He flips sluggishly through the pages, until he finds a long, boring, wordy section on proper sentence structure, and hands it back to Cas, feeling incredibly self-conscious.
Cas looks a little exasperated. "Telling me you're okay when you're not," he says plainly. "You don’t have to play invincible for me, Dean. Never. No matter how broken you may think you are, I will still…"
It's not long before Dean's calls with Cas get even more spaced out. First it was once a day. Then, they started to skip days. Then, as if they could both sense exactly how fast their time was dwindling, there was an unspoken decision to change to once a week. That became once a month.
Cas asked, “Dean?”
Cas opened his eyes to see Sam looking up pointedly at the ceiling, and Dean sat back on his heels and began to laugh.
“Guys.”
Dean glanced at Cas, who nodded, and Dean shot the man without hesitation.
. It wasn’t like he was the first guy Dean had ever been attracted to, but he was the first spark of interest that Dean had let himself indulge in a very long time. Flirting with Donnie was sort of like a pressure valve in that way. Instead of keeping it all inside, he could just let a little bit of it out here and there. And yeah, Donnie had made the offhand comment once or twice that let Dean know that he would be up for more. However, Dean had never taken him up on it, and Donnie had never pushed.
He pushed open the door slowly, as if something might be waiting to jump out at him, and stood stockstill as the empty room revealed itself. It looked exactly the same, which was both horrifying and less terrible than he’d expected. There was no black sludge on the floor, but his heartbeat pounded in his ears as he took one and then two steps inside. Every beat brought the flash of a memory.
“She’s not the only one,” Charlie quipped. “Everyone back home moved a lot after the world ended.”
“You’re crying,” Donnie told him.
“Get over here and hug me,” she told him.
Cas nodded. They were quiet for a moment, and then Dean sighed. He stood and crossed the few feet separating the two beds and sat down next to Cas, turning to face him.
He waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry about it, kid.”
“My name… my name is….” he stopped, his eyes darting across his own face in horror.
“That looks witchy,” he said.
if only he could hold onto it long enough to see what it was.
He wasn’t sure where Cas was really going with this conversation, but he could tell it was going to be one of the ones that punched him in the throat, emotionally. He was getting better at those conversations, but it still felt a little like slowly peeling off a bandage over an open wound. Vulnerability was never really a defining quality of his.
He dug his hand into his jeans pocket and pulled out his phone, sliding his thumb across it and answering with a huffy, “
Behind his retreating back, Dean mumbled, “
Cas responded by squinting his eyes more than should be actually possible, and Sam sighed.
Things only got weirder when they got in the car. He managed to start the car, although pretty clumsily, but immediately slammed it into reverse and sent them crashing right into a dumpster.
It felt like both an eternity and no time at all had passed when Cas’s phone chimed with a new text. He tried not to disturb Dean too much as he fished it out of his pocket with his free hand and unlocked the screen. It was Sam, unsurprisingly. Apparently they’d run into trouble, and they needed backup.
Sam rolled back the footage and zoomed in.
“You’re welcome,” he replied. Then he told her honestly, “It’s nice to see you happy.”
The kiss was surprisingly gentle, considering the circumstances, and that wasn’t what Dean wanted at all. He sucked Donnie’s lower lip into his mouth and bit at it, relishing the subsequent moan and fingers tightening at his waist. He took the opportunity to slide his tongue past Donnie’s lips and deepen the kiss.
? That’s your response?”
“I don’t know,” Sam said, “maybe we should. I’m tired of watching you pretend like everything is
He and Cas weren’t on a hunt this time though, and they definitely weren’t going camping. They checked themselves into the last vacant room at a Motel 6, which wasn’t luxury by any means, but it also meant four walls and the presence of other humans in the nearby vicinity. Dean ordered pizza because neither of them were in the mood for socializing after a full day in the car, and they spent the night cramped shoulder to shoulder on the single bed watching I Love Lucy reruns and, admittedly, making out more than paying attention to the television.
“Maybe,” he admitted, “but Bobby’s got a couple hunters in the area. I’ll send them a text and see if they can look into it.”
Sam looked up to see if he was joking, and apparently he wasn’t. He said, “Yeah, he’s back at the motel. Said he didn’t want breakfast.”
Dean rubbed a hand over his mouth and stood up, wincing when Sam tracked the movement and narrowed in on his bloody knuckles.
Dean grunted and pointed at his coffee in response.
“Pass,” Dean immediately replied.
“Maybe not,” Cas allowed, “but I’ve done things. Hurt people. I keep
“She need help?” Dean asked.
“Hi,” he said.
“Are we celebrating or forgetting tonight?” he asked.
“Stop! Please!” she wailed. “I’m begging you, he’s not a bad person!”
He said, “You’re terrible.”
“I didn’t miss the trouble you always bring with you,” she snarked back.
Dean rolled his eyes, but his fake annoyance faltered at Cas’s fond smile.
His mouth felt dry as he realized once again that this wasn’t the girl he knew. He’d just started to question if he’d been stupid to ask to see her. It wasn’t like she had any reason to indulge his grief-fueled nostalgia for her alternate self. She didn’t owe Dean anything just because he’d loved a girl that looked like her. But then Cas stepped in.
Her whole face lit up then, and she looked so much like his Charlie as she animatedly answered that Dean felt most of his anxiety leave his body on a heavy exhale. Cas leaned forward and asked questions as she explained their new life together here, and Dean reached down to take Cas’s hand. He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to when Cas squeezed his hand in return.
Cas sighed. For now, he still had this Dean to look after though.
Cas was right about the bullet. When they found it, it was definitely of the witch-killing variety. So, the three of them settled in for a trek through the now very dark woods in hope of figuring out what Dean’s next move might have been.
“What’s the plan then?” he finally asked.
Cas could feel his eyes widen, but Dean just smiled in response to his bewilderment. Then, ever so slowly, he leaned in. Cas held his breath when Dean stopped, his lips just a breath away from touching Cas’s. Giving him a choice. Cas summoned every ounce of bravery Dean had taught him over years and leaned in the rest of the way.
What a waste of time it all was.
“There,” Cas said.
She said, “I thought you might know how to bring him back.”
“Yeah, it is,” Stevie continued pointedly, “because now we can’t kill this werewolf without killing some poor girl’s boyfriend, and she won’t listen to reason about what he really is.”
“Well, I’m here whenever you’re ready,” he said.
The surprise addition to the household had been Claire. She and Jody got into some kind of teenage angst filled argument according to Jody’s warning text, and she’d shown up on their doorstep with little more than a backpack and a scowl on her face. They’d barely gotten two words out of her, but whatever was going on at home, apparently she thought sulking around the bunker with the Winchester’s was preferable. Dean wasn’t so sure he would agree, but that was her choice. If she wanted to be miserable and glare at her phone, she’d probably come to the right place.
They pulled into a weathered looking B&B with a flashing vacancy sign and got themselves a room before venturing out. It was the kind of place that probably had a waiting list a mile long in the middle of July, but the check-in clerk seemed grateful to see any customers at all at this time of year. It was chilly and looked like it might rain, but Dean didn’t mind. He’d started to feel a little like a kid on vacation when he’d rolled down the window of the Impala and smelled saltwater. Not that he knew what a kid felt like on a vacation from experience, but he could only imagine it felt a little like this.
“That,” Cas said, a little breathless himself, “is my response.”
“Well, that’s something at least,” Sam sighed. He pulled out his own phone and said, “I guess I’ll text Mom and tell her to call me in case of emergency. And Cas, to let him know you’re okay.”
“And all that stuff about family and compassion and... love,” Dean said, swallowing roughly around the word as he held Cas’s gaze. “Me too, Cas.”
He said, “Tell her I said hi.”
Before he could catch himself, Dean replied, “It’s not the same. What I’m doing, it’s not grieving, it’s….”
Sam huffed this time before saying, “Dean, you can’t stay here forever. I mean, you’re not eating and you’re barely sleeping. I haven’t seen you drink a glass of water in
Sam had to bite back a laugh when he turned and saw Dean’s gobsmacked expression, followed by an absolutely murderous look on Cas’s face.
They both stopped, and Dean almost laughed until he registered what Cas was starting to say.
There was a chill in the air as they set out the next morning well before check out time. Cas was driving, on the grounds that the motel had run out of the crappy instant coffee it usually provided its guests, and Dean had woken up in a sour mood about it. He pulled off about ten miles down the road at a Love’s to fill up the tank, and when he came back from inside the gas station, he had two large coffees in his hands.
He smiled to himself and turned around before she could see it. She may be a pain in the ass when she wanted to be, but she was a good kid.
“What happened next…” Cas looked over at the peeling floral wallpaper as he tried to think of what to say. Finally, he said, “The righteous man never gave up on the angel, and the angel already had his own doubts; about Heaven, about his father’s plan. So, he decided to help the man. He rebelled.”
He asked, “Dean, where the hell have you been?”
Tears were flowing freely down her face, and she didn’t make a move to wipe them away as she said, “Isn’t there someone you love? Someone that you’d die for?”
“Well, hello gorgeous,” Dean said. “Do I know you?”
“Dude, aren’t you a little old for this?” he asked, gesturing at Dean’s clearly hungover state, “I mean, you had a good run, but.”
The werewolf made a run for it, and Dean caught him in a chokehold. He struggled wildly, but Dean tightened his arms around the wolf’s neck.
Dean had been quiet since he’d gotten his memories back. It was the familiar kind of quiet though, and that was both reassuring and worrying in equal measure.
When they got back to the motel, Rowena was there waiting for them. Despite the fact that they didn’t
Before he could say anything else though, Cas took two steps to close the distance between them and kissed him.
It was early the next morning when Sam’s phone rang. He and Cas exchanged a quick look before he grabbed it and saw it was an unknown number. Still, considering Dean had been missing for twelve hours, he answered.
Dean watched as his deft hands poured the whiskey in two impossibly even lines before sitting the bottle back down on the counter. He picked up one glass, and Dean did the same before clinking their cups together.
“Yeah, well, stop it,” Dean replied as he took back his now full glass.
“Well, that’s unfortunate,” Dean said bluntly.
He started to move away, but Cas reached out and grasped his wrist tightly.
for a house call, Sam thought bitterly. However, he had to reluctantly admit that they could use her help. If killing the witch hadn’t broken the curse, that meant they were officially in over their heads, and Dean was getting worse by the minute.
to do the right thing, always, but sometimes I think maybe the world would be better off if I just stopped.”
like this, of someone giving and taking and not asking questions.
“I…” Dean stuttered, reaching up to feel his own face. “What?”
Cas replied, “I’m sorry for what I said to summon the Empty. That wasn’t fair to you.”
“We’re looking for signs of the witch who cursed you,” Cas patiently replied.
His answer didn’t objectively make a ton of sense, but Dean thought he knew what he meant anyway. Whatever Cas had experienced as angel wasn’t like being human and looking out into something bigger than you could ever dare to be. Like standing on the edge of the vast unknown, no idea what lay in its depths. He thought a little hysterically that it felt sort of like the freedom they’d recently found themselves saddled with.
Dean looked back then, and Sam watched the recognition click into place. Dean schooled his face into its normal appearance immediately and slapped a bewildered Cas on the shoulder.
“Yes,” Cas agreed, not rising to his bait, “but it wasn’t like this.”
Sam’s eyes widened, and he looked over his shoulder at the mechanical bull, which was currently doing its best to throw some drunk wannabe cowboy across the room.
him?”
Speaking of which.
“Now, Charlie,” he said, through clenched teeth. “Just don’t shoot me.”
He and Cas bundled up, at Dean’s insistence because Cas seemed perfectly content to stroll out the door in jeans and a t-shirt. They were still working on the whole weather-appropriate clothing thing. Then they walked down the sidewalk until they reached the small path that led down to the public beach.
“Hey, maybe we can swing by Jody’s and see the girls when we’re done.”
When they got there, Dean jumped out of the car and started for the door.
Dean laughed, although it wasn’t funny, and said, “Sam needs to mind his own business.”
He held up a finger to shush her and motioned for her to stay put as he pulled a gun out of the back of his pants and held it in front of him. He crept down the hallway with the practiced silence of a trained hunter, holding the gun up around every corner only to be met with another empty corridor. Finally, he got to the last remaining entryway to the war room and paused, preparing himself for whatever might be waiting for him. Then he rounded the corner, and… there was Cas.
“You stupid son of a bitch,” he gritted out. A lump was quickly forming in his throat, and he tried to swallow around it as he hung his head and sniffled. He looked up again and blinked quickly against the hot tears stinging his eyes. Then, only because there was no one around to hear it but this stupid empty room, he said, “Me too, Cas.”
“Oh, come on, you missed us,” Dean replied.
After a moment of silence and the sound of crashing waves, Cas said, “Wow.”
It drove him more than a little crazy on the remainder of their drive.
“Always am!” Dean replied.
“Which is why you slapped me, got it,” Dean grimaced. “You’re a great friend.”
drinking to forget tonight,” Donnie hummed. “Good to know.”
“Come on,” he said, “I didn’t drive 1,600 miles just to stand here and gawk at it.”
“My name is Dean Winchester. Sam is my brother. Mary Winchester is my mom. And Cast..” His voice trailed off, and Cas’s heart stopped for the briefest moments. Then, with his voice a little shakier than before, Dean continued, “Cas is my best friend.”
“Don’t know that either,” Dean said. Then he paused and added, “Hey, what do you say about waffles? Meet me at Waldo’s.”
When Dean reached out to accept one of the hot drinks from him, he said, “Cas, I could kiss you right now.”
“Any of those look familiar?” he asked, not feeling hopeful even as the words left his mouth.
Dean wasn’t really sure how to respond to that without acknowledging the pang in his chest. Cas noticed, because of course he did, and his hand found Dean’s leg under the table with a gentle squeeze.
Dean’s brain shut down for approximately one second before he finally got with the program and gripped Cas’s hips to pull him closer as he kissed him back. Cas’s hands came to rest on either side of his face, and Dean exhaled as he practically collapsed against the warm lips on his own. It was somehow both desperate and tender at the same time, like the first breath after being underwater for too long punching through his lungs as it brought him back to life. After what was probably only a few seconds, Cas pulled away just enough to look at him as Dean tried to catch his breath.
Something flashed in his mind, a vision of sorts. Nothing he could place or hold onto, but there was a brick wall and then darkness splitting it open. It was like the scene was playing out on the edge of Dean’s mind, just out of his reach. If he really focused though, he could start to see the details of another person there when he turned around. Another person who looked like…
“What’s not fine?!” Dean asked, his arms splayed wide at his sides. “God’s dead. We won, Sammy!”
“Hey, we don’t have to talk,” Donnie said. “I’m just pointing out the obvious.”
“Hey, I’m alive aren’t I?” Dean asked. “Besides, I could still kick your ass, hungover or not.”
“Alright,” Cas said, slamming the Impala’s trunk, “follow me.”
“Hello?”
Cas pressed in, leaning over Dean’s shoulder to get a closer look. He said, “That’s the man from the picture in Barry Gilman’s office.”
“Haven’t decided yet,” he replied.
Dean’s face flushed bright red, and Sam was frankly growing concerned for him.
“You know she won’t,” Dean said. “She’s stubborn as shit.”
Sam ran Cas through the events of the morning, with exactly zero help from Dean. He’d stopped interjecting to try and defend himself at least. Instead, he was doing something even weirder though. He kept
Dean rolled his eyes, which made Cas laugh as he sat back against Dean’s thighs.
“Sister, this is not the hill you want to die on, trust me,” he told her.
“Here,” he handed one gun to Dean, who held it up by the handle with two fingers.
He was so fucking grateful for the chance to figure it out.
He chose not to acknowledge Sam’s answering sigh.
He shot her an unimpressed look in answer, and she said, “You’re no fun.”
“Maybe we could handle it with a little more tact than that,” Sam replied.
“Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint,” he said.
“Hello, Claire,” he said.
“Hang tight, and we’ll take you home,” he told her instead.
She watched him closely as he walked around the table and settled into Sam’s chair. He could practically feel some of the ice melting off of her glare before she said, “Dean, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…”
“You should consider it,” Cas replied as he reached for his salad dressing. “Sam says your diet is, and I quote, ‘a heart attack waiting to happen.’”
Cas’s heart dropped into his stomach, and he had to remind himself to not show just how terrified he was as he said, “That’s your name. Dean Winchester.”
The question caught him off guard, and Dean let himself consider it for a moment. He’d spent months having nightmares after the Leviathan sent Cas into that lake, and leaving Purgatory had Dean straight up hallucinating him more than once. Somehow, the hole in his chest this time was different though. He didn’t really have to guess to know why.
One of his hands cupped Cas’s jaw gently, turning his head so that he had no choice to look at Dean as he continued, “You changed me too, you know. You gave me something to believe in. You were an ally, and then the best damn friend I’ve ever had, and without you, we wouldn’t have stood a chance against the end of the world.”
“I wouldn’t call dying ‘leaving,” she argued.
He didn’t wait for an answer before bolting out the door, keys in hand, and Dean began to laugh as soon as the door shut behind him. Cas looked at him, feeling his own amusement at the whole situation catching up to him, and Dean grinned as he turned back to him.
Dean made eye contact with Charlie over the girl’s shoulder, and she nodded. In a quick move, he released the werewolf and lunged for the girl. She screamed as he tackled her to the floor, and he did his best to shield her vision as gunshots rang out through the air. The accompanying thud told him everything he needed to know about Charlie’s aim, and he let out a heavy exhale as the girl stopped fighting against him and started sobbing instead.
They were about an hour out of town when she sent him an address to a local diner. He smiled to himself and pulled up the GPS on his phone to set them on the right path.
The plan ended up being pretty close to Dean’s idea in the end. The werewolf and the girl were hiding out in a cabin outside of town. So, Sam and Stevie were going to be the decoy, bursting in through the front door guns blazing, and then Dean and Charlie were going to come in the back once the couple was on the defense. Sam would grab the girl and get her outside while they finished the job. It was simple enough.
“Oh, uh, I don’t think so,” Dean started.
,” Dean grumbled against the weight of the wolf thrashing against him. “He’s a monster.”
The others were taking it hard too to be fair, especially Sam. At least Sam had Eileen to distract him though. He suspected Claire wasn’t really the picture of emotional health either, but she wasn’t talking about much of anything, and honestly, he could relate. In every way that mattered, Dean was still in the dungeon, sitting on the floor with his head in his hands.
“He wouldn’t want this, you know,” she replied finally. It came out quickly like she’d been holding it back for awhile, and he had to really fight the cruel response that sprung to life in his throat.
“Me too,” he replied.
He nodded to himself once and exhaled as he left the room and turned out the lights.
She whispered, “I thought Sam and Eileen weren’t coming back until tomorrow.”
“Good,” he said over his shoulder.
“We’re okay, Dean,” he said. “Really.”
When they got back to the motel, Dean was acting like nothing had happened at all.
was stronger.
He maneuvered Dean’s fingers until they were holding the gun with at least what would pass for proper form, and Dean grinned up at him and gave him a thumbs up.
While she didn’t seem any more excited to see them than she had earlier that day, she at least wasn’t throwing punches, which seemed like a good start. Sam did his best with the FBI routine, with Dean sabotaging him at every turn, until she finally stopped and spun around to face them with an exasperated look.
In a small and strangled voice, he managed to say, “Cas?”
Dean skidded to a stop in the doorway of what appeared to be a foyer, and Cas drew his gun as he rushed to reach his side. It was immediately evident what had caught his attention. Rowena was pinned up against the stairs, a glass shard embedded inches from her head, presumably by the blonde woman standing directly in front of them. Rowena gasped as she caught sight of them, and the woman turned to follow her stare.
“What about this do I not seem okay with?” he asked breathlessly, making his point with a roll of his hips.
She rolled her eyes and said, “Jody’s fine. It’s not like I’m out getting myself killed on a hunt or something.”
Dean, to his growing suspicion, seemed to have no idea what he had done to end up with this outcome. Sam had seen Dean at about just every point on the hungover spectrum throughout their lives, but this one was setting new records.
,” Cas had told him once, back when he was engaged in a heavenly civil war. Back when he was secretly working against the Winchesters in a way that would eventually lead to him walking into that pond and not walking out. Dean thought about all those years of him wanting Cas to stay but feeling like he had no right to ask that of him. All those years of Cas apparently wanting to stay but feeling like Dean didn’t want him to.
Dean glanced over at Sam and then nodded as he looked back to the road.
Cas nodded and watched Dean empty the bullets from the gun he’d used and lock the safety back into place.
“You didn’t tell me we had company,” Dean hissed in Sam’s general direction, like he thought maybe Cas might not be able to hear him.
Stevie shook her head and explained, “No, like, a
It’s not like this was a new thing. He hadn’t exactly been subtle with his attraction to the tall, dark haired bartender, and Donnie hadn’t been subtle either, but it had always kind of been like that. They drank and sometimes they flirted and at the end of the night, that was it.
“No,” he said truthfully. “It’s never been like this.”
“Yes, Sam,” he said, “just let me know that he’s alright once you get there?”
Dean nodded.
“Hey Cas, you recognize that guy?” he asked.
Sam had the decency to look down at his salad instead of at Dean when he replied, “Nothing. I’m just saying that if you ever wanna talk, about anything at all, you can.”
Cas didn’t quite know what to say in the face of Dean’s sincerity, so he simply replied, “Thank you, Dean.”
Radio stations faded in and out as they drove, and Dean absentmindedly tapped one hand on the steering wheel along with them. The other was stretched across the console, wrapped up in Cas’s. He’d imagined this exact scenario before, although it had always been a farfetched hope. Now that he had it, the reality was equally everything he expected and also a little overwhelming. Mostly, as the miles stretched out in front of them, Dean was thinking about what it all meant.
Then, comically, Dean leaned in like they were in a buddy comedy and said, “Please tell me I’ve tapped that at least once.”
Cas said, “No, I’ll get back to the research while the two of you get some breakfast.”
Sam paused and went back, slowing down the footage. They watched as Dean walked out the door, and then a man stepped out of the shadows around the corner of the building. Sam paused.
“Your hair is so bouncy!”
They settled in early after dinner. There wasn’t much to do in bumfuck Wyoming, and it was probably better for them to get some rest and get an early start to the day tomorrow anyways. So Dean was already in his pajamas and propped up against the headboard flipping through the channels on a television straight from 1998 when Cas stepped out of the shower, hair still dripping wet even as he dabbed at it with an off white hotel towel. Dean paused his idle channel surfing as a news report caught his attention.
