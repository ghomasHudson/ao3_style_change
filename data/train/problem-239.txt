“Harry…” John said.
Daddy’s hands pour the soap over me and move through my hair
Then he was done. He threw the spoon into the sink, jammed the peanut butter back in the fridge, and moaned. He pulled at his hair, sinking onto the sofa.
He shakes his head, burrowing back into Daddy’s warmth. He doesn’t want to ruin it. “Wuv’oo, Daddy,” he says in a tiny voice.
“You.”
him. He’d thought, with the gentleness John had exuded, that he could—
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was weary with sleep.
this is just what I need
When he was young, his father had been so scary. Standing on the stage in bright lights, listening to some people from London’s government speak (he didn’t know or care who they were) before accepting his award from Scotland Yard, Sherlock wondered if people watching from the audience, or from their televisions at home, could tell this about his past. That he was a broken man. Broken from the start, with nowhere to go.
“You’re up?” he asked.
” Sherlock screams, the praise and the punishing thrusts overwhelming him, and he’s coming, coming in Daddy’s lap, in his hand, while Daddy holds him tight and fucks him through his orgasm.
He went home and stood in the darkened living room. It was warm here. He could just make out the outline of his and John’s chairs from the yellow streetlights below. Quiet whooshes denoted cars passing. But there were no voices, no screeches of tires. Of the cars, only quiet whirring remained. It was womblike.
“Daddy stay?” Sherlock asks, and Daddy’s heart melts. How could he ever leave?
He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes.
The next steps were easy. Sherlock stood up. He took controlled steps towards his coat. Swung it over his shoulders. Remembered to collect himself. Yes, he had his wallet and keys.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied.
“Ready?” Daddy asks. Sherlock nods into Daddy’s shoulder. Daddy puts two big strong hands on Sherlock’s hips and presses him down, and Sherlock sinks down onto Daddy’s hard unyielding cock—oh—oh—
The words stuck in his throat. The tears were still leaking from his closed eyes. He couldn’t speak. His body felt as if were tied down. It hurt to move his body. He shrugged. He was paralyzed.
legs. “I—woke up, an—an—an—I felt weird, an’ Daddy wasn’t there, an’ Daddy is
Sherlock face seemed to screw up of its own accord. “I—I was pretending. I’m good at that.” He wanted to burrow under the covers. He wanted to hide away forever, and the tears wouldn’t stop. They tore from his body. He wasn’t strong enough for this kind of grief.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade called after him, holding up his phone, “you were right! It was Mrs Talbot!”
Something dark in me rears its head and I tell it to back down.
John must have seen his tenseness. “It’s alright,” he murmured to Sherlock. “C’mere. Come to bed.”
Sherlock let out a breath in surprise. In that case, John’s insistence that he sat at the table seemed overly emphatic. He waited as John slid over a mouthwatering plate heaped with two pieces of toast, scrambled eggs, sausages, and strawberries.
Lestrade, he knew, without opening his eyes.
So he was alive. What now? It was not enough to just live. Because simply living was a waste. He may as well be dead.
“Sunshine… it probably was just a misunderstanding, yeah?” Lestrade still has his phone out.
“Sherlock, we’ve got it,” Lestrade chuckles down the line. He sounds unjustifiably arrogant. I can almost smell the coffee and donuts. “And it’s only been a week.”
Daddy takes out my boats to and they float around in the water, which sounds like a waterfall as it fills the tub. Daddy tests the temperature of the water with his hand then he helps me in and it’s soft and lovely
John’s grip on his arm tightened for a painful moment, and then he let go, sitting back. “You’re a dickhead,” he said through clenched teeth. “I’m crying because I’m
Sherlock closed his eyes again as Lestrade stepped aside with his phone out, this time to call the Chinese place he liked, and not John. The truth was that the entire time John was gone, Sherlock missed him. He missed him so much, and he knew he didn’t deserve to see him again, not after being violent with him.
Daddy makes sure he doesn’t leave his baby hanging. “What is it, love?” he asks, softly, turning from the pan.
“I’m in here ‘cause they think I’m anorexic, don’t they?”
“I don’t want to talk about it, John.”
“Yeah, Harry.”
“You’ve got work tomorrow, Harry, and you’re about to be fired as it is.”
Lestrade was silent. Then he said, “Can I hold your hand, Sunshine?”
I change back into my pajamas, so it looks like I stayed home all day, and pad to the kitchen. I make toast and soft-boiled eggs, which I know I will be able to manage. I put a butter dish out, for John’s use, not mine.
Guilt.
I wish I weren’t such an awkward person!
My head is spinning. My long sleeves are sticking to my skin. My stomach is empty, my muscles are cramping.
John nodded. He left. Sherlock watched him go.
He turned slowly. John was standing in the darkened hall by the doorway. He felt vacant, light, high. He wondered what he looked like.
And yet—he was panicking, taking short, quick breaths, and yet helpless, so he lay there uselessly staring at his arm.
What if John—what if John—he is so scared, he muffles his sobs in his hand—what if John doesn’t want him anymore?
What scared him was that this was obviously not the first time Sherlock had hurt himself. Last night he had seen so many scars—old scars, new scars—he was a bloody doctor; he knew the way scars worked. Rows upon rows of scars.
“I made dinner,” I say. John knows what my cooking means and that makes me uncomfortable, so I quip, “Like your housewife, especially since Lestrade won’t have me on any cases.”
he texted Sherlock.
The guilt made his stomach churn. Egg drop soup. Lestrade was better, safer than John. He wouldn’t hurt him, because he didn’t care enough about him. Lestrade was safe. Greying and weary and familiar. Egg drop soup.
“Uh… pancakes?” Sherlock asks hopefully.
Then Sherlock sighed. “Mycroft wants me to attend Mummy’s birthday next week.”
Daddy pours water over my head
He could hear his breathing.
Ella leaned back, gave him time.
Just as I think this, John reaches out and touches my hand.
“Why have you moved my microscope?” Sherlock asked without moving from the kitchen’s perimeter. He flipped through the monograph. “I have an experiment waiting.”
“No, I suppose not,” Ella said. “Tell me how long it’s been since you’ve found out and what you’ve been doing so far.”
“I don’t care how smart you were when you were sixteen, Sunshine. You were a kid,” Lestrade said fiercely.
“Daddy,” Sherlock whimpers again, “scared.”
“Pancakes it is,” Daddy says happily. Pancakes are more work but he doesn’t ever want his baby to think he doesn’t deserve them. Big Sherlock has enough problems with food as it is, and Little Sherlock seems to have fewer. Daddy would like to keep it that way.
I wake up hazily. I know almost immediately deep in my body that it is afternoon and John is at work. Before leaving, he had woken me up and kissed me goodbye.
Sherlock starts eating. Daddy sits across from him, carefully watching him and eating his own pancakes. Sherlock feels better—safe—when Daddy watches him. He knows Daddy would never let anything bad happen to him. He puts a big bite of pancake in his mouth and smiles at Daddy.
There was no meaning, no reason in anything, except for the meaning one assigned. He couldn’t think of any meaning. Nothing. A void.
They sat there in a kind of tense, detached impasse for what felt like hours until Sherlock wore himself out and his breathing slowed. He was exhausted and numb. A few more tears slipped out.
After, Sherlock is limp and Daddy slows down, but still fucks him good. Daddy peppers little kisses all over Sherlock’s face, murmuring, “I love watching you come, so good for me, so hot, baby boy,” and then Daddy’s grunting and coming inside Sherlock, and then it’s all over and suddenly there are tears all over Sherlock’s face.
John frowned. “Even so, I’d feel better if they were.”
“You gotta make these hard decisions if you want to keep going, Sunshine, yeah? If you want to keep John in your life?”
Sherlock was always so—well, he was Sherlock, wasn’t he? He jumped over rooftops, took down armed serial killers, survived falls. It was difficult to think of his friend as so… fragile.
Sherlock flinched. “I—can’t. I just can’t anymore.” The dread was like sweet treacle in his bones. “I’ve been doing the hard thing for a long time! Okay? I don’t care. Do what you want. I—I’m just done! I don’t want to keep going!”
“What did you deserve?”
John has three careful fingers thrusting deep in Sherlock who is kneeling over his lap, clutching him, his flushed sweaty face buried in John’s neck. “Good boy,” John whispers into Sherlock’s ear, and his boy whimpers, shivers running down his spine, goose bumps rising up on his back under John’s hand.
He picks up on the fifth ring, meaning that he doesn’t feel so undefeated yet that he feels compelled to answer me. “Yes?” he says distractedly.
I come across people like her and like my father in my Work. We are all just variations on a theme. Not unique or original. There’s nothing new under the sun. Nothing at all.
father
It wasn’t just the meal skipping John was worried about. It was the number of calories Sherlock managed in general. Lately, it had been too few, and Sherlock, already slim, had lost a bit too much weight.
It smells like huckleberries and honey…
Sherlock glared at his blankets.
“I’m afraid I have to go,” I say. “You’re right. I wasn’t meaning to be out here. Will you be safe tonight?”
“It’s because my sweet boy was sad, hm?”
Sherlock whimpers, quietly, then reins himself in. Daddy sighs. His boy feels too much guilt for his innocence. He doesn’t know how to be okay. Doesn’t know how to cry out loud. Daddy knows sometimes the guilt washes over his boy, threatens to drown him, and in those times it is up to Daddy to help his sweetest boy. “Daddy forgives you, baby,” he whispers. “For your arms. For everything. Daddy’s not going anywhere.”
John walked and walked and walked. All the fury had left him the moment Sherlock, like a goddamned child, had asked where John was going. He sank. He walked and walked slowly. He was… tired, and he had to get out of Baker Street. His sleeve chafed and scratched at and irritated the wound he—or rather, Sherlock—had made. He tried not to swing his arm so much, held it in his pocket. He was sad and empty and—had that been domestic violence? Had it been—malevolent?
Johnny. I can’t bring anyone home when you’re always here. And I can tell you don’t want to be here. I see you checking your phone every minute or so to see if he or Mrs Hudson has texted you. I know you’d rather be needed there than here, Johnny.”
Wild? Untamed? Dark? He wondered if they saw his affinity to the criminals he chased, and enjoyed fighting.
In the end I can’t resist any of it. I buy a 6-pack of jelly donuts, 2 slices of New York cheesecake, and a liter of low calorie, sugar free vanilla ice cream. I carry it out in a plastic bag and head to the docks to eat. I sit, staring out at the water.
There was silence. Damn, Harry had probably passed out again. Well, she’d technically agreed. And thank god. He was starting to think…. He stopped himself. He was family. Of course she'd agreed.
I need someone to take the pills out of my hand.
“I wish you’d tell me more about what’s bothering you, sweetheart,” John says. His chest rumbles when he speaks.
He felt vacant, base, feral, animal, terrified, triumphant, and exhausted. He had logicked himself out of immediate danger of suicide and survived. It was what he did. Why? Why did he survive and keep this horrendous, empty cycle going? Why couldn’t he just let himself die?
“Yeah, hi,” he said. “Erm… I’m sorry to have disappeared like that. I probably should have told you I was okay and I wasn’t coming back for more sessions.”
He told himself to get over himself. He bought himself takeaway from a tiny hole-in-the-wall Chinese that he had never set foot in before. He ate in one of his boltholes.
Sherlock wakes up around one in the afternoon. He had went to bed late, staying up to work on an experiment, so he wakes up late.
you want?” Lestrade asked. He had his honest policeman’s face on.
Sherlock shook his head slowly against John’s chest. No, he could not say. He did not know, not at this moment. “Thirsty,” he whispered. “John.”
It was rational to kill himself. There was no hope. Though the chances that Lestrade would take him back were very high, the chance that he would ever maintain a connection or be close to someone was nil. That was the true source of his pain, the precise stab in his back. He would never have a friend, or an acquaintance, or anyone that would stick up for him. He should have known better than to try.
He hadn't been eating.
Now he was no longer bed ridden, had blocked everything out. He was a great detective. He had a great mind. He was taking care of himself. He had showered and brushed his teeth. No one would tell from looking at him that he had once had no place to live, that once upon a time, he had been the scum of the earth, hated since his birth.
He was so tired. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage, he remembered.
“Shh, shh, I’ve got you, baby boy,” Daddy says, “I’m right here. Bum up a bit, okay little love?”
“Lestrade,” Sherlock said, striding past a sputtering Donovan, “it was the neighbor’s wife.”
“John told me everything,” Lestrade said.
“All right, then one, two, three—” to my delight I am lifted entirely up off the couch and he carries me to the bathroom.
He was his own company. When he spoke, no one listened except himself.
I close my eyes a bit. I let the hard metal bench of the bus stop press into my bum. I’m slumped against the plastic wall, in disguise as a homeless person outside Matilda’s house. The bus stop is filthy and smells of piss. If I were more in control of my mind, I would be fascinated by the filth. So much can be gleaned from the particular subsets of bacteria in different locations.
The Thames splashes against the docks rhythmically and I look at the reflection of the stars in the water. It’s cold—October—and the ice cream chills me from the inside. I shiver.
Shaking his head, Sherlock pushes away from John and holds his arm out, the one where he hurt himself. “S-s-s-s-sorry. Sorry, sorry.”
But there had been nothing. Sherlock seemed to be doing fine, better even, without him. He wondered if this was his life now. A bland boring flat, a boring job, and a weary, alcoholic sister. He realized, even if he wasn’t there, Sherlock’s life went on, and because of that, so did everyone else’s: Lestrade’s, Mrs Hudson’s, Sally’s, even Anderson’s. He hadn’t updated his blog in more than a month, but Sherlock was becoming stronger than ever. John wasn’t needed. And there was nothing in his life for him to write about for his blog now that he didn’t have Sherlock.
“I—” Sherlock started, calming minutely. “I don’t have a choice do I? I’ll have to speak. Unless they don’t want me anymore.”
“You gonna come, sweet boy?”
“It looks nice,” he says.
I stop at seven miles, gripping the handles of the treadmill and holding myself steady. I so want to collapse. I want to succumb to the pure unhappiness I feel in me. I want to go limp in the face of life. It’s too much. But 7 miles is my achievement for today. It’s something to do.
“Did you eat?”
“Wassup, Mister Holmes?” she asks tiredly. She eyes me as if she can tell there’s something wrong with me.
I move to the mirror and look at the thin man in it. I turn, checking the way my hipbones jut out. The joint where my femur attaches to my hipbone rolls visibly when I walk. My collarbones and ribs are visible too. I look like a ghost. A ghost with hollow eyes and scars that climb up my body like ladders.
John wilted back onto the table. “God,” he said. “He must not be eating.”
I consider the gym. It smells of sweat and disinfectant. I go to my locker and change again into workout gear.
he stared at John, bewildered.
Short update. More to come… I pretty much know how this story ends, but real life has been crazy! Thanks for reading!
Sherlock stared at John’s back, heart pounding. “You go to Lestrade—I can’t handle cases anymore—who said that John? Did I say that?”
He closed his eyes... he let them take him away....
Then more noise. More. Stop it.
John wasn’t surprised at this admission. Frankly he was astounded that Sherlock could physically sustain any of his work. “What’s stopping you from eating, sweetheart?”
“I’m not
And, as the tears start to dry, John gathers Sherlock’s wounded heart in his hands. He kisses his forehead, eyes pained. He holds him tight, and that’s all Sherlock ever needed.
(See the end of the chapter for
And the Mail and the Sun had published stories that showed him as a brooding, angry, dark, seductive man jilted at love’s alter.
He was alone.
him and Daddy’s here, Daddy’s here.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d had London’s streets memorized since he was fifteen, but he had no idea where he was going.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said. To his credit, he didn’t deny that there was anything to notice.
Daddy smiles at Sherlock, too. He reaches over and wipes some honey from Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock wriggles in his chair, feeling small and safe.
Wiggins is quiet for a while. “Why are you nice to us? When you have your John at home, why are you out here with me?”
“Baby boy, it’s alright, all’s forgiven, Daddy loves you,” John says quietly, calmly.
He’d make breakfast and check Sherlock’s bandages. Maybe they’d go to the park, where they’d have a talk. He wanted to hold Sherlock’s hand and protect him and care for him. He wanted to make sure whatever it was that was hurting him went away. He wanted to keep Sherlock safe.
His dad had died of cancer. John had been his dad’s only family to watch him die; John was the giving one in his family. When Harry had come out as a lesbian, his dad had come out as homophobic. Battle lines were drawn. John’s mother became more and more worn and wrinkled and creased each year she sided with Harry and endured her husband’s siege.
But the truth is, there is something dark in me that snaps if care is given at the wrong time. It’s the darkness my parents saw in me as a child that invited their abuse.
Sherlock took three deep breaths. “No,” he whispered, very quietly and very selfishly, but it was okay now.
“Baby,” Daddy says. He fastens his hand around Sherlock’s. “I promise to always be in the flat when you wake up, hm?”
, Sherlock!”
“Daddy!” Sherlock cries, the bouncing making his voice bounce too. “Oh—oh---oh—Daa—addy!”
But Sherlock turned away. “Can’t.”
“Please what, sweetheart?” John asked, holding him tight.
John smiled. “What’s she like? I know a bit about your dad—” Sherlock shuddered—“but you never mentioned your mum, so I assumed…”
tired. “Bee has a broken wing,” he says. “Band-Aid?”
Sherlock smirked and walked back to Lestrade. “Forensics confirmed?”
I feel sick, but I keep going. I feel my stomach start bulging out and after a week of near fasting, I want to cry. I don’t want more of this. I don’t know how to stop.
Blood was good because it was proof of his punishment, proof that he was reigning himself in, controlling the chaos. The more things he did, the more he needed to be punished. He ought to be useless. He ought to be the filthy drug addict who’d lain, dazed and high and senseless in the streets. He ought to be left behind.
Sherlock puts his thumb in his mouth. Not to suck. He just likes it there. Comforting. When Daddy is here, he cries a lot. But it feels good, like his hurting heart can let go. Daddy says he’s glad Sherlock cries. Because sometimes little boys need to cry to feel better. “Let it all out. Daddy’s got you.”
It was his coping mechanism. It was not just that, but also proof of his control, proof that he was
I haven’t seen her in almost 10 years. The last time I saw her was when I was in rehab the first time, before the Work. I remember how we parted ways. Back then my father was still alive, and he and my mother came to see me. She always had a way about her that seemed to me like her soul whispered, rather than spoke. She stared at me softly, helplessly, pityingly.
“Good boy, good boy,” Daddy soothes roughly, his thick huge cock pistoning into him, “it’s all right, my sweet boy, Daddy’s here, Daddy loves you and your filthy little hole and he loves watching your pretty little cock bounce up and down and he loves filling you up, and you take it so well sweetheart, I’m so proud of you, I love you.”
Sherlock didn’t even try to hide his fresh wounds. He was leaving tomorrow, anyway. John took them in so calmly. Still, Sherlock’s shoulders tensed. He was always in trouble.
“No, you can’t, Lestrade,” Sherlock gasped. Tears were leaking from his eyes again. “You can’t, it’ll—”
“I wasn’t upset.”
welp, is anyone reading this? lol. if you were, sorry that this is more me rambling to myself than really writing a story.
“Sherlock!” John cried again. He was fighting back, trying to push his arms away from each other, trying to stamp on Sherlock’s feet, to smash his head back against Sherlock’s jaw, but Sherlock was standing behind him, his entire body bearing down on him—
His phone buzzed. He half expected it to be Sherlock with an apology or a plead for him to come home….
“Do you have it? Is it gripped between your fingers?” Sherlock grabbed John’s left hand and his right wrist. “Come on! It’s easy! All you have to do is—”
John stood there over the man in his white coat like a helpless angel. He was by no means pure; he had seen too much, done too much. But he could not understand. He could not understand the depths of hell that existed in some people, so he could not give them compassion.
, people think you’re my
She shakes her head and so I get up and throw it into the bin next to us.
John doesn’t know that I’ve always had a gym membership. I think he thinks I’m somehow magically thin. And before I was thin, he thought I was magically fit.
“Aside from the fact that you randomly came over one day, saying I’d agreed to you living here a couple days, and I can’t remember agreeing?” Harry said. “It’s been
Lestrade didn’t say anything.
John sometimes makes food that I cannot bare to eat. Right now, I cannot stomach salmon, like he made last night. I think I might choke on it. I want only gentle food. Something like sweet pancakes, or bananas in milk. Boxed macaroni cheese. And I can only stomach food once a day.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “This was easier when I lived alone.”
Sherlock thought, but… the words didn’t seem to reach his mouth.
They stay that way, sitting as close as possible together, Daddy feeding his baby bite by bite. Sherlock likes eating more when Daddy feeds him than when he feeds himself. Food is so overwhelming, but Daddy knows exactly how small his bites need to be…. Soon, Sherlock has eaten two pancakes and is feeling droopy. He nuzzles sleepily into Daddy’s arm.
John stirred. The bedroom had gone dark with night. Streetlamps glowed softly through the curtains.
Tears sprung unbidden, unmeditated into Sherlock’s eyes. “But—that’s—”
Sherlock blushes, buries his head in John’s shoulder. “Nooo.”
“I won’t. Sherlock. I won’t. Okay? I’m here for you.”
Sherlock. He’ll watch over him. He wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
A bit of time spent in Sherlock's mind.
He had not cut in two and a half weeks. He had been too depressed to do so. He rolled his sleeve up. The scabs on his right forearm had healed and left angry red scars trailing across tired skin. He could not eat. He needed to be hurt. He could not bear it when his wounds had healed.
about Sherlock and where he was regarding his mental health at the moment? To—essentially—take away Sherlock’s ability to advocate for himself by conspiring with Greg?
“No, why would he?” Lestrade, damn him, sounds genuinely confused. Then he sounds downright chummy: “How is Mycroft by the way?”
“You have been ungrateful your whole life.” My father clenched his jaw. I was too old to hit by then. His fingers were swollen with disease and I could see them balling into fists.
Tears well up in Sherlock’s eyes. But he still feels warm and safe. And Daddy is being gentle with his arm. His voice is like fleece.
“I’ve slept enough,” Sherlock said. “…And.” He hesitated. “I can’t eat that.”
John isn’t there either.
He wants to hurt himself. Everyone always leaves him, hurts him. The impulse jolts through him ickily. He buries his face in his hands, in his shame. He settles with crying—silently, the way father taught him. He doesn’t feel very brave right now.
“Please just let me take care of your wounds,” John said evenly, so evenly Sherlock felt his heart wrench. He felt his body begin to relax. Finally, finally he had began to accept and feel relieved that John wasn’t going to—to—
“Okay, Daddy.”
he felt after his fight with Sherlock. He suddenly believed that this dullness was the worst sort of pain because it was eating away at him. It made him feel sluggish, helpless.
“Johnny, I fucking hate you.”
Then again, nothing about me is
He had more pills. Of course he did. He was Sherlock Holmes.
“You need me,” Sherlock reminded the older man.
you know it was Mrs Talbot?”
The girl climbs in and I see Sylvan Rabbit’s silhouette. He’s smoking a cigarette. He grabs the girl’s arm roughly. I try not to leap out from my hiding spot.
“Maybe something light first,” Lestrade said. And Sherlock’s heart felt so… indescribable. “Maybe some of that soup you like? The egg drop soup from that Chinese place?”
Might as well die, might as well live. None of it meant anything. Sherlock chose to live out of laziness and cowardice. He fell back onto the meaning that institutions dictated. Being rich meant success, so he would strive to be rich. Being traditionally educated meant privilege, so he might go back for another degree. He would achieve based on what he was told was valuable. He would become famous, save children, drive a fast car, win prizes. Those were his goals now, how he measured himself.
Who is this other girl? She lands softly on the ground then trudges up the slight hill that the house sits in. I see something wild in her eyes. Feral.
It is now 4:30 and I decide to head home before John can tell I’ve left the flat. I hail a cab and while I’m in it, I think of what to eat.
He stood there a moment longer, then walked away.
Consciousness forced itself over his body, dragged his mind to the present. He could not escape. He kept his eyes closed anyway. He didn’t care where he was. Not when he felt so guilty. He thought if he didn’t know where he was, he wouldn’t exist.
John half laughed, half looked like he was realizing something, deciding something. “You’d do that?”
John is perfect like this, chipping away at him bit by bit. What if—what if—
at the feeling of Daddy’s big lubed up cock nudging between his legs, at his little hole.
It was Harry. He stared at the screen, her name, Harry Watson, burning into his eyes. Could he do it? Could he do it one more time? Could he really do anything? He couldn’t for Sherlock. He’d lost Sherlock.
“Any reason why Mycroft might be taking you off cases?” Lestrade says; as always, he is sharp when it is inconvenient for me.
His coat was baggy…. He swayed again, not noticing Lestrade’s hand reaching out again….
“Well, it’s my… it’s not for me. It’s for Sherlock—he’d never go to therapy, so… here I am, instead of him. You remember him, right? My flatmate?”
I step on the scale I keep hidden from him and note my weight in my log. Down marginally from yesterday. I know I am underweight according to the BMI. I’ve been here before. The problem is that when I get here, I start having strange thoughts. Thoughts that say that I’m not underweight at all, and that normal people are simply all obese. I start looking at Molly, John, Lestrade, who are all at normal weights, and feel that they are huge. All the extra flesh that clings to their limbs is unnecessary, frivolous.
Deciding where he would cut next was almost as calming as the cutting itself. His hands felt weak, his wrists achy. Squeezing them did not help. His hand flopped about weakly for a razor blade. Once he grasped his blades, the sensation went away. His hands were always steady when he cut.
Daddy gives me a bottle of cool sweet milk
A warm, rough hand took his own gently. “Hey, sunshine, we don’t want to do that, yeah?” A care-worn voice.
“Yes, bub?”
“He told me about the self-harm, Sherlock. I wish you’d… I wish you’d asked me for help. Or anyone.”
Then, a figure darts past me. “Wiggins?” I whisper.
Wiggins nods and I leave, calculating the calories I’ve eaten versus the calories I didn’t eat this week, versus the calories from the 14 miles I ran. I feel like crying.
When Sherlock has cried himself out, Daddy kisses his hair. Daddy thinks it is time for some gentle reminders.
Baby frowns. “How Daddy?”
Oh, shut up. They were all too loud. Too much applause. Too much noise.
He couldn’t move. Dread filled him. It was like the tears had grabbed hold of his lungs and heart and brain and were shaking him, holding him hostage.
The jelly donuts start disappearing. I take huge bites, chasing the sweet jam inside. I combine it with the ice cream, then with the cheesecake.
He realized now, shaking his arm to unstick his sleeve from his wound, he’d never been hurt before. People around him got hurt and he watched them and cared for them. He was whatever they needed.
“Hey, Sunshine, I’m sure he’ll want to know. Okay? I’ll call him now.”
“It doesn’t feel good?” John prodded.
John was so gentle. Sherlock wrapped his arms around himself and shook. He didn’t know what to do with gentle people. He was sure he’d damage them, the way he’d damaged Mummy—that was why she’d been so mean to him….
He didn’t need John. But… he did need recognition to do his work, to stay motivated, to keep from disappearing, so he had agreed to a short print interview in the Guardian.
Matilda must have been peering out the window at the dead of night. I know what it’s like to stand on tip toes staring out a window checking to see if the ghost of a parent has gone for good. Hoping for and fearing their return. So I know how discomfited Matilda must be.
John places little kisses on my cheeks, my eyes, and my nose. It makes me feel small. I drift further.
John pressed one last kiss into Sherlock’s hair and lingered there….
It felt like he was floating.
Simple as that, he began to cry. He didn’t know why, exactly, but try as he might, he couldn’t stop. He pressed his hand to his mouth desperately, muffling the sharp breaths.
“Wait, Lestrade,” Sherlock whispered, “don’t call John.”
“I’m not. I just forgot to eat.”
crying, Sherlock,” John said, but his eyebrows furrowed and his lips pressed together even harder. He took a sharp breath.
I'm feeling bad, really bad. When I was a kid, I'd stop talking sometimes. I feel like that now.
“You’re crying about everything, hm?” Daddy says soft and slow. His voice is sweet like melons. “Everything that’s ever made you sad…. My poor baby boy….”
“Go on then,” Daddy says, “Daddy’s watching, Daddy’s here.”
He was depressed. But he found, the longer he lay there, feeling out the darkness inside himself, that he was also hurt, and—
John wanted to ask if Sherlock’s father had beaten Sherlock’s mother, too. What Mycroft’s involvement was. The questions wanted to tumble off his tongue. But he bit his lip. Instead, he said, “It must have been weighing on you.”
He squared his shoulders and fled.
He takes little gasps of air, sobs silently. Please, please, please, he silently begs. He doesn’t know what to do. He’s really scared.
“Yes, so… why are you crying?”
Looking at it rationally, both he and John were at fault here. John for taking away his agency, and himself for assuming John would understand. He was at fault for not being able to make John understand. For not being able to explain himself.
I head to the bathroom where I use the toilet and brush my teeth. I strip out of my pajamas and feel the bite of the November air. A shock to the system is always good, although lately I have been feeling almost feverish, my muscles sore and weak. It is probably due to my eating habits lately—I know John is worried. I know I have lost weight. But I feel enormous. Sluggish in my body.
“I broke up w-with Mary. Sh'said I was a drunk.”
“John,” Ella said, smiling, “it’s good to see you.”
Ella was quiet. “I think you ought to ask him.”
He spent a good amount of time just staring at his wrist and at the blade, adjusting his grip on it. It wasn’t that he was hesitating or trying not to cut; he had never in his life picked up a razor without cutting. He hesitated before picking up a blade, not after: the act of picking up the blade was the deciding act. It was the point of no return, the steadying of his hands. So no, he was not hesitating. He knew what his next actions would be. There was only one thing left for him, and that calmed him. He stared at his wrist, letting his body breathe, feel. He always took his time when he cut. It was a luxury. Cutting was an intensely physical act and it would not be satisfying if he did not allow his transport the attention it deserved.
John frowned. If Sherlock still couldn’t put his experiences into words… He rubbed Sherlock’s back encouragingly. “So, are you going?”
Sherlock stared at the toast with contempt, then reached down. The toast felt spongey in his hands. His fingertips pressed into it. Before he knew it, he had ripped it to shreds.
Eventually it passed. Things always passed.
He was always about to disappear.
“Wait, Sherlock… just, look, I’d be stupid if I didn’t at least ask… are you clean?”
John shifts in his sleep. I don’t want to speak to him. The way John treats me is foreign. It is a little too odd to accept his little gestures here and there. I feel like I am in someone else’s life. It’s hard for me to feel close to him. Even though I love him.
“What are you sorry for?” he asked, short, controlled, and perfect. He folded his sleeves down.
Sherlock smiles, just a little bit.
John had his medical bag with him. “Can I?” he asked.
Sherlock shook his head. “I—I was really smart. I was horrifying. I was too smart.”
I almost smile. Beggars can be choosers after all. I take out a twenty-pound note and hand it to her. “Get yourself something you like, Wiggins,” I say.
“I can feel the food like congealed blood in my veins. Sloshing about. Just coagulating.”
“He said you were, uh… on edge?” Lestrade said, squinting at him, as if that might help him deduce Sherlock’s state of mind. “He didn’t say much, though.”
He didn't feel okay. He felt shaky and small, nothing. He had set out to find Lestrade, to reinstate himself, prove his sanity, but now he knew just where to stop off first: where it was always night. It would be easy to find where it had relocated. He always had a foot in the darkness, after all.
“She’s. Overbearing,” Sherlock began. “Um. You know, very… she wasn’t always like this. Early on, she was just as bad as he was.”
“Play?”
By the way, thank you for all the kudos, comments, subscriptions, and reviews! I was so surprised at the response and at how many people even clicked on this fic. It means a lot to me that something so personal to me would be enjoyed by others.
He’s in his t-shirt. His trails his fingertips up his arms, scars from his past. In a wave of anger, he scratches down his forearm, leaving a red trail. He does it again and again until he is bleeding. It staves off the tears and makes him forget about John’s absence until he realizes what he’s done.
John considered the thin man before him. “All right. But I want you to try to eat something for dinner. You’ve only had two pancakes today.”
It was a deathly thin, pale face, shadows under the eyes, mottled, crusty, greying skin stretched over protruding cheekbones, much like Sherlock’s. John frowned, letting his eyes drift lower to the patient’s bony arms. An IV was attached to the patient’s hand, creating a decent sized bruise. He could see, now, similar bruises at the crooks of the patient’s arms, red, pockmarked, ugly. He adjusted his coat again, hoping no one would notice him, and lifted the patient’s blanket.
John looked down at his love, who was looking very shy. “Of course, I’ll come!” he said. “I’ll hold your hand through the whole thing.”
Sherlock snorted. “Not if I can help it. But Mycroft will probably send some of his minions to take me away again.”
And so I believe I have more to lose.
He never bled too much, never cut too deep, but this time bloody tissues cluttered the bed. Blood was still welling up through the slits in his skin. He felt stupid because if he hadn’t wanted to feel like this, the answer was simply to not cut. But he needed it.
“A week until the murderer targets another girl,” I reply coolly.
No one bothered Sherlock as he swept through the New Scotland Yard offices. They were used to seeing him, and if they didn’t know who he was by now, his purposeful stride convinced them to leave him alone.
Sherlock launched into his deductions. “Really, Lestrade,” he finished, “the clues were all there, written down.”
I usually feel safe with him. I sigh into his neck. I don’t need to talk. John will take care of everything.
Lestrade looked helpless. “God help me,” he said. “I do.”
The way he reaches for his keys is precise; he barely has to fish in his pocket for them. John will sometimes stand outside our door for at least a few minutes swearing to himself before he can find his key. I hear their dog, Joey, bark. The door opens and Sylvan Rabbit goes inside, but not before carefully wiping his shoes on the doormat.
Lestrade had written,
Sherlock froze.
Sherlock closed his eyes. The world wanted too much from him. “Yes,” he said. “Please help me.”
He crawled out of bed. He wanted to disappear. He thought about running. It was what he did, after all. He discarded the idea. He was too tired. He was giving in. He thought about suicide. He thought about Mycroft.
“I’m sorry,” John mumbled, touching Sherlock’s hand. “I think I moved too fast.”
, not whatever bad things you think you deserved.”
“Daddy…” Sherlock yawns.
How fucked up is that?”
John makes sure to be extra gentle with Sherlock. He saw the way Sherlock flinched when he came in, knows the exact reason Sherlock won’t let himself cry out loud. “I love you,” he whispers to his sweet boy. “I’m proud of you.” He makes sure his arms are snug around his boy’s body, but also not tight enough that Sherlock would feel trapped. He doesn’t even clench his jaw at how Holmes Sr treated this sweet, sweet boy. He keeps his muscles relaxed, non-threatening. “You’re safe, Sherlock. Daddy’s not going anywhere.” He’ll never shout, he’ll never hurt Sherlock, never even act brusquely in front of his little boy.
“Okay, Daddy….” He ducks his head. Sniffles. “Sorry I was bad today.”
“Sher—”
It’s just a cut! Look at it!”
me, and the next morning he was Sherlock again, you know? Untouchable. He… he left and didn’t come back for the whole day after I tried to ask him questions. And then—” he cut himself off.
No, it takes work. A lot of work.
He sniffs. Maybe he is crying after all.
He was almost happy about it. He closed his eyes. Maybe this meant he could rest, stop everything. Stop this charade. Stop his life.
“Sher, if you really want to be good to him, we should tell him so he hears it from us, not from watching telly or something—”
Come on, I made your favorite,” John said, trying to smile and cajole the detective towards the table.
It’s not insurmountable. I’m not addicted. I don’t understand why it’s a bad thing. I heal. I don’t cut deep. I use clean blades. I rarely permanently scar. I’m healthy about it.”
“It’s not bad,” Sherlock said. “They don’t need to be bandaged.”
John cleaned dried blood from his arm. The cool dabs on his arm tickled. Sherlock didn’t pay any attention to what John was doing, though. He focused on his face, which looked pinched and weary. John’s lips were pressed together. His eyes looked red. Oh. John was crying.
Sometimes I think I do the Work to wear myself down to the bone, to be consumed. If I did not give it my all, I know I would go back to heroin. I find work that cuts at me, bit by bit, until I’m raw. People might call this compassion—but I don’t know that it is. It is actually that I have experienced more unpleasant things than others simply because I’m me. I appear to others as a sociopath, when most of the time I really don’t try to. I have been mistreated—thoroughly—thus I understand the dark parts of human nature—the bullying and ostracizing, the blacklisting and lack of mercy, the crimes and the murders. And these things have marked me.
He was sinking, disappearing. He was giving up. He didn’t know where he was.
I pick up the cheesecake again. I try to will myself not to eat it, but I take a bite.
Sherlock lifts himself up, mouth falling open at the slide of Daddy’s cock in him, and slides back down, and then up and then down, and Daddy keeps his firm hands on his hips, guiding him, and he listens to his cute little noises, and watches him attentively, with hungry eyes.
Sylvan Rabbit arrives in a light blue Honda station wagon. His unremarkable brown hair is balding. He is thin, except for a small potbelly. I note the size and make of the brogues he wears—disturbingly similar to John’s—and the length of his steps. He carries a black canvas shoulder bag. The starch in his lapels and the gel in his har indicates that he works as a hotel manager at an upscale place.
Sherlock sighed into John’s shoulder.
Please,
We go to the bedroom and Daddy cocoons me in blankets
“I had toast,” I lie. The truth is that I haven’t had much of an appetite today.
The hospital blanket was bunched up by his feet. He could feel that his hospital gown was short sleeved. His ugly scarred arms. Naked. “Need the blanket.”
There was no time to cut. He opened his eyes. With John gone, Sherlock had thrown himself into his work. He worked faster now that he didn’t have to wait for John and explain things to him. He had expected private clients outside of the Met to dwindle without the publicity from John’s blog. But for whatever reason—maybe he had created enough of a good name for himself—he was still heavily in demand. And John’s blog post had set off a buzz of activity that was sparking interest from the media. The Guardian published a short piece,
He thought about letting go of Lestrade’s hand, but settled with opening his eyes. It was too bright. He squinted, pushed away some tears. He cleared his throat. “Where’s John?”
“John,” Sherlock started. His eyes were nervous, shy. “John—” (but what would he even say? He was never good with angry people. Maybe he should beg.)
“I’m so sorry, my sweet boy,” John says. “I love you very much. I’ll never leave you. I don’t ever want to leave my boy alone, do you hear me? I won’t do it again. Hm?”
Steamed peas are quite gentle. I make some of those too.
Suicide was easy. Living was hard.
Daddy slides a hand into Sherlock’s and Sherlock toddles after Daddy to the kitchen, his other arm clutching Bee. He sits cross-legged on one of the kitchen chairs, watching Daddy whisk away. He wants to help, but Daddy doesn’t like him near the stove. That’s one of their rules, especially after that one time Sherlock burned his hand….
Sherlock sniffles and yawns.
Lestrade laid the blanket over him. It was wool. It itched. He smelled disinfectant. It was too hot. He hid underneath the blanket.
“Present?” he says.
“Okay,” John said soothingly, placing a hand on Sherlock’s. “Can you try some toast?”
“I can’t eat this,” he declared.
“Who hated you? Your parents? Bullies?” Lestrade asked.
“Yes,” his sweet love admitted. “Mycroft has been pestering me.”
For the first time, fear outweighed the perverse pleasure and he collapsed.
Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. “Daddy!”
He burrows deeper into the sofa’s cool leather, ignoring John—but, oh, the fact that John can tell this is different from his usual strops—the tears come again, tearing through his body, making him heave.
It's been a long night. Tomorrow I’m going to analyze that soil sample from Matilda’s garden. And then I’m going to follow Sylvan Rabbit the next time he takes a girl forcibly by the arm away from my sight.
John woke before Sherlock because he was cold. Opening his eyes, he saw that Sherlock had stolen the covers somehow, even as he remained huddled into John for warmth. Sherlock was snuffling into his sleep shirt, clutching him tightly. John sighed. The day before, he’d have had no idea that Sherlock could be so… diminutive?
, harder and harder, until he felt the cool steel deep inside him, and the rush of blood swelling to the surface.
PART TWO
“Did my sweet boy eat today?” he asks.
Sherlock mocked, wresting his arm back. “Get over yourself. I don’t need your—your everyday concerns, your plebian worries. I’m not a duty or a—a charity case, Dr Watson, and I am not your friend. You are not my friend.”
He drifted at the edges of the park’s open-air theater…. The way Sherlock acted—like he or John would leave any moment—the
He texted Lestrade,
. If you’re telling me I’m a freak—”
morality. It was easy. He had no survival instinct. He was barely human.
Today all the calculations and knowledge of precautions he’d developed went out the window. Maybe he was finally being healthy and developing a sense of self-preservation, maybe he was simply more of a coward than before, because he was suddenly worried about his bow arm when he had dismissed it as a concern years ago. What if he would never be able to play again? How stupid he was to throw it away. Trash everything and burn it to the ground. He’d always wanted to mess things up for himself—to fail in the worst and deepest ways possible. He wanted to ruin things for himself. He deserved it.
“Ye—e—ah!” Sherlock screams. “I—love you, Da—a—addyyyy!”
“Everything!”
among them. He couldn’t accept help. He didn’t know how. Maybe he didn’t deserve it. He was so impossibly, irrevocably broken.
“No,” I snap.
“Such a good boy, such a sweet little hole for me,” Daddy growls into his ear, pounding him, punishing him so sweetly, and Sherlock
John chuckles. “No, you dolt, I’ve had a long day and wanted your company.”
“We’ll see,” Sherlock said.
“Still not enough for a six-foot man.”
“You can’t help me,” Sherlock said. “This is just how I am.”
“Okay,” Sherlock said, quietly. He didn’t know if he should smile or cry.
“Yes. I could,” Sherlock said.
i know ive hurt people
Maybe it was this novelty that had him panting, gripping his wrist. All of a sudden, his usual appreciation of the beauty of his ravaged arm turned into disgust. It was ugly. Instead of feeling slower, centered, cocooned in pain from his mind’s never-ending churning, and able to get up and confront the day, he lay huddled on his side like dead weight.
I dress in my usual suit and coat and head out where I hail a cab to Brixton, where John and I had our first case.
He felt the pain too. More than usual. Instead of a centering ache, it ripped into him, made him shake and clutch his arm to his chest and whimper pathetically, silently. His pinky and ring finger were weak and, not for the first time, he worried about losing mobility. As he was a violinist, he had taken the precaution of only cutting on his right arm, though he was not left-handed. His right arm was his bow arm, and he had calculated that his left hand required more dexterity when playing his violin. Cutting on his right arm also meant that the blade was handled by his left—his non-dominant hand—which, while it lacked the same amount of control, it also, he thought, lacked the same strength. He knew cutting deeply meant possible damage to his ligaments and tendons—he wasn’t an idiot. He was careful, always so
Sherlock waved a hand in acquiescence. He felt like smiling, laughing. He didn’t.
to have control. Because he—he was always in trouble, and it was so easy to let go and sink into invisibility, where no one knew him, where he didn’t have to do anything, could squander his life and his brain in that bad place, because he was a failure, because he deserved to rot. He could lie in his filth, could let himself fall from society, morality, his
“Well—oh. Oh. Yeah, of course,” Lestrade said.
Oh, god.
There was a smattering of polite applause. He collected his winnings and stood, gathering his coat around him. The cannibal placed a hand on his shoulder. He could feel her nails digging into his flesh. “It’s been a while. Would you stay for a bit, my dear?” she leered, licking her lips.
He was suffocating in it. It crawled up his skin. He was drowning. It was too much.
But that wasn’t healthy. That was extreme. Surely that hadn’t been Sherlock’s intention when he’d forced John to cut himself. Surely Sherlock had been—swept away by his—anger, or his—depression. John just didn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to be sad, why that had sparked Sherlock’s anger. Maybe Sherlock could
“I don’t like cheesecake, Mister Holmes,” she says.
In this life, with his… fake motivations, and petty ambition… he was too busy to cut…. He was too busy to eat….
“If I have to go, will you come with me?”
never leave me alone.
There were so many words inside Sherlock,
“If we cuddle will you eat?” Daddy says, kissing Sherlock’s forehead.
There’s a thin girl Matilda’s age—8 years old—climbing out a from a smudged basement window. Not Matilda. She is dressed in an old dress too short for her. She grew. Matilda always dresses well; her clothes always fit.
“You’ve always been available to him in the past, haven’t you? Why shouldn’t you be available now? Keep being available to him, John.”
I want cheesecake and donuts and a whole tub of ice cream. And fried chicken and pizza. A slab of mozzarella, a jar of peanut butter. Pies.
“Bzzz, bzzz. All better,” Sherlock says quietly. They lay there, happy and warm and content together, the plastic medical toys on the bed between them. Then Sherlock rolls over on his side, facing Daddy. “Daddy?”
“…My arm hurts.”
“No, Sherlock,” John said. His face seemed suddenly slack. “You’re free to do whatever you want. You always were. Did you know, Sherlock, the reason why you don’t understand why I was crying—it’s not because I’m unreasonable, okay? It’s because you—you don’t get it, do you? It’s because that’s what friends do. They care about each other. And I was going to—to be there for y—but I can’t. Not anymore. You—you think cutting makes you… who you are, I guess. But I can’t.” He was backing away, hands up, his bleeding forearms bared to Sherlock. “I can’t. I’m sorry.”
In his mind, he began to compile a list of himself. Maybe he would start an anonymous blog. He thought, reaching back into his light mind, about his list….
“Well, I can’t can I? There’s a—a whole world in his head, and he’s gone into it. I can’t reach him.” John half laughed. This was how therapy usually went. It was a gradual breakdown of his communication skills and then they said goodbye and he went on his way. God. And then—“Oh, god. I’ve just realized we haven’t spoken a word to each other in two weeks. That’s odd, isn’t it? We live together.”
he thought, laughing sadly,
I love the soft lamplight of our home. But today I feel too big for it. Too clumsy and angry and confused.
The steady beeping of the patient’s heart monitor and the smell of disinfectant did nothing to soothe John’s nerves. He shifted his toes in his brogues. They were sweaty underneath the hardy leather. He fussed with his white coat. He didn’t normally wear one when practicing. Strictly speaking, this wasn’t his part of the hospital. After his injury in the war, he’d been unable to practice as a surgeon, and had decided to work as a GP, away from the triage environment of the emergency room, which he had thought mimicked an active war zone too closely. The old boring life suited him. He liked a simple life. Well, he did in a certain way. He liked going on cases and coming home to Baker Street with Sherlock, and he liked having a motherly landlady. He liked danger and the assurance that followed. Yes, he was alive, yes, it was not all a dream, yes, be careful with your life, and with Sherlock’s.
John had a sneaking suspicion what would have followed, but that word was never used these days, not since Mary. That word belonged in a time long before grief and relapse and heartbreak.
“All clear?” Sherlock asked.
After one or the other had no real need for any further assistance, they would both slip back to either sides of their invisible line until the next trauma or illness pushed them together again.
The scar was larger than he had expected, no-doubt interrupted in its healing process by a makeshift patch-up job on a battlefield and the heat of severe infection. The result was a web of pink-to-white lines, thick like veins, puckered with the effort of holding everything together.
She slung the coat over Mycroft’s chair but didn't sit down.
Sherlock felt himself both mentally and physically brace for Mycroft’s introductory comment, surely a ‘we knew this was going to happen sooner or later’ or a ‘this is why you shouldn’t get involved’, but his guard was unneeded.
Lights bright in his eyes, he saw the silhouette of a woman peering down at him.
His body quivered with the force of them, with the force of the realisation that he was too far in to his situation to hold head above water and he was continuing to spiral. His brother, for all his apparent power in the realms of national and international politics and warfare could not help him now.
Sherlock.
“Start a new case?” the detective asked, unsure.
When he was roused some hours later it was not by a question or a polite tap on the shoulder but by a softened kick to the side of his head.
His temples were throbbing, his back protested from his slouched position in this horrid chair, his arms and hands ached from executing chest compressions.
John was looking at him from beneath half closed eyelids, the one corner of his lip curled slightly, “people will talk.”
“Wait, no, one more thing.” And John unclipped the ladybird from Sherlock’s curls. “Might damage the no nonsense image,” he said pocketing the hairpin and standing up.
“Sherlock?” she asked.
“Yes, probably,” John agreed, lightly dabbing at the cuts, eyes squinting to pick out any flecks of glass now visible once the blood was mopped away.
“What time is it?” He asked, the thick grey sky - not to mention the concussion and fatigue - skewing his perceptions of anything as grounded as minutes and hours.
Sherlock looked down at where John’s hand still rested on his knee and sighed.
And then the eleven short words seemed to exhaust him for John’s eyes slipped closed for a few seconds, the half smile faltering, the tense pained look he wore in his sleep returning to his brows.
For the first time in some years, Sherlock was lost for words. The warmth that washed over him trumped the feeling of solace he had felt from the cigarette tenfold. Whatever he said to his flatmate now would do little to communicate the vast abatement coursing through him.
Distracted by this suggestion, Sherlock didn’t react at all to the second splinter’s removal.
“I says to John, why didn't they let you keep it, split the money two ways and you could be living somewhere nice and cosy, have an office too, proper official.
A detailed account of all he had been told and overheard from the medical staff was not what Sherlock wanted to revisit. Not now, not with the rain lashing down, the vacant eyes of a young heroin addict staring through him, the extra long cigarette in his hand already burned down to half.
In the absence of anything but a hollow structure, he waited in the black like a ghost.
The taller man awkwardly discarded of his Belstaff before taking his seat at the fireside. It must have been raining outside for his trouser legs and shoes glistened with a dewy shimmer only encountered when braving midwinter weather in London.
He had sat on the steps waiting, chewing at his fraying sleeves and generally unnerving passersby who were not accustomed to seeing this sort of man in Knightsbridge.
John gave a light cough before saying, “if this slew of evening cases has anything to do with Rosie-”
In his confusion he sat up abruptly, his back protesting at the sudden change of position after a long time hunched over.
Harry was an exceptionally easy read.
“Happy ending then...just not the sort they’re used to at that kind of club.”
He scraped his chair closer to John’s bed, crossing his arms on the mattress and resting his forehead on top.
“And what have they said to you about John?” Harry continued. “They said stuff to me but I couldn’t take it all in, not on the phone, not when they’d woken me up.”
“Ten to nine,” Mycroft said, looking at his watch. “Morning.” Then, with the eagerness of a man who had suddenly thought of a tactful way of leaving the room without seeming rude, he said: “Time for tea, I think.”
Without a word, he leaned into Sherlock’s space and slid the clip into his messy curls, tucking them away from the injured area.
Sherlock nodded, watching as her hand hovered over her brother's, her decision to touch it halted by the intrusion of an oximeter and cannula.
Then Mycroft had pulled him to him, head to chest, one arm across his shoulder, the other placing a hand on the wrist that lay in Sherlock’s lap.
The pull of sleep, however unadvisable, had its merits. A deep dreamless state was what he needed, away from the reality of heart monitors and his flatmate’s blood under his nails.
John replied with a curt nod, as if to say ‘that’s settled then’.
He had escaped the scuffle with a minor concussion - the result of John’s heroism and his head meeting a brick wall.
The cold realisation in his words, coupled with those damn Watson eyes boring into him made him feel simultaneously anguished and nauseous.
So in tune, he was these days, to the sound of tiptoed feet across the landing - Rosie’s bedtime routine of exploration and hiding before sleep - that the hushed sound of footfall on the stairs was enough to jerk John awake from his doze at the fireside.
John gave a little laugh that turned to a cough which ultimately turned into a groan of pain.
Long gone were the days of violin concertos at three in the morning or wake up calls to gunfire in the living room.
“It’s all a blur,” he said, filling his lungs with the cheap tobacco smoke so he didn’t have to elaborate.
In any other situation this odd question would have goaded Sherlock easily into an account of everything he knew about the fairer Watson - from the points he had deduced mere minutes from his first meeting of John, to the snippets of texts he had read over his flatmate’s shoulder.
“Of course I want to, why wouldn’t I? You’re the two people I l-” Sherlock stopped himself.
Satisfied, he left the room, closing the door on John and the phenomenon that had just risen between them.
Satisfied, she ran a hand over John’s hair one last time and said goodbye.
“Your face is too recognisable now, mate. You should start sending me out in your place...actually, on second thoughts, scrap that.”
More touching of the white webbing at her brother’s shoulder.
John leaned in closer, watching the firelight flicker off the cuts and counting each splinter he noticed. One, two, three….four.
“Well, I was thinking more dinner but you know me, dim sum and dead bodies can cross paths quite easily.” John closed the tweezers around the third shard and tugged.
“Don’t be angry with me,” Sherlock said, lowering the handkerchief to reveal a smattering of angry looking gashes across his cheek.
John felt Sherlock grab a fistful of his cardigan and shirt, a brush of the detective’s fingers was cold against his back. John took this as a sign of the younger man’s readiness for the tweezers. He chose his first shard, one just beside Sherlock’s nostril, and gave it a swift tug.
“Sherlock, what the h-”
“No,” Sherlock agreed, for there was little point in kidding himself.
Sherlock took the cigarette and felt no guilt. Harry was right, if he couldn't smoke now when was he allowed to? By the same token, if Harry asked whether she could down a few glasses of red when she went home, he'd hardly refuse.
John made out yet another ghost of smile on Sherlock’s lips. The shadows of the dying fire giving his friend’s face a grave tone.
John always said Harry had a lot to say about nothing in particular.
The first and second fingers of her right hand were darker at the tips from heavy smoking. Both hands had a tremor that could be exasperated by the stress of her brother's current state but certainly had its root in withdrawal from excessive drinking after many years of being climatised to it.
He stood up to his full height, mumbled something about getting a cup of tea.
“And that’s the last of it,” John said, lightly pressing on the final strip applied just above Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Should heal well enough in a few days.”
“Easy there, fella,” Harry said, a flat palm on the sleeve of his Belstaff.
“What’s he told you about me?” She asked.
“I met your sister,” he chose to say, unsure himself why this had any weight in conveying his feelings.
There had been a rough squeeze and murmurs of reassurance. He had buried his face in the lapel of his brother’s suit jacket, the soft cotton the first warm comfort he’d received in days.
Mycroft had come out, impeccably dressed, bringing with him a faint scent of coffee, expensive cologne and the office’s papery bureaucracy.
And if out of a mutual defiance they locked eyes with each other, holding their gaze.
“Yes, sounds very tedious. Not sure how you stayed awake for that one,” John said, unclipping the catches on his kit and opening it up. Rummaging through, he took out a few antiseptic wipes, a pair of tweezers, some scissors and a pack of adhesive strips. He then rifled through his pockets, pulling out one of Rosie’s ladybird hairclips.
“Christ,” she said again.
But Sherlock didn’t argue, instead he ran his finger across the foreign object holding his hair in place and smiled slightly.
“You can stop dabbing that same spot if you like, John, I think you’ve cleaned it quite sufficiently,” Sherlock said with a slight coldness to his tone. His head jerked away just a fraction.
In the absence of the harsh hospital lights, tangible thought soon melted away, replaced with a mental pacing of windowless corridors in his mind palace. Locked doors. Landings that looked over at nothing. Dead ends.
A quick glance at John's amused face reassured him that he hadn't done something inexcusable.
John looked up, a loud sigh escaping him before he downed the rest of his brandy and put his tumbler down at his side. “Dare I ask? Auditioning for a part in the Phantom of the Opera?”
“The fact of the matter is, Sherlock, she’s looking for you before going off to bed. She asks me where you go in the evenings. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say she wants to make sure you’re safe before she sleeps.”
But now, that old war injury was mere background noise. John was in pain, he could tell.
for tomorrow’s bedtime. I heard it’s a real cracker, you should read it with us after dinner,” John said, edging forward slightly.
When Sherlock had met John at the very beginning all those months ago that now seemed like a lifetime, he had thought him - aesthetically at least - plain.
The relief was so immediate and so apparent that his balance faltered and he had to put a hand out to the wall for support.
Sherlock had been staring unseeing at John’s hand, it was only when it moved fractionally towards him did he actually notice the direction of his gaze.
“Says the man with the bleeding face?” John snorted.
He was a man who had grown out his clipped military haircut, who donned chequered shirts that aged him, whose face wore the creases of someone who had little to smile about of late.
A long moment of silence just holding, in the dark, as the ashes of the fire cooled.
“You might be sporting a black eye by tomorrow. Don’t think they’ll let us in anywhere fancy,” John said, discarding the tweezers and unboxing the adhesive strips.
A wavering half smile graced Mycroft’s mouth for a mere second. He leaned over to Sherlock, clasping a wrist.
He held out a hand for Sherlock, who took it in his own, and got to his feet.
“Why would it?” Sherlock asked abruptly.
Sherlock had refrained from touching him. He was unable to recall a single time he had ever wanted to touch someone with the intensity that he felt now, but he couldn’t.
A swift movement closed the gap between them and John was unsure as to whether the lurch forward had been by him or Sherlock. This particular train of thought, however, was lost to a sudden frantic collision of his lips on his best friend’s. A tight embrace. A violent urge to kick himself for not doing this before. A short, sharp sob. Further kissing. A large handful of Sherlock’s shirt sleeve bunched at the shoulder.
John wiped the tweezers clean and located the second shard, across Sherlock’s cheek.
He pulled on his filthy Belstaff and unhooked Mycroft's umbrella from the back of the chair.
“So, what happened to the suspect?” John asked, finishing the clean-up job and picking up the tweezers.
The solitude that lay in the wake of the two sibling visits was a lot less charged than it had been a few hours previous. The background rhythm of monitors beeping sounded less like a timer ticking down.
At the sound of the final step of the stairs squeaking, the quiet thud of quality shoes on wood, John breathed.
“Of course I’m alright, you have eyes.”
A small smile, a swipe of her hair and a cautious glance to the bed.
“Mum thought it was a mercy blow, him getting invalided out of Afghanistan.
“Wound someone up at the pub?”
“Look at yourself,” John said back at him firmly, retracting his hand.
In the few seconds when his mind had caved to a heavy black weight of impact, the suspect had landed his blow and so had John.
“Thank you,” the taller man said, starting to get up from his kneeling position.
She whipped round, her cigarettes evidently in her coat.
Sherlock’s were as catlike as ever, even more so between the hours of 7pm and 6am when the volume of the house was dictated by a slumbering two-year-old.
“Mmph ‘erlock,” John said, his hand gripping the bedside rail to stop himself being pushed sideways.
The detective took the proffered hand, or at least the last three fingers.
“We’ll work it out,” Mycroft had said.
In the few months that they had known each other, Sherlock had realised that not only was John the very best heart to his head, he had a way of knowing a lot about Sherlock instinctively - his moods, his behaviours, his habits - even if Sherlock's reactions to these things remained somewhat alien to John. Maybe this was a normal occurrence when two people were able to cohabitate relatively harmoniously over an extended period time. But Sherlock suspected they were particularly well matched.
In the firelight the darker-haired man looked tired, the flickering shadows casting darkness in the hollows of his cheeks and under his eyes. John noted that there were a few more lines around his eyes than when they had last been this close to notice, there were also a few more nicks and scars dotted here and there.
A flash of something unfamiliar graced Sherlock’s face at these words, but it was gone momentarily and replaced with a barely-there smile. “A Watson family trait, I think,” he said.
“What do you need?” Mycroft had asked, a look back at the security guard, who took the hint and slipped back inside.
“Of course.”
“Just so you know,” John began, cutting up more strips. “We - Rosie and me, I mean - we love you and as far as I’m concerned we’re all in this together. Whatever ‘this’ is. I know it’s not normal to be raising a child with your best friend but if you’ll have us I want it to be that way. There’s no one I want to do this with other than you….again, whatever ‘this’ is.”
“Has he been out of it since he came in?”
When the detective spoke, a few stitches already applied, his voice sounded huskier than it had been and almost timid. “I would like that very much.”
“Good, I may need your assistance,” said Sherlock, closing the door behind him with one hand, his other pressing a handkerchief to his face.
“She reads too many of the tabloids, thinks everyone fighting overseas is coming back in bits. She thought once he’d had his stint it would...I dunno...prove something, I guess. But John has always been fighting some cause, defending something..someone. That’s just how he is.”
The crackle of fire began to die away as its yellow blaze simmered to an orange glow, leaving little more than embers and charred logs in the grate.
A small reciprocating peck from John was enough to bring Sherlock back to his wits and he stumbled away.
Sherlock blinked, shifting his head to face the source of the query.
“No,” Sherlock said, eyes remaining on the bed beside him.
Sherlock didn’t answer but, knowing John, that would be enough for the older man to understand that yes, things were a bit not good.
The hand slid to the back of his neck and there was a light squeeze.
“Ladybird is all I have...don’t worry, it’s a good look. Think it may even rival the deerstalker. Now give me that,” John gestured to the handkerchief and Sherlock passed it to him.
As John finished applying the last of the butterfly stitches, it seemed true darkness had engulfed most of the flat. A single lamp at the bookshelf now their only source of light.
“I’m doing a morning shift at the surgery tomorrow, maybe Mrs Hudson could have Rosie and we could do something afterwards?”
She didn’t finish her sentence, instead taking a long drag to fill the void.
Sherlock had been expecting the question. When he didn't answer, John gave a squeeze of his hand and said: “Sherlock?”
A warm, solid weight on his shoulder, indicated the arrival of his brother; the clip of a metal umbrella nib hitting the tiled floor confirmed it.
“Oh, ugh, yeah. She went down about an hour ago,” John replied, running a hand through his hair as he remembered that that would be a dead giveaway too.
Sherlock wondered if his reservations to show much skin were down to the injury or the evidence of his once strong soldier body rounding at the edges due to sedate civilian living and the readily availability of Hobnobs and takeaway.
There was still blood under his nails now, no matter how much he had scrubbed his hands in the tiny corner sink of the hospital ward.
“Only if you want to.”
He had been nineteen and out of his mind outside Mycroft’s office. Security hadn’t let him in, why would they have? He had been wearing a hooded sweatshirt despite the summer heat. It had been far too big for him and scattered with cigarette burns.
Sherlock resumed his position with his head on his arms at the foot of John’s bed and sleep rose to him almost instantly.
Sherlock frowned. One look told John that the musical back catalogue of Andrew Lloyd Webber had long been deleted from the detective’s hard drive if it had ever been there at all.
She was unmistakably a Watson.
“Christ,” she said. Then her hands were at her trouser pockets, patting them down.
“Are you alright?” Mycroft said, the warmth of his hand burned on Sherlock’s clammy neck.
“So I’m told,” Sherlock replied, he too watching the girl, her feet in tatty, once-pink slippers trudging across the wet pavement. The tails of her pyjama bottoms already visibly sodden.
“You,” he had said before the reality of his state - sat there on the doorstep of some anonymous, faceless office, his brother’s figure carving a sharp contrast to his own - slapped him as hard as if Mycroft had done it himself and he began to sob.
The crook handle stood hooked around its back, keeping his brother’s seat.
He kept twitching, hands swiping down his front every few minutes, as if an electric current was sparking - pain hitting a pitch that needed to be addressed.
By the time they returned to the ward, Mycroft had already left. A cup of tea sat on the bedside next to a small cup of tablets and a handwritten note.
“Why do they always run, John? It was an easy one...I picked an easy one.” Sherlock huffed, staring into the dying fire, tracing a hand over the leather arm of his chair.
Mycroft’s umbrella accomodated the detective and his smaller companion easily, so much so that a few of the other smokers shifted a little towards them, hoping to steal some protection from the black canopy.
He could feel Sherlock’s eyes upon him now, not just looking at him, but reading him, no doubt picking up on the way his hand was moving, the intensity to which he was looking at the cuts, the fact that he had unconsciously slipped his free hand onto Sherlock’s knee and given it a gentle squeeze.
Harry stopped drinking and looked at him with sudden clarity. “Go home, John,” she said.
Sherlock spun John around and released him. “Look at it!” he said. “It’s just a cut.”
The razor was cool against his arm. There was a sheen of dried blood on his skin and it made his razor feel like it was scraping against him. He took a breath and took another breath. He felt heady. It was so easy to imagine the blade sliding through his skin, just grazing at first, then—a rush of adrenaline as he willed himself to push through the pain, through instinct, summoning that perverseness inside him in order to keep pressing down, down,
cause i keep running away and i don’t know why
John grabbed the blanked and distributed it over the both of them equally. Safe under its warmth, he leaned down and hugged Sherlock, kissing tousled curls. This was nice, the way the pale light fought against drawn curtains and lit the room like a whisper. It was nice, the way Sherlock closed his eye and the edges of his mouth quirked up, the way he breathed so slowly, completely relaxed. John thought of older times when he’d wake up thinking how surreal it was to still be alive, to still wake up, day after day. Now, waking into the feeling of warmth and contentment shocked him, made him ache with tenderness for the younger man who was curled into him and around him. He was seized by the urge to kiss the detective’s nose, his cheeks, his forehead, his eyelids….
John opens up a medical journal and I look at a cold case file, but I am mentally going over Matilda’s case. Hazily, I think up a plan to sneak out of the house when John is sleeping to investigate Mr. Rabbit’s nighttime adventures.
SAFE: IN YOUR ARMS
—the stupid imbeciles who can’t face the truth.
I think after each bite. But I can’t. I’m starving.
—engaged in… self-harm. Self-injury. The term was hard to even think. He’d seen…
He wasn’t sure what the fixation on food meant. Just that he was hungry but he didn’t—couldn’t—eat. He stared into the fridge, itching in his body, feeling restless. He could not eat! He forbade himself to eat, even drink water. He would not consume and he would not waste. If he ate—if he ate—
“If Mycroft’s involved, it’s probably going to be posh,” John agreed.
He uses the last of his energy to get to the sofa, where he sits.
his mind screamed,
“Uh, chrysanthemums, because queen bee likes their nectar best! And Bee always wants to make his queen happy. Daddy, did you know Bee likes dragon snaps better though? Cause mummy liked them better, but daddy—” he cuts himself off.
“And when my sweet boy is sad, sometimes his arms look like this…”
He thought he knew why John liked to write so much when he had no talent. Because it kept his facts straight. Somewhere out there, there was a version of the truth that said exactly what John wanted it to say.
his own heart catching.
People were never sympathetic with him. He was mostly okay with this. He was so brilliant that he was indispensible.
to help but I—maybe this is normal for him. He’s been getting distant. I tried to help him, but he—he keeps leaving. In his room, in his mind palace. So I’m trying to give him his space, but…”
THE PERSONAL BLOG OF DR JOHN H. WATSON
Lestrade waited.
,” Sherlock growled. “I’m
I apologize for how badly this chapter is written. And that I haven't updated in a while. I just can't seem to write.
“Idiot,” Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock gathered himself one last time. He didn’t know how to get John to stay. He didn’t know anything. He stood up straight and reminded himself that life is a war. “I don’t need your help,” he whispered, so strong through it all. “I did it before by myself. I don’t need you. I never need you.”
Lestrade had no reaction to Sherlock’s admission that he had been in his office. “Yeah, how
Sherlock felt inexplicably bereft. “Where are you going? Why?”
He stopped outside a fish and chips shop. He was so stupid. He didn’t deserve to eat.
The door to the bedroom swung open. “Sherlock—”
“Never mind,” Sherlock rasped. For the first time in his life, Sherlock didn’t want to know. He couldn’t anymore. He wanted the weight of the world off his shoulders for once.
I get on a treadmill and run, collecting miles. I used to run marathons and belong to a boxing club. John has never known this about me. I don’t think I will ever tell him.
He flexed his left hand, the cut on his palm reopening and bleeding slowly. The wounds Sherlock had given him were discreet. No one noticed them. It was a nice day. The sun was out. The flowers were in full bloom. He was so sorry. The beauty of it all made him feel insignificant. Sherlock was like this magnificent day. He was beautiful and John was just a drifter swept up in Sherlock’s world.
But it didn’t make sense to him that Sherlock—
Lestrade turned back to Sherlock. “What are you doing here anyway? Didn’t John say you were—”
Sherlock smiles. He loves it when Daddy is Doctor. He wiggles into the bed and blankets, feeling warm and happy. He puts his hand on his tummy. “Daddy, tummy.”
“Sorry, Daddy…”
Daddy chuckles happily, glad his sweet boy is pleased with his gift. “Do you like it, my good boy?”
“Yeah, yeah,” John mumbled. “You’re right. Just. I’m
Sherlock holds his Bee tightly.
He turns around. It takes all of his strength, and once he does it, he buries his face in John’s strong shoulder, sobbing. “Da—a—
Lestrade frowned. “It looked like you were going on pretty well.”
“IT’S OKAY THAT YOU CUT, SHERLOCK!” John yelled, turning, finally, and his face was frightening. “I don’t give a damn what the hell you do, you leaving poison in the food so I can’t eat it and—breaking the furniture and shooting the walls! I DON’T GIVE A DAMN! NOT ANYMORE!”
Fitfully, his frown carving deep into his forehead, he turned over on the couch, pressing his side into the back. He hugged a pillow to his chest. Harry had a problem with not following through. Every time she said she’d get sober, she didn’t. But what did that matter? John was just as invisible to the world as she was. He lay there until night came and Harry went out. He poured Harry’s alcohol down the sink and began to clean the flat. Not before pouring himself a glass of Harry’s good whiskey, though.
“Sherlock?” Daddy says softly. He puts his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. “Does my sweet boy have a fever?”
“It’s been about a month. I just leave him alone, I guess, but I do bandage him up if he needs it. He’s been so distant, though. Like he rarely leaves his room. And about a week after, I found him… I found him…”
from cases? To tell Greg Sherlock was down, like he and Greg were two parents that could stop him from doing something? To assume he didn’t know what was best for himself? To assume he knew
Living with Harry is a whirlwind, just like living with Sherlock is. Just in a different way. Nothing to say that’s not completely pointless and depressing. Just. I won’t be updating very frequently. If you want to know how he’s doing, you know where his blog is.
There was a roar…. It was so loud. But it was in the background. Stop it! He was trying to think!
Sherlock listens to Daddy search around for one of the plastic bandaids and puts it on Bee.
I think further since I will have to get quite a lot of calories in this meal to make up for the meals I skipped today. Intellectually, I know I must stop losing weight (although that would put me firmly on the side of survival, and sometimes I would rather feel the pull towards death).
A young Ms Wiggins, the cannibal’s assistant, dealt the cards. People emerged from the shadows to watch, crowding around the table. The cannibal, grey hair hanging from her head in oily strands, bet two houses in Leinster Gardens. She smiled, mouth gaping. The other two bet a gold ring and a watch. Sherlock bet a pile of cash. Simple. Detached.
“Why don’t you believe me? I said I would. I told you I’m fine. I exercise precautions. For god’s sake. Did you think I was lying? I already said what I think. I’m done here.”
“Wow… yeah, wow.”
So he did have a heart. And it told him what he did not want to know—that he was in a hospital. He fumbled shakily at the wires. Stop it. He didn’t want to know any more about his location, or his heart. It was the telltale beating of his heart. He didn’t want to deduce anymore. It was too much. He needed it to stop.
John, more than he could see himself. After all, he had seen that John’s limp was psychosomatic and that he had been to Afghanistan, could read the pauses between John’s words. He saw the steel in him, knew he was a perfect shot…. Maybe Sherlock had seen how John had first tried to help Sherlock, but then had given him his space, because maybe that was the easy thing to do….
Panic starts building deep in his chest. Please, please, please. Maybe he did something wrong and John is sleeping upstairs in his old room, please, please.
Sherlock gasps, trembling, nods weakly, clutching at Daddy.
When I’m done with that, I climb into John’s lap and wrap my arms around him and nuzzle into his neck.
I close my eyes and drift in a dreamscape of tea and gunpowder and mint toothpaste.
I check on my experiments and water the plants. This takes about an hour. I finish up a blog post on identifying marks on the nails of murder victims. Then I decide to check up on a case that I have not yet officially taken.
While John talks, I am able to eat less observed. I make it through my toast and egg, a small serving of peas, and manage 10 pistachios. Then I spoon out the yogurt slice a banana over the vanilla yogurt. I sprinkle cinnamon and drizzle honey over it. It’s a sweet dessert I like to have from time to time.
He hugged Sherlock tighter. It was like he thought would happen. Once he got a hold of him, he couldn’t let go. The detective’s body was all hard angles and bony hips. He needed feeding up.
The scabs on his arms had faded to pink scars, then to barely visible lines of opalescent white. He missed the feeling. He felt too disconnected now, removed from his body. He didn’t feel aware of himself. He forgot to eat. It was almost distressing. He wasn’t… he didn’t have an eating disorder. It was all right, the not eating. He liked it. He felt sharp. Right? He… couldn’t think…. But… he was more prone to shame, now, without cutting. Interactions with people left him confused, bereft, guilty. But he didn’t have time to cut. Cutting was too time consuming.
I’m tired of this. I don’t even have anything to say anymore. No excuses or stories or meanings behind this. Not even any feelings. I just am completely depleted and humbled by this. I am just a body. Nothing special at all.
He cut himself. Each cut settled him in his transport and made him forget himself. He was just a body. Did it matter what had happened to him in the past? No, not really. He was his own person, removed from himself, from his childhood, his origin. He was no one, really. The world was big. He thought about the strings of connections people made, the predictable possibilities that sprung from these strings. He cut the strings that connected him to the past. His future was unknown. He had a blank slate. He had no past.
“Daddy,” Sherlock moans, and that’s all the begging Daddy needs to hear, ‘cause his little boy
Sherlock was so tired. When John beckoned, he followed. No, no, no, he thought. He had to go forward, had to leave, had to do something, had to achieve, had to prove he was alive for something, otherwise everything would fall apart.
For a moment John simply stood there, taking everything in. Sherlock—
I can’t finish it, so instead I focus on John and note that the man with the gangrenous foot fits Sylvan Rabbit’s description. I file this piece of information away to look at later and follow John to the couch where he drapes me across his lap. I huff into his warm belly and again, feel myself relaxing.
