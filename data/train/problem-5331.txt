“Talk to me,” Cas said, not stopping his hand motion along Dean’s shoulders.
“You ever get nostalgic, Cas?
Cas offered him a grimace of sympathy but there was a fond smile playing on his lips. “I could...” he held out two fingers, just in front of his forehead, waiting for the OK to clean him up with a tap.
Panic surged up through every nerve in Dean’s body. This was all wrong. How could he have gotten this so wrong? “No, wait, Cas-“
“It’s really not that big of a deal,” Dean muttered, capturing Cas’s attention instantly. “He just said something about your wings. How ‘fabulous’ they were looking these days,” and he even used finger quotes both to show that he would never use the word ‘fabulous’ to describe anything and also to earn an amused quirk of the lips from Cas, “and, I dunno. Guess it just kinda made me miss out on being able to see them,” he finished with a shrug, trying to cover for how ridiculous he sounded.
“Doesn’t matter. The movie was never the point.”
Cas grinned back at him, cupping his jaw in his palm. “We can work on that together, too.”
He prays.
When he chanced a glance up at Cas’s face, it was to find him transfixed; his expression caught between awe and despair. Dean needed to get rid of it immediately. “I mean, I know it’s not like I’ve ever seen them. Well, I guess maybe in hell? But when you did that whole peacocking thing in the barn?” Another shrug. “That was pretty awesome. You haven’t done anything like that since.”
Barely a week went by that Dean didn’t pay a visit to the headstone.
Both Castiel and Sam stopped with their forks hovering in front of their mouths, staring at Dean, nursing his second coffee of the morning. Breakfast had been a quiet affair until that point. Some grumbled – but not surly – good mornings and the silent plating of waffles Dean had been cooking up. Dean’s question had come from seemingly nowhere.
When Sam first tells Dean he believes Heaven, Dean laughs in his face. He’s eleven years old and he’s already seen more horrors than anyone should have to face in a thousand lifetimes. Sammy doesn’t know about those horrors, though. Sammy can believe in good and evil, free of the evidence that proves one far outweighs the other.
Cas gave the rope another tap, as if reminding Dean that it was there and what his job was. “At your signal, pull it,” Dean clarified. Cas nodded, sucking in a shaky breath as he made his way over to another marker on the floor; this one a good 10 feet away from Dean and about 4 feet in front of one of the white plasterboards.
Castiel Winchester
He’d seen them all coming, even if he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was about to hit him between the eyes.
He couldn’t help it; Dean raised a hand to his mouth and laughed.
“He’s out of town for some business in Long Island for three weeks, but when he returns, I told him I have a luxury evening planned for him. Thursday, when he returns.”
“Aw, thanks so much, Ja—”
Dean threw a cheeky raised eyebrow up, winking at Castiel. “Nervous to commune with us bohemian peasants, princess?”
even though he knew he could recite every lyric if his brain wasn’t currently fried. Maybe he was suffering from heat stroke.
“Sit there and look pretty,” Hannah replied back, teasing him with a wink. She turned away from them and beamed at Sam when he opened the door for her.
“Mom, I—”
“NO!” Castiel shrieked, kicking out and trying futility to rescue his daughter. “Please!
“Not God,” she whispered, reaching forward, dragging her hand over his jawline. Her fingers brushed down his neck and chest like a whisper.  She paused over his heart, then slowly began unbuttoned his shirt. “Just an angel.”
“That’s a terrible thing to say,” Castiel replied quietly, shaking his head. “It’s a lottery, Daph. It could be anyone. And…if I’m not working, if we don’t have access to my accounts,
Castiel wasn’t sure where the hell this had come from, but he immediately reached over his shoulder and tugged his shirt over his head, not caring to take it off completely. The shirt bunched across his chest, his arms still in the arm holes, and his hair became even more of a mussed mess than usual.
Castiel spun on the spot, pausing to pose for Dean, who stared at her with stars in his eyes. She was just like he’d always imagined the angel in his dream. Charlie really had nailed it.
Castiel focused on not crashing the car, though it was tempting to stare at Dean all day. “Nothing.”
In response, Castiel pressed his forehead to the glass and released a keening, choked noise from his throat as he came, come spilling over his knuckles as he twisted his cock to the rhythm of Dean’s thrusts. His prostate sent sharp waves of hot pleasure to the base of his cock, shooting another streak of come across the touch-screen and over Castiel’s fingers. Behind him, Dean released a shuddering breath and Castiel felt his thighs shaking against his. Inside his ass, Dean came heavily, come filling him almost endlessly as Dean’s thrusts slowed.
what they have planned for Dean, and I know that you have begun to express emotions, Castiel. I can hear the whispers of our kind, and they are starting to perceive your lack of conviction. You were not demoted because you're full of faith, sister. You were demoted because of your attachment to Dean. You were demoted because you feel—"
Dean’s grin did something wibbly and strange to Castiel’s knees. His fist curled around the side of the copier; he knew he looked tired, leaning on the thing, but what he was actually feeling was—yes, a healthy dose of overworked and overtired, but also the rush of blood to his groin as he remembered having to rub red lipstick off his mouth and jaw once he’d returned home.
“They’ll kill you when they find out you helped,” Dean said, following Hannah down a flight of steps.
“Dean says it works,” Castiel piped up, her voice calm, her tone warm. She continued to stare at Dean and he wasn’t even sure she’d looked down at herself yet. “I trust him.”
Against her will, her body arched forward the slightest bit, her nipples brushing the material of his suspenders and Castiel felt a warm, pleasurable tightening between her legs at the feeling of her nipples hardening. The way he was kissing her didn’t help either, with low rumblings in his throat that vibrated against her lips, and hands so warm and gentle on her skin. His tongue brushed against her lips, nudging forward into her mouth. While she wanted to play hard to get, while she wanted to pretend she was doing this poor boy a favour by entertaining his offer, she couldn’t very well pretend to herself that he wasn’t stunning and that the mere thought of his cock inside her didn’t make her hot and wet instantly.
His face cooling down significantly, Castiel nodded and focused on linking sounds together into words that weren’t entirely inappropriate. “Yes. An audit happened recently. It took a month of preparation! Then they were only here for two days, and now we’re just gathering further information they’ve requested. Papers on terminations. They’d like all the archived documents from last names S-to-Z by Monday and...I…” He looked over at Dean, who was staring into his eyes, looking far away. “I’m boring you, aren’t I?”
As he skidded to a skip, the young man’s hazel eyes widened at the gravesite and his lips trembled. “I missed it. I-I missed it. He’s—”
Dean didn’t follow initially, his mind spinning. They’d
Energized by a rumbling, dark energy and overcome with lust, Dean growled and pulled Cas close for only a moment before he pushed up using his thighs and twisted them both around, falling forward until Cas’ back hit the floor and Dean was on top of him, kneeled between Cas’ legs. He yanked his own shirt up over his head and threw it aside, wanting, yearning, desiring skin-to-skin contact.
“R-Right,” Daphne choked out, dropping quickly to her knees to click the restraints around his ankles.
“NOOO!” Naomi shrieked, raising a palm and blasting Uriel across the room.
“It is stupid to love a woman who sells herself, Dean. It isn’t me who will get hurt.” She looked up at the horizon, now a dark purple, the only thing left of the sun was a sliver of orange glow. It reflected in her eyes, dark under thick lashes, glittering like the water’s surface. “I have responsibilities to the duke. I cannot be distracted, by my hurt or yours.” She looked over at him finally, her brows furrowed. “Can’t you see I’m trying to help you?”
“Jamie, please don’t do whatever you think you want to do. I’m coming over. God, please, Jamie, just hang tight—”
“Look at
Sam’s cheeks dimpled as he smiled and nodded. “Yeah, we are. I’m really sorry, Cas. I feel like an ass. I thought you knew—”
the final seal. Dean, please call me back. I need your help, the angels have me in some kind of holding room and—”
But Castiel was not anyone. He was anything but typical.
The Duke backed away, and the moment their skin lost contact, Castiel jumped to life, scrambling across the bed. Sam was there instantly, pulling her to her feet as Dean rounded the bed, his eyes boring into the Duke’s.
The house lights dropped abruptly, and Dean and Sam exchanged impressed, excited looks as the lights in room flashed and swiveled around, illuminating the crowd in rainbow colours, strobing. The lights turned back onto the angels, and the crowd cheered.
Uriel rolled his eyes, pursing his lips and returning his gaze to their company function. “Read receipts. Fuckin’ read receipts. Come on, Castiel. When was the last time you clicked ‘yes’ on a read receipt? Everyone knows it’s a passive aggressive way to say ‘you can’t be trusted to do shit without a prompt’. You can run but you can’t hide, bitches.”
“Yeah,” Dean grinned. “Yes, it will be. SAM, NOW!”
“How we supposed to do that if I’m puking my guts out and I’m gonna start seeing spooky crap any minute now?” Dean yelled from the bathroom, face still turned downwards in case surprise ghosty-vomit wanted to exorcise itself from his body.
“Take at least two babies from me, for the love of God,” Dean groaned at his brother. “I have a head injury and I kinda feel like I’m gonna pass out with all this extra weight.”
It was like Castiel hadn’t heard. He continued to stare at his dead child, his fingers brushing brown hair from his lifeless blue eyes. Dean wondered how Castiel hadn’t caught on earlier; the blue was uncanny.
“Yes,” Dean nodded, purposely leaving out the fact that he had a massive crush on her. His eyes darted around the room. “Although a bit of warning would have been appreciated. My place is a disaster. It-It doesn’t always look like this—”
Holy shit. Castiel was asking him if he ate pussy.
Dean took a moment to put out his cigarette in an ashtray beside his bed, but then he rolled onto his side, curling into Cas, nuzzling his face into her neck, lifting his face only to place a gentle, quick kiss against her cheek. Into the skin there, he said, “We have a lot of time together to discover our baggage. You’re doing a bad job of convincing me you’re undeserving of my gross, mushy feelings.”
Dean snorted. “I have limited uses for a breast pump, Cas. That one is all you.”
What the hell did someone say to that? Dean’s mouth gaped for a second, then he said with vigor, his eyes narrowing, “Fuck powers, Cas. You got other stuff that matters. I’m gonna say it again; people who love you will love you without powers.”
, he decided after a few minutes of slow, careful fucking. As his pleasure grew, as he adjusted to the feeling of being penetrated, suddenly he wished for Dean to stop being so considerate. Every time he almost completely pulled out, the thick head of his cock stretching that first tight ring of muscle just enough, Castiel found himself pushing back onto it, wanting to be filled again, wanted to be stretched and fucked, and for Dean to brush that spot again that made his cock jump and a moan tumble off his lips.
“You,” Castiel admitted, walking back out into the open. He slid his hands into his pockets and finally approached the counter, leaning on it and wincing. “She’s jealous of you.”
Dean stepped towards her, dragging his teeth over his bottom lip. With piercing, concentrated eyes, he stared at her and reached out, hands cupping either side of her face.
do up her hoodie.
“Promised to leave us be,” Balthazar interrupted, speaking over her, his eyes resigned and mournful. “He’s sworn to Naomi he will continue to fund the show if you go to him tomorrow night. If you sleep with him tomorrow, he’s promised to hold up his end of the arrangement.”
And then, with one last mantra of
“Not funny,” Sam replied, glancing over his shoulder as he led Dean under the stairs, towards a heavy iron door Dean hadn’t ever noticed before. “He’s just worried, Dean. We’re all worried. You seem fine but, well, you were gone for 6 months down there. I—We—can’t imagine what you’ve gone through. Six whole months,” Sam breathed, shaking his head as he lugged open the big door and gestured for Dean to go inside. “Honestly, I think we’re surprised you’re not more...um…”
“You’re an ass,” she clipped before pushing past him into the room.
“Use your angel vision or something, Jesus-fuckin-Chr—”
“Tweak the line?” Metatron said, rounding on Dean and sounding perplexed. “But why?”
A string of words got lost as Ashley’s voice got so high and tight that she couldn’t enunciate.
“My apologies,” Castiel muttered, raising a hand to futz with his hair—a nervous tick. “I didn’t mean—”
“Or the garters?”
“No way,” Dean huffed, hovering the bottle near his lips. “He’d ask too many questions. He’d worry, and I mean, he already thinks I’m fucked up with the demon blood. You think he wouldn’t tie me up and throw me into the panic room if he knew what we were up to? No offence, Cas, but he’d think you were tryna trick me or something.”
“If we can hit up a Taco Bell,” Jamie said with a laugh in her voice, “then I’ll tell you whatever you want, Dean. Just warning you, though, I’m an oversharer, I haven’t been able to talk much over the last year, and this is a long one.”
It took everything in Dean to not stomp his foot like an angry toddler. “We don’t have time for Monday. Open this door.”
Castiel stepped out into the living room and caught Dean staring at the ground between his bow legs. He was sitting on the arm rest, his hands limp between his thighs.
“Okay, okay,” Dean replied, pulling away and leaning over to yank a baby wipe out of a lumpy package on the counter. He wiped Cas’ face with it and shook his head. “That’s enough of the pity party, Cas. You did not murder our girl just because you went out into the word where
“I’m sorry,” Dean rasped, feeling his eyes stinging for a reason that existed in a memory he couldn’t reach. “I don’t remember.”
While his heart slammed in his chest and his hands had come up to grasp his attacker’s arm—in what would be the beginning of a move to flip them on their asses—Dean relaxed. Right. He probably shouldn’t be talking about getting his fix of angel blood over angel radio, where the frequencies didn’t just go to Cas. His heart actually squeezed in a spike of fear as he imagined that message getting to Uriel.
He spent the morning writing, trying not to let his envy bleed onto the page and taint his words. He made copies of the script for the rehearsal, and eventually, gathered his things. Rehearsal would start in a couple of hours, so he wanted to be there to set up and see if Ellen felt like serving him breakfast at the bar. He needed something in his stomach if he was going to smile and look at Cas without feeling nauseous over her night with the mayor.
“Can you believe that?” Dean groused, following Sam into the damp, cool space. “He’s treating me like an emo princess. Sure, I’m a bit stiff ‘cause I was crammed into a box for a while there, but rigor mortis will do that to a guy, y’know?”
“I have done everything you’ve asked,” Dean continued, frustration bubbling in his chest. “I drank your blood, and I am
” he asked sourly, leaning away from her as she sat on the couch beside him, leaning back and draping her arm across the back of the couch.
For a while he stared at the ground where she’d stood, confused by the rushing fear through his veins, and the uncontrollable anger he felt ramming around in his chest like it was trying to escape. Only after minutes of turbulent emotion did he realise he was staring at the ground, and staring right into a shimmering droplet of blood. It still shone brilliantly even in such a small amount. The bead of crimson had one singular streak of grace, glimmering in the moonlight shining through a narrow gap in his curtains.
They turned into the bar, the jazz music and frantic chatter of the bar staff preparing for the cabaret night assaulting their ears.
. This was how breakups began on TV. Castiel regretted putting so much on his plate and drowning it in sauce, because he suddenly couldn't bear the thought of eating it. He felt sick. His appetite disappeared in a puff of smoke. Pushing it away, he shuffled a few inches back from Dean on the rug and asked tightly, “Oh?”
Cas glanced up at him, then nodded, pulling her gaze back down to her tiny daughter.
Naomi smirked, her eyes glittering. “I find your lack of investment in Heaven’s rebuilding quite offensive. It is an
Together, they breathed.
“You’re on thin ice, demon,” Amelia muttered as Jimmy led her from the table and tugged her into the crowd towards the bar.
funny. And the answer is Cool Ranch Doritos, Cas. They are the best, seriously. I think they’re at the bottom there, if you dig past Sam’s dumb saltless pretzels.” He watched her, glancing over when he had a chance to remove his eyes from the road. “What’s with the determination to get to know me?”
“You sure? I mean, if you’re car sick, you should really ride up front, man. I don’t want you being sick all over the back…” But Dean trailed off when Castiel grabbed his cold trench coat from the seat beside him and bundled it up, propping it up against the window and resting his head on it.
Despite himself, Castiel caved and reached up, dragging his fingers through wet hair, carefully tucking an errant tuft behind Dean’s ear. “You don’t have to talk if you’re not ready.”
Cas seemed to buy it. She nodded shortly and asked, “Will you tell Sam?”
“How dare you?!” she cried, turning on the Duke.
“Yes,” he ground through his teeth, voice rough and pained. His abdomen squeezed in response, sending a burn through his muscles that was almost unbearable.
That was, unfortunately, a big downside to working from home; people skills. And more specifically, the lack of people. It was a double edged sword; Castiel had no people skills, and therefore had anxiety about talking to people, but because he didn’t talk to people, he had no people skills. He wanted friends, company—and if he dared to dream, even a companion—but the thought of having to interact his way into those relationships terrified him.
“He basically half-raised us,” Sam added, taking a drag right from the bottle. “He used to own a pub in the local village near the estate our father worked for. When our father would go on long trips with the lord and lady, we’d stay with Bobby.”
Daphne, Castiel’s ex, stood there with a big, heavy looking rifle in her trembling hands. Her eyes were squeezed shut. When she opened her eyes, big, blue, and full of fear, she whispered, “Did I get her?”
“I’m so sorry, Cas. I’m so fucking sorry,” Dean whispered, his breath tickling the patch of skin between Castiel’s neck and shoulders.
Sam smiled. “Dad’s favourite.”
“Ignore him,” Sam muttered to Chuck. “Listen, what else have you seen? Anything to help us out with what’s going on with the angels? They don’t tell us much.”
What a shame.
A nod. “Yes.”
Dean smirked as he yanked the rubber ducky shower curtain aside to find a bottle of lube already opened and used. He tossed it in the air and caught it, turning back towards the bedroom. “Explains the excessive showering.”
“So if you’d repopulate amongst yourselves, didn’t that make you all kind of related?” Dean challenged, a sick part of him enjoying the way Castiel and Hannah had squirmed earlier.
“Oh yeah,” Jack confirmed, standing up straight and looking around at the men who were almost circling him at this point. “She came to me in the Empty. She said I was missed, that her family wanted to come home to see me. She said I deserved to be saved, so...”
Something was going to go very wrong, he could sense it.
“And now you’re here,” Dean replied quietly with a slow nod.
Punching in the number to reach Sam was tricky as his fingers trembled, but once it began ringing, Dean ducked down under the desk, shuffling back on his butt, until he was mostly under the shelter of the desk.
“You know what? Just forget it.” Amelia ran her sleeve under her nose and closed the door behind her. Through the panes of glass beside the door, Jamie saw Amelia ascend the steps, no doubt to go after Claire.
Cas tilted his head a bit at Dean and asked, “Are you sure you’re not pregnant?”
, Gadreel,” Castiel went on, his eyes alight. “
Settled by the note, the tension in his shoulders drained away and the heavy stones in his stomach disappeared, leaving him hungry again. With renewed energy and a better mood, Castiel made breakfast, all the while smiling at his scrambled eggs and recalling the significant night he’d spent with Dean. There’d been a number of heavy, stressful moments during their time together yesterday, but there was absolutely no doubt that they were stronger and better for it, and that their bond was solidified.
Andi curled his finger over his shoulder as he walked into the hallway. “Come with me and I’ll show you.”
“Billie?” Sam asked, brows shooting up onto his forehead.
Sam’s face softened and he smiled. “Secret’s safe with me, Dean. And...you’re not a monster. Thirty years is a long time to be tortured, day-in and day-out. You lasted longer than anyone could’ve. I...don’t know if I would have lasted that long, Dean. I mean, I know you think you’re this terrible person, but you were in Hell.
Gadreel.
he repeated, gesturing over to Sam. “Sam’s her favourite. He’s the chosen one and stuff.”
“I know,” Naomi admitted, licking at her lips and raising a hand to tuck hair behind her ear. Raising her round blue eyes, she winced. “I know that. I knew that. I...know. It’s just—” He watched her take a heavy breath, her shoulders raising, before they dropped like weights had rolled off of them and thudded to the ground.
With a little tug, Dean jerked his arm out of his brother’s grasp. “I heard, I heard. Can’t I just talk to her, though? I want to apologize for the mix up earlier and thank her for the job.”
there was also the scene of copper—sharp, fresh. The handprint was still hot and wet on his shoulder—
No one asked him to speak and he didn't fucking want to, but he opened his mouth to try and get a breath; he couldn't breathe, couldn't think—
“Yeah, well, you kinda needed saving,” Dean replied. “Dunno if you know much about Alastair, but he’s the worst of the worst.”
“I can’t tell if that’s spleen juice or lipstick.”
Despite the fog in her brain, Castiel felt a spark of inspiration. She licked her dry, cool lips and croaked, “This is the issue with angels.”
He wore them around the bunker; a secret to all but him under his jeans or sweatpants. He wore them in bed. He stole a few more pairs just to mix it up a little, get a bit of variety. He got more comfortable with the idea, especially with how Cas reacted every damn time he saw him in them.
Until he manages to wake himself up, fingers clawing the sheets out of their haphazard motel corners, breath coming hard and fast. Glancing across to the other bed, he finds it empty. Sam’s gone. That’s been happening a lot lately. He doesn’t like Sam seeing him like this. But he likes being able to see Sam when he’s like this. It’s one of the few things to chase away the fire and brimstone.
Dean tried not to get stuck on Cas comparing this situation to a dating show, instead focusing on the issue at hand. “OK, I can understand that, I think. Well, I mean shit, Cas, it doesn’t matter, it was just a-“
Dean shook his head, pushing himself to his feet. He mentally patted himself on the back for not swaying. “I’m fine. Fill me in on the way there.”
Touché. “You could have asked Sam for help.” The moment it came out of his mouth, something soured in his stomach. The bristling of invisible feathers and a pinching of Cas’s face told him that the sentiment, whatever it was, was shared.
“Hey Cas, I was just- Oh.” Sam blinked as he noticed Dean perched on Cas’s bed. Then the lights around the room. “Everything...OK?” he asked, crease furrowing his brow.
– they do exist.
“I like how you scoff at the monsters in horror movies but marvel at the practical effects. I like when you quote lines along with the characters under your breath and then deny that you’re doing it. I like that you always know the perfect film for the mood I am in. I-I like when we both reach for the popcorn bowl at the same time and...and our fingers brush...”
Dean tried to pretend that he’d almost forgotten about the request in the first place when it was actually at the forefront of his mind every time he spotted Cas approach him.
But, not too long passed before the chill started to settle in and he knew he was going to have to get up and put some clothes on. At the first attempt at movement, he froze, body going rigid.
He still can’t shake the memories or chase away every nightmare. But the smell of sulphur fades away. The ash in his mouth dissipates. The grime of the pit that has clung to his skin since he dug himself out of his own grave finally gets scrubbed away.
“Not here,” Cas said, shaking his head. “It has taken some...preparation.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Not really,” he admitted. “But I’m not about to go to the movies on my own like some sad sack.”
And they’d all be put into a suitcase, along with every trace of Cas in the bunker, and Dean would just be left with a cold, empty room. No fairy lights, no candles, no fucking Led Zeppelin.
“What did you want to see?” Cas asked, looking at the posters.
From the way Cas had stared at him, he was clearly on the same wavelength. But Dean made them both wait. Because he had a plan forming.
But right here, right now, he was more than happy to just let them both drift on the endorphins for a little while. To enjoy the little tremors that zinged through him whenever Cas’s tongue moved in his mouth, not deliberately teasing but just adjusting.
He was stunning.
Dean flashed him a grin that was only 70% bravado. “It was about the spontaneity. And getting away from people being a pain in my ass,” he added, glaring at his brother. Sam just stuck his tongue out like the child he wasn’t. Darting a look back at the slightly panicked look on Cas’s face made him soften. “I mean, we don’t gotta right now. We could-“
They stood in silent contemplation for several minutes before Dean couldn’t contain himself any more. “Is this insane?” he asked, voice tight.
Dean let out a breathless laugh. “There you are,” he whispered.
“Catfish?”
“Because I love you,” Cas said, as if it were the most obvious answer in the world.
Which was how he knew that, once again, Cas was keeping something from him.
Dean lets out a shuddering breath, finally turning around to see the earnestness in those blue eyes. “Yeah?” he chokes out.
This body is a fucking supernova.
A handprint. Dean’s handprint. Etched deep into the granite. His mark and his claim. The way he’d never been able to leave on the man himself. His hand itched to place it there now but he refrained. Couldn’t bring himself to when Sam was standing next to him.
“Never much cared for it. Why, do
get nostalgic? Missing those motel rooms already?” There’s no real bite to the words, not like there might have been years ago.
At least he’d stopped getting hangovers. Trick was to keep drinking.
Unbelievably, he did look apologetic. Idiot. Dean pressed in for a quick peck on the lips to wipe that expression away. “I already told you. Never cared for nostalgia, anyways. What I got right here, right now? Doesn’t even compare.”
Cas shook his head, frowning again. “No, I don’t like
“What do you mean?”
Does he regret it? No. Would he do it again? In a heartbeat. Does he want to go?
“Hey,” Dean said, struck dumb by the look on his face.
He’d chosen Dean’s favourite song. He’d chosen Ramble On because it was his favourite, not because it was about leaving. Cas wasn’t leaving. He had Dean’s shirts because he wore them in bed. He had Dean’s DVDs because he wanted to know how to do a real romantic gesture. He bought him gifts at the farmers’ market and made him pancakes and burnt his bacon because...
“Sam,” Dean shot back, the severity of the word likely tampered by the redness of his eyes. “You drive,” he said, reaching into his jacket pocket to throw him the keys.
Dean’s brain.
Dean’s hips tried to buck up off the couch but Cas kept him pinned firmly in place. It was that that finally pushed him over the edge into oblivion. Cas groaned as Dean’s cock spasmed in the panties, painting the insides with come, his tongue chasing the flavour from the outside.
Cas let out a shaky smile. “I like to think they changed because of you.”
“No.”
“They wanted to know his last name.”
<<Is something wrong?>> Castiel asked, looking at Dean. Now Dean could see his eyes well, Castiel’s eyes seemed to shine like if his grace was entirely enclosed in them, blue like the universe full of stars.
No, Dean didn’t have doubts anymore.
<<I don’t eat, Dean>> Castiel said as if it was obvious and really it was. Dean knew that Cass didn’t need to eat or sleep.
The first of the Winchester brothers was confused and shocked, he had never been in a situation like this. He had few choices, trust him then lowering the dagger or not trust him and attack him first before he could do it. However, there was something, a feeling, a voice that kept telling him that he could trust the boy. Dean kept his eyes locked to those of the boy while lowering his weapon, his eyes were so blue and deep like a lake. The boy didn’t move, he stayed in the same position, hand stretched towards him.
<< Well, it’s enough for me, I need a break, I’ll go to get some pie >> Dean stood up << Do you want anything? >> he asked, stretching his legs.
<<We will meet again>> he said it with confidence, almost as if he was reassuring him, like if it was a promise. The sound of his dad’s horn forced him to turn around again, Dean took some steps towards the gate then turned around again towards the boy. He would have wanted more time to understand, to find out who the boy was, he wasn’t human, that was clear, but he wasn’t even a demon, he couldn’t be. Dean wanted to know, he wanted to know how the unknown boy know him and Sam, why he seemed to know him despite he was sure to have never met him before. But his father was coming, it was like a countdown, Dean could hear the sound of the clock hands.
<< Are you ok? >> Sammy asked, frowning. He was wearing a white and blue squared shirt over a pair of jeans. He was looking at him with an amused look. << You seemed enchanted >> Sam said, giggling, a strand of hair covered his cheek.
Dean straightened his back, moving slightly away his hand from the dagger behind his back. The unknown boy did not move, he simply inclined his head and narrowed his eyes. He had a curious look like if he was trying to understand what Dean was doing. The boy didn’t look menacing but Dean had learned to not trust the appearances.
Dean lowered the dagger, he turned the weapon with the blade pointed to the floor. Without letting his guard down, he came closer to the boy and grabbed his hand. The black haired boy took it and squeezed it with surprisingly tenderness. Dean had the feeling he was holding back to squeezing more. He was afraid to hurt him?
<<At least tell me your…>> Dean started to ask while turning again towards the unknown boy, he thought to hear something like a flapping wings <<…name>> concluded with feeble voice. Dean’s eyes widened, he took some steps looking around, his arms open. He was gone, the weird and pretty evasive boy  was gone, no tracks. Dean had not heard him walking away, there weren’t prints on the wet floor full of leaves and mud.
He walked out to the extern suspended corridor of the motel, a gust of fresh and humid air hit him, making him shiver. The asphalt of the parking lot was wet for the rain of the past few hours and its smell filled the air. Dean reached the railing of the corridor with his hand in the pockets of his jacket. The Impala had been parked exactly in front of the room, the surface was covered of small drops of water that made it shine. It was a really beautiful car, in than moment Dean loved and hated it.
<<What do you mean?>> the hunter asked. Sam closed his book and raised his gaze to him, he was still sat on the chair.
It was the gate of an old and small park, the grass was wet for the rain and there were mud puddles everywhere. There were old wooden rocking games, an old horse and a pair of swings. The atmosphere was dark, the branches of the trees created a sort of blanket over the small humid park, the light filtered through the leaves in bundles.
<<You can trust>> he said, narrowing his eyes again. The young hunter had the feeling that the boy was trying to be friendly. It seemed like if he was following some instructions and he was looking at him to be sure that they were working. “Who are you?” Dean thought, keeping his eyes on him, green in blue.
<<Dean, are you ok?>> John asked worried, coming closer. His yellow boots almost sinking in the mud of the old small park, probably abandoned. The first of the Winchester brothers shook his head, trying to compose himself. Dean didn’t need his father believing him crazy.
They reached the car, Sam was waiting for them looking through the back window of the car. Dean knew his brother, he probably had been waiting in that position all the time. Dean smiled at him, he tried to smile reassuringly to tell his brother that everything was fine and that they would be together forever, all of them.
Dean walked out from the room while his father continued to scream. The last thing he saw was Sam’s sad face, Dean noted his little clenched fists on his knees. He had always been more sensitive than him and his father. Dean would have never turned his back to his brother, neither to his father despite all, the thought annoyed him but family before everything.
<<No, it’s not true>> Dean claimed, trying to sound confident without turning towards Sam, his brother was still sat on the chair and was looking at him with his blue-green eyes. Dean couldn’t say anything else that Castiel came closer, the angel stopped at the other side of the table.
<<So…>> started Dean, taking a step back, uncomfortable. It was strange for Dean feeling uncomfortable in that way, he had felt like this few times in his life, maybe never before now.
<<Yeah well, I usually do not meet nice people>> Dean explained, sure he could not tell him what kind of people he was referring. The boy seemed to be just curious but Dean’s instinct was telling him that he wasn’t just a simple curious guy. Anyway Dean had to, be careful.
Castiel’s hair seemed dark and soft feathers, his eyes were narrowed, Dean could barely see the blue of his irises in the shadow of the corner where he was. The hunter wondered how he could read in that darkness. Dean raised his eyebrows, he opened and closed his mouth, he had just realized something. The memory of that strange encounter had come back in mind suddenly, he believed to have forgotten it, instead it was in that part of his mind where he preserved his good memories. Despite all the unanswered questions, all the oddity he had classified it as a good memory and now he had that answers.
Dean looked, for a second, at his little brother; Sam turned his head alternately between him and their father, following their argument. His long waved hair swung with his movements. He sat on the edge of the second bed of the room, near to the bathroom. His legs covered by a pair of large jeans hung, to short for touching the pavement. He kept his little hands on his lap, the red plaid shirt he was wearing made him seem smaller. They did not have many years of difference but for Dean, Sam would always have been his little brother to protect.
<<Bullshit!>> Dean exclaimed then the boy raised his gaze on him.
<<Ok who the hell are you? And how do you know me and my brother?>> the young hunter asked defensive. Ok, he was done, he wanted answers right now and he would have got them, in a way or in the other. It was ok to being involved him but Sam, Sam no.
<<Are you ok?>> the question arrived suddenly, Dean’s heart stopped for a second, his muscles tense.
The boy without a name walked away, he approached the swings ans started to observe them, it seemed he was studying them, he stretched a hand to touch the surface of one of them.
<<Me?!>> Dean exclaimed, pointing at himself <<I need a friend?!>> the boy kept looking at the games, he observed them and touched them like with the swings, a curious look on his face. It seemed to not have never seen things like this before.
There was silence in the car, it was like if the argument had never happened, it was always like that. The gate of the small abandoned park appeared in front of Dean’s eyes, the branches of the trees came out of the fence creating shadows on the sidewalk outside. The car had almost passed it when he saw him again, the boy with black hair and shining blue eyes. He was outside the gate, he had his arms along his sides, he was looking at him, he was looking at the car while passing over. Dean leaned out against the window, he could see a light in the boy’s eyes. Dean rolled down immediately the window but when he took his gaze again towards the gate, the boy was gone
That’s why he didn’t fight it when Cas inevitably pulled him down onto the mattress and wrapped his arms around him. He cradled Dean against his chest like he was something
Dean watched the man he loved die at his feet and was helpless to stop it. Today he watched his brother get ripped apart by vampires and again was helpless to stop it. He couldn't keep doing this. He couldn't watch another person he cares about die. He needed to stop being so
Dean slowly opened his eyes, wavering green meeting endless blue. “I forgive you,” Cas said.
and how could anything else possibly matter?
until he was sweaty and sated and encircled by a pair of strong tanned arms holding him like everything was going to be okay somehow. Anything to make him forget the atomic bomb currently ticking down inside his subconscious.
Yeah. That was a look Dean could get used to.
“I highly doubt your beloved Daphne could do that.” Castiel told him with that subtle lilt to his voice, arching one perfect eyebrow as if daring Dean to say otherwise. Dean let out a breathy chuckle before leaning forward and kissing the angel on the lips, tasting the lingerings of his own salty bitterness on the angel’s tongue.
No date of birth. No date of death. The company had said it was unusual but Dean said there was nothing usual about the person it was for.
“There’s a pretty significant part of this nostalgia trip that I failed to mention,” Dean said, surprised by how low his voice came out.
“Cas...” he murmured against persistent lips, receiving a heartfelt moan in response.
Maybe Dad will find the yellow-eyed demon soon and he can start trying to forget all the things that lurk in the dark.
Dean was still standing on his mark. They both were. Why the hell were they both still standing so far apart? Without waiting a moment longer, Dean threw the rope on the ground as if it had just insulted his brother and stormed over to Cas where he could see tears glistening in his rapidly widening eyes.
Is this how it will be for the rest of his life? A fucking STD. Hell herpes. Carry it with you, pass it on! This rot inside, tainting everything he touches. The thought keeps him up at night.
After several emails back and forth over the course of a week, he’d finalised the details. Now they just had to figure out where to put it.
“Wanna help me pick one?”
would you get a room, jesus christ.”
“The one where people are pretending to be other people.”
Dean can’t help the humourless chuckle at that. “To be a
of belief – for years. Through more horrors, more death. He learns without a doubt that Hell is real. Then he buys himself a one-way ticket to stake out his own little plot of land below.
The very thought of it, the image as a whole, had Dean rattling towards orgasm at an alarming rate. Cas ran a gentle finger over his balls, pressed a knuckle against the strip of skin just behind them, forcing a whine out of Dean’s throat.
“It is blinding in its brilliance. I struggled to find a supernova that would do it justice. It was unnecessary, any would have done but... It is truly the soul of a righteous man.” Castiel frowns then, as if dissatisfied with his words. “The soul of a
Dean’s mouth dropped open. “What?”
Dean snorted before he could question whether Cas would be offended but his amused smile let him off the hook. “I admit, they made me self-conscious for a while. They are...strange. But I have grown fond of them.”
“I miss him, too,” Sam continued, talking to Dean’s rigid back. “But we need to start trying to move on.”
And he’s scared.
Cas frowned, brain visibly working to track back the conversation before widening in understanding. “My Question question?”
Dean bit his tongue on the retort that Cas brought him more than his fair share of comfort just being around. No need to embarrass himself immediately. Plenty of time for that.
Finally, Cas’s expression shifted. Into a careful blankness. “What?”
Tension shoots through him as he jerks onto his other side, flinching as he comes face to face with Castiel, perched on the edge of his bed. He’s regarding him with a tilt of his head, curious. Like Dean’s a new pet doing something unexpected. It sets Dean’s teeth on edge, but in a way, he welcomes the distraction.
The Righteous Man has been taken to the Pit.
It’s on one nondescript night in a nondescript motel after a nondescript hunt that the fear grips him in the middle of the night, shaking him mercilessly into wakefulness. He’s trembling, teeth chattering. The echoes of blood and fire and ash settle like a greasy film over his groggy brain. Grabbing his jacket, he sneaks out of the room to sit hunched and shaking in the Impala.
“The Batchelorette!”
“But he’s not missing, he’s...” One day he was going to be able to say it. To fully acknowledge it. Not today, though.
he’d said.
sake?”
Cas blinked his eyes open, pulling away with a frown. “What’s wrong?”
“I wanted you to be the first to see them like this,” was all Cas said in response and Dean wasn’t about to argue. If his foul mood at Gabriel’s comments had been any indication, the knowledge of Sam seeing Cas’s wings would have made him apoplectic. Probably best not to look at that too closely.
“Beautiful,” Cas muttered to himself. And then his hand moved away from his face to slide down to his ass, the lace rubbing against sensitive skin, making Dean shudder. Cas hummed, delighted, nose pressing against Dean’s cheek as he whispered into his ear. “You’re so beautiful.”
“Last name?”
Dean frowned. Something about the word ‘manipulation’ didn’t sit right with him. “It’s not gonna do anything bad to your wings, is it? You’re not gonna fuck with them just to make this happen?”
“Cas, please...gonna...”
Days after the Empty came for Castiel, Dean had gone into Cas’s room. He didn’t know why. Maybe to punish himself, maybe looking for comfort. Instead, all he was struck with was the lack of personality in the room. The lack of Cas. Everything in it – the clothes, the books, the records, the furniture – all of them were gifts or hand-me-downs. They were things he’d been given, nothing that he had claimed for himself. No memories to cling to.
“We could always go back to my house?” Chuck offered meekly from the backseat.
Dean snorted and threw Sam a look of disbelief. “Yeah, right. She sounds a little too high maintenance for me.”
“Poor people,” Kevin clarified before he disappeared through the door.
“Yeah, we usually do everything together. He offered to come, but I figured I should do this one on my own.”
“Mmmm,” Castiel responded, his lips stretching around Dean’s shaft as he bobbed his head down once before he popped off and asked hoarsely, “What?”
you’re Lucifer’s vessel, you’re the only one strong enough to stop him from rising. Perhaps you can save Sam from the responsibility. Perhaps...you can still redeem yourself.”
“Hot,” Dean chuckled. “I think she’s so hot.”
Their hips flush together, Dean’s cock was buried so deeply inside Castiel that he had trouble distinguishing where he started and Dean began. The last few pumps of come rumbled through Dean’s cock. Castiel’s own hand slowed. As they both caught their breath, Dean going soft inside Castiel’s ass, the vacuum across the hall sputtered and stopped.
Jamie raised her head and flashed him a smile that she knew just made her look like a big dopey, blubbery loser.
“Come on, man,” Winchester whispered near his ear as they limped out of the room. “Let’s get you back to the room.”
“Of course, I—” Then Dean paused. “Is tomorrow Saturday?”
Sam’s fingers fumbled as they tucked hair behind his ear rushedly. “No, really. Dean, about the role—I-I’d have to audition and get the job fairly.”
She licked her lips and choked out, “We can’t do that. We—”
“Something’s wrong,” Castiel wheezed, his fingers digging into his shirt, his eyes wide and wet. “I think I’m dying.”
That hadn’t been so bad. It was humiliating and nothing felt right about it, but they hadn’t hurt him. For some reason, he thought they would try to hurt him.
“We’re not,” Castiel admitted. “Before this weekend, it had been years since I saw her. Over ten years, to be more specific. But we were both only teens and our mothers forced us to bond. Hannah has recently been ‘disowned’, if you want to call it that. Disagreements about religion between her and her mother and... Never mind, I don’t wish to bore you, I’m sorry.”
Dean didn’t have time to care about them. A part of him was tempted, now knowing that Hannah had been on their side the entire time—who else was helping them?—but he rushed past Hannah and Alfie, who were both yelling at the freed men, instructing them on where to run.
Cas tilted his head, eyes narrowing. “You didn’t know…” Then, he took his weight off the doorframe and pointed over his shoulder, blinking the squint away. “Come in.”
“Nephilim?”
Castiel’s lips pursed for the briefest of moments, and her nostrils flared before she said boredly, “Regardless, your feelings on the matter are not of import. You were raised for a purpose.” And when she turned back to Sam, she tilted her chin up a bit, her voice going stern. “You both have a purpose that will come into play over the coming months. Prophecy demands your shared presence on Earth as events unfold."
It was Castiel’s turn to choke on his drink, some of it accidentally sputtering back into his glass. As Dean laughed, Castiel felt like turning on his heel, opening his fridge, pulling out the groceries and climbing in so he could die. And whilst dying, perhaps cool down a bit from the humiliation of being a big fucking loser.
“I have something to tell you,” Castiel breathed, inhaling sharply, more black-tinted tears running down her face. “Before you promise anything, I have to tell you about C—”
“Of me and Sam?” Dean asked in shock, revolted at the very mental image.
Sam sighed, turning the bible around to read Bobby’s notes in the margins. “The Witnesses rise… Sign of the...” Sam jerked his head up abruptly, staring at Bobby, “The Apocalypse? Bobby, you sure?”
The two fell back into silence, reading to themselves.
Castiel turned slowly, her gaze lingering on his face, looking broken. Then she turned away completely and walked down the sidewalk, pressing her lips to Leia’s head, her shoulders hunched.
“Bobby,” Sam murmured warningly, glancing quickly over at him. “Stop.”
” Dean leaned forward to punctuate their karaoke with a kiss on Castiel’s chin, and their feet bumped as their hips swished. “
“Heaven,” Castiel whispered. “I am an angel of the Lord, and I serve Heaven.”
They ducked back into the area backstage, as the crew and some angels rushed to move props and costumes out of the way. Sam scowled. “Wait, what? I thought you hated them together.”
“Harps?” Hael and Ben whispered to each other, not even trying to hide their eavesdropping.
Despite Dean's face twisting resentfully, Hannah continued, shrugging. Her kind blue eyes searched Dean's expression. “All we’ve ever known is Heaven. Love wasn’t something we ever considered within our reach. For years, Castiel was the one who always told me, ‘emotions, feelings, those are dangerous temptations’. Too many men broke her heart when she started dancing with us. Over time, it made her emotionless to men, to feelings."
Then, “Goodbye Dean.”
Jimmy tried to launch past George towards the landing when there was the noise of a gunshot downstairs, and a commotion. Amelia jerked her face towards the noise, and George clicked off the safety of his handgun.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
“Olivia?” Bobby’s voice lost its grouchy quality, and he sounded concerned. “You all right? Y’sound a little…”
A surge of horny anger shot down Cas’ spine and he pushed himself up onto his arms again, twisted his torso, and reached back to push Dean’s head back down, holding him in place and rolling his hips. If there was any concern in him that Dean didn’t like to be manhandled, it evaporated right then and there when Dean’s tongue was ready, sliding into Cas’ ass as he rolled his hips and fucked himself back on Dean’s face.
“Alone?!”
“Dad,” Dean breathed, his eyes wet, his cheeks tickled under tears that snaked down his cheeks. “I can’t believe it’s you.”
Dean went still and Castiel didn’t move either; he wanted the words to sink in, although apparently that didn’t require much time, because instantly Dean’s pale face got paler—almost entirely white like someone on the edge of passing out.
“You promised at least a couple orgasms,” Castiel replied, her one brow twitching upwards. “I expect them to be good. Only two people on this earth have managed to give me real pleasure, so the bar has been set high, Winchester.”
The iPhone’s logo appeared, disappeared, and re-appeared at an infuriatingly slow pace as it booted up. Jamie looked up, mist curling up around her face as she breathed out heavily, a definite shake to her following inhale.
Zachariah shrugged him off and threw his hands up, curling them into crunchy little fists at his waist. He was starting to turn a bit red. Dean worried his ugly little bald head might pop off.
“We’ve gotta get into Heaven,” Dean rasped, standing his ground. He felt traitorous tears stinging at his eyes. “We gotta save him.
The see-through blue dress she wore was so fitted to her torso it seemed painted on, and the diamonds in the material looked like it was glued to her skin. The neckline dipped low enough that it stopped only below her sternum, and the skirt cascaded down once it hit the top of her hips, dragging behind her in a long trail of fluttering silk. The most magnificent thing though, were the two large wings that were attached to her dress; big, towering out behind her, dark and sparkling like everything else about her. As she slowly walked out, one leg slipping out of the revealing, tall slit in the dress, the wings glided out behind her in twisted flutters of satin.
Her entire body frozen, having nothing to do with the blood loss and everything to do with the predatory leering from what she once used to call a friend. Uriel turned away and left the room, the clicking of his shoes against stone echoing in her heart, falling into rhythm with the firm, determined beating.
“Takes one to know one,” Dean retorted quickly, flashing Charlie a crooked smile.
He had some words for EllenOfOz.
Dean looked up from Castiel only to watch Cas walk down the hallway towards the sound of the small mewing and hiccups, ducking into a room off to the side, disappearing from sight.
“Come on,” Sam instructed, tapping Dean on the shoulder and gesturing to the pillows. “Time to sleep. You’ve had a rough day—”
Anna turned her head to look over her shoulder quickly and yelled, “Shut your eyes!”
His vision struggled to clear, the edges blurry. While his brain worked on getting that sorted, he was, however, immediately aware that his hands were tied together above him. They’d been tugged above his head so tightly that his arms felt sore in their sockets. The chafing around his wrists indicated that it was probably rope that tied him to…
“You wanna get fucked on the hood of this car by me, or not?”
care.”
“You won’t say that on opening night,” she whispered.
All the angels, they looked rugged and wild, but familiar.
Cas caught Dean’s eye as he tugged jeans over his hips, and his face split into a beaming smile. Dean returned the expression, his heart bursting into a million, joyous pieces, gratitude and contentment filling him entirely.
round,
Well, shit. Dean’s palms grew clammier and he slid his arms off the counter, wiping his hands on his pants. He had already been dreading talking to Castiel when he thought she was a perfectly personable, charming woman, but if she really was how Kevin was saying she was…
Cas tipped her head up, her fingers brushing his jawline. Her eyes watched his lips as she said, “Love.”
Sam did a double take, down at his script and amended quickly, “I mean, because it stings.” He frowned, turning to Metatron and breaking character. “‘Because it stings’? That doesn’t even make sense!”
After his night with Dean, he had an extra soft spot for the band Garbage. It’d taken days to get
The ashes on the tip of her cigarette coiled and drooped, neglected, as Meg panicked.
“No,” she growled, twisting onto all fours and struggling to her feet as the Duke stood behind her. On the other side of the bed, the door swung open and Raphael stood in the doorway, his eyes narrowed.
Gadreel’s entire body seemed to lose all fight and his mouth twisted bitterly, the blue of his eyes glittering. “When I was tricked into allowing the serpent into the garden, it had been a mistake. As I sat in my cell for millions of years, I mourned for the consequences of my gullibility, but I never believed myself to be evil. I never did until...untilI held you down and remained complicit to the brutality forced upon you weeks ago, friend. I...will never forgive myself.”
Dean jerked his head in a little nod and he averted his eyes to the floor. “Right. So we didn’t have a moment or connection or whatever, and you have no interest in letting me get to know you, and you definitely wouldn’t wonder what it would’ve been like to make love to me then?”
Ishim looked between all the other angels, and his shoulders sagged. With a grunt, he tucked in closer to his food and muttered, “I’d better shut up before an angel bullet ends up between my eyes.”
“I can’t believe you!” Charlie snapped, reaching across the table to punch Dean in the shoulder. “I told you not to try to sleep with her! Are you crazy? Are you
“They made me choose,” Dean said in a rush, his words tripping over themselves, trying to make their way to Anna, to beg for her forgiveness.
“Then you can have me while I have you,” Dean spoke against his mouth as he crawled up on top of Castiel, their legs slotting together and their foreheads brushing, soft hair tickling skin. “I’m yours, angel.”
Uriel surveyed him with the look of someone in way over his head as he rubbed at his forehead. “Man, this is not my news to break… You gotta go talk to Dean.”
He heard them talk about ‘the others’. The ‘humans’ who hadn’t carried their seed to term. They’d committed atrocities, and Castiel was ashamed to admit the scare-tactics were working. As the weeks went by, his resolve to escape grew weaker. As his nephil developed and grew, he felt less and less inclined to try to escape lest he hurt it, or worse, lest the angels tried to hurt it.
Dean thought desperately,
“If Sam won’t be home for a while,” Castiel replied happily, “I’m quite partial to the pizza man.”
Eventually, the giggles faded and silence blanketed over them as they stood together, wrapped around each other with no rush to untangle. Still, Dean wanted to see Cas’ face, see the smile he could feel pressed into his skin. He pulled back just enough, riding the high and kissing Cas on the cheek before he stared into his warm blue eyes.
“Don’t cry, Dean,” she said wetly, her tongue pushing blood over her lips, out of her mouth. Despite that, she choked a bit and Dean had to wrench her up into a seated position. She groaned in pain. “I’ll go to...Heaven, the real one. You and I, and Claire too, we’ll be...there together forever, one day. Like Celeste and Daniel. Our very own H-Heaven.”
Even though her heart pounded and her hand was shaking, Castiel looked triumphant, raising a heavy diamond bracelet into the air between them. It glittered brilliantly even in the dull candle-lit hallway, and was nearly two inches thick.
Dean snorted, exhaling through his nose. He diverted his gaze to the ground, eyeing Jack’s pristine sneakers. “What, they’ll kill me?”
Naomi cleared her throat, nudging him through two vendor stands, emerging onto the rock field. “Well, Garbage is on afterwards and I don’t want you to miss the first song.”
She didn’t want this. She didn’t want him, now or on opening night, nor did she want him afterward. The Duke was supposed to be just another client; perhaps more high profile, more public, more long-term, but if she’d known she had been essentially sold to him, Castiel wasn’t sure she would have agreed.
Kevin nudged Sam with his shoulder and smiled a bit, the expression tiny but sincere. “Just take the role, Sam. You’ll share the stage with a bunch of others who probably won’t have to audition either. In Heaven, survival is about who likes you best and how popular you are.” Kevin scratched the back of his neck and snorted, peering up at Sam. “Honestly, by bargaining to get the role, you’re probably on the most even of playing fields.”
The turkey sandwich got lodged somewhere in his chest and Dean gripped the edge of the plate in his hands. The cold that followed him from the grave settled deep in his bones once more, and the warmth from the fireplace in the next room or from Pam’s clammy hand disappeared
With a smirk, Castiel raised his hand and held Dean’s gaze as he slid the ring onto the his finger, looking proud of himself.
“Just gotta get used to not fearing for yer damn life all the time,” John said. “Y’don’t shake that off quick at first.”
It had been two days since Dean left without a word, two days since the sticky note had been left on Castiel’s coffee machine, and two days since he’d turned Sam’s phone off. It had been a day and a half since he’d turned his own phone off.
When the light faded, Naomi was standing over Hannah’s discarded corpse, watching the blood ooze out from under her stomach, smirking as her eyes followed Hannah’s wing marks across the floor and up the wall.
Cas nodded, dragging the back of his wrists over his eyes. His tongue flicked out to run over his bottom lip and he nodded again, more firmly, dropping his hands to his sides. “Right,” Cas said with a clearing of his throat. “You’re right.”
“You’re wrong,” she whispered. “I’m pathetic. F-For an angel to ride around in me? It would be wrong. I’m just...I’m nothing.”
He’d spent too long thinking he’d be Hell’s bitch, that he’d go Darkside, that he had no escape or redemption from being Azazel’s psychic kid. To say he wasn’t somewhat relieved by being important to Heaven would be a lie. He just wished that Dean supported him more, and that Dean would stop being so damn bitter about it.
Zachariah’s blade pressed into Anael’s throat, drawing fresh red blood to trickle down her neck, tangling in her equally fiery hair. “Watch your mouth, Red, or I’ll find a better use for it back in the jail cell we have waiting for you.”
“No!” Dean snapped, wrenching off his seat belt.
Oh... Oh, no.
The world seemed to stop. Castiel wasn’t sure if it was even raining anymore because all she could hear was Balthazar telling her there was no way out.
“Nah,” Dean replied quietly, crawling into bed. “I’ll be fine.”
“They made me drink this, um, stuff during the examination—”
through those dark, creepy woods was another one.
He took a minute to breath, and Dean was patient, unmoving, except for one calmingly, kneading hand on Castiel’s hips, the other rubbing circles into his back and neck. Before he knew what he was doing, as soon as he felt himself lose some tension in his core, Castiel had taken a deep breath and actually pushed himself back against Dean, slowly.
“Amen, Winchester.”
Even the fucking archangels were hanging out. Gabriel. Michael, wearing Adam. Balthazar. Gadreel. Hannah.
To their surprise, Uriel turned on Sam, who stood up straighter, his eyes wary. With his lip curled, Uriel said, “Samuel, remember that your purpose is to serve Heaven. The girl, Anna, she poses a threat to us. It’s your celestial duty to reveal her location.”
“Stevie Nicks,” Dean murmured. “Landslide?”
With a laugh, Dean reached forward and ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair, trying to fix it. “Dude, you look thoroughly fucked.”
Dean nodded, walking over and following Castiel into the kitchen. “Sure, what’d you got?”
be the type of freakin’ human to have a fireplace.
“Then can I join you for company?”
The fresh breeze blowing across Castiel and Daphne’s balcony had the opposite effect it should; Cas felt nauseous, sick from the overwhelming feeling of being trapped. Fresh air only made him feel sicker. He wanted to retreat inside to their apartment where everything was familiar and the world still sort of felt the same.
Dean | 4:48pm (September 31st, 2019): remember the serial killer from the bar? He sucks some mean dick so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“You guys’ll be fine!” Dean laughed as he accepted the Impala’s keys and gazed at them. “Look, I’ve been back from Hell for a day, cut me some slack. I want junk food, a stop by the liquor store, and a bit of alone time with Baby.”
The “bed” was a hard mat on the floor, right beside a singular toilet. No sink, no bunk to provide shelter from the light, and there was always a faint hum that drove him crazy. At one point Castiel had pulled his shirt over his head, plugged his ears with his fingers, and tried to sing under his breath to make the fucking humming go away. He prayed for sleep, and he wasn’t ashamed to admit that he cried more than a few times when sleep wouldn’t come.
While he had initially intended to follow Sam’s advice and walk home, Dean made it as far as across the park before he settled on a bench just outside of the jogging trail that ran through it. The strength of Sam’s reaction compiled with his interaction with Cas had Dean feeling a little breathless. As he settled down on the bench, his hands gripping the wooden behind under his knees, he felt stupid. He was being dramatic and silly, but he felt on the cusp of having a breakdown. How had this little hunt turned into a complete shitshow?
But Dean…
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sucked in a breath when Castiel slid onto the bench beside him and leaned in so that they were close.
Castiel shrugged. He felt small and vulnerable as her big blue eyes swept his features, watching them all slowly in turn. Still, despite  how his fear of her knowing his hallucinations made him feel vulnerable, weak, dirty… Her presence was calming.
Dean nodded and started to head towards the Impala, but then he stopped, patting at his jeans. His face drained of colour and he felt cold. “Shit. They’re inside, on the table. I—”
“And do what? Sam’s out and I could use a hand.”
“Fraid not,” Bobby sighed. “The stuff was growing inside them post-mortem. It wasn’t cute. I’ll send the pictures Pam send me.”
think that? You’re my best f—”
“No,” Castiel murmured, eyes tearing away from Dean’s face to stare at the hand hovering over his wrist.
“Anything else?” Sam asked.
“You should rest, Miss Grace,” Dean said quietly to her, somewhere above her head. “The, uh, doctor is going to care for you now.”
Cas was silent for a second, blue eyes scanning the page, then he nodded. “Yes, you can scroll.”
The front window flickered as the TV played on the other side of semi-transparent curtains.
for not only also betaing but for being a kick ass cheerleader. Also mega props for
"Yes, go," Castiel said wetly, sniffing hard and breathing through his mouth, a series of hitched sounds. "And leave your key. You won't be needing it anymore."
“Hey, man…” Dean murmured, fingers curling in plaid.
As a matter of fact, the puppy jumped off of Castiel’s lap, and a few minutes later, Dean had taken his place, his ass heavy on Castiel’s thighs, his legs bracketing his hips. Inspired and energized, Castiel ran his hands down Dean’s back and stomach when they weren’t tangled in his hair, and—
“Naomi,” he grunted, “I don’t think this is appropriate conversation. Dean isn’t here to defend himself—”
“I said
“You do not have a choice but to comply.”
Still, the scene was fresh in his mind. He’d been the one to write it, after all.
Dean snorted bitterly into the phone, his other hand gripped around the steering wheel. He looked out into the wet sideroad he was driving down, and narrowed his eyes. “Kinda sounds like a threat, Sam.”
“Oh?” he asked. He and Sam exchanged curious pouts.
Castiel sucked in a sharp breath. “
“You’ll have to be strong to kill her. Are you prepared to do what it takes to save the world?”
Big ol' thank you to my betas for this chapter: Wargurl83 & Beffi38!
The crowd stood and clapped as the angels all stayed locked in their poses of worship, Castiel standing in between Hannah and Meg, who had their arms around her, their faces on either side of hers.
Castiel’s eyes lit up, and immediately, he and Hannah exchanged a look that lingered.
Many thanks to Kradarua for betaing this chapter and being just a very lovely person in general. <3
remembers from Hell. And if he tries yet again to guilt you for your service to Heaven, to mock you for your prayers and faith? Ask him what he remembers from his ascent from Hell.”
have always believed in angels.”
“Hannah, what’s the problem?” she asked boredly.
, Sweater Vest.”
“No,” Dean said with a grunt. His hands squeaked across the steering wheel, and he threw her a resentful look. “Well, yeah, I guess maybe. We thought for years he was this psychic freak, that Hell wanted him. But now that I ended up being enough to satiate Hell’s thirst for a Winchester, Sam is the good guy and I’m the asshole. Heaven wants him, and he just eats it up. I think he so desperately wants to be good, to scrub himself clean of this black mark he thought he had on his soul, that he’s just blindly following the angels. No offense, Cas, but you winged dicks don't really give us a lot of backstory to the missions you have us going on. It’s a grind and the gear drop ain’t that good, y’know?”
Castiel breathed in deeply—Dean’s heart stopped.
So he just held onto the tissue box and his fingertips pressed to Dean’s knee, hoping they said
“Shit water,” Sam grumbled, rubbing at his head furiously with his sleeve, leaving an angry red patch in its wake. “Yes, I know.”
She spun around and her waves swung around her shoulders, swaying to a stop against her collarbone, cascading down her front so the ends brushed her waist. Dean immediately became particularly fond of one curl that framed the side of her face.
“He’s more than a friend, Sam. I..can’t leave here without him. I couldn’t leave here without him.”
“Well, happy early birthday then. You still feeling sick and achy?”
The boys looked at each other and smiled.
Cas sat down on the bench beside him, turned towards him. Dean understood the fear behind her eyes now.
“Promise, little brother.”
He couldn’t sing to save his life, but Castiel watched his lips anyway, captivated as Dean licked at them and continued to sing as strobe lights from the stage flared out over the crowd, dousing them in rays of magenta and red light.
While Dean’s voice was actually rather pleasant and the friendliness was a welcome contrast to the grunting and rejection of this morning, Castiel couldn’t very well talk back much with the sick churning in his stomach. He shifted his face into his pillow and blinked tiredly at Dean, feeling exhaustion pull at him.
“Yeah,” her brother, Jimmy, laughed. “Weird, right? One lion, one eagle, and then this face that kind of looked like a teletubby, now that I look back on it. Anyway, I remember it so clearly. Its name was Castiel, but I had that weird stutter when I was a kid so I ended up just calling it Casti-ti.”
A cruel smirk curled on Naomi’s face. “I’m going to enjoy watching you try.” With that, she turned on her heel, sliding her hat back onto her head. As she pushed past Balthazar, she said coolly, “Ensure she’s ready tomorrow for opening night, or I fulfill my promise, Balthazar.”
Sam nodded, but Dean saw the green of his jacket turning a dark brown at his shoulder. Hazel eyes followed Dean’s gaze and Sam admitted, “I got shoved against the house at some point. My graze from a few days ago opened again. I’ll be fine.” Sam hesitated. “How’s Cas? Is he…”
“September 18th?” Dean asked grimly, crossing his arms over his chest, a gesture that he hoped made him look
Castiel swallowed loudly, finally speaking. “Thank you.”
Uriel | 8:40 (October 20th, 2019): Naomi’s smiling more than usual (gross) and being all flirty and shit. It’s unnatural. Its SUPERnatural looool
“Your pleasure would matter to me,” he declared again, feeling a swell of bravery. “That kind of stuff…it always matters with me.”
, he pushed forward and entered his angel, the love of his life, and sunk in, one careful moment after another where he watched Cas’ back tense up, then relax, then shift again. It was only when his head lifted and tilted back, paired with a long, slow groan, did Dean bottom out and release his own held exhale, the sound trembling.
Sam, too, he noticed when he quickly glanced over.
"We’re not going to
They both dissolved into husky giggles when Castiel pinched his ass and growled, “I am
Dean cried out as Alastair punctuated his sentence with a burst of power shot out from an aggressive sweep of his arm. A force sent Dean flying back over the debris of broken pews, and he found himself panting as he tried to struggle to his feet. When he finally did, he saw that Alastair had turned his attentions back on Cas, who was crawling through her own blood to try and reach the angel blade a few mere feet from her, discarded on the ground.
“Awww,” Dean mocked, his chest rumbling with muffled laughter, “he’s so tired and existential.”
Dean lifted his head quickly and gestured over to the warding where they’d seen Cas earlier. “No, that’s the thing. There’s...there’s nothing. She’s just an angel. She’s a stranger, there isn’t anything there.”
<<Dean>> Sam’s voice sounded like an echo in his mind.
Dean thought and for a moment he seemed to see Castiel’s face mixing with those of that guy.
Dean was about to enter the corridor when he stopped, he turned around. Sam had stoop up and was explaining something to Castiel who was listening carefully, his arms along his sides as usual.
Dean crossed Sam’s eyes and felt a grip on his heart, his father continued to yell and for an instant, it seemed to him that the volume was turned lower. Sam’s green-grey eyes were glossy, he knew he was trying to not cry. John did not like when it happened, they were hunters, he always said, and hunters do not cry but they also were human, damn it! They were humans but John seemed to have forgotten it, it seemed to always forget it. Dean was so tired of it, in that moment seemed that the volume was turned higher, on a normal level.
<<Yeah>> he said, clearing his throat. Sam sat near him at the table, Dean saw him lowering his hand, a smile on his face.
Dean shook his head and moved like if he was electrocuted, he straightened his back on the chair. Dean moved away the book in front of him and turned to his brother.
<<You have been staring at Cass for over 15 minutes>> Sam explained and gestured with his head towards the other side of the room. Dean followed his indication and his gaze fell on Castiel. The angel was standing in front of another table, smaller than their but however full of books.
<<Damn!>> Dean screamed through clenched teeth, stepping on his feet with the result to spread mud everywhere, his legs included spotting his jeans.
<<Are you listening to me, kid? I’m your father and…>> John was saying, his face livid of anger. He was wearing a pair of old and faded jeans that in the light seemed green and a black t-shirt, his strong arms were full of scars, the same that Dean and Sam had. Sam, among them, was who shouldn’t have had them.
John Winchester looked his son up and down then took his gaze on the park around them cautious. John put an arm around Dean’s shoulders.
Now that eyes was staring at them while both of them were giving the worst of themselves, one against the other and this made Dean even angrier. He was so sorry for his little brother, he did not want him to see this, he had already seen too many awful things for his age.
<<Jesus!>> Dean sprang on his feet, before his brain had given the instruction. With his senses alerted, he took a hand behind his back where a dagger was hidden under his clothes. Dean touched the grip, ready to unsheathe if it had been necessary.
<<Ok>> Dean <<I’ll be back in a minute>>.
<<Have you seen something?>> John asked while Dean closed the window and adjusted on the seat.
<<You don’t really believe it>> he said sure. Dean couldn’t stop to feel uncomfortable under the stranger’s enquiring eyes. The boy seemed to know him but Dean was sure he had never met him before, he would have never forget such a weird person.
<<Are you sure to be ok?>> John asked looking Dean in the eyes.
<<You seems… defensive>> a question and an observation together. The boy straightened his head, it was like if he was studying him, his gestures, his reactions. Dean was surprised and confused at the same time, he bit his lips trying to relax a bit.
<<What?>> Dean asked confused <<Listen I …>> he took his hand again behind his back, near to the dagger. The black haired stranger seemed to catch his intention and came closer.
Dean kept his look outside the window, his hand under his chin, he felt his little brother moving near him. Sam’s hair tickled Dean’s shoulder while he was playing with the phone.
<<Ehi Dean>> a hand appeared in front of him.
It was more than an half an hour that they were yelling at each other, but more he yelled more his father didn’t listen, his throat was starting to burn for the effort and he felt his cheeks boils for the anger. He was angrier than ever before, at least as he could remember in that moment. The anger clouded his mind, usually alert and reactive. He would have wanted to destroy everything; he would wanted to destroy his father.
<<Dean>> John called, opening the gate that produced a metallic sound. John stopped when he saw Dean, he frowned.
<<Actually I come from the opposite place>> the stranger said, his intense and shining eyes in Dean’s. What did it mean? Opposite place? What opposite place?
Dean raised an eyebrow surprise, he came because he needed it? He opened his mouth to speak but he hadn’t the time because the weird boy spoke again.
They walked outside the park, the Impala was parked along the road with the wheels on the sidewalk. There was the sun that lightened up the sidewalk and the road, Dean was forced to half-closed his eyes for the change of brightness. The asphalt was drying, there were some little puddles around.
The unnamed boy stepped away again, something grabbed his attention. He approached the other games of the park and started to study them as he had done before with the swings. Dean followed him disoriented.
<<Yeah, I’ve got it, anyway you’ve found something more interesting to do>> Sam claimed amused, his hair swung a little when he turned again towards the book he was reading. Dean turned towards him, he frowned a bit confused and crossed his strong arms over his chest.
He had been walking for a while now with his head low and his eyes pointed to the ground. He had walked until few minutes ago, stepping on his feet, an imprecation at every step, with the wish to fight until he reached the center of the city, or at least he thought it was. The truth was that Dean did not have any idea where he was, that was the umpteenth unknown city where they had gone, one of the many cities. A city he did not know, where he did not know anyone and where he would have not known anyone. They did not stay for more than a couple of days, rarely a week, so Dean would have not had the time to get to know with someone. It would have been unuseful because anyway they should have gone away, like always.
Dean was still looking for the black haired and blue-eyed boy with a crumpled jacket when his father reached him.
<<Yeah, yeah, I’m fine>> Dean answered. He was fine, a bit confused. Surely he couldn’t tell his death what had happened, maybe John wouldn’t have considered him crazy, both of them had seen a lot of things in their lives but surely John would have became paranoid, he would have asked him too many questions and Dean wasn’t sure to be able to answer to all of them. No, John couldn’t know.
The black haired boy was looking at the gate when Dean turned around, he saw him slowing turning towards him. His hair was ruffed, some strands covered his forehead, he had his hands along his side. He spoke before Dean could say something.
<<Yes and you can go fuck yourself>> screamed Dean, interrupting him, with all his anger and frustration. He grabbed his jacket from the chair in front of the small table of the room under the window, making it swinging, and walked out.
<<And Sam>> he added. How did he know Sam? Dean took a step back alarmed.
He answered Dean’s question without looking at him, he started studying his hand after touching the wet swings.
he had said with confidence, like a promise, before disappearing. Now, Dean knew what was that sound he heard. He had come back like promised.
<<Dean>> always stronger.
<<No..nothing>> Dean answered, he tried to hide the disappointment that he strangely was feeling. He came back to look outside the window, the landscape flowed slowly, houses, trees, streetlamps, private gardens but Dean’s mind couldn’t stop thinking about him in that park.
Now, after years, he knew, he had understood who that weird boy with that intense look was, that boy who seemed to know him and understand him, who seemed so curious like a child.
He kick a half empty and dented beer can, hitting someone who was walking from the opposite direction. A maybe 50 years old man with a pale green shirt, a gilet and a hispid short beard. He seemed to be a sailor but there was not harbor there.
