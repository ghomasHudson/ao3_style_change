“--just because you thought it’d be a good idea to go out in the middle of a snowstorm without telling a single one of your fucking team members so that they wouldn’t panic and lose ten years of their fucking life looking for you--”
.” Steve’s voice is everywhere-- low and clear from the tower speakers-- and that’s when Pepper remembers Tony’s face when he’d told her that half the team had been called away on SHIELD business. “
“You,” Steve says, then slaps a hand over his mouth. He can hear the rest of the team still laughing, but can’t even look away from the bright, triumphant gleam in Tony’s eyes, or the mischievous quirk of his lips.
“Better let me go, then,” Tony taps Steve’s hand, and climbs off him with another wink. “And don’t look at me like that!”
“You underestimate me. I’ve been here since six,” a familiar voice says, and Tony hears the click of heels a second later as Pepper enters with a thick folder on her arm. “Figured I could try to get to you as soon as possible. It’s a bitch getting him out of his funk when you leave,” she smiles at Steve, who returns it with one of his own, that pleased, ‘aw shucks’ grin that Tony is an absolute goner for.
He doesn’t know how long he sits there, barely listening to the sounds of his team as they finish the battle, the sounds of SHIELD personnel as they dispatch a recovery vehicle for them.
“Hand it over, Bucko,” Tony’s voice comes back into range, soft but firm among the chaos around him.
“You didn’t think we would stay home, did you?” Natasha asks quietly. Her eyes are softer than Steve can remember them being in a long time, and he feels his chest grow warm with affection. “
“No, I didn’t plan this. Would’ve been a good idea, though, right? I’m not above doing something like that to keep you with me.”
He doesn’t even have to wonder who the culprit is. “This isn’t how I saw us spending Christmas,” he admits.
“Pretty sure I should be telling you that,” he says, but Steve shakes his head and shifts his grip on the steering wheel.
Civil Union Fest Prompt #22: “Have I entered an alternate universe or did you really just crack a smile?”
“Look,” she says, “the Board is starting to ask questions, Tony. I’m not telling you to stop-- though that wouldn’t be a bad idea, either--”
Tony laughs. "Shut up, you dork,” he rolls his eyes, and Steve returns his grin with one of his own.
Steve waits until Tony’s eyes are back on his. “We’re gonna have to talk with her about taking care of him.”
“Then smile!” Tony laughs, and the sight of that gorgeous, familiar curve to his lips sends a familiar pang of longing down to Steve’s stomach. “You’re so fucking cute when you’re grumpy, Jesus Christ.”
“Okay, moment officially over. Go on your disgusting little run and I’ll stay here like all the normal people and sleep until it’s not actually dark anymore.”
Beside him, Steve lets out a deep, long breath. “If my Ma doesn’t make French toast, I’ll make ‘em for ya myself, alright?”
When Halloween arrives, and he takes Bucky to school in the finest Hawkeye costume he’d put together-- Natasha managed to find a replica suit in Bucky’s exact size, and Clint delivered on his personal mission to find "the most kick-ass bow and arrow set worthy of our little superhero"-- Tony's waiting for them again, with a whistle of appreciation that makes Steve blush even though he knows it’s not meant for him.
Tony’s suit groans and creaks as he lifts his hands to his head, and despite the dust still floating around him, he gulps in a lungful of air when the faceplate comes off. He’s relieved at how easily he’s able to sit up, and grateful that he has space to move.
), there’s plenty of time where Steve’s bearing the brunt of the work-- he’s aware that Stark Industries business often requires Tony’s presence, and Steve doesn’t begrudge him the time he spends down in his workshop, either.
“I don’ like cwust!” Sam whines, almost smacking Barnes in the face as he waves the bread in his hand.
Steve’s flush deepens, and Tony forgets all about the fleeting brushes of remembrance he’d felt just minutes ago.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Tony scoffs, but he can feel the smile on his own face. “So what’s up, buttercup?“
“Milk!” Clint shouts from where they’re all sitting, slamming his plastic spoon on the table loudly. “
“Shut up,” Tony laughs, trying to ignore the unsettlingly cold fingers clutching his own. It only makes him rub his own a little harder, a little faster. “I don’t complain about your shitty pumpkin spice lattes or whatever.”
“Listen, he’s looked over here so many times, I’ve stopped counting,” Bucky says, smiling into the rim of his bottle as he takes a sip.
"An' even though we don't have mommies, you keep us safe an' you play with us and watch lotsa moobies with us, and you make macawoni all the time!"
“And this is probably really fucking unprofessional,” Tony continues, “but I’m totally using my robots to get a date.”
“Shut it. Just sit here and look pretty while we enjoy these babies-- here ya go, little miss,” he gives her the Santa hat cookie. “Feed, my child.”
“Hey, nobody told me he wasn’t actually in the ceiling,” Steve grins. “‘s just a habit now. You said it was cute the first time.”
"Didn't anyone debrief you on the way?" Bucky asks, because he's almost desperate to break the mood.
Y’know, I remember reading somewhere that you can tell a lot about a person by what kind of ice cream flavor they like best.
“I’m holding you to that, Captain,” Tony winks, before rising back to his feet. “But right now, all I want to do is spend the rest of my day with Little Miss Sunshine and Mr. Cat, so come on, chop chop.”
“You’re gonna make me say it again?” he asks with a smile of his own, because he figures it’s a good sign that he wasn’t shot down immediately.
“Trust fall exercises?” Tony asks, and yelps when Steve whacks his arm as they make their way into their bedroom. They part ways to go to their respective dressers, and if Tony holds off on pulling out his clothes to stare at Steve through the mirror– he’s still sated from their long, luxurious bout in their shower, but when Steve lets the ridiculously small towel fall from his hips, the flash of want that runs down Tony’s spine is no less strong– he doesn’t think anyone could ever blame him.
He has no idea how long they stay that way, chest to chest, but eventually they pull away for air with one last, quick peck, and when he rests his head on Steve’s shoulder, he can feel it heaving beneath him. “God... It’s so goddamn unfair,” he gasps, “that your lips are always so fucking
Tony’s heart skips a beat. “Don’t have to say anything, sunshine,” he replies softly, reaching out to tap the familiar numbers on Steve’s pec.
Steve has him pressed up against the wall before the door’s even closed. “I’ve missed you,” he whispers, lips brushing Tony’s jaw as his hands sneak beneath the suit jacket to caress Tony’s hips.
“Yes,” Steve’s nodding frantically, and the next moment, he sweeps Tony into his arms, closer and closer until their faces are buried into each other’s neck. “I love you, I do, so much, Tony. Oh my god, you beautiful, wonderful man.”
“Fuck you!” Tony yells, slapping at any part of Steve he can reach. “I’m average sized, you asshat. And just for that, I’m gonna build robot boots with jets and repulsors, and then I won’t need you. At all.”
SPOILER: Happy tells Peter that Tony sold Stark Tower and is moving upstate (presumably to the new Avengers facility).
Steve’s smile is boyish, and utterly charming. “Why should I? You’re gorgeous, baby,” he says, voice rough with sleep, and all Brooklyn.
“Not the reaction I usually get,” he manages to get out, eyes brighter than any sky Tony’s ever seen.
Half the class breaks into knowing whispers, and the other look his way with thinly veiled curiosity, but then they all go silent when Mr. Rogers appears at the window. He’s already grinning, and even though his eyes are quick to meet Tony’s, he still makes a show of swiping the note above the old one, tapping the glass, and walking away.
“Always, sweetheart,” he says, and can’t help the smile that settles on his face. “But you are still in the dog house.”
“I swear we watched that two fucking weeks ago,” Tony groans, but he looks more than content with his head nestled on Steve’s shoulder, so no one takes his words to heart.
“Okay,” Steve replies, and his brow takes a determined edge so familiar and adorable, that Tony can’t help but kiss his cheek before walking away to call the one person he knows will pull through for him.
“Back atcha, stud,” Tony winks, even with his face is still warm all over, and he lets out a quiet, shaky breath when Steve’s cheeks do the same moments later.
“Really?” Steve hums. “‘Cause I have it on very good authority that the great Tony Stark does have one or two things he’s a bit of a sucker for.” He tightens his hold on Tony’s waist until their chests are fully pressed together.
“Tony, I told you,” Steve points at him, “since you told me about this. You know..” his voice breaks, “you know I’ve been--”
“How does he even know this song?” Tony grumbles, but can’t keep the smile off his face at the sound of his friends’ happiness.
Their girl looks thoughtful for a few moments as she taps her little fingers against her chin, and it’s such a Tony thing to do, Steve can’t help but laugh into his tea cup. Finally, she looks back up at the two of them and nods. “I f’give you, Papa.”
“That makes two of us,” Tony says, and wonders if the thrill of those words will ever fade. “I’m not above flying over there to wherever the fuck you are--”
“Oh, really?” Steve grins. “Well, right back atcha, mister. Sometimes, I don’t know how I get anythin’ done around here.”
“Yeah!” Thor cheers from the other side of the room, with an excited hop that also works to help stick the balloon in his hand to the wall. Beside him, Banner gives them a thumbs-up and a sweet smile, and Pepper revels in the affection for this team that she feels bubbling in her chest like a warm blanket.
“No,” Tony shakes his head, scowling as the rest of their friends practically stuff their faces with pizza. “What happened to
“Well, guess what? He’s mine too, so I’m looking forward to hearing all about that,” Mr. Rogers keeps smiling as Peter toddles off, and then turns those baby blues on Tony as he straightens back up and holds out his hand. “Mr. Stark, I take it?”
“Um, I, uh, I meant--” he stutters, heartbeat echoing in his ears as Steve’s eyes-- ocean wide and absolutely perfect-- snap to his.
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me,” he says, and then winces when the wrench Tony’s holding falls to the floor with a loud clatter.
“Doesn’t mean I’m not gonna keep trying,” Steve says, and grabs a corner of the blanket Tony’s wearing to pull him in. “And next time I hear someone call you a…” he falters, like the simple act of saying them out loud is a crime, “a killer, or a– a warmonger, or any of that absolute
“What’s up?” he asks, and this time, the words are softer and quieter, as peaceful as he feels every time he sees the two people he loves most in the world.
. “You bet your sweet, gorgeous ass it is. But right now,” he steps up until he’s pressed against Steve’s chest, “I really wanna fucking kiss you.”
Tony doesn’t hesitate. “Me. I’ve got you, kiddo, don’t you worry your pretty little nose about it.” He bops said nose, and Steve’s tears disappear as he giggles into Tony’s neck.
“So he’s okay?” She turns to Steve, after a fond smile at the brunet. “Will I be able to take him home today?”
believe it. Steve’s always been an oblivious little punk, and you can’t see past the end of your nose most days, when it comes to all them pesky feelings. I got you pegged, though.”
“Stop shoutin’, Steve, I’m okay!” Barnes calls out, and Tony looks up just as the most beautiful man he’s ever seen walks into the waiting room, gorgeous arms crossing over a massive chest as turns a glare at him.
Steve nods. “Yep. And while we’re at it, we can get you a bike to go with it, mister, ‘cause no helmet of mine’s gonna look like that.”
“Yeah,” Tony whispers, running his eyes all over his daughter, just like he’s done a thousand times since she was first put in his arms. “Can I… I can hold her, right?”
“This doesn’t pay, Tony,” Steve chuckles, and Tony can only breathe through the familiar pang of longing at the sound.
“Can’t even fill a table. Mom--” Tony clears his throat, and Steve feels the sudden pinprick of tears at the faint echo of pain he can hear. “Mom said she’d try to make it, but... I wouldn’t bet on that.”
“Oh, I know,” Steve replies, sitting down beside Tony with a shy smile. “Still, I’m sorry about him. He’s an ass half the time.”
Steve spares a quick, wide-eyed glance at the box, then looks back up to meet Tony’s eyes. “I c-can... I can wait, if you, uh, really want me to?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve sighs, dabbing at his nose a second later. His hair is slightly sweaty and tousled from sleep, but he’s still the most beautiful man Tony’s ever seen.
“Yeah, they sure look jealous right about now,” Steve jerks his head towards the shore in the distance, towards their teammates enjoying the cool, clear water coming to the shore in waves. They’re not all there-- Buck and Sam are playing cards inside the beach house, and Wanda’s curled into a book across the patio-- but Steve still relishes the happy, comfortable feeling of having them all close.
,” she whispers, and she’s barely done talking when Tony staggers forward to sweep her up into his arms. fingers clenched tightly over the cards even as he presses his lips to Natasha’s curls, breathing loud and shaky.
Tony’s heart skips a beat. “Sap,” he mumbles, but he’s smiling so hard, his cheeks almost ache. “Remind me why we’re friends again?”
," he sees Tony nod. From her perch on his lap, Natasha snuggles further into him and lets out a contented little baby sigh when Tony presses a kiss to her curls. "You guys are..." He shakes his head, and very rarely has Steve seen him at such a loss for words.
“I’m not starin’,” he mumbles, and reluctantly drops his gaze to the flowers he’d been arranging in a vase.
“Yes, sir,” Steve brings a hand up in a lazy salute, then kisses the tips of his fingers and touches them to the screen. “Love you, sweetheart.”
“Tatiana,” Clint whispers. “It was an accident, shit, don’t let Nat find me, I swear I only looked away for a
Now, this is set BEFORE a lot of the action happens in the movie, so it’s not terribly spoiler-y, although it was inspired by the one, big Stark related storyline happening when the movie takes place (if you haven’t seen the movie, and don’t mind knowing ONE spoiler, read on. Also, I’ve put the spoiler at the end in case y’all wanna peek before you read).
Tony’s not the least bit surprised he’s been caught, so he just presses a kiss to Steve’s pec before resting his chin there. “I can’t help it,” he admits.
He’s the most stubborn human being I’ve ever met. But he’s also the best, y’know? I’d be an idiot not to do the same.
They’re both gasping when they pull away, and Tony lets out a pathetically happy little sigh when Steve rubs his nose against Tony’s in an eskimo kiss.
The next breath he takes has his shoulders heaving, and it takes everything in him to not fall to his knees. “I– where’s the… the team?”
“I can’t do this without you, don’t you know that?” Steve walks up to him, closer and closer, until Tony can see the trail of tears down his cheeks.  “I
“Need something, Cap? I’m kind of... busy,” he waves his hand weakly at the space around him, at the empty balcony and the cold, winter winds that’ve been seeping into his skin for God knows how long.
Steve’s bottom lip trembles as he tries to smile. His tired, red-rimmed eyes fill with tears that fall silently down his cheeks, and the sight of them hurts Tony like nothing ever has.
It doesn’t help that Bucky still talks about Pepper every day, only now he starts to mention how Tony’s been dropping her off a lot more these days, and how he’s always nice to Bucky when he sees him. He tells Steve about the
Steve feels a wicked grin settle on his face. “Let me remind you, then,” he growls, and pulls his husband in again.
He stays that way for what feels like hours, until he hears a soft hitch of breath, and then he looks up and oh god… there he is, alive and well, eyes big and blue and staring straight at him.
“Tony, you can’t– Tony, wait!” Pepper shouts, and then both of them wince when the baby wakes with a whimper that grows to a wail. “You can’t just leave, what about your daughter?”
“Okay, I completely walked into that one,” Steve says, burying his face in his hands. “But stop stallin’ and get on with it.”
Steve’s gasp is almost comical. “Oh–you really don’t– y’know what? Let me just… you shouldn’t be paying for this, you’re more than welcome to just
“Can I take you out sometime, then?” Tony smiles. “When you’ve got a free day and I’m not half dead?”
His husband’s smile is all sunshine and happiness, and so much like their daughter’s, it almost hurts. In the best possible way, of course. “Not even a little bit. Makes me fall a little more in love with you, actually.”
“I’d have been fine with just a room, y’know,” Steve continues, sliding the plate full of bread between them. “What am I supposed to do with all that space?”
“Babydoll, maybe you wanna come lie down next to me?” Steve asks her, mindful of Tony’s lungs, and the nasty cough he can hear rattling them.
“I know,” Steve says. “But the best things almost never are. That just makes ‘em all the more worth it, in the end, right?”
“Ha! Not so smug now, are ya?” Tony teases, sliding effortlessly across the ice in lazy swirls and graceful figure eights, and Steve finds himself suddenly holding his breath as moves inch by inch. He’s aware that most of his team is now looking his way, so he looks up from his skates to give them a friendly smile.
“Take me to bed and I’ll show you how much,” Tony says, and lets out a low, throaty laugh when the blond jumps up, throws him over his shoulder, and carries him from the room.
“No problem,” Mr. Rogers nods. “Now, Principal Fury told me you’d be sitting in for a little while this morning?”
“--and bringing you back myself. and honey bunny,” he brings the tablet up to his face, “if you think I can’t figure out where you are in a minute, you’ve been gone for too fucking long.”
“I hate you,” Tony says, but knows the smile on his face says otherwise, and by the time Steve’s pulling them this way and that, weaving in and out of the other smiling couples on the floor, he’s laughing like he hasn’t laughed in years. “I can’t– Steve,
“Auntie… I like the sound of that,” Pepper smiles, and when she doesn’t even look up at them, Tony can’t blame her in the slightest.
“You know I’d love to,” Steve replies, and hopes Tony hears every bit of truth in his words. Because he really would love to– he’d love to sit next to Tony on the plane, to have the brunet’s head on his shoulders like he does now, to see him exuding that genius and charm Steve loves so much. He’d love to sneak Tony away from his work for an afternoon and have lunch at some hole-in-the-wall restaurant no one would think of looking them in, both of them smiling when their fingers brush as they walk down an old, crowded street.
"Please?" Steve begs, tightening his hold, and just like that, something in Stark just seems to deflate.
“What does that even mean?” Steve steps closer. “Tony, you can’t keep putting yourself in the line of fire!”
“Come on, then,” he finally says, with more aplomb than he feels. “Let’s get this shit done. There’s a pizza from Marcelo’s with your name on it, sunshine.”
Stark sends him a stern glare, and goes back to stirring a pot steaming over the stove. “Kitchen’s off limits, Barnes. Didn’t read the memo?”
The wiggling stops immediately, and Steve puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders to steady himself. “Food?”
“No you’re not,” Tony rasps. His hands are shaking so hard, he’s surprised he hasn’t dropped the ring box. “Jesus, fuck.”
“I thought you already were,” Tony says, and doesn’t fight the smile at the happy sigh that leaves Steve’s lips.
“Merry Christmas,” he says, smiling at his husband, then presses his lips to his daughter’s cheek. “Best present right here, huh? Yes you are, princess, just the best.”
“I swear it was an accident,” Steve shrugs, and laughs as his Mario speeds past Tony’s Yoshi and through the finish line.
Steve nods around the faint wave of dread that comes over him at the question-- his studio’s going to be a mess, and he’ll be lucky to find it salvageable after. Still, he can’t find himself regretting his decision. “I sure do.”
"What the hell do we do? I miss it already," he says softly, turning to nuzzle as much of his face as he can into Steve's neck, food-- and cake-- forgotten for the moment.
“You’re my best friend,” is all Steve says, like it’s the only answer that matters, and Tony thinks he could cry from the sheer amount of love he feels for this boy.
The flirting doesn’t stop–- and Tony has absolutely no shame; some of the things he says leave Steve hot and hard, with a want so deep it leaves him breathless–- but it’s tempered by the soft smiles, the quiet laughs they share when they find each other in the laundry room at the same time, when they leave trails of bright sticky notes full of jokes and jabs on each other’s door.
“Was it attacking the city?” Steve asks. His shoulder brushes against Tony’s with every step, and it’s the only thing keeping Tony from full-blown panic.
“Only a couple, okay? I promise,” Steve buts his head softly against Tony’s in thanks. “Just to refresh my memory later.”
“Hey, you’re just in time,” he says, and the softness in his voice is the best thing Tony’s felt all day, like warm blankets and the memory of his mom’s voice as she said his name when he was little.
— he’s happy in a way he doesn't remember ever being. And even though he’s not a complete expert on Chemistry, that still makes him ten times more qualified than anyone else. He has seven doctorates for a reason— teaching a bunch of teenage punks is more than a little nice.
“Says the genius who queued up texts so that I would know how far away we were from each other every hour of your flight.”
“Open it,” Tony says, and Steve does, Tony can see the moment he realizes what’s inside, because he freezes so fast, it’s almost funny.
] I can’t imagine not talking about it with him. There’s no doubt in my mind that we’d be able to find common ground. Compromise is a big part of any relationship, and we’ve been through too much to let anything come between us. I owe it to him to listen, every single time.
“Your mother would kill us,” Tony laughs, and it’s more than a little wet, but Steve just pulls him into his arms, breathing in the scent of machinery and oil, sweat and metal, and underneath it all, the indescribable scent of Tony.
Tomorrow, there’ll be tests and debriefs and more visitors than either of them are going to want to see. But for now, there is only Tony, Steve, and a silence filled with pure, unbridled hope.
“Tasha!” Steve calls out, waving a hand frantically in front of her face like she could ever miss him.
“Is it?” The words are almost pleading now, and his blue eyes are still not dry, so Tony puts the plates on the coffee table and settles in further into the couch. Steve doesn’t smile, but he rests his head on Tony’s shoulder gently.
“Guess you’re done sleepin’,” Steve says, all sleepy smiles and sleep-tousled hair. There’s only the smallest sliver of blue peeking out from behind half-lidded eyes, and he’s without a doubt the most beautiful thing Tony’s ever seen.
It’s Steve’s turn to shrug. His smile is so bright, it should be illegal. “I think I’m entitled to a little smugness, considering the day I’ve had--”
Steve looks down thoughtfully, absently pressing his lips to golden, baby-soft hair, and Tony breathes out a sigh of content. He reaches out to tug at Steve’s belt loops, bringing him closer until they stand silently in the middle of the room, their daughter nestled comfortable between them.
Mr. Rogers raises an eyebrow in playful challenge. “I’ve got it covered, Tony, though I can’t imagine many saying no to him, with eyes like those,” he chuckles.
“Alright, Mr. Stark,” Sharon cuts in, patting Tony’s arm. “Good news is, it’s probably just a concussion--”
“Don’t call me Jim Jam, man,” Rhodey grumbles, but reaches up to get the bright pink bed at the top of a shelf. “It’s pink.”
“Don’t be,” Tony laughs. “You did wonders for my ego. And now I’m here, so I think it worked out pretty well, don’t you think?”
“You don't even go here, how do you know just know these things? Why am I just finding out about this now?”
Tony can’t look away from all the muscles-- and there are so many, he’s not sure he could ever count them-- so the words are out before he even realizes he’s said them. “So am I, if I get a view like this.”
Steve rolls his eyes even as he feels his cheeks burn, and he leans down to peck his husband’s lips before climbing off to stretch out on the bed again. “You were sayin’?”
"Hey, no, stop," Tony shakes his head. "The kids need time to come up with a kick ass costume, right?
“You’ll treat me anyway,” Steve chuckles, only to take in a sharp breath when Tony lets go and skates beyond reach. “Tony--”
, there’s his baby, sitting on the edge of the balcony of the apartment next to him, less than ten feet away. How he got there, Tony’s not even going to try to guess, but he doesn’t even think twice before leaping over onto the other balcony.
Maria grins down at the camera, and the laugh she lets out a moment later is still one of the most beautiful things Tony’s ever heard, soft but high, like the jingle of bells somewhere in the distance. Her eyes are the same shade of green he remembers. “
“I know I--” Steve swallows, and bites his lip as they start another turn. “Sometimes I wonder if you know how much I love you.”
The silence that follows feels heavier than it had before, but it’s not long before Natasha breaks it.
“Because Papa thought you’d like to name him,” Tony replies, looking over his shoulder to wink at Steve.
“You heard the man, stud muffin. Seven minutes left until it’s officially no longer my birthday. So gimme.”
“I don’t know if I should say anything,” Steve bows his head. He looks and sounds small and unsure and everything Tony knows he isn’t.
“Jesus, okay look, you’re getting all lovey-dovey right now, which is great, it really is, but we’ve got our entire lives for that–”
“Thank you,” Steve whispers, leaning to press a whisper-soft kiss to Tony’s cheek. Tony almost closes his eyes against the warmth that spreads through his body, and hopes that the rest of the team is still distracted by Remy and Clint’s antics.
Steve wakes to whisper soft words spoken against his skin, feels Tony’s lips brush the edge of his shoulder, hands skimming his spine tenderly. He buries his face further into his pillow, once, twice, before turning to face the brunet.
“Hi,” Tony replies, and if he sounds a little breathless, he doesn’t think anyone could blame him because
“Well,” Steve bites his lip, and meets Tony’s gaze head on. “I do feel a little lightheaded, but… that might be because you’re so gorgeous.”
“Pay attention, Rogers,” he says eventually, turning around again until his back is pressed up against Steve’s chest, and breathes in the cold December night until it fills his lungs with peace.
At school, they decide to tell only their smallest circle of friends, because Tony may be an asshole, but he’s not so bad that he’d spring it on them at the last minute. And Steve is worlds nicer than he is, obviously, so he’s just ridiculously excited about it, even if it means they’re going to end up taking a year off before college.
“Hey hey, it’s okay, baby. I’m here, Papa’s here,” he coos, lifting her warm, light frame into his arms. “Guess you’re not goin’ anywhere today either.”
And even though Steve’s tuxedo is as perfectly immaculate as it always is– the man wears anything as well as it can ever be worn, Jesus– his jacket is unbuttoned, as are the top two buttons of his white shirt, and Tony can see the long lines of Steve’s neck and the dark tie hanging under his collar. His bright blue eyes are now dark and steely, the heat inside obvious as he steps up into Tony’s space. He looks well on his way to being thoroughly debauched, and Tony’s suddenly glad no one else will be seeing him like this for the rest of the night.
Which is why she just rolls her eyes when James appears behind the back of the couch and drops matching Santa hats on their tiny heads. “
“There’s nothin’ fun about our friends being arrested,” Steve says, even as the corner of his lips quirks up into that tiny crooked smile Tony loves so much.
“Then stop wasting time, and tell me why we’re here. Not that I’m complaining. I’m all for losing a few hours with you.”
Hey now, don’t sell yourself short, handsome. You’ve got plenty of brains to go with all that brawn.
“That makes two of us,” Tony can’t help but sigh. “With my luck, Pepper will pop up with a fuck ton of work as soon as you leave, the slave-driver.”
“I don’t know,” Tony whispers, and the words taste bitter in his mouth as his eyes, already tired and aching, start to burn again. “Fuck, I... what can I do, Steve? Tell me what to do.”
“–and the truck full of marshmallows? Good times,” Steve grins, then tugs Tony closer through the protective vest he wears. “Now take care of yourself out there, soldier,” he says, and Tony rolls his eyes even as his heart skips a beat at how close they are.
Tony glances back at him incredulously. “You kidding me, babe? Nobody can resist this,” he waves the phone around. “She’ll have ‘em eating outta the palm of her hand.”
“Thought you might.... I dunno, maybe you’d like some company. I-- I brought you a blanket, but I can just-- I can leave it if, if you want--”
Blue eyes, bright with amusement and happiness, meet his through the mirror. “Admit it– you just wanted a reason to shoot Clint.”
"Yeah," Tony sighs, arching his spine, and both of them let out a breath when it brings them even closer together.
“I know...” Tony says, so softly, it probably would’ve gone unheard if it’d been anyone else in there other than Bucky.
“He got assigned to me, but Mrs. Parker just freaked out during her MRI, so I need to go calm her down.”
“Who’s a good girl, huh? Who’s a good girl?” Tony coos, nose buried in the tiny black bundle in his arms. “
I just LOVE the thought of Steve and Tony naming their daughter Isabella, so Tony can call her ‘bella’ (it means ‘beautiful’ in Italian). *SOBS*
"I figured,” Tony’s still smiling, and then looks down at his phone. “Oh crap... right, I’m gonna have to go now, princess,” he bends down to kiss Pepper’s head. “Gotta go be an adult and do boring adult things. But how ‘bout you and I and Bucky and Mr. Rogers go for ice cream after school to talk about your costumes?”
“Okay, yeah,” Tony takes the container and nods, cheeks hurting from how hard he’s grinning now. “Thanks.”
, in a way that he's never been with anyone else-- Pepper included-- and Tony would probably be more annoyed too, if Steve wasn't just as smitten. As it is, the sight of Jarvis and Steve cuddling on the blond's couch makes his heart pathetically skip more than a few beats.
Steve’s laughter is warm against Tony’s temple, as warm as the hand resting on the small of Tony’s back. “Thank you, all the same.”
The drive is quiet for a few minutes after that, but it’s not long before Tony feels something stirring in his chest, and when he can’t ignore it, he makes sure his eyes are nowhere close to meeting Steve’s. “Thank you,” is all he says, and if he’d said it to anyone else, he would’ve cursed the way the words come out low and hesitant.
“Oh pipe down,” Steve rolls his eyes, a little surprised at the easiness with which he says it. They’ve only just met, but there’s something comforting about Steve’s new neighbor, even in the teasing and the wicked grins that are already driving him crazy.
“And by ‘thing’, you mean ‘make out session with a tentacle man’?” Rhodey asks with a grin, nodding his head at the scatter of telltale bruises marking Tony’s neck, and the room erupts into a chorus of snickers and whistles.
“Open your eyes,” he says as he closes his own, aching and burning from lack of sleep and from the tears he swears no one will ever see him cry. “I’m so sick of this room– I’m so fucking sick.”
The man barely takes a step inside-- and even with his heart currently attempting to beat it’s way out of his chest from the adrenaline, Tony feels his breath hitching even further at the sight of the tall, blond Adonis that greets him-- before Tony all but yells, “I swear I’m not a burglar, but you’re kind of an idiot for leaving your doors and windows open.”
“Sweetheart,” Steve says calmly, even though his smile looks more like a grimace as he single-handedly stands there carrying their 42″ flat screen. “If you don’t open this door in the next second…”
Tony lifts an eyebrow in challenge. “Nothin’ to learn, apple pie. That wasn’t even in the top ten of the worst things I’ve put in my mouth. 'sides, I’m the Alpha-- I have no weakness.”
“I wanna know you too,” Tony says. Pepper and Sam snicker loudly, but Tony really couldn’t care less. He just wants to be alone with Steve again.
“Yes sir,” Steve salutes him playfully, and then wraps an arm around Tony’s shoulders to herd him back out into the brisk, evening air. “A little birdie told me you were trash talkin’ AIM Academy earlier.”
“Yeah, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Tony sneers. “Well, you’re gonna have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.”
“And you don’t think I need you? How do you think I feel when you pull the same fucking thing more times than I can count?” Tony yells, and suddenly every moment he’s been on the opposite end is suddenly coming to mind like a flood; the anger and the helplessness, and the sheer terror are almost enough to drown him.
But Steve’s voice comes back just as softly, as warmth as the hand that finds Tony’s. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
“– and y’know what? I’m laying it all out right now, because I just had to watch you die and I know it wasn’t real but it fucking
Steve can’t help the fond laughter that leaves his lips. “Tony, come on. You’ve got class in four hours.”
“Morning, sunshine,” Tony’s voice is low and whisper-soft against Steve’s temple, and he looks up to find the brunet smiling down at him. “You’re just in time for breakfast.”
“After the stunt you both just pulled,” Tony grumbles, falling into one of the kitchen stools, “consider it payment for emotional trauma.”
“Bucky…” Steve sighs, reluctantly drawing his eyes away from the gorgeous brunet across the bar. “I can’t just. He’s not alone, what if–”
“Y'know, I really like the way you say my name,” the brunet purrs, and when his tongue peeks out to wet his lips, Steve wants to push him up against his car and taste them himself.
Steve rolls his eyes, and passes the second plate in the bag to Pepper. “Tony told me you liked Eggplant parm.”
Tony steps further into the kitchen, and spots Barton and Bruce sitting in silence on their respective stools. “Where’s Steve?” he asks.
“I like to keep you on your toes,” Steve tells him. “Besides, that’d defeat the whole ‘surprise’ schtick.”
Tony has to shoot Darcy a knowing look before she leaves with a flip of dark curls and a wave. “So,” he finally says. “Is this something I should expect more of from you, Cap?”
would’ve settled it, too. He lets go of Steve’s hand to practically fling himself all the way to where she stands, and Steve would’ve worried about losing his little brother in a crowd, even one right next to the school, but the little girl is watching Bucky like a hawk, and the old man’s smile makes Steve feel inexplicably better.
Tony doesn’t even bother denying it, and barely has a chance to catch his breath before baby blue eyes finally meet his again.
“Thanks, beautiful,” Tony grins, all dimpled cheeks and crinkling eyes, and Steve wants to kiss him more than he’s ever wanted anything in his life.
He makes a jab, one time, something about Steve and Jarvis needing some time alone, but Steve just rolls his eyes and brings the cat closer.
“She’s beautiful,” Steve whispers, and the awe Tony can hear in his voice warms him more than he already is.
There’s a moment of silence, and then Tony’s breath catches in his throat, because the next thing he hears is the sound of his mother’s voice.
Steve bows his head as he chuckles. “Sorry about that. Things got a little tricker than we were expectin’.”
“I dream about losing you. I dream about you being a self-sacrificing idiot, and taking a bullet for someone; I dream about you flying into that damn portal and never coming back. Sometimes I dream about having to live in a world without you next to me… and I wake up sobbing,” Steve rasps. “I can never go back to sleep after those dreams.
“Language,” Steve mumbles from right behind him, and Tony glares at him over his shoulder with blurry eyes.
“I don’t think so, Mr. Rumlow,” says a hard, clear voice, before Steve can land another punch to Rumlow’s cheek. It takes him a second to realize that the fighting around them’s stopped– just as quick as it started– and he looks up to meet Principal Fury’s dark eyes.
After ten breaths, he forces his feet forward, and the smell of old books hits him before he even steps further inside. Mr. Erskine, the librarian, waves at him from over the counter, and Tony gives him a practiced grin before ducking into the first aisle. He thumbs over endless book spines as he makes his way down, and tries to find the rhythm in his lungs.
“...help me up, then?” Steve asks, taking the hand Tony offers him a second later. “Careful, don’t want you joinin’ me down here.”
Steve looks up from the sinkful of dishes at Tony’s question, and finds him staring down at the cards spread out on the kitchen island. “I really didn’t. What, you don’t believe me?”
, I swear I do, but I’m also too damn selfish to let you go. I want to keep you next to me every day, I want to wake up with you, sleep with you, and kiss you and fight with you, and laugh with you; I want to cry with you, and raise a family with you– by the way, kids? We’re getting kids. One kid, a ton of ‘em, I don’t care, as long as i’m their dad and you’re their Papa. I want to be there when we’re old and fat and grey, and we can barely remember anything else except each other.
“I know they’re just dreams. We’ve never even… talked about anything like that, but it just– it happened once, and then again, and… yeah…”
“Wh-- I’m fine, babe,” he nods, leaning up to press a kiss to Steve’s jaw. A part of him wants to run the fuck away, to scream and rage because damn it, this shouldn’t be possible, this is the last wound he needs reopened.
“Just give me my food, you jerk,” he mumbles, and then it's turkey sandwiches and Perry Como for the rest of the afternoon.
"What's the diagnosis?" Stark deflects, running his fingers over the bandage wrapped around Steve's middle.
"Here ya go,” he says, heart lurching against his chest when Steve’s eyes drop to his lips as he bites his own.
“Toast,” Steve says firmly, but only Pepper can see the absolute joy on his face, and it makes something soft and warm spark inside her, close to her heart.
He’d asked Steve about it the morning after, when his mind was normal again-- as normal as it could be, anyway, seeing as how he’s Tony Stark-- but Steve had just shaken his head.
Bucky grins back. “Pep,” he points to Steve, “this’s Steeb! He’s my brother, an' he likes to draw like you!”
“They’re cute,” Steve mumbles, just as the entire room erupts in laughter at the sight of half a dozen Avengers ornaments tumbling to the floor as Barnes tips the bag over.
, his mind reminds him giddily, and Tony barely manages to stop his face from breaking out into a pathetically sappy little grin. “It’s a tree, Rogers,” he finally says.
Especially the family recipe. I’d make it myself if I could, but if I even touch a stove, I think I’d burn the kitchen down.
“Not one bit, seeing as how I love you too,” Tony smiles, breathing around the warmth in his chest as Steve returns it with another one of his own. A particularly chilly burst of wind makes him shiver a second later, however, and Tony pulls away with a sigh. “By the way, you’re absolutely coming with me next time I pay Parker a visit,
(ALRIGHT, GUYS. This is the last update I have... at least until I write some more, so don't worry. This ain't the end of this baby. Thank you guys so much for all the hits and kudos and comments. I appreciate them more than you will ever know. :'D)
“I didn’t know you were gonna drive through it,” Tony points out. “You had fucking oceans of space! Coulda gone right past it.”
“The things I do for you Rogers’,” Tony mutters, peeling the wrapper off a granola bar with relish as Steve’s chuckles fill the tiny car.
“‘f course not,” Tony declares emphatically, and suddenly he’s more excited than he thinks he’s ever been. “We’re-- we’re gonna go out and eat and hold hands and, and oh my god, we’re gonna
“Ah, no no no, stop! I don’t know what you’re talking about– Queens? Who’s Queens, huh? What’s– what’s that?” he rambles in between quiet laughter, and doesn’t quite manage to hold back the shiver at the feel of Steve’s own chuckles on his neck, at the vibrations along his spine.
“Daddy, look! Cat, cat, cat, cat! Cat, cat, cat,” she sings, golden curls bouncing with every excited step she takes. The sight warms Steve’s heart like few things ever have, and when he sneaks a glance at his husband, the bright, happy look in his eyes tells Steve he feels the same too.
He hears Tony sigh from the other end, soft and almost lost in the faint bustle in the background, and then-- “
Tony revels in the thrill of anticipation that runs through him even as he feels his face grow warm. “Knock yourself out then, soldier,” is all he gets to say before warm lips are pressed against his own, and the world beyond their bed falls away. Steve kisses him slowly, tenderly, with so much love, it almost brings Tony to tears, and as he cups the blond’s jaw with trembling hands to deepen the kiss, he hopes Steve can feel just how much Tony loves him in turn.
“Oh,” Stark says, quiet and a little stiff, and then gives him a jerky nod. “Ditto. On the, uh, name thing.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but he’s still blushing– people are hearing this, damn it, he’s sure Sam and Bucky will be laughing their asses off when he gets home– and he’s still smiling. “I meant music, Mr. Stark.”
Which is probably the only reason he doesn’t fall apart the second they enter the room and meet bright green eyes.
But his boyfriend just shakes his head, and turns on his side as he pulls Tony closer, until they’re face to face. “Maybe later,” he whispers, all tousled hair and baby blue eyes hazy with sleep. “For now, all I wanna do is kiss you.”
Which is probably why it takes so long to realize that Steve’s fingers are moving against his own– slowly, carefully, but with purpose– and before he can pull away to look down, he feels a cool, unmistakably metal band slide into his finger.
Steve closes his eyes against the warm rush of love that sweeps through him. “You’re somethin’, sweetheart.”
Tony rolls his eyes as he finally moves past Natasha, and listens to her footsteps grow farther and fainter as he finally brings himself to open the door in front of him.
“I do,” Steve nods, and doesn’t give Tony time to say anything else before he leans in to lick the swipe of frosting that’d been sitting on Tony’s cheek the whole time.
“Good,” Steve smiles sympathetically when he shines the light in the brunet eyes and he winces. “Sorry about that. But the good news is that you’re most likely just fine. Your head’ll be aching something fierce, but the worst seems to be over. We’ll be taking an MRI scan, though, just to be sure. Do I have your permission to do so, Mr. Stark?”
“Like you and your moonin’ and droolin’?” Steve smirks, crossing his arms over his chest, and Tony doesn’t even hide the way he stares at all muscles bulging out in front of him.
,” Clint cackles, and jumps up from his seat. “Nat, babe, get me out of here, I’m dying. Bruce, buddy, come with.”
brushing against his heart, he knows it’s true. “But you can bet we’ll be having words later, Shellhead.”
Brown eyes turn up to meet his again. “Fine, I’ll stop,” Tony chuckles, fondness lacing every word, and Steve feels better than he has in days.
“I wike Macawoni,” Steve says softly, eyes growing wide and glassy as his bottom lip starts to wobble, and Tony fucking
Steve’s laughter feels like the best thing he’s ever heard. “I figured you’d be less likely to deck me this way.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but doesn’t pull away from Tony’s embrace. “I cannot believe you just bought our daughter a cat.”
“Don’t keep me waiting at all, handsome,” Tony says, facing Steve even as he walks away. “Chop chop, Rogers. And thanks for the ‘boost’!”
” Steve chokes, almost dropping the bowl of frosting in his hand as he whips around to look at Bucky.
“Doesn’t bother me,” he replies, tucking his enormous body inside. “Come on, then. Y’can sleep on top ‘f me.”
“I’m pretty sure a piece of toast isn’t enough for that body of yours–” he calls out, but then the couch comes into view and he stops short.
“Didn’t know you were so eager to have a baby with me,” Steve smirks, ignoring the shiver that runs through him at the thought.
“Cap’s got the injection,” Clint says quietly. “Remember: make it quick, and make it look real. See you in two weeks, Rogers.”
"It's time for breakfast..." Steve says, but trails off when Tony leans in again, licking and mouthing and sucking his neck. And just like that, the heat is back.
“Come on,” Steve coos, “I know you’re still sleepy, sweetheart. You can stay here with me and Daddy, all warm and cozy, yeah?”
“You’re going to do it,” Barnes continues, voice rising to drown out Tony’s words, “because it took Sam, Thor, Barton, and Rhodes– all of them– to hold him down after you ran off. You’re going to do it because none of us can take any more of seeing you and Steve act like the sun shines out of each of your asses. You’re going to do it because you are a lot of things, but a coward ain’t one of ‘em.”
Steve drops the shield on the floor with a thump, and wastes no time in climbing the bed and crawling atop the soft, cotton sheets covering Tony’s warm, delicious body. “Hi,” he says, smiling into the kiss he’s pulled down into.
“Not my fault you came home in full regalia. Feels like it’s my birthday too,” Tony winks. “Besides, I like to keep you on your toes.”
.” Steve’s eyes are wide and wet with emotion, and Tony feels like he could die from the love he sees burning in their depths. “God, I’m… look, you deserve so much better than this, than me asking you while we’re half naked after a paintball game, but I swear to God, this ring’s been burnin’ a hole in my drawer and I think if I wait any longer I might lose my mind, baby.”
Clint and Bucky’s snickering might’ve annoyed Steve any other time, had he not been preoccupied with the smell of Tony’s cologne, the sharp lines of his suit as they hugged every inch of a body Steve’s been dreaming of running his lips over. As it is, he barely manages to square his shoulders and nod. “I did,” he says. “We’re not buying a dog, Tony.”
Bruce goes up with a nod, smiling shyly as he present his own card, and he’s followed quickly by Sam and Clint and then Bucky, all of them as happy and proud as the next. With each card, Tony grows more and more  still, until he’s as tense as Steve thinks he’s ever seen him, and the urge to reach over and touch him is almost unbearable.
“Somethin’ like that,” Bucky snorts, and then gives Tony a smile. “Whatcha got there, though, huh? Captain America?”
“Yes, yes, and yes. You’re not getting rid of me that easy, ” Steve chuckles, and Tony feels the warm tendrils of relief run through him as he leans his head on the blond’s shoulder.
“God, you’re kinda killing me with... all of you, right now,” he waves his hand around, letting out one last, tiny groan when Steve tightens his hold around Tony’s waist and pulls him further in between his legs.
“You know,” Tony points out, “you're actin’ pretty smug for a guy who almost cried on the way here--”
“Doesn’t look like he agrees with you,” Barnes whispers, shaking his head, and then goes back to the window.
“Hiya back. So, your friend…” Tony jerks a thumb in the direction of his table, and when Steve looks over, Bucky’s grin matches the ones from the two other people there, a dark skinned man in a US Marines jacket, and a tall red-haired woman in a suit not unlike Tony’s. “I think I owe him something for introducing us.”
“I’ve been talking to Pepper more lately, SI business, and I don’t know, I guess I started remembering when we broke up. It doesn’t mean anything, we’re friends now, it’s all good– shit, Steve, I’m sorry.”
“Three days ago,” Tony says, tucking the phone between his head and his shoulder. “The last time we talked.”
“I’m sorry,” she breathes, struggling against her cuffs like she wants to fling herself at him. “I’m sorry,
“Wasn’t planning to,” Tony says, and Steve’s takes advantage of it, moving his head back to Tony’s shoulder. It’s warm and real and very much alive, and as the rest of their team-- their family-- focus on the food and company once more, he sends a quick prayer of thanks. “Steve?”
“Does it help if I tell you I love you?” Steve whispers, the emotion in his voice sending Tony’s heart into flutters that he hopes will never get old.
“You guys sure about this?” Sam asks, right as they reach the entrance to the cafeteria. It’s loud and full, but Steve and Rhodey just nod. “Oh, who am I kidding? Barnes, get ready to hold one of ‘em back–”
“Nowadays, all I can think about is how lucky I am. Havin’ this much, back then... God, I couldn’t even dream about it.”
“Take a shower, get something other than coffee in you, and change out of that godawful suit,” Pepper orders the next morning as she enters the room, voice clipped and sharp, and louder than anything he’s heard since the chaos of the conference room as shots rang out and Steve put his stupid,
Tony only says the words because he’s never been one for silences, and this one seems like the worst he could ever imagine. There’s nothing but the sound of his breathing, the steady beeping of the machine close to him, and Tony’s heart on the verge of shattering to irreparable pieces.
It’s loud enough to break the moment, and Tony only just manages to smother the whimper at the loss of those lips, and those hands. And those eyes.
“I missed you too, y’know,” he rasps, looking back up to meet those blue, blue eyes, and when Steve pulls him into his arms, Tony feels happier than he has in days.
again-- and he looks so small, despite being taller than everyone in the room, that Tony can’t stop himself from reaching out to touch his arm.
“Worth it, though, if it gets you to smile like that,” Steve says, voice as soft as the gleam of awe in his eyes, and Tony feels his whole face grow warm.
Steve narrows his eyes, smirk still sitting pretty on his face, before finally feigning a sigh of defeat. “Enough to know when to pick my battles, I s’ppose.”
Then he looks up, and right there in front of him is the bright red door that he loves so much because it’s his favorite color and because there’s the scratch above the doorknob he made when he was nine.
“It’s too goddamn early for you two to be smiling like that,” Tony mutters. “I have a goddamn heart problem.”
And really, he knows that’s not normal, but when has he ever been normal? He’s a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, and he’s been kidnapped more times than he can count, for more reasons than he can think of. Not to mention his time in Afghanistan—
“Good-- you weren’t being very subtle with those eyes. And watch that arm next time, big guy. Good luck,” Sharon waves, and then she’s gone.
Steve takes a deep breath, pulls the brunet close, and whispers his response. “I’ve dreamt about having kids. With you.”
“Don’t be mean!” Steve’s laughter fills the room easily and god, Tony’s missed the sound; his heart feels fuller just hearing it.
In the hushed quiet of the Avengers tower living room, Pepper manages to catch the conversation even from across the other end of the couch. The volume from the movie they’d put on—an old cartoon Pepper can’t recall ever seeing, mostly for the benefit of the rest of the sugar-high team they’d needed to calm down— isn’t all the way down, just low enough to soothe the children to sleep.
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m too selfish to get cold feet,” he says, but Natasha just smiles, and goes back to adjusting his tie despite his protests. “I’m just saying, Steve doesn’t care what I look like– I could probably go in there naked, and he’d be fine with it.”
“Shut up,” Rhodey growls. “And we’re telling you now: this is the last time you fuck around with him.”
All the air leaves Steve’s lungs, and he pulls back to meet burning brown eyes. “What are you saying…”
“That doesn’ make sense,” he mumbles, glancing at Tony through one bleary eye. The covers are so soft and warm, he almost drifts back to sleep, but doesn’t get a chance before lips are on his skin again, slower and hotter this time.
So when he wearily makes his way through the door of his suite at the end of the day, it takes him an embarrassingly long amount of time to register the familiar, mouthwatering scent of grilled meat wafting from the suite kitchen. He takes off his suit and tie, rolls up his sleeves, turns the corner--
“I can’t–” Steve mutters, and almost staggers into the empty hallway leading out of the building. “God, I hate this so much.”
Steve grins. “You know it,” he says, and gently takes Tony’s wrist towards the kitchen island. “Wanna change before you eat?”
“She doesn’t speak English?” Tony hears Steve ask, but most of his attention is still on the golden haired woman and her flawlessly spoken Italian.
“Maybe next time you’ll think about stepping in front of me during a battle,” Steve says softly, but doesn’t let go of the brunet’s hand. “If you weren’t so sorry lookin’ right now, I’d deck ya right in the kisser.”
“Sorry for the wait, kiddies– actually, scratch that. I’m not. I had a… thing,” he waves his hand around, “that went over.”
. He takes Steve’s face in his hand and kisses back, slowly and more gently than he’d ever expected any of their first kisses to be– and he’s imagined so many, he’s lost count.
“Well, I can’t say I blame her,” Tony says, “but consent is totally a thing, and if she can’t see that, fuck her.”
. Or as close to it as anyone could be. Back then, anyway. Now I can-- I see it, y’know? Crystal clear...”
Almost every head turns their way, and the room grows quiet as Rhodey’s voice cuts through the cacophony around them. Steve can feel the steady presence of his friends behind him, but the second he spots Rumlow and Hammer at Tiberius Stone’s table, he’s all but running in their direction.
“You guys are nauseating and this is the last party we’re inviting you to!” Clint yells at them as they cross the room, even as the rest of their friends share knowing looks.
Jarvis chuckles. “No sir. Just Jarvis, or Mr. Jarvis, if you will. Miss Stark is very fond of your brother.”
“I’m sure Rhodey’s alright with it. Mind if I take him out for a turn, sir?” Steve asks, blue eyes twinkling with mirth.
“No, Bucky,” Steve pulls away, and if Tony were any less mature, he’d be whining. “This isn’t all it’s gonna be. You--
Steve chuckles into his chest, squares his shoulders, and looks him in the eye. “I, uh... I might have left them open all the time so Jarvis could get in, and then... Then, you’d have to come over.”
“Gonna pick one from the Captain America shrine room you’ve got in the basements?” Steve teases, and Tony pulls away to punch him in the chest.
. “If you want, obviously? And if you’re not busy. It’s only Brooklyn, so it’s pretty safe, you don’t have to worry about--”
The apartment is empty when they go in, but Tony just keeps pulling him until they’re standing in the middle of the room.
It’s not that Tony forgets about the guy-- he doesn’t think that’s even remotely possible. But as the day goes on, he lets his school work take over him once more, and by the time his last class is over, the only thing on his mind is getting back to his messy clutter of an apartment.
The two notes have been stuck to the window the entire time, and most of their students have stopped to read them at one point or another, so there’s more attention this time around.
“Put a sock in it, Stark. Since when do you say no to seeing you on screen? There’s no way we’re not putting these on.”
” Tony almost whimpers. “Oh my god, okay, you’re perfect. It’s settled-- destiny, two thumbs up. Is it Thursday already?”
Tony feels love rush through him like a wave, warm and heady and almost overwhelming. He wants to lean over the table and kiss Steve again until they’re breathless and hungry for something far more important than food. But those blue eyes across the table from him are gleaming with so much hope, that Tony finds it easy to put aside his thoughts and focus on the obscenely delicious smells all around him, and the gorgeous man responsible for them. “ Sure it is.”
“Hey, I didn’t--” Tony starts, but then Steve’s moving away and there’s more people, and they’re probably the paramedics, he knows that, but everything’s suddenly too close and the sky is still so fucking bright and
,” Big, Blond and Beautiful stops short, cheeks flushing a pretty shade of pink as he seems to realize his friend’s not alone in the room. “Um, sorry. Hi.”
All five heads snap his way, but Steve puts down his pencil and grins at him, all bright blue eyes and sunshine in his hair and Jesus Christ, he’s so damn beautiful.
“You fucking listen to me,” he points at Tony, crouching down in front of him. His eyes are dark and serious, but there’s a calmness in them that settles Tony a little, even as his hackles rise at being ordered. “Get up those stairs and go find Steve–”
with the world?" Tony waves a hand in Steve's direction before moving it to where their daughter lies sleeping.
