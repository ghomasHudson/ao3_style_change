3.	All Along the Water Tower (1997)
Dean rehearsed Castiel. This time he looked him directly in the eye and smiled. Castiel noticed that the green eyes were covered with golden-brown speckles and did not notice that he was staring at Dean.
He is co-founder and CEO of a non-profit organization dedicated to financing and supervising social projects at home and abroad.
D:	„But, that creeps me out!“
Next to a stretch bench stood  Alastair, the Grand Inquisitor of Hell, looking up from his work. "Castiel, my brother, what gives me the honor?" he flattered the angel. Castiel  shook in disgust. Alastair's  voice sounded to him like a screeching scratch behind eyelids.
C:	"What does it mean he's not there?"
D:	„I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos… You know, Michael Landon. Not dicks.“
This time it was Castiel who blushed. Dean giggled mischievously. As a result, both men had to laugh again.
Castiel shook his head. “You don't have to apologize. It's all right.” The two walked side by side. "So you're shooting a new movie right now? What’s the title?" Castiel just walked towards his apartment. "Yes, It’s 'Purgatory'. According to the book of the same name by Chuck Shurley." Castiel stopped. He looked at Dean thoughtfully. Dean also stopped and turned around. "What's going on?"
Castiel swallowed his coffee and had to cough. "I'm sorry! I didn't want that!" Dean immediately swore, gently patting Castiel on the back. Castiel had started turning dark-red. Whether from a cough or from shame, Dean couldn't say. Gabriel stood beside him and smiled. He probably thought his part?!
When they interrupted the kiss to get some air, Dean took a small step backward. "That's not going to be the case with talking!" He turned around and ran towards the kitchen. He was still breathing heavily when he came back. He waved a milk bag and a sugar cane. Between his teeth, he carried two small spoons. Castiel took the spoons from him.
Dean laughed. In the bathroom, he tossed the shirt in the laundry basket. He turned on the water in the shower and stood under it. "Come on Cas, soap me up!" He lured the other into the shower. Cas stood next to him under the water jet. He took the shower bath from the niche and soaped Dean's back. Tenderly, he stroked the spine, the shoulder blades, every single muscle strand that moved under his touch. Dean propped himself up against the wall. "Oh God, Cas, soap, do not make it hot!" He turned around. "Just look what you've done!" Dean was hard again. Cas smiled shamelessly. "I'm sorry." Dean laughed. "Should I believe you?" Cas tilted his head to the side and jingled his eyes. Dean shook his head laughing. "Now it's my turn. Turn around! “Cas shook his head. "No, no, that's okay." Dean frowned. "Now don't be so shy! turn around! “Castiel turned around timidly. Dean stayed out of breath. "Cas ..."
"Dito." cried Charlie. 'I can't get rid of Wednesday either. We have a new boss and he drives us quite a lot. I will miss a really hot bride! So, Sammy, next time set the dates for the weekend!"
"Yes, all right. 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, car, nature. Sounds great. I'm looking forward to tomorrow," Castiel said.
Just in time for 10 a.m., he stood in front of Cas's house. He was excited.
"Hey blue-eyed hotty, coffee pleasing?" flirted Dean. Castiel’s heartbeat rose. Dean was waiting for him outside the store… with a coffee?
Sam, Bobby, and Dean were discussing who or what had saved Dean from hell. Castiel was not visible to the three.
D: How are you?
It left Cas with no peace that Dean made a very disturbing impression as he drove home after the picnic. When Amara and the children had gone to sleep, he called Dean.
He showered, dressed up, and packed things into the car.
He had fallen asleep while reading on the bed. Castiel  looked at him for a while and repeatedly realized how beautiful the man was. Over his nose and cheekbones were freckles. Dean  had a tense expression on his face. He seemed to be dreaming badly.
Whenever he went to bed in the evening, Dean thought of Castiel. He then picked up his phone and surfed the internet. He then stared at the pictures for hours and tried to realize whether he wanted to do anything with Cas, whether he wanted to do anything with a man at all. And as if to order, the mobile phone beep every evening at the same time and left “Good Night’s” with a picture.
D: Super, then I'm reassured. Have a good rest
E:	"She gives him her blood. He thinks it makes him stronger. Finish it Castiel!"
Dean, however, put his hand on Castiel's cheek and looked at him. The skin under his hand was soft and warm and slowly turned red. Castiel's beard stubble scratched a little in his palm. Dean smiled. "I write to you when I'm at home." He stroked his thumb over Castiel's cheek and carefully pulled his hand away. He didn't wait for the other's response and turned around. Dean went without another word.
Benny and Dean shook their heads. "No, you?" Crowley denied. He pointed to the other side of the room. "But an old flame. I'll say 'Hello'." With that, Crowley was gone again. Megan pushed past them. "Boys, don't stop in the middle of the entrance!"
•	My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009)
D:	„This is why I can’t get behind God. If he doesn’t exist, fine. Bad crap happens to good people, That‘s how it is. But if he is out there, what’s wrong with him? Where the hell is he while all these descent people are gettin‘ torn to shreds? How does he live with himself? You know, why doesn’t he help?“
The hunter looked around in disbelief. There was devastation around his grave. There was no tree in a huge perimeter. They had come down in a circular and uprooted manner. "What the hell?" "Nope. Other direction,"  Castiel  replied promptly. But the hunter could not hear him.
D:	"You already have."
He would like to show him all the splendor of his wings, but did not know how. He wondered where that thought came from. "What kind of angel are you? You burned out the eyes of this poor woman! " Scolded  Dean. Castiel  looked to the ground. He was saddened by it.  'I didn't want her to spy on my true form. It can be overwhelming for people. Like my real voice. But you already knew that."
D:	„Okay. When there are angels, then what? There’s a God?
C:	"That's a lot of uncertainty? What does Father say about this?"
D: Hi.
Castiel entered the cafe through the back entrance and walked through the kitchen. He killed with speed, precision and without scruples. He sent one demon after another to death. He brought down a total of four. But the waitress,  Aku, was too fast. She escaped.  Castiel,  however, did not bother to chase her. He didn't have time. He had to talk to Dean.
"The main role of Dante is played by Dean Winchester." Dean rose and turned to the audience. "The two companions Virgil and Statius are played by Benny Lafitte as Virgil and Crowley McLeod as Statius." Benny got up, Crowley came over to them and stood up. "You will probably have noticed the parallels with Dante's Divine Comedy. The book "Purgatory" is based on this. But it's an absolutely independent novel.”
"Right. And why  would an angel save me from hell? "  Dean  doubted what he heard. "Good things happen, Dean!" Castiel  moved one step closer to  Dean.  Dean  shook his head. "Not in my experience."
D:	„Okay. Last one opens and…?“
Dean rolled out a poster.
U:	"It's broken. It's too late.'
D:	„Well thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest!“ Dean got angry.
Suddenly, the roof slabs of the barn lifted, the light bulbs burst. The barn gate flew open. Castiel entered the barn. Dean and  Bobby  pointed shotguns at him. As he approached, the two shot. 'With rock salt!' Castiel thought to himself. He continued to approach the two hunters.
1.	Viva Wishbone (1995)
Dean leaned forward and gave Cas a kiss on the cheek. "Thank you." Cas blushed and turned to Dean. "What was it for?"
D:	„Why me? Why do I deserve to get saved? I‘m just a regular guy!“
"What do you want to get out of? Will this be a praise for your father's creation or do you have a task for me?" Castiel  moaned,  Michael always had to give theatrical speeches before he came to the actual point.
Pamela cried out in pain. She had not endured his sight. Her eyes were completely burnt out, blood running out of the empty eye sockets. The boys immediately called an ambulance.  Bobby  accompanied  Pamela to the hospital.  Castiel  was so sorry for that. He felt  deep  regret.
On his way home, he passed Harvelle's Roadhouse. From time to time he made a stopover here to drink a whiskey for the evening. Today, however, he was not after it.
D:	„Why break the seal, anyway?“
Cas didn't let any time pass and looked at Dean's wiki.
Castiel was exhausted and sat on a fallen tree. He began to drop off parts of his armor. It was not to be assumed that he needed them now.
C: Hello Dean.
He had to go back to Dean and help him fight evil! He was not allowed to leave him alone for too long.
Dean immediately interrupted him. "I'm sorry. Don't you like it?" Castiel shook his head. "Dean, stop apologizing all the time. I like 'Cas'." He reached out to Dean to salute.
"I'll go and let you enjoy your weekend," Dean began cautiously. "Yes. Um. Thanks for the nice afternoon, Dean. I was really pleased. I didn't have that much fun for a long time!" replied Castiel. "You called me Cas earlier..." began Castiel.
C:	„Mm-hm. And not just here. Twenty other hunters are dead.“
"I thought we were going out to the countryside a little bit to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. I hope you like the idea," he tried himself in Smalltalk.
B:	„Revelations. This is a sign, boys!“
Later, he was on his way to the divine library when Eloy ran over him.
Dean pointed to  Castiel's  body. "And what face are you wearing  now? Holy Tax accountant?" "That?" Castiel  looked down at his body. "It's a vessel." Dean  was horrified. "You occupied a poor bastard?"
D:	„I was not groped by an angel!“
Again and again, Castiels words echoed through his head. "Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you!"
When calm returned, Dean picked up the bottle of Kinky Queen and refilled Castiel's glass. He prosed him. "To new friends!" and emptied his glass in a draught. Castiel did the same. Dean repeated it a few times. Each time with the request to Castiel to follow his example.
“Every choice, every outcome is played out to its infinite potentiality. Angels can move through these at will, past, present and future. These potentialities only become reality when they are encountered by humanity. Think of it as a literal interpretation of Schrodinger’s Cat.”
Oh, Jesus…
Dean snarled at her, tangled his fingers in Sam’s shirt—“DON’T!”
Dean looked back and forth between the two of them and may or may not have held Sputnik a little closer to his chest, squeezing just enough that her tongue popped out between furry lips.
“I’m just glad I wasn’t in ‘er at the time,” The man says. He’s about Dean’s height with shaggy dirty-brown hair and sideburns, hails from Tennessee and calls himself Sebastian. Bobby gives him a sandwich and takes thirteen-hundred for an eighty-six ford he’s managed to get roadworthy, if in need of a matching paint scheme. It’ll get him where he’s going and do until he finds something better. He’s gone before noon and Dean has the rims cleaned of mud and fitted with new tires. He has the front two on when Bobby comes outside to tell him the good news about the demon.
Jamie’s friend Lucy on the other hand… Yeah. Not a fan.
“I wasn’t sure yet, honestly. I figured I’d get your opinion before we took off.”
He pulled back with a start, lips still parted and vaguely tingling, fingers tangled in the angel’s hair and lifting him away. He felt his stomach lodge up between his lungs and everything ground to a cold halt.
Castiel didn’t let go of the phone right away, held it for a second too long and if the damned thing hadn’t begun chirping and dinging and letting Dean know that he had a few texts and missed calls and wasn’t he so happy that he’d got emails—Dean may have planted another one on him, but as it was Dean was already shaking inside with nerves and barely controlled fears and the phone just gave him an excuse to pull away for a while and regroup.
“Dean!”
Sam’s expression is tense as they make their way up the back path to the Milligan house. It’s obvious he wants to at least hook an arm around Dean’s shoulders because the limping is downright pathetic but Dean’s stubborn, slaps at him whenever he gets too close or holds out a hand.
“You’re kind of not. You look awful, you’re shaking and I thought you were gonna swing at that girl—“
She draws her hands back, doesn’t retreat fully, just pulls back enough that their fingers barely brush and Dean feels his heart begin to slow, his breath evens out and his voice only shakes a little as he continues; “I realized after that that I help people… I-I save them from what I… I save them and it… it’s worth it.”
Bobby let out a sigh and lifted his cap long enough to give his scalp a scratch. “Well, that went tits up faster than I expected. Sorry, Dean.”
Tessa smiles kindly; “Maybe nobody wants to ruin the surprise.”
There’s a teeming mas of gray and mustard brown standing over the guy under the shelf. A hunched shape that swallows up all the color in the room, Sam’s fighting his way to his feet, shoving equipment that had fallen from the shelves on top of him out of the way, tangled in old power cords and cursing as he tries to stand.
“Sam’s score on the LSAT?”
Dean took him to Physical Therapy the next morning. He met Ellen in the hall as she was waking and said he would do it, to rest. She’d been handling Sam’s care since the beginning, she deserved to relax. She put her hands on Dean’s face and met his eyes, tired and relieved and fed up; “He needs you… He needs you more than any of us.”
“It’s difficult.”
He gave a wet chuckle; “How do I help him?”
“I think someone’s got their chocolate in your peanut butter, Dean,” His finger lifts, almost touches the seal or whatever it was Cas had put on him but Dean finds his voice. “Someone plays dirty—“
He pushes her away and she stands there, indignant in her fury, eyes black and lips rolled back from her teeth; “Have I ONCE asked you to hurt Dean? Or anyone that wasn’t a demon!”
Dean points with the spoon at the dog; “You messed her up, you get to wash her.”
0-0-0
“Which would make the grace go all attack dog, okay,” Breathe in and out, “What if I can keep it under control.”
“Shut up,” Sam turned to the menu and refused to look up. His face was red.
“About two Pancake Houses ago.”
“Ruby?”
It happened in a matter of seconds, a great RUSH into the room like a bomb had gone off. Chuck let out a startled yelp as a she moved past him and Castiel’s head lifted in surprise, eyebrows raised. It’s probably the most expressive Dean had seen him in a while.
“You can protect yourself?”
“Is this It?” Bobby’s voice is low, a growl between his teeth; “Is he—“
Dean was uncomfortable for all of fifteen minutes, the time it took to gather his and Castiel’s bags, wake the angel, get Sputnik tucked against his chest to keep her out of the water, and make it up to their room.
He turns, blinks and scratches through his jeans; “Regret what?”
Ellen bobbed her shoulder toward her ear; “Gotta die sometime, might as well go out doing something noble.”
“Besides, I’m pretty sure she doesn’t play for my team, yanno?”
Pennsylvania wasn’t anything they hadn’t seen before. It was the same as it had always been. Quaint, the road scattered with fallen leaves, rain splattering the windshield, deer looming out of the darkness as pinprick green eye reflections. A dead raccoon and a grinning opossum scuttling across the road—
“Hey guys—“
Castiel followed him a little too closely and sat when Dean told him to sit in the shoe department. Kicked off his borrowed boots and put on the pair Dean pushed in his direction. Dean remembered doing this with Sam in a Goodwill years ago, crouching in the floor and pressing his thumbs into the toes of sneakers and telling Sam to wiggle. He thought he was a little too old to be doing it again but Castiel had seemed perfectly content to let Bobby’s old too-big boots rub blisters on his feet.

He gathers up his things and leaves, feels sweat trickling down the back of his collar and is shocked by the temperature he reads on the old Pepsi thermometer hanging outside the hotel… Is even more so unnerved when he realizes the Impala’s gone. He pushes into the room and calls out, hears nothing in return and goes for the phone, punches in Dean’s number and gets voicemail.
“Do you want to? Knowing that they’ve lied to you?”
“It was just a suggestion… And I’m glad you told me. It—it actually helps, gives me something else to focus on instead of the fact I can’t feel my dick.”
Dean turns and looks out the window, tries not to listen but the sound of her voice goes right through him. Weird… He’s heard Sam do this with a lot of people before but it’s never hit him like this.
Castiel just stared at him, seemed more upset by the second. His face slowly reddened and his nose wrinkled up. “It’s not as easy as just saying it.”
Dean wasn’t sick, wasn’t physically hurt in a way that would keep him from being able to defend himself. Dean was hurt on the inside, in places that couldn’t be stitched or bandaged or relocated by force and it was so bad he couldn’t handle it. He PHYSICALLY couldn’t handle it!
Her breathing is labored, quick uneven little sips of air and when Dean turns to her she bares her teeth at him; “Take me home.”
Dean swallowed nervously and Jo made a sound in her throat; “Uh-oh…”
“Relax,” Sam scooped the contents of the hex-bag back together and set it aside; “It’s at least a hundred years old.”
Dean felt that certainty, that urge to just—SPEAK flutter away like a startled pigeon. He raked a hand over his head, sighed and hefted himself to his feet. “I’ll-uh—We’ll talk when I get back,” He lugged his bag back down stairs.
Sam waited until Friday night to bring up Sunday supper. They had just finished eating, and Dean was trying to get motivated to clean up the plates, when Sam cleared his throat from across the table.
But that wasn't true. What he was doing was wondering if he'd kept a copy of
It was spoken with affection; Charlie and Castiel were both proud geeks.
Dean thought about his first conversation with Castiel Novak.
In the office that morning, he made an uncharacteristic trip to the break room down one floor from his office, where marketing lived. He didn't have to wait long for Charlie to make an appearance; she tended to take frequent breaks from the open-floor social media bay to think over her next steps during the walk to and from the coffee machines. She looked as peppy as ever that morning, long red hair swinging freely around her shoulders, neon green earbuds visible between the strands. Her "I'm only talking to you because I forgot my book" t-shirt and studded jeans were as far from editorial office wear as she could get; he could count on one hand the number of times he'd seen her in true business attire. She held her ever-present tablet in one hand and was muttering something under her breath as she made her way, head down, to refill her coffee tumbler.
"Hiya, Castiel. Hope your day is going better than mine is…"
"What genre?"
"Dean." Sam fixed him with a stare, and Dean could tell he was also schooling his face and tone. "It's a few hours. It's been months since she saw you. Take a break to eat some food. Please."
"Need I remind you that I re-read the entire Tolkien oeuvre last year on your whim…" Castiel crossed his arms and gave her an unsympathetic stare.
"Yeah, you bet you are." Gabriel lowered his head and his expression softened for a moment. "For what it's worth…" He flicked his eyes up to Castiel, mouth pulling into a battle smile. "I hope this Winchester guy is a real pain in the ass."
"Mom, you know he's mostly out of that now," Sam interjected, trying to turn her off the topic.

"G'night, Dean."
could sell it to him, Castiel."
Castiel considered for a moment whether to let her in on Gabriel's mission. Glancing around the break room and finding it empty, he continued in quieter tones. "I might be able to get an initial draft of the next manuscript… If I do, I hope you'll consider following up with that."
"Hey." Dean bent to unlace his boots, placing his pack on the floor for a moment near the entrance.
"We published one of those last year," Castiel pointed out. Their urban fantasy publication,
"Hello."
came up. Gabriel could walk into a room and turn a meeting around. In a fitted suit and on a mission, he was all but unstoppable, all warmth and charm and confidence. Castiel was never surprised when Gabriel managed to win a new manuscript.
Charlie jumped back, nearly stumbling over her own rainbow-bedecked hightops. "Holy s—Novak, did they have a fire drill on seven or something? What brings you to the marketing lair?"
"Mr. Shurley, I am merely helping your teammates communicate with you. I normally would not be involved in this type of literature, but when they asked for my help, of course I was happy to add my support to their cause. We're just one big team here at Elysium, are we not?"
The smile was quickly squashed as Gabriel turned suspicious eyes on the older salesman.
Dean dove into returning calls, setting up jobs, and updating his wilderness guide website. By the third day, he had driven out to Cheyenne Bottoms wetlands to scope out conditions for a guided tour later in the week. It was for a group of birders, and the weather was looking good to get in plenty of migratory cranes and other birds. Dean always liked to make sure he went through any trails each year prior to bringing paid guests. The last thing you wanted was to lead them into a mud mire, and wildlife didn't always frequent the exact same spots from season to season.
"Today was incredible," she said, beaming beneath her wide-brimmed hat. "Never had a better trip out here, even with one guy who was an ornithologist. Thanks for getting us off the beaten path."
yet for a reason."
"I'm in!" Charlie raised a fist. "Go, Team We're Here and We're Queer!"
. I'd like to see something from Winchester in its raw state. Even if you won't pick it up, maybe..."
"You got it." Dean pointed at him and then spun toward the kitchen again. He hoped Sam still ate goulash… If the stuff he ate when they went out in Topeka was any indication, the man hadn't touched pasta in years.
. "Ug, didn't realize it was that late…" He leaned back and rubbed his face. He'd taken some good pictures at Cheyenne Bottoms that day… Maybe he could write a blog post, work in advertising his birding tours. "Okay, you get your beauty rest, Sammy. I'll switch over to blogging."
"Well, it is… but it isn't. Like, they want it to be the same plot I had but bring out the character stuff more. See, they picked it up because they liked the cast diversity and want more."
Sam opened his mouth to jump in, but Dean got there first. "Well then, guess I'll just be picking up more ecotourism jobs. Or, hey, times get really tough, I know the fast food joint on 56 is always looking for help." He threw up his hands. "Not too old to flip a few burgers, right?"
"Castiel."
"...Are they worried about the effect that might have on the survivalist sales?" she asked, mouth twisting in concern.
Sam closed the door and paused, his eyebrows shooting up. "Whoa. What's up, Dean?"
Sam settled for pulling a bitchface. "Well, I
Gabriel stopped short and did a double take at Castiel, opened his mouth, then shut it and shook his head. "Whatever!" he finally burst out.
appeared. After a short debate with himself, he answered it, glancing around to make sure no other groups were nearby to disturb.
Dean glared and then shook his head—although he did make a mental note to check online about the museum. "You know what I meant. A bit of physical activity won't kill you." He stood, wincing and hissing as his lower back protested. It wasn't appreciating the twenty non-stop hours of driving and hiking. His brother looked as though he was going to make a comment about it, so Dean gave him a hard scowl.
Dean made a pained grimace. "...I gotta be honest, Castiel. I'm bad with email. We're talking 'inbox like a black hole' bad. My agent always calls if he needs to send me something, and when I worked with Bobby Singer, he used to do the same thing." Dean paused, but the other man didn't immediately respond.  He strained his ears. Was that the wind or a sigh of annoyance…? "If that isn't your thing, maybe you could text me? Just trying to save us both some frustration here."
"You boys remind me so much of him," she said quietly. It was meant to be an apology; she couldn't have known the way it made Dean's stomach twist. "Hope I haven't soured your appetite too much for pie…?"
For a moment, the silence stretched, but there wasn't any further argument to be made that made any sense. Dean knew he was just being difficult. "All right."
"We agreed to meet for discussion in one week. Have you gotten a chance to review the email I sent yesterday?"
Dean pushes himself up a little too quickly and rubs the grit from his eyes.
Everything was still for a moment longer, then Dean pulled away and rubbed his face dry; “Okay. I need to lay down. I'm...” He didn't know if the word 'exhausted' was big enough to encompass everything he was feeling.
“If he doesn’t exist, fine,” He waves his hands in a sweeping, almost wing like motion; “Bad crap happens to good people, that’s how it is. No rhyme or reason, just random—horrible evil. I get it, Okay? I can roll with that,” He points at Sam with his funnel; “But if he is out there? What’s wrong with him? Where the hell is he while these decent people are getting torn to shreds?” He stabs particularly hard at the wadding in a few shells. “How does he live with himself, yanno? Why doesn’t he… why doesn’t he help?” He tosses a shell against the wall and leans back in his seat, twirls the funnel around and contemplates throwing that as well. Contemplates how hard he would have to stab it into his thigh before he met bone.
Dean stared at him, tried to press his hair back down and felt something untwist in his chest. Felt how tightly his grace was clinging to Castiel, and how open that connection between them was.
“It’s not a date!” Jo said loud enough that Dean could hear her.
After a moment he repeats himself.
“You keep saying that… What does it even mean?”
The Being freezes, still joined with him—takes in everything he’s feeling, all the memories, emotions and uncertainties. It’s in that instant, when nothing of the two of them is hidden, that something changes. The Being’s eyes go slowly, impossibly wide, shocked AWED—
“I’m working up to it! Cut me some slack… Like you didn’t bomb your first time.”
Dean prayed to him, asked where the hell he was. Sam did the same. He tried to return to his vessel, but Jimmy refused him, more than once.
“Guy might be the dependable type, but until we know for sure, we don’t tell him about Dean’s… About
“’s not its name…”
He tries not to look into crashed cars on the highway, tries not to notice the glow of wildfires in the distance, or the burned out remains of towns as he drives through them.
“She’s an amputee, Dean.”
“Of course not.”
“Well, thank you for the thumbnail… Real vivid—“ He snarls as another driver forgets to flick on their low beams and reaches for the switch to his spotlight. “You wanna fill in a little detail while you’re at it?”
Others believe Lucifer is a myth, refuse to accept him, or the stories. They torture for the sheer joy of torturing. They spread hatred for the pure joy of it. They, for all their faults, are just like humans in this respect. Refusing to believe what is right in front of them.
“You felt something from Cas?”

The world around him is dim, soft and warm, lit with gentle amber light that comes from nowhere and everywhere, somewhere above him he can’t seem to pinpoint in the gloom. The world beneath him is soft, comfortable, like cotton sheets washed with loving hands.
“I’m waiting!” A laugh, “Maybe this
Sam feels his mouth pull back into a grin, feels it bubble up from somewhere behind his stomach, deep in the dark bitter pit that swallowed everything he’s been trying to sew shut since he was a kid but now seems to run over and split larger at the edges in want of what he’s filled it with; “You have no idea.”
Dean flapped his hand tiredly, “If it’s so dangerous, you keep it!”
"Says the guy who ate bingbongs with dog spit on his hands."
Even the wall of crumpled blankets Dean had constructed between them hadn’t been enough to allow him true rest, even if he did fall asleep. Sleep just happened. Rest had to be achieved and he didn’t know if he could manage it with Castiel so close.
“Yeah?” He narrows his eyes, “Well, don’t,” He breathes, looks away to gather himself, then back to his brother, “You can’t help me. You don’t get it… I pray you never get it, Sammy,” That darkness he’s tried so hard the past few weeks to keep hidden is all there in his eyes, all naked and alive for Sam to see. “Things happened there—Things happened to me that I don’t ever want to remember but I will NEVER be able to forget and I can’t—I can’t put that weight on you too.”
And Castiel’s eyebrows meet his hairline, his grace gives off a static POP and the streetlight above them fizzles out.
“Okay, okay… No more cartoons.”
“What’s with that, anyway? You used to look at women’s asses all the time.”
Sam stares at him, glassy eyed and confused. “Alistair hurt you, Lilith hurt you, it’s OK to make them p—“
So, he’d talked. Bent the truth a little, but he’d talked.
“No, no… Perfect timing,” Dean motions with the flat of his hand; “Maybe you can clarify what’s more important; watching the angel’s vessel or getting a fucking coke.”
He watches him. Measures the twitches of his faces, the evenness of his voice. He steps back, stares into the corner and focuses on his breath, swallows rapidly to keep down the meager contents of his stomach, naught but whiskey now that sloshes and burns like acid all the way into his sinuses.
The content of the dreams may change, but they are always there. The worst though, are the ones that don’t involve hell. The worst ones involve sitting on a couch with a warm body next to him, smiling, laughing… only for Dean to realize that the Cas next to him isn’t real, none of it is—and it melts away to blackness, to the cold hard fact of Castiel.
For some reason he thinks of plants, the cornfields he chucked bottles of piss into; “Right where I popped up… Hell of a coincidence, don’t you think?”
“Castiel?”
He tried to swallow, couldn’t quite manage and tried again with no success, wound up coughing into his elbow and turning away from that… that Face. “Fine… I’m fine.”
Sam’s lips pull back from his teeth and his eyes widen when Dean lifts it to his face and sniffs it; “That… is the charred metacarpal bone of a newborn baby.”
D: Did you have to work today? Sorry man!
D:	"About us?"
The three hunters had barricaded themselves in Bobbie's bunker. Castiel could still hear what they were talking about.
Dean shook his head. Castiel felt his desperation, but he couldn't answer it.
After about five minutes, Dean arrived with a jug of coffee, two cups, and a warmer. "Dean! Say something! I could have helped you carry it." He took the warmer out of Dean’s hand and put it on the table.
S:	„Yeah, you just did Dean!“
The light in his hands pulsated, it nestled in his hands. When he reached the grave, the pulsating intensified.  Castiel  was instantly flooded with light and heat. The feelings of the soul flooded him and burned into his memory. 'Feelings...' He would think about it later. He now had to act quickly to reunite soul and body. It took time and effort.
Since 1997 he has been involved as an actor. He has been in a relationship with Lisa Braeden since 1998, and his son Ben was born in 2000.
He was awarded the title of Lord by the Queen of England in 2008 for his outstanding voluntary work on British soil.
The elder shook his head.
Chuck Shurley took a rhetorical break before introducing more. "The role of Beatrice will be taken over by Megan Masters, which I am very much looking forward to. We've already worked together." Applause erupted when the actress got up.
"Let's go to bed. I'm cold and I'm tired," Dean said cautiously. Cas nodded. "A good idea." Dean showed Cas his bedroom. "So you sleep and dream here?" Cas was impressed. A huge king-size bed stood on the opposite wall and filled half the room. Dean took Cas with him. He pulled him into a firm embrace. "My angel!" He threw Cas on the bed. He lay down next to him and covered them both with a cuddly blanket. He cuddled Cas, put his head on Cas's chest, and his arm around him. He had fallen asleep in seconds.
C:	"Yes. They both attend university. During the semester holidays, however, they travel a lot. They have been with Amara, my father's sister, for the last two weeks. She had brought them back yesterday, as of Monday the university starts again."
E:	"Hey warrior, shouldn't you be on the battlefield?"
"Sorry, man!" came from the door. Castiel looked up and straight into a pair of beautiful green eyes. He tilted his head to the side. He did not know if and what to answer.
His parents, Chuck and Becky Shurley, continue to work as a pair of writers.
C: I'm fine. Half of the working day is done. I always close the shop at 12 noon on Saturdays
Dean looked at Castiel from the side. He liked the idea that Castiel would be there on Wednesday. But since when did a man trigger such feelings with Dean? Castiel was the first and only one. Dean was still wondering when Castiel stopped again. "What is?" he asked.
S:	„Why not?‘
Cas took a deep breath. "Oh, man. You're just getting something of ambiguous!"
D:	"What did she say?"
Castiel Seraph (b. Castiel Thursday Shurley) was born on 20.08.1974 in Boston, Massachusetts.
Michael laughed out loud. "Well your humour hasn’t in any case fallen victim to inertia!" He sighed affectionately. "So good. Stormy times are dawning,  Castiel! Not to say we are heading for the apocalypse. The first seal was broken!"

The door to the roadhouse opened and Crowley proudly walked in. Under his arm, he had several rolls of paper. He nodded to Jo, ordered an Irish coffee, and headed straight to the regular table.
"A nice evening, yes?" asked Dean mischievously.
Dean laughed. "With us, you are in a very good company! And you don't have to apologize for anything here. When you're tired, everyone can understand that. So then until Friday?"
Through the power of union and deceit in death, a part of the heavenly power burned on the weak human body. He inadvertently left a scarred handprint on his left upper arm.
"Oh hey Charlie, you're there too!" Jo nodded apologetically across the table. "I didn't want to offend you!"
D:	„Fine. What do we know about angels?“
D:	„So Bobby was right about the witnesses. Was this some kind of a sign of the apocalypse?“
Castiel would have liked to write more but was really too tired. He didn't remember anything meaningful. So he left it at that. He took off his shoes and jacket and went straight to the bedroom, where he got rid of his other belongings. He dropped on his bed. He could also shower tomorrow morning. He was just too tired for everything. He set the alarm clock at 8 a.m., dropped his phone next to him on the bed, and immediately fell asleep.
At the bar stood Jo, who greeted him warmly. "Hey Castiel, how's it going?"
After the second bottle of beer, Dean took a shower. If he was honest, he now knew more than he actually wanted to know. But that could not be changed now.
D: I have a huge hangover!
D: Hey Cas.
C:	„But you didn’t.“
The couple separated in 2007. Ben grows up with his mother.
Dean Winchester (b. Dean Glen Winchester) was born on March 1, 1978, in  Dallas, Texas.
"What's the order boys?" asked Jo, who, as always, oversaw the regular table.
S:	„Don’t know.“
After two cups of coffee, he felt a little better. He packed a cooler bag of drinks and grabbed a few packets of crisps from the kitchen.
Sam and  Dean went to a cafe to discuss their next steps. Castiel  followed them. The café was filled with demons. They were trying to figure out who had freed Dean from hell. But Dean had no answer either.
D:	"Cas, give me some time, yes?! I have to deal with my feelings first. I've never had a relationship with a man. I have no idea what to do next."
D:	„A sign of what?“
"I don't know what about Cassie, but I like to come," Gabriel replied. Cas nodded affirmatively. Dean rejoiced and smiled.
Castiel ran it down the back hot and cold. This laughter was so wonderful, so joyful and contagious. He laughed aloud now.
The concept  was completely new to him, it irritated and distracted him. He wanted to close the fresh wound, especially as he didn't understand why  Dean  was hurting himself.
Castiel did not know where this came from. Were they feelings?
Castiel followed the faintly shimmering trail to the Hell gates. He couldn't just walk in and disappear with a soul in his luggage. He had to find another way into it.  He imprinted the signature of the thread of life and sought another entrance.
"Oh yes. Sorry." Cas continued searching and found the small box. He took the matches out of his pocket, took one out, and lit the tea light in the stump. He simply dropped the box on the table. Dean dropped the coffee and the two cups. He turned to Cas. Both were now upright against each other. Dean took Cas's face into both hands and pulled him closer.
Castiel nodded. "An old acquaintance! Well, let's give the family back their father!" Michael  shook his head. "Wait. It goes further.  John Winchester  is languishing in hell so his son can live. When the younger son died, the elder son, the same one,sells his soul to the King of the Crossroads to save the little brother. But Lilith now holds the contract.  "  Castiel  tilted his head to the side. " So I'm going to get the older son?"
C:	"I would like to see you again. But tomorrow is Monday and the
U:	"I don't know. He's not there.'
He wanted peace and quiet.
Each is already monitored by an angel. However, there is no guarantee that we will know in good time."
Dean looked at him inquiringly. " You mean the gas station and the hotel? Have you spoken?" Castiel  nodded. "Buddy, lower  the volume next time," Dean said. Castiel nodded again. "That was my mistake. Some people, special people, can endure my true appearance. I thought you were one of them.  I was wrong."  Castiel  really regretted it.
Dean nodded. "Welcome to the round!" Castiel smiled. "Thank you." Dean didn't push him any further and talked to his friends. Jo brought the whiskey. Castiel gratefully accepted the glass and emptied it in a draught.
He took a step in front of the gas station and prayed. It didn't take long and he noticed a familiar sound of flapping wings behind him. He turned around. "Michael! Thank you for coming. I need your advice." Castiel  nodded to the Archangel.
He had to completely restore the body, which had been lying in the grave for four months and had been crushed by the Hellhounds. Only in this way could  Castiel  prevent the soul from being absorbed by himself. Angels did not possess their  own  soul, because  God had created them out of light.  Thus  it was possible for  a  human soul to perceive the angel as an empty body.
"Yes, boss!" laughed Sam. "The book presentation is in the evening if you two think differently!"
Dean looked around the kitchen. „Castiel, you‘re here?“
Slowly, Castiel turned around and opened his door. He closed it behind him and leaned against it. Why did he react so much to this man? He didn't want to think about it now. He took off his jacket and shoes and dropped on his couch. He reached for the remote control for the TV and turned it on. A report was being made on the state's recent military actions abroad. His brother Michael was on display, a now highly decorated veteran. Castiel smiled. Some things never changed. He just didn't want to report it. He switched to the next channel.
Dean woke up with a headache. He had a mighty hangover. 'The sun was shining particularly loud today!' he thought.
Gabriel looked at the two men from afar and smiled. He looked at his otherwise serious brother from the distance, who seemed eternally sad, he hasn't seen him so lucky for a long time. He brought the latte and cake to the table. "Let it taste you. That's on the house!"
Castiel sat in the forge and watched  Eloy  forge a sword. He watched as the blacksmith lit the fire, heated the metal, beat and formed the iron, cooled the mold in the water bath and heated it again in the forge fire.  Eloy  was an artist and the best in his field, having been the blacksmith of the Archangels since the beginning of the time.
Castiel smiled inside himself: Dean was worried about him arriving home safely. He sighed. Dean looked after him thoughtfully. Maybe he should have brought him home? However, it wasn't long before his phone vibrated. Dean opened whats app:
The two hunters barricaded themselves in a barn and called the supposed demon. They had painted the barn with all the symbols  they  knew. Bobby  had consulted every religion of the earth and affixed all the protective symbols.
"Hm, I can't accept that," insisted Dean. Gabriel put a hand on his shoulder. "My brother's friends are also my friends. No rebuttals!"
After the picnic, they drove back to the city. Dean stopped outside Castiel's house. The front door opened and two figures came running out. Castiel had barely got out, and he was holding a young woman and a young man in his arms.
Castiel tried to get in touch again. Again, the TV and radio jumped on, even the light flickered.  Dean  woke up to the noise of the devices. The hunter looked around, what had awakened him and was immediately alarmed. He jumped up from the bed and grabbed his shotgun.
Before Castiel had correctly understood that Dean was leaving, he had already disappeared around the next corner of the house. Castiel stared at him. He stood motionless on his doorstep for a while and tried to breathe. In and out, In and out... What had just happened?
It was obvious: he didn't want to be saved, he didn't want another round on Earth. He didn't want to hold his head again, he didn't want to be Sammy's savior again.
However, as there were always other interlocutors, they did not have the opportunity to have a conversation together.  The evening was gradually coming to an end.
Cas smiled. "I really like the idea, Dean. May I turn on the radio?"
Dean blinked, Castiel was now so close to his face that he could feel his breath clearly on his cheek. He blinked again.
Dean took the top and smallest book off the stack and retreated to a chair in the kitchen. Sam disappeared with the Chevy to get cake.
"I'm sorry. I wrote to you that the flight was delayed." Dean hugged his brother. Sam accompanied his brother to the bookstore. They were greeted by a thunderstorm of lightning. He let his gaze wander through the room.
Dean fingered around in the inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out a business card. He put them on the table and pushed them over to Castiel with a newly filled shot glass. "We meet here every Friday. I'd love to have you back next week.'
Dean went to the search engine for pictures and called Castiel Seraph.
"Go to hell, disappear here!" blaffed Dean. "There's no such thing!" "That's your problem  Dean. You  have no faith." Castiel  straightened up. He spread his impressive wings to prove to Dean that he was telling the truth. Castiel knew that  Dean would probably only see the shadow that the wings threw against the wall.
C:	„Excellent job with the witnesses.“
Charlie raised his hand for an order.
„Uriel, what are you doing here?" asked Castiel, astonished.
Castiel turned to his house. In the door was Amara, his father's sister. "I'm sorry, Cas! They just stormed out of the house," she apologized.
From Monday to Wednesday, Dean spent the days on set in Vancouver and the evenings in his apartment there with Benny and Crowley.
Michael shrugged. "These are the instructions! You also asked to be assigned to a warrior. The wars on Earth are now being fought asymmetrically. That is, every demon hunter is a warrior!  The name is  Dean Winchester. Don't forget that. You'd rather go straight away!"
S:	„Helpful. Because it was Lilith who sent you to hell, not Ruby“
Dean pointed the finger at Sam.
This battle seemed to be eons behind and Castiel  bored most of the time. Since the victory over  Lucifer  and his legions,  Castiel had not gone to war. Except for a few smaller orders between the centuries,  he had not left the sky. He spent the days training in combat, studying the ancient scriptures about creation, and long walks through the eternal halls of glory. During the nights he liked to watch Eloy  do his ornate forgings.
Dean shook his head. "Unimportant."
C:	„I sincerly doubt it, but you need to know. The rising of the witnesses is one of the 66 seals.“
But this one... what was he dealing with?
S:	„Why would this CASTIEL lie to you?“
Dean dialed Cas’s number. It rang.
S:	„A demon, who’s immune to salt, devil's trap, and Rubys knife? Dean, Lilith is scared oft hat thing!“
Michael pondered. "You will need a human  vessel.   Someone who is willing to carry you in himself and who is strong enough for it. You know  we  need human consent ?!" Castiel  nodded. "Thank you."
E:	"Lilith is breaking another seal."
"You own the bookstore at the corner of the road?" asked Dean, astonished.
After showering, he tied a towel around his hip and went to cook coffee in the kitchen. He had to get rid of the hangover. The headaches slowly subsided. After the first coffee, Dean indulged in a second and a third. Gradually, he became awake and clear in his head.
D:	„Yeah. Then why didn’t you fight?“
Castiel smiled. "Chuck Shurley is my father." Dean kept his mouth open. "And the book reading on Wednesday takes place in my shop."
5.	1999: Such a disgrace
C:	"We tried. There are other battles. Other seals.“
D:	„Don’t you think, if angels were real, that some hunter somewhere would have seen one, at some point, ever?“
D:	„If you say ‚in mysterious ways‘ so help me, I will kick your ass!“
Dean shaved sharply in the air. Castiel looked sorry. Dean nodded.
D:	"See you Wednesday for the reading. After that, there is a champagne reception. There can we talk.'
D: Cas, are you there?
Angels usually did not sleep. Castiel  had a lot of time to bridge. Even though time in the sky was not linear but flowed in all directions, it did indeed passed and had to be filled with more or less meaningful activities.  Castiel  stared thoughtlessly into the flames of the forge fire.
"My name is  Castiel. Turn around! " he replied. " Show meyour face! " Pamela asked him. " No. Turn around!" pleaded  Castiel. He suspected she would not bear his sight.
E:	"And you have to make it clear to the younger one that Michael won't flinch for long when he finds out that he's doing things together with the demon Ruby."
Castiel nodded.
'After both,  John  and  Dean Winchester had struck a deal with a demon, the family shouldn't be completely alien to the concept of returning from the dead!' thought  Castiel. Why did they react so skeptically? He still had to learn a lot about people.
Eloy was gone.  He has always been a good guide. But Castiel broke his head over the question how he was supposed to finish it.
"She sits at the office and makes the billing. I would usually say, just say 'hello', but today I'd rather not disturb her in your place!" replied Jo. "By the way... were you out at Bobby’s again?"
9.	The Plight of Clownana (2003)
"Are you looking for someone specific?" Benny asked him, who stood next to him. Both smiled at the photographers. "No, it’s good," Dean quipped. Crowley joined them. "Well, have you seen the author?" he asked.
Castiel presented Dean with a picnic basket. "Hi, Dean! I made us some sandwiches and coffee." Dean picked up the basket and stowed it in the trunk next to his cooler bag.
Then he gave up. He had to process the phone call first. He would see Cas again tomorrow. And he was really looking forward to it. Had he actually made an appointment? Did it feel serious about dating? Dean shook his head. Where had he maneuvered himself into?
Adam was amazed. "Is this after the book of the same name by Chuck Shurley? I would like to get to know the author. Will he be on set? Can you introduce me to him?"
"A whiskey, please," Castiel replied, bashful nodding to Jo. "And no, you owe me nothing. I..." Dean raised his hand to interrupt him. He took a chair from the neighboring table and sat next to Castiel. He reached out to him. "Hi, I'm Dean," Castiel looked thoughtfully at his hand. However, he got in time and struck. "Castiel," he replied succinctly.
C:	„Lilith has a certain sense of humor.“
U:	"Castiel?"
Castiel had to laugh. It was really a stupid photo. He didn't like it. But it was kind of funny again. It was so DEAN. He dropped his phone on the couch. He didn't want to think about whether Dean had a place in his heart after just two days, why, how much, and where. He didn't want to...
Instead, something completely different happened. There was a realization on Dean's face. „It’s not another round of demon crap. But – it’s another round of crap at all!“ he whispered.
D:	„‘kay. I’m guessin‘ that’s not a show at Seaworld.“
When Chuck Shurley finished the reading, applause erupted. Everyone rose from their chairs and applauded. Dean liked the novel very much and obviously also to those present. The chairs have been regrouped. A question-and-answer session for journalists has been announced.
Castiel waved off. "It doesn't matter. Why are you already there? You didn't want to be here until tonight?" Amara nodded. "I didn't have to work today, so we were able to leave earlier."
Dean didn't really seem to read. He thought. About why he was liberated from hell, whether he was worth it or what was to come next. He did not believe in coincidences, he did not believe that the angels were good and wanted good from him.
S:	„They are angels. They smight first and ask questions later. All she knows is, they scared the holy hell out of her. She’s a demon and they don’t care, if she was helpful to us.“
Castiel united soul and body; he  brought the light back into the world. For the first time, he realized the significance of this    image.
"We need to talk,  Dean!" Castiel  tilted his head slightly. Dean  looked at  Bobby. "Alone! " Castiel  continued. "Your friend is alive." Castiel scrolled through a book that Bobby had left open after the ritual, so as not to be distracted by Dean's sight again.
After the house had returned to rest and the night had fallen, the men lay down to sleep.
"Dean Winchester! In my bakery. It is an honor for me. Please take a seat." Gabriel pointed to one of the tables. "What can I bring you?"
know, about us."
Dean looked at the man next to him. He seemed vaguely familiar. He just didn't know where to come from. Dean didn't want to ask him about it. It would have felt like a "shame on him." Perhaps later there was an opportunity to find out about the man next to him.
Cas turned on the radio. AC/DC roared towards him. Yes, that suited Dean, Cas thought. He looked at the other man from the side. Dean seemed restless and tired. "How did you sleep last night?" he asked him.
"Where, I know you. You sometimes sit at the bar in front of Jo. I would never forget those eyes!" Dean became aware of what he had said when the words had left his mouth. He ran red like a tomato, interrupted eye contact, and tipped his shot down.
Dean opened the laptop and entered the name Castiel Seraph into the search engine:
Dean shook his head. "The round is on you, Bradbury! You didn't want to talk about it anymore!"
"How can I help you? Is the Winchester boy doing well?" Michael  tilted his head slightly to the side. "No, it's not going well. I can't make contact with him without breaking the windows or obviously giving him pain. He can't bear my voice,"  Castiel said.
C:	“Those seals are being broken by Lilith“
But then the door to the Roadhouse opened with a loud bang and a drunk man stumbled at Castiel's feet. Castiel was terrified and made a move backward.
A quiet -woosh- could be heard. Castiel was now visible in the kitchen, leaning against the kitchenette. As always, he wore the tie loosely hanging down; the hairs were messy and the coat hung crooked on the body.
Dean took a deep breath and shook his head.
Castiel was surrounded by several demons. The space down here was limited, so he could not use his sword in the torture chamber. He pulled his dagger and went into defensive position. Then two things happened at once. Alastair fell to the ground, hit by Dean's  fist at the temple, and  Dean  jumped towards  Castiel.  Both now stood back to back and defended against the Demons. While  Dean defended himself with one of  Alastair's knives, Castiel  pulled  him further and further towards the exit.
"Hello Crowley" the choir roared amusedly.
In between, Castiel and Dean cast themselves stealthy glances. When their eyes met, they smiled.
"The tattoo is beautiful!" He tenderly brushed it.
C:	"You should show me some respect! I dragged you out of hell. I can throw you back in!“
The door opened and Castiel stood opposite him. Dean grinned all over his face. Seeing him now in front of him reassured him immensely. "Hey, Cas."
Castiel took a deep breath. "Dean, I'm sorry that I didn't even say 'Goodbye' sensibly and I'm sorry you disappeared so quickly and...  I don't know what's wrong with me right now."
Cas breathed heavily. "Do you really want that?"
When he opened his eyes again, Castiel was gone.
C:	"That's fine, Dean. If you really want to see me again, I'll keep the weekends free for you."
First the small TV jumped on behind the cash register, then the radio on the counter. Dean  became skeptical and began to spread salt on the windows. However, he had to hold his ears, so much  was Castiel's  voice. Window panes shattered, glass shattered,  Dean fell to the ground. Castiel  gave it up. He had to try differently.
"I am the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition!" answered Castiel. He was now right in front of  Dean. He looked in disbelief. "Yes. Thank you for that." He thrust  the demon knife into Castiel's heart. Castiel  left it cold. He didn't mince his words. He pulled the knife out of his body and dropped it to the ground.
Dean exhaled heavily. "I have to digest this first. That's amazing!" They kept walking. He rejoiced.
"But..." Dean tried again. Castiel put his hand on his forearm. “That's fine. After all, you paid for me last night without being asked!" Dean looked at his hand on his forearm. It was a strangely familiar feeling, a sense of connectedness. Without thinking about it, he placed his free hand on Castiel's and looked him in the eye. "Okay. You won." He smiled.
Dean looked at Cas in surprise. "Yes, why not."
Here, too, the renowned bookseller can look back on some diverting affairs. This includes actor Crowley McLeod.
Castiel took a step toward Dean. He was close to him again. Dean nodded.
The three actors and Sam went to their seats under lightning storms. On the way there, Chuck Shurley, accompanied by Gabriel met them. "Gentlemen, I look forward to a good cooperation!" He shook the hand of each of them. "Please sit down. We'll start right away.' Gabriel winked at Dean.
Dean swallowed. "So, why did you do it?" Castiel  straightened up and tightened his shoulders. "Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you!" he answered proudly. He felt Dean's hot breath in his face and the faster beating heart.
Sam shook his head. 'I didn't call her. She came to me."
"Right pocket, matches," Dean said. Castiel approached him more closely. Without thinking, he put his hand in Dean's pocket and searched for the matches. But before he found the matches, his fingers touched something else, very, very hard. He paused in the movement and looked Dean in the face. Dean immediately turned red and moaned between bitten teeth. "Cas, please. The matches! The coffee is hot. The jug slips away."
"You've become sluggish, Castiel. It's time for a new task!" Michael  sat down with him to get his attention. "Are we going back to battle, my prince?" Castiel  raised his eyes. He had asked several times if he could be assigned to a warrior on Earth.
U:	"I'm just coming from Eloy."
Dean pushed himself off the wall of the house. "When you wrote earlier that you were working today, I was kind of sorry to have harassed you yesterday. I thought a coffee would be a good excuse."
Dean woke up. He turned on his mattress and saw Castiel standing in the kitchen. He got up and slowly approached him.
Castiel noted that he was sitting at a table today with one of his favorite actors: Benny Lafitte. Gradually, he settled into a few smaller conversations and answered a few questions here and there.
Castiel shook his head. "He is a devout man. He prayed for it." "Look, Pal,  I don't buy you what you're selling here. So, who are you?" Dean  slowly became impatient. "I told you," Castiel replied succinctly. He frowned.
It was not the first time he had contact with his father's creation. But more than pity never crossed him. Father had often punished his creation, posed challenges and imposed severe trials on them. But the last contact was more than 2.000 years ago when Castiel witnessed the execution of Jesus.
It was not difficult to find the faintly shining thread. Even if it down here wasn't the only one,  so it  was individual. Castiel  followed him to a heavy iron door. He unlocked the lock and opened the two wing doors in a buoyant manner.
C:	"Hello Dean."
"Yes."
B:	„You two chuckleheads wanna keep aren’t you in religion? You wanna come take a look at this!“
C:	"Ok. I just have the wiki open and oh man! If you have any questions, ask!"
He told Cas about his dream, that he had seen Cas die. At least he remembered that very clearly. He buried his face in his hands.
Dean's writing Castiel on whats app:
Castiel did not respond. "Let's go a bit." He ran off. Dean hesitated briefly and then followed him. They walked silently next to each other for a while. "If you still have a bit of time, maybe we could sit down in a cafe and talk a little bit?" he asked Dean. He nodded. "Clearly, gladly."
"I brought the movie posters, as promised. I got 10 from the print shop. Do what you want with them." Crowley threw the bundle of paper rolls on the table.
Dean shrugged. "What does the boss recommend?"
C:	"All right. I'm looking forward to Wednesday."
Charlie waved off. "Good. I'm used to not being noticed among the hot guys here!"
Michael rolled his eyes. "That was a rhetorical question. I know that you study the scriptures of creation daily. And  Father has given us  all the word!" Castiel  became impatient. "Yes. Get to the point, great warrior. Otherwise, the battle will be fought before you have spoken the last word!"
Dean Winchester has also been trying his hand as a singer since 2018.
C:	"What does he have to do with that demon?"
C:	„Lucifer walks free.“
Dean wobbled his head. "Hold on little lion! I can't tell you. But I will try to do what I can. You’re a fan?"
Castiel was back in heaven, sitting in his armchair. Demon hunters died all over the world. He didn't know why. He tried to remember whether that indicated another seal, but he didn't get behind it.
Castiel watched the sleeping Dean for a moment. Even tonight, he didn't seem to sleep relaxed. Still, his facial features were softer than during the day. And just beautiful. Castiel moaned softly. Now there was no time for it.
He made the discarded armor, including the sword and the belt, disappear. He kept only the angel's blade, the division dagger, with him. And he was waiting for Dean.
D:	„I’m not convinced.“
"Hello Boys and Girls!" he greeted the group. He threw a hand kiss at Charlie.
"Still, it was something good to be able to fall back on when money got tight." Her voice took on a sharper edge, the authoritative tone she used when she knew she was right. "Dean, you're still making payments on that land you bought. You never know when you might need to pick up a job."
Castiel trailed off. Maybe what? He could take on a side project? He was pretty sure that would not be viewed with kind eyes, given Dean Winchester was likely to have to publish at another company.
He had been hoping for something truly revelatory, and in that respect, he was disappointed. The draft was fairly polished; Dean Winchester had obviously taken the lessons from his first editor to heart. But there were still the achingly beautiful phrases painting the scenery, the moments of authentic emotion and depth from his characters. And, to Castiel's surprise, a good deal of humor, some of it slapstick and absurd, some sarcastic. There had only been a few mildly amusing asides in
Sam's lips set into an honest-to-god pout, and it was all Dean could do not to snort in laughter. When had his little brother become such a city boy? He started counting off on his fingers. "Cedar Niles Park. Raven Ridge Park. Oregon Trail Park. I could go on. Hell, if you want a real challenge, go up to the Mill Creek Streamway Park entrance at Northgate and hop on the trail there. You can run straight to the Kansas River."
They pulled into Lawrence a little after one o'clock, parking in front of the two-story home that their mother now lived in alone. The siding had just been repainted a couple years prior, and it was a cheery moss green, trimmed in white. The old picket fence that had ringed the front yard when they were children was long gone, but the hedges were still there to either side of the steps, the same exact plants, looking a little more bedraggled every year.
"Is this
Since there wasn't much they could do about the business decisions, he tried to let Gabriel voice his frustrations without fueling more. "I'm sorry to hear that… Where does that leave
When he comes back to himself, he’s on his knees in front of Cas and the fey have formed a circle around them, a vibrating ring of light that reminds him a little of Cas’s grace before—before everything.
nearly knocks Castiel on his ass. It twists and burrows through the human’s soul, staining righteous light with shadows of shame and fear and loss and something else that Castiel shies away from before he can get too close. The mess expands more rapidly with every passing moment and he can do nothing about it
of electricity.
“Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada were leaning blue when I woke up.”
“I love you,” Sincerity ripples through Dean’s voice, each word vibrant with it.
“Cas!” he hisses, then crouches and scrambles across the space between them to shake Cas’s shoulder. “Castiel, wake the hell up.”
A little less than five years later, Dean greets his husband by slapping a thick envelope against his chest when he walks in the door. Cas takes it with a questioning sound, then lights up like a Christmas tree when he sees the government seal by the return address.
, he thinks.
“It’s a good thing you don’t get to make that decision for me,” Cas replies with a low chuckle. “Do you want to know what I think you deserve, Dean?” Cas doesn’t wait for an answer, simply ducks his head down to press a kiss against Dean’s temple.
Nope, nope, nopity-nope. They had been desperate. The entire fucking world was on the line… That hadn’t been about Dean or Cas at all, not really. It didn’t count. It couldn’t. Could it?
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas says.
Dean swallowed, feeling his heart falter in his chest. “They won’t,” he says, then: “I’m so sorry.” He scrubs at his face, then steels himself to add, “I love you, too. I’m a fucking jerk for not saying it before, and I totally get it if you want to stay here anyway. I just had to say it to your face, Cas. I had to know you heard it from me.”
They pause frequently to kiss, again and again and again. They keep at it until Dean can’t remember how to breathe and his body aches with need and the air is so dense with electric tension he half-expects lightning to arc through the room.
“No,” Dean agrees shortly. “Just passing through.”
Cas can’t have a job on a student visa, but his family sends him a stipend each month. They split the bills in whatever way makes sense at the moment and don’t think a whole lot about who pays for what, otherwise. Money seems irrelevant, somehow, in the face of supporting each other through family emergencies, overwhelming classes, food poisoning and hangovers, and the occasional broken heart.
“I don’t need you, Muller. Not your comfort, not your company, and especially not your judgment. Get out.”
“Are you
Dean steps back as they approach the bed, but only as far as he must to unlace his boots and kick them off, to wiggle out of the rest of his clothes with practiced efficiency. When he looks up, Cas is already on the bed, sprawled out with his head propped on a pillow as he watches Dean undress.
“I’m sorry about last night,” Cas says finally. “Sharing a bed with a  guy who doesn’t like guys rarely ends well. I should have taken the floor, but honestly my back was killing me, so I thought...what’s the harm, just for one night?”
“You aren’t personally responsible for every battle that humans must fight, Dean,” he says, his hand settling to cup Dean’s cheek. “If he wins, it isn’t your fault.”
Dean’s breath gradually evens out. His heart slows a little, only to pick up at an entirely different rhythm when their bodies rub together just right. Need sparks again, demanding more..more...
“Dude, what’s the hold up?” Sam asks with the kind of false-cheer that he only uses when he’s been arguing with Dean. The big hunter pushes past without further preamble, then stops short, shoulders drawing up as he takes in the intruder.
“Yes?” Cas asks in a chilly tone as he strolls out of the stacks.
“Dean.” There’s more hope and joy in that single word that Dean can ever hope to satisfy.
Cas pushes Dean’s pants and underwear down around his hips, pulling his cock and balls free as he does. The cold brick against Dean’s ass is oddly pleasant. The sight of Cas kneeling in front of him with his face flushed pink and his hair in disarray is incredible, however, the reality so, so much better than any dream vision Dean has ever furtively jerked off to in a hotel bathroom.
Cas turns eventually, however, and though tears still streak his face and he has Jack cradled in his arms like an overgrown child, there’s a light in his eyes like the freaking sun gone supernova.
Cas doesn’t stir until the sky is silver-pale to the east and the air is clammy with dew. Dean is stiff and shivering, but waves good morning nonetheless.
“What’ve we got to lose?” Dean replies with a shrug.
“Sully,” Sam agrees, and for the first time that day, his smile is genuine.
Dean pauses when his index finger hooks into the angel’s tie. Cas’s chest is moving up and down, his heart pounding so hard Dean can feel it through his shirt. Their mouths have stilled, though they remain pressed together. Abruptly he wonders if Cas is regretting initiating whatever
His surprise lasts only a minute. Then his face melts into a relieved smile and he props his hip against the sad excuse for a table. “Oh. You must be Sully’s friend?”
Dean frowns, studying Cas’s face, but then Cas kisses him and Dean’s eyes flutter shut as ecstasy-magnified sensation slams through him all over again.
, Jack’s ascension just another loss to tack onto the running list Dean’s started keeping in his head. He drinks to them every day, these ghosts of his past, of the life he’d lived because some dick in the sky decided he must.  They’d all died to put him where he is now, and to what purpose? It doesn’t feel like there was any then, and there certainly isn’t any now. Everything is gray.
“Forget what?” Charlie asks a little too brightly as she drops her bag on the table. Cas gives the red head an uncomfortable look and Dean wonders if the women orchestrated the entire evening in order to have the same conversation at the same time. It seems like something they would do.
Cas looks up from his sandwich, cheeks bulging, and Dean loses track of his thoughts for a second. He collects himself and moves on with surprising ease given the circumstances.
Castiel’s head tilts to the side despite himself. “Who are you? What are you doing here?” He asks, shaking his angel blade down his sleeve as he takes another step forward.
Dean works his shift with a knot in his stomach. He sends Cas a couple of texts early on, then checks his phone so frequently that even Charlie, queen of texting under the counter during rush, takes notice. At first she just teases him about his distraction, but once they’re cleaning together in the afternoon lull, she moves in for the kill.
For the first time in his life, Dean considers giving up. Jack’s still form, protected on all sides by the men he considered his fathers, is proof they’re living the darkest of cosmic humor, and how can he hope to fight that? Chuck could burn them all out in a moment if he wanted to, but he hasn’t. The only conclusion Dean can draw is that God doesn't want them to die, he wants them to suffer.
Dean settles into life in Heaven pretty easily. It ain’t called heaven for nothing, after all; it’s very easy to get lost in how good the place feels, because that's what you're supposed to do.
Muller drops into a nearby chair and looks between them as if calculating who she should speak to directly. Unsurprisingly, she settles on Dean. “I saw the bogeyman lurking around your motel earlier. God knows why given the shitshow earlier, but I followed him, and…he has your angel.”
he reminds himself…but then, they’re the exception, not the rule.
“Fuck you,” Dean says, ever the diplomat in the face of peril. “I want Cas.” There’s a rustle, or perhaps it’s more like static; every hair on his body stands on end.
...It feels like magic.
Cas leans against the pull at first. If Dean wants to be close again then they need to talk; they need to discuss the hurt and pain that kept them apart when they should have been closest. They need—
, Sam reminds himself.
“What is it?” Dean asks quietly, trying for all he’s worth to be as good at this as Sam and Castiel always are. He’s a people person, damn it.
When Dean wakes the next morning his mouth tastes like a dead animal and his head is quick to inform him he’s probably still drunk. He reaches for his phone and blinks sleep out of his eyes enough to see it isn’t even seven. “Fuck,” he grumbles, tossing the gadget to the side.  Memories of the night before slam back into focus as he rolls over and his entire body flushes hot at the thought. He reaches for Cas and the heat is quickly pushed away by dread when he finds only cold, empty sheets.
“Don’t be an idiot,” Cas replies.
Cas doesn’t have time to continue before a thin beam of light drops out of the rack to hover, twisting in a way that reads ‘confused’ above the counter.
“Friend, ey?” The woman squints at him. “You aren’t from here.”
“So why the snuggle fest?” Dean asks, shrugging his shoulder to indicate the covers.
Dean forgets all about getting himself off in favor of the promise of that question. He reaches for the bed stand and gets the bottle out of the drawer, then pulls a strip of condoms out as well for good measure.
“Luckily for you both,” Sam says through gritted teeth, “I think I know what the monster is.”
“We have to find a way home first, Dean.”
The witch gives him a startled look. “No,” she chokes out, shaking her head in denial. “That was the weirdest part. They—the police—they said that he hadn’t even been in there very long. He was holding the door shut, hiding, and his heart just
It’s a scar on his shoulder, runes on his ribs, grace and warmth, safety and trust. It’s a bond that Cas has only mentioned once, sarcastically, and Dean himself has only scoffed at. Right now, however, in the ethereal blue-light glow of a rising moon too large to be his own, Dean thinks he could believe that their ‘more profound bond’ might be real.
Silence returns for a time. Sam pretends to read while Cas restocks and rewrites.
He tries with every fiber of his being, but the void inside him just gets bigger. He fills it with whiskey and cries himself to sleep, most nights. Then there’s the night he realizes he can’t do it anymore, when the space inside him is too big to be ignored.
Dean chuckles against the rim of his beer bottle. “Come on, man. We’ve died like a thousand times and our adopted son is God two-point-oh, but a witch with a hard-on for DMing with real people is utterly unbelievable? Really?”
He lifts Dean’s hands to kiss his fingertips one at a time. “I’ve even let myself get used to this,” he says with a small laugh, “the way you let me touch you...the way that you touch me. How easily you tell me you love me, like it’s the only truth that matters. It’s intoxicating, Dean. I could stay here forever. ”
Cas turns his head, kisses the shell of Dean’s ear, his breath still coming in sharp puffs. He can’t seem to find words, but Dean’s okay with that because the positive answer is evident in Cas’s touch.
“The AP called Florida for Trump,” Sam says.
Dean’s at some underground rave doing his best to forget exactly how fucked the world is in the year of our Lord twenty-ten.
Dean falls on his ass, a string of profanity leaving his mouth before he can get himself under control. When he looks up, he’s surrounded by the fey.
The creature fades into view as it dies. It’s a small thing in death, resembling nothing so much as a bundle of twigs and an old potato sack tied together with twine. It’s shockingly similar to what Anya had drawn on that napkin what feels like ten million years ago, and Castiel finds himself wondering how much of its present appearance was drawn from the little girl’s imagination.
In short: Where the hell is Cas supposed to
, and every other interfering jackass who thinks they know what Cas needs more than Dean does. Fuck whatever fucked up asshole thought it would be amusing to dump them here, too. Dean is
Dean wipes his mouth on the back of his hand, then wipes Cas’s thighs off with a corner of the sheet. Then he clambers up to collapse next to Cas on the pillow.
“Anya,” Sam asks, ducking down slightly so he’s leaning his forearms on the table, “can you tell us what you saw in the storage barn at your house when you were looking for your friend Xavier the other day?”
Dean frowns, resting one cheek on his fist as he turns to face Cas head on. “So we don’t tell anyone,” he says easily. “Even Charlie thinks we’re ‘just friends’ the way Bert and Ernie are ‘just roommates,’ so we can run with their mistake and call it a day.”
“He really overdid it yesterday I guess,” Dean confirms. “Could barely stand on his own by the time we made camp, and slept like a log. Didn’t seem much better when he woke up despite that though.”
“I can’t do this without you,” Dean whispers in a broken voice, his eyes gleaming in the light of the tableside lamp. “We can talk later. I swear. Just...please?”
There are zombies in his face and decaying hands pushing and clawing for purchase on his arms and legs. The stench of brimstone and rot is so strong he wants to vomit, and it’s only growing stronger with each new stroke of God’s wrath. There’s fire and smoke and dust in the air, stones exploding with hollow thumps like bombs, and the scrabble of groping fingers on dirt and flesh sounds like overgrown spiders in the night. There is no sun, but it’s hotter than Alastair’s rack, so hot his sweat dries as soon as it appears and his skin threatens to crack with every small movement.
Grass grows sparse, poking up in tufts through stretches of broken stone and around rocks that shoot up from the ground, then sheer off at odd angles like broken glass
Neither of them say anything else, but it isn’t an uncomfortable silence. Dean enjoys just touching and being touched by Cas, reveling in the magnified senses that allow him to feel every caress like a shock to his soul.
Abruptly Cas stiffens, fingers tightening their grip on Dean’s hips, yanking him back to thrust as deep as possible, and then he can feel Cas shuddering and pulsing within him, coming undone. “Dean,” Cas cries in that moment, and that
“I’m not going to eat you or toss you out on your ear,” she says with a sigh. “We’ve had a few of your folk recently. You wear our clothes and speak our language, but you don’t know a damn thing about anything and you get all
with ferocious intent.
,” Dean says after a while. He tucks his phone into his pocket and collapses next to Cas, staring up at the ceiling with his hands over his head. “I’ve been a Knight of Hell. I’ve been to places and defeated entities these evil sons of bitches don’t really believe exist. All this time I’ve thought supernatural creatures were the problem, but the real monsters were here all along, weren’t they? How is it that I can kill Death, but I can’t stop a demented Troll doll from taking America straight back to Hell?”
Sam’s jaw drops of its own accord. “
“He looked like Lisa to me,” Castiel comments at the end. It’s inane and pointless, a desperate cover for the supernova happening in his chest at the thought that
“God damn it,” Dean snarls as he throws his pack over his shoulder.
nice,” she coos, tilting the magazine to show its contents to Castiel.
Dean’s laughter cuts off as he looks at her. “Yeah, I’ll be fine. I swear.”
Dean discovers the plants may be different, but the animals are very similar; the night he and Cas eat unsalted, slightly charred rabbit roasted on a makeshift spit over an actual campfire, he’s pretty sure he’s in heaven.
“No,” Sam says after a perfunctory check of his body.
His eyes fly open and he sits up straight. His
Cas says yes, though it takes him two weeks to do so.
They sit in silence for a moment, though at least this time it’s moderately comfortable. Sam mentally reviews the information they’ve gathered while Castiel and Dean squint at the laptop screen from opposite sides of the table, reading through the lore at their own pace.
” he starts.
The tendon in Dean’s neck pulses as he clenches his jaw, but all he says is “Sure thing, Sammy.”
Dean shoves his hand palm-first into Cas’s face. “Shuddup,” he mumbles, “I’m tired.”
Cas isn’t supposed to be there, of course, but that hardly matters. He
Cas chose to go without the trench coat tonight, Dean realizes. He changed his entire get up, actually, not that that’s terribly unusual these days. Tonight he set suit and tie aside for a soft cotton shirt and wide-bottomed pants that Dean’s never seen before but immediately likes. Cas is more vulnerable this way, more human. More...touchable, and that might be a problem, really, because God. fucking.
“You could have had Mary back.”
“Thank you,” Dean breathes past his hammering heart, then looks around. “Let’s find the water. Follow that so we won’t go in circles. Like we did in...you know.”
“But—”
Dean’s hands slap down on the table so hard the coffee mugs rattle and the person sitting two booths down visibly jumps. “Seriously, buddy?
, some petty part of Castiel’s mind reminds him. He ignores it, as he ignores so many other things that bother him.
“Cas,” he says. It’s the last, desperate gasp of a man about to raise the biggest white flag in the history of white flags. “Cas, you’re high as shit right now. Remember when we fought Famine? Remember how you wanted to eat and eat and eat, even if it killed you?”
Cas chokes on his coffee, Eileen starts laughing, and Sam throws a biscuit directly at Dean’s head all at once. Outright chaos erupts, good-natured teasing and laughter filling the Bunker for quite some time.
“You are an idiot,” Cas says, and the tension breaks like waves on a cliff.
“Nothing of import,” Cas says in his best angelic monotone. He carefully places the label and smooths it down with a thumb. He doesn’t look up.
Castiel rakes the room with grace-enhanced eyes, but finds absolutely nothing of interest. It rankles him deeply that this creature is hurting children and he can’t even see it.
blanket falls into his lap as he does; any other thought is put on hold as he traces disbelieving fingers over a tan coat that he’d last seen covered in black goo.
“So you lure humans here to feed off them,” Dean snarls, his hand inching toward his knife. “Disgusting.” He’s pretty damn sure a steel blade won’t do any good, but if he goes down, at least he’ll go down fighting.
“Shoulda told you sooner,” Dean mutters, “Couldn’t though, was too afraid,” He has his hand wormed up under Cas’s shirt, calloused fingers drawing patterns on Cas’s back. “You okay?” he asks after a bit, his voice rough with nerves. “Say something, sweetheart.”
“Okay,” Dean says, rather than voice his suspicions. “Got it. So just...head north and when I get to the caves I ask the fairies pretty please may I fetch my soulmate from their magic cavern?”
Castiel stiffens. “Doing what?” he asks, already bracing himself for heartbreak.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chants, casting about in his mind for something, anything, to distract him. “
“Christ, I’m sorry,” Cas stammers.
Dean has no right to ask and Cas has no reason to give, but suddenly the angel is
Cas nips his shoulder in sharp protest, but he pushes himself up to look Dean in the face immediately after. He’s positively
“That was
“Do you know if he loves you?”
Another time, Dean wakes in the middle of the night and sees thousands of small silver sparks dancing in the splotchy moonlight. They coalesce at Cas’s back, spreading wider and wider until Dean realizes they’re forming the shape of wings, massive against the rustling shadows of the woods beyond. He must make a sound because they scatter and he doesn’t see them again. By the time he’s washing his face the next day he decides it was a dream.
Dean had taken a bite of soup while she spoke; now he stops chewing, staring straight ahead in surprised consternation.
Cas pulls away, and Dean feels everything slip sideways, hurt and anxiety rearing their ugly heads at the loss of contact. But then he realizes Cas is just shrugging off his shirt, and Dean can finally drink in that body without fear of being caught out. His fingers explore on their own, then,  running along every line and brushing lightly over every smooth muscle. It doesn’t seem real, somehow, that he gets to touch Cas this way, but if this is just a dream, it isn’t one he wants to wake from.
“Yeah, whatever. Leave the Hallmark moment at the door, would you?” Dean kicks at his feet beneath the table and the tension breaks in the resulting scuffle. Sam lets Dean lead the ensuing conversation, not wanting to push him too hard when he’s obviously uncomfortable. It’s a little frustrating, although no real surprise, that they mostly talk about hunting and lore.
"Neither!" Sam’s watching them, eyebrows lifted and lips pursed; Dean can almost see the gears turning in his head.
The two crash together like competing storms, disregarding glass and debris, furniture and unwilling witnesses as their mouths and bodies meet for the first time. It’s uncoordinated and messy; if Sam were more vindictive, he’d be taking video for blackmail later because he's never seen Dean so completely off his game.
It roars with new strength when Cas spends half of Thanksgiving snuggled against him and feeding him pie...then retreats to his study after everyone leaves and refuses to come out for the rest of the night.
Dean was to be admired and cared for and supported at all times, but never desired, never owned, never
“Fuck off, Dean.” Unlike earlier, there’s amusement winding through the words.
The fight that follows is brief, but vicious. Castiel watches as best he can, carefully turning himself in circles on his toes to keep an eye on his friends. Muller stays out of the way for the most part—as much as she can, anyway, given the hunters need her to see—but in the end she's the one who sticks her foot out to trip the bogeyman.
It isn’t until he’s walking between the houses that something else occurs to him: there is absolutely no guarantee the people living here will understand him. There’s no guarantee they’re even human, for that matter. There’s no Stargate or TARDIS here to translate for him; this is real life. To be sure, a very surreal real life, but still, real life.
“Like… a potato sack?” Sam clarifies again after a short delay.
Their arms slide around each other easy as breathing, their legs tangle, their bodies fit together as if made for that purpose. Cas squeezes Dean’s shoulders, and in a matter of seconds his breath evens back to the slow, steady rhythm of deep slumber.
“Never freaking do that again,” he snarls as Sam pushes himself up on his elbows. Anger is the only thing he dares to let through; anything else and he might crack and break, reduced to useless emotional ash.
“Next time,” Cas says when Dean finally gets his wits back together. “Next time I will fucking
"Dean." Cas shakes his head, but before he can laugh it off, Dean grabs his shoulder and yanks him forward.
She shoos him over to sit at a table near the window, then plops the food in front of him. “Eat,” she says, settling in the stool across the table. She waits until he’s shed his pack and taken a bite or two, then adds “So tell me about yourself, Dean Winchester.”
, his carefully constructed walls crumbling like sugar in the rain. The words are coming whether he wants them to or not. “I would have. I do. You’re fucking amazing, Cas. Always thought so, dumbass. I miss- miss-” He stumbles and stammers  and gives up. Instead he reaches out, grabs Cas’s hand and slaps it, awkward and too heavy, against the spot where he’d been grabbed on his express train ride out of hell courtesy of Castiel, Angel of the Lord.
In reality it’s almost forty minutes before they leave, thanks to a dozen last minute things they need to take care of. When they finally walk outside, Dean realizes the sky cleared overnight and left them with a crisp, cool wonderland. There’s drifts of snow as far as the eye can see and icicles line every gutter, glittering in the light of the winter sun. It’s everything Dean could have wished for a December wedding, and then some, and he can’t help the happy noise that bubbles up.
“Yes, Meg,” he concedes with a laugh that doesn’t sound nearly as nervous as he feels. The two women hoot as he turns to face his friend head-on, but he barely hears them over the roaring in his ears.
it is the real bitch, especially for a bunch of bumbling adults. Thankfully,” and she tosses her head to the side, teeth flashing bright as she smiles up at her companions, “you have me.”
Cas shrugs. “Nothing.”
,” Dean says, choking on his own breath as he doubles his pace and skids across the glass-smooth floors between them.
is, and the thought hurts so much he actually flinches.
Dean cringes. His memories of the fairies are not pleasant, and he’s not looking forward to dealing with them again. “How do I get him back?”
Whoever booted their ass to Who-the-fuck-knows land took good care of them, it turns out. In addition to the clothes, they both have long, wicked-looking knives and soft leathery bags filled with water at their hip, and there are two thick packs propped against the tree opposite where Cas had been.
Dean can no longer imagine his life without that ugly trench coat hanging by the door, he realizes as they bicker and laugh through the move. He’s used to the crowded living room that already looks and smells like it time-hopped from a 60’s crash pad, and would rather saw off his leg than lose the sly smile Cas gets when he lets his dry sarcasm run rampant. There’s a sense of comfort in these things, of
“I love you, you stupid bastard,” he whispers when he breaks away. “I’ll never forget you.” Cas looks like he wants to say something, but it’s Dean’s turn to silence him. “Don’t follow me this time, sweetheart. I don’t- don’t want you to see what I gotta do to get out of here, even if you aren’t real.”
He finds himself pushing up to meet the angel’s caresses then, turning his head to accept the kisses given to him. Then all restraint is gone and Dean gives as good as he gets. Lips taste, test, and demand more; teeth nip and scrape, delighting in every shudder and groan the angel gives in return; arms and legs tangle together, fall apart, then wind together once more.
He watches the trees pass as he drives and thinks about Cas talking about bees, his arms waving wildly in his excitement. Dean thinks about liquor stores and porn on an ancient TV and the heavy scent of Cas’s cabin in that strange future world Zachariah had thrown him to. He thinks about being a demon. He thinks about Cas leaving to help Kelly and Jack. He thinks about funeral pyres and phone booths and “I will always come when you call” and Cas letting go as he leapt for the portal.
Something moves in the distance, the sharp crack of breaking sticks pulling Dean out of his reverie.
Eileen’s laughter rings through the open door, followed by a deep chuckle. Sam flinches, his fingers rubbing at his wedding ring as if for comfort.
And waits.
All resistance fails. Cas finds himself on top of Dean in an instant, their bodies awkwardly positioned but their faces mere inches apart. He shifts his weight to put one hand on Dean’s chest, and can feel his heart pounding, ragged and overwhelmed, just beneath his palm.
They go after Chuck because of course they go after Chuck, but when God himself punches him in the face, all Dean can think about is that he can’t even feel that. The blows fall and Dean thinks about Cas, and he thinks about what it would like to be done, finally, and he lets his heart crack open with the size of it. All the words he never got to say bubble up inside him and give him strength to keep standing, to keep smiling, to keep goading until Chuck gets tired of the game.
Understanding blooms inside Dean’s chest.
Muller gives an exaggerated golf clap. “I see you finally got the message,” she says.
Cas pulls away so fast Dean nearly falls off the couch. “That isn’t funny at all.”
Castiel and Sam both turn to face Dean. He’s standing in the open door, framed by the light outside, yet holding himself like he’s facing his worst nightmare.
“When the job was done, I told him I couldn’t do that again. I can’t live that lie, even for a hunt. He hasn’t spoken to me since. I can only assume he’s annoyed that I’ve tarnished his hunting experience with my...how does he put it? “Chick flick” feelings.” Cas throws his hands in the air in a gesture of frustrated dismissal.
Their mouths drift apart. Dean makes an unintelligible noise of protest, but then there’s hot breath on his throat, Cas’s mouth wet and soft along his jaw, sucking and licking like Dean’s the most delectable candy he’s ever tasted. His teeth graze Dean’s ear lobe and tug gently. Dean whimpers in response, and Cas
Dean’s eyes sting and his heart turns over painfully in his chest. He pulls away to run his tongue over suddenly parched flesh while he tries to swallow down the lump in his throat. When he focuses on Cas again, their faces are so close Dean can feel their mingled breath on his skin. “I love you so much,” Dean whispers, his fingers brushing over Cas’s jaw. “Don’t do this, Cas.”
It shows up in tingling skin, prickling heat, and dreams that leave Dean a sweaty, disheveled mess the next morning.
thing they need is that nosy parker up in their business while whatever they’re about to do goes down, and Cas is steering him down the empty street and then abruptly to the left, muttering darkly to himself.
When Dean gets to the kitchen, he finds Cas watching the pot rack with wide eyes. “What is it?” He asks.
They both call in sick.
“You deserve to be loved exactly as you are.”
, now that Cas was the one to put it there, and he knows he’ll never take it off again.
“I should have,” Dean repeats, as he takes the card back and tucks it away.
“Look, I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Don’t do what?” Cas asks, his brows drawn together in confusion. He steps back and takes Dean’s chin in his hand, turning his head back and forth like he’s looking for something. “Are you okay, Dean?”
Nothing happens.
Cas can’t seem to decide what to do with his hands, so Dean reaches up, grabs them, guides them to the back of his head, urges him to push and pull as he needs.
“No thank you.” Cas’s hands drop to his lap, where his fingers open and close like he’s trying to hold onto something only he can see. “Dean, we need to talk.”
Castiel barely hears him. He’s staring at Dean, utterly lost in green eyes and freckles.
He thinks as he feeds the dog. He’s not sure why he’s keeping her, all things considered; their life isn’t great for keeping pets and Sam’s always been the one going on about dogs. In the end she’s there, though, and he can’t let her suffer.
), but she’s clearly puzzled by Cas. She keeps peering at the angel in the intent way people with gifts sometimes do, her curiosity clear, but temporarily contained by manners or grief.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean breathes, rocking back on his heels. “Where the fuck are we, then?”
, his eyes traveling over every inch of Castiel’s face as if seeing it for the first time. “Morpheus told me you were fake,” he begins. He hedges around the details as he usually does with any sensitive subject, refusing to name emotions or thoughts that seem obvious to Castiel, but eventually the whole story comes out.
B:	„An angel can snap a soul from the pit!“
Castiel tries to talk to Dean
Castiel had never seen anything like this. A radiant light that shimmered gold and green and pulsated slightly reddish. The soul was not pure, but honorable. She was not innocent, but  righteous. She had been injured a few times and yet she had lost none of her radiance. This individuality made her so beautiful for Castiel.
As the owner of the bookstore, Castiel personally said goodbye to each remaining guest at the door. When it was Dean's turn, he said to Castiel, "I'm waiting for you outside," and just walked past Castiel. It would take another half an hour for Castiel to say goodbye to the last guest and close the shop.
Arriving in front of his house, Dean parked the car in the garage and emptied the trunk. He carelessly put everything in the kitchen and took a beer from the fridge. Then he went into the living room and dropped on the couch. On the table in front of it was his laptop.
Castiel saved himself in his refuge. Dean had looked him directly in the eyes. It was as if the other had touched him. A strange feeling of warmth and connection overcame him. There it was again! …Feelings…?!
Sam looked to the ground. "I saw Ruby."
An affair with actress Lydia Canne in 2008 gave birth to daughter Emma, who was born in 2009, fatalities in 2012.
"Yes, why?" Castiel quipped.
Dean swallowed. He had not interrogated himself. Castiel was here. But why didn't he show up? "Later!" breathed Castiel.
Castiel fell asleep on the couch and dreamed of green eyes, freckles, and cherry pie.
Castiel looked at Dean compassionately. He had to explain so much about heaven and angels. There was just no time for it.
Castiel put on his  old armor and armed himself. It was an uplifting feeling. It reminded him of old times. He had booked a trip to hell and had to be prepared for everything. For the hot basement he needs the ultra protection. For one thing, he had to get in unrecognized and come out again. On the other hand, its wings should suffer as little damage as possible.
D:	„Well, bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses, It’s nice.“

They entered the café. "Hey Bro! What a rare honor!" Gabriel stormed towards Castiel and pulled him into a hug. "Gabe, that's mine..." Castiel pondered. Dean looked at him and raised an eyebrow with a grin. “That's my friend Dean. Dean, that's my brother Gabriel." Dean reached out to Gabriel.
Castiel closed the bookstore and turned around. It was already dark and the streets were almost deserted. He breathed deeply into the fresh night air. He looked up. It was a starry night. He enjoyed the sight for a moment, then headed home.
C:	„Doesn’t matter. The seal was broken.“
Castiel  raised both arms in despair. He gave it up and shook his head. He looked sadly aside.
Dean Winchester
Castiel nodded. He knocked on the table. "Until next time!" and disappeared. Dean called after him. "Write to me if you have arrived safely at home. Otherwise, I'm worried. Not that someone throws a drunkard at your feet on the way!"
He scolded himself. "Nothing like getting out here!" His wings hurt and the armor felt like a one-man sauna.  The soul had to return to her body as soon as possible.   The mortal remains, which  Castiel had to reconstruct first, lay in the small  tomb on the clearing.
Since the second half of the 1980s, he has been working as a child model.
Thanks for reading
S:	„Dean. This is good news. It’s not another round of demon crap. Maybe you are saved by one of the good guys:“
D:	„We put those spirits back to rest.“
D: Hey, are you ok?
U:	"Have heard you could need a little help."
B:	„That symbol, we’ve seen at the ghosts, is the mark of the witnesses. They witnessed the unnatural. They don’t died at an ordinary death. These ghosts were forced to rise. They woke up in agony. Someone rose them. On purpose. It’s called the rising of the witnesses. It figures into an ancient prophecy.“
Gabriel laughed. "Latte Macchiato and Cherry Pie!" He made an expansive gesture with his hands to alert Dean to the display.
His phone vibrated.  Dean opened whats app:
He hadn’t heard the conversation between the two men, otherwise he would know.
With these words Michael left  the forge. Castiel  sighed  and  shook his head. He has been watching people for quite a while, from a distance. With interest, but still restrained. But now he should go under them  and free a soul from hell. He had to prepare well.
He spread his wings, stretched them and beat them a few times. With a snap of his finger, Castiel  wore his suit again, which he usually dyed white. Here down on Earth, however, he opted for dark blue.
Dean shook his head. "Not another round of demon crap, you told me!?"
"Hey, Kiddos." Dean raised a hand to greet them and walked to the trunk. The young people greeted back. Dean gave Castiel the picnic basket. He was unsure what to do with the information that Castiel had two almost grown-up children.
B:	„This point, Vegas money‘s on, yeah.“
He let his gaze wander through the room and discovered the soul he was looking for. He pointed to it. “Dean Winchester  must return. His work is not yet done." Alastair  laughed gleefully. "Why should I leave you my best torturer?" Castiel  shrugged. "Because it's written like that. Even you cannot stand against fate."
Dean got two coffees and went to the bookstore. However, he had already drunk his coffee empty when he arrived at the bookstore. It was just before noon. He waited outside the store, leaning against a house wall when Castiel closed the shop and wanted to leave.
"He is also your father! So keep your tongue out! You know the prophecies?!"  Michael said more than he asked. "Of course. I know every word that  Father has given to men,"  Castiel  replied firmly.
He is a published poet. His poems, including "Baby Pants" and "Old Bones," can be found in the 2008 edition of the Columbia Poetry Review. He also co-wrote a cookbook.
Castiel brought the man back to life and awakened him. Now he had to wait. The  demon hunter had to   fight hard for himself on the way to the surface.
"Hey Cas," he replied. "I, em, is everything okay between us?"
D:	"Megan? She also plays on 'Purgatory'. She's there on Wednesday.'
At the door to the bookshop, Sam was already waiting for him. "But it will be time!"
6.	2000: Blonde
"So good. We are talking about a  demon hunter with a family tradition. The family is called  Winchester. When the eldest son was dying, the father  sold his soul to none other than Azazel to save him. " began  Michael.
S:	„Apparently you are a regular guy who’s important to the man upstairs.“
U:	"She kills him."
"Who are you?" asked Dean.
"Too bad that Jo has to work today, otherwise she could sit down with us like in the old days and have a bit of fun!"  Charlie said. Everyone was humming in agreement.
D:	"No. I'm sorry about that with your wives. And that with Crowley, well, I would have liked to know beforehand, but it doesn't matter."
C:	„Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me. Why do you think we’re here, walking among you now for the first time in 2000 years?“
Castiel stopped breathing. Could he see him? Could he --feel him? Castiel did not move a single millimeter. But he couldn't resist whispering: „I‘m always with you!“
"Should it make me think that I've been the only woman in the round for months?" asked Charlie amusedly.
C:	"Uriel!"

should."
He poured coffee and milk in both. Then he turned back to Cas to give him his cup. Cas had reddened cheeks when he picked up the coffee cup.
D:	"I'm in Vancouver a lot for the next few weeks. There's our film studio. I'll probably only be at home on the weekends."
C:	"Why?"
Castiel shook his head as if to shake off all the negative thoughts.
"When a righteous man sheds blood in hell..." ruminated Castiel. "Only the righteous man who broke the seal can finish what he began..." he breathed.  Castiel  quoted from the prophecies. Michael  smiled. "Corinthians  17, Bible of Hell, the rise of  Mammon." Castiel  shook his head. "Revelation of  John,chapter 23, the rise of  Lazarus!"
7.	2001: Dark Angel
He had to go back to Dean and share the new insights. The hunter had to know that it was a fight against Lilith.
Bobby looked horrified and pulled out with a crowbar. Castiel  saw the movement from the corner of his eye and repelled it. He held the crushing in one hand and touched  Bobby's forehead with the other hand. He put two fingers on him and sent him to the ground, sleeping. He turned to  Dean.
This time Michael nodded. "Right. Dean Winchester.
2015 It is Ticking (production, director, author)
D:	„She did the spell, she rose the witnesses?“
Bobby and  Dean began searching for Sam.   Bobby had lost contact with him after  Dean's  funeral. Since  Dean knew his brother well, the search did not take long. He had the GPS of  Sam's mobile phone switched on via the telephone company and was able to locate the mobile phone.
Dean tried to reach Sam  and  Bobby in a phone booth.   Sam's  number didn't work. Bobby  didn't believe him and gave up every time. Dean  looked around and discovered an old car. He closed it briefly  and drove off. Castiel  stood in the shop and looked after the car driving away.
D:	„What else can do it?“
The tomb, located inconspicuously on a small  clearing in a dense forest area, was  relatively easy to find. But from here he had to go in search of the soul. Souls remained connected to their former body via a delicate thread of life, as long as the body was not completely rotted or, for example, destroyed by fire.
Castiel didn't have to look long for a vessel. A very devout man was praying intensely, which  Castiel was attracted to. He asked the man, Jimmy Novak, if he could take possession of his body. He explained to him how it worked and that it would be for a likely long time.
C:	„Some we’ll win, some we’ll lose. This one we lost.“
"Thank you." Dean picked up the card and immediately entered the private number into his phone. He looked up from his phone and Castiel in the face. He frowned. "Jealous? I know this view!"
Dean got up and reached out to him. "Hello, Crowley. It's nice that you were able to set it up. May I introduce my friends to you: this is Sam, my younger brother; Charlie, our software expert. She's like a little sister to me, so fingers off! You already know Benny. Adam, also a younger brother, and Cole, my comrade from Haiti in 2004. Folks, that's Crowley. We're shooting the new movie together right now."
Castiel couldn't do anything with the term 'Michael Landon'  and tilted his head to the side only slightly.
"Cas, you really don't have to feel sorry! I actually call because I wanted to ask if..., well, can we meet tomorrow?" Dean started sweating.
Dean stopped in front of a beautiful villa. It wasn't tall, but it looked very elegant. He unlocked and asked Castiel in. Castiel made big eyes. "Wow!" Dean smiled. "Feel at home! Can I offer you a coffee?" He pointed toward the living room. "Sit down, I'll come after you!"
A mistake, as it turned out right away. The series "Supernatural" with Dean Winchester in one of the two leading roles was just running there. Castiel sat in front of the TV with his mouth open. He had just sat with this man for three hours in his brother's café and ate cherry pie. He shook his head and turned off the TV. His phone vibrated.
D:	„Maybe he’s some kind of a demon. Demons lie.“
Graduation from high school in 1996
"Pfui, Cas. But these are your thoughts now!" continued Dean. Castiel had to laugh. Dean loved it when Castiel laughed. Wait, what? Dean immediately interrupted that thought process.
D:	„Lucifer? I thought, Lucifer was just a story they told at demon Sunday school. There’s no such thing.“
Benny, Megan, Sam, Gabriel, and Dean sat in the front row. Chuck sat down in an armchair that stood on a kind of pedestal from where every spectator could see him. He greeted his guests. Then he introduced the individual actors to the audience.
Dean heard a short woosh--. When he looked up again, the angel was gone.
He then went to the bathroom. He undressed and posed in the shower. Dean closed his eyes and let the water run over his head, face and back. In front of his mind’s eye, he saw Castiel's face. A shiver ran through his body. He shook. Dean set the water from warm to cold, which achieved the desired effect. He calmed down.
Dean nodded. "Sounds tempting. Let's take it." He looked at Castiel to make sure he didn't want anything else. Castiel nodded. When Gabriel disappeared into the kitchen, Dean turned to Castiel. "I'm glad you see me as a friend. We only know each other since yesterday, but I also feel that this is becoming a wonderful friendship." He winked.
"Show them to us Winchester!" cried Cole.
Dean found more information on the Internet than Castiel was willing to reveal even during their conversations. Dean, however, had to credit him for not actually having known each other for three days and that he hadn't told much about himself.
Dean looked stealthily in Cas's direction, who, thanks to the photographers, was now sitting right next to him. Cas listened smiling at the story. He, too, tried to catch a glimpse of Dean every now and then. When Chuck read out the place where Dante freed his wife Beatrice from purgatory, her eyes met. Dean immediately had a tingling sensation in his stomach. He felt his cheeks were running red. He lowered his gaze. Castiel carefully touched Dean's forearm. Megan, who was sitting on the other side, rattled. Dean looked at her. She put her hand on his other forearm. Dean sculpted his lips with a "Why? Stop it!" and she pulled her hand back. But Dean quickly realized what Megan was aiming for. The photographers were still waiting for a sensational image. Castiel also withdrew his hand.
"For the coffee and the sandwich." Cas looked Dean in the eye. "You’re welcome." He tilted his head to the side and explored Dean's face. "Do you want to talk about your dream?"
C:	"Is this a little more concrete?"
Dean laughed. "Then I wouldn't have offered it to you." He pushed Castiel in front of him. "It's only a five-minute walk! So let's go!"
they first met in hell
B:	„The apocalypse!
D:	„You were hip to all this?“
Dean shook his head. "I hardly had time in the last few weeks. We're just starting to make a new movie. I'm rarely at home before midnight, checking press appointments, checking locations, learning text with Benny and Crowley. I asked Bobby if he would like to come back to the “Roadhouse”. But he said he had to do with the renovation of the house, whatever he meant by it."
He pressed a stormy kiss on his lips. One hand wandered into Cass's neck, the other was left lying on Cass's chest. He felt the rapid heartbeat of his counterpart. Cas put his hands on Dean's back, pulling him into an intimate embrace. He answered the kiss with equal passion.
Castiel woke up.
Bobby placed a stack of books with a thump on the table.
There’s a spell who send the witnesses back to rest. Should work.“
C:	„I‘m not here to perch on your shoulder. We had larger concerns.“
"I summon you, come before this circle! "  intoned  Pamela. "I summon you, show you in front of this circle!" she continued. "I summon you, show you to me!"
Dean felt a breeze and looked around again. When he could not discover anything, he shook  his head and set out on his way to civilization. He walked an eternity under the hot midday sun  on the boiling tarmac. Castiel  followed him. They reached a gas station, whose shop was closed.
(Robert Wisdom as Uriel)
"Cool, thank you, Sammy!" Dean and Adam said in the chorus.
The boys went to a friend of Bobby Singer,  Pamela Barns, a medium. Castiel suspected nothing good. The welcome was warm. He waited to see what Pamela would do.
Dean immediately apologized before the pastry shop. "I'm really sorry. I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your brother. I just didn't think about what I was saying.'
Castiel Seraph
"What’s the matter?" Castiel  took another step toward  Dean  and tilted his head. He was now close to him. Their faces were only a few centimetres apart. He sought the answer in Dean's  eyes. He looked deep into Dean's  interior and a realization came to him. "You don't think you deserved to be saved?!"
S:	„This becomes less about faith and more about proof!“
Castiel seemed a little intimidated in the round. When Jo brought the glasses with the "Kinky Queen", Dean discreetly ordered a whole bottle of it to the table. Jo nodded narrowly and disappeared again.
D:	„Proof? There’s a god out there that gives a crap about me personally. I’m sorry. I’m not byin‘ it!“
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear. Do you want to talk about it?" he quipped.
S:	„What it could have been?“
Dean realized what he had said the moment he said it. He may have insulted the angel. He apologetically lowered his gaze and continued to speak.
Dean had an idea. He would visit Castiel in the bookstore. He stood in front of his closet and thought about how to impress Castiel. Why did this thought come to him? He frowned. When had he ever thought about something like this? Hm. He shook his head. He opted for something leger.
In the library, he searched for the book of the seven seals and found it relatively quickly. Here he also found the reference to the other seals. He had to search for it in the revelations.
After the crucifixion of Jesus, Gabriel had once again tried to make contact with the people. As far as Castiel could remember, it was a man named Mohammed at the time. He preferred, however, to wage war against the chosen people. In the end, the archangels also withdrew from the affairs of the people.
But he didn't have that in hell either. He was tormented and he tortured himself and he knew why and for what. But here and now, back on Earth, he didn't know why or for what.
E:	"Because only he can finish it. You have to support him in his fight against Lilith."
Castiel smiled. Dean had noticed him before. He felt, yes, how? He didn't know. Got noticed, flattering, probably something like that, he thought to himself.
Castiel remained calm. He moved very easily, barely noticeably a corner of his mouth. You might think he was smiling.
Cas didn't get any further. Dean had already emptied and put away his coffee cup and now cased Cas the cup and the chips out of his hands and put them on the table. He slipped closer on the couch, leaned forward, and kissed him, first tenderly, then demanding. Cas leaned in and answered the kiss passionately, opened his lips to Dean, welcomed his tongue, and fought with him for supremacy. Dean interrupted the kiss and leaned back. He looked at Cas's face. "Oh God, I want so much more, Cas. Show it to me, please."
Castiel took off his coat and shoes and looked around. Dean noticed the looking gaze. "Wall cabinet on the right chose the left door. There are handles and slippers." Meanwhile, he continued to run into the kitchen. His kitchen had a passageway to the living room, so Dean could see Castiel sitting on the couch. He smiled.
D:	"I don't know Cas, tell me."
Something stirred in  Castiel. His feathers trembled as if they remembered. At a glance, a touch...
But as far as Castiel knew, Father had completely withdrawn. For more than 2.000 years, no one had seen him, not in the Throne Room, not in the Garden of Eden.
After the ghosts had returned to their rest, the three men had a beer. Castiel had the impression that this was a kind of ritual.
Dean pulled a snout and shook his head. "Not good. I had a nightmare and couldn't fall asleep after that."
"Me, oh God, uh, I'd love to see you again. Yes." Castiel just stammered. He just felt so stupid.
Dean leaned outside the shop window and waited patiently for Castiel. "It's a pity that we were so busy tonight and didn't have time for a face-to-face conversation," Castiel began. "That's what I was waiting for. I wanted to ask if you want to come with me. Then we can have a little chat," Dean said.
Filmography:
Castiel quickly withdrew. Sam just came into the door, without a cake! Dean got angry. "What about my cake? You won't forget that!"
Castiel didn't like the fact that there was a brother. "Oh,  Michael! You forgot to mention that they are brothers!" groaned  Castiel, looking to the sky. "Brothers always make everything complicated! The best example were  You  and  Lucifer. "  He saw  Dean  and  Bobby driving away.
Dean turned his head to the side intimidated. He looked to the ground.
C:	"How?"
Castiel sharply simmered the air. "A new war is imminent if we do not avert it! What do I have to do?" He rose from his armchair and began to run up and down. "First of all, you must free a soul, the soul, from hell."  Michael  remained vague.
And you won't let him out of sight until he finishes it," Michael admonished  him. "Oh no. You can forget that! I'm supposed to play babysitter?" protested  Castiel.
Chuck finished the event well after midnight. He thanked everyone for their appearance. Gradually, the guests left the bookshop. The actors' limousines gradually drove to the hotel. Dean stayed until the end because he wanted to go home.
Jo and Dean laughed. "Another one?" Castiel shook his head. "Water would be nice."
•	Ten Inch Hero (2007)
D:	"Ok, Cas. See you on Wednesday. I have to get out tomorrow morning. Bye."
C: Arrived home safely
Castiel opened his Twitter:
"I would rather call it a skirmish. Since Father  left his beloved creation to his own devices, people have changed a lot. They no longer fight in large associations, but much more often alone. Because they can distinguish the good from evil, separate light from the dark, they are able to fight evil almost alone." Michael  sighed.
D:	„What book from?“
Castiel wanted to pull out the business card under the glass, touching Dean's hand, which had left it on the card. Dean went through a pleasant tingling and he pulled his hand away in surprise. He felt like he was running red again and was helplessly reaching for his shot glass.
C:	"And? Disappointed?"
Dean looked up and straight into  Castiel's  eyes. For the first time, he consciously looked at the other man. He looked into a pair of  wonderfully bright  steel-blue eyes. They reminded him of the  great wide  sky. He felt a strange tingling sensation  in his stomach and blinked.
D:	„You gotta get me some pie!“
Everyone was talking to everyone. Castiel took the opportunity to have an animated conversation with Benny Lafitte. Dean spoke to Megan because they hadn't worked together for a while.  On the flight from Vancouver, they didn't have the opportunity to talk.
C:	"I had the idea when you told me you had read my wiki."
D:	"Do your children live with you?"
The Q&A panel itself took another hour. Afterward, the photographers had time to take some photos. Then the journalists were bid farewell. Only the photographers who belonged to the publisher or the TV station were allowed to stay. Chuck Shurley invited to the champagne reception.
"Well, wait, if I get my hands on you tomorrow, then..." cursed Cas.
Dean shook his head. "Maybe another time. I don't want to spoil the day with gloomy thoughts."
Then he saw him, Castiel. Dean had to smile automatically. Castiel spotted him at the same moment and smiled back. Both nodded. Megan looked Dean in the face. "Is there something going on?" Dean blushed. "Please what?" Megan pointed to Castiel. Dean shook his head. "No, I think Crowley would have said something. He thought it was an old flame." Megan smiled knowingly. "I actually meant you, cowboy! But it doesn't matter now."
D:	"No. I just wanted to suggest that you can read my wiki. And maybe should. Then it's kind of compensatory.'
Castiel nodded. "I'd love to be back next Friday," he said. Then he rose. "Excuse me, but I have to slowly go home. I'm really tired and more than just drunk. In this state, I am not a good company for anyone."
Suddenly, he felt Dean  was in danger. "Sorry, I have to go! Dean... " He was gone. Michael  did not wait and returned to heaven. He knew that the problem was in good hands with  Castiel. He would beat and win this battle for heaven. As he always did.
"Good, thank you, Miss Joanna," the bookseller replied and followed Dean to the regular table.
D:	„Concerns? There were people getting torn to shreds down here. And by the way, while all this is going on, where the hell is your boss, huh, if there is a God.“
"Five Kinky Queens!" cried Charlie queer across the table.
Castiel shook his head again. Why did the elder Winchester doubt?
Dean took a deep breath. "Okay, then... until tomorrow, Cas. I'm also happy."
10.	2004:  Smallville
Castiel roared and whispered, "Stop doubting Winchester! You need your energy for more important things!"
C:	"But how does Lilith overcome the Guardian?"
Gabriel gave Dean his business card. "You can call me at any time. Whats app and Twitter I have too."
C:	"I can understand that. Are you afraid?"
C:	"Oh yes?"
He was saved because they had work for him. He should do something for them. He wasn't saved because he was worth it. And he knew that. He was afraid not to know what the angels wanted, what he should do for them. Was he, like Castiel, just a soldier on behalf of Heaven, or should he just do their dirty work?
He did not recognize himself. What had he done? Why did he behave like that in this man's presence? He turned around again and found that Castiel was still standing stiffly in the same spot and staring down.
"My father always told me 'never drink with strangers'. I think I know why now," Castiel laughed. Dean liked the warmth in Castiel's deep voice, the warmth in his laughter... He shook his head, he did not want to pursue these thoughts.
C:	"Lilith? Oh no. I should have known that it is she. It is not the Winchester brothers who break the seals, but Lilith. But why should I stay with the older brother?"
Dean swallowed.
"Cas, I asked you on the phone to give me time. And I really need that. Every time I'm near you, I have a tingling sensation in my stomach. I want to be close to you, touch you, kiss you. And I want so much more. But I don't know what, I don't know how. I want to approach it slowly, to familiarize myself with you and the situation. You are my first man, my first time, so to speak. I am not sure where this will lead. I don't know where it's going to lead, can, should, will. I can't tell you what kind of relationship we have, if and how. And when it comes to relationships, I'm a burnt kid. I have trouble trusting others and to have a partner by my side. I love my work and have little time. I can't offer you a regular life even if I wanted to. I travel a lot and am rarely at home. And I always have photographers by my neck. My privacy is limited. I can't make promises to you. I can't and won't offer you a relationship at the moment. The only thing I can give you at the moment, what I'm willing to give is honesty." Dean exhaled. He felt liberated.
Castiel wanted to talk to the demon hunter as soon as possible. A first contact was now offered. But  Dean Winchester couldn't  see him.   Castiel  began to speak to draw attention to himself.
They didn't speak for a while until Dean veered into a parking lot. "Here we can leave the car and run a little bit." Cas and Dean got out of the car. Cas took the picnic basket and Dean took the cooler bag. He left the chips in the car. I was looking forward to Cas's sandwiches.
B:	„Start readin‘!“
The sight that presented itself to him was horrible. He had ended up in the torture chamber of hell.
Sam, Charlie, Benny, Adam, Cole, and Dean sat at the regular table today.
He promised that Jimmy's family would be taken care of. Jimmy  agreed. Castiel  had found his shell. Carefully he took possession of the body, let his light flow into the man, shared his faith, and stroked his soul.
Dean let Sam carry the conversation as much as he could, making tight smiles in the right places, throwing in side comments about the move to Olathe and Sam's workaholic lifestyle. They made it through half his plate of meatloaf (probably from a box) and mashed potatoes (definitely from a box) before their mother turned to Dean.
Dean bit down harder than necessary on the mouthful of food, almost catching the inside of his cheek.
Castiel interrupted Gabriel just as his cousin was starting in on Adler's other projects. "Wait, the Winchester manuscript… What was it?"
"Better look this over in the morning…" he muttered to himself. You never knew how work done in the wee hours would look in the light of day. He turned off the lights and made his way to bed.
Charlie nodded. "I can't see a reason we wouldn't take another like that, right?"
"That's great!" It was the overly bright tone she used when she was trying to be supportive. "I know you were worried about what would happen when Bobby retired. Do you like your new editor?"
"Are you suggesting that the book could change genres?" Rowena asked.
"Easy read, for you."
Dean rolled his eyes, then got back to trying to figure out how to work in more hints and background details in ways that weren't ham-handed flashbacks. It was about twenty minutes before he hit another question about Castiel's email.
"Obviously, I'm in too," Castiel added.
the Automotive Museum."
"Gabriel…" Castiel locked eyes with him, willing him to understand. "It isn't about the plot. Or even the author. It's about the characters. There's so much potential here. I can feel it."
"Do you ever sleep?" There.... maybe a tiny bit of aggravation.
The call abruptly ended. Dean pulled back to glare at the phone, feeling a combination of disgust at himself for continuing to make a terrible impression on his new editor and indignation at Castiel's pissy dismissal. "Nice fucking morning to you too, buddy…"
was one of theirs. Technically, the various departments were pools to be shuffled as necessary, but his older cousin kept Castiel almost permanently occupied with his assignments. Gabriel had similarly claimed the time of several other employees throughout the company. He said he recognized talent and saw no problem using it when anyone bothered to question him on it, but Castiel had noticed that they all had some other traits in common… A certain interest in diversity and representation of marginalized groups, a bit of the unconventional. Charlie, who worked in social media marketing and was one of the few people besides Gabriel who bothered to try to interact with Castiel on a daily basis, had dubbed their subset of employees "Team We're Here and We're Queer".
"Yes!"
(See the end of the chapter for
There was no way he was going to have those backstory summaries done tonight, he realized. Maybe he could power through them tomorrow and get them to Castiel's inbox before close of business. Technically still Monday, right? A snippet of their conversation on Thursday came back to him suddenly in Cas's growling tones.
There was another beat before Castiel finally said, "Very well. Consider this your email notification."
Gabriel shrugged. "No clue. Only got as far as Adler. Why, you have some hidden obsession with the Wild West?"
"I didn't sit here all day. I went into the city, checked out some of the museums."
"So… How do we sell this to Gabriel?" Charlie asked, eyes darting between Castiel and Rowena.
"Of course. People talk about the people they care about, whether by name or by reference. I haven't known you for long, but I already know you have a brother who recently moved in with you. Even your backstory notes don't describe their families or relationships."
Dean couldn't stop the angry frown that fell across his face, but a large bite of meatloaf helped him hold his tongue. He hated that she was right.
Sam sighed, realizing it made sense. "Fine. But I want the receipts. I
Castiel sighed.
"While I have you," Castiel said, "we might as well go over something I noticed today: none of your characters talk about their family outside the cast of the novel."
"I think he would." Castiel said, with more surety than the evidence probably warranted. He'd have to remain confident, since this was his idea.
"Hey… didn't think you owned anything less formal than khakis," Dean joked with a grin.
That was why when his younger brother got in from work that evening, he found Dean sitting on the living room carpet with his laptop, surrounded by beat up notebooks, loose sheets of paper, and marked up printouts.
had made it onto his radar when it was published. What could have been a cookiecutter story about survival in the days of colonizing America was made interesting by the inclusion of a pair of clearly lesbian women settlers. There had also been the main character's incredibly close relationship with another male character. Word from the editing floor was that the relationship had been less vague before Singer's initial rounds of feedback. While it certainly was nowhere near the level of representation Castiel wanted to see in modern fiction, the very fact that it had been published in a traditional genre was heartening.
"What's the worst that can happen?" Charlie asked him. "People already read his last book just because there was a gay couple in it. People
It was dark again on the drive back home. Dean blasted the local classic rock station and kept time on the steering wheel, staying on the highway until he had to exit and then taking the winding roads at a more sedate pace, watching for wildlife. He'd had several close calls with deer during his life and didn't want to end up in a ditch after a long day. By the time he reached his property and pulled up to the house, it was past ten.
