one, not a ratty one, so please do amend your judgement.”
“I've had far worse than this,” said he.
“I barely did,” said he, his head burrowed in my shoulder.  “John, this conversation is all which-way-about.  It is I who should be comforting

I felt down to the marrow that somewhere here there lay a greater unsolved mystery, but I had to acquiesce.  We tramped back home and lit the fires, and cobbled up a meal together that if not quite a gourmet dish was at the least, quite fairly edible.
In the meantime, there was breakfast: smoked kippers and poached eggs.
“No, no, no.”  Irritated.  “That was the phrase that Mrs. Barker repeated to us, over and over.
It did not take him very long.  Holmes rejoined me at the table and scooped up his correspondence.  He gave the envelope close attention.
“Oh, that'll pass,” said he.  “I say, is Mycroft's brother here?”
“I would like that very much,” I said.  Holmes blinked at me.  He stubbed his cigarette, and eased himself free of the wall.
“But just imagine possessing a collection of skulls,” I said, shivering.  “How morbid.  Enough to give a fellow nightmares.”
“About an hour,” said he.  “I brought a book.”  He waved it high.  “At last, you're out.”
mean?”
“Everything,” I said.
“Not one single thing,” he said, his mouth turned down in disappointment.  “Not an invoice, nor a letter or a document that bears any relation.  It is most annoying.  But also very interesting.”
“To where?”
, did any lady ever tell you?”
“Better, yet still undignified.  I should have thought after seventeen years that you would have tired of dandling.”
Midnight, and the two of us had each retired to bed.  Holmes, quite half an hour before, and I, only just now, having banked the fading fire.  I shivered in the moonlight as I shuffled into bed.  I knew I should not sleep that night, so many thoughts and wants inside my head.  I thought that I might read; I turned to take my book for just one chapter, maybe two – and then I realised I had forgotten it, indeed had left it on the sofa in the sitting-room.
In the case: a small display of Mayan sacrificial daggers, fashioned from chert stone so according to the label.  One of these was missing; an empty space where it had lain.
“What are you doing?”
He surely must have heard my heartbeat.
I sat there for many minutes, in heady bliss at this close contact with an article of clothing so freshly worn close to his skin.  I imagined us then, both upon the bed, without our shirts; in fact without any damn discretion whatsoever.  I was thus lost within my fantasy: of my manhandling him into some pliant tangle, where he might find himself – to his surprise – imploring me to breach him without mercy, when –
He was laughing now.  “
“I would like a cup of coffee,” he confided, “but I have not the slightest clue as how to do it.”
“Let me in,” said Mrs. Oaks.  “Or I'll faint dead upon your doorstep.”
His expression was quiet, controlled.  “Nothing is wrong.  I am...”
We spent a while in consultation.  By the end of it, I found myself professing admiration for the patience that this woman showed when dealing with the despot on the upper floor.  I learned of his dark moods, his sharp impatience, and his lethargy – but also his sincerity, his honesty, his kindnesses.  Might the two sides balance out?  I could not say.  All I knew was that I had to seek him out once more, to update him on his landlady's condition.  I patted Mrs. Hudson's hand.  “I'll see you once again,” I told her kindly, “and that should find you fully well again, no doubt.”
“Allow me then to demonstrate.”  He rose, and drew me over to a bureau where he pulled a drawer and knelt down just in front of it.  He turned his head to peer at me.  “Imagine I am rummaging inside,” said he.  “The table cloths are folded; from the outside they seem fairly unremarkable, but their folds contain some letters, say, perhaps.”
He nodded.  “Well enough.  I'm anxious, now, about this.  I don't want to disappoint you.”
“Well, carry on,” said he.  “You'll find me here, asleep.”
“Yes, I am quite aware that we are close to Pall Mall,” Holmes replied.  “There is someone whom I wish to avoid who lives by here.”
His face creased, and just for a moment I thought he might weep, but he wrenched himself clear to a cold look of scorn.  “So it's true?”
“I read your note,” said he.  “You have a pretty turn of phrase.”  His tone was hard.
, John, I
“It's quite all right,” my friend said gently.  Then:  “My condolences for the loss of your dear wife.  You've been so very brave to carry on this way.”
“I don't 'sort out' people either,” said my friend.  “That is hardly my style.  How did you come by this suspicion?  A misplaced love letter?  The pair were seen in close vicinity?”
“Shot through the forehead at close range,” I said.  “There's powder on the skin.  No other injuries, or signs of any struggle.  It
Holmes, the meanwhile, was still pressed to the safe box.  I hardly dared move lest the bed springs should squeak.  At length he hissed in triumph, and with a brisk flick of his wrist the safe swung open.  His back obscured our view.  He released an exclamation.
Mummy and Dad leave early to catch a train, Mummy planting an embarrassing number of departing kisses on Sherlock and Mycroft’s reluctant cheeks, followed by Wiggins, who’d been expected to attend another party, seemingly popular amongst his Irregulars cohort. Mycroft, thankfully, is next to go, feigning work as an excuse.
“Yes, Mummy,” Sherlock murmurs in the manner of a man sentenced to the gallows.
The children’s exhibits are interactive, so Rosie has been running from station to station, breathless with excitement, poking, squeezing, and stomping on things. They can hardly keep up with her. But after a fair bit of flitting around, she finds her home at a long water basin with Rube Goldberg-like tubes and wheels demonstrating physics phenomena. The exhibit is, of course, mobbed with children, but they manage to nab spots, Rosie standing and running her hand experimentally through the rushing water in the basin, Sherlock crouching down beside her, and John standing a bit off to the side, watching them.
Sherlock watches Mrs Hudson flit about the sitting room with undisguised irritation.
“If you must know,” Sherlock begins, already regretting what he is about to say, “I’ve been tracking the progress you’ve made since you began watching those egregious YouTube exercise videos. ‘
John looks down at his lap, smiling like he has a secret.
Sherlock will never be freed from reliving this hell.
“Honestly, Holmes,” I said incredulously. “Both of your hands?” Holmes was not clumsy in the slightest, and I found his purported accident difficult to believe. Holmes did not answer me, further exacerbating my suspicions. He was taking me for a fool! “May I take a look?”
“There would be a small monthly maintenance fee,” Mycroft says.
“In my defence,” Sherlock says in the way one would speak to a slow child, halting hand still held aloft, “the jump was not meant to be humorous.”
The soft admiration on his face has taken on a distinctly murderous bent because, based on their current configuration, he is confronted with the fading scar of Mary’s bullet wound at eye-level.
him.”
John rolls his eyes, but there’s amusement tugging at the corner of his lips. “Jealous?”
John leans into Sherlock's side, pressing them together hip to hip, and stretches out his leg-with-the-bad-foot. It's good to be sitting down.
“What is it?” Molly asks eagerly.

“You were human.”
the one at fault?” Sherlock balks.
Sherlock is watching him with fascination, waiting for his response.
is for John to receive attention in the very way Sherlock has given it. John will soon, inevitably, search for a partner, a woman. A mother for Rosie. John is no longer grieving Mary--that much is obvious. He is ready, priming himself, hoping to attract a mate.
” Mummy says with authoritative finality, though her actions betray her tone as she cups Sherlock’s cheek with a soft mitten. “My baby boy. Look at you. Your grandmother would be so pleased to see you like this--settling down with someone. Living your truth. Just like she did.” Then, with clear spite, “Though it took her rather
They’d (or Molly had, really) decided to do a Secret Santa, so as to be accommodating to everyone’s personal budgets. But as with everything in life, Sherlock hadn’t been able to experience the thrill of a mystery remaining a mystery for very long. Sherlock had known John was his gift-giver the moment the man had walked through the door hours ago.

“Don’t you wish, sometimes, you could be anyone but yourself?”
he’s meant to be doing--
Lestrade blinks, then shakes his head. “Um. Right. Okay.” He looks up at the ceiling, grimaces. “
“We are absolutely not shagging in the back of your father’s car,” John says, but he is a bit out of breath and his pupils are blown wide, so Sherlock thinks the gentleman doth protest too much.
Sherlock bucks his hips harder while John scrabbles for Sherlock’s arse, squeezing the fleshiness there, but it’s not nearly enough; Sherlock wants more, wants to be
. Has never done slow. But he’s also never been with someone who’s made him want it slow and fast all at once.
While the angle is divine, John’s cock slips out twice, and when he pushes back in the second time, they soundlessly agree to manoeuver so that Sherlock is lying on his back, hips lifted, his legs in the air, while John settles on his knees between Sherlock’s legs, hands braced on either side of Sherlock’s head.
I took Holmes’s hand and padlocked the bracelet onto his wrist, as if he were then and there bound to me, then pressed a kiss to the palm of his hand.
“Hello!” Rosie says, as effervescent as ever.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know we’re friends, good friends, yeah? But. I’ve been thinking. A lot.” Lestrade smiles crookedly. Molly’s mouth is hanging agape, her eyes darting from Sherlock to Lestrade. “About us. For a while. And, you know, well...I’d really like to take you out to dinner.”
--and the car is sufficiently steamy and they are debauched and grotty and half-clothed sitting in their own bodily fluids. None of it should be comfortable (it’s not one bit), but Sherlock doesn’t give a toss, because John is smiling at him like
John looks troublingly misty-eyed. “Yeah?”
The smugness that radiates off Mycroft as Sherlock sits beside John on the loveseat makes Sherlock want to punch him square in the face.
And, apparently, somehow, it's what Sherlock wants too.
Sherlock makes a noise of acknowledgement in the back of his throat, doesn’t raise his eyes from his mobile.
A flurry of activity bursts around Sherlock--the overloud crunch of gift wrappings and trappings being balled up for disposal and the hum of excited natterings over new gifts--so he enters the cosy room he’s built in his Mind Palace in honour of John to dissect the card in peace.
It’s very much not
“A quick word!"
They are singularly absurd ideas.
Today is the happiest Sherlock has seen him in awhile. Sherlock does not want the day to end if it means no longer bearing witness to John Watson in a rare and delightfully springy state. Although, these past few months have generally seen John warming up to him, after being so remote post-Mary. John had apologised profusely for his actions that day at the morgue with Culverton Smith and Sherlock had accepted the apology, but then they’d taken (unimaginably dull) time apart until John (gloriously) asked to move back into 221b.
When they take a moment to sup in air, John’s lips quirk up. “For the record, I’d much rather kiss you than Billy.”
Sherlock could do the backs of his legs quite easily. And yet.
“Oh, yeah?” John says, nostrils flaring, hand curling into a fist on the bed. “Would this ‘good authority’ be someone who works for Scotland Yard? Who attended my daughter’s second birthday party? Who was supposed to be my fucking
There are three men at his heels, and he’s so close,
“Be gentle,” Sherlock warns her.
I could feel myself racing precipitously to release--it was not in the cards for me to last very long--and all too soon I spent myself inside Holmes.
Placing Sherlock’s hand aside, John raises himself onto his knees and situates himself between Sherlock’s legs. He braces both of his hands on Sherlock’s knees, looks up with a question on his face. “Can I--”
I did as requested, and he got to his knees and pulled my shirt overhead. The subsequent investigative touch of nimble fingers on my bare skin was incendiary and calming all the same--he skimmed up my chest, skated gently over my webbed scar, moved behind me to explore my back, and I closed my eyes and lost myself in his sensuous exploration. I had never been touched like I was an object of fascination; like an object worthy of reverence.
“Dunno. There's just--staring. A lot of it. More than normal. Your normal, that is."
Holmes held the door open for me, smiling, beatific and welcoming, and I was compelled to return a smile of similar calibre. I walked inside into the space that was now partly mine, that I was to share with my greatest and dearest companion Holmes, with no plan to diverge from the arrangement any time in the near future or, perhaps, ever, and dropped the luggage to the ground with a loud bang.
When he pulls back, he sees that Rosie’s lip is trembling. “Daddy got an
But it doesn’t stop the hateful, dreamy flutter within his chest.
John opens his eyes and finds Sherlock bending at the waist, pressing back into John’s groin and moving with a gorgeous rotation, pestling John into the wall.
“I wish I had a set-up like that.” She glances over forlornly at the empty computer chair to her right. “It’d be a dream having my man right here, next to me, all day. I’ve mates who’ve met their partners through work. Granted, some of them ended up loathing spending so much time together that they eventually got a divorce. But I can’t see that happening if he’s my ‘person,’ you know? I mean, you obviously know.”
"No," Sherlock says, defiant.
I barked out a laugh, and in turn spilled whiskey from the glass in my hand onto my freshly laundered white nightshirt. I looked down at the offending spots of liquid detestfully.
But the push-and-pull feeling recedes when John stops moving, pressed against Sherlock’s arse to the hilt, and leans down to kiss Sherlock in an incongruously chaste way, considering the state of them, just a light press of lips on lips, and Sherlock wraps his legs around John's lower back.
I stepped back, letting go of Holmes, and Holmes stepped forward and loomed over me. “If I have brightened your life, you have blinded me with your brilliance,” he said. I looked up at Holmes, eyes prickling with tears. “Now, might I convince you to kiss me again?”
"I do tend to forget sometimes that he's a detective," Sherlock drawls.
He’d almost forgotten what sex could be like: an alternative to drugs, indeed. Calmative, mind-hushing.
“Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!” Rosie is saying, and John wonders how long she's been saying it. Sherlock stops kissing him, and John, numb with delight, turns his head and finds Rosie sitting cross-legged beside them. “Sherlock’s not a frog!”
for awhile.”
Holmes, surprisingly, relented without fuss and I deftly undid the buttons, helped remove his shirt by pulling it over his head, then undid the tie of his trousers, allowed him to lean on me in order to step out of the trouser legs. Holmes did not look at me once nor speak throughout this process, hugging himself protectively when he was stripped nearly bare, opting to stare forlornly outside the bedroom window.

He wishes he hadn’t. Everyone’s looking at him now.
“Sherlock, darling?”
Lestrade’s confidence wavers. “I mean, if you don’t--”
what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Mycroft’s ‘if you break his heart, I’ll break yours’ talk. But instead it’s ‘if you break his heart, I’ll annihilate you by way of chemical weaponry and cover up your murder.’” A manic giggle slips out. “Christ, I suppose I shouldn’t have expected anything less.”
Sherlock groans. “Let me cover all bases: Irene and I have not had sex, we aren’t in love, she is
My practice was thriving and busy but every night I would retire to a flat where only dark thoughts kept me company. It was not a dissimilar experience to the three years I had spent in mourning of Holmes’s supposed death and, in that same time frame, my dear Mary’s death.
believes me?
Danny hadn’t liked being catapulted into the spotlight, so he scrambles to disappear back behind his father’s leg. Hafiz tuts, his hand returning to rest on the boy’s head, protective. “Sorry, he’s been like this since...well, since the divorce. Kind of retreating into himself, you know. We’re working on it.”
I entered the messy sitting room, familiar paraphernalia from 221b and papers with Holmes’s inelegant scrawl strewn across the floor and furniture. He considered a few papers on the settee before, queerly, raising his foot and kicking them away, imploring I take a seat, then asked if I desired tea, which I responded to in the affirmative. I sat down, placed my luggage aside feeling, finally, at peace.
anyone, you needn't worry on that score.  But my casework?  That is different altogether.  I should indeed like to discuss it any time that you see fit.  It's good to talk things through, you know.  It helps to clear things in my mind.  So, yes, and thank you, Watson, that is most kind of you.”
After breakfast, Holmes excused himself and took off to the kitchen.  The meanwhile, and at Victor's invitation we two stepped out into the early morning sun.  A delicious cooling breeze captured the soft scent of the flowers.  We strolled towards the fountain and perched ourselves upon its rim.  A shame that it was dry, perhaps, for how spectacular it should look when in proper use.  I ran a hand over the smooth, clean stone, warm to the touch, so pleasant.
Here my friend snorted, and thumped on the arm of his chair.
“You are the brother!” I said stupidly.
“Please don't sulk.”
He set it aside, and slit open the second with the blade of his pocket-knife.  Scanning the contents, he let out a low chuckle.

“Well then,” said he, and set his butter knife to movement once again.
“Yes.  I queried Dawkins about this, just to gauge his reaction.  The fellow became most enthusiastic.  He confirmed that he was practised in the art and had, in fact, held tutorial classes as a means of earning a little extra money on the side.  He would teach his students of the methods and the words that one might say, and the ways it might be used to cure various phobias and afflictions.  The pendant was his favourite tool, to suspend and swing from side to side to hypnotise the patient.  He was fond enough of the quartz point to keep it close to him to double as a jewel of adornment.”
“Of bananas,” said he in a light, winsome tone.  “Bananas and cymbals and
“What a to-do, then, eh?  But my Victor's a brave lad, he's doing well.  And he tells me that you think it a great mystery, Mr. Holmes!  Well, the best of luck with that.  I don't see anything so odd.”
.  This masterpiece I then placed within my desk for its safekeeping.  The ceremony was but two weeks away.  I shivered with the pleasure of anticipation.
Holmes outlined all our wants and needs, and when and how to do them.  The housekeeper listened carefully, and nodded at fair intervals.
“Not wholly, but in part.  Are you offended?”
“Of the... other?”
He'd caught me by the waist.  He held me tight.  “We'll sponge it down.  It's only dirt.”  He kissed me firmly on the mouth.  “
We looked into each other's eyes.
“Slow down,” I said.  “Where are we going, now, exactly?”
“I had forgotten?” I offered lamely.
We took a cab, discreetly holding hands the length of the short journey.  Once at the restaurant, alas, the place was crowded and our privacy was limited.  We made the best of this, enjoying a good dinner with red wine.  I looked around at other tables, musing if say, perhaps, that
“Thank goodness,” said my acquaintance.  “I mean, that's good.”
I was beside him in a second.  As we kissed, I threw my jacket and my waistcoat to one side.  To my delight, I felt his fingers in my shirt, undoing buttons, then the coolness of his palms upon my skin.  I pressed him down upon the counterpane, and, with some mutual wriggling, attained the middle of the bed.  I lay on top of him, and gloried in the feel of tensing muscle, heaving chest, and curling limbs.  Wrapped around me as he was, I whispered in his ear “Opossum!”.  His vivid face wreathed into smiles.
It was to Mrs. Hudson's credit that she made no further comment.  Neither did she exclaim loudly upon the partial undress of Mr. Holmes, who sat so nonchalantly at his mottled desk, a stub pencil scratching at his notebook.  By some fine miracle these past eight years, he had yet to blow us all to smithereens, despite what seemed – upon occasion – as his very best intent to.  Instead, his table bore the brunt of it, stained and woodsore, proudly stoic.
John is caught off-guard. He hopes to god Sherlock means his

“Cheers,” John says, taking the cake from Sherlock with a beaming smile.
of silverware on glass brings all talk to a halt.
Rosie catapults herself off the bed onto the floor, landing on all fours, and hops, the two French braids that Sherlock had so deftly fashioned for her--and which John may not have been able to replicate even at gunpoint--flying in the air.
The three of them join Sherlock and spread out in a circle, Greg greeting Sherlock with an rough elbow to his arm, which Sherlock does not look pleased about, and John reluctantly bounces his shoulders and shifts his weight from foot to foot in time to--whatever the hell this

and pleasure, their lips moistening, slick with saliva, tongues in mouths and hands roaming from backs to shoulders to arms to arses.
“Wow,” John says, the delighted surprise he’d wished to convey falling flat to anyone with the skill to detect it. “Hafiz. Hi.”
“Oh my god,” Mary is saying, maybe, “do you have
turns of phrase Sherlock had never thought he’d associate with John. That John had had a relationship, or a fling, with this man that stands before them. Had had a fling with a
“Shouldn’t have waited so long for...this.”
"I'm yours; with bells on."
John’s gaze is wavering between his hand on Sherlock’s chest and Sherlock’s eyes and Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock is flitting his eyes over John’s face, trying to understand how they could have possibly ended up here, wishing to penetrate John’s very grey matter.
Probably.
And he stays.
“There were just such beautiful women at Cambridge,” Mummy says. “I couldn’t stop thinking about them.”
So maybe, finally, it’s time for John to

“Yeah, well, I’m not actually an idiot, despite what you think.”
less sensitive than mine.”
“Shh,” Sherlock tells her, crouching lower, using Rosie as a cover.
“Just. Stop talking, yeah?” John says out of the side of his mouth, hoisting Rosie up, seating her on the balustrade between himself and Sherlock. “Okay.” He takes on a look of deadly calm. “Now I’m going to tell our friend in the bushes to piss off.”
It’s a monumental thing to say, for sure. Sherlock must respond in kind. He tries. “If I can, I would like to give you and Rosie everything. For as long as I live."
Sherlock glances at his watch, which reads 23:24, then glances at the state of the room. It’s surprisingly tidy for a room that’d just hosted nine people. John must have cleaned.
“I’ve got to go to the shops,” John says suddenly, springing up to his feet.
Anything that John offers, Sherlock will take.
“I’ve a case, but you just sound...I dunno. Off.”
“It’s always a yes for you, Martha!”
“Must I stroke your ego any more?”
John lowers his hand, and Sherlock’s hit with a pang of panic.
It will be quick. Not too invasive. It will be easy. It will be a test.
“A revelation, to be sure.”
Sherlock smirks and raises his glass in salute.
Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat. He turns the postcard around. It continues:
, John thinks,
Danny and Rosie exchange murmured hellos before Danny quickly returns to the sanctuary of his father’s leg.
, Sherlock isn’t entirely unbiased; he’s been attracted to John since the day they met, but he’s been attracted to many men over the course of his lifetime and had always been able to dismiss such fancies. In recent years, however, he’s found his resolve steadily disintegrating. Worse yet, in the past few weeks, Sherlock’s reptilian brain had triumphed one too many times over the logical neomammalian.
“Such as it was, or is,” he added, with a shrug.
“Shame, shame,” Gregson repeated, his mouth a moue.  “Still, you could try again tomorrow.  That is the way with crime, you know.  It is always unexpected.  And we're always glad to see you.”
“I will
An apple tart and custard, then, with a coffee pot to follow on, and brandy too.  And then we sat, replete, somehow reluctant to move anywhere but where we were, inside our booth, secluded and so intimate together.
“You didn't want what, precisely, Mrs. Barker?  And what can't you remember?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“No it isn't.”
“Good gracious, no.  Mr. Mycroft Holmes is far too occupied to grace us with his presence.  He has his staff to do all that, if necessary.  Oh-ho, you don't know much about him, then?  He's rising rapidly in government, quite powerful, considering his years.”  Lestrade looked closer at me then.  “Why do you ask?”
“Be quiet, Watson.  It rarely happens.  Oh, blast this game!  You'd shave your moustache if I requested it.”
“Whatever did you brush against,” I murmured.
“Well, naturally,” said he, with an undertone of pique.
Next day, the sun was glorious, with scarce a cloud to threaten it.  We flung the windows wide, and took deep breaths of the green air.  Today, I vowed, would bring a resolution to
I was behind him in a second, but a second is occasionally too long.  Beyond the door there was a further empty passageway.  I reasoned that my friend could not have reached the other side in such a short expanse of time, therefore he must have darted in one of the offices.  Methodically, I peeped in every one, growing more desperate with every puzzled face of every stranger who stared back at me.
believe me.  Remember all the things we said in Regents Park?”
“But we've already talked,” I said.  I wanted more of him; much more.
Holmes raised his face at last.  He looked at me.  His eyes were sad and pale.
With a free hand I roved his front, caressed his maypole through the twill, and decided that I should like to dance around it, if he were willing.  I said as much aloud, and almost broke the mood entirely.
I turned the knob.  The door resisted.
” said he.  “I am most sorry for my trespass.  I have offended in some way?”  His eyes were now straying behind me to Sherlock Holmes, who had now reached us and was standing with arms folded, a wry expression on his face.
“Holmes!” I hissed, “Those customers are still here.”
Holmes focused his attention solely on the buttered toast.  “I want to,” he said quietly.  “I want to, but it's difficult.”
“But, what?”  My tongue was tied, besides.  “I was just walking,” I said lamely.  “And then I saw you with Miss Cooper.”
“That was his daughter, Isobel,” I said, voice shaking from the shock of Holmes's fury.  “There were the five of us at dinner: Anstruther's family, and me.  I was walking Isobel to see her
He shivered.  “Oh, you wretch.”
And so much green around us!  Budding trees and bushes, flowers, tall grass, my friend's new ear-flapped travelling cap...
On other, more infrequent occasions, he would vanish from our rooms for days on end, at last returning in milder humour but still with no fuller explanation as to where it was exactly that he went.
“We shall see you back in town,” my friend replied.  “
“How beautiful,” said Stone, as he released his hold and straightened up.  “Such warmth and humour.”
“You look delectable,” I told him.
“I would far rather we talk of the theatre now, or Goethe, or Poe,” said Holmes.  “If only to save poor John here from internal combustion.”
His old ma nodded at him wistfully.
I accepted, and we shook.  I saw him visibly relax; as well relieved as I, perhaps, to renegotiate a friendship of some sort.  He didn't linger; felt it awkward to, I think.  I spent the next hour quite alone, writing up notes and filing documents.  In the afternoon I went to see Anstruther, and found him busy overseeing decorations to the hall: framed prints and mottoes on the wall, assorted curios.
“Yes, I am unmarried,” I agreed.  I leaned back too, so we were level in our scrutiny.  “And you?”
“You had jolly well better not rip it,” said Holmes, laying back as if in a near faint.  “It is a Henry Jaques, and it cost me eighteen shillings.”
We caught a cab and rattled through the streets.  I felt an ache.  Anticipating
He laughed.  “No, just the one.  Did you think
There was a silence while his finger traced the pattern on the coverlet.  “Was this your intention all along?” he asked.  “The reason why you offered me your room?”
My friend's face went through several changes of expression, neither one of which made any sense to me.
I flushed with shame.  “That's true enough,” I said.  My heart was very heavy now.
“My plans?”  He sounded just as dazed as I.
“More,” I croaked.
Gregson winced.  “I thought as much,” said he.  “You care for him, aye aye, I thought as much.  The more fool me to introduce you; I should have steered you well away.”  A pause.  “But if you want my blessing, then you both can go to hell.”
“I think so,” I said.

Mrs. Hudson would surely find them if we tossed them into the waste-paper bin.  Logic and sound reason both departed, as I yanked our window open and set them sail upon the morning breeze.
wrestle you.  I shall wrestle you to the rug and I shall inspect your arm quite forcibly.”
“Did you... read...?”
“A great many years have been packed into these boxes,” I said, with reflection.  “Our whole lives, more or less.  So much, into so little.”
I aggravate you,” Holmes said quietly.
“Then I'm glad,” said my friend, and he rose from his chair.  “I must work on my Index.  Will you stay with me here?”
“Watson, I must tell you, if your next words are '
the like of him.  My breath caught as he strode towards the sofa and regained his place upon it.
We worked our way around the room.  At some short interval he paused; I heard a soft, low exclamation.  From the depths of a small box, Holmes drew a bottle which he raised that I might see.  “Look what I found.”
“Oh,” I said, deflated.
“As for the rest of my dear family, that only leaves my brother, and I don't know where
“Do you enjoy the theatre, Doctor?”
“Good morning, Mycroft.  You're looking splendid.  I think you've lost at least an ounce of weight.”
“Might it have been an old friend, returning a favour?  If it was not his profession, he would have not raised an invoice.  Holmes, I say, I wonder if he was paid at all?”
“Miss Alice has a problem with her brother,” said my friend.  “Tell me, Watson, what do you think of Joel Dooley?”
“Sometimes I prefer you when you are asleep,” I said, without caring to elaborate.  My forkful of bacon and egg made its landing at last.  I buttered a thick slice of toast and watched Holmes as he scribbled a telegraph form.  I wondered who in all the world 'E. Bruce' could be, if they were male or female, and what involvement they could have in this affair.
.”  He rode me steadily; I thrust a little, making him cry out.  We set a pace; I grasped his hips, he ground down roughly, and we took each other brutally.  He was the first to come; he howled and called my name; and clenched himself around me, bringing me to my own pleasure, where I filled him, and I could not stop, moreover, did not want to.  We collapsed against each other; words were said, such raw, barbaric words of love.  I held him tenderly.  My heart beat with a rapture; I was lost, completely, utterly.
I stopped abruptly.  The audience stirred in mild confusion.  I stared down.  I blinked.  Holmes's handwriting, which went on for several paragraphs.  I must continue with this farce, or else must improvise, or cut my speech short at its oddest, sharpest peak.
A quiet moment while we both relived the memory.
“Letters from Everett,” I said.
“No, you're the lump.”
Sherlock Holmes yawned widely, stretching supine on the bed.  Quite naked, still, from our endeavours of the previous half-hour.  I cast a warm eye across his frame, relaxed and softening in lambency.
“Regrettably, I am,” said he.
“Yes, you had better,” said my friend.  “I'm sorry, Watson.”
“I remember now,” said Holmes.  “It was a gift from old Bartholomew.  We solved that case of his, you know the one.  His parrot swore at you.”
I joined him at his box.  “They knew?”
“What are your plans?” I gabbled out.
“So it is!” I agreed.  “Welcome home, er, Holmes.  How are you feeling, my dear fellow?”
I chuckled then to think of it.
“Mrs. Oaks!”  I was so pleased I hardly knew what I should say.
In coats and gloves and scarves we shut the front door fast behind us and walked out into the lane.  The air was still and very cold.
A left bootlace beginning to unravel from its knot.
The door swung open as we stepped onto the path, and a young maid bobbed low in curtsey, and a fellow darted out to take my bags and drop them through into the hall.  We were informed that Mycroft Holmes would greet us presently, but in the meantime if we might like to see our rooms?
We spoke with the clerks and the counter assistants.  Holmes exchanged words with the various good people as they went about their day with shopping baskets, sacks and barrows.  We rambled along the leafy lanes and stepped aside to clear the way for three young lads astride small ponies as they clattered off on morning exercise.  We learned of the neighbouring towns from the crimson-faced postman, out doing his rounds.  He, as the others, claimed not to know of any gardener, nor old lady dressed in black per our description.
“William Eldritch?”
Did I feel anger?  Yes, and towards Holmes, to my surprise.
I took the bottle of Laphroaig, refilled my glass, and drank from it.  Something was happening.  I didn't know quite what.  I took a moment to evaluate, to watch my friend discomfited, to wonder what it meant.  I assumed a girl had bruised his heart and ego long ago; he'd not recovered from the smart of it, ergo his cool disdain.  That must be it.  It did not please me to imagine that.  “You inject more than you ought to,” I said quietly.
I walked straight up to him.  He raised his head and looked at me, afraid.  “I am so sorry, John,” he said.  “I know you think the lesser of me now, and --”
Holmes sat up straight.  He drew his knees up to his chin and contemplated for a while.  I let him be; I didn't press him for an answer, or response.  I knew his mind, a little, now, and how it worked.  I knew he needed space to analyse the variables and process the result.  Before too long he nestled down beside me once again.  He burrowed in, and flung an arm around me.
“Not even remotely, Dr. Watson,” replied the jester.  “Just a bitter, sad remonstrance.  I am over it now.  I am optimistic that it needn't damage our esteemed association.”
“If you are going to repeat everything that I say then this will be an interminable conversation,” he said.  “
“Of course I will,” I said, delighted.  “What are the rules?  When does it start?”
“We all have our burdens,” my friend said, at last.  His face was reflective, but half turned away.
“But what will you do with it?”
“Are you still aerodynamic?” I asked him.  I really had to know the answer.
He all but threw himself in my direction.  He was in my arms, uncoiling like an octopus, his hands impatient,  ardent, as my own clung on for dearest life.
standards.”
“Oh, later,” said he, with a flap of his hand, springing up from his chair.  “You are always wanting to do things at the most inopportune of moments.  I have to go out now to pester Lestrade.”
By three o'clock, he had returned, a leaf-strewn whirlwind through the door, shedding coat and hat and gloves in cross abandon.
“When ma hadn't seen Augusta, only this other gentleman here,” – and he pointed to young Victor, who seemed much affected by the story – “well, I was worried and I felt even more upset.  So ma wrote another note for me, and late at night she came and popped it through the letterbox.  And now we're here, and I don't know what else there's left to say.  My mother's dead, and I feel as if it is my fault.”
On one such day, or week, in early February, of a year I am reluctant to recall, I had made my way home early from my rounds, in both poor temper and a chill.  Stomping the snow and ice from off my boots, I stomped the louder up our stairs, and had my hand upon the doorknob of our sitting-room, to hear a crashing and a heavy tread, and the key turn in the lock upon the inside.
“Yes, here we are.”
“Hallelujah,” I said dryly.
“A little better than you, I dare say,” he said, smiling.  “I suppose we should get up and search around for some hot water.”
“Well, so I am,” he said, quite serious.  “And I thought
“Such as getting dressed,” I said.  I ignored his disbelieving snort, and made my way along and then inside the parlour, and so into the bedroom to my patient, who was sitting, smiling, propped against her pillows.
We kissed discreetly, left the train, and went our separate ways to reacquaint ourselves with our own lives again, so far away from Surrey, and so remote from how we wanted them to be.
“Have you been naughty?” he enquired, as one might of a small child.  “Someone has confided to me that you have.”
I sat back in my chair and set to frowning.  “I suppose in that case, we can set Mr. Flowers aside, as his complaint was strictly marital.  Mr. Sloan, on the other hand?  He seems more than a little obsessive.”
And three minutes past, there came the knock we were expecting.  And there was Mrs. Oaks upon our doorstep, blinking up at us.
him?”  He was breathless.  “Good god, old fellow, I'm in love.”
I scanned the room as if my friend might yet be hiding in a corner.  “I do not know,” I said.  “We're settled in quite well, thank you.  I'm very glad to be here, as your brother is remarkable.”
I shrugged my shoulders.  “It might.  Theoretically, at least.”
I took the lubricant, and coated just two fingers, and I leaned into his ear.  “
“Well, what do you expect me to do?”  Holmes was standing by the shelves in his laboratory, arms laden with glass bottles and pipettes.  “I mean to say, John, it is none of our business, is it, really?”
The girl shook her head.
“Damn it all, Holmes,” Gregson exploded.  “What the flaming merry hell is going on here?”
“Wait a minute.  I need to thaw out, and I want a cigarette.  Whatever are you eating now?”
,” said Sherlock Holmes.  He took two steps towards me.  “I did not hear the bell.”
paint had now dispersed, at least, thank goodness.  Holmes stood in the plum centre of the room and looked about him.
And afterwards, I reach out to shut the lamp, to turn and curl back into his arms.
“It is bad sport to follow men into the woods,” said he at last.
, Watson.  You hone in on the... details of, er, the things...”  – and here my friend hesitated, to count off upon all of his fingers for a brief moment and then lifting his face to glare sternly – “... a
“John,” Holmes murmured to me, as we lay in bed that night, the lamp light flickering, “I do not think that a black eye was
Some few days later, I had packed all my possessions in the rooms above my practice at Upper Wimpole Street.  I'd still be working there, of course – at least, for the time being – but I was thrilled to think of 221B Baker Street as home.
“Well, very little,” he replied.  “Ramsey was the rummest sort.  I met him, once or twice, some time ago.  The type of fellow who attracts the foulest flies.  Always in some great fix or other, and entirely of his making.  If it's suicide, however, I'll be most surprised.”
“I'll change my jacket,” I said sulkily, and did so, to a lighter one.
“You're very welcome,” he replied.  He watched my mouth as it attempted to form words.  What words?  In panic, I invited him to dinner.  It was late now in the evening; I'd eaten nothing since midday.  From the corner of my eye I noticed Gregson and Lestrade both staring wide in our direction, and I wondered what a portrait we might paint, the two of us, so close and intimate this way inside the puddle of the street lamp.
“I've heard it mentioned that my eyes are too deep-set.”
We sped up the stairs, half giggling like children, and we slammed into our room.  I locked the door.
Holmes raised his chin and smiled most curiously.  “It's hard to say,” said he.  “I think I'm still acclimatising.  Ask me again this time next week.”
Adams gaped.  “How do you know?  But did he
I debated for a moment.
, and I worried at the notion that he might not want me – after all, a fellow outs himself, that's very well, but it does not always mean the fellow likes
“I hate it.  And please don't say
I felt a pang.  “Don't tease like this,” I said.  “You say that, but you flinch if I move near you.  Was it the whisky and the brandy that made you feel that way last night?”
My fellow made to lay an arm across my shoulders, but I squirmed out of his reach and made some business with the kettle for a pot of tea.  He followed me, and spun me round to face him.  “John, what now?  Why can't I touch you?”
“You're leaving?” Sherlock Holmes enquired.  “You won't be back again?”
He beamed.  “No one has
“Would you like breakfast?” he enquired.
The phial contained a liquid, deep dark red, stopped with a cork.  A label, gummed, affixed, that bore one letter: that of 'E'.
A week had passed.  Holmes had been busy with his work, and the few hours that he deigned to spend at home were spent distractedly and taciturn, immersed in books and business.  For my own part, I had contracted a foul cold, and laid abed for several days for the sole purpose of a wallow in self-pity.  Oh, a man when he is ill is not a happy sight, and I was not a happy man, denuded of the company I desperately sought.  I sulked far more than was appropriate, and I snapped at Mrs. Hudson, to my shame, when she brought cups of steaming-hot honey and lemon up two steep flights of stairs and into my cross hands.
...” from Holmes.  A minute or two later, and I heard the door wrenched open and the heavy, puffing steps of a large gentleman descending to the hall.  I waited yet, then slowly trailed down to the sitting-room.  The door was flung agape, and Sherlock Holmes was standing wretched in the middle of the room.
,” said he, “would be the most wonderful place to dispose of an enemy, John, don't you think?  A villain whom you really did object to, just imagine.  To lure the fellow there on some pretext, and then a push! –
I felt a pang of concern upon hearing those words.  Grave news of our dear young friend, Victor?  Whatever mishap could have befallen the poor fellow, after so much ill luck this past year?
“Why, what the... what?”
“Tonight,” said Holmes.  “I promise you, tonight.”
“It's best you make the break,” he said, with effort.  “It's the grandest opportunity.  Who knows, one day you'll have your own place, with your name upon the door.”
I leaned in closer, placed a finger to the pucker not yet an inch in its circumference.
, James, I know my room, you needn't follow like a puppy.  Go and see to the nice doctor.  He's a new blood.  Off you go.”
I took two steps and pulled the door open a head's width.  A man was standing there, with duffle bag in hand.  He was so striking, so extraordinary, my heart beat upside down.  I stood and gawked at him, his eyebrows raised in question, as my own danced the quadrille.
“Holmes,” I said, “you really must eat something.  The stem of your pipe does not count, my dear fellow.”
“-- You lost those too.”
“Tired,” I complained.  I peered down at my watch.  “Ugh.”  Then:  “This reminds me of Franton, for some reason.”
“Thank you,” he said.
“Well, you can thank me later on,” his brother said.  “I have to bid a fond adieu to all these
“Cast your mind back to the first time that we were here, John,” said my friend.
“We might have confirmed it if you had let me through the window, Watson,” said he.  He patted my shoulder.  “But thank you.”  He sighed then.  “Why are women always so emotional?  I wonder what the housekeeper might have had to say about the skull, if Lestrade had let her speak?  Drat him.”
I trusted that my face revealed no sign of the excitement that was now roiling from within me.  Inwardly, I also shook my head at how ridiculous I was.  A farther corner of my mind had just embarked on a small raft of minor panic sailing into a dark haze of consternation.  And thus, the state that I was in progressed throughout the day, once more left quite alone as Holmes departed for “the Yard” to see a fellow named “Lestrade”, a rhyming couplet like no other.  I napped mid-afternoon, and woke just as my friend returned.  We shared a pot of tea and the newspapers, then I excused myself.  I went up to my room and sorted through my clothes to wear.  I selected a new suit I had not worn before; I polished up my boots; I trimmed my moustache, picked my cufflinks (silver amethyst), and sat down on a chair to ponder.  By seven-thirty I was dressed, and so descended to the sitting-room to see where Holmes was at.
“Your rooms are marvellous,” I told him, “and so very well appointed.  Have you lived here very long?”
He nodded sadly.  “Yes, I know.”
been done after the fact, then had the criminal scaled the pipe a second time, to regain entry to the study from outside?  But for what reason?
,” he amended, with a nod in my direction.  “So what's this Goethe been up to then, eh?  Tell me all about him, Mr. Holmes.”
“I regret not,” replied Holmes.  “Good day, Mr. Flowers.”
Imagine, if you will:  A white-painted cottage, four-up, four-down, surrounded by farm grounds with arable soil.  Outbuildings for storage and acres for growth.  It all seemed fairly daunting to my mind.
We each laid eyes upon the other, and at precisely the same moment.  If time stood still, it over-balanced.  If the air seemed thick, it was a strangling pea-souper.
We had our interlude under the sun, and then we rose to have our picnic, before the ants could take the most of it.
,” he said.
“Yes,” I said.  “Yes.  We talked of this moment – didn't we – from so very early on.  Now we are here, and we're together, so I am happy.”
We shook hands solemnly.
My friend exhaled; he dropped his head.  “So Mycroft really stooped that low.”  He undid the cuff of his left sleeve and rolled it up, to reveal a forearm scarred with puncture-marks.  “I do.  Not all the time.  Occasionally.  A seven-per-cent solution of cocaine.”  He searched my face.  “You are disgusted with me now.”
I started to, and smiled.  “I was just thinking of the cliffs.”
The lady winked, gave me a nod.  “I know full well,” said she.  “My goodness, though, he makes me cross sometimes.  He is quite the strangest gentleman I've met in all my life.”
We set off down the street.
“Of course,” I replied, with a smile.  “In fact, I recounted the whole affair in my tale
“I read Meredith,” I said, at some far juncture in our talk.
We gasped for breath eventually.
I curled into my blankets, and I wondered why that notion did not fill me with a fraction of relief.
“You are unmarried,” he remarked.
I reacted quickly in defence, but Holmes was swifter; he grasped the wrists of the troubled man, and held him firm.  The fellow stood now, trembling, cowered, and deflated.
“Tell me,” I implored, but he shook his head, resolved.
The younger brother sighed.  “If I had a shilling for every time I've heard
The last place on this earth where I would wish to be.
I jettisoned the paper.  My soup was good; alas, the pumpkin dish was merely edible.  I waved away dessert and paid my bill, and made for home.  So that was Sunday, done and dusted.  The lurching promise of another week ahead of me.  Something had to happen.  Anything at all.
courting.”  He leaned back and smiled, an eyebrow fondly quirked.
Monday arrived to some relief, for it was the day that Mrs. Barker was returning from her bolt-hole, and who knew what she might have to say.  Holmes was pensive; I was no better, and so by ten o'clock we found ourselves again outside the Talmadge house.
“I don't know,” he said, his mouth downturned.  “I really have no idea.  Why my aunt should have had such a change of heart to bring about this... this metamorphosis... while the house still lies in disrepair, is quite beyond me.  And no-one here can explain or put me straight on anything.”
“Anybody.  Nobody.  Mr. Dawkins remains adamant that his cousin, Mrs. Barker, sent him the skull on the Thursday morning with a message that it now belonged to her and she thought that he might like it, since she had neither a use nor wish for it.  She did not ask for any money.”
Holmes jabbed at my forehead, and it took every nerve that I had not to cower.
“You could do a lot better than running around in circles at Mr. Holmes's heels,” said he.  “It makes you look like a stray pup following a lamp post, ha ha!  Does he have any work on at present?  No?  Well, shame.  No doubt our Inspector Lestrade will put him straight.”
He laughed.  “Well, I recall I said the same not long ago; yet here we are.”  He cocked his head.  “I want to know.”
.  I have made a pot of tea.  I feel quite accomplished.”
Chico squinted, and he took the bait at last.
The snow was thick outside the window.  As Mrs. Oaks waved
“Its name is Bugalugs,” said the fellow with a chuckle.  “Excuse me for my rudeness, but I simply must go first.”
The former had been placed beside a heaping dish of bacon.  For one moment I was undecided which I should reach for.
“Yes,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a patient, long-suffering sigh.  “That is correct.”  He lovingly ogled the piñata.  “It took ages to build.  It was messy, too.  Papier-mâché is a horrible medium.  And I found out that I'm scared of balloons.”  He winced at the memory.
Ridiculous man, in that unfashionable suit, all green velvet and lace, all high collar and pomp.
Post-coital, he is beautiful.  More beautiful than any man has any right to be.  His cheeks high-coloured, hair a muss, a curving smile; the sated wanton on the bed, eyes fixed upon me to my pleasure.  I do so love him.
He huffed a soft laugh.
“I would not wish to hold you up,” I said, my heart a little blue.  “We were just heading to the park.”
He beamed.  “Oh, that is excellent.  Somewhere close by, I think, so your poor gammy leg won't gripe.  Ho hum!  I think, perhaps,
I could not see.  I lit the lamp.  It was six-thirty, just.  The fellow by my side groaned low and twisted round to sling an arm across me.  “Turn that damned thing off.”
“Pish.”
“Mrs. Oaks is dead,” I told him dully, as if he did not already know.
“Remind me of the fellow, what he did, and why he might bear such a grudge after this time,” I said.
“I tapped,” I said.
I breached him gradually, his moans grew ever louder, 'til I feared that Mrs. Hudson might come knocking, surprised and anxious that her tenant be in agony or murder.  “Hush,” I said, “you have to hush!”
His tone hurt me.  “I have a little paperwork.”  I turned away.  “I shall be quiet then, as it seems I am talking too much.”
He wailed, and hooked an anchor the more firmly at my back.
Jones's eyes popped even wider.  “But that's impossible,” he said.
“What are you saying, sir?” asked he.  “You are wanting to retain me, after all of my deceit?”
“The fourth,” I said.
“Why are you sorry?” I enquired.  I glanced swiftly to my friend, but he was mute, his face inscrutable.  “Mrs. Oaks is a good lady, and a better cook.  She made us a fine breakfast this morning.”
“Watson,” said he, “in all seriousness, really?  A
Holmes opened up the first of them, and read it aloud to me.  It was from Victor Burroughs, and it carried news from Surrey: of his plans and their progression, of realised happiness and security.  Gregson would be with him every weekend, and the times that Victor was in town, well, he had already moved some possessions into Gregson's little warren so that they should not be apart.
“Watson,” he said, almost as if talking to the flames.  “Watson, have you ever been in love?”
“I live above these rooms, yes.”  A sudden thought occurred to me.  “Mr. Holmes, when I first met you, you said something strange to me, and I would like it if you might elaborate?”
Merrill Adams and the dapper Mr. Dooley had just seated at a table.  Adams waved as I passed by.  I went and sat with them.
“Apart from that, I think Mrs. Hudson may be just about done,” I concluded optimistically.  “A little more tidying here and there, perhaps.  At any rate, let us see what tomorrow may bring.”
I stamped through to the kitchen, now in an ill temper.  I deposited the baked goods on the table, and cut myself a generous piece of last night's pie.  This I ate without a napkin or a plate, dropping crumbs through to the sitting-room, where the fire was in its throes of dying out.  I jabbed it crossly with the poker, tossed a few coals upon the top, and watched it groan back into life.  I did not like to think of anyone in pain, emotional or otherwise.  In some small way I wanted to assist, and now felt thwarted in the doing so.  Distracted thus, I finished the meat pie.  I wanted tea.  Back to the kitchen, where I made a noise with every cupboard door.
And if
“But Victor's aunt was childless,” I said, reluctant, uncomprehending.
“Why ever were you thinking about bananas?”  I paused.  “And what were you wondering?”
“Only because you suffered it alone for all this time.  Holmes... oh my love, how did you manage?”
Our group of three marched on.  The birds sang in shrill harmony around us.  The air smelled sweet.  And how enjoyable a walk it was, despite the heat.
“Stolen, then.  So what are we going to do?  Why did he follow us to Surrey?”
“There can be no other possible outcome.  Have you been paying the slightest attention?”
“Oh, I don't care,” said he.  “I'm
“Is that what your Index advised you to do?”
“My Martha,” mourned poor Mr. Oaks.  “I did the best I could.  I've lost her now.”
“I was attempting to be subtle,” said my friend.  “If I had been too direct, I fear our friend would have clammed up.  That is, if he knew anything at all about the skull.  This way, I hoped to worm a little positive information.  Which, alas, was not forthcoming, but never mind.  The tree may yet bear fruit.  Did you happen to hear the discussion in which those other three were engaged?”
He nodded slowly.
“Please stop sulking,” I said slowly.  “Pass me the pot.  Don't hide the sugar.”
In order to push Langdale Pike from my mind, I mused on the events as they had developed in Surrey.  The burned note in the fireplace... the cigarette stubs... the talented gardener and the lady in black – who may or may not be the one and the same.  What good could my friend do in London, I wondered, when he was so far from the house and its circling storm?
“A three-pipe problem, it appears,” I said.
“Yes,” I said, “I think you're right.”  I paused a moment.  “Will I chance to meet your brother?”
“You are a student,” I said, smiling.
My mood was buoyant, all of Monday, despite the time seeming to drag like minutes wading through molasses.  I closed the surgery as promptly as I could, and hurried upstairs where I took a bath and changed into fresh clothes: a brand new suit, a crisp white shirt, black polished boots, and tie.  I faced the mirror and surveyed myself.  It still was early, but I'd no desire to sit twiddling my thumbs.  I left the house and walked to Baker Street, thrumming with the need to see that fellow once again.
I glanced across to the clock ticking on the mantel.
doubts that you know anything of chemistry,” I said.
Grey eyes upon me, pooled and bright.  “John...”
“Yes.”
He pushed to the safe door and reset the lock.  The panelling was moved into place.  I watched him make note of the combination.  After all of this had been done, we returned to the sitting-room where our two friends were waiting so patiently.
Still, I thought of him, and somehow filled my papers and my dockets until my first call of the day, a fellow wounded in a scuffle with an officer, and brought in yelling, dripping blood and cursing all of us to hell.  I patched him up and sent him off to be addressed.  Out in the corridor, I came across Lestrade, the little ferret-faced inspector, who was peering at the noticeboard and frowning at the pinnings.  “Ah, Dr. Watson,” he said, spying me from half a hazel eye, “I suppose you've heard the news?”
Holmes laughed, and pointed a long forefinger.  “And lo, the evidence,” said he.  “That mark upon your neck.  I'm sorry, John, it will take days to fade.  You might wear a cravat?”
We dined at Simpson's in the Strand, as Holmes had promised, in a booth that offered privacy, the restaurant half-full, and so lending us the chance and opportunity to gam.  I held his hand covertly, screened by the candles and the bottle of Bordeaux; we could not tear our eyes away.  My boot tip sought his shin and roughed it, gently, searchingly.  Our talk was fractured and sporadic, so bound up were we in our love match; such a novelty, a precious one, for both of us.
“I hopped,” he said, “but now only to find that you have stolen my berth.”
The next morning, in my room, a rasping snore inside my ear.  I twisted free of its embrace, and stood, regarding Toby stretched there in the bed, asleep.
The anticipation was acute as we made our way downstairs.  All was quiet in the drawing room.  Holmes glanced back to us and nodded, and then led the way inside.
He halted, turned back to me.  “What?”
“I doubt I will.”  My heart: a hummingbird; a cirrus cloud; a hungry, stamping bird on fertile soil.  “There's much you do not know of me.”  A Laphroaig haze as catalyst!  “
I mooned around the sitting-room, at a loss for what to do.  It was then I saw the tome upon the hearthrug, propped upright against the side of Holmes's chair.  I picked it up, glanced at the cover.  I confess I had not read it – for mental health was not my field – but my friend deemed it important, it was clear, by his twice-referencing today.  It had no marker, so I flipped past the title pages and acknowledgements to the chapter list.  I wondered which of these had fascinated Holmes:
“You were perceptive, and it made me feel...” Holmes tapered off.  “I had an impulse, and... I don't do well with those.”  He looked out of the window, nibbled crossly at a fingernail.  “I need to feel
“Excuse me, please, if you thought it was gibber,” I said, with a fleck of annoyance.  “I vote we wait until six, and then go and see what is wrong.”
“Aha!” I exclaimed, as the light dawned at last.  “Holmes, do you really want me to hit this, when you spent such a long time on its construction?”
Very obviously conflicted, he turned and left the room.  If my reaction had been slower then I believe he might have headed for the stairs and the front door.  As it was, I caught his wrist and pulled him back.  He resisted with some force.
That made me chuckle, half in amusement, half in horror.
Holmes remained silent.  I stood up.  “I've taken too much of your time,” I said.  “And Mrs. Hudson has been kind enough to stay with Max.  I'd better go and see to him, and...” my voice tailed off, for Holmes's face had set to stone; he rose now too, and watched me as I picked my hat and coat and moved towards the door.  I felt so thwarted and denied, I scarcely knew what I might do.  “Another time,” I said.  And still, the face of stone looked back at me and uttered nothing, not a word.  I left the room, collected Max, and returned home, feeling as empty and forlorn as it was possible to be.
you.”
I sighed and shook my head.  “He was quite vague about it all, and rather rude, I must admit.  He mentioned Montague Street, but only by name.”
He followed me, all discontent and pique, up the hall stairs and down the landing to the Green Room.  He would not tolerate my wry attempts at humour on the way; he huffed and grunted, and indeed did not utter another word until we entered, whereupon he flung his duffle on the empty bed and followed it thereafter.  He lay there on his back, his hands behind his head, his eyes fixed hard upon me as I dithered at the wardrobe.
“You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
“Did you step on a tack, Mr. Holmes?” asked old Oaks, as he brought through the trays and set them down on the table.  “Or have you twisted your knee?  Aye, I know what that's like.  You get to an age, and then
“John, everyone has an umbrella in their hand.  It is raining.  Oh, here he comes.  Ho hum, he's stopped again.  No, here he is.”
“Yes,” replied Victor, “I am very sure that it will.”
“No...”
“The door was open,” I explained, “and Mrs. Hudson showed me in.”
“Charmed,” offered Holmes, who looked anything but.
“Don't worry, Mr. Holmes,” said he.  “Your room will still be blue.”
I had set a stack of notebooks to one side, and was riffling through envelopes and folders when I happened to glance up towards my friend.  He caught my eye.  He seemed to start, as if his previous attention had been scuttled to one side.  I could not tell where he'd been gazing; at some point around the back of me.  I turned my head to look.  “What is the matter, Holmes?”
, I told him silently.  I fought against the guilt and shame; I tamped those feelings flat and then I tucked them out of sight, because I would not feel so guilty, and I would not feel ashamed.  I thought of Holmes's words, “
“Do I do what?”
.  I quickly washed and dressed while he still slumbered, and I fed the mutt his breakfast, and I made some toast and honey and some tea.  Toby came to join me, yawning, took his place at the small table, poured himself a cup of tea.  “You didn't wake me,” he said quietly.
as to whom they intermingle with.  There are so many cads about.”
Nine o'clock the Friday morning saw us once more along Peregrine Way.
I sprang up, upsetting not only my chair but a small paper pile.  I hastened to the door where my receptionist was hovering.  I motioned her away.
I could not tear my eyes from him – and was terrified that he should turn and notice.  But his attention was set dreamily upon the burning, crackled coals, and I decided that he would not find me out.
,” I said.  “Promise me we'll see each other
“What should we do?” I asked my friend, as I rejoined him at the gate.
The voice that emanated was thin and sibilant; I would not have matched it with his build nor to his years.  His manner was benevolent, if somewhat scattered and distracted.  I found him the most curious of specimens.
Holmes closed his eyes.  I heard his breathing, slow and deep, from my position by the mantelpiece.
“More or less,” my friend replied.  “It may not have said exactly that, but I interpreted it as such.  You TOLD me to look it up, Watson,” he said then, accusingly.  “So I don't understand why you're being so stupid.”  He scraped again at both thighs.  “Oh bother and blast it, I really do itch.”
“Come here, damn you,” I said, my voice dry and hoarse.
Holmes tapped at his head.  “My brain never slows down.  It is constantly active.  Do you have any idea what that's like, and how
He pulled up all the sashes, fanning madly at his face with the morning's Times.
“It is your curl now,” I replied, vaguely aware that this was the oddest conversation I had yet had with my odd friend.  “So whatever colour you prefer.”  I thought for a second.  “But not pink.”
Sunday morning, with a blue sky and pale sunshine, crisp and clear.  I hurried breakfast, put a lead onto my dog, and set off walking in the general direction of the park.  The air was bracing, and it helped to clear my head of all the thoughts that had so clogged it in the night: the confrontation with Tobias, and the epiphany with Holmes.  The latter made me smile; the former less so.  How might I prove my new intent to Holmes?  How would he be receptive?  Would he appreciate my subtlety, or better I be frank?  We were grown men, not gawky lads, all thumbs and elbows.  “Come on now, Max,” I said, “let's detour; he'll be home, he has to be.”
“Oh, Mrs. Oaks!” said she.  “Oh yes, I know the lady well.  She comes here often, to buy her breads and cakes, and always has a funny thing to say.  I am so glad that she has found a new position at your house.”
“Did you mention the skull to Lestrade?” I enquired.
And then, to wind them in around the jet-black wilds at front; to tease and tame, to run so lightly down the thick and docile shaft.
“Well, I might stroll into Fulworth.  I have a letter to post.  Do you need anything there?”
The village of Fulworth was fairly quiet for a late morning.  There was a bustle in the bakery, and the newsagent was occupied, but the warm and pleasant weather had the locals else engaged closer to home.  I mailed my letter, and I carried out my chores.  The green was lined with benches which encircled a small duck pond, and I took a seat on one just for a minute, on a whim.  I closed my eyes, and enjoyed the sun upon my upturned face.  When I blinked open once again, I noticed
I looked up, helpless.
The midday mail broke our attention on the matter.  Holmes sifted through the letters, with little grunts of mild displeasure or approval as he saw fit.  There was a short note from Lestrade, a longer line from Langdale Pike, the news sheet gossip-monger, and the last a textbook parcel we had ordered very recently from Barnes on Oxford Street.  The first, my friend replied to with a two word telegram.  The second met with a snort and was discarded in the fire.  The third, we both pored over for an hour in combined study.
Holmes smoked his pipe.  From time to time he cast a glance up to the mantel clock, and sighed.  He sighed again when Mrs. Hudson came to clear the breakfast plates, and yet the louder at his being told – in fond, brisk tones regardless – of there being no mail today.
“No.  It is all right.”  He leaned forward and kissed my temple tenderly.  “John--”
He kissed me again.
“No, I did not,” said my friend, “for what good would it do?  To fill his head up with nonsense, when we ourselves know so little?”
Holmes leapt from his chair and grabbed both of my arms.  “John,” he said.  “
Home was frigid, unsurprisingly.  I lit a fire, and settled down beside it with a book, but scarcely had I read a page when a light knock upon my door pulled me away.  I couldn't think who it might be; surely not Gregson (his was more forthright), nor my neighbours, whom I knew were out of town visiting family.  I hastened up and called
Holmes stubbed out his cigarette, then immediately filled and lit his pipe.  He shrugged his shoulders at my frown.  “Anyway,” said he, plucking briefly at one trouser leg to admire a coloured sock, “after all of THAT, and just when I thought I might be able to effect my escape, I was roundly informed that apparently – apparently, Watson, mark you – I was guilty of a handful of domestic crimes that could not go unpunished.”
We did retire early – rather needless to say – but it was only to sleep, or do the best that we could.  We lay side by side in the grey of our room, with the last embers of warmth stretching out from the fire.  Somewhere, outside, a dog barked.  The wind rattled at the window.  My friend breathed soft beside me, with the yawning gape of wakefulness set fast upon us both.
I was not sure what else to say.
“I didn't bring a dinner jacket,” he confessed.  “I didn't really see the point.”
“Your silly, floppy hair,” said Holmes.  He was enjoying himself now.
Holmes burst in from the landing with a telegraph envelope in his hand.
Holmes froze.  His hand, which was reaching out across the sheets, retracted sharply.
“I don't believe she was aware that it had vanished,” I said.  “She seemed very distraught.  Well, Holmes, what do we do now?”
“A cameo brooch.  I procured it at Dawkins'.”
that I would show up.  I am sparing him the agony of having to send for me.”
“I see some books,” I said.
We sorted through the mail pile as we waited for the tea to brew.  There was a letter from our young friend, Jacob Jones.  He was excited to inform us that his dog Bess expected pups, and if we wanted, when the day came, would we care to take our pick?  Holmes grunted non-committally.  I resolved to twist his arm nearer the time, for I had long yearned for a pup of any breed to raise and train.
“I do hate to say I-told-you-so,” I said, “but something evidently has.”
“I brought photographs to show her,” she added softly, and she stroked her leather bag.
And afterwards, we wrapped around each other.
“I have absolutely no idea,” I said.  “I think from one of my arthritic patients.  I can't read their writing.”  I beamed happily.  “It's my first card this year.”
“Take me, John, please.  Any way that you'd like.”
He uncurled from his tight ball and stretched his limbs and scratched his head.
“Well, Watson, chew on this,” said he.  “The damage to the drainpipe was done after the fact.”
“Suicide.  Or murder.  That's what we must find out.  Shot through the head, at any rate.  I'm off out there now to take a look.”  The inspector shook his head as though this were a weary chore he had to do.  “I've called in a consultant, because we'll need his help, I think.  It's an important case.”
I drew back a fraction, red-faced.
“I'll be the judge of that,” I said.  We went through to her parlour, and I opened up my doctor's bag.  “Your temperature is down, that is quite excellent,” I said.  “I'd recommend you take things slowly for a day or two, but otherwise, I'm very pleased.”
And we trailed our way back down towards the town, to pack our bags, and dress for dinner.
“I think perhaps I might have met my match,” said Holmes, as he now dithered with the bacon dish.  “I have the
“Oh, well, that's Mycroft and his madness,” said my friend.  “At least
The fellow started, all wide eyes and puzzled face.  “Oh dear,” said he.  “Then I am sorry.”
“Well, here you are,” said he, “and whatever are you doing?”
“It's still too early,” he said, yawning.  “I don't want to go to sleep.”

“It is from the Coroner's office,” said he.  “They have completed the last of their tests.  It

“Is that Laphroaig?” I asked, impressed.  “How did it get there?”
“Oh, well, it all makes sense now.”

“That's half the fun,” said my companion.  “He's ripe enough, you must admit.”

“The fellow out there on the street, the one who's dithering by the postbox.  He's looking up this way, you see him now?”
He was standing at the work-bench, hunched and frowning.  In the middle, on the ground, was a small structure, four legs high and five slats 'round.
“Uh oh,” he said.
.  Any further misdemeanours, and I'll be for it, no mistake.”  Holmes looked at me.  “So, my last chance is here at Baker Street, with you.”  He laughed again and shook his head.  A pause.  “What do you think of me now?”
“Well, then.”
“I am sure they will be fine,” I said.  “Then you will study them, and research them, and write your monograph, or book, or
to be.  Love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things.”
“I heard you teasing Mr. Holmes,” said she.  “He won't like that, you know.”
My friend smiled.  “Overworked and underpaid, as he never ceases to inform me.  I rather enjoy his correspondence all the same.  We should pop in to Scotland Yard next week to see him, John.”
“Ah, Dawkins, do allow me to continue,” said he, smiling.  “You are confusing our two friends here.”  Stone addressed us: “It is a meditative session.  The skull is a very old and precious stone.  Mr. Dawkins hopes to tour with it, but for the moment it remains here where stone enthusiasts – like us – can share some space and time and thought.”
I am,” I said, still huffing, “in my wish to not cause harm to any animal, either direct or inadvertent.  It is for health reasons, also,” I added.  “Holmes, I am a doctor.  I have made a study of the benefits.  I may tell you, there are many.”
“Yes,” said Holmes.  Then:  “Shall we?”
I do feel betrayed.
“What about my behaviour?  I won't have that fool Gregson talking to you like that.”
“I'm looking forward to next summer, then,” I said.  “Honey scones and honey sandwiches.”
“And what else?”
Why in god's name had I sat down?!  I should have retired to my own bedroom, where I could take care of this wretched--
“Well, that's good for you at any rate,” I said.  I watched him as he ripped open the first letter from the pile.
“You are too quiet, John,” said Holmes.  “Shall we take coffee by the fire?”
“What happened?” I enquired, ignoring his plight.  “Did you see Gypsy May?”
“You like me that way.”
I was not sure quite what to make of that.  I waited.
“Not yet, but he's expected,” I replied.  “Is he the younger or the elder, do you know?”
“And will I, what?”
“It sounds an intriguing letter,” I said.
Holmes sighed.  “I still don't like this conversation,” he replied.  “I've never been so 'on the spot'.  Could we get off this bench, and walk, or have a pot of tea somewhere?  I'm coming out in hives.  Why are you
He nudged his cheek into my palm.  I felt the rasp of morning stubble.
“I dreamed of you.”
sake, John, are you quite so obtuse?
Holmes shook his head.  “Oh, never mind.  It is no-one of importance.”  He recommenced to look in all directions.  “Come along, Watson, and don't drag your heels.”
“Where will you go?” my friend enquired.
I threw our bags into a corner of the sitting-room, and raised the windows open.  The air no longer sweet with scented flowers, stock and shrub, but rather heavier with fug and city odour.  I collapsed into my chair and felt around for my clay pipe.  Holmes joined me in my smoke, with one hand waving high the post.
“If they did, I did not hear it, sir.  Sometimes the kettle whistles, or I'm tidying up the crockery, and then I don't hear much else at all.  My ears aren't what they used to be.  I'm forty-five now.”
And we lay there, in the bed, at peace, and dreaming in our own and separate ways of a bright future, that was promising,
“I am tipsy,” he said, frowning slightly at this.
“I shall be moving to the country, sir, to lodge with a dear friend until I find a new position.  I am tired of city life.  There is so much crime and upset, I cannot bear it any longer.  A nice position in a nice country house will suit me very well.  One more week and I'll be gone.”
I burst out into laughter, and he joined me, and we sat there on the bench in Regents Park, like two mad men with some strange secret, which – when you come to think of it – was precisely who we were.
The food was very good.  We ate and drank in companionable silence, counting just three patrons across the threshold in one hour.  The landlord hailed them all.
“This stupid game is set in pairs,” he said.  “Mycroft has just told me.  Watson, will you be my partner?”
“And so I will.”  I moved beside him.  “Were you aware of us... beforehand?”
“How can I be happy, when I have not the faintest notion as to what it is you've won?  Is it a medal for
And so, then, that was it.  At some juncture – two weeks later – the fellow Hoggerty was captured; if not aerodynamically, at least by a Scotland Yard inspector.  Holmes remains quite taciturn on the subject of his legs, and perhaps that's for the best.  He is scratching less, these days, at any rate.
“I'm very sorry, Holmes,” I said, “but I was nervous.  I
temper when she saw me.  The moods of women are so unfathomable.  Anyway, I managed to shoehorn my way into the house for another quick round.  I enquired after her health, and if she was consulting any practitioner at present.  That galvanised her, Watson!
If there were two things that I wanted more than anything to do, then the first was to touch the curl, and the second was to move – and as quickly as I could – away from this maniac in front of me.
closed the windows?” he demanded.  “John, it is a
“Oh, that,” said he.  “It is resolved.”
I groaned and rolled over to squint at the light pouring in from the sitting-room.
“How is it anything of the sort,” said he, waving me inside, “when there's no coffee on the table, and when the fires have not been lit?  It is intolerable, that's what it is.”
“Come on, John, hurry, we are off out.  Put on your boots, unless you fancy wading through the snow in carpet slippers.”
“What do you mean by 'certain facts'?” I asked.
It was a little after midday when Holmes rejoined me.  He slid into a chair, loosened his jacket and reached out to shake the teapot.  There was enough still for one cup, which he prepared and took a sip from.  I, the meanwhile, was all anxiety and questions.  All around us, a happy hum of contented people drinking their tea and eating fondants.  They might not even have existed, such was the extent of my focus on my friend.
He was back with me soon enough, his eyebrows raised, lips tightly pursed.
“Admiring the flowers,” I said.  “Which must seem very strange to you.”
There was a coffee house a street away, just open, so I took an inside table, took my notebook and a pencil, and wrote a letter to my friend.  I did not spare myself; I asked for his forgiveness, if he might give me a moment to explain...  I fashioned a rough envelope, and stuffed the folded sheet inside.  Thus far I'd barely taken breath, but now I sat and came to realise the full extent of damage that I'd wreaked.
“I want to touch you,” I tell him.
“You'll know?  Know what?”
“Inside my wardrobe drawer,” said he – as if that were a commonplace and safe enough location.  “John, don't
”  He lost his patience with me then.  “Oh, do come in, for heaven's sake.  Quite why you're standing with that look upon your face, I've no idea, but it's annoying me.”
The hall was empty, but for me.
“Be quiet,” I told him.  “I am going to have my breakfast now.”  For our landlady had just swept in with a broad, full tray of covered dishes.  The irresistible aroma of bacon, toast and scrambled eggs assailed my nostrils.  “You should as well, Holmes.  Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, you're very kind.”
“I don't care,” said he.  He flicked a hand.  “The thing is, Lestrade
I was still thinking in this vein ten minutes later, when Holmes stepped back into the room, now washed and dressed and ready for the day ahead.  With four long strides he was upon me, perched as an awkward barn owl on the chair arm.
The year was Nineteen Hundred and Four, six unhappy months after my wife’s funeral, and I was suffering from a miserable trifecta of emotions: loneliness, heartache, and grief.
John turns his back so that he and Sherlock are side by side, bracing his hands on the bar behind them, elbows out, his left arm bracketing Sherlock’s left side, shoulder pressing into Sherlock’s back. It feels intimate, even if it’s not exactly a deliberate touch.
“Armchair,” Holmes said, unusually taciturn, standing up without any grace and offering a hand to me. I took his hand and he hoisted me up, immediately set to removing my trousers and drawers while Holmes removed his own.
“You’ve been looking,” John goes on, shrugging. “That’s fine. I don’t mind you looking.”
“You all right?” one of his team members, DS Matterson, asks, holding out his hand.
Holmes was springy and bright, despite his opposition to the sacrament, and as for myself, I was invigorated and felt as if all was right in the world, for the odyssey of my association with Holmes had, at long last, reached its flowering stage.
John clears his throat very loudly. “Um. Sorry. I was going to pop downstairs in a bit, was just taking a quick look at the--cleaning Sherlock’s wound.”
Memories surface, fuzzy and lulling.
“What an insufferable arsehole,” Sherlock says, not meaning it at all.
John is brilliant.
Molly looks from Lestrade to Sherlock and gasps.  “Oh! Now?”
I thought--”
. Molly will make you happy.”
“It was,” Mycroft says, speaking for the first time in awhile, and he sounds delighted. Or as delighted as Mycroft has the capacity to sound.
“I’ll do it,” John interjects as he gets to his feet, straightens out his shirt, and kneels at the hearth.
Sherlock doesn't seem to want to fight him on this. He knows John too well. “I’ll order an Uber."
“Man down!” someone shouts.
“You know, sir, your daughter reminds me of mine when she was that age.”
“Shall I do the backs of your legs?”
and it’s this complexity, this depth and charm and ugliness that attracts Sherlock to London.
?” Sherlock finds himself interjecting.
“I wish to see all of you.”
“Hm, interesting, weaponising your birthday,” John says, sounding very amused. “After eight years of not acknowledging that you have a birthday. Surprised you haven’t tried it on me before.”
“Vi, love,” Dad says cautiously.
“Tell me more about her,” John says. “Your grandmum.”
Sherlock needs more, so he raises his leg, cups the back of his knee, and pulls inward toward his face to allow for a better stretch of his arsehole, making an uncouth
John sucks Sherlock down with slow, undulating mouthfuls, kisses and laves his tongue over his frenulum, reducing Sherlock to an unintelligible noise-emitting, squirming thing. It is all done with such expert finesse that Sherlock can’t help but conclude in a strangled kind of way, “You
“Hello, gorgeous husband. Miss me?” Mary is saying in a cheery fortissimo, grabbing John’s face between her small, clammy hands and giving him a smothering kiss on the lips.
“Anyone else have an opinion?” John challenges the room.
“You’ve had three more drinks than you normally do at these social gatherings.”
John had wanted to kiss him.
Sherlock stops talking mid-sentence and turns to look at John from the kitchen. He’d been explaining pipette best practices to a very attentive Rosie. “Did you need--”
“Stop giggling," Sherlock says straight-faced. "You can’t giggle with your cock up my arse.”
The Thorn and Thistle is as quintessentially old-man-pub and meat-and-potatoes as Sherlock remembers, largely unchanged since the ‘90s, though the average clientele’s age still seems to be somewhere upwards of fifty.
Sherlock looks very satisfied. “An unorthodox medium for communication, to be sure, but the message was received.”
For now, John will soldier on, just like he had moved on after the ballroom dancing lessons. It’s what John Watson does best. Keeps his head down, carries on.
Mrs Hudson chooses to coo like a dove, this time, and Lestrade pitches in a resounding “here, here!”
“Siger was there, too, of course.” Mummy pats Dad’s knee. “He was also beautiful. My beautiful man.”
Sherlock nods sedately, suddenly very tired. He leans heavily against John’s shoulder and closes his eyes--just to rest them. Just for a moment.
Sherlock Holmes.
Months after I was situated in the homey Sussex Downs cottage, I asked Holmes with not insignificant trepidation if he would accompany me for a walk. He agreed easily enough, and we set off into the mild, cloudless June afternoon.
John crouches down to her frog-height, his knees popping, semaphoring his age. “Well, hello. You might just be the prettiest frog I’ve ever seen.”
On a whim one day after I had seen my last patient, I told my charming secretary Janie to notify my patients that I was to be away for the next day or two. I also requested that she forward the address of the practice of my colleague, the intelligent and more than capable Dr. Pendergast, in case a patient had a dire emergency.
“Wouldn’t say it was a pitfall.”
There is no BAFTA on the horizon for John Watson, indeed.
Sherlock's mouth hangs open uselessly as he wraps a hand around his cock and gives it a few strokes, knowing at once it's too much--he'll come much too fast--so he grabs a fistful of the bedsheet as a diversion.
“Your grandmum gave you a house,” John repeats. Then, revelatory, “That’s
“I’m not quite sure either,” Sherlock admits.
, for god’s sake, Janine!” he grits out, then opens his eyes to find a very confused Lestrade. Sherlock flaps a hand at the door and rolls his eyes. “Ignore her. She’s drunk.”
“You know my old axiom, John: there is nothing more important in life than drink and football.”
“When you came home from university in, oh, ‘94, I think it was, I was certain you’d found someone.” Sherlock nearly knocks the mug over in his haste to goggle at his mother. “Silly boy, you really thought I didn't know?”
Sherlock makes a sarcastic noise at the back of his throat, chirping, “You slept with men in the army?”
John makes a noise of commiseration at the back of his throat, and Sherlock frowns at him.
“Mm?” I said, my eyes sliding closed.
a stand-in, if you will. And I am immensely gratified to have been allowed such a role, but I am all too aware that you will soon find a mother for Watson. Or--,” it pains Sherlock to add, “a...father.”
Indignation rises jaggedly in Sherlock’s chest. “Certainly not
“I believe Lestrade has something to say,” Sherlock speaks over him, looking smug.
Sherlock breaks into a wry smirk, rolling over--John’s ejaculate trickling out of his arse and over his thigh, onto the bed, much to his satisfaction--and presses into John’s side, feathering his fingertips down John’s chest.
“I know all relationships have their trials and tribulations but I swear to god, Sherlock Holmes, if you ruin this beautiful thing that you have--”
“For god’s sake,” Sherlock blusters, “John and I are--”
“Or?”
“What if you were to close your eyes?”
“Do you need a hand?” Matterson calls after him.
When John’s gone limp, Sherlock reaches beneath the passenger seat for the roll of paper towels so he can wipe off his hand and allow John a moment to catch his breath.
“You, calling me average.”
“Yeah. You know: beds, pillows. Duvets.”
John’s fighting a smile. “Is that right?”
“Fuck!” Rosie says happily.
Dad and John appear to have reached a handshake stalemate. John audibly swallows. Dad still has his smile on, but it’s become taut.
“Sorry, but what’s the bloody point of the mistletoe?” Lestrade complains. “Someone’s got to actually get bloody well snogged beneath it.”

John is well aware that he is a grown man. And that Sherlock is a grown man. Nor are they
“Watson!” Holmes exclaimed. “How unexpected.”
John's shoulders are drawn up to his ears. He pivots, looking thunderous. “

John’s eyebrows furrow deeply.
Is every-fucking-one trying to tell John, in none too subtle terms, that he’s finally transformed into a wizened old man? Earlier, Sherlock had mentioned that John “looked tired," then proceeded to enumerate all of the reasons

John takes a step toward Sherlock.
“Yes.”
“Now I know,” John says slowly. He drops his eyes to the floor, lets out a little laugh. “That’s us, then.”
He releases the gift tucked between his hip and the arm of the chair and looks up and over. John is looking down at him with vague amusement--and with something else. Fondness, perhaps.
Everyone drinks.
When John makes a muffled noise of wakefulness, Sherlock offers a silky “Good morning” before tightening an arm around John’s chest and hooking a leg over his thigh.
The pain lances up John's foot as he flops around onto his arse, clutching at his ankle and palpating it.
John takes a pull of his beer (always dramatic), his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s, then places the bottle down on the coffee table. With deliberateness, he raises his eyes toward the ceiling and Sherlock follows his line of sight to the kitchen entryway, where the sprig of mistletoe is conspicuously absent.
Making little bitten-off noises, Sherlock lifts and spreads his legs wide in the air, throws his neck back, submits himself. “Oh,
I realised, then, why I had not asked for Mary’s hand in marriage. Or why I had not attempted to court the fairer sex since I met Holmes. More basically, I realised why, in all the years stretching back to my youth, my eyes occasionally strayed to appraise the male physique and craved a man’s carnal touch (a clinical fascination, I had reasoned with myself, nothing more; I dared not give voice to any other possibility).
TW: Internalized Homophobia, Emotional Infidelity
I pushed up to kiss him, my heart soaring.
For a majority of the excursion, we walked in silence. I was unnerved by the prospect of what I was about to do, and I hoped Holmes’s keen observation skills had taken the day off. My agitated state caused me to glance at Holmes excessively, my trouser pocket laden with the gold bracelet (wrapped in cloth to prevent Holmes’s suspicion), fearing his judgment and ridicule for my prospective overture. By no means was Holmes a man of society; he was a Bohemian through and through and did not worship at the altar of the institution of marriage. But I had reasoned, in the many days leading up to that especial one, that my grand statement coupled with our certain brand of partnership, was, if nothing else, in some  defiance of the very institution.
“Ah,” Sherlock says, slumping downwards, looking at his lap.
“Can’t I admire the view in peace?” I said charmingly.
“Yeah. Twenty-, thirty-years time? You know. When we retire. And maybe even as a bit of a getaway in the next few years?”
“--West End show? I can text you, ask John for your number?”
John thrusts wildly, needily, into Sherlock’s mouth, simultaneously drawing Sherlock’s finger in deeper, and Sherlock is making all sorts of strangled noises around John’s cock, his finger slowing, becoming lazy, too distracted by John slamming into his throat, and then John is coming with a powerful shout and spasm, arse clenching around Sherlock’s finger, Sherlock swallowing down his release.
, one hand braced on the wall by John's head as he thrusts up into John’s hand, and then John is grunting and coming.
Mummy frowns. “In that case, do carry on.”
“But I want to….” Rosie mumbles petulantly, lips in a moue, though she does as she’s told.
“I suppose I’ll be smote now. I had wanted to wait until marriage.”
“Not your fault,” John says, determinedly limping towards the bleachers.
Why is this woman speaking so familiarly, as if she knows John personally? As if she and Sherlock are chums?
Shoes crunch through dirt--just one pair, this time--to beat a hasty retreat.
“--and far be it from me to leave you boys,” a hard look at Mycroft, “without you knowing, with certainty, how much I adore you.” Then, barbed, “I will not be my mother.” Forces a smile that gradually softens into something real. “So all that is to say: Happy Birthday, dear heart. We love you.”
“It’s...fine.” He clears his throat.

“Look at you,” John says.
John just grunts in response. “My MIT kids are gobsmacked. It’s Sherlock Holmes like they’ve never seen him before. Think he’ll need to do a bit of spin-doctoring on his image after this so he’ll be able to scare them off again proper. But it’s nice to see him letting loose, yeah? He’s been wound up for the better part of the year, the sulky bastard.”
“Charming,” Sherlock says flatly.
“I don’t
Sherlock looks down blankly at John’s head bowed over his lap. Grey strands of hair are more obvious and plentiful at this vantage, and Sherlock wants to count each and every one of them. Wants to press his face into them and breathe John in.
John giggles, and Sherlock can feel the vibrations in his nose, mouth, in everything pressed up against John. He kisses John’s pulsating carotid artery, presses a kiss to John’s jaw, angles his head and dips down so that their mouths--warm breath with a sweet scent of alcohol intermingling--hover a hair’s breadth apart.
He darts out of the room and heads for the stairs.
Holmes looked rapidly from the bracelet to my earnest face, then back again to the bracelet.
is bliss.
Mary.
Holmes then placed a gentle hand on my forearm and hesitantly slid that hand up to my bicep. It was certainly foreign for us to touch like that, though it felt natural and incandescent; to have been deprived of any kind of intimate touch from him for all those years was a crime.
“But worth his weight in silver,” Holmes replied.  “For he can go where I might not, and not appear the least suspicious.  There's odd business at that tannery, and Wiggins and his gang will keep an eye on it.”
“I am glad that one of us is in some way domesticated,” Holmes replied.  “I imagine you'd like to cut into that sponge cake now.  You've had your eye on it the entire time we've been talking.”
I leaned my head out of the carriage.
“Did you read Meredith?” he asked.
, a rash desire, or what you will.  God, how I wanted him!  I regarded my reflection in the mirror, my pale and anxious face, and wondered what the merry hell I might or should not do.
I watched him as he bustled, and raised my hand in brief farewell as he turned for the outside landing.  The slam of the front door then, and I hurried to the window to look out upon his head as it, and all the rest of him, moved briskly down the street and out of sight of my keen eye.
“Well, that's better,” said Holmes.  “I feel like a new man.”  And he angled a smirk.  “If you'll pardon the phrase.”  (Holmes's humour very often confused me.)  We sat together on the sofa as the day faded to dusk.  My friend was buoyant and loquacious, and it filled my heart to hear him talk and joke of his adventure.  “John, when you are well, you

So we walked, once more in silence, but a
“To say the very least of it,” said Holmes.  “You are quite mad.”  He smiled, and waved away my frown.  “Don't pout.  For we are all of us peculiar in some way, is that not so?”
Mr. Parrow drew himself three inches taller – which was still not very tall – and puffed his chest in indignation.  “I am
“That was intolerably rude,” I informed him.
My friend set his glass down and rose from his chair.  We did likewise and followed him out into the garden, still warmly lit by the late-afternoon sun.  Holmes strode up to the gate, crunching on shingles, where he stepped into the lane and dropped to his haunches by the post.  We watched as he first examined the ground, part gravel and part earth, before returning to the house.  Here he settled by the window of what I remembered to be the drawing room, and commenced the same routine.  He picked up a tiny fragment, what it was I could not tell, and after a brief scrutiny placed it inside his waistcoat pocket.
He moved towards it imperturbably.  “I had new curtains put in recently,” he told me conversationally.  “And the wardrobe's an antique; at least as old as Mrs. Hudson.”  He turned the handle, and the door swung inwards silently.  We stood upon the cusp, both of us breathing rather heavily, I thought.  The seconds stretched and snapped.
“That's quite all right.  When can I see you next?”
,” he breathed, “oh,
“We need lubricant,” I said, the thought now only just occurring.  I leapt off the bed and rummaged on the wash stand.  Finding something that would serve quite well, I ferried it to Holmes.  He eyed it with some apprehension.
I read the slip inside the envelope, and frowned.  I rose and strode towards the door, poking my head around.  “Miss Marsh,” I said, “it seems I must go out to see a patient.  Might you look this lady up inside our records, please?”  I hastened up into my rooms above the surgery, to collect my hat and coat.  I checked inside my bag, threw in some items, and was just fastening my buttons when the receptionist delivered me the file.  I read it quickly, nodding.  “I will be an hour or two,” I said, “no more than that, I hope.”
He nodded slightly, took it from me, turned it over in his hands.  I sensed a sadness in him, suddenly.  My hand reached out to touch him, offer empathy; it rested on his shoulder, where the muscles curled and tensed, tried in themselves to throw me off.
“You must forgive me for that spectacle,” he said.  “But now you see what I must deal with.”
“What of your parents?” he enquired.
.  He seemed a gentleman indeed, if somewhat brusque.
“Why did you snort?” I asked, amused.
We left the back street, passing by the foul-smelling butcher's shop and heading, I supposed, in the direction towards Baker Street.  This seemed not to be the case as Holmes turned back.
We did, and there was not.  Inspector Gregson was away and enjoying his weekend, but an irascible Lestrade was there to tell us the dim news.  Holmes outlined our short visit to Dawkins' Curiosity Bizarre.  The Inspector seemed very underwhelmed, and even more so when he learned of the proprietor's physical state.  We were roundly informed that we were 'bleating up a blind alley' (Lestrade's own phrasing), and didn't we know there was a murder to solve?  To avoid a second altercation, I removed Holmes from the premises and we wended our way home.
“Protect me?  Protect me from what?”
little pipsqueak came to see me here, three days ago.  You are no doubt unaware that he was expelled from the police force very recently.  Hmm, hmm.  He did not care to elaborate.  His mother has disowned him.  He would not elaborate on that
“Well!  Because of the pinprick.  One of the thorns had been dipped in a poison.  What else might it have possibly been?  Victor himself writes that her face held an expression of horror.”
, I ruined the front door lock with acid.  Apparently--”
I sighed.
“You must apologise immediately.”
“Is he aware of... you?”
I shook his hand before he took his leave.  He stared at me, as if I were a puzzle he was baffled by.  I watched him from my window as he hurried down the street and turned the corner out of sight.
“It is a skull, gentlemen, nothing less and nothing more.  If that does not interest you, then there are many other items in my shop that may well do.  It is not for sale.  You may, however, view it for a fee, as I have mentioned.”
“But... it is not my birthday.”
My friend stared at his left arm as if it were improperly attached to all the rest of him.
“What news from Pike, then?” I enquired at the first interval.
“And what's through there?” I asked him, pointing.
I was about to say
“It will destroy you.”
The inn was all but deserted.  An old patriarch in rustic garb was sitting on a high stool at the bar.  He nursed his glass – a clear coloured brew – and peered over at us sleepily.
“Holmes, but this surely means you have him now?  Oh, but wait.  It was a 'C', not an 'E', on those other notes.  Could you have misread it?”
I shuffled closer and touched his shoulder with my fingertips.  I curled my arm beneath the sheet and placed a hand upon his hip.  The jut of bone, the warm and soft, inviting skin.  I left my hand to rest there while my lips sought out his mouth, to steal a brief and furtive kiss.
“And how did you come by the skull?”
“Crawford Street is quite close by,” said Sherlock Holmes.
And he looked at me, and I at him, with the same baffled expression.
“Yes, I know, but it is not about that.  You have not opened your letter from Surrey.”
“I want you terribly,” I said, my voice a hush.  I reached a hand to touch the paisley of his waistcoat, and he jerked, and froze, and stared at it, as if it were a spider set on wrapping him in silk.
“Yes, well, that is how you so choose to depict me,” said he with a grumble, “and therefore your fault.  You
My friend performed a vague mime in the air.
“Well, you can let yourself out, then.  There's a loaf, some cheese, and butter in the cupboard if you want it, but you know I'm out of coffee.”
He nibbled around his buttered toast.  I forked my ham and eggs.
people by that name who live in Surrey,” he said, his mouth downturned.  “How very inconvenient.  We may narrow down the radius.  And now we have to hurry else we shall surely miss our train.”
“Only to protect you.”
“Don't be facetious,” Sherlock Holmes replied.  “It really doesn't suit your build.”  He shut the door behind me and then pointed down the hallway with a long and peevish forefinger.  “Go on.  Go through.  You surely cannot need a guide this time.  I've better things to do.”
“To ask you out,” I reaffirmed.  “Come out,” I added, lest he still not get the grasp of it.
“But what will you
We caught each other's eye, and both were smiling simultaneously.  The moment caught; somehow we held it for a second over comfortable.  Holmes coughed and looked away.  I felt my cheeks flush for a reason that I could not start to fathom.  I was thankful for the coffee cup, the window, and the newspaper.  When I returned my head to Holmes some several minutes later, his eye was back on me.  I wondered for how long.
I goggled at him, scandalised.  “You'll be for it if he hears you.”
“Holmes,” I said, “whatever is wrong?”
The afternoon saw us adjacent on the sofa, with our reading and thinking interspersed with light chatter.  At length, Holmes rose to gather up his papers and recommence work on his monograph.  Stooping, graceful, his back towards me as he sorted through the sheaf upon the floor, I could scarcely focus, lost in a sharp pang of low want for him.  I was on the point of thinking how I should like to set my teeth into his rump, when he straightened up and turned to look at me.
And he smirked.  “Quite often, yes.  It saves them time.  Especially if the book is
“Victor is now a rich man,” I said softly.
“If you are resolute on poisoning us, then I admire the stalwart effort,” said Holmes.  He leaned forward in his chair.  “What is this all about, Pike?  I am referring to the
Holmes stubbed his cigarette upon the window sill.  He moved towards me, set me firmly to one side, made for the door.
“I'm not sure that I understand,” I said.  “Mycroft has loaned you money?”
I handed in my notice with the Yard on Monday morning, and I set the wheels in motion for my venture with Anstruther.  The latter was a stout and jolly fellow, with a charming wife and daughters, all of whom lived on the premises above the foundling surgery.  The rooms on the ground floor were clean and spacious, furnished well, and already with a bustle and a hum, as transferred patients came to introduce themselves and their infirmities.  Anstruther was insistent that I dine with them that evening, and I accepted.  All these things to fill and please my time, therefore, and very glad I was to have them, otherwise I should be maudlin.  But no time for that!
