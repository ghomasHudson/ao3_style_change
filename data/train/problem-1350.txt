But first of all, he needed this gorgeous mouth back around his cock...
"I'm not sure this is how you do it," he tried to word his thoughts, while Sherlock gave the tip a rather suggestive twirl and John silently begged his own lolly, err, crotch to keep it together.
You are perfect."
Sherlock swallowed.
and that this should really not make such a difference - and yet here he was, positively squirming under Sherlock's hands and painfully aware of every uncontrollable twitch and contraction of his sphincter. And it was exactly this weird mix between wanting to fuck himself on this one finger deep and long and hard, and the self-awareness that even any of those uncontrollable movements of his muscles would probably drive him insane, which confined John to focus on staying still in his current position.
“But Holmes, why? What is the purpose of this act?”
“Short….?”
As I was caught up in that flashback it must have shown, because Holmes twitched impatiently and let out a slight groan. I reached for the cushion beneath his arm for something to kneel on.“At my own pace, please, Holmes, as I don’t know just what to anticipate here but you have yet to earn my forgiveness for what you’ve done.”
He looked away, then back at me, slightly blushing. “And, my dear, please let me earn your forgiveness by keeping you entertained with the study of your missing trousers, hmm? For there are other…“ he turned his head and shoulders to the side in a slim gesture, leaning away from the dining table, ”…elements that may be of interest to you in this case.” Holmes can be, as observed by my old friend Percy, such an inscrutable fellow.
While I did so, I felt a warm rush through the center of me as I was once again overtaken by the vivid memory. Now I had no yardstick, but my hands and the lens were up to the task, as all the while I recalled how he pushed back our shoreline one centimeter at a time with his finger perched over the edge of the yardstick, then rescinded it a half-centimeter, and up again two more centimeters, until the waves grew exponentially and beyond my calculation. Soon all the numbers and straight lines dissolved into grains of sand as I felt each wave lapping up a little higher, until Holmes rushed into me and soon I was enveloped in one steady motion of wet nourishing pressure.
“My dear Watson,” he said, and picked up the coffee pot to pour me a cup, “I needed them, most urgently. Do you recall the murder that took place in Norwood, how my most vital witness in solving the case was a 'gentleman of the road’? And how not even dear old Lestrade had caught on that tramps had camped there? Well, I found it in the best interest of the case to dress in tramp costume for the interview. And you’ve seen their dress; it was best that I found a garment not tailored to me in order to look the part. You were at your club when I urgently needed to construct this costume, so I helped myself to the mousiest brown pair of linen trousers in your wardrobe–I should call them mudwater-coloured–and altered them with a pair of shears. Don’t worry, for Mrs. Hudson is at the tailor’s with your measurements at this moment.”
I gave him a mock-stern look. With some shakiness, I felt my hands around the sides of his knees and snaked up the sides of his thighs, at a faster rate than when I inched up his ankles.
“Of course,” I nodded, resigned to accept the forces behind this insignificant folly in which I had been swept up. I opened my mouth to ask how Mrs. Hudson knew my measurements, but stopped before any words could come. For with a blink of his eyes, I remembered.
“You ‘necessarily’ disposed of MY trousers?”
Holmes lay on his back with his hands folded over his abdomen. I was on my side, careful not to touch him. He turned his head to face me, his eyes still vulnerable, yet shining with something I read as pride and gratitude.
“And you’ve had some difficulty in your sartorial arrangements because of it of late. Oh, Watson, I do hope you’ll forgive me. For I have sent Mrs. Hudson to the tailors to order a pair of trousers to replace the ones that I have necessarily taken for my own disposal.”
I turned the lens over in my hand with hesitance. “You want…me to…?”
“My only plan for today was to write, Holmes…but if you have a line of investigation to follow, I am your man.”
I pressed my forehead between his calves, now somewhat tense as I moved my head higher, higher, until I felt soft fabric against my temples. Could this be…? His knees, relaxed and pointed outward, tensed up around my head. I saw his toes wiggle below me.
I lit a match and puffed at my cigar until I was sure it was lit, stealing a look at Holmes all the while. His lips were parted in a half-smile and his hair, still sweaty, clung to his temples. His eyes appeared to move beneath his lids.
I took the lens in hand again and buried my face in the drumstick of his inner calf, feeling the rigid knobs on the surface of his tibia against my cheek and brow, and the soft, lightly hairy flesh of his leg to my nose. He responded by pressing back into me, and for a moment we were bonded, face to leg, each drawn into the softness and the scratch of the other. When I pulled away I saw a patch of redness from our friction, and brushed over it with my knuckles, barely, for soothing.
I tossed the match into the fire. “Donate?”
To my remark, Holmes opened his eyes to glance at the trousers still hanging from the arm of his chair. I followed his gaze. The manner in which the trousers hung so straight and neat was comical, as if they offered a question of their own. I returned my gaze to Holmes. He angled his face to look at me and answered with a smirk, then closed his eyes again.
“Watson, you really are catching on to my methods most astutely.” Holmes closed his eyes. I stood up to retrieve a cigar from my case on the mantle, then perched on my elbow next to him. The last thing he said was, “Thank goodness we took them off in time, or they would not have been appropriate to donate.”
“I’m sure you did, Holmes. And you solved the case and now I’m out a pair of trousers. If I am to wait two weeks for a new pair of trousers from the tailors I’d at least like to see what you put them through in order to obtain your result! Nevertheless I am happy to hear that a pair of shabby trousers helped you in your success.”
He paused, trying to read the tone of my last statement, then seemed to abandon the thought. “They are to be laundered before I turn them over to the Irregulars but, let me warn you that they are a bit”–he tipped his head down slightly–“short.”
I migrated to my chair by the fire and retrieved my notebook and pen. He resurfaced a minute later, still wearing his nightgown and purple dressing gown, lit a cigarette, and sunk into his usual chair. The trousers were nowhere in sight but it was of no matter at the moment; I had been taking notes on what I could remember of his description of the Norwood case, when he pulled his chair close to me in front of the fire, faced me squarely, and gave a low conscious “Now. Watson…” to draw my attention.
He swallowed and continued, looking pleased and hopeful, “…only this time, with your permission or preferably your assistance, if you’d be so kind?”
Holmes and I had just been seated for breakfast in Baker Street. He was in a cheery mood, on a high from having revealed a hidden murderer in Norwood, thereby saving his client from being wrongfully hanged for the murder, a case on which I am still ordering my notes.
“Pins and needles, my dear Watson.” As Holmes and I laid on the rug and watched the flames of the fire dwindle, I could feel the tide recede as he showed signs of blood flowing back into his extremities.
I continued nervously where I left off. “Every night I adhere some pieces before laying out my suit for the next day. Last night it was the delicate details of the mast…Holmes—I am missing a pair of linen trousers. No one goes into my bedroom except for you, and Mrs. Hudson, but she would have no reason–”
While maintaining hand contact, I climbed out of my chair and nudged it backward with my feet to make room to kneel before him. He softened his left hand and laid it upon my wrist until I began to direct myself in the task, at which point he leaned back and rested his hands behind his head.
I gave a light kiss on the inside of either leg in hopes to relax him and steal another taste of salt before I drew my head back. Curiously, keeping his hem raised with my hands, I flipped the front of the nightgown upward and folded it onto my friend’s chest. I could not tell if Holmes noticed but for a twitch of a smile, for his eyes were closed.
“I am so glad to hear it,” Holmes said gaily, then scuttled to his bedroom.
I then eagerly finished the task of unbuttoning his–or my—fly with zest, then watched the centimeters of skin grow on him, beckoning my hands to move exponentially faster than I did on my journey up his long, supple legs, which now cradled my torso.
“Well, I haven’t fully disposed of them; I figure they can be worn by one of the Irregulars—how they grow so fast, some of them are in men’s clothes already–”
“Holmes…have you noticed the progress of my ship?”
I continued to mutter my observations. “My 'mudwater brown’ trousers were made somewhat ashen by the bonfire.” I raised the magnifying lens to them, teasing his knees with my knuckles as I moved the lens over them. I clicked my tongue. “There is a hole beginning in the right knee.” I breathed over it. “Ahhhhh. Do you feel that?”
This was one of those moments we’ve been coming to frequently of late, in which the boundary between work and recreation, and our boundaries between one another lapped eagerly like the flow of a tide into a shore. Holmes, gently wetting the dry shore of me, brushed a few grains of sand aside with each wave, washing me smooth while I waited, in the place where we met, where I came to him marked with footprints. At the ebb of tides, we politely withdrew from one another until a case or a shared meal called us back together.
Holmes must have seen the memory flood into my face. Or perhaps he thought I was dumbfounded. His tone lifted again. “You do remember that I measured you last night?” He raised his coffee cup with a cheeky smile.
Holmes drew in the smoke of his cigarette, then threw it into the fire. He gave a slight nod, and as his expression changed to mischievous, he bent forward just enough to reach the hem of his nightgown with his left fingertips. Slowly he curled back his thumb and all but his long thin forefinger to raise his hem above his feet, then straightened his finger to lower it again. Maintaining contact between his fingertip and the arch of his foot, he began to trace upward, playfully pulling the fabric up to reveal his skin, then uncurling his finger and the fabric down to cover it again, while watching my responses to his mild teasing game.
In two weeks’ time I had a new pair of trousers to wear with my brown coat again. My “disappeared” trousers laundered nicely, and the seams stayed intact despite Holmes’s pressings, but nevertheless, we decided to keep them.
“I say, Holmes,” I looked him in the eye and stroked the back of either leg with my fingertips, “what other…elements of interest…did you say may be in this case, of these trousers that used to be mine?” I eased the tips of my index fingers between his soft skin and the tightly rolled trouser hems, and rolled my tongue against the back of my top teeth, as if to cement my inquiry for a warrant into my former trousers.
As much as John wanted to, he could not
Sherlock kept his mouth on John's cock, careful not to overwhelm John with sensation as he pressed his finger against John's body. ''Relax.'' Sherlock pushed, so very carefully, as he kept his eyes on John, gauging every reaction, ready to stop whenever he needed to.
John didn't know when he had started panting, didn't remember which other sounds might had left his mouth in the last few minutes, but now tried to catch his breath, while could feel Sherlock's on his own face, and how was it possible that they both had lived with this desire all this years without having bursted.
"Wait," he muttered, while carefully stepping backwards, and thankfully Sherlock got the hint and guided John back to his seat, where John plonked down a bit ungracefully, but without ever breaking eye contact with Sherlock.
Sherlock sucked hard, moving the hands on John's thighs up allowing the fingers of one hand to brush the skin of John's balls. He wanted to make him cum. He wanted to swallow down everything John had to give and emit his taste to memory. He wanted all of it.
And whimpered at the sight that greeted him.
Sherlock glanced up at John's face, barely conjuring enough energy to return the soft smile John was giving him. Sherlock made a soft noise in the back of his throat, not trusting his own voice at the moment. If he even had one. Sherlock sighed when John's touch softened in his hair.
But, if Sherlock was doing what John was thinking he was doing...
Bolstered by this revelation, Sherlock kept moving until he was standing right in front of John, forcing the other man to look up at him.
He closed his eyes and felt Sherlock working on his erection, and this certainly wouldn't take long if he continued like this, how could that bastard be so good at this-
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Unbelievable. He lowered the lollipop to glare at John.
But John wasn't stopping him. In fact, he seemed to be begging for it.
Sherlock paused for a moment. Had he pushed too far? Had he stepped over the line? He knew he took a considerable risk by displaying this kind of behaviour in front of John. He was pushing the bonds of their friendship, hoping to stretch it into something more, at the cost of it breaking. But he couldn’t stand it anymore. He couldn't stand the looks, and touches, and vaguely concealed inquiries in combination with John's hesitation. John would never make that first move again, not after Angelo's - and God, Sherlock hates himself for that night - but he knew John wants.
John swallowed heavily, unable to look away from Sherlock as he was moving closer, and closer, and John was glad that he was the one still sitting, because he wasn't sure if his knees would actually be solid enough to carry his weight at this point.
"Not apart from... strictly medical procedures," he tried to deflect a little, perfectly aware that all of those encounters - both on the giving and receiving end - had all been more than embarrassing and had given him goosebumps for very different reasons than in this very moment.
Sherlock seemed to send the vibration of his baritone droning directly through John's spine to short out his brain.
look at Sherlock while he was doing ... whatever he was doing ...
Sherlock Holmes had always been good for surprises, and -
Sherlock's stomach did something he couldn’t describe when he heard John speak up.
"Take them off," Sherlock breathed out and his tongue darted out to lick the lollipop again. "Trousers, pants... off, John."
His eyes were pressed shut, since the sensation of this one finger seemed to take up the complete storage capacity of his brain, while shutting out almost everything else, including his sense of time.
Feeling like he had exerted Sherlock more than enough already, John decided to slowly slide down the chair while moving his hand from Sherlock's head to his cheek to give him some time to realise that his newfound cushion was about to give way, but Sherlock, of course, got the hint. John ended up sitting on the floor in front of his chair, tucked between the seat and Sherlock's body, wanting to touch him everywhere, to kiss him, to hug him and never let go again-
He had found it. Oh god, he had definitely found it.
I do it, John?"
Sherlock licked up the shaft again - slowly - before encircling the tip and suckling it into his mouth. This time, there was no mistaking the strangled breath that escaped John.
And he was doing that.
''Do you...''
Between the sweetness that lingered on his tongue and the feeling of John's mouth on him, Sherlock couldn't help but gasp and moan. He needed more. So much more. He needed...
And almost unannounced, there was a feeling bubbling up inside John that made him feel like his chest was about to burst.
"Sherlock..." he breathed, almost slurring as if he was drunk.
Halfway to its destination, Sherlock stopped the downwards movement of his slick finger and also released John for a moment to, almost to John's irritation, halt and reassure himself that he wasn't doing anything that John didn't want - when John hadn't realised until a couple of minutes ago that there possibly weren't so many things that he would want more than this and whatever else the two of them would eventually end up doing.
"Amazing... oh my... god... Sherl..."
Sherlock whimpered shamelessly when he felt John tug on his hair and his eyes fluttered closed. Oh, this was so much better than he had dared imagine. John wanted him. Him! He was begging for him. And yet Sherlock wanted to do nothing more than lay himself bare for John to consume.
He bit his lower lip as Sherlock just stood there, hesitating, while moving the lolly away from his lips, and John felt like he was only waiting for his cue to...
"Christ, Sherlock," he breathed, and blindly got hold of that hand of Sherlock's which currently was not inside him, but which Sherlock had placed on John's hips to stabilise them both likewise, and John just squeezed Sherlock's fingers.
Sherlock made a vague noise in the back of his throat which would have sounded like an uninterested dismissal at any other time, but Sherlock was still staring at John. And he continued to do so when he brought it back to his mouth. His eyes were fixed on John when he parted his lips, brought it closer, extended his tongue…
, not
, arching his eyebrow. "No?" he asked and Sherlock silently congratulated himself on the steadiness of his voice. "I was unaware there was a protocol on the matter. How does one do it, John?"
Sherlock had barely touched him so far, but only watching the possibilities and seeing them unfold so clearly in front of his own eyes made John's breathing go shallow and it was simply too much to bear.
John knew he was lying, which meant that probably also Sherlock knew that John's lying, but he'd be damned to admit it to this bloody git's face while he was... wait, was he doing all this on purpose!?
Sherlock relaxed his mouth as much as he could when John started thrusting up his mouth in earnest. It wasn't hard; with John's nails scraping slightly over Sherlock's scalp, Sherlock felt his entire body sag into the sensations. The smell and the taste of John, the weight of his cock on his tongue, the little hairs on his head that pulled as John moved his hand... Sherlock was drunk with it.
This was the craziest thing John had ever done.
God, he wanted so much. He wanted to wreck Sherlock even more than the way Sherlock was currently wrecking him, and John knew that this whole development had been rather one-sided up until this point, but right now... god, how was it possible that there were even more ways how Sherlock could drive him out of his mind?
But first...
And then all this, with Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. Who didn't feel things this way, but apparently did, who didn't do these sort of things-
And Sherlock was...
"Just... god, please, just keep going. With your mouth and," he hesitated, apart from solely medical experience not quite sure that he knew what he was asking for, which made the rest of his reply almost get lost in a frustrated moan.
John, still sitting on the rug, looked up at him and felt his own face lighting up.
Sherlock swallowing his cock, John couldn't control himself and his hips buckled up while his flingers clenched around Sherlock's curls and John was afraid for a moment that he might have hurt Sherlock one way or the other.
John could hear himself whimper when Sherlock's finger stroked over his prostate, and all he could in this moment was to beg for sweet death, while Sherlock apparently tried to wrinkle every last bit of sanity out of John's body just by using
They stayed like that until Sherlock could no longer stand the feeling in his pants and he started fidgeting. ''I need a shower,'' Sherlock muttered and he reluctantly pulled away from John. His mind slowly came back into focus again, sharpening and focusing on the world around them. Sherlock rose slowly, his knees and ankles stiff, and his eye fell on the lollipop on the table next to John's chair.
When Sherlock came back to himself, his head was resting against John's thigh and his breath was escaping him in ragged pants. The taste of John's cum lingered on his tongue and Sherlock was suddenly very aware of the wetness of his own pants. Oh. Well. That was -
Sherlock slid against John's new-found position easily, relaxing into John's firm hold. If only John would let him, he'd stay here. He'd never more. He'd be basking in John's touches and kisses until the end of his days and he would be alright with that. He'd be -
Sherlock glanced up at John's face, frowning, not understanding. But then Sherlock saw when John was briefly turning his gaze to and Sherlock felt his cheeks flush. God, this hadn't happened to him since... a long time ago. And here he was, having come into his pants because John had fucked his face.
Sherlock returned John's grip, lacing their fingers together. ''John... you look... oh, John, that's it. Let me hear you.'' Sherlock licked his lips and carefully moved his finger against John's prostate. ''Christ, John, I need...'' Sherlock squeezed his fingers against John's own before fully lowering his mouth over John's cock, foregoing the teasing. He needed to see John coming apart. He needed to feel it. To taste it.
''A long time ago,'' Sherlock replied with a pointed look. He didn't want to discuss it further. Not now. ''Just breathe, John. Breathe.''
Keep doing that."
Sherlock moaned around John's cock when John pushed back up into Sherlock's mouth and he responded by pressing slightly harder against John's prostate. Sherlock was clutching John's hand now, squeezing it, silently begging for more as he kept allowing the moans to escape him.
John shifted in his armchair and slowly closed his mouth which, as he noticed now, had been widely open the entire time (and if John had now noticed, Sherlock must had noticed as well... god). After a moment, he cleared his throat, his voice a bit more high-pitched than he would have liked as he continued, "M-yeah. Fine. I'm fine."
Sherlock couldn’t stop the corner of his mouth of from twitching up momentarily into something that resembled a smug grin.
"Sherlock..." was the only thing he managed to say, and hoped that Sherlock, as always, would understand the question he was unable to ask.
With Sherlock's mouth only inches away from his cock and his finger working gently on his arse, John knew they were already past the point where he should be embarrassed about admitting what must have been obvious, how else would Sherlock possibly have thought it was necessary to even ask this question.
and Sherlock had no idea how long, or even if John had done this before.
Sherlock rose to his feet, lollipop still in hand and he moved towards John. "Well? Have you ever tried it?"
Sherlock hadn't even wanted to leave the house for this four, until John had finally managed to talk him over.
John's heart jumped a bit, and so did he, as he reached out for Sherlock to grasp any part of him that he could reach to pull himself out of this chair, to meet Sherlock who had already come most of the way, and he did the most natural thing that he could think of - and kissed him.
So instead of constantly moving his finger in and out, he was searching. Pressing in deeper until John's body tightened and a shocked breath escaped him. "John..."
Slowly, John's entire body went slack and panting eventually turned into catching his breath again.
Sherlock took a deep breath, nodding, forgoing a smug remark at John's rushed out remark about his finger. He didn't want to ruin this. He could afford to drive John away now, not with his trust so openly displayed. Sherlock moved back closer to John again, teasing the tip of John's cock carefully and he moved his fingers closer to John's arse, teasing the rim with light touches. ''Relax,'' Sherlock muttered. ''Have you... ever done this?''
But when he kept on pushing down, his mouth taking in more and more of the sweet toy, he opened his eyes.
John's face went on a journey from mild confusion to sudden realisation and - after glancing down a second time and finally noticing the wet stain on Sherlock's trousers - to feeling almost a bit flattered, and he had a hard time hiding a little smug smile from his face.
John had expected this to happen - goddamnit, John had actually watched it happening. He had seen Sherlock approaching his chair, had obediently complied with Sherlock's demand to put his hands on Sherlock's head, but seeing Sherlock swallowing his cock almost entirely in one go,
After a minute of nothing from me but light perspiration and timid silence, Holmes reached for my left hand, which I rested in his, and guided it to where his finger paused from tracing his hem up the vase of his ankle. He nodded again, in the direction of the magnifying lens in my hand.
I paused to look up from my notebook, which he immediately snatched and tossed behind him, nonchalant. I, startled, dropped my pen and began to open my mouth in protest, but seeing my trust reflected in his smoldering eyes overrode my urge to question this beautiful mess of a man whom I call my friend.
I was missing a pair of trousers–the only pair that match my brown jacket. I thought I’d bring it up lightly, by talking about things physically close to their last seen location: my bedroom, a room I have welcomed my friend into on a number of occasions–and see what clues he might furnish me with as to their disappearance. On this day I took longer than usual to prepare myself for breakfast with my flatmate, as I silently rehearsed the scenario. At the dining table, my first cup of coffee gave me enough nerve to ask.
Epilogue
Giving a wide smile and a slight snort, he removed his hands from behind his head and reached for my hands. His speech was alert but somewhat strained. “I will show you—if–you forgive me–for making off with your trousers…” His voice cracked, “and if you’ll let me remove them again…”
“Now let’s see about finding what happened to those trousers,” I said in the raspy voice I reserve for Holmes, in which I imitated the accent of a certain Scotland Yard Inspector, for laughs. Holmes giggled and thumped his chair at my inappropriately timed slip of humor.
When the big wave rolled back down, the water washed away but the sand remained saturated long afterward; soon I could measure in centimeters again, slowly, evenly, all the way back down, in study of that decadent method of pleasuring that Holmes joked would “grow” on me.
I shifted my eyes to his face. “I see you dress to the right,” I said with a smile, to see if he appreciated my tailor joke, but the knot of his eyebrows begged me to be serious.
Holmes continued, “I used my own shirt, and my own braces to hold up the trousers. A ratty blanket for a shawl and some ash to smudge my face and hands and I quite looked the part! I gave the cabbie a shock when I climbed out.”
To test the full effects of this unorthodox use of a magnifying lens directly on my detective I would need his approval. Holmes gave me a tormented look while I contemplated the entailment of fulfilling the ultimate destiny of his excitement inside my trousers. What would the consequences be? Might he enjoy that? As that flash of boldness passed me, another one struck, in the form of a polite suggestion. I sat back on my haunches and set down the magnifying lens.
“In this case I have the advantage of–let’s call it—the clue, which will guide you in the solution of the mystery of your missing trousers.”
In my right hand, now absent of a pen, I felt him place the hard handle of something—I could tell it was metal, warm from his hands. I looked down and saw his magnifying lens. I said nothing, but looked back into his eyes. He puffed his cigarette. “You know my methods.”
Using my left hand, I continued to raise the hem of his nightgown, lightly stroking his skin as I explored my way up his leg, one square centimeter at a time, mindful to tease the sensitive points of his ankles, as he taught me in the methods he painstakingly employed last night.
I, in my usual morning slump, had been waiting for two days to ask Holmes about something pressing on my mind. I thought of it last night at the opera, and earlier in the day when we were in the Yard office, and in the cab ride before that, but I was unable to work up the gumption. You see, Holmes and I are the most intimate of friends, but there are some behaviours we had agreed to forgive, even to the point of silent protest, or loud protest in the case of his addictions. The matter at hand was one unlike any I’d noticed before, and because of the manner of our intimacy, it seemed not a queer enough event to bring up in conversation. Yet it was of a questionable moral slant for a gentleman.
“That I would never lie to you. I didn’t,” he replied, smoothly.
“You promised...” John started, heatedly.
A woman’s voice came from the other side of the wall. “So’s the chair. That was a solid
“Say it.” Sherlock resettled himself on John’s cock and began rocking back and forth again, faster this time, and with more pressure. John’s color shot up as his mouth dropped open. Gently massaging hands on his bum became more insistent, grasping handfuls of plump flesh… “SAY IT.”
Sherlock loved this little girl as if she were his own. She was, after all, John’s daughter, and was, therefore, more precious than gold to him. She even looked like him, with that broad smile and pug nose and those huge blue eyes. There was some of Mary there as well, but he dismissed that. She was John’s child, not the child of an assassin who had plotted with Moriarty to take John’s life from him, burning Sherlock’s heart out in the process. No, she was “Princess Rosamund”, queen of all she surveyed and, right now, she was carefully surveying Sherlock’s expression.
“Yes. Between your information and my foot soldiers, I have been able to ascertain what Moriarty is up to. The spider’s web is still active, and I can feel its strands vibrating with every move he makes on it.”
“And, now, a
A week. Plenty of time for them to get away to someplace we’ll never find them. Strangely, I decided that I didn’t actually care anymore. Let them go and be happy together. I doubted either one of them would live long enough to matter, anyway. I just felt sorry for the baby.
John pressed his lips together as he threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s curls and lowered his own head so that their foreheads rested against each other. He closed his eyes and said, “I love you, Sherlock. I love you so much it makes me crazy sometimes. Yeah, I think you’re perfect for me, but I know you’re not, you know, ‘perfect’ perfect. Neither am I, but I want to be a better man for you. I just don’t know how.”
, and yet, she said nothing. NOTHING!” He convulsively crumpled up the note in his hand. “Why? Why would she keep that from me?”
highly-experienced druglords; they’re uni fratboys who are trying to take a shortcut to wealth. Considering the fact that the two of them were only a semester away from flunking out of uni, I daresay we’re not dealing with any potential Moriartys here.”
A box. Sad music. Crying….
John threw his hands up into the air. “Oh, brilliant! First class! How long did you have to go to uni to figure

Silence.
“You know, I think I need the loo,” John remarked, out of nowhere. He looked around but there were no nearby outbuildings in sight. “I’ll just nip down to the dunes here and take a piss.” He pointed accusingly at his husband. “You don’t move from this spot, understand?”
Quietly, John rose from his chair and padded over to the bed. He sat beside Sherlock, who looked up at him with one of the saddest expressions John had ever seen. “I almost failed you, John,” Sherlock whispered, his voice tight with self-loathing. “I might have screwed up the investigation by reacting the way I did, because I couldn’t…”
Unless you had morning wood and a screaming bladder. Then it became problematic.
“Well, you
Sherlock rested his mug on one thigh. “You started it all this morning with that…that…” His hand waved angrily at the dresser, “white panty
he refused to acknowledge him.
“Obviously, someone was trying to kill Sherlock, or, at least, scare him away, because of something he
John laughed as Sherlock blushed. “Yeah, yeah, I think we’re dating now.
John gave him a quizzical look. Sherlock then opened his eyes and stated, “You should have the best of everything, including a better husband than me.”
The two men gazed at each other silently. Then John spoke.

I grinned at the description.
“Something like that.”

“Hey!” a muffled cry was heard through the wall, “give it a rest, will ya?”
“Aren’t you a bit short for a Storm Trooper?” Sherlock remarked, dryly.

to be saved,” came a soft, well-modulated baritone from the shadows. “Have you ever thought of that?”
“Yeah, not so much now that you’ve met ‘what’s-his-name’,” John groused as he turned to finally look at Sherlock, whose face was, for once, on a level with his own. “What exactly
“Ah, you mean the whole ‘burning your heart out’ thing. Yes, I can see that. Killing John...”

“I’ll lose my desire to do so, you said so yourself,” I challenged him. He reluctantly nodded. “Tell me, what will happen to John if I cross over?”
John faces his first case without Sherlock's help. Or, does he? The Spectral Detective is on hand, just in case...
“Our own landlady.”
John shook his head, his mouth straight-lining. “Sherlock, love, I don’t understand most of what you’re saying. Uni was a long time ago, and I only took a year of French anyhow.”
John snorted laughter and Sherlock favored him with a smile that looked almost normal. “I love your laugh,” Sherlock observed. “It…makes things seem better. More like the way life used to be.”
He heard a footfall behind him and spun around. He saw nothing. He had left the thug in the shadows a ways back, but he was on the alert for a new threat. These streets could be dangerous for anyone alone. The sooner he gained the high street, the better.
“I have a
Sherlock levered himself up on his elbows. “No one. Someone has taken exception to my presence in Florida…someone who feels threatened and has been trying to scare me off. Not working, of course, but I do have some idea of who it might be.”
“Please do,” John encouraged him, his grin becoming even more feral as he approached. “I’ve got no reason to live. I just walked out on my husband,  my work, and my home. I’ve got nothing left. But I’m not going to let a piece of shite like you push me around!”
. In his mind’s eye, he could see his friend; teeth gritted, hands in fists, shaking in anger.
Mycroft looked closely. Anger? Some. Resentment? Lots. Self-doubt and loathing?
John shrugged, suddenly all practicality. “You’ve done all the heavy lifting here. Lestrade can handle the rest. I just want to get you back home as soon as possible so I can have my way with you.” He took another sip, nonchalantly.

No, this was clumsy, an obvious hired hand, used by someone who normally didn’t bother with such banal means of getting someone to come into his, or her, web.

“So, you’ve been

Before long, Sherlock tested his arms and legs, then squirmed a little under John’s body.
Sherlock smiled softly. “Liar. You deserve everything good in life, and I’m here to make sure you get it.”

“About the same as yesterday. The blood clots in his brain have not moved or grown, and the streptokinase is dissolving them slowly. I
“I never lied to you,” John replied, still chewing on a mouthful of vegetables. “I never said...”
He picked up his coffee and waited. It took a bit longer than he had hoped for. So many questions! John just stood, one shoulder propped against the old red brick of the corner house, sipping from his cup while waiting for his flatmate to return.
Sherlock’s mien was both relieved and angry. “No,” he disagreed, through clenched teeth, “
All three people headed toward the back bedroom. John made sure the curtains were all closed while Sherlock laid the little girl down in the center of his sprawling bed. When John turned around, Sherlock was already lying on the far side of the bed, shoes off but otherwise dressed. He pulled up the comforter, which was already covering Rosie like a cocoon.

in charge now” as he circled his hips, causing his cock to shift around inside John’s arse, eliciting pleasured grunts and groans that Sherlock had never heard from John before. He reached up and pinched a nipple; the response was more than gratifying. John unwrapped his legs and, planting his heels into the mattress, pumped his hips up and down in opposition to Sherlock’s bold thrusts, each one of them crying out in time with their moments of deepest penetration. Faster and faster they moved, their movements becoming less and less controlled, until…
A huge sigh was audible across the ocean. “Okay, fine, whatever. Just, keep me informed, okay? I

that it would bind him to her. John may be an idiot sometimes...”
Sherlock gave John a dim look. “And you are…?”
Just when he’d started entertaining thoughts that being in a relationship with Sherlock the Sociopath might not be quite as bad as he thought it could be, Sherlock had died. More specifically, Sherlock had thrown himself off a building. To save John, although he didn’t realize that until much later. And, honestly, that just made everything that came after it that much worse. The guilt, the anger, the depression...he’d almost jumped off a building once or twice himself.  He’d even taken out his gun from time to time and toyed with it. Yet, there was always a niggling bit of doubt, that unshakable faith that Sherlock would return somehow. The occasional glimpse of a tall, long-coated figure ducking around a corner. Cryptic texts from no one. A familiar face through a window that disappeared before he could react. These things kept him insulated, isolated from everyone. Except Mary. She had actively worked to get under his skin, to make him move forward, to tell him there was life after Sherlock.

“Oh, please. Can’t we re-consider that as a course of action?” Sherlock retorted.

He was taking deeper breaths now, trying to bring himself back to coherence. “Now, I want you to turn your fingers so that your palm is up, bend them slightly and withdraw slowly. Feel for a lump or thickening—that’s my prostate. You know what it feels like when I touch yours…”

there for a minute, staring straight ahead at the blank door, blinking. He’d walked in on Sherlock in many degrees of dishabile, but never quite like...
A gentle nudge broke the spell. Sherlock’s beautiful face softened with a smile and his icy stare became liquid metal, warm and fluid. “So what were you thinking about while I was over there?” he teased, reaching up and brushing John’s hair away from his face. A breeze had picked up, wisping the strands into John’s face.

“Y-Y-Yes,” he replied through chattering teeth.
John kissed the shoulder beneath his chin. The form wiggled again. “Again.”
“You wouldn’t do that, doctor. That would be an unprovoked attack. After all, look what nearly happened to poor Sherlock when he did it to CAM,” she replied, all exaggerated sweetness and sarcasm. Sherlock could hear her voice moving away from the bed.
“I’m sorry, what is your name, sweetheart?” he asked, with marbles in his mouth.
Rosie was aghast. “Papa! You didn’t

“Anything else?” my friend asked, obviously fascinated by the latest turn of events. I just murmured, “Told you so.”
Sherlock smiled down at his husband and said, “You know, I feel a bit more fondly about this place now. Let’s spend the rest of the day here, cap it off at the hotel room as you have promised, and then we can meet with Agent Doyle tomorrow. Agreed?”
Stunned silence.
One of Sherlock’s eyebrows rose silently. “Couldn’t do it, or couldn’t get it up with her? After all, you have been ‘tainted’ by having sex with a man for all this time...”
Toby turned around and growled, adding a few gutteral

“Hey, you know me. Never miss a party.” He kissed Sherlock’s hand. “Love you.”
Sherlock, slowly and without breaking eye contact, slid his other arm around John’s shoulders and stepped in, again, without any threatening contact of bodies. John allowed it. Shaking his head, Sherlock said, “No. I can’t imagine it. I had my own private hell, but yours...” He took a chance and kissed John chastely on the forehead, “no, that...that is

“Yeah, but watching them take you

Sherlock slid his arm around John’s shoulders, still maintaining a non-threatening space between their bodies. John’s eyes were a dead, dull blue as he continued his story.
“What?”
“If it’s anything but a B-flat, I’m not interested,” Sherlock mumbled, as he flopped his pillow over his head. He’d gotten rather used to sleeping on his stomach since the sunburn.
“Worry can have that affect upon a person, baby brother. That’s why I have so little time for it,” Mycroft replied as he rose to his feet and stepped back. “Perhaps you would like to take your husband home now? Please, use my car,” he said, with a sweep of his hand.
“Look, man, look!” John urged, excitedly. “Around the front of the house! What do you see?”
by mouth. John thanked God for that fact every day.
“Holy shit! I’d forgotten what that felt like, too!” John’s eyes were wide, his expression one of shocked disbelief. He held up a hand in a dismissive gesture. “Don’t…don’t worry, babe. You didn’t do anything wrong. In fact, I think you did great. Really great. Phew!” He exhaled through pursed lips, still breathing heavily. ”So, now you know where the prostate is, right?” Sherlock sighed in relief and nodded. “You can remove your fingers now. I think I’m opened enough for you.”

Warm silver eyes sharpened as he considered his answer. “Those are not tears, Rosie. They’re water. You just splashed me, remember?” he replied, softly and with a trace of a smile.
There was a sensation in Sherlock’s heart, a sweet sadness at hearing that. He had liked Mary, despite her shortcomings. Her death had affected him, too, and to hear her daughter rejecting the name she had given her…
“John,” Lestrade ventured as he held John up, “I think that, maybe, you should go home for a bit. Get some rest. It’s still so soon after...”
Sergei’s face said it all. “You lied to me. You said you could get this M to come here. I told you what would happen if you lied to me...” He turned to his friend. “Get out. I have business here.”
“And you are here for…?”
“Oh, do you, now?” Sergei loomed close.
However, John’s
“Doubtful,” Sherlock replied, with all the haughtiness he could muster. “My partner is nothing, merely an excitable grunt on the front lines of the war on crime. His fighting skills make him useful, and he makes for prime bait material on the right occasion, but other than that...” He shrugged, causing his chains to rattle. “All brawn, no brain.”

Pursing his lips, Sherlock nodded.

Lestrade swore. “Right in front of us the whole time.” He turned his head toward John. “Wife is an avid flower enthusiast. Participates in all kind of plant shows. Too many, it turns out. Friends say that, recently, the husband had forbidden her from taking any more trips, since she was dipping a bit too far into the family funds for her ‘hobby’. Looks like it was him or the flowers, and you can figure out which one won!”
“Yes, I know. That’s why I carry Narcan with me at all times. If I hadn’t, you would have overdosed and died, right in front of your precious John.”

As the two set out toward the restaurant, John recovered himself enough to mutter, darkly, “If that little girl is all right, she’s grounded until she’s eighteen.”
“Arterial blood, too much. May have bisected the brachial artery,” he gritted out. “So much for our nice, quiet little honeymoon in Florida, eh?”
got both, a dangerous combination,” Mycroft acknowledged. “If you had been more like me, you would have turned your back on your nemeses and walked away, secure in your own intellectual superiority. Instead, you let them beat you down, torment you, treat you like some...lesser being.”
Slipping his shoes off, John undressed and put on loose-fitting pajamas before crawling into bed. It was too early to sleep but he suddenly felt a need to hold this man in his arms and try to chase the demons away from him. He slipped under the comforter and reached out a tentative hand to rest on Sherlock’s back. But before he touched, he whispered, “Sherlock,” so as not to startle him. Still no reply, so he gently touched the scarred back he had gotten to know so well. There was no startle, no shrinking away this time. Instead, the dark-haired head turned almost imperceptibly in acknowledgement of his presence.

Rosie’s eyes were suddenly tragic. “Did his daddy hurt him?”
“Got it!” John crowed in triumph. I grinned, so proud that my John had obtained his answer so quickly. I may have called him an idiot at times, but, in reality, I knew better. “Greg, tell Molly to run a test for...” he clicked on the link and read the text presented, “‘solanine’ or ‘solanadine’, both of which are highly toxic.”
“You know. Where is it?”
“John, take the seat out,” Sherlock murmured as he took Rosie’s weight into his lap. John shifted the booster seat to his other side as Sherlock laid the sleepy little girl down in the corner of the bench, safe from falls. Both men touched knees under the table to create a fall barrier for her, leading to a bit of blushing on both their parts.
John released Sherlock’s upright cock and pulled his lover’s head down for a deep kiss. “All up to you, love. I can wait.”
“Stop it!” Rosie yelled, stomping her bunny-slippered foot. “I call him Papa because he takes care of me and loves me just like you do, Daddy. He
Women did occasionally try to curry favor with the “new Great Detective”, but John was largely uninterested. He might go out to dinner with them, or a movie or show, but held back from going any further. It seemed, to my mind, that John might have felt that he’d offend me in some way, but I had found that, once the physical body was gone, jealousy wasn’t nearly the thing that it was before. I knew John loved me but I also knew that he had emotional and sexual needs requiring a live companion. Once, when John brought a woman to the flat, I manipulated the search feature of his laptop to show a book entitled “The Captain and the Lady; A Period Romance Novel.”
Sherlock nodded solemnly. “I agree, but your daddy’s practice has been very busy lately...”
“There, now, boys, don’t you feel better about it all?” Mrs. Hudson chirped as she clapped her hands in delight, back to her usual self again.
done.
Rosie cut him off, her voice smug. “Papa’s in love with you and wants to marry you, he said so himself.”
“Now, tell me where my friend is and who helped you, Whitey, and I’ll let you live. Last offer. After this, you start losing body parts.”
There came a point where logical thought was no longer possible. What replaced it was raw need, desire, a drive for fulfillment. Their bodies heaved together, Sherlock sometimes lifting both of them off the bed for a second or two in his passionate pursuit of stimulation, of completion. John bore down on him, using leverage to provide the maximum contact and movement of their cocks together. Words were forgotten; all that remained were mindless, guttural sounds of pleasure beyond reckoning as they came together, each one spewing forth their seed onto the other as their hands clutched at and sank into their partner’s skin. John swore and Sherlock moaned as their bodies spasmed and shook together, gradually fading away as the gripping pleasure abated. until they lay motionless in post-coital bliss. John melted atop Sherlock, whose arms and legs fell to the mattress limply.
“Yeah, you’re right, Sherlock. Guess I was feeling a bit like I was being pushed to the side by a newer model.”
“Not an idiot. We seem to have lost something here...” His head dipped down while his bum stuck up in the air dramatically as he practiced his oral art upon John’s receptive member. Soon, he had John’s hands in his hair, tightening spasmodically with every lick and suck.

“Yes,” Sergei’s dark bulk nodded. “Such a pity. Such a man should appreciate the precariousness of his position more.”
“Never heard him talk like that before,” another agreed.
We all chuckled. “That’s John,” Lestrade observed.
They turned and walked to the elevator and pressed the down button.

Sherlock raised his head, looked up into his husband’s face, and said, with a weary but impish smile, “Just don’t say I’m perfect, okay?”
Sherlock responded, shrugging ever so slightly. His gaze sharpened once he saw John’s perplexed expression. “Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, Jean? Y a-t-il quelque chose entre mes dents?”
“I said…”

a smell of death in the air. Over in the corner, I think.
Several nights in a row, I whispered into Mrs. Hudson’s ear while she slept that, maybe, she should leave 221B to John when she died, since she had no near kin and considered John to be like a son to her. It wasn’t a big sell by me; she was actually very receptive. John was astonished when, one day, Mrs. Hudson presented him with a copy of her will, in which she left the building, including the business property, to him. She also left him a small fortune that she had squirreled away when she had been married to a drug czar.  Still, I was please to have helped them both resolve a knotty problem on both their parts.
it is...” Sherlock heard John mutter with obvious relish.
“Sherlock, come on!” John cried out as he ran back to grab Sherlock’s arm and drag him to the ship. Once inside, Lestrade and Toby fired up the engines and, without the tractor beam to hold them, shot out into space and jumped to hyperdrive, just as Sherlock asked, “Is there an air freshener in here?”
John and Sherlock had, indeed, been able to surmount the language problem in the bedroom with remarkable ease. The rest of the time, their communications consisted either of texting, if it was important, or charades, if it was not. John also spent time brushing up on his French, which was

Seemingly out of nowhere, Wiggins appeared at John’s elbow. “See? I tolja we’d catch this bugger fur ya!” he beamed. “Now we just gotta get th’ information outa him.” He trotted over to the unconscious hulk on the ground, where he and the big man with the pipe trussed him up like a Christmas goose before he could awaken. Then one of the homeless men threw a large cup of water on his head. Another one slapped him in the face a few times—not because he needed to, but because he was enjoying it. Seems that this guy was extremely unpopular among the homeless, according to Wiggins; he was a bully who would shake down anyone who was unfortunate enough to cross his path when he was in “one of those moods”.

“What the fuck do you want, John?” Sherlock growled, his breathing ragged. It was obvious he had been close.
What? You’re going after whomever did this to me? You’ll make him pay for my death?
“Look!” Lestrade called out. “Isn’t that Mori-wan Iarty over there? And who’s he fighting?”
“To lambaste us for not keeping him informed of our progress on this case.”
and paid for it with an early death shortly after finally leaving him.”
John looked at him, affronted. “Why me?”
Sergei turned back to John and delivered a vicious backhand to the face. Sherlock could hear his head crack against the wall as the blow connected. He set his jaw to keep from screaming out John’s name.
After adjusting his glasses in thought, the doctor stated, “Unknown. It will depend upon whether the damage is reversible or not, and whether or not it extends to other areas. As I said before, we are dissolving the hematomas as quickly as possible to re-establish a viable blood supply, but if the brain has already been starved of oxygen, or if new bleeds occur, then…” He spread his hands helplessly.
A sigh. “Indeed.”
There lay John,

John smiled as he took a sip from his cup, reluctant to say
"Shit!"
Sherlock’s eyes dropped as he sipped his tea. “No, I’m not sure I’m ready for that yet. I still feel very… vulnerable. Like all my armor has been stripped away.”
“Where is what?” came the blasé answer.
John looked up, catching a sudden tone to his husband’s voice. He knew it; Sherlock had noticed something out-of-the-norm. “Maybe they heard we were just married…”
John sighed. “Why didn’t you tell me this before, Sherlock? It would have changed so much.”
. How do you convince someone you love that they are, indeed, worthy of being loved?”
Take a chance. This moment might not come again.
John got the hint. He did, however, consummate their relationship in his old bed, not mine, where he usually slept. This made me laugh because John always was the more morally-upstanding of the two of us, and that didn’t change over time. John even admitted it to me one evening, when he had been drinking, that he felt as though he would be cheating on me, despite my apparent approval. I squirted him with the lime in his drink.
John sucked in his breath. “Sherlock...you’re scaring me.”
“John, don’t you think it’s past Rosie’s bedtime?” Sherlock asked, his voice muffled.

Maybe this is something that will wear off.

Sherlock made an exaggerated show of rolling his eyes, like “Give me a break!”, before applying the lube to his fingers and working it around. “Done. Next?” His sharp eyes fairly glittered with anticipation.
“Explain,” Mycroft persisted, gently. John shook his head and tears spattered to the cement floor.
tell the empire where he was hiding out, so...my bad!”
As I stood there, soaking in the rich sunlight and calming breezes, a young man approached me from, well, out of nowhere. I didn’t see him walk up, but I certainly recognized him when he arrived. At least, I recognized what he was
one. His eyes closed of their own volition as he relaxed into the kiss, lips parted and sliding hotly against hers. Surprisingly, they were not as plush as Sherlock’s, nor were they both as yielding and demanding as his. His hand slid around the back of her neck, under the straight fall of hair, so unlike Sherlock’s curls, especially that nape curl he so loved to play with. His other hand cupped her face, feeling for, but missing, the sharp jut of cheekbone that he loved to run his fingertips over.
John thought a moment, then said, “Whatever you like, Billy. Frankly, I don’t care what you do ‘cause I won’t be here. Then call Lieutenant Lestrade—anonymously, of course--to pick up what’s left. Mention the kidnapping and get the name of his pal. It’s all going to hit the fan anyway when I get a hold of that bitch.”
“Let’s go in here, Sherlock. It’s darker and cooler than it is out here,” John coaxed.
Sherlock grinned down at him. “All around, I think it was a good…honeymoon, don’t you, John?”

“Neurologist said something about possible damage to the language pathways in the brain. Your neural network is bypassing the damaged or non-functional areas so that you can communicate.”
In the hallway, Sherlock posed in his garb, arms over his head, forearms resting against the walls, hips canted, eyes smoldering. As John watched, he
seemed out of the ordinary, a bit extreme, even for him. John knew he was going to have to go in there and brave the beast in his lair. He just wasn’t looking forward to it. Not at

John turned his gaze to Sherlock, who feigned innocence.
something I had ever expected to hear from Sherlock in this lifetime. I mean, I admire him, I respect him, I like him as a person, I would follow him to the ends of the earth, if he asked me…

John could feel his face burning. Here was this man, superior to him in

John’s glare shut him up. Sherlock retreated behind his book, but not before giving a warning glance to Rosie.
“Ever the bureaucrat, Mycroft,” Sherlock chided him. “You really
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmured. “Just...”
Even the neighbors, hearing his pitiful cries, hammered on the wall and demanded that John relent and spare the suffering detective.
Ping.
Sherlock kissed John’s ear and said, “An imprecise science. The only way to negate the past is to confront it and remove its power to harm you. You did that for me.”
A polite knock on the door prompted John to put on a robe and cover the still-slippery Sherlock with his
Another couple of quiet steps and the rustle of a sheet at the entrance to the kitchen. “Did you...stay in my room last night?”
The smile edged up just a little more. “Possibly. After all, I did foolishly think I might be worthy of you,”  Sherlock finished, his defensive mask starting to slip, as John heard the slightest crack in that otherwise controlled tone.
“Not so thrilled with the aftercare, though,” Sherlock sniffed.
Instead, it flew across the room and smashed into the opposite wall.

Annoyed. “If you say ‘good’, I will have you committed!”
“Darth Mycroft. Only you could be so tedious,” he remarked, dryly.
John’s eyes flicked up to meet Sherlock’s. Sherlock slowly raised his book up until the only thing John could see was his eyes.

never did.”
As he withdrew, John noticed a small boy in the seat in front of them staring back at them with wide eyes. He then turned around and declared, to his mother, that the short man in the back seat had touched the tall man in a ‘not-good place’, and wasn’t that supposed to be a bad thing? The mother turned around and gave them a dirty look before she said, “You should both be ashamed of yourselves! In front of a child…”
“No, but Agent Doyle had one and it required a
“I can’t even
Except he hadn’t. Instead, he had became the best friend any man could want. Even won over Mary, for God’s sake. How was he supposed to get over his feelings for Sherlock when Sherlock was right there, all the time, being just the best person he could ever be? But, no, John’s own trust issues had come roaring back to the surface, demanding to know how he could ever trust Sherlock again, when the real issue was, how could he ever trust his own instincts again? After all, John had hated Sherlock for having faked his death and disappeared for two years—but it had been done to save him from Moriarty’s cartel. Sherlock, the man he no longer trusted fully, hadn’t shot Mary, but, rather, Mary, the woman he had chosen over Sherlock, who had shot his dearest friend in a selfish bid to keep her assassin past a secret. Having made those kinds of miscalculations, how could John ever trust his own decisions again?
“Are you all right?”
“Ruining my resale value, eh?”
Her face softened into shock. “Oh, no, dear! I thought you would have a lovely honeymoon in a beautiful resort! It never crossed my mind that…”

“Fibber!” Rosie declared.
“My God, Sherlock…”

Another couple of barks.
, it must be. Give me your notes and I’ll discuss them with Lestrade. Why don’t you go get a coffee and wait for me over by that building? I’ll be back as soon as I can shake him loose.” He winked and grinned before sauntering off toward the inspector and his men.
John’s jaw dropped. Sherlock said, “She does have a point, John.”
“HOW. CERTAIN?” I repeated.
221B Baker Street was quiet as the grave. Of course, one could always hear the street life outside the drafty windows, but the flat itself used to be bustling with life. There used to be well-palmed newspapers sitting next to freshly-used coffee mugs and crumb-laden dishes, photos and newspaper clippings stuck to the mirror over the fireplace, and the sound of classical violin music. Now there was drab silence. No life stirred within these walls anymore. The life had been extinguished with the light in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Fleur!”
“I...he’s
“Oh, no trouble, Sherlock,” came the bird-like voice of their landlady, Martha Hudson. “I knew you two had just arrived and could probably use a nice cuppa. Americans have no idea how to make it, you know. Dumping all that tea in the harbor! Disgraceful!”
much more than that!
John stared. Sherlock could almost see the cogs in his brain moving through the unshuttered windows of his eyes. Disconnections being reconciled, traumatic memories and compassion battling heartfelt wishes...so many permutations going on behind those blue irises.

Agent Doyle squatted down beside them. “Mr. Holmes, you are a fucking maniac,” he said, simply and with great feeling.
“Billy!” John hissed, motioning for him to come over. Wiggins looked both ways before crossing the alleyway, making sure he had not been observed. He looked as disheveled as usual but smelled significantly better than most of his colleagues in the network. “What news do you have?”
Sherlock froze in place. The thought of physical contact was still abhorrent to him after what he had endured. The welts on the front of his body were largely healed, both by time and John’s tender, diligent ministrations, but the memory of the pain and the humiliation were still bright and fresh. He breathed in a steadying breath and released it, then said, shakily, “Yes, of course.”
The sound of a toilet flushing. This time she didn’t even try to conceal her entrance into the room from him. She walked with the confidence of a lioness stalking her prey. He felt a gloved hand touch his chest high up, trailing light fingers down his body, stopping only to trace the marks she had left on him. “What a pity to mar such a lovely work of art, but you can’t make an omelet without whipping a few eggs,” she laughed, a cackle that made her sound deranged and dangerous. She lightly ran a finger over one of his nipples, squeezing and twisting at the same time until he groaned. “Oh, you are such a soft, sensitive boy, aren’t you?” she mocked him. “I could have given you such pleasure, but, instead, I’ll take
“Mmm?” Still largely incoherent.
“I’m going to kill Lestrade,” John gritted out.
John grinned like a hungry shark. “Have it your own way, mate,” he said, striding purposefully toward the shadowy figure, his hands clenched. The figure backed up warily,  still waving the knife in front of him.
“We were being followed…” he started before John interrupted.
“No, no, no!” Sherlock backed off immediately. “No! Nothing to worry about,
“Hey, guv, give us the watch and the wallet,” a voice said from behind him.
John stared. “Oh, shit, that’s right. You’re...”

John began to kiss his husband’s neck as he slid their cocks together between them. In between kisses and toothy nips on that exquisitely pale expanse of throat, he murmured, “You’re wrong, love. You’re… beautiful… gorgeous…sexy…breathtaking…amazing…” as he used mouth and hands to stimulate his lover’s body. Sherlock’s eyes were half-closed, his swollen lips parted, his hips rolling against his lover’s. John could feel both of their cocks growing longer and thicker, Sherlock’s easily catching up to John’s previously turgid member. Warm dampness eased the movement between them while increasing the growing sensations in both their groins.
A wan chuckle left Sherlock’s lips. “I guess no good deed goes unpunished, as the old saying goes. I tried to keep her from hurting others but end up being put in the line of fire myself. John,” he reached an arm back and John caught it, interlacing his short fingers with Sherlock’s long, slender ones. His voice was full of pain. “A bullet, a knife wound, being beaten and starved and deprived of sleep—these things I could deal with. What she did to me was—unspeakable.”
Mycroft shrugged. “Same as usual, trying to run a busy Empire by herself. You know Father is virtually

of them. I kept my vow.”
John shrugged. “You know Sherlock. His methods aren’t always straightforward but his conclusions are usually spot on. I’ll have to research it on the internet...”
John hesitated. “No. I was just in the mood to talk, frankly. Probably would have sat there complaining that my husband didn’t understand me or some rot like that...”
Part of the burrito nodded.
“That was

And John was the one to know it as truth.

“NO! NOT THAT!” Jake howled as something glass shattered against a piece of furniture. “THAT WAS MY SALESMANSHIP AWARD! YOU BITCH!” Then, “Put…put the knife away, babe. It’s you, it’s always been you…”

He brought the tray with the tea cups and sandwiches over and set them on the table in front of Sherlock. He barely looked up, choosing, instead, to wrap the comforter over the top of his head.
“John. Is.
“Naughty, naughty, Sherlock. Don’t you know you’re not supposed to talk back? I guess I’ll have to punish you some more.” He heard her strut down the length of his body until she reached what he estimated to be his groin area. “Oh, look—another playground for me, and it looks so forlorn, so forgotten.” He felt her riding crop touch the head of his cock, rubbing it gently but firmly with the leather paddle at the end. He could feel it began to respond slightly.
Through the wall, the same female voice yelled, “The chair is a dick! Punish it!”
“She’s not smart. That’s not good,” Rosie opined as she cupped her hands and tried to pour water over her head. Sherlock picked up a soft cup and helped her rinse her wavy hair clean. “Papa! I can do it myself!” she chided.
“Good,” Sergei grunted. “And for

He walked over to a device resting on the mantle, next to my embedded knife, the one John had never removed. Sentiment again. “The researchers called this a GetBox. It uses three different forms of energy to, supposedly, enable the dead to communicate directly with us.”
“Honeymoon,” John corrected, over his shoulder.
John’s eyes left Rosie’s and traveled over to Sherlock’s, but
could. “Agreed. So, what is it that you want?”
John sat where he was, smiling down at the floor. I walked over to him and laid a hand on his shoulder, emboldened by my ethereal state. “Good work, John.”
John shrugged. “Hey, I was hoping...”
“OK, Sherlock, where are they?” John asked, as he desperately pawed through their shared underwear drawer.
She rumpled her nose. “That’s not the same. Mrs. Hudson takes care of you like a mum. I mean young ladies.” She paused. “Like the ones Daddy dates.”
“How did you find us?” was the first question on John’s lips before the paramedic applied salve to the split areas.
“John needs medical assistance, too, Lestrade,” said Sherlock through his shivers.
John closed his eyes as he chuckled to himself. Sherlock Holmes, the great detective…”Yes, Sherlock,” he replied. His voice was still blandly agreeable.
John grinned shyly. “Yeah. You, me, dinner at Angelo’s. What do you say?”
They sat together in silence, the only sound that of Sherlock stealing another treat and gobbling it down. John chuckled to himself but it was felt by Sherlock.

Drawing himself up to his full imperious height, Mycroft donned his best impassive expression. “No need to worry about
“And mine is brilliant,” John said, through a mouthful of fish, and the two dissolved into laughter.
Sherlock waved John back and walked to the door. “Have you defused the device?” he asked.
"John! You left me at the crime scene? Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?"
A long, slender finger came to rest gently against Rosie’s cupid-bow lips as he shushed her. “Fleur, your daddy has demons...”
Sherlock raised his head, his expression both cross and crestfallen. “No? Why not?”
Sherlock smiled derisively. Fortunately, Sergei was a victim of the darkness as much as
“You are lucky you were sitting where you were, Sherlock,” Mycroft admonished him, sternly. “Otherwise you would have been in serious condition, too.” The voice softened. “I was...quite distraught when I received word through my agents. I...can’t imagine the world without Sherlock Holmes in it.”
“No argument from me.”
What, hold on, he’s...crying? And is that Lestrade with him? Yeah, definitely Lestrade…

“Hello, my friends! And how are you feeling today?” Sergei sounded positively jovial.
John hailed a cab and gave the cabbie address. Finally, at least he had a direction to go in. Something nasty was chewing at his gut and he wasn’t feeling too good about it.
It was as difficult to hear the words as it was to get them out. “You’re…bi-sexual. You said so yourself.”
“Are you here for Sherlock?” Mycroft asked. “I know you have tried to turn him to the Light Side before, but he is
“Oh, he’s here, didn’t I mention that? I almost thought you had come here to
“That little tart stole me wallet!” he yelled, then regaled them with tales of what he was going to do to her when he caught her. His words amounted to nothing, however, when another, even larger man came up behind him and clocked him over the head with a metal pipe. The pipe emitted a melodious sound as it impacted the guy’s skull, sending him to the cobblestones below.
“Excuse me, what?” John asked, taken off guard by her comment.
, you ask?” John snapped back. “Yes, I’m fu...absolutely sure. I subscribed to her page after I met her. She seemed to have forgotten that. So, there I am, sitting along, getting all these messages about how horrible her date is and she’s so lucky she found out sooner rather than later what a cheapskate I am and how she’s going to ditch me...”

very surprised to discover that your sons were still alive and sending you money every month from their criminal enterprise.”
John’s eyes rolled eloquently and his blood pressure leapt into the stratosphere. “
Sherlock feigned shock. “No? Why ever not? It’s a perfectly good name...”
With one last shiver, John collapsed. As his erection faded, Sherlock loosened his limbs and lay bonelessly beneath his lover. Panting, neither one addressed the other; they just lay together, basking in a hormonal bliss that would be gone all too soon.
Just you wait, love...

He shook his head to shake the thought loose. No need for falling into the same trap to which Sherlock had succumbed. He had to be his saviour, not his cellmate.

“Gone?” John repeated, obviously crestfallen. “Where?”

Whitey’s complexion was beginning to resemble his name. John continued, still smiling. “And then,” he moved the gun to the side of Whitey’s cheek, pointing inward, “I’ll blow off your nose and sinuses, maybe your eyes, too. I’m not sure. I might save those for later.” John took a moment to lay a hand companionably on Whitey’s shoulder before continuing. “And you know what the best part of it is?

. He nodded, subdued for the moment.
Breaking eye contact, John nodded and stepped away, out of the circle of Sherlock’s comforting arms. He sat back down at the table and attempted to eat something, but the lump in his throat was too big to swallow. Sherlock sighed through his nose and moved around to the other side of the table. He tried to find something to say, but couldn’t, choosing, instead, to sit down and accept one of the plated John had dished out for him. They ate together in silence or more precisely, picked at their plates in silence. There was no real eating done. The food was quite cold by then.
