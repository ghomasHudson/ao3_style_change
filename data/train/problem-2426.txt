Dean leans back in the chair and crosses his arms. "I don't trust you. That first day I met you, you smelled like gunpowder and death. You smelled like
Dean leans up and wraps his hands around Castiel’s face, pulling him into a kiss, mouth gentle against Castiel’s own. Castiel kisses back, licking into his mouth and tasting Dean’s tongue. He tastes like cherries, like he’s been sneaking away from his garrison just to come down and eat pie, which isn’t necessarily unusual for him, and endlessly amusing to Castiel.
Dean shivers at the thought, heat building in his gut. He leans down and swipes his tongue over the head of Castiel's cock before sucking it into his mouth. Castiel whines so loudly that Dean has to reach up and smack a hand over his mouth so he doesn't wake the others. Castiel's breath is hot under his palm as he pants, and when Dean slides his mouth further over his cock, Castiel bites into his skin. Dean hollows his cheeks and sucks harder, enjoying the ache in his jaw and the taste of the other man's cock on his tongue. He splutters when Castiel's hips come off the bed and he shoves his cock further into Dean's throat, and Dean’s dick throbs in his pants.
Dean growls at them, baring his teeth and readying himself to attack before the amused one holds his hands up in defence. "We just came to see Rowena."
When Castiel has filled the tank, Dean sends him back into the car and brings Emma out with him, taking her to find the toilet. It's inside, behind the counter, and Dean opens the door to hush her inside, only to be barreled to the floor by a grinder.
"Fuck, Dean, more. Give me more," Castiel groans into the sky, hand sliding from Dean's shoulder into his hair, fingers going tight in the strands. It hurts, almost too much, and Dean's hips stutter up. He gives Castiel more.
He gets nervous again when he realizes that now Castiel's stretched he has to... well get to it. Get in him.
He waits by the car for Castiel to finish up in the office. He kisses him again, then sends him off with a promise to see him later.
Claire scoffs and throws her hands in the air. "Weeks! You've known me for weeks, why didn't you just
"Because I wanna make out, but I also don't want to crash - cause if you hurt my baby? Forget about it." When Benny has turned off the ignition, Dean unbuckles his seat belt and climbs into Benny's lap, reaching down and holding Benny's face in his hands as he kisses him.
Castiel comes in through the door into the garage, which Dean had left open from him, and he's wringing his hands nervously. "Hello." Dean got his kiss in earlier, so he doesn't mind that Castiel goes for Benny first. He sits out the counter next to Benny and leaves his keys in the bowl with Dean and Benny's. None of them say anything for a while, Benny's chewing the only sound in the room until Castiel blurts, "I don't want to stop this."
Dean drags his claws out of Crowley and climbs to his feet as he shifts into his human form. "Pathetic."
“Well take them back to the hotel? And I think I can produce a dead body for them to eat,” Dean replies, reaching behind him to touch the wound on the back of his head. It’s deep and he’s still bleeding, and he thinks it might need stitches.
Dean watches him go, shooting a look at Aidan when he's still staring. Aidan doesn't look away, and Dean's about to tell him off when the younger man finally opens his mouth to speak. "Okay, I don't mean to be rude, but I thought you were with the guy that works at the bar with you and Josephine."
"Gabriel!" Castiel shouts before Dean's even reached his brother. The archangel appears in the room in a crack of thunder. He's covered in blood, but none of it seems to be his, and his eyes shine as the silhouettes of his wings flare against the concrete walls. He's putting on a show, probably because he'd expected to be dropped in the middle of danger. "Heal him."
Benny's amused, eyes wrinkled, and when he opens his mouth to speak he's interrupted by the man across the bar who's sitting on one of the stool's nursing a tumbler of dark liquid. "I'd really prefer you didn't. And I had the hydraulics removed when my brother gave it to me."
Castiel's mouth turns up into a frown as he thinks. "Well, yes, a few things - fuck." Castiel grimaces. "Fucking Crowley."
Castiel’s suddenly reminded of the first time he convinced Dean to try breath play. The angel had very happily catered to absolutely every one of Castiel’s other kinks, but he’d been terrified of hurting Castiel worse than he could fix. It had taken weeks to convince him, and a couple times when Dean had let Castiel do it on him to show him how it worked. When he’d finally agreed, Castiel had come so hard he’d blacked out and scared the absolute hell out of Dean. Dean had sworn he’d never do it again, but two weeks later he did, and Castiel came just as hard as the first time.
Dean shrugs and then nods his head. "John used to disappear a lot, the years after the fire," he doesn't really think he needs to explain that one, everyone knows how Dean's mom died now. He thinks Castiel will remember even if it's been twenty years, it kinda sticks out in your mind. "He met Adam's mom Kate in Minnesota, I was eleven, Sam was six at the time? He ran back home before Kate could tell him she was pregnant. When she got sick in '97 - stage four breast cancer - she hired a private investigator to find John, put it in her will that he was to go there when she died. He was seven I think? He just showed up on our doorstep, John lost it. He ended up living with Bobby for a while and when Dad died and custody of them shifted to me, I moved him back into the house." Dean nods his head solemnly. "He's a good kid, smart. His mom was a nurse, so he went to med school, he's doing oncology, wants to help people, thinks he needs to make up for not being able to help his mom. His graduation is at the end of the school year and he's top of his class."
"Well he's not wrong," Dean replies. He's a bartender in a small town, and he was a teenager in the 90's with an alcoholic father,
Dean waves the hand of the arm he's using to hold Jack dismissively, shaking his head. "Oh, yeah, I'm fine. It's not like an omega's heat, I just sort of turn into a jerk for three days every six months. Knotting helps, that's why a lot of people think it's like a heat, I guess? I'm just moody and possessive, so…"
Dean gets more and more nervous as the time goes on with no sign of an angel, until finally, ten minutes before they're supposed to leave, five minutes after they've sent Kaia, Patience and Alex to Rowena's townhouse in Minsk, a crack of white light shines through the room. When it clears, the man it reveals is short and svelte, with caramel-coloured hair and Grace-shining blue eyes. He smells strongly of power, as much power as Lucifer and Michael have. He's not a simple angel, he's another archangel. Dean knows very little about biblical canon, but he does know that there are four archangels: Michael, Lucifer, Raphael and Gabriel.
Dean nods, and Deanna disappears with the car keys to check the car. Mary's still crying, so the tylenol hasn't kicked in or she's definitely hungry (possibly both). When Deanna reappears, formula-less, Dean takes a second to decide what to do. He could wake Sam and Eileen up, find out what they want him to do, or he can go out and get it himself. He'd rather that, than wake them up, they need the sleep.
"Well, it worked," Dean says, smiling gently at Castiel, who's still too blown to do anything more than frown down at himself. He looks like he's not entirely sure this is happening, and if he were to blink he'd find himself a raven again. "Do you remember anything?"
Someone calls Dean's name from the hallway that leads to storage and offices, and when he rushes into it, he finds human-Sam on the floor bleeding from a large jagged cut just below his ribcage. There's a lot of blood, and Dean's not sure he'll live long enough for werewolf healing to kick in.
"Okay, ow," Dean says, kicking his leg out to dig his toes into Castiel's hip in retaliation as the angel climbs up onto the bed with him. Castiel sits across Dean's thighs and leans over to kiss him again, clutching Dean's face in his hands. When Castiel trails a line of kisses down Dean's chin, to his throat, Dean hums and says, "Say it again."
They kiss while Benny fingers him open, fingers strong and sure. Dean feels a bit like he's about to fall apart, and the only thing truly holding him together are the hands on his body - Benny's at his waist, Castiel's around his shoulders.
Castiel sighs, staring up at the ceiling and shaking his head before turning back to Dean. "No one really knows, Dean. I think the power is just too great for them to handle."
Dean shoots him a smug smile and taps his chin as he waits patiently for Benny to finish before they walk to the Impala, jostling each other as they go. They get into an argument at the front of the car about who should drive, because Dean most definitely had too many beers, and he only agrees to hand over the keys when Benny leans over for a kiss.
"Ay, sit. We'll leave soon," Benny tells him, holding him down with a hand on his thigh. Castiel has a hand on Dean's other thigh, and instead of thinking about climbing out of their grips and throwing hands with a bitch, he thinks very hard about their fingertips leaving bruises on his flesh. Hard being the operative word.
"The pants I brought were in the laundry. My mom kept some of my old clothes in the basement. I'm surprised these fit. The jacket was in the box, too, haven't seen it since I was sixteen. My mom made a comment about Satan or something, I hid it so she couldn't throw it out. It was in the rafters of the attic." Castiel explains when he's standing in front of Dean. He looks nervous.
Castiel laughs and disappears from the camera's view for a moment, coming back with a pair of briefs on and a can of soda, taking a sip. It occurs to Dean that he wouldn't be pulling their legs as much as he is unless it was something he knew they were going to be happy with. "You got the job at Montana State didn't you, you asshole?"
Dean’s grin is toothy as he climbs off of Castiel and disappears in the direction of the hallway. Castiel stands and goes in search of the keys for the truck, leaving Gabriel and Claire a note on the coffee table. In it, he tells them he’s healed and is with Dean in case they wake before he returns. Castiel isn’t stupid enough to think they aren’t going to know exactly what he and Dean are doing, so he doesn’t bother coming up with a convincing lie.
"I dunno, dicks don't normally look like this, right? Like you'd see on a model or something? I don't know what I'm saying, Cas, just ignore me." Castiel really does try hard not to laugh at him, but Dean is just so flustered and nervous and it's just so sweet but also completely fucking hilarious. "Cas,
"Alright," Castiel replies, nodding his head. He's trying to figure out how to bring up the things he wants to say to Dean, the things he's been feeling for far longer than he'd care to admit when Dean interrupts him.
dragging him out of the place. Castiel ends up driving, because he's the most sober out of the three of them. It's the first time he's driven Baby, so Dean sits in the front with him, just to keep an eye on him, though he knows Castiel can drive a car older than him without crashing it. He directs Castiel, but he doesn't direct him straight back to town, sending him up the mountain to the lookout.
Without waking either girl he fishes his phone out of his pocket and mindlessly scrolls through Facebook for ten minutes before he opens up his text history with Benny and Castiel. The bastards have been
Dean doesn't rise to the bait. The gun is a hand he doesn't want to play until he has to, and he doesn't want to give away. "Where. Is. he."
Dean groans when he realises that Castiel is going to drag this out as much as he possibly can, because he's an asshole. "Fuck, Cas, there were two in Montana."
When they get back to the bunker a few days later, Sam and Rowena have gotten the low down about the ghoul kids from Garth.
Dean shakes his head solemnly, though he knew a lot of his classmates suspected him. He was a bag of dicks in high school, though that he would've never done. Would've been a bit hypocritical of him. "They suspected me, but I suspected Meg. I think she was pissed off that he wouldn't sleep with her."
and then, as he's two fingers in and stretching his fingers as far inside Castiel as they can possibly go, he touches something inside Castiel that makes his whole body light on fire and then melt like candle wax.
Dean looks over at Castiel who's staring at a t-shirt Claire's asked him to hold for her. He looks very confused and Dean's unsure if it's more hilarious or endearing.
Dean shoots her a doubtful look but nods her off when she goes to contact the witch, leaving Dean, Castiel, and Sam in the kitchen.
let him touch." Krissy nods and Dean watches them both trudge over to the Mazda before he approaches Castiel. "Hey, go okay?"
"Serve Lionel then get lost," Benny tells him, pointing at the old man at the end of the bar, waving his empty glass insistently. The man's in almost every night and Benny knows Dean hates him.
The sun sets at five thirty and Castiel shifts into his human form. With all of Rowena's things packed, they set out through a portal that lands them in the middle of a spacious living room where six women are waiting for them. Dean knows which woman is the dreamwalker and which is the psychic the minute they land: one smells like magic and unfamiliar worlds and the other smells like power. The two older women in the room smell like gunpowder and are dressed in sheriff uniforms, while one of the younger women is dressed in hospital scrubs and smells like blood, death and antiseptic solution. The last of the women smells like gunpowder as well, but she doesn't hold herself like a cop does, so if Dean didn't know any better he would label her as a hunter. He decides to keep his eye on her. Underneath the gunpowder, blood and power they all smell like trepidation and fear.
Once they're finished and the board games are packed away in the closet, they go through the motions of getting ready for bed.
Dean groans loudly, moving his plate forward and bracing his arms on the table, hiding his face in them. "I'm never sleeping with you again." He mutters, angling a kick to Benny's shin under the table, only feeling minutely better when Benny swears. When Dean looks over at Castiel, his eyes are wide, and he's blinking a lot, like he's trying to process what's just been said. "Please, for the love of God, ignore him. He thinks he's funny, he's fucking not."
Jody has made a roast dinner, two chickens and more roast vegetables that Dean's ever seen in his life. Dean can't even remember the last time he ate a home-cooked meal he didn't kill himself - maybe back when he was living with Tasha. It makes a strange feeling, something akin to homesickness, grow in his gut. He misses his families, the one that birthed him, and the other that raised him, and he doesn't remember the last time he felt like that. Years, maybe.
"Here," he tells Castiel, pointing at the ground beneath their feet. It seems like any other part  of the field, with tall sunflowers and rich earth, but deep below the surface, through layers of dirt, Dean can smell death, like burnt wood and old bones.
Castiel nods his head and watches as Dean takes a deep breath and begins climbing his way down Castiel's body. He stops when he reaches Castiel's groin, chewing his lip as he turns his head down from Castiel's face to look at his cock. He hesitates and Castiel tells him, "We don't have to, Dean."
,” Castiel begs, tugging helplessly at his wrists trapped in Dean’s hands. “Please, please, please, please.”
Castiel takes a hold of Dean's hips and pulls him forward, lining his cock up with Dean's hole and slowly pushing in. Dean hadn't forgotten about how thick Castiel's dick was, but he's getting a reminder anyway, and it's not the most comfortable experience in the universe. He leans back on his arms and lets his head fall back so he's staring up at the concrete ceiling of the garage, and Castiel goes slow, without having to be asked, stopping every now and then to let Dean adjust. Dean takes a breath and tilts his hips up, turning his head to find Benny. Benny's standing to the left of them, in front of the hood, and reaches over to pull him in for a kiss, meeting him halfway. The distraction works, cause Dean barely notices Castiel bottoming out, hips pressed to Dean's ass, fingers digging into his hips.
She reaches up onto the shelf for the bottle and sits it down on the counter with his other purchases, scanning them all through and putting them in his bag. Once he's paid and as he’s turning to leave, she says, "Hey, are you looking for a job?" Dean looks up at her, a little shocked. "Sorry, I just mean that one of my night kids left for college?"
"No, Cas. I don't want to stop. At all." Dean takes his pants off and reaches for the box of condoms. "Do you? Want to stop?"
Dinner is far louder and more raucous than any dinner they've had since the week following Chuck's defeat. Dean spends most of the night with his hand on Castiel's knee, and Castiel spends most of the night wondering if Dean would taste like pasta and beer or something else if Castiel kissed him.
"Okay, okay," Dean says with a chuckle, pulling away just as the waitress returns with Dean's steak and burger.  "Quit being gross," he tells Castiel before thanking the waitress as she sets the food in front of him.
Dean traces one of his slick fingers over the furl of Castiel's hole before sliding it inside to the last knuckle, grinning when Castiel whimpers. Castiel's body is tight and hot around Dean's finger, and Dean decides then that he's definitely going to need extra prep, or Dean's not going to be able to get his dick in him, and even if he does, he's going to come way too fast.
"Alright," Castiel replies, nodding his head. He's trying to figure out how to bring up the things he wants to say to Dean, the things he's been feeling for far longer than he'd care to admit when Dean interrupts him.
"Hold on," Dean says, then faces Rowena. "Their methods are too extreme, the last time they battled they killed millions of humans. Not all of them are bad, Rowena, I don't want to live at the expense of innocents."
Castiel's smile is bright and shining, like the sun finally peeking out from behind the clouds after hours of grey skies. He reaches over and pulls Dean forward by his collar so they meet in the middle, kissing him hard and fast. He really is making it extremely hard for Dean.
Dean rolls his eyes, tilting his head back to give Castiel more room. "It's not you I'm worried about."
Dean shoots him an amused look, still patting the baby's back until he finally burps and Dean can continue feeding him. "Babies do tend to be small, yes." Castiel raises an eyebrow then rolls his eyes. "I wonder if it would kill him if I actually ate him, cause that's a pretty good way to get rid of him."
Castiel's nails carefully scrape down Dean's spine and Dean shivers, rolling onto his belly, sliding his hands under the pillow his head is resting on. He hums and leans down to press a kiss to the flesh of Dean's back, under his rib cage before he starts to speak. "I'm going to eat an entire chocolate block myself, then we'll share a bottle of whiskey and fuck ourselves stupid." Dean snorts, and he can feel the smile on Castiel's lips as he leans down to press a kiss to his skin again. Castiel then says, "Find a cabin in the woods, move in with you and Jack, find more wayward orphans to adopt, spend years finding out if a shapeshifter and a werewolf can have biological children together." Dean hums in amusement, feeling more and more relaxed as the seconds tick by, his body melting into the mattress. "Bond with you, marry you, grow old with you."
“Yes. It doesn’t mean I will. Keep your eyes on the road,” Castiel warns him. He clears his throat and Dean sees him flip through the file pages out the corner of his eye before he continues. “Victim number two - someone who looked like victim number two - killed victim number three. Wait… it wasn’t just skin that was removed, quite a bit of flesh was taken.”
"Seriously? You're pregnant?" Jack asks, bouncing up and down in his seat with a broad smile on his face. Castiel doesn't understand why he seems to be so excited, but given how depressed he'd been as his powers were failing, Castiel doesn't care why he's happy, as long as he stays that way.
He starts in at the belly, removing a chunk of its flesh to chew on a few feet away so he can watch the raven. Now that he's opened the belly of the moose it takes the opportunity to feed on the flesh flayed open by his teeth. It shrills at him, like in thanks.
He had texted Benny to let him know he'd be late, and as always, Benny was teasing, but completely understanding. He doesn't ask him to meet him in the backroom to help him release the anger before he works, cause he knows Benny will say yes, then get all pissy about Dean being
Dean throws his hands in the air and groans. "Twenty years, for God's sake. I didn't tell her, Castiel, would've been a little fucking hypocritical of me. I was a dick, but I wasn't a homophobic dick." Castiel grimaces and Dean can tell he doesn't believe him. "Dude, you're the reason I came out to my dad. Who the fuck told you I told your mom?"
“I can think of a few things,” he replies with a grin, pushing his chair back so he can stand, climbing into Dean’s lap. “Good idea?”
won’t go ahead with it. Dean watches as Castiel kneels on the edge of the bed and shuffles his way towards Dean, leaving his treasures in the mattress by Dean’s thigh.
"Oh! She'd tried hiding the test in the bathroom trash can but I accidentally kicked it over as I was trying to get out of my jeans when they were caked in ghoul guts," Dean explains, shrugging his shoulders, mouth turned up into a grin. "I knew it wasn't mine, and I suspected it wasn't yours or Sam's."
They wait for ten minutes, then thirty, then an hour, and Dean's starting to worry something's gone wrong until finally, a flap of wings brings Castiel and Gabriel. Dean climbs to his feet when he sees Castiel stumble, reaching out to hold him upright and check him for injuries. He's bleeding from a cut on his cheek, most likely from an angel blade, and Dean inspects it carefully.
Dean wakes when Castiel shakes him by the shoulder. It's still dark out, and despite not actually knowing the time, it feels like
Dean grimaces. "Do you remember how I told you about Lisa? Her ex came back, and I sort of thought that was the end of it, but she didn't want to end it with either of us, so I sort of suggested that she dated the both of us. It was just sort of parallel for a while, then he ended up moving in with Lisa, and we were all dating for about six months before Lisa got pregnant. He ended up pushing me out, and I didn't have the energy - I wasn't in the right mental state to fight back, so I left. Ben ended up being his, anyway."
Castiel rests his elbows on his knees and wipes roughly at his face, digging his knuckles into his temples before he says, "He was supposed to send me to Rowena so I could tell her - fuck I can't remember. I got bits and pieces back, not the whole story. I still don't remember most of my life, I don't remember my family. I don't remember why Crowley put the block up, or why he made it so strong." Castiel groans around another grimace. "I do remember how to break the curse. Patience was supposed to bring back the memory of the trigger and I was supposed to go to Rowena to break it. Rather roundabout way to get there, but here we are." Castiel lifts his head and looks over at Rowena. "
She's short and thin but for the huge protruding belly, and her hair is a long pale brown, her eyes an icy blue. She smells like power, but it's not hers - it's coming from the growing being inside of her and is encircling her like a blanket. She accepts Dean's help onto the couch, turning towards him as he sits too. She smells like apprehension and anxiety, but she still smiles at him, bright like the sun. Dean wonders how Lucifer ever got anywhere near someone like her, but he keeps that to himself.
Dean carefully lowers himself back onto the hood, making sure he's still on the towel, and braces himself on an elbow before reaching over to take Benny's dick himself. The angle of Castiel thrusts feel more intense, laying like he is, the tip of his cock nudging up against Dean's prostate, leaving him very little brain power for Benny's cock. He uses his thumb to put pressure on the slit at the head of Benny's cock, circling his thumb over it, almost unconsciously. It gets wetter and wetter, Benny's precome dripping from his fingers, and Dean pulls his hand away long enough to lick the taste of Benny from his skin, making sure his hand is slick. He forms a circle around Benny's cock with his fist and encourages Benny to fuck into it by squeezing his fingers around it. Benny gets the idea, pulling his hips back and thrusting in again, bracing himself on the hood, over the towel next to Dean to give himself leverage. Dean watches as Benny's hand slides across Dean's ass, fingers petting at his hole and Castiel's cock, his pupils dilated.
It’s not alone either, it’s brought three of its friends, all in various stages of decomposition, rotting flesh and bulging eyes. The child is the freshest. Dean wonders if the others… if the others are the reason it’s like it is.
When he looks over at Jody, he can tell this is a sensitive topic for the women, and that they've probably argued about it often. So he veers away from it, turning to Castiel to ask, "So, how do we summon the archangels?"
Castiel senses that Sam has been longing to tell him and Dean something, but every time he goes to open his mouth to do so, Eileen stops him. Castiel is starting to find it increasingly frustrating. He's tried to pry the secret from Dean, but he's held his tongue tighter than Eileen has. Castiel doesn't like not knowing something the people around him do, though he does feel incrementally better when he calls Rowena and Jack to ask if they know, only to find them just as clueless as he is.
She makes a confused faces, a frown etched into her forehead, and says, "Since fucking when?" She punches Dean again and turns to Benny to say, "You gotten wise yet?"
This time, when he'd texted Benny about being late he hadn't worried about the consequences and told the other man to meet him in the office when he got there. Benny had agreed easily, not that Dean had expected anything less.
He and Benny make up their Chillo's date on the following Friday. They know just about everything about the other now, that instead of doing a normal get-to-know-you first date they spend the entire night people watching, and coming up with increasingly ridiculous stories about each person. As they're paying, Dean leans down to whisper in Benny's ear about the couple at the table closest to them. One of the two women, with bright red hair, is breathtakingly beautiful and also massively pregnant, and Dean tells Benny that Ariel got wise and dumped prince Eric's ass for Vanessa, which makes Benny burst into laughter.
Humans are extremely physical beings, more physical than Castiel is often comfortable with, but he gets the impression that Dean goes a bit t overboard when he engages in physical contact with him. He hasn't observed any of the other humans he encounters on a semi-regular basis be quite so forward - he's sure it's just Dean.
Dean takes it as acceptance when Castiel gives him a bright smile.  He rips open the packet of chocolate and snaps off the first line, putting a piece in his mouth. Dean tries to ignore his body's reaction to Castiel's face and the noises he's making. Castiel glances up from his second piece and says, "Can I ask you something?"
before he leaves his phone on the table and takes the part and his tools to Castiel's Continental. The intake boot is a quick fix, and with nothing else to do, his body vibrating with energy, he checks the car's fluids.
"You're welcome, see you later, Cas." Dean waves goodbye and just catches the confused look on Castiel's face before he turns the corner and he disappears from sight.
There's nuance to the situation Dean doesn't understand. He doesn't think she would have told him something like that if there wasn't, so he just sighs, nods his head and turns to look at her. "Hold it until Castiel's done."
Benny steals Dean's phone from him before Dean can stop him, turning around so Dean can't reach across the desk and has to go around him. He's typing, and when Dean gets to him he can see Benny hit send.
Castiel grins at him and says, “Alright, now where were we?” before pulling the angel into another kiss.
"I helped you when it was the other way around, asshole," Dean replies when he gets enough breath back to speak, though the last word is almost unrecognizable when Castiel thrusts into him again. Dean slides his hands under Castiel's arms and around the angel's back, holding on as Castiel fucks into him, hard and fast, unrelenting. Dean barely recognizes the noises he's making; high pitched whines and deep groans.
"Hey, I lied to you before, about the touching thing. I know I said some people are just like that, and I mean they are but-"
Dean snorts, looking over at Castiel as the man’s head flings back and he laughs at something Rowena’s said. “I think it’s pretty obvious, don’t you?”
"There's a cage, in hell. God made it to imprison Lucifer after his uprising. There are two ways to banish him to the cage. The first is to collect the rings of the Four Horsemen," Dean goes to interrupt, to ask him if he really means the actual
well, but Castiel isn’t so sure anymore. The missing items don’t seem to link up with the normal MO of pixies - they tend to gravitate more towards stealing car keys, phones, wallets, gloves; inconveniences. While the loss of Castiel’s belongings are annoying, it’s not necessarily inconvenient.
Dean presses a startled laugh into Castiel’s shoulder to soften the sound so he’s not disturbing others around them. He hasn’t been allowed to do his duty as big brother (tease the ever-loving shit out Sam) and it’s been bubbling up inside of him. “Oh, I’m
. He watches Dean reaching into the fridge for enough bottles of beer for all of them. “I’ll figure it out, don’t worry.”
It looks like every other cemetery Dean's ever been to (though there haven't been a lot), short stubby grave-stones, tall statues, and huge, hulking vaults. Even in the bright moonlight, the place is dark, trees towering over everything, filling the area with dark shadows that look like skeletal arms reaching out for them. Other than a vague direction, they don't know exactly where Bobby Singer's grave stands, so their first ten minutes in the cemetery is spent scouring the area around the statue of a small girl with angel wings, covered in dark green moss. Sam finds it first - a plain black tombstone with Bobby's name, his birth year, and death date - calls Dean and Rowena over.
Castiel helps Dean make burgers, though he mostly sits at the kitchen island cutting ingredients while Dean stands at the stove. Castiel still isn't allowed to cook anything that involves the stove and oven after the time he started a
"Dean," Castiel interrupts, sensing a tangent coming on that he's unlikely to pull Dean from if he lets it go on too long. "I think I'm in love with you."
"What?" Dean hisses. The witch they have? Did they leave Jack alone somewhere when they summoned her? Dean's chest clenches.
Dean switches between laving the flat of his tongue over Castiel’s hole, and spearing the muscle inside Castiel’s body. His fingers are tight in Castiel’s flesh, no doubt leaving more bruises for Castiel to marvel at later, Dean knowing how much he likes them. Castiel’s entire body is shaking, and he’s pressing his face into the pillows to muffle the whines being torn from his mouth, though it’s not working very well.
to say the least. He looks for it for a few days, then resigns himself to its absence, happy to continue on with his life without it.
He notices Castiel staring at him through the rearview mirror and turns his mouth up in a small smile. Castiel smiles back.
Dean loves babies, don't get him wrong, but he's also pretty sure he'll never have any of his own. His sleep schedule is shitty on it's own and he remembers how awful he felt when he had Deanna over when she was little and he could never get her to stop crying. It absolutely broke his heart. Mary's a far calmer baby than Deanna ever was, even at ten weeks old, but she got knocked over by early tooth growth and she's been crying every time he's seen her over the last week.
They share the appetizers until most of it is gone, and their first waitress is back with the mains. They end up sharing those too, mostly cause Benny really wanted to try the lamb, and Castiel wanted the pork belly. Dean was happy to let them take what they wanted from his plate, sneaking pieces from theirs, smiling brightly when they turn to look at him.
"Can I come in?" He asks, signing while he says the words. Eileen looks back into the room then shrugs, stepping to the side so Castiel can pass her. Sam's sitting on the edge of the bed in a pair of pyjama pants and a shirt Castiel is pretty sure was one of Dean's, and his hair is also wet. The look he shoots at Castiel is one of understanding - like he knows exactly why he's here and is just waiting for Castiel to admit it. "Uh… do I… am I attracted to Dean?"
Dean wakes when Jack does, hungry again, and Castiel's already there with a bottle held out towards him. Dean takes it but leaves it on the bedside table when he smells the surprise Jack has left him in his diaper. Dean barely managed to put the first one on right (and he had to replace it with a new one when he pulled the tab too hard and tore it off) and only with Jody's help, so he sends Castiel off to get her to help him again, setting Jack up on the bed with the baby wipes and a diaper while he waits. After a moment, he also gets some clothing from the box he'd brought in from Kelly's room, a coverall with giraffes on it that Dean refuses to admit to finding kinda cute.
Dean lets out a stuttered laugh, punching Benny's shoulder gently. "For you or Cas?" Benny's face says something like
Castiel doesn't understand what Dean means, but he doesn't bother inquiring, instead, tuning back into Sam and Eileen's friendly argument regarding a relatively recent pop culture reference that Castiel doesn't understand. Yas-key-er is an unusual name; he may have to use the internet to research it later.
He drops the hare in the snow and searches for the raven, jerking his head in the direction of the cave when he catches its eyes. He hopes Castiel gets the message, but doesn't watch him for long enough to find out.
Benny, the bastard, sends Dean a picture of his crotch, hard dick tenting his jeans. There's just a sliver of his belly in the picture, the curl of hair on his belly that trails down into his jeans and circles his cock, and Dean's gut grows warm.
Castiel and Gabriel transport them to Luxembourg, into a large sitting room where Jody, Donna, Alex, Claire, Patience, Kaia, and Crowley are waiting. It's a tearful reunion between Bobby and the women, and despite how much Bobby tries to pretend he's not relieved to see them all, he lets them each give him a tight hug and tries to hide the shine in his eyes.
"Gods, I'll get her, keep your pants on." He doesn't make it even two steps before Rowena is flying down the steps, pulling a dressing gown tight around her shoulders, Sam on her heels.
"He can go fuck himself," Dean mutters, staring down at the small child in his arms, tilting the bottle down towards the baby's tongue like Tasha had shown him when he was younger. The sucking of Jack's mouth has started to slow as he gets sleepy, and Dean lets him drink a bit more before taking the bottle away and settling it onto the bedside table, lifting the newborn up so he's lying against Dean's shoulder, patting his back. "I wasn't going to let him take Jack, and he looked like he was seconds away from tearing him from my arms. I will eat him if he tries, believe me."
"Don't look so smug," Castiel tells him, straddling Dean's hips and reaching back to take Dean's cock in his hand. He screws up his face in concentration as he slides down onto Dean and groans deep in his throat.
"Where're you going?" Castiel whispers, turning onto his back to look up at Dean as he finds the towel he used for his shower that morning, hung up on the back of the door. His eyes are half-lidded and he's still panting.
Castiel's cheeks flush darker and he slides out from under Dean, leaning over the bed to open the bottom drawer of the bedside table and coming back with a bottle of lube. "I found it in the bathroom, but I don't even want to think about that right now."
Castiel nods too, then continues, “I know you’re the one that took my belongings. I found them in your closet, Eileen explained it to me.” Dean takes a harsh deep breath in and Castiel waits to see if he’ll speak, before continuing when he doesn’t. “I took your jacket, the brown leather one? Hadn’t even realised I’d done it before it had appeared in my bed, under my pillow.”
Jo looks like she might cry, and she shoves Dean out of the way so she can lean over the table and pull Castiel into a hug. "
Dean shakes his head. “Uh-uh. Drive us home and I’ll just transport myself to the bathroom. Besides, I don’t think I can get into the truck with my wings.”
Deanna laughs and nods her head. "Uncle Dean always says that 'dad named me Deanna because he's a little shit-"
Castiel looks thoughtful. "I decided it would be best not to perform sexual intercourse with the Dean in this world. As I am not his Castiel, it would not have been appropriate. However, to not raise Dean's - the other Dean's - suspicions, I allowed some manner of intimacy." Something about the way he says it tells Dean he doesn't just mean they made out. Dean didn't realise Castiel even knew how to do... that.
"Holy fuck," Dean says, turning the phone around so Benny can read it. "Am I reading too much into this or did he just imply he wants to hit home base with me on Saturday?"
“I don’t know, it’s not in the file. After we’ve spoken to the police we should attend the morgue,” Castiel replies, closing the file and setting it on his lap. “It’s unlikely a shapeshifter would remove the skin and flesh of their victims.”
Outside the house a howl erupts through the night, something deep and lingering. Dean would have almost thought it was a werewolf, or even a normal wolf, if it weren’t for the magic that crackled through the air and the strong stench of
"Everything alright?" Dean asks, turning around and resting his arm over the back of the seat to look at Benny.
Jody and Donna share a look before they turn to Patience, who's frowning. "We never knew his name. But we knew that he took their memories to protect them."
A small voice in the back of his mind reminds him that there are seven other people sleeping upstairs, but he ignores it in favour of kissing Castiel one last time and climbing down his body, easing under the covers and settling between his legs. Even with his enhanced eyesight, it's hard to see what he's doing, fingers fumbling at Castiel's waistband in his hurry to tug his pants down. It's been so long since he touched someone like this that he practically vibrates with the urgent need to do so, to get his hands and his mouth on Castiel's body.
Castiel turns very suddenly to the archangel with wide eyes, shaking his head vigorously. "No," he hisses. "We can't wake them."
They end up fucking in the back seat, with Dean in Benny's lap, his back against Benny's chest, head twisted uncomfortably so he can kiss him.
"I can be nervous and still want to have sex with you, Cas," Dean says, leaning down to kiss Castiel. "I figure the basics are the same. I just don't wanna fuck up."
Dean pulls the Impala off to the side of the road and he and Castiel climb out, heading over to the bush. It’s perfectly maintained… everywhere but a small corner that’s been trampled. It could be a coincidence, just a trampled bush with absolutely no bearing on their investigation, but it’s the only lead they have.
It’s been weeks since Castiel last saw Dean, last touched him, and he wants to savour it, in case he has to wait longer next time. He kisses Dean like he’s starving, until his mouth is wet and swollen and his whole body feels like a live wire, buzzing with it. Dean is deliciously impatient, groaning into Castiel’s mouth, squirming in his arms and trying to get Castiel out of his shirt. Castiel takes pity on him and sits them up, pulling his jacket off of his shoulders and his shirt over his head. The sudden nakedness kicks Dean into gear, and the angel begins to manhandle Castiel until he’s where he wants him, before his mouth latches onto Castiel’s neck. He sucks a harsh mark into Castiel’s skin with his lips and teeth that leaves Castiel moaning, body quivering. Once he’s satisfied with the mark he’s made, he scrapes his teeth along the line of Castiel’s throat and bites down just below Castiel’s ear. It pulls a high whimper from Castiel’s throat.
. He sent me the wrong damned way!" Castiel climbs to his feet, face lit up with fury, but stops suddenly, face going green at the edges. He falls back into the seat and holds his head. "Ow, that hurt."
"I'm fine, still reeling a bit from last night," she tells them, her words a little slurred, raising her glass in something like a salute, liquid sloshing over the side and over her fingers. "Lotta strange things in your head, Cas."
Dean falls to a sit on the ground, taking Castiel with him, and turns around so his back is now against the tree. He gets his hand around Castiel's cheek and kisses him gently. "We're going to be like this for a bit."
“Deanie has banabas?” Jack asks, very seriously, putting his spoon in the bowl. “Deanie! Can I have banabas?”
It drops when his hold on its neck tightens, crushing bones between his jaws and breaking its neck. When he's sure it's over, a rustle of wings lets him know his new companion has joined him.
Benny sighs, longsuffering, and takes the tray of clean glasses from the kitchen window, handing it to Dean to stack. "He said he was here for a funeral, and that's it. He also didn't seem too sad about the funeral, so he probably didn't care too much about who it was for."
She eyes him, and Dean wonders if she's thinking about when he asked if Benny could come, and the implications she and Sam made. "How many people is that now?"
“It’s okay Dean, I know you have important things to do in heaven.” Dean has his hand rested over Castiel’s heart, his chin braced on top. He’s studying Castiel like he does sometimes, when he’s trying to figure Castiel out, as if he is some intricate puzzle. As if he doesn’t already know everything about Castiel. “How’s everything going upstairs? You obviously had time to come down and visit me so it must be going well.”
"Oh." Castiel drops back onto his bed and sighs heavily. "There is nothing we can do to expedite the process?"
Castiel transports them to Macedonia, for the Cyprus cones, the butterfly and the teeth, while explaining to Dean that he might have to sniff out the corpses before they dig them up.
Dean and Castiel surge towards each other at the same time, meeting in the middle with an unpleasant, painful clack of teeth. Laughter bubbles up from Dean's chest when Castiel pulls away to apologise.
. The raven doesn't run, he swoops at the humans until they finally back off, running back into the forest. The raven pecks at Dean's scruff and he stands on shaking legs, padding over to his hare. Each step sends shooting pain through his body, but he pushes through it, picking his prey up in his jaws. He limps back to the cave, the raven on his heels.
Dean laughs again and pats his thigh in a way he always does when Castiel doesn't understand something; it makes him feel naive, but strangely, he never hates it. "It's okay, Cas, I can't always tell when someone's being sarcastic either." Castiel isn't sure he believes that - Dean always seems to understand the subtle nuances of social etiquette - but he doesn't argue. He's figuring out how to begin the conversation with Dean that he's been meaning to have for days now when Dean speaks again. "Hey, do you want to go on a hunt, just you and me? If I have to deal with Sam and Eileen's baby bubble one more day I might just become a demon again," Dean says with a grin. Then, when Castiel has stared at him with a strange mixture of confusion and horror for long enough and is just about to say something, Dean bursts into laughter. "That was another joke, Cas."
When Dean looks back at Castiel his eyes are wide with wonder. Dean's not sure if it's the birth or the power that rolls through the room like the lick of flames that has brought on that look of wonder on his face.
"I disagree, we are absolutely making out," Castiel replies, the hand that's not in Dean's shirt reaching up to thread through his hair, pulling him back so he can kiss him again. Castiel's teeth graze over the flesh of Dean's bottom lip, and Dean groans, hand sliding up to grasp at the top of the headboard tightly. Castiel's hard already, Dean can feel it against his thigh, and in any other normal situation they would both be naked already and Castiel would already have three fingers inside Dean, but-
Dean thrusts start slow, grinding his hips in, and that’s fine for a while, really, except Castiel can be just about about as impatient as Dean can, especially when it comes to his orgasm. Without the use of his hands, he has to get clever. He tries clenching his body around Dean’s cock - not that that ever works - then tries to thrust his hips back, but Dean only presses his free hand down into Castiel’s back so he can’t move anymore.
Jack bursts into laughter, and thank God for both Dean and Castiel's sakes, he seems to take Dean's answer, chatting about how much he likes the bolognese. His rushed one-sided conversation about the food turns into an explanation as to why he can't eat meat - apparently he got bitten by a tick when he was younger which gave him a meat allergy. It seems extremely ridiculous, so he has to look to Castiel for confirmation, which he gets. He makes a mental note to ask Castiel more later.
"Okay, so the plan," Sam says, interrupting Dean's train of thought. He turns to look at his brother and continues, "When?"
“Do I need to wake Gabriel? ‘Cause I need to sleep, and I’m supposed to be meeting up with Kaia for lunch. I can’t babysit you all night to make sure you don’t die,” she tells him, pulling off her coat and hanging it on the wall hook, between Gabriel’s leather jacket and Jack’s little pea coat. She turns to him with her arms crossed over her chest and her eyebrow raised, ever the belligerent twenty-two year old.
Castiel goes easily when Dean pulls him in, letting himself be led, his head moving into the right position so when their lips meet again there's no teeth and no pain. His lips are soft and gentle, carefully easing Castiel into something more with his tongue, sliding a hand around the back of Castiel's neck to hold him there (not that Castiel would ever go anywhere). Castiel holds onto Dean by his sides, fitting his hands around the curves of his hips, feeling the way the muscles bunch and jump under his shirt.
Castiel puts a careful hand on Dean's shoulder to calm him and Dean feels his shoulders droop. He's still furious, and more than a little terrified, but having Castiel next to him, touching him, is helping. "I agree with Rowena."
"You're fine, Cas, come back here," Dean tells him, reaching around the back of Castiel's neck, threading his fingers through the short hairs at the base of his skull.
"Do you know what this is?" She looks at the gun, then at Dean and nods her head, the tiniest spark of fear behind her eyes. "Lucifer is trapped in hell, so tell me, where is the baby?"
Dean reaches into his pocket for the money and hands Castiel a ten-dollar bill. At Castiel's confusion, he says, "I'm not a self-stretching, self-lubricating angel, so go get some lube, you dork."
Castiel sits himself in a high-backed chair in front of her, eyeing Patience nervously as Dean steps up behind him and puts a hand over his shoulder. It's for comfort, for both of them, but also so he can pull Castiel away once she's done and before she brings the potion back up.
Dean's heart suddenly aches with the memory of running with Castiel as the raven, wishing that he could still shift. Wishing he was still human, still
Almost as if Rowena can understand Castiel, she says, "Yes, just let me nap first, I'm going to need a lot of energy."
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Castiel says, throwing his hands up into the air, the two ends of the untied rope still held in his fists.
. Finally, when he has ten he ties the pouch carefully and whispers, low so Castiel won't hear him, "I'm sorry."
Claire has strapped more weapons on herself then anyone, almost as many as all of them put together, and Dean's again reminded of her history. Dean notices Jody's nervous look aimed in her direction, and reaches over to squeeze her shoulder comfortingly.
. Dean steps out of them and kicks them away, laying his body flat out against the hood of the car and grinding his ass back into the rough material of Castiel's jeans.
Dean doesn't get a chance to take it, because just as he's reaching for Lucifer, a loud shot echoes through the hallway and pain spears through his thigh. Lucifer and Castiel disappear in another flash of light, and Dean is left alone in the hallway while Bevell stands at the other end, holding a gun in the hand that isn't injured.
Inside, both Dean and Castiel collapse on the bed, side-by-side while Benny opens up Dean's bedside table. When he climbs on the bed, now devoid of all his clothing, he's holding the lube and a condom. Dean and Castiel watch as he puts the condom on, then covers it in lube, before smearing more lube on his fingers. Dean opens his legs when Benny crawls closer, flinging one of them over Castiel's body, with his knee bent. Castiel grasps it in his hands, holding him open, and Dean leans over to kiss him. As they kiss, Benny's fingers slide back inside Dean, slicking him up before he pulls them out again and replaces them with his dick.
Dean laughs as he steps up to the sink, removing and disposing of the condom before finding a washcloth and wetting it. "Oh, you're whiney after sex." Castiel shoots a mean look at him, watching as he cleans his dick with the cloth, then re-wets it and returns to the bed. "Just gonna make sure we don't stick together overnight, then we'll cuddle or something." Castiel makes another face but lets him wipe the come on his belly and chest off with the washcloth, and then wipe the thing over his hole without complaint. Dean doesn't even leave the bed after he's cleaned Castiel's skin, just throws the rag in the general direction of the sink, watches it fall with a splat onto the floor a foot away and shrugs his shoulders. He leans down and presses a kiss to Castiel's mouth, molding himself along Castiel's side and kicking his legs until he gets one hooked on the quilt and pulls it up over them.
“So, am I focusing on fingering you, or getting it done quickly?” Dean asks while he’s sitting back on his haunches, rearranging Castiel’s legs so they’re spread open.
“Do you miss eating?” Dean asks Castiel, playing with the knife and fork in front of him, his chin braced on his upturned hand. He's trying not to yawn, but not very hard, and it eventually rolls out of his mouth.
He pulls the remote from Castiel’s hand, grinning, panting for breath, and says, “And that is why you don’t miss sparring sessions.”
. Patience had to bring your memories of the trigger back before you could remember the phrase that would call Juliet to you. He must have made it so that Juliet brought it to you when you uttered the phrase you could only remember once Patience had brought your memories of the trigger back. Of course my son had to make things incredibly hard for everyone."
The demon's smile is sharp and almost horrifying, like Dean is looking past a veil at the creature that lies beneath the human skin. "Maybe
Dean gets into bed first, just in his briefs, and then Castiel, completely naked after dropping his underwear at the side of the bed.
"Fuck hell, Bobby, you scared the shit out of me!" Dean squeaks, rolling out from underneath the car, sitting up. He can feel the grease on his forehead as he rubs the sharp sting of the impact away, and he tries to rub it off with the rag he left next to his tools. "What?"
," Castiel whispers, reaching down to thread his fingers in Dean's hair again, pulling until Dean's scalp aches and he goes, letting Castiel pull him up his body. They kiss again, Castiel leading this time, and Dean moans into it.
is replacing the country. Castiel is sitting at the bar, wide eyes on Dean, and his drink is almost empty, so Dean makes a beeline for him, giving him a smile before he says, "Hey, Cas, need another?"
“Ow!” Dean shouts in surprise, head swinging around so he can stare, wide-eyes at Castiel. “Really? Teeth?”
"I reckon we could get a motel for the night, or at least a few hours, if you wanted to," Castiel says, and Dean almost chokes on a mouthful of fries in his rush to say yes. Castiel's grin widens and he nods.
Castiel nods slowly, approaching Dean and the baby slowly, leaning over to peek at the child in the crook of Dean's arms. He's still crying and Dean rocks him carefully like he did when he was eleven and Max and Alicia were babies. God, it's been
"Could be a few things, I'd have to pop her open and take a look. Noticed anything else?" Dean says, pulling the hood up and propping it open. When Castiel doesn't reply Dean looks over at him. He looks confused, not sure what to say, so Dean starts listing off as many other symptoms as he can think of.
"Bobby Singer can give us insights into hunting angels, archangels, and demons that we won't be able to discover on our own. He is our best chance at finding Jack."
Still, nothing happens, so Dean nods at Castiel again, and Castiel strolls straight towards the desk on one side of the room, reaching out for the drawer.
Benny makes another face, then sighs deeply, rolling his eyes. A small smile is tugging at the corner of his mouth and it makes Dean's chest tight. "Okay. You gonna put out, cher?"
"Smells like death in there," Bobby Singer says once he stops hacking. He looks up at the people around him, frowning. "Anyone gonna help me outta here?" Sam takes the man's hand and helps him out of his coffin, setting him onto his feet in the grass. "So, which one of you idjits decided to interrupt my eternal rest?"
"Awesome, because I don't think I can keep having this conversation with my boyfriend's teenage daughter."
"Dean," Castiel moans, wrapping his legs around Dean's hips, tight, heels digging into Dean's back. "
Dean’s been fingering himself longer than Castiel has - so even with the pretty distraction that Castiel makes split on his fingers - he still finishes before Castiel. He wipes the lube on his fingers off as best he can with a tissue from the box on the bedside table and just sits back and watches Castiel as much as he likes.
Dean rubs at his eyes with his fists. "I figured John couldn't have done anything worse than your mom did, especially if he was pissed, so I told him I was bisexual. He tried to beat me but he was so drunk he was out with one punch. I would never out someone like that, cause the thought of being outed to my dad before I could choose the situation was terrifying." Dean's hand slides to the back of his neck and he rubs it nervously. "I am sorry about being a dick though, I was going through some shit and I took it out on you, and others, and it wasn't fair."
He’s hard, and the throbbing heat of Dean’s own dick is pressed into the crook between Castiel’s groin and thigh indicating that he’s feeling exactly the same. Castiel pulls him back into a kiss and gets a hand around Dean’s ass to tug their bodies closer. He tries to get Dean to thrust against him, digging his fingers into the angel’s skin to urge him on, but the bastard’s not having a bar of it, and he pulls away with a chuckle.
After more silence, he uses the hand holding Benny's to point up to the sky, towards Cygnus. "I tried to make a joke about the Cross, but it looked too much like a bird to bother."
Castiel hums thoughtfully, still riding his fingers, then takes fingers out of his body just long enough to straddle Dean’s hips. He slides his fingers back inside himself and says, “Thighs and hips only.”
"Okay…" Benny replies slowly, chewing on his bottom lip, squeezing Dean's knee again. "Well, I'm gonna make how I feel clear then, so this doesn't become part of your dating history shit show: I love you Dean, a dumb amount, and I would do just about anything for you. This? Castiel? Isn't something you need to worry about, and if you want to try a - what did you call it? Triad? - then I'm with you. It's not like Castiel is ugly, and he gave me his number the other night, when we were at yours, we've been talking. He's interesting, and he's intelligent and he's funny - I can see where your feelings came from."
Despite wanting more, they take it slow, kissing languidly in a way that makes Dean melty and sort of sleepy like he's swimming through honey. They kiss for ages until Dean thinks he might fall asleep, then he kisses Castiel one last time before he falls back into the bedding.
sort of gesture, mouth twisted into a grimace. "I mean, she probably could, but the timing would be difficult without being able to see Lucifer," he turns to Rowena with almost-gentle eyes and says, "It's up to you."
Castiel wiggles until he's comfortable then nods at Dean, winding his arms around Dean's neck and pulling him in for a kiss. It doesn't last long before Dean's pulling away, deciding he needs to concentrate while he slides his cock into Castiel, and his mouth is not conducive to Dean's concentration or control.
Castiel slides his way up and down Dean’s cock slowly, fitting it further inside his body on every downward stroke until he’s sitting on Dean’s hips. His cheeks and chest are bright red and he’s panting, sweat forming at his temples.
Benny shrugs his shoulders, which is as good as an agreement for him, so Dean looks down at his phone again to text Cas.
"How the hell are we going to find Jack, where do we even start?" Sam asks, voice drowsy. Dean's starting to get his enhanced senses back, and his brother smells almost unbearable, like rotting leaves in the rainy season and wet earth. They're smells that have always comforted him, the smell of the forest, and recently the smell of his brother, but now the smell makes him feel like he might gag. Underneath that putrid smell, Dean can distinguish his emotions, but only just: fear, anger, worry.
Castiel pulls Dean's shirt over his head and hooks his fingers in the waistband of Dean's sweatpants, looking for permission to remove them. Dean nods and helps Castiel do so, lifting his hips and then his legs before Castiel throws it onto the floor and out of the way. He's not wearing briefs, and when Castiel looks down, his cock is there, out for him to see, and the heat in Castiel's belly grows, causing his knees to weaken and his mouth to go dry.  Castiel wants to reach out and touch him, wants to find out what Dean tastes like, how he feels on his tongue, but he doesn't know how to ask, wouldn't know how to go about it even if Dean said yes. Instead, he kisses the man again, pressing up against his body.
They continue on east to the town, the raven flying high above as Dean runs, enjoying the way the snow crunches under his paws. When Dean reaches the outskirts, away from prying eyes, he drops his bag and shifts into his human form, dressing quickly. Castiel has landed on a nearby branch and watches him, squawking gently as if he's trying to tell Dean something. "I won't be long, stay here and I'll come find you." The raven looks almost angry, but he doesn’t squawk at Dean again, staying put as Dean trudges onto the road.
Dean lets out a sharp breath through his nose and shakes his head. "No, the only werewolf." Castiel's face grows sad, and he moves to say something, but Dean interrupts him, not ready for the pity. "There's a faction of humans who kill people like us because they believe we're a danger to humanity. When I was a pup, we knew of three other packs in North America. By the time I was eleven, we were the last. They killed my mother and my brother when I was four, then my father, my stepmother and my half-brother when I was twelve. Along with the rest of my pack."
Castiel looks at Crowley, and then behind him at the door where Lucifer and Michael are waiting. "We might have to carry the chair out and get one of them to break the restraints." Dean nods and they each take a side of the chair, carrying it and its occupant out into the hallway before setting it in front of the archangels. "Do your magic."
The demons are all dealt with and the others are dealing with injuries. Dean drops Crowley and shifts back so he can put his clothes on.
“I am, I was thinking about when a scary powerful Angel of the Lord let me choke him just so he would know how not to kill me.”
"Shit," Dean rushes over to help him, kneeling down to stuff the clothes back into the box while Castiel stares at him in utter confusion. "Sorry about that, man. I didn't mean to startle you."
Castiel sits on the bed and rolls his eyes, "I was getting a dressing down for falling. Lucifer was defending me, but then he was telling me off for loving humanity so much that I fell to earth, rather than coming to him." He leans down and pulls off his shoes and socks, then unbuttons his jeans. He doesn't take them off, yet, instead he says, "Same shit, different day."
Castiel blinks a few times, confused and staring owlishly at the archangel. Dean has no idea what they're talking about, and he really wants to ask, but before he can, understanding has washed over Castiel's features, and his wide eyes go even wider. "That's far more dangerous, Gabriel."
(Dean wins most of the Poker and Blackjack games, and Jody wins most of the others. He's still not entirely sure how).
Dean chokes on his spit and heat burns through his body. He thinks Benny might have been worried that he got there first despite Dean being first in, and that Dean might be mad, but he isn't, in fact he replies with,
Sam’s eyes go wide and he climbs to his feet, says, “you found them in his closet? Did it seem like there was enough space for him to climb inside?”
There are far more demons than they were expecting, at least two dozen, and while a lot of them are already dead, or at least unconscious or exorcised, there's still more left over than there are of Dean and Castiel's group. Dean rushes to Bobby's side, where he lays in the fray, holding his side as blood spills between his fingers.
"It's awesome." Dean nods his head, eating the last of the food on his plate. "Do you see the world? Besides when you're digging in it?"
The man's face goes purple, and Dean's almost about to worry after his health, at least, until he narrowly misses the fist to his face. He elbows the man in the face so hard he hears a crunch, then takes his arm and twists it around his back, holding it until he knows, if he only puts a little pressure on it, he could fracture his ulna, or dislocate his shoulder. "You motherfucker."
Castiel’s hand slides away from Dean’s neck and Dean cries out in distress, a noise which is cut off when the vibrator is turned up one setting. “Patience, I’m getting there, baby,” Castiel says as Dean’s body shudders, his hand going back to Dean’s neck.
Dean still doesn't understand. Nothing is sure, no fate is set in stone. They have two powerful archangels and a powerful witch with them, how could they not find a way to save her? She didn't deserve to lose her life because the devil knocked her up. It wasn't her fault, and she shouldn't have to bear the weight of it.
Castiel brushes a hand over his face and sighs heavily. "I gotta go call my dad, is it alright if I leave it here, or do you need me to get it into the garage?"
By the time he's gone back to his text history with Castiel, Castiel has replied: first with a string of emojis - the ones with the crossed out eyes, mouth in an o shape, the one that's smirking, the one with a squiggly line for a mouth and the one that's blushing - and then with,
That thought makes it a hundred times worse and Dean has to turn back to the stove to cover the extremely embarrassed flush on his cheeks. "Uh… It's just… like a normal relationship? But with three of us?" He tries to think about how he would explain it to a normal eighteen year old, one that isn't the daughter of someone he's dating. "How much do you know about polyamory and polycules."
Castiel's staring down at their hands as Dean leans back against the door, and after a silence that seems to stretch on for hours, but couldn't be more than a few minutes, Castiel says, "Dean?"
Castiel makes a noise like he's pained, and Dean looks over at him. His cheeks are ruddy and his eyes are glassy, and his hand is wrapped around the shape of his cock in his jeans.
Castiel's cheeks flush so red that it just makes him more adorable, and when Dean expresses his endearment, Castiel hides his face behind a menu and tells him to fuck off. When Dean looks over at Benny he has the bottle in his hand and he's blushing too. Dean realises just how easy it's going to be to get the other two to like each other.
Dean shifts again and stalks towards the groaning figure. "I was going to let you go free, but now I'm going to tear your heart out of your chest." He lifts Crowley to his feet and punches the witch over the face over and over until he feels less like biting his face off. He wants nothing more than to feel Crowley's bones crunching under his teeth, but he's still Rowena's son, and even if she had sort of given him permission to kill him, he knows she'll be devastated, and he doesn't want that. Instead, he shifts again and takes Crowley's broken arm in his jaw (making sure to clamp down hard until he knows it'll hurt), dragging him out to the others.
"Is she dead?" Castiel asks once Dean shifts back into his human form, spitting the blood from his mouth, looking at the splatter of it on the floor with a disgusted sneer.
couldn't miss. He braces his foot on the couch as Jody straps a holster to his thigh, before walking around the room a few times to get used to the extra weight.
That one makes Castiel laugh too, and Dean feels pride well up in his chest. He reaches over and takes Castiel's hand in his own, threading their fingers together and  bringing it up to his lips to kiss his knuckles. He does the same with Benny's, and then he holds them in his lap.
The golden light in Kelly's eyes fades with the thump of her heartbeat until it's barely discernible. She's still awake, but only just, staring down at her son. Dean feels tears prick at his eyes as her breathing and her heartbeat slow to a stop. Her arm falls away from the baby and Dean picks him up just as the wave of power charges through the room again and light shines from Kelly's still body.
Christ, Benny," Dean groans, his cock throbbing against his belly. He uses the hand around Benny's neck to shove the other man's face further into his throat, pulling at the short hairs on his head as much as he can until Benny groans. The vibrations of it send a wave of heat through his body and he clenches around Benny, which only makes him groan again, and endless cycle of bite and touch and groan and fuck. "Oh fuck."
"Jack, take a breath," Castiel tells the teenager with a chuckle, catching Dean's eyes and rolling his own. The urge to kiss him does not go away, at all.
"Normally I'd say you could probably go home and I'd let you know when the car's ready, but I don't think Bobby will let you take the loaner outside the state. It's up to you what you want to do, man."
"Normal intake boots cost sixty, but you're probably looking at three hundred, maybe four. And you can't drive it while it's like this, if the vacuum system is leaking the exhaust or breaking might stop working, your car could stop on the road, cause an accident." Dean warns. Castiel nods solemnly and Dean takes pity on him. "I have a loaner you can borrow for now, but I think you'll be staying in town longer than you planned. Sorry 'bout that Cas."
"Cas," Dean says, rolling his eyes as he pulls into a gas station. "You pump, I'll keep an eye out."
He doesn’t know how long he waits. It feels like hours, but is probably only mere minutes, before finally, Castiel’s in front of him again, Gabriel, Sam, and Rowena by his side. Besides Castiel, Gabriel is the only one who looks like he hasn’t been affected. Sam and Rowena sit on either side of Dean.
Dean snorts. “Fucker. The innocent, doe-eyed look doesn’t work on me anymore. It stopped working on me the first time you tied me up and ate me out.”
Castiel's whole body is tingling, and Dean hasn't even gotten inside of him yet. He nods his head, then says, "Yeah," sliding his arm around the back of Dean's neck and pulling him down for a kiss. It's sloppier than it was before, wet with their mouths slanted against each other's and far more tongue, and it only serves to make the tingling worse. (Or maybe better is a more correct description.)
