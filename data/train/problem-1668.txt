The water makes small splashes that undoubtedly draw more attention to them. Sherlock doesn’t care. He is focused and dedicated in a way he hasn’t been in some time. The stranger’s gaze ignited something low in his gut on a direct line to his lips and his cock. It’s almost unheard of to find actual passion here.
“Maybe he’s not that bad, yeah? Maybe this was out of character?” Stamford’s cheery, “always look for the silver lining” voice barely registers against John’s dark mood.
Sherlock extends his hand for lack of any other way to say ‘hello’. “Sherlock Holmes, first violin.”
It’s deep, far more adult and masculine than John would have imagined. Has imagined, really. All those late, starry nights in Afghanistan had left him with all sorts of fantasies, but that deep, chest-vibrating voice hadn’t been accurately portrayed in a single one of them.
He loses a bit of time again but John kisses him fiercely. It’s passionate and Sherlock feels drunk on John’s lips but it’s a wind down, not a ramp up. Eventually they break apart, breathless and smiling. John hands him a discarded vest to wipe down with. Neither of them seem inclined to leave the bed for a more thorough cleaning.
“Why did you run?”
The rest of his
Lestrade waves his thanks and heads down the stairs. Sherlock is just about to pelt off after him when he realizes John hasn’t moved. He’s still standing near the windows, watching him.
“Maybe it just needed more time. Time to heal.” John’s voice is quiet. He drags his fingertips down to Sherlock’s knee, then back up again.
It’s not the impact that worried him.
Sherlock keeps himself as busy as he can. He doesn’t think about his soulmate on police cases or when he’s working with his slowly growing portfolio of private clients. It’s only when one of his black moods overtakes him that he thinks about the man who touched him, literally and figuratively, and then left him.
“There are worse things than not finding your soulmate, Sherlock. You can find them and only get some of your colours back. Just regain the muted shades of childhood instead of the vibrant spectrum adults are supposed to see. They used to say that’s what happened to cold and heartless children, to those that saw only shades of blue or green. That even a soulmate wasn’t enough for them to see all the colours the world has to offer.” Mycroft rises from the table, the scrape of his chair against the floor echoing in the large and nearly empty dining room. “Remember what colours you could see, Sherlock.”
“Yes, sir.” That bit of obvious, outward submission sent waves of pleasure to the pit of John’s stomach. It was in opposition to what he was about to do with the beautiful, glorious man and the dichotomy was extraordinary.
strumming in John’s blood as he watches the woman bat her eyelashes at him. It’s more repulsive than Sherlock’s dismissive manners but he can’t bring himself to care. They are finally in the same room together and everything feels
“Not what I would have expected for you, no.”
) flat. It’s something he can only feel, singing through his bloodstream with every heartbeat.
“Be careful, yeah?” John swallows and glances to Sherlock’s hip, not far from where the gun rests against his spine. “I hate not being there to watch your back.”
Instead, Victor crosses the kitchen to stand between Sherlock’s awkwardly parted knees. Before Sherlock can pull off one of his gloves (
Victor invites Sherlock to parties, laughs but doesn’t mock when Sherlock sputters on his first shot of tequila, has Sherlock over for quiet dinners at his apartment, and Sherlock has never been treated so well by a peer in his life. He’s not quite sure what’s going on, if Victor’s interest is romantic or not. He’s so happy to finally have a friend that Sherlock tells himself that the uptick in his pulse when Victor is near is irrelevant. And that the empty space he feels in his chest when he’s not with Victor is a figment of his imagination.
The cathedral was empty and it was easy to slide between a stone column and a statue of the Holy Mother. He pushed on a wooden door that blended in so finely with the stone walls, it would have been hard to spot if he didn’t know exactly what he was looking for. If he hadn’t done this dozens of times over the years.
John could hear Sherlock panting. Neither of them had touched their own cocks yet, and John was proud of Sherlock for that. He was obviously impatient and demanding but he knew the rules of their game. John was having too much fun bringing Sherlock to the edge to worry about his own cock.
“No. Not in a police car. I hate police cars.”
He waits a bit longer, until he can tell John is on the edge of sleep.
“I need to go.” His voice is breathless and raspy and Donovan looks like she’s going to interrupt him. “I need to go home.”
Lestrade grimaces at the old argument. “Well, he won’t be your assistant.”
The slap of skin against skin and their grunts of pleasure bounced around them. John wrapped a hand in Sherlock’s hair and pulled until Sherlock’s back bowed. That gave him the leverage he needed to fuck Sherlock deep and hard and angle his cock to hit that spot inside Sherlock every time.
John brought his mouth to Sherlock’s. The kiss was sloppy, full of tongue and teeth, and John’s cock grew to full hardness where it was pressed against Sherlock’s matching bulge.
John’s mouth was dry. Sherlock was close enough that he could reach out and grab him by the hips or crush their mouths together.
The thought of him, whoever he is, being dead makes a sob well up in Sherlock’s throat. He traps it there and pushes it down with a wave of sarcasm. “So, only time will tell?”
Sherlock had retreated to his room for the night more than an hour ago, but he can still hear them. John’s pacing and Rosie’s fussing won’t let him fall asleep. He could sleep, of course, the noise isn’t that great. But Rosie’s distress and John’s helplessness churn in his stomach.
Sherlock finds himself reluctant to give Rosie up so fast. Instead, he lowers himself to the sofa and reclines back so Rosie is lying against his chest with her knees hooked around his ribs. She doesn’t protest their change in position and her breathing is deeper, more even than when he first took her from John’s arms.
John rolls off and Sherlock huffs at the loss of that pleasant weight. Next thing he knows John is rolling him over, which is shockingly easy since it appears Sherlock was taking up the entire middle of the bed. He screws his eyes shut in protest and lets his arms swing wide.
The voice was as dark and deep as the shadows from which it came. The hair on the back of John’s neck stood on end and he wished the narrow hall had enough room for him to pull his sword.
It’s still lonely - not the kind of loneliness John was expecting either. He has friends, he likes his work (when he actually gets to do doctoring beyond yelling at 18 year old kids about sunscreen), and he doesn’t miss London. He just misses someone in London. Someone he’s never even spoken to.
Sherlock rewarded him with another scorching kiss that left his lips wet and bruised.
There is one thing he’s not pleased with.
By the morning, his right eye is able to see in full colour again but his left is still tinged with grey in the upper left quadrant. He can manage with that.
John canted his head to the side and met Sherlock’s eyes. He rocked his hips gently.
That was not enough to make John drop his hand away from his sword. “You’re a fortune teller? You should be down at the festival.”
Sherlock is quick to shimmy out of his boxer briefs, flailing a bit as he kicks them away. John similarly gets himself out of his own pants and Sherlock is briefly irritated that he didn’t get to peel them off John himself.
He closes his eyes and remembers what John looked like when he came, remembered feeling his hot, thick come splatter against his stomach. He knows he’s about to do the same to John and that’s enough to push him over the edge.
“What about the Feast of Fools do I have a weakness for? It represents many things to many people.” John spread his feet a bit apart, shifted his weight as if a fight were about to break out.
Sherlock leans in and John tilts up to meet him with no hesitation. Sherlock keeps his hands hanging limply at his sides and keeps his kiss chaste. Just a dry press of lips to lips. A promise, not an escalation.
Sherlock expects John to take a step back. That’s what most people do when faced with the burning lash of Sherlock’s tongue. Instead, John grips the handle of his cane until his knuckles turn white. A soldier indeed.
John’s response is immediate. It races out of him on a great exhale. “Oh, God, yes.” He grabs the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulls him down for scorching kiss. It’s all Sherlock can do to keep from laughing in unadulterated, perfect glee at this man. This man who lets him see colours, who is going to run to a crime scene with him, and who wants to kiss him.
“That’s not what I meant.”
“It’s not a matter of time spent with your soulmate. The strength of the bond is a reflection of the compatibility you share and the quality of the relationship.”
Sherlock rocks back to bring his ass in closer contact with John’s groin. The hardness of John’s cock against his bottom isn’t exactly a surprise. Sherlock has been feeling it grow against him through most of this encounter. When they first shifted into this position, John had been politely trying to angle himself away but as their kisses grew more heated that politeness faded away. John had let them touch but he didn’t push, or thrust, or grind. Sherlock is sure he wouldn’t have had the same self-control if their positions were reversed. He pushes back harder and John groans. He doesn’t have the same self-control anyway.
“The rumours are about me. It keeps most people from trespassing in my domain. An ugliness of the body is easier to use to frighten than an ugliness of the mind.”
But that warm, calloused hand is heavy against Sherlock’s hip. He’s not alone, not really. John is with him, giving him this, and it’s just one more leap Sherlock has to make for John. He’d make a thousand more if John needed it.
He never gives her an answer. In part because he doesn't know. He never took Mycroft up on his offer to track the man down. And in part because he doesn't care. Doesn’t care where his mysterious soulmate has gone and doesn’t care to respond to Sally at all.
The door he pushed against there did more than squeak. They shrieked and the wood groaned until he forced it open with his shoulder. John almost fell forward as the door gave way. He caught himself quickly.
“But it’s fine now? Everything healed as it should be?” John is anxious and Sherlock’s first reaction is, will always be, to soothe him. But to do so truthfully.
Mycroft pauses. It’s such a subtle pause that anyone except Sherlock would have missed it. “I didn’t know. I suspected.”
Winding his horse through the streets of Paris was always a trial, but during the Feast of Fools it was a nightmare. Strangers jostled him without a care. They stepped directly in front of his horse as if the war-seasoned beast wouldn’t run them down. The noise and crowds and the smell were overwhelming.
“All right, how did you observe that then?” There’s no mocking in the detective’s voice. He is genuinely curious.
“Minor drug offender!” Sherlock shouldn’t be offended by that, he really shouldn’t, but the detective is being both dismissive and amused at Sherlock’s expense. His pride prickles a bit.
They had agreed. If there was a chance of danger, more than just the normal danger of any given day as John and Mary Watson’s daughter, Rosie would not go on a case. Things like crime scenes were likely fine, as they were also likely crawling with police officers. And Scotland Yard itself had a spare travel cot for Rosie in Greg’s office.
“I haven’t seen you here before.” A smooth, soft hand expertly caught John’s in the darkness. “Come.”
“Good.” John’s nod was decisive and sharp. He led Sherlock to the bathroom, stripped them both, and herded Sherlock into the shower. John’s skin was wet and warm against his back. They didn’t speak.
Sherlock would skip them entirely if he didn’t think Lestrade would march the whole damn circus right into his sitting room.
“How did you know about Afghanistan?”
‘John’ smirks at him, leaned back and glistening with sweat and steam. “Do I? Not many people play the oboe so seems like an odd guess.”
John let his muscles relax, signalling his agreement with the rules.
Sherlock cants his hips up, bringing his now much-harder cock into contact with the heel of John’s hand. “I’d rather you touch me.”
John had his cock out of his breeches and was pushing into Sherlock’s hole before Sherlock could finish complaining.
“Small wonders.”
And he doesn’t. Not entirely. He sits up a bit, leans away enough that his head isn’t resting against Sherlock anymore, but not far enough away to be out of Sherlock’s space. Sherlock turns to look at him and they almost bump noses.
Suddenly, and as clearly as if he were in his mind palace, Sherlock saw the small space between them in Baker Street’s sitting room as a yawning pit. To walk forward, to embrace John, would mean falling in. But to not do so would mean losing him all the same. Facing the fall was terrifying.
Sherlock snatches a single page of the sheet music from where it teeters, perched on the edge of the coffee table. “This is insipid. It lacks any originality. A child could play this. A stupid child.”
If he thought he’d been the subject of Sherlock’s attention before, John was deathly wrong. Those incredibly blue eyes focus on him sharply and John can feel all his layers being peeled away. Sherlock takes a small step toward him and inhales deeply.
“No, you really don’t have to…” John takes a step forward and reaches out, but stops himself short of touching Sherlock’s hands where they hover above the mantle.
John smiles at him and leans against the sitting room doorway. He’s not angry. “No, she didn’t come up. Went straight to Mrs. Hudson’s for tea and then Greg is coming to pick her up for a sleepover with his kids.”
This question was easy. Sherlock has known the answer to this question since John shot the cabbie. But voicing that answer meant stepping over the precipice between them. It meant letting himself fall.
John laid one more kiss on Sherlock’s skin before stepping back and tucking himself back into his breeches. Sherlock straightened and did the same. January was a terrible month to have your cock out in the out of doors.
“Then lean on me, make me tell you something.”
“We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t know where we’re meeting. I don’t even know-” John cuts himself off before that lie. He does know his name. He’s known it for years, thought about it daily. It niggles at him constantly, like a scab beneath his clothes.
John sees it happen but it’s like watching someone else’s hand, or like a dream, or even a movie. His thumb brushes, caresses, against the skin along the man’s exposed collarbone.
“No.”
Mycroft sits gingerly, perching on the edge of a plastic chair by Sherlock’s bedside. “So, when did you become able to differentiate between burgundy and oxblood?”
But that’s good. That’s exactly what he wanted. A place so foreign, so different, that he wouldn’t be able to spend too much time thinking of eyes the same blue-grey colour as the dreary London sky, clouds and all. Sometimes he still does a double take when he sees a young civilian who has let his inky black curls grow out to be nearly the same disheveled length as Sherlock Holmes’s. That’s only before his mind can register the subtle, no more than two shades difference between the hair of the man he left unconscious in a bed back in London and anyone he might meet in the desert. He’s always left a little relieved and a little disappointed.
Maybe that isn’t the cold after all. Lestrade has clamped a hand on his shoulder and is shaking him. But his teeth chatter together so it must be a chill.
“If you get pig guts on me, I will kill you.”
They rutted and buttons popped and Sherlock’s neck felt rubbed raw by John’s stubble. They grappled for position, a competition Sherlock had no intention of or desire to win, but he liked making John fight for it. Sherlock was pushed down, down off the sofa, down until his knees smacked against the floor.
Sherlock listens to Lestrade stand stock still for a full minute, give another dramatic sigh, and then move across the flat.  “First section rehearsal is in two weeks!” he calls back as he trots down the stairs.
“It’s fine.”
He can’t. He can’t release that ledge and fall again. John is his one point of certainty, his constant star, and John has left him adrift again. Adrift this time on waves of pleasure instead of free falling from Barts's roof
It doesn’t last. It’s just a second or two before Sherlock steps back, faltering a bit on unsteady feet.
He’s just coming in for the 7 pm to 7 am shift at Bart’s A&E and the cheeky nurses he’d like to be flirting with are just leaving. John’s never had much luck at timing.
Minstrels and hawkers and pickpockets flowed around him and John felt like he was finally able to breathe. He left his horse stabled at a tavern on the edge of the worst of the celebration. He’d come back for the horse later. He wanted to walk the streets and feel Paris beneath his feet.
Sally Donovan has never liked him. Not from the first case Lestrade pulled him into. She was a uniform officer back then, but worked her way up quickly. He’d (correctly) deduced that she was madly in love with her soulmate, devoted to him and thought about him constantly. This, apparently, damaged her professional reputation. At least in her eyes, and that was reason enough to hate him.
They stare for a moment. Just a moment before Sherlock rocks back on his heels, ready to flee, to run to Lestrade. Or run away from John. Either is just as true.
By the time evening comes, Sherlock has to know. Not everything, but something. Just a hint of who this man is, enough to keep him going for a few years yet. It’s the beginning of a slippery slope that will end in him driving himself mad, and Sherlock knows it.
“You were military. Invalided home because of -” Sherlock knocks his head back against the scar on ‘John’s’ shoulder. “Tan line that stops at the wrist and neck but wounded so you were in combat which means Afghanistan or Iraq.”
Some nights, he thinks of their life together as a happy affair. John would still be at Bart’s, Sherlock would be back at uni or maybe starting a career in finance or some such bullshit. John knows nothing about him, doesn’t know what he does or what he wants to do. But it doesn’t matter. The fact that John can tell the difference between vermillion and blood red means that they could work it out. They were already perfect for each other.
Sherlock looks back to the petri dish in his hand and doesn’t acknowledge John. For a split second, John thinks he can escape, can walk back out of the lab and pretend this never happened. But instead, he’s walking forward. Closer to Sherlock. He manages not to stare, to glance around the room instead.
“How do you know all that?” John sounds less disapproving and more genuinely curious. It soothes some of Sherlock’s ruffled feathers but his emotions are still to riotous to be trusted. Maybe they can never be trusted around this man.
When the door swings open and John sees him sitting there, pipette in hand and this time in a smart suit instead of vomit crusted denims and a faded t-shirt, his heart stops. Sherlock is obviously older, his hair is longer, and he looks like he might be approaching a healthy weight but just barely. John’s legs carry him forward, practically flinching away from Mike’s knowing smirk. Sherlock glances at him but doesn’t seem to recognize him.
“Are you staying this time?” Sherlock’s voice is small even to his own ears.
John’s hand closes around him again and with no fabric to separate them, Sherlock can’t keep himself from moaning and rocking his hips. John slides his palm up to the tip of Sherlock’s cock, then across the head to smear the moisture gathering there around, before he closes his fist and slides back down again. Slides back down all the way to the root before letting go and cupping Sherlock’s balls. They are already high and tight against his body.
“Your assistant, huh?”
Instead of going home and going to bed, John walks directly to an Army recruitment office and signs up. They are very eager to get their hands on a fully trained doctor. He doesn’t go back to Barts. Not to say goodbye and not to see Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock practically runs out of Bart’s. He doesn’t slow until he rounds the corner at the end of the street. He didn’t even want to stop long enough to hail a cab.
“John.” Sherlock’s head whipped around. His hair was a flyaway mess from the wind and his cheeks a deep pink. His lips were bitten red and swollen. “If you don’t get your cock in me this instant-”
“He’s seizing!” John’s shout is unnecessary. The paramedics are already reaching for an anti-convulsive medication in a syringe as Stamford reaches out his gloved hands to pin one of the young man’s arms to the gurney.
John is quiet, but not asleep. He heard. Sherlock knows he heard by the tension in his shoulders and by how
Just a first name. And not a first name he can do anything with. It’s frustrating and it’s perfect. Sherlock rolls that common name on his tongue and through his mind for hours. His violin bears the brunt of frustration and anger that evening.
Lestrade’s hand no longer tries to restrain but instead guides him forward. Mycroft slides across the seat allowing Sherlock to clamber in next to him. Sherlock curls into a ball against the cool leather, using his coat to cover his eyes. If he can’t see anything at all then maybe his nausea will recede and his sweaty palms will dry and all of this will go away.
He waited for the impact.
“Should I expect a happy announcement? Mummy will be thrilled.”
But, alone on the roof, with cigarette smoke curling into the midnight blue sky, Sherlock can let his guard down. The doubts, the anger, the pain at being rejected by the person who was supposed to be perfect for him, the one made for him just the way he is, can come bubbling to the surface. His soulmate was able to give him his colours back but was unable to actually stay and tolerate being with him. His soulmate didn’t even need to speak to him to decide that. He was gone long before Sherlock even woke up. Normally it takes at least one conversation for Sherlock to drive someone away. He thought his soulmate would be made of sterner stuff.
“In the cathedral? Are you a priest then?”
against his skin. Against the heat of John’s palm. That was the impact he’d been waiting for. Waiting for years, possibly forever, to finally end his fall and to end it here.
“This all right?”
Sherlock is mid-sentence, deducing the victim’s hair care routine, when the ever present ache in his chest explodes outward like a cannon ball.
Sherlock doesn’t let go. Instead, he fists the bed sheets tightly, as if he were hanging on to a ledge.
When he’s damp and flushed from the warm water pool, he makes his way to the steam room. He takes a towel, folded over his arm, to sit on. More out of concern for himself than for any politeness toward others.
A stab of petulant displeasure rockets through Sherlock. “I don’t want to stop.”
Sherlock has to look away. Instead he watches himself wrap a hand around ‘John’s’ cock and stroke it, teasing the partially hard head to peek from the foreskin. They fall into an easy rhythm. It’s not rushed, nor is it languorous. There’s more to it than just a handjob between near-strangers in a dark bathhouse. It feels charged somehow. Sherlock can’t look back to ‘John’s’ face. His eyes are too deep and too blue. Instead, Sherlock lets his gaze pinball back and forth between their hands and cocks.
That’s not true though. The night sky is a deep navy, sometimes cobalt and sometime a deep purple, but never just the monochromatic black that limited his vision for years. The stars themselves twinkle and John swears he can see shades of pink and turquoise in their lights.
“How can I have a strong bond with someone I’ve never even spoken to?” The red thread of his button hole is the wrong shade. It looks like rust and Sherlock cannot bear it. He pulls the coat from in front of his face but stays curled against the seat.
Sherlock’s room is a bit singed but, structurally, it fared much better than the sitting room. There’s a hole in the wall near the door and the windows were blown out, but otherwise the damage was minimal. A camping lantern casts an eerie glow around the room. The holes where the windows used to be are boarded over, blocking all light from the street, and Sherlock hasn’t had a chance to have an electrician in to replace the light fixtures yet.
Île de la Cité was as crowded as any other Parisian neighbourhood, but John pushed and forced his way to the entrance of the great cathedral. It was his annual pilgrimage.
Sherlock’s jaw drops in outrage. Why bother to bring him the piece before the rest of the orchestra if he had no say in whether or not they played it? “Un-announce it.”
“We’ll meet there tomorrow evening. Seven o’clock. Sorry, gotta dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
Sherlock lets his eyelid slide closed again. Well, the steam
Sherlock lets go. And he goes, and goes, and goes. He can hear John moan, fingers still pumping in and out, but it’s as if he’s very far away. Cotton blocks his ears and the sea rages in them. He comes long and hard.
John’s cock grew plump and began to ache. “God, yes.”
Or he tried to. He gagged instead. But Sherlock was never one to give up. Instead, he tried to push past it, to take more and more of John across his tongue and into his throat.
“Gone?”
Mycroft presents him with an even more frightening prospect. Sherlock is home for a school holiday and bemoaning the idiots in his year who sneak around and press their fingers together like finding a soulmate is as worthy of their time as basic educational instruction when Mycroft snaps.
The detective’s brow creases. He’s about to contradict Sherlock. Something is not quite right about the deduction. Sherlock just needs to push it a bit farther, to see beyond the obvious. He rakes a quick glance over the man’s clothes and shoes again.
Sherlock laughs. It reverberates from deep within his chest until it rumbles free from his throat. It feels like the first genuine laugh he’s had in ages. John matches him with glittering eyes and that same slow smirk he wore at the baths.
His palm came to rest against John’s erection and but he did not move or squeeze or do anything to relieve the ache there.
“You may do what you like to me until I say stop. But, you will fuck me here, in view of all Paris, and you will make me beg for it.”
Sherlock cleared his throat. If he was going to fall, to jump, he needed to be specific. “What do you need to know?”
“I know enough.” John looks up and the expression on Stamford’s face is more confused and hurt than he’d imagined. “I know that I can’t risk my future, risk what I’ve worked for, just because my soulmate is a fucking moron.”
“Hmmmm. That’s not what people usually say.” His post-orgasmic lassitude is wearing off. He’s not restless again but he’s already thinking of the other things he could be doing.
Instead, John slid to his knees and spread Sherlock’s cheeks. He ran his nose along the sensitive skin on either side of Sherlock’s crack, until Sherlock pressed back into John’s face.
“Does that mean you’re going to stay this time?”
Maybe John will meet him tomorrow. But he abandoned him once, why not do it again? The pull of happiness, of acceptance and love, strains against Sherlock’s defenses. Coming face to face with John, with his soulmate, makes the possible future he has tried so hard to ignore a nearly tangible thing. All he has to do is trust that John will feel the same bone-deep wanting that he does, despite his better judgement.
John looks star-struck.
He’s grateful for the distraction of John’s cock in his hand. It gives him something else to focus on, instead of the tightness pulling at his core and the heat pooling at the base of his spine. Instead, he uses his thumb to map the veins on the underside of John’s cock with each stroke from base to tip.
“Change can be slow.” Sherlock murmurs against John’s lips as he pulls away.
He smiles at them before ducking into the staff locker room. John’s barely got his scrub top over his head when Mike Stamford busts into the room.
Not even Mycroft’s knowing look and snide comment about Sherlock soon retiring his gloves is enough to elicit much of a response. Surely, if Sherlock ignores it, it will go away. But that desire to reach out and touch Victor, to press his lips against Victor’s wrist or to trail a finger along the inside of Victor’s arm, doesn’t go away no matter how much Sherlock tries to push it down.
“Why didn’t you tell me the spots on the floor were a mix of red and brown?” John had been genuinely surprised to realize he could see the difference in the two shades now but he really just need another topic of conversation, anything except the figure in the bed.
Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock shrugs. Now that he’s initiated this conversation, it feels too intimate, too close. “When I woke up, my colours had returned.” He tries to make it sound nonchalant but the arch of Mycroft’s eyebrows tell him he did not succeed.
“Christ, Sherlock.”
John nods and Sherlock watches his Adam’s apple bob in his throat. “Okay, good. That’s good. Why don’t you touch yourself and I’ll touch myself and we’ll do this together then?”
Sherlock smiles a bit and bends his neck a bit to press a kiss to the crown of Rosie’s head. “It’s the Calpol kicking in.” She does feel cooler already, but Sherlock’s not sure that’s actually possible.
“Turn around. Hands on the balustrade.”
Sherlock sways a bit toward John. He always moves toward John, even now years and lifetimes later. It’s like a magnet. Strongest in both quiet, intimate moments and in the chaos of their most dangerous times.
The newly discovered emotional, needing and wanting part of Sherlock begs to cry out at the injustice. But the more logical, grounded part of him maintains control. “Mrs. Hudson says there’s a second bedroom upstairs. If we’ll be needing two.”
Oh, that is interesting. Terribly interesting. Sherlock is already adding facts about the location and the presence of a note to what he’s memorized about the other victims based on newspaper articles and what he was able to hack from the Met’s database system.
Between the two of them, they’ve cut off the blood flow to his right arm and it’s gone numb. But he doesn’t want to wake either of them.
But then Sherlock sees John out of the corner of his eye, stifling a yawn and stuffing destroyed case files in a bin bag. The sentimentality is fine. Even if it means going through the entire flat bit by bit instead of just shoveling everything through the blown out windows and starting over.
John slides his nose along Sherlock’s jaw and presses a lingering kiss just under Sherlock’s ear. “Time to get up, I guess.”
John laughed at him. John laughed at him and kissed his lips without caring that they were still covered in ejaculate.
He stepped to the balustrade to look over the heads of gargoyles and angels to the people below. They resembled nothing more than teeming, brightly colored dots from this height.
“If Mrs. Hudson comes home, I’ll catch you up, all right?”
Sherlock thinks as his smoke drifts toward the few pinpricks of light visible against the light pollution of London.
There was the desperation John had been waiting for.
“You have to tell me what you like.”
“Sherlock. I live here.”
But John is here now, staring at him with a mix of trepidation and hope in his eyes. And John’s thumb is still a distracting sensation against Sherlock’s skin.
There’s only silence from Lestrade, but he’s not leaving. Sherlock gathers his most convincing arguments, how the cut of Lestrade’s suit coat tells him he met his soulmate young. That it’s a woman. How Sherlock could tell that he was in the field investigating a case on the south bank this morning even though he was told to stay away just from the mud on his shoes. That he has no children and is conflicted about that. But Lestrade speaks before Sherlock has the opportunity to really dazzle him.
“Any good?”
“John?”
John seems mollified, his anger no longer threatening to boil over. “Needed it for your consulting detective business.” Sherlock’s surprise must show on his face because John adds, “I looked you up on the internet last night. Found your website, The Science of Deduction.”
“John, ambulance is bringing in an OD. He coded en route. ETA… well, now.”
“What is this, Sherlock?”
It doesn’t take long until John is back and prodding at him. This time he tears the sheet away and leaves Sherlock nude and spread eagle on the bed.
‘John’ stiffens for a split second but his hand doesn’t move. “I thought you said there was no talking?” His voice is close to Sherlock’s ear and Sherlock stretches his neck into it.
She fusses constantly. The moments when she’s not whining or clenching her little fists in a shockingly accurate imitation of her father are frustratingly brief. She’s feverish and uncomfortable and she’s making John’s life miserable.
“Yes.”
John stood before him, head hung down but eyes looking up as if the weight of his own thoughts was too heavy a burden to lift.
The sentimentality of his possessions weighs him down. This wouldn’t have been the case five years ago. Or maybe even three years ago.
He doesn’t need to see any more. Because he can feel. He can feel every patch of sweaty skin as it sticks to the bed sheets. He can feel the stretch in his hips where John has him spread wide across his thighs.  And he can feel John’s fingers, two of them, slide slowly out of his arse and then be pushed deep again, filling him up. He moans a little every time.
Tonight, he and John will go to dinner without having to order pasta bolognese from the children’s menu and then he will succeed at seducing John on the sofa while the TV plays in the background. Tomorrow he’ll finish the experiment with the pig, maybe solve a crime, and remember that it’s his day to pick Rosie up from school. The thought of repeating these days ad nauseam no longer fills him with anxious dread. Instead, he smiles and looks forward to each and everyday.
John looks back to Sherlock, willing himself to see this for the disaster it could easily become. He needs a strategic retreat. He needs to show Sherlock how absolutely foolish this idea is, even without the complicating notion that they are soulmates. “Then who said anything about flatmates?”
The stage lights are up and John doesn’t see him. Lestrade gives John permission to go ahead and Sherlock holds his breathe.
“Of course I should.”
Sherlock drops his hand in shock. “You were in the band? They don’t shoot the band!”
It’s the fourth time John has yawned. Sherlock isn’t counting, except apparently he is.
***************
He shoots a sharp look to the detective in the uncomfortable plastic chair. “What was your name again?”
And if he spends more nights on the roof than in his own bed, that’s his own business. He locks it all away when he’s not on the roof, alone in the night.
John shrugs as if everything is fine and Sherlock’s heart skips a beat. They’re closer, more in sync with each other than they have every been. It just took John losing part of his family and Sherlock gaining part of his to bring them here.
He’d done the calculations. The airbag would catch him with minimal jarring. All he had to do was hit the target. It was thrilling really.
“Yes, that thought had crossed my mind.” The detective’s dry sense of humor is another surprise.
“Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.” John looks anything but willing to back away from this.
him out there. It’s not comforting and, most of the time, it’s not something to be maudlin over either. The man’s absence allows Sherlock to pursue the life he wants, to build something for himself. It’s what he’s always wanted and he’ll protect it fiercely.
Stamford is smiling as if John’s whole world hasn’t fallen apart. “Nurses say it’s better to hide blood drips.”
“Problem?” And damn if the quirk of his eyebrow doesn’t make John’s mouth go dry.
“Amazing.”
Sherlock wishes he could say he’d change that, but deep down he’s not sure he could do it. He couldn’t change it knowing what they have now. He’s not that strong, that unselfish. He would want John to have Mary back, but he’s glad it’s not his choice to make.
Molly has stopped chatting with the second violin. The cellists who haven’t already left are staring at him. Their eyes are all full of pity for Lestrade and confusion about why Sherlock is still here in the first place.
This is new. They’re taking it slowly. But it may not last. If this is all he gets of John Watson, he will remember it forever.
John doesn’t acknowledge that, except that the fingers of his left hand tighten into a fist at his side.
“Christ. What would you like?” John’s voice is sleepy and slow.
“Suffer? How will I suffer? I am always alone. Alone protects me.” Sherlock is thinking about Victor about that horrible moment when their hands touched and nothing happened. He’s thinking about how Victor pulled away after that. Surely even a soulmate would do the same, create the same distance, once they actually got to know Sherlock Holmes. If his personality alone wasn’t enough to keep Victor why would an unexplained bond be any different?
John feels an unexpected, inexplicable shock of hope and excitement pierce his heart. “Who was the first?”
That is absolutely not what Sherlock wants. But the gentle nudge John gives his hip has him rolling over with only a grumbled complaint.
Learning his new piece wasn’t causing Sherlock’s muscles to knot and twist, but the strain of not bashing his head into the wall certainly was. He sunk down into the pool until warmth lapped at his chin. Soaking in the warm pool allowed the body to acclimate to hotter temperatures before entering the sauna. It also allowed an up close and personal view of those that prefered to fuck in water instead of steam.
“Four,” Sherlock murmurs as he watches Lestrade throw the police cruiser into park in the middle of the street.
Sherlock barely got a hand around his cock before he was crying out, shouting so loudly that surely even the revellers below stopped to listen. John imagined his come splattering against the stone at their feet and against the balustrade.
“How is it gone? It’s been years.” John looks as shocked as Sherlock feels. “Nothing’s different about me.”
He chooses the largest of the steam rooms. Maybe quantity of stimulation will overrule any lack of quality he’s sure to find here.
Lestrade doesn’t drop his ankle. “How do you know that?”
He pulls on his smoothest, silkiest dressing gown before padding out to the sitting room on bare feet.
“Dinner?”
He’s vulnerable, held open by no more than those two fingers but no less exposed than a insect pinned to a spreading board. Sherlock stretches his arms toward John, but finds him just out of reach. He keeps stretching, fingers splayed out and shoulders coming up off the bed.
“I will remain as I am, only with the benefit of enhanced vision. That is all that will change because of this incident.” He says it the way Mycroft would. To hopefully force understanding into that swollen head of his.
Except for this part. This was the part that worried him.
John’s pointedly cleared throat stops him with his face halfway to the counter top.
He waits until John is out of the bedroom and he can hear the everyday domestic noises of the kitchen. Only then does he get out of bed, and stretch languorously in the late morning sun. The sun warms his skin and Sherlock feels as if he has all the time in the world. That it ticks by slowly and comfortably now that he has found John. John will wait for him to emerge from the bedroom. He waited for John, and John waited for him, so a little more time means nothing. The world is a collection of blues and reds and golds and greens, and Sherlock Holmes isn’t going to miss a single one.
Sherlock took his hand away and John groaned.
Other nights, John thinks about coming home to a dingy flat to find that Sherlock had spent their meager savings on cocaine and was passed out in a pool of his own vomit. He thinks about Harry, he thinks about other patients he had in London hospitals, thinks about his own father. He can’t go back to that. He worked too hard to get away from it in the first place.
John stops in front of him, just a foot away and just a shade too close for friendly company. His knuckles turn white on the handle of his clarinet cases.
Sherlock stops himself before saying any of that. “I needed my colour vision back. Which you were able to give me. That’s all.”
“We’ve only just met and we’re going to go and look at a flat?” It’s a lie but a tiny one. They didn’t really meet the day Sherlock changed his life forever and John ran as far away from him as he could.
Or maybe it won’t be so bad afterall. Through the steam, on a high riser in the far corner, Sherlock spots blue eyes and a starburst scar. He threads his way over the benches, past men who reach for him, to join the ‘John’ in the corner.
“Christ, fuck me. Please.”
Sherlock is still trying to pull away from Lestrade when the great black saloon car pulls up directly in front of him. It takes up the length of his vision and the front end slides into the colour of ash as surely as if it had been burned around the edges. Maybe that’s what this is. The heart is burning out of him and scorching his colours along with it. The heart he never got the chance to truly know.
“The only reason I met him is because he’s a drug addict that can’t measure properly.” John tears his gaze away from that pale (miraculous) figure in the bed to stare at the floor. “I can’t. I can’t be with someone like him.”
Sherlock’s almost sorry about that.
The stranger pulled him through the doorway and into the cold air. He took a gulp and could almost taste the city many metres below them. He could hear faint sounds of the Feast of Fools echoing up Notre-Dame’s solid walls.
“Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?”
“No, I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t ready to take on a junkie kid as my soulmate. Especially a junkie kid who I only met because he was stupid enough to overdose in the first place!”
“I never guess.” Sherlock stares him down for a moment longer, looking for anything he’s missed but it’s shockingly hard to read a naked man.  “I know every musician in London.”
Sherlock looked back over his shoulder and growled, “I said, ‘fuck me, Captain’.” His eyes crackled like a storm split sky and he panted through parted lips.
Sherlock holds that card between his fingers as if it were gold, immediately committing the number to memory, long after Lestrade leaves. Meaning comes from purpose, not from other people. He will not be lonely, he will not live a life unfulfilled just because the person who was supposed to stay with him - was supposed to love him - ran away.
***************
The other students in his school and then at uni run around like animals pressing bare flesh to bare flesh in an attempt to get back something they’ve lost along the way. Some of them, more and more of them everyday it seems, find their soulmate and are able to see the world in all its hues and complexity again. And Sherlock’s world stays the colour of ash. But he still never feels compelled to remove his gloves and press his fingers against anyone else.
The giggle that bubbles out of John’s mouth sounds panicked even to his own ears. He scrubs a hand across his face.
“It is rare, but in the case of strong bonds, colour vision can be lost upon the death of one of the soulmates. It is very disorienting, and very painful.” There’s no smugness nor pity in Mycroft’s voice. Only a recitation of the facts.
John rose to stand above him, chest heaving and cheeks stained pink. His hands clenched at his sides again, but this time there was no anger in it. Just lust and restraint.
. That he hadn’t thought to consider. John’s lips open and close and stroke and caress across Sherlock’s mouth. Irene’s mouth had moved as well, but not like this.
John licked and sucked and thrust with his tongue until Sherlock was rocking back hard against John’s face. Then, he pulled back just enough to work a finger into Sherlock’s wet hole.
He stretches, hands high above his head,  just enough to crack his back. It gets John’s attention.
But he can see. Oh, can he see. Shades of red and brown and gold that he can’t even remember from his youngest days of childhood pop before his eyes. It’s almost overwhelming - like coming from a the deepest, darkest cave into full and bright sunlight. But he’s wanted these colours for so long, dreamed having the blues and greens back again, that he may never shut his eyes again.
Lestrade bursts into the Baker Street sitting room.
It takes a solid 2.5 seconds for Sherlock to realize John is talking to Rosie. She’s woken up and is blinking owlishly at John, sleep still clinging to her. Of course she doesn’t answer his age-inappropriate question. She’s barely uttering any words at her age, much less complex answers about physical health.
John holds his curled fist still and Sherlock fucks his grip. There’s enough sweat and come between them to make everything slide without unpleasant friction. He pushes against John’s shoulder to slide himself nearly all the way out of John’s hand, then slam back in until the heel of John’s hand brushes where his balls are tight and hot against his body.
“There is no relationship!”
Just the shallow movement of rocking his hips again makes pleasure spark in Sherlock’s balls. He’s closer than he thought. He wraps his hand around John’s shoulder for leverage. “Just stay like that.”
A move that’s blocked by John… and Rosie. Always both of them now.
He’s pivoting, shoulder already turned to the door, when John breaks the silence.
Sherlock may not believe that’s the man’s name, but it’s irrelevant anyway. He now knows that his eyes are blue and not brown, that he has a fascinating and ugly starburst scar on his left shoulder, and that the callouses on the pads of his fingers feel like the tiny half-moon roughness one acquires from frequently playing on woodwind ring-keys.
They meet because they’re both the only underclassmen in their advanced chemistry seminar. Sherlock bullied his way in as a fresher but Victor’s a senior whose previous exemplary work and desire to go on to be a master chemist earned him a place in the class. Victor is intelligent and kind and never treats Sherlock as anything except a valued colleague in the chemistry lab. Even when he catches Sherlock staring at his hands during experiment preparations.
Sherlock had known this would be John’s reaction. John was a man of action but he still reached for words because he felt that he needed to. Predictable.
Sherlock can hear Mycroft and Lestrade murmuring something over his head, but he can’t be bothered to pay attention. His heart is pounding and he feels weak. The door slams and Sherlock takes a gulp of air. The gentle rolling of the car through the London streets rocks and soothes him.
“It’s dangerous to lose one’s balance in the heights of the cathedral.”
Sherlock bent a bit more, flattening his back so he could push against John more firmly. It also gave John a better view of the city.
If only he’d been able to see how red Mycroft’s neck became, he could have said how long ago she walked out.
“Only minor drug offenders land themselves in hospital. The rest stay out there and keep offending.” The detective’s not mad, not exactly. He’s frustrated and his cheeks turn just a little bit more pink, and Sherlock is so very glad to be able to finally see that.
Mrs Hudson opens the door behind him and he goes willingly into her embrace. Things are still very uncertain, chaotic even, and the hug is more grounding than Sherlock would like to admit.
Mike responds but John can only focus on the sound of Sherlock’s voice practically talking over him.
“Of course I’ve seen a doctor. I’m not an idiot. And, besides, I thought you were the one who didn’t want to ‘take on’ a soulmate?”
He doesn’t know a lot about John Watson, but he knows what’s important. A coward is the farthest thing from what John Watson is. The air is warm between them, standing so close now that their breaths mingle together and Sherlock has to bend his neck to see John’s face.
Sherlock’s chair survived the explosion but John’s did not. Sherlock’s would have been easier to replace; he could simply order a replacement for his. But John’s needs to have the fraying edges and lumpy cushion that mean it’s been well-used and provides nothing but comfort to its owner. Sherlock will have to put a call out to his homeless network to watch the nicest skips and second hand stores for something suitable. He can have it reupholstered in the correct fabric if the bones are good.
But still. He could know.
Sherlock pulled back first, but rested his forehead against John’s. “How long can you stay?”
The stranger stepped up to the railing and John got his first proper look at him.
Sherlock comes, back bowing, and with eyes wide open so he can watch himself come at John Watson’s touch.
Sherlock cross the sitting room and takes John’s shoulders in his hands again. He presses a quick, hard kiss to John’s lips then spins him toward the door, nearly knocking John’s feet out from under him.
“We’ll be right behind you in a cab.” Sherlock grabs his coat from where he tossed it on the sofa and slings it around his shoulders.
“Of course you don’t.” John kisses him again and pulls away. Sherlock nearly backs them both off the side of the bed in a quest for renewed contact. “I don’t want to stop either but… here, turn over.”
There are the noises they’re making themselves, of course. Shifts of the bed sheets under their bodies, the sounds of their bare legs rubbing against each other, the sound of their lips against each other. All things Sherlock wouldn’t have noticed if the flat weren’t so quiet. He’d thank Baker Street if he thought the building cared at all. This new level of quiet lets him file every scrap of fabric against skin, every heavy exhale, into a rapidly growing room in his mind palace.
Come morning, John is already up with Rosie and the flat looks that much cleaner, that much brighter.
“That or she has no idea what you’re saying. Makes it easier to deal with you.”
Sherlock looks up and their eyes meet for just a moment; those eyes are the same clear, icy blue John has dreamt of night after night. They focus on him and John feels laid bare.
He had made Sherlock sloppy with his mouth and tongue, so the second finger went in easily. John thrust those two in all way to their base. He picked a slow and steady pace of fucking Sherlock’s arse with his fingers. He would lean in and plant a kiss against Sherlock’s cheek or lick where the rim of Sherlock’s arse stretched around his fingers. But mostly, he sat back enough to watch his fingers disappear into Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock pushed him back enough to separate their lips. “Not like this, Captain. If I am above you, you will follow my orders while you fuck me. You dominate only in spirit. I still have the power here.”
“Hmm, no, haven’t the foggiest,” Sherlock lies with a beaming smile.
“That is definitely against the rules. Too far against the rules.”
John kissed him again. This time it was long and slow and full of all the love and loneliness John had stored up over the past year on the move with the king’s army.
Lestrade lays his card on the nightstand next to Sherlock’s elbow. “When you get done with your rehab or treatment or whatever, you call me, all right? We’ll see what we can work out.”
That cold, hard smile that Sherlock relishes spread across John’s face. “Is that a question or a statement, Sherlock, because I really don’t know.”
“Freak,” she sneered every chance she got. “Where’s your soulmate then?”
“Maybe we should slow down.” John presses a soft kiss to the knob of spine. It’s more like the kisses they’ve shared up to this point. It lacks the passion of John’s earlier exploration. Sherlock hates it, but he bends his head further to bare more of his neck to John.
“Yes, it’s amazing.” John’s words were strained and breathless. He took a small step forward but Sherlock moved again, forcing John back against the balustrade to keep their bodies from touching.
“What? Do I have something on my face? Bedhead?” It’s John’s standard ‘joking but concerned’ tone.
It’s quiet in Baker Street and Sherlock is more content than he can remember being in a very long time.
Sherlock pushes back, sliding his tongue along John’s. He’s pinned in his position on the sofa but he can respond with passion like this.
But by his first year of medical school, there are fewer and fewer unattached people. He still dates, still gets laid, but by other sorry sods who haven’t found their soulmates yet and who he already knows are no match for him. It’s starting to feel like there’s no one left. John’s not sure he even wants a soulmate anymore.
John took a great gulp of air. It was an expression of relief. “Are you sure? Sure that you know, I mean.”
John laughs against Sherlock’s skin and that hot, damp breath makes something deep in Sherlock’s core tighten. “I don’t want you to be quiet. I very, very much don’t want you to be quiet.”
, John tells himself. If he’s not seeing colours again, at least the young women and men he’s trying with aren’t either. It would be terrible to be someone’s soulmate but for them not to be yours. It’s not common, but it happens.
He just thought he’d be staying alone.
He doesn’t know enough to put a visible clock in the kitchen though. He eyes his phone, considers the state of his hands, and bends to use his nose to active the screen in order to see the time.
“--and that you have a weakness for the Feast of Fools and what it represents.”
Then Jeanette’s calf brushed the bare ankle of a tourist from Madrid on the bus and that was that. Turned out John was glad he’d never fully unpacked. It made heading back to a flat share with other students easier. Easier but not more bearable.
John shivered. How this man knew that the real attraction lay in the fact that any of those men, any of his commanding officers, could take back their rightful place over him, John did not know. He did not care, either. It finally felt like he was playing the same game with someone, not a private game with hidden rules.
Sherlock’s blood boils. All of the calming effects of a day of musical, even if rudimentary, work are gone. “Well, for once, you’re absolutely right. This isn’t the London Symphony.”
“Yes?” John is definitely worried now. His brow is creased and he sits on the edge of the bed. His hand is warm on Sherlock’s bare thigh. “Has it spread?”
“Yeah, that would be good. Good for now at least. For awhile.” John sounds like he’s babbling and his breath is coming in ragged inhalations. He rests his forehead against Sherlock’s. Sherlock has to say slightly bent over to make that position possible but he’s happy to stay like that, crick in his neck be damned.
“Why would I get up for that? You can bring them in here.”
John had to unclench his jaw to speak. “Are we just friends? Friends that have fallen into bed with each other, oh, four times now, or are we something else?”
“Hey, turn your bloody alarm off.”
Even without the aid of stimulants stronger than nicotine, Sherlock still doesn’t sleep much. When he’s working, the long nights don’t bother him. Between cases, however, it’s a very different story. The loneliness, that bone deep ache in his chest where
Sherlock opens both eyes now. The runner has straddled his lover’s lap and is stroking both of them in one hand while they kiss. At least three other men in the darkened sauna are also having sex. The sound of skin against skin has a rhythm to it, where hips met and flesh smack together. Sweat drips from Sherlock’s soaked curls in counterpoint to the music of sex around him.
John’s fingers start to move again, sliding nearly all the way out then curling as John pushes them back in. It feels glorious but it means that Sherlock has lost. “No, you want to use me as a cover.  I can go faster, or I can go slower, but this is all you get.”
His fist moves up and down John’s cock with increasing speed, and flexes his fingers until he finds the right amount of pressure that makes John’s breath quicken. John rocks his hips a bit but it’s nothing like the overwhelming urge Sherlock feels to thrust, to fuck, as John strokes him in return. John seems so much more in control compared to how Sherlock feels. But there’s sweat beading on his upper lip and the muscles in his chest and shoulders twitch, so that control may be hard fought for. Sherlock sees no reason to fight at all anymore.
“He had a lisp. Just a slight one, when he spoke. I’m sure he would have grown out of it in time…” Sherlock’s voice cracks as the vines around his heart tighten. He can’t hear Victor’s voice but he knows,
The leather of the seat creaks as Mycroft leans toward Sherlock. “I will tell you everything I know about the man. I will forward you the information I’ve collected. But you have to want to know.”
“I should take her home.”
The sparks were good enough. More than good enough. It was the best relationship of John’s life. Dates turned into day long stretches of just spending time together. The sex was fantastic and John actually enjoyed waking up in Jeanette’s too-soft bed on days he didn’t have early lectures. He was happy.
“It matches just fine.”
He watched his cock enter Sherlock over and over again until he had to look away to keep from coming.
Certainty doesn’t do anything to relieve fear though. Sherlock can only manage a silent head nod and licking his dry lips.
“Detective Sergeant Greg Lestrade,” the man says by way of greeting. He barely flicks Sherlock a look. Just another drug addict that he needs to question.
“Oh, thank you.” Sherlock blinks at him in genuine confusion, but it only lasts for a split second before he’s striding toward John. It’s as if he’s unaccustomed to people offering him things, giving him consideration. The very core of John is aching to give him everything and Sherlock is confused by the gesture of a lent phone.
He tells himself that he’s not being cruel. That maybe Sherlock would wake up and have no knowledge that anything had happened. Maybe Sherlock was John’s soulmate but John was not Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s eyes would still see black and white and grey and John wouldn’t have to feel guilty about that at all.
“Come on, get up. You won’t sleep tonight.”
Sherlock swallows and forces down a breath. “I knew my soulmate touched me at Bart’s the night I came in but left quickly after. I never searched for you.” It seems important that Sherlock let John know that. That he wasn’t desperate or clingy, that he was happy to let John go if that’s what John wanted. “You worked there, you went into military service, and it’s likely the timeline would match up.” John has moved a few paces closer, or maybe Sherlock is the one who moved. He’s not quite sure. “And, I can feel it.”
John drinks the tea too quickly and it scorches his throat, but it’s not quite hot enough to dissolve the lump there.
“But which is it on this Feast of Fools, Captain? Do you consider me beneath you because I am forced to hide away from all society, or does my brilliant mind set me above you?”
John barely has time to think before he’s wrapped both of his hands around the man’s shoulders, pinning him to the gurney so the paramedics can give him the injection.
), Victor rests his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and bends to press their lips together. Sherlock lets his eyes fall shut and anticipates the burst of colour he’ll see when he opens them again. The kiss is dry and warm and lingering. It feels nice and comforting. Like coming home, if Sherlock had ever taken comfort in such a thing.
John looks to Mike and see him smiling so smugly that his lips look like they could split. “Oh, you… you told him about me?”
****************
This is better. It feels lasting. If John is moved to kiss him, to kiss him for the first time, when nothing more than an uncomfortable nap had passed between them, imagine the passion that affection would turn into in more heated moments.
It was over quickly for both of them. John came hard, at first with hot pulses down Sherlock’s throat but then a sharp pull on his hair popped John’s cock free and the final streaks landed across Sherlock’s lips and chin. Sherlock came, grinding against the heel of his hand, before John even made it out of his mouth.
They didn’t speak until John had tucked them both into Sherlock’s bed and pulled the covers up to their shoulders. They lay facing each other, a handsbreadth apart. Sherlock listened to John’s breathing. It wasn’t the gradual slide into deep and rhythmic breathing that indicated sleep. So Sherlock waited, watching John. Tension grew like a visible thread linking them together.
“Please. Sherlock, please.”
“I can’t believe Mycroft lets you have the run of this place.”
“Who are you?” John was breathless.
Mycroft lets Sherlock’s shout sit between them in the car for several long minutes before approaching from a different tactical vantage point.
Any number of stinging retorts come to Sherlock’s mind. He could talk about Lestrade’s wife’s infidelity or the man’s incompetence as a conductor, but instead he grabs his violin case and storms out with a graceful flare of his coat.
“Yes. I come every year.” The small passage was growing humid with their breaths.
John landed a sharp smack to Sherlock’s arse, then caressed it again. “Not yet.”
“That tie doesn’t match your suit. The shade of burgundy in the tie is at least two shades too dark for that light of a shade of grey.” Sherlock’s voice is rusty with disuse but it still causes Mycroft to falter mid-step.
‘John’ licks his lips like he would like to reciprocate but Sherlock has a piece to practice. He feels like music again.
Sherlock soaks for a few moments in one of cool water pools before finding his locker and redressing. The stranger never follows.
The detective who enters is far more interesting anyway.
“He?”
He wants to roll to kiss John’s lips but the pressure of John against his back, John’s lips on the back of his neck, feels too good. And there’s the benefit of not being able to actually see John that feels too intimate even in the near-silent darkness.
The part of this story that Sherlock was so happy about just a few moments ago, that he was proud to have avoided being trapped in something he didn’t want, fades away and he feels pinned to the scratchy, sterile hospital sheets under Mycroft’s gaze.
Sherlock scoffs. He can’t help it. The idea of him longing for someone, soulmate or not, is ludicrous. He’s only ever had one real friend and though Victor’s eventual abandonment stung, Sherlock barely thinks of it now. He’s practically deleted it. Mycroft is exaggerating, being sentimental, which is entirely unlike him. His scoff only seems to anger Mycroft more.
Sherlock grinned. “That means you consider me your better. You are more impressed with brains than brawn.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Sherlock yanks his leg free from Lestrade and continue to walk over the seatbacks until meets John at the bottom of the stage stairs.
“I didn’t tell you.”
He doesn’t worry through secondary school, or even through university. There are plenty of students around him who haven’t found their soulmates yet. And John might as well have fun in the mean time. A lot of fun, as it turns out.
John’s only concession is to bend and place a tiny kiss against Sherlock’s sweat-slick hipbone and to leave his fingers buried deep inside Sherlock’s arse.
“Molly shouldn’t be first chair.”
Sherlock kicks away from the side of the pool. His arms cut the water in front of him as he glides toward the stairs. The stranger’s knees fall open and Sherlock stops between them, a hand on each one and resting on his knees in the water. He pushes on the stranger’s knees, easing him up a step so that the water only reaches his thighs and his half-hard cock bobs along the surface.
He tells himself that.
His hands are shaking when he pulls out his phone.
The brow smoothes out and a look of astonishment comes over the detective’s face. For the first time, he lowers himself into the plastic chair by Sherlock’s bedside. “How did you know that?”
“Stay here.”
“The damaged spot in my left eye. Where I can only see grey.”
The idea of Sherlock striding out that door causes a kick of panic in John’s chest. The idea of meeting him again, of seeing him later, is too tenuous a connection to make John feel safe. He needs Sherlock to stay.
“Right, I’ll make tea.” John shuffles off to the kitchen before Sherlock can bring himself to look at John again.
Sherlock’s eyes frantically search the street. Cars are whizzing by as if nothing is happening. They enter the frame of his vision grey, brighten to shades of red or blue or black, then fade again as he loses sight of them. Panic still bubbles up in his throat and his hands twitch. He could flag down a taxi. Even if Lestrade won’t put him in one, he could make it himself back to Montague Street.
One of John’s hands drops to Sherlock’s hip to hold him steady. Sherlock misses the warmth of John’s arm locked around his chest, but the pressure of John’s finger tips wrapping around his hipbone makes him bite his lip to keep from crying out again.
John looks tired. Haggard, possibly. This isn’t his area. He’s a doctor, he cares for people, but he cares for those with acute injury or trauma. Even in his dull days of GP locum work, he would assess a situation, provide a solution, and send the person on their way. He didn’t have to care for long-term suffering.
Sherlock is ready for this line of illogic. “She’s sleeping and you’re exhausted. Why truck across London only to come back in the morning? Stay.”
As John moves, so does Sherlock. The stroke together, up and down, in a slowly building rhythm. Their knuckles rub together as they shift and inch closer together. Sherlock’s hips rock up into John’s grip and the sheet sticks to him in a growing, sweaty mess.
Sherlock shook his head and his curls caught in the breeze. John wanted to grab them and hold Sherlock’s head in place while he fucked his throat.
The only interruptions into their hushed, dark cocoon are the dull street lights stealing through the curtains and the soft crackle of a baby monitor.
There are more pleasantries and Sherlock leads John upstairs, stopping to wait for him to hobble up to the flat but never apologizing for the stairs. It’s not as if John will need the cane for long anyway.
Sherlock took another step toward him. The balustrade was already at John’s back but he was unafraid.
Sherlock’s hips bucked and he fucked himself between John’s cock and fist, begging for a harder, faster pace for both.
Curse John’s cock for showing interest in that. And curse Sherlock for nearly throwing them down the dark, twisting stairs in his haste.
Before John can shake himself out of this reverie and actually join Stamford in saving this kid’s life, the kid in question begins to shake. No, not shake,
John pulls back, still slowly, and Sherlock cranes his neck forward to chase him. He manages two quick pecks before John dips his head and takes his swollen lips out of Sherlock’s reach. He rests his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder. He’s contemplating the best way to use his chin as leverage against John’s forehead to force him to lift his face when he hears John’s soft murmur.
Both John and Rosie stare back at him with dark blue gazes full of feeling. Sherlock nods and his feet hit the stairs as he swallows around the rising lump in his throat.
Lestrade matches Sherlock’s shouting. “Yeah, cocaine withdrawal makes for shaky hands. Terrible trait in a violinist.”
John snorts out a laugh and Sherlock thinks he could get very used to that sound. “I’m a coward.”
Sherlock nods. There’s no other response he can give to that. He feels better, better about this situation, but there are still unresolved issues poking him in tender places.
The ripped apart feeling is still emanating from his chest but he can take tiny sips of air through his teeth if he’s careful. Sherlock struggles to his feet, Lestrade’s steadying hand still on his shoulder and his vision still grey around the edges.
That awestruck attention to detail fails him when John’s lips touch his. Any thought of trying to process and remember the objective details of this experience fly right out the window.
The back door of the saloon swings open, narrowly missing scraping against the pavement. Would Sherlock see sparks or would flame now be dull and lifeless? He can’t remember what it used to look like. Mycroft doesn’t bother to get out of the car. He only sticks his head through the open door to beckon Sherlock forward.
He looks a bit smug. And John thinks he has a right to be a bit smug.
John is looking around, avoiding Sherlock’s eyes, but Sherlock can bring him around if he’s given enough time. But Sherlock’s not sure he really wants to do that. John’s presence pulls something taut in his chest every time he breathes. Something deep in Sherlock’s very being wants John to stay, to stay forever, but layered on top of that is years of hurt that John ever left in the first place.
“No, not like that. I could consult with the police. When you have cases you can’t solve, which I’m sure is often, I can investigate for you. Use my skills to get the job done when you can’t.”
“Well, bit different from my day.”
“Not ready? Or just didn’t like what you saw when your full spectrum of colour vision returned?”
With that, the fight deflated out of John. He stood as if braced for a well-deserved punch.
. Why he’s a drug addict and why he had to be John’s soulmate.
This time Sherlock sucked on his earlobe and nipped at the skin under his jaw before replying. “It’s written in the way you stand, the way your challenge even a stranger, and the way your cock strains against your breeches.”
“I can also tell you that you enjoy breaking the rules. Not to a dangerous extent, and it’s not for the thrill of getting caught, you break the rules just enough to get the job done.”
‘John’ is watching him when Sherlock looks up. He keeps ‘John’s’ gaze as he trails his hand down again and wraps his palm around his cock. The humidity in the room gives enough constant moisture to let the skin slide smoothly.
John smiles at him. “We’re all right where we are, for now, right Rosie?” He bounces her a bit and she laughs. She must be feeling better.
“Don’t tell me what I do and don’t mean. You think I want to end up like you? Like Claire? Shackled together by some societal obligation but hating that constriction. It’s not a biological imperative. People can live without their soulmates indefinitely. You were just too weak to buck convention and now you suffer for it. I won’t be the same.”
Sherlock hears the insults. He always hears them, he just refuses to respond. The implication that he’ll never be able to get his colours back, that there’s no one out there for him and this grey curtain will remain over his vision forever, is intolerable. He cares less about the annoying addition of another person to his life than he does about being able to see and process the world in greater detail. There is so much he’s missing by not being able to differentiate saffron from goldenrod.
“Yeah, the sword and uniform probably gave that away.”
“Good. That’s good.” John pulls his hand away and gives Sherlock’s shoulder a warm squeeze. “Come on, I’ll make the eggs. You make the tea.”
Sherlock smirks as John leans over the cot to check on Rosie. He knows Sherlock has tucked her in correctly, that everything’s fine, but he has to look in on her anyway.
The bob of John’s Adam’s apple should not be as appealing as it is. “Ah… Mr. Holmes.”
“Shit.” John scrambles to tug his scrubs into place and barrels out of the locker room after Stamford. He didn’t even manage to properly put his bag away; his trousers are in a puddle on the floor as if he’d just stepped out of them after a night of heavy drinking. But that’s what John likes about the A&E: it can be completely calm and boring one minute and in total upheaval the next. It keeps him on the edge of his seat.
“What am I to you?”
“John, John, John…” Sherlock panted. His knuckles were white where he gripped the balustrade and his arse grasped more tightly at John’s cock with every thrust. Sweat beaded at the base of his neck and John leaned forward to lick it away. Sherlock was getting close, and so was John.
“That’s not enough begging.”
“I’m John.”
He was ready.
He rises and takes Rosie from Sherlock’s arms all while Sherlock sits dumbstruck.
John took only a few steps before he heard stone grinding against stone and his eyes were flooded with bright light.
***************
“Fuck me, Captain.”
Much like his soulmate. Sherlock can
He followed the stranger’s tug without thought. All trepidation fled and left only buzzing excitement in its wake.
“Oh God.”
But that means he emerges from a cab in front of Baker Street at the same time John knocks on the door.
Sherlock can only see frosty blues and greens that blend with the sea. Those have been his colours for as long as he can remember, since he was a baby. He is incredibly intelligent, obviously, but that has nothing to do with the old wives' tales parents tell their children about which colours they can see. Sherlock plans to do a scientific study on it, to measure his classmates’ observable personality characteristics against which colours are most visible to them before puberty in an attempt to disprove those legends. But then his parents give him an electron microscope for his eleventh birthday and biology and chemistry take hold of his mind instead of psychology and chromatics.
