The most logical explanation is that the knife itself is to blame. It looks ordinary enough, but I know appearances can be deceptive. My heightened senses detect nothing amiss about it; no trace of a curse or the influence of any unusual – I refuse to call them unearthly or magical – creatures such as we have come to know and hunt. It is, as far as I can tell, plain steel.
“Not at all. And you should not think of it so much as a failure as an aspect that has not yet had time to develop.” Dame Patience sighs, and her gaze is both supportive and amused as she looks at my friend. “You have been as you are for such a short time. You are astonishingly far along in your development, not limited or flawed, as you seem to believe. You naturally compare yourself to Mr Sherlock Holmes as he is the only other infected in your experience. He, too, is relatively new to the condition in general terms, and he is also extraordinary in his development, which gives you a misleading picture. Mr Holmes, how much longer have you been as you are now than Doctor Watson?”
Common wisdom holds that autumn is the season of change. Leaves turn, the days grow shorter, the weather turns cool. A season of harvest, of turning towards slumber.
I free Ancaster and his son and send them to safety after removing every memory of ever having been here. They will come to themselves once safely at home, with false memories of cleverly escaping their kidnappers when a violent altercation broke out between the two men who tried to abduct them.  They will have no recollection of Watson having been caught up in their adventure at all.
The raid cannot begin, and end, soon enough. I find myself almost hoping that there is some unnatural creature to be found among the more common criminal element. I would relish a threat to take my mind off of worry – and to vent some of my frustration upon.
With that single word comes a burst of knowledge, impressions given faster than words could possibly convey. I see through Watson’s eyes and memory, as if I had been there, the moment Constable Ancaster and Watson had been approached by two men – two men with Constable Ancaster’s young son trembling between them. The men hadn’t noticed Watson when they first approached, something not entirely uncommon since his transformation, but they certainly noticed him after they started to speak.  So Watson overheard the threat to the boy. The older rough demanded that Ancaster – and Watson, the inconvenient witness – come with them. There had been too many people around for Watson to risk acting with the speed and power that he could otherwise have brought to bear, not without being discovered. He has been forced to play captive, a helpless hostage.
They are not stopped. Not by the remaining criminals in the room; not by the additional miscreants summoned by the third man’s cry. Those men have other concerns.
Yet a seed of doubt remains. I know myself entirely too well to think that it will lie dormant. It will take root and grow if I do not find a way to eliminate it. But how?
Watson’s eyelids drift closed. His mouth moves, and then he drinks at last. I see this throat swallow several times before he sags more heavily into my supporting arms. He did not consume very much, but we need less blood than myth and superstition suggest. I have to believe it is enough.
“The very strictest confidence,” Mycroft affirms. “Nothing learned in this meeting will go beyond us four. I give you my word on that.”
die, Doctor. Your heart stopped, your lungs ceased. You were dead, however briefly. You revived, and how and why this sometimes occurs is still not something we can explain. Some who have done so have said, then or later, that they had some great task or purpose still unfinished, but it is by no means universal - ”
It was in autumn, well before I ever met Mary, that Holmes and I became lovers of a sort. But Holmes’ interest in our physical relations was never strong, and our interactions infrequent. Outside of those relations he treated me much as he had ever done; certainly not as a lover, and sometimes not even as a fellow thinking creature with desires of his own.
I’m sure that Mycroft has deduced the intimate nature of the relationship between my friend and myself. Mycroft probably realized I was in love with Watson before I did. Nonetheless, the private details of our relationship – and how my feelings, and John’s, were integral to my success in saving his life by infecting him with the same blood-borne contagion I have – is nothing I want shared, not even with my brother. Most certainly not with this stranger, however well-meaning and benign she might be. Those details are sacred to us, and only us. Watson clearly feels the same, for he only briefly mentions that I acted to change him and thereby save his life after he was shot and dying from the ruptured artery in his leg. He gives the date, and then immediately moves on to describe his abilities as he sees them. Interestingly but understandably, he consistently uses me as a reference by which he measures himself.  I am the only other so-called vampire he knows.
“As am I, and I believe I might have one further bit of advice to offer,” Dame Patience adds. “While your shoulder, or at least the site of your wounding, will always remain a point of some vulnerability to you, it does not have to remain an unprotected one.  There are ways of armoring such points, both physically and otherwise.”
Were he near enough to catch my thought, Watson would appreciate the poetry, even as it would make him worry. He knows fear makes me poetic – and occasionally reckless.
, I want to snap, but I will not appear anything but calm and focused on the case. I shrug. “I had thought so, but he is not present, and we cannot hold off the raid on his behalf.” True, very true, and yet gall and wormwood, bitter medicine. Believing me essentially cold and indifferent even to those few I call friends, always more focused on cases than people, has always been necessary armor, but even more so now.
It was the most joyous and unexpected surprise of my life to discover that Watson wanted me, loved me, desired me, just as much as I had long since loved him.
Mary agreed to Mycroft standing as godfather, as easily as I agreed to Mrs Forrester standing as godmother. Mycroft himself, when I went to ask him, seemed unchanged at first by his brother’s loss, but his visible emotion when I told him that we intended to bestow Holmes’ name on the child in some fashion quickly corrected that false impression. He only asked that if our child was a boy we
“It’s possible, or perhaps they meant to use his body to implicate someone else in his death. A final swindle for a swindler.  It’d be like Loper to use one of his men so.”
Slowly, step by step, gesture by gesture, with trial and error, I not only found my way back to myself, but to Holmes, and then we found our way to each other. It would be inaccurate to say that we renewed our affair, for the relationship between us was nothing like what it had been before. It couldn’t be, for I was a different man than I had been then. Holmes, too, had changed.  Some of our changes meant that we able to be better to each other, more for each other.  We had both learned valuable lessons of pain and endurance, kindness and giving. I had learned more about how to love, and be loved, from Mary and Arthur. Holmes had not had such direct lessons, but he has always been a ferociously quick study of any subject that interested him.
Dame Patience turns to face him at once, her expression contrite. “It is I who should beg your pardon, Doctor. I should not have spoken in such an obscure manner, and I should have finished all the tests before stating any results.  If you will give me another five minutes, I will finish my analysis.”
“Natural aptitudes play a part,” Mycroft murmurs with a knowing glance in my direction. “As do natural aversions. My brother delights in disguise, in interrogation, and in misdirection. Making others believe that they see something other than what is real is a natural extension for him, as is getting others to answer his questions. You, on the other hand, have a reputation for honesty and directness. Small wonder, then, that compelling others to believe untruths does not come easily to you. I suggest you start with an aspect that more closely aligns with your training and personality. Perhaps the sleep compulsion; it is much the same as using poppy syrup to assist a patient into slumber, without the risk of dangerous side effects.”
Watson smiles faintly. “I remember the woman from a medical lecture on the dangers of tight-lacing.” The smile vanishes. “Are you saying that all these people actually did die and somehow came back to life? Are you saying that
“Sherlock told me that you experienced an unusual episode, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft says as soon as he is seated. “He is concerned for your health, as am I. I have taken the liberty of asking a colleague of mine to lend her expertise to the matter. Please forgive any presumption on my part; I only did so out of the best intentions.” He gestures to the middle-aged woman, who nods politely, her dark eyes sharp and bright. “Sherlock, Doctor Watson, please let me introduce you to Dame Patience Hansen, a researcher whose expertise may prove pertinent to your problem. Dame Patience, my brother Sherlock Holmes, and his friend Doctor John Watson.”
And so autumn saw the advent, and later the christening, of Arthur Holmes Watson. Arthur for Mary’s father, Holmes for my friend, two beloved and much-missed men. Our lives changed completely once again with all the adjustments that come with a child.
But not entirely. We grew wiser, our love grew stronger and richer, but we also grew older. Age crept up on us like thieves, stealing tiny fractions of our strength, our resilience, one day at a time. My leg and shoulder grew more painful. Holmes, too, had his own aches, and no longer found it such a trivial matter to go weeks with little rest. Winter nights spent in the rain and sleet, summer days spent sweltering in London’s stench, grew less appealing even for the most interesting cases. But we still loved the life we had, as we loved each other. The autumn of our lives was approaching, but we were happy to remain in late summer, still hale enough, still quick and clever and fast enough, to continue as we had been.
swept out in an attempt to overpower his. It was not something I had intended at all; it simply happened, part of the process and beyond my control. As it happened, Watson’s will was a match for my own. If it hadn’t been…
Harry had gotten over being drunk and suffered a mild headache due to the painkillers that they gave her. When she was actually self aware of what she was doing and saying she was a lot more like John than Lestrade thought. She was nice, quite smart, a little bit short -around John height-, and she was homosexual.
“And look, that man looks nothing like John! Look at him Anderson!" Lestrade pointed to the screen as he rewind it to the part where a blonde man was being escorted to a black limousine.
Sherlock wouldn't just stand back and allow John to have his memories plucked out of his mind. He wouldn't let anyone hurt or take John away from Sherlock unless it was for happiness.
She had dark blue trousers on, short blonde hair that went to her shoulders, a skin tight, yellow green shirt that outlined her flat stomach, with some running shoes on. Her head was down and she slouched in the chair, making it impossible to see her face.
He sniffed tried to push the tears down, which he did, but they came back up when John wouldn't leave his head. He was right, John was gone and he wasn't even trying to find him. He literally had to be fed and watered because he was sulking. John really was gone and he wouldn't remember Sherlock when he came back.
“I got information about the case and the disappearance of John Watson. I had gone to the shop and went looking through the store before heading to the cash register and noticed marks and dents.” Sherlock picked up the file and pulled out the printed pictures he had taken on his phone the cash register and conveyor belt.
Sherlock stepped on all the papers to go into his room. He turned the knob of the door, opening it barely and crack, and kicking it open so hard it hit the wall and bounced right back to where Sherlock's foot had been, missing it due to Sherlock stomping into the room before it touched the wall. He looked around his room from the middle of it and sighed in frustration. Nothing could keep up with his mind at the moment, not even science.
Mycroft's head snapped up to stare at his brother. His eyes flickered towards his brothers elbows before going back to his gaze. Sherlock held a defensive frown, daring his brother to ask about or check his arms.
“John you idiot.” Lestrade looked to his right where Sherlock had mumbled before turning his attention back to the screen.
“Sherlock, dear, you know I'm here.” Mrs. Hudson said as she stirred Sherlock's tea, the toast and fruit bowl done.
Molly ran around the halls, files and papers and pens in her hands as she quickly went from one person to the next. She had been the major part of the autopsy reports and she still had yet to fail.
"Well, you awake or do you wanna play this game? I can play it, but I don't think you'll like the rules with it."
She could hear him scavenging and riffling through the papers and drawers. She frowned as the prospect of them getting caught swam through her head. She then sighed and let her shoulders sag as she replayed Sherlock's question in her head. What made him so different? Well, there was the fact that he helped find people's murderers so no one else is hurt; that's a starter.
“Sherlock.” The elder Holmes brother mumbled as he saw the wall that was attacked by pictures of missing people and red string that was thrown everywhere there was a thumbtack.
The cashier swallowed before nodding and stepping out. He moved to close the door but Lestrade shook his head and held the door in place with his right hand.
The doorknob twist and slowly opened, creaking as it made its way out Into the hall to show what was hiding in it. Mycroft had made his move to tighten his grip on his umbrella, only to remember that he had foolishly left it out on top of the stairs, abandoned and slowly collecting dust. Lestrade leaned even lower and widened his hands to tackle the person behind the door if needed.
John, unknowing on what to do, watched as he threw his tantrum and stomped in circles around the two chairs that were John's and Sherlocks.
“Look. He's not breathing Lestrade. He just… Fell. I don't know. I was outside of the room when I heard the thud.” Donovan said as she rubbed her arms with her hands.
Sherlock held himself back, knowing that three strides was all it could take to get to the man and bash his head in. John had relied on Sherlock to find and get him and he was at Baker Street drinking tea and staring at a bloody useless paper. John was out there, hurting and confused, and Sherlock was in here, staring at a television screen and yelling.
The two men stepped outside of the car and walked over to the doorsteps, Lestrade saying ‘excuse me’ as Sherlock frowned at the box and bumped into passing people without any signs of apologising.
The screen then went black and silence rang throughout the flat. Sherlock and Lestrade were left to stare at the screen with wide and furious eyes, Lestrade's mouth was wide open.
“Sir, there's no new information and the public wants more of it now. They want information and we're receiving hate mail and threats. Sir, are you listening? Detective Inspec-”
“Moriarty is clever. Smarter than you and your,” He scrunched up his face and pretend to squash an imaginary man in his hands, “stupid, older brother combined.”
John had always denied to being homosexual, but Irene Adler had gotten him to say he was slightly bisexual. Ever since then, she's always been smirking around John when he looked at Sherlock, even when he was talking to Sherlock.
He looked around and spotted a blonde woman sitting in the chairs that were pushed against the wall. He looked around, checking to see if anyone was coming to get her before making his way towards her.
"What do I want you to-" Sherlock now revealed his anger by gripping the file and literally tearing it open to reveal its inside contents. "Look at it, you fat idiot!"
Lestrade looked closely at the pictures, staring at their collarbone. His breath hitched and his eyes widened as he saw the faint sign on their collarbones. It was weird. Not a type of sign he's ever seen in his life.
“Your eyes…” Sherlock mumbled after a moment of silence. John, throughly confused, frowned and tilted his head to the side a little.
Sherlock took a deep breath and leaned back, standing up straight before handing the file with the information about the cashier to Lestrade. He took it and opened the file. The picture of the cashier in the footage was in it. This was the man.
Sherlock threw the box towards the kitchen and stared at the envelope. It just had Sherlock name on it written in cursive. It was an average envelope.
I'm so sorry for the delay of posting! I got caught up in a school workout program and family. But here's the next chapter. I'll try to update sooner for the next one.
"Whose flat is this, exactly?" Molly asked as she jogged up behind Sherlock. They were in the kitchen at this point and Sherlock was looking at the photos on the refrigerator. He barely glanced at her before humming in thought. He was clearly annoyed.
“Dylan Landon, I suppose you show me what I you know what I'm talking about.” Sherlock said calmly at him as he started to cower back.
“I checked after I found it in the bag at the labs. Molly doesn’t know yet, I haven’t told her and she herself said they had just gotten the bag to examine yesterday. Molly, being as considerate as she is, told me I could check the bag first before anyone else does. I did and found this,” Sherlock mentioned to the bag. “And found out it was John’s hair.”
"That one. The rest are irrelevant." Sherlock jabbed at the photo of the blonde and swiped the rest off the desk, where they landed sprawled out on the floor.
“Little brother.” He said with a smile as he made his way to sit in John's seat. He looked around and slightly grimaced from the sight before looking at his younger brother.
The table in front of him used to be a pale blinding white, but was soon replaced with brown, dried up blood. His head hung from his neck and his shoulders were tight and hunched. He no longer had shoes and his trousers and shirt was pure white, well used to be pure white, but now it stained with brown and dark red spots.
Sherlock watched, filled with anger, as the cashier looked around the store. He slowly backed up as he kept glancing around, before he put his hand on the door and pushed it open, dashing into the night. The bag was with him and it was droopy and the cashier looked like he had a hard time carrying it on his shoulder.
He courted me, not in any standard sense, but in his own unique manner. For he had changed, too. The man he had been would have demanded my presence, expected it with a cool confidence if not regarded it as a certainty. The man he was after his return respected my losses, recognized and acknowledged his part in them, and regretted both that and his loss of me – the loss of the relationship we had shared, the loss of trust. He hoped for better, he wanted to repair our friendship at the very least, but he also knew that his wanting alone could not make it so. His efforts – and there were many – were necessary but could not be sufficient in and of themselves.
“We’ve got them all,” Lestrade tells me with satisfied good cheer when I rejoin him. “And most of them will live to hang. I don’t understand why they kept Clemens’ dead body with them, though. From the looks of him, he’s been dead some days now.”
The urge to drink blood is instinctive for our condition. Watson should latch on and feed regardless of his lack of awareness. Yet the first brush of the wound to Watson’s lips provokes no response. Neither does the second. I feel the first stirrings of true fear as I raise the unconscious man’s bleeding arm to Watson’s mouth for the third time. How dire is his condition if he does not, cannot drink…?
and the dead body drops to the ground, discarded. One of the criminals has been killed attempting to escape – not that Lestrade’s men know that, for he gets right back up and legs it with much more vigor than the living man had previously shown. I have my hands full both trying to keep Lestrade and his men ignorant of the spirit’s existence and in bringing down and excising the wretched thing while keeping them safe.
How do you learn to trust when trust has been repeatedly abused and then shattered? Understanding his reasons for his choices (and he did have them, and some of them were very good ones) was insufficient medicine. Understanding that he, too, had suffered, and suffered badly, aroused my sympathy but did not assuage my wounds.
I had never seen it, not until that moment. I, the second-most gifted observer in London, the foremost investigator of my time, had missed all clues to Watson’s feelings for me.
I cannot stop the snarl that escapes me, but I am as careful and gentle as possible as I remove the knife. The wound it leaves is bright red and bleeding for only a few moments before it closes over, already starting to heal. That is a good sign.  It is normal for us as we are now. But Watson does not immediately wake from his stupor, and that is a bad sign indeed. It suggests that it was either not the knife, or the knife already delivered the poison or whatever it is that continues to hold power over him. I carefully pocket the knife for later examination, if needed.
Dame Patience’s gaze sharpens.  “I see. That might be something I can test, to help rule out a few things.”
In the ordinary course of events I would find this mildly concerning.  Watson is punctual down to the bone. It is part of his nature.  The habits learned in medical school and the army only confirmed the trait in him. But under these circumstances I find it even more disturbing, for this is no ordinary day. We are on the brink of bringing an end to the Loper gang and its reign of terror. Lestrade and his men are even now positioning themselves for the raid that should net us the ringleaders – and not so incidentally strike another blow to Moriarty’s remaining organization. Watson should be here by my side, ready to help our police allies and hunt down any
need to be as well as knowing where to send wounded for additional care if he himself couldn’t provide it. It was something he’d done in numerous raids before this, and the police appreciated his efforts now far more than they’d done in the beginning. But no coordination efforts, no matter how intricate, should have delayed him much at all. Nothing should have been able to delay him. Yet he is not here.
Watson’s mental voice is full of concern, but also a trace of ironic awareness that he should need to minister to me thusly, given my previous statements about being a rational thinking machine.
I have long been aware that Watson is modest by nature and prone to downplaying his own sterling qualities. It has led him to overlooking some of his natural advantages in the past, but I have rarely if ever heard him utter such nonsense as he speaks now.  “It would be as accurate to say that if you weren’t so extraordinarily gifted in resisting blood thirst, you wouldn’t have been with Ancaster at all,” I point out. “Which is to say you are theorizing ahead of the facts, and without investigating all of the possibilities. It’s entirely possible neither aspect of your nature is necessarily at the root of what happened to you.”
I teased him once when he was frustrated about this, suggesting that it was merely a reflection of his essentially honest nature.  It made him laugh then, as I intended, but it is no laughing matter now.  For I sense his intent. Watson will act if the boy or Ancaster are threatened with imminent danger, regardless of any potential witnesses and his inability to convince them they didn’t see what they saw. The need for such a drastic action rises every moment, for there are four armed men in the room, arguing and threatening their hostages.
he knows about the kidnapping, their operations, who they have worked with, and the various crimes they are responsible for. There is no indication of a greater plot in their crimes, or any hint of Moriarty. That they succeeded as far as they did was due to luck and mischance. They never should have been able to touch Watson. I change the leader’s memory so that he only remembers a battle with his fellow criminals and send the man into unconsciousness with a single well-placed blow. I am finally free to rush to Watson’s side.
I can feel where Watson is, but translating that into intelligible and navigable directions for a London cabbie takes all the encyclopedic knowledge I have of London’s streets.
What is often overlooked is that spring, too, is a season of change. Landscapes transform, just as they do in autumn, even if it is in reverse. The days lengthen, the weather warms. A season of growth, of awakening. Summer and winter too hold change, not as dramatic as the other two seasons, but no season is truly static or without change.
We cannot speak to each other as Watson and I can, with our minds meeting and hearing each other’s thoughts. But Mycroft and I devised our own silent means of communication when we were boys, and we use it to this day.
Was Watson’s love for me real, or simply a reflection of my own feelings brought to life by the very contagion that had preserved his existence?
I slip past the guard at the door and race unnoticed up the stairs. There are many closed doors in the dingy hallway, but I know which one stands between me and Watson. If I strike it with my full strength, it will fly into pieces and be difficult to explain even with my mesmeric powers to help confuse the issue. I restrain myself and use a fraction of my strength to send it flying open with a crash.
His eyes are open, but there is no recognition in them, no sense, and he does not respond to my hand or my voice. His mind is unreachable, pain forming an impenetrable shield to any thought. He is pale and clammy. A large knife juts out from Watson’s shoulder, driven in halfway from the force of the blow. It would be a grave wound before his change, but he and I have both been ‘injured’ far more severely since the transformation that made us what we are, and we both recovered swiftly enough. If he were still human, I would say he is in shock. I don’t know if we can suffer shock now, although what I recall of the backlash of killing Moran could be construed as such.
Watson nods and toys with his teacup while Dame Patience busies herself with the rest of the bottles. Fortunately for Mrs Hudson’s china, it isn’t long before she puts down the last vial, closes her pocketwatch-like device, and sits back in her chair with a sigh. “Thank you for your patience,” she says. “To answer your very natural question first, Doctor Watson, ‘twiceborn’ is an informal term in my community for those who have ceased to live, however briefly, at some point in their lives. It is extremely uncommon, but I am sure you can recall from your own medical studies the occasional unusual case. The man who was taken intact but dead from a railway crash, only to revive twenty minutes later lying on the green with the bodies of other victims laid out all around him.  The woman who fainted and fell down a flight of stairs, was taken up as dead, only to awaken when her laces were cut.  The guardsman who took a bayonet through his side protecting his Prince from an assassination attempt, and who somehow lived despite being pronounced dead initially at the scene, with the volume of blood suggesting he had lost more than half of what should have been in his body…”
Lestrade huffs but looks pleased. “Still, I’d like to know how he died. Can Doctor Watson have a look - ” The inspector stops, chagrin mixed with faint concern marring his features. “My apologies. I’m so used to your working together, I forgot he wasn’t with us. I suppose he must have had a patient who needed his attention. I can’t imagine what else would have delayed him so.”
“I am sorry to raise such tragic memories.” There is sympathy in her voice along with a tone that suggests she understands something about living through a horrible situation. “And it might not have been then. It could have been an accident or an episode when you were a child, or at any other time of your life. But the twiceborn who died of wounds are often unusually sensitive or even vulnerable at the site of the original fatal injuries.” She shrugs. “So if that was the cause of your first death, it might explain why you were so severely affected today. Moreover, it almost certainly explains why you are alive at all to be so affected.”
Her startled laugh cuts off the remainder of Watson’s objection. “My apologies, Doctor; I did not mean examine you in the medical sense. I mean to examine your condition, which only requires you to sit quietly in a chair and let me look at you with the assistance of a few of my own tools. You will not need to disrobe, and I will not need to touch you at all, save perhaps once or twice on the forehead. You need not fear any improprieties.” Her amusement fades as she looks from Watson to me. “Which is not to say that I won’t ask questions, and that some of them may feel deeply personal in nature. I cannot compel you to answer, or to honesty, but understand that I only ask in order to try and help you as best as I can.  And like you, I respect the privacy of my patients. Anything you tell me, as well as anything I learn about you, will be held in the strictest confidence.”
“No, but it was in the same place of a different injury earlier in my life. The knife happened to hit the site of my old bullet-wound. That bullet shattered my shoulder and ended my Army career, and my shoulder and arm have never been the same. I suppose it is only logical that it remains a point of weakness.”
We were very happy for a time. Yet Holmes’ loss changed me, grieved me, in ways that even the joy of Mary’s love and the arrival of our son could not touch. I had loved Holmes, and I had failed him, and I could not forget.
My wish for an opponent is granted, but not my wish for a quick resolution to the raid. There is a malign spirit-beast possessing the already-dead body of one of the gang. I chase it and very nearly have it cornered when it
Change can come in any season, as can pain. It was summer when the bullet found me at the battle of Maiwand. In one moment I went from being a surgeon to being a casualty.
Mary and I married in autumn, but that following spring saw no promise of new life. We both grieved, but as a doctor, I knew that many an early pregnancy failed to thrive, and that it was not her fault. Nor was it a sign that we could not have children, just that this one, who had scarcely even started to make its presence felt, was not to be. I made sure she knew this, and the private loss – for I told no one, and if she spoke of it to anyone, I never knew it – wrought its own painful alchemy and brought us even closer.
Sherlock breathed in deeply and held it for a second before letting it out, his and Mycroft's eyes never breaking apart.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and looked at the paper. He looked up back at Lestrade and gave a nod before turning and walking away.
Lestrade walked towards his car, giving a random policeman his now empty coffee cup as he walked. He cursed under his breath and grumbled insults as he got it and turned the car on and left the scene. He clutched his steering wheel tightly and thought of how Harriet’s reaction would’ve been when she saw John for the first time in months. She probably would’ve hugged the soul out of him.She probably would’ve cried and smiled, she could’ve walked away.
To my surprise, Watson blushes furiously. “Even if that is so, Dame Patience, you are still a woman, and it would hardly be appropriate for you to - ”
Dame Patience turns to my friend, who looks rather uncomfortable at the attention. “I have not been…afflicted very long,” he says. “It seems likely it is my own inexperience, and my resulting deficiencies when it comes to being what we are, that caused the problem.”
I can hide our presence from passersby, but I cannot do so and flag down a cab. I make my way through the streets as swiftly as I can. Those around us still see
Ordinary or not, it cannot be doing Watson any good lodged in his shoulder. I pull on a glove to shield my skin in case there is some kind of enchantment (for lack of any better word) or poison.  I rip away the clothes around the wound, the better to see what damage there is and avoid making it worse when I remove the blade.
“That is one variable,” Dame Patience agrees. “Evidence suggests that successful infection is much more likely when the subject is twiceborn. There also seems to be some correlation between being twiceborn and being less affected by the subservience that can come from being changed. That might help explain why you retained your independence from the one who infected you instead of being enslaved, or at the very least put severely under his control.”
It was not perfect. No relationship ever is. We loved each other, but that did not make us immune to hurting each other through miscommunication, accident, or even habit.  We learned from our mistakes and kept changing, largely for the better.
Dame Patience makes a noncommittal noise. “Do you find that you can persuade others more easily than you did before?”
That night’s confrontation ended in shout-ruined voices, at least one shattered glass, and tears – mine and his. Yet somehow we were both the better for it, and things began to change in a more positive way.
She monitors the jars closely, consulting a pocketwatch-sized object frequently as she does so. A casual observer might think it was a pocketwatch, but I see enough of the face to discern multiple dials and tiny levers on the sides of the case. Whatever the device is, it is not simply for timekeeping. I watch closely as her gaze moves between the jars, the device, and Watson, but her expression gives nothing away until one of the squares in a jar turns a vivid, iridescent blue, like an exotic butterfly’s wing. At that, her eyebrows shoot up, and she sits back in her chair with a huff.
“No, but it is an interesting place to start,” Dame Patience says calmly.  “Please, Doctor Watson. Could you tell me about your change, what you perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, and then allow me to examine you? I assure you I am in my own way as sworn to medicine, and to do no harm, as you are yourself.”
So we will leave London and start life again somewhere else, somewhere in the countryside. I do not know what that life will bring, except that it will be full of changes. Holmes and I will navigate them together.  I can only hope we will be as ultimately fortunate in our future circumstances as we have been in our renewed life together.
“I beg your pardon?” Watson’s confused question echoes my own failure to understand the correlation.
If Watson looked uncomfortable before, he is positively embarrassed now. “I, um, seem to lack at least one of the abilities inherent to those those with my condition,” he says at last. “If I had been able to mesmerize the men who held young Ancaster hostage when they approached us, as Holmes easily could have done, none of this would have happened.” He starts to shrug, then winces and made a dismissive gesture with one hand. “It seems likely that my episode is related to my weakness.”
where Watson is, but translating that into intelligible and navigable directions for a London cabbie takes all the encyclopedic knowledge I have of London’s streets. It would be even more of a challenge if Watson was moving, but fortunately he remains a fixed point, a lodestar shining in my mind as a single star does in an otherwise shrouded sky.
Now we must move forward, for Baker Street will no longer be our home. We could undoubtedly buy it from Mrs Hudson’s heirs, but she was as much a part of our home as the walls, and the surest ally and buttress towards our safety as we could ever have wished for. She knew about us, and approved, and made sure our secrets remained ours. She treated us as beloved sons. I thought of her as a second mother, and Holmes, whose own mother had died young, treasured her all the more. She was an essential part of our home, a fundamental part, and neither Holmes nor I feel we can remain here without her.
Dame Patience brightens, and she and Watson quickly fall into a consultation of sorts, full of suggestions and resources. I listen with only half an ear. My gaze fixes on Mycroft, and as always, he senses my attention. His placid gaze meets mine with just a trace of a question in their depths.
I shrug and give Lestrade a smile slightly tinged with mockery. “Weren’t you complaining just last week that I needed to leave Yard business to the Yard? This seems an excellent time to test out that request. But if you find yourself in over your head, you can always send a wire.”
“Would you like the use of my burner? I have an excellent one on my chemical bench,” I ask when I realize she is using the candle to heat some of the jars.
The seasons flew by, as seasons will, particularly with a young child. He changed every day. Yet seasons can be cruel. Death is a constant foe for a doctor, wily and often inevitable; a change that we all must face. The autumn of 1893 saw me laid low by an influenza I had been fighting in many of my patients. Out of an abundance of caution, Mary and I agreed that it would be best if she took Arthur and went to stay with friends until I was well again and the risk of contagion was past.
It would be so easy to slide into madness. To kill, to destroy everyone and everything that stands between us. That I do not is somewhat due to my own self-control, and somewhat more knowing that Watson himself would cry out against it, if he could. And he still lives; I know that to my core. Whatever has happened to him, it has not been fatal. I must get to him – but first I must make sure we are safe.
I want to ask so many questions – what does she know, how did she come to know it, is it really an affliction when it grants so many benefits – but I suppress them all. Watson’s health is the most important investigation. “I count us fortunate in having someone to consult with your expertise. We would appreciate any insights you might be able to provide as to why my friend experienced what he did.”
I tried that experiment once. I was happy, and I certainly can never regret my Mary. I loved her with all my heart. And in loving her, I not only realized I loved Holmes, but that he might have loved me too, despite the tepid nature of our affair even at its height.
He stayed behind with two of Lestrade’s constables to learn where and when they planned to bring in the police surgeon and the wagon.  Knowing where medical help would be meant Watson knew where he
Even if he were nearby, I could not read his thoughts unless he allowed it. He has learned enough to shield himself, as I learned before him. At this distance we cannot speak mind to mind unless we both concentrate on that and nothing else. When we do that, it appears that we have fallen into a trance or a doze, depending on whether we leave our eyes open. It is not a distraction I can afford with a raid about to start and with Lestrade nearby.  Even if I were safely at Baker Street, I would hesitate to attempt it, for fear that I might distract Watson at a critical juncture. For he is in danger, I am nearly certain of it.
I can’t let that happen. I won’t leave Lestrade undefended. I must go on the raid. It is the only logical answer, but that does not stop me from wanting nothing more than to race away and go to Watson’s aid. The knowledge that I cannot – and that Watson himself would be furious if I did – does nothing to sweeten my temper.
I lean back against the alley wall and keep my eyes focused on the dilapidated building that holds our quarry. I know I look intent, but in truth my eyes see very little. My focus turns elsewhere, inwards and outwards both, along the bond between myself and Watson.
Sometimes I cannot help wondering if he valued me a little more, saw me as my own person a little more, after Mary came into our lives. But then I cannot help wondering if I became my own man a little more because of Mary, too. With hindsight, I think both ideas might have some truth to them.
I can both see and sense the moment Mycroft’s words resonate with Watson. His whole demeanor brightens as he considers the possibilities. “I had not thought of that, but I can see the application, and you’re right that it presents far fewer ethical dilemmas. And while I am not gifted in disguise, I am considered a fairly good storyteller. Perhaps if I think of things in that light, I might make more progress. Thank you. Thank you both.”
Finally yelling some of my truth at him one night in my otherwise empty home, and seeing him stricken silent and pale, did purge some of the poison.
Glancing at the clock, Sherlock calculated that it would be a little under an hour before John woke from another nightmare. Quickly making his decision, Sherlock grabbed his phone, sent a text and after tossing the phone on the sofa, gently pushed John away from the table and placed an arm across is shoulder and slowly lifted he unconscious being from the chair and carried him bridal style into his bedroom.
John never felt uncomfortable or squeamish around dead bodies at crime scenes-he’d seen hundreds of bodies both in his university years and in the army, but that didn’t mean he found the murder acceptable or morally upstanding in any way. He knew he openly showed his sympathy for the family and the victim and disgust in particularly gruesome murders, but never really cared, much to his flat mate’s annoyance.
After finally collecting enough data to evidence that the suspect was indeed the murderer, Sherlock headed back to Baker Street, absent-mindedly noting that it was a little over one.
“John, what happened couldn’t be stopped by anyone, so stop blaming yourself. You were thirteen when your father came into the house in liquid courage and killed your mother. Do you really think you could’ve stopped him? And then your best friend in the army was shot by a sniper during an ambush. And you think you could’ve saved him if he were with you? How could you guarantee that you wouldn’t die if it were you in that position? If you died that day, I wouldn’t have made it this far. You are the bravest, kindest, and wisest human being I had ever the good fortune of knowing. So I’m glad you didn’t die because John Watson, you keep me right,”
Sherlock quickly, but gently lifted John’s head off his shoulder and helped the doctor out of the car.
Sherlock, who was now fully awake, simply stated, “You fell asleep while I was gone and seeing that you haven’t slept because of your nightmare in over a week, I brought you to my room since having someone sleep with you is the most effective method to help nightmare and my bed is bigger than yours.”
His head snapped back and his body followed suit. Blood running down his face and creating a red spot where it touched the collar of his shirt. His eyes open but unaware if his surroundings; unseeing. The blood still pumping from the bullet wound on his-
After about an hour, John felt the tension ease from his hand and his muscles relax. When Sherlock was satisfied that John’s hand did not carry its former agitation, he dried John’s hand with the towel and smiled at his own achievement of doing something for John.
‘What had caused this reaction from John? Obviously something in the crime scene definitely triggered something he had nearly forgotten, but what? But more importantly, how do you help someone in this state?’
“John?” Sherlock said cautiously, as he approached and lowered himself in front the of the doctor slowly, not wanting to throw John into a panic.
But John was already in the room, desperately looking around for something, anything, to reassure him that nothing was wrong and Harry was playing him like she always did. However, his eyes landed on the hunched figure of the forty-five-year-old Hamish Watson who had disappeared two years ago, holding a gun with and equally bloodied hand as Harry, while the other clutched a bottle of whisky, wearing a slightly confused and bewildered expression on his face.
John woke first and noticed immediately that the duvet was too soft to be his. Then he registered that an arm was protectively wrapped around him while his hand was being held by another. He puller back slightly and nearly gasped aloud when he saw he was only mere inches from Sherlock’s face. John noted that in his sleep, Sherlock looked years younger and so peaceful. A look that contrasted drastically with this usual cynical expression.
Sherlock brought the older man in an embrace as John quietly shed his tears, sobs racking his form and dampening the top of Sherlock’s shirt.
To this John said nothing but simply bent his head and played with the end of his shirt. Sherlock tucked his index finger under John’s chin and lifted it up so that the stormy, ocean bleu eyes met with the calm, ash grey ones.
John sighed. He’d had a long day in the hospital and just wanted a cuppa and some biscuits to make it all better. He supposed that would have to wait.
So Sherlock picked up his violin and plucked the highest string. If John was to roam the deepest and darkest parts of his mind tonight, at least he wouldn’t have to be alone.
And the screaming. Screaming for fellow soldiers and those screaming in pain. He sees himself dash between soldier to soldier, trying to bandage the wounds as efficiently as possible and repeating words of encouragement and consolations to those young men who are so new to was and bloodshed.
“S-sorry. I just…I don’t know. My hand tremor’s back.” John said looking up from his lap where he had balled his hands into fists in an attempt to stop the tremor.
Once he was inside, Sherlock placed John on the bed, trying his best not to wake the doctor, who seemed to be fast asleep, and his nightmares not yet disturbing the peaceful slumber. Quickly getting dressed into his pajamas, Sherlock slipped in next to John and shut his eyes and for the first time in a long time, allowed himself to sleep with the comfort that he would be there when John wakes from his nightmares.
Sherlock let out and exasperated sigh but did as he was told, while John never let go of the hand holding the wrist.
As he hid between cracks in the wall, facing the direction the heavily armed but clueless other side was supposed to come, he tightened his grip on his weapon. After a while, voices talking in Pashto could be heard coming towards the direction where a unit of 80 soldiers were hiding and waiting. But as the opposite troop began to come to sight, John realized with horror that there were more soldiers than they had anticipated. He gave the ‘stay-where-you-are’ signal and hoped the other side would pass without noticing them.
“Clearly you’re not. You are hyperventilating, your heart rate is much faster than normal, your hands are cold and clammy, you’re starting to sweat and you are shaking all over. If I didn’t know better, I would say you are having a panic attack. But the most probably explanation is that you’re having a PTSD episode or had a flashback which triggered something causing you to act irrationally. But you’ve never had an episode during a crime scene much more grotesque than this one. So why now?”
Eleven-year-old John nodded happily. With their father gone John and Harry could now live like actual children in the house without being beaten up.
But when Murray had broken cover during an ambush to help a fellow soldier, John had lost it. As much as Bill mattered to him, John had the rest of his unit to care for and a failed ambush like that could’ve cost their lives. John did notice the soldier laying down, blood pouring out of his side and his face contorted into an expression of severe pain but more of fear. In his years in the army, John ad seen men like him. Those terrified of dying alone and the sickening realization that they might never see their families again, or share a drink with a mate. John longed to help the fallen soldier, but when face with the decision of choosing one man’s life over a whole unit, John knew where he stood.
“Jesus, Sherlock. The poor man’s clearly not feeling well and you go off ranting about why he has a panic attack. Give him a break. And what’s this about PTSD episodes?” Lestrade replied disbelievingly still crouched next to the oblivious doctor.
“Christ, Sherlock. I could’ve punched you in my sleep if you tried to touch me or something. I know I didn’t” John quickly added as Sherlock opened his mouth to object, “but I could’ve.”
John’s eyes then drifted to the shape on the floor and all the air in the room seemed to have vanished as he identified the source of blood.
Sherlock immediately pranced around the body firing deductions before everyone was even in the room.
After a moment of stunned paralysis, John melted into the kiss and couldn’t help but notice how perfectly his top lip fitted to Sherlock’s philtrum. He felt Sherlock smile against the kiss as his hand tangled itself in the dark curls and couldn’t help but feel complete. Just a little bit.
“We don’t have time John!” Sherlock whined impatiently and sprinted by himself in the general direction of the murder.
“John, honey. Your father is gone and I don’t think he’s coming back. But, I know you are strong so you, Harry and I are going to get through this together. Okay?”
After a few days, John stopped sleeping altogether to escape his nightmares. He would sit at the kitchen table typing away at his blog, occasionally rubbing his face to will away the tiredness and to make himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock looked down at the pair of sapphire blue yes looking into his grey ones with such admiration and affection that for the first time, he thanked the universe for granting him John Watson.
“Shit Sherlock!” John nothing but jumped out of bed, breaking the embrace without even noticing. “I had a meeting! Sarah’s going to bloody kill me this time.”
John clutched the body of his friend, begging him not be dead, ignoring his rational side of telling him to help others who could be saved.
John was taken aback by the sudden emotional outburst from Sherlock and the overwhelming pleasure of feeling loved-platoniacally or romantically-whatever they were.
“It was the bodyguard Lestrade.” Sherlock huffed impatiently, his attention already focusing on the small huddled figure on the floor. “It’s so obvious even Anderson could’ve solved it. Sometimes I wonder how you ever got your qualification.
“You’re late.” The detective stated without looking up from his phone, texting someone at an unnatural speed.
Sherlock looked up from his rant to see a concerned Lestrade crouched next to a very pale and very hyperventilating army doctor who had managed to sit on the floor with his head between his knees.
Soon, all the soldiers were caught in a fierce battle-those who lost their weapons fighting with fists wile snipers were taking down soldiers at an alarming rate.
Although Sherlock wore a cold expression, his mind was in a tumult of emotion and incomplete trains of thoughts.
At exactly 2:07am, Sherlock heard a breathless cry followed by harsh breathing from the room upstairs and the silent creaking of the floorboards as John dutifully got out of bed. He turned on the kettle and prepared a cup of tea just as John emerged from the doorway, rubbing his face in an attempt to chase away his tiredness.
He sat next to John, spread the towel across his thighs, placed the basin on it then reached over and gently picked up John’s hand from where it was tightly clenched on his lap and pried off his fingers. As the fist loosened, the tremor became more obvious but Sherlock continued to straighten the fingers until John’s palm was completely resting on Sherlock’s. Sherlock then submerged John’s shaking hand onto the warm water and began working at the knots in the hand. Once, a particularly violent jerk sent water flying out and John muttered and embarrassed, ‘sorry’.
After what felt like hours, they finally reached the actual crime scene where Lestrade was talking to Sally Donovan bout something irrelevant to the case but as soon as he spotted them, waved and moved towards them.
To this Sherlock got no reply save for the sporadically tapping keys. Sighing exaggeratedly, Sherlock headed out to spy on the newest suspect while mentally checking off the list of do’s and don’ts to help deal with PTSD nightmares. The most effective –and obvious- method was to have someone sleep with them like a teddy bear. Sherlock snorted at the thought of John sleeping with a teddy bear but also knew John was too stubborn and ‘not-gay’ to ever share a bed with Sherlock Holmes.
“James Hosea Symth. Aged thirty-seven, height 176 centimeters, high class business  man with some corruption scandals, heavy drinker, divorced twice, had a lover, just came back from Manhattan after a… business meeting? No. Conference, Owns two dogs-a golen retriever and a –”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and said, “My body is used to the staying awake day, even weeks, on end. Frankly, you’re not and you need to sleep if you are to assist me usefully on cases.”
Then it would be Sherlock’s turn to roll his eyes and reply, “Well, it’s not my fault that these so-called investigators have the mental capacity of a gold fish.”
John sighed tiredly and followed the detective mumbling ‘sorry’, ‘excuse me’ and other various apologetic phrases as the detective barged through the crowd, muttering words like ‘stupid’, ‘idiot’ and ‘unbelievable’.
Once both Sherlock and John made it to their falt, Sherlock seated John on his chair and quickly went to make tea. Milk and no sugar, Just how John liked it. When he gave John the cup of tea, most of it spilled out as John’s hand was now shaking as well. He quickly retrieved the cup before John manages to break it and set it next to the skull.
John stopped fighting against the arm that clearly wasn’t going to let go but chuckled nervously and asked, “Ho-how exactly did I get here?”
“N-nothing t-t-to w-worry ab-about. The doctor stammered, his words barely coherent above his heavy breathing. “I-I’m fine.”
Sherlock pouted and curled in on himself at the sudden loss of heat as John scrambled out of his room to call Sarah.
He took a long look after the lanky detective before he set off. And by the time he reached the crime scene, he was out of breath and quickly losing his temper.
For all Watson’s extraordinary restraint when it comes to blood, and his rapid mastery of other aspects of his altered being, he has lagged in one area: mesmerism. He cannot influence other minds yet, not as I and other so-called vampires can.
I need to speak to him. I need his guidance, and even more than that, if I am to truly resolve the remainder of doubt that lurks in my mind. He is, as always, entirely willing to help me. I am to come to him at any time.
“Excuse me, but what does ‘twiceborn’ mean, and what exactly does it explain?” Watson’s voice and demeanor are as polite as he nearly always is, but I can sense the confused tension underlying his manners.
Wry amusement enlivens her face, erasing some fine lines and deepening others. “The only order in which women are regularly invested as well as men, of course: The Order of the Pelican and Pearl. Which you will not have heard of, almost certainly, but there are many things not commonly known that exist nonetheless. Your own condition is one of those things, as you know. I am something of an expert on some of these unusual conditions, yours in particular, although I do not share the affliction.”
He is not nearby. It only takes the faintest brushing of my mind against his to know that he is some distance away, and that something is very wrong. He is on high alert. There is danger.
“Months, not weeks, and I am still learning my own limits,” I admit frankly. “I mastered the basics of mesmerism fairly early, but my hunger was far more difficult for me to learn to control. I could not have been in the presence of wounded and bleeding people without severe danger to them and to myself in the first six or eight weeks, I’m sure. Watson managed the trick almost instantly. And I could not compel another to sleep, or to forget something entirely, until almost three months had passed.”
Much to my surprise, it’s Mycroft who answers. “Doctor Watson only survived being shot by Moriarty’s henchman because you infected him, Sherlock. But you shouldn’t have been able to do it.” He rests his large head on one massive hand, staring at me steadily in both speculation and reassurance. “You’re extraordinarily gifted for being such a young vampire, with excellent control. Some of that is undoubtedly due to your strength of will, and some of it is likely because Moran’s infection line is known to be a very strong one that produces powerful results. But there are no known cases of anyone as new to their state as you are successfully infecting another, not in all the years of records I have seen. It usually takes at least a decade before a vampire can do so, and it’s very rare that a first attempt succeeds. Yet somehow Doctor Watson was changed, and thereby saved,
I studied Holmes from where I sat leaned back on my armchair, not really bothering to hide it. We, that is, he, had just solved a case in a way that ended most happily for all relevant parties, and in the euphoria of it I had no energy for subterfuge. Besides, I had learned quickly in this past half-year with Sherlock Holmes that I was never as subtle as I thought. Sometimes he was kind enough to let me live my fantasy. Other times he was bored, or irritable, or injected with his seven percent solution, and he was not so kind.
Slowly, carefully I crawled towards the opening, and looked out. Empty. Of course, there could still be stragglers, scouts, but I found I did not care.
works, and rarely rests. «How did the Rowe case confirm it? I hardly spoke with them more than you.»
Yet… yet, yet, yet. As I have said, most of us inverts have a knack for recognising each other. There’s a hidden language, of sorts, a code of looks, way of holding ourselves, certain articles of clothing worn in a certain way. With Holmes I had never observed any of these signs. He was adept at hiding himself, it was true, both physically and emotionally, but I could not help but think we would have seen each other had he shown the signs. That was before my confession, however. He did not show any of the traditional signs, of someone consciously signalling a potential like-mind, but there was something in his changed behaviour my mind insisted on attributing to… flirting, to put it plainly.
He didn’t answer, but for a short nod. I sat back down, suddenly exhausted in body and mind. It had taken more from me than I expected, this confession. But I felt lighter, and it was a good exhaustion, like after a thrilling chase of a suspect. We both enjoyed the silence for some time, him smoking, me with my eyes closed. After some minutes I heard rustling, and saw him take out his violin. While he prepared his instrument, he talked. «Have you ever wished for a situation like the Rowes, Watson?»
Holmes’s expression relaxed from its intensity, and he sat back on the sofa, contemplating my words. I took a sip of my drink, expecting my nerves to fail me but finding them curiously steadfast.
«And… and cartes. From cazzo.» I trusted his knowledge of Italian was good enough to tell him what that meant. Good lord, that a medical doctor should be so affected by the subject matter he could not even utter the word penis? It was a perfectly professional word when discussing the human body in a scientific matter. Yet here I was, tongue-tied.
— Gethin translated it as sex change.» I gave a small laugh as I said it, the medical man in me amused by the notion. Holmes did not share in my amusement. There was a tightness around his eyes, which killed any amusement I felt.
At this he sat up, ears perked. I hid my smile in the cup, pleased whenever I managed to excite Holmes. «A sailor I knew many years ago once tried to teach me Polari. Do you know it?»
Polari is/was a real code language, many of the individual words are still in usage! Holmes is wrong that it's a thieves' language - many people from boaters on the Thames, sailors, fishmongers, etc used it. Nearly all of the words I use here I pulled from wikipedia, so:
Watson brought his hand - the hand that had just seconds, centuries ago, caressed this dear, beautiful, infuriating man's cheek - he brought his hand to cover his face, and sank slowly down on the couch. He sat there, in a parody of the way he sat when he finally asked Holmes the question he had been burning with for the better part of three weeks: elbows on knees, head in his right hand, left hand hanging between his legs. He didn't move until his stomach reminded him that Mrs. Hudson was away visiting relatives and they had not been getting their regular dinner.
By the staircase, Holmes came to a halt. He kept his back to Watson. "You must see how much easier, how much better it would be if I just. Went back. Lived my life as my mother wished, as surely Mycroft does although he never says as much." He spun around, and his expression was such a frightening mix of naked emotion - fear, frustration, confusion, fear, fear
"John." It was choked, and Holmes turned his head into Watson's palm, raising his own hands to hold it in place while he kissed it, ever so gently.
I squeezed my eyes shut. No longer could I hear anyone passing, a roaring sound in my ears too loud. In a desperate bid to stay silent I sucked in a breath of air and held it. When my lungs were burning — I had no way of telling how much time had passed, as it seemed to simultaneously go too slow and too fast — I pursed my lips and endeavoured to blow out the air slowly. The roaring in my ears abated. I opened my eyes. No one was near me; no one was passing the alleyway.
Holmes took in this information. He was lain out on the sofa in his housecoat and shirtsleeves, chewing on the end of one of his pipes. Not smoking it; he had told me once he did not always wished to smoke, but it helped his thinking. «I do pride myself on my camouflaging abilities, Watson.» I nodded. «It would be of immense help if I could know these codes, should I ever have need of them while in costume. I would never divulge it to anyone who would take advantage of the knowledge.»
I blushed and looked down, somewhat embarrassed. «I honestly wasn’t sure how you’d react, Holmes.» Looking up, I could see a flash of indignation on his face. «You need to understand my position—»
He could sense that Holmes wanted to argue, wanted this over and done with and move on. As easily as Watson could sense Holmes agitation in the sitting room, however, Holmes could also sense Watson's determination now. Watson could see it when Holmes decided to stay quiet and started cutting into the fish.
- that Watson could not help the small noise and half-stumble forward he made, hand reaching for his friend. "I could never let you live in constant danger of the law, John. It claws at me, every day, and every day I expect you to look at me and propose the most difficult thing I would have to do."
"That was a highly unreasonable jump you asked me to do, only to catch the wrong criminal." Watson was reluctant to break their touching, but he had to in order to get up from his kneeling with minimal protesting from his limbs - only to have his hand grabbed as soon as it was free. He looked down, and his breath nearly caught in his chest. Holmes lifted the hand to him, and reverently kissed his knuckles, while looking up at Watson through disheveled bangs.
"No, no it does not. It makes the least amount of sense I have ever heard you uttered. Don't you see?" His hand hovered, his left one, and Holmes moved his head minutely, allowed for skin contact even as they both started when they touched. Neither drew away.
This silenced him. Curiously, it seemed like this had not even occurred to him as a possibility. I stood up to refill our glasses, having difficulty retaining eye-contact while talking about this. «Until the Rowe case, until I saw the tact you conducted yourself with around them, without a hint of personal disgust, I had always had a nibbling doubt that I could lose your friendship.» I handed him his glass again, which he accepted but made no move to drink from. Straightening my back, I looked him in the eyes once again, only a few inches between us. «Some men are of the opinion that inverts cannot be friends with their own sex without… carnal intentions. I would hate to lose your friendship now, Holmes.»
He will overcome this, whatever this is, but he will need strength. He will be better for having blood, as will I. I choose the most robust of the unconscious criminals in the room and gash his arm with his own blade while planting the memory of receiving the wound in a fight with his fellows. I feed lightly from him myself, making sure there is nothing more objectionable in his blood than the blankness of unconsciousness. Only when I am sure of it do I coax the man’s gashed arm to Watson’s lips.
“I am as strong as Holmes, I believe, but Holmes is somewhat quicker. This was true before our changes, too. Holmes does not get nearly as hungry as I do, but again, his appetite has always been slight. I do seem to find the smell of blood less of an incitement than others do, or so Holmes tells me, but he too does not let it distract him from his purpose. As a doctor I naturally had a great deal of experience with blood, so perhaps I am just inured to it. Holmes can compel others to believe what he wants them to believe and tell him what he wants to know. I cannot do that at all. The best I can do is to encourage them not to notice me, and even that only when I concentrate. I was too startled to think of doing so when those two louts approached Ancaster, or I might have been able to conceal myself and follow them in hopes of an opportunity to ambush them without endangering Ancaster or his son. But even that would have been chancy and risked raising questions and doubts that I cannot wipe away, as Holmes can do.”
The shock of their loss sent me into a full relapse. For days my life was despaired of, but my neighbor Doctor Spenser, my old friend Doctor Anstruther, the specialist Mycroft sent, and the regiment of skilled nurses they brought in their wake, all combined forces and refused to let me die.
I duck into a convenient alley and set Watson on his feet. His eyes are open and focused on my face with a look of complete bewilderment.
I manage to flag down a cab in a matter of moments, and the remainder of the journey back to Baker Street is blessedly normal. Mrs Hudson hears our return and is swift to send up a pot of tea and a plate of biscuits. I use the distraction of Mrs Hudson chatting with Watson to hastily scribble a telegram for Mycroft and send it on its way to the telegraph office by way of one of the Irregulars lurking near our front door. I am still somewhat frustrated with my brother for never telling me what he knew about all the mysteries he clearly knew about, including wards and the condition commonly called vampirism. He never would have said anything had I not been attacked and been infected by it. Had he done so, I might have been able to keep myself safe – or I might have fallen sooner. We will never know. He still has not shared why or how he knows what he does. But he is my brother, and even if he did not care deeply for me, he knows how much Watson means to me. He is also the best source of knowledge I have about our condition, outside of the observations and experiments I have conducted on myself. He is more likely to know what might have affected Watson so, or know how to discover it if he does not know.
