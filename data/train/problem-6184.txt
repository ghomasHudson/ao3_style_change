This went on and on until Steve took a pebbled nipple into his mouth and Tony’s only reaction was an involuntary ripple of his abs. Then he reached for Tony’s other nipple and rolled it between his fingers, watching Tony’s cock twitch with a spurt of precome pooling onto his stomach. But he was otherwise still and silent just as Steve wanted him to be.
"I want you to call someone to come be with me if you ever have to leave like that again. Someone who will understand and keep me from the worst while you're gone."
Comforted by Bucky’s soft words and the hand that continued to pet him, Tony rolled onto his side facing Bucky. He was starting to come back to himself enough to recognize what was happening. “S-subdrop. When it’s really good or intense- and it was tonight- when you come down from it, when it’s over, it makes you feel like shit. Steve- he’s coming back right? He didn’t really leave me?”
There was a long moment before she answered, “No. But you left him when he needed you. He doesn’t need you now.”
Tony slipped out of the room and let the door close behind him. He padded barefoot down the hall towards the common room with the jar he held hidden by the sleeve of Steve's too-big shirt. He was so lost in his thoughts as he crossed the room that he didn’t see Steve there until he walked right into his broad chest. He let out a yelp as he stumbled back, but Steve’s arms wrapped around him before he could fall and pulled him back into a tight, almost desperate embrace.
“God, Buck, you think I don’t know? I’m not blind. I saw what- I didn’t know. I should have known what could happen, but I didn’t think. I’m sorry, god, I’m so sorry.” Steve looked at Bucky, silently pleading for understanding, his blue eyes glistening with unshed tears. He loved Tony more than he could express and he hated that he’d done this to him. Of course, he hadn’t meant for it to happen, but Tony had put a great deal of trust in him, and he had failed in keeping that trust.
He looked down and his voice was barely a whisper when he continued.  "I wanted to die, Steve. I thought it would hurt less. Please, if you say it'll never happen again, then it doesn't cost anything but a few minutes time to make a plan we'll never need to use."
Tony gazed at Steve, eyes already a little glassy. He opened his mouth to answer but snapped it shut before any sound came out and nodded instead. Steve hummed in approval and slid a hand up under Tony's shirt to rub a thumb over one of his nipples.
But part of wondered if he should have let Steve take his place and just spent the rest of the night on the couch. Tony belonged to Steve after all. Was he really going to be okay waking up next to Bucky in the morning? Or was Bucky just so starved for affection that he was using this as an excuse to take it where he could? Maybe he was being selfish and was no better than Steve had been, taking advantage of Tony’s compromised state of mind?
"I need you to relax sweetheart. You're so tense, you’re going to hurt yourself. You're doing so good for me,Tony. Just relax now and let me take care of you."
“I’m not sure where he went, but I promise he’s coming back soon. Now, what’s the best thing for me to do? Do ya need something I can getcha?” Tony shifted uncomfortably and shrugged as he looked away from Bucky. It seemed clear that there
“Shhh, sweetheart, stay quiet now,” Steve murmured against his lips as he laid him out on the couch.
“Stevie, what you and Tony do- I don’t exactly understand it, but I get that it works for you both and I ain’t judging. I did a bunch of reading tonight so I’d know what to do for him. This subdrop? It’s serious, you asshole. People have killed themselves.” Bucky folded his arms across his chest as he glared at Steve. “I'm not saying that Tony was
He set the water bottle on the table by the bed, and gave Tony a quick wipe down, shifting him away from the spot where his cooling release now stained the sheets. He didn’t have time to change them, but figured it would hold until he got back. He dropped the cloth to the floor and knelt beside the bed.
“Alright, Doll, don’t you worry about it, we’ll find another bed for you tonight.” Bucky turned around and left the room, this time heading straight for his own bedroom. It was only moments before he was pulling back his heavy, weighted comforter and laying Tony down on his slightly fuzzy, flannel sheets. But Tony let out a hiss of pain as he touched the bed, and Bucky quickly knelt beside the bed to be on eye level with him.
He didn’t remember the ride back to the tower. He was sure he must have broken every traffic law on the books, but he didn’t care. His only reassurance was that Bucky was obviously with Tony. He would be taking care of him. Of course, that also burned, because Tony was
“Tony. Can you tell me what’s wrong? Are you hurt?” Bucky’s experience was enough that he had an idea, at least in general, of what went on between Tony and Steve. But he didn’t have first hand experience taking care of someone afterward like this, so he was mostly playing it by ear, and trusting his instincts and Tony’s cues to let him know what he needed to do.
Tony hesitated, but eventually nodded and then shyly turned his face into the pillow. Bucky was again surprised by his actions. In the time he'd known the man, he had
Steve noticed Bucky’s tablet resting beside him, still glowing softly in the dark room. He couldn’t have asleep for too long if the screen was still lit. Steve stepped softly into the room and picked it up to set on the bedside table. But he froze when he saw the jar of cream he kept for Tony for after. He realized quickly that Bucky must have used it, which meant Bucky had his hands on Tony’s bare ass, had
Steve winced at the justified anger in Bucky’s voice and he withdrew from the room. Pausing  outside the doorway, Steve stood in the hallway and watched as Bucky gently shifted Tony so he could get up, carefully standing, and trying not to wake him. Even so, Tony stirred, and made a sound of  protest when Bucky moved away. Bucky leaned down and kissed his temple, smoothing a hand through his hair.
"No, Snowflake," he replied with a raised eyebrow, "It's not what teammates do. But-" he hesitated and took a deep breath before he continued. "Maybe it's what friends do?"
Through it all he kept quiet and still despite every part of his mind screaming for him to twist and squirm and push himself harder into Steve’s hands. It seemed like Steve could still sense his inner turmoil, however, because he just kept stroking his hands slowly over Tony’s body, and talking soothingly in his ear, voice low and deep.
“He was in no state to make that call, Rogers,” she interrupted him harshly. “You should have known better. You should have stayed.”
“I know that up here.” Tony tapped his head the paused and laid his hand over his heart. “But it feels different here.” He looked at Steve and could see the frustration on his face. “Hey, sweetheart, I’m not trying to blame you. I just need to know that it won’t happen again. I need to be able to trust you.”
With that, Steve ran his fingers through the puddle of precome that had gathered on Tony’s navel and wrapped a hand around his cock, forgoing the light teasing touches to grasp him firmly around the base. Tony’s mouth fell open, but he held back his moan, and his hips quivered, but he didn’t move and Steve hummed in approval and began to stroke, slowly at first, but quickly picking up speed.
Tony stared into the room, eyes fixed on the place where he had collapsed the night before. He couldn't make himself step any further into the room. So he turned to face Steve, eyes wide, trembling as he pushed past him away from the kitchen.
“Sergeant.” Friday’s voice sounded quiet but urgent in the large, empty room. “Boss is becoming restless in his sleep.”
Bucky was still asleep, looking young, peaceful, like he didn't have a care in the world. Nothing at all like his usual glowering self. As Tony watched him sleep, memories from the previous night began to filter back.
“He has his reasons,” Tony said, his mouth grim. He and Bruce always did have a bond above and beyond the rest of the team. Science bros, they called it. Well, Tony called it, loudly and enthusiastically. Bruce pretended to endure the nickname, but Steve hoped he enjoyed it too.
“This all started with me,” Steve said hoarsely, acid regret in his throat. “With Siberia, with me lying to you-” He broke off to steal another breath from the mask, internally cursing his every weakness, past and present.
“I couldn’t fight back, he tortured me.” Peter said and cried harder. Mark just gently set his hand on his shoulder and Peter cried for a long while. Mark just sitting there and comforting him silently.
“Yeah I’m really here. Just don’t let go of that collar I don’t want you to abandon me somewhere.” Peter said and Mark nodded hugging the collar protectively. Peter shook his head stretching his neck feeling the weird pressure around his throat again.
“He was like a father figure to me and helped hide me away, you know.” Peter said and Tony nodded resting his head on his arms.
“Mark.” Peter breathed out and rubbed his neck then got up looking for Mark. Peter shivered as he felt the hand put pressure on a certain spot rubbing it and Peter shivered trying to flinch from the hand but he couldn’t get away. He thought he told Mark to not do that!
“Get in.” Tony said pushing Peter in the bathroom and unlocking the collar around his throat then closing the door. Peter wondered if this was a good time to escape but he really wanted to shower so that’s what he did. He showered and did his business and got out drying himself off. Peter then noticed some cloths waiting for him on the counter so he put them on struggling with the stupid tie and suit. Peter gave up on the tie and just walked out of the room.
Peter sighed softly stopping somewhere in Canada. He couldn’t tell where he was but he knew he was many many miles away from Tony Stark. Peter found a little town and settled in a huge tree which was surprisingly good at giving shelter. He was a little ways from falling asleep when he heard someone call up the tree.
“I was so stupid!” Tony yelled getting in the armor and blasting the wall with the armor and it made a huge burn mark unlike when he didn’t have the armor on. Tony flew in the air clearing his head.
“Can we please just talk about this?” Steve said determinately. Steve walked into the lab as it got unlocked. Steve sighed seeing Tony working on the armor.
“Well he told us you just came out of an abuse relationship, you have nightmares, and that it was really bad.” Jared said hesitantly not trying to trigger him and Peter nodded closing in on himself.
“It’s okay Tony I understand.” Peter said crouching down to Tony’s level and looking at him in the eyes their faces just inches apart. Tony shamefully kissed Peter crying the whole time not allowing himself to feel the joy of kissing Peter. Peter kissed back gently then separated from Tony and backed up scared again.
“What Peter? Aren’t you gonna try to get out?” Tony teased and Peter took a step forward angrily and then screamed out in pain as he was electrocuted.
Ned nudged him and Peter opened his eyes snapping back from the memory and looking at Ned confused and then he realized everyone was staring at him.
“What is the meeting about?” Tony asked sitting down in a chair next to Steve. Ironman huffed biting his lip and glaring at Tony.
“Y-you know I was actually having a really good day today.” Peter said stepping away from Tony and Tony picked up his suit examining it. Peter told him how his day was and tried not to remember the last time Tony found out who he was.
“Sorry, That was awkward...” Steve apologized. “I should get back to work.” Tony said going back to work on the armor. Steve sighed knowing he messed up and grabbed his sketchbook and left.
“Well I’m just going to be here working on the armor and other things for you and the team.” Tony said and Steve nodded sitting on the couch and watching him.
“You’ll be alright, it will get better.” Jensen reassured him and Peter nodded smiling at him. Jensen stood up and began to leave and Peter called out to him.
“You know what will happen if you escape and I’m willing to bet you don’t want that to happen again.” Ironman taunted and Peter nodded letting Ironman do whatever he wanted with him.
“I am don’t worry.” Tony said flinching at the sound of Ironman’s voice. Steve frown only deepened not liking what he was seeing. Steve quickly jumped to the conclusion that Ironman wasn’t treating Tony right and Tony needed saving.
“Why don’t you want anyone to touch the inside of the collar?” Jensen holding it normally, his hands wrapping around the inside of the collar letting it rest in his hand and Peter tried not to react as he felt Jensen’s fingers around his throat.
“Because Mr. Stark it reminds me you are not the Tony who hurt me.” Peter said and Tony eyes widened.
“I’m sorry I just wanted to know who he was.” Steve said trying to defend himself just a little bit.
“Oh no.” Tony panicked slightly. Steve was asleep, Steve was kissing Tony in his sleep. Tony concluded quickly as Steve just brought Tony closer kissing his neck softly and Tony shivered blushing. Tony almost yelled out as Steve bit him thrusting up into Tony surprising him.
“Yes but I haven’t died yet and I like being Ironman... please don’t kick me off the team.” Tony pleaded.
“Yes I need help catching Steve I just want to stop him from tearing the Avengers apart.” Tony said and Peter nodded.
“Okay I’ll go.” Peter said and Ned celebrated. Peter dreaded going but he was Spider-Man he could do this and he needed to be there for Ned, also Tony in his past life didn’t die yet so there was no reason this Tony would be anything like his last mentor, Peter concluded trying to calm himself and hoping that was true.
“Yeah he is just knocked out.” Peter confirmed tugging at the collar again wanting it off. Peter then noticed the police come in and cuff Tony.
“Okay.” Tony said and then went into the code and removed any other embarrassing titles and changed them. Peter chuckled seeing what Tony was doing and Tony felt embarrassed and ashamed but just kept what he was doing.
“So is that a yes? Or...” Steve trailed off blushing also embarrassed that he even asked in the first place.
“Tin can.” Peter said trying to anger Tony to get him to stop. Tony got angrier and punched Peter in the ribs shutting him up and shocked him again. Peter screamed out in pain gritting his teeth as Tony kept shocking him.
Peter shook his head out of the memory and then sighed as they started going over the rules. They all got off the bus and went into Stark Industries Peter only feeling a little intimidated by the building.
“Yeah that would be great.” Peter said and stood up as Mark started walking out of the room. Peter was quick to follow him.
Mark left looking at Peter one last time before leaving to go home to sleep and eat. Peter tried so hard to call out to Mark to tell him that he was there that he wanted to wake up but his body wasn’t cooperating. Peter didn’t know how long it was until someone visited him again.
“We are the same person though and we wouldn’t mind some company.” Tony and Ironman said at the same time thinking together.
“I need to see if he put a tracker in me.” Peter said and started heading for the door and Jensen quickly cleaned up and followed him.
“Hey! Stay away from my kid!” Robert yelled blocking Tony’s path and bringing Tom behind him protectively. Tom was flustered and peeked at Tony from behind Robert.
Peter returned to Avengers Tower as Spider-Man and just perched on the rails of the roof looking out at all the city.
“There was this guy who looked like you who abused me.” Peter said and Tony nodded silently urging him to continue.
“Sir, may I recommend going back to the lab?” JARVIS asked and Tony nodded going back to the lab and taking the armor off. Tony cried and then heard a knock on the door.
“Fine.” Jensen said accidentally leaving Peter’s collar behind. Peter turned to follow Jensen then he heard a whisper.
“I had a bad dream. It was about my crazy ex coming after me.” Mark said opening up to Peter and Peter nodded relating to him slightly.
“I was going to draw Ironman but it kinda turned into you and I just, thought you would be a good reference since the armor seems to fit on you and then I-.”
“Y-you were adopted?” Tony said confused remembering the file on Peter and how his real parents died and was living with his aunt May.
“He took me away from them and killed them.” Peter said tearing up knowing that they might as well be dead because none of the cast in this new life even knew he existed.
“The important part is you got out. You’re safe now.” Jensen tried reassuring him and Peter nodded looking to Jensen crying now.
“It’s okay you are safe now he can’t hurt you anymore.” Jensen said comfortingly and Peter nodded trying to calm down.
“Yeah you didn’t think I wouldn’t be able to use these as a light source?” Ironman asked pointing to his eyes.
Tony sighed angrily calming down the flames in his eyes going out and his palm returning back to its regular color. It wasn’t fair but he had to live with it.
“I’m sorry Ironman I thought that...” Pepper said starting to leave but Ironman caught her by the wrist.
“Tony...” Steve said but after a tense silence let Tony go and Tony turned away covering his eyes with his hand just in case and running to his lab only peaking slightly so he knew where he was going. Tony put his lab on lockdown and sighed relived. Tony put on his sunglasses letting them cool his now burning eyes.
“You never told me about your family... what were they like?” Tony asked and Peter sighed smiling as Jensen and Jared played Sam and Dean.
“That’s not an answer.” Tony said huffing frustrated. Peter smiled and they made sandwiches eating together peacefully talking about Peter’s work Spider-Manning and what Tony was doing as Ironman and lots of other random stuff.
“Hey I can tell them to back off, I’m sure we can find someway to make them leave you alone.” Tony said protectively.
“Let me have the collar.” Mark pleaded and Misha sighed handing it over. Mark held onto the collar carefully not letting it go. Peter sighed shaking his head the constant pressure around his throat feeling weird.
“I said get off of me tin can.” Peter said getting closer to Tony, still glaring at him. Tony got off of him, grabbing his shirt and leaving. The panel closed again leaving Peter alone in the dark and Peter sighed.
“Okay time for plan B.” Tony said and Peter looked at him puzzled before he screamed in pain as Tony hit a button electrocuting Peter for a few seconds.
“That was a college level question Mr. Parker I’m impressed.” Tony said and Peter looked at the ground refusing to look at Tony.
“We salt and burned his bones.” Jensen said too stubborn to think that the collar was keeping him here.
What he didn’t expect was for a suit in the vents to follow him and Peter sped away crawling as fast as possible out of there. Peter webbed the vent behind him making the suit slow down and Peter rejoiced as it worked and he quickly went up to the roof escaping through the air ducts.
“Don’t try to escape.” Tony said and Peter looked around more carefully. There was a invisible barrier probably electrical Peter then noticed Tony putting something around his throat.
“You know that’s not what I was asking.” Tony said and Peter sighed closing his eyes and remembering what happened in his past life then opened them flinching at the face of Tony angry. Peter looked to Tony and sighed sadly.
“Yes.” Ironman said truthfully. ‘Don’t sell me out or anything.’ Tony said smiling mentally. Ironman chuckled.
“Okay I will go meet him when I can.” Tony said trying not to laugh and then let his eyes return to their normal state.
Tony knew Steve loved Ironman but he could never return those feelings. Tony sighed pained his eyes lighting up glowing brightly and Tony threw his sunglasses across the room angrily. Tony repulser blasted the wall the blast coming from his bare hand. The blast left a small burn mark but didn’t do much damage.
“No, Steve, I can’t. Not right now, not after last night.” Tony shook his head, trying to clear the worst of the memories away. He wanted to talk, not get lost in a flashback.
Bucky waved off his explanation. “I know, it was all over the news. And I'm sure Tony will understand when he sees it in the morning. But you never shoulda left him like that. Alone, sleeping on dirty sheets, with a water bottle left like an afterthought? It's not good enough and you’re supposed to know that.”
Tony let out a choked sob as his thoughts continued to spiral downward. All he could think was that he’d done
Tony took a deep breath then blew it out, letting his body relax so he could just enjoy the feel of Steve’s hands moving over his body. He felt them move across his stomach, up his arms and over his shoulders, down his hips and back up his thighs with fingers trailing along the inside still without touching his cock at all.
“Are you saying you don’t trust me?” Steve’s eyebrows shot up at that and his voice was incredulous.
It was her perfume that woke him, gentle, safe. Tony rolled his head to where he knew she’d be, instinct strong as any sunflower. He felt a cool hand touch his face, and he was smiling before he opened his eyes.
From the set of his shoulders to the clench of his jaw, Steve was radiating upset all the way across the camp, and Tony stifled the urge to drop everything and rush over. It was his turn to wash the day’s dishes - a job that required a full decontamination procedure here in this alien biosphere, just in case - and Steve would be the first to scold him for not finishing his share of the chores. Tony let himself hurry, but by the time the last dish was through the steamer and properly stowed, the super-soldier was busy chopping firewood, which was Steve for “my muscles need to yell now”. There was an upside to this being Steve’s favorite coping mechanism, as the nights on this particular continent got bitterly cold; despite the apparent absence of any defensive surveillance from Thanos, they were trying to keep their use of tech to a minimum, but everyone agreed a good old-fashioned campfire would pose little risk of detection. If every campsite in the past eight weeks had had a woodpile that tended towards excessive, then no one was about to complain.
Once Tony was settled, Steve dared to look around. Clint was still sitting at the deserted table, staring at the wall. Nat was pacing back and forth near the door, fists clenching, then releasing. Bruce was standing nearby with his eyes closed, muttering fervently. Sam and Bucky both stood back, upset but discreet. Rhodey-
And at that precise moment, his empty stomach gurgled like a chorus of operatic frogs, and Steve fell into a fit of giggles.
“-whoever made these rules deserves to have them broken, there has to be another way-” behind him, he heard Steve cut off, then- “Tony? What the hell are you-”
“Sorceress,” the Mad Titan said quietly. “Enough delay. Is the choice made?” Steve exchanged a long, suspicious glance with Tony over Thanos’ defeated demeanor, and they both turned to watch him closely.
May crossed her arms. “You know that’s not how it works, Tony. Happy told me you were poisoned, that there was permanent damage. You shouldn’t have been drinking at all.”
The guy on the gate was getting fired. “I… What a surprise,” Tony said, forcing enthusiasm. “I’ve missed you so much.”
The problems ease. Sleep, orders the Queen. The Captain lies where they put him, stares at the ceiling until they get him. More team. Thor’s not eating. The Captain speaks, and problems ease. His throat bleeds, but the serum. Problems ease. He stares, where they put him. They get him. He speaks.
“Even in defeat, you defy the inevitable,” Thanos said. “Your spirit is impressive, Stark. I believe I will remember you fondly. As a reward for your courage, I will not draw unnecessary blood through the mechanisms of armies and war. No, your planet’s balancing will be clean and merciful, in your honor. This is my final gift to you.” Tony stared up at him, still struggling to catch a breath, never mind respond.
So naturally, nothing happened. They landed safely on the surface without detection, Nebula dropping the ship to the ground without even a bump, and the absence of interference did nothing to ease Steve’s nerves.
“Not even close,” Steve murmured. It was only the truth. And kinda for the best, or he thought he’d do nothing else all day.
The other man turned his gaze towards the tycoon; the shift in his expression made Tony shiver, just a little.
“We’ll give you a minute,” Tony heard May murmur, then the others left so it was just him and Steve. There was no one else left in the world but him and Steve, eyes locked, hearts racing.
His fevered words made no sense, but they were out of time, and Tony gripped Steve’s hand closer, his own voice cracking with fatigue. “Steve, sweetheart, you need to let the doctors help you, okay? I promise I’ll be right here with you, the whole time. I won’t leave.”
“Gotcha, Brucie bear,” Tony said, and ended the call. For the second time that day he stared at the little icon on his display, this time marveling at how, despite his utmost pessimism, life could always get worse. Then he clapped his hands and stepped up to address the crowd. And, by proxy, the entire watching world.
Steve slowly approached the groaning man, now bleeding heavily from his broken nose. “Hi,” he said softly, then reached down and grabbed Ty by his injured arm, hauling the tycoon effortlessly to his feet.
Steve wasn’t totally inexperienced; he knew enough to get himself off with minimum fuss, had even sat through a few awkward hand-jobs back in his USO days.
. Moving in slow, wretched pulses, Steve worked Tony’s cock with his mouth, his ass with his fingers, advancing then retreating, one then the other, the steady momentum pushing and pulling Tony someplace beyond thought, beyond words; at last, Steve swallowed him full, slipped two spit-slicked fingers deep, and commanded Tony’s soul to explode from his body.
“Wow, dude,” an unfamiliar voice spoke up from nearby, startling them both. “Remind me to cross you off my Christmas list.” Tony craned his neck as Thanos swiveled round to face the newcomer. The glowing blonde woman stared back, unimpressed.
That had never been unusual for routine Avengers meetings, and these past two years Stark’s absence was almost expected. Yet nothing about today’s meeting was routine.
Tony has to clear his throat before speaking. “For what it’s worth,” he says, “I’m really glad you did.”
Tony’s pulse hammered a drumbeat the whole way to the car, which Tiberius had parked in the most sheltered corner of the lot. The bigger man was always keen to avoid scrutiny, but the Compound was a bad place for that. Windows everywhere, by design.
Without missing a beat, the kid slowed his words to something more befitting a stoned whale. “I s-a-i-d oh-my-g-o-d-To-n-yyy, d-i-d-youu…”
Nebula took a deep breath, then reached out with the Gauntlet and picked up the blue Space Stone, careful not to touch any of the others. After a few seconds of no reaction, she transferred it to her bare left hand, then quickly brought the Stone towards the nodes on the Gauntlet’s smooth surface. The Space Stone snapped itself into place and Nebula cried out as an eerie blue light pulsed underneath her skin. It increased to an unbearable brightness, but right when Tony started to worry, the glow settled, and the android was left standing, the Space Stone safely installed on the Gauntlet. Easy breezy.
Steve cleared his throat gently. “I can still go in alone,” he offered. “He hates me, it should be enough of a distraction.”
Tony looked up to the torment above, studied the cracked destruction slowly seeping to each corner of the sky. Steve thought it was every bit as ugly as the intent that had created it.
The restored light throughout the cockpit was bright enough to make Steve’s eyes water, the front view revealing only swathes of anonymous green against the deep blue of sea and sky. Steve noted the subtropical look of the vegetation, but apart from that, they could be anywhere. With a few deft gestures, Tony disabled the autopilot and spun the jet to land on a well-concealed beach. The other man unbuckled his harness and stomped out of the cockpit without a word, operating the armor with far less than his usual grace.
After Strange asked the doctors about a billion rapid-fire questions, he’d conferred with Wong before confirming that yes, he believed he could help. Using the Time Stone, there should be a way to place Steve into a timeless state, giving Tony and the others time to recreate the serum.
“If I’d known, I could have done something, Steve,” he said instead. “At the very least, been less of a dick.”
It could have been much worse; given his lack of real injuries, Tony knew his earlier collapse was both melodramatic and pathetic. Pity from his colleagues would have been humiliating. Wong was also present, face gloomy as ever under a rather fetching head bandage, and the small group soon got Tony up to speed on recent events.
Tony squeezed his eyes closed. “Jesus, Steve, for once can you just-” He broke off, and Steve realized the other man was shaking.
He froze when he saw someone had left a cup of fresh coffee by his seat as he slept. A simple, once-familiar gesture. Luckily, everyone else still seemed fully absorbed in their conversations, and soon the lump in Tony's throat eased enough that he could drink.
“Sure, cool, just following orders. Cool cool cool. So fun fact, did you know that after Thanos got the Soul Stone, he managed to get his great purple paws on the whole Infinity set, and then he wiped out half of all life in the universe? Earth included, by the by.” The Nazi swung around to look at Tony again. It was hard to read a skull’s expression, but that may have been surprise on his lack-of-face.
The sight of Steve in the bed hit Tony like a repulsor blast to the gut. The heavy shadows under the man’s eyes were the only real hint his face allowed of the massive trauma he had suffered. It would be so easy to pretend Steve was just sleeping. But beneath the sheets and tubes his body looked… frail. Incomplete. Not
Tony sent mental apologies towards his friends, knowing the rumor would be all over the papers in the morning. Yet he’d rather be indiscreet than risk Ty taking against Bruce. “Never quite got started before he left, but I’d put money on it still.”
Steve walked to him, ready to withstand the scrutiny. Yet Tony turned his gaze to the kitchen instead, lingering on the dishes Steve had carefully washed and replaced.
“They’re not gone forever.” Again, Tony had forgotten to soften the words - even hope could wound - but Steve just nodded.
“Are you Gamora?” Tony asked, sounding startled. The girl nodded, wide eyed, as Steve prepared for the inevitable fight - no weapons, the Captain noted - but as Tony began to activate the suit, the nanobots crawled over their joined hands to cover Steve too, which would be something, the Captain agreed. Yet as Thanos strode towards them, a flare of white light dazzled them all, then faded.
, stop. We have to talk first." Steve finally let him go with a sigh and a last kiss pressed against his forehead. Tony gave him a smile and reached for his hand as they walked towards the kitchen.
Tony’s cheeks flushed pink and he turned his face away as he mumbled, “Just sore. Steve- we- he...spanked me.”
"Well, how about thanks, then? Pretty sure I owe some of those at least. You- you didn't have to do what you did."
Steve walked slowly around him, fingertips trailed a burning path across his abdomen until he stood directly behind him. He wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned in the nuzzle the sensitive spot where his neck and shoulder met.
"Thanks again. I guess I should go find Steve." He stopped, practically wringing his hands, an echo of last night's fears in his eyes. "He- he came back, right?"
"No." Steve's objection was flat and unyielding. "I'm sorry, but no. I'm not comfortable having one of your exes that intimately involved in our relationship. Hard limit."
"I- yeah, that'd be nice." Bucky smiled softly at Tony, no sign of his usual teasing smirk. Tony was starting to equate that smirk to his own press smile, and found that he much preferred the real thing.
“God, I love you.” Steve leaned in for one last kiss, a sweet brush of their lips together and Tony smiled as he pulled back.
"Okay, that's kinda hot in the middle of sex, but you don't own me. Still, I'm not asking you to share me. That's not really my thing either. I just want to know that there's someone I can trust to call if I drop like that again and you can't be here."
He returned the smile and stood, wincing a little at the soreness he felt. It was something he usually valued the morning after, enjoying the reminder of what only Steve had ever really been able to do for him, but this time, it was clouded by the memories of the drop instead and he wasn't enjoying it nearly as much. He collected the jar of ointment from the bedside table, and fought the blush he felt trying to rise.
“Listen, I saw the news. I’m glad you were there to help that kid, I really am. I just- I can’t go through that again. I- There’s still a voice in my head whispering that you left me because I wasn’t good enough. Even knowing all that I know, I can’t make it stop.”
if he ever found himself in that situation again, and he realized it wasn't a bad thought. Bucky had been kind, careful, and entirely understanding. He had taken care of him in every possible way without taking any advantage or crossing any lines. Tony had felt safe with him.
He heard the pair of text alerts, one after the other, when they sounded, but ignored them; his focus entirely on the situation at hand. It wasn’t until he finally made his way back to his bike with dawn starting to pink the sky that he remembered to check his phone. He felt the blood drain from his face as he saw the text and photo from Bucky. The time stamp confirmed they had been sent hours ago, and he felt a moment’s panic as he took in Tony’s obvious distress.
Tony remembered telling him to go, but everything after that got fuzzy. Something happened in the kitchen. He remembered crying on the floor. Then Bucky was there, carrying him to bed. He blushed as he remembered the cream, then blushed some more as he remembered making Bucky promise to be there when he woke up. God, the man must think he was crazy, or weak, or a freak. Or some combination of the three.
Eventually, his own thoughts quieted and he stayed where he was. If he was wrong, Tony would make that clear in the morning, and he’d apologize to both of them for overstepping. For now, he’d let himself be a little selfish.
“Friday, what were Tony and Steve doing before Steve left?” He had his suspicions, but wanted confirmation.
The elevator room the upper floors was far to slow for him, but still faster than even he could have run 80 flights of stairs, so he forced himself to stand still as he watched the floor numbers climb. There was no one else in the common  room so early when he finally exited the elevator, so he asked Friday, “Where is Tony?”
to be there when he woke in the morning. After a moment, Bucky huffed and brushed Steve’s hand away, but there was no rancor in the motion.
"If I have to convince you, then he's not a good choice," Steve explained with a shrug. "You asked who I would trust and I trust Bucky with everything. Plus he's already taken care of you once, so no need for any more awkward explanations. Bucky’s my choice; if you can trust him to take care of you again, then so do I."
He slipped his phone back into his pocket and reached for Tony, picking him up and cradling him easily in his arms. Tony muttered and pushed against his chest for a moment before he gave in and slumped against Bucky, resting his head on his shoulder. He sucked in a pained breath as Bucky’s grip tightened around his hips and Bucky frowned again.  Tony didn’t look or act injured; what would cause him to-
Eventually, he couldn’t stand being alone in the bed any longer and he rolled over and forced himself to stand up. He groaned loudly at his body’s protest and ran a hand down the back of his ass and thighs. His skin was hot to the touch and he was certain if he looked in the mirror, it would still be bright red, maybe even bruised here and there. It had been amazing while it was happening, but the afterglow was gone and now it just hurt. Every muscle and joint in his body felt stiff, tight, and sore. He made himself take a step, and then another.
“Boss requires assistance.” She hadn’t answered right away, and for a moment, he thought she was going to ignore him. Now he just wondered what Tony might need
Every second of it was a struggle. He wanted to moan and writhe and push himself up against Steve’s clever tongue working over his nipples. He wanted to fuck up into Steve’s fist and gain any relief for his aching cock. But if Tony moved or made a sound, which he did frequently at first, then it all stopped and Steve sat patiently waiting for Tony to settle quietly again. Once he did, Steve started all over again, driving Tony right to the edge of his orgasm and pulling back to start all over again.
known him to be shy or reserved. He was confident, almost to the point of arrogance. He filled every room he entered, despite his small stature, and most people seemed to be afraid or in awe of him. The picture in front of him now did not fit anything of what Bucky
Steve’s hands gripped Tony’s hips, tilting them up and forcing his face and shoulders to press harder down into the mattress. His hands were bound together at the small of his back and his breath came in short gasps punctuated by his shouts as Steve pounded into him over and over again. Steve slid his hands back to grip the globes of his ass, admiring the way his finger left white marks across the reddened skin that quickly filled back in with the heat of the beating he’d taken.
Steve loosened his grip on Tony and pulled back just enough to bring his hands up to gently cup his face, his thumbs drawing light circles over Tony’s cheeks. Tony’s breath hitched as he looked into Steve’s eyes. Steve leaned in and brushed his lips against Tony’s in a kiss that started chaste but soon developed into something filled with heat and passion. Tony whimpered into the kiss and tried to pull away, but Steve’s grip, gentle as it was, was firm and unyielding.
the physical evidence of all they’d done. That was supposed to be private, between him and Tony. He felt distinctly uncomfortable at the idea of Bucky- or anyone- seeing and touching Tony so intimately.  He felt his grip tighten on the tablet and forced himself to relax and set it down before he damaged it. He noticed the site Bucky had been reading as he did; a pretty reputable one for information about BDSM; the article on the screen was
And yes, I know it can be unpredictable, and it could still happen for some other reason. But is it really asking too much to want some peace of mind that
Tony quickly averted his gaze from Bucky's bare back and the single muscular thigh he could see where the sheet fell away.
“Oh shut up. You deserved that and more.” He reached his flesh hand out to pull Steve back to his feet. “I can only imagine Friday read you the riot act. I think she broke a dozen of her protocols when she called me to help him. You might wanna consider showering and doing your laundry somewhere else for a few days.” His mouth quirked into a smile for a moment as he considered the kind of payback the AI was likely to engage in, but he quickly grew serious once again.
something that you needed time to heal from so much. But Tony clearly did. He wasn’t upset that it had happened; he was upset that Steve had left so soon afterward, apparently without making certain that Tony would be okay.
As he worked, Tony became even more relaxed and pliant under his ministrations. By the time he had made his way up and over Tony’s ass, the smaller man had drifted into a light doze, breathing easily, his face turned towards Bucky and looking peaceful as he slept. With the same gentleness he’d shown the whole night, Bucky carefully pulled Tony’s sweatpants back into place and then snugged the weighted blanket up around his shoulders. He put a glass of water on the table by the bed then walked around to the other side and sat down on top of the covers. He propped his pillow up to let himself lean back against the headboard and picked up his tablet.
Tony let out one last scream as his long-delayed orgasm exploded out of him and over Steve’s hand. Steve kept stroking him as he shuddered and clenched hard around Steve who let out his own shout and came blindingly hard deep inside Tony’s velvety heat. He gave a few last thrusts as he rode out his release then leaned forward to press a kiss against the back of Tony’s neck while his hands moved to undo the ropes binding his wrists.
For a long while, nothing happened and Steve lowered himself to the floor and sat with his back to the door, waiting for Bucky or Tony to come out. He lost track of how many times he heard Tony whisper his name in that awful, heartbreaking tone that he never wanted to hear again. But eventually, Friday must have decided he’d suffered enough because the display went dark and the door finally slid open. He was on his feet and sprinting down the hallway in a flash, though he did have the presence of mind to pull himself to a stop and open the door carefully, rather than barging in full speed. Once he could see in, he stopped in shock and stared at the scene in front of him.
, his responsibility, his to take care of, and he felt the heat of shame roll through him that he had allowed this to happen.
“Love you too, babe. Now go ‘way, lemme sleep.” He snuggled down into the covers, pulling the blanket up around his shoulders.
to talk, and if Tony didn’t stop this now, they probably never would. So he lifted his hand up between them and pushed his fingers against Steve’s lips, forcing him to break the kiss.
That stung a little, as if Steve didn't trust him, but hard limits were hard limits, and Tony wasn't going to push it.
Tony drifted into sleep, warm under the covers, and still feeling the high of the scene he and Steve had just shared. There was the faintest hint of nervousness in the back of his mind as Steve left and he drifted off alone, but he was warm and comfortable, and his body was flooded with endorphins. Steve would be back soon, they would spend the rest of the night together, and everything would be fine.
“Oh baby, that’s perfect. You’re so beautiful like this, all mine to play with and so perfect for me. Just a little bit more now, sweetheart, just stay quiet a little longer.”
Tony drifted for a moment, lost in the feeling of a large hand rubbing warm circles over his back while gentle fingers ran over and over again through his hair. It would be so easy to let it go, to accept Steve’s word that it was a fluke, an accident, and really would never happen again. But he had to face the facts of their lives. They were Avengers. The fact was either one of them could get called in at any time and this could conceivably happen again at any time. If he thought about it, it was a miracle it hadn’t happened before. So he slowly extricated himself from Steve’s embrace; it was almost painful pulling away from him, but he had to do it.
"Shh, no Doll, you ain't gotta apology for nothing." Bucky interrupted him gently but firmly. He clearly wasn't going to hear any kind of apology from Tony.
And just like that, some of the tension left Tony’s body. He called Peter into the kitchen to join them for dinner and they ended up on the couch with a giant bowl of popcorn after deciding on a movie. Rhodey looked between them, amused that the kid kept a running commentary. Apparently, Tony had met his match.
“Thank you for everything,” he bowed. “Sorry, again for disturbing your home.” The fairy waved him off and Steve turned to leave, but hesitated. “What is it?”
Steve hung his head in shame. “Sorry, Tony. I didn’t mean to,” he said, putting on his best “sad puppy” face. Tony rolled his eyes and sighed. “What’s going on?”
Steve looked into Tony’s eyes, holding their gaze, hoping they wouldn’t shift away. It was like sticking your tongue on a frozen pole. It hurt, but pulling away would only be worse. “NO. No, of course not! How could you think that? Tony, I love you— I would never. I never meant for any of that to happen!”
“Nice meeting you, Captain,” he offered before turning away. He took one last sip of his drink and threw Tony a wink before walking off smugly.
*************************************************************************************************************
He had the hysterical urge to laugh, but he felt so drained. He turned to make sure Peter was unharmed.
He sighed before replying to his best friend. “One, I won’t be alone. Peter is coming with me. I’m mentoring him. It’ll be like summer camp. Two, you’ll know where I am and you can always visit or call me if there’s an emergency or when you just miss my sultry voice.” The sergeant couldn’t stop his face from splitting into a fond grin. He had a soft spot for the dumb genius. “You sure you know what you’re doing, Tones?” Tony looked up at him and Rhodey saw fierce determination in his eyes.
Dean smiled and held out his hand. Steve shook it and tried to muster a semblance of a polite smile. “Cap, Dean Winchester. He’s here all the way from Kansas.”
The boy’s eyes were misty and Tony couldn’t argue that his own were dry. He didn’t know what to say. Normally, he was the uncaring playboy, at least according to the media, and that was usually people’s first impression. They always assumed the worst, without really getting to know him, not that he opened up easily. Still, people seemed to come to the conclusion that he wasn’t worth the trouble.
*************************************************************************************************************
In that moment, just like all the other times he had Tony’s back, he know the billionaire would be okay. If Tony needed this, he supported it. Who would have ever pictured the playboy as a father figure. He smiled reassuringly, with a teasing glint in his eye. “Okay. You’re crazy, but okay. And Tones? You’ll make a great dad.” Tony rolled his eyes and barked out a small laugh. “Ha, I’m no father. More like a fun uncle who lets him pick up dates in expensive sports cars and gives him his first beer.” Rhodey raised a disapproving eyebrow, but there was mirth in his eyes. “Fine, I’ll be responsible. No sports cars,” he amended. “He can swing from his web slings, anyway.” Rhodey knew his friend always diffused serious moments with humor and saw that mentoring Peter meant more to him than he let on, but he decided to keep that to himself.
Tony often found himself imagining what it’d be like if Peter was actually his son. The kid was everything he’d be proud to have in a child. He constantly impressed him with his expansive knowledge. He also had an arsenal of pop culture references to rival Tony’s. Sometimes, Peter would allude to newer, millennial-y things and he’d be thrown for a loop.
“Kid, go upstairs. I’ll be okay, I promise,” he directed at Peter. The boy looked at him with disbelief. “Mister Stark, I don’t think that’s—
“I watched you to talk to that guy for over thirty minutes, laughed at everything he said and then he put his hand on you, and I—I couldn’t take it anymore.”
Nat, annoyed by her friend’s inability to do something about his very evident jealousy, decided to speed things along. Besides, these things bored her. Not the gadget part, just the schmoozing.
“Okay… okay, but if you need me, just call.” Peter looked between the two men one last time and headed upstairs. As soon as he was out of sight, the engineer turned back to face Steve.
“Guy’s quite the looker, huh?” Steve grunted and she took that as a cue to continue. “Can’t say I blame Stark for getting lost in those pretty green eyes. And those lashes? Oh, boy.” She smiled wickedly. “He’s all cleaned up, but you just know he works with his hands.”
The teenager looked at him, dumbstruck. His cheeks began to redden and his eyes glistened with tears that threatened to escape. Next thing he knew, Peter all but threw himself at him and enveloped him in a crushing hug accompanied by “Wow, I can’t believe it!” and “Thank you, Mister Stark! You’re the best!”
He really should have thought this through, but too late. Faster than he’d like, he found himself in front of Tony and the green-eyed Bond. “Uh, Tony, could I talk to you for a minute,” he breathed out. “Alone,” he added at Tony’s expectant look.
Tony chuckled fondly at Peter’s excitement. “What can I say? I’m the best. I even added a taser web. Karen is your suit’s AI. Like your own FRIDAY.”
“I’m fine. No pain. My PT is progressing faster than projected and the alterations you made to the suit are perfect, okay?”
Tony bit into it and closed his eyes, taking comfort in the simple pleasure, his mouth flooded with warm chocolate and sugar. Peter smiled at him blissfully. “Mr. Stark?” Tony’s eyes fluttered open and turned his head to face the kid. “What’s up, Parker?”
He had been searching the mountains for close to two weeks when he stumbled upon Tony and the other guy- well, kid. He sounded far too young. He saw the fire from a far distance, thanks to his enhanced eyes and decided to go towards it, something in his gut pushing him along. When he was close enough to hear voices, there was no mistaken Tony’s. He ran. For being known as a brilliant strategist, he sure hadn’t lived up to it just then. He didn’t know what he was going to say, only that he had to see Tony. Somehow, he didn’t think, “Hey, Tony, sorry about Siberia…Nice night we’re having” was going to cut it.
Steve couldn’t dam the tears that fell from his eyes, hot and angry tracks, tiny streams of his sins.
“We move on, Steve.” Tony was aware that was the first time he’d call the super-soldier by his first name since, well since
“Yep, you can try it out if you want.” Peter picked up the suit and headed to his room to change. “If you want to try more combinations, you should probably do it outside,” Tony advised. “Okay, Mister Stark!” God, he sounded like a dad, Tony thought. Weirdly, the thought didn’t scare him shitless.
A flash of hurt danced across Tony’s face before contorting into a mask of fury. “Tony, I didn’t mean—.”
“Pep, I was going to tell you, but I know how busy you are with SI and this was a sudden decision,” he explained. Pepper waited. “Look, I needed to get away from everything- after the fight, I was in a dark place. Dealing with the Accords shit every day was just a reminder of everything…” he trailed off, hoping Pepper would have mercy.
Sorry I've been absent these past few weeks. I was juggling too much and needed to take a step back. Mental health is important, guys! Here's this to tide you over until next update, which might be ready by the end of the week :)
“Too bad because I have backup, this time,” Tony continued, pointing to the boy who was standing at his side, almost as if he were ready to catch the other man, should he fall. “And unfortunately for you, Rhodey’s on his way, so I’m afraid you can’t kill me today.” His eyes were ice and steel. He almost preferred the frozen block he’d been encased in. “But you must know, surely, you must know that I was pulling my punches back there, in the bunker. You, on the other hand? Tell me, was it some kind of sick rush?” Tony’s words were glazed in venom, but he knew when Tony was hurt.  He was hurt. That was it, but Steve could fix it, he
The billionaire gave him a questioning look, before nodding. “Sure thing, Cap. Let me introduce you two first.”  He turned to Green Eyes and placed his hand on the man’s back. Steve clenched his fists. “Dean, this is Steve Rogers, but you know that of course.”
Steve looked to Tony, silently hoping he’d ask him to stay. But of course, he wasn’t so lucky. Beautiful, sad brown eyes looked directly into his for a moment. “You heard him. Just… leave.” God, Steve wanted to reach out and touch him, but he knew he’d be on the ground before he even tried to move his way.
“You’re doing what?!” Rhodey reacted just about the way Tony expected. “It’s temporary, Rhodey-bear. I think it’s the best option. I even planned it out. You should be proud of me!” His best friend glared, unamused. “Tones, I’m glad you’re taking a break from all this. Man, I know you need it, but is being a hermit really necessary?” Hermit was an exaggeration, the engineer thought. He wasn’t exactly going to hide away alone forever.
Steve had been 15 then. He tried to tell Bucky but he only shook his head and said Steve must have been dreaming. After a while, Steve wondered if maybe he had dreamt it all up.
The darker man was in his War Machine suit, but his faceplate was open. Steve didn’t have time to marvel at the fact he was walking again. “Unless my hearing is faulty, I heard you were asked to leave,” he snarled. He positioned himself between Steve and Tony, arms crossed, but body poised to fight. “But if you want to stay, I believe there is an entire organization who’d love to come retrieve you. Please, give me one more reason to kick your ass.”
“Nonsense. If it’s in my power to help him, why not? Tell me what you need,” the black panther said in his ever present calm demeanor.
Steve walked into T’Challa’s throne room. The king was deep in conversation with Nakia and Okoye. The trio looked up when the blonde man approached them. “Good morning, Captain. I assume you wish to speak to me.”
At that, Steve finally snapped. He huffed and put his drink down, having made up his mind. “I’ll be back,” he growled at Nat before sauntering off, toward Tony. The spy smirked, satisfied with her work. They didn’t call her Black Widow for nothing.
After lunch, they stepped down to the lab because Tony wanted to discuss upgrades to Peter’s suit. “I’ve designed up to 576 web shooter combinations,” Tony explained. Peter’s mouth fell open. Tony grinned. “You’ll have to practice every day to get the hang of them. Karen can give you a crash course.”
The fairy looked at him curiously, searching deep into his eyes. After a few long seconds, he seemed to find something because his gaze softened and took a step back. “Little guy? I know some of what that is like,” he quipped, obviously referring to his size. “Though this isn’t my only form,” he warned lightly. And even still, my powers are mighty.”
Tony sighed and shook his head, sadly. “Stop saying you’re sorry, Rogers. Just stop. You’re sorry. I’m sorry. We’re all sorry. That doesn’t change what happened and we have to accept that.”
The one silver lining of the whole mess was that Tony could at last understand where he had gone so desperately wrong. Steve would move heaven and earth for his friends, as demonstrated by the Barnes saga, but he wouldn’t so much as stop and hear Tony out; ergo, Steve had never been his friend.
But the current taut silence that lay over them was kinda killing him. Steve had never actually asked why Fury had named them the Avengers, but surely even Fury had never anticipated how truly - how
“I- I can do that.” Friday had already loaded up a restraint pattern that he could modify. Holding his breath, Tony released the nanobots in a careful spray, then watched as they encased Steve’s body in a hard-shelled cocoon, leaving only his face exposed.
He stands and plods to the window. A gleaming sports car is perched across the dirt track outside, and he freezes, then sighs. The knocking has continued unabashed, loud and annoyingly irregular, and when Steve pulls the door open, he pushes past him without a word, whipping off his sunglasses to inspect the barren room.
it now, the resource problem Thanos got so fucked up about, the answer might already be on Earth, what we’ve done with clean energy, the arc reactor, we were getting close but I think I know what to do when I get back. I mean, shit, Steve, if I can get this right it won’t just be Earth, we can bring it to space, we can help other planets, hell, maybe the whole goddamn
He surfaced slowly to find someone was combing gentle fingers through his hair, humming softly. Like he was a sick child, someone in need of comfort. People didn’t… do that. Not to Tony Stark. He automatically opened his eyes to look for witnesses, ready to tell whoever it was to back the hell off, but instead of a stranger he was stunned to see Peter’s radiant aunt leaning over him.
The knock on the door almost went unnoticed. “Um, excuse me?” One of the nurses Steve had previously terrified poked his head around the door. “Sorry to interrupt, uh, Mr Stark? There’s somebody downstairs asking for you. Tiberius Stone?”
At his name, Steve automatically looked down at the sleeping man, the sight bringing an easy smile to his face. “That’s the hope,” he said.
With every passing moment, Steve has felt the day approaching, yet when he wakes that morning, he finds he cannot breathe with the shock of it. He sits with the ache, uses every single trick he’s learned, and slowly he summons the will to rise. He makes it out of the cabin, to the spot by the large rock. By the lake.
Horrors were becoming routine, out there. The roiling death tolls once basic medical necessities like insulin and antibiotics ran out. The growing food shortages despite all efforts. The despairing aggression of the lost and the grieving. Even with the threat of international war averted, doomsday cults had sprung up seemingly overnight, matched only in number by local outbreaks of regional violence; all were fueled by the festering malignancy of old and cultivated petty tensions. Many local TV channels were still broadcasting, publishing hourly lists of names from those desperate to make contact with their loved ones after the commercial internet collapsed. The larger satellite-dependent channels had struggled to stay on the air, hit badly by the rolling blackouts as understaffed power stations went under. With most of their remaining technical staff busy with the emergency efforts, the few national channels still on the air had opted to show popular feel-good movies interspersed with only the major necessary updates, instead of their previous endless churn of news coverage. There was too much misery to report, even for them.
- one of his most important friendships beyond any hope of repair, but he had managed to save his best friend’s life. He had to remember that.
“Really? I’m not so sure,” Tony said; his voice cracked, stretched taut between want and doubt; the hope almost as wounding in presence as in absence.
“Please, call me Tiberius,” his fiancé grinned, draping his arm over Tony’s shoulders. An arm that was just a touch too heavy, but Tony knew better than to fidget. “Anthony calls me Ty, of course. Has done ever since we were kids.”
Yet by the morning Peggy had rallied, thanks to the casual miracles of modern medicine. He’d stayed with her, patient, until she woke. But she woke confused, screaming and crying at the sight of his face. She knew him, but she was too sick to understand how he was there, the stress driving her towards a likely relapse. Her nurse had ordered him to leave, so he’d fled. After, she’d gently told him not to visit again until Peggy was fully recovered and settled back at the care home. A small part of him had been glad.
It’s quiet in the lab. That’s what he notices first, when he wakes. Quiet, and calm. Not his lab. Reality arrives. Shuri. Of course. Not like the kid to miss a chance to make fun of him. He honestly fears the day she teams up with P-
Therefore once the Asgardian survivors were settled on Earth under Heimdall’s stewardship, Thor, Loki and the Valkyrie would use the Tesseract to go to Nowhere and retrieve the Reality Stone for safekeeping. The Soul Stone had been lost millennia ago, and would hopefully stay that way.
Back on Titan, Nebula had run scans on him but had refused to share the results; Tony was suddenly glad. “So, I… can’t get up yet?” he asked.
“Right here,” he heard, and Tony was there, by the glass. He hadn’t seemed this close before, he hadn’t… Steve gazed up at him, his chest heaving with wishes-
“I’m good,” Steve said. And he really was; Thanos had landed a couple of hits, but he could feel the damage healing already.
Tony turned towards them but didn’t look at either of them directly, instead stabbing a thumb at T’Challa, his voice only slightly rougher than usual. “So Prince of Purrsia here is taking Zemo to answer for the bombings, meaning you’re officially off the hook, Barnes.”
His thoughts were snagging on each other, and he realized in a soft rolling way that he was getting sleepy. Magic healing. Takes it out of you, Barnes had said. Takes out the pain, takes out the injury. But leaves the absence, Tony thought. Leaves a wrong sort of nothing. Discarded memories. Ghosts and candlelight.
Steve raised his chin. This question, he could answer. “Tony. I’m willing to admit I’ve made some mistakes lately. Bad ones. Even though I really thought I was doing the right thing, but I guess I was wrong. I just couldn’t see it on my own. So I think you’re right. The team needs oversight. Accountability. And so do I. Without the team, I don’t know how I would… I don’t think I would be able to…”
funerals, Steve. I wanted to make it stop… but they said I had to let people pay their respects. Let them see me, too. They said… it would help. But it
With a furious burst of effort, Tony opened his eyes, glared at Steve. “Don’t you dare. Right now, this is working. Without me, maybe it won’t. And we gotta get the job done, Steve. Please.” Talking took everything he had, and he felt himself lurch towards the ground, a dizzy darkness spiraling to engulf him.
Steve groans softly, earning a rich chuckle from Tony. “Yellow symbolizes friendship and affection. Green stands for perpetual renewal, blue is something extraordinary or mysterious, uh, lavender represents new or unspoken feelings. And the big white ones…”
And that was why one minute later, despite the Captain’s unease, Steve was rolling up his sleeve and letting her take his blood. Make it come to something good, he thought, as he watched the red flow through the tube. Make it something beautiful.
Confidentiality was the second issue. If they made the mission official, they would have to file reports on every step as the Accords dictated. Yet without that official support, their actions would be considered legally dubious at best, criminal at worst. The irony was not lost on Steve that Tony was asking them to break the very rules he’d once argued for. Tony neither, it seemed; he kept emphasizing that the mission was volunteer only, no hard feelings for anyone who didn’t want to participate.
She was right. She was right, but there was a fluorescent glare from the lights that was too loud to let him think so Tony tried closing his eyes but he still couldn’t think with the bright buzz in his ears, the light was ringing all the way through him and it wouldn’t let him
“Not all of them,” Tony admitted. He thought for a moment. “Not even most of them, really.” It was difficult to think about those videos as real when he had no memory attached. Technically, thanks to Ty’s chemical interventions, he hadn’t even been
Hospital logs indicate that after being placed on a ventilator, Captain Steven Grant Rogers continued to deteriorate, suffering catastrophic organ failure secondary to septic infection. The patient went into full cardiac arrest at 22:19. Despite multiple extreme measures, his heart failed to restart.
Instead, Stark had arrived a full five hours late, offering zero apologies. Wedding stuff, he’d announced breezily. As if that excused anything. His lack of shame was more horrifying than his lack of punctuality. Steve was honestly beginning to wonder if the New York team would be better off without Stark involved. The Asgardians had been granted an official settlement in Norway and landed there last night, and Thor’s team had just left for Nowhere. With only New York’s defense left to worry about, Stark really should have been more focused today, not less. There really was no excuse.
...” The super-soldier buried his face in his hands, and the small hurt part of Tony gloated at how, for once, Captain America didn’t get to be the good guy; the same ugly part of Tony welcomed every moment of Steve’s distress, thought it was the least the super-soldier deserved.
and so he freezes, just a second too long; Tony’s eyes go wider than he’s ever seen them as he and the others realize who exactly had paid the price for the future this Steve had left behind.
Yet he never reached the end of his sentence; a blonde woman wearing a plastic visor burst into the room, a phone clutched between her shoulder and her ear. She tossed a similar visor to an equally confused Tony. “Put that on,” she ordered, then turned to Steve in the bed. “Hi, Captain Rogers, I’m Doctor Palmer. I’m sorry for the rush, but on Doctor Cho’s advice we are going to move you to isolation immediately.”
The other man made that awful sound Steve had first heard in Siberia, the sob teetering halfway between laughter and despair. “I’m skipping out on the single greatest battle of our time. I know exactly what that makes me, Steve.”
“If his Majesty doesn’t mind, I’ll take the final question,” Tony drawled into the microphone, and deliberately waited for T’Challa’s nod before pointing into the eager sea of reporters. “You there, with the face. No, not you. Yes, your face.”
“Stevie, I believe that’s what the kids call a committed relationship,” Bucky said, clearly trying to bite back a grin.
Next thing Tiberius had grabbed Tony by the shoulders and shook him, hard enough to make his head snap back.
“Steve, I’m not going to argue with your reasons,” Tony said slowly. “I trust they were good. But I still wish I’d known. Honestly, for years I didn’t think you even liked me as a friend.”
When Tony sat up, Steve held his breath in anticipation, but the other man was just switching on stealth mode. The light from outside dimmed appreciably, and Tony settled back down as if to sleep. Steve felt the distance between them deepen in the silence, his hopes becoming as gray and desolate as the withered skies outside. As the empty minutes passed, he found himself sinking into an incoherent despair.
As the mansion began to burn in earnest, the two assassins made their exit, promising to meet them back at the Compound. Keenly aware of his own exhaustion, Tony called shotgun for the ride home. As Steve drove off, Tony turned for one last glimpse, seeing the first lick of flames erupt along the roof.
Privately, Tony hoped this would also buy him enough time to talk to Steve about… stuff. The super-soldier had clammed up and avoided him since Vormir, even spending last night alone, a rejection which hurt Tony more than he would have believed possible. But after his first awkward attempts to talk had been solidly rebuffed, he’d decided to give Steve space until things had settled down a bit. Hopefully he’d have figured out how to apologize by then.
He gently pulled Steve’s head up, waiting until the other man could meet his eyes. “Always ask, Steve. Please. Whatever you have to say, I promise I will always want to know.” No more hidden variables; no more isolated solutions.
Steve bit his lip. He’d really thought he was being open and honest before, but if his friends wanted more from him, then he would do better. “Tony and I… it’s complicated. There was a lot of hurt on both sides. There still is, I think. But being apart just made everything worse, and, well. Yesterday we finally had time to talk.” He took a deep breath. “And if I’m being honest, my feelings for Tony aren’t exactly new.” Only Natasha seemed totally unsurprised by his words, the others displaying various degrees of shock.
She was shaking her head. Sad. Serious. Wrong. “Just promise me that you’ll take care of him, as much as he’ll let you. He needs- he deserves that, so much. And I think it’s all he’s ever really wanted. To be cared for, to be loved. To have someone who can be there through everything, not just the good times. Someone who will always have his back. I wanted that person to be me, we both did, but it never got any easier, and I… I just can’t take the stress anymore. It still hurts to let him go -
Six blazing pillars of light surrounded them, in six familiar shades. The blue light pulsed once, and the nanobots surrounding Tony and Steve retreated, startling them both. Then the orange light flared and Peggy’s form stepped out, her disapproving glare fixed on the Titan who was now restrained mid-step by blue bands of light.
“Second,” Tony continued, “when I announce the wedding is off, you will publicly confirm it was a mutual decision, then have your jackals bury the story.”
“We’ve gone through every option,” she said, her eyes full with bitter understanding. “Tested every possibility. Dr Lewis and Dr Palmer are still searching for anything that may help. But medical interventions can only help the immune system, not replace it entirely. I’m so sorry, Steve. We can keep you comfortable, but… there’s nothing more we can do.”
Steve had turned his head and was watching Tony think, his expression tight. Tense. Waiting for the verdict, Tony thought. He took Steve’s hand in his, raised his knuckles to his lips. Devastating. Simple. True. But fuck it. “You have me now,” he said. At the very least, they would fail together.
Tony’s attempt at humor did nothing to help the tightness in Steve’s chest, the blurring of his vision. He pressed the mask over his face, took a deep breath, but the rush of air only helped clarify his understanding. “I’m sorry,” Steve said, his control crumbling under the weight of his remorse.
“He’s talking to Dr Cho,” Dr Palmer explained. “Her plane just landed so we finally got to speak with her. She’s raised some interesting concerns about your immune system’s previous dependence on the serum, so as a precaution we’re just gonna move you to isolation and minimize any unnecessary exposures until we can run some tests, okay?”
Rhodey took one long breath and put his hand on Tony’s arm, and he knew. But his friend confirmed it anyway. “Pepper’s gone. I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“More like a tube,” Dr Palmer explained. “The machine will breathe for you so your own lungs can rest. But it won’t hurt, you’ll be sedated first.”
Nausea struck, hard. Staggering outside, he puked violently into a nearby trash can, heaving until his stomach was empty. A soft-eyed nurse offered him water but he waved her away, unable to handle any kindness right now. Realizing how ludicrous he looked wrapped in his blanket, Tony summoned his sunglasses to hide what he could.
But Tony wasn’t backing away. He was studying Steve like a diagram, still with that serious expression. “It’s gonna work, Steve,” he said then, softly. “This plan or another, we’ll get the job done. And if we do go to Titan, we’ll go together. Just like I promised.”
Although come to think about it, before the serum he’d said much the same thing. Steve had always been stubborn.
Somewhere above his head, Wilson cleared his throat. “I can- I’ll call Nat,” he said. “They should know about…”
Apparently Tony was done trying, as the billionaire stepped closer still, incandescent with wrath. “But people are not
. He’d never thought of Tony like that, or any man. Admittedly, he’d rarely thought of women like that either before he’d met Peggy, but he’d been friends with Tony for
“It’s a stupid story,” Steve said sourly. “Her stupid cat tried to steal my chicken, I gave myself a concussion chasing it, the end.” But when he looked up, Tony was trying and failing to smother his laughter, and Steve thought maybe the story wasn’t so bad after all.
He could cry, but settled for a quick kiss on the super-soldier’s forehead. “I’m here, Steve,” he whispered. “It’s okay.”
“No, Tony, listen to me, that’s the absolute opposite of true,” Steve was still trying to explain as Tony deployed strategic kisses along his jawline. “You
A snort of giggles erupted from the water, and Tony rolled his eyes inside the armor. “For fuck’s sake, Steve, get outta there.”
As the portal vanished, Tony and May both collapsed into chairs, sagging against each other for support.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut against the shock on the others’ faces, their first awful glimmers of understanding. “It’s okay,” he murmured over and over into Tony’s hair. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.”
“Uh, guys?” Sometime while Steve was yelling, Sam had landed nearby. “Just got word. Wakanda’s clear. The Mind Stone is secure, but Vision’s injured.”
There was real concern in her voice. Tony felt like clawing it out of her throat. “Maybe you and your boyfriend should just mind your own goddamn business,” he snarled, imagining the two of them discussing his misery, curled up snug and precious in their own cosy lives.
Like Tony had a choice. But Steve seemed fine as they headed to the lab. The super-soldier settled in on the couch near Tony’s station and buried his nose in the eternal sea of infinite reports. Figuring Steve would prefer to work in silence, Tony dug out a pair of earphones for his usual musical accompaniment, and he was soon able to lose himself in his work. The extra time proved to be a luxury beyond measure, allowing him to explore multiple solutions for each problem instead of settling for the quickest or easiest fix. Watching his efforts blossom into useful improvements was always gratifying, but today the process soothed him to his core.
It’s neverending, Steve realizes, there is no place left for him to go but back to where he came from; he falls to his knees under the blotted sun as if to stay there til he rots, the sooner the better.
Thanos growled, unable to break free despite his prodigious strength. “Name yourself, sorceress,” he roared. “Who dares interfere?”
But what Steve was struggling with was… different. And no one, not even his friends, understood - heck, Steve didn’t think he understood - and so it wasn’t normal.
Tony groaned and stretched his arms high above his head, the knotted muscles in his upper back twinging in protest. Sitting still was the worst. Fuck mornings too. He’d actually got enough sleep for once, had woken up early with about an hour’s worth of design tweaks for the orbital landing platforms freshly baked in his head, but the rest of the day had stretched easily before him, full of promise and serenity.
Tony was the least sure of anything he’d ever been in his life. “Yeah, why not,” he said heavily. He was aware he must look pathetic, still hugging the small trashcan. Usually in these situations he’d try to look outrageously casual to compensate, but his face wasn’t cooperating right now, and, well.
May steered Tony towards the bedside chair, then draped a soft blanket over him before leaving with Doctor Palmer, the two women talking calmly as they walked away. Of course, May worked here, they knew each other. Tony huddled deeper into the blanket. The shaking was back, but he was unable to stop staring. At Steve. Not-Steve.
“All ships are approaching Wakanda,” Friday said. As predicted. Thanos was going for the Mind Stone, but this time he would take no chances. He would throw everything he had at them, try to overwhelm the Wakandan team’s defenses.
From the reddened smudges around his eyes, it was clear the other man had shed some significant tears, yet Bucky just smirked and nodded at Tony, keeping his voice low. “So. Deathbed confession?”
my next planned project will be much longer, kinda designed more like a tv show with seasons, kinda a super-queer Avengers rockband AU-but-not-really. idk. anyways it's called the DNR series, link in my profile, first teaser is already up and the first season is nearly ready to post, so if you want to follow that along, please feel free.
Once the team had reached a consensus on their next moves, they’d turned in, and this time Steve had curled around Tony for comfort; he’d held the super-soldier close until the trembling stopped, and then, probably, they’d both slept. Morning brought a strong breeze, hectic leaves, more of the same bad dream he was beginning to realize was just life now. Also low voices. Pity glances. Tony had always known he was the weak link of the team, and now everyone else knew it too. He didn’t care, and thought it a bad sign. Empty.
The billionaire scoffed. “Joke’s on the world, then.” He raised his other hand to brush at his eyes, then turned towards Steve, attempting a smile and failing miserably. “You gonna do your koala thing now or what?”
Then it was May’s turn for goodbye, the two mumbling soft words back and forth, both spilling tears, much to the kid’s embarrassment. Yet when Wilson and Strange stepped through the portal, Peter followed without looking back.
Beside the bed, Helen Cho gave him a comforting pat on the shoulder. “Just one more,” she said, her quick hands already fitting another blood vial to the freshly placed needle in his hand. Seconds later, her work was done, and she stepped back to a friendlier distance. “How are you feeling?” she asked.
“…oh yeah?” His voice sounded thick with an emotion Steve couldn’t identify, but when he looked up, Tony was smiling. “How do I know you’re not just saying that to get in my pants?” the other man teased, and Steve’s heart soared with awe at how even now, in this strange new arena of intimacy, Tony could stay so irrepressibly
After, Pepper kissed his forehead and told him she was proud of him; they sat together, then, enjoying an unfamiliar but comfortable silence, until Shuri returned and gave Tony the all clear to leave the lab. The Princess also offered him a replenished nanobots reservoir before she left, but he opted out. Not that. Not yet. Bickering pleasantly, Pepper helped him dress, the only option some soft loose Wakandan clothes that at least had a pleasing lack of itchy seams. Last time, the delay in getting back to Earth had left him with a lattice of angry tissue permanently etched into his side. This time, the wound had healed to a spooky degree, with only a faint scar marking the spot.
“Just saying, Doc, it’s all well and good you turning up for the big parades, but don’t think that’s enough to make you a fucking hero,” he sneered. “Around here, we value people who show the fuck up.” But as Barton’s gaze slid sideways in his direction, Tony realized that the archer’s venom was targeted at
And in a twisted, hollow way, Tony could almost agree. The camera had been so carefully angled, the footage so flawlessly edited, that the video had almost fooled
Tony was cursing at him now, scared fingers pressing down on the wound on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve wanted to tell him that it was fine, that if half a century of ice couldn’t do the job then a simple arrow wouldn’t kill him. Instead he watched quietly as Tony took care of him, as both the blood and the swearing slowed to a trickle and stopped.
Except on the rare occasions he was physically needed abroad, at lunch Steve would bring Tony food and another round of coffee, a trick which made the billionaire take a break for at least ten minutes, and Steve soon learned ways to steer him outside to get some fresh air at the same time. Often, if Tony was in full flow when he arrived, Steve got to hear his internal monologue out loud. It was as incomprehensible as ever - he still didn’t get what a ‘quantum’ was - but he never tired of listening to the billionaire’s quick chatter, enjoying the peek into Tony’s unfiltered mind.
White, then green, and ringing in his ears, and Steve is staggering sideways, his body and mind briefly at a loss, then slamming back into alignment with sudden clarity. He knows where he is, when he is, but still he raises his hand to his chin, feels the beard on his fingers, feels the stabbing pain of cracked ribs in his side; he laughs out loud at the gift.
His thoughts had cooled enough to let him consider the whole situation. It really was unfair of him to ask Tony to sit with him like this. Steve remembered his own ordeal all too well; how the empty hours would stretch on and on, the inescapable fear settling into his bones. The resentment he’d felt, watching his mother sink away into her pain, her silence offering no comfort. No hope.
“I… was not aware. But my purpose here is not to test the intentions of those who seek the Soul Stone. Only to guide, and inform.”
“Technically thirty-four,” Steve snapped, feeling slightly aggrieved, “and I let people get close all the time.”
Steve let the question sink through his whole body and still couldn’t find an answer. “I think…” he paused. “I guess.”
“And I shouldn’t have assumed the worst,” Steve countered, then stole a deep breath from the mask. “But if that night wasn’t supposed to be revenge… what happened?”
Then he’d gone to Siberia. Learned the truth. Lost his friend. Proved himself as unworthy as he’d always feared, all in one fell swoop. Steve had needed to shatter the arc reactor to stop him, but Tony’s heart had long since been destroyed.
The pain pierced him, pure and dreadful and forever; he crumpled forward, dizzy, but Steve’s arms gathered him up, strong and kind and sure. Tony thought he should cry, but no tears came. Instead he lay huddled against Steve, unable to stop shaking, hearing the other man’s whispered reassurances as if from a vast distance.
"Be quiet, now. Here's what's going to happen. I am going to lay you down on the couch over there and proceed to show you exactly how much I love you."
"You are going to lay there and take everything I give you because you deserve to feel good, and I know best how to make that happen. You will not move or speak or make any sound at all, unless you need to use your safeword. Do you understand?"
“Please confirm permission to activate surveillance in your bedroom, Sergeant. That is outside my normal security protocols.”
“Friday, this isn’t funny. Let me through.” His voice was low and stern when he spoke and he clearly expected the door to open immediately. When it didn’t, he continued more sharply, “Open the door, now!”
"Tryin' ta leave without sayin' goodbye, doll?" Bucky smirked at him lazily and let go of him as he stretched and then sat up himself.
Bucky smiled at the AI’s caution, and quickly gave his permission. “Yeah Fri, s’long as Tony’s in there, you can surveil to your heart’s content.”
Tony had been feeling out of sorts for days and he'd practically begged Steve to take him down and help him still his mind so he could focus on a new deal SI was trying to make. And Steve had come through in spades, giving Tony exactly what he needed. Right up until the part when he left.
With that, Steve grabbed Tony and pulled him in flush against his body, one hand gripping his hair and tugging lightly as he tipped his face up for a kiss. He broke it too soon, however, and Tony whined at the loss. Steve leaned down to nip along his jaw until his lips were by Tony's ear before he spoke.
Steve proceeded to remove Tony's clothing,  moving slowly, and kissing every inch of his skin as it was uncovered. By the time Tony was naked, he was fully hard, cock jutting up into the air and leaking drops of pre-come onto the floor. He was so tense with the effort of keeping still under Steve's mouth and hands that he was half afraid he might just fall flat on his face.
His smile vanished when Bucky saw Steve follow him out into the common room. He was on his feet and moving forward in a flash; metal fist pulled back then darting out in a vicious jab at his best friend’s jaw. Steve landed on his ass and looked up at Bucky in shock.
Tony mumbled something into the pillow that might have been acceptance, and Bucky didn’t want to take the time to make him say it again. He moved swiftly, and Friday directed him to the correct drawer once he was in Tony’s room. He spared another frown for the state of the bed, determined to have a serious discussion with Steve when he finally got back.
Steve kept soothing and caressing Tony’s body until he started to lean back against Steve’s chest. With a grin, he then bent and scooped Tony up into his arms without any warning at all. Tony yelped in surprise and Steve immediately covered Tony’s mouth with his own, swallowing the sound.
That was how Bucky found him when he walked into the kitchen a short while later. He had been in his room, staring at the blank page of his journal. He was supposed to write each day about his recovery, he memories, his likes and dislikes.
“I understand Friday. He’s gonna be just fine.” The AI gave a wordless hum in response, but didn’t say anything else. “Come on, Doll, let’s get you to bed.” Tony found enough energy to protest at that suggestion.
he need? It was easy to say he never wanted to feel like that again, but how did they prevent it? After a moment of thought, he drew in a deep breath and looked nervously at Steve.
Bucky's arms tightened around him as he moved and Tony tried to extricate himself without waking the other man. He thought it would be best to do this walk of shame without having a conversation about it, and hopefully before anyone else was awake to see him emerge from a bedroom that wasn't his. He was so focused on trying not to wake Bucky that he nearly jumped out of his skin when he spoke.
,” Steve breathed into his hair. “I’m so sorry, baby, so sorry.” He held him like that for an endless moment, one arm tight around Tony’s waist, the other hand buried in Tony’s hair, keeping his head pressed close to Steve’s chest.
Shame filled Steve again as he began to understand all the implications of what Bucky had done. He should never have been exposed to this, never had to clean up Steve’s mess, not like this. He looked back at the sleeping pair as his thoughts grew darker and suddenly the situation didn’t look quite as innocent as it had a moment ago. He pushed that thought away, though, aware that it was his own concern  and shame talking. Tony would never cheat on him, and if anything, he should feel grateful that Bucky had been here to do what needed to be done when Steve hadn’t been able to do it himself. Reassured that Tony was okay, he was about to back out of the room and let them sleep when he realized that Bucky’s eyes were open and his friend was glaring in his direction.
Today had been a rough day and he was having trouble organizing his thoughts enough to write them down. Or was it yesterday that had been rough? It was late, but he wasn’t sure just what time it was. He was still staring at the blank page when Friday’s lilting voice sounded softly in his room.
“Sergeant Barnes, would you come to the kitchen please?” Bucky glanced up curiously, wondering why she needed him in the kitchen.
“You’re exhausted, you idiot. Take a shower. Go to bed. You’ll see Tony when he wakes up, then you two can have it out.”
“So good, Tony, you’re perfect, love. So beautiful, can’t keep my hands off you. Come on, baby, just relax. Let go and I’ll take care of you, that’s all I want to do.”
“Buck, I don’t think- I need to see him now; he needs me.” Steve turned to head back towards the hallway that led to Bucky’s room where Tony was now sleeping. Bucky reacted with  lightning fast speed, grabbing his arm to stop him from heading down the hall.
Before he could say anything else, a display panel lit up on the wall in front of him and he watched a loop from one of the security videos. It showed Tony stumble into the kitchen and give up on the coffee maker. He saw him sink the floor, heard the broken whisper,
"Tony, wait-" Bucky called out to him as he opened the door to leave and Tony turned back, question on his face. Bucky handed him a tablet with a news report on it. "You should take a look at that before you talk to Steve. That's why he left last night. Not saying that makes it right, but he had a reason, and it weren't nothing to do with you."
“Boss and Captain Rogers were engaged in a private activity, Sergeant, and Boss would not like it if I gave you details.” The AI’s voice sounded prim and mildly shocked, but he knew she had no problem embarrassing Tony in other circumstances. If she was being hesitant and closed-mouthed about his sex life now, she must be truly concerned. Which was why she called him; Tony was in no shape to have done it himself.
Less than a minute had passed by the time he returned to Tony, but even in that short time, he could see the tension that had built up in Tony. He hastily returned to his spot kneeling beside the bed and found Tony’s hand with his flesh one. He gave it a light squeeze in reassurance and felt Tony relax almost instantly.
Steve’s frown deepened, deep lines of concern appearing on his forehead for a moment. He kissed Tony’s fingers before pulling his hand away
“I’m here, see, I told ya I’d be right back. Now, I need to lower your sweats to put this on, so if that’s okay, roll over on your stomach for me. If you get uncomfortable, ya just gotta say so and I’ll stop right away.” He was a little uncomfortable himself doing this when it clearly should have been Steve. But Tony was hurting and if this would help, then Tony himself was the only thing that could stop him.
“Can’t. Sheets are dirty.” Bucky frowned as he walked into Tony’s bedroom and took a closer look at the bed. A moment was all he needed to take in the stained and rumpled sheets; he knew that he couldn’t put Tony into his own bed like this, and right now he didn’t think he could even put him down long enough to take care of it .
Steve was quiet for a moment, a thoughtful expression on his face. Tony imagined a virtual list running through his mind as he crossed out the names of people he wouldn't trust with Tony's well being. Tony waited, giving him time to think, and he could see the moment when Steve decided.
“Steve... where are you...” His voice was barely a whisper as the tears overflowed. He almost wished he would die just to stop feeling like this. Every part of him hurt, he couldn’t stop shivering, and he felt so alone. He couldn’t remember where Steve had gone; he only knew that they’d had an amazing scene, and he couldn’t remember ever feeling so good. But then Steve had left, left Tony alone, barely kissed him before he’d gone. Deep inside, he had known it was just a matter of time before Steve left and now it had happened. He was gone.
need. Talk to me, Doll. What happened?” Bucky reach out and slipped a hand down the side of Tony’s face and lifted his chin. He was gentle, but his strength did not allow Tony to resist the movement. Tony glanced up at him, then looked down at the floor between them.
There was a moment’s pause before the AI answered, “There is an ointment Captain Rogers usually applies to ease the pain and speed healing. They were interrupted before he could use it this evening.”
That was all the encouragement Tony needed after holding back for so long and his orgasm exploded out him along with a frantic shout as his hands came up to clutch at Steve. Steve continued to stroke him through his orgasm and leaned forward to kiss him deep and passionate, drinking in the sound of his cries. He pulled Tony up into his arms and continued to stroke and soothe him through the aftershocks until Tony stilled once more into a loose puddle of bliss in his arms. Steve kissed his temple and crooned wordlessly into his hair for a few minutes more, loving the soft, pliant weight of Tony molded against him, before picking him up and leaving the workshop behind.
Steve ran a hand over his face as he considered what Tony was suggesting. He was quiet for a long time and Tony started to feel anxious about it.
“Friday,” Steve pleaded with the AI and looked up to address her again, “I fucked up, I get it. But I just want to make it right. Please let me through. I just want to make sure he’s okay now, please.” If the AI wanted to see him beg, he’d do it. Right then, he’d do anything that would shut off that video and get him to Tony. “Please, Friday, please open the door.”
“Okay Doll, I’m not gonna do anything ya don’t want me to. So do ya want me to get it and put it on for ya? It’s okay to say no, but if ya want it, that’s okay too.”
Tony was loose and pliant in his hands, accepting all the pain and pleasure Steve had given him over the evening equally and so beautifully it made his heart ache to witness it. It had been an intense night, and Steve felt himself quickly approaching his release. He reached around and took Tony’s hard, leaking cock in his hand stroking him hard and fast.
Tony and Ironman were working in the lab together working on their suit when they heard Pepper come in.
He wasn’t surprised to see Tony there putting the collar back on him and weirdly under his collar on the suit. Tony then took the tie from Peter’s neck and started tying it for him.
“So you are attached to this?” Jensen asked holding up the collar and Peter could feel Jensen’s finger on his neck from where he was holding it.
“Thanks.” Ironman said and then gave Tony control. Tony took the helmet back off and ate the sandwich. ‘This is a good sandwich.’ Ironman thought enjoying it.
“Ironman stop it haven’t you put the kid through enough.” Tony said feeling betrayed by his other half.
“I- I don’t even...  you know what doesn’t matter it was just some stupid prank Tony pulled.” Natasha said dismissing everything that just happened as a prank. Steve laughed seeing Natasha startled and confused.
“Are you okay?” Tony asked and Peter nodded closing his eyes and cursing in his head. Tony touched him and Peter flinched back opening his eyes and looking at Tony terrified and immediately put his hand to his throat reminding himself that he didn’t have it on and Tony couldn’t shock him. Tony looked at him with pity and Peter looked away shivering in fear and keeping his distance from Tony.
“I don’t want to go back.” Peter said and watched as the portal closed quickly and him still on the wrong side. Robert looked down on Peter and Tom and hugged them both.
“I saw that though you threatened him and you could have killed him!” Peter said raising his voice and getting in a defensive stance.
“Yeah I really like.” Steve said hungrily, holding Peter in place and running his hands down Peter’s body and lifting his shirt to see his abs. Peter shivered feeling violated.
“Oh my gosh I’m so sorry I forgot!” Steve said getting up and getting out a first aid kit. Tony just watched Steve confused at first then blushed embarrassed.
“No there was some interference with my suit.” Ironman said mentally glaring at Tony. ‘Sorry’ Tony said again feeling guilty.
“I’m sorry Mr. Stark.” Peter said feeling he let down the team and Tony watched as Steve and Bucky got to the hanger but it was okay as long as Peter was safe.
“Hey it’s okay I won’t hurt you I just came to check if you were okay.” Tony said and Peter did the breathing exercise Mark taught him closing his eyes then opening them still seeing Tony but Peter was more calm.
“Well it’s complicated we are more than friends but we aren’t lovers.” Ironman said and Tony felt his heart sink a little but knew Ironman was correct.
“I don’t think they like me.” Steve said thinking of Ironman and Tony’s interaction and how Tony said ‘I love you and only you’.
“Stop crying.” Tony said and shocked him again. Peter did his best to stop crying just angry now. Peter felt something prick his neck and his eyes widened panicking. Peter started feeling tired as he felt his muscles relaxing and going numb. Tony held him up slowly lying him down.
“Take my collar away from Misha I can’t have him around it anymore!” Peter yelled blushing still embarrassed.
“I fell down the stairs...” Tony said hesitantly hoping that was believable. Telling by Steve’s frown Tony could tell he didn’t believe him.
“And I’ve seen the footage, the only thing he really fight for is you. Your not the kind of guy to make the sacrifice play. To lay down on the wire and let the other guy crawl over you.” Steve continued and Ironman struggled to keep himself in the confines of Tony’s mind. (Sorry I didn’t know how to word it right this was terrible)
“It’s not your fault.” Peter said and really looked at Tony and didn’t see any of the mean angry person he was before. Tony was younger and nicer. Peter smiled at him and Tony finally looked up looking at Peter.
“Tony!” Ironman called out and Tony tried wiping away his tears trying to stop crying enough to let Ironman in. Tony wiped away his tears and calmed himself down finally letting Ironman in.
“Nope I don’t think I will.” Tony said chuckling softly and then turning around going to some tools on the table behind him.
“I don’t remember I think he... he died.” Peter said burying his old mentor mentally. Peter the looked up and smiled.
“J, activate protocol dark.” Tony said and Steve freaked out as all the lights went out and the windows were sealed off blocking out all light in the room. Tony gave Ironman control and his eyes glowed in the dark creating a light source for Natasha and Steve to see.
“Let’s do it.” Ironman said smiling and started working. Tony worked with him and they worked together perfectly.
Steve then started picturing what Ironman would look like using Tony as a reference seeing as they probably were near the same measurements. Steve blushed realizing he just drew Tony again but with flaming blue eyes.
Peter whimpered as Tony took Peter’s tie off and grabbed the metal collar hooking Peter up to the wall.
“I don’t blame him for it though I understand.” Peter said quietly and Tony looked at him confused but nodded anyway.
“You are coming with me.” The stranger said shoving him into a van and tying his wrists together. Peter just let himself be taken he wasn’t Spider-Man right now he couldn’t fight back plus it was just rope he could break out later.
“You’re right, I should stop threatening you guys. Then maybe you guys would stop being scared of me.” Ironman said sighing sadly.
Peter started sobbing hearing Tony just walk away and abandon him. Robert saw the portal closing and turned around.
“I know I love you but it’s kinda hard to protect you when you keep making me smile.” Tony said adoration in his voice. ‘Sorry I just love how protective you are of me.’ Ironman said happily loving every second he had with Tony.
“We will find a way to get that off you okay.” Mark said and Peter nodded feeling a tiny bit of hope. Peter then felt something in the collar poke into him and he looked at Mark panicked.
“What were you gonna call me it sounded like you were gonna tease me for something?” Tony said confused and Peter was glad he had his mask still on because he was blushing in embarrassment.
“Sit.” Tony said motioning to the bed and Peter sat down confused. Tony then picked up a comb and started doing Peter’s hair. Peter was puzzled but went with it not having anything else to do. As long as he did what Tony asked he wouldn’t get shocked and right now he didn’t feel like resisting much there was no point Tony taught him that already.
Steve then started drawing the armor again watching Tony work on it and trying to get every single detail right. Steve smiled finishing the armor sketch.
“Always a way out.” Steve said and Ironman nearly just separated then and strangled him but Tony kept him back. ‘Don’t attack him’ Tony thought and Ironman tried to hold himself back. ‘But he is insulting us!’ Ironman said wanting to strangle Steve.
“Tony we NEED to talk!” Ironman said more firmly and Tony fidgeted feeling like he was in trouble for something. Ironman opened their bedroom door and then locked it behind him and practically threw Tony on the bed.
“Okay I will be there.” Tony said and left Ironman in the lab as Tony led Pepper out. Ironman continued to work on the armor a little nervous about what Tony would say about him to Pepper. Ironman stopped working his thoughts getting to him. He really hoped Tony would come back soon... Ironman started pacing feeling nervous.
Tony got out of the armor and hid in his lab to just cry. He really was just a mess up. Tony cried all his self loathing getting to him and his eyes lit up and burned as he cried. Tony wiped away his tears the tears flaming against his cheeks.
Tony got up and went down to his lab to work on the Ironman armor making sure to wear his sunglasses to help keep his eyes from flaming up again. Tony worked on the armor for hours losing track of time.
Peter didn’t see any malice or ill intentions in Tony’s eyes so he reminded himself this wasn’t the same Tony so he calmed down.
The Supernatural cast made sure Tom didn’t do anything he didn’t want to on Supernatural and even gave him a double if Tom didn’t feel like doing the scene. Tom turned out to be an angel undercover in the Men of Letters and Tom had fun.
Tony woke up and cried as his eyes burned a bright blue lighting up his bedroom. Tony breathed heavily trying to calm down his nightmare from Afghanistan still haunting him. Tony cried bringing his knees up to his chest and cried trying to calm down the pain in his eyes getting to him.
“I know.” Ironman said stopping and Tony put his head down looking to the floor sadly. Ironman stepped towards him brushing his hand against Tony’s arm.
“Right you might need help with that.” Tony said realizing something and got out scissors. Peter eyes widened and shivered in fear as Tony approached him scissors in hand.
“Please don’t kill me!” Tom pleaded actually scared of the older man he thought as a father figure but from a different universe. Robert was quick to let go of Peter and ran at Tony pushing him away from Tom and taking Tom back.
“Peter!” Jensen said surprised and Jared looked at Peter scared. Alex stepped back surprised too and Peter disappeared.
“I won’t do that oh Shellhead I would never do that.” Steve said caressing Tony’s face. Tony blushed lightly and shook his head backing away slightly.
“It’s okay feel free to draw me or the armor whenever you want. Can I see what you drew?” Tony asked and Steve hesitantly nodded handing over his sketch book.
“Yeah I know.” Bruce said and approached Peter. Peter flinched slightly as Bruce rest his hand on Peter’s shoulder.
“This is my intern, Peter Smith.” Tony said not saying his real last name knowing there was a missing person’s report for Peter.
He was about to meet the Avengers and he had to act like he wasn’t being held prisoner. Great. Peter thought about acting out but would the Avengers believe him? Would Tony shock him if he did act out? How would Tony explain that if he did? Would they take Tony’s word over his?
“Please wake up... you don’t even have the collar on anymore... so please. Please wake up Peter.” Mark said almost in tears and Peter wanted to wake up right then and there and rejoice that they actually got the collar off but something was stopping him, fear maybe but he felt trapped inside his head.
“Tony, look, I’m really sorry. I don’t know what came over me.” Tony looked at him, still unconvinced. “Dean is a good friend of mine and he was actually very excited to meet you,” he began. “He didn’t deserve that, Steve. I think I better go find him.”
He was tempted to jump in. He hadn’t been swimming in what felt like years. Maybe it’d help clear his head. Oh, what the hell? He toed off his sneakers and socks, setting them on a large rock. His shirt and pants followed, leaving him in his boxer-briefs. The new arc reactor mirrored the blue of the water.  He took a deep breath, then jumped from his place on the rock.
But Tony didn’t scream, didn’t punch him, didn’t even summon the suit. He studied Steve’s face for a few moments, head tilted slightly, eyes boring into his. And then finally, “Come to finish what you started in Siberia?” He asked quietly. Oh god, had he really thought Steve was going to kill him those months ago? It made Steve’s insides thoroughly ache. “Tony, no. God, you have to know that I—“
Tony was tired. He would gladly take death over this, he thought. God, that’s morbid, but it is what it is.  The fight with Steve took what little he had left. At least if he had died in Siberia, he wouldn’t have to deal with this hollowness and immense desperation, yet alarming apathy. He lost part of his team, his family. He had already lost Pepper. He was a damn futurist, wasn’t he? But what good does that do if you have no future?
“I take it you’re happy there? You have no idea how relieved I am to hear that. Your eating habits are ridiculous. Where is the boy, by the way? You didn’t leave him at the market, did you,” Rhodey asked him jokingly.
“Oh yeah. Kid was trying to fight the damn thing with his own costume repulsers; he had guts,” Tony chuckled. “Wait, how do you know?”

Steve still had so many questions but Éamon was here. He was here and he wanted to dance with him. Who was he to refuse? He took his fairy’s hand and led them to the edge of the dancing. Éamon grinned so beautifully, eyes illuminated by the firelight. He wrapped his arms around Steve and the blonde instantly felt that familiar, magical warmth. Then, the ghost of Éamon’s breath near his ear.
arranged an emergency protocol, but Friday could read his vitals and she knew he wasn’t in real danger. She still held a grudge against Steve, Tony thought, fondly.
Steve let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. Was the fairy letting him go? “I will let you go, sunshine. You’re a brave one. Foolish. But brave. I see the goodness in your heart.” Steve had not realized he’d asked the question out loud. “Come, let me bestow you with my mark. My brothers and sisters will not dare lay a hand on you. And I trust you will find it will take care of your breathing problem.”
