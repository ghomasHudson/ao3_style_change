Castiel drew in a sharp breath. Dean opened his eyes, ink dark boring into sky blue. Cas was still, and in his eyes was something Dean had never seen, something he'd never wanted to see.
"What do you like?" Dean asked against Em's ear, letting his lips brush the shell of it on every word. He nuzzled into Em's hair, making no secret of it as he inhaled deeply, scenting Emmanuel.
He moved closer and kissed Em's shoulder sweetly, lining himself up to just rut against Em's backside without going in. He slid easily through the copious slick, groaning at the friction. He thrust once, twice, the head of his cock catching on but sliding over the entrance to Emmanuel's body.
Dean was on his feet before he'd even consciously thought to do so. He lunged and grabbed Cas's wrist before he'd gone two steps.
"The market sounds good," Cas said, trying to subtly shuffle back on the bed. He blindly reached down for the bag he always kept at his waist and realized his belt must have shifted in the night. The bag had somehow ended up at his back.
It's not an elegant solution, but it works for now. As a human, he was vulnerable to all sorts of dangers he hadn't needed to worry about as an angel; possession, for one thing. Being found and cornered by his siblings, for another. He'd purchased the Sharpie with coins he'd found on the road and had scribbled Enochian on his arm. There, the marks would be easy to conceal and easy to re-draw if necessary.
, Dean," Cas snaps back. "I just don't-" He makes a vague, sharp gesture with his hands, as if to convey that he knows but just doesn't
Dean didn't want that. He blindly reached for the plate and picked up the first thing his fingers touched; a small cube of cheese. He barely glanced at it before presenting it to Emmanuel's back.
"Prince Castiel?" she called again. She listened for any sound of movement behind the door, but there was nothing. When the silence stretched for a minute, she sighed and went for the handle.
"Nothing, nobody leaving or entering the apartment. It was the first thing the officers checked," she says. "Cost me a small fortune, but I simply had to get them installed after the incident last year."
It's several long, long minutes before he heads back. He's misses no calls or texts and has no voicemails.
Dean felt the words echo in him, stoking the fire inside to new heights. He didn't always tie off with his partners; knotting was intimate. It implied things beyond a simple good time, things Dean had rarely felt like promising to anyone, with or without words.
"Do you want it?" Em asked. His voice was carefully light, but simultaneously too heavy for such a simple question.
Almost before Dean knows what he's doing, he reaches out to overlap one of Cas's hands with his own. Cas tenses, still not looking at Dean.
He'd only just begun to work himself into a proper panic when he heard the door open. He turned to face it quick as a flash, a mixture of shock, relief, and dismay hitting him all at once when he saw it was Dean coming through the door.
The next cartoon starts. This one's a Daffy Duck one and Dean listens with half an ear while he surreptitiously keeps an eye on Cas.
Cas's eyes go to the notebook again, some of the sleepiness dropping from his expression with the sudden tension. Dean can see some confusion still on the former angel's face, like Cas knows the notebook isn't just a light-hearted gift but doesn't quite understand what it's for.
"Well... they're a lovely couple, they really are, and it isn't any of my business or anything, but..."
Cas’s voice wavers, nearly breaks at the end of his sentence. Dean feels like the air’s been punched out of his lungs.
The spray hits Cas full in the back and he gasps, but it's a welcome sound. Dean cups his face and catches Cas's eyes with his own.
"I could say the same to you," Cas said. He was still staring at Dean as though he was some miracle, something beautiful and good sent by God to bless him.
"Excellent," he replied dryly. "You know how much I enjoy tales of 'proper' omegas finding an alpha and settling down to bear children."
The demon tries to take advantage of Dean being shaken, rushing forward, but Dean is on his guard and for all the demon’s posturing, it relies more on surprise than skill. Dean ducks the creature’s wild strike and punches him hard in the stomach. The demon doubles over and then Dean has a firm grip on the front of Cas’s shirt, turning and walking him backwards until he’s pressed against the wall. The demon blade comes to rest at Castiel’s neck, pressing in just hard enough to be a threat.
He lingered at the junction of Em's neck and shoulder, scraping his teeth lightly against his scent gland, sucking and kissing and biting hard enough to bruise but not break the skin. It was terribly possessive, more primal than Dean usually got, but Em had no complaints. He tilted his head, exposing more of his neck to Dean's mouth, breathlessly calling Dean's name.
April is quiet again, absorbing the information. Castiel lets her, feeling a bit like a wrung out dishrag.
For a moment, there's only the sound of the water falling around them. Then Cas shivers - from cold rather than fear - and Dean comes back to himself.
Cas thinks he should make a comment, either on the nature of memory or the building itself, but he can't. All his words are dried up in his throat.
Just after he'd Fallen, with the last of his dying phone battery, he'd called Dean to let him know what had happened. He'd let Dean know of Metatron's betrayal, the Fall of Heaven, and Castiel's unwitting, unwilling role.
"Just wake up," Dean says. He'd be ashamed of the pleading note in his voice if he wasn't so desperate for this to work.
"You mentioned the market?" Em asked, grabbing his bag and dragging it down his bed, stepping carefully around the mess on the floor. He dug through and came out with a clean, dark green tunic and quickly shrugged it on. "That sounds good to me, if you didn't have any other plans or anywhere to be. Are we staying here another night?"
"You..." she says. There's no venom in it. She shakes her head. "I wasn't... aware the whole time, I just- it was mostly flashes, but I knew, I could feel-" Her voice breaks off and she shakes her head again. "I've had a lot of time to think this past year. Think and stew and remember... I hated you so, so much."
Castiel wakes with a start and a gasp, eyes momentarily wide and unseeing at the night sky above him. The hand on his shoulder stops shaking him, but doesn't move.
"Thank you," Cas says. He blinks at the bottle, trying to read the tiny print on it. "How much do I-"
Even Sam seems shocked by the venom in Dean's tone. Dean feels a pang of guilt, but he can't take the words back. He swallows the bitterness that threatens to choke him and looks away.
"I..." Cas started, then seemed to think better of it. He shook his head hopelessly and pushed back from the table, then stood and turned towards the door in one motion.
The tide of anger that had been pulling Dean through this conversation suddenly died. He stared at Cas in shock, eyes wide.
Dean considers just putting the phone down and going to get himself a beer instead. Or whiskey. Anything so he doesn't have to think about the snail-like pace of their progress. Instead, he texts back.
"See something you like?" Dean couldn't resist asking, voice low and husky. Emmanuel gave him a long, slow once-over, ending with his eyes staring intensely into Dean's for what felt like an eternity trapped inside a moment.
The moment shatters. April snarls and lunges forward, throwing him bodily against the far wall. The landlady screams. Dean shouts as Castiel's head strikes the plaster, leaving a sizeable dent. Cas collapses to his knees, head reeling and stomach heaving.
He can taste cloyingly sweet fake fruit and a sticky, nutty flavor on his tongue. He can feel her hand on his shoulder as she gives him a predatory smile and leans in-
"Anyone turn in a charger lately?" Jordan asks. "I think I left mine here the other day. Micro USB, black?"
"Well, I think that's my cue," Bobby said, nodding decisively. He pushed himself up and out of his chair and made a show of brushing imaginary dust off of his shirt. "Should go see what Karen's got baking."
Cas could have smote the demon a thousand times over for the stricken look on Dean’s face. It passes quickly, but one heartbeat of
Dean wrapped his arms around Em and nuzzled close. They were quite the mess and sticky, and Dean could feel fluids leaking around his knot, but those were problems for Dean-ten-minutes-from-now. All Dean-now wanted was to enjoy a rather spectacular afterglow and a healthy dose of cuddling; something he didn't let himself indulge in all that often.
Dean chalked that up to meeting a lot of trauma victims in his line of work, though it had never been someone this close to him before. He'd never stuck around to help someone with the recovery before.
"Son of a bitch," Dean says. Sam is half a step behind him, looking around the tiny bathroom in shock.
But Dean is rising with him and the hand that had been resting on the back of Cas's slides, coming palm-to-palm as Dean's fingers find the spaces between Cas's own.
The Laundromat had seemed like the perfect place to wait. It was 24-hours and it was not uncommon to see someone waiting there for long periods of time. It was well-lit, too, and so Castiel had settled himself in one of the cheap plastic chairs, made sure he had a good view of the door, and called Dean. Their conversation had been short and to the point, as Cas’s phone battery was dying and there was no way to recharge it.
"You ok?" he calls to Johnny, glancing over. Johnny is curled up on his side, facing away from Jordan. His coughs are powerful, shaking his whole body with wet, harsh sounds. Jordan feels a frission of worry.
The dust has barely begun to settle when Cas hears rapid footsteps approaching the door. He turns just in time to see the door to the apartment burst open, Sam and Dean running inside in an echo of that morning a year ago when they'd found Cas tied to a chair with the reaper standing over him, wielding his own blade.
here, so gloriously responsive. Dean pulled back enough to blow gently on the wet skin just to hear Cas's breath hitch and see him tremble.
Despite what Sam thought - and what Dean had purposefully implied - Dean wasn't watching porn. In fact, Dean could honestly say porn had never been further from his mind. All week, he'd been stealing Sam's laptop to do something far more important than get his kicks or look up a new case.
He isn't sure what kind of expression he's making, but whatever she sees on his face gives April pause. Her expression melts to one of shock.
It would be just the two of them in the motel room, and Dean’s guard was still down, at least where Castiel was concerned. No one was expecting them until the next day. There was plenty of time for the demon to do whatever it wanted with no one any the wiser.
Sam, at least, is out of bed and there's color back in his cheeks. He's frowning and taking notes on a different book, one so old there's no title across the front. Kevin sits across from Dean, head bent over the angel tablet and fingers tracing the runes. He writes much more slowly than Sam does, sometimes muttering to himself and scratching pieces of the translation out. On the far side of the table is a tall stack of books, some with bookmarks in them, most without, and next to Sam's elbow is a much, much smaller stack of books.
Why was it that whenever he seemed to be moving forward, something always came along to shove him backwards? Always,
At least their waitress was kind, Cas had mused. The other patrons were less so. Some stared openly, with disgust or pity, and Cas couldn't decide which he liked less.
"I'm sorry, but I can't," Cas says, voice barely above a whisper. The sound carries just enough to reach Jordan, who is quiet for a moment.
He makes his way to the stairwell and climbs the flights of stairs to the third floor. The halls are eeriely quiet, only the pounding of his heart and his own harsh breathing audible to his ears.
"Want pancakes?" Dean asks, hoping to stave off the inevitable. If Cas somehow decides that today he's a morning person and actually shows up in time for breakfast, Dean's saved.
"Only if the person you're watching doesn't know you're doing it," he says. Cas nods and then looks down. He takes a deep breath.
"Never had to untie myself in a hurry," Em grumbled. Dean laughed as he got the last of the laces worked loose.
"Sore muscles again?" Dean asked softly. Castiel nodded, feeling on edge though he couldn't pinpoint exactly why.
He watches as Dean and Sam introduce themselves to the landlady as FBI agents, and she's so charmed by their smiles and ease nobody seems to notice that Cas doesn't flash his badge.
"Yeah, but Jack busted you out, right?" he asked. He wanted to ask a thousand questions, mostly variations on 'how' and 'when' and 'why didn't you come find me', but wasn't sure he wanted to know the answers.
And to think, they'd figured this would be an easy hunt to get Cas started. All the signs had pointed to a simple salt and burn.
"Any time," he says, and he means for his response to be somewhat light-hearted and flippant, but it comes out equally weighty.
Cas can't stop staring and Dean, for his part, can't seem to stop touching him. Dean's hand squeezes his shoulder, then slides down his arm to hesitantly rest on top of Cas's hand.
Hannah hovered anxiously, waiting to help Cas remove the outer robe as he usually did after retreating to his room, but this time Castiel couldn't be bothered with it. He walked across his room to the window, staring out at the citadel of Haven spread before him. There were candles in the windows of some of the houses, enough light spilling from a few for Castiel to guess at a fireplace.
Cas had done as he was told, nervous about what would happen when Dean finally arrived. He’d taken some change he found in his pockets and bought himself a bottle of water, then gone to the bathroom to relieve himself.
"Dean," Cas breathed. Dean dipped forward and kissed just above the waistband of Cas's boxers. He dragged his mouth down, onto the cloth covering Cas's arousal, and Cas gasped and bucked, overwhelmed. Dean chuckled lowly, mouthing wetly at the head of Cas's erection through the thin cotton cloth. There was a damp patch growing under his tongue, saliva and precome both.
Cas searches desperately for an opening. He needs just a heartbeat of inattention, something he can use to break free. The demon’s presence is thick and choking and his anger for the creature is matched only by his fear for Dean.
"Home invasion, the police said, though it looked like nothing was taken from the apartment. Stabbed the poor girl living there to death, though." She shakes her head sadly. "Never had such trouble in all the years I've lived here, so it was quite a shock."
Cas sits up and turns towards the person who had awoken him, wincing as his back complains about his concrete bed. The flimsy, damp cardboard beneath him does little to soften the pavement, or trap in heat.
"It's Dean," Dean replies. "Sam and I are gonna go do a little research and grab some dinner. We'll be back right after; you want anything?"
Em was so tight around him, so hot and wet, muscles contracting around Dean in a wave Dean could feel from tip to root. He settled himself there, just breathing as he waited for Em's body to adjust.
There was no use in arguing. His mother was still his alpha and while he'd been lucky and clever enough to avoid marriage so far, it seemed his luck had ended.
He's learned bits and pieces about Jordan's life during the week he'd spent in the young man's company, trying to figure out how to be human as well as homeless.
Cas swallows around the lump in his throat. He curls one hand into a fist, digging his nails into his palm and trying not to panic. For a moment, the rattling picture frames sounded almost like thunder, the flickering lights resembling candlelight for a split second-
Sam nods slowly, face scrunched up in deep concentration. Dean can tell he's probably casting his mind back to that day, adding up what he knows of that to what he knows now, what Dean's asked him not to say, to Cas's idiosyncrasies when it comes to bathing and changing clothes-
Even so, there is nothing he wouldn't give to set his past self on a different path than the one he'd taken.
Dean's still trying not to think about it too hard, trying not to think about all the 'what ifs'. If only Dean had done something differently, maybe-
April just stares at him in stunned silence. Cas can't find words, any words, to try and explain himself further. He's loath to dredge up details she might see as excuses, sick at the idea of halving his burdens by placing any more weight on her shoulders.
"Said she'd call when she does," he says. He flips the pages, hoping Sam will get the hint and drop it, but to his displeasure, Sam speaks again.
The thought seems to bring him some measure of peace. Whatever burst of energy he had now depleted, Johnny settles his back against his pallet once more. He coughs as he lowers himself down.
He thinks of Lisa and the year he'd spent with her. It hadn't been perfect, but it had been good. Lisa had been good to him; he'd fitted into her life not as a perfectly slotted piece, but as something that could have worked given enough time and effort. Ben had been the son he'd never had and the white picket fence in the suburbs was everything he'd ever thought he wanted.
No, not 'home'. The bunker. He can't call it by any other name, even if the ache in his chest feels like homesickness.
"Out," Dean says, letting the air leave his lungs audibly. Cas's exhale shudders. "Good, now in again."
"Thank you," Cas says and the words feel heavy as they lay across Dean's shoulders, but Cas seems lighter somehow. Like a burden has been lifted. It settles something in Dean, something unhappy and restless, and he relaxes.
"With any preparations you need to make. Before the wedding," Balthazar said, and from the tone of his voice, Cas knows he's not talking about helping pick out the garments Castiel will wear for the ceremony.
," Cas breathed, hips snapping up as Dean's lips closed around the head of him. Dean took it in stride and slowly sank down over Cas's arousal, encasing him in the warm wetness of his mouth.
Johnny collapses back. He looks exhausted. His chest heaves with every breath, like he can't get enough air.
Cas does. His chest feels that stabbing pain again, sharp and fierce, and he ignores it in favor of taking the bottle from Jordan.
"You expect me to believe that?" April asks, though her eyes betray sudden uncertainty. Cas shakes his head, weary to the bone.
me?" Dean said. He seized one of Cas's hands and pulled, placing the priest's palm on his horn. "Does that feel
As for Cas's soul... Dean's fears had been unfounded. He stared at the priest, hardly daring to believe it, but Cas's soul was still untainted. Pure.
“Cas,” Dean says, lifting his other hand to cup Cas’s other cheek. He keeps his tone gentle, hoping to soothe Cas’s flared temper. Cas calms, but there’s still a hard glint in his eye. “Have I told you I needed more? Have I done something to make you think I’m not happy?”
And, shit. He was thinking about 'foundations' and romantic gestures and slow seductions and not even
He just has to stay awake, but his eyes are kinda dry and if he closes them for just a second that should be fine.
"'M right there with you, Em," Dean said. He moved faster, trying desperately to keep his rhythm steady as the pleasure in his veins burned white-hot. His knot started to swell, throbbing.
"'Where there is love, there is His grace'," Dean quoted softly back at Cas. He laid a hand on Cas's face and brushed a thumb over his lips. "I didn't ruin you."
"I can do that," he said. He pulled back, rising to his knees so he could pull off the flannel and the T-shirt he'd worn today. For a moment, his shirt got caught on one of his horns. He held the T-shirt for a moment before dropping it off the side of the bed. He touched the offending horn and looked down at Cas, the picture of sullied perfection with his hair mussed and lips red and damp. His priest's collar seemed bright white in the light of the bedside lamp.
Em shivered as Dean began making his way down Em's body once more, though this time Dean was interested in a more thorough exploration. The end goal was in sight, but Dean was in no rush to get there, not when he still had a thousand little noises to pull from Em's throat and hundreds of things left he wanted to try.
Once Cas is comfortable, he looks up at Dean expectantly. Dean grins and settles himself on Cas's bed, angling himself to make the most of the table lamp on between their beds. He opens the book, clears his throat, and begins;
She turned on her heel and ran out of the room, practically breaking the door in her haste, screaming for Balthazar.
Whatever he'd expected from the look in Johnny's eyes whenever 'Dean' was brought up, this wasn't it. Fuck, maybe Johnny had run off to escape this guy and here Jordan was, basically ready to gift-wrap him and ship him back.
Dean hustles him into the shower, not bothering with their clothes. He turns the water on as cold as it will go and hopes.
"We're just trying to rule out any kind of foul play, ma'am," Sam says. The landlady waves her hand dismissively as she leads them to the stairwell. Dean and Sam follow her immediately. Cas hesitates.
"GUYS!" Sam shouted with the air of someone who had been calling for a long time. Abruptly, the fact that they were in a public place came back to them and Dean pulled back, red-faced with embarrassment. Cas looked stunned and flushed and
It's awkward. Dean's mouth is only half on Cas's lips, there's far too many teeth involved, and Cas isn't moving. Dean angles his head and gentles the kiss. For a moment, it's
He couldn't do this to them. He knew where their loyalty lay, and it wasn't with his mother. Still, they were Naomi's subjects. Naomi might not execute her own son for running off, but no such protection extended to his handmaiden or personal guard.
The ice is mostly an excuse to keep himself busy, but maybe making a cold compress will help with the fever. He finds the ice bucket, still half full from that morning, though some of the ice had melted. It would do until he could get Sam to bring him a few bags of ice.
But if he did have help, if he'd found someone else to provide for him, that would complicate matters.
"Some people think God's law," Sam interjected, leaning forward to try and steer the conversation. "They think that being gay is wrong because it says so in the Bible, but-"
you, Dean," Cas says, looking at Dean so intensely Dean's surprised his eyes don't burn with his lost Grace. "I wanted to know every part of you and claim it for my own. I wanted to bring you pleasure. I wanted-" Cas shakes his head, like he can't even put into words everything he desired.
"I-" he says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. "I..." He shakes his head, words having failed him. Dean nods.
The bedroom door is ajar and Cas finds his eyes inexorably drawn to it, gaze skimming over the striped sheets and lit candles-
Dean chuckles, giddy with success and anticipation. He pulls back just a little, just enough to look Cas in the eye when he speaks.
Still, thinking about Dean's low voice saying "you have to go" was easier than thinking about what awaited him at the end of his walk. His mind was going in circles, latching on to all of the hurts and old wounds that surrounded that night because of everything Cas had gone through, those were far easier to think about.
Cas shivers again and only then does he start moving. He climbs into Dean's bed with only a glance at Dean to make sure it was really ok. Dean has to resist the urge to tuck him in as Cas settles himself beneath the covers, curled up with only his head sticking out of the blankets.
Dean still remembers that conversation, the emptiness in Cas's eyes when Cas had confessed "I'm afraid I might kill myself".
Dean isn't sure he'll ever forgive himself for that. He's done a lot of terrible things in his life, but leaving Cas alone to deal with the aftermath was one of the things he regretted most.
Knowing when to push and when to leave well enough alone. Being there to help pick up the pieces and knowing how to slot them together.
Jordan is been barely winded by the light jog, whereas Cas is completely out of breath. He's doubled over, leaning against one of the pillars that supports the bridge, and tries to breathe. His head pounds. His every breath feels like a sharp, stabbing knife in his lungs.
Dean slowly eases on the gas and pulls into the closest available parking space. He lets out a long breath.
the bitchface that gets him. Sam's quiet for a moment. Dean uses the precious second to send a prayer to an angel who can no longer hear him to show his ass up for breakfast and raise Dean once more from the Hell of emotional discussions with his brother.
Dean, Sam, and Cas had walked into the diner only to be greeted by a profusion of rainbows, a sign proclaiming 'Pride Month Specials', and a waiter with tousled curls, dimples, and a rainbow of jelly bands covering his left wrist
Dean had a notebook, once. It had been a cheap, dollar-store thing, and the ramblings inside would probably seem like a madman's ranting if anybody picked it up, but it had helped. After Hell, after losing Sammy, after losing Cas and finding him again and losing him and-
"Turn over," Dean said, voice so husky it was almost a growl. Emmanuel quickly flipped onto his hands and knees, still trembling from nerves or excitement or overstimulation, Dean couldn't tell.
"I do not," Cas says quietly, looking away again. Dean bites the inside of his cheek. Cas clears his throat.
Dean started up a rhythm, bobbing and stroking and sucking. He tongued patterns on the head of Castiel's dick on every upstroke. His hands grew bolder, the hand not stroking Cas working its way into the mess of Cas's pants and caressing every intimate inch of him in a promise of what would come.
April flickers from view and reappears seconds later looming over Cas. She's reaching for him and for a moment, Cas forgets when and where he is. Memories of that night superimpose themselves over the now and Cas flinches back, pressing himself against the wall as if to melt into it. He's shaking like a scared child but for the life of him can't seem to stop.
Dean shoves himself to his feet, knife coming up as his other hand seizes the front of Castiel’s shirt. Cas is struck by another bout of deja vu, though this time it is him on his knees with a bloody face and Dean the one above him holding a knife.
, Cas promises, though he has no idea how he’s going to carry through with his threat. The demon merely laughs again, louder and more amused.
"I'm fine, Dean," Cas says, but the tension is obvious in every line of his body. He's coiled, like a horse about to bolt, chest still heaving. He reminds Dean of nothing so much as a skittish animal right now, and for the life of him he can't imagine why.
-" Dean says again, making another exaggerated inhale. Cas opens his mouth, his hands scrambling for purchase on Dean's shoulders, but he's no more able to take a full breath than Dean is able to fly.
What did Dean look like at the moment his pleasure hit its peak? What sort of noises would he make while Castiel brought him there? What sort of touches did Dean like best, and where?
"Dean, I can't be what you want," Cas says, like each word is pulled painfully from his tongue. "I was never very interested in sex to begin with, and after April... I can't."
He scratches at his cheek absently, feeling the scrape of something that is more approaching a full beard than simple stubble. Perhaps he should buy himself a razor; Jordan had helped him pick out his other toiletries the day after they'd met, but razors had not been on the list of necessities.
"You said he... you know. 'Cared' about me," Dean says, using scare quotes because he's used up his allotment of the word 'love' for the year already. Sam shakes his head dismissively.
"Nothing has to change," Dean said. Castiel could tell he truly believed it, the conviction in his voice ringing solid and true.
Cas stills, eyes widening like he hasn’t thought about it in those terms. As if he hasn’t thought about
And now, staring at the full bathtub in the center of their room, he wondered if he was brave enough to go through with it.
Naomi was quiet for a moment. She looked out towards the horizon, towards the wild, dangerous world outside the castle, and thought.
He's got two for Sam, since Sam's still regaining his energy after the trials and eating like a horse. He has one for Kevin, two for himself, and one for someone who isn't here yet.
before, but never..." His voice trails off. He breathes, low and shuddering. "Weak. I've been weak before. I hated it then, too."
The bathroom door opens slowly. Cas walks out wearing an old T-shirt that's a size too large on him and sleep pants with cuffs that drag on the floor. He's still towel-drying his hair and his skin is flushed pink, though no steam follows him from the bathroom. He glances around the room.
The voice is his own, but distorted. Garbled. He's kneeling, clutching Jack's body to himself and begging him to
"Cas," Dean says breathlessly. Cas feels the sound like a blow to his chest. Does Dean want him too?
“This isn’t something you can compromise on,” Dean says. His voice has a little bite to it. “You can’t
"Thank you," Cas says quietly, but with feeling. Dean feels something tight in his chest relax. If Cas had wanted him to, he would have left, but he knows he would've been up all night worrying.
"Cas," he says again. He sways forward, a flicker of doubt crossing his expression. Uncertainty. Cas feels a flare of hope. Dean clears his throat. "Maybe we should-"
But Dean is a warm, solid presence next to him. Sam and Dean had come charging in and found that this time, Cas had saved himself.
Cas's hand slid around Dean, gripping the hard flesh at an awkward angle. Dean didn't care. He groaned loudly and thrust down, moaning uncontrollably at the friction of Cas's hand.
He exits the bathroom and goes right to Dean's duffle, layering up with one of Dean's plaid flannel shirts and his trenchcoat. It's a comfort, however slight.
Things he can feel. The bite of nails in his palm, the dry scratch of his coat collar against the back of his neck. The weight and warmth of his sweater and jeans, the pinch of his toes in almost-new shoes.
Finally, when they saw the other two making their way through the crowd in their direction, Castiel found his voice.
Then there's pressure all around him. More than a dozen feet of water separate him from the surface he knows he'll never see again, and his last thought as the Leviathans rip through his flesh is that he'd
"Have you been having nightmares?" Dean asks gently. Given the Succubus Incident, Dean wouldn't be surprised. Cas glances up.
Sam pokes his shaggy head into the room, frown morphing into a scowl when he notices Dean reclining on his bed with Sam's laptop in his lap. Dean gives the
"Apple cider. It's supposed to be good and you looked like you could use a drink," Dean said. He didn't say anything more, just took his place at Castiel's side and seemed content to watch the crowd mill about the booths.
"It was enough for me to be your friend," Cas said. "I knew we could never be anything else.  If I told you... things would change. And I wanted to stay with you."
But's it's too late. The landlady pushes open the door and Cas is hit by a wave of memory so strong his knees nearly give out.
Cas went still, shocked, and Dean pulled back just a little. Cas's arms flexed, like he didn't want to let Dean go just yet, but settled when Dean didn't go far.
Because good things did not happen to Dean Winchester, and angels didn't fall in love with the battered, worthless human they'd dragged out of Hell too late to stop the from start of the Apocalypse.
He'd been all right with taking things slow, but if Em was willing, Dean was certainly not going to say no.
Sam and Benny had been the only two people who hadn't cared what sex or designation his lovers were. From the sound of it, Em hadn't had even that much support.
Castiel went still. Hannah stopped trying to get him presentable and looked over at Balthazar, eyes wide.
Em made a displeased noise and tried to move, to catch Dean, but Dean laid himself along Em's back and grabbed Em's hips to hold him still.
"Oh?" Charlie asked, apparently not the least bit surprised as she released Gilda's hand. "And what, pray tell, is this 'thing'?"
Cas is only vaguely aware of collapsing to his knees, Dean following him down and frantically saying his name over and over again. Cas clings desperately to his body, to the hands touching him and the voice calling our for him.
But no. He can't let his mind wander down that path, towards all the what-ifs and maybes he has been studiously Not Thinking About for years. It only makes his bed feel bigger and colder, the room emptier, and his chest ache.
"Yes, I did," she said. "Arrangements have been made. In two months, you'll be wed and mated to Kanaan's Crown Prince."
"Mandy is staying with her mother until we get the window fixed, when she's not with David in the hospital, so I'll just go ahead and let you in," the landlady says, drawing a master key out of her pocket.
"I do," Cas said. He stepped forward, reaching out for Dean. Dean couldn't move. Cas breathed in deep and cupped Dean's face with both hands. "I love you, Dean."
He's never seen so many demons working together before. Usually the black-eyed bastards are too distracted by infighting to actually band together, but apparently they'd finally agreed that it was high time the Winchester line went extinct. There had to be at least fifty of them combing the office building, all in groups of four or five.
Cas watches her slide the key home without really seeing it, the sound reverberating in his ears like thunder. He shivers with the sense-memeory of being cold and wet, his stomach cramping with remembered hunger.
The bags under Cas's eyes are still heavy and dark, and he doesn't smile much, so it feels like a major accomplishment to see him relax. Dean's half-hoping to ply him with enough alcohol that he'll either talk and unburden himself a little or so he'll fall into a dreamless sleep tonight, Dean doesn't
There's a dive bar close enough to the motel that they can walk. They'd left the Impala in the parking lot.
,” the demon says forcefully and Dean leans back, surprised. The demon’s expression softens and he reaches up to cup Dean’s face. “I’ve waited so long for you. I don’t want to wait anymore.”
Dean made an encouraging hum in the back of his throat, bobbing his head up and down and stroking everything he couldn't fit into his mouth. It didn't take long before Emmanuel let out a choked cry of Dean's name, body going tense and shuddering as he came down Dean's throat.
Another lady had offered to take them in her section. The hostess had stared at them a moment longer, then acquiesced.
An ugly thought occurs to him. His stomach drops and his blood runs suddenly cold, despite the heat of Cas next to him and the blankets wrapped around them.
. Not the full story, because it's not his to tell, but something so that Sam, in benign ignorance, doesn't do or say something that sends Cas back to the world of his nightmares.
like he'd been struck, whirling around and pulling away from the touch. Dean holds his hands up placatingly, eyes wide.
The woman in the driver's seat recoiled, turned, and sped off. The man stopped next to Cas, chest heaving with emotion, as he watched the car go.
"Last year?" Sam asks. The landlady nods, voice going hushed as though she doesn't want to speak of it.
He fucked up. He fucked up so bad he almost wishes Sam's exorcism had come just a few minutes later.
"Let me," he said. Em shivered and nodded, sending a thrill through Dean as heady as any wine he'd ever drunk. He made his way down Emmanuel's body, stopping ony briefly to lave some attention on Em's peaked nipples. He had a far more interesting destination in mind.
Cas goes cold. His heart seizes in his chest; metaphorically speaking, the damnable muscle isn’t under his control either.
"Apologies for leaving early last night, but I needed the rest, I think. I feel much better today," he said. He'd still put the peppermint salve on before they'd left, but the prospect of not needing it when in the room anymore was a cheering one.
Dean finally stopped, mouth hovering just above Em's cock. Em was leaking quite a bit and Dean felt a burst of pride; without even touching him, Em was already so worked up. Dean had done that, he had made Em feel that good.
Dean leans in and kisses Cas again, his heart pounding in his chest. Part of him still worries that Cas won't respond, that he'll be just as stiff and uncomfortable as he was the first time-
Next time, Dean vowed to himself, they'd do this properly. There'd be candles and silk sheets and slowly undressing one another, none of this 'clothes half-off' bullshit. He'd get to see all of Cas lain gloriously bare beneath him, but for now this would do. Cas was painfully hard, the head of his erection already weeping. No need to prolong this.
Cas could only imagine Dean as a gentle, generous lover. Dean's kindness couldn't help but show through, especially, Cas was certain, in bed.
"You're not," Dean snaps. His heart is in a million little pieces but that fragility and vulnerability burns away to anger. Anger is easier, anger burns brighter than the pain for as long as he can feed it. "What the reaper did to you doesn't-"
It had lived in the drawer next to his bed ever since. Dean had thought he'd find the right moment to give it to Cas, but no such moment had presented itself.
"No hospitals. I can't- Please," Johnny says. Jordan nods slowly. He leans away from Johnny and pats his hand comfortingly as Johnny relaxes and lets go.
"Perhaps that would be best," he says. He sounds so exhausted, so weary, and Jordan digs his fingernails into his palms to resist the urge to
Still, he hesitated. The loss of his powers meant it was impossible to see her soul; for all he knew, she could be one of his fallen siblings in disguise. She could be a demon.
There's a slowly growing wet spot at the front of Cas's pants, but no accompanying smell of ammonia. The damp patch clings to Cas's skin, making it obvious he's still suffering the effects of the succubus venom.
?!" Dean demanded, stunned. Cas and Sam both looked at him, Cas's expression repulsed and Sam's exasperated.
And if Emmanuel said no, if he didn't want that life for himself... well, Dean would do what he could. The least he could offer was work if Emmanuel wanted to earn his way, or enough coin to get Em set up doing whatever he pleased with his time.
And now, he had no doubt his Fallen siblings hunted him. Best to keep moving, a nameless, faceless nobody, who could not harm anyone anymore. Before long, he'd have to leave this place, too, lest he bring Jordan into this mess.
All he can do is sit and watch his world shatter around him and hope Cas lets him down easy. His heart is already in pieces but Cas could so easily reduce those shards to dust with a few words.
And now there was nothing in their way. No more hunts, no more world-ending Apocalypses, no more sacrifices. Dean just needed to be half as brave as Cas and finally say what he'd wanted to for years.
He shivers anyway as he steps into the shower. He turns on the water, hissing as it comes out bracingly cold before the water slowly starts to heat. The water pressure isn't great, but that's to be expected. The motel is cheap and old.
"Or very brave," Gilda countered. Cas didn't have an answer for that. He looked down at his mug of cider.
Dean swallowed rapidly, slowing the motions of his head as he gently worked Em through it, drawing out the pleasure for all it was worth. Eventually, Em floated back down, his breathing evening out and his body going loose and relaxed. Dean finally pulled back, letting Em's now soft cock slip from his mouth.
"I have been both male and female and I have taken vessels that were neither," he said. "Now I am bound to this body, and I do not mind that it is male, but do not presume to tell me that because it is that I must desire women."
"Look, just because you're both men-" Sam starts, but Dean doesn't have nearly the patience for this right now.
"What happened?" Sam asks, voice quiet like he doesn't want to disturb the neighbors. Dean shakes his head and then gives a significant nod in the direction of the Impala. Sam nods and follows him to the car, waiting for Dean to speak.
It's then that he sees it. The Mark of Cain pulses a dull, angry red on Dean's arm. Cas has just enough time to see it, to understand, and then Dean is bringing the blade down,
"And when I tried to atone for my mistakes... I was desperate, and easily led," Cas says. "I meant to shut Heaven with all the angels inside and protect Earth from any further meddling. Instead, my Grace was stolen from me and used to cast every angel out of Heaven and burn their wings to ash."
It’s no consolation, because Cas knows that Dean will not be on the lookout for possession when he picks Cas up from the small-town Laundromat Cas had called him from mere hours ago.
"I didn't expect to see you again," Cas said. Dean waited for him to finish, to say something about 'not so soon' or 'not for a while yet', but there was nothing. Dean felt his heart drop, something cold taking its place.
That night is burned into his memory. He'll never forget the sight of thousands of his brothers and sisters falling, their Grace lighting up the sky like meteorites streaking through the atmosphere. Almost beautiful but so terrifying and tragic Cas's heart ached at the memory. He drags his gaze up to look her in the eye.
"Why not?" Sam asked, voice dripping with innocence. Dean wanted to elbow him and tell him to drop the subject, but he was a little curious himself. Sure, /he/ might not want to meet the dude, but why didn't
How anyone could look at him and see only a delicate ornament or a trophy was beyond Dean, but the way to put that sentiment into words was also out of reach. Words hardly did Emmanuel justice and they had never been Dean's forte to begin with.
He's learned that hunger hurt, that thirst was terrible, and that his mouth tasted awful in the mornings if he forgot to brush his teeth the night before. He's learned the contrast between clean skin and dirt; not the type he'd been covered in fresh out of Purgatory, but the kind that simply built up after a day or two as a human, sweat and dust rather than mud.
"Make that five hours. I'll be the guy in the black Impala." Dean takes another deep breath. When he speaks again, it's like the words are being pulled from him, reluctant but heartfelt. "Just... take care of him until I get there, yeah? Whatever he needs, I'll pay you back."
"I love you," Cas says. For a moment, he allows himself to feel the full force of that love, finally,
The only option is to bring her spirit peace and have her willingly let go of what was keeping her here.
"You're... in love?" Dean asked, hoping no one else could hear how choked he sounded. Sam shot him a concerned look, so Dean supposed he hadn't been all that subtle.
He wasn't sure whether he wanted to beg Cas to stop for the sake of Cas's soul, or if he wanted to beg Cas to continue. He wasn't sure if he hoped that the reminder of Cas's vows of chastity would bring this to an end. He wasn't sure what he was trying to accomplish by reminding Cas of what he was; surely there was no way Cas could forget what it was he was kissing?
wants to. More than half of all his good-time fantasies for years had featured blue eyes and dark hair and a voice like the Impala's tires over gravel.
Emmanuel smiled and lifted a slice of apple from the plate, offering it to Dean and stopping him short.
"Is that what this is about?" Dean asks. His heart is beating rapidly in his chest, a throbbing that's echoed in his ears. "Just sex?"
"I want everything," Em said. He ducked his head for a moment, as though shy, but there was no hesitation when he spoke. "I want your knot."
Dean spared only a moment for giddy excitement that Emmanuel had said 'we', that he planned on staying, before he mastered himself and nodded. Uselessly, really, since Em wasn't even looking at him.
He's spent his whole life knowing each moment could be his last. He'd spent a year knowing he was on borrowed time, and then hellhounds had dragged him into the Pit. He's seen Heaven and Hell and Purgatory. Hell, he'd died countless times in a single Tuesday.
Silence fell between them, heavy and suffocating. Dean cast his mind around for something to say, heart aching at the pain in Emmanuel's voice.
They arrive at the third floor. The landlady opens the door into the brightly lit hallway and Cas feels his world shrink down to just himself and the door at the end of the hall.
The apartment looks exactly the same as it did last time. He can see the couch where she'd dressed his wounds, the tiny kitchen she'd made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in, the dining room chairs identical to the one she tied him to...
It was too much. Cas here in his arms, warm and solid and real, and looking at him like that, tongue nervously wetting his lips like
He lands on the floor of the library, gasping in shock and pain a his nose spontaneously breaks. Blood runs down his chin and he's so disoriented that it's a surprise when the first punch hits his face.
"It's the truth whether or not you believe it," he says. "Many... most of my siblings despise me for the things I've done, and I can't say I don't understand. The reaper-" His voice breaks but he rallies quickly, eyes sliding to the floor so he doesn't have to face April as he speaks. "The one who possessed you probably wanted revenge."
Cas lowers the shirt to lay on top of the duffle with the pants and boxers. He takes a deep breath and then quickly strips himself, trying not to think about the cool air on his skin.
What was 'a long time' to a creature that had been around since before the first humans walked on the Earth?
"And the cooks?" Naomi asked, looking around the room again. "The servants? He couldn't have done this without help."
"So fucking gorgeous," Dean said. He placed a brief, chaste kiss on Cas's lips. "So beautiful like this, Cas."
Things he can hear. The sound of a car rolling by outside, the faint hum of central heating. His own breathing, steady, in-out. In. Out.
He wants to beg Dean to go back to Sam, to return to the world of the living and leave Castiel to his fate, but he knows that one look into Dean's eyes and his resolve will crumble.
Castiel didn't trust himself to respond. The silence dragged on, broken only by the crackle of flames in the fireplace.
He focuses on his breathing and tries to keep it steady as they enter the building he hasn't seen in over a year except in nightmares.
"Raphael had to be stopped, but I didn't need to exact vengeance on his followers. None of them could have opened the Cage. None of them were powerful enough to put the Apocalypse back on track, not without an archangel. But I... I thought I could improve things. Make the world better."
He tries not to think of Dean's heart, so burdened from so young an age, weighing heavier and heavier with every loss.
Any surprise or mortification he might've felt at Sam knowing how he felt about Cas had been completely eclipsed by his anger over what Sam had accidentally implied. He was sure those feelings would surface later, when he'd had more time to think, but for now he just felt tired.
"Kid was healthy as a horse," Dean says. "Didn't get sick much, but when he did... he was the most miserable little kid." Dean chuckles a bit and grabs a second rag. He wrings it out and brings it to Cas's neck.
Cas's breathing slowly calms as he looks around the room and finds nothing but the two apparently sleeping Winchesters. Dean watches him slide quietly out of bed and stumble towards the bathroom.
Dead silence follows Dean's accusation. The Entity may not have eyes, but Cas can feel it staring at them.
"Are you hungry?" Emmanuel asked. He gestured to a plate set up where the wash basin had been that morning. It held a small bunches of grapes, several slices of apple, a few different types of berries, and cubes of a white cheese Dean didn't know enough to identify.
Cas breathes in, the air shuddering in his lungs. His next breath is sharper and shorter than the last and his shoulders tremble as he breathes out.
"You with me?" Dean asks. Cas nods. His breathing is still shallower than Dean would like, but the sudden shock of the cold water is helping. "Good. Follow me, ok? Breathe in-" Dean makes an exaggerated inhale.
He thinks about Kevin and his slow progress with the angel tablet. Maybe it will have information on reversing the spell that caused the angels to Fall, maybe it won't, but either way it'll be
"You're enough," Dean says. He scoots forward on his chair. "Just... I'd like to kiss you, if that's ok?"
, but Cas... you are one of the most loving people I know. You love Jack, you love Sam, you... you love
"Can you tell me why?" Sam asks, naked concern in his voice. Dean turns and he can see the gears working in Sam's brain, on the cusp of an answer but not quite there yet.
A sudden knock at the door interrupted Hannah's reply. They both glanced over at the door, confused.
He takes the angel blade he always carries with him and stabs a hole into the bottom corner of the bag of salt. He steps a little further into the room and turns slowly, arm held out wide to spill the salt in a large circle. The salt pours from the bag with a quiet sussurus of sound, like a snake slithering through a hedge.
The rag scratches. His nails bite through the thin cloth and leave raised red marks wherever he scrubs. He can see them like brands on his skin.
As Cas shuts the door behind him, it hits Dean that he's never actually been in Cas's room since the former angel had come to live with them permanently. He takes a moment to glance around, curious to see what Cas has done with the space.
There’s a strange sensation, almost as though someone is patting his head, but the feeling is entirely mental. Cas growls and wrenches himself away from the sensation.
"How can you say that?" Cas asks softly, like Dean had just dealt him a blow. Cas pulls back from the hug abruptly and Dean lets him go, watching helplessly as Cas shakes his head, his hands pulling his coat tighter around himself. "How can you say it
"Sam," Dean says flatly. "I'm man enough to admit that I'm five kinds of fucked up. I can't-" He makes a vague gesture with his hand. "Relationships. Dating. The domestic thing. I can't fucking do it and I've tried."
"You, ah... know where I might be able to find him?" Dean asked, trying to make the question seem casual. His chest felt tight, every nerve alight.
A tattoo would have been ideal, but was currently far beyond his means. He checked his sigils nightly, and sometimes during the day when he could find privacy, especially if the day had been damp.
A glimmer of recognition was dancing through him, something he hadn't really dared hope for suddenly playing out in front of his eyes.
"I'm getting a beer. Want anything?" He directs the question more at Kevin than at Sam, who is still regarding Dean with sympathy.
There's a hand on his neck and he can't tell if it's squeezing or caressing; he can't breathe. She leans in and he can't tell if she's smiling or snarling, can't tell if the room is bathed in the dying light of sunset or the glow of candles.
As expected, he shuts the door behind himself. The light comes on, Dean can see it streaming beneath the door, and a few moments later, he hears the shower running.
"If anyone is with Castiel when you find him, you may use whatever force you deem necessary to subdue them and bring them to justice," she said.
Speaking of, there was a rag thrown over the side of the tub, one end dipping down below the surface of the water. Castiel pulled it to fully submerge and found a small cake of soap hidden beneath. He grabbed it and lathered up, scrubbing first over his scent glands and removing all traces of the peppermint scent.
"I don't," he says, staring at the floor. His eyes burn. "I don't expect your forgiveness, because I know some things... some things are not forgiveable."
"My lord?" she called, knowing Castiel was usually awake at this hour and, more to the point, did not like people entering his room unannounced. Even she, who had been his handmaiden for several years, was not afforded that privilege, though she was one of the few allowed in at all. "I have your breakfast."
He's no longer a proud warrior of Heaven. He can't afford to be ashamed of this method of earning his bread.
He turned away and was greeted by Hannah and Balthazar, who were both watching him with worried expressions. They took up their positions at his sides and began escorting him back to his room.
He'd been trying very, very hard not to notice Em's naked chest, or their proximity, and while he'd done an excellent job when Emmanuel had been pissed, now all Dean could seem to focus on was the expanse of tanned skin and remember just how good Em had felt pressed up against him.
And from the look in Dean's eyes, there is no mistaking it for the love of a brother. Even so, it still surprises Cas when Dean lets go of one of his hands to gently cup his cheek, his thumb stroking the corner of Cas's mouth.
Dean startles awake. At first, he's not sure what wakes him, but then he hears it; a low, whimpering moan and the sound of creaking springs.
"Every year, it seems to get bigger and brighter, with more interesting things," she said. They stood in companionable silence for a moment, just watching the humanity mill about them, when Gilda spoke again.
And now it's late, nearing midnight, and Dean can't fucking turn his brain off long enough to sleep. He keeps thinking about what Sam had said and wondering-
Cas stumbles backwards but finds himself tackled to the floor anyway, though his back never lands on the floor of the panic room.
Emmanuel was? Em was sharp, resourceful, unflinching and unbreaking, and Dean was at once envious and in awe. He was half in love with him and he'd only known the man a week.
Dean’s expression twists, the heavy, uncomfortable emotions flaring hot and light and familiar, easier. Dean turns back to Cas and yanks his wrist free.
A car rolled up to the curb next to where Cas was walking. Cas paid it no mind, but it crawled along next to him and the window rolled down. Confused, he stopped and glanced over.
Cas has never, not once, failed to lock the door when he was showering. He never failed to check it multiple times, either.
"'Night, Johnny," Jordan says. Cas can hear him moving, then settling into his bed, and it's as if all noises are distant. Even the sound of the occasional car is dull.
"I am nobody's property," Em said, his voice so low and so wretched Dean had to struggle to hear him. When he finally parsed Em's meaning, he went still.
Loneliness too, though at the time he had convinced himself that it was for the best. He couldn't bear to bring the wrath of the fallen angels down on the Winchesters; surely he, a millennia-old being, could take care of himself.
"Yes, your Majesty," Ion said. "And if we find these... rebels who stole the prince from under our noses?"
"Fine," the demon says. He blinks, and Cas doesn’t need to see Dean’s eyes go wide to know that his own have gone black. "We do this the hard way."
wistfully, but what if there was water damage? What if some wire inside the phone had been jarred loose by street living and it couldn't make calls?
Cas is terrified. Of all the times he’d lost autonomy, this is the first he’s ever lost his body while his mind was still awake and aware.
Cas starts to pull his hand away, but Dean reflexively squeezes, suddenly panicking at his closing window of opportunity.
He thinks of Dean, eyes pained but resolute as he says "you can't stay". The words had been a devastating blow to a Cas that had still been reeling from the Fall, from the attacks by his siblings, from
"Since when have I shown an interest in mating?" Castiel asked, turning unhappily to face the others. Balthazar's expression sunk even lower.
anything, and Dean's not about to push Cas to talk if he's not ready. Dean still doesn't even know what to say beyond 'it wasn't your fault', hence the research.
Everything had gone kind of hazy after. Dean's next clear memory is of dispatching the last ghoul and then running to Castiel's side and falling to his knees. He remembers the weak beat of Cas's pulse beneath his fingers, the overwhelming relief followed by deep-seated fear that even if Cas wasn't dead
Cas's showering habits aren't as bad as they used to be, back when he first started staying with Dean and Sam, but it's still noticeable, especially after particular nightmares.
The demon climbs on top of him, straddling Dean’s hips and pinning down both of Dean’s arms. Dean struggles, glaring furiously up at the demon on top of him.
, and that rankles more than anything. He can do nothing to protect Dean, because it is he who currently poses the threat. For all the anger thrumming through his being, his
Dean's brain short circuited. He dropped the bunch of grapes through suddenly numb fingers and for the second time that day, food hit the floor and scattered.
"I never wanted anyone this way," Cas said, voice hoarse and eyes wide. "Sex was always something other people did, I never... but with you, somehow, I'm curious. And I want to be close to you, Dean, so close I don't know where I end and you begin."
"I can't be with you the way that you want," Cas says quietly. Each word is like a stab to the heart and Dean hunches his shoulders, shutting his eyes against the pain. "I'm
Emmanuel groped at Dean's chest, fingers blindly and clumsily seeking the edge of Dean's tunic to put them back on an even footing. Dean tore his hands away from Em's burning skin to assist, roughly yanking his tunic free of his breeches and pulling it over his head before discarding it carelessly.
"This," Em said breathlessly. He turned his head towards Dean, kissing him again, softer than the first time but still without much in the way of finesse. "Anything. Everything."
"I'm sorry about your breakfast," Em said, turning away and giving Dean quite a view of his muscular back. Dean watched, transfixed. "I'll pay for its replacement."
of Heaven, unable to return. He cut my throat and used my Grace to cast it, and sent me down to Earth in time to see all of Heaven fall. Because of me."
And the guilt. Sometimes, he's ashamed that he doesn't feel more guilty about what happened to April, to the human woman the reaper wore, but his first response when he thinks of that night is always fear rather than guilt. He knows it was
"I'm going to help Cas through this," Dean says, glancing back as though he can see the bathroom door through the closed window curtain. He completely misses the shock that crosses Sam's face.
"Johnny?" he says, getting up and walking quickly to Johnny's bedside. Jordan kneels and puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder. Johnny startles, jerking away from the touch and whirling to face Jordan.
There was no use ignoring the summons. More to the point, Queen Naomi wouldn't appreciate being kept waiting.
"You're so..." Em clenched around Dean's cock, pulling a surprised groan from Dean's mouth. Em moaned, pressing back further as though to take more of Dean into himself. "You feel so good."
"I know you well enough," Cas said, voice clipped. "I've watched you this past year, Dean. You are a good man, even if you don't have faith. I-"
“I heard you,” Dean snaps. Cas flinches. Dean immediately regrets his tone, but he couldn’t listen to Cas suggesting
he says, disbelieving. His mind is spinning, a pit opening up in the bottom of his figurative stomach. Of all the things the demon could have chosen to mock him with, to taint, to
Dean's eyes crinkled as he smiled and Castiel just watched, mesmerized by the play of sunlight against his profile. He could see Dean's freckles stand out starkly on his skin and he wanted to trace them with his fingertips, sketch constellations across Dean's face and seek out more, until he'd found enough places on Dean's body to draw an entire cosmos.
, as he had first suspected, happytime dream sounds. In the low light streaming in through the blinds of the motel room, Dean can see Cas's face scrunched together in fear, his chest rising and falling rapidly. Dean winces in sympathy and feels his irritation abruptly banked.
, and that's not because of me. That's because of you. You said everything I've done, I've done for love? Well, so have you."
"Thank fucking God I recognized her car," he said. He reached out and gave Cas a companionable slap on the shoulder. "Look, people who drive up in nice cars and offer you food or a place to sleep? Don't trust them. They're going to expect you to pay for it."
Sam had called for a medic and Cas had been loaded into the waiting ambulance. They'd been prepared, and those precious minutes saved might be all the difference in the world. Dean had ridden with Cas in the back of the ambulance as no one had dared tell him otherwise.
"No," Balthazar said, but there's something in his voice that told Castiel he has his suspicions. Castiel narrowed his eyes at the knight as he works on the buttons for the collar and chest, smoothing the material over the rougher cloth hidden beneath.
He could only stare as Emmanuel drew back, chewing and swallowing and looking suddenly uncertain. There was a beat of silence, one Dean didn't know how to fill, and Em dropped his gaze and Dean's wrist, withdrawing.
Dean doesn't think about the room across the hall, the one with navy sheets he himself picked out and laundered fresh a week ago. He doesn't think about the new, empty hangers hanging in the closet. He doesn't think about the small, cheap bookcase he found at the thrift store, or the dog-eared paperbacks from his own collection he quietly left there. He doesn't think about the recently dust-free nooks and crannies.
There had been a heavy but fragile peace in the motel room as Cas tucked himself into bed and Dean busied himself with the laptop, ostensibly to try finding their next hunt. In truth, he did little more than scroll aimlessly, following one link to another and another without really taking any of the information in.
"If this is supposed to be where I'm happiest, how can you think that doesn't include you?" Dean asked, stepping forward. Cas's eyes widened and he went still, just like that time Dean had found him by the stream in Purgatory.
"Dealing," he says. He takes a breath and lets it out slowly. "Listen, Sam... you should get another room."
The clouds were heavy with rain. Castiel kept an uneasy eye on them, still shivering from the effects of last night's storm. The day's humidity meant that his clothes still felt damp, from his coat to the navy blue hoodie, through the green plaid flannel and the thin black Tshirt he'd discovered in the Lost & Found bin at a small laundromat near where he'd Fallen. He'd had to discard his old suit, though he'd been unable to bear parting with his trenchcoat.
Instead, Dean tries to think about what to make for breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. He concentrates his thoughts on Sam slowly but surely getting better with every passing day.
"Anyone who's queer celebrates their perversions, companies try to cash in on 'pride', think of the children, yadda yadda yadda," Dean said, staring holes into the tabletop. Sam shot him a Look, but Dean ignored him.
"He'll be fine," Dean interrupts firmly, pulling his arm away from Sam's slack grip. He has to believe that, has to believe he didn't fail Cas completely. "He's got us."
Em cut himself off. He abruptly dropped his hands and took a step back from Dean, breathing heavily.
"'Found him'...?" Dean echoes. He breathes in sharply. "Tall guy, dark hair, stubble, blue eyes? Always real serious? Trenchcoat- wait, he might not... fuck."
Cas is silent for a moment. Dean would wonder if Cas had fallen asleep, but his body is tense and his breathing is uneven. Dean feels a sharp twinge of concern.
"'M fine, wrong pipe," Dean said, his face bright red from the strain. He was staring directly at Charlie. "Hey, Charlie, follow me for a minute, there's this thing I want to show you."
It was a bit gratifying to know that his instincts had been pretty spot-on when he'd initially been blindsided by the truth. He'd repeated that it wasn't Cas's fault, had asked permission before touching him, and done his best to not smother Cas. He'd let Cas choose, let Cas set his boundaries.
"Take my son's guard with you. Keep a close eye on him. If Balthazar attempts to make contact with Castiel, he may lead us directly to him," Naomi said. "Have Hannah reassigned to the laundry. If she makes any attempt to leave the castle, follow her."
"I am doing what is best for you, Castiel," Naomi said. "You'll thank me one day, once you finally accept what you are."
"What do you mean?" Cas asks. Dean stares at him, trying to get his words in some kind of sensible order and trying not to let his hopes rise too high.
"I'm not even going to ask," he said. Gilda laughed and moved to stand next to him, looking out over the crowd.
One useful thing he had learned, something he hadn't considered; it helped, sometimes, to talk things out. Write things down that you couldn't say out loud.
Dean swallows thickly. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for whatever he's going to see beyond the door.
He keeps the bills tucked away in his jeans pocket, stuffed all the way to the bottom. They feel safer there, even though his backpack is always with him. Perhaps a few more days, and he'll have enough money to buy a bus ticket going anywhere, with some left over for food and drink. In any case, he can't very well stay here. He's too close to Kansas, and though he knows there's no more danger of running into Dean in Denver than in, say, New York, the proximity worries him.
"You're gorgeous," Dean said. Em smiled, dropping his hands to Dean's breeches and tugging pointedly.
He stumbles through the aftermath of slaughter. Most of the faces he recognizes. Some he even knows their names and some he doesn't know at all, which just makes him feel sicker. He had killed them and he couldn't even remember who they were.
He just needed Cas. He needed him to choose, needed him naked and pliant, needed him chaste and safe.
The knight nodded. Castiel wiped his suddenly sweaty palms on his thighs, not caring if it damaged the fabric.
"Got your stuff," he calls out. There's no response, but Dean can hear movement on the other side. He sighs, suddenly exhausted, and turns to lean back against the door.
"You can't," Dean burst out. Cas looked up, startled and confused. Dean shook his head and backed up a step, closer to the door of Castiel's bedroom.
Dean and Sam return to the motel room two hours later to find everything exactly as they left it. Dean sighs when he hears the shower still running and sets the bag containing Cas's dinner on the nightstand.
A portable radio, a thrift store find Dean had restored and presented to Cas after reading that silence was the enemy of healing. Particularly in showers, where the limited distractions made it all too easy for the mind to wander down dark paths. Cas treasured it.
"What are we, Dean?" Cas asked softly. Dean could hear the underlying question, the 'what do you want us to be?' "If we're not family-"
This time, it's only Cas, a ring of salt, and the fading remnants of light left behind by a spirit put to rest.
at her hands... and Dean had kicked him out. Dean had told him flatly "you need to go", no explanation, no support, too wrapped up in his own upset at the
"Dean..." Cas says softly. He can feel the Entity's malevolence rising and the urge to get Dean out, to get him to safety, far outweighs any concern Castiel might have for himself. "It's all right, I-"
"Dean," Cas breathes. Dean must sense that something’s changed, because he falters, knife lowering as his eyes widen. Cas knows his time is short, the demon already rallying to take control again. Cas grabs the hem of Dean’s shirt and pulls. "Do it."
Dean drank him in like Cas's mouth was made of ambrosia. He tried desperately to ignore the way Cas was arching into him, pressing their bodies closer, closer. This wasn't arousal or sexual desire, just a pure, sensual need for touch. To make this real.
Raising Dean from Hell might have been Heaven-mandated, but Dean had heard from Chuck's own mouth that nothing after had been. Dean might've been the catalyst for
"I don't have time to do everything I want to do to you tonight," Dean said, voice low and husky. He dipped his head and mouthed at Cas's neck, nipping lightly with his teeth above the collar of Cas's robe. Cas made a small noise and tilted his head, offering more of his neck to Dean's lips. Dean groaned. "What do you want from me right now?"
The door creaks open and Cas peers around it, blinking tiredly at Dean, his hair a mess of cowlicks. Dean smiles and holds up the notebook. Cas looks at it and frowns, puzzled.
He closes his eyes and listens to the sound of the rain and Jordan digging through his backpack. There's a quiet noise of triumph, and then Jordan is back with a bottle of generic cough syrup.
He'd been in and out in five minutes. Jordan took a little longer, but Cas hadn't minded the wait. It gave him the chance to sit for a moment and just breathe.
"I don't believe you," Cas said. Dean was abruptly struck by the urge to laugh, loud and incredulous, and simultaneously struck by a wave of anger.
The words taste like a lie on his tongue. Cas has read that it's supposed to help, this positive self-talk, but the words still ring false in his ears.
"I don't know," Dean says tightly, staring at the empty shower stall like it's personally responsible for Cas's vanishing act. He steps forward and yanks the handle to turn off the water, not even caring as icy water soaks his sleeve. "But he's probably doing something really fucking stupid."
"Do you ever wonder..." he asked, wondering how to word the question. "What if things don't work out? If it doesn't last?"
"You can't," Dean said again, voice low. His fear was overtaking his anger. Damnit, he was trying to
"I'm angry that I was suddenly too 'delicate' for things I'd done the week before. I'm angry that any time I dared be upset, it would be dismissed as hysteria because of my designation. I'm angry that I went from being treated like a person to being treated like an object-"
"Thank you, Dean," he says. The words are heavy, more resonant than they should be, and Dean feels them as they come to rest on his shoulders. He nods again.
Cas's hand had returned to cup Dean's face. Dean found himself leaning into the touch, spellbound by Cas's eyes.
As if on cue, Castiel's stomach gurgled. He put a hand over his belly as if hoping that would fill the emptiness. When he'd Fallen, he'd had little money in his pockets, and it hadn't lasted beyond his first meal as a human. He'd been searching for dropped change and bills ever since, but the Twix bar he'd bought from a vending machine earlier that day hadn't stretched far.
Slowly, like he's not sure if he wants to or maybe he's being teased, Cas turns to look at the bar. His expression flickers for a moment, something unidentifiable racing across his face before his expression just shuts down.
He stopped. He looked down, smoothing his hands over the blanket that had covered him during the night.
Cas tries to block, to dodge, but he can't bring himself to attack. This isn't Dean, it's the Mark, and-
Dean snorts. He can’t help it, it’s either laugh or get angry, and he’s well past the point of shouting his way through any emotional conversation.
"Wait here," Dean said as he pulled out carefully. A rush of body fluids followed him and Cas wrinkled his nose in disgust.
He had no memory of pulling the blanket over him and, when he shifted and looked down at his bed, he could see that he'd fallen asleep atop his own. The blanket covering him had to be Dean's, and since Castiel highly doubted he'd somehow sleepwalked over to Dean's bed to steal the blanket, Dean must have been the one who covered him with it.
"I should have a spare set of PJ’s," Dean says, backing away from Cas and making to stand. Cas follows him up and gently grabs his wrist.
He turns incredulous eyes to the other bed and sees Cas. He's kicked the blankets off, rolled over and, despite still being asleep, is rutting against the mattress.
Cas is silent for a long minute. Then, finally, he cradles the notebook to his chest, still not looking at Dean. His mouth opens, then shuts, and he glances up as if to ask permission to speak.
"I should've said 'no', I should've resisted, I-" He looks up at April and his voice dies in his throat. Her eyes are wide in shock, mouth agape.
There's a small, niggling voice in the back of his head, reminding him that he did in fact tell Cas to stay behind. He did threaten to lock Cas in his office, but Cas had been determined and stubborn and Dean had backed down. The thought of
"Got the room for one more day," Sam says. He makes to move passed Dean into the room, but Dean shakes his head and ushers him outside. Sam's eyes flick towards the bathroom, where the sound of running water can be heard, and then steps back. Dean follows and shuts the motel room door, leaving them in the parking lot.
Whether he had Dean for one night or a thousand, he didn't think he would come to regret it. He hadn't been completely oblivious to the looks Dean had been giving him, though he'd chosen to ignore them at first. Being an omega prince made him a fine prize for any nobleman, knight, or visiting royalty, and Castiel had learned early on how to identify an alpha's lust when it was directed at him. Sometimes, that knowledge was his only weapon and only defense, since Naomi had repeatedly refused to let him carry a knife.
"Cas, wait," Dean says, closing the motel door behind him. Cas looks up. Dean swallows. "We gotta talk about this. Decide what to do."
He hadn’t expected this slow seduction. He hadn’t expected Dean to want him, and now Dean’s danger is tenfold because he
“Don’t do that,” Dean says. “I don’t give a damn what you think I need, don’t you ever-” His voice cuts off. Cas nods slowly.
He laid sucking, worshipful little kisses to the pads of Em's fingers. He let his mouth linger on Emmanuel's index finger, tracing a line down to Em's palm with his tongue just to feel Emmanuel shiver.
It's been two weeks since their first kiss, late that night in the library. Since then there have been more kisses; chaste, sweet things Dean always asks his consent for, save the one or two times that Cas himself initiated. Dean trusts him to know his own limits, never doubtfully asks if Cas is sure, just smiles warmly and draws Cas close with hands that never wander.
"I understand," he says simply. He is of a similar mind about April herself, after all. Even if he doesn't blame her for the way her body was used against him, it doesn't change the fact that it's still her he sees when he closes his eyes and her touch that haunts his worst memories. He's still scared of her, even though he knows the reaper is long gone to Purgatory.
what wears Castiel’s face. It’s trickery of the worst sort, the demon preying on a bond and trust that does not belong to it, stealing permission Dean would never knowingly give it.
And if a bit of the demonic taint darkening Dean's soul dissipated back into pure light, neither man was any the wiser.
"That's the plan. If you want me to," he says. He looks at the book for a moment. "Or I could just watch you- watch over you."
"You don't? 'Desire women', that is," Dean asked. His heart was pounding in his chest, his head light with sudden possibility-
"Your turn," Em said, bringing Dean's attention back to his face. Emmanuel was flushed, expression almost embarrassed but pleased, and Dean couldn't resist leaning over to kiss him again, then a second time for good measure, more tongue than lips.
"It's almost seven-thirty, Dean," he says. Dean laughs and shakes his head. Sam chuckles and glances over at the bar.
Emmanuel followed his lead. He opened his mouth at the gentle prodding of Dean's tongue, making a small noise in the back of his throat when Dean slid his tongue just along the inside of his lower lip.
'His own terms' might very well mean 'never'. And even if it doesn't... maybe that's what Cas needs right now. Maybe he needs to swear 'never' and have that be his truth. Maybe he'll reconsider later. Maybe he won't.
Castiel relaxed into Dean's hold, sore in places he'd never been and sleepy, but indescribably content.
"So I’ll take mine, then," Dean says, turning to unzip his duffle and presumably pull out his pajamas. The demon stalks closer and grabs Dean’s wrist, firm but gentle. Dean stills, hardly even seems to breathe.
Castiel drank, momentarily overcome by a wave of warmth that had little to do with the drink in his hands. It was good, certainly, spiced and with a pleasant burn all the way to the stomach, but Cas couldn't keep his eyes or his thoughts off of Dean.
Cas's gaze flicked to Dean as if to assess his reaction. He looked back to Sam, opened his mouth, and didn't say anything.
"Yes," Cas says. He hesitates, then admits in a quiet voice. "Nobody's ever asked if they could kiss me. They just..." He shrugs a shoulder and looks away from Dean.
It's not something Dean likes to think about, a pang of guilt hitting him hard every time he sees that haunted, hunted look in Cas's eyes.
"It is," Cas agreed, breathing going ragged as Dean started popping the buttons on his shirt, baring his skin inch by inch.
The ghoul had thrown Cas into the wall. Dean could still hear the dull 'thunk' as Cas's head impacted the stone, could remember the bright splash of red the sound had left behind.
"Get in," he says. Cas's sheets are sweaty and wrecked. Dean, having fallen asleep on top of his blankets, hadn't even mussed the comforter.
"I proved that well enough when Raphael tried to re-start it. The power I sought to end the war and keep humanity safe corrupted me." He can feel a lump in his throat. "I did... many terrible things."
Cas lays a hand gently on Dean's cheek and kisses him chastely. Just as quickly, he pulls back, leaving Dean open-mouthed and dumbfounded.
Later, neither of them could say who had moved first, but the next thing Dean knew, his mouth was on Castiel's, and they were kissing. Gentle at first, then deep and soft, twelve years of longing and pining conveyed in the press of lips to lips and tongue to tongue.
An extra, he means an extra. He certainly didn't make it for Crowley who, despite having been almost turned human, never quite made it and isn't human enough to require feeding. Thank... well, not God, but
But he hadn't been able to let go of hunting, and he'd dragged Lisa and Ben along with him into danger.
"Cas, you're not making sense," Dean says slowly. This has something to do with the bar, he's sure, but he can't quite see the connection.
Cas sticks his head under the water and lets it slowly soak his hair. He keeps his eyes closed against the downpour, head bowed slightly to protect his face, and he tries not to think.
"Where are you-" he started, but he didn't even finish the question before Dean was back, with something Cas recognized as Dean's tunic in hand.
He's learned that Jordan had been nearly eighteen when he'd been kicked out of doors for refusing to play at being the daughter his parents had always believed him to be. He'd learned of the young man's difficulties in securing employment, and that a part-time minimum-wage job couldn't keep you off the street for long when you had no savings and no family support.
It was the little things. A good drink when he was distracted, a listening ear when he was angry. A tinderbox and a quick lesson on how to use it. A few strips of jerky and a warm smile.
Task completed, Dean gave himself a perfunctory wipe-down with the cleanest part of the tunic he could find and then tossed it aside. He reached for Cas and carefully pulled him to a sitting position, much to Castiel's displeasure.
"I've got enough to cover it. Go after him," Sam says. Dean nods briefly in thanks, then whirls around and follows Cas out the door.
Cas doesn't seem to have it in him to argue. He just shakes his head but makes no protest as Dean follows him the rest of the way to the motel.
Once they arrived at the hospital, Cas had been taken from Dean to begin treatment. Minutes had passed like hours, until finally an exhausted doctor had come out to tell Dean that his husband was in a coma and had been placed in ICU for the night.
Dean chuckled and boosted himself up on one arm enough to kiss him, slow and lazy and without intent.
"Dean," Em groaned, arching against him. His hands dropped from where they had been exploring the broad expanse of Dean's back to free himself from the confines of his breeches, but his hurried attempts at untying them only resulted in a tangle of knots.
He doesn't want to go. Still, he trails after Sam and Dean, his heart pounding in his ears and his palms sweating.
Cas breathes in again and hunches over on himself, shuffling his feet closer together and pulling at his clothes.
Dean realizes Cas is still waiting for an answer, tension in every line of his frame. Dean clears his throat.
"Dean," Cas cried sharply; warning or exaltation, Dean didn't know. He kept up the movements of his head and hands, pleasuring Cas through his orgasm as the priest shuddered and came apart beneath him. Dean swallowed him down, all he had to give, and sucked gently at the spent flesh.
"I've never seen anything like it," he said honestly. Gilda nodded, making a soft humming noise in the back of her throat.
He blinks and shakes his head, willing the images away. When he looks again, he sees that the bedside lamp is on and the duvet is royal purple.
What if the phone is too damaged to work? Johnny had always claimed it was just a dead battery, every time he'd pulled his phone from his pocket and just
"Sure...?" he said. He gestured to the plate still heaped with fruit between them, clearly meaning 'help yourself', and twisted another grape off the bunch he held.
"It wasn't so long ago that omegas were considered chattel," he said. "Some people would prefer we still were."
"Let me?" Cas asked, breathless. Dean swallowed and nodded, bringing his hand back up to brace on the other side of Cas's head.
It still feels a little uncomfortable, laying himself bare like this for Cas. Dean’s more than comfortable with his body and laying his skin bare for a lover, but this emotional nakedness is new.
"So..?" Dean asked, as if sensing Castiel's thoughts. Cas could feel his voice as a low rumble all down his back and he smiled lazily at the far wall.
Dean grinned and climbed back into the bed slowly, letting Emmanuel look his fill. There was something so powerful about seeing such naked desire in a lover's eyes, especially Em's eyes, and Dean reveled in it.
"Dean..?" he says, his voice as hoarse as if he'd been shouting for days. Dean's worry softens and he moves back to help Castiel sit up.
Dean just has to buckle down and do his best, and ignore the feeling that he's failed Cas horrifically by not being here sooner.
"Thought that was why you bought me dinner," he said, reaching down and breaking off a few grapes. He popped one into his mouth and bit, letting it explode on his tongue. "You gonna share it with me?"
Some especially persistent alphas had been more interested in his crown than in Castiel himself and simply saw his body as an easy way in to the Elysian royal family.
Castiel sighed and continued staring out of his window, past the citadel to the greater city beyond, and then to the darkness surrounding the city, the wilderness and the roads where there were no lights.
"Sam?" Dean says. Sam's got John's journal open on his lap; out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see him flip through several pages. Sam runs his hand through his hair again.
"But the person I'm in love with..." Cas glanced briefly at Dean and then looked away. "I'm in love with a man. So yes, 'gay angels' do exist, if my having a male vessel and being in love with a man qualifies."
He's struck by a sudden memory of Cas in the brothel, with a similar wide-eyed, frightened look to the one he's wearing now, except this seems
Maybe until Cas feels ready, Dean can give him a different, more private outlet that isn't simply keeping it locked inside. Dean knows all about repression and that it does shit for anybody.
"Cas, you don't have to do this," Dean says quietly, urgently. Cas sets his jaw and pulls his arm from Dean's grasp.
"I wanted it, too," he says. Dean looks at him sharply. Cas meets his stare with a calm he doesn’t really feel. Inside, his heart is beating rapidly, nervous and anticipatory.
Dean looks away and draws his knife. He forces his thoughts away from Cas and onto the now imminent fight. He breathes.
Em fisted his hands in the blankets, hips stuttering. Dean redoubled his efforts, whispering sweet nonsense in Em's ear.
"Dean, what are you saying?" Cas asks, voice low. He doesn't dare hope, but he can't stop his heart from pounding, his breath from shaking. He feels absolutely invincible and like a feather could knock him over and shatter him to pieces. He's on a great precipice and about to be shoved over the edge with no way of knowing if he's going to fly or fall.
, Captain?" Naomi asked, turning to Ion with that same dark glare. Ion inclined his head respectfully.
Cas hasn't spoken to him about it since that night, a little over a week ago now. Dean knows it's not over; it can't be, not so easily. There are still days where Cas walks into the kitchen in the early hours of the morning, hair soaking wet from the shower and all the considerable hot water in the bunker used up. There are moments when Dean catches Cas looking at him, expression a cross between wary and speculative, like he's waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Maybe Cas even wanted sex, though if that numbered among Cas's wants, Dean had a feeling it was so far down on the list it hardly mattered.
Dean starts swaying back and forth, gently, rubbing one hand on Cas's upper back. He'd done this for Sam when Sam was a baby and fussy and he hopes it has the same calming effect on Cas. Cas is still locked up, hiccuping and shaking, body curled tightly in on himself. It's not exactly a comfortable or reciprocal hug, but Dean has hope.
"She was collateral damage. The reaper went through her to get to you, and that's on the reaper, not you," Dean says. Cas's eyes narrow and he looks at Dean sharply.
"It's not like that," Dean says. He clears his throat again. "Sex is... when it's something you want, it's really, er, good."
"... all right," Cas says, looking at his packed bag and then back to Dean. Dean lets out a breath, relieved. Cas turns his gaze to the notebook still clenched in Dean's hands. "You brought me a notebook?"
"Lift up," he said, looking up to make eye contact with Em. He tugged gently on Emmanuel's breeches to make sure he got the idea.
Cas silently gathers clean pajamas from his duffle bag while Dean busies himself with the pens and pad of paper on the nightstand between two of the beds. It feels awkward to watch Cas directly, so Dean does it out of the corner of his eye, watching Cas as he walks to the bathroom. Then, in the doorway, he stops and turns.
Well. He's certainly not sleeping tonight. The worry alone would keep him awake, and if Cas needs him... if there's
Emmanuel bucked, chasing the touch, breathing heavily against Dean's mouth. Dean kissed him one more time, sweetly, then began trailing his mouth down the side of the omega's neck. He nipped, careful not to break the skin, then kissed and laved each spot with his tongue, breathing in deep lungfuls of Em's scent.
"I got it," he says, rather unnecessarily as he's sure Cas isn't going to be getting up for anything as unimportant as the door. He checks the peephole, and sure enough, it's Sam, carrying a few bags from the local Walmart.
If anything happened to Cas's soul, if he was indeed damned for laying with a demon... Dean would protect him. He'd sequester Cas in his own personal Hell and ensure that nothing touched him. He'd create a Heaven for them in the bowels of the Pit.
White-hot pain lances through him and it's his turn to gasp as he falls in agony, his wings burning into the dirt around him.
"I used to wake up like that a lot," Dean says, forcing himself to say it loudly enough to be heard. "After Hell. Four or five nights a week, I'd wake up and I wouldn't know where I was. I'd think I was still down there."
Cas responded in kind. His hands laid fluttering touches all over Dean; his face, his shoulders, down his back, up his sides. It was as if Cas didn't know quite where he wanted to put his hands.
Dean sighs and closes his book. He banishes it to the far side of the table with the rest of the rejects and reaches for a new one.
"Ma'am, we'll explain but first we should get out of here," Sam says, steering her towards the hallway after Cas and Dean. Dean's at Cas's elbow, hovering but not touching. Cas distantly appreciates the distinction; he doesn't think he can handle touch right now, no matter how kindly meant.
It feels wrong to have this conversation half in the hallway. The subject matter feels too fragile for any errant breeze that might blow by, no matter how delicately they dance around the topic.
"I wouldn't have followed her home," Cas says, almost talking to himself. "I would have taken my chances with the storm. I would've hidden somewhere none of my siblings could find me. I would've slept on the couch. I would have-"
The door clicks shut behind them, sealing them in. Castiel is struggling against the demon’s hold, has been since the Laundromat, but no matter what force of will he brings to bear, it does no good. He redoubles his efforts now, knowing his time is running out.
He clears his throat and leans forward, mustering up what he hopes is a sincere smile, hoping Cas can't see how strained it is.
Both men turned to see Charlie, waving excitedly and working her way through the crowd towards them, Gilda in tow.
is, is there any chance Miss Green could have tied herself up so she wouldn't be suspected of trying to push her boyfriend out the window?"
"I do," Castiel affirms. The space between them seems smaller somehow, shrinking as the seconds tick by, though Cas could not honestly say which of them was moving.
Cas had gone through Hell, literally and figuratively, had died time and time again, and he had done it for the world, for
"You stupid son of a bitch," Dean says, voice thick. There's no venom in the words, only fear. "You can't go off by yourself like that."
"Hey, Charlie, Gilda," Dean said in greeting as the two ladies came close enough he didn't need to shout. "Good to see you two."
Cas doesn't want to talk about this. He doesn't even want to think about it, but that choice has already been taken from him. With the memories having been brought so strongly to the forefront of his mind, it'll be a miracle if he thinks of anything else tonight.
The shower runs for a few more minutes. Dean listens and when the water finally turns off, he heaves himself up away from the door.
he can do to make this ordeal easier on Cas, Dean's willing to do it. Even if all he can do is hold Cas's fucking hand and listen to him after a nightmare (and Dean's certain there
He breathed in deeply, then let the uneven breath out. His eyes stung and he rubbed at them with his free hand, thinking uncharitable thoughts about the dry air circulating the hospital.
Dean had never dared let himself think about it. It had seemed too far out of reach, like a star shining brightly you wished upon every night but knew you would never touch.
"I want you," Dean said. He couldn't say those other three words, not just yet, but he hoped Cas heard them all the same. He kept his touch gentle and reverent, trying to show the only way he knew how what he couldn't say.
"In our true forms, we have neither sex nor gender," Cas continued, eyes boring into Dean's. "Over time, an angel might come to prefer one gender over the others. Anael preferred the female form, so when she Fell, she chose to be born female. Balthazar favored the male form purely for... recreational purposes. Often with several different partners. Gabriel enjoys being both, or neither, or taking a vessel he can present whatever way he chooses that day. Others of my siblings will simply take whatever vessel is available to them."
"It wasn't-" His voice breaks. He covers his face with his hands and tries to just breathe, tries to focus on the white noise of the radio and the heat soaking into his skin from the shower. It doesn't help.
Cas can't move. He feels frozen in place, the air so cold it burns his lungs when he breathes it in. When he breathes out, he can see a mist form in front of his face. The landlady is looking around, confused, while Sam looks with naked horror on his face.
"He'll come out when he's ready," Dean says, though the words ring hollow to his own ears. Sam isn't convinced either, going by the glance he shoots the bathroom door.
"Used to do this for Sammy when he was little," Dean says to fill the silence. He moves the damp, cold rag to Cas's forehead and lays it carefully across. The angle is awkward because of how Cas is laying, more on his hair than his skin, but Cas shivers and relaxes gratefully.
Dean shook himself. Writing helped. Not quite the same way a bottle did, but there was a different kind of catharsis in writing than there was in drinking yourself numb.
If nothing else, it reminded him that once upon a time, Dean had had faith in him. It didn't hurt that the coat was an extra layer of protection from the elements, thin though it was.
"Yes," Em said, so seriously that Dean shivered. He'd meant it as a joke, a lighthearted call-and-response, but Em's answer was anything but.
"No," he says, voice high and strained. He coughs and shakes his head. "No. Cas, it's Dean. It's just Dean, not-" He shakes his head again, lost for words.
"I'm not doing it, Sam. I'm not telling him," Dean says. He snaps his gaze back to his younger brother, narrowing his eyes and raising a finger warningly. "And don't you even-"
He had thought it was enough, that true happiness was simply in telling Dean that he loved him. That joy pales in comparison to finding out that the love he'd thought impossible is returned.
"Dirty?" Dean whispers. Cas hunches in on himself a little and doesn't look at Dean. Dean shakes his head. "No. Sex doesn't make you feel like that."
“I won’t,” he promises. It’s Cas’s turn to breathe deeply. “I really do enjoy intimacy with you, Dean. It’s just that, for me, intimacy very rarely takes the form of sex.”
There's the sharp report of a gun. April dissolves into smoke. The hand choking him vanishes and Cas sucks in air, wheezing and coughing as blessed oxygen fills his lungs. Dean's suddenly
Even so, Castiel had never been as nervous or as excited to take a bath. And, regardless of any other plans he had for the night, he hadn't had a proper wash since he'd left the palace. Brief scrubdowns using a washbasin and rag hardly counted.
His hands are shaking. He swallows heavily and sets down the bag of salt to try and pick the lock. Dean and Sam have been teaching him how, and the lessons pay off when the lock springs open less than a minute later.
"You didn't have a choice. You weren't given one," Dean says thickly. "You weren't... just because she never said the threat out loud doesn't mean it wasn't there. Doesn't mean you weren't... forced."
"Em...?" he said, mouth dry. Emmanuel didn't respond, just gently tugged Dean's wrist as he leaned forward, never once looking away from Dean. He opened his mouth and ate the grape from Dean's hand, his lips and teeth barely brushing Dean's fingertips.
"Cassie..." Balthazar said, shocked and aghast. Cas couldn't face him. He'd never been a particularly skilled liar and his oldest friend would be able to read the truth on his face if he looked up.
He'd had his fair share of lovers. He'd had an even greater number of conquests. All that desire paled in comparison to this bone-deep
It occured to Cas that Dean was waiting for a response. Dean hadn't given him an order or lain out an itinerary; he'd as good as asked Cas what he wanted to do.
He tries to focus on the white noise of the radio, the songs and voices almost audible but just beyond his reach.
He wouldn’t trade seeing Cas’s sleepy, grumpy face in the mornings for anything in the world, much less a string of one-night-stands.
"No worse than usual," Cas says. He looks at his hands and rubs them against each other. Dean spreads his hands.
"Security cameras catch anything?" Dean asks, motioning up to one placed discreetly in the corner, looking down the hall. The landlady shakes her head.
It wasn't until later in the day, as they were passing a stall selling leather goods, that the full impact of that morning hit Castiel.
There's an apology caught on the lump in his throat, but just then, the door to the office they've been hiding in smashes open.
"Another freaking apartment building..." Dean grumbles. "These places all look the same. Makes me feel like I've been here before or something."
Dean shivers and unlocks the door to the motel room. Cas darts inside and heads immediately for the bathroom. Dean opens his mouth to speak, but whatever words he would have said die on his tongue as the bathroom door swings shut behind Cas. The lock clicks and the light turns on.
he feels when he looks into the bathroom nearly knocks him off his feet. The things he was most afraid of aren't there; looking around, he sees no blood, no signs of any kind of struggle or fall, no limp bodies curled in a corner. The shower curtain is open, water spraying the clean white tiles, leaving no place for a nasty surprise to hide.
"Yes I do," Cas growls, even as his heart trembles and the bile rises in his throat. He forces himself to move forward, wishing he had something stronger than his customary trenchcoat to protect him. He stumbles into the apartment with less than his usual grace, limbs heavy and uncoordinated.
"Come on," he says, hauling Cas up. Cas stumbles as he's pulled to his feet but goes willingly, one hand at his neck as though he can open his airway just by holding on.
Dean stares determinedly at the TV screen, though if asked he can't honestly say he has any idea what's going on. Or what show they're watching now that the Tom & Jerry marathon is over.
Dean shifts uneasily on his feet. His strained smile melts completely as he looks around again, but the view doesn't change. Bare walls, bare floor, even the bed is void of personality. The same white sheets and white pillowcases you can find at any cheap motel, the moth-eaten down comforter spread on top. There are no books on the nightstand, no knickknacks on the shelves.
Breakfast had been bad enough and had left him still hungry besides. He'd spent most of his day in the garage, avoiding both Sam and Cas, though a sandwich and beer had appeared mysteriously on his workbench later in the afternoon. Dean suspected Sam's hand in it, a peace offering after the absolute fiasco that morning had been.
"Oh, yes," Gilda said. She folded her arms across her chest, her smile carrying echoes of old pain. "Especially at first, I wondered about that a lot. But whether I had her for a day or for a decade, or if we end up taking that step and spending the rest of our lives together, I'd still be grateful for the time we've had."
It was his own bad decisions that had led him to Purgatory, after all. To making a deal with Crowley, to try and shoulder the burden of stopping Raphael's attempt at re-starting the Apocalypse on his own instead of asking for help.
"Cas is here," Dean repeated, almost to himself. His mind was racing now, filled with all the thoughts he'd been repressing these last few weeks, the things that hurt too much to want.
Holding each other at night. Waking up together in the mornings. Cuddling on the couch while they watched movies. Making dinner together. Bathing together. Going on a drive. Eating dinner out with their hands clasped under the table.
"Going somewhere?" he asks, staring pointedly at the bag. Cas follows his gaze and Dean can hear him shift uncomfortably.
Things he can see. Three framed photos on the wall of the apartment's current occupants; one of a young couple smiling in front of a castle with black, cheap looking hats adorned with two large dark circles on top. A group shot of the young couple and another of similar age at some kind of restaurant. A photo in front of a gazebo, the woman in a white dress and the man in a suit.
"We knew this day would come," Balthazar finally said, more to himself than anyone else. The expression on his face was pained and drawn, resigned and wistful all at once.
"She must have been so scared," he says after a moment, softly. Dean nods, feeling his eyes burning again, hearing what Cas doesn't say.
"I had hoped she would give up," Castiel muttered. Naomi's attempts to find him an alpha had started the moment Castiel had presented and had only slowed down once he'd hit thirty and was no longer young and beautiful enough to be a proper trophy. And, he thought with no little satisfaction, when word of his 'difficult nature' had spread.
. With a strangled shout, she practically throws herself up against the invisible barrier created by the salt line, slamming her hands against it like she has any hope of cracking it.
"What just happened?" Dean asks, already standing and reaching to take out his wallet. Sam shakes his head helplessly, but he's already waving Dean off.
Cas's cry of pain still wakes Dean up some nights. The memory is more chilling now, with Dean's new knowledge of the context of what had already been a pretty horrific moment.
," Sam starts, making a vague, displeased gesture at the laptop on Dean's lap. "You better not have gotten any viruses on it, jerk."
"I'm sorry to intrude," he said, shifting on his feet. "This was meant to be your space, but it's not quite finished yet. When I sensed you had arrived in Heaven..." His voice trailed off, like he wasn't sure where to finish the thought.
"You love me," Dean says, testing the words on his tongue carefully. "And the only reason you don't want to-" His words fail him for a moment, mind scrambling to come up with something less juvenile than 'date'. "-be with me is because you don't want to have sex with me?"
"Just... don't joke about sex in front of him," he says. He swallows. "And don't talk about Detroit."
He lowered his head and took just the tip of Em's dick into his mouth. Em's eyes flew open, hips arching uncontrollably to chase the wet heat, but Dean had been prepared. He slid one arm across Em's hips and held him steady as he lowered his head down, down.
