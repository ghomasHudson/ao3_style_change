It wasn’t bleeding any more
“ Yeah, well, I only found out there were Disney movies like last week, so…” Bucky muttered. And then he looked up at Steve, and then at Tony, attempting a more sober tone when he said again, “I’m sorry.”
“J?” He called out, nervously. He really didn’t have the vaguest recollection of JARVIS announcing anyone, this time.
I will be posting a very short epilogue immediately after this, but, for all intents and purposes - IT'S FINISHED!
...Maybe.
Steve tilted his chin up.
“Captain Rogers!” Someone cheered, from what seemed like such a long way away…
“Fuck, Tony, you’re incredible, you’re beautiful and dazzling and -
Thankfully, he managed to avoid stepping in anything unpleasant as they crept those final few feet, between a cluster of booths, to far left corner of the room. From here they could see there was actually a gap, between the bar running along the left-hand wall, and the bar running along the back – a narrow walkway that would’ve been entirely invisible, if the little door there hadn’t been open a crack, letting just enough light leak through…
...And now, even as he recognised that danger, it seemed he was still just
Wondering if it was true, and if that in turn made him a bad person.
The elevator came to a soft stop beneath their feet, and Tony glanced up at Steve in time to see Steve staring straight ahead with a very specific focus.
“Steve?” Tony said cautiously, stepping closer.
Steve snuggled closer into Tony’s lap, his eyes already closing.

He knew he’d just glared at it for what seemed like hours after Steve finally hung up – for long enough that his arm actually ached, when he finally got to moving it.

But that was back when he’d been sensibly thinking about this as closure. That was when he’d been thinking this thing had some sort of forward function, that it was supposed to serve as a clean break… Back when it was meant to be a statement of some kind.
But, at the time, it really felt like there was nothing else...

“Seriously,
A hot burst of denial - because, surely,
Looking at her, Tony had a sudden bad taste in his mouth. An unclean feeling that only got worse as he thought through everything she’d just said… somehow, the thoughtlessness of her actions, the casual assumption of her own rightness… it was more uncomfortable than hearing about the family of power-hungry slave drivers, in a way.
And Steve knew he didn’t have to undress any more than that. He didn’t
He was scared to death of telling Tony how he really felt anyway – scared of the potential rejection, scared of screwing it up, scared of losing what little they had already.
Oh, God, he couldn’t say it now, could he? There just weren’t words for this, there was no way to explain, no way to make Tony see-
“Yeah, I think so,” Steve replied, with that exact same edge on his voice,
And when Steve thought back to those first few hesitant meetings - to Tony trying so hard to sit upright, or pacing in sharp little lines at a safe distance from Steve, continuously dragging himself back to the point… Steve couldn’t help feeling a bit of progress, looking at him now.
“Are you still mad at me?” Bucky asked, casually, as they waited for the gentle click of JARVIS unlocking the entrance.
Steve actually groaned into the pillow. Oh, God, how had that even happened? He remembered
to me every time you had to cover up one of those missions, every time I asked you what you were thinking about, every time you mentioned my dad or the commandos or the fall of SHIELD. You met up with other people, secretly, and you discussed
Of course now, like everything else, it just made him think of Steve.

Tony broke out into a surprised grin. There was something immediately validating about that specific compliment, something that moved him before he’d had a chance to think about why.
And Tony was forced to give the most unnerving answer he could think of.
His smile broke into a grin, as he typed out his response,
By now, he’d completely forgotten his plans to take notes when this happened - but he was very aware of it happening.
The fact that Steve could still feel Tony’s heart beating under his skin…

“Oh, sorry, I forgot you were in that boy scout troop too,” Tony replied breezily-
“We’ll give it a few minutes and we’ll head back to the room” Tony said, eventually.

“It’s not that simple,” he blurted, looking away from Steve. “It’s not just…
And, now that he thought of it, a strange desire to look at that sketch again…
And, okay, Tony knew that Steve was the only reason he’d been there in the first place. That he’d basically forgotten Bucky even existed, for large parts of the day – which was one of the things Tony planned to feel bad for, when he got around to it.
Or, maybe, in that timeline, SHIELD just made him another one, exactly the same…
“...And maybe it
“Er, well, this last time it just seized up,” Bucky answered, awkwardly lifting his arm so that Tony could look it over. “And then there was a sort of, electric shock feeling, up along my back…”
Of course, it hadn’t grabbed his attention as it probably would have, if he’d been even remotely able to concentrate. As it was, it had become a sort of harmless game he played as he tidied. Every so often he’d spot another page much older than the others, and feel that little lift of achievement that came with collecting another prize-

And I couldn’t have that conversation without mentioning Bucky, and what was I going to do if you were furious at him, if you just needed to yell about him or… And then more time had passed, and I knew you’d ask me why I hadn’t told you before, and… All that time we
But Steve wasn’t thinking about any of that anymore.
A hot, dark feeling curled, right at the core of him. Something compulsive and illicit and raw.
“I’m calling from the Stark Industries Security Board, Clearance Code 13354, Reporting directly to Miss Potts, colour of the day is Indigo,” he rattled off impatiently, “We need to know the location of Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes – the internal system just has them down as attending an ‘external comms meeting’”
The sound of him breathing…
He shuffled down the bed and threw his legs over the edge of it, letting the forward motion of it pull him into a sitting position. He felt
And, anyway, if Gary
Tony opened his mouth to scream, but still no sound came out. He arced up against Steve’s lips, his muscles tensing against him as he twisted his grip in Steve’s hair-
For some reason, this felt like something he was doing for Steve. Even while he was so diligently keeping Steve out of it, so pointedly telling himself it was nothing at all to do with him… Somewhere, Tony felt as though it was important for him to understand this, to

been angry at Tony, for what he did to Bucky. Even though he had felt so sorry for Tony, even though he knew Tony wasn’t in his right mind when he did it, even though he felt so much guilt for leading them there in the first place… There had still been nights – moments, really – when Steve thought about what would’ve happened if one of Tony’s shots had hit. When he’d wondered, a bit too bitterly, if Tony would’ve been sorry for it. If Tony would’ve accepted that he’d done something awful in a fit of rage.
Steve felt like he should know that. Like it should have been an event, when it happened. Like he should really have thought about this before now. But it had been so easy to fall in love with Tony, that he’d never stopped to panic about the fact that he’d fallen in love at all.

find them, if they’re alive,” Nick replied, cautiously. “But we’re pretty sure the only way we’re going to do that, or get any information out of this place, is by getting someone on the inside.”
Tony’s shoulders softened slightly, more in weariness than relief. The compromised comfort of knowing that he had at least found the crux of the matter under all the noise - however messy it was.
But, whatever it was, Tony was suddenly capable of dealing with this-
the things he could’ve said, he’d chosen to tell Steve he’d felt left out.
And then Steve shifted beneath him, pulling Tony fully into the waking world…
And then he looked back at Steve, obviously braced for some sort of reaction.

By the time the sun came up, Tony had paced a hundred miles. He’d tidied his workshop and reorganised his tools and cleaned the kitchen, barely aware he was even doing it. Just looking for something to do with his body, while his mind ran endless laps.
“We’re not – we’re not

Which was focusing, at least. All those doubts and neuroses he was just about to fall into had faded completely. All Steve was thinking about now was how he could tell Tony that he wanted this. If it was even possible to put into words how much he wanted this. How absurd it was for Tony to say that, when Steve had spent weeks daydreaming about this exact moment. How baffling it was that Tony thought that, when Tony was… astounding, beautiful… brilliant-

“Sorry, that’s my bad, I should’ve said…” Tony carried on murmuring, hardly hearing himself speak.
“Come sit with me,” Steve suggested softly, caressing more firmly over the curve of Tony’s waist. He felt Tony’s breath catch. And then Tony leant away from Steve just enough to secure his footing, and caught the eye of one of the diplomats he’d been talking to,

He saw Rhodey bite back a little smile.
“I can’t believe you called Nick Fury Fritz Harber,” he mused - still smiling.
“I’ve got a date with Tony Stark,” Steve sang playfully. Tony laughed, delighted.
This moment was important.
“And it makes a difference to you, what they call it,” Tony observed with a smile. Pleased it made a difference to Steve. Pleased that Steve saw the world this way…

“So, how do you get invited up there?” Tony asked, at last.
It was three days before Tony could face the chaos he’d left in the workshop - and even then, only because he’d run out of other ways to distract himself from thoughts of Steve.
He grabbed roughly at the back of Steve’s head, tears stinging the corners of his eyes, every muscle in his body tensed in a desperate need for release.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, of course you would…” Tony whispered, like he was suddenly afraid his voice would crack “But then… I hit play on that tape, and it was like you already knew what it was – and then when I asked you if you knew, you just said… yes, so, I thought… you just… knew…”
Steve was so glad he was here.
And, actually, the first minute or two went slightly better than Tony was expecting. He was
thinking that Tony would choose that exact moment to step out of the office, and that Steve - head lowered - would therefore walk right into him.
“Oh, no,” Steve shook his head. “Not all of them – just the marketing guy would be fine.”
He didn’t really know what he was saying. But, in the moment, it felt as close to the truth as he could bear to say out loud. As much of it as he could find the words for. Because he couldn’t say
And then he saw Tony relax his shoulders and got it into his head that Tony was about to leave - and in his still-inebriated panic, Steve managed to boil that whole revelation down to:
...And,
The terror it inspired in him was worse than the fear he’d felt as he crashed that plan.
“I didn’t know what I was risking when I took the serum, either,” Steve shot back – not sure where any of this was coming from now. Trying

“Uh-huh” Steve nodded-

How many times he’d looked at Tony, and heard that little voice ask him,

Bucky blinked. And then a cluster of disconnected memories came back to him…
And then, as he bent to seal the box file, his eye caught on a little scrap of yellowed paper, peaking out at him from beneath the more modern paperwork-
At the time, Tony had been consumed by how nice it was to see Steve smile like that… But, now that he thought about it, he recognised where that smile had come from.

So, when it was
This would do.
Tony wasn’t.
“Beautiful…” Tony murmured, sliding his fingers under the waistband of Steve’s boxers and peeling them down over his hips, somewhat begrudgingly leaning further away so that he could push them over Steve’s thighs. Steve gasped, arcing his back and writhing further up the bed, his fingers flexing impatiently against the sheets. Tony smiled, appreciatively.
“No comment,” he repeated. And he remembered,
Steve moaned again as Tony twisted his fingers, grinding down against his hand. Tony let the bottle of lube drop to the floor, bracing a firm palm against the inside of Steve’s thigh as he pushed a third finger into him.

Because he knew he had to.
He lost a moment, in a flurry of light and noise and dismembered voices – he could hear Steve yelling, but not the words. He could feel Steve moving him… He could feel hands against his back…

. In ways he was only just waking up enough to recognise. He felt physically better, still thrumming with the joy of relief, the absence of tension and pain that he’d taken for granted. His mind felt quieter and calmer, even with all the images and ideas and questions that were starting to run though it… like a grating background noise had been cut.

A thinly veiled question about the many safeguards they’d overlooked - safeguards that, oh, say, the world's leading expert in renewable energy might’ve suggested,
But there was that creeping feeling, the one that had been growing ever since Tony had snapped at him about hurt feelings – as Steve became increasingly sure that he’d been doing this all wrong the whole time. Now, he thought back to his original ‘plan’, his hopes that Tony might just…
Instead of which, all of that could be lavished on Steve – which meant that Tony could indulge in it himself.
“Yes! That’s what it is!” Steve agreed, too energetically. “…But it’s blue?”
He really didn’t want to push his luck.
But better not to make the same mistake again, eh?
about what they might be. How all of this might fit into the real world. What Steve was really at risk of, how Tony could make it better…
He thought about whether there really was a God.
“...Okay, well, imagine that Laura, or one of the kids, accidentally stumbled across a secret of national importance,” Steve began calmly - deliberately ignoring the way Clint flinched when he mentioned his family. “And, of course, you had to take that to your bosses - when they asked you to tell them how you knew, you’d have to say you couldn’t, wouldn’t you?”
“Well, right now, I have to go,” she reminded him. “But you’d better be awake when I get in, because we

So, Steve drank his, in the head-back, single-gulp method that Natasha had taught him, all those years ago…

He even imagined biting him.
“I swear to God, you so much as cut me…” Steve breathed, his whole body tensing upwards, his heart pounding painfully in his head.
He didn’t even know why he did – he was still angry about this.
It was the strangest feeling… and yet so perfectly obvious.
“You must be very proud.” Tony replied, softly, ignoring a low churning in his gut. The little voice that whispered,

what he wanted to do, right now.
“Did I write that?” Tony blurted out, somewhat embarrassed. That sounded awfully honest for something he’d written… But Steve just pinched a sad smile and nodded his head. “…Wow. Yeah, I can’t remember much of what I wrote either, so, you know, don’t feel bad…”
And, as well as the physical thing… well, he just

And then Tony pulled back, so that he could thrust into Steve slow and deep, quickly falling into that new rhythm. A soft moan fell over Steve’s lips, as that comfort heated into a more present pleasure, that grinding satisfaction that pulled him out of the clouds and into this sensation instead.
“We need to talk to one of the humans that work here, preferably someone with access to the research work” Tony told her, efficiently. “So, we need you to find us somewhere we can interrogate them without being seen – but, more importantly, we need something we can do with that person for at least a couple of hours afterwards.”
He couldn’t spare Steve that pain.
...There was nothing for Steve in this moment beyond appreciating it. There was only the bittersweet privilege of getting to see it again. That was all.
“It had to be a picture of you getting upset.”
, that you have a room full of very entitled people, who were all told – like we were – that they could basically do whatever they liked here, have whatever sex they like, take whatever drugs. And every single one of them said, no thank you, we’re just going to make like everyone else and spoon in the lounge bar?” And then he finally looked back at Steve-
Oh, there was that awareness of his body again – stronger now, and…deeper…
And a cold, sad voice whispered in his head-
, he didn’t have the chance to talk to Steve just then. Whatever else he was confused about, it was obvious that they couldn’t have this conversation with Bucky waiting awkwardly on the side-lines. So, Tony had done his best to get on with the task in hand, all the while trying frantically to remember what his original plan had been – trying to convince himself that he’d been on the right track with it, before this entirely irrational, purely emotional response had thrown him for a loop.
Without even realising he was doing it, Steve bowed his head lower, dropping his shoulders. And then Tony let his hand slide down between Steve’s legs, stroking over his thigh. Steve was forced to pinch his lips together, a strangled little
Steve didn’t even feel anxious about it anymore.
But, as frightening and painful as this moment was… it wasn’t in that league. It was a different thing entirely. Tony might’ve felt tense and nauseous, but he could at least process these responses from his body. These thoughts might be horrible and unstructured, but they weren’t running away from him or dissolving entirely to mush.
Oh, but he could
in the same way as last time. This seemed more like a perfectly human reaction to seeing someone he was scared of…

room?”
Even the inky nothingness of the wormhole - even the nightmare counterpart that swallowed him in his sleep - was less oppressively vacant than his workshop in the moments after Steve left. It was as though he’d taken all the air with him, all the sound, all the colour, all life… For a few seconds, Tony’s mind was completely blank, frozen in panic over what to panic over first-
He and Tony shared a moment of genuinely comfortable quiet, both still smiling. And then Tony’s face lit up with a sudden thought,

Tony gave his phone a weary glare before he tossed it aside. Then he let his head fall into his hands.
...All of a sudden, Steve was that sixteen-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn.
“Yeah. I was just… bored, to be honest with you,” Steve laughed softly. And Tony grinned back, as though he was pleased about something…

He looked at the bed, and he

“What’re we doing?” Steve tried pulling things into order, grabbing for what he thought was a priority question.
So, yeah, be aware, before you open this chapter on the bus...
He clenched his teeth against the blush that was already running up his neck, his gaze fixed on the wall directly ahead of him – avoiding Tony, standing over to his right, and the angry clattering he’d just set off, somewhere to his left.
And only then did Steve realise that the guy behind them had been repeating the phrase,
“We both have nightmares about the cold,” Steve answered, carefully. “Dreams we don’t remember, but we always wake up shivering, and it takes forever to get warm… And with me, it’s because of the ice, and people kind of expect it. But no one ever thinks that the caves in Afghanistan were cold. If they ever think about you having nightmares, people would expect them to be hot and dry and dusty. They don’t know that you were freezing that whole time, that your nightmares are dark and damp and always cold. I’m guessing you’ve never told anyone that. You know you’d have to
He couldn’t watch that bold, bright spark of the real Tony – the one he was so honestly in love with – to be overpowered by narrative of an unfair world.
He could hear the need and desperation in Steve’s voice, he could see the way Steve’s whole body responded to him. He knew Steve wanted him. He

And then, as Tony was about to fall into it completely, his gaze caught on something. Into that quietness, an idea presented itself…
It felt wrong to think that way about someone he genuinely loved. Someone who had never been anything but reasonable and kind. Someone smart and interesting and funny - someone that anyone would be glad to spend time with.
And it was nice, to be able to drift into daydreams and
…which was
The walls and floor were made of the same dark, imposing wood, embellished with the same formulaic carvings. At the far end of the room, directly ahead of them, was a raised stage with a long, stoic looking dining table - which Tony automatically named the teachers table, even though he’d figured out that it was for the Avengers. The crest that was built into the wall behind it was far showier and probably far more expensive than the one at Tony’s school - possibly made out of solid gold, and studded with tiny diamonds - but still, it sat in exactly the same place, and to the same effect. The rest of the guests were seated at rectangular tables that lined the room, all leaning into the centre so that they could gossip excitedly…
There was an audible intake of breath all around him. As Clint struggled to pull his arguments into words, Thor cast Bucky a loaded glance.

And Tony felt so safe, so excited, so
Ultimately, not doing anything seemed less risky than anything he could do. And, truthfully, he was surprised to have made it this far without embarrassing himself or offending Tony – there was a part of him that was eager to get out while he was ahead.
These were just the darkest fears from the recesses of his mind - and it was probably ridiculous to throw away his only chance at happiness on such a vague what if…
And in that state Steve had stayed.
“I love it here,” Steve sighed, happily. A swell of pure affection rose up in him, seeing the pride in Tony’s little smile.
Somehow, right now at least, remembering that he’d bitten Steve only added to Tony’s sudden swell of contentment. Or, when he forced himself to really examine that…
“Honestly? I didn’t really make a pitch for Barnes,” she confessed. “I made a pitch for Steve Rogers.”
But Steve wasn’t sure any of that made
? I know people ask,
“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” Tony whispered.
He could’ve sworn he felt his heart stop.
“Grow a spine JARVIS. I’ve got plans,” he retorted - even though Coulson had already disrupted them, simply by jarring him out of his easy mood.
, look, before he said.
But Steve wouldn’t have known to ask for this.
Petulantly, Steve focused his vision on the page in front of him, and read the title for the third time today.
“Sorry, did I wake you?”
“Rhodey said he saw a big tower on the edge of the city,” Tony observed, brightly - speaking louder now that they were being surrounded by more and more people… apparently. “I was thinking maybe it would be a power station, or a government building, or a central point - you know, somewhere it might be worth breaking into…”
“I can barely read, right now” Steve commented, and Tony giggled – and then shot him a warning look that just made Steve want to smile more.
No answer.
“Yeah, sure,” Steve nodded, “thanks.” He was glad when Tony turned away again to pour it. It gave him a moment to shuffle awkwardly to the couch and to
“Well, I was giving some thought to what we could do, if we did go…”

And then Steve grabbed him by the hips and pulled him up into a deep, slow kiss.
Was cut off by a wanton moan, as Tony finally slid Steve’s cock into his mouth.
He remembered the rush of exhilaration as he argued with Tony in the yard, the thrill of sexual tension and unrequited love… Things Steve would never feel again, no matter where he went back to…
no other way to be sure thousands of people wont die… and that these people pay for this…” Tony carried on like he was talking to himself. Like he was trying to
But not that Steve might be a vampire, no.
...He was completely free.
Still, he made a point of sighing dramatically, because he couldn’t bear to let this pass uncommented. Then, begrudgingly, he rose to his feet along with the rest of them, and followed the waitress through the door and into another hallway.
And, honestly, he didn’t

an abrupt spike of shame or doubt or anger to tear him out of this moment.

By the time his own giggling had petered out, Steve felt weightless and watery, still smiling at the sound of Rhodey’s laughter, echoing in the distance…
And Steve just smiled, and thought about it.

And again,
The more he was starting to wonder if the happy relationship he was trying to picture was simply the friendship they’d had before…
But Tony’s mind was just working
And, as much as Steve would’ve liked to object, just for the sake of it…
“I gather, you don’t usually get drunk, when you’re drinking like this?” Belle asked Steve directly, as the redhead unfolded four little legs from beneath the panel – thin, and long, and sharp, like needles…
A hot tangle of thoughts that he couldn’t form into English-

And now for the personal introspection 😂 But please be aware, that both Steve and Tony are still working things out, and while some of these thoughts are things they really believe and stand by - others may be revisited at a later date...
It would be instead of hitting this man until he
Tony was glad that he’d had the chance to simply be close to Steve like that. It felt like it changed things. Like maybe, when they did get around to talking, they could do it from a completely different place now. Like maybe it mattered beyond just being nice.
He realised it as he was trying to craft the right words for Tony this morning, if he woke up understandably upset about something that wasn’t really Steve’s fault. What he could say to ease Tony’s
But it mattered to him.
“Please…” came out as a whisper. And then, when Tony looked up at him expectantly, Steve realised that he couldn’t find any words except the real ones, “please don’t leave me.”
For a while, the whole thing was too performative to be of any real value. Steve knew he was only touring the halls to prove to himself that he could - taking his time simply to spite his urge to rush. He was so busy reminding himself that he was
“So… why
Steve Rogers was a different man to the one that left 2023 - or even the one who arrived here six months ago.
“Six am,” Steve blushed. Tony breathed a laugh.
He would’ve liked to say his final goodbye to his face.
“Especially if you’re still feeling tired from the trip,” the other picked up, without missing a beat, “but we

Not according to the computer system, there wasn’t. And that meant, if it existed, the fourth floor had a separate power supply, a separate communication network, a separate ventilation system – and great efforts had been taken to conceal all of it.
It was three days later when Tony finally got the chance to sneak back to Steve’s house. And, since he’d decided he’d be harder to track if he went on foot, he’d had a nice, long stroll along the beach to think about all the reasons he hated himself.
Bucky had said it as though he was cautiously optimistic that the answer might be yes. And, beyond that underlying frisson of hope, he’d seemed quite casual about the question-

mean anyone here was a member of that organisation, or supports their values, or that anyone had anything to do with what happened to you-”
There were so many things he’d been running from. Things it had seemed easier to bury… until, against all odds, a solution appeared.
And that had been out of place in the forties too, by the way. Steve’s few attempts to explain that point of view had been met by every reaction from baffled amusement to borderline outrage. People who assumed he was trying to excuse infidelity, when he was actually trying to explain that he’d remain faithful even if he

Okay. He felt a bit more guilty now.

And again,
“And it means we need your help” Tony chipped in – and now Zan looked outright alarmed.
And pleased that Rhodey had thought of it, actually. That was a comfort in itself…
“Hi,” Steve breathed, forgetting all about his plan to try and play it cool. And he probably would’ve followed with something cringe-makingly awkward, or adorably dazed, except that Tony was too excited to leave a gap for it.
So far, in accordance with his carefully planned order of things, Steve had only been through a factual, chronological account of the timeline he’d left - pointedly skipping over the story of what happened between

He’d let Tony –
that made Tony feel secure, and worthwhile.
It was like being yanked clean out of reality. Like pulling a parachute. There was a surge of oxygen, clean and crisp and sweet tasting, rushing straight to his head. His vision blurred; his body fell away from him. Suddenly, Steve was just

The old arguments spoke up automatically, an immediate expression of habit…
“Well, I don’t know, maybe its not the same thing, but… I don’t know, the way I think young people talk is how everyone else expects elderly people to talk. I remember when I was maybe a week out of the ice, I referred to someone as a fella, and whoever I was talking to snorted this little laugh, like it was really… quaint, or something. But that wasn’t how it sounded to me…” And Steve noticed, as he was talking, that Tony was softening again, his eyes widening in recognition. It helped the words come easier. “And, I don’t know – even if I
And then he remembered the other thing he wanted to balance. And, now, he felt more sure of it than he ever had. Almost excited to say it, thinking that maybe he could achieve that same rightness in an even more fundamental way.
“Steve? Just so you know, we have a visitor. She’s wants to talk to us”
“The thing is, I’m not saying I wouldn’t have objected to the whole thing with Wanda. I still would, even now. But… I had
Tony, whatever he was doing.
He knows that’s a word for something… something he understands.
“And hey, at least you look good in the uniform.”
And Steve’s head snapped up, his eyes suddenly fixed on Tony, the threat of tears receding in an instant. Tony swallowed an anxious, bitter taste –

walking away from this, with all these confused ideas swirling in his head. He wouldn’t be truly free to think about any of it, until he could stop thinking about the next time he saw Steve.
Steve pushed Tony’s legs further apart as he sucked, eagerly, the back of his tongue dragging over the head of Tony’s cock as he took him right to the back of his throat. Tony was immediately flooded with a heavy, pulsing pleasure, a wave that swelled up to the very limits of him – and then ebbed back into a compulsive, stinging need.  Involuntarily, Tony pulled Steve’s hair into a fist – earning a groan from Steve that he could
It was a drab sort of a place, with scuff marks along the skirting board and worn patches in the carpets. The couch took up one whole wall of the tiny living room/kitchen area, and one corner of the bed was propped up on an old paint can - in short, it was not the sort of place that Tony would usually have stayed.
If he’d felt like he’d been
Tony sat up and gasped for air, a wave of dizziness crashing over him along with the rush of oxygen. For a few moments he felt entirely weightless, his head quiet save for the rapid beating of his heart. When he regained enough awareness to think of it, Tony began to fill his lungs more deliberately, focusing only on catching his breath.

Bucky just rolled his eyes again.
“Woah, hang on,” Bucky yelped, obviously alarmed. Steve stood to attention, immediately back in the room, as Tony took a little step back.

In spite of the fact that Rhodey, quite clearly, did not.
Steve didn’t really come back to himself until hours later, when he found himself standing awkwardly in the middle of Tony’s living room.
This had never happened before.
Just the vague recollection of Rhodey yelling at him, increasingly hysterically.
So, Tony had found the last thing that he could remember - that was some comfort.
A hot, dull ache, as something pressed hard against the wound.
Objectively speaking, he should probably just give up on this and go to bed. Allow his exhaustion to draw a line under it for the time being, collapse into sleep while he had some chance of getting any, revisit all of this with a clear head.
Steve made sure to squeeze it a bit too tight.

And all the while he still had his eyes fixed on Steve,
And, as Tony ran though all of his recent revelations and all his lifelong assumptions,
They both looked toward the noise and then back at one another. Steve scanned the room behind him. Tony looked towards the door, and then at Steve again. Steve nodded, subtly dropping into combat position as Tony walked over and opened it.

to take these drugs. The fact that Steve would have to make himself a human guinea-pig to get to that stage in the first place. The possibility that they’d get there and realise they just needed an army – that they might’ve been able to bring one, if they hadn’t gotten themselves killed before they could raise the alarm…
He felt a sudden plunge in his stomach and recognised immediately that it wasn’t a reaction to the text – at least not directly. This was something he would have felt anyway. This feeling was the reason he’d known to listen for that text in the first place…

And he wasn’t making any progress on working out what the hell he was doing.
Enjoy ;-)
He heard Tony sigh softly as he settled into him, his hands caressing into Steve’s skin. And then Tony rocked into him gently, a slow, shallow motion that dragged a deep, low sensation right from the core of him.
It confused his body first. Instinctively, his hands reached out for some kind of context, and found only empty air. He braced himself to fall forwards, only to realise that he was already too close to the ground… But not as close as he expected to be, somehow…
This version of him was well past that.
But Tony wasn’t really considering those problems; just listing them. Honestly, he couldn’t see the benefit in trying to fix any of them. The whole situation felt like a wall of water headed right for him – there seemed little point in thinking about pulling his hood up or tucking his pants into his socks. Ultimately, this was a dangerous situation that he had no hope of getting out of. Tinkering around the edges and trying to safeguard against minor risks just sounded frustrating.
“Maybe” Tony shrugged, lowering his eyes as he walked past Steve. “One couple mentioned a sort of, daily catch up thing they have every evening… might be worth going to…”

“So… Now what?” Bucky asked cautiously, snapping Tony out of his daydreams. Tony felt a phantom blush of embarrassment, as he realised that he had no idea how long he’d been lost in the middle distance.
“If I ever give it another go, I’ll let you know – you can tell me whether it’s good food done terribly.”
“Right, let’s give ourselves as much lead time as we can” Steve started, and took a brief tally of all the other guests in the lobby, and then glanced at the girl at the bottom of the stairs again. “How’re you at pretending to be drunk?”
