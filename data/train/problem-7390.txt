"I'm very glad you could meet us today, Aldrich" started Pepper, conjuring a charming smile out of nowhere. Tony knew Pepper's honest smile intimately, and this was nowhere near it. "These are Janet Van Dyne and Tony Stark, but I'm sure you already know."
Steve took it as victory. A sour one, but a victory nonetheless.
“Let me go home Nat, my head is killing me,” pleaded Stark.
"Aldrich Killian," he presented himself, looking at Tony from head to toe. Sizing him. "I'm a big fan of your work," he lied.
Tony looked away. They were right. He used to prance around Hollywood not giving a fuck about anything. But that had gotten him fired, beaten up, drunk and worst of all, expelled from the industry. So if this was his big comeback, he needed to put the effort in it.
“Hi, you must be Steve,” said a soft, low voice.
“Mr Stark,” greeted Steve with a nod.
"Oh, yeah! Sure," Steve smiled and followed Rhodes outside.
"I'm gonna make myself very clear. I'm here to make a movie. Not to hold your hand and praise your poor choices of delivery," Tony said, spitting every word. "Don't think for even a second that you're anything but an audience-friendly eye candy. Everyone knows where the real talent lays and it's certainly not with the guy that played Captain America five times."
When they get back to the tower and get out of the car, he feels a hand rest on his arm. He thinks he flinches, opening his eyes. Steve smiles sadly at him again, pulling his hand away. Tony doesn’t beg him to put it back, doesn’t beg him to stay, doesn’t ask for any of that because he knows it’ll only hurt more in the end. Steve walks inside, and Tony watches him go.
He nods, swallowing hard, and tries to relax, letting himself fall into the simple stepping rhythm as Tony leads him across the smooth tiles of the kitchen. He ignores how the way Tony had said
Fury turns to him, and Tony suddenly remembers why he doesn’t like history.
“That’s my fucking life Steve, and they own half the wealth in the country so there’s absolute jack
” Nat nods towards Tony, who still hasn’t spoken, still hasn’t really moved at all, “is okay with that?”
“It’s whatever you want it to be. But legally, sure, let’s call it an interrogation. Steve stays.”
is this?” Obadiah hisses
The waitress smiles, and Steve can see something change in her expression as she relaxes slightly, addressing Tony.
When his mother goes to the bathroom, he gets up to follow, because he just needs some
He thinks of his mother, how much love she'd had for him, the love that he still feels now, even when she's gone. He thinks of Rhodey and Pepper, people who have never left his side, not even once. He thinks of Steve, Steve who's hurt him, but also saved him more times than he can count, saved him in so many more ways that one.
“Excuse me, would you happen to have a spare key to Mr Stark’s room?”
“I know Steve, you’re too much of a nice person.”
Minutes later, she’s gone.
Sam laughs, and another voice pipes up, laced with a wicked humour. Natasha then.
“Who? Me? I would never patronise you sweetheart.”
“I’m so sorry.” Steve says softly, touching his arm, grip on his hand tightening a little. “But at least we have the hard evidence now.”
Tony is the first to react.
“Yeah I left early. I’d been working all- No I’m not
“My company- my
He shoots back, dropping his voice to a whisper and glancing at the door, so very conscious that Steve can probably hear their whole conversation.
“Sure, just get it to me whenever you can.”
Sam opens his mouth to protest, but Nat just nods, giving him a look that's all wide-eyed innocence.
Tony stands suddenly, needing to do
, he needs to stop staring at his lips.
Clint raises his eyebrows. “By any chance does it have anything to do with a guy? Or a billionaire? Or
“Absolutely not.”
to look at her. “Get him out of here, okay?”
Steve looks at Tony, sees his eyes dancing with light for the first time in a while. And then he kisses him, because it’s impossible not to like this, surrounded by so much life.
“Nope.” Tony snaps, and Steve can hear the anger in his voice now. Happy must have said something, asked something. “That really isn’t any of your business. That’ll be all. Call me back when you’ve got the names.”
Tony leads him inside, smirking at the waitress in a way that makes something twist in Steve’s stomach. He’s
Boyfriend. God, he’s in deep shit already, and he still can’t stop
Steve shakes his head, meeting his eyes. “No. Nat doesn’t think so. I don’t think so. You had-” Steve looks like how Tony feels: sick, exhausted. “You still had all your clothes on.”
“Stop looking at me like that,” is what he finally manages to say. “Stop looking at me like I’m about to fucking break just because he hits me.”
Tony raises his eyebrows and smiles, leaning in to kiss him.
He wants to kiss him, he wants to kiss him so badly.
“Three years ago. I went to one of my father’s parties while I was in college. It backfired a little. I drank too much. Ty was there, and he decided to see how far he could go with Howard Stark’s son. By the time my brain kicked in and I realised what was happening, we were in his room, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”
to see Obadiah Stane standing there.
“I love you,” he says quietly, and the rain keeps falling. Steve is warm. “But I don’t- I don’t need you to say it back-”
“Tony.” His voice is a purr. “But you can call me anything you want sweetheart.”
“You’re so beautiful.” Steve whispers, brushing his fingers through his hair, smoothing it away from his face.
Tony is on his feet in seconds, and
“What the
He breathes out, slipping shaking hands into his pockets, locking the memories up again. Then Obadiah speaks again.
“Depends. Usually not. I don’t enjoy showing it to the press anyway.”
The man has his goddamn spies everywhere, and it’s sets Tony’s skin crawling. He once went through seven phones in a month, because he kept finding bugs on them. Now he has two phones. One is his personal one that Rhodey set up for him. It has three numbers on it. Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy. The bugged one is what he considers his work phone, and it’s for Obie, Howard, his mother, and anyone else.
“Yeah Cap.” He says, and it sounds a little rough, a little imperfect. It’s still Tony, the voice, the eyes, the light on his face, his steady warmth that’s sleeping into Steve’s bones. “I’m happy.”
She shrugs innocently, moving past him to take over his shift, smiling at the next customer with ease. He knows it’s fake, because it’s directed at the same woman who had come in last week and ordered five coffees, didn’t tip, and then called Nat something that nearly had all of them launching across the counter to kill her.
“You punched captain America in the face. Jesus.”
“Sure. The coffee is nice.”
“I hope not.” Obie says, giving him a look that makes his heart leap into his throat. Because
In the end, it only takes him seventeen minutes after taking the first sip to realise something is very, very wrong.
“No. They’re
He doesn’t bother with a coat, just taking a hoodie and walking out. He could call Happy, he probably
He smiles, the first real smile in a while, and kisses Steve again as his answer.
Tony holds his hand to his heart with a teasing smile.
“Hover.”
“Because-” he doesn’t have a reason, not really. He can’t tell Steve he’s scared of staying, because he doesn’t want to break one of the only good things in his life. Not that Steve is in his life, not that he
There’s a large sketchbook on a stand in the middle, and as Tony gently turns the pages, he sees Steve’s life, his love, displayed on every single one.
“The Italian is a turn on. Good to know.”
“But I-”
Tony shoots her a look which clearly says
“What?”
“You knew this when you started dating me darling.”
Clint is on his feet in less than five seconds, which Steve finds somewhat impressive, considering how low he had been sliding down the chair a minute ago.
or he’s going to go insane.
“Who the fuck invited you?” Rhodey all but snarls, and Tony is certain that Ty would have a broken nose if he wasn’t holding Rhodey back. Maybe he could let his friend fight that particular one, if they ever get the opportunity.
glad that he’s good at keeping it steady.
When he asks Steve to drive them to where his parents are buried, Steve does it without a second of hesitation.
His friend already has her shoes on.
Steve’s face. His face. His
No. He’s not going to just
Yeah, no.
She guesses his password in six seconds, which would be embarrassing in any other situation, except this is Natasha Romanoff, and she’s freakily good at hacking. There was a rumour last year that she hacked the pentagon, but seeing as he’s the one who started it, he won’t swear by it.
Breathe. Breathe.
“I’m really really glad I came in for that coffee.”
“Don’t waste your time,” Tony says under his breath, ordering another drink. He feels shaky, on the verge of a panic attack. He tries for a joke. “Obie will just kill you, and then I’ll be really stuck.”
and Tony is almost untouchably beautiful.
And then suddenly, all at once, it crashes back into him with the force of a tidal wave. The party, Obie threatening Steve, Ty there, Ty giving him a drink. Ty-
Steve doesn’t wait for more than a second before closing the door, turning back to Tony.
He can’t breathe-
Pepper’s face softens at this, and Steve goes around the table, grabbing the phone that he’d been looking at before she had arrived and sliding into the seat next to Tony.
“I work on a need to know basis. Nothing personal Cap.”
“We really should have breakfast,” he whispers against Steve’s lips.
“Yes. Very much.”
(He loves Tony’s eyes, loves them so goddamn much.)
He laughs as he answers his own question, cutting smoothly across Steve.
One of them, he thinks maybe the man who had stopped him in the first place, is standing over him. He groans as a final kick connects with his ribs, and he’s not sure what hurts the most anymore.
His mother had wanted him to come, and he had agreed because it was his mother, and Rhodey’s had just been diagnosed with stage three breast cancer (which she has now survived) and it was his
“It’s just-” His hands are soft, and Tony leans into the touch as Steve cups his cheek. So gentle, he’s so gentle. “It’s a lot.”
“Woah, hey.”
“I can look into Obadiah, see if there’s anything, and there will be, that he’s been hiding. If it was him, then he would've left a trace.”
Steve opens the door, looking slightly confused, but he barely has time to open his mouth before Tony is hugging the air out of him.
dragging it out.
He doesn’t know what time it is when he becomes aware of a low humming noise, and then he hears JARVIS’s voice.
Tony leans back in his seat, tilting his head to one side, resealing the cracks in his immovable facade.
“Tony don’t-”
“Language.” Tony murmurs against his lips, melting into his arms.
“Yeah?” He says quietly, eyes still closed.
Tony turned to her, and his gaze is flat, almost emotionless.
“Hey.”
Steve’s eyes are so blue, the sunlight hitting them and turning everything golden. They’re so close that he can see the different colours in his eyes, see the reflection of the light on his hair.
“It’s about a ten minute drive.”
“Hey. Talk to me, remember?”
you’re bullshitting me about the dating thing. If he’s not looking for anything serious, which I really doubt, from what I’ve heard, you get dinner with a billionaire and never see him again. Not a biggie.”
Steve remembers fighting Spiderman once, a long, long time ago. It had been a time of lies, a time of pain, a time of so much guilt he had thought that maybe it would rip him apart. He had never apologised for that day, not really. He had known, and the pain in Tony’s eyes during that video had nearly killed him.
Tony recoils slightly, instantly realising his mistake in reacting, and trying desperately to cover it up.
“You came.” Is what reaches his ears a moment later, and Tony sounds like a child. The quiet murmur breaks his heart because of course he fucking came and he sounds so goddamn young right now and all he can think about is the absence of anything in Tony’s eyes when they had first seen him in the hall
But still, he nearly jumps out of his skin as a hand lands on his shoulder.
Tony laughs, having another drink of his coffee, and Steve tries to wipe the stupidly happy smile off his face. He rolls his eyes in defeat instead, shooting Nat a mock glare.
He bites back a laugh, shaking his head. “It will be fine. Pretty routine or so I’m told. I won’t be interacting with anyone, just the tech.”
Rhodey?"
Slowly, so slowly, the tears subside. The shaking takes longer. Steve doesn’t know what time it is when he stops feeling Tony’s grief seeping into his skin, but it’s well past the night and into the early hours of the morning.
“Are you- can you talk right now?”
He goes to a party and gets hideously, obscenely drunk, because he’s so fucking scared that the numb feeling will come back. He couldn’t shake it last time, had given into it. It tugs at him even with the blur of alcohol, but he ignores it.
But a conversation?
“What the hell are you on about?”
Judgement is something he can deal with, he’s grown up knowing how to deal with it. Steve… Steve is something he isn’t sure about, and it’s making him nervous.
Tony swallows, gripping a little tighter to his hand as he pulls away. “I don’t want to-” There’s a beat, and Tony releases a shuddering breath. “Can I-”
Steve slips on his jacket, grabbing shoes. Nat is looking at him with raised eyebrows, mouthing questions that he’s ignoring.
Obadiah doesn’t look at all surprised when they walk in, only nods towards Steve.
“What?”
“Night Tony,” Steve says, that same soft, sweet smile on his face, and Tony wonders if maybe Steve Rogers is not such a bad thing after all.
Final note before I shut up: a disclaimer about my editing. There sort of isn't a process, so if you see any mistakes or grammar errors or tense errors etc etc etc just ignore them and don't judge me too much :)
“It was fine. Boring.”
“I- I’m not-”
“Hello?”
“Didn’t you say you had something to finish?” Tony’s laughing now, fond exasperation mixing with the exhaustion. “Remind me why I let you be my intern?”
that makes Tony want to kiss him breathless
The person in question smiles sadly at him, brushing away tears Tony hadn’t noticed had fallen.
When he’d arrived, Obie had pounced on him immediately, pressing a glass of whiskey into his hand with a hissed whisper of
is maybe the wrong word. But it certainly malfunctions.  A lot. Water sprays everywhere, the majority of it hitting Hammer and his friends in the face.
He knows he fucked it up, because the look on Steve’s face will probably haunt him forever. The betrayal, the hurt, the sheer confusion because only hours before, Tony had been in his bed, kissing him, smiling.
He can see Nat standing behind him with a shit-eating grin on her face, looking far too awake seeing as he
He pushes gently, backing Steve up against the counter, and the kiss deepens, Tony’s hands tangling in his hair.
“This is Stark.”
Steve is definitely blushing, he knows that much, but doesn’t make an effort to hide it as he hears fabric shifting and then feels hands touching his shoulders.
Steve reaches up, gently smoothing a thumb across the uninjured cheekbone.
Right. The billion-dollar company.
“Obie didn't-”
He shrugs, going back to the workbench and starting to clear a couple of things away. It’s another minute before he realises his guest hasn’t left, and he’s been ignoring him for too long for it to be polite.
“The police warrant was necessary only because I’ve always wanted to throw one onto a desk. This seemed like a more appropriate time than any. Also, I enjoyed seeing the look on your face. I've got to get my giggles somewhere.”
The other man grins, leaning in to kiss him softly. “Yep.”
Tony’s smile sharpens. “But that’s part of the fun sweetheart.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve wants him to come over to talk. Is that a breakup line? Probably. He’s not really sure what a breakup line sounds like. This is definitely it though-
Tony’s smile turns catlike, and there’s something in his eyes that is a whole other type of darkness. Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing as the billionaire reaches out, trailing his fingers over his arm.
It hadn’t been a compliment. Maybe that’s why Tony had finally told him to get lost, albeit rather colourfully.
Both Sam and him turn again to look at Natasha, who stares back with a look of utterly fake innocence.
He rolls over gently, leg tingling as he moves. But a dead leg is definitely worth it as he focuses in on what is around him, or mainly who is in his bed.
ended in sex. Girls, it’s always girls, and he’s always drunk, and they’re always desperate to spend the night with him. Most of the time, he’s not interested, not really, but it’s fine. As Obie says, he created a reputation for himself at college, and now it’s his job to uphold it, even if he never remembers the night. He always remembers saying yes though, so that’s something. Apart from with-

Tony leans forward, pulling the file towards him and flipping it open. “You said you’re sending us into a base. How do we know it’ll actually be any use?”
I just… you’re good at a hell of a lot of things.”
There isn’t a point in lying now, and yet the instinct to hide and lock it all up is still there. Tony shoves it away.
He doesn’t speak, he’s not sure if he can.
He tenses slightly as a gentle hand touches his cheek; relaxing as the face next to him comes into focus. It’s Tony. Tony.
“No. But he’s not going to feel great tomorrow.”
did he tell you?”
“I didn’t know you were Italian.” He doesn't mention that he had found it ridiculously hot. The expression on his face most likely speaks for itself, if Tony's knowing smirk is any indication.
“Because I’m in love with you!”
“No I-” there’s a second of silence, and Tony can feel his heart in his throat. “Who was that man with you in the cafe the other day?
“Do you know where the others are?”
because he’s so fucking honest, and he’s probably never even had to
the look in his eyes-
It’s a threat, plain and simple, but Tony no longer cares. There is nothing that can make him go and smile at Ty, go and be nice to the boy who had ruined him so completely before he had even graduated.
“I love you.”
. He’s never seen him like this, not even that evening in the rain, not even after Ty.
to get close to people. Every time it happens, it ends badly. It’s usually his fault; it’s
“Yeah. Thank you.”
Pepper shrugs. “You look like you could use it, no offence. And I figured your boyfriend would be here too. Also, you’re awful terrible at communicating with me.”
Steve laughs, letting himself relax for a second. Tony smiling, Tony happy, are things that haven’t been common over the last few weeks. And yet here they are.
“I’m going to go home, explain to Clint what happened.”
“You haven’t exactly been forthcoming either.” He forces his voice to relax, to slip into the familiar drawl that he’s used on far too many girls at parties just like this.
on his face now. It’s not directed at him, Steve knows it’s not directed at him. But he can feel it radiating from the billionaire in waves.
“That’s what they said when- That’s what they said.” He starts to turn away, and Steve feels a flash of desperation, a need to make him

memories are infinite
“Why did
(He takes three showers in the end. The last two are to wash away the feeling of hands that aren’t Steve’s.)
The bell chimes; signalling that someone has walked into the cafe, and Tony’s mouth snaps shut. It could be anyone, but the dread building, and the smell of expensive cologne says otherwise.
“Tony, baby. Look at me, please. I promise I’m okay.”
“Whiskey. Drinks.” The words are barely tangible, but it makes sense because they all have the money, so Ty paying the bartender to spike Tony’s drink can’t have been that difficult.
When they pull up outside the cafe, Tony opens his eyes and glances at Obadiah. There’s a look of immense satisfaction on his face, and that’s when Tony knows he has to fucking sell this, because Obie has already made up his goddamn mind about the entire situation.
the sharp edges that he imagines his intelligence to be made of start to blur slightly.
“Who did this to you?”
Tony smiles against his lips, and then pulls away with a wink.
the fact that this isn’t a request. It’s not an option, and it’s not a fucking question. Let me see him. Now.”
“What?”
“Stop hovering.” Peter says with a laugh. “I’m fine, I’ll be done in ten minutes
He watches Tony’s entire demeanour change, and he seems to put the intense weight of grief aside, just brush it off. Denial, compartmentalisation, he doesn’t know. But Tony is doing it.
He can still remember Tony’s smile then, so beautiful, so happy. He would’ve killed to freeze time forever in that moment.
Steve is lying next to him, arm stretched out behind Tony's head. For the first time in a while, he looks totally peaceful, expression almost serene in sleep. He can feel the warmth that Steve gives off, and itches to curl back into it, to just fall against him and sleep for another three hours.
He hangs up.
If you liked this, or really really want to yell at me right now, drop me a comment (I love reading about what you guys thought!) or come and scream at me on tumblr/instagram: @wordsxstars
Steve feels himself going red again, and folds his arms across his chest.
“You stole my phone.” He deadpans. She just laughs, handing him back the mobile.
Tony shakes his head again, looking at the floor, and Steve takes his face in his hands, tilting it upwards.
With Nat’s help, they manage to get Tony  out of the car, but he’s barely upright for five seconds before he’s throwing up on the side of the street.
“Did he give you anything? Pills?”
She leads them to a booth at the back, and Steve feels so unbelievably out of place here amidst all the men in tailored suits and the fancy silverware. But once he sits down, he can feel himself relaxing slightly, because Tony’s eyes are on him, and he can feel the intensity of his gaze from across the damn table.
Trust it, only to ignore it.
Howard had protested, his mother had cried, but surprisingly, Obie had taken his side, had said that he needed some space. It was one of the only things they had ever actually agreed on, and Tony had been grateful, is still grateful, though he suspects Obie has spies in the apartment block he lives in too.
He laughs, reaching up to pull Steve back in, kissing him, and then kissing him again. He really could do it forever, Tony thinks, closing his eyes. It’s finally quiet in his head, peaceful,
“Yeah of course.” Tony kisses him again, and he’ll never get sick of this, kissing Steve Rogers. “See you later baby.”
in twenty. You better be right.”
“You could have sent that through Pepper.” Tony near snarls, and Steve resists the urge to shove Obadiah out of the door.
The guy, Tony, smiles again, handing over the money and slipping twenty dollars into the tip jar. Steve fights to keep the surprise off his face.
{New Year’s Eve}
Silence.
Steve apologises.
“Sleep well?”
“You can talk to me, you know that right?”
“It’s Perseus I think. Fighting Medusa. He cut off her head right?”
The billionaire’s laugh rises above the roaring noise of the crowd as he pulls Steve into the middle of it, fighting to get to the spot that they’ve saved. He’s surprised the pounding of his heart isn’t audible. Tony’s grip doesn’t release, doesn’t give an inch, even for a second. So Steve lets himself be pulled along, trusting the person leading him.
So instead, he stops trying to explain exactly how he’s feeling, and just kisses him until everything else falls away.
“I’m fine.” He says, and it comes out harsher than he intends it to.
“Right.”
No. He hasn’t. His shift had overrun, thanks to their conversation about Howard Stark’s son, and he had nearly missed his class.
Tony raises his eyebrows as she speaks, tipping his head to the side and looking at her almost quizzically, before his face relaxes into a smile.
He hangs up.
Tony huffs out a laugh, letting his mind linger on one name before deciding against it. “Unfortunately no. But they’re intelligent kids. They’ll do well in life.”
beg Obadiah for, and Obie
“Good.” Tony smiles slightly, setting the coffee mug in his hand down on the table. His face softens into a smile. “Steve-” He realises Tony looks serious, looks nervous, and his heart jumps in his chest for a second. “Listen, this is going to sound… I don’t know. But I was just wondering if maybe you would-”
Tony rolls his eyes, throwing himself down onto one of the couches. Lunch with Obadiah is always draining, beyond draining, and the meeting with Fury doesn’t start for another twenty minutes. He has time to sleep, or at least try to.
He counts five men surrounding him before his vision starts to blur.
Steve grins, gently taking Tony’s hand under the table.
Maybe it’s nothing at all that decides what comes next.
He can’t though, because he doesn’t know, and Tony can’t tell him.
He knows as soon as he opens his eyes. It’s funny how snow works that way. It’s a silence in the air, like something in the world is holding its breath, afraid that it will all just
Tony can’t stop smiling and at some point he thinks he might be crying, but Steve brushes away the tears with soft hands and
The drink, Ty-
“I don’t want you to back off.”
If Howard ever finds out, if Howard ever knew about Steve-
She glances at Tony, then back at Steve. “Of course. I’m glad I could. Just… make sure he’s okay.”
“Tony,” he says, and it’s something sad, his voice, something desperate. “Please just
“He’s not my bodyguard.”
There’s something in Obadiah's voice that makes Steve go still. Tony’s sentence trails away, and Steve shifts closer to him, heart pounding.
Steve blinks, gaze clearing slightly. “Goodnight. I’ll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep, it’s better to be well rested”
“You were the one who told
Please don’t argue with me about this.”
Nervous, is the first emotion that comes to mind, and it’s a new one, because he’s usually too drunk to be nervous when it comes to asking people out. Not that he asks them out a lot. Usually, he just skips a few (or five) steps and takes them straight to bed.
he is.
He can’t breathe, everything hurts too much.
“I'm not-”
“I mean,” says Steve slowly, carefully, “why are you scared of him? What did he do?”
“You didn’t.”
“Not many sixteen year olds can even attempt to develop a tracking technology this advanced. Don’t put so much pressure on yourself about it kid.”
After it shuts, he turns back to Steve with an amused smile of apology.
Careful, Tony is always so careful around him.
He’s been to the Met a hundred times, a side effect of living in New York his whole life, so the exhibitions are nothing new. He doesn’t pretend to be interested in anything their nervous wreck of a tour guide is saying, instead opting to wander a little further away from the group.
“You’re chaotic.” Steve shoots back with a grin. Tony laughs, and the sound is so
When he finishes work, he goes to one afternoon class (who the hell said Saturday classes were legal?) and then goes home. He shares the apartment with someone he only met this year but got on well with fast. Clint is in the shower when he gets back, so instead he collapses onto his bed.
Steve takes a step towards him, grabbing his hand before he can leave. His grip is gentle, and Tony knows he could break it if he tried. It’s the only thing that stops the reflex of flinching away. He hates it, he hates that he has that reflex, that instinct. He hates that he has to push his boyfriend away from the mess that is his head.
“What are you going to do?”
He hadn’t meant to run into Tony at this time of the morning, it had just… happened. He’d heard the billionaire walk past his room, he had only been half asleep anyway. Usually, he’d roll over and go back to sleep. And yet, he hadn’t been able to walk away this time, so he had found himself dressing in jeans and a t shirt, and making his way downstairs to the kitchen.
“Why don’t we take Tony down to the hotel and get the rooms sorted? It’s about an hour away.”
“Yeah.” Tony twists his fingers together, expression sobering. “I’m- I won’t be able to make that date we had planned for tonight. My father-” Tony swallows hard,
So for this chapter I did quite a lot of research into some very scary drugs. The one that Ty gives Tony is called GHB, and most of the effects shown here are quite accurate but I’ve obviously tweaked it a bit to fit with the content I wanted etc. I’m not rEally sure why I’m sharing this but idk if there are any medical experts reading pls don’t come for me for 😂😂 aNyway, stay safe guys, and don’t go to parties without someone you trust
“I love you.” Steve says again, because he wants to say it a thousand times. “God I love you.”
“Nope. I was just finishing off work, but I can take it home! Tony was hovering, it’s probably a good idea that I leave now.”
And then suddenly, Tony’s so angry he can’t breathe, and his voice is rising again and he wants to break something or throw something and there's just so much of this
“Hi,” says Tony, swallowing hard and pulling the glasses off, because he’s
A hand taps the counter in front of him and a voice reaches his ears, low and smooth, snapping him out of his haze.
Steve sighs, leaning into the touch. He can feel an ache in his bones, but there’s no IV, which is a good sign at least.
He’s in his room in his apartment and he has no idea how he got there and no idea what happened but he knows that Ty was there-
Tony could have said it nicely, with a smile, but his parents are coming on Friday and he doesn’t have the brain space for this, because all he wants to do is kiss Steve and
“Steve.” Tony smiles slowly, dragging out his name as he takes the coffee. Steve feels his heart jump in his chest as Tony (definitely accidentally on purpose) brushes his fingers against his.
Ty holds Rhodey’s gaze for a long few seconds, and then laughs, standing up and taking his drink and smirking at Tony.
He doesn’t know how Howard knows, because it could have been anything. It could have been Obie, someone at the art gallery, someone from the press, anyone who’s been near him in the last month. It doesn’t fucking
and she gives him one right back which is distinctly more terrifying. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if
“My parents want to catch up.” His voice doesn’t waver, and he’s grateful. “They’re coming tomorrow, and I’ll be in a hotel with them. Probably won’t be able to talk much.”
“Rhodey.” He says quietly, touching his friend on the arm. “Leave it.”
“Okay. Promise.”
Tony’s eyes flicker open, and Steve swears he feels his heart stop. His eyes are glazed, unfocused, and as Ty shifts slightly, he can see the hands gripping Tony’s waist hard enough to bruise, the untucked shirt.
Obie smiles, meeting Tony’s eyes.
His voice is low, still husky with sleep, and Tony turns around to smile, reaching up to press a kiss to his lips.
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m not the one riding a motorcycle through Manhattan Tasha.”
Tony shrugs, nervous smile vanishing from his face. “No clue who that it is. Wait here.”
“He won’t be able to follow through on any of those. I’ll make sure of it.”
He wonders if his eyes can break from rolling them too hard.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” Tony’s voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “Tell me something about yourself?”
He knows. He does know. But he’s so sick of the panic, and he’s so so tired.
“I wanted to apologise for… being harsh. With my judgement of you.”
Tony’s voice is low. “I think we have different ideas of what the word consent means.”
There is no more blue glowing in the dark, and Steve can feel a part of him dying, and he can’t breathe, and
He smiles slightly, sliding his phone back into his pocket.
Her gaze softens slightly, in a way that Tony knows most people will never get to see.
most people would pay for, and tries to ignore the fact that his heart is beating far too fast to be casual.
“Because you were too close to him Tones.”
“Thanks for letting me know.”
Tony’s fingers grip his own a little tighter, and then he smiles.
“No.”
“The warrant-”
“No.”
He ignores Tony completely, giving Steve a humourless smile. “Rogers. We should talk.”
“So much. Too much. It scares me, and I’m scared of getting hurt, but I can’t walk away. I haven’t ever been able to walk away from you.”
He has no fucking clue what to wear. Jeans. Shirt. Jacket. He doesn’t have one of Steve’s hoodies; he wants one of Steve’s. He wants Steve now, wants Rhodey, and wants a fucking
Later. He can grieve later, be selfish with Steve later, and rest later.
“I broke into Obadiah Stane’s office.”
After a while, it could’ve been hours, maybe seconds, Tony pulls away, a small smile tugging at his lips.
Tony pulls away and smiles, golden brown eyes dancing with the city lights, and Steve realises there’s a part of him that’s been waiting for Tony Stark his whole life.
Steve takes drives them down to the lake again, and it’s become an unspoken thing between them now. The gravestones hurt too much, make him too angry because there’s no peace with Howard there too.
“What would happen if they did?”
“How have you never googled him?”
His friend shakes his head, starting to eat his lunch. “Nothing. That was just… A really crazy coincidence don't you think?"
Steve looks at him, searching his eyes, and for a second the apartment is silent. Tony can feel his heart beating fast, and forces himself to relax. It’s Steve. It’s

It’s his father.

“Fine.” He says loudly, because he really needs to stop thinking about this right now. “

He’s never heard Tony like this. He’s heard him sad, exhausted, happy, laughing. But this fear? This panic? He’s never heard this before.
Because Obie knows, he fucking knows who Ty is and what he has done and god Tony can’t
“No. Not really, but I just need to-”
His mother sits next to him, and something in his chest relaxes.

Steve smiles, lacing their hands together, and Tony leans into his warmth. It scares him, how different he is with Steve. It scares him how much he cares.
Steve hears a few muttered curses in Italian on the other side of the line, and resists the urge to smile.
“Oh wow, Mr Stane, it’s an honour to meet you! Tony said he knew you but no one
He breathes.
He frowns, signalling to Nat to pause the music playing from the speakers in her room. He’s at her dorm, helping her with some random essay to pass time. After having classes for the rest of his day following his shift, he needs a break, but Nat helps him out too much, so the least he can do is try to repay her.
did you manage to get us a place?”
Steve holds his gaze for a long second, and then nods, a humourless smile twitching on his lips.
They’ve… they’ve talked a lot over the past year, talked and talked and listened to each other, something that neither of them had been good at before. It makes Tony wonder what it would’ve been like if things had worked out differently
Steve shakes his head, turning to face Sam as the door shuts behind tony. Tony as in Tony Stark, heir to his father's billion-dollar company.
“Not at the expense of
Something about the nickname is doing a mix of making him feel hot all over, and annoyed. He decides to focus on annoyed. (Never mind the fact that he’s blushing again, and his pale skin is a real fucking giveaway.)
He doesn’t have to pretend to be nice though. As long as no one dies. At this point, Tony isn’t sure if it’s going to be him (his heart is pounding too fast) or Ty (because Rhodey is still looking at him with murder in his eyes.)
“Are coming to stay, and I’m going to be booked into a hotel. I know.”
(He won’t be surprised if she already knows, but that’s because it's Pepper Potts.)
His mother buys it, his father isn’t looking.
“Yeah. Just down the road from here.”
Steve, the barista with the very blue eyes, now has the personal number. He’s not sure how he feels about it.
“He fucking- you
“I mean it.” He says again, soft and honest and real, because Tony doesn’t hear it enough, if the look on his face is any indication. Steve tugs him closer, leaning in to press a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I love you.”
That's awe in his voice, such a fragile wonder that makes Tony scared to nod, scared to shatter something beyond repair. But he does anyway, because it's true, and there isn't anything he knows with more certainty in his life.
Because of
He swallows hard, starting to make the coffee and praying that this guy, whoever he is, waits quietly. He looks familiar, almost scarily so, but Steve can’t place his face for the life of him.
“Is that a captain America hoodie Mr Rogers?”
“Okay.”
“Can I-” Steve swallows, and Tony tips his head to the side, rearranging his expression into something unreadable. “Can we talk outside?”
He won’t drag Steve down with him.
All he does is hurt people. All he does is hurt Steve.
“Tones?”
There’s a pause. “Did he want something?” Tony asks carefully, trying to keep his tone neutral, standing up with a stretch and wincing as something in his shoulder clicks.
“Sure.” He says, pushing open the door. Staying with Rhodey is fine. Frankly, he’d rather be with Rhodey than anyone else. “Not an issue.”
“Do you want to come up?”
“What happened?”
this angry in his life.
Friday night, tomorrow morning, then he’s back in the afternoon. Steve’s words float back into his head.
. “It’s fine. I’m fine.”
“Be careful.” She says, voice low. “I’m not risking a cover just so you can bitch at me. Fury wanted you in, that’s not my decision to make. It had to be realistic and he had to buy it, so stop whining and go.”
Steve shakes his head, closing his eyes for a second. If he tells Tony, it will only add to the guilt, and there’s already so much of it in Tony’s voice, his eyes. He can’t be the one who makes it worse.
“When we get in there… it won’t be pretty. I can’t let him see a weakness, can’t give him the chance. If you come in, you might not like what you see.”

“Broken?”
“It’s good. To be able to dance, I mean. You should learn, and if there’s one thing I can do, it’s dance.”
Steve drops it, probably because he knows Tony doesn’t want to talk about anything else right now, and instead just holds tight. When he’s sure that he’s not about to break, Tony gently disentangles himself from the hug.
, he snarls at it, pushing it away with a strength he didn’t know he had.
And, so much like the endless expanse of galaxy that had made up Tony’s mind,
He isn’t sure when they walked away, but it’s silent now. His whole body is screaming.
“Buonanotte mamma.” [4] He says, because he’s not sure what else to say. He just wants to sleep, he wants
The person in question folds his arms, dark eyes narrowed, and definitely not falling for any of Steve’s bullshit.
He’s out like a light now, and his breathing is steady but there’s no way Steve’s going anywhere. He gently cleans his face, brushing a hand through his hair. Then he slides down until he’s sitting on the floor with his back against the bed.
Without hesitating, Steve pulls him against his chest as Tony’s voice breaks, closing his eyes and just
He clears his throat, trying for a smile. “Yeah. Sorry. Um, that would be amazing, but don’t you have things to-”
After all, they’re myths, legends, stories made up for children to help them feel hopeful about finding love one day. He’s lived enough of a life that he shouldn’t believe in these things, shouldn’t let himself believe in these things.
he looks so beautiful right now.
Sam points a finger at him; smirk breaking through the serious facade.
Part of him wonders if they should have waited, made it something special. But this is special, in a way. It’s so cold, Tony can feel it in his bones. But he’s warm, warm for the first time in a while because it’s cold at work and his apartment for more than one reason. Steve’s lips are soft, and he can taste the sweetness of what he had been drinking, and mint. His hands are so gentle, dragging a thumb across his cheekbone, and Tony feels every part of him relax.
Tony’s voice is light, filled with laughter.
Rhodey had once told him that when he gets hurt, he lashes out at the people who are trying to help. Anything to stop them seeing the damage that the hurt has done.
He knows that he sounds desperate, but he doesn’t care. Because Tony… he needs to hear it. Again and again and again until it sticks.
So he turns up to all of the lunches, he smiles every time, talks about his teaching job at MIT. He definitely
“Sure. I like computers, it’ll be fun.”
Steve lets out a breath, reaching out and taking his hand gently.
“Him.”
tell him this.” He turns back to Steve. “So you either do some
Two minutes later, Nat slides into the driver's seat. She doesn’t say a word until they’re on the road again, and then she quietly asks for Tony’s address. Steve gives it to her.
They stay like that for a while, Tony isn’t sure how long, but when he eventually pulls away, his eyes are dry.
Tony closes his eyes, letting himself relax against Steve. And then two minutes later, he sits up; raising his eyebrows at the noise he had just heard.
“You’re not
“Bullshit.” Says Fury, a quiet smile on his face. The smug bastard knows. He knows he’s won. “Shall we do some introductions? I feel like everyone should be on the same page here before we continue.”
“Surprisingly yes. I feel a hell of a lot better.”
“Ribs,” Tony says quietly.
Steve huffs a laugh and nods, taking the phone and starting to look through it.
for him.
Swallowing hard, Tony eases himself out of bed, careful not to wake Steve up, and pads across the floor to pick up his shirt that had been discarded last night.
He’s almost surprised to hear Howard talking to him, but masks it well.
He releases a breath, closing his eyes for a second. “I’m worried about Obie, about my father. They like to hit back when they’re threatened and-”
His father takes a step towards him, and he’s going to be sick, he’s going to throw up or his heart is going to burst out of his chest-
Steve laughs, lacing their fingers together, and Tony leans into his warmth, putting everything else out of his mind.
Steve swallows. Hard. “That’s $3.50.”
Tony tenses, a spike of fear going through him. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Captain frown slightly, eyes flicking between Tony and the director in front of them. If Tony says no, he suspects Fury will tell the Captain anyway. If he says yes, he’s agreeing to the mission. But judging by the look on Fury’s face, no isn’t really a word the man is used to hearing.
. It’s him or Steve, but he already knows what his answer is.
Helen Cho tells him that he’s lucky to be alive. He doesn’t mention that he's not, not really. His heart is still there, left in the frozen air of Siberia.
“Nope.” He can
“Steve, just drop it.”
“While I’m really enjoying this, it’s not exactly why I came here.”
Once he reaches the room, he only knocks once before pushing it open.
Steve raises his eyebrows, ignoring the second part of that question. “He graduated at 18?"
Evidently, the universe hates him.
“Go ahead.” Steve says, eyes flicking to Tony’s for a second.
He thinks back to the conversation. It had been a night like this, only a few weeks after they had met. Tony had drunk a little too much, making him relaxed, flirty, and curious. He’d asked Steve’s favourite music. Steve had said anything by Frank Sinatra, because he didn’t think Tony would be someone to judge music taste. He had been right. The genius had just smiled at him, eyes soft.
“JARVIS?”
Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing.
“Captain Rogers is the leading agent on this mission. We’re dealing with international terrorists. We know they’re dangerous. The less you know the better.”
He’s never seen Nat stumble over words or hesitate, but she’s nervous now, that much he can tell.
“I’ll see you tomorrow night?” He says, fighting to keep the smile on his face.
“I wanted to go for dinner. I still want to go for dinner.”
“Ty…” Steve sees Tony swallow, eyes shuttering slightly, and
“Tony.” He resists the urge to swallow as Tony turns his full attention on him. The intensity of his gaze is still there, the raging emotions and anger still linger. Being directly under his eyes right now is a little terrifying, but Steve ignores it, hands reaching up to cup his face. “Listen to me. He killed them, I know. He’s an awful person, but he’s not going to hurt anyone again if we do this. If you leave it, he’s going to come after you, because you’re a threat to him. He’s running scared.”
“Can I take your order?”
“Details.”
“Tony Stark.”
“You want to stay?”
Obie first. Because if he’d said it was an accident, and Tony knows it wasn’t, then that means-
“I love you.” Tony says, and Steve’s grip on his waist tightens a little as he opens his eyes.
“Jesus Christ Rogers. You’re going out for dinner with him.”
He spends longer than he cares to admit in bed that morning, staring at the ceiling.
because if I had the choice I would pick to protect you, every single
It takes a second to adjust to the light as it filters in around him. He blinks against the brightness of it, a low hiss of pain escaping as he moves.
He closes his eyes, tipping forward and resting his head against Steve’s chest. He can feel his heartbeat, the rhythm is steady and solid and
“Nope. The store was shut, I’m going to another.”
“Yes. I love you. So fucking much.”
That's a prickle of shame he can feel. Shame and disgust at himself, because he knows Steve is a better person than he will ever be, and it only makes him want him more.
Everything fades away again.
Tony laughs as he cuts across him.
“I said nothing.”
would you think it’s ever okay to give in to
His boyfriend blinks at him, dark eyes flashing with the reflection of so many lights around them. “Yes what?”
Tony lasts three hours in the office before he breaks.
Tony laughs, seeing how red he’s gone, and it’s a dark laugh, voice slipping into something that reminds Steve of sin wrapped in silk. “
“Eighteen.”
Tony shakes his head, shoving his hands into the pockets of his hoodie and sitting down on the edge of Steve’s bed. Clint is out again, and Tony is grateful for the privacy.
“Don’t worry, he seems like a good kid.”
He shakes his head. “I’m a mechanic Fury, I don’t do tech decryption.”
Okay. He’s been watching too much true crime. And hasn’t had enough sleep.
“She was driving. They were both killed instantly.” Obadiah says quietly. “They wouldn't have been in any pain.”
“Double shot latte,” Obie says with a smirk, getting out of the car and leaning against it. From this angle, he’ll have a good view of the entirety of the cafe, and Tony fucking hates him for it.
“Oh?”
“I won’t say it’s nice to see you again, it’s not.”
“Ignore it.”
the smile in Steve’s voice, hear the warm curl to all the words that are coming out of his mouth. “I just don’t understand the problem.”
“Anywhere else?” Rhodey asks, because he knows him too well, and he knows what Howard is like.
It looks familiar. Or maybe familiar is the wrong word. But it’s tugging at him, pushing at him to look, to
“That’s cool.” Steve sits down next to him, grabbing his laptop and pulling it open. “Is there anything you want to watch?”
The person speaking is someone he knows. He definitely knows him, would know him anywhere. But his tone... it’s barely recognisable. It’s cold, hard. He’s only heard it one other time. Memories of a café flicker into his minds eye, an older man with a shark smile, and any lingering joy on the boy’s face vanishing.
He sees the Captain shoot him a look, but ignores it.
Hi so if Tony's internal monologue makes absolutely no sense then I apologise but I sort of feel that's the kind of place his head is in right now so-
He forces himself to keep walking.
He can’t see Tony’s face, but he can imagine what’s on it right now. Because Steve… he can guess. He can fucking
“Like… they don’t know you’re gay?”
His phone is in his room, in his coat pocket. It’s on silent because Steve had been here and Steve had been in his bed so he hadn’t been
“He's not worth anything.”
They talk for hours in the tiny restaurant. Tony orders them both desserts when the clock hits 11, and it’s a cake that’s sweet and soft, and it’s
“But I didn’t.” Steve cuts across him, trying to keep his voice steady “I didn’t because you saved me.”
him, does he?
“How could I forget?” Steve says dryly, hanging up with a laugh.
He inclines his head, and Steve sees Tony’s hand shift in his lap a little, the only outward show of tension.
“Tony?”
And yet.
“What are you-”
For the first time in three days, he can’t feel the cold.
“I didn’t want to make it worse.”
He raises his eyebrows, a smile tugging at his lips against his will. “Or, you could try sleeping?”
He jumps slightly, nearly knocking over the glass of water next to him. When he finally gets over the flush of embarrassment for long enough to focus on the person in front of him, he almost starts blushing.
could he be any more fucking
Tony picks up his phone, and Steve hears it ring for less than a second before the person on the other side picks up.
Rhodey shakes out his hand, a slightly satisfied look on his face.
Coming for the first time after everything… it had been terrifying. He hadn't known if he’d wanted him back in his life, back in his heart. But then he’d realised that Steve Rogers had never really left his goddamn heart, and he hated him for it for so long.
“Stay.” He whispers, eyes still closed, clearly half asleep.
Another laugh, and Steve wonders how exactly he has ended up on a date with someone who has a laugh like this. A laugh that makes him feel an unfamiliar mix of proud and awed, and all he wants to do is make him laugh again.
“What.”
“Helicopter parent.” Peter whispers loudly as he leaves, and Tony decides against aiming a rude gesture at the closing door.
, and Steve feels sick, aching to reach out and pull Tony to him, wanting the other man
“How are you feeling?” Tony says, touching his face lightly. His touch is gentle, so much more gentle than Obadiah’s, and Steve feels an overwhelming urge to close his eyes and sleep for a year.
“You’re one to talk.”
“Hurts.” He manages to get out, fighting to keep his eyes open.
“We’re okay now.”
It crashes back into him with the force of a wave.
Once Clint goes back to his work, he spends five minutes looking at the phone; finger hovering over call button on the number that Tony has given him.
He shakes his head, exasperated, and looks at the phone in his hand. The smart thing, he knows, would be to get rid of that number, and stay the hell away from Tony Stark and his practiced, beautiful smiles.
Point is, it’s usually an assumption, even if he’s not really sure it’s what he wants. Have a drink with Tony Stark, make out with Tony Stark, and fuck Tony Stark. In that order. Apart from Steve, who just wanted to watch a movie and kiss him and make him laugh. It makes Tony want to cry, and then protect him from the worst parts of the world.
“You can when you’ve just had your ass kicked by people trained to kick ass for a shit load of money. Deal with it.”
“I thought you’d be older.” The Captain says eventually, a half smile crossing his lips. “You’re twenty five, right?”
hesitates to argue with. He just wants- he wants to tell him, and he wants Steve to protect him from it all. But how far does protection go when its from two of the most powerful men in the country.
“Happy told me about a sweet little coffee shop that you like. I need some caffeine, and it’s close by. Know the one?”

“Cap?”
more than anything else. “That’s how the world works, that’s how
Steve hits him lightly with the closest cushion, still blushing like mad, and Tony laughs again, the sound sending a shiver down his spine.
“Be quick,” Obadiah says, and then pulls out his phone, a clear dismissal. Swallowing the mix of anger and nausea, Tony walks inside, sliding his hands into his pockets.
“And he treated me like
thing holding him together. “I know. It’s okay.”
“There’s been an accident.”
“You know I didn’t want to date him just for the sex.”
College parties were made to screw you over, he thinks as he takes a step a little too fast and the dull ache in his head becomes a lot more painful. He doesn’t know why he had thought it would be a good idea. It’s fine. He can put all the blame on Nat, who had been the person to drag his ass all the way to the party for the hell of it.
“What?”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and Tony realises that he smiles with his whole face. His eyes light up, and his lips-
“I’m here, I’m here.”
“Not even-”
than this and maybe if he was better it wouldn’t even fucking
It’s now 11:50am, and he’s got three hours and ten minutes until they arrive. He doesn’t have time to go and see Steve again, because he doesn’t want to be caught off guard if his father decides to arrive early.
He can tell Steve part of the truth at least, he owes him this much after treating him like shit.
He’s not even sure
“You can't do this. I run this company, I keep it alive. You’ll be lost without me, without your father. Put this aside Tony.”
“Look,” Tony says carefully, because he’s not in a position to be pushing Steve for anything, not after today. “I didn’t want to-”
“Of course,” says Obie with the smile that Tony hates. “But your father is the host, and he’s given me permission to get rid of anyone… making trouble.”
Lunch with Obadiah Stane has gone from once a year, to twice a year, to almost every month.
that they get away with this shit just because he has money and power.”
As they make their way out of the tiny apartment, Steve considers leaving his phone behind. What good will it do anyway, apart from sending him right back to square one of this new fixation.
“Sto bene. Sono solo stanco,” [3] he says, matching her tone with a small, genuine smile. The words are soothing, and there’s something beautiful about the language that he’s never quite been able to get with anything else.
“He didn't-”
Ten minutes later, a waitress walks up to their table. He doesn’t turn to see who’s with her, but from the way she’s stumbling over her words, it doesn’t take a lot to guess.
“He-”
“Just promise me you won’t get weird and embarrassed because of this?”
It’s fine. They’re fine.
When Steve finally notices him, his voice is hesitant, worried. That’s good, it’ll make Tony feel less guilty about having a conversation that will probably end in him being an asshole.
“It wasn’t like I had much of a fucking choice!” He yells.
“Did what you thought was right. I don’t agree with it, and I hate that you have to do it, and you better give me some sort of warning next time, but I don’t hate you. I promise.”
“Uh huh. Or… you could just stay the night?”
The first hit is in the face. The second knocks the wind out of him. On the third, he hears something crack. By the forth, he stops counting, because the pain makes everything fuzzy, and he can’t think, can’t
“According to myth, he doesn’t trust anyone.” Tony mutters, heading over to where Peter is sitting. “Looks good.”
As soon as the door shuts behind him, Tony exhales, turning around to face Steve. The burning anger is almost gone, a tiny sliver of it still lingering in his eyes. He doesn’t speak, just wordlessly leaning into Steve. He can feel Tony shaking, and he’s not sure whether it’s anger or fear, or maybe both.
“Bullshit. You think coffee is equivalent to weed killer.”
“You can’t dance.” Tony says, fond amusement faltering for a second to give way to surprise. It’s not rude, just curious. A little incredulous, but not rude. Not judgemental. Tony rarely is judgemental, no matter how many times the tabloids say otherwise.
Rhodey frowns slightly. “You know what it shows?”
Steve blinks, and
Something in him relaxes, and he nods. “Okay. Okay.”
Obie smirks, and Tony gives him a look.
Then his phone buzzes with a text and he groans, pulling it out of his pocket carefully, trying not to move Tony. It’s Clint, and he needs help with an assignment. For a second, he considers saying no, but then he remembers how much help his friend gives
Purpose, it’s what Tony needs, what he has now. First the crash, then Obie, then the company. The rest will follow. He takes a deep breath.
Tony laughs, burying his head in Steve’s shoulder and pulling him into a hug. When he speaks again, his voice is slightly muffled. “Well okay then.”
He swears under his breath, turning to Obie with a look of apology in his eyes. “I’ll pay for this, just text me the details. I’m so sorry, I really have to go and help.”
His second phone, the one with Steve’s number, the one with Rhodey’s number, is in his jacket pocket in his room. Obadiah’s tone doesn’t leave a lot of space for arguing.
Not alone.
Tony feels his cheeks heat slightly. “I guess so?”
He doesn’t focus on where he’s going. Doesn’t really matter anyway. Rhodey seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to knowing where he is at all times, and it’s not like the teachers are that fussed.
“He totally did.” Says Sam with a grin as Natasha pushes herself up until she’s sitting on the counter top
Steve sits back, moving his hand away and just meeting his gaze. He doesn’t answer the question.
“I’m not-”
Tony pokes his arm gently, eyes glittering with humour. “Somehow I doubt that.”
He knows Rhodey is out of town. So Obie then. He ignores the dread that settles in his stomach, ignores the fact that he wants to do nothing more than turn back time to kissing Steve.
Steve nods, resisting the urge to flip Nat off, and grabs his apron off a hook behind the counter.
The soothing silence remains, and the air is clean, refreshing.
“You’re going to tear your stitches.” Tony says quietly, reaching out as if he’s going to touch him, and then pulling his hand back. “You need to rest.”
“Nat,” he says quietly, aware of the fact that Tony is now slipping in and out of consciousness. “Thank you for coming and helping.”
You’re-”
He really doubts it.
“You know your father is only hard on you because he loves you.”
Tony lifts a shoulder, sliding his hands into his pockets. He’s in sweatpants and a t shirt, and even though it’s not the first time Steve has seen him out of the formal suits that do
“Hi.” He manages to get out, throat dry.
“Ow.”
“No. It’s not. It’s
He remembers when the news had come in, around this time of the morning last year. The week following had been a blur of people apologising for his loss, shaking his hand and telling him that his father
Tony's expression hardens. “Goodbye Obie.” He says. “Have a nice life.”
He doesn’t recognise his own voice. The panic hasn’t hit yet, he hasn’t given it the chance. It’s just numb. Detached.
He doesn’t move for a while, even when he hears footsteps behind him.
“Be quick.”
He doesn’t kiss him of course, but
what he did to me.”
He’s so glad his voice is steady. So
It’s beautiful. All of it.
Tony’s lips quirk into a smile, the gentle amusement back. Everything seems to make Tony smile or laugh, whether that’s a new invention, one of Rhodey’s jokes, or Steve. He always seems to have that look of soft, almost contemplative amusement on his features when he looks at Steve, like he knows he’s supposed to be smiling, but can’t quite work out why.
flashing across his face at the words. “My father wants me at a party. It’s… it’s a company thing. I’m expected to make appearances.”
Rhodey would tell him to go to the hospital, but that would mean more questions, more lies, more effort. His ribs are still aching. They’re not broken, he knows what that feels like, because sometimes Howard hits harder than he just had. Once, his father joked that he's become less breakable over time.
“You okay?” He says quietly, and Tony nods, leaning into his touch, eyes still closed as Steve tilts his head up and kisses him.
attitude that’s gotten him out of too many hard conversations. “No. He finds this shit out. Ty probably told him to be honest.”
It starts becoming a little easier to breathe.
Because he was scared. Because he still is scared. So scared.

“In a couple of hours, I promise. Just let us help.”

Hammer smirks, leaning back on the grass. “Yeah Stark, why don't you go and sit down like the good little

“I’m not going to run.” Steve says softly, fingers carding through his hair. “I haven’t before, I won’t now. Do what you have to do, and I’m going to be there, every step of the way.”
Steve bites back the reassurances, the urge to help and hold and
Tony yanks the thing out of his pocket, swearing under his breath. He’s not in the mood-
“You good?”
Silence.
His head is filled with white noise, and he doesn’t even think before he answers.
For the first time in a while, he thinks that he might be okay.
For the first time in a while, Tony finds he can answer honestly.
Rhodey tugs at his arm. “Just leave it. He’s not worth anything.”
“Thanks.” The man smiles again, and it looks familiar.
“No? How noble of you.”
“Tony-”
He turns around, and Tony winds his arms around his neck, reaching up to kiss him. He realises that it might be more than what Tony is telling him. That maybe he just doesn’t want to be alone.
He’s not thinking about Ty now. He’s
He flinches hard, flinches back like he’s expecting Steve to lash out, to hit him, because it’s an instinct, just an instinct, and with Howard-
“What about him?” Says Tony slowly, unsure where the conversation is going.
Steve whips around to face him, scowling. “Sam told you.” It’s not a question.
“Maybe if you hadn’t tried to kill the people I love, we wouldn’t be in this situation.”
He goes back to his apartment first, changing into a suit, because he would bet his life that Obie is going to be in a shit mood today after that phone call, and he would rather be on the side of caution.
“Yeah.”
. It’s like an anchor in the constant whirlwind that is Tony’s mind. But he
“No it was more that you thought-”
“Hey, what’s going on? Talk to me.”
Steve doesn’t have a key to his apartment.
Steve had to find that out eventually, one way or another.
He re-focuses his attention on Tony, watching as he starts to spin the fork between his middle and index fingers. “My mother is Italian. I don’t use it a lot, but I like coming here. It’s one of the only properly authentic Italian places in New York.
Tony hits the exit button fast, and Steve can see his hands trembling. He glances at Steve for a second, and then his gaze lands on Pepper. When he speaks, his voice is surprisingly steady.
Okay,
Unfortunately, Tony Stark does not get any less attractive between coffee visits.
Good.
He’s barely passing all his classes, so partying hadn’t been, and won’t ever be, the smarter choice, especially when it makes him late for his one current source of income. If it wasn’t for the scholarship that’s paying for so much of his funding, Steve doesn’t know where he would be, but it certainly wouldn’t be in college.
“Steve?”
Obadiah gives him another one of those smiles, and it’s a reminder that Tony is surrounded by sharks every day.
Steve. He just fucking-
Tony counts the seconds of silence. He gets to 6 and a half before Steve releases his hand.
He locks the bathroom door behind him once he gets across the busy restaurant, bracing his hands on the sink and sucking in a breath. When he glances at the mirror, he looks fine. A little tense, but fine. Normal. He glances at his arm, and the skin is red. Not bruised, but it probably will be tomorrow.
“I’ll sort the car.” Pepper says, already tapping away at her phone. “Give me twenty minutes. Your security detail will have to go up for a while.”
“I hope you killed him.” His voice is low, and all he can think about is Tony, Tony younger than he is now, Tony being trapped with Ty-
All eyes flick to the billionaire, and his eyes are darker than Steve has ever seen before when he meets them. The grief… the grief has been shoved aside again. Steve wonders how much energy it takes to do that, how much effort.
His heartbeat isn’t too fast anymore, it’s steady. He pulls gently against Steve’s grip, and he lets him go, shifting backwards slightly.
“I love you.” Steve says, leaning in again. Tony’s lips are warm despite the cold air, and he wants to stay here forever. “Thank you so much for this.”
He can’t say it, he can’t even- The look on Steve’s face is near to devastation. This conversation- he was never meant to have this conversation with Steve.
“Obadiah has an SI issued email, and a personal one. I'm going to get into both, see if I can access his bank details. Recent transactions can be a killer.”
Happy’s voice snaps him out of his thoughts.
“Tell me Steve.”
But he's not fine. Or at least he wasn't. He thinks about the shouting they’d both done, Ty, Obadiah, Howard, the rain, everything that he had told Steve. He thinks about the weight that seems to have… not vanished. But lessened. He can breathe easily now.
There’s silence for a second, and Tony knows that everyone in the room is thinking the same thing.
Steve didn’t know Tony’s voice could sound like that, didn’t know he was capable of that much ice cold, vicious,
“Tony-”
“I can’t-”
God, he’s too sober for this conversation with Steve,
“You have a great ass. Sue me.”
“Sure,” Steve says, but he can’t shake a knot of nerves in his stomach. “Want me to bring a hangover cure or something?”
thing Obadiah can use against me! And guess what! He fucking
“Hi. I was beginning to think you weren’t going to show up.”
“Hey!” Nat yells as they push their way through to the clear space. “This is insane.”
The silence returns.
“I’m putting Pepper in charge of the funeral arrangements, if you have any questions, take it up with her.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, and Tony knows he means it in more than one way. But Steve shouldn't be asking him, shouldn’t be worrying about him, he’s fine-
“Looks good on you. I like seeing you in my clothes.”
“I never hated you.”
“I hate you, I hate you, I hate you-”
, his mind says, his body says.
But he wants him, more than he’s wanted anything in a while. He’s always been selfish, far too selfish to deny himself this.
“I wouldn’t.”
“I’m glad you like it so much.” He says quietly, and Steve realises that they’ve finished the song, and it’s immediately started to repeat. The lyrics start for the second time, and Steve feels himself relax.
to me.”
“Tony.” He says again, softly, taking a step forward.
Two days later, the billionaire's son saunters back into the cafe, this time leaving an older man standing outside, and Steve feels a finger prod him in the back, shoving him towards the till. He glares at Nat, turning back towards him.
“Shame.” Tony mutters, turning back towards the jar with a grin and nodding towards it. “I was looking at this. For some reason it interested me, don’t ask why. You know i’m not an art person.”
“Stop freaking out. It’s dinner, and no one is judging, least of all me.”
“Figured you could use this.”
do right.
it had been a bad idea to tell Natasha that he was taking Tony to see his art. She had called Sam, who had called Clint, and they’d all been blowing up his phone with texts asking how it had gone.
“What’s up baby?” Steve says again, and his voice is low, gentle. Soothing.
“Obie?”
Steve clears his throat, forcing himself to focus on literally anything else, or they definitely won’t be leaving the apartment on time.
Silence.
“Excellent,” he says dryly, “but the staring speaks for itself I’m afraid. You have a shit poker face.”
It’s too late now.
He would bet his life that both of them probably have keys.
about this?”
“So you’re sending us on a suicide mission.” Tony says flatly, smile gone.
“That’s my cue sweetheart. See you around, and have a think about dinner.”
Steve blushes, crossing his arms.
Tony shrugs, standing too, and brushes an invisible speck of dust off his suit.
“I’ll never spill my secrets. Now, for fucks sake, just
He shouldn’t have done it, shouldn’t have looked, and now he feels worse because it’s always girls with him, always women.
“Captain,” says Fury, “why don’t you start us off? No information disclosed in this room leaves it.”
“That looks like it hurts a little-”
“M’sorry,” Tony murmurs into his shirt as he pulls him upright, supporting him with both hands. It’s the first fucking time Tony has ever apologised to him, and it’s for something that is the furthest from his fault as anything can be
“Not really.”
“Pepper told me what happened.”
“Hey, hey hey baby, what’s going on? Are you okay?”
“Sorry,” he mutters. “He puts me on edge.”
“Can you-”
“You were staring. Also, I can literally
Clint gives him a wicked smile, shaking his head.
“I-” Steve blinks, looking more confused than anything else. “What? Who the hell asks you about any of that shit?”
” Tony says quietly, “cost people their lives. It wasn’t what I wanted to be a part of. It wasn’t your fault, but you understand why I can’t come back.”
“Stay with Rhodes today. It’s too easy to get lost in this place.”
When they get there, the cafe is just opening, and Steve can literally
Of course he is, of course he’s trying to catch him out, of course he’s going through Pepper instead of just telling Tony himself.
“I just want you to talk to me!" Steve shouts, and a part of Tony is still in shock because this is
Rhodey’s eyebrows shoot up, and it looks like he’s barely holding back a smile.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispers again, and Steve wants nothing more than to reach out, to brush away the anguish he knows written into every line of his face, to say something,
“Tony?”
Tony’s smile is sad.
“Tony,” Steve says softly, eyes a little sad. “You can let him speak.”
Nat breaks the silence with a half smile.
“You can’t promise that.” Tony says quietly, “but it doesn’t matter what I think, clearly.”
“You do from
For a second, there’s nothing but shocked silence. Tony has always been sarcastic with Obie, to a point. But he’s never said no with so little hesitation, not like this.
“Rhodey-” His voice sounds shaky, young. Scared.
s of grief that are cresting in Tony’s eyes right now.
“Oh?”
The energy around them is amazing, and so, so alive. There must be thousands of people in the square, despite the freezing weather.
Thank you so much for sticking with me through the long process of my procrastination and obsession with angst. (Em and Siya, you guys have more patience with me than most, so thank you. I love you both to the moon and back)
It's an eternity before the pain starts to come back to him. It’s muted now, so much more muted than before. It’s like… he’s in a bubble. Removed from everything else around him.
He swallows hard, closing his eyes for a second. It’s quiet here, there’s no roaring noise in his head, but no numbness either. He feels… peaceful, for the first time in a while.
“Anything in particular?”
“Steve.”
“Steve. Breakfast. Food.”
He turns to face Tony as he comes up behind him, breath catching slightly. Relief, that's relief that he can feel now that Tony is standing in front of him. The genius’s face is mostly in shadows because of the dim streetlights, but Steve can still see parts of him, flashes that make him want to freeze time and pick up a pencil. Brown curly hair, and those dark eyes, his gaze far too intense for this time of the evening. He’s dressed up, probably more appropriately for the restaurant than Steve is, but somehow that doesn't matter right now.
Like an eighteen year old boy who’s just scared for someone he loves.
“I need some air.”
Steve, Bucky, Steve.
god. Fuck,
“Please.” He says again, and his voice is barely louder than a whisper. This is the only goddamn thing he’ll
because it’s Steve.
“Uh. I think he wanted you to look over some damage to his gear. I told him I could do it but...I don’t think he trusts me with it.”
“Yes. Thank you.” The billionaire says with a half smile. “You’ve done your country a great service.”
“I’m guessing you guys want waffles. And coffee?”
Obadiah holds his gaze for a second, but Steve doesn’t falter, meeting it head on. And then the man nods, giving Steve a smile that reminds him of a shark.
His voice has shifted into something else. Stark Industries Tony is like a different person, and it's someone he knows nothing about. Steve watches him and sees his face change in half a second as the other person on the phone speaks. There’s silence for a minute, and then Tony starts to talk, his voice tense.
“He’s gone.” Says Steve quietly, dragging his hands through Tony’s hair. “He’s gone.”
“You’re scared of them.” It isn't a question, but Tony still shakes his head.
“Listen. I’m not mad; I’m not holding it against you. I just thought-“
He tightens his grip on Steve’s hand, closing his eyes, and he’s so glad he doesn’t flinch when he feels a hand brush across his cheek. Gentle, his touch is so gentle. Tony could get lost in it, get lost in this feeling of uncontrollable peace.
“Do you want anything?”
Ty leans forwards again, raising his eyebrows.
So lunch.
“That wasn’t what I was going to ask.”
“That’s my life!” He shouts, and dimly, he realises that at some point the rain has started, because it’s New York in November so of course it has. The cold is a shock for a second, but he grits his teeth.
Tony leans in and kisses him. Steve tastes like coffee and snow and something sweet and warm and
There’s silence, Ty is smiling, panic is clawing at Tony’s skin, and he wants
Steve laughs, taking the coffee that Tony hands to him. He really could listen to it forever.
Tony had then proceeded to smile, drink, and laugh his way through the first half of the evening. When the first person, one of his ex girlfriends actually, asks him shyly what happened to his face, he smirks, and explains what ‘happened’ with dum-e.
But loving him is easier; it’s so much easier. He knows this now.
When Steve Rogers drags himself into work in the morning, he swears that he won’t ever drink again.
He sees so much in Steve’s eyes. Sadness, worry, fear, exhaustion, a tiny flash of savage pleasure at the idea. But then it fades, and it’s only Steve left. Honest, beautiful,
, not now.
“Baby-”
“Stop overthinking,” he says, and Tony looks up, confused.
“I didn’t,” he says stubbornly, and Steve swallows the frustration because it’s not Tony’s fault it’s Ty’s, but he has no idea what is in Tony’s system right now.
Tony smirks, and it’s razor sharp as he pulls the slim folder Pepper had given him out of his jacket.
“I was beginning to think you were angry with me over something.”
“Could you just… tell him I’ll talk to him tomorrow.”
It’s the first time he acknowledged it out loud for years, since the one time Rhodey had refused to take his bullshit excuses as an answer.
The next year, Tony doesn’t stay in bed.
“Let’s get you some air sweetheart. You look like you need to lie down for a bit.”
The exhaustion is hitting him now, hitting hard, but he isn’t complaining as he sinks into the cushions, body relaxing.
“I can and I will. You work outside the law, so I work outside the law. Difference is, I’m a lot better at getting what I want than you are, and you’ve managed to piss me off. Now Steve here is usually the one who counsels mercy, but thanks to you, he's not feeling particularly talkative today, and I'm not feeling very forgiving. That will be all."
Reed rested a hand on Steve’s shoulder, “I know,” he said, gently, “But there is no other choice, and, you won’t be alone, you have your daughter, she is counting on you to survive, she needs you Steve, you have to live. For her.”
“If he’s helping us out he deserves to know.”
“Well we are still going through all of the information we’ve gathered about A.I.M and Killian.” Natasha said, “But there are several clear instances where A.I.M was involved with Hydra.” Natasha rolled her eyes while Steve and Tony groaned at the news, which, to be honest was not overly surprising. Hydra seemed to have stuck their filthy fingers into every pie in the world, especially the poisonous pies like A.I.M.
Disabling the first ship was easy, then as they went to the second one they were spotted by Rumlows band of assholes and the fighting began.
Thor smiled, “You didn’t little one. No one blames you for being upset, and it is all over now, no harm done.”
Tony was worryingly quiet the whole way, not even complaining about being carried by Steve, just staring with too large eyes that darted around as if he were afraid of unseen, unheard enemies being close by.
“They had only just met.” Pierce countered, “And while they seem to now be working together, having found Zola’s remains, they had no prior contact to their first meeting in Stuttgart.”
Tony practically had an orgasm over Steve’s Harley, he actually moaned lewdly as he looked over the bike, stating that he had to get himself one.
Tony lifted his dark eyes meeting the concerned and painfully loving blue of Steve’s, “Its going to be okay sweetheart.”
“This is the bestest day ever!” Zach enthused as he explored his new Tardis.
Sam nodded, “Sure, come on in, I’ve got a first aid kit.”
“Write something.” He instructed.
“Dear God fuck my life!” Tony moaned, “What do I have to do to get a lay in?”
“Five thousand?” MJ stared at him with a mixture of shock and envy on her face.
“What do you think Rogers and his merry band of assholes are going to do now?” She asked looking between Vision, Rhodey, Tony, and Steve.
Before Steve could stop him, Deadpool was loping after Tony and wrapping an arm about his shoulders, which wouldn’t have been too bad had he not been pushing his pelvis against Tony’s hip.
“Hi.” He said approaching the boy, “What’s your name?”
“Man, that’d suck.” Ned said sympathetically.
Steve found Tony scrubbing a pouting, scowling, and sniffling Zach clean of the oats, while wearing a lot of them himself over his clothing and in his hair, the bathroom floor was covered in them, the sink, the walls, even the ceiling had oats on them.
Zach glared at him, bottom lip wobbling and eyes watery looking like he was going to burst into tears, but to everyone’s astonishment he spread his lips and spat directly into the mans face!
“Shall we still be slumbering beneath the stars tonight and toasting more of the springy sugar objects?” Thor asked.
“Is he why you have the glowy thing?” Zach asked, meaning the arc reactor.
Tony snorted and nodded his head, “But not for at least another hour, Mamma needs more sleep.”
Steve and Tony spent the New Years Eve quietly in the Tower, holding their new Son as they watched the fireworks.
Engage in sexual activities outside of the privacy of personal quarters. (Emphasis on this to Tony.)
“Thunderbutt!” Zach laughed, “Like Thor after Bruce’s jalfrezi!”
*****

To save off confusion. MCU Steve will be referred to as Rogers, while EMH Steve will be Steve.
For several minutes Tony threw up with Steve holding him steady and making soothing noise until there was nothing left in Tony’s body to come back up. He then sat Tony down against the sink stand and flushed the toilet, getting to his feet and filling one of the tooth mugs with water and the other he brought for Tony to spit into after he’d rinsed his mouth.
Bucky looked to Sam, “Why isn’t he in an asylum?” Sam glanced at Deadpool who was actually tweeting,
“But Mamma!!!!!”
Peter looked at the laptop, “Fine.” He said, “How about with you?”
“It wasn’t that bad…” Rhodey began, then gave up with a shrug as Tony shot him a death glare.
“Get lost Squidward!” Tony yelled to Ebony Maw, “You’re not welcome on this planet, leave now and we don’t break you into little pieces.”
They all went to see the Christmas tree in Washington Square Park and went skating at the Rockefeller Centre. Zach wasn’t quite coordinated enough to skate alone, so everyone took it in turns to support him as he skated around the rink.
“Welcome home.”
Peter was sat meekly in the school office and looked up with wide sad eyes when Tony and Steve arrived.
“Ooooh what time?” Clint asked jumping to his feet and glared at his crotch where several paint balls had struck, “Really Nat?” He asked, very thankful that he’d been wearing armour covering that area. Natasha shrugged and smirked back at him, until she saw the stick on darts that were stuck to both of her breasts, then she slapped him upside the head.
“Fine, me and Peter will meet. You good for that Spidey?”
“What are you seeing?” MJ Asked.
“I wish I knew.” Tony said. “But what I can tell you is that no matter what you and Peter do Steve and I will always love you.”
“That’d be Mr or Dr Stark, to you, Captain.” Tony snarled, “Only my friends call me Tony.” He looked behind Steve to Coulson’s blood stains, they’d almost been friends, been something more than colleagues. Tony was going to miss him.
He would be stuck there then, trapped in his powerless suit, watching with eyes that he couldn’t close as the Chitauri who’d survived the Nuke swarmed towards him, weapons ready to rip him apart, if he would lucky the lack of air would kill him before they did, but he was never that lucky, it never ended until he was in their grasp, his last piece of protection from the vacuum being ripped off him, exposing his damaged body to space.
Giggling maniacally, Wanda approached Tony, taking sadistic pleasure in the fear she saw in his dark eyes, “Now,” She purred, as she reached him, “Why don’t we take a little look inside your mind?”
“What greater matter?” Wanda sulkily asked, slouching in her seat and studying her nails.
“Friend?” Bucky half laughed half cried, “The man you were friends with died seventy years ago. I might have some of his memories but I am not that man. Not after all I’ve seen and done and survived. All I wanted was to be left alone, Rogers, and if you really were my friend you’d have granted me that.”
“If I may?” Jarvis cut in, “The ambulance has arrived.”
Clint’s video ended with him moaning and groaning like a woman in labour and clutching his aching, bloated stomach after he’d stuffed down ten-thousand calories in twenty-four hours.
“Bullshit.” Natasha spat.
Rhodey had blamed it on Howard and Maria for being shit parents, and the fact that Tony had been mercilessly bullied throughout his school years, for being so much younger than his classmates.
Three coconuts sailed through the air and smashed into the walls completely missing the targets but smashing on impact spilling milk over the already filthy floor.
The bantering continued over breakfast and Tony woke up a bit more with fuel in his system and called Jarvis to find out what was happening.
“And you are what, besides a drunken, drugged up moron?” Tony asked, “A decoy, a double…?”
“Hey, no debts between friends.” Tony said, he slapped Thor’s shoulder again, “C’mon big guy, let’s hit the road, you too Brucie-bear, least I can do is buy you dinner, after all, you’ve already got in my pants!” he wiggled his eyebrows at Bruce who sighed heavily at the inuendo which had Clint snorting in amusement.
Tony looked at him in surprise but Steve’s expression was impassive, “Jarvis kept me updated, you’ve been suffering nightmares with frequency since Sokovia, ones that make you sick or give you panic attacks.”
“We’re sure its Hydra who has the sceptre then?” Steve asked, “Not that I am doubting it, they are the mostly likely suspects, but is there any other outfit that would or could do this?”
He’d been lucky enough that Erskine had chosen him for the super soldier program, then his abilities had all come from the serum. Aside from that and a talent for art there was nothing special about him, he wasn’t overly smart, he could hardly work a mobile phone! What could he possibly offer someone like Tony Stark?
“Of course Sir.” Jarvis replied.
He was not going to be like Maria Stark. Subservient and cowed. Dependant and despondent. He would not let an Alpha walk all over him the way that Howard walked all over Maria, he would not lose all self-respect and dignity to the point where he just let it happen and buried his misery in bottles of pills, he would not allow anyone to treat him the way Howard treated his Mother, nor would he ever allow his Alpha to treat their children the way Howard treated him.
“Have you got a hollow leg now or something?” MJ asked, seeing the amount Peter was eating. “Did you get worms while you were in the hospital, or did that spider infect you with a parasite that’s devouring your intestinal bacteria?”
“Everything is going to be fine Tony. You’re going to get better.” Steve said, forcing himself to say it even if he didn’t fully believe it. “You are going to rest for a while and then you are going to come back to us, back to me and the boys because we need you baby, we need you and we love you.”
“Really?” Zach asked excitedly.
“Down the corridor, turn left, down the stairs and into the large room. Go to the wall on the left you will find an open tunnel and a set of stairs they will lead you down into the lab.”
“Unfortunate?” Norman laughed, “I would call this criminal assault.” He looked at Tony challengingly, “You are lucky I am not pursing criminal charges against your brat.”
“Oh don’t you go getting uppity with me, buster. You can save that sass for Barton, if you bug me I’m gonna turn you into a hot plate, then all you’ll be doing is warming pre-cooked food. You’ll have no free will or abilities to fry things, you’ll just sit there on a table with plates on top of your for the rest of your life.”
“Do we have a name for this little Prince?” Tony was asked sometime later, after being delivered of the afterbirth and cleaned up some. Time had become meaningless as he’d held his baby Son, nothing else mattered but him.
For a moment nothing happened, then the infant began to scream and convulse….
As he reached the end of the tunnel he pushed open the grill with his feet and stepped out into the night air in Nassau County. Taking off his lab coat with some difficulty he wrapped it about his wounded shoulder and began walking along the road, hoping that a car would come along and he could get a lift to the nearest hospital.
“Thanks bottle-Cap! I was starting to get a head rush from hanging around like that,” Deadpool said, dusting himself off, “And not the good kind of head rush either, you know?”
The team spent another night in Rose Hill, Tony insisted on taking everyone out for dinner for their last night and they all had fun trying to beat each other at pool while the kids kept score and booed or cheered depending on who was taking the shot.
“Yeah, like superheroes in comics have a normal guy backing them up, you know helping keep their cover and watch surveillance and shi…stuff, I can totally do that for you. But you need a mask and a name, a cool name. Like… Speter or Spiter!”
“I think, considering your injuries and the length of time you’ve been bed bound, punishment enough.” Tony said.
“On it Colonel.” Natasha confirmed, she and Clint headed back to the front gate to keep an eye on the road, there was only the one road into Leheigh, so any trouble would come in the direction.
It was from the Backster Building they saw Thanos’ army swam the earth, sweeping through the defences like a relentless tsunami.
Thor was already gone. He had fallen when Asgard had fallen, shortly before Thanos had come to earth.
“Hey!” Clint cried, “I’ll have you know that I am famous for my graffiti, I am master of the decorative walls and the backs of doors.”
“You are very welcome Ned.” Steve said with a smile, he was used to Ned’s hero worship by now although it was cute. He looked over his shoulder, “Everyone buckled up?”
Female Reboot Intelligence Directive Assistant Yeoman, (Friday)
Pepper issued a brief but concise statement that confirmed that Tony had been gravely injured during the Avengers raid on the Sokovian base, but that his condition was now serious but stable.
“Please. I could pick you up with one arm,” Steve said, sipping his coffee, “And I am not over grown, you are just pocket-sized!” Tony’s mouth dropped open in amused outrage,
“Right.” Tony agreed, “Maybe just talk a walk in the snow for a few minutes every day, let yourself get used to it, then slowly start to do more.”
“Button it.” Steve growled, “Damn that kid takes after Tony.”
“Damn, and here I thought you’d kiss me goodbye!”
“He can wear leather. That’ll look way cooler.”
Once again Tony took charge with an overly large smile on his face and loud greeting for the first socialite he came across, breaking the ice and getting some of the attention off the others so they had a chance to get their bearings before they were set upon.
“That sounds good.” Steve said, “And he’ll be mixing with kids his own age, he’ll probably make a few friends.”
Natasha held her ground impassively staring back at Tony, “They were trying to protect the rest of the world.”
“It won’t be easy.” Tony said to Steve, “You’ll have to be willing to compromise, show remorse for your actions and I can’t guarantee there won’t be jail time.”
He struck her with the power of the mind stone, knocking her away from Tony and freeing him from her hold.
“You aren’t imposing,” he said, looking back up to Steve, “I’ll be happy to have you both,”
Between the Hulk, Thor, and the fire department working together they managed to get the fire put out and made headway on shifting the debris where the epicentre of the explosion had occurred, as they went along charred remains of animals began to be pulled out of the wreckages, some completely unrecognizable and not just because of the burns but because of how weird they looked.
As it was their first team-up it could have gone better in regards to public relations and inter-team dynamics, the headlines that followed speculating over the relationship between Doom and Richards didn’t help much, and the one that read Iron Man: Matchmaker? With images of Reed Richards and Dr Doom next to it, had Pepper slapping Tony upside the head.
“Run!” Steve barked at the Omega, as he pulled the man out of the car and onto the bonnet only to get a metal elbow in the gut and his legs kicked out from under him, sending him down onto the bonnet. The man was on him in an instant, lifting him up and punching him repeatedly, the blows hit and hurt, this man was enhanced, he was as strong if not stronger than Steve, whom he hefted like a doll and threw him down onto the ground, jumping after him and kicked him in the back to send him sprawling again.
As guests they had access to the hotel gym, spa, and swimming pool, they were invited to dine at the restaurant and partake of the cocktail bar, with the price being added to the final bill.
Clint let out a laugh which got everyone’s attention; he held up the tablet showing them the photoshopped photo, which had Steve and Tony taking the places of a bride and groom before a church.
Rhodes in the war machine armour was blasted out of the air and sent skidding across the ground gauging a deep track into the ground as he went.
“Maybe.” Tony said, “I think or I hope there is something beyond death, what that is I don’t know. Personally I’m drawn to the idea of reincarnation, which can theoretically be proven by science.”
“A really long one.” Sam agreed holding his side where his broken ribs were still paining him.
The first thing Tony did was empty his bladder, then he unwrapped his throbbing wrist and peeled off the adhesive dressings to he could take a shower. Washing his hair with one hand was difficult but he managed it, however he had to ask Steve to re-wrap his arm and split it with the spoons.
“Fuck, Tony, you’re making me an Uncle!” Rhodey whispered staring in stunned amazement at the Billionaire.
The homophobia made James want to stay away from Bucky’s Steve even more. He liked Men himself, and Dames. Liked them both, but Bucky’s Steve didn’t like that, didn’t approve. Had he known it about Bucky? James couldn’t remember, he doubted it though and resolved to stay away.
“Certainly Captain.” Jarvis agreed, keeping his voice low so as not to hurt Peter.
“You did this, it is your fault.” The voice hissed in his ear, “You should have saved them, you should have done more.”
Zach, always Peter’s shadow, stuck to Peter’s side as he and Harley explored the new Workshop. It didn’t take long before the three of them were testing out the Mark II, denting food cans and mink cartons, the only thing Grace protested against was when they fired at the walls so they could see the potatoes explode.
“It does give us time to have another “Practice session” in the shower.” Steve said getting off the bed, “And like you said, we should practice as much as possible.”
With a tiny clutch bag on the crook of her arm and a tacky bright pink balloon wrapped about a pink enveloped gift card, Natasha tottered on her high heels, wobbling deliberately with a helpless look on her face.
“No, no he’s not dead, honey.” Happy assured Peter, “He’s…he’s in hiding, with Steve.”
The two shared a lingering kiss and looked back down at their daughters, tomorrow the team would arrive for the annual celebration on defeating Thanos, but for this evening it was just them and their family, enjoying the sunset and superhero games.
Zach nodded and burrowed down under his cover with his eyes screwed tightly shut as if he was willing himself to fall asleep as fast as possible. Tony kissed his head and wished him good night, turning off the light as he left the room, going back to the common room to wait for Zach to fall asleep before everyone got the Christmas gifts and put them under the tree for the following morning. Peter joined in; he was too old to believe in Santa so he could help out the adults getting ready for Christmas day.
“Mamma I think there’s some Enema things here!” Zach called as he peered into a rock pool, “They’re all wiggly like worms.”
“I know.” Steve said, he’d learned more about IVF and other fertility treatments during the past few years and didn’t blame Tony for not wanting to go through them. “If we can’t have a baby naturally then so be it, maybe we can look into adoption. Give another kid like Peter a home and a family.”
“Tony I’ve never said that.” Steve said,
“We were just trying….” MJ began in a whispery voice, her usual bravado lost as she faced her own parents wrath, Mr and Mrs Watson were just as furious as Mr and Mrs Leeds, having been told everything by Clint and Pepper after they had been called to the Tower to collect their respective children.
Peter jumped to his feet off his bed the moment Steve came into his bedroom and began to apologise. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean what I said, I don’t know why I said it, I couldn’t stop my mouth, it was like it had a life of it’s own, I didn’t mean it, I’m so sorry I really am!”
Norman smirked back at him, “If he is as traumatized as you say then he is indeed a danger to others.” He said to Tony, “Or at least that is an argument I can make,” He glanced at the Principal and school board, “And have my lawyers pursue,” The Principal’s eyes widened and the school board shifted uncomfortably, “Unless….”
Chained and cuffed they were escorted onto a jet with a catatonic Wanda. Doctors had been in to assess her condition and found her to have severe irreversible brain damage. She would not be going to prison, she wouldn’t even have a trial, she would spend the rest of her life in a hospice until her body gave out.
"Unless you are leaving this bed to get something to make tonight kinky, you have no where to go."
“If that were true,” Tony said, “Why update the hardware?” He shook his head, “Something isn’t right here, there’s something..” He yelped as the terminal gave off a static shock and he leaped back, banging into Steve and shaking out his hands.
“When can we go to the beach?” Zach asked bouncing on the bed with hyper-active excitement, “Wanna go play in the sea!”
Steve however did not continue to stretch him, in fact he removed his finger altogether and sat back on his knees. “Steve, c’mon!” Tony whined, reaching for him, but Steve held him off,
“I was really scared today.” He admitted.
“We should all rest too.” Natasha said, “There is nothing we can do until Friday has information for us, Tony is in the Doctors hands, the best thing we can do is try to rest and then regroup when we’ve had a few hours to recharge.”
With how clean and easy life seemed to be in the twenty-first century Steve almost came to believe that people didn’t get ill anymore and he was only reminded of the fact that they were still human and that illness still existed when Zach came down with Chicken Pox.
“Thanks MJ that means a lot.” Peter said trying very hard not to think about the feel of her body against his, he really didn’t need a boner right now!
Tony glanced up at Steve who felt a twist of dread in his stomach, They were late, very late for the meeting, Natasha and Fury should have called them, and if they had called Tony’s mobile then Jarvis would have been able to trace the call as he was linked with Tony’s phone.
“The Earth has an iron core, you are the Iron Man, why don’t you return to where you came from?”
“We had a den in one of the abandoned factories. There were homeless living rough there, but they didn’t care about two boys scrambling through the windows and building themselves a den in a corner made from wooden crates and newspaper.” Steve told Tony over hot chocolate and biscuits during the early hours of a morning after some especially unpleasant dreams.
“Ask if he wants to go.” Steve said getting to his feet and going to get his shorts and a T-Shirt and trainers. “We’ll take a run through central park, and maybe going and hit a fast food joint on the way back, bring Tony back a burger or something.”
Steve’s brow creased and he reached up to cup Tony’s face, wiping the tears away with his thumbs, “It isn’t your fault.” He said again, “Blame Stane, blame, the Ten Rings, blame Fury for not giving you Howard’s property sooner, blame Howard for not taking better care of you and being more cautious in his friends. Blame all of them, but do not blame yourself.” He smiled faintly, “I admit I would love to have a child with you, I would love to see you heavy with my baby, but if it is not to be, then it is not to be, and we are not childless, we have two beautiful sons, strong, intelligent, wonderful sons, and I love them with all my heart. As I do you.” He kissed Tony fiercely, “Even though we can’t have a baby together we will be happy and have a happy life.”
"Name and Date of birth?" she barked.
“No, no no!” Tony hissed, running after Zach.
“On my lead.” He said, “Go steady and watch your step.”
By 1992 betrothals were rare in Europe and America, but were still legally binding, so Tony had no choice even though Howard and Maria were dead, to agree and marry Obie.
“What, you to good to just use a phone and order now?” Rhodey called after him with laughter in his voice and Tony headed for the stairs, going back up into the main part of the house, nearly colliding with Happy who was handling a decidedly cranky Zach.
“That is what The Avengers are for!”
“Your coming here warned us, warned me. You gave us the chance to prepare and save ourselves.” He leaned into Steve’s chest, snuggling up to Lily, who was delighting in the fireworks exploding in the sky. “You and Lily are the best thing to ever happen to me Steven Rogers, don’t you ever think otherwise.”
“I don’t understand.” A woman in office clothing said, pushing tangled dusty hair behind her ear, “Why did Iron Man attack us?”
“Go back to bed Harry.” Osborn ordered him, “Marcus, stay here, keep an eye on him.” He ordered his head of security, a hulking lump of a man with a scar over his right eye and a missing front tooth.
“A stiffening in a body part.” Tony said.
Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes, “Because we are public figures, household names. In this era practically everything you say and do is political in one way or another and it is so easy to offend people without meaning to. Its why people like me have PR departments to handle most of my press releases, and I generally only have pre-planned interviews or press conferences with pre-arranged questions.” The exceptions to that had been after Afghanistan of course, but for the most part Tony was careful what he gave the press, only throwing them the meat he wanted them to eat rather than risking getting devoured by them.
“Well that’ll just give me better access to your Iron Manhood!”
“There is quite a range of different physicality’s between you all isn’t there?” The Host asked Steve, “Yourself and Thor set the bar unachievably high for the human and unenhanced members of the team. How can they hope to keep up with you?”
Steve blinked, “Really?” He knew that the team had an Avengers Facebook and Twitter accounts, Tony’s PR had set them up and did most of the work on them, with Tony, Clint, and Natasha only occasionally adding to them. He knew that Tony had his own accounts as well, and he suspected they others, possibly with the exception of Bruce since he wasn’t really into social media, also had their own. But he had never thought of having his own.
“You could have saved us.”
“Because while it had the memories it doesn’t have the brain.” Natasha said going over and joining Clint, she took one of the Skrull’s wrists and broke it with a sickening crack of bones, then continued to twist the joint back and forth.
“But they can’t just throw us in prison now.” Wanda said, “Stark, you can’t let them!”
“Good.” Strucker purred looking back to the sceptre, “The Avengers have claimed too many victories in America. They thinned our forces, hobbled and humbled us, but we are not yet on our knees, and with this gift from the Gods, we shall rise again stronger than before.”
*****
“Why would they keep him sedated?” Rhodey asked, “That doesn’t make any sense if they wanted to use him for his skills.”
MJ rolled her eyes and mutter something about Tony not reading snail mail.
“You’re worried.” Steve said quietly to Tony, as they shared the bathroom, getting themselves washed and ready for the day along with Lily.
“She would have still been working for Shield then, wouldn’t she?” Pepper asked, “She didn’t retire until, what was it 93?”
“Aww spoil sport!”
“Crap!” the boy cursed making Steve choke out a chuckle.
Tony and Steve took him to see Santa in a department store, Zach had a cuddle with Santa and had his picture taken while he was sitting on Santa’s lap, and was given a huge bag of candy that had Tony groaning because all that sugar meant he’d be dealing with a hyperactive child once Zach had gobbled all the candy; he was already attack the candy cane before they’d even left the store.
“I get that I do.” Peter said, “And I promise I won’t act like that again.”
Rogers held his gaze for a moment then looked away, apparently not keen to start a fist fight with his larger and stronger twin.
“Perish the thought Sir.” Jarvis’ unimpressed voice floated back,
“What are you thinking about?” Tony asked.
Steve’s fist met his agents face shattering his nose and front teeth, he then picked the man up and threw him across the room, body slamming him into the remaining agent who was calling for back up.
This is rather odd, writing to myself, and I’m sure it is very odd to you two, reading a letter that an older version of yourself wrote for you.
Steve didn’t even pause, “I’ll take the second option.”
Tony slowly regained his health. Within ten days of Vision taking away Wanda’s magic the nightmares and hallucinations stopped, save for the natural bad dreams that came up every now and again.
“Look at how your reacting, Stark.” Natasha said, with her usual icy demeaner, “You’re incapable of being mature or rational about anything. Besides,” She shrugged, “It was a very long time ago, and you were never close with your parents…” She was cut off as a repulser blast was shot at her, catching her left arm with a glancing blow as she moved out of the line of fire just in time to avoid getting her arm blown off.
“Like we don’t know you’re going to make out.” Peter snorted, taking the money and his little brother who he caught by the collar and tugged back before he ran off down the hall, making him walk by his side.
Groaning, he clasped a hand over his mouth and made to pull himself up the bed, hoping he’d have enough time to get into his chair and reach the bathroom before he lost control of his stomach.
Tony rounded the bed and took Steve’s hands into his as the soldier sat down on the bed, “So now you’re a Father of Two.”
“Now that’s my kind of three way!” Deadpool declared, “Talk about getting shafted!”
Both agents grimaced and nodded, “We’ll keep them under observation.” Natasha assured him.
“More than ten years.” Tony grumbled, “I’ll be old and wrinkly and saggy while he’s still young and hot.”
“You’ve always been a stone cold, manipulative bitch, so I can’t even pretend I’m surprised.”
In the end Clint flew home on the Quin jet with Sam and Natasha to get some of Nate’s clothes that he’d out grown, while Pepper, Laura, and May began making calls to get a cot, baby bath, nappies, and changing mat to hold them over until the stores opened up again.
“By irradiating half of the East-Coast.” Bruce drawled, “Some victory that would have been.”
“Hey, everything taken care of?” Clint asked, keeping his voice low, Sam and Matt were sprawled out on the sofa with Peter snuggled between them in an impossibly small ball, while Tony, Steve, and Lily were in the bedroom.
“Very good.” Friday said initiating the launch of twelve legionnaires into space ordering them to take up position around the planet to keep guard. Six of them she set about the tower and upon the roof to guard the tower from threats. The last six she sent with Jarvis as he took flight heading for Prague.
“Not a munchkin, you’re a hobbit.” Tony grinned at the familiar squabble and Peter managed a small smile but was still looking down at his feet, which were cased in filthy trainers. Tony really needed to get him new ones, but Peter adored his scuffed, ripped, and dirt covered ones, preferring them to getting some that were new. “It’s okay to be mad at me.” Tony said to him, “You are allowed to be mad.”
“We know exactly who you are, Mr Osborn.” The detective arresting him said, “You’re the owner of that freak factory which just blew up, and if the reports about what’s been pulled from the remains are to be believed, you are some kind of Doctor Frankenstein.”
“Do you have reason to think that?” Steve asked her, placing a hand on Tony’s tense shoulder. He knew his lover was blaming himself even thought it wasn’t his fault in the least.
“Can we please stop talking about dicks?” Peter asked. The conversation was too much like dinner at home. Zach was starting human development at school and was very out spoken about it over the dinner table.
Even now after weeks in hospital following a life changing injury, Tony looked better to Steve than he had throughout the whole of the nineties, his eyes were clear and bright, he was pale but there was enough colour in his cheeks to be healthy, it was just a lack of daylight that had robbed him of his usual tan, his face didn’t look hollow or drawn, or at least not as badly as he had looked in 95 when a photo had been taken of him stumbling out of a club at three am completely wasted and looking like he hadn’t slept in a month or eaten a decent meal in that time either. With his ribs visible and his pelvis jutting out Tony had looked like a famine victim rather than one of the richest men in America, but what really got Steve’s gall was the photo of Stane at Tony’s side looking so smug he wanted to punch the bastard until his skull shattered beneath his fist.
After hitting his head several times, Tony had Jarvis call Steve in to lift the bed up so he could get out without giving himself a concussion. Zach giggled as Steve lifted the bed, Peter was laughing too as Tony scrambled out, red faced and embarrassed.
“And now do you see why you should always have a designated babysitter when you go away no matter how old your children are?” Rhodey asked a grin on his face as Steve handed the phone back.
Steve wasn’t in the conference hall with him, he was waiting in the gallery with Lily, but Rhodey was with him, was in full uniform and had his back, something Tony was immensely grateful for right now.
“You are certainly your Mother’s Son.” The man said, lifting Zach up and slinging him over his shoulder like he was a sack of potatoes. “Just as much trouble, more than you are worth.”
“All fully stocked sir, there are also several tranquilizers, might I suggest that you take one?”
“What were you thinking?” Pepper asked, “You scared us half to death.” She threw her arms around him, pulling him into a hug.
“I could help,” Steve offered, “Although I’d like to head to Brooklyn and get my clothes. No offence Mr Hogan..”
“Supposing I agree to this.” Tony said, “Supposing I don’t stand in the courts way, I don’t contest the decision or appeal against Curien getting immunity or witness protection, might I be granted a favour?”
“Zach!” Tony said turning slightly away from Steve, Thor and Hulk, “Zach, baby, I’m so sorry, Pete, are you there, talk to me honey.”
“Lots of things you don’t know about me, Nat,” Tony replied, sounding amused, but Steve saw that the smile on his face was strained and did not reach his eyes. He was also keeping a good distance from Maximoff, who’s eyes tracked his every movement, like a predator watching its prey in preparation to strike.
“Christ no, the Boss is on his own for that.”
Curien frowned then doubled over as a blinding pain spread through his abdomen, “Wha…” He grunted, clutching his stomach which felt wet,
“Welcome ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary guests to a very special segment.” The host said, “Today we have with us a man who does not normally engage in press releases, or conferences. A man who is more known as his alter ego, America’s finest, the first Avenger, Captain America.” He paused and looked over to Steve who managed a smile and a small wave to the camera.
“It’s okay.” Steve said, with a smile to Robbie, “It’s always nice to meet a fellow Iron Man fan. You think he’s the best Avenger?”
“Facial analysis suggests that the Steven holding the Sceptre is at least ten years older than the present Captain.” Jarvis said.
Steve stared at Tony in shock and the Omega shrugged, “I was in the vacuum of space. The cold there is even lower than in the arctic,” He tried to smile but didn’t manage it, “I wasn’t conscious for long either, the lack of air had me unconscious in seconds and the suit protected me from the other dangers, although if I’d been out there any longer then I wouldn’t have lived. The suit without power couldn’t have protected me indefinitely, the cold, the lack of pressure, as well as the lack of air would have gotten me in a few minutes.” He drew in a deep breath and tapped the table top with his fingernails, a slow beat, “I keep dreaming of it. Every night, the vacuum killing me, the Chitauri killing me, falling back to earth and dying on impact.”
“And a lovely speed boat!” Trevor said as he awoke again, “The thing was, he needed someone. To take credit for some “Accidental explosions”
Speaking of which, Natasha and Thor were waiting at the airport, The Thunder God insisting on being the one to carry Tony onto the plane and get him strapped in.
Steve stared at Zola his hands curled into fists, his body trembling with anger, with the need to fight, to hit something, to be able to do something.
The detective had a point, if Norman was arrested then Tony’s lawsuit against him and Oscorp would be a guaranteed win and taking a good chunk of the man’s fortune be a step towards compensating Peter. It wouldn’t undo the physical, mental, or emotional trauma, but it would pay for therapy and add to Peter’s trust fund.
“Awesome.” Peter said which was repeated by Zach.
“I think it could be useful.” Pepper said, “It gives you the opportunity to show yourselves to the population in a way you want to be portrayed. Not just as mysterious figures of rumour and legend, or larger than life characters of myth and tales. But as normal people who get up and have breakfast, who binge watch stuff on Netflix, who have stupid arguments about whose turn it is to empty the dish washer, and yet you still come together to battle against super villains to protect the world.”
Steve was laughing as Tony pulled him over and he rested his weight on his elbows. "Hi."
“It’s just a fan club Sam,” Rogers said, “No matter what laws may have been bent to allow it, the only true coupling is between a man and a woman. God said so, nature says so. What these people do is wrong. Now I wouldn’t want to see them imprisoned for it, or put to death as they were centuries ago, but I will not agree with such repugnant and unnatural behaviours.”
Steve snickered and kissed his cheek, “You certainly do. But how about we have a little warning next time, okay?”
“He doesn’t.” Steve said, “He’s just shooting his mouth off. He’s thirteen, awash with hormones. They all say things they don’t mean at that age.”
"Bit me?" Peter asked sitting up enough to look down at his ankle and sure enough on the exposed skin between his trainers and jeans was a reddening bite shining with blood.
“Yes, Tony and I were married, and I will thank you not to cast judgement on that which you know nothing of. It is rather disrespectful if not rude.”
Zach was thrilled to be going back, he’d missed being with his friends and couldn’t wait to get back, waking up at five am and leaping onto Tony, startling him awake and refusing to let him sleep as he insisted they got up and got ready for his big day.
Doctor Banner was nice enough, nervous as hell and really not comfortable on the Helicarrier, Steve actually felt sorry about leaving him behind as he and Natasha jetted off to Germany, where he went head on with the Nordic God of Mischief and Tricks himself.
“The big guy is better than a battering ram any day, we’ll just throw him that door and he’ll bring down half the wall with it.”
It was sad at times not being able e to share any of this with a mate, Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy were great, but it wasn’t the same, he couldn’t have them spoon him as he’d seen Alpha’s in movies do with their Omega’s, have them rub cocoa butter into his growing bump, spend hours kissing and caressing it as the Pup moved.
“As always, Sir.” A British voice said making both Thor and Steve look at the Billionaire in surprise,
“And leave me with his corpse all over my desk I shouldn’t wonder.” Fury said as he came in with Hill following behind him. He looked at them both, “You are the only ones here?”
Most importantly, he could not afford to rush into anything for Lily’s sakes. What she needed was a stable home environment. That was what he had to focus on, not sexual desires. As intense as they maybe. Yes, it would be fabulous if something developed between himself and Tony, but if it did not then he would content himself with friendship and be the best friend he could possibly be.
Tony forced a smile and shook his head, “I’m just being an over protective parent.” He lied, avoiding looking into Rhodey’s eyes, instead he took the helmet of the War Machine armour and tossed it at the Colonel, “Why don’t you go and take this for a test run huh, pick up some pizza’s. We’ll make this a movie night.”
The Westboro Baptist Church had come out on Rogers side for his views on LGBTQA. But they were among a minority. Only a few random hate groups were on his side, the usual Neo-Nazi dickhead brigade that always sided against LGBTQA. It was kind of funny, in a perverse way, that Steve Rogers, the man who had punched fake Hitler in the face, was now being made a figure head by the Neo-Nazi’s.
Shortly after defeating Thanos, Steve and Tony married in a small private ceremony, attended only by their friends and family.
If it had been up to Tony the menu would have consisted of junk food in various forms which was why Pepper had ordered the menu options and ordered Steve not to give in to any of Tony’s bullshit no matter how whiny he got or how big his puppy eyes became.
“I have no idea what you are talking about. Human experimentation? Animal yes, and I know Animal Rights activists hate me for it, but I would never….”
“One moment Sir,” The Guard said and spoke quietly to the kids, “They say they are Ned Leeds and MJ Jones.”
Grace was an attractive woman at the start of her thirties. She was not as put together as Pepper was, but she had clearly tried to maintain her appearance while juggling being a single Mother and working all hours to keep a roof over their heads. She was a little too thin, showing that she had probably gone without meals more than once so her children could eat. Her hair needed a trim and the roots needed doing, but she had taken the time to wash it and put it up into a French twist. She’d also bothered to put on some make-up and paint her nails. Her clothes were old but clean and ironed, so despite the colour having faded they were still presentable and wearable.
“When will you be an Avenger?”
“We need a vacation.” Clint complained nursing his sprained ankle courtesy of Bulldozer who’d slammed into the perch he had been on and Sam hadn’t been able to get to him fast enough to stop him from hitting the ground.
Avengers Tower.
“Accidents that were not accidents.” Zola said,
“Excuse me!” Steve cried at the same time as Tony snorted.
Steve nodded but didn’t look convinced and he mentally planned to ask Rhodey anyway, official guardian or not, Steve was pretty sure Rhodey would take War Machine to him if he hurt a hair on Tony’s head.
Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU.
Steve growled low in his throat and looked two seconds away from filling Curien’s face in with his fist, Tony looked much the same but both of them restrained themselves.
“What the hell, Tony?” He cried, rolling away and springing back to his feet, taking up a fighting stance.
He thought briefly about calling in the Avengers, but decided against it. He’d tried to explain to them time and again about the threat Earth faced and no one listened, even now with this Steve’s presence they were deaf to his reasoning. He couldn’t afford to waste anymore time on them. If they did as Steve suggested and gathered other allies in preparation, then they could always bring the Avengers in when the need arose.
“Stupid middle age metabolism.” He grumbled, recalling a time when he’d been able to eat his body weight in treats without gaining an ounce, much as Peter did now, but it seemed that his age was starting to catch up with him.
Since Tony’s heat he had not slept in his own bed, he had only gone to his own floor to shower, changing his clothes, and to paint. The rest of the time was spent in the penthouse with Tony, Zach, and Peter, and the others.
Lethargy.
Question the American justice system or justice systems of any other countries.
“I’ll try very hard not to.” Tony agreed, narrowing his eyes as Rhodey helped himself to a pancake and began to share it with Zach.
“Well I didn’t know what everyone wanted to I did something for everyone.” Clint said shrugging his shoulders, he winked at Zach and Peter, “There’s some chocolate fudge brownies in the oven too, we can have them warm with ice cream and Nutella.”
“God, he never stops does he?” Tony groaned, shifting Lily who was staring at Deadpool apparently fascinated by his garish costume.
A broad smile lit up Thor’s face at last and he hugged Tony so tight that Tony feared his ribs might break, “Thank you friend Stark, we will be most honoured.” Thor said, “And I must recount to you of how my Lady Jane came to have the Reality Stone inside of her. You see, it began when she stuck her hand inside a rock, and the reality stone then stuck itself inside of her….!”
“Shut up.” Howard said to him, as he filled a needle and took hold of the baby’s left arm pinching the skin at the elbow to bring up the vein. The infant’s sobs grew louder at the pain but Howard ignored them, sinking the needle into the infant’s skin and emptying the syringe.
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, and his voice is soft. “You’re an idiot.”
Tony does laugh then, and it’s cold, empty.
There it is. There’s what he’s been expecting since he walked in.
Steve’s gaze is steady, but something almost sad flickers in his eyes.
Italian translations:
Steve eases out of the bed, grabbing his hand and kissing it, and completely avoiding the question.
Their shirts go first, and there’s a second where Tony is grateful for the dim lighting because then Steve won’t see his arm. He shoves those thoughts out of the way. Another time.
“Why? Do you like the attention sweetheart?”
“You’re a little scary when you want to be, you know that right?”
Tony narrows his eyes, placing his glass of water on the spotless island, assessing Steve, lips curling into a smile that not many people see. It’s small, quiet. Real.
Tony smiles, and it’s a little sad. “I have everything I need. You’re not a part of that.”
“That’s true.” He mutters, smile tugging at his lips. “That’s very true.”
He realises Steve is speaking.
He really needs another drink.
his fault.
had anything he wanted, a life that Steve can’t even begin to imagine.
I’m so sorry.”
Somehow, he just keeps going.
His boyfriend turns to him, and there’s a nervous look on his face that tugs at Steve’s memory. He realises where he’s seen it before. It’s the same look Tony had been wearing right before Obadiah had knocked to deliver the news of his parents and interrupted what Tony had been about to say. Nervous. Hopeful.
Tony’s expression softens slightly, looking back to the teenager in front of him.
Rhodey comes over, takes one look at him, and Tony knows Steve probably won’t live through their next encounter. Rhodey is angry, he’s so angry. Tony gets a flash of vicious satisfaction at the thought of Steve having this level of rage directed at him, but then remembers how much everything hurts, and how Steve made the numb feeling fade, even for a little while.
Tony slides his arm around his waist, and Steve laughs at the look of annoyance on Nat’s face.
“And you’re patronising.”
Safe. This is what safe feels like. Maybe this is what
Steve just looks at him for a long long moment, and Tony tells himself not to focus on how blue his eyes are.
He goes back to his apartment before lunch, but skips food and goes into the room he uses as a lab, changing out of his suit and into jeans and a battered ACDC t-shirt that he hasn’t worn since college.
“You leave him the
He blushes, because only he would manage to embarrass himself by coming out with something so

“Was it good?”
Tony raises his eyebrows and Steve gives him a faint smile before walking out. The door clicks shut quietly behind him as he leaves, and Tony is left wondering if the conversation was really wholly real at all.

Steve nods slowly, ignoring the fact that he’s holding his phone way too tightly.
Tony smirks, and Steve can
Steve opens his mouth, but Natasha gets there first, and he loves her, but she’s never been particularly tactful.
Pepper nods, going over to a counter and pouring herself a glass of whiskey that probably cost more than what Steve earns in a year. “Yeah. It’s not pretty. But obviously, it’s better if you have all the facts before making a case against him.” Her voice trembles a little as she speaks, and Steve realises she’s not as unaffected as she’s pretending to be.
Somehow, by some miracle, he manages to get Tony out of the hotel and into the car, pulling him into the backseat.
They’ve gotten… closer. So much closer. If Tony was honest with himself, which he never is, not with this, he’s pretty sure that he would opt to spend every second of the day with Steve.
“Okay.” Steve whispers, shifting backwards slightly. “Okay. Whatever you need.”
Tony snaps out of the slight daze of
She nods, and leaves with their order. Tony turns back to him with a slightly apologetic grin. “Sorry about that.”
Tony pulls away and smiles a little. “I love you too. Don’t freak.”
Steve comes back almost a year later, and Tony isn’t ready, but he doesn't think he'll ever be ready for Steve Rogers. Seeing him feels like he's been punched in the stomach, but he feels… awake.
But Steve isn’t Maria, and he’s figured it out.
He knows she’s joking, but he still feels a flicker of defensiveness.
“You’re sweet.”
“I love you,” Tony says quietly, because he has been afraid of saying it for so long, and now he can say it without any of the fear, or less of it at least, so he's just making up for lost time.
The words won’t come, he can’t say it.
(See the end of the chapter for
call Happy. But there’s a part of him that just wants to go alone, and the thought of talking to anyone other than Steve right now seems insane.
“I know. But…” A shrug. “Humour me. Take care of yourself Tony, okay?”
“Are you breaking up with me?” He blurts out, instantly regretting it because
, I had sex. With Tony. I had sex with Tony Stark.”
It always has with Steve.
How he knows, or at least suspects, is beyond Tony. Maybe the bartender, maybe the waitress, maybe someone else.
He frowns slightly, glancing back towards the door. He likes Tony, more than he’s willing to admit to Nat right now, more than he’s even willing to admit to himself. He’s only seen a limited amount of him online, but having the same smile he flashes for cameras turned on him is… disarming, despite only having two conversations with him.
It’s only once they reach the car that Tony realises he never paid for the drinks.
(He wants to keep him out of it, that's all he’s ever wanted to do.)
That’s the only goddamn thought in his head. He needs to talk to Rhodey, or see Rhodey, or just get
“You waited and decided to open the entire cafe late, just so that you could be the only ones in here to tease me about my sex life.”
Pepper rolls her eyes, flipping open the folder and pulling a USB out of her pocket. “It wasn’t hard. But I figured that it would be useful. This is it.” Any lingering humour that had been on her face before has vanished. “It’s not… I’m sorry. You’re really not going to like it.”
“It’s
Tony laughs, but there’s no humour in it. The teen is incredibly intelligent, he’s not surprised he’s managed to figure Tony out, despite only knowing him properly for a couple of weeks.
A call from Pepper.
“But,” She continues, “I think-” she swallows hard. “I think it has gone that far. Before. From what he was saying…”
Nat just raises her eyebrows, but Steve doesn’t miss the hurt flickering in her eyes. He moved between them, turning to face Tony.
put the hurt there. Too late to back out now, and he needs to sell it, needs Obie to buy it.
He sighs, resting his head against the wall and loosening his death grip on the phone.
(See the end of the chapter for
They pull up outside the SI tower, and Tony feels like a block of ice has lodged itself in his stomach.
Steve immediately moves his hands away, but Tony grabs his wrist in a loose grip before he can get far.
“You would keep it even if I said no.”
Steve is looking at his face, at the bruise that is still fading. He reaches out to touch it, but then stops, pulling his hand away again.
“I’m Steve.” He says with a half smile, holding out his hand to shake. “Steve Rogers.”
Hands on his waist now, sliding under his shirt. Dizzy. His head hurts. Lips pressing against his, moving down to his neck, and it’s too bright, too much. He thinks he flinches away, he doesn’t know. The hands hold fast, pinning him in place.
When his heart rate has slowed slightly and he feels a little more human, he takes a deep breath, meeting Steve’s eyes. They’re so blue, so bright. But they’re worried, he can see that much. Not pitying, because he thinks if Steve has looked at him with pity he would have broken.
Steve huffs a laugh instead, kissing him. “You don’t say.”
“Si, mamma, sto bene, non importa.” [9]
He thinks he says something, or makes a noise, or anything.
He’s never been good at being brave, or selfless.
of the apartment. Tony swallows, takes a breath in. Steve sees his hands before he tucks them into his pockets. They’re shaking badly.
“Yes. If you’d like that?”
“Shit, sorry, long day. Did you need something?”
Sam laughs, going into the break room to sort out what they need for opening time.
“Don’t believe everything you hear on wikipedia.” Tony says with a laugh, poking Peter gently in the arm. “Besides, the Captain isn’t a-”
, that Steve feels himself grinning back. Soft jazz starts to filter in through the speakers in the room. It’s
"Have they cast anyone else?" asked Steve. If he was hand-picked it meant Carol had a pretty good idea of the direction she wanted to go with. The rest of the cast could already be on board.
“Steve, you’re here!” Carol’s voice called from behind.
"Is not like you're gonna have a girl up here," mumbled Bucky with his mouth full. Steve glared at him.
Killian looked at Janet and gave her a small nod. Then he looked at Tony. Stabbing his eyes at him.
Twenty heads turned around to see how Tony Stark entered the room. Steve felt immediately starstruck again. Sure, he might think the guy was an unprofessional asshole, but this was Tony Stark. He was one of the best actors of his generation. And he was walking towards him. The legend in the flesh.
Steve felt himself slip into easy conversation after the first cup of coffee. Natasha was a really warm, welcoming person. She laughed at his jokes and nodded with his stories. Clint Barton, the guy who played Natasha's brother, was simply hilarious. Steve couldn't remember the last time he laughed so hard.
They were going to shoot for about 9-11 weeks on Scotland. It was a good enough Roman look alike with the best accessibility. Tony would fly in on the summer and start filming right away. There was already a script so Carol told him a little about the plot. It was about a community set in Pompeii the day the volcano erupted. She didn't want flashy effects or big scenes of chaos, she wanted to explore the human condition in that situation of crisis. Tony would be the one of the three protagonists, a man who lost his family before the movie took place.
Steve nodded, pleased. Nat was a graceful actress, always finding herself in different roles. She had an eye for good movie scripts and had starred in Sunset. Steve had a really good feeling about this film.
“To the café around the corner. Carol wants us to get along," he said, nodding towards Stark, "to play nice, you know?"
Then, inevitably, he watched Countdown. Tony Stark’s masterpiece. The movie that marked him as a legend all those years ago. It was as raw and emotional as Steve remembered it. Stark had an ability to act with his whole body, putting grace and charm into every motion. But what knocked it out of the park were his eyes. Those huge, round eyes had mastered every microexpression to form a truly breathtaking performance. Countdown had been a showstopper when it first came out. A tale about a man dealing with addiction in the late 70’s. It had
Miss Potts then called them all to their places. The cast wasn't so big, maybe around 15 or 20 people. They sat down on their correspondent chairs. The one beside Steve was empty and read with big black letters “Tony Stark”.
"Well you're not very friendly either."
"If Paramount won't be able to meet my needs then i'm sure i'll find another studio that will" she finished harshly.
“Tony! Let me in. I have something big to tell you,” tiny Jan said, her enthusiasm palpable even though the mechanic filter.
Tony shifted, uncomfortable. Killian was looking at him again. Staring. He was told not to respond to any provocation, so he stayed quiet.
"I feel like we got along just fine," Stark shrugged, putting his hands on his pockets.
"She is, but she wants to make this big period piece so she needs the money," she said, nursing her cup and not quite drinking it. "Which is why she partnered up with Paramount.”
"I know just the guy."
“I am a lovable asshole and I can act. Isn't that enough?” he answered simply, trying to make a joke. Being called out made him uncomfortable.
“I see you’ve met Natasha. My big star.”
“Tony. We’re serious. We’re willing to put our necks on the line for you. We need you to, at least today, act like a human adult,” said Pepper, staring him down.
“No, no. I like to read it for the first time here. It seems more genuine that way.”
Steve crossed his arms. He needed this. He needed a good, serious movie to prove his worth. He was tired of being type casted into bad roles. He was more than a beefy action star. But if Tony Stark ruined the shoot he would lose his chance.
But there was one person that increasingly made him uncomfortable. Stark spoke only to Natasha and Rhodes and glared at Steve everytime he tried to stir the conversation his way.
"Oh I'm sure it has promise," said Killian, interrupting her. Pepper frowned a bit, but didn't respond. "In fact, I think it will be a great success. That's why we got involved. That's why he can't touch it."
But lately they haven't had much luck. After Tony’s 7th drunken scandal 5 years ago, no self respecting director wanted him near them. He could only get small cameos and guest star appearances. It was driving him mad. Granted, with all the money he made in his twenties he could live out his life without working a single day more. But Tony loved acting, loved keeping his mind busy. Not working meant not acting and that lead to hours of boredom and in most cases, alcohol.
"No, I'm just -"
He was sitting on the small kitchen table of his LA flat. Having already eaten his customary eggs and toast, he felt like he could indulge a little. Steve didn't spend the money he earned with Captain America in buying a luxurious house with more rooms than necessary. He didn't dress in a thousand dollar suit. So he could allow himself to be a little frivolous in other ways.
Carol smiled and Pepper nodded, pleased with the answer. They continued to talk about the movie. The best thing about Carol was the energy she had. She was a really young director, but with only 27 years she had already made 2 critically acclaimed movies. One of them even won an Oscar. It was transparent that her whole heart was being put on this project and Tony couldn't be happier about it. He loved working with people with vision, not just money grabbers.
"And who may that be?" said Killian with a laugh. Carol's eyes lit up.
Carol laughed at him. She wasn’t so used to his relaxed persona as Pepper and Jan were. Tony liked her. He could keep the asshole attitude in check by now.
Bucky entered the kitchen a moment later with Sam at his heels. They had big grins on their faces.
Killian looked at her for about two seconds. Then, as if she didn't exist, he spoke to Carol. "We can call in anyone you want. Lang would be very interested in the role."
Shit. He was sure it was saturday. It sure felt like saturday.
That’s why her partnership with Stark was so strange. In Stark’s good years, they’ve made at least four films together. Which seemed illogical. Stark was known for being late on set, drinking within takes and picking fights with the crew. The man was chaotic. Why did Miss Potts agree to work with him so many times?
Tony was a good actor. Scratch that, he was a great actor. He could pretend to be smitten by this arrogant guy with his condescending demeanor.
"Okay I'll bite. What is it?" asked Tony, stretching himself on the couch. God, it was too early. Or he was just too hungover.
Natasha asked for a table and they settled in a corner booth. Just the main cast had gotten out and Steve was glad for it. Carol and Pepper were great, but they were their bosses. He wanted to get to know his coworkers without that pressure.
The only problem was the studio. The agent was supposed to arrive in a few minutes. Tony felt nervous about it. He knew deep inside that for this to work, he had to essentially be sell himself as someone else.
Steve wasn't a arrogant man. He was simple. He lived in the same house as always, drove the same car as always and ate pretty much the same meals. But he took pride in his work. At least, in the good parts of his work.
“Yeah, no skipping the gym for this one,” said Nat, shaking her head with a smile. “I take it that you haven’t read the script yet?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, that would've been useful a few years ago," he joked, making the tension disappear. Everyone laughed but Stark, who looked like he rather be swallowing acid than being im Steve's presence.
A compromise. That was a sign of victory. For the first time since he set foot on the dinner, Tony allowed himself to relax. Maybe things would work out.
"And where does it lay?" he quietly asked. "With a drunk has-been?"
They finished up their coffees half an hour later and Steve didn't try to make conversation with Stark again.
"So, Stark. You've been around the longest. Any advice for the new guy?" Steve asked him, offering a kind smile.
He stood up, following the rest. He went to chat with James Rhodes who he was excited to meet. While he introduced himself, he saw how Stark made a straight line to the door. Before he could make it, Natasha stopped him. Steve didn't wanted to eavesdrop, but he couldn't help hearing their hushed voices.
"Okay okay..." said Bucky, putting down the fork and composing himself. "First you have to say we are the best managers slash lawyers slash agents slash friends in the world."
“Yes I have, she’s a delight.” said Steve, smiling at her.
"I am the world's best agent," said Jan, opening the door with a bang. Tony settled down in his comfy oversized couch and just muttered a weak "Hi Jan."
Sorry for the  delay! I'm really grateful for everyone following this story. What your comments and kudos mean to me is really indescribable, thank you so much!!!
Carol laughed and patted his shoulder.
“Who?”
They were waiting for Carol and Pepper at a fancy dinner. The typical LA place with the fashionable designed chairs and round white tables. There were plants and modern art everywhere. Tony was glad he was rich, because there was no way someone normal could afford even a cup of tea here.
The table became quiet. Tony knew Carol was a fierce director and he suspected she would have asked for full control. But seeing her act so fierce in person made him shiver. He felt humbled. These talented, professional women were risking everything just to work with him. Tony hadn't felt special in years. He was starting to now.
"Well, our characters need to get along better than just fine,” insisted Steve.
Steve turned around immediately. There she stood, bright as the day. Natasha Romanoff. It was a weird moment for Steve, having seen her a couple of hours ago crying over her dead mother. Now she was there, in front of him, wearing a gray hoodie. It seemed almost comical, the way she dressed so comfortably. She was one of the hottest stars in Hollywood right now, yet there she was. Standing in front of Steve. Wearing crocs.
"Yeah dude! She said you would be perfect for the role. She hand-picked you man!"
“I will,” he said, trying his best to sound earnest. “I promise. No alcohol, no dicking around, no pissing of studio representatives. I’ll be on my A game. You can count on me.”
"Well no, but I met people who did."
Nat humed, nodding. She was looking at him intensely. For a moment, Steve thought she might be studying him.
Killian made a long, dramatic sigh. He then watched every woman individually, calculating his next move.
Warning for sexual themes and explicit language. That said and hoping to break the formality, I hope you like it!
"Yeah? Who?"
"Please tell me you're kidding," he plead, turning around to face Sam.
"Some sort of Roman drama. You know that Pompeii thing? It's set around that," explained Bucky, stretching himself.
"Is that what I'm supposed to be? A bully?"
“Okay,” he simply said.
Pepper Potts received him as soon as he opened the door. She was a tall, beautiful women with a strong pose. Ever since he got into the industry he heard a lot about Potts. She was the kind of boss you would dream of having, but never dared disappointing. She took no bullshit.
He hadn’t been able to sleep the night before. He fumbled around in bed, trying every position imaginable to get himself to relax. But nothing worked. So, ever the fanboy, he pulled out his laptop and started watching his co-stars' films. Sunset was a simple yet powerful movie about a small town girl dealing with loss. Nat had really nailed the emotional bits in that one. Steve remembered seeing it a few months before, but now that he knew the same person was going to direct him he shivered. Carol was very talented.
Tony's head still hurt. He ached for a glass of wine more than anything. But that was the exact opposite of what he needed right now.
Nat would be also be involved. She would be another one of the protagonists, Tony's character's best friend.
Los Angeles in the afternoon was a busy place. The chilly air swifted through Steve's collar making him wish he had a scarf. They walked about three blocks until the found a small coffee shop with a somewhat guaranteed privacy. Well, as guaranteed as privacy could be in LA.
"No way," whispered Steve, eyes round like plates.
“Tony...” she whispered, getting closer to him. Steve couldn't see her expression from this angle and didn't manage to understand much else of what followed.
What was his problem? Steve hadn't been anything but nice to him. He could look past the cold stares and the general disinterest, but they had to work together. To have some sort of bond. Their characters were supposed to be best friends! How could he portray that if the man didn't talk to him?
Pepper was undoubtedly one of the best producers Tony has ever worked with. Hell, she was probably on of the best producers ever. She was professional, hardworking and took no shit from anyone. The set was always impeccable and she made sure everyone was on their top game. They had started on a rough patch way back in 04’, with Tony’s first blockbuster movie Countdown. But after a few beers and a mutual understanding, they started working like a clock machine. They also started sleeping together. She got him in check and even managed to keep him sober most of the production. Tony’s best works had been with her. They were a great team, made six movies together. But after Tony fell out of Hollywood’s approval they had a big fight that ended their partnership, professional and otherwise. They were on good terms now, but things were different. She was on the cusp of her career, landing better and better jobs. He was thoroughly unemployed.
"No, she's really in it. I bumped into her at the coffee shop. You know the one right by Boulevard 3rd? Well she said she was very happy about it and looking for a high profile actor to play one of the leads. And I said your name!" she was practically yelling at this point, eyes huge with excitement.
"Mr Killian. I know exactly what Paramount Pictures is concerned about. Money," she said firmly. "Tony Stark's comeback after five years is a story you ought to sell. We can do press releases about how he got his act together. We can giggle about the similarities with the character he plays. We can turn around his image to fit whatever marketing strategy you might see fit."
After a brief introduction between the members of the cast and crew, they got to the script. Steve got into a good mindset fairly quick. He may be bad at networking and getting the good jobs, but this he knew how to do. He knew how to act. So as the words flowed in the air, he felt himself relax. Felix, the character he played, was a straightforward guy. As the scenes progressed, he got to have a good reading on the man. His likes, his story. How Steve would portray him. This part of the process was crucial to him. The first time he met the man he would incarnate was a pivotal moment for his performance.
"Well she's doing a big job now. I'm talking huge numbers," said Jan, returning finally with two cups of coffee. She placed one in Tony's hands, which he was grateful for. Then, she layed back on the opposite end of the couch.
"So, you're familiar with Carol Danvers' work, right?" she asked, appearing again at the living's door frame."I think you've met her, in fact."
“Pepper Potts!” she exclaimed, bearly containing her smile.
“Miss Romanoff. It’s truly an honor to meet you,” said Steve trying to compose himself. He was used to dealing with famous people. He was one of them. But it never grew old, meeting new ones. The feeling of pure giddiness never disappeared.
"The volcano?"
Stark stopped on his tracks and visibly sighed. Then, he nodded at Natasha to go on without him and turned around.
Tony swallowed, hard. He was dangerously close to spitting on the guys face. He knew Hollywood had little to no respect for him nowadays. But this straightforward attack was too much. Sure, he might have a problem. The sour taste of wine at the back of his throat was insistently suggesting that. But he had kept to himself all this years without any scandal. When would they let it go?
"No, I just don't like bullies," answered Steve firmly, holding his stance.
Killian took a moment to compose himself and then smiled again. Only this time he looked defeated.
“You’re kidding me!”
They called Carol a few hours later. She responded on the first ring. Steve was excited about the project but after talking to her he felt exuberant. This was it. His jump from crappy movies to real pieces of art. Carol was a young woman with a strong vision. And she believed in Steve. She told him she saw Captain America and that her favorite scene wasn't the incredible jump from a building on fire everyone praised him for. It was the quiet moment after the big battle, where Steve showed who Cap really was. His desires, his dreams. And Carol understood that.
Jan took out her coat and threw it at the table amongst her bag. Then, as if she owned the place, went straight the the kitchen.
"We hire someone likeable, charming, a poster boy for good behavior. Someone with class but without arrogance," continued Pepper. "A guy that no one can ever find dirt on."
So Steve settled for doing the mature thing. Trying to mend whatever was that put them at odds.
Most of the time, he was aware of the dream. He could control everything. Make his feet run a thousand miles per hour or just stretch his arms and fly. That’s why the hard, angry sound felt so out of place. Tony tried to wish it away, but it just got stronger, ripping through the fabric of his reality.
“Is he not coming?” he whispered to Natasha, who was sitting in front of him. She opened her mouth to respond, but the sound of the door stop her.
"You are puffy. Your cheekbones are round and puffy" said Bucky, pointing at Sam's face.
"Please, call me Aldrich. The pleasure is all mine," he said, flashing a big, fake, smile. Tony instantly decided he hated the guy.
“Well, every actor has his methods,” she answered simply. “Creatures of habit, you lot.”
The more Carol spoke about it, the more he wanted to work with her. His character would have to go through some rough times and it was up to Tony how could he interpret that. He was a very ad lib performer, he felt more comfortable when he could bend some of the lines. Scripts felt too constricted, too narrow. Tony loved to get into character and really get into the man's head. He had had a lot of problems in the past for this, a lot of proud directors telling him to cut the shit and say the lines, almost like an automaton. Carol liked to see what her actors had to offer. Tony felt this partnership could really work.
Stark turned his head to look at him. Or at least, Steve thought he was looking at him. He couldn't see his eyes behind the sunglasses. Then, Stark looked ahead and sighed.
Thank you all for your kind comments, it made me incredibly happy you guys. I'll be posting again next Saturday!! Really excited for you to see what comes next
"Don't make crappy action movies." he deadpanned.
"Ladies, there's no need to get emotional. Ms Danvers, we knew you were something special. A feisty little woman," he said with a stone cold voice. "Perhaps we can come to a compromise."
"Puffy?" laughed Sam. "Is that what they teach you at drama school? Is that the result of your vocabulary training?"
"What did she say?" he asked, trying to keep his tone in check. Pepper wouldn't let their past relationship damage the movie. The question was if she thought Tony would damage it or not.
"Lighten up Stevie, what's your problem? You're gonna be working alongside an Oscar nominee. That's way above your usual standards..." said Bucky, hopping on the kitchen counter.
The representative arrived at exactly six p.m., two hours after Tony met with Pepper and Carol. He was a tall (so tall) handsome man around Tony's age. Dressed in a smart, black suit. The whole image yelled expensive.
"Then what is it? You're nervous about not being the only guy with lines on the film?" he interrupted again, looking away.
"Are you doubting my ability to act?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Carol! Hi, darling" he greeted her, standing up when the two women arrived. Carol was dressed lovely but simple as always, with clear jeans and a long dress shirt. He gave her a soft peck on the cheek and turned to Pepper, who was rocking a soft pink suit that made her eyes pop. “Pep my love, always a pleasure.”
The other man was distant throughout the whole read. He looked at the ceiling whenever Steve read and seemed bored if he took too long. His lines were said beautifully, but as soon as he closed his mouth he shut off. He would fall back on his seat and wait without paying attention to anyone else.
Tony had had it. Opened his mouth to say whatever insult his mind could conjure but Carol rapidly spoke over him.
"Well, tell me more about this movie then. What is it about?" said Steve, getting up to clean the dishes. He couldn't be sitting anymore, he was too anxious to keep still.
Tony Stark losing his head, slowly, on camera. It was sad yet with a few flickers of hope. Steve though it was an honest movie. Without the in your face morals of today's flicks.
Tony loved dreaming. He just drifted through the air, weightless. Flying. No pain, no suffering. No alcohol or drugs to numb his head. He wasn't the child prodigy or the Oscar nominee. He wasn't a disastrous young actor with too much money and too much attention. No, when he dreamed he was free. Happy.
"Tony fucking Stark," said Sam, proud of himself.
Jan hummed and went back to the kitchen. Carol Danvers was a young director, but she had a lot of promise. Her movies were inspired and creative, always bringing something new to the picture. Natasha had introduced them after the premier of their latest movie, Sunsent, a small but delightful film they did together. Tony wasn't too drunk at the party and he ended up having a great time with Carol. She was smart and witty, they played really well off each other. She respected him but didn't allow him to walk all over her. He liked her.
Steve turned around to greet his director. Carol wrapped him in a tight hug and gave him a quick peck in the cheek. She seemed happy. Having all her actors in one place was crucial to test the chemistry. With all the people chatting and getting along, she must've felt right.
She introduced Steve to the executive producer, Happy Hogan, and a few of the cast members. He recognized some from Carol’s early movies. They seemed to get along quite well, Carol must’ve kept them close for that reason.
“No way.” said Tony, genuinely surprised. Carol was a simple artist, she focused on the characters and the plot rather than the big flashy effects. “What is it about?”
Steve almost broke the plate he was washing. Tony Stark? The Tony Stark? He haven't heard about Stark since the 2014 scandal. He had been the most promising actor of their generation but threw it all away for booze and fame. Steve never liked the guy. Sure, he grew up watching his movies. He cried with Countdown and A father's tale. But he also saw the news, read the articles. Stark was unpredictable, unstable. He wasn't a reliable work partner.
“Look, I’m not gonna lie. We all know what your reputation is. I’m not afraid to work with you but these guys aren’t loving the idea,” she said, parting in half a biscuit. “So we need to show them that you’re a lovable asshole that can act professional.”
"I'm listening." said Killian, taking out his phone to presumably inform his boss of the development.
(See the end of the chapter for
"More like sidekicks" responded Stark with a grin.
“We’re going to grab a cup of coffee with the guys. It’s good for the morale,” she said patting his arm.
Stark took out his glasses and finally looked at him. Steve suddenly felt overwhelmed by his deep stare.
"Miss Danvers, I know you mean well. Stark is a hot, charismatic guy, so he seems like a good choice. But you're new to this industry. You don't know what is like to work with overpaid stars with alcoholic tendencies," deadpanned Killian, looking straight into Carol's eyes.
"Close enough. Carol Danvers called," said Bucky, trying to contain his smile.
"If the studio's concern is about the movie's targeting, we can come with a solution," said Pepper, probably having already thought about this scenario. "Mr Stark has a… strong reputation. We need someone to work alongside him who can counteract that reputation. There's still one of the main characters that hasn't been cast."
“I only receive news on tuesdays I'm sorry.”
Tony put down his cup. This was a big opportunity for him. A lead role in a big Paramount movie was exactly what he was aching for. But he learned not to get his hopes up any more.
Killian opened his mouth to speak, but Carol beat him to it.
"Well what did you said?" asked Steve.
“Tony does the same thing,” she said after a moment. Steve raised his eyebrows, surprised. It was the first time someone mentioned Tony Stark. And it had been to compare him to Steve.
“It is tuesday you moron. Let me in!!”
If she was producing Carol's movie, then it meant business.
He woke up alarmed, all at once. The apartment buzzer was ringing without pause. He groaned and tried to ignore it. His head was killing him.
Carol and Jan exchanged a brief, cordial salute and they all sat down.
“There will be enough bonding exercises in Europe, can’t I get of the hook just this once?”
"She liked the idea so much she called Carol an hour later. She's on board, she thinks you're perfect for the job."
"Stevie!" a voice yelled. Bucky's voice to be more specific.
"Those motherfucking assholes love to be a pain in my ass. Shit!" he sweared, setting the cup on a table with a plum.
"Yeah, the volcano."
Steve closed the app and hurriedly hid his phone inside his pocket.
“Some sort of retelling of a Roman tragedy. I'm not sure yet, but they’re gonna shoot it in Europe. And guess who’s producing it?”
Stark's eyes widened. He put his sunglasses back on and formed a tight line with his lips. Without saying a word, he turned around and left.
"Ha ha. No. I was just finishing breakfast. There's some eggs in… of course you already noticed."
"What? We can't barge in unannounced? We're your best friends." said Sam, taking a hand to his chest pretending to be offended.
"Yeah!" said Jan, but her smile fell a moment later. She adjusted her posture. "The only problem is the studio."
"You're very sensitive aren't you?" Stark mocked him, smile growing wilder.
Steve was confused by the answer. But before he could say anything, Carol begun the opening speech.
"What is it, Captain?" he asked, mocking Steve's most famous work.
“Well you know what they say. Talent keeps you young,” he answered, winking at her, “though I’m sure you already know.”
“Where?” he said. Rhodes laughed and looked away from Steve.
Show time.
"Don't worry baby, you think I would come here empty-handed? I've got a plan!" she said, getting up. "In fact, it's set into motion now. Get dressed, we're going out."
He buzzed her in, defeated. Dragging his feet through the wooded floor he went to the living room. On the way over he grabbed a robe that was laying on top of one of his chairs and put it on. Boxer briefs weren't exactly hosting clothes.
