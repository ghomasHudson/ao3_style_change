Steven doesn’t answer but he cocks his brow as if in challenge.
“You will not come,” Tony says. “From now, until you die, you will not come except at my command.”
“Seriously, we’re going down that path? Come on tell me so I know if I should send medical.”
“Because he has such a good grip on his thought processes, we routinely don’t have a problem,” Bruce said. “But it does happen. If I get too involved in some project and don’t do the daily meditation my thoughts start feeding back to me, like an echo.” Bruce sighed. “It’s a reflection. Your thoughts colliding with others in the pack. Like ripples in a pond. You throw one stone, you get one ripple. You throw a bunch the ripples interact, some additive, some subtractive. It messes with your head.”
The omega simply shakes his head and closes his eyes. He jerks into Tony’s hand. For a second, Tony doesn’t act, doesn’t react. But then the omega thrusts hard into his hand and moans a little. With that, Tony works him, knowing full well that a sub-omega will lose a sense of self in the grip of a needy yearning. Yet, Tony’s grateful for it, for the omega sinking into his primal nature and allowing it to hold him. It’s all Tony can really hope for now. They are strangers after all. An emotional bond is something outside the limits of their encounter.
“God,” Tony whispered and closed his eyes. “So more than 35 years.”
The cigarette hangs precariously from the ridge of his lips as he speaks. Steve is mesmerized.
“Inside?” Steve doesn’t know what he means. Is it inside the device in his chest? Inside the battery? Inside the saddlebag? He’s getting desperate and frightened. The world spins around him and his vision tunnels to a pinpoint. He squeezes his eyes closed and steadies himself. Once he does, he opens his eyes and realizes they are wet.  The tears stream down his face and freeze it. He’s losing everything dear to him, everyone dear to him. He doesn’t know what to do; he’s woefully unprepared.
This chapter was getting a bit too long...so we will continue the day in the next chapter! More fun to be had!
“Captain Rogers sustained a significant penetrating wound to the lower abdomen that pierced through his uteri sacs. If we don’t remove them soon, then infection may set in. Since the serum hasn’t helped heal the sacs, I’m afraid it might not ward off a potential infection either.” The doctor waits. She has that look of a teacher who’s frustrated with an irascible child.
“You did nothing of the sort,” Thor said. He grimaced as he felt the strings of Tony’s discomfiture. “I would say I am complacent in my brother’s deeds. I was the one who never noted his jealousy of my position. I pretended that his actions as a youth were mere playful antics. But they were not. I should have read the signs. Neither my father nor my mother read the signs. Yet still it happened. I mourn his death now because of the loss of what could have been. Am I guilty of his deeds? No. Will I ensure I keep an open eye in the future? Yes.” He paused and kept his sights on Tony. “Perhaps now you see the weaknesses and frailty of us all?”
“Take me around? Show me the sights?”
“No. Just wanted to ask a question.” Now that he has her on the comms, he feels a little silly. Clearing his throat, he says, “Have you ever heard of nanites for prep and lube?”
“A little,” Steve confessed just that much. He wasn’t going to tell Bruce about the waves of unbridled anger and confusion. Of the inner workings of a mad mind, a beast searching for ways to communicate and to absolve itself of the sins of a man it had no control over. “I felt the anger and the confusion.”
“What? And he’s with Bucky?”
“I’m Doctor Strange. I was once one of the top neurosurgeons in the world until I had an accident,” the doctor said. He didn’t explain more. He let that drop and turned to the current topic. “I recently fought a cosmic evil and thus probably am responsible for unleashing the wave of magic besotting the world.”
If he lets the hell of what Obadiah Stane did twist and tug on the newly planted seedling of hope in his damaged heart, what will that do to his fading memory of Yinsen, of Steve? Steve – who is alive – he’s still so sure of it. Even as the days pass and he works on his armor, he knows there’s something more to happen, as if he’s been part of an interrupted story.
He cannot enter the Boundaries though he tries, repeatedly. He tried then, when the men had him, when the men tried to figure out if he was an angel or a demon. As a higher being, it is forbidden for Steve to confess, or to take sides. He’s only supposed to follow orders, supposed to handle the people in need of Guardians, or Guides.
“Whoever the hell you are, I really don’t want to talk to you. You killed Captain America.”
“You ready?” Bucky says and thinks about his arm – losing it and the pain. Never – it was never as bad as this and Bucky tries not to consider who he’s bringing home, if it is even Steve anymore.
Tony kisses his shoulder and moves to embrace him. “No. Steve. No. That’s not all.”
“To India.”
“Saying that isn’t getting you out of paying the cab fare,” Wong mutters.
Only the echo of the well answers him. His eyes adjust to the low lighting and he twists on the chain looking for any sign of Tony. A gut churning fear that Tony’s below the water, dead already, hits him and starts to search with his legs and feet – finding nothing but bones. Part of him knows this is all virtual, Tony’s okay. There’s no need to worry. If he’s not in the rim then he must have been booted out of the connection. He’ll get back in soon enough. Of course, Steve has no idea if it means Tony has to go through the first two rims alone again.
Sometime later he blinks crusty eyes awake and stares up at Tony who’s leaning over him with a furrowed brow. Steve rubs at his eyes to focus and Tony backs away a little before he asks, “Have you been out here all night?”
Tony sips the coffee, blanches at it, and then, as he stands, says, “I’m wily. Have to be sharp around me to fool me. And that coffee is terrible. Dump it.”
“Fine, fine.” He muffles the reply and Tony tries to hurry along – there’s really nothing in the tiny bathroom to help Steve.
Instead, Blu mumbles a growl and then bites into the hind quarters of the deer. Tony flinches and turns away. He does not want to see that. He’d never been one to watch nature programs on television. Before Tony even turns around though, Blu drops a thigh at his side and then goes back to the carcass, tearing away the ribcage and turning his back on the fire, blocking Tony’s view of his meal.
He can see the stars from here, the vastness of space only an arm’s length away. The scatterings of Way Stations, of planets and moons, and other Living Stations are all just hops along the way of the Dream Stars within the Inner Belts. He used to wish on the first stars he saw as a child in the Rims, hoping to someday live here. Now, all he wants to do is escape.
"Hold him still," Doctor Banner snaps, his anger evident in the flush of his cheeks, the harsh furrow of his brows.
Steve coughed and cleared his throat as the world around him came into sharp focus again. “I’m not sure I know what that means.”
Steve struggled to swing his legs over the bed, to slide off the side, and then stay on his feet as he padded across the floor. The tiles were cold against his bare feet. Without the blanket, the air chilled him. He only wore a t-shirt and boxers. He had no idea where they came from. The shirt was too small. He reached out and touched Tony. A connection like an arc of electricity locked them together. It tingled along his hand and up his arm, but he didn’t shy away from it.
He had no clue how to answer that and only lowered his gaze. “I’m sorry.”
“I need you to be with me. I need you to-.” He bites down on his lower lip.
“Yep, I got you there. I don’t think so. I think that Ultron likes to play with his food, as I said. He wouldn’t do that. He wants us to struggle.”
Slipping out of the bed, Steve picked up his clothes and tossed them in the laundry. He still wore his uniform pants. Going to the en suite, he threw cold water on his face and shivered. The echo of the pain danced in his head and he gripped the edge of the sink. He thought he might be sick, the need to throw up powerful. He leaned over the sink and vomited bile. After he rinsed his mouth, the dry heaves followed. He stayed in the bathroom, hunched over the sink, holding the sides of the counter until he thought the granite would crack. Finally, the episode passed, and he mustered the strength to clean up and then he left the bedroom to find his way to his floor and change his clothes after a long shower.
“But it wasn’t SHIELD. It was Hydra,” Steve said and sighed. The tension in his shoulders and back increased and Tony reached over and touched his arm. Hill noted his action with a raised brow but kept up the impromptu briefing.
He nods to the doctor who reads it as his exit which Tony is grateful for his perceptiveness. Once the doctor leaves, Tony walks up to the bed and touches Steve’s hand. He doesn’t pick it up, or hold it, he just grazes a finger over the back of his hand. “I used to dream of you. Do you know that? Probably not. When you first came back and then went on your road trip.” He pauses to brush his hand gently over Steve’s. “After I broke up with Pepper, I used to think about you. Maybe it was always you. Maybe that’s why I’ve always been a little broken. It’s in my DNA. My father searched for you, for years and years. I always thought about you. You know.” He laughs a little. “I was the one who told Fury to look for you again. It was a snarky remark. I told him if he didn’t want me for his boy band then he should go and look for Captain America.” Tony hadn’t phrased it so politely then.
Bucky crosses the tiny room. Doesn't matter how small it is, they've been sharing rooms since their orphan days running the streets of New York City back east. It isn’t much since it’s above the town jail. Steve lies on the only cot in the room; the cot is unofficially Bucky’s bed. Most days he ends up finding sleep in the Sheriff's chair in the front office downstairs to keep the rowdy occupants of the jail quiet during the night. As Bucky kneels next to the cot, he pushes his one hand down on Steve’s non-injured shoulder.
“For going all the way to Canada and back again in one day? You’re welcome. You will be receiving a pretty hefty house call bill,” Strange returns.
“No. I’m just-.” He stopped and then had decided on the truth. “I just worry that you’ve given over too much of yourself to the war. What will be left when it is over?” Steve placed his hand on Tony’s cheek, feeling the stubble. “What will be left?”
“Still I don’t want him anymore damaged than he already is,” Tony says because it’s clear the omega will be in need of care and medical attention. “Just make sure he’s at least clean.”
“Wounds?” Sam scrunched up his features and then flinched as the memories must have collided in his consciousness. He dropped back down on the table, closing his eyes and pushing the heels of his hands into them. “Gone crazy. The whole fucking country. Shit. I thought I was dead.”
“This whole situation,” Steve says and manages to walk over to the workbench without keeling over- he counts it as a win. Thank you, Fury, for all the bruises and the residual pain from the wing wounds.
“Of course,” Tony says and walks Friday over to Steve. “Get up.”
“It might be,” Steve says and he hedges his bets. “Sometimes there are special bonds between an angel and a human.”
“If you think it would help?” Steve says and he hates that his voice sounds hopeful, questing for Rhodes to confirm for him.
He hears the sounds of crackling lightning again and his mind flips back to Thor. It’s not Thor – it’s Ultron tricking him, distracting him. But the shield is already in Steve’s hand and when Hulk pounds down at him, the shield deflects and resonates with a high pitched whine. Hulk stumbles back.
With a quick kiss, Tony hurries out of the room and heads toward his own room. He knows that in the side pockets of this suitcase or even the toiletry bag he usually has the required lube and condoms. He rips through his case and finds nothing and then moves onto the bathroom where he goes through the toiletry bag. “Got it!” He grabs the lube and packet of condoms and rushes back to the master bedroom only to find it empty.
“You didn’t wake up here,” Clint replied.
He surveys the party as he settles his bitterness and tries to ignore the burning heat of embarrassment on his face. “That’s kind of you to say, Sir.” He picks his words not only carefully but with some amount of attack. “Perhaps you would like to check your manifest for the trip to the Lemurian Star.”
“Well, Hydra Corp has been making some waves-.”
He should really rest, because his head pounds and he feels a little like he’s floating, like his body is too light to stay on the bed. “I’m not sure I have a family anymore.”
“Not sure,” Tony says and climbs to his feet. He checks the controls in the cockpit area of the jet. He flicks a few but nothing happens. “I’m not sure. It has to be you. The cold, the frozen water. It doesn’t make any other sense.”
Steve recognizes her from his delirium. Ringlets of wiry hair frame her face, a face warm and rich in color and texture. He wonders how many lives she’s lived.
“Sometimes you have to jump right in or else you’ll never move,” Steve said, and he dropped to his knees in front of Tony. Steve leaned into him as Tony rested back on the couch. Tony cupped Steve’s face in his hands.
“What trickery is this?” Hunter snaps his fingers and his companion jerks the whip. It lands on the big cat’s back, searing and sizzling. The lion leaps up, claws out, jaws open wide. He twists against the assault and swipes a giant paw at Hunter.
Tony tastes his soup, shrugs, and then says, “When I was little but a little too old to go crying for a kiss to make it better, Ana would make me soup. She was always a wonder in the kitchen.”
It surprised Tony when he first set eyes on Steve’s cock that he was cut. It’s a beautiful shape and arches toward his belly; it brought such torturous anticipation in Tony that he barely had been able to speak. The first lick up the large blood vessel sent both Tony and Steve into new heights. Steve growled and clung to the bed. When he down his whole cock in one swift move, Steve cried out with such pure sweet agony that Tony almost came from the sound. The taste of his come still lingers on Tony’s tongue even as he slips a condom on and watches as Steve’s once spent cock comes to attention.
Steve released him then and sidled underneath Tony. Looking up at Tony as he panted over him, Steve opened his mouth and then gulped down Tony again. This time Tony couldn’t hold back and as soon as Steve worked his throat around his swollen cock, he came. Steve swallowed as much as it could of the bitter seed until it frothed around his lips and he came into his own hand as he stroked himself.
“So, you do what, exactly?” Steve asks.
“He is but I have my ways, Steve. Now where did he hurt you?” She cocks an eyebrow at him.
Tony holds up his hands. “I don’t mean to rush you. It feels better, right. I can wait.”
Using Tony’s shoulder as a brace, Steve forces himself to his feet. His legs feel strangely absent as all of his nerves pulse at his groin.
His fingers wrapped around her throat as the terror shivered through her. Her trembling – he fucking felt it – the bond telegraphed the memory to him. The sensory overload made him gag. He knew every cursed moment of the last breaths of his mother.
“His daughter. She was ill. He thought it would save her,” Bruce said, and tears had formed in his eyes. He slumped even further into himself. “I tried. She tried. She was brilliant. A biochemist. Such a mind. Leaps and bounds over me. But she discovered something, something about the glands and she refused to tell her father. She knew he was a power-hungry asshole. She stood between him and his quest. She would rather die than reveal what she’d discovered.”
“I think I do, I fought a war to defend what freedom is in this country.”
“What do you mean?” Tony’s the little spoon today. Sometimes Steve needs him to be the big spoon. Sometimes Tony takes his time with Steve and breaks him apart into the frail small man he used to be and then that’s when Tony tells Steve how much he loves him. But today Tony needs the security that only Steve can give him, not even his suit of armor feels as protective and secure.
“The Legion takes care of this world, we’re assigned to it.”
When he calmed down, Tony placed his hands-on Steve’s shoulders. “Are we going to make it?”
“I’m not going to get into quantum entanglement of particles because I can see just by saying that you going to get frustrated. But let’s just say what you do to one, happens to the other.” Tony drops to sit on the ground and Steve follows him.
“Shit! What just happened?” Steve says.
“In some ways, there are some people who brought that hierarchy out here,” Tony says. “Like your territorial governor. Sure, he has someone like Fury as his assistant, but that’s all for show. You think he listens to a word Fury says? A former slave? I don’t think so. Before you know it, Captain, this entire safe haven of yours is going to transform into the world you left behind.”
“I need some air,” he says and even to him it sounds weak and trite.
“Oh, you found some very creative ways,” Tony spat back. That sounded all kinds of wrong but Steve couldn’t find the energy care. He was sure then that if he spoke a soul bond word for Tony it would be villain, enemy, adversary. They’d been only the barest of teammates during the whole invasion and attack on New York. Sure, Steve was happy to see that Tony was alive after he’d fallen from the sky. But the truth was, so far, Tony mixed with Steve as well as oil and water. It might be an old cliché but it was accurate as hell.
“Of what I swear I did before – in the future. And it doesn’t make sense and it-.” He stops and stares at the cityscape around him. His words are low this time. “It seems I keep losing my world. Over and over again.”
As he heads to the bathroom to re-apply a new applicator of nanites, he calls to Tony, “Are you going to tell me what Bohemian is or do I have to guess?”
“Can I ask why?” Tony says. “Isn’t Loki or whatever his name is, a grown man? Is he a boy of seven or eight?”
Steve groans and the sound vibrates through his chest like a truck. It hurts. He hadn’t realized it would still hurt when he awoke, but then he’s not sure what’s happening or, for that matter, what happened. He peels an eye open to see Tony hanging over his bed. His beard needs a trim and his hair is in disarray over his head.
It’s too late because as he scans the area to find the last soldier, a surge of troopers rush down the stairwell. Bucky has no choice. He abandons his search for the remaining trooper, runs to Steve’s side who slumps over unaware or unconscious Bucky doesn’t know which, and gathers Steve into his arms. Before he picks Steve up though, he stops and aims the blaster at one of the pillars, giving it a glancing strike. It’s not enough to crumble the entire pillar but it’s enough to weaken. It begins to sway as Bucky yells for Redwing and takes off toward what he hopes will be the inlet for the garbage shoot.
Steve’s not sure how he should respond. It’s clear they might never get over this issue. “I did what I thought was right. As your friend, as your lover, and as your omega. I’d do it again. I didn’t see a purpose in hurting you.”
“He is on hold now, sir.”
“Where does the cabin come from? The food?” Steve asks.
If it is not to be, if the gland has not been primed for him by the knot and Tony’s own scent – then the lack of synchronicity of their hormones would taint the taste. It would be bitter, acidic, and burn Tony’s tongue. It would sicken, even poison him to the brink of illness.  The flow bursts into his mouth and it is the elixir of life. It’s sweet and honeyed, so fulfilling that it feels as if something basic, something integral to his life that he’d been missing all along snaps into place. He needs more than this. He reaches down and unlocks the spreader bar, casting it away. Fumbling with his zipper, he pulls out his heavy cock and pushes the omega’s legs apart. With the cock cage in the way, it’s awkward, but Tony rams home and shudders with release. He pumps into the omega, fucking him with a wild fervor. He moans into the bite, the flood of elixir hits his tongue and Tony nearly swoons with its taste.
“So what? I’ll be a resident genius. We have Legolas, and then there’s death by thighs over there,” Tony said.
Clint eyes the gauntlet on Tony’s right hand. “Not sure you can shoot with that thing on. Not sure you can have a hot dog, either.” He smirks.
“It’s what you wished you could have had.”
Steve looks up at him and his eyes are fully open, the swelling down considerably. It isn’t normal, it isn’t human. And the feeling of being out of place, out of time comes over Tony and he jitters as Steve grasps his arm.
“See, even there it sounds like my father,” Tiberius says. “I know a little about what happened to you. I have some of my father’s records. Thankfully, Tony doesn’t remember any of it.”
“He’s a victim,” Steve replied. “We need to find him. Get resources together and search for him.” The idea that Bucky, loosed from his Hydra bindings but at the same time captured by the soul pack, might react badly to the muddled minds in his head only served to increase Steve’s fear. Of all of them, Bucky needed direction and assistance. How would someone so lost grapple with the ties of the soul pack? The last time he’d seen Bucky, the beat of his soul resonating with Steve’s only served to drive him away. As Bucky left him by the river, the glint of metal and the bleed of the shine of it in Steve’s eyes blinded him. But then again, Bucky hadn’t been the only one to save him that day. A comforting shadow had appeared and  brought him, carried him to the hospital. He’d flown? The wind gently hitting his face and the quiet words spoken to him as they flew to safety came back to him. But how? He wasn’t sure because the memory blurred out.
Like everything happened.
“You’re scaring me, Cap.”
“The – it- he was, is an experiment, sir,” Sawyer said and Rumlow scowled at him. “He’s special. We gotta take samples every couple of days for experiments.”
“Yeah, you’ve been caught in the Hub for three days. We barely were able to pull you out before we finally defeated Ultron.”
Bruce lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “Good as can be expected. Nat and I have been working on calming techniques for the Hulk. Seems to work.”
The lion raises a brow at him and tilts his head – the armor still in his mouth.
Tony came to the fire, putting his hands out to warm them. It was still a little more smoky than warming but Steve moved the logs to create more air pockets for the fire.
“It shouldn’t be, but I want to take all the precautions I can. You’re valuable Steve.”
Steve turned over in the bed to stare out of the window of that long ago apartment. Curled next to him, Tony whispered in to the dark. For some reason, the thought of Tony in his bed didn’t upset him. Not in this dream state.
With a tender hand, Tony reaches over and clasps Steve’s hand. “You’re not alone.”
“The history books, the science books, every book in the whole Council of Worlds has been written by an alpha or by a beta and approved by an alpha. They say the victor writes the history, but the victor also controls everything else, including science and philosophy.” Steven watches Tony as the dawning hits him. And Tony knows, knows it is written all over his face. “The alphas also control the science and therefore changed the omega so that they are sterile.”
stay here, you know. Not here, here, but your own apartment. I have a whole floor for you.”
He checks the time on the crappy motel clock by the side of the bed. It’s been over an hour since he talked with Clint.  He only has a few miles to go to get to the place where Steve was going to meet with the guy – he figures it must have taken Steve a while to get out here. It’s not as if he has a car; he has to rely on public transportation as far as Tony knows. He closes the motel door and then checks in his trunk again for all of his supplies. This is going to get nasty pretty fast. He knows that much.
“The sentence is death.”
“No it can’t,” Strange said.
As they lay together – recovering – Tony understood they followed a new path now. He’d left being human behind, as he had with being vampire as well. The world, the universe, lay at their feet, and Tony discovered he wished not for it to kowtow to him, but to see him as he really was – as a person – an equal. Part of him still hungered for revenge and every day he had to quell that part, a part in misery because of the agony he endured. He witnessed the same in Steve. A good man, but a man still tortured by his past. Together they battled to remain free of becoming jaded, and instead they strived to free themselves of the bonds of hatred to lead the way to a better place, a better world. For now, they became stronger in who they were, more powerful in their gifts.
Steve cupped his big, strong hand along Tony’s jaw. “Sweetheart, I can’t. I gotta go back to work.” His eyes searched Tony’s bleak complexion. “Next time. I’ll come back tomorrow night and you can drink all you want. I have the weekend off.”
“This is not going to be easy,” Steve mutters. He doesn’t admit out loud that it’s about as clear as mud but contends privately that they’re in Ultron’s brain and not the other way around. He hopes.
Ross glances at the guards and with a simple gesture, they leave the room, save for one who stands next to the door with an AR15 at the ready. “You have to understand, I have to see how far I can go. That’s how you play the game.”
“Unfortunately, no.” Natasha said.
“You’re more of an observer of people than I gave you credit for,” Steve said and crossed his arms over his chest. He looked satisfied, happy even.
He cradles the tin cup in his hands and sips the water as he bends upward. He’s clearly still in pain, but Tony thinks it has little to do with the injuries he’s sustained and everything to do with those strange protuberances on his back.
“Good. I’m good.” In the recesses of his brain, alarms go off. This isn’t about his pleasure, but the prince’s. “Let me, let me do something for you.” He lifts a far too heavy arm.
He remembered feeling older than himself the first time around. He could recall the exact flavour of affectionate embarrassment, the wry self-awareness that overwhelmed him as he came face to face with his own naive eagerness…
Amongst the first of his regrets was that he’d stubbornly insisted on an event so far away from the hotel. Given that, really, Steve could’ve had this temper tantrum anywhere, he could at least have saved them all from having to trek this far in the midday heat.
Sadly, it wasn’t often like this.
Tony’s voice.
we’re done” Tony answered, lifting his head and pointing at the rack of vials “If I’m right, that is the finished serum. Six batches. But I’m going to run tests on two of them before we go, just to make sure they do what I’m expecting them to…”
Steve had been counting down the seconds since Dr Stape attached the last of the little ECG tabs.
Then he dropped his head to kiss Steve, softly and sweetly, resisting Steve’s efforts to lean up and kiss him deeper…
Steve felt his chest loosen, a pleasant shiver running up his spine as he finally recognised that Tony was actually
A trembling heat flared up under Tony’s skin, melting what was left of his resistance. He parted his lips, softening into Steve’s embrace, letting Steve kiss him deeper. Sighing, Steve snaked one arm around Tony’s waist, letting his other hand stroke up over the back of his neck, into his hair. A thousand electric shivers ran down along Tony’s spine-

sitting in his lap. And, as they broke the kiss, their eyes met and-
With no time to think about it, Steve pulls off his shield, aims, and flings it at the construct. The horror of Clint’s head flying, decapitated by the sharp edge of the shield will haunt Steve for years to come. He scrambles the rest of the way down the hill, grasps Tony, and leaps for the pulsating blue light. His shield is lost to him and the blue light is cold and frozen.
“Name’s Happy Hogan, I work for Mister Stark.”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “But you think you can use virtual reality to stop him, erase him.” He hated using the pronoun him. It wasn’t a him or a her or anything in between. It was a demon.
The guard grunted his approval. “I’m Brock Rumlow. Assigned to daily duty with o four. Get tired of all those numbers.”  He sniffled and pointed down the gray corridor. “It’s awake. I just finished the daily scrub down.”
“Well, if fucking hurts you’re probably doing it wrong,” Steve replies and that brings a smile to Tony’s tormented face.
Tony went to the task. First, he placed a still semi-conscious Steve on the gurney and let Natasha tuck the blanket around him. Tony refused to think about the last day, about what had happened, but it was hard to deny the fact that Steve had multiple vampire bites on his body. He’d lost a ton of blood. Tony focused his thinking on taking care of Steve, not on the horror that either of them endured. If he faced then horror, then his mental ability to function would break down. He quickly stripped one of the agents and put on the clothes. They felt tight, binding, but Tony tossed the ammuno vest to the side. He needed his chest to be open and able to be summoned for defense. He shook his head; strange days and strange thoughts.
“Get him under control.” Someone barks. Tony cannot make out their faces in the dark of the room. Beams of light flash around the room in a wild, almost maddening pattern, and Tony catches a glimpse of Steven silently fighting with a dozen men. He’s naked and vulnerable but his expertise in hand to hand combat shines.
“Well?” Tony says after a brief period.
Steve tightens his lips and limps back to the bed. All the movement has eaten away at his energy and he drops on the bed like his limbs are made of lead. “Doesn’t matter. If they find out, I can’t – we can’t be here anymore.”
“Lots of confidence there,” Tony muttered, and this time Steve threw him a sour look.
“Almost doctor?” He really must have been running some kind of fever considering how muddled his brain seems to be right now. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand?”
"I'm not doing this without you," Tony says because he recognizes the look of resignation, the look of surrender in Steve's eyes.
Tony watched him leave and envied him for falling so easily into his role as guide. How long had it been since Thor joined their pack and already he naturally offered advice and guidance like a pro, and here was Tony scratching his way through the dirt, trying to eek out a way to be Beloved. Still he couldn’t fathom what it meant. How it worked.
“Do you even know where you’re going? We should take a flashlight or something,” Steve says but allows himself to be led up the small hill to the other side. The hill isn’t quite large enough to completely block the light from the house, but it looks out towards the wooded area and the sea beyond it.
Sam considered him, his dark eyes murky with memory, but he remained resolute in his vow to help. “I’ll do what I can.”
Tony says nothing in return, simply nods, opens the bag, and snuggles down in it. It’s fiercely cold and the small propane burner warms a tiny circle around it. He moves away, allowing Tony access to the warmth. He stands up near the cockpit and watches the snow batter the jet.
The arch pulses with a blue white light as if reprimand Tony for his assessment of Ultron. “Don’t you recognize me, my dear maker. I am the Guardian of Life.”
“No. I’m eating brownies for lunch,” Tony says and wraps his whole arm around the container.
Tony was scared to call it an epiphany. He’d had too many of these moments of enlightenment, when everything suddenly seemed to fit into one coherent image, and everything could be answered by this one miraculous insight… only for it to disappear when the light changed. Experience had taught him that these moments were more about his mood than anything else. That it was only ever a question of which part of it he was looking at…
, and kind, and good. And I have never wanted anyone like this, I have never felt this way before… That was incredible. You are incredible…” And he put one hand to the side of Steve’s face, very gently stroking away a tear that Steve hadn’t even noticed.
It just broke out of him, a constant stream of words just falling over his lips in between frantic gasps, high-pitched and pleading.
And kissed him.
And then he felt Tony
And in no way prepared for what he was about to walk into.
Doing it again,
“Oh, God Tony, Tony…” he breathed, barely aware he was doing it…
Oh, this was all becoming horribly obvious.
Every inch of him thrummed with a physical sense of peace, something he wouldn’t have been able to explain, but that he already knew so well. A fundamental sort of comfort, as though he’d found his natural resting position…
Tony stared again, as humiliatingly obvious as he’d been the first time that he saw Steve. Tony even knew he was doing it. It was just…
It irritated him that Steve

stage every evening, but I couldn’t tell you exactly when he was going to be there.”
“Yeah, sure.” Steve nodded, grinning broadly by now. “I mean, if that’s okay.”
, he looked incredible - every inch of him displayed for Tony as he panted and moaned and rocked up against him, those impossible thighs tensed against Tony’s hips, his cock already hard again, leaking against his stomach-
Even though he didn’t recognise any of the specific components, even though the symbols on the hazard signs made no sense to him… He knew exactly what they were. He knew which part of this system was working as a turbine, how it was connected to the generator, what these dials were designed to measure… Maybe it was just emboldening effects of the atmosphere, but he was even beginning to think he’d be able to read them…
...These were the people who deemed Tony too reckless and narcissistic, by the way.
If Tony didn’t walk away from him then, maybe it would mean-
Tony couldn’t tell whether Steve still sounded drunk or not.
“Buck?” He slurred, finding that his jaw was heavier than he’d been expecting. He heard a familiar voice huff softly beside him, and turned his head to see Bucky slumped on a wooden chair, his wrists bound behind him, his torso and legs tied with additional lengths of rope.
“You… Make it hard, for me to be nice to you, sometimes.” Steve started, carefully, watching Tony’s face – so far, just the faintest hint of surprise… “It’s like you don’t know what to do with a genuine compliment, or you’re scared of actually valuing someone else’s opinion of you, or you’re wary of trusting a kindness… and, all of that breaks my heart. To think you’ve been hurt that much, and hounded that much, and attacked and put down that much… I don’t blame you, for this. Partly, I blame me for this, for whatever part I played in making you feel like-”
And then he let his head fall into his hands, and rubbed his eyes – only then realising how sore they were. His stomach twinged again, his tongue already coated in bile at the thought of drinking… He was tired, and achy, and worn down.
Belatedly, Tony recognised the tone in Bucky’s voice. He frowned, and looked up in search of it, unable to pick out any of the words… only the familiar jagged rhythm of an argument. His vision focused as he walked slowly around the bar, scanning more carefully for any familiar faces-

“Well, maybe if you did, you’d realise it’s nothing to be scared of…” Tony answered, quietly…

And it unnerved him a little, to think that he hadn’t already gone through all this… Normally, he’d have tied himself in knots at every stage of…something like last night, he’d have brought Captain America’s character spec to mind without meaning to – he’d have talked himself out of it, most likely.
“After we had the big talk,” Tony replied, a little sheepishly. “I just decided it would be a good idea to kiss him – which makes

He’d felt dirty saying it back - even though he was quite sure it was still true. He absolutely did still love Pepper…

These impulses were still being applied to Tony Stark – and that, as it turned out, was very different to them being applied to someone like Obie.
“Oh. Right,” Nat muttered, looking him up and down.
“I’m sorry that I didn’t do more to help you then – that I didn’t just do less to wind you up” Tony raced on, like he was worried he’d run out of words before he got through it all. “That I didn’t think about
That helped clear Tony’s head a little bit –

feeling, gathering at the small of his back…
But Tony loved Steve because he wouldn’t do any of those things.
Just,

“Yeah, it
“I’ve always been pretty bad at…that.” Steve sounded numb.
“Well, there are a lot of options for pain relief-” Tony began, but Bucky cut him off,

“Tony…” Steve whispered.

Which was nice, of course.
It had never really occurred to him that he might have meant something to
so good to drink like this. Tony could feel that ache inside him easing, his whole body relaxing as that heat curled though him.
That there was still the Steve Rogers part of him, the boy who felt everyone’s suffering as his own, who couldn’t bare

But, by the time Tony had made it over to the coffee pot, he’d remembered why it was complicated. The smile became a vaguely irritated frown as all his many issues tried to crowd into his head at once. He told himself that he had to get a grip, and sort all of this out, and think about it properly –

Not even because he felt justified to do it in the moment.
His head wasn’t full of grand questions,
He was just so tired of

He heard Tony hum a satisfied smile, and only then realised his eyes had fallen shut. When he opened them again the room was clouded with purple shadows, and all he could see was Tony, shining at the centre of it-
Tony paused, briefly. And then, because that had been just
“So, you don’t want to do this anymore?” Steve asked, his voice small.
Out cold.

But, as usual, you've got a couple of pages of introspection to get through, first 😆 HOWEVER, please be aware, there IS smut in this chapter - do not let the opening paragraphs trick you into thinking you can read it at your grans house, or whatever.
Tony grinned.
“Not to mention all the other drugs and resources” He added, bitterly.
Until, abruptly, they were standing at the end of Tony’s bed – and Tony’s hands were all over him again.
And found that they now had their arms wrapped tight around each other while Bucky kissed Sam’s neck.
Then he let his head fall into his hands.
He glanced up, and saw Steve smiling at him, his eyes dropping not very subtly to Tony’s lips.

Steve had found it trickier than he’d expected to get a feel for Clint.
...Oh, that was a bit fast.
He wanted to agree, eagerly, and add his own examples.
, when I tried to think of a time… and it was a stupid example. It was always a stupid example, and I’m sorry-”
A sharp tingling broke out all over his skin as he tried to process what about this one image was so instantly, disorientingly thrilling-
true that Tony had made his own mistakes during that whole ordeal – some of them pretty damn serious.
If Steve had just
The world faded out of focus for… a time, as Steve forgot that it existed. He didn’t notice if Rhodey had wandered away from him, or if he’d wandered away from Rhodey.
the problem is. And I don’t think it’s anywhere near where anyone else has been looking…” he spoke to somewhere in Steve’s general vicinity.
Steve felt an electric shock, as his fingers brushed softly over Tony’s.
And there was the exact same destructive compulsion that had gripped Tony during that very first appointment-
want to be special to Tony, that he wanted to be the one to help him – that he wanted Tony to know. That he wanted Tony to like him.
It didn’t put him off of talking to her though, because she was just too perfect a companion for this exact moment. Her constant, inebriated chatter was an impenetrable buffer to any interaction with Steve. Her total lack of inhibitions meant Tony could ask her for all sorts of information, without her even wondering why.
maybe I’ll be able to work out what needs doing first, and how - so, to start with, I’m going to need you to make some notes…”
little gesture – he nodded.
“No, don’t be,” Bucky reassured - in exactly the way Steve wished he wouldn’t.
He could take everything in at a sweep, immediately spot the patterns, retrieve and review theories in his mind even as he was reading ahead to something else.
There wasn’t

“Look, Tony,” Rhodey went on gently, when Tony didn’t say anything. “I know there’s a lot of things you think you can’t have. And – I’m not going to get into that argument again, I promise. But… with everything else you do, it’s only about making it
It smelled of cherries.
And that was…
“Yeah. There’s a roof garden” He explained, curtly, putting his feet up and letting his head slide down to rest on the arm of the couch. “The stars are all wrong. We’re a

sorry that you don’t feel that way, that you feel this bad for snapping and saying it once – I’m sorry if I ever made you think it would have been better if you’d never woken up, I’m just sorry-”
And Steve caught the jerking motion of Tony standing up suddenly, the colour already running out of his face by the time Steve looked over to him…
“The team’s meeting in the conference room in an hour,” Nick replied, breezing right over the edge on Steve’s voice. “Agent Romanoff is going with you.”

That, even if the amount he drank this morning was affecting him, he still didn’t know
He pushed himself up on his arms – as much as he could, into the little space Steve had left between them – doing his best to shrug his way free of his clothes. Eagerly. Desperately. Steve was pushing the shirt back over Tony’s arms before he’d even torn the last button off, caressing his hands over Tony’s shoulders, digging his fingertips into his muscles. Kissing the side of Tony’s face, messy and desperate and uncontrolled, and then his neck, and then the newly exposed skin of his collarbone and shoulder blade. Tony panting and swallowing and trying to decide between grabbing at Steve and getting his shirt off.
Obviously, given the power to change things, Steve would’ve stopped every one of these crises before they started. He

On an impulse, Steve leapt to his feet, and found himself strolling into his bathroom -
There was a giddying rush of freedom, something that felt so familiar and so foreign all at once – something he’d known so well, but such a long time ago… It had been years since Steve just
“Dr Stape,” Bucky sighed, wearily.
His hands, now caressing hard into Tony’s thighs, in time with that determined pulsing feeling-
There was a sudden spike of alarm, as Steve realised that he

But Steve’s head was still on his shoulder.
“Please Tony,” Steve whispered again, pushing his wrist close to Tony’s mouth.
The same horrified panic gripped Steve by the throat - and then the same embarrassed realisation-
“Are SHIELD looking for you?”

“Is that a problem?” He demanded.
And then he heard the softest little crack in Steve’s breathing… and glanced up to see a single tear slide down his face. There was a shock of panic in Tony’s chest – but the moment Steve caught his eye he shook his head,
Whatever ‘getting over Steve’ looked like in the end, however long it took him, however many false starts… It couldn’t be predicated on Tony not caring what happened to Steve. That wasn’t in Tony’s control. And it wasn’t one of the wrongs that Tony wanted to right. And he was pretty sure that would’ve made him the asshole anyway…
“Do you know what’s up there? What happens on the fourth floor?” Tony asked. Maribelle shook her head.
And there was a natural instinct to assume his own sanity, a feeling that there must be a sensible answer if only he could find it…
And Steve found himself grinning too, as they made their way out to the corridor – one hand holding Tony’s, the other holding onto the waist band of his jeans. He was…relieved? Happy?
“...There are people you can talk to about that, if you need to. I can get you a list of the people who know.”
…And, anyway, he really
By now Tony’s cock was throbbing with a low, constant ache, the pressure building in the small of his back, his entire body trying to push itself forward - the
Tony knew what Steve was saying, what he was scared of,
“Did he say
” Bucky called out, his own voice warm with amusement. “It’s good job the Red Skull didn’t have a fucking ball pit, isn’t it-”
Steve had mourned a lost future in which Tony got to grow old with Pepper and Morgan, back when it was the only ‘happy ending’ he could imagine. For so long,
And there was…
He thought about just saying that Steve was hot. He even made a few false starts, typing and deleting the same opening three times before he recognised… No, he just wasn’t comfortable with that. He had no idea why, but that just felt… cheap.
And it wasn’t that he felt bad for either Bucky or Steve. He’d not gotten as far as asking whether his reaction could be justified. He just knew that he’d not bothered to ask himself that at that time. That he’d only done it

It just…cooled, and faded, and… then he couldn’t see it at all…
...Quite calmly, Tony found himself asking if this really
And then he felt Tony slide his arm under him in one smooth, confident motion, somehow managing to roll Steve over as he lifted him up. Steve squeaked another surprised little giggle as Tony took all of his weight under one arm, holding him there while he tugged the wet duvet out from under him and threw it to one side. Still supporting Steve against his body as he climbed onto the bed next to him, and guided him to lie down against his chest.

to think… It was by far the most exhausting experience he’d ever endured. And he hadn’t even moved.
Oh, what had he done-
Steve had never thought about where things could go with Tony. He’d always stopped himself from thinking altogether, when that question threatened to occur to him – because he just knew he wouldn’t like the answer. That was the basic assumption he’d been operating under all this time. That it was going to hurt like hell to give Tony up, but that obviously he’d have to… That he’d just have to deal with that loss when it happened. That there was no point dwelling on it now.
Suddenly, his throat felt tight.
, for this-
. One hand grabbed at Tony’s hair, the other hand balling Tony’s shirt into a fist, exposing the skin at the small of his back. His cock pulsed sharply as Tony moaned.
However desperately he wanted Steve, however much it would hurt – literally
“Probably not quite
thought he was back there-
Steve made sure to stay in character, jumping to nervous attention and appearing generally put out by the intrusion. He allowed himself to gape as four men in black wheeled a covered gurney to the back of the room, trailed by three men in suits - who were already in the middle of a heated discussion.
It was also… sort of…
And then there were these moments. Moments of minor reprieve, in which Bucky simply existed, and nothing was much of anything…
So much so that the physical sensation almost faded out of focus, as Steve settled into that fast, brutal rhythm. It rolled below the surface, a wonderful, uncomplicated euphoria throbbing beneath the far more spiritual elation that had overwhelmed him-
Who was looking at him with such naked
he was doing…
“…So, why?” Tony pushed on – feeling a little flutter of excitement, just at hearing Steve’s name.
you all start another pissing contest, maybe we could talk a little bit about the mission specifics?” Nick suggested, irritably.
They’d exhausted all the mission related conversation by the time the food had arrived. After which, Steve had made a few brave little attempts at small talk, and Tony hadn’t known whether he resented Steve for bothering, or hated himself for the way he was reacting.
An illicit thrill ran up Steve’s spine as he slid a hand under Tony’s shirt, stroking greedily over his bare skin. Steve couldn’t help biting his lip, trying to stay quiet even though he liked it every time he failed.
.” And he took a little breath, and forced himself to look back at the beginning of his research, as a prompt. “I’m pretty sure Mallamen isn’t a city, as we’d think of it… I think it’s more like an estate… I think this building is like a Manor house, and the surrounding area is actually like a private estate… the Mallamen estate… has been here a thousand years, looks like – I think it
The searing burn as Steve pulled his hair, and dug his fingertips into Tony’s hips, and sucked at his skin hard enough to bruise…
And, God, Tony didn’t even know whether to feel enlightened or terrified, when he recognised that voice for what it was.
“That’s what bothers you about it? The business model?”
“Yeah, Monday was not a good day,” Tony conceded, with a self-conscious wince. “And I’m sorry, by the way.”
He didn’t stop to analyse whether he was

that beautiful body writhe and tense against his movements.
He wasn’t exactly concerned about pulling that one off.
…His friendship with Natasha hadn’t been based on some similarity of their souls or some irrefutable aspects of their characters - it had been a total fluke. Something that would never have unfolded the same way, if this exact same person had been given the chance to do the very thing that she was planning on doing anyway…
Tony laughs and then curls around the pain. “I’m sorry I couldn’t help you. It’s not going to get done, but the plans are on the table.”
Lucifer fell.
“I don’t know, I’ve been tortured by Nazis.”
“Not yet, not yet, my dear prince,” Steve whispers in his ear. He bends down, licks Tony’s weeping cock once and then lightly just to give a little abrasion, drags his teeth along the slit. Tony thrusts again, but Steve holds him back, keeping his orgasm stifled.
Steve watched as the family accepted them into their home. He scanned the room, saw the trappings of another life, a different life and deep within him the hopes and dreams that he’d smothered as a child resurfaced only to be slowly and painfully unraveled. What he witnessed before him remained elusive, almost foreign to him. He observed all of his team mates speaking to the children, gather like an extended family around Clint. They all were, in a way, since they were pack members. The bond seemed to extend and wrap them into an ancillary role. In some ways, it felt right and good for Clint, for the pack, yet Steve never felt more isolated and different. Slipping out, he went to the porch, stood there for a long moment, and then left. He walked. Just walked into the fields as if he could keep walking until he found what he sought in his heart.
“You fucking put me back in there or I swear I will rip the interface out myself!” Tony screams at Cho. She startles back from his vehemence but she’s not backing down.
“Cap?”
“Do you even know his name?” Tony spat back at the man. How dare he stand there, cool and collected, as if this travesty was normal. Was it? What other seconds did Howard hide?
“You know what I mean?” Tony finally says because the weight of the silence bullies him into it.
Tony drops his hands in defeat. “No. Not this time, JARVIS. I’m afraid my head’s just not right.” The idea of loving, wanting at one time seemed so foreign and hostile to him. All he ever saw had been his parents’ marriage, a charade put on for the media. Closed doors told a different story. One that caused him to cuddle up with his little toy lion and huddle under the blankets waiting for the screaming to stop.
Steve shrugged but didn’t take his hand away. After so long with little contact with anyone else that wasn’t in a battle, he basked and enjoyed it. “I think. I do it with Bruce, Nat, and Sam a bit. Not much. I don’t want to burden them.”
“Yes.” He realized he wasn’t lying. For the first time in weeks his dreams hadn’t bothered him. Sitting up, Steve said, “Peggy came to visit me.”
Tony suspected that the vampire confessed how his moment of turning had happened with those simple words of warning.  He heeded the warning and took Rhodey’s advice as well. They ended up at a bar, Tony drinking to his underage heart’s content. Rhodey had confessed watching Tony drink that night had been one of the good things, though he didn’t agree with it. At least, under Rhodey’s watchful eyes, Tony would wake up the next day – still alive but maybe not as well. He’d stayed away from Blood Dens then, until they became something of a necessity of his life.
“Captain?” Tony says and still Steve avoids looking directly at him, instead he focuses on the many wires around Tony. He frowns. “Come on Captain.”  This draws him to look at Tony directly. “Ah, there we are. Come.” He reaches his hands to Steve, and there’s nothing for it. He’s drawn in, towed in like a ship to whirlpool, dragged under to the depths below.
“We need to,” Tony agreed. His voice sounded far away. “We don’t know what’s coming. We need to protect the world.” He shivered. Even as Tony sat in the lavish room in the middle of London, the darkness of the void of space shadowed over him.  He’d never felt the chill of space when he hovered with a nuclear bomb on his back, but still, the cold hollowed out his chest, ate away at his bones, permeated into his soul. That place haunted him.
Steve silently questioned Clint but he only shook his head and raised his brows. He had no idea, either. When Sam returned he placed an old flip phone on the table. “It’s a burner. I keep it charged. Let’s just say I got a cousin who never has been a friend of the law. I keep it activated. Take it.”
“Now, you want to stop, or do we give you a few more of those?” Rumlow said.
“You’re okay with it?” Tony said as they held onto one another under the sea of soul stars.
If Tony didn’t know better, Steve sounds absolutely forlorn like a lost dog. He drops some of the old wires he clutches, stands up, hits his head on the side of the crate, curses, and then says, “Coming up soon.”
“Maybe it would be better, you know. Wouldn’t have all the stress anymore.” Bruce stifled an awkward sounding laugh. “Though eating someone’s brains sure doesn’t sound any better.”
“It’s one of Midgard’s ancient games. I thought all humans enjoyed their primitive sports.”
“For a few weeks,” Steve said and put his hands up as if he was surrendering to Tony. He sent calming waves to Tony through the bond, trying to reason with him. “I knew for a few weeks. That’s all. I came to you as soon as Sam and I verified-.”
“Time to face the music.” He climbs the stairs and crosses over to Steve’s room. Knocking, he calls, “Steve? Steve, can I come in?”
When he disembarked from the Avenger, Steven had stopped and stared, mouth slightly open. The world around him was nothing like he’d ever seen before and Tony asked him, “The Carbonelli family didn’t bring you here?”
Strange interrupts again. “It’s clear to me and to your therapists that you never moved beyond denial, Tony. Well.” He stops and does a little bob of his head as if to concede the point. “You probably hit anger a few times. But you’ve never truly accepted your situation.”
Steve smirked.
The lion licks his lips and yawns – bored looking at Tony. The blue eyes strike Tony. He recalls the nights cuddling Blu next to his chest and gazing down at the little stuffed animal, its blue eyes shining in the dark. In some ways he misses that blue light. His mind manifested his toy into a terrifyingly realistic illusion. The lion yawns again and then slowly settles down onto the cool stone floor of the cave. It looks at him and reminds Tony of the Golden Retriever dog that his father let him have for a very short period of time when he was a pre-teen.  Howard said that every boy needs a dog, teaches him how to be a man.
“That’s a loaded question.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked. He desperately wanted to get up, to put his hands on Tony’s shoulders, to bring him back to bed. It’s just a dream – a dream he was having while sleeping in Tony’s hotel room.
“No. I mean yes, I would hope we would have been, but he died when I was about a year old or so. He was in the Army, died in action,” Steve says, and his words are swallowed up by the enormity of the facts he just shared.
“I’m not sure to what you refer, sir.”
“Too long,” Tony says and grabs Steve’s arm. “Come on. Now.”
“Where are you going?” Tony said as he floated over Steve in the middle of the field.
“Well, join the club,” Clint says. “Can you get to the plateau above the river bank? I can’t set down but I could throw you a line.”
“You haven’t slept in 24 hours Tony. I think you need to sleep on this beforehand.” This all seems too fast to Steve. Way too fast.
“Seems I’ll have to read this book,” Tony says as if reading Steve’s mind.
“Your heart.”
“I drank from him,” Tony whispered. He hated to admit it. “I didn’t know any better.” Or did he? In wraith form, he’d watched his corpse crawl across the floor to the source of food.
“But the fact is once you split us, disentangle us, we’ll be separate. He’ll be the Steve who-.” He halts as if the words taste like acid on his tongue. “It won’t happen to me; it won’t be my future. It never really happened.”
“I was in the Army, Tony. I know how to handle myself,” Steve says. “How about some hot chocolate and cookies.”
“You like that?”
Pepper smiles and offers her hand. Steve takes it, there is an uncomfortable moment where he freezes as if he doesn’t remember what to do, but then he bends and kisses her hand. “It’s my pleasure, ma’am.”
Bucky brushes off the twigs and snow. There’s a dusting all over the ground as it snowed over the last few hours. He peers up in the sky, scanning for the ships. He hears them before he finds them. A loud boom cracks the night and Sam ducks as the forest around them quakes and trembles against the horrible sounds. He shields his eyes against the glare of the explosions.
“I don’t believe SHIELD doesn’t play nice with Captain America,” Tony said but Pepper walked over to him. She placed herr hand on his that was gripping the bar of the railing white knuckled.
“A sin of omission. But then again, so did I,” Natasha says. She lifts her shoulder in a shrug. “What does it matter? Why does it matter. What matters is that you need to be honest with yourself. You’re not mad at him because his friend killed your parents and he kept it from you. You’re mad at him because he protected his friend. You’re jealous.”
“And you cannot come here and try and lure me back,” Tony said and hoped his declaration would quell Pepper’s fretting as she chewed at her lower lip, and continued to tug at her hair.
“I am,” Pepper said as her hands betrayed her firm voice, shaking as she tapped on the keys.
Was that what Tony asked of Steve? To cut off Bucky, to make him leave behind a part of his soul? The light dawned – but like the morning it took its time, playing with the horizon, warming the landscape yet only slowly thawing out the frost of the night.
“Who put the damned arc reactor in my fucking chest?” he yells.
“No, you’re not, and don’t swear.”
Most of the time he simply walks in – that’s how he did it on the ship. He pauses and decides to knock.
“Well, then, I think we’ll go with that,” Tony replies and feels more than a little woozy and that he probably shouldn’t have shown off like that by walking across their little abode, and he stayed in the damned bed.
They’re all holed up in Tony’s lab. Why he allowed furry guy to join them in the lab, he can’t really recall. The guy has information about Steve’s health, so it seems reasonable to invite him along. But it has been three days. So that’s four days of Steve asleep, which seems excessive to Tony, but the doctors can’t get him to wake but won’t count him as comatose now because none of his tests make a comatose state. Except the not waking up part. Tony thinks that should probably be part of the assessment.
“I called you Steve, because that’s your name.” The Red Knight yanks off his helmet. A face so familiar greets the Silver Knight. “It’s a shock, I know.”
“Are you so sure?” Bucky says and his tone pierces through trying to melt the wedges of ice Steve’s built around his heart.
Tony grunted and took the offered mug. He wasn’t going to drink it, not really, but without a thought he sipped it. He had to admit, it tasted divine. “What’s with the hoodie?”
“But you dream of it,” Bruce said.
The people – his team, his family – seem to materialize out of the blurriness of the room. It’s Natasha who’s spoken and it surprises him because she’s never been known to be so emotionally linked with anyone on the team – except maybe Bruce at one time or even Steve, but never him.  She’s leaning heavily against Sam and his eyes are glued not to Tony’s gurney but to the one across the room. Before Tony can ask what the hell just happened, it’s Cho who chimes in.
“Tony, stop. You’re liable to choke the man,” Pepper says and then she turns to Steve. “You have to understand, Sheriff, we live a less conventional life.”
Standing at a counter, chopping vegetables, Bruce looked up and smiled. “Nice to see you Cap.”
The next chapter we'll be stepping a little further away from the Pretty Woman plot line as we get into the nitty gritty of the war. Steve and Tony will share a sweet moment and then - well, all hell will break loose!
“So it really isn’t a jump to a different universe but a transformation of our universe?” Tony asked. It rankled him because he couldn’t recalled a time when soul packs did not exist. That meant that everyone, including Tony, been changed by an outside force.
“I’d hope not, but Pierce, who is definitely not in the good column, may have control of me, and you, eventually, maybe-.” Steve stops. “It isn’t an automatic sentence, but the Realms and the Heavens wouldn’t look too kindly on me considering we’re in the middle of a Collapsing Event.”
Steve took it at face value and repeated, “I’m going to be in town tomorrow to see Bruce, and I thought it would be nice to get together. Maybe have dinner?”
Blu growls low in his throat and tosses his head, then pounds his one paw on the ground.
“Goodnight Steve.”
Those words describe how the alpha part of his nature overcomes him after suppressants. It’s one of the reasons the medical community advises against their use. He shrugs; he can handle it. He’s not close to his urgency. Slipping on his glasses, he taps the arm. “Penny, do we have a calendar on my urgency?”
“Good idea,” Tony said. He considered both of them. Human and willing. Happy wasn’t even mated to anyone, he was just a loyal employee and friend of Tony’s. Clint – Clint was another story, one that Tony still didn’t understand not after all these years, but then again Tony still didn’t get Natasha either. He hoped he could trust them both. “Please. Keep at it.” He pointed to Clint. “Happy, help him out. Natasha needs the help and Clint’s her go to man. You got it?”
“Purple’s my color.”
“Not a sir,” Fury says. “Stark’s ship’s coming in. You are to escort him to his lounge until he’s assigned to a ship for transport.”
After a long comfortable silence, Tony asks, “What are you thinking?”
Tony didn’t speak again to Steve during the flight. He should have. He admitted that much to himself, but sometimes he could be as pigheaded as the next guy.  When they approached the rendezvous point, Tony glanced over at Steve near the front of the jet and sighed. He reached out then, just a slight brush, a caress of his soul against Steve’s, and felt a shudder in response. Steve met his gaze and smiled. They might not always agree, but the bond remained.
He is separate from the world around him. He is one specific point on a map of time and space. He has an identity. A history.
“So, the first you knew there was a problem was when you went to move your arm?” Tony frowned, glancing up to meet Barnes’ eye. He realised that it was much easier to do that, when he was actually thinking about something else…
to think that maybe it was something like that – but you never said it. And what you
time he would be looking for something very specific - something he had good reason to think was in there, and something that seemed very likely to help.
He’d thought that Tony objected when he hadn’t told him about his parents because he had a right to know, because it’d been disrespectful and dangerous to keep to from him.
“Hi,” Steve grinned, stroking his hands up along Tony’s back. Telling himself,

And the funny thing was, that suggestion had slipped out so casually

It was an entirely different type of blow to anything Steve had prepared for, different to anything he’d previously lived through. Coming face-to-face with a Norse God or a horde of aliens or a mad titan was one thing. Learning that magic was real and that time travel was possible, yeah, that had certainly taken some time to process.
,” and he turned to sneer at Coulson, before he looked back at Pepper and promised, “if you just give me a couple of minutes, I can explain everything.”
Steve outright screamed, throwing himself forward in a desperate attempt to get to him. And then he heard Bucky gasp and stopped on instinct, turning just in time to see him drive his fist into the top of the examination table – breaking clear through the surface in a screech of tortured metal. Steve’s professional instincts kicked in and he immediately moved to contain the situation, running to get behind Bucky and pin both of his arms behind his back.
We’d never seen a gun! And…if it weren’t for my brother… My Dad was

And he couldn’t think of what else to do.
“Hang on, one minute Pepper,
it was important he looked at Tony.
Steve glanced up, his eyes still soft and unfocused, his brow slightly creased by the sheer effort of lifting his head. Tony’s giggle settled into a warm smile.
“It’s fine, we can handle that side of things” Steve assured her. “The real question is what we’re going to do with him once we’ve questioned him.”
what any of them thought of him. He’d never imagined the great Tony Stark giving a moment’s thought to Steve… not like… that…
Steve wouldn’t break, if Tony did that. He wouldn’t get hurt, or scared, or defensive…
...But still-
everything that Steve was so desperate to give him…
to take that pain away. It was an instinctive thing, a primal thing. More real and more important than anything else he might have to think about at the moment.
And then Steve threw one arm up so that he could grab a fistful of Tony’s hair, pulling Tony’s head up as he moved to suck a dark, purple mark to the side of his throat-
And it was
“He’s there… right now, with… Them?” Steve murmured, dazed, his eyes drifting into the distance, like he was talking to himself…

And if he’d given any thought whatsoever to the setting of his many detailed fantasies, he’d probably just assumed a generic black-tie gala, like the thousands he’d been to back on Earth…
But his brain
So, Tony arranged his expression into the appropriate level of welcoming interest, as Steve stood to attention beside him, and together they watched one of the children bravely step forward – an enormous glass bottle cradled awkwardly in both arms.
a bit like that” Possibly Trish carried on, defiantly “It’s like… a little, open meeting, and one of the staff goes through any announcements and a little run down of what’s going on that week – and they have other staff there, with, like, leaflets on stuff, and they answer questions-”
And then, like he was trying to prove that very point, Steve physically lifted Tony onto the countertop in one impatient thrust, his mouth still devouring Tony’s as he pushed himself closer, forcing Tony’s legs apart.
Steve woke up searching for Tony.
Tony considered Wesley for a moment longer, running through a final checklist before he gave a little nod of concession.
But her voice was just fading into the background.
There was the briefest flicker of panic, when he first caught sight of the daylight… which expanded into a gently buzzing nothingness, as he stepped out into the carpark. Like a comfortable buffer of numbness, which put his surroundings at a distance and softened the voices around him.
“...We both have,” Bucky conceded, softening only slightly before he carried on, “but the point still stands! The point is - I know you, Steve. And the reason you can’t answer all these questions is because they all have the

Just looking at him filled Tony with such a pure, perfect happiness that he couldn’t stand still. He had to find something to do with this sudden rush of feeling.
But he wasn’t nervous.
And Tony was
He couldn’t be completely confident that anything inhuman or supernatural had ever happened around Steve - or if Tony had just been having this irrational reaction to him, all along. If, maybe, Nick and Wesley had just been intimidated by Steve in a perfectly normal, human way. If Steve had simply lost his temper last night, or snapped under the pressure, as any person might.

He could just have easily found himself loitering in the parking lot of the Navy Hospital, or sitting on the wall outside Frank Fitzgerald’s bakery, or standing by the subway sign on Futon Street. It could have been any date between 1935 and 1943 - as long as it wasn’t snowing.
Steve felt his jaw tighten in indignation, that Scott should presume to know what Tony - or Nat - would think, that he felt he had any right to decide which sacrifices were worth it-
“And we were expecting Loki to turn up in, what, eight weeks anyway?” Tony prompted.
He opened his eyes, his whole body tensed and alert– and saw Tony looking up at the screens with a determined, inquisitive frown on his face.
...And that
portal that had led them here… and on the other side of it, the compound conference room, just… sitting there.
And such a primal excitement at ignoring it.
Seemingly out of nowhere, Steve found himself musing that this was the first time he’d ever been on Tony’s floor of the Tower. It was his first conscious thought since they’d left the hotel, and it had the same effect as when a teacher used to snap him out of a daydream with a question. Immediately, he scrambled to place where he was and what he’d missed - with no real urgency, at first.
“I’m trying to minimise the number of trips to the bar” Tony explained, when Steve raised an eyebrow at him. And, when Steve looked back, he saw that the woman was now bent over it-
“Well, in
“Honestly? I was expecting it to be nice,” Tony replied in a confessional tone,
just the nicest guy on earth that happened to walk in… But, whatever. At some point in the last few weeks I just started feeling differently about him. And that was… I don’t know. Probably going to be a problem anyway. I mean, even before last night, I was already thinking it was going to be hard to get over all this…”

Steve felt himself squeeze Tony’s hand.
“Well, he wasn’t really a talker,” Bucky remembered dryly. “He didn’t really tell me any of what he was doing… But I don’t remember him saying anything about installing anything…” And then he glanced over at Steve, for confirmation, and his eyes immediately widened in alarm.
“Nothing!” Tony exclaimed, throwing his arms out. “This one

Anni Vara.” And he expanded his arms, like he was preaching from a pulpit, glancing up to the sky before he carried on.
...But, there again, he couldn’t work out why he would be afraid of anything, and he was sure that he usually was.
Bucky barely stopped to catch his breath before he turned and ripped the back of the monitor clean away, silencing that incessant alarm. It was oddly comforting – for a moment Steve could convince himself that the connection was two way, that quieting the monitor would somehow slow his heart.
And he didn’t like the word.
Whether belonging to something, by definition, meant there had to be someone who didn’t belong. Whether there had to be
Well, they didn’t even
Steve swallowed a bitter taste, and tried to convince himself that it was a horrible idea…
Steve didn’t really know how he’d gotten lumbered with his own plan.
Rhodey didn’t ask him to explain that. He just said that he was there if Tony needed him, and that he’d be back again the following day… And Tony didn’t bother to argue. He could tell from the way that Rhodey said it that he’d be coming back anyway.
Something he couldn’t explain.

I should have told him all sorts of things, but I didn’t, because I just…
Bucky watched Steve fish his phone out his pocket with a weary sigh - which was such a familiar gesture that Bucky didn’t even notice it, at first.
There might even have been a few minutes in the middle there where Steve really was just taking an afternoon to himself, thinking about nothing deeper than the alien planet he was exploring-
, just there in his heart.
“Come, I’ll introduce you to the festival directors - they should be able to give you more of the details,” he suggested, pointing back toward the door he’d entered through. A prickle of anxiety ran up Tony’s spine, a physical resistance gathering between his shoulders…
It was an instinct that thoroughly confused him, but one he couldn’t deny anymore; he

Steve could see him thinking it, bracing for it-
that you’re sorry. Not even that you were sorry – that you were sorry my feelings were hurt. You were sorry I didn’t agree with you. That one line, in a whole letter, and never another word since. You just wanted to come home. So, of course, I said yes.”
“Okay, well, I think that’s as much as I can do on guess work” Tony exhaled, eventually, throwing his pen down with a flourish. “And it’s probably about that time….”
“Also, no more drugs for now” Tony added, as he landed a bit too heavily on the bench behind him.

, was a more fundamental thing. It was a
Steve’s throat was tight as he tried to swallow, his vision momentarily blotted out by the vividness of that mental image-
“No problem,” she smiled back. “Oh, and I got a call back from Sotheby’s by the way – apparently they don’t have a translation for the Baxter Book, so they can’t say one way or the other. But, honestly, I don’t think it’s going to get a lot of interest, so I think it might be worth picking it up anyway?”
He wouldn’t feel anything, if Steve were to give the full, long form apology that he’d spent the last seven years crafting… Steve might as well say it to anyone.
Being oversensitive and bad at love would do.
And, God, it was like dying. It was overwhelming, and all consuming, and he

Oh, the pleading little whimper Tony made,
right at that instinct that he hadn’t questioned in so long…
Tony paused.
“…You feel like dropping by to see Tony?”
“But, uh, last year, Agent Woo brought in this criminal gang that Scott Lang and his friends had apprehended – all of whom were under the influence of their own truth serum. Turns out, this guy, Sonny, I think? Had developed what is probably

“Jesus Tony…You are…just…” He struggled weakly, still trying to take it in. The sight of Tony lying there, open and exposed for him, the flawless expanse of his chest, his cock hard and leaking against his skin. Steve’s mouth literally watered. He couldn’t think of words enough- “Please, Tony, can I-”

Well, he knew that - for no apparent reason - he was deeply and personally irritated by that statement. But he’d intended to let it go. He’d expected to just let it go.
And stretched,

“God yes, please yes,” he begged, his voice hoarse. “I know I do, I’m sure I do, please-”

The fact that he wasn’t frightened or disgusted or confused by that request.
Steve dropped his eyes, and then pointedly focused his attention on unwrapping the binding around his knuckles.
And then Tony screwed up his face, and gave his head a little shake, clearly about to take that back and try again-
And he wondered… If, when they’d sat down to discuss The Accords… or ULTRON, or life after the fall of SHIELD, or…

And it made everything that much harder to take in, and it made the air around them feel thicker, and it might’ve been the reason that Tony felt slightly light-headed…
Steve felt his fingers curling into the fabric of Tony’s shirt, an unconscious desire to keep him, to stay in this moment.
.” Steve warned him, in an exasperated-but-affectionate voice. Then he turned back to the woman. “Sorry, do you mind just getting someone to help her, please?”
Tony froze, mid reach.
And Tony knew, in the moment, that he had a choice.

Steve’s heart had ached for Tony the entire time they’d been talking, to the point that now his ribs felt sore - and they hadn’t even gotten to the difficult part, yet.
in the end, he just shouted into the tape. Desperate to do something, anything to stop this.
Even though everything would probably be easier and smoother and calmer if he was high right now. Even though he knew that he’d be more confident and in control if he drank again, that he was guaranteed to feel good if he did that…
Steve remembered that he’d

at the edge of just-too-much.
If this had been an attempt to think about the issue as a whole, Steve would have run from it.

Every surface in the workshop had been covered with precarious stacks of paper, the floor was littered with empty file boxes and the air was alive with hologram screens, layered one on top of the other. It took a second for Steve to sort it all into any kind of sense, by which time Tony had already called out to him,
him,” Steve clarified, turning his attention back to the carton of Chinese, just so that he could look away from them. “I’m just saying, having met him briefly… No, none of the really wild rumours are true.” And out of the corner of his eye he saw them share a conspiratorial little glance.
Thinking of everyone watching this, imagining what they could see-
And then he thought of the letter that he had left next to Steve’s bed.
And he looked up at Tony, and they shared a sigh, and a shrug. A silent gesture of understanding… an understanding they’d never once spoken out loud. One of the bonds they’d

“Er, well, we haven’t talked about it, or anything” Tony answered Janine, his eyes still fixed on Steve.
...More than anything, it was his job to
However strange Steve’s existence, however many extraordinary things he’d had to find a way to understand, there had always been a consistent reality they existed within. The had always been an unspoken line between the sublime and a ridiculous, a shared understanding of what was possible-
, what he’d really meant was that he didn’t expect it to mean anything to Steve. Tony had – rather sensibly – warned himself, before he did this, that Steve would not react the way he did in Tony fantasies. In fact, part of the reason Tony felt so confident in doing it was that, at the start, he’d been completely sure that Steve would just shrug it off. That he wasn’t actually asking anything more of Steve than a few moments indulgence, to just sit there and listen to a diatribe he didn’t agree with or care about, because it might make Tony feel better.
In a weird sort of way, it might even have been fun. Steve had never had someone to rush home to before. He’d never had a new boyfriend to be excited over… Part of him enjoyed the novelty of it. The feeling of being included in the world. Knowing that it would be that much better, for how much he wanted it…
a big deal-”
“Yeah, I’m okay,” he smiled – meaning it, this time. Steve smiled back, and kissed his forehead, and brought Tony’s head to rest on his shoulder again.

“I’m proud of you, you know,” she told him, softly.
Or rather,
And he threw the shirt aside, and manoeuvred Steve’s wrists into the cuffs again, so easily – Steve lying his arms out and flattening his hands and doing everything he could to comply with this… willing…
Steve knew his comfort on that one should have been how well he’d prepared for it. The fact that he’d bothered to write instructions and mailing lists for all the right people, that he’d plotted all their next moves for them. That he’d already written back up plans for his back up plans, if anyone dropped the ball. That he already knew exactly what sort of system he was going to build in the next few months, regardless of what happened right now.
But not ‘I love you.’

issues that I need to work on, for both of us… But, I promise, I’m going to treat you better. Even those things you don’t expect of me and wouldn’t ask of me – because you deserve it. You deserve a lot more than you’ve ever expected, and I love you, and I’m going to do it anyway. So there.”
Steve’s head swam, his vision sparkling as that first jolt spread out through his liquid muscles-
When he’d first remembered that the cult in Florence existed, and realised all the uncomfortable parallels.
“So...Freddie?” Tony clarified, as he walked over to perch on the arm of Sam’s couch.
“My beautiful Steve,” Tony whispered, his voice tightening, that control beginning to fray at the edges,
And then he told them, simply,

even. Something that he’d felt able to put into context and consider as though it was actually a reasonable,
He simply hadn’t prepared himself for relief like that - it hit him like a physical blow to the gut.
Tony talked about Steve sometimes… It made Tony feel like a part of Steve. It made Tony feel more like home…
Steve felt a little frisson of excitement run through him; he warned himself, in vain, not to get his hopes up…

from the top of the pile and opened it to the first page, his mind filling up with things he would have liked to yell at him…
And that made certain parts of this clear.
So, when he could put it off no longer, Steve showered, and dressed, and drank yet more coffee – and headed down to the breakroom. Thinking that Bucky would’ve finished his workout by now, and would be either lounging in the easy chair or trying to trick Sam out of it-
And, if he’d had to, Tony
. Maybe one day he’d get used to not being around Steve, and get himself out of the habit of thinking of him all the time, and not mind when Steve left him out of things - or not think about it at all. Maybe one day Tony would want to be happy with someone else, doing something else.
Steve knew that Tony had just hit on something difficult, that he’d realised he didn’t want to talk about this, or couldn’t… Steve

Which would probably explain why Bucky was shirtless, now that Tony thought about it..
The faintly amused observation that it would be really silly to say it out loud, that – if he was in his right mind – he should be outraged at himself for doing this…
And he felt as though he already knew that - that he
Steve gave his head a shake, and let go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He really had to get a grip. He reminded himself that he was actually supposed to be back up on a serious mission, not thinking the thoughts of someone sitting alone in a bar – and weird, self-indulgent thoughts, at that.
There was a distinctly defiant edge on Tony’s brow now, like he wasn’t waiting for an answer so much as challenging Steve to find one.
And remembered that Tony was on the other side of it, still sleeping on the couch…
And he wanted Steve’s blood.
And then the door opened – and they both jumped.
to watch you let go, Steve,” he whispered, as he very gradually worked his way down Steve’s shirt, exploring his body as he undressed him, tracing his fingers over the contours of his muscles, working his palms against his skin. “I want to watch you
Tony snorted another laugh - cut off by a bark of alarm as Peter took another bold step forward.
“Fuck…” Steve breathed, letting his head fall back again, as the heat of Tony’s mouth melted against the shock of cold on his skin, little tingles running down through his legs. The pressure in his hips began to ache, his cock burning against the cool evening air as Tony worked his way lower – too far gone to be as gradual and teasing as Steve had been. He lapped greedily over Steve’s stomach, his tongue rough and demanding, his hands pressing hard against Steve’s thighs. “
He was furious at everyone who’d helped bring this nightmare back into the world. He was aghast and outraged at the thousands of people who’d accepted and defended this project. He thought of all the people who had worked on the Tesseract,

pretty quickly supported his decision to become Iron Man, however crazy she thought it was - she’d even helped him risk his life to save the day, on occasion. She had, in fact, never put any limitations or judgements on the way Tony lived his life until the point he asked her to share it with him… Until the point that his life choices directly impacted hers. Which was, of course, fair enough - but it was also what pushed them apart in the end. The fact that Tony simply couldn’t allow someone to act as his better judgement, no matter now reasonable their input, no matter their right to try… No matter how much he wanted to. He realised now that he could have made any number of concessions for Pepper, but he couldn’t let her keep trying to
There was just no grey area left to hide in, no narrative subtlety for him to exploit. No possible way to pretend that he hadn’t been
“Did Nat ever tell you why she was so interested in it?” Tony frowned, finally taking a sip of his coffee.
The things that were missing from every recreation of this world, even the ones in his memories.
Now, rather than spiralling through undefined panics, Tony could begin working out the source and function of these new instincts. The question of ‘what was going to happen’ was no longer a rhetorical expression of fear.
never forgive myself - because I actually knew that was going to happen. And I could have stopped it. And, if you’d just let me help you, I know we could put a plan together, and get every piece of tech we could possibly need, and board a private plan by this time tomorrow - we could bring him home with us tomorrow night. So,” he finished, with a shrug.
And it was the tone that stopped Steve, more than anything. He was sort of operating on that instinctive, animalistic level now, responding to basic human cues.
“Tony?”
Steve didn’t think it in words, exactly – but the instinct was unmistakable. He’d had the

A cool tingling began to gather underneath Steve's skin.
“...Especially if we were the
He could hear him pacing, his bare feet occasionally padding past the bedroom door on his erratic tours of the suite – Steve could picture him doing it. Walking in sharp, jagged patterns, gesticulating as though he was explaining the theories to an audience in his head. Sometimes running his one hand through his hair, so that it all cascaded into his eyes again…
To just have fun with him like this.
Steve let a stream of nonsensical noises fall over his lips, as he dropped his head and tried to rock against Tony’s mouth. He grabbed a hold of the duvet in two white knuckled fists, as pulse after pulse of warm, urgent pleasure surged through him.
He wanted to tell Steve to just keep talking, that this whole area of discussion was captivating and thought-provoking and
“Oh, you needn’t worry - these are designed as ‘testing samples’” Dr Arden placated. “The effects are quite mild, and quite short lived. And the flowers can’t cause you any harm of any kind.”
But he just kept imagining Tony screaming at him, asking him what the hell he was thinking or telling him he was out of his mind.
And he wanted what they had right now to last forever - he
“I’m full of surprises,” Steve blurted a response entirely at random… and then, when he realised how cringey it sounded, hastily added. “The trick is to appear very, very boring.”

Every one of those moments had ripped the very soul out of him, left him shaking and panting pointlessly for air-
And he laughed.
A cold punch of dread hit him right below the ribs, powerful enough to clear the fog from his mind-
But that had started to sound more and more ridiculous, as his initial high had eased into that familiar desire to be around Tony - which wasn’t even one of those new, physical impulses. This time, it was just because he liked being in Tony’s company. Because Tony had always been the welcome distraction, the thing to look forward to, the thing that mattered… Because Steve already missed him.

“So… we go to the third floor, we get to…
He thought of stepping out of that elevator instead, grabbing Tony with both hands and pulling him hard against his chest.
Which didn’t give Bucky pause. He simply dug the fingertips of his enhanced arm into the metal, and yanked the door free of its hinges.

“All the time.” Steve surrendered, when he couldn’t come up with a specific example. Just the general feeling that, “You’re probably the funniest person I ever met”
“You know, one of the things I’ve thought about all this is that… in some ways, it makes me more vulnerable,” he said, carefully. “There was a moment, back at that warehouse, when I was trying to think of ways to stop them from taking my blood… And I thought of the power they had over me now, that fear I have now that I didn’t have before. A way they had to hurt me, that wouldn’t have hurt me at all, a few weeks ago… And I think I actually like that,” he confessed, to himself as much as to Tony. “I don’t know, I think I figured out recently that ‘not having weaknesses’ really just means not caring about anything. Telling yourself you’ll survive any loss and get through every struggle, all on your own if you have to… it just means you don’t really have anything that matters that much. That… Actually, you have to like yourself, and think you matter as a person, to think your fears and priorities have a value, that they can be taken into account. And when you say they

It was soothed now, though.
He knew that Steve had never been allowed to let go like this - that he longed for it and struggled with it in equal measure.

“I surprised you?” Rhodey repeated, narrowing his eyes. When Tony just shrugged at him, he was forced to guess, “you been up all night?”
“Okay, if we live through this thing, you’re really going to have to tell me that story” Tony replied, glancing up at him and raising an eyebrow-
essentially gotten Steve drunk…
But suddenly Steve realised – none of that mattered.
Tony pressed his body against Steve’s, barely breaking the kiss as he pushed Steve onto his back and crawled on top of him, Steve’s hips pinned between his knees. And then he pressed himself up on his arms, so that he could look down on Steve.
This was the first time he’d felt truly alive since 1945.
He was happy –

And then Steve felt Tony shiver, as a cool breeze rolled over the garden. He broke the kiss, letting Tony shift so that he could sit more comfortably in his lap while he made an awkward lean for his jacket-
And it probably wouldn’t have occurred to him to wonder… How anyone

“That’s none of your business,” Steve informed him, taking a moment to enjoy the way Nick shrank back from him, before he explained again, “the point is, I need to see
With a sharp intake of breath he turned away from the chaos in his workshop, shutting the lights down with a wave of his hand as he strode wearily to the elevator
Then he leant down to kiss Steve again – pinning his arms above his head as he did it.
And then he looked at Tony. His eyes blown wide, his lashes wet with tears he was trying to hold back, his lips flushed dark red and slightly parted. His body held so firm, even though his breathing was shaking.
without Tony - that the hypothetical fear of losing him in that bunker was a thing of the past. “Oh, God, I love you-”
His investigation into his fathers past had drifted down his list of priorities, recently. Probably because, if he was honest, he was only ever using it as a way to feel close to Steve - his interest had waned in direct proportion to how much time he and Steve spent together in real life.
“Depends what you mean by difficult…” Steve muttered. Tony raised his eyebrows in a friendly, questioning gesture – and, even though it would be a tedious topic of conversation, Steve grabbed at it with both hands. “We have to meet with the new Washington liaison. He wants to talk to us about

“One verbal communication over a civilian phone line,” Nick sighed. “So, we can’t be sure they were free to talk… But, best we can guess, someone is using a kind-of illegal hotel as a base for a more illegal operation – we don’t know if the people at the hotel are involved, or even if they know…” And then he cleared his throat, which Steve knew was a bad sign… “And, unless it was meant to be a code for something, it seems like the place only accepts reservations from couples. Seeing as our agents didn’t know that before they arrived, that might be what got them caught.”
And then Tony thrust into him, hard.
“So, I dunno… maybe what I’m about to say won’t mean anything to you,” Bucky shrugged – somehow not coming over quite as casual as he should be… “Maybe it doesn’t
But there was just an inch of relief, realising that no one was going to take his blood
And then, without another word, he stepped aside and gestured into the house.
The elevator came to a soft stop beneath their feet and the doors slid open. Bucky strode out, confidently… and Steve hesitated for maybe half a second. Just enough time to tell himself he was being ridiculous.

wanted this. All of this.
This wasn’t a complicated mix of hurt and love and longing and loss that had been given voice by a drug.
Tony had never looked lovelier than he did right now; Steve had never felt closer to him.
And, again, it wasn’t Thor’s fault that Steve took it so badly. It was clear that he meant it to be comforting - and, in his defence, at any other moment, it might have worked.
And now that he knew that, his brain jumped in to keep up. A human instinct to place this emotion, now that he’d named it. He

asked himself why he was being an ass…
“Woah, is that… safe?” Steve asked, before he could stop himself. His shoulders already bracing, in case he had to pull Tony away.
And a separate, primal instinct that was thoroughly confused by Steve not being here. A low, aching emptiness…

Somehow, Steve knew that revelation would persist, even after his temper had worn off - like his optimism had prevailed in spite of his temper, the last time.

He thought of Tony’s hand on the side of his face, his thumb tracing his jaw so tenderly as he teased his lips apart-
He believed this more than he believed in anything.
And he thought of himself… not
“Oh, I’m sorry” She winced, “It’s invitation only, I’m afraid – safety reasons”
The fact that he didn’t know what a life with Steve would look like, if he was up to it, if there was any way he could make Steve happy…
It was only when Tony heard himself ask that last question that he realised how hurt he was that Steve had kept this from him. And not only because it might’ve made so much difference if he’d known all of this, not just because he felt he had a right to know… Mostly, it was because he thought that he and Steve were closer than that.
that looked exhausted - even though he hadn’t asked nearly as many questions as Steve was expecting, or really said very much at all…
And Tony meant that. Tony felt good for saying that.
And, God, the only reason Tony didn’t say that out loud was because he

He only briefly tensed when he felt the caress of damp cloth against his neck. Relaxing against it before he worked out what Tony was doing, for no other reason than it was Tony doing it.

“Did you pick this house because of this bed?” Steve wondered aloud, thinking that it would have been a very touching attention to detail-
He dropped his head and pinched his mouth shut, trying to dull the sensation before it erupted into a full on laughing fit-
He told himself to be as careful as he could be, to

– lie to Tony, right now.
“You have literally no concept of how much paperwork there would be, if anyone saw a frost-bitten Captain America standing on my roof,” he sighed. And then there was a pause. “So, when are they coming back for you?”
– his reckless, emotional plan today hadn’t been the healthiest way to step out of his previous mindset… but it could still be good that he’d done it.
He wanted to tell Bucky his story – or, at least, that still seemed like the obvious thing to do. To share his experience, to talk about the feelings they had in common, to pass on some of the things he’d learned… That

him. Being a part of this very human moment, no matter how distantly.
And all the while, Steve had carried on trading jokes with him, and accepting his hopeful invitations, and casually lying about what he’d been doing at the weekend, and dismissing Tony when he asked what was wrong with him lately…
It had been quite a few weeks since Steve had last stormed into his room like this, but still, he immediately knew that sound-
His hands still braced against Steve’s legs, Tony dropped his head and took the length of Steve’s cock into his mouth.

I tried to move it. Then the pain.”
And he couldn’t see any imminent danger from Peirce. He couldn’t think of any threat that couldn’t wait until after he’d left the room and better assessed the situation.
All of that still hurt so much that it kept him awake at night. There were times when it could hit him out of nowhere, stop him in his tracks and force him to deal with the imminent threat of tears…
Steve smiles, sardonic and cold. “You’d think a soldier would love poker, but see, I didn’t grow up as a soldier. I grew up as a sick kid. Chess was always my game.”
Sighing Steve watches Tony exit and stands in the middle of the still projected night beach scene. “JARVIS, stop projection.” The images fade and the main living room of the prince’s quarters come in focus. He should rest and eat. He opens his robe and checks the area on his abdomen where Rumlow hit him with the bully stick. It’s not bad, only a minor bruise. He’s had worse.
Steve huffs. “Of course not. So you can parade me around and show off that I’m not your class. No thank you.”
“You might want to come down, Bucky’s a mess.”
Tony only grumbles and bends forward. The gaunt look of his face from before would be welcome now, because death looks as if it has taken hold. The tiny door to the device swings open on his chest. Drools streams out of his mouth and he makes tiny whimpering noises.
“I left my horse to get shod, Bucky, that’s all.”
“What did he say? What did you agree on?” Tony asks because the glare that Raza offers Steve isn’t just predator like – it’s reminiscent of a predator that enjoys the hunt, playing with its food. Something screams inside of Tony. “What did you agree on?”
Tony heaves Steve to him and sucks against his neck, biting and suckling. It makes Steve moan in response and he wants more so he leans into it like a beggar at the feast. It’s ridiculous really to think about, Steve has a clientele. This is his job but the feel of the prince against him, the rough touch of his beard causes Steve to want to break every vow he’s ever made. Tony’s hand cups his face and pulls him away for a moment, his focus briefly going to Steve’s mouth and then back to his eyes. Steve doesn’t deny him. Tony plunges forward, knocking them down onto the floor as he tastes and explores Steve’s mouth.
Steve lifts a shoulder. “Not a lot of people dream about being a sex worker as a child. Things happened. The war for one. Back in the Brooklyn settlement there’s not much left due to lack of resources. I trained because I wanted to be an Artist in Residence – well, that was my big dream.”
Steve looked to the window, the old lace curtain his mother hung only weeks before her death. “I wish too.” It was barely audible.
For a moment Bruce turned to stone, but then he exhaled a heavy breath. “Just try not to alert the other guy.”
“You wore them for four hours and 39 minutes,” Pepper whispers as if it hurts her to admit the time.
“What does the therapist say?” Steve brushes back Tony’s hair as it curls in the humidity of the warm bath.
Steve laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and then stroked downward to his chest, to his nipple. When Tony hitched a breath at the touch of his nipple, Steve glanced at him and smiled. He leaned forward and kissed, flicking the nib with his tongue. Tony ran his hands through Steve’s hair holding him in place, loving the touch. For a second, Steve paused and said, “Good?”
“Interesting concept. Not sure Obie would like it. But it is something to consider.”
“I could be drinking a coffee.”
Steve’s senses go on high alert. “What’s happening?” he asks.  Tony only waves for him to be quiet.
“Also, very toxic. He ended up with burns over 30% of his body and his lungs trashed because of it when there was an accident. He didn’t make it. I was only a little over 6 months at the time. Don’t remember any of it.” The tastes the salmon and his mouth waters for more. “Ruined my ma’s lungs too. She could barely work after that. We had to move from the guardsmen installation to the colony proper. That meant we transferred to a tenement apartment with 12 other families.”
Tony sets the toy on his pillow, wipes away the tears from his eyes, stands up from the bed. He straightens his jacket and heads to his workshop, he knows what he has to do. It might be consider by some as a lark, a fool’s move, but Tony’s life has been plagued by foolishness. For the first time, he knows what he needs to do, and while the world may judge him as reckless, in his heart of heart’s he hears a whisper. It’s something, a need to do, if he doesn’t he might as well rip the arc reactor out of his chest now, and wait for the shrapnel to pierce his heart.
“You know it’s funny you think you have the upper hand since my arm is at your throat,” Steve growls at him.
In seconds, Jarvis answers, “Yes, sir?”
Steve licked his lips. He’d never truly thought about it. Introspection wasn’t one of his hobbies. He’d rather keep busy, do the mission, make himself useful. “I don’t know? I mean I was attracted to Peggy, but-.” He never really considered it, before now.
He squeezed his eyes closed, trying not to imagine how they died. It was hard enough with an accident; murder was a whole different story. With his eyes closed he thought about their deaths, how it must have been, and then through the chords of the pack – a distant pain sounded. A pain so bright and singular it startled him. The purity of the sorrow and the loss of something – the loss of self – dug into him and hollowed out his bones.
“So that your secret recipe?”
“No, I don’t,” Steve said, and Tony felt the truth of his statement ring through the bonds. “I know this is the right thing to do.”
CHAPTER 7
“I didn’t say that, Tony. This isn’t just about the Board or the media. It’s about you and what makes you happy. When you came home from your last disappearance with a husband, I thought you’d lost it, but then I saw you.” Pepper giggles a little as if she’s keeping a secret. “And you looked at him so sweetly, so much in love.”
“That makes no sense. There are no alphas out there,” Tony says and he’s not happy to be lied to. He could easily activate the collar, it activates on his voice commands. He hesitates. “Truly?”
“Tony?”
“It’s brilliant.”
“How?”
“That’s true,” Shuri said and folded her hands in front of her. The sunlight from the windows set the orange tunic she wore with its dazzling embroidery to a fiery glow. Steve looked at Tony, and at the others, and wondered about their safety. Shuri read him. “In Wakanda we do everything to ensure the safety of our vampire population. The windows are embedded with a nanotechnology that prevents the vampires from being weakened by the sun’s rays.”
“How’s that?” Bruce leaned against the lab bench and waited as JARVIS explained.
“Where?” he asked.
“We – we,” Steve says and spins around looking at the display as Tony wipes it out of existence. “What’s this?”
When Sam and Steve took the elevator to the conference floor, Steve found himself jittery and nervous. He felt like he stepped back into those 1940s draft rooms, trying to get someone to allow him into the Army. Sam raised a brow at him and smiled. It wasn’t something that Steve could interpret on the best of days. Entering the conference room floor, Steve surveyed his surroundings. It surprised him. Nothing about it felt like a conference room, not like the SHIELD rooms or the briefing rooms he sat in during his time in the Army. This was something different entirely. It looked more like a living room but with a large low sitting table in the center that had a round half globe set in the middle of it. It was all chrome and glass with comfortable orange leather chairs spaced around the center table. Tony already sat in one of the orange chairs as did Bruce. Next to Bruce was Natasha who Steve greeted with a hug and a slight kiss to her cheek. It was good to see her again even though her soul bled a kind of loss to him.
Turning to the mountains, Steve smiles. “Yes, it is.”
“And Blu?” Jarvis reached a hand and Tony gave the toy to him. “What will you do with him?”
Steve gritted his teeth against the strain but asked, “Then what changed? Why this? Why did you betray Natasha?” Or was he ever mated? Natasha would know the difference, wouldn’t she? It made no sense to think she wouldn’t.
Tony hesitates, but Steve leaves him behind to stalk down the hillside to the Hulk. It’s not suicide, but it’s damned near close. Hulk turning Steve into a pretzel becomes a distinct possibility. It’ll hurt, but probably won’t be permanent – or at least they think nothing in here can really hurt them. Why does it hurt at all? Why are there injuries at all. It’s a mystery he doesn’t have time to solve.  He hears Tony cursing at him from behind, but troops down the path like a good soldier. At the very least, he can be a good soldier for Tony. If he can be nothing more to Tony than a pawn in a game, that will be enough.
Blu licks his lips and then bends down, carefully clenching his jaws around the armor. He manages to hold a large chunk of it. Tony pulls the rest into his arms, his wrist aching and his ribs on fire. He needs to get help soon. Trudging up the hillside, hauling heavy metal alloy pieces doesn’t help much. By the time they get to the shelter of the overhang that Tony indicated, he drops to his knees and the armor clatters to the hard ground. His breath comes in shallow pants. It hurts to breathe. Blu sidles up to him and licks his face.
Sam drank down his smoothie. “You tell me. But really, I think you’re the luckiest guy in the world. You already know. The rest of us poor shmucks? We have no idea. We have to fumble around in the dark. Really, you’re lucky.”
The ship approaches the drop site. He doesn’t look out the port windows as a mix of rain and snow batters the sides of the hull. If he had been a Jedi, someone would comment on his focus, his determination. But he’s not a Jedi – never was, never will be. His mission, his focus zeroes in on one of the lost Jedi. He keeps his eyes ahead and he stands and sways with the maneuvering of the ship as it closes in on the target. Clutching onto strap attached to the rail of the hull and holding firm, Bucky bites back his fears. He might not be a Jedi, but he’s learned a thing or two from being at the Sacred Archive.
Steve gets up and helps Tony onto the bed properly. He disrobes in front of Tony and then sidles up to him in the bed. They silently touch and explore one another. It’s a small thing and after Steve heated him so much, Tony’s not sure he wants to wait, but it’s something that Steve needs. He’s always been so cognizant of his strength and his power – that it frightens him. Tony’s tried to calm him, comfort him about it, but the nightmares he has about his time as a beast always come back, always terrorize him.
“Oh, I-.” Tony jolts to consciousness. “Yeah, sure. I’ll pick something out.”
“Really?”
“Don’t think about it, it’s not a sin to love,” Tony says and Steve relaxes against him, easing his body so that Tony has access. Suddenly, Steve’s lying against the pillows, the wires and mechanical toys, and other tools have been swept away. Tony’s intent and dark over him like a shadow encompassing him.
Tony tries to escape the hurt.
The edges of Steve’s vision blacken as he gasps for air that he cannot get. The blunt end of the alpha’s cock slams against the back of Steve’s throat and his eyes are watering. Alpha groans and the brutality of his thrusts throws Steve into a burning heat, his own cock so heavy between his legs, so wanting for a hand on it, that he doesn’t listen to the alpha. He grabs for his cock and his hand feels foreign. He jerks at himself, over and over as a twilight overcomes him, as the shade of losing consciousness. He doesn’t listen to the alpha over him, growling, telling him to stop – Steve closes his eyes and as the cock in his mouth chokes him, he orgasms and he cannot hold it back even as he loses himself.
That seemed vague enough. He closed the connection and rolled his eyes. Nat would laugh at him – she was right. He had no idea how to lie. Without further delay, he put his helmet back on and started the engine of his motorcycle. A few hours on the road might help to clear his head.
“I want to, I thought,” Steve started and then blurted it out. “I pretended for so long. Even to myself. I pretended it was because of my size and my illness that I wasn’t attracted. I pretended it was because of the war. I even pretend now. I lie to myself that I can’t find anyone because of shared life experiences. It’s a nice lie that secures me and I don’t have to face the fact.”
“I hope you’ll make sure I don’t dance us off the cliff,” Tony says as he places Steve’s one hand around his waist and the other in his hand. “You need to learn how to lead.”
“It had a ton-?” Pepper said, and her pale skin colored a shade of green.
“Hmm, that’s nice.” It feels a little intoxicating, as if he’s floating in a quiet pool. “Where’d you learn to do this.” His voice feels very far away.
“Do you think we could break for a bit?” Steve asks. Even his voice sounds tired.
“If I was something else, would you love me still?”
“An alpha – male is good. I want the knot,” Steve says and cannot stand how his voice seems to tremble. He clears his throat and tries again. “I require the knot.”
“Don’t worry about it. It’s not like I have to pay for it. Besides you need a phone to keep you up to date with your studies.” They had started to call Steve’s time learning everything about modern life as his ‘studies’.
Tony swallowed down the need to vomit and then swung downward in front of his enemy. The pain and memories blinded him as he slammed down in front of them – Hydra. The oncoming guards meant nothing to him as he raised the repulsors.
Steve sniggers. “I think I better get going now, Scott. Thanks for nothing.”
This was a stand alone story that I posted as a WIP. Eventually I deleted the story because of lack of interest on the readers part and my waning interest in finishing it as well. Some people asked if they could have a copy of it, so here it is. My attempt at a Western.
The man steps in front of him to block his view and only then does it occur to him that the man has spoken. He uses the remote - something like the color television that's all too unknown to him - and turns down the volume. He doesn't turn it off. He wants to see the pictures.
“How much longer?”
“Glad you are alive.” Steve pushes the bedrail down and climbs out of bed. He wobbles on his feet and that’s a tell tale sign that he’s hungry and weak. He pulls off all the monitoring wires that Bruce begged him not to and then goes to Tony’s bed. The rail is down in an instant and he crawls into bed with him. It’s a tight squeeze but it’s about right. Tony situates himself on top of Steve and they doze.
“I’m not sure what you mean.” Tony peered over his shoulder at the house. It was a home, a place of comfort and memories. He wondered if he would ever get that – if he ever wanted it. Maybe – once with Pepper- but now that felt a million miles away.
Tony translated for Steve. “It seems my newly changed Divini blood infected you and you’re changed now. We don’t know how but you’re not exactly who you were before.” Something dark shadowed Tony’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s none of your damned business,” Steve says but before he can say anything else Rumlow’s pulled out his bully stick and flips the switch. A crackle pierces the air. It’s a shock rod.
He laughs and then settles next to her in a straight backed chair. "You always could see right through me."
“Don’t give me that look, I’m not crazy,” Steve says. “His son or nephew or something, Tiberius. He’s Tony’s intended. Tiberius Stane.”
The monitors had wailed in protest as both Steve and Tony experienced increased heart rates, blood pressures, and oxygen use. At one point, the situation disintegrated, and Cho strapped on a nasal cannula for Stark to offer him straight oxygen. Thankfully, things settled down and their vitals went back to normal.
None of it makes any sense. A jumble of words – of letters mixed together in a soup and red with blood. He blinks and knows he faded out because the pretend doctor is no longer there. Only the lion.
Steve never hesitated. He slipped his arm around Tony’s shoulders and then bent and brought the other one under his knees. In seconds, Steve cradled him like a baby or a new bride. With fast steps Steve went up the narrow staircase, never bashing Tony’s head on the walls or the railing. Tony would have blushed – had he had the capability to do so. Steve brought him into their usual room when they were at this particular coven flop house. This was Tony’s officially assigned house according to the Vampire Registry kept by the V-Corps. Of course, his conclave kept it as a front and Tony actually lived elsewhere.  Vampires couldn’t own property, the dead had little legal rights, owning property wasn’t one of them. It just wasn’t allowed.
“Sure do,” Steve says and guns the engine. “This is going to be wild. Ready?”
Even though Steve had taken a hired car out to the wreckage site, Tony decided to offer him a way home. “Come on, I’ve give you a lift.” Tony pointed to his boot. “Step on the boot. There’s a hand hold on the opposite shoulder. Grab it.”
Tony bent forward and grabbed the tablet.
“Looks like we’re getting the gang back together again,” Steve says. “Stark taking the Commando to the Lemurian Star.”
“What we’ll do on the date?” Tony snickers.
He blinked and managed to get a feel for his surroundings. He recognized an interrogation room where they brought the co-conspirators and traitors to the Department of Human Security. He’d only been in the cell once – a long time ago when he’d first woken from the ice. They’d taken him on a tour of the Triskelion down into the bowels of hell. They showed him, in fine display, the things they did to humans who would act treasonously to their own kind. Then they escorted him to the upper levels, to the roof where they splayed out vampires, cruciform to flay and waste away in the sunlight. They had been accused of mating with the humans locked in the prisons in the sub-basement. One of them had been a young woman, maybe nineteen or twenty. She could barely lift her head as they stood there, watching the skin peel away from her weakened body under the sun’s harsh rays, witnessing how her body deprived of blood and darkness decomposed as she rotted still alive on the cross. She’d begged him for help, her pleas quiet and desperate. He shook as he stood there with the uniform on and his life just starting in this century. The star on his chest blazed silver in the day and it felt like it burnt a hole straight through his sternum and into his heart.
“Let’s move this to the couch at least.” Logan points to the ratty sofa Tony saved from his graduate school days. “That way if he falls over, he won’t give himself a concussion on top of other brain damage.”
"Don't worry Obie, it's just a bit of fun. It's just something to distract me so I can refresh, you know let the subconscious work on the problem." He taps his temple and smirks.
“Take care.”
Tony closed the small distance between them and clasped Steve’s shoulders, rubbing them. “For me, you were always more than just a caretaker and a meal. You were and always will be my love.” His eyes – those eyes so strange and alien – never left Steve’s gaze. Tony implored him with those eyes – red and gold glinting in the filtered sunlight. “Always.”
“What about the shields?” Bucky says as the ship creaks and sputters in the air.
A stream of curses erupts out of Tony, but at the same time he begs for Steve to stop him. “Fuck, fuck! I fucking can’t take it. God damn it to hell and back. Don’t, Steve. Don’t fucking let me come. You fucking devil.”
“Yeah. Working late.”
Shaking out his hand, he thanks Bucky for the lessons and watches as spurts of blood run down Rumlow’s face.
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs, dropping his hand he sits up. “Did he say what it’s about?”
“Sir, I wanted to apologize.”
“Got it.”
He steps up to the dented chipped door and knocks trying to settle his stomach. After a few minutes, the door across the hallway opens and a red head peeks out. She looks like a dream and he has no idea why someone with her classical beauty would end up in a place one door over from hell. She mutters something in what he thinks is Russian and then in broken English says, "Not home. Steve out for night."
“Mister Stark-.”
“Come on then,” Tony says and grips Steve’s upper arm again, waiting for him to lead the way.
“You’re not my mother, Steve. Or my caretaker. I don’t need one.”  Tony hears a chair being dragged across the hardwood floor. “Careful with the floor. I just had it refinished.”
“Something like that,” Bruce replied and sank down on one of the chairs tucked into the desk at the side of the laboratory. He looked spent, like whatever had happened took him by surprise and taking a bath had been his attempt to wash away the after effects.
Assembling the sandwiches, Steve keeps his eyes lowered as he speaks, “It wasn’t about opportunities. It was about feelings.”
"What's not fit?" He can't believe he is asking her this. It doesn't seem possible. Does he ask if Steve Rogers was a known sex worker back in the day? Would she even know something like that? Maybe he’s a clone?
Those words chill him. The Soul Keeper once discovered him asking questions of the servants about the demons and where the come from and why they are growing in numbers. The Soul Keeper forced him to spend the night in the forest. It turned cold that night, frigid and icy. He’d nearly died. Or so he thought.
“Not in the least,” Strange said and settled to sit down next to Steve at the conference table. His eyes were like gems, faceted, sharp, almost cruel in their intent. He glanced around the room as if scrutinizing them all. “None of you were set aside outside the time loop so you would not know. The world is different, so very different now.”
