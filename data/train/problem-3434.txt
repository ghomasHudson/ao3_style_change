“The animals…” Sam says.
“You’ve been praying to Cas?” Sam asks. Dean flinches.
“SAM. Sam, wake up.” Sam breaths in through his teeth as he jolts upright, squinting at his surroundings, disorientated.
“I’m serious,” Sam continues. “Charlie told me she’s working a case nearby, maybe she can come down after and spend some time here.”
“Look,” Dean continues. “I’ll just talk to the girls' friends, see if any of them have information. Easy.”
“I thought you were gone, man, for real,” Dean says, cupping the back of Cas’ head with his hands. “I thought I wouldn’t ever get the chance-”
“He’s been alive this whole time, and you didn’t think to tell us?” Dean grunts.
“Dean, I’m so sorry. Are you okay?” Eileen asks.
“There have always been guys on cases, who treated me... differently,” Dean explains. “Good looking guys, too. I used to think that what I felt was disgust - this rush of dread, this sick feeling in my stomach. But I think that was fear.”
“I feel the same way,” Sam says. “But that’s not what I mean.”
“I heard he’s a felon. On the run from the law,” the younger man whispers.
“We need something earthly, something to repel them,” Cas says, gashing through the empty that’s trapped Sam. “Blood, Dean. Human blood. Do it.”
“Where’d Sam go?”
“The Ford is better for the kids,” Jason replies. “Plus my husband wanted something that’s better for the environment. As nice as those old cars look, they're definitely gas guzzling.”
“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Sam softly says to Dean. Dr. Khan presses a button by the bed, calling a nurse.
Dean heads to the back door, rolling over Olivia’s toes on his way. She whimpers. Sam looks her over with a mixture of sympathy and contempt. He opens his mouth to speak, his instincts telling him to comfort her. He decides against it, and follows Dean out.
“Thank you,” Dean sputters. “If I could have a moment alone with my partner.”
“What exactly is he getting?”
“And then, I don’t know,” Castiel replies. He looks back at Dean. “I had a plan, before, but things are much more complicated now.”
“Special -” Sam starts, lifting up his badge.
“You’re supposed to be dead,” Jessica says.
“Yeah, he’s dead,” Dean says breathlessly.
“What corrupted the file?” Dean asks.
“A week isn’t that long,” Dean replies.
“It’s hard to explain. I just - I’ll show you. Come here,” she says. They waddle towards her. “Closer. C’mon. I don’t bite.” Jessica wraps her arms around them.
“Yes. Are you guys mad?”
“It’s not just us. We have a whole team of ex-hunters,” Eileen replies.
“You as well,” Jason replies. He waves a solemn goodbye to the brothers, and trots back to his house. They watch the door close behind him.
“If it’s Cas, he probably needs help getting through,” Sam says. He takes out a pad of paper and a pen and starts drawing symbols. “These sigils are supposed to lure angels. Don’t know if it’ll help, but it’s worth a try.”
Sam’s phone rings. His fingers are stiff, so he fumbles to retrieve the phone from his pocket. The caller ID says Jodie. Sam answers.
“She wanted us to have them, so,” Dean shrugs.
“What is it? What’s he doing?”
"You just did my job for me. Thank you," the angel says.
“I do, if the both of you would just-” Dean lowers his hands in a calm down motion.
“Eileen, hey!” Dean says, greeting her with a hug. “Sam’s got you doing work for him, huh? Real Casanova over here.”
“Tell us what happened,” Sam says. Hannah glances at the baby, takes a deep breath, and lets it out in a sigh.
“Cas kept slapping the deck every time,” Claire laughs.
“I love you, too, Cas. Of course I love you.”
“Well, we have committed many crimes,” Cas replies. Dean’s smile drops.
“Yes, aside from losing my grace, I’m okay,”
“I mean, yeah, you should leave him too,” Dean adds.
“Sure thing,” Charlie says. Dean shrugs.
“Yeah!” Sam adds. “We know that you’re really healing people.”
“I’ll get that,” Charlie says, pulling away and nodding her head towards Miracle.
“Can’t,” Dean says, pointing at his belly. “Digesting.”
“I thought that rest was what he wanted. I thought this would teach him that he was capable of it.”
“Right,” Dean says. “Well, we’re here.”
“Cas?”
“Yeah, thanks for the help, buddy,” Dean replies sarcastically.
The basement is dingy - certainly less pristine than the upper part of the house. Concrete floors and torn, faded wallpaper. Scattered about are a CD player, notebooks, and sticks. In the corner, a chicken hops around a dog cage filled with straw. A space is cleared out in the center, where a pentagram is drawn on the floor. In the middle of it sits Dean, still in his wheelchair, his arms tied in front of him. There are two other girls standing there - one stands behind Dean with a knife pressed up against his neck.
“Oh, just great,” Dean says, resting the dented crowbar on his shoulder. “How was the case.”
“And then?”
“No, that’s not their fault,” Sam says. “We’re just not in sync the way Dean and I are. Like, I practically know what Dean’s about to do before he does it.”
“But, if all of the angels are going back to heaven, isn’t that a good thing?” Sam asks. “I mean, we tried and failed to do the same thing years back.”
“How do you think,” Dean retorts. “Is there coffee?”
Dean gets used to the rhythm of things. Sam fits the bunker with ramps so it’s easier for Dean to get over ledges. When Sam is gone, Dean calls Charlie or Jodie or Claire. He gets lonely. Sometimes he calls Sam, too, just to bother him. He takes Miracle for walks. He spends a lot of time doing research for Sam’s hunts, but there’s a lot of time in the day, and he quickly learns that he needs hobbies. He starts playing a guitar he had laying around, one he bought a while back and never had time to play. It turns out there’s a lake nearby, so sometimes Dean takes Miracle out there to run free while he goes fishing. He’s brought home a few big ones, and the feeling he gets when he shows Sam what he’s caught feels almost as good as killing a monster. Sam always gets home bloodied or bruised, and inexorably tired, but he’s happy to see his brother happy. And Dean is happy. Almost.
“Yes. We’ve dragged this on long enough. It’s time.”
“Am I gonna get to do that?”
“Katie, listen, we don’t know what happened to your friend,” Sam reasons. “You said you’re looking for her, right? Well so are we. If this Beleth guy possessed her, he’s probably run off with her body. We can help.”
It doesn’t take long.
“When I was in the woods with Charlie, too! A tree almost fell on me!”
“My secret,” Jason repeats.
“The way any man makes a decent living these days - An inheritance,” Roger chuckles.
Dean starts to respond when he realizes that no, he can’t move. He manages to prop himself up on his arms, but his legs can barely manage a wiggle. He tenses his muscles, but his legs are too heavy.
“Wait,” Sam says, blocking Dean with his arm.
“Special Agent Scheider,” Sam repeats. “Which one of you is Dylan?”
“I know how that feels. I’m sorry,” Dean says. Charlie sighs.
“Is he okay?”
“Okay, I gotcha,” Sam says, reaching to pull Dean off the rebar. Just the touch of Sam’s hand sends white hot pain shooting through his back.
“Castiel,” Dean calls out, but his voice gets lost in the wind. Castiel turns, his head lowered to look at the city below him. He extends his hand, palm facing downward. From it, a spotlight buzzes into fruition. It turns the fog over the city black, swirling and struggling and suffocating. A gust of wind passes over the hill, and with it the grass glistens in waves.
“Well maybe when Chuck opened the gates to hell, he got out. Maybe he manages to stay out, somehow.”
“You’re here?”
“It’s not your fault.”
“What do you want?” Sam asks.
“How do you feel about that?” Sam sets out the plate of bacon on the table
“I couldn’t sleep.” Another bang.
“What is it?” Jack replies.
“Cas,” this time his voice is firm. “There has to be a way to get you out of there. I need you to come back to me. Whatever you thought I might say, or how I feel, I can’t have it end like that. It’s not fair to end it like that, Cas. I need - I deserve-” Dean winces. What does he deserve, anyway? Everyone he cares about dies. It’s not some coincidence. Life’s a bitch, but Dean’s a menace. This is his fault, and now Cas is rotting away in darkness. And there’s no hope.
“In the flesh,” Dean replies.
Cas darts his eyes between the two of them. Dean’s smile fades. They spend the rest of the car ride in silence.
“Jack, I almost have it. Stay still,” Cas says, his thumb inching closer. Jack scrunches up his face.
All hell breaks loose. The Royal Guard dive in to protect Ketch, only to find resistance. Charlie and the troupe hiding in the audience, surge forward, and they are joined by the unexpected help from every servant still in this hall who rise up with them, putting their bodies in harms’ way for their prince. People scream and run about in chaos, throwing the huge doors open to flee out into the sudden raging storm. Wind and rain lash at the windows, the boom of thunderclaps underscoring the violence.
Castiel trails his fingers down over Dean’s skin, looking him in the eyes, unblinking, focused. “You’re too scattered. Uncertain and afraid. Let’s see if I can’t get you out of your head, Prince.”
“Tasty,” they agree together, licking their lips.
The world is easing into morning, the sky turning easter pink when he stumbles out of the woods on the edge of the Wallachstein Estate. Covered in blood, some of it his own, he drops tiredly to his knees in the dewy grass. A hard, mirthless laugh scrapes out him; after everything he’s been through tonight, he still has to figure out what to do about approaching the house. If he doesn’t get a place to rest soon, he’s going to collapse right here. He can’t just walk right up and ask to get in, because the Duke is in jail. The chance that one of his relatives has already swooped in to play “Lord of the Manor” is non trivial. If he’s lucky, Gabriel has left off getting high and clubbing in the capital to come and safeguard his brother’s home. If he’s unlucky, his cousin Naomi is here, and she has always had designs on the title, the money, and all the power. Not only would she take the opportunity to turn him into the Guard for points with his mother, but she’d search the place thoroughly, and that would suck for both he and the Duke.
Dean swallows hard, clenching a fist. He’d almost forgotten the reason he needed to be so sneaky coming home. His father was dead. King John was dead, and not only had they not sent for his oldest son, they’d locked up the Duke of Wallachstein for murdering him.
Slipping through the hallways turns out to be easy, despite the ‘upgrades’ which appear to be new locks on the sturdy old jail doors. There are cameras, huge blocky things that look like they came out of a spy movie. The lights flicker as he goes and it doesn’t help the crawling sensation running under his skin. Every now and then, he swears that he hears footsteps that turn out not to be real. He’s so stressed that when he finds the guard station, he almost laughs out loud at how silly, how easy it is. The door is propped open, a lone guard who looks as ancient as the equipment he’s babysitting sits in front of a bank of monitors that switch views. He’s asleep at his post, snoring, head tilted at an uncomfortable angle. An open lunch box with a half eaten sandwich sits nearby. There’s a chair for another guard, but none in evidence.
Dean grins to himself, looking at the way the sunset picks out the brown in his hair, caresses his cheek like a gentle hand.
Ketch sighs. “I am too generous with family, it’s long been a fault of mine. Bring them all with you, if you like, although I’m not sure that the next Duke will want to go to America and leave the Duchy in the hands of his cousin. I have no problem with Gabriel, he’s a good subject. Just do this, you will never have to see any of us again.”
She looks at him furiously. “What the hell are you talking about?”
This loft would command three times what they’re paying for it per month in a big city - but here in this podunk town the high ceilings and un-openable stained glass windows are what Sam refers to as ‘quirky’. There are only two windows that open, and one is in the bathroom. The other is tiny and “new”, meaning it probably got installed in the fifties. They’ve struggled it open and propped it with a cranky old box fan that revolves weakly, blowing hot air around. Right now Dean would give all of the quirky “cool” points their home has for a cookie cutter crap apartment with air conditioning and a handyman.
Dean steps towards her, violence etched into his face. “You are insane and Ketch is insane. You will kill your own people.”
“There really are an unprecedented amount of werewolves out there, you know.”
Dean kisses him, gently. “You’re going to marry me, Castiel Novak, and anyone who wants to get to you can come through me.”
“Don’t thank me. There’s nothing good happening here - something stinks. To high heaven.” He starts the car, and despite it being night time, puts on a pair of shades. Looking over them at Dean he says, “And don’t call me Gabe.”
In a whirl of cold air, Cas whisks through the door, slamming it behind him and leaning against it, panting. Dean bolts out of the chair, and Sam pulls his knife.
Dean sheds his coat and boots, but doesn’t remove his shoulder holster, sitting down beside him. “I don’t know. Sam is distrustful of everyone, but I think he wants Ketch out. Everything here is so fucked up. Did you know about some weird purity thing in the Men of Letters?”
“I’m… talking to some actors?”
Castiel frowns. “How would we afford it?”
Dean claps Sam on the shoulder. “He made it so we couldn’t solve this without each other. Go get your picture while these two ladies figure out how to get the image out of my head.”
Guests, noblemen, elite from across Europe, all start to filter in, including Castiel himself, escorted by Mick. Dean can’t help the smile that bursts out at the sight of him, elegant and pissed in black, glaring daggers at everyone. They sit in the front and Gabriel goes to join them. It clearly annoys Mick, but there’s not much he can do without giving the game away. Dean is sure he has a gun or a knife with him to keep Cas in line.
Dean whaps Castiel’s arm, lightly. “A joke! He makes a joke. I am such a good influence on you.”
“Your throne?”
He lets go of the arm and gets off Dean, retreating a little. His nose is bloody, and there will be a fantastic bruise on his cheek, but his eyes are bright and sharp. Dean flops over onto his back and pants a little.
It’s late afternoon, and Cas has picked a table on the third floor of the library. It’s wedged against a window, bright sunlight streaming over everything. He’s squinting to see the screen of his laptop, papers strewn everyplace. In the sun, the air conditioning has less effect, leaving them both cold and sweating at the same time, which is weird.
Absently, Sam says, “It’s Sam. I know. I saw him, but he’d never talk to me. He said Ketch did it?”
Dean nods, slinging his arm around her for a second. “She’s right. It’s a ridiculous play, but it mirrors life so well right now that if it looks like you’re laughing at him, we can’t claim innocence. So do your best, guys. And be on your toes. It would be really bad optics right now for him to hurt visiting artists, but he will have some of you followed. Put every safety protocol we have into play. No one goes out alone.”
“So, you left because you loved a boy and they hated it, you’ve told me that much. Why are you back?”
Cas offers a hand this time and Dean takes it, getting himself to his feet, wincing at the twinge in his shoulder. “If that’s what you want, but they’ll come for me faster than you’d like.”
Sam sighs. “I watched it on TV. C’mon, you know I’m at a crucial point here. I can’t just swan off whenever I want.”
Cas nods thoughtfully. “Fall is quite lovely on the trails. You are forgetting something, though. Remember that spot Dorothy and Charlie told us about?”
Castiel tries to put the ring on Dean’s finger, and there’s some trial and error before they realize it’s adjustable. Then he kisses Dean, pressing him back against the seat so hard that they wobble dangerously.
“No, I can’t hear an apology, it will break me.”
They pass into the entrance, and Dean pays. “Well, I’m ready to make some more. What shall we do first, gorgeous?”
Dean swallows hard. “Don’t go out there.”
He still feels like a coward, even more so that he is a mere thought away from just getting on a plane and leaving forever.
A low wail echoes through the hall, raising all the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck. His skin crawls at the look on the apparition’s face. It mimics the rage he had in life; a rage far too often focused on his son. He should run, but he’s paralyzed with fear.
Tad paws at his face. “Suuurrrr, shh. You have the cuter angle.. Ang.. anel.. Ha! Gay Angle, though.”
“I know what you’re thinking.” She carefully starts plugging everything in. “These are huge. Antiques almost. The cases are, for sure. But you can’t beat these. Metal, strong. Durable. I’d go small, get myself a computer to fit in my palm, but then it would just get stolen.”
Dean tucks his phone receiver into the implant in his ear with a click and a grimace, heading out of the apartment towards the stairs. He hears the broken-ass elevator before he passes it, the fuzzy warped sound of the deranged computer in it floating towards him as he goes.
Charlie clicks her tongue ring against her bottom teeth. “Nothing. Why are you talking to me and not your brother?”
Sam clinks beers with him. “So, what do we do?”
When the limo comes, the day could not be more beautiful, cloudless clear sky and a slightly cool breeze. People wave from the sides of the road, held back by mounted police and low wooden barricades. He and Sam ride with the windows down, waving at people as they go. He lets himself sink into the fantasy that he’s on the way to his own coronation, that everything will be okay.
“No.” Castiel’s voice is quiet and solid in the dark. He stands behind the King, fury etched into every line of his face. He reaches around to seize John’s forehead and Dean has the presence of mind to close his eyes just as the light comes, blinding and pure.
Dean bats his eyes, leaning against a rock. “Of course, but who knows. Perhaps I will find a beautiful woman to become my bride there.”
To Charlie, Dean asks, “Why can’t Castiel look at the one Sam has and do it from his own memory? He’s well equipped, I imagine.”
“No.” Castiel is talking quietly to Gabriel, and Dean can only pay so much attention. He’s being fucked, and someone can see it, and suddenly he’s coming, convulsing in overwhelming ecstasy. Gabriel says something, whatever, he can’t hear it, but he does hear Castiel respond, and he’s calm, sounds collected, but he can feel the way his hands shake and grasp in his hair.
Dean tries again, loud and long, “Unnnnnnnnnngggggg….”
“He has to, Dean,” Sam says softly. “If he resists or runs, they can claim it as proof of treason, or worse, simply kill him while he’s struggling. Then they can come for you, too.”
Dean grabs his arm. “No, Cas, don’t, just. Just wait. The people you want to save will kill you before you even get near her. And they’ve figured out some way to make it work again, remember Balthazar?”
“Oh god, Cas, forgive me, you-”
“Poor Dean. Too hot to touch.”
Charlie stands up. “So, I know the script needs work, but don’t ham it up.”
Dean takes a knee and looks up at his boyfriend, who is watching him with a trace of a smile on his face. Somewhere behind him, he can hear a chorus of squealing sorority girls, and Gabriel making gagging sounds.
“Dude. You have got to be more aware of your surroundings.”
“Yes it is. It is, actually, my business.”
“Hey, I think the little guy asked the poor guy to marry him!” Everyone in earshot on the wheel cheers and claps. Dean hides his face.
“Your father meant for all hands to be looking at it, I think, or it wouldn’t be hidden in such a ridiculous way. Anyway, it’ll be over before you know it. Just follow the script I wrote for you and we’ll both be fine. What I want to know is, what is that?” She points to the symbol etched onto the glass.
The redhead from the elevator stands in the doorway, red and yellow striped pajama bottoms hang off her skinny frame. She has a t-shirt that reads “Save a Tree - Eat a Beaver”. It’s seen better days. From the hallway, Sam moves her into the apartment and then shuts the door, talking to someone on his comm as he does.
Charlie clicks her tongue ring against her teeth, the sound amplified through the receiver. “Yeah, okay, I get it. I gotta go, green eyes. Call if you need me, come home with your head still attached. We’ll all be waiting for you.”
When they break out of the trees and into the clearing, it is entirely worth every second of the confusing and bug-filled walk. Water from a mountain-fed river diverts here, flowing down through the cleft of ancient glacier-rock, making a waterfall that falls into a pool, just about waist deep. The water is clear and sweet, and all the rocks around the pool are large and flat, inviting to sit on. It’s also completely deserted.
“God, stop, call me by my name!”
Dean shakes his head. “I didn’t think that far.”
Sam gestures for her to go ahead and backs up. Cas looks up at Dean nervously, reaching out. They link hands, staring at each other quietly. Shaking her head and smirking, Charlie plugs the cable in. Castiel goes inert, his eyes glowing a bright yellow, all his features lax. Neutral. Waiting.
“Arthur Ketch, kneel.” He holds the crown aloft, looking into Castiel’s eyes, meeting flinty rage with apologetic softness.
Everyone gathers around and Sam holds the tablet with Rowena on it up so she can see. The images are definitely different, but Dean has no idea what he’s looking at. Castiel and Charlie do, however, and they’ve already begun communicating about it. Mostly without talking, which they’ve started doing the last hour, and is really making him uncomfortable.
Rowena laughs. Charlie scowls, making her laugh harder. “You believe in demons, child, but not angels?”
“Well that was dramatic,” she muses, closing the door behind her.
Cas steers him towards it. They walk through the midway, different rock music pumping out of each ride, lights flashing. Teenagers in groups run from line to line. Dean dumps the remains of their snacks, and tries to get Cas to go on the Tilt-O-Whirl instead, but he’s firmly manhandled into the line for the wheel.
“You can’t pull that rank crap on me now, not after everything,” he retorts. “What do you want, anyway? They won’t let me bring a phone to him and I’m not personally delivering any messages of love or whatever.”
“It’s getting a little crowded in here, huh? Not that I mind being pressed up against Sam.”
The plan, as far as he gathers, is to get the image from Cas’ memory instead of trying to pry it out of Dean’s own head. Something about ‘people listening’. Around them, Sam is gathering a small altar to Rowena’s specifications. A distracted part of him notices how much his brother seems to like her; his goofy flirting face is on and he’s a little clumsier than usual.
“You found me out.  I went to one of these a few times as a kid, I have good memories.”
“I think we have our starting point, guys.” Charlie settles in on the floor, facing him. “Describe it.”
“Ok-ay. So you’re pissed.”
His intention is to give Cas a saucy look and invite him in, but the shock of the cold water on his overheated skin is just so orgasmically good, that he simply moans in gratitude. Holding his nose, Dean lets himself go boneless, dunking under into the cool, clear water.
“Castiel, please-”
Castiel throws the phone over his shoulder, eyes trained on Dean. He pushes him back into his seat with one finger so he can straddle him, one knee on each side of his lap. Dean smiles up at him and wiggles his ring finger.
Rowena holds up John’s book. “Why do that, when we have magic? Haven’t you ever made a voodoo doll?”
“Dean Winchester,” the one on the left, purple hair, whispers in delight.
“Neither, dumbass. He’s like, ninety eight percent human. Because it’s unhealthy. You think I didn’t notice anything? You thought that time I...” Sam shudders, “walked in on you fucking in the barn that was the only thing I ever saw? He’s creepy and controlling. You’d have done anything for him. And I mean anything.”
Sam’s taller now and thin like a blade, his muscles compact and practical, not showy. The long locks are still there, held back in a loose bun on the back of his head. He closes the door behind him, catching his brother as he vaults himself into a tight embrace. When he pulls back, his eyes are guarded.
He digests that for a few minutes before he starts laughing. “So, I do actually have a costume after all. I’m really going as…”
Dean points, nods. “Yes, her too. This play, if you do it right, will get him off his guard. It’ll make his supporters nervous. It might mean, that when it's time to strike, he’ll be less defended.”
Dean sighs, watching Charlie boss everyone around. “Soon. Soon, head on a swivel. There’s a non trivial chance that he might take it for what it is.”
They stare at one another for an eternity, the years passing between them as an unspoken conversation. Behind Cas, a form starts to flicker into existence, glowing white hot blue in the dark. As it does, Castiel drops to one knee with a slight sneer, never looking away from Dean.
They meet in his father’s study. Mary is already there, wearing the plush pink robe Dean gave her for her birthday when he was in single digits. He’s overwhelmed by the sense memory of it, the smell and soft texture when she’d hold him close, whispering that everything would be okay. Her hair is wild, pulled back in an attempt to look less debauched, maybe. It doesn’t help.
“What if I ask for your fortune, your future, your home?”
She nods, but her gaze is still disconcertingly direct. “So, I got your parameters, and I think we’ve whipped up a good script. But are you sure this is safe?”
“No,” Cas whispers, “he’ll take it until I’m done. You can stay if you want, but it might get weird for you.”
The lake, always with the strange lake. The golden light of sunset makes his blue eyes glow a little. He always stands so close…he shakes it off. Dreaming about that isn’t fair. The man is fighting for his freedom. Dean should stop thinking about it.
“I don’t know, but we’ll figure it out as we go. Don’t look so worried, Dean, it’s only your head we’ll be playing with...”
Cas just sniffs. Alarmed, Dean comes towards him, reaching out to hug or touch him. Cas springs into action, splashing him full in the face, cackling, “SUCKER!”
It hurts, like nothing else. Not any monster claw or bite, no bullet or burn he’s ever had compares with the white-hot cold of Mordavian steel slicing through him. His blood runs, hot and fresh down the altar, dripping down the steps to pool into a small lake of red. Ketch pulls the sword out of him and draws back his hand to do it again.
“Mom, just you and I. What happened with you and Dad?”
“Any other day,” Dean drops and slides under them as they lunge, coming up behind them, “I would love to oblige you both.”
Dean’s head is pounding harder now, and he only really grasps what his brother is saying in bits and pieces. It’s too much. He kicks the table, sending food flying, startling Sam enough to make him back away.
Dean pulls Cas around to look at him. “Listen, the friends we’ve made here, we’ll always have them. Just try getting rid of Kevin, or Charlie. And it’ll take more than suddenly needing to get an actual professional job to get rid of me, baby. But hey, if you want, we can just keep picking up graduate degrees, be students forever.”
They’re gone, taking the guards with them, before Dean can really wrap his head around any of that. Ketch’s quiet snicker lingers longer than his mother’s perfume and he stays until it’s quiet here in the study. Cas watches him carefully.
Pausing to catch his breath at the edge of a quiet farm, he looks at the long road leading towards the next small village. This is where he needs to be extra careful. A quick look at his watch confirms that the train has already made it to the station after Littleton, even with the unscheduled stop. The Royal Guard will be going through the train, both to confirm that he was on it and to try to find him. Eventually, they’re going to catch on to his plan and come after him. If he’s walking along the road they’ll see him sooner rather than later; they have vehicles and he doesn’t. But if he goes into the woods, he’s absolutely going to have a fight. Possibly more than one. Werewolves have the teamwork of wolves with the strategy sense of a human, and if he’s not careful, he won’t come back out of the forest.
Castel reaches for the Sprite with a sound of disgust, not looking up from the screen. Dean sits across from him, poking at his own drink dejectedly. “You know, we’ve been coming here to escape the sun. Why are we sitting at this table?”
Dean chuckles as he pokes around the small space, lifting bottles and peering into vials. “I remember when this was your, like, private fort. Pillows and books and lame shit like that. This lab you made is cool. Does anyone know this is here?”
She piles her hair up and uses what Dean thinks might be a zip tie to hold it in place. “Sam told me some of what he wants. If you’re fucking with Dick Roman and H34V3N, I’m all in. But you need magic, too, and I have a partner. She’s going to want something in the form of payment, she could give a shit about AI rights.”
Late afternoon, Sam corners him with a bottle of spray-on sunscreen and some water. “Hydrate. Put more of this on, you’re looking a little like a lobster.”
He offers Dean his arm, and despite Sam’s thin lipped frown and Gabriel’s gagging noises, Dean takes it.
There’s a pause, as if the world itself were going in slow motion. Ketch looks up at Dean in surprise at the same time that Castiel lets out a pleased shout, grappling with Mick who has a sudden glint of steel in his hand. The walls of the church seem to vibrate with the force of a booming thunderclap just as Dean, the crown raised up high, brings it down across Ketch’s face. Sam dives for their mother, grabbing and holding her fast.
“I don’t understa- oh. I see. ‘I know when you’re sleeping’. You should give up hunting and take to the stage.”
Dean sneers. “Wasted exactly zero time, I see, Mom.”
The banging intensifies. Dean sighs, opening his eyes to look at Cas, who’s watching the door and biting his lip anxiously.
“Can I put my head in your lap?” He does it anyway.
With a pleased purr, Castiel takes him there, unashamed and free, heedless of who may be watching.
“Well,” he says with an arched eyebrow, “At least it’s cool in here.”
“Don’t. Cas, don’t do it…”
“But you are, Dean. Your mother and I were wed, not that long ago. You may have heard - or, wait. Did you? She tends to forget she even has an older son. In the end there, she seemed to have forgotten that she was married, too. I have to say, John had everything in the world, but he was so unable to hold onto it.”
He shrugs. “And yet I saw him in the hall. He didn’t know me. He walked through to a classified section and I was strongly discouraged from asking questions.”
In a minute, Charlie takes the dry-erase pen and writes a series of numbers and letters on the board. He blinks at it. Sam laughs and walks off. To the curious eyes around him, Dean answers, “It’s a filing code for the bunker and it’s in my Grandfather’s personal storage room. I think what we were looking for was here the whole time.”
Dean sighs. “What? What else could you possibly want?”
“Shut it, and get. Sam. Tell him we found the Succubus.”
His voice is so much a part of the darkness that Dean thinks for a half second that he’s imagining Castiel’s presence again. Or dreaming it. But, no, there he is, concealed in the shadow of the building.
He laughs, “Oh Dean. It’s not a relationship, it’s sick.”
“I felt like I had to. It’s so eerie. It was like having some kind of flashback. Even the actors look just like both of you. I’m worried it’ll make your jobs harder.”
“That’s none of your business, sweetheart.” Her voice is soft, her fingers mesmerizing in his hair. He could let it go, follow where she leads. Simply let her love him, accept what she’s done and move on. He could, but he’s done. His heart is broken open. Dean pulls away, stands unsteadily and faces her.
He lowers his voice a little. “If it’s the lack of a ring that’s a problem, allow me.”
He leans close into Castiel’s space. “Go home, you abomination. You’re a perversion of nature, and you taint the very air with your presence.”
“Castiel, would you do me the honor of-”
Castiel stands and stretches. “Well, then. Let’s retire to my hotel suite and we can come up with a plan of action. Ketch isn’t going to kill us there, at least not until we’re asleep, so we have a few hours.”
“Ugh, fuck, fine.” Dean gets up and goes to the door, throwing it open with a snarl.
“-you wouldn’t feel the same way, and anyhow, it felt like it -
Cas looks over his glasses at Dean, and the scolding librarian look sets him off immediately. He sits up and knee-walks over, eyes fixated on the delicious way Cas’ worn jeans mold to the muscles of his thighs, and the gleaming temptation that is the zipper on his fly.  He spreads his hands over the soft fabric, looking up into his eyes, licking his lips. Cas cups his hand under Dean’s chin and raises an eyebrow.
“Ohhhkay. I guess I’ll take a shower, then.”
All Dean can do is watch helplessly,   arms bound above his head. He’d be unable to do anything else regardless, spellbound by his lover’s beauty. He wants to come, in the worst way, but at the same time, the pleasure is endless, time has no meaning. Dean is lost in Castiel, reduced to happily begging for what he wants.
Dean clears his throat and looks down at the scrawled notes she gave him. “317-20-95-12.777 access memory.”
Dean says, “We throw a party. Mom wants to crown Ketch, and I convinced her that I wanted to prove my loyalty by throwing them a festival. The idea will appeal to Ketch, even if he doesn’t trust me. The three day festival is traditional, and the optics of doing it right are crucial, so it buys us time. At the end of it, I’ve offered to crown him king.”
“Well then,” Sam puts down the beer, “where do we start?”
Dean reaches for his coat, checking to make sure his gun is secured in the holster. “It won’t work, not immediately or completely. The building has a shield around it, so you will get the angels outside. Sam and I will go take it down. Ladies, you got this?”
Dean can’t help the bark of laughter, unwise though it is. “Oh god, fuck you. I didn’t kill you, you pushed me away.”
When he gets there, Cas looks up at him, breathless with laughter, his eyes bright with a smile. “Hey, Dean.”
Confused, she tries to relax, but can’t quite seem to do it, shaking. He smiles up into her face, knowing that he looks deranged. “I am so sorry. You’re my mother, you were here to pick up the pieces, and I arrived here, shouting and stomping like a child. I’m unfit. Honestly, it would be a relief to let you take over.”
She nods, exhaustion gathering under her eyes. “Of course. I’ll give Arthur the good news.”
The dawn comes the way it always does, a sweet stain spreading across the sky. In the street, people are already bustling, cleaning and preparing for the big day. He nudges Sam, waking him up. The servants from the castle start arriving with their clothing, itineraries, and a hundred other things. He stands listlessly for his fitting, noting the way the servants nod and look at each other meaningfully. He knows he looks like a lost and mournful lover and does nothing to hide it. He hopes the story will spread among the servants. He could use all the help he can get.
When all he can do is weep, Castiel makes this small pitying noise with his tongue, and touches him on the forehead. Lust courses through him, suddenly hard and heavy, pressed against the soft velvety blanket under him. All the pain makes pleasure, lost inside Castiel’s power over him, he bucks, whimpering. It’s not enough, it’s not nearly enough.
Sam snorts, getting up and leaving him to it, adjusting decorations and making sure hidden weapons are still in place through the room. “I don’t want to hear it. I’m the target, since you and Cas decided to pretend to be a couple for this gig. A swinging, bisexual couple? Oh no, that would be too easy.”
The questions all start to pile on top of each other and he can’t escape the press of the tiny flying robots surrounding him. He scowls and hunches, trying to shield his face.
Before Dean can stop him, he’s opened the limo and slipped out, a blur of black and silver. Castiel inclines his head to the reporters, offering no resistance when the Guard come to collect him. Sam clamps his hand on Dean’s shoulder, holding him in place while they shackle Castiel and load him into one of the vans. He holds him there until the vans are gone and the coast is clear.
“Cas, I’m -”
Dean feels an overwhelming sense of relief and grins tightly. “Sammy, oh God, it’s good to see you.”
Castiel stands in a pool of light, the rest of his cell dark and deep, arms crossed. Waiting. Dean is struck to the heart by the sight of him. His hair, his lips, the bright blue eyes that sparkle in the light just so - Castiel tilts his head to look at Dean, completely unsurprised to see him.
“Another reason I know that you trust Castiel is because I know for a fact that you’re training together. This... slick assassin look you have going on isn’t because you’ve been oh-so close with Ketch.”
“I know Ketch did it, Sammy. Dad’s ghost was in the dungeon waiting for me.”
When the door’s closed, Dean murmurs, “You look handsome, as usual.”
There’s a pounding on the door. He shakes his head, refusing to acknowledge it, hoping it’ll go away. Cas makes a noise.
Dean shakes him off and goes into the hotel, ignoring reporters and people who have come to gawk. Sam and Gabriel follow in his wake like silent shadows.
Roughly nudging Dean’s legs apart, he wastes no time, pushing into his sore, used ass. It hurts more than he imagined it would. He wants - he needs more time to get used to it, but Cas ignores that, fucking him slow and deep, holding him in place with one hand firmly wrapped under and around his throat.
“I remembered the day I gave you that beautiful diamond. My mother’s diamond. The one you are still wearing, I see. We climbed out to the fields behind the University and I took you under the full moon. It wouldn’t have been safe here, but in America, we could do what we wanted.”
“None taken. I’ve always thought he was creepy, especially when he was alive.”
Dean runs his hands through his hair. “It didn’t work.”  He tries to concentrate on the feel of the sun-warmed deck under his feet and the weight of Castiel’s hand on his shoulder.
“Perhaps. I had not been in court for a long time when it happened. Gabriel, though, is happy to gossip. Her Majesty and Mr. Ketch weren’t very subtle about the affair, but John pulled him even tighter instead of firing him or banishing him from court. They were inseparable until they went to Wallachstein to hunt werewolves. He didn’t come back alive.”
Dean knocks his hand away. “I’m not going anywhere. You murdered my father.”
Dean shakes him off. “Now you’re overstepping.”
In answer, Dean thrusts his hips upwards, making Castiel hiss and close his eyes. “And you know my answer, damn you.”
“Charlie filled us all in on everything. When it’s time to take back your throne, can we help you?”
“She has assured me,” Cas says as he settles in and the attendant locks the bar firmly, “That no one has ever died on this Ferris wheel.”
“Ah, I was wondering when you’d get there. Ketch and your mother were married yesterday. I suspect it’s why I’m in this cell - to keep me from contacting you so you couldn’t come home and take your rightful place. There has been so much unrest and when they announced their intent, there were nearly riots. I don’t know what they have planned, but the country is leaderless, and has been for months.”
Castiel laughs, splashing him. “Of course, you nitwit. But you don’t have to worry about that. Your dad will live forever, and even before that, we get to leave. Think about it. University. In a few months, even.”
His outer shirt is stripped off, and then the one under it, leaving Dean shivering in just a t-shirt. The room is warm, but Castiel’s hands are like moon-lit ice, cooling him down even while his pulse kicks into overdrive.
Even with all his practice in sneaking around, getting into the country without someone knowing he’s back will be nearly impossible. He should’ve let Charlie get him that fake ID; he hadn’t received an A in his last stage makeup class for nothing. Sadly, he was too built for drag now, which would be both the best way to not be noticed as well as a great way to piss off his --
“Yes. Like C-Cas. They had some plan, but Dad wouldn’t ever sh-share it, and then everything went to shit.”
Dean shakes his head. No matter how much he wants to, he can’t, he shouldn’t. So much is going on, it’s too dangerous. He tries to pull back, but Castiel tightens his hand in Dean’s hair, holding him still. With the other hand, he unzips his pants and draws his cock out of his expensive, silk pants. He’s ragingly hard, a tiny pearl of precome beading at the tip. Slowly, Castiel pulls Dean’s head forward. His grip is like iron, but all Dean would have to do is scream…
Slouching out of the bedroom, he sees Sam at the window in their living room, lights off. This window is the only thing redeeming the place; one entire wall is one way glass, reflecting the bright neon lights of the city around them. It is beautiful.
Frustrated, he clenches his hand on the bottle. “What the fuck, Sam. How are you so damned calm? This guy killed Dad. We can’t just let him take everything!”
Dean takes a step forward, reaching out. “Help me get him out of the country. If they really think he murdered my father, they’ll kill him.”
He narrows his eyes. Dean can see that his mother, pale and horrified, sits with her face in her hands. Good, strike one for team righteous.
“No,” Dean says firmly. “No, Cas, stay. I don’t trust Ketch. They had you in a cell not even an hour ago.”
“In all honesty, I am sorry about your father,” he says faintly.
Slowly, he tries to get up again, waving off Castiel’s attempt to help. “The Fallen packed quite a punch. What the hell was he trying to do with my head?”
“Ugh,” Charlie says. Dean can’t agree more.
Dean groans. “Yes, please, I’m done. Stop, I give.”
Castiel says nothing, trembling and silent. The entire room has gone from loud daily bustling to absolute silence. Dean can feel dozens of eyes on him, and the collected held breath of everyone present. Tears collect in Castiel’s eyes, but he stands quietly for another long moment before slowly and gracefully bending to one knee. “As you command, Your Highness.”
Castiel slips Dean’s shirt off, covering his shoulders and the hollow of his neck with small kisses. Breath ghosts along pebbled skin. “And we did. You were beautiful, naked in the light. You were free, we were free together, and you remember the promise you made?”
“What do you mean by amateur? No one gets paid to do this crap.”
“Dean, what happens when we’re done?”
Castiel turns his full attention to Dean, and raises an eyebrow. “You are utterly insane.”
Dean nods, eagerly. Over eagerly even, desperate to have it. He wants Cas to take his throat, he’d give anything, everything he has or will have if he could only be made to take it, to feel him come.
Cas just looks at him. Dean points at the giant spinning top. “How about the Gravitron? It’ll be fun. You can slide up and down on the wall.”
She looks at him. “Wine.”
“He made the right call, Dean. Cas isn’t to be trusted.”
“Something changed,” Dean says quietly. “If she has Dad, he’s probably given her something. Kidnapping and replacing Kevin him gives her intelligence, so…”
“Is he brooding again, Wings?” Charlie and Rowena follow Sam down to the lake more sedately, carrying folding chairs, towels, and a picnic basket. The witch is smirking at Dean with a fond but exasperated look.
She taps her head. “Everything important is in my body. But these bad boys supply the power. And no junkie is going to go running down the street with one. Here, Fabio, take this cord, make yourself useful.”
Dean shouts over the muttered voices, “I was kept from it! Exiled by my own father for the sin of falling in love. My mother has asked me to do the hardest thing, the most noble thing, and put my people first. She has asked me to crown as King, the man my father loved the most.”
“What are you doing, Dean?”
Dean covers his face, feeling dizzy. He whispers, “Cas.”
“Mom, you look beautiful.”
His voice is soft, laced with danger. “You know, no one can see you. All they can see is me.”
Charlie makes a strange sound, a half squeak. “Angels are real?”
“Soo…. Cas, it’s Friday.”
Mary swallows, hard. “No, that’s… no. Our people are pure. There’s nothing to be afraid of, Dean, this will work.”
Ketch’s voice drops down in tone, dangerous and slick. “If you try to fuck with me tomorrow, I will personally slit his throat right there in the coronation room and make you watch him bleed to death.”
Dean drops the baseball on the bed and gets up, smoothing out the tuxedo. His lips still burn from the kiss, the first kiss he’d ever had, stolen right here in this room only moments before his father came in and nearly caught them.
His cell phone beeps and he looks down. “Ah, that’s Mick. Sorry, Son, you know how it is. All work and no play. This has been lovely, we should do it again.”
Handsome’s smile gets wider and his eyes light up from within, electric blue. He reaches out a hand and places it on Dean’s forehead. He tries to shrink away, but the lackey’s grip is like iron and there’s nowhere to go. Warmth spreads from Handsome’s palm and radiates outwards.
“Tell me about it. Is everything ready for tonight?”
“Maybe later. Why not?”
“Cas… my angel...”
Dean glares at Cas as the ride slowly rotates, letting more people on. As it fills up, they begin to rise higher and higher, the seat swinging a little. He grabs onto the side, afraid at first, and then slowly relaxes into it. When they get to the top, they stop. There’s a lovely breeze, and the stars are bright above them, the fair spread out below them as a sea of twinkly lights. Laughter floats by, the roar of the music muted.
Something loosens in Dean’s chest. HIs brother’s stitches came out a few days ago, but his hair is still a little patchy, and it looks even more ridiculous when he comes up from under the lake. He’s alive. Alive and well.
He feels a phantom hand on his throat, swallows against the lump forming. “C’mon, what about you and that stupid movie actress? You can’t tell me that wasn’t horrible?”
Dean sits up straighter, eyeing him. “We both saw the enormous bullet hole in his head, Cas.”
He fires and purple-hair goes down, head obliterated. “And of course, if you weren’t undead.”
The guy in the car, still angrily ranting about his money, opens the car door, intent on yelling some more, but it opens too far and smacks Dean in the head.
“I bet that guy in the trench coat he’s always got hanging around is his accomplice,” Bill continues. “It’s criminal activity, I’m telling you. How else would he get the money to start up a joint like this?”
“What?”
Eileen slips back behind the metal door, leaving Cas and Dean alone in the alley, save for a few students milling around on the sidewalk. One of the people approaches them. He’s older than the others, and has black hair.
“But I thought premonitions like that were set in stone unless seeing it makes you change something.”
“What? No, Dean it’s a case. I think - or something weird, anyway. I think we should check it out.”
From the main room come the sounds of squealing laughter and hands pounding on the table. Dean fiddles with the button on his jacket sleeve.
“A 2005 Ford Fiesta, not to brag,” Jason replies, sarcastically. “I have a broken down 1972 Chevy Chevelle sitting in the garage, though. I’ve been meaning to get it fixed for ages - maybe I could go to you.”
“A break-in?” Dean prys.
Cas and Dean are alone.
“Good,” Sam says mischievously. “Because it’s veggie bacon.” Dean opens his mouth and lets the chewed-up bacon drop out with a plop onto the plate.
“Dean, what does one bring to a potluck?” Cas asks. He looks left and right, then jogs across the street.
“No, no,” Sam laughs. “Just, hunting as a brotherhood - or sisterhood! I feel like I barely know other hunters, and even when we work together it’s all so individualistic.”
“Cas, shut up,” Dean growls. Cas holds his breath. Dean takes a final step, just before him. Dean furrows his brow, and grabs Cas by the collar. Cas’ breath shudders.
“And you’ll support him no matter what…”
“I won’t let it. C’mon, you’re gonna leave me alone here? Really?”
“It’s time to go,” Cas tells Jason.
“Have you ever played Egyptian rat-screw?” Eileen says. They shake their heads.
“We’re investigating some strange occurrences in the area. People popping up where they’re not supposed to - that sort of thing,” Sam says. The officer scoffs.
“So much cheese…” Dean groans.
“Hey, Jason!” Dean calls out amicably, waving as he approaches the building.
Jack outstretches the bag of chips toward the group. Dean takes one, to which Sam gives him a dirty look.
“Being God is a big responsibility,” Jack continues. “I just want to get it right.”
“I learned, somewhere along the line, that there are things more important than Heaven,” Jason says, glancing back at the house where his family are inside, starting their morning.
He checks to make sure the door is closed.
“Shut up,” Dean says.
“Well, what if Jason wasn’t an angel.”
“So, things turned out differently, somehow.”
“Guilty as charged,” Cas says, tilting his head in good nature.
“Dude, what the hell?” Sam exclaims.
It dawns on Dean how vulnerable Cas is, and that being vulnerable is probably not something he’s used to.
Time passes. Hours, days. Sam comes back. They don’t tell him, but he catches on. Cas sleeps in Dean’s room, but Cas can’t sleep. They sit together in the mornings, the three of them, and cases are slow, screeching to a halt. But it’s okay this time. Dean can take the silence, the empty moments. Because Cas is there. He shows him how to play guitar, and he’s bad at it, but he can sing. He takes a liking to Miracle, and the feeling is mutual. The movie nights, the jogs, the joyrides in the impala, the groggy mornings with nothing to do. Dean relishes it.
“Kansas?”
“Dude, did Jack heal you or something?”
“I thought I made the right choice with Dean, leaving him incapacitated,” Jack says. “I thought that it would lead to his happiness.”
Sam shrugs.
“You and Sam’ve got quite the operation here,” Dean says.
“Lucky? How is this lucky?” Dean roars. “I’m out of commission Sammy. My damn legs don’t work. What am I supposed to do, roll over a werewolf’s toes?”
Fade in. When Dean’s vision clears again, Sam is kneeling down beside him. Dean tries desperately to look at him, but eyes won’t focus. He needs to see his face, to get one last look at his baby brother while he still has the chance, but he can’t. All he gets is a warm hand on the small of his back, and a wiggle of the metal spike that feels like lightning ripping through him. Fade out.
“Yes,” Cas says. His eyes are dazed, with deep circles beneath them. He looks like he’s barely managing to keep himself upright.
Dean buries his face in his hands.
“WOAH WOAH WOAH, DE-ESCALATE! DE-ESCALATE!” Dean shouts. He puts himself in front of Castiel, blocking him.
“Hey, Sam. I see you’ve met Katie,” Dean says. “She’s a real firecracker, huh?”
“Dean - you don’t have an appointment today,” Jason says.
“Yeah, I can handle it.”
“I don’t get it, why would an angel be working at a place like this? Or at all, for that matter?” Dean asks.
“Narrative or informative?” Charlie asks, leaning on her car.
“Dean!” Cas yells, instinctively jumping in front of him.
“I’ve already said my goodbyes. I have nothing left to offer him,” Cas says.
“Dean this isn’t our house, I don’t want to damage the walls.” Sam rips a piece of paper from the pad and hands it to Dean. “Here, put this up.” Sam throws him a roll of tape. Dean sulks and rolls his eyes.
“Bingo,” Jason says.
“I’m gonna go pass out,” Dean says.
“I didn’t say anything,” Sam retorts with a smirk.
“I’ll see you on Monday, Dean.”
“Sam doesn’t know we’re coming,” Cas states.
Dean shrugs.
"Hey Cas, can I get your thoughts on something?" says a portly angel, stepping out from his cubicle. He wears glasses - angels cannot have poor eyesight, so this is a bold fashion choice.
“I really need you right now, man,” he continues. “Things are bad. I got hurt. I need your help but I - I need you here, Cas. I need to know you’re okay. However you feel or however you think I feel, I can’t have things end like that. You can’t do that to me. We’ve gotten through worse before. I need you to do it again. Whatever you have to do, do it. Please, Cas, plea-”
“So you let him declare his love for you, and then die?” Charlie exclaims. “No wonder he’s being pissy.”
“Fear of what?” Charlie asks quietly. Dean furrows his brow.
Sam takes a moment to catch his breath. He leans on the table and gulps down water from a reusable bottle as Miracle rushes over to him and jumps up against his legs. Sam ruffles his fur. In the distance, there’s loud clanging - the sound of metal-on-metal. Sam sets the bottle down. He gently pushes Miracle aside and follows the noise.
“Well, I didn’t, Dean retorts.
“You felt...”
An angel blade slips out of Jason’s sleeve. He grips his fist around it and punches Cas in the nose. A splatter of blood flies through the air as Cas stumbles back into the street. As soon as Cas steadies himself, he lunges back at Jason, throwing a punch that lands square in his jaw. Jason smirks, gearing up to throw another blow, when Cas grabs him by the shirt collar pushes him. Jason goes flying through the air, slamming into the ground about a yard back. Cas strides forward.
“Yes, I’m leaving now,” Cas says.
A boy seated in front of them turns around and shushes them. Dean rolls his eyes. He settles into his chair and leans his face on his fist, eyes glazing over. Classroom learning was still as mind-numbing as he remembered. As his mind wanders, his eyelids grow heavy, and he doses off.
“You doubt whether or not the pain he experiences now is a necessary evil.”
Sam takes a melancholic sip of coffee.
“Whaddya think?” Dean asks, his mouth full. Cas swallows.
“Well, Patience certainly didn’t change anything.”
“Maybe it’s worth talking to him about this,” Charlie says, her voice gentle.
“Yeah, yeah. We’ll get out of your hair,” the other one says, pulling Kyle the sleeve.
“In my room,” Dean says, pointing. “Right there.” The door is closed. The two stand before it, and hesitate.
“Jack, what about Castiel?” Dean asks.
“That’s a relief. I’ll let you talk to Patience. Here,” Jodie says.
“You were dead,” Jason tells Dean. “I felt the wind change. The clock turned back, the ashes reassembled. What happened had no longer happened, and somehow, you, were alive.”
“No way - he snores,” Dean says. Charlie laughs.
Jack makes his way over to the computer. He sits down and leans forward, squinting at the computer screen. He sniffles. He clicks a few times, drags, then clicks a few more times, darting his eyes between the screen and Dean’s corpse. Jack makes one final click.
“Eh, it never had much ‘magic’ to begin with. Except for the, uh, actually magic.”
“Don’t do it,” Jack mutters. “I already owe them over 100 dollars.”
“Yes, that poor dear,” the receptionist. “I didn’t know her personally. You might have more luck talking to her sorority sisters.”
“What, then?”
“Your injury, of course.”
“This isn’t about him. It’s about you, hightailing it,” Dean says.
“I don’t think you understand,” Cas grunts. “This isn’t an order, it’s a courtesy. When I close those doors, it’ll wipe out every angel left on the planet. You included.”
The boy on the right raises his hand. He has a round face and scraggly brown hair. There are circles under his eyes.
“Listen, I’m flattered.”
“I think I know what this is about,” Jason says calmly.
Sam trots back to the main room, and harshly whispers something to the others. Dean and Charlie lag behind.
“There’s a ramp out the back, dumbass,” Katie replies.
Sam’s heart sinks.
“Sam. I don’t think I’m going anywhere.” Dean tries to stay poised, for Sam’s sake, but he can’t help but wince.
“Cas,” he says. “Where the hell are you. Get your ass over here.” He looks up. Nothing. Sam looks at him incredulously. Dean huffs in annoyance.
“Okay well,” Dean stutters. “Just - don’t look at me. Your googly eyes give me the heebie jeebies.” Sam raises his hands in surrender and turns around.
“What did he say?” Dean asks.
“I don’t know. I was hoping you would be the one to tell me,” Jason says. Jason crouches down so that he is eye level with Dean. “Whatever it is, it has an interest in you.”
“Crap. So did I.”
“Yup,” Dean replies tersely.
“Not die, I guess.”
“You wouldn’t hurt him,” Castiel says.
“Shut the fuck up,” says Katie, gesturing the gun at Sam. “Olivia - tie him up.”
“Kids always think they’re more grown-up than they are,” Jason replies. “But it’s good for them to make their own choices, no matter how much we as parents want to step in.”
“Who won?” Dean asks.
“Kinda like Dad’s journal,” Dean says.
“You have something on your face.”
“I don’t know,” Cas lies.
“...See ya.”
“Dean?” calls out a breathless voice from behind him. Dean turns to see Jason, returning from a jog.
“Come here,” Cas says. He licks his thumb and extends it towards Jack.
“It’s not a bad feeling,” Dean says. “When I wake up in the morning, I expect to be alone. But there he is.”
“Now, Sammy, you know we shouldn’t touch our private parts.”
“Yeah, two of them. A boy and a girl,” Jason replies. He repeats the extending motion on Dean’s other leg, then brings it up, gently stretching his hamstrings. “You got kids?”
“Y’know,” Hannah says. “I thought for a second, that maybe I saw a ghost.” The brothers exchange glances.
“Wow, you guys are all awful at surprises,” Eileen laughs.
Sam is making breakfast when Dean and Cas join him in the kitchen.
“Olivia-”
“Dude, are you okay?”
Charlie leaves in the early evening. Sam and Dean offer to let her stay the night, but she insists - her stuff is still at the motel, and she wants to get an early start the next morning before she heads home. Sam escorts her to her car.
“The events that were supposed to happen on the day of your death, and the time after, are encrypted here on this file,” Jessica says.
"Sure," Cas says, eyeing the hallway. He has a meeting with Jack, and he doesn't want to be late.
Across the street, the door to the church opens, and Cas wanders out. He’s wearing his trench coat over a sky-blue sweater. Immediately confronted by the sun, he also shields his eyes with his hand.
“Could be something,” Dean interjects. “I’ll come with.”
"I understand your dilemma,” Cas replies. “The impulse is to grab the world and mangle it into shape. This is what I tried to do when I was in your position, but I was too prideful. It only caused more suffering.”
“Whatever that means,” Jodie remarks.
“You - doing all this stuff for me. You’re my little brother - I’m the one who’s supposed to be taking care of you,” Dean says. “I don’t like that you keep coming home hurt, and I can’t do anything about it.”
“Yeah no worries,” Dean replies. “We’ll catch you later.”
“Cas,” he continues. “Whatever’s going on, we can help. We’re here now, and we miss you. Just, ghost-appear like you did in front of that lady, and maybe we could talk. Please.” Silence. Dean buries his face in his hands.
“So this is how you see me,” Cas says. Waves lap at his shoes. He sits upright.
“He told me,” Dean says. “That he loved me.”
“It could be nothing but -”
“Are you sure?”
“And how’s that working out for you?” Sam inquires tentatively.
Miracle keeps them company. With all the free time on their hands, there’s plenty of time to take her for walks. She gets more love and affection than a dog can ask for. Sam and Dean find time for recreation, time to breath. Sam takes up jogging, learns to paint- badly, but it’s something. Dean plays the guitar. They have movie nights, marathoning old westerns. Classic horror movies make their way into the pile too and, after all these years, they make Dean jump. Sam pokes fun of him, Dean showers him with popcorn. (They’ll have time to clean it off the floor). But underneath it all, Sam is worried, and Dean feels it too. Being idle - it’s wrong.
“That son of a bitch,” Dean mutters.
“‘Sup Dean,” Claire says.
Dean tosses on a stiff black jacket on his way out. It’s one of those days where the air is cold but the sun is oppressive. He squints in the sunlight, and the corners of his eyes wrinkle. He pulls a phone out of his back pocket and makes a call.
“Dean Smith?” The doctor asks.
“Remember that indestructible box we found?”
“Dean, just let me -” Sam grabs the laptop. They both pull on it, but Sam manages to pull it away. He opens it.
“Apparently not,” Olivia says.
just won’t die!” she says accusingly.
“Well, sorry to break it to you but I don’t have any part in this,” Dean replies with a shrug.
Castiel leans in and kisses Dean, insistent and hot, pushing him backwards onto the bed. Crying out with relief and a hundred other emotions tangled together, Dean pulls him close. He’s drowning for more, clawing and pulling at Castiel’s clothing.
“My Prince,” Castiel whispers eventually, “I cannot sleep. I burn at night. Every thought is filled with the ecstasy of having you under me after all these years. If you think that I will allow you to push me away…”
Dean frowns. “Gabe, what is going on?”
“Not Dad’s way. He’s got to bottle everything up and solve it himself.” Dean shrugs and eyes Sam. “How well do you know this Charlie, anyhow? Does she know that she might get hurt?”
Nonchalantly walking along the opposite edge of the store, he keeps an eye on them through the mirror. The girls are grabbing bottles and wrenching them open, drinking a few swallows and then throwing them on the ground, laughing when they shatter. Other customers go running out the front, leaving the place almost empty. Dean searches out the leader again and their eyes lock. He’s quiet, watching Dean, standing stock still as people run around him, chased by the women and the chortling fool. The fool’s movements draw Dean’s eyes away because he’s headed to the front.
Charlie squints at the designs Sam has up on the projection. “Where does your Grandfather come into it?”
Dean grabs the sunscreen out of his brother’s hand irritably. “No. Sam, I love him.”
“It’s good? In what universe is it good?”
“Dean! You’re okay! I was worried all night, you shit. Where are you?”
Dean and Cas look at it for a minute, as if daring one another. He knows that Cas won’t do it if Dean doesn’t, and suddenly his need to see Cas naked out here in the woods is so urgent that he can’t strip fast enough. Castiel feasts his eyes, but makes no move to get undressed himself. Shrugging, Dean lowers himself into the pool.
“Let me worry about that. Just...just come with me. Put the books down, and let me bring you. There’s cows and sheep. Junk food. Ladies fighting over who won the pie recipe contest.”
Sam fiddles with the tablet so it shows some pictures of a trashed apartment. “After you were attacked, I tried to talk to Kevin on the comm but he wouldn’t answer. So Cas and I went to see him. He’s gone.”
The sun is scorching, but at least the cloying humidity is gone, leaving the weather perfectly suited to spraying everything with water. Anna and her sorority sisters bounce back and forth cheerfully, hauling buckets of soapy water to and fro, leaning too far over to clean cars with oversized sponges. They’d also wrangled Dean’s brother into the mix, Sam’s ridiculous bulging  muscles drawing more than half the female customers. Gabe somehow managing to avoid shirtless beefcake duty, works to coordinate everything so the line goes smoothly.
Crap, it’s gone.
It’s not easy to avoid people on the way out. The crowds outside are surging against the ropes, shouting. The flash bulbs going off and the sounds of distant sirens are confusing. He grips Castiel’s arm tightly as they duck into the waiting limo.
Sam rubs his forehead. “We just need an image of the place inside your head and superimpose it.”
Dean is silent, sneaking into the room and liberating the clipboard with a list of cell assignments, one eye on the monitors. They flip from view to view, showing no one in any of the cells until it gets to the one he’s assuming holds Castiel - he can’t see the man himself, but someone is moving in the darkness there, and the clipboard confirms it. Dean lifts the keys silently from the guard’s belt, fingers wrapped around the keyring to keep them from jingling. As he does, he notices his breath coming out in visible puffs, the air suddenly freezing. Ice begins to form on the monitor screens and the lights go ballistic. Whatever ghost is manifesting itself here, Dean has to get to Castiel quickly.
Sam plugs in a string of purple and orange lights, and holds out the other end for Cas to start hanging them.  “What about the guy playing you?”
Dean opens his mouth to answer, struggling against the force pinning him. The King leans close, the smell of rotten flesh filling Dean’s nostrils, making him gag.
Dean swallows hard.
Dean sits back down, smirking. “Well, that was… something.”
Dean falls into the carefully neutral expression and tone he’s been taught by his father to adopt when talking about this subject with non family, ever since he could even talk. “To what book are you referring? Sam has a few, but I think they’re mostly implant catalogues or stories about ponies.”
Dean is all nerves now, he swallows hard. “Uh, hi..Cas, can we talk?”
“Hello? Gabe?”
“Alone,” the one on the right, green hair, laughs.
Sam looks away. “Look, it’s late. We can talk about it tomorrow. You have some, uh, catching up to do. I guess.”
“Fuck, Arthur,” Dean pants. He’s on the defensive and losing, pushed backwards until he falls against the altar. Distantly, he realizes that it’s cold to the touch. “You really just adore the sound of your own voice. I fight for my country and for love. You’re just a dick.”
Cracking a smile, Castiel cups Dean’s cheek in his hand. “Did you seriously come here for me? You know you’re a tool, right?”
Castiel wraps his hand around Dean’s throat. “You need to seriously re-evaluate your position, Your Highness. You belong to me first, and your country second.”
“Sounds like you need help from Sam, or maybe even some of his friends. I’ll have a talk with him when I wake up.”
Dean groans.
Castiel wraps a hand around his own slick, tortured cock, pumping. “What if I ask for your loyalty?”
Gabriel’s on his phone. “Damn, people move fast. There’s already a video of this on Twitter.”
Dean runs, reaching for his gun and setting it to special rounds. It doesn’t have the same cleanness that a machete does, but he doesn’t have that luxury right now. He can deal with being covered in Vampire brains and blood if he’s careful.
Castiel nods. “The same, every time I have been in it, though with slight variations that I suspect depend on mood.”
Dean grins. “C’mon, just give me a minute.”
Castiel wraps his fingers around Dean’s throat, smiling when he goes still. “For now, my King, you need to be taught a lesson about civility.”
Dean smiles tightly. “Distract me.”
A shadow passes over Cas’ eyes. He pulls back to stand, arms tightly crossed, leaving Dean to haul himself unsteadily to his feet unaided.
“You had an affair. With Ketch. Believe me, Mom, he fucking noticed.”
“We plan. I wasn’t really expecting Ketch to throw a public tantrum like this. It really makes him look guilty, so we need to readjust. The coronation is tomorrow, and if he overreacts, I worry that he might order his guard to hurt any of the people outside that don’t like the idea of a murderer on the throne.”
Dean grins around a mouthful. “It’s the fair, you can skip the health food for once. Calories don’t count here.”
Castiel sits up in a smooth motion, his hands sliding up Dean’s arms. “Is that what you want to talk about, my prince?”
Sam shakes his head. “Shut up, shut up, Dean, shut up.”
Dean makes a so-so gesture. “See, our country, like most of Europe, is overrun with monsters. But we happen to sit on some very interesting holy relics and sites. The monarchy here has been training its people to combat monsters for centuries.
Cas pulls him down for a kiss and Dean can’t stop the strangled sob that rips out of him before pushing him. Shoving him, as hard as he can. He spits for good measure. “Listen, I don’t know how to tell you this any more plainly. I hate you, you disgust me. Go home and wait for the ending you deserve.”
“I think I get it...you’re saying that my mind is filling in things it remembers about a day.”
Castiel tilts his head quizzically. It’s an endearing gesture, here in private. In public, it would be the end of them both. Dean gestures up and down his body. He’s still wearing the clothing he’d been in for his trip to the store. It’s so soaked with blood that it’s stiff, like cardboard. He suspects his hair is the same.
Instead he just forces a laugh. “You’ll deserve the gloating and you know it. So what’s the word?”
Charlie moves out of the way and has Cas put the machines down and go back out for more. She starts fiddling with them, Sam looking on with interest.
“Nah, not money. She can get all of that she wants. She wants a look at the book.”
Gabriel shrugs. “I know a few tricks.”
Dean takes a long, deep breath, and Cas pushes him down to the root. Dean chokes until he manages to relax his throat, to let Cas hold him in place. Instead of thrusting, Cas uses his face like a toy, slowly fucking it up and down on his cock.
His mother eyes him. “No it isn't. Listen, I loved your father, but you know as well as I do how absolute he could be. In the end, he didn’t need me quite as much as he could have, and it broke us apart. So I… I’m not proud of it, but he didn’t even notice.”
Instead, he’s already decided to get off the train early and hike through the countryside until he reaches the Wallachstein Estate and set up camp there. It will be easier to figure out his next move when he’s amongst friends.
The door opens and shuts spasmodically, the light within the elevator’s shell a dull hellscape-red from the emergency lights that somehow have never burnt out. A young homeless net-rigger had settled in it ages ago, slowly transforming the tiny space. Now, thick wires run over the inside like well organized tentacles, monitors mounted on all three walls. She reclines in a beanbag chair, criminally thin, her arms filled with illicitly modified ports with thin wires like veins snaking out of them. No one will ever chase her out or fix the elevator, and he’s kind of happy she’s found a place. Like most net-riggers, she does something complicated and illegal, but it could be anything, really; he can’t understand half of what she says on any given day. Dean jerks his chin in greeting and she does the same, red hair falling in her thin face, her eyes glowing in the gloom. Watching as he goes down the stairs.
“Look, we have a lot of monks with time on their hands.”
“That was indeed very gross,” Cas concurs, chewing contently on his own piece of veggie bacon. Dean straightens his back and keeps eating his eggs.
Dean looks at Sam, and for a brief moment, his obnoxious little brother pokes through the facade of an overgrown, adult man. But it fades. Dean pulls Sam into a tight hug. He balls up his fists and presses his face into Sam’s shoulder. He pulls away, but keeps his hand clasped on Sam’s arm.
Cas steps forward. Popcorn crunches beneath his foot. A breeze passes through, carrying leaves, causing the corn stalks to sway. It lifts the edge of Cas’ coat and rustles his hair. He sighs, and tilts his head.
Dean is pissed, but he can tell he’s scaring this girl. Sam gives him a look of disappointment. They have an argument in the form of facial expressions. Sam wins. Dean sighs in defeat. He shoves Rachel off of him, and she topples backwards, heaving in relief. Dean pockets the knife and takes out his pistol.
Eileen, Dean, and Cas emerge through a door in the back of the room. It’s a makeshift classroom - navy plastic chairs with desks attached to the arms form rows of semicircles along the linoleum floor. There’s a sizable audience - mostly young. A projector hangs from the ceiling, displaying a powerpoint slide on the far wall, titled “Werewolves and Vampires: Cure?” and displaying a photo of a blood-filled vial. The corner of the projection catches on Sam, creating a filter of blue light over half his face. He wears a blazer over a flannel, and his hair is tucked behind his ears.
“Woah, careful now,” Dean says. “That’ll actually affect you this time ‘round.”
“That was quite the accident you had. Your brother told me you tripped and fell on a piece of rebar while you were,” she flips through her notepad. “Playing baseball?” Dean flashes a look at Sam, who shrugs.
“Stuffy clothes and no girls allowed?” Charlie teases.
“No no no, don’t move me. Don’t move me,” Dean grunts. “It feels like this thing’s holding me together right now. Just give me a minute.”
“Y’know, I know a guy who’s trying to organize classes on hunting here in Kansas,” Charlie says. “I could hook you up. You two could collaborate.”
“Next lesson is on ghouls - I want you all to read chapter 3 in your textbooks to prepare,” Sam calls out. His students are already packing up their bags and talking among themselves. Dean hops over Cas and Eileen’s laps and makes his way through the crowd.
“Well,’ Sam starts, flipping through one of the books. “There were actually a lot of healing spells, but most aren’t feasible- Dodo bird feathers, moon rocks, stuff like that. And I figure you’d want to skip the ones that involve rabbits.”
“Intoxication, yes, I remember,” Cas says. He leans forward. “I’ve had a long day.”
Jason jabs his blade at Cas. Cas grabs his arm mid-swing. Jason’s blade clatters to the ground as Cas lifts him off the ground. He struggles to free himself - kicking and wriggling. His demeanor is that of a captured animal.
“He’s a weirdo,” Dean says affectionately. “He’s getting the hang of the human thing, though.”
They hug. Charlie gets into her car, and rolls down the window.
“Wow dean, I didn’t know you were so environmentally conscious.”
“Alright,” Jack says.
“Are you… making pie?” Dean asks.
“Your first PT session is Thursday.”
There are only a few other patrons in the diner - a group of drunk teenagers, and a police officer. Dean and Cas sit on opposite sides of a squeaky red booth, where an irritable waitress takes their orders. Dean orders two of the most elaborate burgers on the menu, along with a couple beers.
Dean rushes down the stairs to greet everyone. He is bombarded by hugs and smiles and pats on the back, not to mention the paws of an attention-seeking dog. It’s chaotic and overwhelming. Dean is overjoyed.
“I think I found something,” Sam says.
The girls groan.
But he doesn’t need to. In an instant, a silver blade emerges through the werewolf’s chest. He chokes. Blood drips from his fanged mouth and the life drains from his eyes. The blade retracts, and he falls to his knees, revealing a person standing behind him - the frizzy-haired girl from Sam’s class. She looks absolutely thrilled. Her bloody hands cradle the blade to her chest.
“Naturally.”
“That’s good to hear buddy,” Dean says, slapping him on the back. Dean takes a bite of bacon.
“Hey Charlie,” Sam says.
It’s Jason. Jason is healing him.
“Then why did -”
They settle back into the embrace, fitting their faces into the crooks of each others’ necks. It doesn’t feel like there was anything before this, and it doesn’t feel like there will be anything after. They just breathe, and hold each other close.
A click.
“But we found one that looks promising, here,” Sam continues. He jabs his finger on the open page.
“You did good, Sammy,” Dean says. His chest is full of pride, and it shows on his face.
Dean pulls himself to his feet. He walks forward, higher up on the hill, and with each step his boot sinks slightly into the muddy ground. There’s something looming in the distance - Something sturdy, the size of a skyscraper, obscured by the mist. Dean squints and it comes into focus. A figure. A person. Oil-black wings.
“Well don’t!” Sam says. He throws the first aid kit down on the counter. “You’re so obsessed with protecting me, it’s pathological.”
“What the hell are these things?” Dean shouts.
“You know what we want, Sam Winchester,” Katie sneers. “We want you to bring them back.”
“What?”
“It’s Miracle, we found him.” Charlie scrunches her face up as Miracle tries to lick it. She looks back at Dean, beaming, and gives him a hug. She smells like caramel.
“Dude, are you okay? That almost got you,” Charlie says.
“I was wondering if you could tell me… where I can get a bite to eat.”
“Crazy is good,” Sam says. “Believe me, whatever it is, we’ve seen crazier.” The woman looks at Sam, then back at Dean. She opens the door wider, and gestures with her head.
“I’m worried about you being alone here,” Sam says.
“Sam?” Jack calls out. Nothing. Jack puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Suddenly, they’re in the kitchen. Sam is mixing something in a bowl. He’s covered in flour.
“Sure, just peachy,” Dean grunts. He looks out the window with his arms crossed.
“Maybe,” Dean replies, “What’s it to ya?”
“I’m destructing it.”
“Jessica?” Dean says.
“Dean?” Sam says.
“That’s right,” Sam replies. “What can you tell me about her disappearance?”
“Happy to be included,” Dean replies. “But that didn’t do jack shi-”
“It’s fine, it’s just flour,” Jack protests, recoiling. He tries to push Castiel away, but Cas persists.
“Sam, can I help you bake?” Jack asks. Sam glances at Dean nervously, then flashes Jack a warm smile.
“Helped how?” Sam asks.
“Myself, I guess. How I felt,” Dean says. “That I liked it.”
“I know, but I’d like to talk.”
“Angela and Beleth,” Katie says.
After disposing of the werewolf’s body, they’re on the road. They arrive at the bunker in their separate cars - Sam and Eilene following behind the impala. Keys jangle, doors creak open and slam shut. They make their way to the front door of the bunker. As Sam fits the key in the door, a faint light emits from Dean’s amulet. Dean doesn’t notice at first, but he does notice Cas, looking nervously at his chest. Dean looks down and sees that the amulet is glowing.
“Long pig,” Dean says, pouring a cup of coffee.
“He’s awake,” Sam tells her. Dean rolls his eyes.
“Hard, without you,” Sam says, gesturing to the scratches on his face.
“You ready?” Sam asks.
“What the hell was that?” Dean yells.
“Well,” Roger says, lowering his voice. “I heard his old man collected cars - nice vintage ones. Rumor has it he sold them all, used the money to start fresh.”
“Which one?”
“I missed you,” Cas says with a smirk.
“Dean?”
Cas scoffs, and a smile appears on his face. He puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
“Ironic that his, our, ability to self-determine was brought about by a mistake.”
“Cas!” Dean exclaims. He grabs Cas by the coat and pulls him into an embrace, resting his face against Cas’ starchy, cotton shirt. It smells like grass and cedar. Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s soft hair, and rests his palm on the back of his head.
“Jack!” Sam cries out.
"Who do you root for? Who do you hope will win the race?"
"The answer can't be to do nothing, though."
“Dude, you could’ve gotten killed,” Sam says.
“Well, yeah. Seemed like that was working.” Dean sighs and looks around self consciously.
“He’s not smiting demons, he’s banishing them,” Jack says. “He was, at least.”
“Don’t you do that. Don’t you dare. Coming back here just to fuck off again. What about me, huh? What is this, Cas? Is this love?”
“Cas!” Dean calls out again. Castiel watches as the fog sinks lower into the cityscape. He lifts his head to face Dean. His eyes are closed.
A pause. Dean lets his anger simmer. Then Sam, softly:
“That’s where you come in,” Katie says. “You’re gonna bring us to the angel, and he’s gonna bring Angela back.”
“C’mon, let’s get out of here,” Sam says. Still with his gun trained on Katie, he picks up the caged chicken and puts it on Dean’s lap. They turn to leave.
“Cas, I need you to hear me. I don’t know if you can hear me I - I don’t know what to do. Since you left, since you sacrificed yourself, I can’t live like this. If I had known, I would have stopped you. I should have stopped you.” Dean is shaking. He grabs the beer bottle next to him, takes a final swig, and smashes it to the floor.
Charlie links arms with Dean, and guides him to his feet. They walk arm-in-arm through the library, all the way to where the telescope sits. It’s just far enough to be out of earshot from the rest of the group. They sit on the steps.
Dean’s eyes open. The cool air stings and makes them water. He finds himself in a white room. It smells of disinfectant, mixed with the blood still lingering in his nose. There’s buzzing and beeping and distant chatter, and the sound of clacking footsteps on linoleum. The blinding assault of fluorescent lights is broken by a blurry, oversized shadow - Sam. He paces back and forth, combing his fingers nervously through his floppy hair. He notices Dean’s stirring, and comes rushing to his side. With that, his face comes into focus at last. Big puppy-dog eyes and a dumb expression of wonder.
Eileen and Cas weave through the crowd, and make their way to the front of the room.
Dean is alone in his room, and he’s drinking. This combination - beer and rumination - isn’t kind on the stomach. Even Dean knows that. He also knows what the alternative is, but it’s something he was trying to avoid.
“You’re sending the troops home,” Dean says. “No more demons, so of course, no more angels.”
“I’m the furthest thing from mad,” Dean says. “You saved my ass.”
“So where is Cas now?” Dean asks, not missing a beat.
“I do,” Dean says.
“Curious? Curious about what?” Sam asks.
“Don’t tell Sam,” Dean says.
“He’s getting dessert,” Cas says.
“You guys are having a potluck?” Dean asks.
“In that case, I’m not asking this time,” Dean says. “I’m telling you. Stay.”
“Cas said that some of the angels would go home, but he’d have to show down with the ones who didn’t. I have a feeling Jason isn’t leaving Earth any time soon.”
Dean squeezes Miracle’s ears affectionately, then rolls out the door. He gives Sam a pat on the arm on his way out.
“What do you mean?” Sam asks.
A moment later Sam is helping to lift Dean from his bed, his legs sliding across the hospital sheets, and being deposited into an ugly hospital wheelchair. He hates being manhandled like this, but there’s not much he can do. Not before long he’s inside of a clunky, whirring machine. There come flashes of bright light and the loud thunk thunk thunk of the magnet. It sounds like the hollow beating of wings. He thinks of Cas.
“I’m fine, Sam,” Dean says. He stands up fully and brushes off his thighs.
“It’s fine! It’s fine. I’ll see you later. I love you,” Jack says. With that, he disappears.
“To celebrate,” Dean says, lifting his beer. Cas does the same. “Welcome home buddy.”
Cas savors the last moments of the kiss, then pushes Dean away as if against his own will. Dean breathes in shaky, heavy breaths, and looks into Cas’ eyes. He tries to speak, but the words won’t come. There are none left to say.
“You could say that.”
“Wow - the big apple?”
“Excuse, Ms. Williams, is it?” Dean flashes the badge, Sam follows suit. “FBI. We’d like to ask you a few questions about a break-in that happened last week.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks gruffly.
Jason guides Dean to a room with large windows. There are a few other people there. Jason guides Dean to the end of the room, and helps him up into the therapy table. Dean sees a woman bouncing on an exercise ball.
“Jack, you have no idea how happy I am to see you,” Dean says. Jack grins.
Sam sighs, and looks off at the houses.
“Yeah, and it turns out I can speak, too,” Dean adds.
“You should find other hunters to go with you next time.” Another swing of the crowbar, another bang.
“That’s a tough age,” Jason comments.
“That’s not what I’m talking about,” Jason says. His expression fills with curious wonder. “You don’t know, do you?”
“With all the other angels, yeah,” Dean replies. “Turn left.”
Cas uncorks the vial. He places his fingertips under Jason’s chin, tilting his head back just so, and positions the vial against his blood-stained lips. From Jason’s mouth, a white effervescent smoke emerges. It flows out of his mouth, swirling into the vail. As the last of it escapes, Jason falls back. Castiel returns the cork to the vail, and stashes it away in his coat. He places two fingers on Jason’s forehead. His wounds clear up. Cas extends a hand. Jason accepts it. Castiel helps him to his feet.
Dean’s ears perk up. There’s a smell in the room - he should have known. Jodie retrieves a stack of pizza boxes from a chair and plops them on the table.
“Dean, who is this woman,” Cas demands.
“We’d love to,” Cas says.
He gets in the car, and drives off.
“How is Heaven?” Cas asks.
“So what are you, huh?” Dean asks. “A witch? A reaper?”
Sam calls campus police with an anonymous tip - he tells them he heard gunshots, and saw some girls burying what looked like a body in the sorority house’s backyard. Afterwards, they bring the chicken to the main building. A janitor meets them by the door and takes it, assuring them he’d bring it to the poultry research center after he’s done. They head back to the car. It’s late dark now - stars twinkle above them. The air is thin. Sam drives.
“Hello Sam.”
Cas relaxes his grip, and drops Jason onto the tarmac.
“It sounds like the story was meant to end with your death, but whatever Jack did to the computer made it so the story couldn’t end. All this almost dying is the story trying to fix that.”
“Jack, are you responsible for this? Did you change Dean’s fate?” Cas asks.
“Look, Bobby went through the same thing, remember?” Sam says. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Yeah well you - you -” Dean stammers. He gives up, and slams the door in Sam’s face.
“Look, Dean, I’m sorry. Whatever it is,” Cas stammers. Dean takes a step forward.
“Uhm, no you won’t,” Sam says. “You’re not exactly in fighting conditions.”
“Actually, Death now,” she clarifies. “There was a vacancy, thanks to this drama queen.” She gestures towards Cas.
“Oh, we know,” Dean says.
“Sounds like you two have been buying into the ghost stories. Nothing like that has been going on, this is a quiet town.”
Cas nods in acknowledgement, and makes his way to Jack's office. Like the rest of this section of heaven, the changes are minimal. Most starkly, the throne has been replaced by a collection of brightly colored bean bag chairs. Jack reclines, sunken into a blue bean bag, wearing a mauve t-shirt, on which are printed the words, "Not Today Satan”. His hands are folded in his lap. His eyes are distant, and glow yellow.
“For real. I can’t deal with another world-threatening cosmic threat,” Jason says, sauntering over to a nearby grey Ford Fiesta. “Back when the apocalypse hit, I had to miss a Vampire Weekend concert. Never again.”
“According to who?” Sam asks.
Patience is cut off. There’s more commotion on the other end of the line.
“I thought you called me to catch up. Why do I feel like I’m being used?” Jack says. Dean’s face drops.
“I don’t know,” Dean says, lowering his voice again. “I don’t know what to think. He’s my best friend.”
Jason puts a hand on Dean’s knee. Dean jerks his wheelchair back.
“I’m gonna start off with passive range of motion,” Jason says. “Nothing to do with building your strength - it’s just gonna help get rid of stiffness so you keep your flexibility. That okay?”
“How’d they even get you down here?” Sam asks.
There’s commotion outside the house. The door opens. Hannah emerges with the baby in her arms, her husband behind her with suitcases in hand. Clambering, they pack everything into the car, shut the doors, and drive off.
“Yeah…?”
"Jack?" Cas says, knocking on the open door. Jack blinks, and his eyes are normal again.
“Uh, yeah, kind of. I’m still sore from getting, y’know, stabbed.” Dean laughs nervously.
“Cats are incredibly smart. She knows that if she gets ornery, we’ll try to appease her. It’s strategic.”
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam says. “Eileen, did you invite these two?”
“You got that right,” Dean says pointedly. “Those poor rabbits…”
“I just can’t risk losing you again.”
“What is that?” Sam asks.
“Or something like that,” Dylan replies. “She asked me to teach her how to get into the animal research centers - we have a thing, once a year, where we make pledges kill chickens.”
“Yeah, Cas. He’s about to do something really stupid. We need to find him before he does.”
“That’s not what I’m asking.”
“Yeah, of course,” Sam says. “I was just about to make the filling. How’d you like to peel the apples?” Sam offers him the apple peeler.
Dean flows in and out of consciousness. He has to struggle to hold on. He sees figures - hunters - gathering the bodies of the dead vampires. Dean can barely make this out through the dark blotches in his vision. The bodies dragging across the hay sound like crushed polystyrene. Pain shoots through his legs and abdomen. The rest of his body is tingly and numb, cold and buzzing. It hurts to breathe. He’d rather not. Fade out.
“What, you mean like Cas?”
He breathes in and out, willing himself to calm down. “Sam has visions. Always has had them. When we were growing up, we agreed not to tell Dad because he would have gone ballistic, and you would’ve told Dad. I figured he’d told you anyways though, at some point.”
“I renounce it!” Dean, eyes glassy and crazed,   tries in vain to reach Castiel’s lips, whimpering for a kiss.
“Cas,” he says quietly, “did not kill my father.”
Dean snorts. “Well, this is where the family secrets part comes in. Both Henry and Dad are secret-keeping assholes. We hoard them, like demented squirrels. Chances are that Grandpa only told them enough to repair the angels, and oversaw anything major on his own.
Whatever it was that Dad and Kevin did to him has been just about the only tech his body hasn’t violently rejected, the comm being the only other blessed exception. Catching sight of the twisted scars criss-crossing his body, he’s reminded that includes nanite surgery as well. God help him if he ever needs something major repaired. Even the time he’d had a huge block of machinery dropped on him, he had  to spend time healing the old fashioned way with a cast. Sam hasn’t stopped laughing at him yet.
“Well, he is. Besotted. All Gabe can talk about is how pissed their mother is that Cas isn’t ever coming back to marry a nice rich girl.”
In the back Becky calls out, “And my gramma!”
Castiel stands over Dean, bellowing, “Sam!”
“No, it isn’t. In fact, get everyone together, we should talk about that.”
Ketch looks at him carefully. “That’s not what I’d been led to believe. And I saw you with him last night in the study. You still love him. You tried to rescue him, for God’s sake.”
Dean perks up. “The naked spot?”
A few minutes later, Gabriel comes down the stairs, alone. His blonde hair is lank and tangled as if he hasn’t bathed or stopped running nervous hands in it for days. Aside from being a bit older than Dean remembers, he’s a familiar and friendly sight. Dean goes to embrace him, but Gabriel takes a step back, eyeing him.
“I know, and I can’t say how sorry I am.” He rests his head on her shoulder. She puts her arm around him.
Dean takes stock of his body. It aches and he feels… crusty. “So I didn’t dream all of that.” His throat hurts, as if he’s been screaming.
He says, “They’re coming.”
“No,” he says, and the room lights up around him, white and electric with angelic lightning.
They come out onto the porch, and Dean’s struck dumb for a second. Cas is washing a car, shirtless, covered in soap and water, and he’s wearing the smallest pair of running shorts Dean has ever seen.
Dean is fading, and he knows it. He reaches up and pats Sam’s face clumsily, smearing his blood on his cheek. “Take care of Mom, Sammy. Be a good king.”
Dean grins while taking a big bite of a twizzler, chewing with his mouth open. “Don’t worry, Sammy. We won’t let her get you.”
Castiel just watches him and it makes him angrier. After everything and he’s still standing all the way over there with that stupid impassive look on his face. He just wants to hit him. Or kiss him. Or both, possibly. A smile lurks along the edges of Castiel’s lips and he shifts his body subtly. Taunting him. He could always read Dean like a book.
“My apologies, your Highness,” Castiel says in his best detached and formal tone, “for discorporating your father. I suspected he meant you harm.”
“Funkytown.”
Preparing for a run through the woods takes time and thought, so he doesn’t allow himself to think about the ring or the man who gave it to him. He makes sure the rifle is loaded with silver bullets, that his knife and his handgun are easily reached, that there is nothing extraneous hanging down on his pack or his person that’s easily ripped or caught. Then, and only then, does he kiss the ring quietly, blue eyes and the memory of a startled and happy laugh shoring up his resolve. He jogs, entering the woods as quietly as he can, but not really caring too much about that. The monsters don’t need to hear him to find him. A steady jog will get him through easier.
“Look, you were gone! And Dad, he just went into overdrive. The Men of Letters got a foothold and they convinced him that the country’s troubles were because of blood purity.”
Dean smiles as Castiel pulls him off the dock and into the cool, dark water.
“I guess I had to work myself up to it again. Well, Sam helped. I dunno, Cas, I mean. You’re all class, and I’m dirt poor, and I come from a really weird family. I guess I just wasn’t sure...”
Sam looks disturbed, his eyes suspiciously shiny. “When-when we were kids you found this postcard. It was a tourism ad, really, for some tiny place in the mountains. But it was so pretty. You asked Dad if we could go and he was-”
“Your vision has gotten a little odd.”
“Yes, alright. But go to my room, not the Rose Room. That room locks from the outside. You can call it a command, if you want, Wallachstein.”
Most of the mountain is park land with roads cutting through. Over the years the locals have found and ‘claimed’ some of the best spots to picnic or swim in the cool of the trees, and ferreting out these places is a game for some students. The fact that Dorothy and Charlie have learned the location of this place has become one of their best kept secrets; if too many of their classmates knew, everyone would be naked here. Neither Cas or Dean has gone yet. Too chicken, maybe. Too busy.
“Now what?” Sam asks.
“How are you working on a Saturday? It’s Saturday. Save all that crap for Sunday. I’m bored!”
Cas just smiles, putting the bowl on the floor behind himself. He steals Dean’s beer right out of his hand, taking a long swallow and ignoring his indignant squawk. Slowly, he leans down to ghost a kiss over Dean’s lips, whispering, “Lie down.”
“Sneaky bastard. Well, it’s good for you that I was able to beat Naomi off with a stick, then. I’ll be there in five.”
That gets Sam’s undivided attention. “He said that? Those words?”
“I’m sorry, Charlie. If you’re not too mad at me, I could use some perspective?”
She kisses the top of his head, her perfume light and flowery. He inhales the smell. “Yes, darling. No matter what. Nothing could ever change that.”
“Are you sure you don’t have another reason?”
Castiel snorts. “Yes, it certainly was. Are you planning on sleeping with a guard nearby this evening, because I do think Ketch will come to murder you.”
“N...n...n…”
Charlie and Rowena share a baffled glance, but Dean is already laughing. Dammit, Dad. When they look at him, he just shrugs. “It’s old tech hiding inside new tech. A simple and low tech way to encrypt some information is to… well, do you remember those ‘find thirteen differences in these pictures’ games as a kid?”
The next few moments are filled with breathless laughter as they wrestle in the pool, ending with Cas pressed against the side of the large rock, partly under the waterfall as Dean kisses him, hard and wanting against Cas’ thigh.
They begin bickering with each other, and Cas, laughing, lets go of Dean.
Cas crosses his arms. Desperately, Dean says, “The pirate ship? The swing ride?”
She slaps Dean across the face, snarling, “Lies, more lies! You’re unfit to rule, unfit to stand with this family.”
By the warm light of the lamp, he can see that he wasn’t entirely correct. There are small changes. New books in a pile next to the bed, a few knick knacks on the shelves. The wall, formerly covered in movie posters, now has a poster from seemingly every production that Dean has been a part of in the states, no matter how large his part. Castiel has been down here for years, missing him. Not moving on. It hurts, almost more than any wound on his body. He hadn’t moved on either, but he had somehow expected that Castiel would - Castiel, with his flashing, imperious eyes, his sinfully disarranged hair, his elegant hands. Dean had thought that he would have someone new within months.
“Wait, you talked to Sam about my lake dream?”
“Tell me Mom. Tell me how the King died.
Castiel licks his lips, eyes still closed. Whispering, he asks, “Tell me again.”
Then his brain catches up. “What’s the movie?”
As predicted, it’s a drunken Gabriel, along with a crowd. Ignoring Dean’s angry protest, he pushes through into the apartment, a steady stream of their (also drunk) friends following him. Gabe bounces his eyebrows at Dean, giving his boxer-shorts-only outfit a leering look. Someone turns on the lights, and someone else changes the movie, and the night is over. Whatever it was going to be.
Sam pushes a greasy container of Lo Mein at him, but the smell of it nearly makes him hurl. Dean pushes it back towards his brother who levels a pissed look that would’ve flattened anyone who didn’t know him when he was in Middle School. As it is, Dean just gives him the finger.
to be some place close.
He starts forward, but Cas’ hand squeezes, and he stops. Ketch laughs. “Still held in thrall by this creature, I see.”
Castiel laughs in joy, pumping his cock. “Open your mouth, my prince.”
Cas, face impassive, rolls over on his side so he can look Dean in the face. “You need to decide what you want. Ketch is poised to take over the country, succession be damned. You should kill him.”
Castiel stands, eyes narrowed. “Don’t apologize for the sins of your Grandfather, Dean. I am going to free my siblings from their enslavement, even if I have to kill her.”
Dean throws his phone at the wall, making it crack and go dead. The room behind him has gone silent. He buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”
Castiel squints. Sam’s already moving, excitedly explaining as he does. “Voodoo dolls are a form of sympathetic magic. You are connected to every one of your siblings, by the binding and by your nature, so we use you as a….” He waves his hand, like that explains it. Cas doesn’t look at all informed, so Dean sits him down.
“Okay… well, why haven’t you tried to ask me to marry you again?”
Dean turns the wheel, wincing when it makes a low creaking noise that sounds much louder in the tunnel. Peeking around shows a hallway devoid of people. The door lets out past all the entry guards, which was handy when two hormonal teenagers were looking for a place to be alone.
Sam makes a face, passing her a beer. “It’s not friendly to tech, as such. TechMagic, sure, but plain tech? Not so much. It’s like a building made out of Dean. Plus, it’s really out of the way.”
His brother jumps entertainingly. “Fuck, Dean, don’t do that!”
As the car drives off, Dean can’t shake the way his nerves jangle. He skirts around the building and keeps walking past it, all the way to the edge of the estate where the utility sheds are. It doesn’t take long, despite the recent addition of more buildings, to find the right one and break in. When he was a kid, this place was a mess, but it looks like someone efficient has finally organized here. All the same, the royal seal imprinted into the concrete is still there. Dean reaches down into the center of the seal and presses down, turning clockwise as he does. There’s a hiss as the entire thing rotates and pops up, revealing a ladder into another secret tunnel. Seems like their lives have always been defined by secrets and lies.
Sam shakes the spray can. “Close your eyes. None of us want to deal with you with sun poisoning.” He starts to spray sunscreen on Dean’s back and arms. “Look, for what it’s worth, I don’t think he cares about that. I think he’s just waiting to see if you’re going to stick around.”
“Tilt your head back.” Sam moves around him to spray in the front. “This is the longest you’ve ever been with anyone. You have a reputation.”
“I don’t understand, sweetie.”
He goes to collect himself outside, walking around the back of the building where it’s darker, lit only by the occasional light attached to the building. He wishes that he had a cigarette, even though he hasn’t smoked in a long time. He could really use it to steady his nerves.
It’s dark, the moon obscured by bright lazy clouds. It takes a little bit, but Dean finally recognizes where he is. The prison, called ‘the dungeon’ by everyone except his father who had never thought it was funny, sits in a low squat building behind the palace. Over the centuries it’s been used to house Nobles, political prisoners, and the occasional noble-turned-monster, languishing here while the royal family figured out how to deal with them.
“I am going to kill that smug asshole,” he manages through his grinding teeth. “And I don’t get it, that’s not how succession works.”
“You can have any of it!”
Castiel looks at him, stunned for a minute, and slowly says, “That’s not very funny, Dean.”
“They collate lore, come up with cool new ways to fight monsters. We set up a place to train government agents of all kinds to spot them. Every now and then one of them gets a bright idea to infiltrate human governments. It’s most of what we as a country do for cash. It’s more lucrative than you might think. Plus, we export a lot of very tasty wine.”
Castiel leans forward and kisses Dean lightly. “He’s on your side, my Prince. You have to let me go for now. Look at me.”
Dean gets his gear together and carefully uses the secret door into the wine cellar, peeking out the peephole first. He isn’t sure if Gabriel knows about the secret room now, but he doesn’t want to take any chances. It feels like one of the only tenuous links he still has with Castiel, their secret hide-away from everyone and everything.
Dean has no answer for that, so he stays quiet, listening to Castiel control his breathing. Shame, need, and unhappiness war with each other.
Dean wants to say no. With all his being, he wants to tell them to stay out of it, but he can’t. They’ve fought some weird shit by his side and there’s no taking that away from them now.
“I think I’m a little fuzzy on what that might be, Dean.”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe the fact that I’m melting from the inside out?”
“The many thousands of dollars you’ve borrowed for your education were not wasted, I see.”
“He has been, at least for a few weeks, by the state of things there.”
“You’re upset and it’s late. Everything has been so confusing, sweetheart. It happened right outside his home, and honestly, there was a lot of tension there, what with…” She gestures between Cas and Dean vaguely. “Anyway, don’t worry about any of this. We’re getting your room made up right now, and then we can talk in the morning. When everyone isn’t so tired, and, well… overwrought.”
Dean turns away, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Yes, okay, Mom. I am happy that you are happy, I guess. It’s just. Anyone but him. He’s a psychopath.”
He tries to stand, the room spinning again as he does. “Sam must have been pissed at me.”
“I’m not your son.” Dean puts his back to the first tree, ignoring the vibration he imagines he feels from it along his spine. His skin crawls. He wants to run.
Sam laughs despite himself, taking a long drink from the bottle as he thinks through it. “Are you sure you want to outright kill him? Can you? A werewolf is one thing, but Ketch is a human. It would be straight up murder. Are you capable of that?”
“Ah, youth. They have an infinite capacity to party.”
Ketch is on his feet, stumbling away and grabbing one of the swords from the wall. Mitch slumps into the pew and then slides to the ground, life blood spraying from his neck across Castiel, the floor, and several people huddled behind them. Mary grapples with Sam, every inch of her father’s daughter as she fights fiercely to subdue her son. Dean grabs a sword from the other side and stands to face Ketch, a grim smile etched onto his face.
Cas goes to help him get up, but Dean waves him off. He actually feels tremendously better. He suspects that his issue with technology pushed her out of his head entirely.
“Yes, Dean, focus, I’m proposing here.”
Dean closes his eyes against the grief. “No, it was needed. He’d never have wanted to end up like that. Is he… was he. Was that the truth?”
Sam makes a distressed noise, “C’mon you guys, why do you always do this when I’m around? Fine, yes, whatever. I’ll see you next month. Don’t break the country while I’m gone.”
“Come and have a drink and tell me what’s been going on.”
Dean laughs. “I’m in your wine cellar.”
He watches Charlie assemble them. They’re a good team, dedicated to their craft as well as hunting. It’s been a strange few years, but he wouldn’t have traded it for anything. They all sit on the stage facing him, waiting.
Kevin’s voice pipes in through his implanted comm.
Castiel whispers, “It has, several times, and your love changed with it. Go away.”
Dean sneers. “So eager to take the title from him that you’ll let him literally hang for this?”
He starts moving his hips once more in a slow rhythm punctuated by Dean’s own desperate gasps for air.
Dean lets them shut.
Cas, faster than Dean can track, is on top of him, his elegant hand around his throat, squeezing lightly, a promise of violence. Cock hard and pressing against Dean’s belly, he hisses, “No. Beg me. Prove you deserve it. ”
Cas is in his face, now. He smells good. So very good. It’s mesmerizing and he imagines now that he knows how a mouse feels in a snake’s grasp. “You’re lying to me. Or you were lying to me then. Do you even know how to tell the truth anymore, your Highness?”
He isn’t sure what to expect when he gets there. An empty room, maybe. Dean is not at all prepared to find it exactly the way they’d left it. Nearly a decade passed, and it is still the same. Castiel hadn’t done anything to it since he’d returned from University, other than keep it clean. There’s no cobwebs, no weird mold smell. Taking a minute, flooded with nostalgia, he absorbs the sight of everything - his bookshelves, still filled with every play Dean had been obsessed with as a teenager. The ancient oil lamp, filled with oil. The bed, God, the bed. Dean lights the lamp, even though he’d almost be happier in the dark, and sets his flashlight down on the table.
“I should leave you here and take my own pleasure alone. Leave you stuffed with a plug in your ass and wait until you learn to beg me properly.” Castiel’s dick is inches from Dean’s lips. He rubs it there, pulling it away every time Dean tries to lick it. Slowly, stroking himself, he teases until Dean breaks.
A pleased smile sneaks onto Castiel’s face. Dean reaches for him, but the dream fades as Castiel whispers, “That part was dream.”
“Hmm air conditioned, open late on Friday and we can wear slobby clothing. But on the downside we’d have to walk there, and then once there, we’d have to do...work.”
While he’s figuring out whether they can afford the expensive beer, the bell above the door rings with more customers. By the sound of it, they’re already lit, loud and rude.
“I keep wanting to ask him to marry me, but I lose my nerve every time. Plus I can’t afford a ring or anything, and I never will. He deserves better, Sam.”
He shrugs one shoulder. “Everyone else is boring. I don’t need anyone else.”
He grins, shrugging. “You said it, not me.”
Dean tries. He tries not to struggle, but he just can’t fight the need for air. He pulls, making Cas fuck him harder. He plucks at Cas’ hand, and then claws at it, and frantically tries to pull in air through his nose. He can hear Gabriel coming back in, making a disgusted noise, but not leaving.
Dean sighs. “Well, I’m sure they offered him a pile of cash. It’s made nine hundred million already, and they made it on a shoestring budget. He’s gotta be chuckling out of the other side of that scruffy beard right now.”
There’s a disgusted noise over the line. “I know this already, Dean. Didn’t you patch things up a few years ago?”
“Plus,” he says, “you found the lake. This is what, the first vacation you’ve had in ages? Look how happy your brother is.”
He reaches for the door handle and Dean stops him. “You can’t. Ketch will kill you.”
Charlie stares at him, then taps her head. “Somewhere in there lies the truth.”
“Of course I do. But I keep my eye on things and I see how it is. They keep you guys busy so you can’t really look, but me, I have tons of time.”
“I mean, we even used it in some of our code words, not even a year ago -” Sam stops mid sentence and looks up at Castiel. They share a look of dawning comprehension.
He sets his jaw. “Dad said I couldn’t see Cas any more.”
Ketch storms out of the box, leaving Mary behind. In the silence afterwards, she lets out one sob.
It makes him feel small. With only one lamp on, the room is shadowy and still, like a captured moment in time. Castiel is lying on the bed, barefoot, legs crossed at the ankle. His eyes are shut, but Dean can see he’s not asleep.
Dean eyes him. “Now, is this a literal storm or a metaphorical storm, because I think we already knew there was a metaphorical storm coming.”
Dean blinks. “Wh.. Cas, I’m sorry.”
“How do they even move down there, much less pack into a crowded bar?” Dean grumbles.
“Mario’s Pizzeria.”
He lays his cheek on Cas’ thigh again and is rewarded with the man’s hands tangled in his hair. Neither of them says anything. Castiel’s eyes are glued to the stage, but he’s not really listening or taking it in. Dean closes his own eyes, letting the feel of those long fingers playing across his scalp sink in. He’s uncomfortably turned on, but it doesn’t seem to matter.
“-you but I thought if I told you-”
Ketch pats him on the cheek. “My son, I am doing my actual job. Safeguarding humanity. Trust me, leave. It’s going to get worse here before it gets better.”
Dean snaps it shut. “I thought we threatened Chuck.”
“Ha, good one, Mom. Dad’s going to live forever.”
Castiel blinks at him, once, long and slow.
Looking up at the security mirror, he can see their warped reflections as they head through the store. Two girls, a scrawny hyena of a man, and a musclehead. They don’t really merit a second look, but the man leading them…
“I can’t leave you alone with her.”
“Well, he’s not happy. He keeps saying some garbage about you coming to rescue him. I tried to tell him that you could give a shit, but he won’t hear it.”
“I did, yeah, everyone was-” His breath draws in sharply as he sees  the woman properly.
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “There is an unprecedented amount of every creature, to be honest. The wolves around my home are no more numerous than any other place. The harmonious accord between your father’s hunters and the Men of Letters has been shifted. Nothing is getting done.”
When he opens his eyes, he instantly wishes he hadn’t. The light is too bright, and everything smells faintly of antiseptic. Castiel, sitting tiredly in the nearby chair, closes his book, index finger keeping his place.
“To get information on your relationship with Dean, I suppose, but that seems…” Sam trails off, lips pursed.
“Yeah, okay, Santa.”
“The King is dead. Long live the King,” he says.
He smiles, all teeth. “Mother, you’re insulting my father.”
Ketch laughs, framed by the flicker of lightning, raising his sword to strike a fatal blow. “You’ll die for it, Dean, and no one will mourn your passing.”
“Fuck, you’re dense. Gabriel, I’m here.”
“Whose side are you on, anyway?” he spits out, bitterly.
She cringes away from him, shouting, “So what if we do?! This is a noble goal and there will be some sacrifices, there has to be! Nothing worthwhile is free!”
He doesn’t miss the face Sam pulls and a load of pressure eases up under his skin. They aren’t together. He’s not interested in Cas. Dean can’t help the slow grin that creeps over his face and it makes Sam turn a bright red.
Tears fall down Dean’s cheeks. Castiel wipes one off delicately and plays with the moisture between two fingers. “You promised me your life. I went to my knees and begged you to marry me. You took my ring, my prince. You took it, and gave me a promise.”
Castiel delicately licks his earlobe, whispering, “I missed you, your Highness. When I was forced to come home, and you did not follow...”
The freezing water never gets better, but it helps him to focus. By the time he’s shaved and brushed his teeth, he’s shivering, but actively thinking about plans instead of the past. New clothing out of his pack sticks to his wet skin and does nothing to help, but that’s fine. He reloads his rifle and repacks the bag, and when he can’t stall any longer, pulls a small, sparkly pink flip phone from his bag and turns it on, sitting back on the bed to wait.
Dean blinks. “Well, okay, we’re not rich. Dad’s missing, not dead, so his half of H34V3N is still his... and our salaries are crap.”
“I am never going to get used to how much like a genie that looks.”
His mind feels like it’s on fire, everything built up into an inferno. Slowly, though, he starts to piece himself back together. He should never have let his father chase him out. This would’ve  never happened! He has to make it right. When he comes back to himself, Sam is watching him with that infuriatingly neutral expression, nursing his beer, waiting for him to make up his mind.
Sam comes away from the door and Dean can see how training has rubbed the rough edges off him. He moves with confidence, and if he didn’t have so many memories of Sam being young and goofy, he’d calculate him as a very dangerous man instead of a huge, dangerous nerd. He pours drinks while his brother sits at the chair across from him - the same chair they’d both sat in to receive a royal dressing down from their father at one time or another. Dean’s less comfortable where he is now, but he sticks it out, offering the glass. It’s important, where he’s sitting. Important to have Sam see him there, in their father’s place.
Dean puts the watch in his pocket to keep her soul safe. Until the spell ends, she’s vulnerable. He gestures. “Walk with me?”
Dean squints at the building. “It’s been updated.”
Sam calls out from the kitchen, “We did. With death, even.”
“Awesome. I’m going to tell Rowena the spell to boost the signal worked, she’s going to be so insufferable about it.” He can hear her grin as she talks and it makes him long to leave, go back to his new home and not deal with this.
She laughs, pulling him in for a hug. “Come downstairs now, my love. It’s Christmas and the Duke will be lonely. With his family being what it is, he’ll need all the friends he can get. Your father can’t object to that.”
Charlie leans against the wall. Somehow, she’s got a beer, which she takes a swig of. “So, your Highness, what’s the plan?”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I love it, but if Sam’s up there alone, he’d trip over his own hair and get hurt. Gotta stay nearby.”
Cas tightens his grip on Dean, who instantly starts to panic. “I repeat, no one has ever died on the ferris wheel, and it’s not starting today.”
He digs his phone out, distantly glad to be using his own, happy to shed the pink sparkly monstrosity. Charlie answers immediately with a chirpy, “Your worshipfulness!”
“Mother, good Nobles, and loyal subjects. I stand here now to do a duty for my family. Arthur Ketch came to us in a time when the future for this country was in doubt. He became like a brother to my father, and uncle to myself and my brother, a friend to Mordavia. My uncle, held in such esteem that my father could trust him alone with him in the darkest woods to hunt. My uncle, who held my father in his arms as he died.”
“Surely it’s occurred to you that Castiel isn’t the only mixed-blood person in this country, after all the centuries of fighting and learning about monsters. Whatever this spell, or poison, or pogrom is, it’s going to kill your own subjects. These people are looking to you to protect them!”
“Must you?”
Dean laughs right in her face. “Fuck, how are you so delusional? He’s going to murder Sam, he told me as much himself.”
Instead, he mingles in his normal clothes, plastering a fake smile on his face and  pretending to care about these people. Except...they won’t stop giving him the weirdest looks. Finally Tad, already drunk enough for two men his size, leans up on him with a huge grin.
The neighborhood gave him the willies, and not just because of the Succubus. Honestly, even after Cas’ dire warnings, he was still secretly starting to think that they should let her have the place. Everyone here seemed happier and more relaxed due to the weekly semi-orgiastic partying.
Sensing Cas’ resolve wavering, Dean falls to his knees on the floor and shuffles over to Cas, arms outstretched, provoking a chorus of laughter from a group of students going by.
“You’re thinking about it again.” Castiel, behind him, drops a hand onto his shoulder.
For the first time in ages, Castiel looks uncertain. “The public just got used to the idea that one of their noblemen is not entirely human.”
The sound of students in the street below filters up, vague distant laughter and music played too loud. Friday night in town, the beginning of the bacchanalia. While summer on campus is quiet, every student who has an apartment in town has to stay. Summer also brings tourists from the city, and the combination is loud every weekend.
Dean jerks. “Kill - what? No! That’s not a good idea, Cas. Can we not talk about this? My mother is - my father - it’s all too much.”
“You know, you’re both cute and all, and whatever is going on here is very sweet, but you should lock the door, you’re just asking for trouble.”
It’s left hanging between them. Angels who have grown past their programming are considered by H34V3N to be the dangerous and unpredictable. Dean can see their point - humans themselves are dangerous and unpredictable. But H34V3N has sold the concept of ‘Evil AIs’ to the public, and more importantly, to the government. The policy is to kill them, or to bring them back for study, but Dean’s never heard of the later happening. H34V3N, true to form, calls them Fallen. Fallen Angels. They’d become a bit of a guerrilla movement, joining groups of monsters and manipulating them into protective guards. It’s a mess.
Gabriel shies away from Dean’s touch as if it might burn him. “No. No, I’ll get you to the capital, to the palace, but you’re going from there on by yourself. This romantic notion of breaking Castiel out of jail is asinine, but I do suggest you try to see him alone before anyone knows you’re here. Once you make yourself known, Ketch will well, it’s impossible to know what the hell he’ll do, but I can guarantee it’ll be violent.”
Dean sneers. He’s seen this look of furious disdain so often on his father’s face that he can replicate it without really trying. He registers Sam’s sudden intake of breath and the half step backwards as proof that he’s done it right. “You heard me. You pretender to the throne, you actually think I could rule with you by my side? You think that night meant anything? You’re a plaything. I need a real consort, not a man, especially not one that isn’t even human.”
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “Guys, could we just, not?”
“Of course not.”
Tad’s grin gets wider. “Your costume is sooo great. And funny. Cuz your name is Dean too.”
He thinks about stalling, but then just shrugs. “Ketch said that he’d kill Cas.”
“Son,” Ketch’s oily smooth voice is enough to make him vibrate with the need to commit violence, “the Duke is safe. He’s comfortable, even. I just wanted to make sure that we were still on the same side, you and I.”
“Cas…” he heaves the word out, guttural.
“No, we have multiple rounds of the same formula, should the need arise.”
Sam makes a face. “No, not really. I built all of it myself. Hey, Dean, can you answer a question?”
“Listen, guys. We’ve been through some shit. The werewolf cult in Missouri, the Elvis impersonators, serial killing shapeshifters. Beckett... dinner theater. This thing I’m asking you to do is a direct stab at the heart of someone who is very, very dangerous.
Cas moves to stand next to him. He’s warm, and too close. “You look like Dean Winchester. In the movie. He made you look exactly the same. The two of you really need to see it.”
“Henry died, and Roman has dementia. When Naomi took over, she didn’t understand how it worked, and because the secret was so well kept, she never had a chance. When angels got hurt, she replaced parts and broke the binding by accident.”
Cas simply shrugs, as if he couldn’t care less. Dean takes a step forward, urged on by the indifferent eyebrow and mocking smile.
“Well, yeah. Ghosts have a real way with frying electronics. I know a way in.”
It’s much quieter out here, and cold, which feels good on his overheated face. Too much booze, too many people. Behind him, Cas says quietly, “It’s the movie.”
Sam brings up some slides, showing some standard beginner’s programs fused with magic. He starts talking excitedly a mile a minute, Dean ducking his head to resist the urge to roll his eyes. He’s really only had Kevin to geek out with in the last few years about this stuff. “Dick Roman’s company was on the forefront of technological advancement. It included Robots, and some work with Artificial Intelligence. His designs were so good that I almost suspect him of selling his soul for them.”
Stripped to the waist as usual, Sam stands with one hand flat against the glass. In the darkness, the city lights play across his face, giving him an otherworldly look. Unlike his brother, Sam has no problem with tech, and all of it is blatantly on display, circuitry and magic at work under his skin. Dean thinks that’s most of the reason he goes around shirtless to begin with.
Mary is silent, looking at him, searching his face for some lie. The desperation to believe is written across her features starkly, and when she finally lets herself accept it, a brilliant smile breaks out across her face. She embraces him, tears of relief gathering in her eyes. She’s still shaking when she pulls back to cup his cheek in an affectionate hand.
Cas uses the leverage of the rock and buoyancy of the water to wrap his legs around Dean. “You could take me like this. I weigh nothing here.”
“So my paternal grandfather, Henry, he started a group called The Men of Letters. They have chapters in every country now. He and dad started one in America too, though it’s defunct now.” He pauses. “Say, that’s a thought for another day. There’s gotta be one of their safehouses somewhere in the states still. It could be useful.”
“Anyway?”
“Spell,” Dean supplies, hiding a smile.
“Good, very good Dean. You think you can hold your breath long enough for me to get off?”
Dean pulls back, looks into Cas’ eyes, and opens his mouth.
It’s stopped raining by the time they get back to the car, covered in mud and scratches. Castiel is scowling, but Dean can’t bring himself to be upset. His boyfriend is adorable, soaked and annoyed, a wet leaf plastered to his cheek. Of course, the air is no cooler than it was before, the moisture still cloying, the air humid and gross. Cas is asleep almost as soon as his butt hits the seat, so Dean drives back listening to Blue Oyster Cult, his good mood unabated.
“He was Dad about it.” Dean can’t wait to find his father so he can kick him for the look of loss on Sam’s face right now. Even if he doesn’t understand it.
“Mom doesn’t believe me about Ketch, and she’s all for the genocide of everyone with any drop of monster blood in their DNA. It was like she’d been brainwashed or something.”
Mary beams at him, but Ketch’s eyes are puzzled now, calculating. Dean has to speed this up or Castiel is going to do something impulsive, he can see it in the way he’s licking his lips, the shift of his hips and his hands. Sam brings Dean the crown and stands behind him, arms clasped behind his back.
Dean nods. “Meet me back home, later tonight. We need to, uh, talk about strategy.”
Ketch slips a proprietary arm around Mary, that fucking smile still on his face. “Oh no, I think what you mean is ‘Father’.”
His first instinct is to reach for his gun and shoot whoever it is, but of course, he’s unarmed. One of Cas’ hands slips around his own and he whispers into Dean’s ear, “Shhh, later.”
The moon is already at its height, heavy bellied, casting everything in a bright silver light. He hits the ground running and keeps at it, pelting across acres of farmland, vaulting over low stone walls. It’s easier around the farms and small villages; he is kept safe by the practical people of his country. Rows of Wolfsbane planted along the edges of every property keep the monsters at bay. It was highly dangerous, but all children knew the plant by sight, hardly anyone got poisoned by accident any more. He runs brazenly from field to field. If anyone did see him, they would know him to be at least human and moving too fast to bother with a shotgun.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but he has an actual smile. Dean drinks it in, every last stolen drop of the moment.
“Ah, yes. You were screaming and raving, but he seemed unconcerned, directing me to place you here. Something about ‘getting what you deserved’. I offered to bathe you, which seemed to amuse him, but he told me to leave you alone to sleep it off. I kept watch while you slept. Sam did leave you some food, however, once you are sufficiently clean.”
He closes his eyes, unable to keep the images from flooding his mind. “Going in was hard, but coming out was almost worse…”
“Want more, Prince?” Castiel hisses in his ear.
“It has to do with the chip in your head then. Maybe Dad hid something on it?”
He’s tall and beautiful, long hair falling in a perfect wave. He’s dressed like every vampire movie cliché and Dean is sure it’s on purpose. He’s still where the rest of them are twitchy; frenetic almost, set to cause chaos and fear. He’s looking for something and the economy of motion used to do it sets off more warning bells. Then he lifts his eyes, sees Dean in the mirror, and smiles. Dean cocks his head, activating the comm unit.
The sky erupts in lightning and thunder, a great rolling boom interrupting him before he can speak. There’s a startled moment of inactivity, and then they hurry out of the water just as the skies open and let loose a deluge of rain. Getting back into their clothing isn’t easy, but they manage soaked jeans well enough and start back through the woods.
“Ugh, I know. Cas wouldn’t shut up about that and now I can’t scrub the image of you playing sex games in a literal dungeon out of my mind. Get out of my car, your royalness. I have to go home and make sure my esteemed cousin doesn’t come and steal the silver.”
Dean hauls himself up a little to take it. He can see the glistening of ice cubes inside the bowl, already melting, and he is more than a little intrigued. “What’s with the ice?”
Traffic starts again, eerily silent and fast. He’ll never get used to electric cars. The bots are suddenly everywhere around him, blaring questions, some of them calling him by name. They talk rapid fire, overlapping each other. The noise is incredible.
“We have. It is my estimation that you retain a mere eighty percent of what happens here. It is remarkable for a human, but distressing all the same. Again, the chip and the… ‘special subroutine’ supplied by your father working from your grandfather’s notebook, allow me to monitor your consciousness. I know when you are sleeping, so I access your slumbering mind and wait until the dream forms itself. Some of what you retain is the real conversation, and some is dream.” Castiel sighs, frustrated, another quirk Dean only sees here. “This is an inefficient way to communicate.”
“When I’m King,” he says, surfacing, “I will have you by my side always.”
Dean grumbles, walking towards the run down building they call home. The further away he gets from the site, the more people move, wide eyed, out of his way. He should start carrying a spare coat or shirt or something. His scowl, on top of looking like a serial killer after a bender, have some of them visibly on their phones to the police. Luckily, he gets home before he’s forced to show his license to an overeager cop who might take him in anyway. The post-battle adrenaline loss makes him so bone-tired that he stumbles through a shower before collapsing on his bed to sleep.
Rowena rolls her eyes, and even on such a small screen, her disdain is palpable. “Is it always the same dream?”
He tsks. “Shhh, no one is murdering anyone. I simply suspect him of treason. We talked about this. As soon as I’m the King, I can ensure that he is able to travel again, and you can escape to that cesspool of a country with your group of clowns. I’m sure they would love to be able to leave this country in one piece as well.”
Castiel comes and sits next to him. Gently, he says, “Kevin.”
Dean rolls his eyes, following Gabe out of the sorority house. “Look, I get that they needed some dudes for their charity car wash, but these shorts are way too-”
Castiel, readjusting his clothing shamelessly, asks, “They nearly rioted when Mary married him. Do you think it will go that far this time?”
“You mean Ketch.”
Sam scowls. “He killed Dad. And he’s a dick.”
He doesn’t let go. Honestly, he isn’t sure he won’t strike her if he lets go. “And what about your other son? What about Sam?”
The ghost flickers in and out, whispering, “No… no, but it was for her love that I died. Her love and love of my throne. She and someone I considered close enough to be my brother.”
A century ago, his family would have used a highly dangerous mix of monkshood and other herbs as a poultice, packing the wound and hoping the patient didn’t die from the cure itself. But now they have doctors. Very ingenious, open minded doctors. The sort of doctors that become villains in comic books. He cleans the wounds, stitching them as best he can. Taking a deep breath and letting it out again, he opens the package and injects himself with the one-use syringe. While it’s not going to kill him, the fallout from the drug is intense. When he’s used it in the past, he’s always been looked after - this time he’ll have to go it alone. It’s going to suck. This room, meant for escape, is soundproofed, so he knows no one will hear the screaming.
The house lights dim and Garth, dressed as a jester, comes out into a spotlight to begin his monologue. Quietly, Dean mumbles something about a restroom and creeps out of his seat. Sam glares at him, but doesn’t make a move to stop him. He opens the door without making a noise and slips out of the box, hurrying through the empty lobby, around to the other side. As he’s creeping into the Wallachstein box, he chances a look up. Sam is glaring at him, but thankfully, no one else seems to have noticed. Ketch is glued to the stage, a faint frown on his face. Dean shrugs at his brother helplessly, and drops to the floor next to Cas’ chair.
He stalks forward, and Dean has to stop himself from backing away.
Calmly, not looking up from his work, he asks, “Can I help you with something?”
Dean squishes his way to the sidewalk. He’s vaguely aware of a man watching him intently as he staggers off the road, a man who leaves hastily when Castiel strides back, tan coat billowing. Something about the guy bothers him, but the amused look on the Angel’s face drives it out of his mind.
“What do you want?” Dean growls into the phone, picking up before the first ring even ends.
“With your brother, as it happens.”
Okay, it’s not cool, but he’s going to think about it later. Summer is almost over, and he wants to have fun.
As much as Dean loved pissing his father off, he’d always counted on seeing him again. He’d have approved of his adventure tonight, Dean mused as he strapped his backpack on securely. Two miles to Littleton, a few hours from the capital. Common sense said it was easier to wait till the train got to the station, but the wide-eyed look that came over the face of the woman who’d sold him the ticket meant there’s now a rumor the Prince is on the train.
Dean flips the phone shut, running his thumb over the rhinestones along the back of it while he thinks. Three hours to the capital and the roads will be crawling with Ketch’s goons and Royal Guards alike. He’s going to need help. Time to find out where Gabriel stands. He opens the flip phone and dials one of the four pre-programmed numbers.
Charlie looks up at the picture. “He is a creepy guy. No offense.”
Dean nods tiredly. “I almost believed him for a second. I thought for a hot minute that he’d actually let me and Cas escape together, but when he said he’d let you go, too, I knew. He’s going to kill us all.”
His hand traces its way down Dean’s face, over his jaw, to his neck. He’s unable to move or do much of anything but feel it, breath coming in short staccato bursts through his nose.
Ketch steps forward into Dean’s space. “No, you listen. You never gave a shit about this country or your mother. You broke her heart when you refused to return, and I was, luckily, there to pick up the pieces. Pack up your abomination, you’ll find that the order blocking his visa will be suspended. Go back to the States. In a week, your mother will crown me King, and you will officially be free forever. The Men of Letters has a plan, and with my help as King here, no one will even have to hunt monsters anymore. Doesn't that sound like paradise?”
Dean kisses Cas on the lips gently, then on his cheeks, his neck. “Marry me,” he whispers into the skin there.
The orchard’s quiet is pensive, the twisted trees heavy with apples. His footfalls are muffled on the soft grass. A mist starts rolling in, low to the ground. Every step drags him forward to the center of the orchard where the first tree planted here grows. It’s well over a century old, living far past the normal age of any apple tree. He looks up at it uneasily as he gets close. It towers over him, the trunk thick and scarred. Abruptly dizzy, Dean reaches out to steady himself on it, his mind filled with a memory he’s helpless to stop.
Helpless laughter bubbles up from inside him and he can’t hold it in. It frightens her more that the fist he has clenched, more than the knife easily within reach in his boot. He advances on her. Mary scrambles away from him until her legs hit the bed and she sits hard. Crouching next to her, he takes her hands, stroking them gently.
Castiel is impassive, the way he is in public, his expression neutral and calm. Dean feels like the ground is going to swallow him, especially when he looks up at Sam and sees Castiel’s look echoed there. “Wait, you’re not going?!”
They’re quiet now, tangled in the nude together on top of Dean’s plush bedspread. He’s been living entirely on his own for years now, and the lavishness of it is a shock, even if he does love the feel of it on his naked skin. His head is nestled against the comforting solidity of Cas’ chest, the sound of his heartbeat welcome and real. His body feels sated and relaxed, unable to do anything like that again until tomorrow, but he knows that Cas would be ready to go in an instant. He doesn’t know if it’s the angel heritage, but his refractory time has always been a matter of minutes, his need only intensified with each orgasm. Dean secretly hopes that he’ll be pushed down on the bed and taken again - being used for Castiel’s pleasure was one of his biggest vices. Better than drinking, any drug, any high ever.
“Exactly. They could have waylaid me at any point and extracted that information. After your father’s disappearance, you were both a thorn in her side, but she was able to move forward. After a while you seemed to stop and have been playing ‘nice’. She has no reason to do this.”
He stops talking, breathing through whatever panic is running through his head. When he’s done, he grimaces. “I”m sorry. After they arrested my brother, I spent some quality time with his new and improved Men of Letters. It was... instructive. Come on out to the garage, your Highness. I’ll drive you.”
Dean cups his hands under Castiel’s ass, drinking in the sight of him. Water droplets sparkle on his eyelashes, his dark hair is wet and curling around his cheeks, and Dean wants him. Cas is smiling, stress free for the first time in weeks, the relaxation reaching all the way to his eyes, blue and perfect.
He opens his mouth, but car guy butts in again. “Excuse me. Can I at least have my change?”
“Better. Ok, Dean Winchester, will you be my husband, even though neither of us will ever be rich, and even though my brother will doubtlessly get drunk enough to hit on your brother during our wedding reception?”
Lightning flashes and the next thunderclap sees them both fighting for their lives. Despite Dean’s training, Ketch is a shade better, slowly pushing him back towards the altar. Blood flows from a wound on his temple where the crown struck him. Dean slips on violet petals, slick with Mick’s blood, stumbling and falling.
He makes Dean play the rifle-shooting game, ignoring his grumbling about how the thing pulls to the left. After a few tries, Dean finally gets the hang of how it’s rigged, and wins Cas a huge, hideous, teal stuffed bear that Dean immediately dubs “Gabriel Jr.” over Cas’ laughing protests.
Dean laughs, feeling triumphant at the flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. “I went to speak to the Duke to see for myself if he was guilty, and he wasn’t. Then we had a good fuck for old times sake, and it was fun, but that’s really it. You’re horrible at this spymaster crap, Ketch. Stick to your actual job.”
“Jusssst,” he whispers, “gonna sleep a minute.”
Sam takes him by the shoulders and shakes him a little. “Then go ask him. Right now, ringless and everything. You have to tell him how you feel.”
Without moving, Castiel says, “Why did they kidnap him, anyway?”
Dean flaps his hand in Sam’s direction and he nods. Dean expects him to slip back into the NET, but he just goes out the door, shirtless and barefoot.
Before Henry Winchester and Dick Roman banded together, their father had been a hard taskmaster, teaching them how to hunt monsters the old fashioned way. Since the monster ‘uprising’, everything had gone sideways, but one of the things their dad taught them that stuck was Morse Code. And, as much as his brother scoffs at old and dusty, having secret ways to communicate is one of those things that appeals to his brainiac side. Sam responds, his fingers tapping gently where they rest on the glass, asking for Lo Mein. Done. There’s a place right next to the liquor store and Dean could stand to eat several egg rolls.
“I see puzzlement on the faces of my people. Why was I not at my own father’s funeral? Why did I not take my throne and where have I been these last years?” He pauses again, waiting past the point where a proper dramatic pause would end, waiting until people start talking, until the muttering gets loud. Ketch scowls at him and Mitch makes a quick gesture with the arm closest to Castiel. There’s a flicker in Cas’ eyes that would be a proper flinch to anyone else. Yeah, someone’s gonna die.
“I love-”
“What the actual fuck?”
