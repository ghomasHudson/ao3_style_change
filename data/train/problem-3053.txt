It was also ridiculously tempting.
A wave of relief through him. “Thank you.”
spell?”
Castiel sighed softly and gently pulled him closer, feeling Dean settle against his chest and all but purr in satisfaction. A natural position, indeed, although one that had an equal part between pleasure and guilt.
People were making their way through the paths, and he could see the glint of car lights on the main track leading to the entrance.
“Oh.” Castiel fell silent again, still thinking hard. Was this a strange blessing? But then Dean had not spoken of it since. Perhaps he merely thought of it as another odd Sam suggestion, or perhaps he had drunk enough that the words had been lost in an alcoholic haze. Perhaps this was not agreeable to him, which was certainly a possibility. Castiel’s duty was to protect him; there had always been stern warnings against those who loved their charges too greatly. The consequences were often dire.
“Look, Cas and I can go have a walk around for bandstands if you’re really, really interested.” Dean glanced at the angel, who hadn’t really recovered. “Right, Cas?”
“There’s a plan?” That was Dean again, who was still king of popping back when he wasn’t anticipated.
“Hair.” Jody said immediately. Fingernails normally resulted in screams loud enough to suggest she was actually hacking off fingers.
“Is he okay?”
Jody frowned at him, and then looked back at the still silent Sam as she worried about her initial assessment. They were alright, surely? They had to be alright.
“What, just stay next to me on the bed?” he said.
The little swallow that Cas made was kinda worth it. Not
“I have fixed what I can.” the angel said finally.
Castiel sighed softly.
He felt like an idiot. He certainly looked like an idiot; Dean had avoided the tight clothing that basically turned him into a human sausage, but he’d still had to wear some short shorts that clung to his form more enthusiastically than the average leech. The only hint to him was the AC-DC vest shirt, and that was probably traitorous to the shirt. And now he was running around the paths through the woods that criss-crossed the gated community without anything even chasing him. Insanity.
“It’ll come to you.” Sam rubbed his temple with a finger. “And the only reason I can get in is via a guest pass thing, and seriously, that took a
“It means I’d bet on it, Cas. Don’t worry, this isn’t some weird coin based game of Jenga.”
“Sneaky ones do,” Sam said doubtfully.
Cas closed his eyes painfully. “Dean, please stop. He is your brother-,”
Castiel waited. He would have liked to have said calmly but this would have been just as much a lie as their original cover story. His heart felt uncomfortable. His mind seemed both intense and unfocused at the same time, ignoring larger senses in order to target smaller, almost unimportant details; the small flecked buttons on Dean’s shirt. The small laugher lines at the corners of his eyes. The barely there smudge of dirt on Dean’s cheek. But at least it picked up when Dean finally gazed at him with a determined look.
sex driven.”
Castiel focused his attention on Dean again. Whatever the sleeping issue was, it was clearly unnerving enough to fight about. That was never a good situation.
“So.” Sam said as soon as they were positioned near what Sam assured him related to the water. Castiel closed his eyes wearily. And he knew that voice well.
The words trailed off suggestively. Castiel returned the look with a firm one of his own. This was not amusing. This was difficult, and difficult on many levels. Still, Sam wasn’t allowing the silence to halt and finally Castiel decided to puncture the implications before they gained proverbial legs.
At least there had been no argument over who was going under cover. Sam had acted as though the obvious choice was him and Cas, and all Dean had to do was shrug, argue a small amount and then agree. Pretty damned easy. Bit too easy if he was feeling paranoid, but if Sam had any real thoughts about him and Cas then he’d kept them to himself for years as it was. Probably fine.
having bad dreams?”
Oh, he was fucking dead-
Castiel smiled to himself again. He doubted whether the man truly misunderstood the angel’s need for at least a brief delay for preparation. Even if Dean hadn’t slept with men, he was fairly certain the subject of anal sex would have come up during some of his hetrosexual encounters. Sam had always alluded to Dean’s sex life being both inventive, energetic, and probably drunken. The idea that backsides were removed from consideration seemed unlikely.
Hell, Dean still didn’t quite know what to make of that. Happy? Terrified? Bewildered? All three at the same time? That was a possibility.
“That is always a risk,” Castiel agreed, his gaze deliberately running across Dean’s firm chest and stomach before resting on the waistband of the pants he wore. “Perhaps you should remove the remainder of your clothing and we’ll consider what plans might be afoot.”
Shit, he was babbling. Stop babbling. Start helping, for fuck’s sake.
Another pleased, sleepy grin that Castiel was confident to translate as ‘yes’. He smiled and gently ruffled Dean’s messed up hair. He had been about to suggest some type of food when Dean surprised him with actual words.
“So get this,”
in the pockets of Cas’ trenchcoat? Jody wasn’t sure. Didn’t know whether she wanted to find out either; probably a small portal to another planet the way they were going.
There was an even longer pause on the other end of the phone. Castiel eyed the corners of the room waiting for a response that never really came, and then sighed softly.
It was clear from the first few thrusts that Cas wasn’t as happy, harder and sharper thrusts deep in him that forced a few soft grunts in the back of Dean’s throat, but his own angel slowly began to get used to the concept as the jerkier, harder thrusts settled down again to the powerful rhythm that vibrated in his core.
Vivid but exhausted blue eyes stared back at her.
“Everything okay?”
The angel chuckled to himself as he sipped a new cocktail he’d just whipped up. Ah, the Winchesters might be a pain in the ass but every so often they were quite entertaining.
“My brother,” Dean gritted it out. Oh, the angel knew damned well who Sam was, and this was already painful. The angel eyed him again.
“You haven’t been outside.
“But we
“Sam. Good to see you’re up.”
There was a soft dismissive noise at that. “I’m sure they’ll be quite fine by the end of it. And any risk is bound to be worth it,”
“Would it kill you to have a few cushions?” Dean managed to get his breathing to allow at least one sentence. The corner of Balthazar’s mouth curled upward in amusement.
At first Dean was generally annoyed. Time restraints?! They actually followed the crazy ass instructions that his crazy ass brother decided to dictate. Seriously, who died and made Sam the leader? Who got worried about
, yes?”
The bear decided the next story again, which was another ‘hunter’ type tale ‘Where the Wild Things Were’. Jody hadn’t been sure this had been the best idea after Dean started asking whether he could have a furry wolf tunic as well, but thankfully Sam pointed out this would make
And hell, they were married. It was probably part of the contract. Oh yeah, Cas might pretend he was very proper and well mannered, but Dean was pretty sure there was a happy little pervert under the collar.
“It’s amazing what you can have spells for,” the angel commented softly, and Dean slowly came to the realisation that apparently the angel had managed to magic up - or miracle up, who knew - lube in just the right place. Pre-oiled, as it were. And from the look in Cas’ eyes, he was fully aware of what his angel brother was planning. Sneaky.
“I’m a witch, dear, not a fortune teller. Or a psychiatrist either, although I do love their little couches.” she chuckled softly and then looked back at their serious faces. “Oh, please. They’re
“How is it?” Dean said softly. Castiel turned his head to discover a very gentle, concerned look aimed at him. “Headache?”
Castiel smiled grimly. “Not a suggestion.”
“Sounds a good time for a sharp exit. Look like I’m talking to you.”
An already painfully hard groin throbbed harder, Dean biting his own lip as he gazed back. He had no idea what the hell Balthazar was telling him but currently he wouldn’t be surprised if it was some sort of angel porn designed to rile him up. Were there specialist moves that really got angels going? Who knew.
A cold wash blasted through him, and Dean didn’t want to look any more, wanted to keep these thoughts locked up but he couldn’t force them away. The knowledge that Castiel wasn’t human.
, but slightly. And yeah, he could get used to that hungry look in his angel’s eyes, especially as he moved so damned quickly to line himself up against Dean’s already battered hole and push straight the way in. Dean lost his breath again, widening his thighs and trying to regain his breathing as Cas found a whole new level of speed to work at.
“What?” he asked. “You look like you’re planning something.”
Dean pulled a small face. “Well, can we get you undressed instead? I show you mine and all that crap,”
The arm… was intentional?
“He said he was
What to do.
“Kinda looks busy for somewhere that doesn’t really have much to do.” he commented. “Couldn’t get much out of people when it came to their work, got a few freelancers but mostly staying in the community, working around here in exchange for board and food and stuff like that.”
Mingling itself was relatively easy; having assumed they’d be surrounded by people with various levels of ‘weird’, he was pleased to note that most of them seemed .. well, kinda normal. Relaxed clothes, modern day chat, laughing, the occasional reference to a late night poker game that he was definitely all for, and someone had brought one hell of a lot of doughnuts along which were sitting on a big plate looking lonesome.
“Sam? You want the bunny?”
“Thank you.” Castiel clearly focused on the words he wanted to, which was a talent Dean wished he had sometimes. Personally, he wanted to deck the angel, and not in the bows of holly way, but that was probably a statement on his own problem resolution techniques. There was another little huff of a sigh and Balthazer made his way back to the bedroom.
“Hey look at that. The items were useful after all.” Claire grinned at her mother, before looking at Sam again. “They’re kinda cute. How long d’you think they’ll be like this?”
“They are a handful, but it’s worth it.”
And yet, there still existed a little ball of hope that perhaps the notion might not be a reasonable one. And that.. Yes, that both delighted and terrified him in ways that he had never dreamed possible. Who knew the most terrifying moments could be contained in the gentlest of gestures.
“So if you don’t mind, get stripped, stand in the circle, I’ll set the cantrips and then you’ve got about half an hour to come.” Balthazar looked faintly impatient, looking between them.
Furious green eyes turned to him that showed the droopiness of severe tiredness. Sam eyed him carefully. Dean had been like this for a couple of days now, slowly getting worse, getting clumsier, yawning mid-sentence, and showing increasing irritability. Dean was now at the stage where the mere pop of a toaster could set off the next apocalypse and Sam wasn’t sure whether to be concerned or irritated. Both currently sounded good to him.
By the end of an hour they were all out of breath, and several muscles were aching in Jody’s thigh. There had been an injury too; Dean had kept hold of his little sword and had accidentally bonked Annie a bit too hard on the arm, although it was Dean who was more upset than Annie.
“It would be best for me to leave immediately. It may take a while to obtain the solution, and the boys will be..,”
He was half aware of the chanting slowing but it was definitely chalked up against the ‘didn’t give a fuck’ list. Dean’s fingertips tried to find purchase on an unforgiving smooth surface as Cas’ fingers stroked over the painfully sensitive tip of his cock before moving back to his original strokes, or, as Dean viewed it, turning his insides into heated jello.
“He is my friend.” Castiel replied, although his voice was milder than yellow cheese, as though the angel was merely commenting on the current temperature.
out of the trunk of his car.
Cas was giving him a funny look, and it definitely wasn’t the ha-ha type.
Dean returned back to him carrying a small plate of food and a mug of hot chocolate, carefully easing himself onto the sofa beside him and pecking a light kiss on Castiel’s cheek before offering the small plate of what appeared to be impractically tiny sandwiches.
“Well, that would be accurate.”
, and Dean felt a little throb of interest in his core as he studied the blue eyes that were watching him. Definitely good looking. Jawline to die for. Expressive eyes that seemed to swap between puppy dog to stern master back to puppy dog again. Still wearing very little that showed off his body like some classic statue.
“We want all eyebrows to remain low.” Castiel nodded in understanding.
“What?” Dean looked down at himself. Okay, he was muddy, but who cared? “What’s wrong with my clothes?”
And yet the tender look in Dean’s eyes was-
“It matters to me.” Castiel replied, also truthfully. His body disagreed entirely with the thought, of course. He was so hard that he ached, the light blanket over him enough to send torturous sensations through his body as it brushed against the sensitivity of his cock. There was a soft groan from Dean but he leaned across and pressed another little soft kiss to Cas’ neck.
go to your room.”
“In my defence, I didn’t know I was supposed to ask about a bandstand. It falls under the same reasoning as not asking about a whirlpool.” Castiel ‘s voice was faintly exasperated.
Dean bristled but the words seemed to be genuine. He gave a little reluctant nod, and watched as his brother began to walk toward the door.
Dean trotted in and managed to climb up onto his own stool, wobbling a little before sitting down and looking expectantly toward Annie. A cookie was provided to both boys and there was a brief but welcome silence, only broken by the eager sounds of munching. Munching some very large, very chocolatey looking cookies, for that matter.
“Cas, a little more romantic appearance and a little less endurance based wedding sex, okay?” Dean muttered under his breath.
“Backward,” Dean clarified.
Had there ever been a better sight than this? Dean hadn’t known what to expect with the celebration but everything had worked out easily. The households gathered, a soft excited murmur as they waited for the light to fade, before the leader of the community began to walk ahead into the wooded area and along the small paths. No words were needed. The community followed him without instruction, a long chain of willing people that wound their way through the trees like ants.
“I won’t get lost.” Sam announced proudly. “I know the yard really well.”
“Why not?” Dean frowned.
There were more words, louder this time, but the comfort still remained and Dean heard himself laughing somewhere in the distance. The world was still comforting, a bubble around him and they were all together, everyone, joined and one, and he saw the shine of the golden knife as it was raised and heard the words that gently caressed them and watched the lights that flickered and danced and moved around the leader like a light filled ghost and-
Another pause.
had to come, but it just stayed there as though caught in a trap.
“Good boy,” she gently scooped him up, and glanced down at the scared Dean. “Could you pick up the things and bring them in for me, Dean?”
“I understand he has
. He was in the bed because they were… because it was..
“We...uh.” Castiel paused and thought about it. “I’m not quite sure, it was a strange set of circumstances. We received word of odd happenings around a storage locker, and research into the deceased owner suggested that they were a collector of unusual artefacts. On gaining access to the locker, we were able to find a few items and then we either set off a ward or a curse. I appear to be unaffected … or at least by the magic, anyway.” Another pause and a faintly pitiful expression. “Children are hard.”
“Shh, it’s fine. You all would have come to help me if I needed it,” Jody looked down at the sleeping Sam again. “ Although it’s been a while since I looked after kids this young though. Not long enough to forget that they look sweet and cherubic when asleep and normally turn into demons when awake, though. Sneaky demons.”
“It’s not
And this position posed quite the conundrum. Moving said arm had the distinct chance of waking him, and Dean’s well being relied on as many hours as he could obtain through sleep. On the other hand, said arm was gently pressing against the tip of Castiel’s already very excitable penis. If said arm were to be left, then calming himself down would be an impossibility and the chances that Dean would become aware of his angel’s situation significantly higher.
He never thought he’d say he was suffering from this situation but Dean was rapidly coming to the conclusion that this was a whole new level of torture that was both glorious and desperate at the same time. His glare had devolved into a softer, pleading route, not sure why they’d stopped him from finding his release but knowing he was no longer in charge of it. Balthazar glanced carelessly at him again and began to stroke his fingers across Dean’s cheek and along his jawline again.
It was as beautiful as he had imagined, and yet he had very little time to appreciate the display. The heat of Dean’s body clamped down around him, each little shudder  simultaneously flooding his senses, and Castiel bit back a cry of his own as his willpower failed him and he came hard and deep within Dean’s heat.
“Can we get on with it?” Dean suddenly remembered politeness and groaned inwardly. “Please?”
“Dean has returned to his bedroom and is currently lying on his bed. Do you have any suggestions on how to stop these nightmares based on your previous experience?”
“This would not be a problem.” Castiel reassured him solemnly. And indeed it would not. In fact, very much far from it, but he doubted now was the time to discuss Sam’s suggestion. Still, the thought gave him more pleasure than he had anticipated, and he carefully shut the door behind him and moved toward the bed.
The angel looked a little haunted at that suggestion, his shoulders hunching as he considered it. Finally he shook his head slowly.
“I … I thought we could go for a walk.”
Dean and Cas had been guided to the middle of the column, protected either end by other community members that smiled at them as they gently showed them where to go. Some of the community held old fashioned rectangular lanterns, their lights flickering as the group walked, and others carried red streamer like flags that flickered prettily in the breeze.
“You…,” Castiel paused to gather his thoughts again into a meaningful dialogue. “You have already mentioned your view to Dean?”
Dean chuckled and rested his arms around Castiel’s neck lazily. “Yeah, I bet. I’m sorry. I was probably just a bit clumsy, didn’t mean to worry you. Did you .. ah, did you want to go to the Great Hall and get some food? I think the lady said that’s what they did.”
If looks could kill, Dean was on his 3000th corpse. Eyes narrowed to almost slits as he glared back at his brother for a few moments before shaking his head in annoyance. Castiel could almost hear the teeth grinding.
But Cas did not want bacon. His gaze fell a little lower in obvious confusion.
“And you are not sorry either,” Castiel pointed out through gritted teeth. Sam chuckled to himself and folded his arms.
“Sulk?”
The angel licked his lips and tried again.
“Close enough.” But there was a small smile in Dean’s words.
The sound of voices made his head snap up. And that was definitely his cue to leave; sure, it was probably just a couple of walkers doing their walkery things, but last thing he needed was a reputation for ignoring signs on his first damn day and anyway he just had to trot down the other steps before-
Balthazar was significantly better at reading humans, which was just as well.
“I see.” Castiel spoke first.
Castiel turned around again, scanning the surroundings, and the look of anguish on his face almost made Dean push himself up and announce his presence. Only Sam ran up, his hand on Castiel’s arm and urgent words in his ear, and the angel hesitated. Another pained look around him before Castiel ran after Sam to finish mopping up the mess, and Dean closed his eyes wearily. What was it? Ghost? Demon? Some fucked up ritual shit? Probably didn’t matter much, it all felt the same. And he was probably about as much use to them in his state as a broken devil’s trap.
“I see,” Castiel spoke so solemnly it was as though she’d given a medical diagnosis. And this had to be so odd to the angel; his charges alive but so very different. And sticky. Excessively sticky.
And anyway, how could he
“He is keen,” he said finally, and with extreme emphasis. “Very keen, and I cannot possibly undertake the level of intimacy he wishes as he is at the moment. Which makes it imperative that you fix the water soon as possible, as clearly we cannot do anything until he has the ability to take a shower. A proper shower. A shower we can fully discuss.”
“Uh,” he said.
“We will be back in forty five minutes at the latest,” Castiel replied solemnly. Dean made a soft strangled noise in the back of his throat that signified his irritation with the cotton wool culture he was having to put up with, gripped Castiel’s hand a little harder and gave him a not unsubtle tug toward the path.
“Well, I would feel much better if you know what could be lurking in the woods,” Jody said solemnly. Indecision flashed across Dean’s face as he glanced at the brightly coloured book in Jody’s hands, and then down at his nearby sword. A small battle was clearly taking place in his mind.
Another hard kiss left them both breathless, their bodies intertwined enough to grind beautifully against each other as Dean’s nails raked gently down Castiel’s back.
And Pillow Wars had a big thumbs up in approval.
“Dean.
“This is a love spell.”
“..happy?” it was a soft grumble.
“...fuck…,” the softest of gasps.
admit you’re not sleeping!”
What the fuck..?
Dean continued to stare at him, his vision slightly out of focus every so often. Castiel sighed softly, and added a little more force, the hint of what Sam called the ‘father figure’ voice.
“Such a shame we’re not back in my day. You could beat children in line without a thought. Kept my Fergus in line.”
Tired, still furious eyes turned to him before there was a soft noise of either laughter or frustration.
“I’m not sure I care.” Castiel commented after a while. “Shouldn’t we try, just in case?”
His gaze looked down at Dean critically and then across to Castiel with a similar look of resignation. There was a soft sigh.
“Because you ask so politely?” the angel countered, his voice still low but clearly irritated. “Look. I don’t personally care whether your darling little brother dies, and I’m always upset if Cas is upset but I’m sure he’ll get over it. Essentially, if you want me to do something, make me happy or you can just swivel on it.”
okay?”
Castiel fixed him a stern look. No. Not on his watch.
“So did you guys find out any more about the bandstand?” he asked idly.
Speaking of the other angel, Balthazar wasn’t on pause either. Dean wasn’t sure what the fuck was going on, but every so often there were more whispers, more flashes in Castiel’s eyes, Balthazar’s arm wrapped around Cas’ chest to keep them together as he did so. Yeah, his money was definitely on some type of dirty talk, and whatever it was seemed to be pressing Cas’ buttons and probably pulling a few levers as well.
“DEAN!”
“You could say that,” Castiel said truthfully. “How are you feeling?”
the monster and it was shelved as a Bad Decision.
Dean stared at him for a moment before moving his dazed and confused eyes onto the bowl that was sitting nearby. Oh. Right. Yeah. Stuff. Moving stiffly, he rolled over onto his stomach, and then pushed himself up onto hands and knees. He glanced over his shoulder only to discover that Balthazar was pressed up against Castiel’s back again, his mouth dangerously close to Cas’ ear as he whispered whatever scheme they had, and Dean bristled slightly at this.
And people were starting to leave as well. Definitely their cue to go before they started getting asked some complicated questions.
“Is he hurt?”
“Well, he can’t have gone far..,” she muttered to herself. “Dean?
His mouth worked steadily and without much fuss. It was almost too easy to get into a rhythm, sucking, licking, taking him deeper every so often but not intending to go for tonsil attacks as Dean continued his activities. Every so often he had to break off in order to pant for more oxygen, the thrusts deep in his body refusing to let him focus on his work, and Dean groaned helplessly at that. After a while he even allowed his groans to occur while he was still suckling Balthazar, the vibrations neatly transferring themselves to the angel’s cock and delivering a satisfied moan of its own.
“Yeah. Lots!” That was Sam, essentially stuck to his leg.
been electrocuted and these little romantic gestures were adorable anyway.
plans for the evening.” Castiel replied in a warning voice.
Cas gave a little nod from the corner and moved forward, tilting his head toward Balthazar before vanishing. And even before they went, Balthazar could still see Sam mouthing to Dean not to relax as they were going to have a little chat later on regarding the whole business.
The angel looked at him politely. Dean flushed again and muttered something under his breath that Castiel pretended he couldn’t hear, before the angel gently captured Dean’s chin in his hand to draw his attention back onto himself.
“Well, that’s something at least.” The angel moved to the centre and lit a few more candles, murmuring under his breath briefly before picking up a nearby bowl and studying it carefully. It was, essentially, a bowl. Wooden, probably hand carved based on the wobbliness of the surface, and with a few things carved on the outside. Pretty ordinary, as bowls went, but Dean didn’t quite trust the look that Balthazar gave Castiel afterward. Wasn’t a dangerous or scheming look but one that was a little wary, the type a friend would give if they were worried, and what the hell did this ritual need anyway?
-” Sam’s voice was clipped but Dean wasn’t having any of that. This was
“You look so serious! It’s okay, baby. We’re home. This is it.”
Determined nerves hesitated in the face of bizarre vocabulary. Castiel tried again.
“I believe that would be appropriate.”
“Hmm,” Jody folded her arms, but was beginning to soften a little. “Yeah, okay. Although now I can understand why Castiel looked like he’d gone through the wringer a few times when he turned up.”
“Hey, who said you were boss in this?”
“Not coffee.” said the witch. “Do you have any wine?”
“I don’t think children are part of their usual training. Other than the whole Jesus thing, and even then that was more dragging other people in to deal with the baby,” Jody reflected, and then helped the boys down as they finished their food. “Right. You two, this way. Annie, c’mon. You can do your baby whispering out here.”
“There’s supposed to be a lake nearby. We could always swim in that,” Dean said. Castiel winced internally. Ordinarily he was always impressed with Dean’s levels of inventiveness and sheer bloodymindedness to find a solution, but this was not one of those times. He shot a desperate look at Sam, who made a small helpless face back. There would be no assistance there.
There was a pause as Sam tried to decode that message. Castiel didn’t think it was too unwieldy. There were only so many replacements for their case work, and either fixing the supernatural issue would resolve Dean’s memory loss or allow them to add in the gaps that Dean was clearly ignoring.
Castiel was leaning over him, their faces inches away as the angel’s body pressed against Dean’s in all the right places. Dean huffed a soft laugh and shifted his body again, wrapping his legs around Castiel’s hips and squeezing slightly into the meat of his ass as he offered a cocky half grin for daring to assume such impunity.
“And you know I would have, too. So, now you
“When-,”
Okay. That was good. That was really good, and although this might be a gateway to god knows where, right now he didn’t really care. Dean leaned forward a little more, his lips meeting Cas’ again and felt a spark of insanely intense need as Castiel accepted the kiss and deepened it a little further. He was faintly conscious of Cas’ hands sliding over his waist and one creeping down to his ass, and he probably should have been doing the same back but his body seemed to be completely frozen in shock. Somehow it also felt right. Normally it was him taking the lead, pushing the boundaries, but right now Dean was happy for Cas to take over and that probably would be embarrassing if he bothered to think about it.
Still, frogs be damned right about now. Castiel was still damned intense as well, a hunger in the angel’s eyes that Dean wasn’t sure whether to bow down to. He opened his mouth to speak but found no words to say, a silent plea transmitting instead which he was relieved to discover that Cas could decipher. A few moments later and Cas had guided him down to lie on the floor, the surface cool against the heat of his skin and the angel leaning over him like a lion over its prey.
“You really gonna keep wearing the trenchcoat? In bed? C’mon man, live a little. I can lend you a t-shirt, something a little more cozy.”
And just as quickly as it had arrived, it vanished; Dean slowly began to settle again, the soft whimpering dying away as he entered into a much needed deeper sleep. Perhaps it was nothing more than Dean himself, the strains of the past finally gaining their revenge by inserting themselves in his dreams. Perhaps the bunker had reawakened the loss of his family. Regardless, whatever had occurred seemed to be countered by his presence, and for that Castiel was truly thankful.
“We haven’t got to the verbal diarrhea yet but I’m conscious it’s probably gonna come at some point. They’re still settling in, getting used to the place.” Jody picked up a pen on the desk and turned it idly in her hand as something to do. “How’s it going on your side? Did you find your contacts?”
were you all naked, exactly?”
“Fuck off.” Dean snarled back and pulled back a chair so he could settle into it. Sam was already counting down the seconds to when his brother would end up asleep across the table, but for the moment Dean was very similar to a large shaved wolverine whose last beer had been stolen, and poking him when he was in that sort of mood was unwise, if funny.
Castiel hoped that this would continue when it related to him.
“Well?” Dean looked from Sam to Cas to Sam again, uncertain what he was supposed to be looking for.
Castiel hesitated, then sighed. “Dean is unconscious.”
“Dean?”
The boy looked bewildered for a moment as though she’d spoken an unfamiliar language, then smiled a little more. How often had he heard ‘good boy,’? Probably not much. She stood, ruffling his hair as she did so, and tried to ignore Dean casting another longing look at the Impala. Cas had requested use of her vehicle instead, so worried about accidentally damaging the mechanical love of Dean’s life, and she could see the reasoning. Still, it was like an enormous temptation with a massive sign hanging over it, and neither boy had shown any restraint when it came to temptations.
“They?” Claire glanced at the couch and stopped again. “That’s .. Sam? But he’s so
Sam was lurking in his own room when Castiel finally located him, a mix of fury, concern and pain in his eyes and still cradling his wrist gently. He looked up as the angel stepped through the door, and almost immediately exploded. Thankfully this was only the verbal type.
“I am sorry.” Castiel said again.
“Yeah..,” Sam sounded uncertain. “Uh. I have a few questions.”
“It’s for
There was the faintest of flushes on Dean’s face before he pulled another face and waved it off.
Castiel was aware of the warm solid form of Dean’s body pressed against his own. Even if he had any appetite, it would have gone in that moment. He sighed and shook his head.
“You mean of our marriage?” Dean said softly, oh so very softly, and Castiel found himself briefly lost for words. Of course he remembered. They all remembered. Only memories weren’t necessarily the best things that could ever happen to people, the truth being a noble thing to strive toward with no consideration of the potential pain.
“Boys, I really need you to talk,” she said, slowly.
“I really,
Jody reviewed the situation in silence for a moment, and then raised her eyes to Castiel in question.
“Can we go in for a drink?” piped up Sam, then flushed. “Please.”
. Holy fuck.
“Okay. How do we un-spell it?” Dean was slightly happier; if a spell hadn’t immediately done its worst then there was a chance to get it removed and he was willing to do anything.
And Cas really did owe him for that ritual suggestion.
“Kinda hoping neither of us are going to be good.” Dean retorted breathlessly, although his words caught in his throat as Castiel stroked him roughly, his face nuzzled in Dean’s neck as he felt the trembles of sensation work their way through his lover’s body. Dean squirmed, back arching on the bed as he panted for air, one hand clawing on the bed as though this might in some way make Castiel speed up.
“It’s not supposed to be good. Look, I’m not.. It’s not..,” Dean frowned harder. “I mean..,”
“Oh, thank the lord! It’s your husband. He’s … well, there’s been an accident. Please, could you come with me?”
Dean froze, which seemed like a good idea at the time. The figure appeared to be asleep, head resting on a pillow and turned slightly toward him with his eyes closed. The blankets covered his lower half, draped over his form, but his upper half was bare and available for scrutiny. Muscular, smooth, curves, with a golden skin that seemed to glow in the morning … was it morning? He didn’t know … probably morning light in a manner that heaven itself would be proud of.
Sam stared at her with the wide eyes of a puppy trying to work out reality, before obediently looking at Dean and then Castiel and then back again.
“No, there’s nothing in the milk. Found Dean?” Annie queried.
“Yeah, I take your point. Let me know if you need anything. You know, food, drink, restraints..,”
They looked at each other a moment longer, before Dean shifted his weight and slowly leaned across to press a kiss to Castiel’s mouth gently. Green eyes opened again to fix him with a still sleepy but significantly more friendly look, a small lopsided, slightly sheepish smile on Dean’s face.
“It might take a bit of time to unearth him. Would you like a coffee?” Politeness was probably the easiest path.
“I don’t know. He was found in the middle of the Glen by some passers by.” Castiel moved back to the bed and slowly sat next to Dean, feeling the mattress dip under his weight. “He has a head injury but I don’t know whether that was pre or post unconsciousness.”
Ultimately, his speculations couldn’t help. Dean would wake in the morning and be keen to cuddle further, to kiss, to do all the things that Castiel had always wondered what it would be like to do with Dean. Asking him would only discover what Dean’s current mind believed was true, and the consequences of any wrong move could be catastrophic.
“Me? You’re the one who got shot full of electricity!” Dean studied him carefully but seemed satisfied by what he saw. Another kiss followed the first, before Dean got into the very serious business of munching sandwiches.
“The wording might have been something like ‘Did you think I wouldn’t notice? You’re an idiot’, but still, the conversation was had.”
Of course it was. Sweetness personified, that was him. Dean offered her another smile that was relaxed as he could make it.
“I -,” Castiel began, but Jody waved him off.
close friends, and okay, he was screwed.
“Okay, fine, have your pet back. But I still need the fluid, and that has to be between a pair who… mm, let’s say
And then there was Cas.
The feelings and sensations within him were undeniably strong, and almost impossible to ignore. Castiel could feel the heat in his lower quarters as though someone had set his underwear on fire, which would be both inaccurate and problematic, and an increasing desire to move, to do
. His vision all but blacked out as he shook, only a soft strangled squeak emerging before his body gave out and sagged downward. The bowl was swiftly removed and Cas had already withdrawn, concerned eyes on him as his angel gently guided him onto his side to recover.
“Dean,
“Yeah, he’s right there, currently using the cloak of invisibility.” Jody raised an eyebrow and gestured to the empty space next to her.
His own brand of adorable insanity squirmed in his sleep, shifting his weight before settling again with a soft, sleepy moan. Castiel found the smile on his lips before he was even aware of making it. It was certainly wrong to feel so strongly about a human, but then out of all the wrong things he had done over the many years Castiel felt this was one that he was satisfied to do. But then even that was a poor interpretation of what could be, full of what ifs and could haves and regret for not taking the moment.
“I see. And you would prefer if I engaged with you?”
“I wasn’t planning on it, no.”
Not that this was surprising. Dean found he couldn’t turn his gaze away from the man dressed in what seemed to be dark blue robes, his hands raised and his gaze staring over the heads of the congregation surrounding him to an unknown spot in the trees. Any murmurings had died away to silence now, a few lights flickering in the woods as they watched and waited.
“Anyway, you get the point. The whole thing is supposed to
“I know you’re really old, but we’re not your kids.” he pointed out. Castiel was even more perplexed.
After that, they’d spent a couple of hours in the yard, digging, running, getting so up close to nature that Jody was pretty sure they could grow potatoes in the muck in Dean’s ears. Yet another bath, and the duck was sunk again by the boat. Sam advised it was due to duck warfare, and Jody couldn’t disagree with him.
“It’s Sam.” Dean interjected fiercely. Balthazar raised an eyebrow.
“We tried to carry him back but he was really heavy,” the first woman explained apologetically. “He might have a bruised leg from where we dropped him.”
Confused, Dean glanced up only to find Balthazar’s amused expression over Castiel’s shoulder.
His own body’s betrayal was also becoming the lesser of his problems as Dean shifted position in his sleep again, making a small noise that was half yawn, half squeak, which was quite frankly adorable, and his arm lazily slid downward before resting once again as Dean fell back into a deeper sleep.
“I did.” Sam hesitated. “Okay, it might have been a little blunt, and there was drink involved, but it was discussed at a high level.”
“We should not be doing this.” Castiel warned.
“Hello, my darling,” said the woman with the long red hair. Castiel gave Jody a long suffering look, and a small, tiny nod of the head in greeting. Jody felt her heart sink and a wash of cold sweep over her. Oh.
“It’s a spell.” he said finally and reluctantly. Well, no kidding.
Gasping, licking his lips, still all but vibrating on the spot, Dean raised his head to shout something when Balthazar gave him a little wink.
The words died in his throat and for a good few moments there was nothing but silence, Dean’s tired, weary eyes looking at him with a steadiness that Castiel was certain he didn’t like. There was mud on his skin, a dried streak of blood, and a distinct disheveled appearance to his clothing, but that was normal for a Winchester. His eyes, however… no.
“Because if you were,” Castiel said calmly. “I might have some options.”
Castiel studied the ceiling with intensity. Sadly, as a distraction, it was not sufficient. There were several small cracks and a slightly uneven colour, but these minor defects had no chance of allowing his mind to stray from the very real fact that Dean’s wrist was brushing against the head of his cock every time that Castiel breathed, and breathing was an event that was certainly on the To Do pile.
“Well, thank you. And you both could help by getting them prepared, you know.”
a good idea, but approaching the place as legal enforcers or other public bodies hadn’t found anything and the whole key seemed to be people rather than supernatural hauntings.
“Well, well. Aren’t you spunky.” Another half smile and Balthazar pressed a kiss to Castiel’s neck before withdrawing enough to allow his angel brother to move. Dean was about to respond when Castiel’s movements stole any words he was planning to make, slow at first but growing in strength and intensity as the angel gripped his hips harder.
“Let me guess,” Dean said, and his voice was rough. “Needs some blood, doesn’t it?”
Removing his shoes, Castiel hesitated with anything else until Dean chuckled again, although this time it was a significantly more carefree noise.
This again caused a point of conflict. Cas wanted to explore. Dean was pretty damned certain they shouldn’t. There were
“Cas.. c’mon..,” Dean was squirming on the bed again, his hand tightening on the muscle of Castiel’s arm although this seemed to be an instinctual movement as he panted out his demands. Castiel’s willpower, already battered and bruised, stood no chance. Pausing to steal one last hungry kiss, he moved to line himself up and paused to survey the dishevelled, flustered but defiant Winchester lying beneath him.
Dean was aware of soft chanting in the background, the occasional familiar latin word showing up every so often, but it was of no more concern to him than background diner music. The hand on Dean’s ass tightened a little as Castiel began to explore, Dean leaning forward into the embrace and still scanning Cas’ eyes as though searching for a fear that the whole thing was a joke. But no, Cas was all but radiating sincerity and Dean slowly allowed himself to respond in the manner his body was demanding.
“Oh? Oh, yeah. Well, Sam knows my tastes,” Dean offered. Cas frowned at him a little more.
“Sorry.” Castiel took a tiny step backwards and Dean discovered how to breath again. He cast a look at the pair again, and agreed privately that both of them were seemingly interested in them with an intensity that normally didn’t bode well. Great. This was definitely under the microscope, although at least their stalkers brought dinner with them.
“-and you have looked after him since he was a baby through very hard times. You have a strong bond, and this devotion is one of the reasons I value you as much as I do. Please, do not put it at risk,”
Ergo, the two small boys in various colours of plaid and slightly battered had to be Sam and Dean for reasons she couldn’t even begin to imagine. On the plus side, they didn’t seem to be baby demons.
Castiel smiled gently.
Apparently Sam caught the hint as the pause seemed to get even more solid. Finally there was a soft noise at the end of the phone which could have been a number of things.
They were sitting in the car on the border of the town. Well, town was a little extreme. There was a shop, a couple of houses, some farm land, and The Glen. Not even a bar, and that really,
Licking his lips again, he glanced at Balthazar almost in warning - this was not to be discussed afterwards for fear of whatever supernatural creature was the scariest - before dropping down to lean on his forearms and slowly, carefully, sliding the tip of the angel’s erection into his mouth. He tasted like honey, honest to god honey, and that was just fucked up. Did Cas taste the same? Was this an angel thing? Didn’t know. Wanted to know, though. Really,
“Although, on that note,” Dean added carefully. “We probably have to get going. You know, people to save, things to hunt… If you could possibly take us back to the car..?”
Of course this had not been Sam’s opening gambit. The younger Winchester had started with a little more tact but it had rapidly vanished over a few grunts and a lot of scowling from a still dozy Dean. Dean hadn’t been fully asleep when they had arrived, battling his eyelids for dominance, but he certainly hadn’t been fully involved in the world, and an irritable Sam had gone down as well as the proverbial lead balloon.
. The house is probably bugged, everyone will be watching, probably cameras and microphones in multiple places as well. Once we’re in, no talking about plans or anything outside of the cover story, clear?
me?!”
“You’re gonna adopt them if this carries on much longer,” Annie had observed after one storybook session, and Jody had shushed her, but what
“Went for a run.”
“We’re not
! Let go! I have a
“Fix what?”
“Don’t worry about it, okay?” he scanned the blue eyes in front of him and gently kissed a beautifully soft mouth. Cas’ kisses were always so delicate, like he was torn between lust and guilt and barely there, and this one lingered so gently.
“Mm.” Sam made a soft noise at the back of his throat, but remained watchful. They hadn’t been out for a few weeks so it was unlikely Dean had picked up anything weird from some sort of case, and as far as he knew Dean had no additional internal strife he was working through that hadn’t been already present a month ago. His diet was normal for Dean - horrific - and even his alcohol consumption was slightly lower than before. And yet here he was, all tiredness and anger, waggling a finger in Sam’s direction that didn’t look like it had the energy to remain rigid.
“I am going to roll you onto the bed,” he warned softly. “My foot is going to sleep.”
“What sort of bribe are we talking?”
Castiel swallowed, which seemed extremely necessary at that exact moment.
“You can heal me up afterwards if something goes wrong.” Dean wriggled impatiently. The angel lifted his head incredulously.
, tell him I have to do this! My sword is really, really strong, it can fight off
And it was all lies.
Dean confirmed that it was indeed fantastic, and slowly pushed himself off the floor. He offered a small, sheepish grin to Sam, but at least his brother was alive. Highly suspicious and alive, looking between him and Castiel and alive, giving him a particular ‘we will have words later on’ expression and alive, but alive nevertheless.
There was another long silence from the other end of the phone. Jody smiled again. The drawings needed a lot of explanation from both the boys, but they had eagerly expanded on the images.
Castiel believed this type of situation was the reason for the creation of the word ‘um’.
“Can we just get him out of here?” Dean was begging and he didn’t care, not now, not ever, and Castiel simply pressed a gentle hand on his shoulder as he focused on Sam’s prone body. Dean hugged Sam a little closer and looked around them just in case something worse was planning to fuck up their night further. Still couldn’t see shit in this space; it was night, any lights in this area being broken, shadows on top of shadows on top of darkness. Wasn’t even a decent surface to put him on, cold and concrete and damp, with the occasional grass growing in the cracks and the rustle of rats somewhere in the background.
“Come now, do you really want either of them to remain at this age? You’d be grey within a month.” her eyebrow twitched upwards idly. “Greyer, anyway. And the risks are
“Well, that remains to be seen,” her gaze sharpened on the nearest boy, Dean, for a moment, and then lifted her black bag up to explore within it. “Curses can be a tricky beast to conquer, especially when we haven’t entirely discovered the provenance of the item. Still, there are some spells that act as a good general purpose, and we can but try.”
“I don’t believe I said he wasn’t, to be fair. But he is a friend, and he knows magic. He will come through for us, I have no doubt.”
“I doubt whether heaven had anything to do with the sex rule,” Castiel spoke up from the back. Dean sighed.
The kiss moved from light to hard to desperate in a short space of time. Dean cupped Castiel’s face in his hands, controlling and guiding the embrace even as the angel moved to meet him. They were flushed and panting when the kiss broke, an intense look in Dean’s eye that was either frantic or starving as his hands moved from the gentle caress to an obvious attempt to rip off Castiel’s clothes.
That seemed to please Dean even further. A small smile, a happy look to his eyes and Dean pressed another little kiss to his cheek before wandering toward the bedroom and clothing. Castiel released the breath he’d been holding and closed his eyes. Dear god, there were difficult tasks and then there was this.
“He’s now king of hell.” Castiel pointed out.
Panting, aching, Dean slowly lifted his head to see Sam jump from the bandstand and Castiel step forward, the angel’s eyes glowing as his hands rose-
Castiel pushed himself into a run and headed back to the house. Perhaps Dean was hunting for Sam. Perhaps his mind had become confused. Perhaps- perhaps a lot of things, and most of them unpleasant. The knowledge that others in the community were under so much strain did nothing but add to his concerns. Would Dean have run? Would he have fallen? He didn’t know. He
“Yes. Yes, it is. They’re providing you with an entire house, Dean. If you were some evil plotter, would you miss that opportunity?” Sam raised an eyebrow.
This seemed an automatic situation with them, but Castiel was still coming to terms with the potential romantic relationship. He looked at Sam again, his confusion clear on his face.
“Guys, c’mon, concentrate.” Sam thrust a pamphlet toward Castiel, and aimed another at Dean who looked at it with the suspicion normally afforded to unexploded bombs. “Reason we’re here isn’t the rules, it’s the fact that they keep having dead people turn up every year. Oh, and there’s been a few complaints that it’s a brainwashing cult and they forget their families, but that’s kinda normal for these types of places.”
Which was a lie, that was from the brochure, but who was counting. Castiel was still eyeing him carefully, and Dean kissed him again, a little deeper, enjoying the taste and the feel of the man’s mouth against his own. Yeah, okay, he could get used to it, and there was another ripple of need and sensation that shot down his spine as the other man began to cautiously kiss him back. Only for a moment though, a flicker of change before the man went back to prim and proper. Perhaps he was one of those people who liked romantic gestures at set schedules.
“I don’t know what you mean, that’s why I asked.” the angel protested softly, then lifted his head and studied the head of the table again. Dean tensed as he felt Castiel move closer to him until the angel was gently pressing against his back, his mouth close enough to Dean’s ear that he could feel his breath again. Dean fought down the shiver that was working traitorously down his spine and tried to focus. This was ridiculously hard.
Castiel politely waited for him to turn his head.
“Oh, thank god-,”
There was still silence from Castiel’s side and Dean wasn’t sure whether he risked looking at him either. What the hell was worse? Disgust or interest? He licked his lips again and looked down at himself, finally beginning to slowly take off his jacket before there was another little huff of annoyance and a click of fingers. Things suddenly got a whole lot draughtier as his clothes vanished.
As it turned out, dinner was pretty kickable as well. Sam had already retreated to his hotel with his laptop and a book, and the Great Hall beckoned. And it was definitely both Great and a Hall, a wooden thing that looked as though it had been converted from a working farm barn. A huge wooden table laden with various pots and plates a la Hogwarts sat in the centre and there were smaller tables scattered around with benches. Light fittings hung from the ridiculously high ceiling, and already there were several couples milling around, talking, laughing, looking both at ease with the situation and extremely confident.
now. Pretty good at it. C’mon.” Dean’s hand brushed over Cas’ groin again with enough sensation that it stopped all rational thought for a good few seconds. So very,
“C’mon Cas, it’s okay. Witches aren’t exactly real, remember?” Dean rolled his eyes as he finished the bacon and started on his coffee. The funny look intensified further. Fuck. Was the man a Wiccan or something? Or perhaps he was heavily religious. You could never tell with people, look all normal and then bam! Weird shit like ghosts and guardian angels.
“It was your suggestion and he wanted to explore the community,” Castiel explained. “He was gone an hour. I’ve checked him over and he just seems to be asleep.”
“All good, Cas.” Dean watched him as the shirt slipped on, and then even further as Cas sat on the bed and slowly moved into position. His added weight dipped the mattress enough that Dean all but rolled into him naturally, something that the elder Winchester seemed perfectly content about.
“You wish to object?” Surely not, the tone of Castiel’s voice suggested. Dean pouted a little more, but neither agreement nor objection emerged, and he remained still. Castiel smiled in pleasure. He was a very good boy, and it was clear from the lifting of the sulkiness that Dean basked in this pride.
There was a long pause at the other end of the phone. “We talking bottle of alcohol unconscious, got into a fight unconscious or just … unconscious unconscious?”
Castiel’s arm tightened around Dean’s chest protectively. “Understood.”
And there was Dean, sitting in the middle, forlorn and lost and uncertain. It turned out that a physical angel blade was not always required for a significant cut to the heart.
And then of course there was Cas. Yeah, he needed to remember more about how they met and those little details and memories and shared knowledge, but hell, they had the rest of their lives to create new ones. In the great scheme of things, who cared? Cas watched over him carefully, solemn and protective, and although he wasn’t jumping immediately into bed after the incident - a shame - it still felt good, like having his own personal guardian angel to watch over him.
man next to him. Within ten minutes Dean had shifted positions slightly to cuddle closer, a soft mumble in his throat and his arm gently resting itself across Castiel’s stomach.
“They’ve been doing well,” Jody replied, a little defensively.
Dean’s hand moved to rest on Castiel’s, and he felt the angel relax behind him at the touch. Past that point he lost a few hours as he slipped into a doze, only waking a little while later at a noise in the room and the fact that the hard wooden floor was beginning to make some of his joints ache.
“Would it kill you both to.. I don’t know, mix it up a little with your clothing?”
“Dean, I mean it.” she scanned his eyes when he finally and reluctantly looked her way. “I know you’re a big boy, but you need to wait. I don’t want you hurt, do you understand? You staying away from the car would make me very happy.”
“Like fuck you are.” Dean protested, but allowed him to slowly, painfully get to his feet. Not that standing worked for very long; a few seconds later and Cas had sagged again, Dean immediately taking his weight. Weirdly reluctantly, Cas finally slid his arm around Dean’s neck and they slowly, carefully, made their way back to the house.
“Oh? Well, that’s really awesome of you. Thanks,” he smiled back again and lifted the basket slightly as a small salute, before slowly easing back into the house and clicking the door closed again. He stared down wordlessly at the offered basket of bacon and bread products and sighed, before turning around and looking up.
“... you were engaged sexually?” Castiel repeated, uncertainly. “As brothers, is that not-,”
Dean pushed himself up, setting the coffee down on the table for a moment as he drew closer to Castiel. The man looked a little startled as Dean placed his hand lightly on his arm, and then even more bewildered as Dean gently raised Castiel’s chin with his other hand and gently, cautiously, pressed a soft kiss to his mouth in apology.
“I know.” Cas growled softly. “And yes.”
“It’s not bad, just surprising.”
It was welcome to see Dean’s desire so plainly spelled out. However, this did not necessarily mean that Dean would be leading all activities. With the truth acknowledged, finally,
Dean gave him a brief glance in the mirror. Castiel’s brow was furrowed in thought, his bright blue eyes trained on the pamphlet as though it might contain the word of god, or at least a description of how to act as a newly married couple. Hell, even Dean wasn’t sure how you acted. Got drunk a lot and then go bang in the marital bed, surely? Probably not what Sam wanted.
Dean was about to drop the clothes on the floor when Castiel’s eyebrow rose in silent question; there was another little pause before Dean delicately and deliberately folded them and placed them on a nearby chair.
Cas hesitated. It was true they were supposed to walk around the wood, but if the bandstand had caused Dean’s issue then bringing him back to the location seemed foolhardy, walking in a tiger’s lair whilst covered in ketchup. He looked at Sam who studied the photo again.
“My … relationship?”
“Cas, it’s okay. Stop looking at me as though you’re worried I’m going to stab you.” Dean added. Only it wasn’t himself Castiel was worried about getting stabbed. The lines on Dean’s face spoke of his tiredness, and the cheerful, carefree expression had long departed, leaving only a what if and a should be once again.
“Please do not go into the situation too deeply.”
Sam, on the other hand, clearly didn’t care.
, he had explained, and Cas had given him a shocked look as though Dean had grown two heads and various unusual body parts. Dean still had no idea why. Rules were
“I..,”
Standing wasn’t cutting it any more, but the circle didn’t have a damned bed in it so in the end they sank down to their knees, bodies still aligned and a new kiss deepening as they did so. One of Cas’ hands had made it to Dean’s head, running fingers through his short hair as Dean’s own hands had snuck around the angel’s back and pulled him as close as physically possible without possession getting involved.
“Probably. You’ll be lucky if they’re not in the bathroom as well.”
There was a very long hesitation on that. Dean paused, and then squinted over his shoulder suspiciously.
There was a little pause of silence.
“Cas.” The name was a tease.
“It’s in your hand!”
Controlling his breathing only got him so far. He could feel the need burn through him, a warmth to his neck and cheeks, and an agony deep inside that surely should have been some type of design error. This was a dangerous situation, and furthermore-
“Castiel, please, m’begging you.” And he really was, this wasn’t a game anymore. Dean opened his eyes and stared upward at Balthazar in front of him again, still dazed but with a growing need to do
“Mm. Getting worried about you. You need to eat at
And troubled was certainly a milder version of the word he was planning to use. This was becoming harder by the moment, and certainly unethical. Castiel straightened his shoulders, a fine, soldier like movement that did absolutely nothing for his strength of mind, nor the persistent want that seemed to be a worm burying itself in his head, whispering possibilities. Inappropriate possibilities. Possibilities that would definitely not be what a friend would do for another, and yet the softness in Dean’s eyes and the tease in his smile were difficult invitations to ignore.
Sam was looking ruffled, dark circles under his eyes and his hair a mess, but the look on his face was a confused frown. Castiel had managed to get himself both dressed and stood up in the corner, an unreadable expression on his face as he folded his arms and leaned against the wall in what was probably an idle way.
“Technically, yes. Get with the programme, sweetheart.” Balthazar drawled, and Dean was conscious of the angel’s gaze down his now fully naked body. Balthazar raised an eyebrow and glanced toward Castiel. “Okay. I can see the appeal. Gag him and it would be better.”
,” Dean said, a little sharper, before his voice softened again. “Jesus. How often is it that we have something that
Castiel frowned at him, puzzled. There were many potential risks involved, but his own physical wellbeing was definitely low on the list short of an unexpected building explosion. Dean was looking at him in a mix of defiance and faint nervousness and Castiel slowly began to understand the stance. Ah, yes. The Convenient Excuse. Sam had mentioned something about that on another drunken evening, punctuated with a bit of arm flailing and some colourful language.
And for a little while there was no movement. The sandwiches stayed on their little plate. The hot chocolate cooled on the side, a rogue marshmallow still gamely floating. The occasional sound of passersby on the road outside, a laugh, a vehicle, the call of an owl in the nearby trees. Castiel’s arm still curled around Dean as though it might in some way protect him against a situation that Dean didn’t even know was occurring. And Castiel watched him, carefully, conscientiously, a moral battle fighting within him as he surveyed the boyish features of his ‘husband’, the dark eyelashes against his pale but slightly muddy cheek, the occasional freckle, the innocence that shone through whenever Dean wasn’t fighting.
“You are
And furthermore? Might be fun.
“Well, yes.” Castiel looked blank. “He said it was somewhat blatant.”
“Bear says we should.” he said. “But only because of safety.”
“This would not be-,” Castiel began again, but Jody shushed him a second time. The angel settled back down with a distressed look on his face, clearly disliking the idea of an upset Dean. Some things never changed regardless of how large Dean was at the time.
“You have not done anything.” Castiel elaborated. “I’m sorry. I’m just worried,”
And, to a certain extent, Castiel wasn’t entirely sure that wasn’t the right position to take. Certainly, the fabric encasing their lower halves had not been removed, but this fact had not stopped the fact that he had liked the closeness of Dean’s body very much indeed. His erection was already rock hard and significantly more uncomfortable than it normally was, and Castiel had worried about this fact for several hours until he had decided that this was almost certainly fruitless. Dean would respond as he would respond, and he had never been particularly prudist surrounding sexual activity.
“Because I’m the only one who could do the ritual, keep up Sam.” Balthazar looked at him as though he was crazy. “You were sick, you needed some help, we did a ritual, and now you’re up and talking and alive and isn’t that fantastic? That
Castiel let out a soft breath.
“No one has mentioned it either.” Castiel said slowly. “And I have asked a lot of questions,”
“Dean..,” Castiel took a step toward him and then paused as Dean failed to even flicker. The comfort of seeing him whole slowly began to slip away. “... Dean?”
“You’d prefer me to fuck you?”
They looked at Sam blankly. Sam stared back at them, and then held up his phone showing the last text from Dean. Castiel studied the image, and then looked at Dean who shrugged his lack of knowledge.
?” she insisted.
“Holy fuck..!”
“Sam.”
“I believe so.” Balthazar rolled the words in his mouth thoughtfully as he considered the matter. “It’ll need a few ingredients, though.”
“Dean.
It was Castiel’s solemn opinion that the Winchesters used the word ‘fine’ very wrongly. He frowned again, a little harder. The day had been difficult enough as it was without additional unnecessary riddles being added to the equation.
“What’s up?” he paused. “Metaphorically speaking, I don’t need a list of birds or planets.”
In answer, the angel slowly began to move, a small motion at first to withdraw slightly and then thrust in a little deeper. He could feel Dean’s tight body respond to him, gripping him tightly and causing Dean to arch his back a little and groan weakly in response.
“The Glen is an open community set up about twenty years ago by a couple of farmers and a ‘health enthusiast’, a guy called Herb Beiner. It’s grown since that time, and now they’ve got around twenty five to thirty different family groups staying there, each with a home on little to no rent as long as they stuck to the primary rules; cohesion, helping with the farm land every so often, and no alcohol.”
, Cas leaned forward and pressed a soft, warm kiss onto his mouth. The electricity reached a whole new Pikachu level, and Dean felt rather than heard himself gasp as the touch sent a shiver down his spine to add to the growing heat in his groin.
“He occasionally has dizzy spells,” Castiel offered, and gently shooed them from the residence. “I’ve found that checking him for injury and then letting him sleep it off is the best route. He should be fine, don’t worry.”
“Are you okay?”
“Wow, they really
“Please,” Dean whimpered when hints were clearly not working. Castiel smiled to himself as his hand settled into a lingering movement, thumb sliding over the slick head of Dean’s cock and feeling the man jerk against him violently before Dean whined again as the rhythm began to build with a slow determination.
There was a small pause from Dean and a little frown to suggest that this was something he hadn’t considered.
going to work-,” Jody paused as the small boy appeared as though by magic at the doorway, looking dustier than ever and with a few new smear marks across his cheeks that made him look as though he was about to appear in a baby version of Lord Of The Flies. In his hand he clutched his little sword, the other the teddy bear. He looked immensely proud of himself.
“Oh no. Both of you,
Dean felt the nervousness hit, and scowled automatically. When concerned, pretend you weren’t, hide that bastard with a shit ton of anger and sprinkle some fury and rage over the top as well. He was pretty damned sure it never fooled Castiel much, especially not with the sorrowful look that the angel gave him as though he was feeling every single one of Dean’s fears and worries, but it made him feel a little less like freshly splattered roadkill.
“We do!”
. I’m so sorry, I just always call people’s partners their boyfriend or girlfriend, and I guess it’s a habit-,”
“In this location, no one would know that we were working outside of the script.” Castiel observed. There was another huff from Dean.
And then, silence.
A quick survey had revealed a big sign on the nearest stairs that announced that no one should enter, and Dean automatically followed that instruction without question. Cas, surprisingly, was another matter. He had prowled around the edges as though surveying it for woodworm, looking suspiciously at anything that looked more carved or funky than normal. He’d even started to go onto the main platform before Dean had insisted that he stop.
“Bullets only really work on people, not scary things.” Okay, people were often scary things but she didn’t want to get too technical. “I need you and Sam to help us protect the house while Cas is gone. Do you think you can do that for me?”
“Exactly. Gave him ambition.”
Whether it was good or not was soon to be tested; he was easing himself into the trenchcoat as the longer of two options when he suddenly noticed movement from the window and realised that someone was heading toward the door with a packet.
Dean himself was half asleep, his exhaustion comforted by Castiel’s warmth and closeness. Through his daze he was conscious of Cas’ light kisses on his neck and shoulder, the way that his legs hooked over his own and Castiel’s own scent which seemed to lean more toward a light vanilla than the honey musk that Balthazar seemed to favour.
Another thoughtful look across the angel’s face before he gave a little shake of the head. “It would be hard to enter into the more aggressive dreams, especially if the subject isn’t either expecting it or welcome to the intrusion. In my experience, it just makes them worse and associates whoever it is with whatever trauma they are seeing. And it would help if we knew what we were up against.”
“I know which one it is. I would prefer not to say.”
Well, that made no sense. “Why?”
Dean trailed off as they both reviewed the last sentence. The little ball of hope found some more fuel. Dean, on the other hand, looked sick, but Castiel was familiar with that type of expression. That was realisation, and it was rare that it was a comfortable thought to dig into. The path of least resistance had significant appeal.
A few minutes of assessment later and he had stood up again, a small frown on his face as Balthazar studied the still sleeping Sam.
There was another soft noise that was harder to translate, but it seemed relatively positive. Dean lifted his head slightly to study him a little more before failing to hide another yawn and floomping back into the pillow. Castiel took the opportunity to gently brush some of the fallen locks away from Dean’s forehead. It was a movement that would achieve absolutely no purpose other than to make himself happy, but the angel felt that this might be acceptable under the circumstances. Certainly Dean seemed to be quite happy with the mildly intimate gesture, his eyes closing as though a cat being petted.
“You are not and we will be having words later on,” Castiel replied sternly, and then nodded to Sam again to lead him out the back where the water pipes or whatever the damned thing they were fixing was. Probably some mains or something, not that Dean really noticed the water pressure being anything bad.
“.... but?” God, he hated buts, or at least the verbal types. Especially if they were big.
“Right!” Dean looked determined and then scuttled away as soon as Castiel released his hold. Jody could already hear him in the dining room poking around in what was probably a thorough but destructive job.
The small ball of hope dampened a little more. Castiel kept his expression as neutral as possible and tilted his head in acknowledgement.
She paused as she looked over the room again, resting fingers on the handle of the door. Finally she closed it behind her, leaving only a bear and rabbit to stand guard on the shelving near the window.
Castiel looked confused.
thing.
In a really messed up situation, it all felt remarkably .. normal.
there was an opportunity to try things that Castiel had only thought about. Inappropriate things. Very inappropriate things. And they were glorious.
Clarification rather than assumption? Dean must be nervous. Still, it was always good to check, and Castiel managed to press another light kiss on a random part of Dean - his shoulder he thought, but there had been enough wriggling not to know what was pressed where - and make a soothing noise at the back of his throat.
There was no other answer than yes. The woman ran ahead of him into the woodland, and Castiel had a brief acknowledgement of the potential trap before completely dismissing it as irrelevant if Dean was in trouble. He was his fake husband, his friend and his.. Well, that element was still under question, and Castiel still had little knowledge of how to tackle the thoughts and feelings that drifted through him when Dean was in question. He was a fascinating man. Perhaps sometimes too fascinating.
Cas still seemed to be dazed as Dean carefully placed him on the couch and dropped to a crouch next to him anxiously. C’mon.
“Dean?” Jody shifted position to look at him better. “You okay, sweetheart?”
Sam fixed him an impatient look that suggested this had already been covered multiple times. It probably had, but Sam talked so much that occasionally Dean just tuned him out for his own sanity.
“Then we’re good, right?”
“Gonna explode. Please let me explode. I wanna explode.” Dean’s head dropped again, his legs widening again and all but impaling himself on the cock each time, gripping it as much as he could with his internal muscles and hearing Cas gasp as he did so. Well, it seemed only fair to share the agony, as long as he was fucking alive to enjoy it, and if this carried on Dean wasn’t sure whether he would be.
Despite their tendencies for mischief, Jody smiled fondly. Bless their little destructive hearts. Drinks it was, and a few cartoons to calm them down. And then, the bigger goal - nap time.
, and he stared at the car again just in case that was going to give him a hint. She didn’t. Could get Sammy anywhere, but where the fuck was he going to take him?
“Force him? Please. He’s a big boy, he can work out what he wants to do.” Balthazar looked back at Dean thoughtfully, and ran his thumb lightly over Dean’s lips again. “Isn’t that right, sweetheart?”
“Cas is going!” Dean shouted. The wide eyes got bigger.
Debatable. Castiel cast another look at Dean and then immediately away again as though eyes were scalded by burning light.
Dean raised an eyebrow to signify this was neither a suitable reason, nor a reasonable excuse. Castiel sighed internally. Sometimes he really wished that humans came with a manual.
“I’ll keep you updated with their progress. You let me know if you need anything, okay?”
Cas seemed to enjoy the touch, his eyes closing briefly in clear relaxation for a moment. Balthazar was still murmuring softly in his ear but for whatever reason it felt unthreatening, a small smile playing on Castiel’s lips before the angel opened his eyes and fixed Dean with a look so hungry that the Big Bad Wolf could probably get lessons.
He sighed internally again. This wasn’t the first argument he’d witnessed, strangely intimate moments between the brothers where the pair demonstrated their close bond by identifying each other’s vulnerabilities and deftly stamping on them, but normally either food, time or a good walk resolved the issue enough that pleasantries could return. However, this particular argument appeared to have more muscle behind it, a stronger desire to revolt against Sam’s request, and that was disconcerting.
“Thanks.”
It definitely wasn’t okay, or anywhere near okay. Castiel tried to stare at the ceiling again, but the options were severely limited. Finally he released his breath and tried to think of how he should approach such a conversation. Experience failed him.
Dean opened his mouth to speak again before lifting his other hand - with bear still attached - and rubbed his eye with the ball of his hand in the same way as he had when smaller. He focused on the bear and frowned.
“C’mon.” he mumbled. “Do it. Need you. Please.”
Turning a corner, Dean stopped to take a breath. Woodland. Who the hell built houses around woodland, anyway? Trees and trees and the occasional squirrel or werewolf if you were unlucky. It was like they’d tried to make a tiny little Central Park in their little gated world, and failed miserably. Muttering to himself, Dean turned another corner and skidded to a halt.
… it was a good question, and one that Castiel did not have an immediate answer to. The broken water system would not save him now, and Castiel looked into the eyes of a man who firmly and utterly believed they were one.
There was definitely a laugh about that.
Dean looked a little doubtful, before finally offering a little smile and a nod. “Okay. If it makes you happy.”
“Cas?” Dean appealed to the other wild card, the card that hadn’t been seen in months, the constantly distracted card, and for weeks Dean had sworn he wouldn’t buckle and give in to Castiel’s little silences. But this was different, surely? This was Sam, and Cas probably had the power to do .. well, something.
It’s not fair, Dean’s taken my thing!”
“Cas.” Balthazar spoke finally with a strained voice, and Dean was about to ask what was going on when he felt Cas grip him tighter, one final, deep and hard thrust in him and his angel stopped dead, tense for a moment before shuddering against him as he came. This apparently was the cue, as Balthazar came next, Dean unable to pull away as the hot, sweet come flooded his mouth and was swallowed just as quickly as the most practical way to get rid of it.
,” Dean was sitting bolt upright in bed, arms folded with his sword propped on one side and bear tucked in with him. There was a pout on his face that was ruining the impact of his objection, but Jody wasn’t planning to tell him that. Sam was nestled in his own little camp bed hugging his little green bunny and watching the disagreement in interest.
“Shhh,” Dean held up a hand and returned the smile, carefully shuffling out the door and letting it close a little. Thank god for bushes that meant he wasn’t immediately visible to the road. “Sorry, he’s asleep-,”
“Which, as everyone knows, is the best kind of magic,” Balthazar replied idly as he entered the room and stretched his shoulders. “Okay. Let’s see.”
The deception was beginning to weigh heavily on him. The original concept had been both a surprise and contained a little worry - perhaps his mannerisms would be off putting to Dean, or perhaps he would take these emotional touches too far and cause discomfort - but Sam had assured him privately that Dean was ‘so damned oblivious to the things in front of his nose that there was no risk of subtle behaviours having any effect’. Either way, Dean was aware of the intentional deception.
Castiel raised his head and watched his friend walk around the room with the happy, casual smile of someone who was deeply satisfied with his current life. He could not remember the last time he’d seen Dean that carefree, or at least not without some type of alcohol in his hand at the time. His eyes were soft and warm, his concern about Castiel’s well being genuine, and his enthusiasm for their union was … ardent.
That was not the most comforting thing she’d ever heard.
“Right. We’re in, we’re here, we’ve got about an hour to go before .. what, dinner? And then we’ll go out exploring.” Dean rubbed his hands together. “It’s bound to all kick off after dark.”
. Just leave me alone.” the words were delivered through gritted teeth, both hands curled into fists and tension outlined throughout his body. Castiel sighed. This was neither ‘fine’, nor how he would have wished this conversation to have gone.
“Want to suck on my finger, boy?” he murmured, eyes playful. “Or is that just going to be a placeholder for something else?”
Weary green eyes studied him as though suspecting he was on some type of illicit street drug.
Dean growled again. Need he could cope with. Base instincts sounded National Geographic level.
“Oh, and they’ve both needed two baths today. It’s been a bit of a mucky day.” she didn’t know why she added that bit, but currently Castiel was forming part of this fake parent-group so baths had to be part of it. “They like bubbles.”
Dean ran his tongue across his bottom lip hungrily. Weird, really. Early that morning he’d had to really think about where he was and what was going on. Now, it was just so damned natural. Any worries or fears or concerns seemed to have just melted away, and he was free to accept what was right in front of him. And that something was damned good, from his mournful eyes to his really tight calves. Had he ever really focused on someone’s calves? Couldn’t remember. Probably not, there were surely other better body parts to consider, and yet every part of Cas seemed fantastic in a way.
He had assumed that pleasurable adjustments would be welcomed, but then it almost certainly was not on a human list of possible things. Dean gently smacked him on the stomach.
The column had finally led to the bandstand, and Dean felt Cas’ hand tense. He winced internally. Okay, that was probably fair. Getting zapped with electricity wasn’t something you were going to forget.
“Sam.”
“He still being a dick?” he snapped. “Honestly, Cas, I don’t know what you see in him sometimes.”
“I am okay. I just … don’t know whether this is a good time.”
“None. I am hoping that a few contacts might know, although some of those contacts are … questionable.” Cas tapped his finger on the glass in thought before looking up with a particular expression. Jody knew that expression well. It had a very regular occurrence at the sheriff’s office whenever people had cases they didn’t really want to do.
“No.” Dean snarled.
“That’s not a reason.”
“No thank you, Dean.”
Dean gave her a suspicious look that suggested the little boy was definitely getting a better idea on what was and wasn’t good for hunters to know. Not that Jody reckoned Dean remembered what he was training for anymore; Dean’s conversations had moved onto almost standard children’s tales of things that were creepy, and most of them seemed cartoon level. Still, that wasn’t a bad thing. They were little; they didn’t need to know what hunters were. As long as they had their special things that kept them safe then she was happy.
The fantastic parts of him were even better with the little touches here and there. A hand resting on his shoulder. A little hand hold. A brush against his back whenever Cas moved past him, a soft murmur in his ear that sent a shiver down his spine. Little shows of affection, and the community seemed more than happy to witness it. Hell, they’d even encouraged them to go to the ceremony the next day and Dean was fully up for it. This was their community, the rituals kinda came with it all. Seemed ridiculous to fight it.
“Mm,”
“Yeah, isn’t it? I’m telling you Cas, this place is a real find. They’re so supportive. It’s like they’re watching over us.”
Finally,
Dean looked uncertain, a super tough protector who appeared to be quite interested in a small fuzzy teddy bear. For a moment Jody wondered whether the boy had ever actually
As he moved to the sink, leaning down and finding a subtle way to break the system with a quick twist, his eyes moved back to the door that Dean had vanished through. The man was quite certain they were married. Castiel had no idea whether that would prove to be good or bad; his mind had wandered to such a situation in the past, but that was with someone who was fully aware of his surroundings and history and implications. Dean might be willing, but he had no information to base his decision on. The situation should be clear.
And that had a whole load of implications of what they’d be doing if Dean didn’t find his brother important, but Dean wasn’t sure he wanted to enter that rabbit hole. He sighed and crouched down again next to Sam’s side, checking his temperature for no other reason than he didn’t know what else to do, and taking solace in the simple way that Sam’s chest rose and fell with each breath. Keep breathing, Sammy. It would be fine. He’d make it fine, he promised.
“We want to hear the story.” Sam said.
“Cas..,” His name was a broken plea. “C’mon, man! That’s not
“Hey, Cas.”
Castiel nodded solemnly. “Has he said why?”
“And that way would be..?” he prompted. Sam gave him another awkward look, a small flush rising to his cheeks before he looked away.
“I…,” Dean looked at him wretchedly. “.. I don’t know.”
They stared at her silently. She looked between them incredulously before closing her eyes and rubbing her temple with a finger.
Castiel sighed and gazed toward the window. How to approach this subject with tact and decorum and .. well. In the background he could hear the sounds of the shower running and pieces of Dean singing happily. Currently Dean was crooning about not needing reason or rhyme, which was probably sensible.
It sounded even more foolhardy, with a side plate of idiot.
“Fuck this. I’m done trying to help him.” he turned and vanished out toward the corridor, his injured hand still tenderly held that suggested a bone might well have been broken. Castiel eyed him for a moment, then looked back at Dean who seemed just about ready to collapse.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed in thought. “Not really, although I really don’t know how many of his memories he still has. He seems to have taken to the concept of the community well.”
“...mm-mm,” he acknowledged softly.
“Getting nude making me uncomfortable?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “S’like you don’t know me at all, Cas. Okay, okay, don’t give me that kicked puppy look, I was just joking with you. If you think it’ll make a difference, we could both remove our tops? Skin on skin, and we’d still have pants on to reassure your delicate sensibilities.”
Dean stared at him incredulously and then gave a short, loud laugh that had no relation to humour. “Man, Cas, you are making this
“What for?” Sam sounded perplexed.
“It’s Dean. He snapped some one liner, threw something and then stalked off to spend the rest of the evening in a drinking dive up the road.” Sam shrugged. “You know. Standard Winchester fare.”
Dean growled in his general direction. “Do you need to be here?”
“Dean,” Castiel spoke softly. “I am
“Dean,” he said softly. “It is alright. You are safe.”
“Is it
“O..kay,” Sam said slowly, who was clearly aware that a lack of straight ‘he’s okay’ normally meant something more complicated. “Does he remember anything?”
“Dean, I understand,”
“I was thinking of coming over, having a chat to people, see who knows who put in the system.” Sam said, a little too casual. Castiel understood this to mean that the younger Winchester was going to come fully armed with various witch or other supernatural entity killing items, which was also perfectly reasonable.
“Oh.” Castiel readjusted his mind to the new question, but there was little to hesitate over. “We are good, Dean. Very good.”
Now? Now Castiel filled this gap, but filled it in a way that Dean didn’t even understand. Cas wasn’t just a friend, but a confidant and a symbol, and if it had been anyone else then he’d really be searching his soul on what the hell he was doing. Hell, Cas was almost the little voice in his head made solid and there was always a void whenever he wasn’t around. Which was, quite frankly, pathetic when he thought of it like that. Couldn’t stop it, wasn’t sure he wanted to stop it, but still, pathetic.
“So we should be doing this naked?” Dean replied. Castiel had a sudden flash of severe and unpleasant panic. That would be taking it far too fast.
“A minor accident.” Cas’ voice was still distant, but he was slowly coming back to life and Dean smiled in relief. “I probably touched something I shouldn’t. Perhaps an electrical wire.”
“I don’t think the cat poo is going to make much difference, Cas.” Dean grinned, and gently gave the angel’s hand a squeeze, partly for reassurance and partly because there were several couples already watching them intently. And, sure, partly because he had an excuse to be able to, but who was counting?
“Will you stay for tonight?” Dean asked softly. “You know. Just in case the dreams come back again.”
“Sam has been clear that he wants us together in this place.” Castiel said finally. Which again was true, even if the circumstances had altered. The angel hesitated. “He just doesn’t want you hurt.”
“Ngh,” Dean squirmed again, a strange little noise that suggested he wasn’t sure what he wanted but he wanted it
“I turn around for an hour..,” Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers and then let them drop with a sigh as he reopened his eyes to look at him sadly. Dean, again, did nothing; his eyes were closed, his face peaceful. Castiel studied him for a moment, before gently brushing his fingertips across the line of Dean’s cheekbone to his jaw. Peaceful and surprisingly innocent, a boyish look of hope in his face.
“We’re working on turning them back.” Jody added, although she hoped that was a given. Claire eased the trench-coat slightly to see Dean better. Wary green eyes studied her back and squeezed Castiel harder.
“Not that I can tell, whether about last night or indeed about anything. He seems determined to pretend he is fine. He knows his first name, my name, and a little about the community, but his background and history appear to be lost.” Castiel hesitated. “And he seems a little ...confused.”
“We’re home.” Dean mumbled again, his head resting on Castiel’s chest and his eyes already closed. The angel could sense exactly when the man slipped into a light slumber, the way that his muscles relaxed even further and his head dropping against Castiel’s collarbone comfortably.
“Says the man who’s desperately trying to keep conscious! I knew you were probably going to kill yourself at some point, but hadn’t appreciated how badly you’d do it!” Sam’s voice was impressively fearsome. “It’s pathetic, Dean!”
“A day and a half ago he was, what, in his late 30s? Invisibility isn’t so wild,” Annie chuckled. “Do you want me to give it a go?”
Was this sensible? Almost certainly not. But then sensible was not what Dean Winchester specialised in.
There was a brief pause. “Backward?”
“Dean, I need you to be strong.”
“Awesome.” Dean grinned at him and tossed the damp towel his way which Castiel caught automatically. Following to pick it up, Dean pressed a light kiss to the angel’s cheek and purred softly. “S’okay, Cas. You’re not going to get sent to hell for doing naughty things in the middle of the day, I promise.”
“Cas, stop,” Dean finally moved, leaning back and his voice softer in what seemed to be understanding. “I know. I remember that bit as well.”
But Dean wasn’t looking at her. Dean was looking at Castiel with pure outrage. In such a small package it was definitely adorable, but also a little worrying. This was not how ‘nice rests’ started.
“He is.” Castiel didn’t bother to mention that lack of breathing normally classified as a definite  ‘not okay’. He walked back to the house, conscious of the two women trotting behind him like very tall dogs and both still trying to engage him in conversation. It was not their fault but Castiel felt he had bigger things to worry about, and the biggest was currently safe in his arms with his head resting against the angel’s chest.
a teddy bear; from what Bobby had said, John hadn’t really seemed the type for soft toys for kids he was trying to ‘toughen up’. Claire watched where his gaze went and calmly moved the cop car and the teddy next to him. She glanced back to baby no.2.
“You want to know the stupid thing? I was .. happy. No stress, no fears, everything just .. you know. Actually as they’re supposed to be. I had y-.,” Dean’s eyes flickered to Castiel for a moment, clearly debating on what the ending to that sentence, before looking away again. “... I had plans to become the community mechanic, car fixing, that sort of thing. No monsters under the bed. No troubles from heaven or hell. No freaky fuck ups, not that I could remember any of those. Just you, me, house and Sam popping in. How fucking stupid was I?”
“Jody. It is good to hear your voice.” the angel hesitated before asking the question she knew he was desperate to ask. “How are Dean and Sam?”
There might be cursing but at least Dean was asking permission for things, something that Castiel hadn’t realised would even be possible. He smiled again and gently ran his hand down Dean’s cheek with the lightest of touches, feeling him shiver against his hand and Dean’s eyes turn to a confused, boyish look. And to think he had assumed he would be the uncertain one in this situation.
“And you can’t do this in your orgies why, exactly?” Dean felt his throat going a little dry. The angel rolled his eyes.
He was definitely sure it wasn’t a good time, however etiquette apparently dictated uncertainty as ‘more polite’. Humans were odd.
“You can turn them back?”
“I’d prefer to chew off my own balls.”
“Cas… did I do something wrong before the accident?” Dean murmured finally, his hand falling away. “Cause you’re really fighting this.”
Okay. Perhaps not all was lost after all.
“Within a heartbeat.” Another truthful answer.
“Is it really going to be that extreme?” Dean complained.
“You’re welcome. You’re part of the Glen, now! We’re all family.”
“I don’t want you to go.” The agonised words were muffled by shirt and trench coat.
“... more of a jackass than normal?” Sam suggested. Cas looked faintly disapproving.
It was a lovely situation.
“C’mon. Let’s get in and get you unpacked. Remember, you only have a couple of suitcases at the moment, the other stuff will come in a few weeks time. I’m here to check whether the furniture will fit. Clear?”
“The leaders appear to be considering coming over here,” Castiel murmured, who had eyes in that direction.
“See?” Dean looked up at Sam triumphantly. “He’s fine. You want to go away now?”
Was that some sort of Angel thing, the mm? Dean looked from the angels to Sam and then back again incredulously. C’mon, what happened to
Dean turned to stare at him briefly, and again Castiel could see the lost little boy hidden in the previous irritation and fury.
“I mean it Cas,” he said gruffly. “I don’t want help.”
“Oh.”
“Probably better to watch the language until they’re taller,” she advised. “Not that the language should be colourful in here..,”
There was a ceiling in front of him when Dean opened his eyes. Ordinarily that wasn’t a problem; you lie on a bed, you open your eyes and bam, ceiling. Only this time Dean wasn’t sure whether he recognised the ceiling. Or, for that matter, the room he was in. He looked around further, and then paused.
No, was the answer. But still, the mystery man didn’t look like some murderer. Not that Dean really knew what a murderer looked like, and certainly not what a murderer looked like sleeping, but who knew, perhaps they slept cuddling their bloody axes as though they were teddy bears.
hard.”
Jody calmly took another sip of drink. Probably best to assume the house would look like a war zone within a few hours, even if it was just Dean on his own. The pair of them? A destructive force, she had no doubt.
-well.
“It sounds like a plan.”
Castiel looked at him politely until he flushed. “Are you not?”
point.” Dean eyed him. “You on a diet or something?”
win?” Jody murmured to Claire.
“Wait, he’s coming around again? I thought he’d been over here recently.” Dean gave Castiel a critical look, then made a soft pft noise. “That’s a bit weird, isn’t it? I mean, I’m all for close brotherly love, but there’s love and then there’s .. well, being a bit clingy. Ain’t natural, Cas.”
“Dean.” Cas’ familiar deep, rough voice and Dean almost came from that alone. “Roll over.”
“Yeah. Okay. Go.” he didn’t know where to, but he just knew that Castiel - because that was his full name, wasn’t it? Castiel? - would need to go, would need to do something. Blue eyes watched him for a little longer before Castiel made a soft noise and headed toward Sam.
They were breathless and flushed by the time they broke for air again, Dean growling in the back of his throat and Castiel allowing him his moment. After all, this was Dean Winchester, a man who ordinarily had to take control; Sam had often complained how his brother always believed that his opinion was the deciding one, and it was not difficult to see that this complaint had a valid basis.
“Fuck time,
“No, he’s pretty good at being an asshole, it’s just not normally this concentrated.” Sam shook his head and sipped the ridiculously strong coffee again. “I don’t think he’s sleeping.”
“Food based.” Castiel hastily added.
“Are you going to fix him or not?!” Dean snapped.
“Anyway, speak to you later. Take care with the ceremony. Might be small, but you never know what’s likely to come out of the woodwork.”
“I’m fine. Stop asking.”
He was agonisingly tight. Castiel could always feel so much of Dean regardless of where he was or what he was doing, but this amplified it to such a degree that it was difficult to tell where he stopped and Dean started. Every little shudder, every beat of the heart, every breath, it was all there and so much more, and Castiel forced himself calm with all the strength he possessed.
Rowena looked around expectantly. Silence. Jody was about to speak, when a blur to the edge of her vision blinked into effect and then silence again as a significantly larger body pressed against her.
“You missed the bit about no sex,” he said gloomily.
There was a weary sigh. “Not well. I found the first contact. He was amused but couldn’t really offer anything useful. I’m trying to locate the second one. I believe she should be able to remove it, but whether she has the inclination is another matter. The affliction appears to be some form of curse, which can be difficult to stop once triggered.”
“He means ‘fuck the hell out of him’,” Balthazar offered from the rear.
“Hallelujah,” the witch muttered under her breath and ignored them for a moment as they undressed and re-dressed in the largest t-shirts Jody could find. Dean lifted his hand and inspected the fabric that draped over him like a very odd toga.
Castiel fell silent. This was a situation he had not anticipated, and there was an automatic response in him to deny the legitimacy of Sam’s suggestion. Then again, there was another response in him too, one that was not displeased by the notion.
Dean huffed a soft laugh and pushed himself up, deftly stripping himself of remaining clothes as he stared back at Castiel in either curiosity or challenge or perhaps a bit of both. And the reveal was glorious, as Castiel had always believed it would be. Logically it shouldn’t have been, of course; the firm muscles, the golden skin, the sizeable erection, he had seen all of it before during his many years, not least during the stage of ancient greece and their penchant for naked, oiled wrestling, but the very essence of Dean turned good into a marvel. What that essence was he couldn’t say, whether the cocky if shy posture, or the argumentative but ultimately kind eyes, but it was there and Castiel could not have been happier. From the pleased smile on Dean’s face, this had been noted.
Dean made a soft sulky noise that suggested that this was debatable, before his hand palmed Castiel’s groin with a firm movement that was as glorious as it was sneaky. The angel groaned deep in his throat and lifted his hand to fix Dean with a stern look. A completely unconcerned, cheeky grin met him coming the other way.
“Perhaps we should get you to your bedroom,” the angel continued, and then frowned harder when the line of Dean’s mouth managed to find a new level of stubbornness to reach. “Despite the adverb, this was not a suggestion.”
“Don’t.”
“Fuzzy. But I do not feel any different.” Cas lifted his gaze to Sam and held it a little too long as far as Dean was concerned. Sam made a soft grunt of acknowledgement, and tightened his folded arms.
Cas frowned, head slightly tilted as he tried to understand this viewpoint. It made no sense. “Why?”
Sam digested that. “What was he doing?”
Sam’s eyebrows rose further. “Your marriage, huh?”
After many minutes Dean finally turned his head to look at him. The tiredness was still very clear in his eyes but it was bolstered by a harder, more curious stare.
Dean’s assessment of his damage level was clearly debatable. There was no question that Dean’s memories had returned, it was etched into his posture and the lines on his face. His eyes held a strange hauntedness to them that spoke of endless mental calculations occurring somewhere, and Castiel felt another twist in his gut deep inside himself.
“That is certainly one way to interpret it.” Castiel allowed. “Were you coming over today? I could do with your help. Our-,” Brief pause as he searched for an excuse. “-water is being a little difficult. Would you be able to fix it?”
And that was definitely the truth.
Castiel stepped forward again just in case the truce was a short lived affair, his gaze sliding to Sam briefly. “Sam, are you okay?”
Fuck, he knew he’d recognised that taste in decor. The look coming the other way was just as appalled, before the second angel shot Castiel a weary look.
Castiel thought about this. “So you’re
“I’m okay. Honest. I’m not going to pass out on you,” he murmured back. “And, who knows, perhaps my headache will go early enough for tonight’s bedroom activities to still be in play, yeah?”
Dean snapped back to him, and despite everything Cas seemed clearer somehow. He licked his lips and gave a shaky nod.
“I am here to see whether I can help you.” he said finally.
. And that would be really, really bad.”
“So what
There weren’t many words, but equally there was little to say. Dean had always had an expressive face whenever he allowed himself to show his thoughts, and it was an act of simplicity to watch the desire and the nervousness and the fierceness and the tenderness cross his features. Their gaze never left each other when the time came for Castiel to shed his pants and position himself against the bed to allow Dean to straddle him, and the look of relief and nervousness and pleading contained in Dean’s eyes as he slowly lowered himself onto Castiel was beauty itself.
“You’re going to wreck my buttons,” Castiel advised as he loosened his tie and pulled it off before making short work of unfastening the fastenings on his shirt. Dean stared at him a moment longer before laughing again and pushing himself up to his knees, eyes gleaming. It took no time at all for Dean to pull off his own clothing, tossing them to one side in a waterfall of fabric before he utilised his hunter prowess to pounce on the angel once again.
Helplessly he looked back up at Balthazar only to find another small, warm smile coming the other way. The angel’s hand gently played through his hair.
“I like a little rough,” Dean yawned sleepily.
“I … well, I don’t know. Could you come?
The angel had not anticipated this aversion to Sam, and Castiel pondered on its significance. That Dean would not be as close was a given, but it had been less than half a day and there were strong objections despite Dean not having seen his brother in this new headspace. Why? It was all very perplexing.
Still silent. Jody moved closer and dropped to a crouch near him, hand gently resting on Dean’s arm to attract his attention.
“I do ache.” Cas confirmed. “My head is .. fuzzy.”
“What you want and what you need are two different things,” Balthazar advised, and waved a finger in a more dramatic fashion. A glass of orange juice appeared close enough for Dean to take hold of it. “You need fuel. Drink. And once you’ve had that I suspect your body will demand something solid. Food wise, anyway.”
“Goddamnit, Cas, how can I fix it if I don’t even know what’s going on? Whatever it is, whatever it was, I forgive you. If you can forgive me for whatever it was too, then we’re okay, right?” Dean lifted his head and looked at him hopefully.
And it was almost certainly too late for that, but this at least was time for an appropriate confession. And, strangely, a small amount of irritation. It was not uncommon for Dean to treat him as though he was an adult shaped child, and although it was sweet on occasion it was also extremely frustrating. Truth be told, he was old and tired. He remembered times of old, different lands, diverse people, laws and rules and behaviours. Perhaps he did not understand things fully, not the ‘human’ way certainly, but that did not immediately relate to knowledge. And he knew what he wanted when it came to Dean. In many ways, it was one of the few clear things left in life.
Well, he felt a little ignored, and that, of course, could happily be rectified.
“Ritual.” Balthazar replied lazily from the corner. “No clothing allowed.”
worried. Your memories haven’t returned and .. well, there are some things that might alter your decisions.”
“Sam?”
Another thrust, harder, deeper, and Dean cried out weakly. Oh god, he couldn’t continue this, he had to come, and he reached down to stroke himself only to find Cas pausing to gently smack his hand away.
There was a very long silence from the man in front of him.
Opening the door revealed a bedraggled and clearly fatigued angel, mud smeared on his cheek and his clothing crumpled and faintly lopsided. A small child was curled up against his chest, thumb in mouth and clearly fast asleep, and another of the same age was holding onto Castiel’s hand with the other firmly gripped around a makeshift sword hastily crafted from a couple of sticks and some string.
Jody never did find out what the thing was before they had zoomed outside, still furiously shouting at each other. She sighed softly. Well, that was a habit they’d kept until adulthood; all they needed now was some dubious name-calling. Well, until the crash and then the scream.
“I hadn’t realised you were awake.” he said, a little gruffly. Dean squirmed again, burying himself closer to Castiel in what felt like a particularly intimate way. And this was a surprise. Perhaps the lack of sleep had affected him more than Castiel had imagined.
Sam’s face was unreadable. “Dean…,” there was a long pause then a sigh. “Yeah. Fine. This isn’t a check up-,” It clearly was but Castiel appreciated the reason for the lie. “ - this is for practical grounds. Doubt the community is going to want me around too much without someone in the group.”
Dean unrelaxed. He opened his mouth to speak and then slowly closed it again, before giving another little glance toward the door. Husband.
“I’ve just gone through the whole of the house-,”
“Would you like me to hold your hand?” Castiel queried solemnly. Dean blinked, and then glanced at him for a moment only to meet a very sincere expression coming the other way. Dean couldn’t resist the grin. It was kinda adorable.
“Cas?” Dean searched his eyes worriedly. His husband was still silent, his eyes open but slightly distant as though he was in some type of dreamland. A quick check suggested his breathing was regular and his heartbeat about as steady as Dean’s which probably meant it was vaguely normal. Dean tried snapping his fingers in front of Cas’ face which failed to produce any type of response, and then, gently, reluctantly, giving him a poke in the leg with his fingers. Still nothing.
dangerous! And it wasn’t as though he had any experience of emergencies or injuries or anything else.
This was close enough to torture that even demons could take notes, his body so stiff that it hurt. The kiss paused, Dean drawing back slightly to look at him worriedly.
“I would imagine a favour of some type. Perhaps a difficult to obtain spell component,” Castiel said after a moment’s pause. “Either way, our options are limited.”
Castiel was about to comment when his gaze caught sight of Dean’s boot.
them to be okay?” she looked toward the youngest Winchester for a moment and then back at them with tired eyes. “People always focus on the memories you lose, and never the memories you gain. You’ve just taken two boys who’ve never had a childhood as far as I understand, gave them nothing to worry about, people who cared about them, warmth, security, those slightly creepy soft toys, and a home, and then now? Poof! All gone. And worse?
Still, there were no blood stains. Nothing was making the hairs at the back of his neck stand on end either. No weird smell. No fucked up witch-like symbols. Just a .. well, glorified gazebo, a performance stand on stilts with opinions of grandeur. It even had little staircases with swirly decorations, the nearest one to him having a small sign hanging from it urging people to ‘please keep off’.
But Cas looked sweet and noble. Probably nothing. Better to apologise anyway, probably shoved his foot in it.
The matter was settled.
“No, it’s… oh, it’s fine, Cas, we’re both nit free, honest.” Sam sighed and looked back at his screen. “So they’ll probably take you there and introduce you to everyone. Probably the time to ask some questions and look .. well, you know.”
She always thought the knock on the door would happen in the evening, possibly at a dramatic time or the witching hour or something. In the end it occurred at twelve minutes past two in the afternoon, just after the boys had woken up from their naps and Jody had put on some calming music in the vague hope it might slow them down a bit.
Dean gently but firmly took hold of Castiel’s shirt and tugged him up to stand in front of him, so very, very close.
“I fucking doubt it.”
To quote the brothers, fuck.
Turning, he was mildly surprised to note that the man’s face was equally cautious, but then Dean was past caring. The occasional interruption he could deal with, but this was a whole lot of shit. If Sammy-kins was going to disapprove of same sex marriages he could damned well not walk in without warning.
“I swear.” Castiel was losing track of sins. Another few would make no difference to his tally. He lowered his voice, adding a little bit of softness. “Just get dressed, Dean.”
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice was gruff. “Mingling.”
A smile to indicate this was mostly a joke, but Castiel seemed to be thinking it over. Or at least until there was another little noise at the door and the still battered figure of Dean stared at them with the wide, glistening eyes of a small child who felt severely wronged. He was also dusty. The reason for that probably needed to be explored at a later time.
“Bad dreams.” Dean mused, a small, tired smile. “Fuck sake, man, how many monsters have we fought? We’ve stared into the depths of heaven and hell and various other shit places, we’ve died, we’ve been taken over, we’ve been the universe’s punching bag. If I was going to have bad dreams then my subconscious has really dropped the ball here.”
Where are you?”
“Did you fix it?” he asked.
“Yes.” The word was calm, simply and very much true. Castiel kissed him again lightly and smiled gently at the still flustered man. “I would be very okay with that.”
And now, of course, he was not.
Did he feel okay. Well, that was a complicated question. Dean winced slightly and rubbed the back of his head with a hand, slightly sheepishly.
“I had not realised that height was essential.”
Castiel did not know what the determined look meant, but it seemed important. He was just opening his mouth to query when Dean held up a hand to shush him, offering a small little smile before pushing himself up and heading toward the door.
“I see,” Castiel didn’t see at all, but it seemed foolish to pry any further for fear of untranslatable answers. “As long as you are happy.”
In many others it was insane.
Castiel looked at him politely, and was gladdened to see the flush rise on Dean’s cheeks again. Still, there was a determination in his eyes that firmly stated that ‘fuck that’ was his answer and he was sticking to it, and from the way his dick twitched as Castiel stroked him apparently his body was on a similar wavelength.
“Did you say you had some sort of ceremony tomorrow?” Sam said slowly. “In the woods? Where this is likely to have been taken?”
“Is Dean alright?”
A tired smile aimed back at him. “Good luck.”
Dean hesitated and then pulled a face. “Wait, what?”
“Dean.” That was Cas, and that was his warning voice. Dean bit back some of the curses he was planning to say and flashed Castiel a warning look. Okay, perhaps Balthazer might have the ability to do the spell but surely there was someone,
“Bite me.” Although Castiel suspected that the older Winchester was definitely in the mood to be the one with the teeth based on Dean’s current expression.
“I am aware. I’m just not sure what to do with it.” Castiel folded his arms. “He has firmly fixated on our marriage, in detriment to all others.”
“That’s my car,” Dean said suddenly, pointing toward the Impala. Jody hesitated, and cast a look toward Annie for a moment. Oh dear god.
“Dean believes it’s his job to investigate all locations first to check they’re safe,” the angel explained.
Bewildered eyes turned to her again, but these were the eyes she was familiar with. Jody all but sagged in relief. Thank god for that. He was caught up in a hug before he really knew what was happening, a small pause as Sam’s mind caught up with world events before he hugged her back again with the fierceness she had remembered when he was small. He was safe. Jody closed her eyes and allowed the tension to escape from her muscles. Safe.
