“No, it wasn’t stupid, Dean.” Sam is standing now, and before Dean knows it he’s being wrapped in his brother’s arms. “It wasn’t stupid. I’d be a hypocrite if I told you it was— I’m the one who ran away for a chance at normal.”
“Maybe you did,” Dean admits, then finally, finally says the end of that statement that he’s let stay inside his mind for years, only even thinking it at his angriest moments. “But maybe your best wasn’t good enough.”
“I don’t know,” Jack says slowly. “Because I used my powers? And I messed up the case? Your dad was mad at me, so…”
Jack’s in his room, sitting cross-legged on his bed and doing little else. Dean wonders if this means he was waiting for him, or is just one of those angel things.
Mom handles the coffees, already drinking her own, as Dean throws the bag of snacks in the backseat. He circles around to get into the driver’s seat, but mom pats the spot next to her from where she’s perched on Baby’s hood.
Since he’s already seen Dean’s favourite part of the bunker— the kitchen— Dean lets Sam beeline for his own favourite— the nerdiest possible favourite room to have, the goddamn library.
A memory Dean’s tried not to think about for a long time slithers to the surface, sudden and unbidden.
“I’m going to bed,” is what Dean ends up saying, walking off before Cas can keep gazing into his soul or whatever the fuck that
Dean is still wrapping his head around that statement, because getting Mom to stay in one place is near impossible— and, judging by what mom has said, even when she’d quit hunting to raise them she’d felt a need to get out and just go places— drives around town, long walks, hunts she knew she shouldn’t be on, and maybe dad doesn’t know about the last but Dean doubts she was hiding the first two, innocuous as they are, for years.
Lying to dad leaves a twisting feeling in Dean’s stomach. If he ever found out the truth of all this...well, Dean has experience with the consequences. He’d only managed to keep a few things from dad in his first round of life, long ago learning to be truthful about absolutely everything he could, because even if it was bad it was better than what he’d get for lying. Besides, dad had done so much for them, he didn’t [and doesn’t] deserve his kid being a rebellious bastard who isn’t even man enough to tell the truth. But, there
“Oh, I don’t know if I’d say that.” Sam is taking long strides, a slight smile on his face. He’s being a little shit, which means—
Castiel imagines Dean would kiss the way he does everything— throwing himself into it recklessly, with no regard for the consequences. But it would be full of passion, full of
He knows this, like he knows how to behead a vamp or salt and burn some bones, knows how to look after Sammy and knows how to clean and reassemble a gun, knows the adrenaline burst when he’s fearing for his life and knows cuts and scrapes and broken bones.
John regards them with a look of surprise when he spots them. They probably do look strange, all five of them sat on the surface of the map table rather than in the chairs around it, all watching him head down the stairs and towards them.
Dean pulls away from Cas’ mouth, breathing heavily like he does after a fight. His pupils are blown wide as he stares into Cas’ eyes, and though Cas can’t see himself in this fantasy he knows his are the same. Dean smiles, moving his lips to Cas’ neck, kissing a path down to where it meets his shoulder before nipping with his teeth and—
This is what he wanted. He’d spent most of his years since Sam learnt to talk wishing him and dad would just calm down and get along, hadn’t he? Well, it’s not like they’d
Now it’s time for the awkward questions, the ones that make people think maybe they should have taken a second look at those FBI badges after all, or maybe just that the FBI as an institution has gone a little insane.
“Jack?” Cas addresses the kid. “Maybe you should go to your room for a while. We’ll finish this later.”
He doesn’t know how mom takes his non-answer. He doesn’t know how she should. Still, she plows ahead, and Dean realises that maybe she needs to say it more than she needs to hear it. “When your dad showed up I realised I couldn’t keep ignoring it. If he was going to be around, I needed to know. So I stuck around, and I watched, and I tried to talk to you, and I tried to talk to him, but I could never be sure. But after last night...Well, let’s just say, he’s definitely not the man I thought I knew.”
This, of course, leads to a second debate of exactly how they do this. Two parents, their adult sons who look a lot closer to their age than should be possible, an angel of the lord, and a two year old nephilim who appears to be in his late teens, do not a regular family make [and if that sinks something in Dean’s chest, even though It’s something he knows, then he buries it before he can think too much more on it.]
“Look, I love my sister. I do. But Amy...she’s been a bit rebellious lately— normal sixteen year old stuff, sneaking out, lying, arguing with anyone who will listen. And, well, her and dad always had a...complicated relationship. Well, I was never dad’s biggest fan either, but I’m older, y’know? Had to handle that stuff. What I’m saying is, Amy hasn’t been home since before we got the news.”
So it’s the same thing, right? She just needs to process that dad’s back and talk to him, then their family will fall into place.
Still, sitting next to his father by that lake in companionable silence, dad smiling at him as he attempted to reel in whatever was nibbling at the end of the hook, it had felt so...homely— something that Dean already had barely felt except for brief memories of being four and occasionally three. It wasn’t dad’s fault the money ended up running thin. Dean should have stretched it further, not splurged on brand name chips the first day, or whatever.
“ Why do you always insist on handling things alone? You...you should have talked to us...trusted us…”
Jack has called them family before, but that was in the same way Dean called his friends ‘family’, right? He...and yeah, for all intent and purposes, the three of them
“Heck, I bet if I’d asked that day in the bunker, you would have slipped right down onto your knees. Desperate to help, to have a place to belong, to
“Oh, hey, you’re those FBI guys!” He says with a smile, like he’d just placed them. “How’s the investigation going?”
and oh fuck does that mean a myriad of things he is incapable of thinking about because that’s his dad and he just needs to stand here and listen.
He just hasn’t been trying. Picking up girls, being all James Dean and devil may care, it fell to the wayside, is all. Everything’s always about the next big threat, and when it isn’t, hitting bars suddenly wasn’t as important as spending time with the people he truly cares about. He guesses he could still pick up girls on the road. Plenty of cases have landed them in bars. But...something stops him. Every time.
“Always do,” he says, and if there’s tears in his eyes, John doesn’t mention it. Dean doesn’t mention the tears in his either. “Goodbye.”
It’s not really purposeful. Dean hadn’t really thought about working cases. Dad just got back, and he’s with his kids [the first time in years for them], and his wife [the first time in years for him]. Dean guesses he just hadn’t thought work would be the priority, after all, with Azazel gone and his family back together, shouldn’t dad just want to...settle? That’s what he always said— that they hunt until they take down the thing that killed mom, but there was never a whisper of what would happen after. He guesses he’d just presumed dad would be done.
Then they’re scrambling out of the car and breaking down the door of that cute little copy paste house.
There’s no scream though. No gush of blood. It takes Dean a second too long to realise that it’s because Jack has stopped the bullet mid-air, the glow of his power surrounding it, and he slowly lowers it to the ground.
They head out first thing in the morning. There are too many of them to all fit in the impala, so they split between Baby and Cas’ crappy car of the week.
Jack is the one to find them a case. He slides the laptop around to show the rest of the table with a wide grin that makes Dean smile back. Since he can’t use his powers on this hunt [or any future, but Dean is currently taking things one day at a time. Maybe one day, they’ll figure out a solution to this soul magic thing, and dad gets to know Jack, realize the kid means no harm and everything will be fine] it’s good that he has the research to remind him he’s still a part of the team.
In the morning, Dean volunteers to go pick up coffee and something that passes as breakfast for everyone while they do some last minute research with the little they know before hitting up the morgue. Mom offers to go with him, already heading out to the car before he can respond.
“What the hell are you wearing, Mary?” John shakes his head, having only taken one step towards her before grinding to a halt when she took a step back, posture rigid.
Dean jolts at the sound of Cas’ voice, and then promptly freezes. His mind goes blank on him, unable to process the fact that he’s currently being
Dad doesn’t have the same concerns. He watches mom too, but in a way that says ‘I can’t believe you’re really here’, rather than...whatever it is she’s doing.
. What was the next step, huh? Spend the rest of our lives looking over our shoulders? We should have found a solution
He finds Cas and Jack at the same time. They’re in the crow’s nest with a plate of cookies between them and a game of battleship on the go.
And on the sixth day, they do start talking. Admittedly, she only asks dad to pass her the ketchup. But they’re getting somewhere, he knows they are.
Cas nods, starting the story over. It’s a fairly gruesome one, that involves the cops telling Cas in detail about how they’d had to scrape viscera off the walls and gather what was left of Lydia into a body bag. From the tests the coroner had been able to conduct, there were no marks found and nothing strange in her system.
...everywhere. My first thought was ‘that can’t be my mom’, it was just...gunk. But then mom wasn’t anywhere, and dad was just kneeling there, and it hit me. I didn’t know what to do. I called an ambulance, but I couldn’t even explain what happened, it sounded...it sounded crazy. I mean, people don’t just explode, right?
. Let me—“ then he’d brush his thumb across Cas’ lower lip before leaning in those final few inches and kissing him.
A waiter comes by— he can’t be much older than twenty, by the looks of him. Curly brown hair falls over his forehead on one side, the one without the undercut. Dean notes the blue nail polish on his fingers where they hold on to his notepad and is glad dad is back at the motel room.
“What kind of smoothies?” Sam asks, suddenly looking like an excited labrador retriever offered bacon [which would be preferable, because bacon is actually
The town is small— the kind of small with one stoplight and nothing for teenagers to do for fun except underage drinking— so breakfast ends up being a Gas n’ Sip affair. He leaves with the following:
They pass dishes around, asking for and swapping various foods, a little chit chat here and there but mostly distracted by trying to stuff themselves with as much food as possible so nothing goes to waste.
“John,” mom says sharply. “They’ve got this, trust me. And...maybe we could get another chance to talk? If it’s just the two of us out there?”
His attempts at humanity were pitiful— he had been proud, at first, to land a job, to get a date with Nora. He thought maybe he was getting the hang of this. Then Dean had come back. Dean had made it clear his job wasn’t enough, and he’d seen the way the date with Nora had fell through. Because Castiel isn’t enough— not enough to be allowed to stay, not enough for his human body, not enough for Dean.
The problem is, if this witch is gonna target the Kane family, they have no idea when. They rolled into town a day after Lydia was announced dead, slept and interviewed the family, and then Simon died that evening, leaving a three day difference between the first and second kill, but one instance doesn’t make a pattern.
Dean watches his parents and brother research for a few moments, when suddenly John chuckles, turning to Sam.
that dad is getting revenge for her? Grow up Sam, go practice shooting with your brother, don’t be selfish.
a while back. The kid had spent hours learning sign language after, and got a goofy little smile on his face whenever she called.
Henrietta breathes out, some of the fight and defensiveness lifting from her. “I mean...there was blood, and flesh and...
“NO!” He hears Maria shout, and suddenly he’s being taken off guard and tackled to the floor. The back of his skull hits the corner of the coffee table,
“I did,” she says, he thinks he can hear a small smile in her voice, but it’s gone in a second. “What I didn’t know was the way you boys grew up after I was gone.”
“Stop it!” Dean finds himself standing between them before he even realised he was moving. “Dad...sir...Sam is a
overtook him, he’s grateful to find the real Dean still asleep. Castiel doesn’t want to imagine what would happen if he woke up, caught Castiel whining and needy and desperate for him.
The waitress drops their plates off and it’s a bit like turning on a rusty tap, but once he gets past the resistance the charm comes flowing out. He’s not even entirely sure what he’s saying, but she giggles and leans in before apologising and saying she’s got to go pick up another order, so he figures it was charming enough.
They ask questions about Simon: what he did that day, if he’d seemed strange lately, had any odd interests or mentioned anything surprising, but it all leads to nothing.
This is something Castiel had often thought about when his grace first invaded the vessel that belonged to Jimmy Novak. Castiel, in his true form, is as large as the Chrysler building— at least, he thinks that’s about right. The thing about an angel’s true form is that it is malleable, ever-shifting, more idea than solid matter. Whatever he really is, he had felt too big for Jimmy’s skin. He had been constantly straining against the confines of the human body, feeling trapped and compressed into a space he was not made to belong in.
They have inelegantly moved and packed themselves in the impala [inelegantly because Sam has to almost beg Dean to drop his gun as Cas shepherds Caleb into the backseat.] Sam had texted mom, and she’d sent back that they’re fine and currently drinking coffee and listening to Mrs. Kane talk about the latest plot twists on her soaps, and the house seems clear of hex bags but they’re gonna stay a bit longer to be sure. This gives them a little bit of time to get the information they need.
“John.” Mom’s voice is like ice, cold and unforgiving, a lot quieter than her husbands but no less dangerous. “Jack is a
“I may not be half the witch my sister’s become. But I do share a house with her, and she’s a goddamn slob—” this part is said with such a familiar, familial affection. “Leaves her spellbooks just lying on her bedroom floor. I found a spell...a spell to bind another witch's magic, and I’m pretty sure I can pull it off.”
John raises an eyebrow, looking over at Mary like he expects her to protest him needing a room of his own. She doesn’t, and he follows Sam down the hall with heavy footsteps.
gotten along before. Sam was always the one dad wanted protecting, always the one who got cut that little bit more slack, never the one scared away from speaking out, never the one sent away.
“I was at a friend's house. Me and another friend. We went over to hers straight after school. We hang out most days, either around town or around each others houses when we can. It’s a lot more fun than hanging around here. We didn’t do much really, hung out in her room, watched some bad reality tv, her brother made dinner and we ate and then I walked home.”
Amy doesn’t react to any of this, still in shock,  until Sam takes hold of her arms— once that switch is flicked she starts kicking, scratching and yelling. Dean still has a clear shot. The gun has somehow made its way into his hand.
“Well, the men of letters weren’t really hunters,” Dean says, because it’s the first thing that comes to mind to throw the conversation off its current track. “They were, uh, bookish types...left the ganking to whoever they trusted enough to pass their intel to.”
They’re sat around the map table— well, everyone except dad, who, after a few awkward moments, excused himself to head to the shooting range.
“You’re right, Sammy.” He tips his head back, trying to blink the tears away. “I...I wanted us to be a family. I thought...mom’s here. Dad’s here. Maybe...maybe we could finally have what we never got a chance to. It was stupid.”
He’s stopped short of bolting from his bedroom only by the fact he’s wearing his hot dog patterned pyjamas. Normally, he has no problem walking around the bunker in pyjamas and his dead guy robe. Today, he drags himself over to his closet and rifles through his clothes.
Castiel feels a heat, curling low in his stomach. He gasps a breath, the sudden feeling catching him by surprise. For a startling moment, he wonders if something is wrong, then he realises he’s hard, dick pressing up against the pants he’s sleeping in.
His father has always seemed to loom over him when he’s mad, suddenly so much bigger than Dean could over hope to be. The fury always surrounds his frame, unable to be contained inside. In the past few years, Dean had convinced himself that that’s just how it seemed when he was a scared child, before he’d gotten used to dad and learned how to handle his moods. But Dean sees now that, if anything, he’d been underestimating the past. The anger he’s faced with now is a brimming supernova, a catastrophe begging to be released and destroy anything in a ten mile radius.
“Nothing too exciting,” Caleb shrugs, looking into the fridge. “Was never much of a cook, but I’m trying now. I can do a strawberry and banana, mango, kale, minty pineapple if you’re feeling adventurous.” He embellishes that last one with a wink.
“You don’t.“ John states. “Though I do think the odds of being human are in my favour here.You can tell me I’ve been dragged out of time and landed in the future, but I ain’t never experienced time-travel. What I
Dad chuckles. He doesn’t look to see if mom and Sam react at all, because if they do he knows it will probably be with confusion [mom] and judgement [sam].
The victim’s name was Simon Miller, 42 years old. No known medical problems. He went out to walk the family dog and never came home— at some point, some jogger found a pool of human blood and brain matter on the sidewalk, pouring from the neck of a body still clutching the leash of a now incredibly stressed Schnauzer.
Dean doesn’t realise he’s sat down on the bed until he feels the weight of mom sitting next to him. He’s still looking at the journal, remembering how hard it was reading it for the first time, wondering if it would be better or worse for someone who hadn’t lived it.
“John took you fishing?” Mom speaks up for the first time since the conversation sounded. She sounds strangely uncertain too. Geez, is there something in the water supply today? “Was this a frequent thing?”
It often takes a while for Dean’s brain to switch from sleep to reality when he first wakes up. He’s already sitting up in bed when the events of yesterday hit him full force and he remembers
Cas and Jack have already arrived back at the motel when Sam and Dean walked in. They’re perched at the end of one bed, mom and dad asking them questions from the table.
After that, dad had dropped him back at the motel, Sam had come from whatever elementary school had taken them in that area, and dad had driven off again. Dean had soon realised that money would have been better saved for groceries— at least half his meals went to Sam for the rest of the week.
Cas leans a little closer, a twinkle in his eye, and says his next words like a secret confession. “Hit.”
The Miller home has been xeroxed from the Williamson home. A different coloured trim, begonias instead of tulips, but fundamentally a copy and paste.
Eric takes off his glasses and wipes one of the lenses with the corner of his sweater. “Well, I’ll try my best.” He attempts a smile.
“Right now, we’re focusing on the case,” Dean says, because he refuses to try and think past that, other than a vague
They head back to the motel and then Cas and Jack head out again, only stopping long enough to change into their monkey suits.
Mom’s response takes a little longer. “I have been itching for a hunt. Didn’t seem right to go off on my own what with...well…”
He wants to ask why, but both him and Cas know why Cas has a problem with the plan, and Dean is too tired to play dumb.
They’ve been chipping their way through textbooks, or in Dean’s case, staring at the same page without taking any of it. It can’t be more than an hour from when they started—  long enough for Cas and Jack to get back, but not long enough for Dean to start getting antsy from sitting still with a boring ass book— so logic dictates they have many more hours of the research crawl, and dad should be all over that, not pulling Dean away.
He hands Sam a beer, taking the seat across from him at the little table. He’s pretty sure Sam isn’t done with whatever he’s trying to say. Sure enough, the silence lasts maybe half a minute.
“She wasn’t a monster!” Sam shoots back. Suddenly, Dean sees an eighteen year old spitfire in place of his fully grown brother, years younger and never afraid to stand up to dad. Even with the years that have passed, Sam holds himself the same as he stands up for what he believes in. “She was a
“We’re hunters,” Sam starts to explain. “We look for...bad things, unnatural things..things that are hurting people, and we stop them.”
’ echo in Dean’s head. He realises, with little fanfare, that he’s been waiting for this inevitable moment since the moment he first saw his dad in the bunker.
Their lives are a lot to unpack and lay out in a cohesive narrative, and saying it aloud makes Dean realise just how absolutely insane things have been. He’s half-surprised dad doesn’t accuse him of lying, especially when he says things like ‘monsters manipulating the fast food industry’ and ‘lucifer possessing the president’ and ‘god’s sister’, but he listens quietly, only asking follow-up questions here and there.
Mom’s head shoots up from behind the screen of the laptop she’s using. She directs a glare in Dad’s direction, and Dean wonders what dad is hoping to achieve by telling Mary Winchester to do anything she doesn’t want to— Surely he must know that never works out.
, you were never like him, not in any way that matters. You were just dealing with the shit dad put you through your way, and looking out for me while I dealt with it my way and blamed you when I should have been...grateful to you.”
He doesn’t know if he managed to hold back the scream as he came— it was so much, the rolling pleasure coursing through his being, leaving him sweaty and out of it. For a moment, it’s one of the best things he’s ever felt. Then he starts to come down from the high, and the guilt of what he’s just done and the thoughts that fuelled it hit him full force.
He just...he didn’t know if dad would get it. At the time, it seemed easier. So, of course, now it’s coming back to bite him.
John chuckles. “Probably dumped you when she realised you have the same diet as a teenage girl, huh?”
Dean feels like a bucket of ice water has just been dunked over him, freezing his insides and washing away something precious.
“I practice wicca, that’s all,” the kid admits. “Little things, herbs for protection, a spell or two on the new moon. I just...wanted to show her something that could
The second the figure reaches the same path mom and dad had walked up earlier, the three of them jump out the car.
“I had to do something,” Amy says, finally looking at her friend. “We couldn’t just keep living like this! I couldn’t take it anymore!”
“Wanna hear what I realised? I realised...there’s probably no such thing as normal, not in the real world. All we can really hope for is what makes us happy, even if it’s the farthest thing from normal there is, as long as we’re happy, and the people we care about are happy? I’d take that over normal any day.”
Sam frowns at him. These days, they only ever go out for food when they’re on the road. If they’re home, then Dean cooks for them all, shuffling everyone else out the kitchen if they even try to interfere with whatever new recipe he’s trying out that day.
Dean can see there’s still an unsure line to his father’s shoulders, and he braces himself for an inquisition. Maybe dad doesn’t actually want to know, though, because he just nods, claps Dean on the back with a fist, and says “No more wasting time, that witch isn’t gonna kill itself.”
too but I can’t bring myself to feel anything but relief that the people who were hurting you and Henrietta are gone now. But...look what you doing all this alone has led us to. You killed them, and now there are people in my home threatening to kill
Dean goes over the little he and Sam have uncovered, when he’s finished Sam quickly says they should all hit the books and do more research, leaving no one any time to comment.
But he saw that manic look in his eye, the itch under his skin, and slid a case under his grateful nose.
Dean freezes. Well, there’s a moral quandary Dean currently isn’t capable of approaching with a ten foot pole.
Bile is rising in his throat again. His vision blurs around him. Things he doesn’t want to think about, buried away hours days years before, flood to the surface of his mind, mingling with Amy and Maria’s words to create a cacophony.
“Wish I knew.” Caleb breathes. “Pretty sure she timed them for when I was out at work. All I know is they were a new level of messy.”
It’s enough for dad to barrel ahead. “I...I always worried about him. What had been done to him, what that made him, what he could become. Tell me, and tell me
Dean winces internally. Apparently, Jack has forgiven him, but he hasn’t forgotten. He knows he’s a large part of the reason Jack sometimes feels unwelcome, unsure of his place in the family.
“But it isn’t just this one case, Dean. What about the next case? And the next? Or our everyday lives at the bunker?”
He’d stopped voicing them aloud, because when he had Sam would remind him that dad’s not here and Dean never knew how to tell him that even though that was true it didn’t matter.
Cas takes a step back, regards Dean for a moment, and says, in the same tone he uses whenever Dean has done something that annoys him down to the bone. “Actually, I think I’ll stay right here.”
“We can...tie her up, get the hex bag off her and burn it,” Sam says suddenly. “Just...for now, yeah? That’s okay, right, Caleb?”
“Hey,” Dean cuts in quickly. “Look, dad was mad at me all the time growing up. Me and Sammy. That’s just...who he is. It doesn’t mean you did anything wrong, okay? Not really. I mean, maybe you didn’t do what he would’ve wanted you to. But, that doesn’t make it wrong, not necessarily.”
“Are you sure?” Cas asks, but he finally seems to be relenting a little bit. “Have you been checking?”
Fuck. The kid looks nervous— strung out and unsure. It’s not like Dean can blame him, either. His track record is pretty dismal. Sure, there’s been good times, but they don’t make up for the bad, not to him.
. Would you do that, would you suck me off on your knees? Hmm, an angel being the one on his knees, grateful to be there, to worship my cock. Could be kinda hot...entertaining, anyway.”
Sam had pulled him into the hall to talk once they’d explained to dad about the pearl and the time travel and got him seated in the kitchen. There’s still so much they need to catch him up on.
“Amy is at band practice. Or, at least, she told me she’s at band practice. Katie is in her crib, by virtue of being an infant,” he says easily “You guys want a drink? We’ve got tea, coffee, and I picked up some stuff to make smoothies?”
harsh on him yet, so he’s got the looks, and flirting is a skill he mastered around the same time he mastered how to hustle pool, so he’s got the moves too.
“Miss. Dean, I understand that it means a lot to you to have your father around. I would never begrudge you that, even if me and John Winchester clearly don’t get along. But I can’t raise Jack in this environment. C8.”
Dean kind of wishes he was on team morgue— he has the itch to be working, that disquieting shift under his skin that tells him to get up and do his job [which, now he thinks about it, he’s been feeling a lot less lately...he really is going soft, huh.
Dean...Dean can’t count how many times he’s wanted Cas to say those words, to tell him he’s going to
“How do we know it’s really you?” Sam counters with a raised eyebrow, even though there’s little doubt left. Even though hunters instincts should tell them otherwise, it just
The words are automatic, something coming out without much forethought to comfort the boy in front of him, but as he says them he feels one of those little boxes burst open, memories and thoughts he’d tried not to think about springing into the light.
Dad is silent for a moment. “Well, I gotta say, I have been curious to see that ‘angel mojo’ of Castiel’s.”
“Well, it seems like we just keep running into each other, huh?” Dean says, faux-casual in the way that makes it clear this is an accusation.
But at the same time, it’s not quite the same. Sammy is still in the room, not ushered away like he always tried to do when it got this bad, Jack is trembling next to Cas, tired from dragging them all back home, Cas regards John carefully, and Mom...the dark look in her eyes isn’t something he thinks he’s ever seen on her face before, not even during the worst they’ve been through the past couple of years.
“This is between you and your family?” Cas looks dad squarely in the face, sliding into his personal space. His voice reminds Dean of a moment long ago,
“Going to visit a friend, is all, I swear.” The kid’s good, but Dean is better. He sees how the answer took a bit too long to be natural, how the eye contact he’s making is deliberate, the oldest trick in the book for people trying not to get caught in a lie.
“It was, by all accounts, a regular day. We all woke up at six a.m and had breakfast. I went off to work, Henrietta— our daughter— left for school. Lydia told me she was going to spend the morning in the garden, then have lunch with some of her friends, before doing the weekly grocery shop. She wasn’t in when I came home, but she did come back half an hour later with grocery bags, gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me we were having pot roast for dinner. I was helping her put some things in the freezer...and then...well...she just—”
Dad turns to him with a sharp glance. Dean feels an anxiety he’d forgotten start to pound in his chest. Can they really not get through a few minutes without a fight? Thankfully, when dad’s face breaks, he looks almost proud.
“Uhhh…” Dean blushes, quickly scanning where his little plastic boats are. “Miss. So, why didn’t you want Jack here?”
He wipes the fresh tears from his cheeks, puts himself away, and curls up into a ball, purposefully facing away from Dean.
“And—“ Sam continues. “They have a third best friend, Maria. The one who Caleb said Amy had stayed with that night.” Sam stops on a new picture, one of Henrietta and Amy and a new girl, black hair in a short pixie cut, button nose under brown eyes, swimming in a gaudy coloured sweater. The picture is of the three of them sat on the floor, snacks surrounding them, laughing at a joke the viewer will never be in on. The caption reads ‘best friends forever’ with a string of heart emojis.
He shouldn’t, he knows. He knows that’s not the kind of thing you do, touch yourself to the thought of the best friend as he sleeps across from you, unaware of what you’re doing. Dean would probably be disgusted, if he knew, because he’d made it clear he didn’t want Castiel in the bunker, so he definitely wouldn’t want
Mom is wearing jeans and a tank top with a flannel thrown over the top, Dean thinks stupidly, still trying to work out this turn of events. It’s the same kind of thing she always wears...then he remembers it’s not. The mom in his memories wore pale sundresses and white nightgowns and had hair that flowed down her back. That’s the woman dad knew. Without even realising, Dean had at some point replaced that image of his mother with the one in front of him.
“Well, obviously.” Dean crosses his arms. “Mom’s here too. And Cas and Jack. Not to mention your hairline is a good couple of inches further back since those days and my knee can tell when it’s gonna rain now.”
He stops for another cup of coffee between his talk with Cas and the next part of his not-quite-a-plan. It kind of feels like a waste of time, but he also needs a breather, even if he has to keep one eye on the front door as he does it. Everything he keeps locked in boxes at the back of his mind is pushing against the lids, fighting its way out, wanting to fit into place with his current thoughts. He knows where this is going, he’s pretty sure, even as he holds out the picture is already starting to form, it’s just not whole yet, a couple of parts still missing.
“I’ll just...skip to after. I didn’t know what to do. I just sat there kneeling in front of the open freezer, I don’t know for how long. The paramedics said I was in shock, after they came for the...after they came for Lydia. Our daughter was the one who called the ambulance. She was out with a friend, when it happened, but when she came home she saw. God, I can’t imagine how horrible that must have been for her, but she managed to handle it better than I did. She always was a brave girl.”
He knows that voice, wherever it’s coming from. Who does it belong to again? He finds that doesn’t really matter right now— the voice feels safe, like a blanket wrapping around him, like
“Of course it is.” He coaches his body into something normal, casual. Doesn’t lean in. Doesn’t stare into Cas’ eyes. “It’s a great idea. Kill some evil sons of bitches, drink a few warm brewskies in crappy motel rooms, bond.”
He’d skimmed over a lot of the demon blood stuff in his little catch-up course that first night. Only what was needed— they found yellow eyes, dad died, and later they’d put him down. He never mentioned that they found out Azazel had bled into Sam’s mouth as a baby, or the visions, and especially not what happened with Ruby.
“I’ll leave you two to handle this,” he points between Sam and Cas and walks away before they can argue.
Dean thinks of the things Caleb has divulged about his and his sisters’ upbringing and even without the details he knows that their father wasn't winning any number one dad awards, recognises it easier than he recognises himself in the mirror sometimes. They’d never gone down this road in their brief interview with Henrietta and her father, but he still bets that yeah, it's probably three for three.
There’s a lot of talking— Sam almost draws up diagrams—  but in the end it’s clear (at least to Dean, and John) who could fit in easiest around here— mom, dad, and their kid Jack.
Castiel is doing roughly what Dean expected him to be doing, which is what he does whenever he sticks around for dinner, which is sit there with an open beer, a few small things on his plate that he may or may not pick at as the evening goes on, but still
Cas, and though he can now admit it wasn’t really Jack’s fault, and he was in fact the only reason they got him back, at the time that had clouded any kind of relationship they could have. Now...Jack is great, despite his mistakes. He’s a sweet kid. He’s Cas’ kid, and that’s probably why Dean doesn’t consider him a friend but more like...well, son is a strong word, but…
Amy doesn’t look like she knows what to say to that. She sits there, staring into Maria’s eyes as she catches her breath. There’s pain on her face, layers deep, and Maria is begging Amy to see what she’s trying to say with nothing but the look in her eyes.
A few minutes later, the three of them sit with bleeding arms and holy water dripping from their faces. John smiles.
“Do you wanna know what I’d do, Angel?” Dean is straddling him now, rubbing his clothed cock against Castiel’s own as he whispers. “First, I’d just look, I’d watch you writhe, all wide-eyed. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Me watching? Bet you’d put on a show, desperate to please me, desperate for me to want you back.”
“What Dean means to say is that we found a hex bag at the Miller house.” Sam rolls his eyes. “So, logical conclusion, we’re after a witch.”
“Dean, you realise this could have undesirable consequences? Messing with time it’s...it can be catastrophic.”
Even if they’re both doing this the same way one would walk to the gallows, it looks like they’re doing it.
“Well, it’s gotta be someone with connections to both the Millers and the Williamsons. Neither family mentioned any real enemies when we asked, so no leads there. I’ll look online and see what I can find,” Sam says.
Seven hours drive later, two cars pull into the empty Nightspring Motel parking lot. They split between four rooms— Sam and Dean together, Cas and Jack together, mom and dad both in singles.
Dean fights down the automatic ‘dad was doing his best’ that tries to leave his throat. That’s not what this is about.
Dean debates whether or not to say this next part, but in the end he has to, Cas’ words still echoing in his head. “Jack...are you happy here? In the bunker, I mean. With us.”
Dean was never hoping for some great speech, for apologies or his blessing for the men they’ve become and the lives they lead. In truth, he was expecting another fight. He supposes this is the best he could ever hope for, from John Winchester.
Dad’s face softens, just for a moment, and though he still doesn’t look happy, he lets mom lead him away with one last sharp glance back at his sons. It says ‘
Time passes in the form of words swallowed and truths unfaced. It passes in the way it doesn’t pass, because a watched pot never boils except it does, and when you’re not really watching it all boils over. If you put a frog in a boiling pot, it will jump out, but if you put a frog in tepid water and boil it, the frog will not realise that it’s dying. If you live a life in a constant state of building, bubbling, boiling, how can  you get out? That’s just life.
The coffee is, in fact, cold. No one complains. Cas even smiles when Dean tosses him the bag of sour gummy worms [still taste like molecules, but he likes the texture, whatever that means].
“You had to kill three people?” Dean asks harshly, because there’s too much going on and he can’t take it anymore. “Turn to fucking witchcraft? Was there no point where you thought, ‘hey, this is pretty fucked up, maybe I should get off this crazy train before I’m a monster someone has to come put down?’”
what your father is like. Are you forgetting that I have been a friend to you and Sam for ten years now? Or that I rebuilt you? Held your soul in my hands?”
She doesn’t so much stop struggling as she does start struggling slower— Sam could still easily get the drapes around her wrists like this, but he seems to be waiting it out to see if she’ll go quietly.
“This has nothing to do with you,” John hisses, pointing at Cas. “I don’t know who you are, or what you’ve done to my boys, but they’re
than other people, but he’d never strayed from the path on purpose. The line of ‘good vs evil’ had been a bit more black and white in Dean’s mind then: Non-human equalled evil, easy as that. Now there’s Garth and Bess, Benny, Rowena, Mia, Lenore and her nest— the
But the fight had happened, and Dean tests the water with how dad is gonna feel about Sam, Dean, and Bobby’s continued...alliance? Friendship?
Maria’s expression is a goddamn Jackson Pollock painting of emotion as she looks at Amy— hurt, confusion, anger, all splattering into each other.  Amy doesn’t return her gaze, eyes fixed on the floor.
Cas is still standing there, still bridling with righteous anger. Really, it shouldn’t be a surprise he’d shoot to kill— he always knows what to say in an argument, how to get down to someone's core and tear them to shreds. Still, everything grinds to a halt when he says his next words, casual and vindictive all at once: “Of course you were perfect for each other. But that’s only because Heaven needed it to be so. When you met, Mary Campbell couldn’t stand you, and it would have stayed that way if not for a literal, biblical miracle.”
“So...if those things are good, we should try and keep them, right? And...accept, that things are different than they used to be, and maybe shouldn’t be that way again.”
John’s smile turns wry. “You’re back hunting, Sammy? I thought you were happy playing pretend in your little Stanford fantasy.”
Though he shouldn’t, awake alone in the dark, he lets himself imagine what it would have been like if Dean had meant what Castiel wishes he had meant. If, instead of asking Castiel to unbutton his own shirt, he’d leaned over and done it himself. He wouldn’t have stopped at a few, he would have trailed his fingers down Castiel’s torso until the shirt was completely undone then shucked it off his shoulders. Then, his fingers would be back, trailing over bare skin this time. Dean would have leaned across the space between their seats, between
Dad finally looks up at that. “What would you wanna do that for? You always were the staying in type.”
He’s not sure he has a body right now, but he recognises the feeling of hands cupping his face anyway. From that touch, a physical and familiar warmth seems to spread, bright and burrowing right down to his bones. For a moment, he floats in it, then he’s unrelentingly jarred back into awareness.
Dean relaxes a fraction. Mom explained it well, giving context without letting some of the more...unsatisfactory details of the whole situation slip. They’d all mostly stopped worrying about the conditions of Jack’s birth, but it would probably make dad reach for his gun again.
Dean blinks, finally turning to face her. Not that it really matters, because she’s purposefully not looking at him either. “That BMOL chick?”
This is, of course, when his dad bursts back into the house. His eyes stop on Dean and Cas first, his expression already twisting into an expression Dean knows all too well. Next, his gaze lands on Sam and Jack, supporting a tired witch and bustling her out of the almost crime scene, very much alive.
There had been a long string of cases, even after dad had died, where a lack of results or an injury or one too many bodies made Dean think about how pissed dad would have been if he was there to see it. At some point— Dean doesn’t know when, doesn’t think he even realised they had— those thoughts had started to phase out, only coming for the really big screw-ups.
The split is never questioned, at least not out loud— Winchesters in the Impala, Cas and Jack in the other car.
“You were never meant to be here,” Cas says, speaking up from where he sits on Dean’s left. “No one is turning their back on you. They are simply...putting things back where they should be.”
“No,” Jack tells him. “Once the Baozhu is broken, you’ll return to your own time. Maybe you’ll think this was all a strange dream, but you won’t remember, not really.”
Lydia and Eric Williamson married young, straight out of college. He went into teaching, she published cookbooks, popped out a kid, then it was sixteen years of driving to soccer practice and PTA meetings until three days ago, when—
“This is great! Now he can take you fishing again! Oh,” the kid turns shy suddenly. “Maybe...we could go together? Like, you and your dad, and me and…”
They argue a bit [a lot] about how to best approach it. Dean thinks they should stick with the FBI route— it’s tried and trusted. Sam points out that already nearly got them caught with Caleb, goddamn stupid small towns. Dad just wants to stake out the place, not get involved, and Dean remembers with a start just how different hunts with dad were to the system he’s fallen into with Sam. A lot of alternative forms of identity fraud are thrown around— insurance, journalism, priests. Eventually, mom’s the one who hits the jackpot, suggesting they simply pretend to be new neighbors getting to know the area.
“Come on, let's get you three out of here. We’ll take you to Henrietta’s, she probably should hear about all this too” he says, helping Amy back to her feet.
Seeing Amy in person, she’s...small. Kind of a shrimpy kid for her age, actually. But she’s using everything she can to make herself seem bigger than she is— the too big denim jacket, the squared shoulders, the snarl marring a face that still has a few last traces of baby fat.
He doesn’t argue. Sam seems to have really found himself with this whole leadership thing that started with the people they’d brought over from the Apocalypse World. He’s good at it, and it’s good for him.
“Hey, Amy?” Maria is walking over to her friend, taking small slow steps as if approaching a skittish animal. “I...really don’t know what's going on right now. So I want to talk to you too. I’m...this is
at her. Dean has never imagined his parents mad at each other if they’d somehow managed to find eachother again.
They hadn’t gotten past the flirting phase before she died, but it was clear it hit Sam deep, even if they’d never talked about it.
“If I may interrupt,” Cas says, taking a step forward. “Last I checked, John Winchester’s soul was in heaven. How, exactly, did he come to be here?”
He shuffles out of his room in the late hours of the morning, when he’s sure dad still hasn’t come back from his bender and there’s no one else pottering around in the kitchen. He taps his fingers on the counter as he waits for the coffee to finish, then pours two mugs and heads back the way he came, stopping a few bedrooms away from his own.
“A lot of it isn’t my story to tell.” He shakes his head. “Amy...she’s troubled, like I said. But she’s a good kid, at heart.”
“So, John is your father? The same one you’ve told me about? Who’s dead? But now he’s here, because of time travel?” Jack asks.
Cas takes a deep breath, staring into Dean’s eyes. That’s right. He wants to die like this, he wants Dean to be the last thing he sees, tastes, hears, touches.
“That’s it.” Dean grunts, pulling his weapon. Unbidden, his eyes flicker back to the house, even though he knows his dad is inside and not watching.
“I’m gonna hit the hay,” Dean says, knocking back the rest of the bottle and collapsing on his bed face down.
way, but Jack is— he came into their lives, into Dean’s mind, as the offspring of one of the greatest evils they’d ever faced. He
“Jesus, Dean. Do you really think that that’s still what this is about?” And yep, that’s Sammy’s pissed voice, bitchface and all.
“I—” Maria starts. “I don’t like what she did. Amy, you...shouldn’t have...why did you think it had to come to this?”
Jack nods, ducking behind his glass of orange juice [Cas has limited the kid’s alcohol consumption to special occasions, because ‘he’s two’ and ‘he may be a Winchester, but he doesn’t need all the Winchester habits’.]
As they step outside the motel room and onto the balcony, Dean can’t help but wonder if he’s in trouble— which, objectively, is a very embarrassing thought for a forty year old man who just a few weeks ago shoved a machete through a vamp’s throat and let the hot blood splatter over him, and has done so more times than he can count, to think. But he’s not thinking objectively right now. Really, he’s barely thinking at all, beyond wisps of thoughts that slip away. He is standing on a motel balcony with his long-dead father, and when it’s just them he forgets about all the ways his life has changed since then, and how he’s trying so hard to make all these things fit and why won’t they
Dean does everything in his power to hide the fear bubbling in his throat. Dad clocks the gun in Dean’s hand and nods, apparently sated a little, but he still doesn’t look like he wants to leave any time soon. In 2003, he was already trusting Dean to go on solo hunts, but clearly Dean has done something to deserve having his reigns put back on. The choking feeling of failure, of
He knocks on the door in a very un-winchesterly manner— which is to say, he doesn’t hammer his fist on the door then break it down before getting an answer. Instead he stands there, rethinking this entire plan as he waits for the door to open.
He kind of, may have, skipped over Cas and Jack when he caught dad up on the past few years. He mentioned an angel raised him from hell, and he talked around Lucifer siring a kid, but he definitely didn’t mention that the angel and the kid...lived with them.
Dean watches all this, not really processing, still distracted by Cas’ touch. It’s been so long, too long]. There’s thoughts, the remnants of his earlier not-breakdown, still swirling in his mind, but right now everything is a little hazy and closed off still. He has no choice but to sit there, trusting his family to do what’s right, even if part of him is fighting to get up and take control, to find his gun again and do what he feels he has to.
They read and make notes and don’t talk much until the clock starts ticking down into the evening and Sam’s stomach grumbles over the silence. Dean is immediately on his feet. “Let’s go see if this town has a decent diner after all.”
So, he’s surprised when he doesn’t find Sam immediately when he finally gives in. He checks the library, and the kitchen, and a bunch of storerooms brimming with probably cursed artifacts. No sign of his giant baby brother.
“Tell you what though, I wouldn’t. I never would.” Dean wiggles enough so that he can unbutton Cas’ jeans, slipping his cock out and wrapping his hands around it, a more exciting imitation of reality. “If you tried hard enough, maybe I’d decide to use you though. That’s what you want, right Cas, to be useful?”
He thinks it’s fair. If he’s going to get pleasure, from the thought of Dean, the least he can do is hurt while he does it.
“Mom,” Sam starts. “Could you...take dad and go check on Maria’s family? Make sure they get a motel for the night and aren’t losing their minds? We can handle things here.”
Opening his eyes, the first thing he sees is Cas kneeling in front of him, hands still cradling his jaw and fingers brushing across his cheeks. He sees unrelenting concern in those ancient, blue eyes, and he’s captured in it, rapturing and realising.
“You’re never gonna be enough, Cas. You’re not an angel anymore, and you certainly aren’t a human. You’re just...there. Always either too big or too small, never just right. The angels hate you, I don’t want you. It’s better if you aren’t around at all. Don’t you think?”
Mary huffs a laugh. “Surprised you were in the game as long as you were and never heard of the Campbells. I was born and raised a hunter. Got out of the life not long after we met, though...well, more or less. But after I came back...you were gone, and the kids were all grown up and hunters themselves...what else was I supposed to do?”
“You’re planning on killing a sixteen year old girl? That’s how you ‘save people’? Seriously?” Caleb spits.
Caleb waves a dismissive hand. “She’s texted me a few times, and we talked on the phone when I called her to break the news. She stayed with her friend Maria last night, I even made her let me talk to Maria to be sure. She’s safe, I made sure of that. She’s just...processing.”
“We answered your question, Caleb. Would you be okay with answering ours now?” Cas is using that voice he uses with Jack and Claire sometimes, that reasonable ‘I’m your dad and I’m responsible and I care about you’ voice. He used to be blunt to the point of detriment on cases, but having two kids around Caleb’s age (in a sense) is clearly refining his approach. Dean isn’t sure if that’s a good thing— It’s unusual, at least. It’s not...the hunter way of doing things.
Finally, he heads into the main area of the bunker. He’s still half-expecting not to see dad there— Dean will walk in, and dad will be dead like he has been for years, and mom and Sam won’t even know about the dream, like they don’t know about all the others. But as soon as he looks across the war room, he can see the figure of his father running a hand across the map table as Sam watches on.
Shocked, Dean starts laughing. He laughs way more than he should, for something that objectively isn’t funny, but each gulp of air he takes as he does so feels fresh and free. It can’t be that weird, because suddenly, everyone is giggling with him.
“Her name is Maria. Maria Kane. I’m thinking, if Henrietta and Amy’s link is what got their families targeted, then—“
He pats her on the shoulder, and turns to leave. Before he does, he takes a last look around the undecorated room. It would’ve hurt, once. Hell, it probably would’ve hurt yesterday. But...that’s who his mom is, that’s who they are, and the fact that she’s here at all, the fact he can get to know the real her...it’s good.
“I get it, Dean,” Jack cuts him off. “No mention of my powers around your dad. Because he’ll think I’m evil.”
After the library they hit up a few more rooms, some of which were indeed borderline undiscovered— they have a gym? since when?— before eventually settling back into the library and letting dad properly go through some of the books.
Turning back to the table, the look Sam shoots him over his greek yoghurt and granola is absolutely withering, mixed with something else Dean doesn’t want to put a name to but looks uncomfortably akin to pity. Mom, at least, seems intensely interested in stirring her coffee. Dad claps him on the shoulder, and that’s what matters.
“Besides,” Dad adds. “We need to talk, Mary. Just me and you. We haven’t really had the chance yet.”
He flounders. How is he meant to answer that? Why is it being asked? Is there a right and wrong answer?
“Still leaving a string of bastards across the country, huh? Thought you might have settled down by now, but I guess that’s hard when you’re still in the life. What about you, Sam, you got a girl?”
Dad’s face lights up when he sees Baby again, praising that Dean has kept her going all these years, and that allows some of the tension to leak from his shoulders as he makes the drive into town.
Dean’s good mood sticks around when they reach the bunker, even after mom disappears back to her room without a word the second they get through the door.
No cold spots. No smell of sulfur. No enemies, except maybe Grace Hollowitz who has held a petty grudge ever since Lydia called her out for bringing store bought muffins to the PTA bake sale.
She nods. “Sam gave it to me. It was not long after I came back, said it would help me to catch up with everything I missed.”
It’s like it happens in slow motion. Mom reaches the kitchen’s doorway, stops in her tracks, dropping the duffle she’d taken on her latest hunt, and stares wide-eyed at the ghost standing by the table. Dad stares back, face flickering through emotions faster than it should be possible to feel them.
Castiel narrows his eyes. “I am simply trying to make sure the universe does not unravel due to your presence here.”
“Sorry it took a while to answer. Mom...she’s, well, she hasn’t left her room since last night, and I’ve made the executive decision that we don’t need any more casseroles from well-meaning neighbours.”
It’s just...complicated, having dad meet them, is all. But, it’s his whole family together, this is a good thing, right?”
Dean remembers standing in a cemetery in Stull, watching Cas shatter into pieces at the click of an archangel’s fingers. It’s an image he has to quickly shove out of his mind— he has a job to focus on.
“I’ve already spoken with Jack about the risk he placed on his soul doing that. However, he did potentially save an innocent person's life.”
“The body is waiting in the morgue,” Sam says, half focusing on his laptop and half on his chicken wrap. “I figure we send two people in for the body, two to interview the family, then two people wait here and get a headstart with research.”
Dean fists his hands through his hair to stop himself attacking the tree again. The tears in his eyes are dripping down his cheeks, and still, still, his first thought is what if dad comes back and sees this.
Cas nods. In the darkened motel room, he slips his hand around his cock and tugs, hips bucking at the pleasure.
“Don’t.” Dean cuts him off. Judging by John’s look, he wasn’t expecting that. In truth, Dean isn’t sure he was either. There’s a part of him that wants to apologise, but he remembers
Dad’s gaze keeps flicking between the four of them, that same look on his face he gets researching a particularly convoluted case.
Dad’s eyes fill with an emotion Dean’s not sure he’s ever seen on his fathers face before. It is something soft, something prideful. It’s the way he’s always wanted to be looked at.
hunter. He knows what he’s doing. With all due respect, we’ve faced a lot of cases these past years, and Sam...Sam knows when to make the hard calls, and when to...when there’s another way…”
“Is that dad’s journal?” He blurts out, surprised. He’s barely thought about the thing in years, their dad’s twenty something years of hunting anecdotes easily outmatched by the bunker’s extensive collection.
“There’s no talking you out of this, is there?” John says. He doesn’t sound angry, more resigned than anything.
Seeing the guilty look on his brother's face, he immediately lets go of a little bit of that armour.
“But she’s a killer now. So, why them? I’m gathering your old man wasn’t exactly father of the year. You certainly don’t seem all that broken up about him kicking the bucket. But why Henrietta’s mom, and whoever she’s going after next?”
Grateful for the considerably easier topic of conversation, Dean explains the pearl and its wish granting properties.
, Sammy, why should he learn how to use chopsticks when a fork works just as well?) of lo mein to glance at Cas.
Amy Miller is already slipping into the house, let in with a hug from Maria. He took his eye off the ball, didn’t watch his six, let himself get distracted.
“He was a good man,” dad says, restrained. “When he was minding his own business, anyway.” is added with a chuckle.
He sees it happen in slow motion. Cas’ hand starts to move, lift, a familiar gesture. Dean should— but he’s frozen— and— and Castiel’s hand lands on Dean’s shoulder.
Thunk. Thunk. Thunk. Dean’s heartbeat is deafening. His brain starts a chorus ‘he knows he knows he knows’ which is stupid, because Cas and Jack
Even as Dean glances at his dad, wondering what he saw [he’s looking at his paper, it’s fine, it’s fine], he doesn’t miss the way Cas’ face falls. It’s quickly corrected to his usual impassive expression, and Dean pretends he saw nothing for both their sakes even as the guilt gnaws away at the thing that was already so delicate in his chest.
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to say.” Henrietta crosses her arms, leaning away from them. “I wasn’t here when it happened.”
“There were problems at home. There were always problems at home, from the day I was born and probably before that too. But Amy always had her friends— they were close, they were family. I was always in her corner too, or I tried to be, even if she didn’t want me there. I thought with all that, she would be okay, y’know? But then she started arguing back to dad, or even starting fights of her own, and lemme tell ya, that’s one of the first things we learned not to do.”
They stay quiet for the phone call, not wanting to tip whoever is on the end of the line off on the fact that ‘Agent Jepsen’ is out with a few more people than just his partner. Cas nods through the phone call, and says ‘We will be there as soon as possible’ before hanging up.
Dean nods. Right. He doesn’t exactly know how to have this conversation. He guesses he just has to go for it. Jack will understand.
This has never happened before (not spontaneously, at least, and he'd rather not remember being under April's hands). Of course, he knows about it, knows it happens to humans with this set of reproductive organs. He could have made it happen, if he’d wanted to, when he was inhabiting a body and not a body. it would have been like moving any other part of the marionette. Now, he has no choice, it’s sudden and overwhelming and instinctively Castiel wants to reach down and
Cas puts the bowl he was drying down and turns to face him. Dean had been gearing up for another argument, but the look Cas gives him is
“I didn’t know how to talk to you, either of you, not just about that but about anything. So, I just didn’t. I let myself stop thinking about it and threw myself back into hunting because that was something I knew. Then Toni Bevell said something to me.”
“God, you must have been about what...14? Sharp as a tack though. That case probably would have taken months without you.”
, and I guarantee it would be better than this half-thought through plan you took upon your own shoulders!”
Dean kicks Cas’ leg under the table. Cas doesn’t bother to acknowledge it with more than a shrug as if to say ‘well, it’s true’ and yeah, it is. But Dean knows Cas’ social skills have come a long way since he first called them rusty with awkward air quotes. He’s still a weird guy, but now he’s well, weird the way a human is weird. Basically, he
“You stand by this bullshit?” His scathing tone tapers into a hateful laugh. “You know, I should have known. The second I got here, I could tell you weren’t the same kid I left behind. Sure, you tried, but you just couldn’t pull it off, could you? You’ve gone
While Cas kisses, sucks and HOLY HELL, gently bites Dean's neck, Dean's hands make their way to Cas' chest and his nipples.
Best decision ever, they got along so well, they were perfect for each other, made for each other, Dean was so in love.
Before skin touches skin Dean closes his eyes. Touchdown. Lips on lips. Slowly, gently, a bit hesitated, full of understanding between them. As if Dean had never kissed anyone before.
Sure the striped tie and shorter trench have been nice but the whole holy tax accountant outfit was way better.
The usual greeting makes Dean smile, it's so Cas. Cas watches him, eyebrows knitted together as if he is trying to solve a riddle. It's so adorable. Dean has to force himself not to fly on Cas' lap and cover his body in dirty hot kisses.
Jack smiles, just smiles at me, no words neccessary. His hand moving inviting towards me. I take his warm hand and step out into the light.
If he wanted to know what was going on he'd simply buy a paper. At least a paper wouldn't lull him into blue some tiredness.
Every day was just like the day before. The dull passing of time, the walk down the grey sidewalk, passing by the same boring people. Day after day after day. Nothing out of line. Nothing ever changed.
Dean needs some air. He writes a note for the three most important people in his life and leaves for a drive. Not sure where to go, jut go.
For the first time ever I learned how it was to feel, really feel, like those wonderful creatures my father created feel. Oh the sweet and bitter, the good and bad, life and death, making love and making war. A two sided medal. How humans deal with it all day, everyday, I have no idea. It's an endless circle of up and down in every way imaginable.
For once in his life Dean waited patiently for Sam to figure it out. He had his gut telling him that Sam needed that.
The green eyed one pulled him into the hall, turned him and shoved him against the next wall, cuffed him and basically carried him out of the building into the police car while he was telling him the stuff cops always told.
What made it all so news worthy was the state the bodies and their surroundings were found in. Not even even the faintest clue was there to find.
"Okay fair. It was like my world got unhinged. It was like a revelation. I know mom and you and Cas described it to me, but to see for myself... Dean the world is so beautiful."
Quite soon the perfect moment presented itself, they were sitting on the couch, it was so domestic but just right.
There was something special about Cas, Dean often thought. Not only was he this weird dorky dude in sensible shoes, he also was able to see the colors. He never told how that came to be.
His bright wings are spread wide, just for me. They have changed. Once a gentle yellow, their tips glance now in pink and blue.
"Dean, my love, I'm here. Everything is fine, You'll be fine. You are do brave, you are a hero. Honey you saved that boys life. I love you."
It shouldn't bother Dean if Cas has swx. Hell Dean himself had tried to hook up Cas in a brothel once. Funny memory.
Their reunion is quiet, only a few words fall, just hugging after a lifetime away from each other. It's wonderful. Their brotherly bond was, is and always will be one of the purest things ever been seen.
The only tree space is right next to Cas on the bed. 'Well ain't that a bitch.' Runs through Dean's head. Of course he doesn't hesitate, not even for a second. Those days are over. Dean sits down close, very close, next to Cas. So close that their hips almost touch. 'Screw personal space' thinks Dean with a smile.
I'm haunted by all my worst memories, my failures, my losses, tortured with them. No way to redeem myself, not anymore. Nothing left for me.
Everyone wondered why his garden grew so well and beautifull. Especially his neighbor, Mrs. Rogers. She was one nosy specimen of the human race.
"Dean, hey, it's Sam. Uhm I have something to tell you and maybe I should do it in person but yeah."
A few years back it was discovered that there was a way to get the colors back. But it was not an easy way.
For fucks sake! He shouldn't even think about sex and Cas at the same time. What the hell is wrong with him?
His new room was too small, he wasn't even alone in it. He hated sharing rooms. The food was terrible but no one allowed him to cook. And don’t get him started on the “bathroom” situation.
They don't need much touch, they are already harder than an angel blade. Dean loves that it doesn't take much to get such a reaction out of Cas' body. Yes, it is Cas' body, final and forever.
Dean never had felt so happy in his whole life, it was wonderful, it was life, it was everything, all forgotten was his loneliness from before.
Dean was so sick of the grey around him. Grey trees, grey clouds, grey flowers, grey effing everything.
Cas, tortured by April yhe reaper, being stabbed right infront of Dean. Dean forgetting all about Sam who was knocked out. Dean having only eyes for Cas, dead. The rip in Dean's heart festered every time Cas died.
Rumors about Presidents being evil incarnate with their orange skin and bad attitude towards everything they didn't like.
Suddenly a yellow, very familiar, bright  light fills my darkened vision. It's warm, calm and feels like home.
Sam and Jack take off after breakfast. Probably to talk somewhere more private. That leaves the remaining inmates of the bunker alone. Now a days Dean gets a little uncomfortable around Cas. It started after purgatory. Well purgatory 2.0.
Than he more felt than heard the woman coming for the kid. She sounded scared to death and was talking fast, too fast for Dean's adrenaline filed brain to understand anything.
"Get this. I was soulless once too. I might know a little, maybe even able to help. But only if you wish."
His job was one of the most not adventurous jobs ever invented. Though he loved his job. Oh how he loved working on a desk, handling the computer, typing on the keyboard, taking notes on a notebook and handling the same questions from recurring customers over and over again. He loved everything about it.
It had started with his legs, pushing himself up off the ground after Metatron’s betrayal and watching his brothers and sisters fall from heaven. His first steps were not unlike those of a fawn discovering its legs for the first time. Since then he had been discovering his body piece by piece— arms followed not long after legs, coinciding with his core as his chest tightened at the realisation of what he had doomed both the angels and the humans of earth too. When he first had to eat, his tongue had come alive under the first real experience of flavour, teeth had knocked against each other. Moving part by moving part, he was becoming a body.
The five of them don’t move or speak for a long time, after John is sent back to his own time. Even if this is a decision they made together, even if it was the right one, it’s still a heavy one.
It’s not that he’s disheartened by the not-a-date with Nora. She’s a nice woman, and Castiel likes her well enough, but he has no real desire to be with her in that way. But he’s mad at himself for not understanding, mad that he keeps making mistakes...mad that, when Dean had said “I can’t let you do this” something as treacherous as hope had made his heart flip in his chest.
is, so he can’t be the one to start talking even if he wanted to [he doesn’t]. So, he sips weak black coffee with undissolved sugar granules and waits, stomach knot tightening into a noose.
“Who exactly do you think you are?” Dad barges between Dean and Castiel and...oh, they were standing a bit too close there. Dean had stopped noticing at some point through the years. “Their keeper?”
a couple, aren’t they? Married, two kids, the whole shebang. Mary Winchester, the great love and loss of John Winchester’s life. John Winchester, the man who Mary Winchester fell in love with to a soundtrack of Zeppelin and normalcy. They’re both here, together, so why are they like this? Growing pains, Dean thought it had to be growing pains, but hasn’t it been long enough for them to fall back into each others arms? Especially since they were supposed to have talked things out yesterday? On the contrary, it only made mom colder, and some of that seems to have rubbed off on dad now too: It’s like...he’s
He’s human, needs to breathe now, but Dean doesn’t seem to care about that. Cas doesn’t care either. This is a better use of his time and mouth than breathing could ever be. He watches Dean, basking in the way his breath hitches, the way his head falls back and his eyes flutter closed.
Dean zones out for this bit— Sam is explaining what they know about the case so far to Willliamson, just to double check the information they’re currently working from is correct, but Dean remembers the gist.
it, Cas. If anyone knows what my father is capable of, it’s me. And I say he’ll be just fine with Jack for this one case.”
Sam rings the doorbell. It opens on a man, a little shorter than themselves, all soft-bodied and sweatered. His hair is balding a little on top, and his round glasses give him the appearance of a scholar, which Dean supposes he is— Eric Williamson is a literature professor at the university a few towns over, currently on leave after the sudden death of his wife.
Thankfully, dad seems to be in a good mood. Dean mentally thanks the shooting range when he hears John just chuckle instead of...anything else.
“You said it wasn’t your place, to tell me what I should do when it comes to my family. And, yeah, not saying you can boss me around or anything. But...you’re a part of this family too. Your opinion matters to me...always.”
On the fourth day, mom comes out of her room for longer than it takes to go to the bathroom and raid the kitchen for the first time since breakfast that first morning.
The worst thing is, he’s pretty sure that’s really how dad remembers her. He spent his whole life avenging a woman he’d made up in his head.
“Sir, if you just go with mom, then I promise this hunt will be all wrapped up by the time you’re back.”
, his dead father, and somehow it feels even stranger that the time he found his mom in the woods, wearing the white nightgown she died in.
“It means I listen when you talk, Dean! I realised that he’d punish you because he didn’t know how to take care of me, that he’d send you away for stealing so I wouldn’t starve. Th-that I was
The gun, at least, seems to startle the kid, his hands immediately going up in a signal of surrender. Unfortunately, it also seems to startle Sam, who chokes out a ‘what the hell, Dean?’
“I didn’t think she’d go that far!” he defends, suddenly furious, suddenly desperate, though it’s buried quickly. “When...when I started teaching her magic—”
Dean helps himself to a serving of crispy duck and watches everyone around the table pass around various cartons. They ordered
He swipes his thumb over the head of his cock again. A sob builds in his throat, he just can’t tell if it’s from the pleasure or the tears still slipping down his cheeks.
His first instinct is to run out into the hall and check that that’s really real— not something his brain cooked up in a dream.
The point is, there’s a chance the witch has already made their play, which means they need to work fast.
“You were a kid, Sammy. You didn’t have to be grateful for shit. Still don’t. Hell, looking out for you...that was what made the way we grew up worth it, y’know?”
“Oh, you got confused?” Dean scoffs. “That’s why you did the one thing I asked you not to do? The thing you shouldn't have been doing
Only one third of all humans in the last thirty six years ever had gained back what was lost. Ninety percent of them died either during the act or shortly after fulfilling the task. The other ten percent were either injured badly or had mental problems. No one got to see the colors unscathed.
Dean still feels that loss. But he also still feels the happiness when Cas stood right there at a phone booth telling he annoyed a cosmic entity. The tightest hug he ever had with Cas. Although he would never admit that. Cas was back, in all his glory, original trenchcoat and tie, it was like coming home.
A moment later he thinks the clouds have nice shapes. There is one looking like a bear, one that looks like a wolf, a bunny, a dragon (not the real ones, they suck), a moose (oh hello Sammy), a squirrel (there is a universe where it all squirrels, why chuck?) and a bee. Dean's gaze glues to the cloud-bee until the shape is no more. Sad, it's sad that the cloud had to loose that shape. Bees are wonderful animals.
Jack's eyes are red. He probably had cried all night, the poor kid. It was a hard one for the kid to get his soul back. Especially since he still had every memory from when he didn't have a soul.
Cas gently streaks over Dean's anti possession tattoo and for the first time ever Dean sees Cas' enochian warding tattoo in it's full glory.
The news guy suddenly changed his tie. It was a steady striped one, always, but in no time with no warning it became a deep blue one. It was a crime in his eyes. The news guy had been on his way to the hospital after the “married detectives” showed up and saved the day. The news called that lucky.
Son of a bitch! That was smug,that was hot as hell. Cas has hidden talents that's for sure. Dean can barely wait to see what else Cas can do.
Apparently people went missing and only their dead bodies were found weeks later. The police had no clue and was asking for any witness. But so far nobody seemed to have come forward.
Somehow he manages to drive safe to a lake a couple of hours away from the bunker. Is it a coincidence that he lands at the lake from that one dream? Does he even care? It is a nice lake, it is quiet and it always helps to clear the fog in Dean's mind.
How does a man confess his undying love to another man? Dean thinks about it for a second. Words are always a challenge. He might stumble a little. But Cas will understand and either tell him to leave, never come back or... or he won't say that.
The damn Leviathan fiasco, purgatory. Man Cas really has a tendency to die. Well he wasn't the only one. Dean long had lost count of how often Sam or he had died over the years.
Time flys differently when one lives through ones worst nightmares over and over again. Circle after circle, no way to get out.
How did it all begin one might ask? Who I am? How did I end up here? Let me tell you who I am, who I was and who I wished to be.
Dean stands there for five minutes and when he finally raises his hand to knock he hears the wonderful gravel voice from inside.
While his feelings are strong for Sam, very strong, he is his brother after all, what he feels for Cas is not the same.
Everything had it's order. His home was no different. Cups belonged in the cupboard, books on the shelf, towels in the bathroom, sheets in the closet, knifes in the drawers, all nice and clean.
The bitter torture of my past, enhanced throug the shadow. They hate me, they hate me so much. They will never end the torture, there is too much for them to use. Too much to twist into dark until nothing, not even one good memory will be left.
His vision flashed a little green with jealousy. They looked so damn happy when they looked at each other and they did that quite often. It was unbearable. He turned the news off as soon as they showed the "married detectives".
After noticing the absence of the ladies calls, he registered the angry man hadn't called in a while either.
Knocking, permanent knocking in his temples made him push through one day, this couldn't go on any longer.
When Cas had said his time with April had been "educational" Dean felt something drop. Sam elaborated that being stabbed is a hard experience but then oh then Cas clearing it up with "And having sex."
Dean hears Sam huffing, probably wondering what could be so serious that Dean wants to talk. Dean can see the #bitchface through the closed door, he smiles. Yeah Sammy would get Dean's had in the right direction.
It had been kinda clear since the day in that barn. Badass entrance, flying sparks, literally, smirking while being stabbed, like he couldn't care less, yeah Cas had it all! Dean had been lost that day. He simply didn't understand, didn't know, didn't believe, so he pushed it away, afraid of getting hurt, of being abandoned, he pushed it far away. But it always had been there.
Under no circumstances Dean would jump Cas' (that's what he started to call him on day two) bones on the first date, Cas deserved to go through it the right way and so did Dean.
"Oh you've got to tell me how, but not today, I get it. I knew how mom was, and if you say your body is fine that's good, but I figured there are some mental issues?"
"Bouth sound very appealing. Let it be you inside of me, I really wanna know how that feels. Next time we switch."
Woah, what a surprise. Dean always thought he sees Cas as his best friend, his brother. While the first one is kinda true, the second one couldn't be more far off.
The first time Dean didn't witness. Cas stayed with Chuck and got ripped apart by Raphael. Oh but the second time when Lucifer, wearing Sam to the prom, explodes Cas Dean was there, Dean saw. For a moment, after the ground closed behind the falling down Sam, Dean really felt alone. But Cas came back.
"You are right. With everything. I can't really explain what happened. It just did. My heart always knew, my brain just took way too long to catch up."
Umbrella of love, Dean felt like that, for the lack of a better analogy, he felt like under an umbrella of love when Cas' smile reached his heart.
Then there was the angry man, who'd complain about anything and everything, even about having to call and making sure to be speaking to a human and not a robot. He'd ask "are you a machine". If the answer was "no", his reply was "that's what a machine would say". If the answer was "yes", he'd completely loose his mind and throw a litany of cuss-words through the phone.
As Dean lays on his bed with headphones and his favorite tunes, like he tends to do since they had found their final home in the Bunker, his thoughts circle around.
X-Files had been on tv on their third date and as Mulder and scully kissed for the first time after years and years of platonic nonsense, Cas simply turned to him, he had a certain glint in his eyes and kissed him for the second time, but way more heated.
Done as said, the first thing happening was blue. Blue, like the sky, like the deep ocean, blue like a blue never to be seen.
The leading detective pair was puzzled. They both were younger fellas, the first one had piercing blue eyes, tranchcoat, tie always backwards and the hair always looked like he just fell out of bed. It was funny how someone so out of order came to be "Detective Castiel Winchester". They just took everyone for this job these days.
Pants and underwear fall down, get kicked away. Everyone takes a good look. Then they kiss and fall to bed.
Cas wanders up with his mouth to kiss Dean's lips. Dean gratefully accepts everything Cas wants to give and returns it.
When the ambulance arrived, Dean still laid on the sidewalk with his eyes closed, the woman never left his side until the paramedics arrived.
Dean doesn't want to think about April. He really doesn't. He hates her and if he could kill her again he would stab her a thousand times. Not only for torturing Cas. Yeah that wasn't all of it.
Where did Sam learn to give those? Dean wonders surely not from Dad. Dad wasn't a hugger. Dean could count on one finger how often dad had hugged either of his sons.
Jack restored my powers. I missed flying. I thought I forgot how it feels. The wind ruffling my feathers, the airstream in my face, what a great feeling.
Cas doesn't have to ask twice. Dean gently moves slowly in and our. Cas feels damn perfect around Dean.
Orange shock was saying it in understatement, he couldn't think, speak, nor made it any sense what they were saying to him.
Confused from the rainbows of life, of the red that was found in his dirt, the reason his plants grew so well, the orange of his shock which was mirrored in his new clothes, of the white rage running through his veins, he sat there, not really seeing were the problem was.
Over the weeks the news about the dead people got more prominent. The Detectives were topic number one on Twitter and Instagram. They were “trending”, whatever that meant.
In that moment something inside of Dwan clicks. Ha can't find it in himself to be mad at Jack anymore. Looking at Jack standing there, eyes red, big sacks under them, tears still lingering in there, not even able to look Dam nor Dean in the face, Deab feels nothing but love for the kid. He knows he has forgiven Jack.
Faster as Dean's brain could catch up with him, Dean's legs moved and he ran towards the kid on the usual busy street.
Now it's all faded into nothing, gone is the pink, yellow and blue. Gone since the great fall. Which also was my fault.
Soon enough the tongues dance the tango. It's damn hot. Dean's hand wanders in Cas' hair. Thick strong locks roll between his fingers. Cas seems to think that this is a good idea. Soon Dean feels a gentle pull on his own hair.
One thing is different though. I remember before I met HIM, I was not able to feel quite the way humans feel, as stated before, I wasn't built to. I couldn't taste like a human. And now? I can feel everything, taste everything. I wanna taste HIM. Just a little bit. If HE let's me.
And if, for some cruel reason (the universe like to be cruel, well at least before Jack took over), if HE doesn't feel the same, if HE hates me for what I've done, if HE is angry at me for the things I said, if HE is not able to accept what I wish to gift HIM, I'll deal with that too.
Might make an exception on that rule, even if he never did before, because if it didn't work, it got messy.
But the other thing? That was all on him. It had been so damn close. He so damn close to make the worst mistake ever made in human history.
Juggling with work, the perfect Boyfriend and his own shortcomings in terms of asking the big one, Dean had a little bit of a hard time.
Nope, Dean won't explain. The angel would just say something cheesy and hell no. That would ruin the bacon.
He hadn't turned on the news for over two weeks. It was not the huge break from routine as he expected. Quite the contrary. He found that he actually didn't miss the bluntness and directness of the speaker.
Soon after Sam Jack enters the kitchen. Dean turns the oven off, puts the bacon on a plate and places it on the table. He looks at Jack, Jack with a returned souls Dean remembers.
And then there is Cas. Cas in his mind, Cas being ripped apart bey leviathans, Cas having no memory, crazy Cas, Cas hiding from Dean in purgatory 1.0, Cas staying in purgatory, cas making the Angels fall, though that one wasn't really on him, Cas stealing grace to survive, Cas almost dying because stolen grace is not the same, Cas being there when Sam needed him the most, Cas saving Sam from Dean when he was a demon, Cas being ready to be killed just to stop Dean from.leaving when the Mark almost got too strong, Cas getting hexed by, damn, Rowena, Cas saying "yes" to Lucifer. That one was still unclear to Dean. Cas being tortured by Amara, well technically it was Lucifer but he wore Cas to the prom. And probably the worst, Cas being stabbed to death by Lucifer. His broken wings burned into the ground. That picture was burned in Dean's brain, would never be erased.
Every fiber in him longed for someone, someone to feel, to touch, to share every part of himself with.
The thrusts speed up more, the moaning gets louder. Dean is close. He can feel Cas is close too. Inbetween his thrusts he gently streaks over Cas' dickhead, pumps him and the sound it pulls from Cas is all Dean needed.
There wasn't only April. There was also Daphne. The chick who took care of Cas when he had no memories. Dean sometimes wonders if Cas had have sex with her. They were married, holy hell. Though Cas never said a word about her or him having sex with her.
The nice lady with the doctor dramas suddenly didn’t want to talk to him anymore, she demanded a new person. Maybe he should have said “yes” at least once. His apples never tasted better.
Jack has good and important work for me. I'm gladly helping him to build the heaven everyone, the heaven HE deserves. HE at least gained the right to feel true happiness. So does every good being in the universe. Even if it's only in the afterlife.
Reaching for the box inside his pocket, Dean looked for words, found them and spilled them, the big one was out in the open, now the ball was in Cas' yard so to speak.
Cas' lips aren't enough for Dean anymore, he needs to taste much more of Cas. His wonderful smell like a fresh summer breeze drives Dean nuts. Dean's lips Cas' sharp jawline and wander to Cas' neck. Necking is hot as hell and if Dean's weren't already hard as a rixj that surely would do it. Up and down Dean kisses and licks, hears soft moans from Cas. Also a whisper of his name.
"I've never expected you to say that to me. You surprised me. But it's a good surprise. Because I feel the same way Dean. I'm in love with you too."
Also, if he ever felt the red heat of his anger, his garden was where he let it go into. He still would do it with love, his garden was his everything.
Being one of it's citizens had always been Dean's dream, now, as an adult, he finally made it his reality.
Zero regrets on the day of days, only love and love and love when they both agreed to spend all eternity together.
What he did on his way out of the Bunker still pains him. Not the Rudy thing though. Sure that was bad but he could put that one on Rudy and the influence of the Mark yelling for blood.
The clean part was more in his focus than anything else. He couldn't stand any kind of dirt. Not a spider, nor a silverfish, not even a fleck of dust. He always used the same brand of cleaning supplies.
It was pure jealousy that ran through Dean as he heard these words. Cas has had sex with April. A reaper. A fucking Reaper. He gave it up to a reaper. Yeah, Dean tried to push the jealous feeling down with joking but he knows now that he definitely was jealous. As he thinks about it he wonders why he would be jealous.
Dean realizes the last truth for today. He never was straight. He always had been bisexual. He tries the words out, loud to the forgiving nature around him.
I used to be strong, fearless, I commanded my own garrison. Nothing really scared me. But I felt not many emotions. Angels aren't built to feel, not the way humans do.
The way home.is faster and easier than ever before. Dean's favorite tunes accompany him and he sings along. No one will ever hear his perfectly in tune singing this day except him and his Baby. This is the end of a very long painful road and Dean can't wait to see what lies ahead.
Apparently seeing a rainbow but not being able to see the vibrant seven colors it used to have broke all the rules of so called society.
Cas' blue eyes are bluer than ever after that statement, deep feelings pouring out of them. Blue sapphires search through Dean's soul for a hint of trickery. Cas won't find one. Dean is an open book, he allows Cas to swallow all, allows Cas to burn his blue eyes into Dean's soul. He doesn't look away, not this time, never again if he has any say in it.
HE used to look into my vessels eyes for prolonged lengths of time. I loved it so much,  never got tired of it. I could've looked back for eternity and it wouldn't ever have been long enough.
It shouldn't be that hard, couldn't, won't, that's what he told himself every night when he lay in his bed alone.
"It's true Jack. Sam was in a cage in hell a couple of years back. I pulled him out but I couldn't get all of him so his soul stayed there. He was soulless for over a year."
Dean wraps his head around that one. Could it be? The last woman he kissed? Could it be that it was Amara? For real? No wait, there was the nice lady when claire got bit by a werewolf. Not a memory Dean likes to remember.
The shadows of the past where he had to be to good soldier, the tool, Daddys blunt instrument are fleeing from the light that is now in him. Hearing he is accepted the way he is, accepted despite who he loves, is even allowed to love gives him wings to fly.
While kissing the angel senseless Dean relives him of the damn trenchcoat and jacket. Before Dean is able to unbutton the white denim Cas relives him of the flannel. Dean is so fucking glad he didn't wear a jacket. Both men are on the same amount of layers now. Dean Jeans, shirt and boxers (socks don't count, thank you very much) and Cas white denim, trousers and underwear.
Nothing ever happened around the world. At least nothing new. The headlines morphed into one another. A war here, a sickness there, some demonstrations, presidents came and went, leaders were elected and thrown out, homeless people would always be there. Same old same old. It made him feel content.
"Huh? Oh yeah. I think I forgave you when you gave up the souls from purgatory. I know you did what you thought was right back then."
Find my hunter (yes HE is mine) and do what I longed to do for so long. No cowardness anymore. No hesitation. I'm not scared anymore, I don't want to be. I wanna give just love, my love, all my live to HIM.
Oh damn! This is hard. Dean wants to say something nice, something reassuring but how do you say "hey I know you killed my mom but you were soulless so it's cool man"? Because if he opens his mouth something exactly like that will come out.
He didn't drink, hasn't done that in ages, doesn't do drugs in general, has a stable and very perfect relationship, so why he would feel off was a huge riddle to him.
My wings are open, ready to fly where my heart belongs. My grace is buzzing like a beehive. My whole being is anticipating. I can't wait to look in HIS gentle eyes. Can't wait to see this beautiful soul again, the soul I once hold in my own hands, so fragile but oh so strong.
Dean juggles these questions for a while. Yes to the first one Dean is sure Sam knows, has known for a while. That actually answers the other two questions with no. Sam doesn't mind nor judge. Dean is sure his brother will be nothing than supportive.
Cas uses both hands now to explore Dean and his tucking in Dean's flannel, well the buttons, makes it quite obvious that Cas has enough of the clothing. Dean can't argue that, it's  friggin great idea. He moves back to Cas lips.
The work in heaven was exciting but now it's finished and finally I can go down to earth. I'm a little scared, scared for HIS response to my confession. Will HE acknowledge it? Will HE ignore it? Will HE hate me? Did I loose the best thing I ever had because I said what I said? Or do I have any reason to hope? I don't really know. And that scares me.
Then there was Meg. Damn that demon stole a kiss right infront of Dean. Cas even kissed her back. Dean now remembers that April wasn't the first one who got the jealousy thrown from Dean.
Of course he was mourned but it was clear from birth that he wouldn't live long and thanks to Cas, Jimmy and his family had so much time to make it perfect.
Maybe she moved away, these things seem to happen. It didn't really matter. He wouldn't miss her bugging.
After four months of this, Cas asked Dean if he'd like to move in with him and hell yes, Cas' place was perfect, so of course Dean agreed.
Yeah sure, guys had flirted with him. Some were even kinda successful (no thank you very much) but damn. Had this been always a part of him? Or is it only Cas? Is it Cas who holds the key to Dean's broken heart, to heal it?
Rumors about already rich managers, getting even more rich by exploiting the poor out of their last penny.
I better take some time to calm down. That's not who I want to be. Who I want to be is someone full of love, full of peace. One who is worthy of HIS friendship, HIS touch, HIS Love.
Right now there is no hunt, nothing to do about Chuck so the four living members of the family business have the day off. Which is basically hell for Dean's circling thoughts. The circle and circle, never stop. Nothing really helps. No movie, no music no alcohol, nothing. It's a mess in his brain. Thinking about all the wrongs he did. Thinking about all the messes HE made. Thinking about all the chances he let slip because of it.
Before I'm able to go I feel a shift, a pull on our bond, profound as ever, I feel death. HE...died? Why did HE die? How did HE die? HE wasn't supposed to die! Not yet!
"Come on Cas, don't look at me like that. I'm fine, I swear. It's nothing bad, well I hope, I just need to get ot done."
Who ever invented nose breathing was a total genius otherwise Dean would've already died from lack of oxygen. Cas of course doesn't really need to breath.
I feel calm, never felt that calm before, full of live and happy. No reason anymore to not feel happy. No reason anymore to be scared of being happy. The deal is done. I never need to worry about it again. It's over, it's done.
Jack's grip gets a bit tighter, he sniffles a little, looks up to Dean, worrying. Dean knows there is no hint of a doubt in his eyes for Jack to see.
The voice of the speaker always had been so tiring. Spoken without any emotion about everything, even murder. It gave him nausea every time.
Mrs. Rogers finally found out what his secret for his garden was, also she found out why her beloved pets didn’t come home. She didn’t like it, at all, so she had to go. There was no time to see how his strawberries would turn out.
One, only one, colleague stood out to him, beautiful blue eyes, dark messy hair, strong jawline with stubble, heck yeah!
One hand still in the others hair both parties explore the shape of the others body with the free handmade streaking over backs, petting arms, curassing the chest and neck. Up and down, not that far down, yet. The circle begins again.
HE was supposed to live HIS life in the fullest. I went into the darkness so HE can live. I died for HIM!
For a long time I didn't know where I fit in, who might be my real family. Even though I was never quite alone. But I didn't know!
I stand infront of HIM, way to close as always but I don't even care. I stand infront of HIM, stare into HIS eyes and I know it will be okay. I know my heart is safe. With the two words, so often spoken, I stand infront of HIM:
Work was the same as always and Dean liked it that way. Afterwards he drove home. Well, where else would he go? Though something felt off and Dean couldn't put his finger on it. It drove him nuts.
Another thought, well more like a picture, shoves itself up from the pits of Dean's mind. Bees. Why had it to be bees? Bees, the bees Cas loves to watch. Hell doesn't even only watch. He adores them.
In a Hollywood worthy move, Dean shoved himself infront of the truck, grabbed the kid, fell on his back, slid over the street out of the line of the truck. He could feel his back getting scratches, getting road burns on his tights and somehow his ankle twisted from the sudden movement in a way that was not natural.
Yes, Dean knew he was in for a very good, no not good, for a perfect satisfying night, who was he to stop Cas, Dean was only human after all, right?
What even surprises Dean more is that he doesn't miss the one night stands or the random pick ups in a bar. Sure, he still got it, tests it out on any occasion. He simply isn't interested in that anymore. That really gets him. Why isn't he interested in awesome sex with a hot lady? Something must be wrong with him. Oh no! Don't let it be an age thing. He is way too young for that, barely scratched fourty.
What a surprise it was, when Cas kissed him on date two, that was really unexpected but oh so very welcome.
Lying under the blue sky on a sunny day at his favorite place Dean realizes why he gets jealous about Cas, he realizes why it always crushes him more when Cas does than when Sam dies (this alone is soul crushing). And he realizes what an idiot he is for taking so damn long to understand.
Black, strong, they could fly everywhere. And when the sun stroke them, their deep black shimmered colorful.
That else was something new. Since the grey, humanity grew closer to each other. No matter who one was, where they lived, what color of skin they had or even who they loved. All of that nonsense that somehow mattered before, it was gone, non of it lived through loosing the colors.
Cas looks curious about the lack of space nit doesn't complain. He doesn't say anything. Dean knows Cas is waiting for him to say what he wants to say, patient as always.
No one knew for sure anymore. All the elders, as in people older than 45 were gone. Some early on, others later.
X-mas rushed over with little notice, sure presents were exchanged but not the usual fuss, because everyone was busy with being happy for the oncoming wedding.
Damn, the bastartd really always knows. It's too cute when Cas worries. But today he doesn't need to.
It feels good, feels right, feels like the missing piece of a pussle finally had been found. Wow! It feels great!
Heavy lay the ring in his pocket for weeks, weeks of chickening out, weeks of being nervous like a bird.
I wish I could see it that way. Yes, I was lied to, but working with Metatron was dangerous, I knew that. What else can one expect if the scribe? But I was desperate, desperate to bring back order in heaven. I should've known...
No one asked Cas to do it, he did it just for Jimmy, no arterial motives. And that's why there wasn't any physical or mental harm.
After taking a long hot shower, eating a breakfast which would fill the gods with envy, aka bacon and pancakes, he was ready and drove his baby to work.
Cas has his hands first under Dean's shirt. The kiss is shortly broken in favor of getting the shirt out of the way.
Mrs. Rogers was devastated over that and wondered for a long time what she did wrong with her two fur balls that they decided to not show up again. And she wondered if they were okay. So far she didn't get an answer to either of those questions.
Who would've thought? Neither of his parents really cooked. It did scare him the first two times how much he liked it but he came to see it as something very good. Something that makes him feel good without being drunk or having a lady under him or on top, whatever.
Dean can't fight anymore. Maybe it's time to resolve this. It's not like Chuck will suddenly leave them alone or anything. So why not solve it now? He gives in to the thoughts. He tells himself that it's okay to swirl in the thoughts simply to get over them and forget about it. He was sure, once he solved it, it will leave him alone.
Now or never, he thought, he was damn determined to finally ask the most important question in his whole life tonight.
Dean thinks about that often. What would've happened if he never got Sam? But lately, well since the whole Mark thing, Sam had kinda changed. Just slightly. Not the full "I'm a new person" crap of change. No, Sam got more determined to their cause. He cam to finally accept the hunter life, even to like it. Although Dean knows that deep down Sam still wishes for a normal life. Hell Dean does too. But they don't do normal so here is that.
He takes the same route Cas took, kissing, sucking, gently biting Cas' neck down to his nipples. Cas moans louder.
He had been ready to kill himself, had been ready to be killed by Death (yes the horseman), even had been ready the one most valuable person in his life in order to been taken far away.
"Through something I'm not ready to discuss with you, my color vision has returned today. Physically I'm fine, so don't worry about me."
I feel the moment HE arrives, HE knows I'm alive. I feel HIS longing, though HE'd never say it out loud, always afraid to show the truth.
Is that what you feel when kissing an angel? Or is it just that Dean finally kisses HIS angel? His angel who kisses him back.
Patience usually wasn't his strong suit but at least Dean had to make sure first he knew the greek gods name and if he swang that way.
The kicker was that it wasn't doable with the goal of seeing colors again.  It was tested quite thoroughly.
A few days later, Dean was on the walk to a bakery for Sundays breakfast buns, no regular thing but sometimes Cas and him felt like it.
What made him so lovable to Dean was that he never bragged about his ability, nor did he ever belittle someone for not being able to see colorful. Basically, Cas was the kindest human Dean ever met.
Why can't he do anything the easy way like Sam does? Why does he always have to get angry or drunk or both? And why is it always his family who gets the whole shitshow blown in their faces? They don't deserve that, well they don't deserve to get stuck with his sorry as. He doesn't deserve them, their attention, their caring or whatever. He is a grunt and he knows it.
Dean realizes there is the topic of how to perform the final step. Though nothing holds him back anymore. He is free, free to use his words.
After a long, uneventful day of work and cleaning, he used to sit down, eating dinner and watch the news at point eight in the evening.
Kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, living room, Kitchen again, cause it couldn't be to clean and cellar. Rinse and repeat.
Rumors of a "pandemic" going through the world, killing a lot of people and leaving the survivers with only the grey.
But he remembered, he remembered how colorful the world used to be. Now it was bleak, grey, dim, boring and depressing.
Dean finally realizes jack is family. He had struggled with that for so long. Now it's Chrystal clear to him.
Endless love was what it was, Dean never knew how good it could be, he wouldn't change anything besides his last name, hopefully not so far in the future.
That can't be right! There must've been a girl or woman, whatever after that. Maybe the witch that hexed him with a love spell? Though he can't even remember if they did the do.
John was the last person over 45 that died. He didn't know anything. So the world mourned him but nothing else.
My truest self, of course not visible to the human eye, a thing one poor woman named Pamela had to find out the hard way, is the size of the human Chrysler-Building, with multiple heads, build to be a warrior.
A small tube magically appears from somewhere. Dean didn't know that Cas was still able to perform even such minor wonders.
It works for a while. Dean can ban Cas out of his mind for a minute or two but then another picture pushes over the bee picture.
Anger is not a new emotion for me. And I am angry, very angry. More angry than I ever was. Well maybe not quite more than that one time when HE wanted to say "yes".
Dean knows Sam loves the kid with all of his big heart, like he was really his father. And it shows. Jack embraces the hug and let's it all go. Tears, Dean can't see but knows they are there, are cried into Sam's flannel. Soothing words are whispered into Jack's ear from.Sam and after a moment Jack relaxes, calms down.
This sounded easier on the road than actually doing it. Dean parked Baby in the garage about ten minutes ago. He's still sitting behind the wheel. He never had been good with that chick flick crap.
Detective Winchester, blue eyes, showed a paper and said something about having a warrant to search through his home.
The kiss deepens, not that it was possible but it does. Dean is on the verge of crying from happiness and they don't even use tongue yet. What the hell? Is he really that big of a sap? Hell yeah he is. And? He doesn't care anymore. He simply let's go.
My wings back to their former glory, or even better, cause I'm stronger than I ever have been. Jack gave me back more than I ever had. I don't deserve it. Jack thinks differently.
"Detective Dean Winchester" was neither what he thought a detective should look like. He never wore anything fancy, just jeans, flannel and an army Jacket. The most interesting thing were his super green eyes and his face full of freckles.
Quintessential as it was, he learned the guys name was Castiel, what a weird name, and according to how he behaved, he definitely was interested.
Dean was just a child when it happened, only four years old. Sammy was even younger, like six months old.
After a while the pain set in. He found the voice to ask for an ambulance and a call to his husband. Though they weren't married yet, but hell that was such a close call, Dean would be a damn fool to not change that.
"Cas." Dean breaths in the air while his hands explore all the exposed skin. He needs to touch every inch of Cas' wonderful tanned skin. How does he even keep it tanned? It doesn't matter. Cas simply is perfect.
Dean remembers how upset Sam had been back then, when he only remembered one thing from.his soulless self with Samuel. Dean knows Sam remembers everything since Cas had broken the wall.
Sam smiles towards the kid, gets up and does the most simple thing. He pulls Jack in for a tight fatherly hug.
It's not pornographic, like loud moaning or name calling, no it's way more. Sure the louder stuff will follow but this is so much better than anything Dean ever had.
