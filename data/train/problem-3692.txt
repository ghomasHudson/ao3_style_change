“What do you mean by specifically?” Dean asks with a smile.
“Well—anyway,” Castiel supresses a beam out into the creeping darkness at Dean’s words and how unnecessary albeit delightful they are, “when you’re distant, it’s usually because there
“Thank you,” John says shortly, before turning back around and leaving. Dean doesn’t lift his head back up. It suddenly feels far too heavy.
“Thank you,” Castiel replies. Dean feigns a smile.
“No,” Castiel shakes his head. “I guess not.”
“Yikes,” Garth squirms.
“I was,” Dean presses on, swallowing, breath uneven. He wants to ask. He wants to ask—
“I don’t know.” Dean admits, sighing. “I won’t be so caught up on revenge. I won’t forget about the family I still
“Right,” he agrees. Then, “You angry about it?”
“Yes. Me too.”
Michael speaks gently now. It makes Castiel lift his head up to face the King properly. Michael kneels down in front of his youngest brother, and Castiel is infinitely grateful for his change in tone.
“Yes,” Ellen confirms. “I think that’s all he’s ever wanted. That and saving everyone.”
He writes to Dean again when he gets back. Dean is relieved to know that Castiel is alright; but his letters are more formal than Castiel remembers them. He only states current events; Castiel can hear the ring of Dean’s responsibilities even through his writing.
Castiel’s gaze shoots up, hard and fast. He scowls at his father.
Sam has several tubes feeding into him—the crook of his elbow, his wrist, his nose. He looks tired and pale, his skin is sallow. Bags indented under his eyes. He looks worse than he did when Castiel saw him last, which is unsurprising.
“You said we met—”
Dean smiles and takes another mouthful of food before shrugging carelessly. “I’ve said it before,” he answers, mouth full of pasta, “the chick rocks brown leather like nobody else. But Charlie, you rock Lord of the Rings paraphernalia like nobody else. I reckon you guys are a great match,” he grins, and winks.
Dean’s voice is quiet now, and it still grazes his throat as he speaks. It is laced with defeat and hopelessness and even the sound of it is enough to make renewed tears, these ones of a different kind, sting at the back of Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel sits down next to him.
“No, I
Jael would do just this: they were learning, and quickly, that there was little nobility in Evadne, and even less in politics. It was not like life in the faith, where all served God and all were equals, even if they had differing roles under the guidance of Abra.
to him,” Dean almost laughs, and Castiel offers him a frown, before looking back down at the dog.
“He’s downstairs with your dad. They got talking about some weird intellectual stuff—I don’t know, I totally zoned out and just came up here. I don’t think I even

two separate instances of people talking about how hard they’re crushing on Cas. Who can blame them? And who can blame Cas for loving this place? He’s found his home.
“You should be
“Dean—” Castiel panics, but Dean has leapt from this arm towards the crack in a blood-stilling moment which forces Castiel to catch him in the hand he was using to cover his broken chest. Dean planned for this, of course, and grins up at him.
Castiel laughs again. “No,” he shakes his head. “Why do you think that?”
“I’m not asking for an apology, Dean, I’m asking for an explanation.”
Jo caught herself in half a second.
is nobody marrying this guy?”
Thursday night Dean gets out all his classic rock records, and they lie in the living room listening to them with a couple of root beers between them. Jack asks questions about the music but then somehow drifts on to ask about Dean’s mom and brother like he’s putting a puzzle together, all mechanical and serious.
“It was, for the most part,” Alastair says, and the way that he says it tells Dean that his initial reply to Hess had been dismissive and brief, that he’d been hoping it was the only one necessary. “But have employees, anywhere, and they’re bound to
“—A one-off,” Dean continues, “just to introduce him. It wasn’t in the centre of town or anything—”
Castiel’s jaw clenches, though he looks away. Gabriel hangs his head.
“A scotch, thanks, neat. We need to celebrate. For you, Castiel?”
“Hey, we’ll figure it out,” Dean speaks, hard and certain over Benny. Dean’s words are rough rocks against the soft southern of the vampire’s drawl. “Cas,” he says, and Castiel tries to harden himself to something he knows is unstoppable, immovable: Dean’s resolve, and Castiel’s love for it. “Buddy, I need you.”
“And if she did reach out?”
“I’m not experienced in officiating weddings,” she starts out, “surprisingly, that’s not one of my duties as a sheriff. So don’t hold it against me if I miss anything out, or slip up on my lines… It’s not like this counts for anything, anyway—”
“And what was that like?” She asks.
Not even ten years old, and both her parents dead. Not even Dean was that unfortunate.
“Sure. Usually we don’t use them for light, but…”
“You really don’t see it?” Balthazar asks, feigning incredulity.
“And why wouldn’t your heart be in it?” Cas asks. That quirk of his eyebrows. Slope of his shoulders. The delicate and troubled incline of his head. God. Dean never had a chance. Dean never had a chance.
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Had something of a cough, last week,” Castiel looks away, swallowing. “But has all but recovered, now.”
Castiel presses the flat of his palm out against Dean’s, stretching out his fingers, as though measuring their hands out against each other.
you kiss me back—straight or not—”
“I didn’t mean—”

This can’t be true. This one can’t be true.
Dean sighs.
pretty crazy. Maybe you’re dreaming—you should probably pinch yourself to check.”
“That’s not good for you, Dean,” he shakes his head. Dean rolls his eyes.
“Yes, it snowed there,” the shepherd confirms. Dean’s insides twitch anxiously at the suddenly removed tone and expression.
“They’re adults. They’ll handle it.”
“No,” Castiel shakes his head again. “Something was very wrong with him, I’m certain of it.”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
“Absolutely,” he answers. Charlie looks unconvinced. “Seriously,” Dean says, and leans forward. “I was

This comment makes the guilt inside of him start gnawing away and the walls of his body.

“I’m so sorry, Cas,” he shakes his head, words leaving him like a sigh, pacing toward his friend without thinking.
Cas. Castiel kissing,
Dean nods and thanks them, slipping back into his room and pulling on a shirt. A breeze ruffles his hair; the hairs on the back of his neck and forearms bristle. Pinpricks skitter down the planes of his skin.
Dean huffs, but something in it is sad. No, the birds cause more work than they could ever, possibly, get done. Even Cathy seems to eat more game than she catches.
Anna’s frown weaves its way across her face.
“And I’ll be right here,” Dean reminds. Castiel glances at him and smiles.
“Yeah,” Dean confirms.
“He got you a
“I’ll try.”
“Years of being friends with Cas, man. It gets you places.”
“Cas…” The other boy says, slowly, hoarsely, something in his gaze moving a mile a minute, something else in it completely static.
He has spent what feels like hours in his room, attempting to clear his mind of the fog that seeped into it as Michael told him the truth about his own life and Castiel’s. And as Castiel thinks about it more and more, he feels angrier with Michael. But not just angry: pity towards his eldest brother and something not unlike empathy for the High King seeps into his heart.
No, stare is too hard a word. Not for this. Never for this.
“Near enough,” Ellen nods, standing.
him in this state, had probably thought him useless and pathetic and deplorable—it kills Dean. He burns with shame at the memory.
Castiel sighs, making his way into the living room of his apartment and sitting down in his favourite armchair.
“Oh, I’m not so sure,” he grimaces. “He’s not really the—”
Castiel can read the look. Castiel can read
“—Who, Ellen?” Dean asks, glancing over at the Angel.
“I think you inherited other parts of him,” Dean points out, squeezing Cas softly.
“Yes,” he answers. “I’ll watch.”
“That song was—was—” Dean cannot get the words out. The stars, overhead, riddling the sky, tick at them like the immeasurable cogs of some vast clock. “Was a love song?”
“Sure,” he says. “Why not?”
“Both,” Dean laughs. The shepherd huffs.
But still, their relationship, whatever it entails, will be a particularly adverse one. Dean has probably been promised a life lead only by his own choices, by his own loves, until now. Castiel has never been given that. It has always been a granted that he should marry to benefit the people—this was probably never said to Dean until he was practically forced into the betrothal.
“And what of your father?” Dean asks. A mask slides over the shepherd’s features, the feeling it stirs in Dean is like being choked.
to engage, and write notes, all the while wanting to crack his skull open against the white walls of the kitchen. He wishes Anna goodbye when, another hour later, she hops down the stairs, ready to leave, and then sluggishly gets up to make his way into the living room, hoping to find something a little more palatable to read. He catches sight of the Impala out in front of the green house across the street, and wonders how long it has been there: he didn’t notice it when hammering down the
“Have you
“Dean,” she starts, voice cracking in her throat, “I know you—I know you’re hurting, today. But just go easy on your brother, okay? He’s… He’s hurting, too, you know?”
“Dude, time was you used to waltz into that house at any and all hours—”
“No,” Castiel replies honestly, shaking his head. “I had no idea.”
“How—how long have I—how long was I—”
It hadn’t been a special week, nothing had marked it out as anything in particular, nothing life-changing and nothing devastating. Dean wants to punctuate it romantically, will come to long for some kind of marker of its significance in future; a final conversation, a final laugh shared, a final
“You’re welcome to me,” the older man points out.
The second time they touched, it was for David to ruffle Michael’s hair.
“Dean said that you were his and Sam’s nanny, after the Demon attack on Hera?” Castiel asks, after a brief quiet between himself and Ellen. Ellen looks up, as though having been lost in a daze, and nods.
“The first one of your books I ever read,” Castiel smiles. “Out of Human books, that is.”
“What’s gross about me congratulating my friend—”
you, perhaps…” Dean freezes, eyeing Castiel slowly and nervously—the stabbing silence that falls between them lasts only a moment, before Dean shakes his head sharply and attempts to pat Castiel on his shoulder—which is such an odd motion for Dean to take up at this moment, so unnatural considering his current feelings towards Castiel—and he seems to realise this, because he falters a moment and the same anger and bitterness flash behind his eyes as though he is reminding himself yet again of all that he believes that Castiel has done to him.
“I always wanted to learn Hebrew,” he says, still flicking through the thin, soft pages slowly.
But Michael came to him the night before their twenty-first birthday and told him the truth. And the world reeled with betrayal.
He eats silently.
“Sure,” he answers.

“Yes,

Which is nice sometimes,” Charlie says quickly, making Dean smirk. “But—sometimes—you want to get into the
“Come back with me—”
And Samandriel, not getting any of that, not feeling any of that, still asked Cas to stay—not for Dean, not for Jimmy, not for his home here in Kansas, Samandriel asked Castiel to stay for
“I…” His insides are trembling in shrill, fragile movements. “I don’t want it to end,” he answers, honestly.
“None that’ll settle for me,” with a shrug.
“Really?” Mara asks, eyes bright, obviously attempting to mute her excitement. “When?”
“How?”
“No, I mean it,” Dean shakes his head in the bright lighting of the hospital corridor. “You’re flying halfway across the world in a couple of days, but you still—”
The large square is crowded with more Humans than Castiel has ever seen. They are led through the crowd, which parts dutifully, and up the steps, to stand the other side of the Winchester family.
Cas nods confirmation.
“I’d probably show you the view from my window,” Castiel smiles. “Every morning I wake up and see the sun rising upon the face of the earth.”
heartbreak, he tells himself. He doesn’t feel anything. He can’t feel anything. He won’t feel anything. “And Cas summoned the empty.” His chest trembles. No—
“I don’t know,” Dean confesses. “It—it felt like years. Why is that? Jack said he thought I might lose my way—but if I was following—was following whatever part of him was speaking to me—”
“After that, I—or I felt that I—had nothing left. Nothing to stay for. I left the farm, the flock, the land of my forebears… I took to wandering, again—only this time, I had no one to call me home. That’s a listlessness you cannot speak of. It’s one thing to roam. It’s another to roam without a tether.”
He says: Dinner and packing and storytelling with Mara and you taking me to the airport like we always used to talk about. The goodbyes. The present you gave me. The time you called me, drunk. Every time you called me, since. How you sounded when you called to congratulate me on my book. The sign you made when I came back home. How happy you looked. How happy I
“Oh. What is it?” Castiel asks, barely caring, and wanting to return to his book.
Castiel says his goodbyes in the large, ten sided courtyard at the front of the castle, recalling when he first stepped out into this courtyard, seventeen, terrified the boy he was to be married to would hate him. He glances up at Dean and sees the Human looking broken at the thought of Castiel leaving once more. It rips something raw inside of the Angel to see.
“So, do you have it?” She asks. Dean blinks. “The book!” She sighs. “Hand over the book.” Dean glances at Sammy. “Wow,” she looks over at Lucifer. “Slower than they look.”
“Are you okay?” Castiel asks again, and realises he has stood up as he has said these words. He and Dean face one another.
the King smiled softly, pulling back. He grazed the back of his forefinger against one of Castiel’s tiny feathers, the feathers that promised so much hope to Michael; the feathers that were a gift from Abra to promise hope to all Her people. Castiel turned to look at their father and held out one of his arms. Michael dutifully handed the little boy over to the High King.
“And you’re friends now?” Charlie asks, unconvinced. Dean nearly scowls.
get started on that—your father will be bad enough, but if
“And I know that your situation is not a desirable one from a Human perspective, Dean; although from that of an Angel it was only to be anticipated—”
“I’m glad I did,” Castiel replies, honestly. Dean presses his lips together, a wall going up around his features so that Castiel cannot read them.
“How’s it been?”
“But sex can mean a lot of different things,” Cas points out, “and we don’t need to do all the things that it implies, ever, if you don’t—”
“I see that Dean has found himself a new plaything, to occupy his time,” he inclines his head curiously. “Be careful,” he says to Benny, “that he does not cast you aside as thoughtlessly as he did my brother.”
to be exasperated by. “You never tell us how you feel or what’s going on with you and—”
The words are spoken gently, almost whispered, and they still somehow manage to pummel at Dean’s soul, turning it black and blue.
“My signing’s a little rusty,” He states, apologetically, still accompanying his words with sign language. “I’m sorry—”
Castiel’s soul is shaking.
“And actually, Bobby, I think you’ll find that it
“You’re talking like you—like you—you say that he felt—”
Castiel rolls his eyes at his brother’s smug hum.

Anna asks, giving a small, worried frown in Castiel’s direction as she speaks.
he remembers to close his door—and leans back against it. He doesn’t know what he wants. He doesn’t know what he needs. He doesn’t know what to do—should he go and talk to Adam, explain away what he thought he saw and say that Adam shouldn’t tell anyone? But—but has Adam told anyone, already? Was dinner in the Eyrie filled with Adam’s tale of wandering in on Dean and Cas locked in an embrace that no

“And where was the open window?” Dean asks, before the last of them has a chance to enter his father’s chambers. The sentry points further down the corridor, and Dean sees it. The air is even colder down this end of the passageway.
going to be his girlfriend?
Dean tries not to glower at Castiel, but it’s difficult, because he hates how right Castiel is. The last time they had this kind of discussion, Dean ended up yelling at Castiel. He doesn’t want to do that again.
“Yeah, brother or not, Sam’s still an adult. You’re young. C’mon.”
Michael says slowly. These words sound scripted; especially with the forced, pained expression and tone that Michael holds. Anna is staring expectantly at their older brother.

“Stop it!” Dean shouts. “Stop it!” He feels drunk, drunken, caught in one of John’s drunken rages, except now
It’s not intentional. It’s just—one of them will call, and it’ll be late at night for one of them, or early in the morning, and one of them will be needing emotional support, or to vent, and slowly under the soft vulnerability their voices will turn tender and their hands will drift over their own skin as the other speaks and they’ll each imagine it’s the other doing this to them—and then each admit that this is what they’re doing—and—well, the point is, neither of them is able to hold to this promise particularly well. The others, though, they follow through on. Both of them end up pretty confused.

“I never should have invited you to dine with us.”
“Ha.”
“You’re not going to be alone,” Benny says softly, his thumbs stroking at Dean’s spine. He takes a shuddering sigh against the warm, firm plane of the knight’s chest.
At least he answers her. Prior to her pregnancy, he would ignore her attention completely, only reply if Chay commanded it.

“Me too.”
Dean sighs again at his brother’s hesitance.
“Beloved,” he answered.
“Come in,” he calls, expecting Sam or Adam, but is taken aback to see the shepherd at the weathered doorframe, peering in.
Dean falters.

“That’s kind of the point, I thought?”
“I don’t—” he stammers, the words ash.
“Yes, the older Winchester brother certainly took us all by surprise,” Lucifer chuckles softly, sitting too. Dean, shaking, returns to his seat. Benny’s hand on Dean’s shoulder tightens significantly. “And how cruel it was for us to overlook you, Dean, when you might just be the key to my return.”
the King spat.
his whole frame taut and bouncing, tightly coiled, distracted and excited and focussed; his wide eyes move like birds, bouncing from head to head, searching for the right face. Castiel could kiss him. He could kiss him, now; pace over to his best friend and not give a second thought to wrenching his best friend in the world into the tightest embrace, their lips meeting, his hand slipping to the back of Dean’s neck and stroking up the short hairs there, fingers weaving through to the longer hairs on Dean’s head. Dean, startled at first, would then settle, settle into it as his long eyelashes fluttered and Dean’s hands came to rest on Castiel’s shoulders. This could be it. This could be how Castiel says
“I don’t understand.”
“If a four year old can be a good person, that means a four year old can be a

“Oh,” Dean laughs, “as long as you want. As long as you’ll have us. I mean—I have work tomorrow,” he admits. “But hey—Cas won’t have anything to do, for a few days—”

of nicknames for me. Only really two that he used regularly.”
“Okay,” Castiel nods slowly. “I understand, I think. It is much the same in my home—not the protectionism. But a huge number of Angels live within the city. So, you and your father and brother live in the castle itself—does it have any other permanent residents?”
“Yes,” he nods. “I do.”

His head billows with smoke.

“He was just annoyed at being called out for being a dick,” Krissy states. Lena, quiet as ever, continues to watch the group.
“And… and where is ‘here’?” Castiel asks.
It is at these words that Dean’s insides tremble red with frustration.
And it hardly matters now, anyway, whether Dean loves Castiel or not. The Human is doomed, as it seems their affair was from the start. Strange to think of it now, that Castiel and Dean were once betrothed, and to be married. Strange to think that Castiel was willing to forfeit his life as an Angel to live for only a moment, a breath, with Dean. Strange that he’d do so, even now.
“Dean, where are you?”
Is this the beginning of the rest of Dean’s life?

wings. Dean trembles at the sight of them, at the sight of this Angel, at the cold filling the air between them.
“And why’s that?”
The confessions of love come as easy and as naturally as greetings, but never lose their thrill, only grow a sense of underlying steadiness, like the tide, like miles of roots under trees. They both have forgiven each other for all the time it took to say. And now they say it so often they have almost, certainly, made up for it.
And still, he can’t believe it.

“I—um,” he stammers out, “I wanted to tell you how well you sang tonight.”
he grins.
“No, I didn’t,” Castiel shakes his head. “Melancholy is necessary.”
idiot—
Dean nods shortly.
Michael said, voice gentle.
Dean beams.
Castiel nods, wide eyes flitting away from Dean and up at his father, and a moment later hops out the room. He comes back with a big yellow ball. Maybe yellow is his favourite colour.
“I thought you’d decided that you hated war?”
Jack’s eyes flash a heated orange to stay the cold knives of light gleaming from Michael’s fraying vessel, fraying by the second. It’s like watching a star collapse in on itself. Inward and outward force. He smokes and cinders and burns hot ice before, in a moment’s moment, after the agony of seeing oblivion open its arms, he’s wrenched into ash. A bright flash of that divine, angelic, silverblue light thrusts out on every side, launching the sheet of the lake into waves, billowing at the trees from their very trunks, which seem like poppy stems in the wind. Thunder seems to roar around them in applause but there are no clouds about to cause it. And Michael is gone. Another one, gone.
Dean frets.
“You have a lot to offer, too, you know,” he says, dragging his gaze back to the shepherd. It’s a reluctant motion, reluctant with fear, but when his eyes meet Cas’s, he can’t regret it. “If that’s… I don’t know—something that you worry about, too. That who you are or what you have isn’t enough. You shouldn’t. Worry, I mean—you shouldn’t worry. You’re more than everything—you—” he looks down. “Someone is bound to see that,” he murmurs. “Someone
“I thought you’d
“Some people might say, you could stand to wash, too.”
“A mix of sage and mugwort.”
“I’m not sure,” he shakes his head. Opening the front door, and looking out at the sky, he suggests, “walk it? It’s such a nice night.”
Castiel looks down.
e thumps, then kicks the door, even harder. “Please!” He shouts, kicking himself back and looking up, desperate. “Cas!” He shouts—but nothing. Both his hands go to the back of his head in hopelessness. “Please!—Plea—” But his voice cuts out.
“I don’t…” He coughs once. “I kissed another boy tonight, because Dean said he was straight.”

for him.
“Well then,” Dean smiles, waiting for Ellen to finish washing an item so he can resume drying, “I’m glad I started working there.”
“She’s uh…” Dean swallows. “Great. You’re right. Totally. I’ll go for it, like you said,” Dean forces a smile again. It doesn’t nearly reach his now distant eyes. “Why shouldn’t I?” He asks, laughing unconvincingly. “She’s great. Why shouldn’t I?” He repeats. Castiel frowns. Dean looks down, sighs. “She’s great.” He smiles again, shrugging. “And I’ve got no reason

more than one.
“Oh?” the shepherd asks.
And they are huge—
“That’s good,” Jimmy says, gently, nodding. Dean nods, too, head moving to the same pulse as Jimmy’s. “And how is he coping?”
“He is,” Ellen nods. “I’m sorry about his outburst on your first day. He’s been all over the place, which again, isn’t his fault—but it can be quite upsetting. I think he’s yelled at me more times this month than over the rest of his life.”
Eventually Dean pulls himself together enough to leave.
“Then I’m afraid I don’t have an answer for you.”
“He, uh—he said that if I really loved him, I’d—” Cas swallows with a wince. He starts again. “He conflated me leaving for university with me being disloyal, I think,” He nods slowly, still avoiding Dean’s gaze.
But living opposite each other doesn’t explain the words they share, the looks, the touches, the years of history and shared experience, shared sorrow. Fourteen years of
“Ay, he has magic,” Dean shakes his head, face heating, “but there’s no magic can reach someone beyond the grave.”
“It’s nothing,” Dean shakes his head. “You’re family, Cas,” he decides. “We—

“Thank you,” Dean bows his head. “But I fear that this place shall be forever associated with mourning, for me.”

looked down, apparently ashamed.
He blinks out his tears. It’s a relief as they fall from his eyes.
“You say you love him,” Sam sighs, speaking softer, now. He looks steadily at Dean. Dean blushes at the words, and the gaze, of his brother. “Why do you think so little of him?”
“Hands on your lap, Dean,” he instructs, feeling foolishly like a teacher, and Dean seems to spot it too, because he slurs out,
“What?” Castiel frowns.
“Is vagrant farm hand not exactly what you were, save until a few months gone?” Novak asks, innocently. Dean stops. “Mr Singer told me,” he says, to answer Dean’s confusion. “So you may save your explanations. As for your insults, I rather suspect they’ll act as spitting against the wind.”
“Yeah, I guess I am,” he admits. “But I’m not allowed much fun nowadays, so I’ve got to take what I can get. And food is great,” he laughs. “Call it hedonistic. Anyway, training really takes it out of me. If I didn’t eat this much I’d probably be starved.” Dean winks. Castiel smirks because he seriously doubts that, but he doesn’t say anything more.
A stranger to death, Dean is introduced to it when, woken from his dream by the blunt punctuation of Jimmy opening the door suddenly, face blank with shock, Dean can hear the sound of Mary’s tears floating up like rotting debris in the sea from the living room downstairs. Dean is crushed underneath death when, not like a candle blown out but rather carried out by the flames themselves, John Winchester is caught in a home made a furnace in the dead of night. The image branded on his mind: a home not unlike his own was smothered in red tapers licking at the night above it, and John Winchester caught in its midst like a caged bird fluttering in primal panic against the bars. John stops being broad and tall in Dean’s mind, he is a hummingbird, a child. Spindly in rapid motion of blind panic, John runs through a burning building looking for an escape while it collapses around him, spindly he pounds against the walls, spindly he dies in the shriek of fire at night. Dean wonders if he cried. Dean retches. Dean realises John was braver than he, and, in spite of the searing maims John has carved across Dean’s soul, he realises his dad was not a figure Dean could hate, or wish dead. He wants him back and will, he will for long years to come, unable to say his father’s name without the sour taste of burnt and rotten flesh branding his tongue.
Castiel giggles and sticks his tongue out at Gabriel, who returns the gesture.
“Well, as he may or may not have said, I burn cold. That’s why you’re shivering. That’s why your breath is fogging up as it leaves your lungs. It’s all my doing, I’m afraid. It’s unintentional, more than anything else, but there we go.”
It’s like Dean is a sinking boat and Cas’s waters are pouring over him, drowning him, and the skies overhead are stormy but not grey as Dean is used to—they swirl with dark clouds and navy skies, but lightning strikes the sky with silver and white light; illuminating it—and perhaps Dean’s boat
“It’s quite a long poem,” Castiel replies, almost with a laugh, and Dean is tempted to feel affronted, that Castiel would even think to mock or tease him at this confession.
“You flatter me.”
Gabriel grins, mimicking their father’s tone. “Damn, that was a funny conversation. And it proved that for all his talk, he wasn’t
She’d been everything soft in the world. After she died, everything turned brittle and sharp. John turned brittle and sharp, especially. Dean isn’t a cruel, angry person—he knows he acts like it. But since only four years of age, everything has been brittle and sharp, and he had to harden, had to harden himself, or he’d never have made it. Not this far.
“I say it so, because it is,” David smiled. He had something in him like mischief. Wraith-like and as impish as it was divine, as tied to the earth as he made Michael think of the heavens. He was Human, the most Human, a child of the soil, perfect inverse of Michael, child of the air.
“Try.”
generous on the ‘salt’ element of the salted caramel it’s supposed to taste like.
Castiel frowns.
“Yeah,” Dean admits. His chest is beginning to fill with some bitter fluid which tastes of regret.
“I’ll count myself lucky, then.”
happy
“I’m just not sure how to talk to you any more, Dean…”
“See ya later, gorgeous.”
At around midnight he realises the dogs have been left out in the living room and are whining softly at their lack of human companionship. He opens his bedroom door, bleary eyed, and calls them into his room. At least having them lie about him on his bed eases his sense of loneliness a little.
And Castiel swallows thickly, but still his eyes prickle, and he can’t focus on his work, and he spends the rest of the day with the lullabies his dad used to sing him stuck in his head.
“The first night I met you, you might recall the looks he gave me,” Alastair has stepped round the circle of gears and mechanisms of the clock and approaches Dean again, drawing slow and certain and close towards him. “You might recall the looks he gave
“He will, honey,” Ellen smiles, attaching the handle of the metal pail she brought in to the room to a hook above the fireplace, heating the water slowly. “You’ve made him a great deal better, I can already tell.”
needs
“Listen, Jo, Ellen,
“I know, Dean,” Castiel squints, confused. It’s that look, this look in particular that screws Dean’s heart over and makes him swallow thickly, several times. “What’s your point?”
One of the most clearly ingrained memories in Castiel’s mind—which is odd, considering how drunk he was at the time—is the image of him wasted, hopeless, in the passenger seat of this car, having just made out with Samandriel at Charlie’s party, and wishing it was Dean he had made out with, instead. Also desperately wishing that Dean was not straight, Castiel’s thoughts seem to be continuing along a similar vein to that of the eighteen year old who fell out of Dean’s car that night and hit his head on the curb.
“Stop objectifying me,” Cas answers, faking a scowl. “And stop being gross.” Cas puts on a battered tee. “Anyway, it’s midday. I don’t know if Anna’s gonna be around. If

“Whatever. I can still beat you in a fight—and I do, by the way, every time. Even if you were eight feet tall, I’d
“There was some trouble to begin with, undeniably,” Lucifer admits, carelessly turning and examining the expanse city outside the window, below them. His hands rest, like some kind of entitled transgression, on the windowsill. Dean considers, briefly, taking this as his opportunity for attack. But something in the Angel’s wings flickers like an animal in a forest, like in a second he could spin, anticipating Dean’s blow, and finish him. “But I soon won over a band of loyal followers and eventually came to the throne of the Demons. Unsurprisingly, they wanted a route towards—and entry to—the Angels’ Kingdoms. And I wanted my rightful place on the thrones of my ancestors… and so we arranged an attack.”
“It’s Cas—” Ellen tries to say, beaming, but Dean’s groan interrupts her.
Dean smirks over at her.
“Oh—” Bela hesitates, a subtle frown pinching at her beautiful features, “are you and Samandriel—”
Dean corrects himself.
He lets his heart freeze over again. It’s easier. Frozen things don’t bruise so easily.
dad.”
“And I’ll say again that I’m sorry.”
“Dean?” The Angel asks, turning to glance at Dean. Dean tears his eyes away quickly from Castiel’s wings, which is a surprisingly agonising thing for him to do. “May I ask you something?”
Just as he had hoped. He honestly can’t believe his luck; can’t believe how kind the universe has been to him to allow this one pure joy in comparison to a lifetime of sadness and bad luck.
“Bullshit,” Dean snorts, “everything looks good on me.”
“Sure,” Dean smiles. “You had a good time this week, right?”
Dean flushes and looks away.
“Probably a breeze,” the guard replies with a shrug. Dean wants to shout at him in accusation of laziness, but refrains, swallowing his anger down to his feet.
“Big word.”
Castiel waves him off.
“Better yet, I won’t mention you at all,” Dean laughs.
There’s little left in Dean’s lungs, but he still manages to exhale at this.
“It’s fine.” The words grate out, unconvincing even to Dean.
“If you follow our instructions, none in your Kingdom will be hurt,” Crowley sighs as though Dean is being very awkward and slow about the whole ordeal.
specifically, don’t get it. They think it’s something you get over. As if you ever could. But it’s more like losing a limb. Or—or your eyes, or… it’s big, and it’s forever, is what I mean. You live, and—and sometimes it doesn’t feel much like living, or even surviving, or getting by—but you live, and you live
“Never,” Cas nearly growls, squeezing Dean closer. “Read me the next?”
“Don’t—” he shakes his head. “—If you ever felt that I was taking liberties with you, it was only because—I can’t articulate it, but—however you thought that I felt about you, I feel that way—I’m sure of it—I know I’m broken and that what happened with Castiel makes you think—”
Dean’s throat is tight.
Dean shrugs.
“And I could hardly find cause or reason for you
Dean’s right leg has been broken in two places—when he was trampled on by a passing, panicked horse—and his ankle and shin fractured when he fell off of his own. Dean tells Castiel he never brings Impala into battle. He says that because she is a mare, she isn’t as strong as some of the other stallions—but there’s something else. Dean cares about his horse too much to see her killed as so many steeds are in combat.
“And what about you, man?” Dean asks, pulling back.
“He did not mean to—” Michael tried, but his father shook his head.
“No, you’re right,” Sam admits, and Dean is about to feel relief, but he glances over to Sam’s laughing face and sighs, rolling his eyes. “You might be getting married, soon, for all we know.” Sammy reminds.
“…Nearly five hours ago,” Ellen admits. Dean laughs bitterly, again.
There aren’t words, and I keep on asking myself if I should start trying to pay you back for the amount of money you spent—”
He squeezes Dean’s body tight against his own, because he doesn’t know what else to say. His wing slides over Dean’s body, blanketing it, and Dean hums happily, quietly, against the Angel’s chest when the Human lays his head back down.
Jack doesn’t appear to pick up on this, though. He spends most of the film intrigued, head tilted to the side in a manner which tragically reminds Dean of Cas, though he resents it, squinting at the screen.
When he finishes the story Dean hears his voice crack.
“They do,” the messenger confirms. Dean’s eyes graze down his tunic of pale yellow. A thought snags in his mind and sends all others tumbling out of his head.

Dean promises. And makes his way through the barrier. He casts a last glimpse of Cas before climbing onto the train.
And it has been, hasn’t it? A good thing. The best thing. Fifty years of friendship with Castiel, and more to come. An act of building and rebuilding which has equalled healing. A little kingdom built from broken remnants of something lost, once, and then… redeemed. Found lying in a garden with grass growing over it. Weathered by rain and grief and years apart but still good. Burning with purity. Sacred, sacred the hand in Dean’s hand, the other in his hair; sacred the body beside Dean’s body; sacred the sorrow, sacred the joy, sacred the grief, sacred the dancing, sacred the rain at every interval. Castiel has run his story alongside Dean’s, through water, through fire. Dean isn’t as broken as he’d always thought.
He stands at the foot of the house, looking up toward the chimney, with a piece of rabbit in his hand. He calls for Cathy repeatedly, and grows in relief each moment she stays fixed in place. He can feel the tension radiating off Mr Singer and catches the terseness of his muscles in his peripheries every other moment.
But Castiel doesn’t know what he is. He’d even puzzled Lucifer, who looked at Castiel and wondered what he was and where he came from; surely not like their other brothers and sisters.
“I know I’m a mess—I’m trying to be strong—” Dean’s voice rakes against his throat.
“No?” Castiel asks. He presses his lips together. “That’s kind. He’d like that, I’m sure. But you do it for you, Dean. Not for him, or… anyone else. If it helps you process things, then—”
Dean says, and it’s half a joke, unconvinced.
“No, it’s beautiful,” Dean shakes his head. “She must have loved it.”
He can’t get anything right. He can’t protect his brother when he’s supposed to. He wasn’t strong enough or brave enough—or idealistic enough—when he needed to be. He is too easily intimidated, too jealous and scared—Dean is weak and he is a disappointment and simply
Meg snorts.
“Can you, like, go?”

“Deal,” she beamed, shaking the older prince’s hand.
“You spoke to no one?”
“We can leave the war, then?” He asks, his voice shaking. “Effective immediately? We cede nothing—no land, no territories, no money, resources?” It’s too good to be true.
“But you attacked
“I, uh—of course I want you to do this, Cas.” Well, at least that’s the truth. And he avoided answering Cas’s question well enough. What’s three years on fourteen? The difference between best friends and strangers, Dean supposes. “I guess I’m gonna miss you, that’s all.”

Cas starts humming something softly—the words are barely audible, only a mumbled comfort tickling Dean’s skin—maybe it’s in Enochian. He can’t understand it. Cas stops the gentle purring of his voice for a moment, but the presence of his hands still presses reassuringly at Dean’s skin.
“If he’s home for the weekend, it’d be better if we just let him come in,” he sighs. “Otherwise he’ll annoy me
“Find out,” and doesn’t know why he does this, doesn’t know why he wants Castiel to dare, and Castiel brings Dean’s hand to

“It’s probably my favourite room there, too. It has a slightly domed roof, not unlike your library, although ours isn’t made of glass, as yours is.”
“Should we go and read to Mara?” The question comes out way too quickly and way too obviously forced. But

“I’m not,” Cas disagrees. “I really did. Every time, I thought what a good dad you’d be, and how attractive it was. And not just attractive. It always made me love you more. Could only make me love you more.”

“Do you want to stay out here?” He asks. “We could watch the dawn, together.”
Meg. Of course. Pretty much the only person Dean stayed in contact with, after High School,
“I’m sure she is,” he nods, the movement so minute that Dean barely catches it.
“Y’know, Dean, just because dad didn’t understand you, and mom is refusing to—it doesn’t mean that the same will be true for me.”
“Good point,” he assents. The lavender seeds send tendrils of steam to unfurl happily within his lungs. “Tell me more about lavender,” he says, and closes his eyes again, and tips his head back as behind his eyelids, the soft lapping flames in the hearth flicker ruddy and gold.
She’s crying, too.

“What?”
But Bobby ignores him and continues.
“There must be

—that’s all it is!”
Castiel shakes his head but climbs in. Dean goes over to the driver’s side and does the same, closing his door and starting the engine.
“If he cannot die—”
“Of course not,” his eyes almost seem to blaze that angelic silver-blue, at this. But no—now, he seems more human than ever. This ferocity—it’s humanising. Shame flickers at his features, then self-consciousness. “I mean, he clearly knows, the God Book could be lethal to him. But it’s actually fairly useless without Death to read it.”
“That your last name?” Tom raises his eyebrows. Dean nods. Tom smirks. “Is that your way of making sure I can look you up, after tonight?”
“It’s great you two boys get along so well, though, you’ve gotta admit,” Ellen’s face lines with amusement, and it does nothing to extinguish Dean’s embarrassment.
“No,” he says. “Never.”
“Hmm,” Cas hums. “Perhaps your heart is a little hard of hearing.”
“Thanks, Sammy.”
“For what?” Dean laughs breathlessly, pinned against the door.
“That’s…” Castiel rocks back. “That’s a lot to untangle, Dean.”
—        Louise Glück, from “Unpainted Door”
“Then,” Cas says, “then don’t rush into this. Or out of it—whichever,” he says, face worried. “You’re—you’re the love of my life, Dean,”—and Dean starts crying—“I know this is hard, but… please wait. Please just wait for me. I promise you, I promise…” But he doesn’t finish. And the whistle for Dean’s train blows.
Castiel flushes, eyes darting back down to the sign.
He gets into his pyjamas out in the opening so as not to disturb Dean, and brushes his teeth. Then, from inside the tent, he hears a noise, muffled and unclear, but certainly made by Dean. He frowns and makes his way over, unzipping the tent as another sound is made, this one less muffled, and if Castiel didn’t know any better, almost certainly a

Gabriel grins and barks out a single-syllable laugh.
And so it’s sat on her bed, two weeks after his and Cas’s fight, that Dean finally screws up the courage to cut things off. And God, does Lisa cry.
Dean stares.
hello!! good evening!! here's chapter 20!!
“We’re being honest, Mr Winchester,” Aiden laughs. “We really mean it. School days with your classes in were pretty okay.”
Gravity seems to have fled the rest of the world only to crush with particular force on Dean and Castiel in this moment. Dean breathes slowly.
as the cruel Human Princes in the stories Castiel has read, the princes who steal the lovers of better and more honourable men.
“I don’t—!” Dean nearly shouts, then cuts himself off, body jerking as he clenches his fists to regain self control. He looks down, pressing his lips together so tight they're almost invisible. His face is heated, so that his freckles, which Castiel once used to spend all his time examining while he and Dean spoke or laughed together, have disappeared. Dean squeezes his right fist hard, drawing a long breath in, then releases. “I’m only trying to take an interest in you,” Dean looks up at Castiel. His voice comes out charred.
This is it, he realises.
Gabriel snorts.
“Yes. Which is what you’ve been through, maybe all your life, without even realising it.”
“I’ve been,” he swallows, and Castiel recalls how difficult it always was for Dean to open up; how he preferred to be doing things, like walking, or fixing, or building, as he spoke of matters of his heart. “...Uh, kinda…” He worries at his lip, line forming above the bridge of his nose and quaking in a particularly torn way, as if he doesn’t know whether he ought to share the truth, or tell a lie. “You want the honest answer, or the polite one?”
Dean pauses.
And when the evening draws near, they climb back down the ladder and take turns on the new addition to their fort: the tire swing. Sometimes taking turns, sometimes swinging together and bumping heads and giggling, Dean tells Cas the cruddy jokes he’s memorised that day while the dark haired boy tips his head back and laughs, hair whipping in the wind as the swing takes them back and forth, a pendulum against an orange sky.
“What are you, uh, doing some reading?”
with Jimmy. I used to do it. All the time. Or at least a lot more.”

Ellen smiles and laughs.
He—he actually has one.
“—Last night,” Bobby amends, nodding quickly. “But all the same. Your bird has probably died, by now,” Bobby says, and Dean glares at him. “I mean, domesticated all its life, it probably didn’t even know how to hunt. Probably starved.”
And Charlie grows up with a sheepish smile fixed almost constantly to her face. Neither Claire nor Krissy help stem her love of mischief whenever they visit, and the strongest reassurance is that though she’s provided new definition for the word cheeky, she’s also kind, and hilarious.
“Right.”
Dean—what is he asking, right now? Is he
“Well, I also got a dog,” Dean supplies, when Miracle comes over and noses at his hands. Dean fusses at the dog’s ears, bends to press a kiss to the top of its head. He glances back up at Cas. “You’ll love him,” he says, and Castiel can’t tell if it’s an instruction, or a promise. He smiles.
Castiel asks, hopeless.
“Good point,” Dean admitted, smiling at Jo, “but the same applies for servants. I can’t remember

“And I you, Castiel.”
“Thank you for staying, Cas.”
No matter the goodbyes, this love has been forever.
“What, you’re telling me you don’t have sex, now?” Dean asks, still trying to pry himself free from where Castiel has him pinned.
“The hell is this?” Dean frowns at the brimless black hat his mother has pressed into his hands.
Castiel remarks to himself.
“Would you mind me sitting with you?” She asks.
“Just so.”
Dean can’t stop wondering which of these Angels, if any, is the one Dean is supposed to marry.
He inhales. He breathes in deep, through his nose, which all but rests on the shepherd’s knuckles. Winter spices—anise and cloves and cinnamon—and there, there it is, the unfurling, grounding, sleepy yet bright smell of lavender seeds, a smell like the sound of warm wind through grass.
“You haven’t shouted at me like that since…” Adam frowns at the ground, toeing at it uneasily, “…Since we arrived here. Maybe even before…”
“So that was your…” Dean starts awkwardly. Castiel groans internally.

you,” He spits, kicking rain-wetted gravel in his direction in a spray of sooty water and pieces of rock.
What kind of evil could there be, in this boy’s heart, to make his first act but to kill?
“For a time?”
he sounded out the syllables slowly, frowning in concentration, lines appearing on the bridge of his nose as he attempted to pronounce Michael’s name as the Angel himself pronounced it. “Mih-chai-el? Is that right?”
“—I should’ve dug my heels in,” Mary says. “I should’ve made it clear,
“Yes, he’s left that out, every time I’ve complained how much I miss eating chicken.”
“Uh,” the boy takes a tiny step back, frowning. He reaches for his daddy’s shirt. Jimmy slides a hand onto his shoulder. “They’re alright…”
“I doubt it, Sammy. But I’m proud of you. This is big, huh?”
Charlie’s room. Charlie’s room? On the left.
that they speak of Castiel and Dean
“All this waiting,” Dean says.
The shepherd looks, only looks, for a moment. A soft line pinches his brows together and Dean worries in a flash of background fear that he’s placed a foot wrong, that this was the wrong kind of extension of vulnerability.
It’s as though children, siblings, form a picture together, even into adulthood, a picture of their parents and their upbringing, of the meals their mother used to make for them or the stories their father used to tell. And the moment a part of that family dies, the picture is incomplete. Fractured.
cared about me after that!”
Jimmy was a good man. A brilliant man. A man who encouraged Castiel’s eccentricities perhaps a little too far, but apart from that, had done near nothing wrong in all his years on this green earth.
The farmhouse grows bigger as they approach. A few lights—Sam’s, he’s probably reading—and the light from Bobby’s study. After Novak assists him up the steps, Dean pushes open the front door, and they make their way inside.
years—where everything seemed to have gone wrong beyond repair.
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean shakes his head, making his way to the edge of the roof to climb down, like he always does. “Nothing matters… None of it… Go to Cambridge… Leave me, leave, leave… Go…”
“And what would you suggest, Mr Davies?” Bobby asks, affectionate and gruff. Mick answers
“I am glad to see you putting my coat to some good use by dirtying it in a
“Of course,” Castiel replies slowly. “Of course…” He frowns uncertainly at his boyfriend. “Why do you ask?”
Dean rolls his eyes. They sit down to their breakfast.
He doesn’t look behind him. Behind him he can sense the pillars of sunlight that must be making Dean’s soul glint and glimmer, even now, even in the raw bleach light of a place no human was ever meant to tread. The blood and bone of nightmares. Castiel would give anything for Dean not to be here. And yet… to be here with him…
“Are you okay?” He asks, and there’s a clatter, and the sound of someone cursing, and Castiel opens the door slowly, peering through it warily.
He stares at the overpowering black wings, at the brilliant, shimmering blue fading gently onto each feather, as though each dark one of them has had its tip dipped into the brilliant, startling powdered dye from the southern isles that they say are composed of crushed sapphires—
Gabriel asks, turning back to his brother.
The wind barrels down the Georgian street he stands on, at the top of the steps.
“Dancing?” He asks, soft and uncertain and scared and hopeful. Castiel’s mouth twitches in the same motion as his heart. He nods, the gesture so small and so soft it is barely there at all.
“No one has known me better, in some years, now,” Cas says, softly. Dean’s heart twinges.
Cas is casting doleful eyes over to Gabriel.
drawing and crayons and making a mess with paints. He’s as stubborn as Elanor is generous and as the weeks trail into months the two make for the strangest, sweetest duo. Elanor is convinced Jacob is her twin, even though the two of them look nothing alike—inspired, Dean guesses, by Zac and Amelia, who’re now a couple of tweens and therefore
Dean snorts. “Oh? I guess I can imagine.”
“Right,” Castiel nods.
A rainy, empty road, lit only by streetlights that flare at the windows of Dean’s car, setting fire to the water droplets collected on each pane. They flit past the window in a constant, silent, banality. It’s cold in the way only fall seems able to be; Dean’s fingertips and toes are numb, turning white, the rest of him a comfortable enough temperature. It's either the cold, or the weight of loos. It only serves to add to the confusion drenching his insides.
And then Samandriel totally takes Castiel by surprise by kissing his cheek.
“You’re not Castiel,” Dean says. Castiel peeps out from behind his dad’s legs to see Dean frowning up at Gabriel, a little accusingly, brown eyebrows knitted together into a tight frown.
comes to eat a fine, great lunch with everyone at the Eyrie. They’re usually marked by snorts of laughter from Jo, quips every minute from Mick and maybe a ridiculous tale or two, Sam and Cas gently teasing Dean, Bobby getting bored of conversation with people and turning to talk to one of his birds, and Ellen trying desperately to control it all.
His hair is still the same, though—apparently untameable, as it always was—and his eyes still make Dean feel as though the rest of the world doesn’t exist, that there is only him and Castiel, and that Castiel is the most beautiful creature that Dean has ever seen.
“I’m talking about your brother’s mutilating addiction to Demon blood,” Crowley states, carelessly examining a ring on his finger, twisting it round and round the digit it rests on; not unlike the way King John once did with his own ring. The familiarity of the motion has pain and regret spiking through Dean’s heart, despite the anger and confusion already shrouding his emotions. Crowley glances up to see Dean’s still utterly nonplussed expression and sighs in exasperation. “Oh, goodness, you really have
physical—but Cassie was the only one who touched Dean with something that made his heart stammer. Being touched like that—
“They’re warmer already.”
Still, Dean gasps. His eyes burn. His lungs burn. All of him burns.
“So what, I’m looking at the Demon King, right now?” Dean scowls. “Somehow I doubt the Demons would be that eager to accept an Angel as their Sovereign, sorry.”
“There’s more to combat than fighting with swords,” Castiel states, attempting to keep his tone as flat as possible. He toes the gritty, sandy ground of the arena beneath his feet, very conscious of the fact that Dean is goading him, but also of the fact that the leer the Human wears, scrawled across his face, makes something in Castiel’s gut tie itself into tight, unforgiving knots.
She curtsies again and leaves quickly. Dean watches her turn down the corridor. She glances back only once, but it sends something smug coursing through Dean’s system.
“I mean it.”
When he finally arrives at the ward, the baby’s already long here. Sam is crowded onto Eileen’s bed, his awkwardly long legs bent to accommodate this, the little bundle of person swaddled in Eileen’s arms.
Dean shrugs. His eyes return to the road.
It was always part of that bigger promise. I was so afraid of that bigger promise. And I wanted it more than air.” Dean swallows. His hands, a knotted tapestry of need with Castiel’s, squeeze gently. “But now the love is out loud. So are all those promises. Because of you.” He laughs again, the impossibility of faithful disbelief. “So,” he says, “will you watch over me?”
“Shut up.”
“And I know you don’t love me, any more—and I don’t blame you—but a piece of me thinks—
Dean comes to stand in the doorframe of the kitchen. He frowns.
They reach the stream which must have been emitting the sounds of water Castiel heard earlier. Dean chases it upstream, Castiel follows behind, perplexed. Turrets of water bounce off stones and birdsong rings round the trees about them, small finches darting from one branch to another, cocking their heads curiously then flitting away in panic at the Human and the Angel, traipsing through the forest.
“I still don’t understand.”
How could you think I was worth saving, after that?”
“It was but two nights ago,” he says softly. “Give her time. Give
“It can be very charming, in fact.”
“So he
“You said its wing was broken,” Dean repeats, gesturing to the bird. “Looks fine, now.”
“We were—we were—”
Castiel’s face heats.
“Her Majesty, Queen Bela, has called you back to the Great Hall. Discussions are commencing, once more.”
“And I liked seeing you make it,” Castiel hums, watching Dean warmly. “It was generous of you to say it came from both of us, considering the work
“Damn, that’s a reluctant review.”
“That’s, um, very profound,” Castiel muses, “though I’m still not sure I follow.”
“I really am glad you’re okay,” He peers up at his brother, earnestly. “I promise I’m gonna start being a better big brother to you.”
is empty. It reminds Castiel curiously of when he found himself abandoned by Dean, nine years ago. Except now it feels as though the whole Winchester family is in on the same trick, and laughing at him behind muffled glass. The light left on in the living room seems left on more by accident and hurry in leaving, than left on by inhabitation. Castiel frowns uneasily and returns to the door, knocking again. Still nothing. A feather of panic traces itself along the grain of his insides. He looks for the key that was always left under the third flowerpot on the left side of the path to the door; it’s been moved—Castiel wonders if someone forgot to return it, or if Mary keeps it in a new place, now. Either way, it doesn’t help the writer like feel any less of an intruder.
“I…” Dean rasps, obstacles, objections, disintegrating around him. “I…”
“That’s pretty nice timing, Cas,” Dean says, and his husband’s eyes are brighter and more wonderous than grace itself.
“It’s not a problem,” Castiel returns, turning to the fire and placing a few more logs onto it from the basket heaped full of wood beside the fireplace. It sparks angrily, hungry flames lick at the new fuel. “Is he doing alright?” Castiel asks, turning back around to see Ellen leaning over Dean, dabbing the cloth at his forehead, hair and face.
And, like they’re just two friends, again, and not husbands who have long since confessed their love for one another, they softly breathe in each other’s necks and hover, faces close, noses grazing cheekbones and mouths nervous inches apart, waiting for some kind of signal, scared for some kind of signal, foreheads pressed together, lips hovering, breath uneven and mingled, eyes shot with frightened, desperate tears.
“Everything,” Dean replies, so surely and quickly and gently that Castiel looks up at him from where he bends down, rummaging in the glove compartment, and hits his head on the bottom of the dashboard.
to come here. You practically dragged me and Adam out of bed.”
“Oh, come on,” Dean replies playfully. “Where’s your sense of adventure?”
“What’re you doing up here, all alone?” He asks. Castiel smiles at the squeeze Dean’s palms offer his shoulders before finally, properly, slipping away.
for a warm fire to collapse himself in front of. But at shucking his boots off at the door, a lesson which Ellen has now long ingrained into his skull, Jo stepped over him with a basketful of strange, long ruddy-orange berries in her arms, and told him that Bobby wanted to speak with him.
“Now, is that so ridiculous?” Castiel asks, indignant. Dean laughs. Victor and Benny spent all the day in the fields, Sam was with Adam and then Dean and Ellen. Jody was in town, running errands. Jo and Bobby were training the ridiculous goshawk. These are the shepherd’s immediate friends, Dean thought, and

“There’s tomato in this,” Dean gestures to the lasagne dish as he pulls it out of the refrigerator, “you’re telling me I need
“I hope you’re not offended by how strange I find you.”
“I’m eternally grateful,” Cas rolls his eyes. “Come on,” he motions that they head back in the direction of the farmhouse. They begin to walk. “You know,” he says, glancing at Dean with the sun glinting off the dark of his hair, “you could
he replied, cocking his head slightly.
Cas sighs affectionately.
The Demon steps closer—he wears peasant clothing, has greying hair and a rough grey beard; he looks

“A halo.”
Dean shakes his head, “but you’ve picked up mannerisms. I don’t know. Their sense of humour. And some words, and turns of phrase. And some things you really
“You abandoned ship,” Mick grins.
Both of them laughed, and so Gabriel did as well, the sound he made hardly breaking against the waves of noise the older pair emitted, swords thudding dully against each other, feet echoing in the Prince’s chambers against the alabaster stone, window opened, wind whipping through the room, laughter tumbling around it.
Castiel turns back, about to reply and ask
“I played it when you and…”
“Uh,” Dean plays with his hands, wringing them together tight enough so that it hurts. “I don’t know,” he laughs honestly, a little self deprecating. “I guess I should be asking you that, huh?”
Cas sounds pained.
The shepherd Castiel carries the light of the stars, infinite and eternal as they are, in his gaze.
Castiel fidgets uncomfortably.
“I get it,” Dean says again. Silence. Michael’s lip almost,
“That wasn’t fair,” Dean glares. Castiel finds the look oddly endearing.
“It’s so nice, seeing you guys being friends again,” Tamara smiles. “I didn’t—I didn’t realise it, during the wedding—sorry. I don’t think Bela did, either.”
“You could say that…”
of this house, and all the lands surrounding it, she ought to treat her position with him as more open to evaluation than she seems disposed to. He doesn’t, of course. Unused to being a man of any note, let alone a landowner, let alone a landowner with
“Right…” He nods. It sounds pretty much as though Cas’s fear is all on Dean and his past failures, to be honest. “I—that’s fair. I guess—you could call me, when you land? Could you, I mean? I mean—
They could sweep this under the carpet, pretend Cas doesn’t actually feel this way and was just drunk—but Cas isn’t letting go. And the thought of losing Cas as a friend, as well as to England, is numbing Dean with fear. “—I’ve loved you, since—well,” He swallows, “since we first met, I’m sure of it—”
health. Michael adored children, his primary desire is to see this one born into the world, and Ahava being the vessel for that possibility… Well. Michael cared that Ahava might live because he cared that the child might live. It was with strange, prophetic sense that Ahava knew she would not live long after this pregnancy, perhaps that her final act, in death, would be to afford life. Every day she sensed herself dimming in this world, and brightening in the sky. Like she was being called.
Dean snorts.
“I came to Eofor with our family—some—some foolish, blustering event. I hardly remember now, not that it even matters—and his was the first face I saw. Or,” Michael laughs self-consciously, and corrects his romanticism, “the first face I saw which
while you drill me full of holes with questions?”
Castiel presses his lips together and stares at the floor.
anymore. Was some yet more battered, bent, broken, warped and wrong thing. But this guard, he said I looked like her. He knew her. That had to mean something. It meant everything to me, at least.”
“Oh, for sure.”
Dean breathes in for a moment, thinking. The shepherd’s body pulses steady heat against his own while his brain ticks over like a machine cooling down. The night air was cold; Dean’s hands are cold, but he’d quite forgotten it with the warmth of the shepherd against him. Maybe all the strange, folksy herbal crap the guy practices actually does some good—Novak’s circulation must be—
In all honesty, this should be explicit enough for Dean. This should be a signal of
Dean hopes above hope that the Angel is telling the truth.
Cas paced the caverns of Dean’s spirit and still was not repulsed. Saw in it something worth mending, each and every time. Saw in it something worth staying for and then, in the end, leaving for, if only in the hope that Dean could stay. How could Dean be worth all that? He has to try.
“Yes, that one,” Castiel smiles. “Have you read it?”
“Well, I didn’t personally, no,” Lucifer shakes his head. “I don’t
“So—Cas—you’re okay if I call you that? Is it alright?”
They decide to go fishing on Friday.
“Did you mark them?” Alastair asks. “I certainly did.”
The shepherd’s expression shifts again, washes with softness. Like the gentle waves, the gentle waves that lap at soft sands in the coves beneath the cliffs, away from the lash of the Atlantic. The soft waves which were like the dawn, this morning.
“How long were you driving for?” Castiel asks softly. Dean brushes his nose against Cas’s skin for no other reason than the fact that he can, for no other purpose but to relish it. “How long were you looking for me?”
constantly uncertain? One foot on sea, one on shore. Better yet, one foot in America, another in Scotland. And
“Why did he threaten to break up with you?” Dean asks, stomach knotting.
“You’re not socially unaware,” Dean shakes his head disbelievingly. “You—just—you’re different. You don’t care about social conventions in the way most people do. Most people are boring, by the way. You’re not—you’re all… organic. Even if you’re awkward, sometimes. But you’re just thoughtful, and you get lost in your own thoughts, and there’s a difference between that and being socially unaware.”
“Waiting for me?” Dean repeats.
“Cool. Cool, cool,” Samandriel beams. “Well, I’d, uh, better go—but seeing as we have math together, last thing, I guess we can just go to the lockers together, and then head out? How does that sound?”
to help him through all of this; he feels so alone and lost and he is losing more and more of himself every day.
“When?”
“No,” Michael admitted. “But this is what I want.”
“But I want to be of some help,” Castiel answers, before Ellen can protest any further. “Please, let me.”
Dean shouts, voice frayed. “You never listen, Cas, you never listen. I keep tellin’ you, don’t I? Aren’t you listening, now? I’m telling you,
The jade-eyed Human wears minimal amour—he has only been training, after all. Dean isn’t wearing a helmet, nor a breastplate, although he does don a boiled leather shirt, along with a gardbrace and pauldron on one arm. The other is left free, probably for ease of mobility.
“Perhaps we ought to make our way inside?” He asks with a grin. Castiel’s lips twitch upwards involuntarily.
This is the price of daring to hope.
Castiel frowns.
“You said its wing was broken,” Dean looks up, over the cage, to where Bobby stands.
A lot can change in that time—a lot
“She likes you,” Mara says, beaming down at the infant on Dean’s lap, whose enormous eyes are fixed on Dean, fascinated.
“The decay of magic,” Michael shakes his head. “Who can say how strong they are, now, now that Uriel has traced his own magic over them, weakened them further. Missouri is a gifted sorceress, and thankfully so, but…” He sighs, a muscle in his jaw working.
“And?” She raises her eyebrows. “It’s in here. All that you want. I know how God ends.”
“You’re my home, too, Castiel,” the words are said, terrified, but only the edges of them are frayed with worry, only the syllables tremble; there’s a steady firmness of truth at their core that keeps them steady. Castiel stares. Dean swallows, pressing his lips together. Dean takes a step toward the door, and, looking back to Castiel as he is halfway through it, says, “Always have been,” and steps out, alone, into the darkness.
“I’ll get your tea…” She murmurs. Cas eyes the door, left slightly ajar, warily. Anna’s steps sound, retreating back down the stairs. Dean licks his lips and moves to Cas’s drawers, putting down the Tanakh on Cas’s bedside table.
to the boy with green and glittering eyes who lived in the house opposite his for fourteen years, it took Dean all of two months to convince Castiel he was wrong in every possible respect.
but a servant coughing lightly into her closed fist interrupts him. He and his sister turn to face the girl.
“Uh-huh?” Dean doesn’t rise.
“Of course,” Jack smiles. “But maybe we should talk.”
“Pinky swear,” he promises, and wraps his little finger around Cas’s and squeezes, before turning back to the road.
“Nice answer, Rick, but it doesn’t count if I’ve performed one of his songs by way of introducing the topic.”
“Why do you think?” Dean chokes. “Or—I don’t know, I—I felt like something was calling to me.” Silence, for a moment, and only the waters around them. “Maybe it was you,” Dean says. “Maybe it was you.”
“And I missed you,” he replies. Dean’s face heats, although he has no idea why.
“Told you I’d wake someone up.”
Michael hums in thoughtful agreement, his frame taut and awkward for a moment, before receding back into itself.
watches porn, Cassie—”
“Uh—I was—” Castiel fumbles for an answer, other than,
“It wouldn’t be a problem,” she cuts through the man's soft protests. “Really. We eat at about six—you could come over at around five-forty?”
“Anyway, I was talking to Sir Robert, and he said Castiel was the one you’re supposed to become betrothed to. Did you know that?”
Castiel’s voice changes for this character, goes deeper and so mysterious it gives Dean pinpricks all up and down his forearms.
“You won’t like my other answer,” Castiel supplies, and Dean twitches a half-formed, sorrowful smile.
Dean asks.
Dean bumps his shoulder against Castiel’s and walks towards the window, looking out toward the cliffs.
His speech is slurred and slow, the lazy kind of drunk that has given up on just about everything.
“Irish,” Dean says, and the lips twitch, though not in a smile. The stranger’s body moves minutely, only a shift in weight, but it makes the dog at his feet all but
Dean, not the kind of thing you should make fun of him over—”
Gabriel begins clicking again and more papers rustle,
Their father treated both twins equally, showed equal love. But something was tender in his interactions with Michael, something softer, like the boy was a wonder from another world, a wraith, a gift, a blessing, a reminder of fault and shortcoming sent from God Herself. Lucifer could see it, he could tell, he wasn’t sure how. Perhaps it was their father’s way of apologising to Michael for all their mother’s hardness.
“It’s okay to be anxious on your first time,” Dean reassures. “Hold onto the reigns like this,” Dean instructs, folding Cas’s fingers over the leather, admitting to himself for a moment that he loves the excuse to touch Castiel’s hands. “If you want to turn right, tug on the right hand side of the reigns, and the same with left. Pull both sides back and hold them there to stop your horse. That make sense?”
Dean is humbled into quiet.

isn’t imagining things this time: Dean’s lip is absolutely curling, obviously in disgust.
Castiel begins to chuckle.
“I’m very old,” Castiel reminds, voice quiet with the awe of a faithless man made breathless at the sudden inexplicable purity of stained glass. “And with it, very patient.”
“Yeah, a little,” Dean admits with a shrug.
Michael sighs again, rubbing his face with his hands.
Jo and Ellen are happy to see Cas at the Roadhouse, though they don’t seem to have any idea that Dean and Cas have spent the past day and night together, in the most romantic and intimate sense possible. Dean’s gig goes okay, like it usually does, and like he always would Cas gushes about it all the way back to Dean’s apartment, making Dean flush a deep and full heat over his cheeks. Back at Dean’s place, Sam is out, walking the dogs late, Dean guesses. Cas suggests they watch a movie, and so they settle down on the couch. They’re both pretty worn out, though neither one of them acknowledges it, and end up asleep, leaning into each other, heads on shoulders while the movie flickers indistinctly in the background.
He had hoped to take a walk through the forest surrounding Eofor—or a ride, perhaps, on Impala—before the day began, hoping the wind whistling around his ears would wake him and soothe him enough to face seeing the Angels again. But a knock at his door interrupts this particular fantasy.
Dean sobs. “I need to tell you—I never—and if I did—”
Dean steps round the worksurface.
would call it magic, yes, but we don’t really consider it as much.”
“What was he like? As a superior? Was he kind? Was he respectful?”
“Even when I’m better than you, you can stay here,” Dean says. Cas raises his eyebrows.
“A simple thank you would suffice.”
“Your daughter?” Castiel asks. Ellen nods.
skin instead of Cain’s.
His hand wavers with the force cracking Michael apart.
Castiel looks down at his hands. He fiddles with them cautiously.
“I’m sure there is,” he agreed. “But I wouldn’t know about it.”
“Yes, I know,” Castiel nods, although he still sounds and looks apprehensive.
“In theology?” Sonny laughs. “What—don’t tell me your four year old’s a priest in his spare time, on top of everything else.”
skylarks only sing while in flight.
“And you walked into it. Maybe Mike didn’t deserve all the crap you put on him.”
“Excellent,” Michael smiles. “Thank you very much, that’s very kind.”
“Yes.”
Dean nods, although he knows this, too. “And Evadne,” Castiel explains, “which is where I live, is the oldest of all three. Evadne means good. Theia means goddess, and Tyrzah means favourable. Michael is Evandne’s Archangel—Evadne only ever has one—and the Archangel of Evadne is always the ruler over all three kingdoms, too, and of all the Angels.”

“This is our shepherd, Mr Novak,” Bobby steps in, and unlike with Dean and Sam, Alastair doesn’t hold out his hand to Cas.
“Well, if you say so,” Balthazar sits back,
“What did she sing you?” Dean asks quietly. Cas laughs.
“It was,” he says. “And is.”
“Nothing,” Castiel says, quickly, before Bela can say anything else. “Teaching young people—especially something creative, an arts subject like music—is one of the most valuable things you
Dean stirs, like he is going to say something more, but just before he does, John stands to make a speech. Castiel glances to Dean, now rigid and militant, listening to his father address the crowd in the hall.
hear out, Bobby!” Dean exclaims, still trying not to cry. “He betrayed me, he lied to me, the whole time he was lying to me! Do you have any idea how much that hurts? I thought I meant something to him—I thought I was special or worthy of him or just…” Dean trails off and realises that he finally is indeed crying softly. “When I found out none of it was true—when I found out it wasn’t
But the boy’s green eyes crease up at their corners and make Castiel think that at least the boy is being truthful.
“I was a little surprised you picked up, this time,” She admits. Dean's expression goes all self-deprecating and he looks away. “Would you have, if you’d known it was me?” She asks. Dean looks back at her.
“You don’t believe I’m clever enough.”

“No, I know what you meant. I’ve heard it from the lips of countless people—countless
Castiel huffs out a frustrated breath and rubs his face with the palm of his hand.
Castiel asks. He watches a glimmer hope flit into his brother’s eyes.
“I would have come back, eventually. I owed you an apology, too. What else will you do, when you’re King?” Castiel asks.
Castiel finds Dean a book he thinks Dean will like when they visit the library.
“I know,” Castiel says.
Dean tries not to think on how much he likes it.
“Yes,” Castiel nods slowly, looking down at the table with a frown. He cracks a smile. “And I was angry, for a long time, which marred my perception of you,” Dean grows hot and his heart begins to twitch and twinge nervously, “and you were grieving, which meant you weren’t quite yourself, but…”

“Shut up, Jack,” Claire rolls her eyes. “And Kaia, whose side are you on? I’m you

loved Castiel, hardly able to say the name of anyone else when in the presence of the quiet little boy with dark hair from the big white house opposite his; the snarky, bookish teenage boy with intense, bright eyes and indie clothing; the messy-haired, stubbled man with pale pink lips and the kindest heart, the roughest voice, Dean’s ever had the joy of encountering.
“And just the same, Mr Chambers would be glad to know that his daughter was under your care.”
“It’s just so strange for me to see people with

“Maybe that’s the point,” Sam says, softly. “No one left to help, no one but us.”
“How long?” Dean asks. He looks up at Castiel with trembling seriousness. Something new is in his eyes, akin to hunger.

“Why?”
Dean’s face in the kitchen light, Jimmy’s face looking down at him, love and expectation and—and whatever it must feel like, to take a small, scared and sacred child into your home and watch them flourish. Light pebbling across Jimmy’s face. Convening churning tides of people and Dean’s hand tight in his own for fear of it slipping, just like it was, stood in the kitchen all those years ago.
Dean’s brother stares at the ground. His hands are shaking in the same way that Dean’s do whenever he is nervous, whenever he is terrified and can no longer contain himself, nor his emotions. Sam swallows hard, attempting to quell the tears pressing at his eyes. Dean’s gut twists as he thinks of how similar he and his brother are. Of how Sammy is all he has left.
“You kissed me,” Castiel laughs, breathless, “and I—I’m sorry—I should confess, I kissed you back—I never wanted it to end,” he laughs again, chest clearing and now feeling like it’s turning into a vacuum with all the air being expelled from it, frustrated and endeared and forever enamoured, Castiel continues, “I never wanted it to end, but you were drunk, and I—part of me couldn’t believe you, still,” he confesses, “and I’m sorry—”
“And I call you Sunflower, because of William Blake,” Dean points out.

Dean grits his teeth.
“And I don’t know if you’ve realised this—but I’m not usually one to smile—or laugh.”

“And you find that you belong, here?”

“Aoveae grew old and waited for her love to return to her, for the summer where the sun shone so bright the sky seemed to crush to earth. But the lover never returned. When Aoveae died, alone and aged and afraid, Abra scattered her dust and ashes into the night sky, where come each evening, the Great Angel could become a part of her lover, once more. It is in this way that the two were reunited when day met night and dusk fell. Aoveae, though now no longer part of this world, was a part of the next—and was made one with her lover whenever darkness shrouded the earth from the heavens. The wait for nightfall was nothing compared to what Aoveae had once faced: a lifetime without her love, and so happiness embraced the pair and wrapped them up in wings of shimmering yellow.

“And perhaps you can make me breakfast.”
Cas pulls the car over outside a diner that looks just the right amount of trashy and turns to Dean.
Okay, so maybe that isn’t quite true; maybe Dean likes to graze his eyes over the muscled, slim torsos of his teammates after football practice, maybe he admires Dr Sexy M.D. a little
“You know her?” Ellen asks, eyebrows raised. Dean shakes his head.
“Why do I get the feeling that you’re mocking me?”
“Well… I was on Saturday? Anyway—Lisa must’ve seen me going upstairs, ‘cause she followed in after me—”
“Hello boys,” his voice is rough, although not in the gravelly, warm way Castiel’s voice once sounded to Dean’s ears—and it holds none of the Angel’s comfort. A loose, cool smile is playing across his lips as he speaks. On instinct Dean balls one of his hands into a fist. His nails leave harsh, crescent shaped indentations onto his palm. Perhaps it’s the Demon’s careless manner, or the way in which he appears to be taking full advantage of the fact that Dean and those with him are not in a position to reply in such an informal manner. “It’s a pleasure to be able to meet you at last, I
Castiel smiles as wide as his mouth will allow.
“They still come as a shock.”
“You’d never have to,” Benny says softly. He shakes his head. His grey gaze seems to twine through the falling ash. “You’d never have to,” he repeats. “I always would.”

The King looked aghast.

“I could send you some books, if you want.”
“You’re back,” Dean says, chest tightening, chest swelling, breath turning to dust.
“Yeah?”
I am SO SORRY this took so long. I've been having a major shitstorm at uni and my mum just moved home which sucked & was sad so I had to head down to London to help her out. Anyway. Cambridge is fun but kinda balancing fun with being, like, fucking chaotic. I'm in a play though! And auditioned for another today but it went kinda shit. Anyway, I thought I'd just update you all on how it's going.
he nodded his head, humbly. The High King placed Castiel softly onto the ground and began to walk slowly so that the little Angel could keep up with them, tiny hand clinging at the edge of their father’s dark cloak. The King looked down at Castel with affection.
“Yes, him—David—have you exchanged ensignets of betrothal, yet? Or is that yet to come?”
The doctor straightens up.
“It’s my
If Castiel plays it right in his head, he could pretend that Dean is proud of Castiel,
“I guess you and Mr Winchester managed to stay buddies all this time,” Aiden states, with no idea of how much of a loaded conversation this is.
“Cas—it’s—it’s really you—” he staggers out again and staggers toward the angel, wrenches fearful arms around him and yes, the frame beneath them is solid, a steady physicality of existence and not of wishing, only dreaming. Cas’s arms come to, tentatively, cradle Dean’s body back. Dean can barely breathe.

“Me too,” Castiel replies, throat tearing. “He was a great father.”

“As it is,” the dark haired man continues coolly, the ghost of a leer creeping across his features and quiet amusement sliding across his pitch black eyes “I’ve been instructed to make you feel as at home as possible.”
“You guys,” Michael has appeared at the door, rubbing his eyes sleepily. When he brings his palms back to his sides Castiel can make out how bloodshot is irises are, and winces on instinct. “I get that it’s only nine PM… But—
When he enters, Castiel is sat, brow set heavily, at the table, carving something. The light of the fire plashes orange across his delicate, petulant features. Madra sits at his feet, and her growl at the sudden intrusion turns into a happy expression as she recognises Dean and approaches amiably. But Castiel doesn’t look up. He continues his whittling.
Dean mouths the word on the cover, single and simple and bright as the sun. Bright as Dean.
“Um—” Dean starts, turning back to Castiel and taking him by surprise, making him jolt slightly in his seat. “—Sorry,” Dean stumbles over his words. “Well, now for two things—for making you jump, I mean—and for earlier. The fight, that is—which is kind of the big thing. I’m sorry. I was rude and I behaved like an ass—I kind of do, in general, but I really try not to—I really do—I know it might not seem like it—but I definitely didn’t want
“Clearly.”
“—I’m forty three,” Dean grumbles. “And married—”
“Bi panic, then,” Sam amends, raising his hands. “Whichever. Both. Either. I’m the one you’ll complain to when you’re three drinks in, I’m the one you’ll turn to as you say,
Dean doesn’t realise that he has slammed his open palm onto the wood of the table. He glances down at it, noting the dull throbbing sensation that now prickles through him, then flicks his gaze back up at Anna. She doesn’t look afraid. She looks almost
Sam chuckles, shaking his head.
“Why not?!”
While Michael fawned over the newborn boy just as he had once fawned over Anna when she was an infant, only with even

Dean’s stomach clamps.
“Cas,” Dean sighs. His heart is breaking and Cas, of course, is talking about a goddamn
“You were dating that lovely girl—Louise?—”
This time, Castiel’s face is the one to heat. He changes the subject quickly, words stammered.

“What gave it away?” Dean looks up, dead-eyed, to his brother. Sam’s lips are pressed together sadly.
is John. “This is your fault! All of it’s your fault! Get out—get away from me—get—get—” he can’t breathe. Every moment, every movement he anticipates attack, expects someone to break his ribs and someone else to break his nose and someone else to slam his head against a wall, and men to taunt and jeer and threaten to give Dean exactly what he wants in ways he doesn’t want, his lungs are burning, he thinks his lip has split in panic and he thinks of his lip splitting beneath the kicks and punches of angry, ugly men.

Opening the kitchen door with his foot, both hands carrying a plate, he catches himself in the mirror that lines the hallway. Red, swollen eyes greet him, sunken into his face, somehow seeming more dead than Jimmy’s must look, right now. The thought makes Dean retch.
