Cas frowns for a moment. “Do that again.”
“Do what?”
“Neither has he,” Eileen pointed out. “You can figure it out together. You can do this. Just be honest.”
He smiles sheepishly, finding the smaller pad.
I roll my eyes at him before starting to dig through the drawers. “Excuse me if a full-grown naked man standing in the bathroom makes me a little uncomfortable.”
I smile a little. “I don’t hate it. You, on the other hand…”
A small sound from the direction of the library startles them both, and Dean frowns, reaching for a gun stashed under the table, where it always was. Cas frowns, following him cautiously towards the movement, and when they reach the room they both freeze at the large frame standing between the shelves. The figure stops too, shock and relief playing on his face, but doesn’t make a move towards them.
“Alright. It sounds like he’s trying to dissociate a little to remove himself from the situation. You have to bring him back, but you have to be gentle with him and stay calm. If you freak out you’ll stress him out more.”
He nods. “So that’s why you have it on under there.”
“No. I can’t,” he insists. “I have to be here. I have to know if he’s okay.”
Sam nods. “I’m glad. I’m just going to finish cleaning up those gashes and patch you up. Don’t worry; it shouldn’t be nearly as bad as before. Just try to relax.” Cas nods, occasionally hissing in pain as Sam cleans his wounds, but for the most part his fear seems to have passed.
Another man turns towards them, catching Dean’s eye. He glances between him and Cas for a moment before frowning. “Is that one of your brothers?”
Benny shrugs, taking three plates out of the cabinet and starting to put food on them. “You’re right, I didn’t have to. But I wanted to. You were right about one thing, Cas. I do love him. But not the same way you do. I didn’t help you just because he asked me to. I came because Dean loves you, and that’s good enough for me. He cares about you, and so do I.” He pauses, setting the plates down on the table before taking his seat again. “Besides,” he smiles, “You asked me to hold your hand. How could I say no to that?”
He holds his hands up defensively. “Hey, your brother is a big boy. He wouldn’t let me do anything to him he didn’t like. He’s just less concerned with your macho man image than you.”
I shush him softly, smoothing a hand through his hair. “It’s okay, Gabriel fixed it. You had a rough day. Here.” I hold out the painkillers and glass of water on the table, and he takes them gratefully.
Hey guys! Here's another chapter for you! Hope you enjoy!
“He was a loser,” Dean cuts in.
"I know," he answers, softer. "And Cas is mine. But this ceremony is meant to be only between them. Believe me, you won't want an audience either when it's our turn. That's what the wedding is for."
This love that they share, this life that they’re sharing, it’s something that Dean isn’t even sure he wants anymore. He doesn’t want it if it’s not with Cas, so Dean tries to give them some space, he tries to avoid them when they’re being all couply or when he knows both of them are together or both are even in the bunker at the same time. He spends a lot of his time in his room or the ‘Dean Cave,’ sometimes he’ll take Baby out for a drive, to nowhere in particular, but just to get away, to clear his head.
Slowly, he started to move his lips against Cas’, he felt so nervous.
“Someone who actually gives a shit about our sons, unlike you apparently.”
“I… I don’t understand. How- what’s happening?”
Slowly, Castiel pressed himself inside Dean until he bottomed out. Fuck, he was so tight, he thought as he let Dean adjust to the change, waiting till he was ready. He didn’t exactly have to hear Dean say so when he was, he could really just tell because soon, Dean was the one who was moving, trying his best to move back and forth on Cas’ dick rather impatiently. That’s when Castiel’s hands both locked onto Dean’s hips. Holding them in place as he snapped his hips forwards in one swift motion, causing a loud moan to slip from Dean.
“Fuck-” Dean gasped loudly. This feeling was new, it wasn’t unpleasant, but it was foregin. His body didn’t know how to react to it.
Dean paused before he made his way fully out of the library, glancing back at Cas who was looking at him questioningly.
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas said softly, turning away to go who knows where.
Opening the door to the room, he turned on the lights before walking in further. He just left the door open, maybe partly because he wanted to know when Dean was done with his shower.
Hello, everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed the last chapter! Que the rest of the breakout! Let’s get Cas back to his hunter!
“Yes. Every last one of us.”
“Hurt Dean how?
Okay, yup, he was. Before Dean’s brain could even finish that line of thought, Castiel was leaning back down, but not towards Dean’s face this time. No, he was going to clean up his mess and he was going to fucking enjoy it.
“Yes, I think I remember the way. Goodbye Rowena and thank you. For everything.”
That shut Dean up quite quickly.
Before he could, however, Cas had turned around, muttering something about somewhere he needed to be before he was completely out the door, not waiting for a reply from Dean.
“No, I-”
“I- I love you, Cas,” Dean murmured, his nose bumping against Cas’ nose and then he closed his eyes. As Dean leaned forward Cas’ breath caught in his throat and then their lips crashed together, finally. It took 12 years, but finally, it happened.
“Okay, but will it be hard? There’s quite a few pieces in there.”
“Dean,” Cas said quietly, scared that if he spoke too loud that he’d startle Dean and scare him away.
Cas got a faint smile on his face at the memory of the man he had met while living on the streets. He hadn’t known him for long, about a week at most, but it was interesting to him how something so small could bring a person such joy.
“C- Cas, I-” Dean stuttered out, completely surprised by the angel's sudden appearance in the room. “What the hell are you doing back?” he yelled out before he was actually able to contain himself.
Cas stretched his arms out slightly with the coat, giving Dean one of his annoyed faces, but all Dean can think about is how adorable he looks like that. He couldn’t help but smile a little at how concerned his angel was for him. He knows he’s not technically an angel anymore, but to him, he’d always be his angel.
“Okay, I guess Dean’s been acting a bit different than he normally does, but it’s fine, Sam. If he wants to talk then he can. He knows we’re both here for him, so if he’s not ready I’m not going to push him. I don’t see how that’s ever done any good.”
“Yes, I did. Are you really going to tell me that you would’ve
Cas wasn’t laughing though, his face remained the same as he leaned in closer, his lips just grazing Dean’s ear.
Sam tries his best to help Dean. He tries to bring him food during the day, in hopes that if it’s there, he’ll eat it. Sometimes he does, but it’s a rare occurrence if he finishes it. He encourages him to get out of the bunker, go for a walk or for a drive, just to get him out. He needs fresh air, and not to be holed up for days on end in the bunker.
“Okay…” Dean finally said. “I should, uh, get back to sleep. Got a long day ahead of us.”
“Umm Dean… there’s uh- look,” Cas looks up towards the ceiling in the hallway.
“Goodnight,” Castiel replied.
On occasion, he’d hear him and Sam talking or catch a glimpse of him in the hallway or hear him rummaging around one of the spare rooms that he had claimed for the time being.
Dean couldn’t deny that Cas had a point, maybe several points, but he didn’t actually have to say that out loud.
“You sure? You don’t seem sure…”
He headed to Mary’s heaven hoping that Jack was finished there, he needed to speak with Mary alone. He knocked on the door to the house when he got there, waiting for an answer. The door swung open only a few seconds later. A warm smile greeting him when she saw that it was him.
“Whatever…” Dean muttered under his breath, finally turning around and walking in the opposite direction to start on the symbols.
“So, you not only made my children think it was shameful for them to love whoever they wanted,
“Well, let’s get to work then, shouldn’t take too long between the two of us. I’ll start over there,” Dean said as he started walking back a few meters in the direction that they came to get started on the Anasazi symbols.
“Come on, Dean,” Sam said, cutting him off, “I’m not an idiot. I know that you two felt something for each other… do you forget how many times I had to sit there with you two making googly eyes at each other?”
“He may not actually be human, but he sure is a hell of a lot more human than you. At least he actually gives a damn about our sons, about his family. At least he actually cares. He’s done more for Dean in these past few years than either of us have in his whole life.”
If Dean was being honest, this was really hurting his brain.
After dinner came dessert, the part they were all quite excited for.
“Dean… you know that’s not true. You’re worth so much more than that.”
He just laid in bed for a few minutes, imagining what could happen, how it could feel to have Cas inside of him, to becoming a whimpering mess at the hands of an angel. These thoughts wouldn’t leave his head.
“You sure it didn’t have something to do with you calling him a bear?” Sam laughed out.
It didn’t take him long to figure out a plan. Well, not really a plan per se, really just an idea. One that he intended to follow through with only a few days later. He had meant to think it through at least a bit more, but his impatience was getting the better of him, taking over until one day he just couldn’t continue to make the awkward small talk with Cas anymore and needed to just
I sigh softly, shaking my head. “No, of course not. I just…are you sure this is what you want?”
I take his other hand, realizing how hard he’s trembling. “It’s alright,” I assure him. “We’re here. You’re safe. Just calm down, okay? We’re not going anywhere.” The angel nods again, trying to quiet himself, but still small whimpers escape him with each breath.
He grins, cuddling closer. “Forever is a long time, you know.”
“But...what if I chose to stay human?” Cas asked, barely over a whisper.
“What color?”
“Agreed,” Sam hums. “But he definitely noticed. Do you really think he might just be...okay with it?”
He frowns. “I just…want to make sure. I don’t want you to feel like you have to agree to this to keep seeing me, because you don’t. I’m interested in you, Cas, not just having sex with you.”
Benny nods thoughtfully. “Getting back on the horse, huh? Fair enough. But give it two more weeks. You want the skin over them to be a little thicker for that. And if you do it, try to stay away from the more scarred areas for now. But as long as you’re careful, I don’t think it’ll be a problem.” He pauses, looking Cas over for a minute. “Are you sure you’re okay with that?”
I nod. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for things to get so out of control.” I pause, looking up at him. “How did you know I was down there? What happened?”
I pout at him. “Are you telling me that you went to a sex shop without me?”
Thanks for reading!
“You gotta make sure the burners’ not too hot. It’s best to have it on medium-low heat so it doesn’t curl and it’ll also be easier to make sure it doesn’t burn.”
In the end, it was just Rusty and Dean, no Castiel in sight. All those years Dean and Castiel had known each other and Rusty was finally the one to nail him. Rusty had gotten more contact with Dean than Castiel ever did, they finally got to nail the hunter. It took years but it finally happened.
“What?” Dean finally huffed out.
Feeling defeated, and by something so little as a phone charger, Cas sank down to sit at the table, trying to think of where on Earth he last left it.
He knew that voice, he’d recognize that voice anywhere. It was a voice he could never forget, even if he tried.
Immediately, Dean was on his feet. He didn’t even know that he could move this fast anymore. All he was thinking was that Cas was there, Cas was so close, and if he didn’t hurry the angel might just disappear into thin air. He needed to hurry, needed to see his angel right damn now. Dean needed to see his angel with his own two eyes, he had to help him, find a way to help him, no matter how badly he was hurt, he was going to help him.
“You hadn’t
“Whatever you say. You are the meat man after all…”
“Hey, uh, Cas?” Dean asked slowly. Cas just hummed in response as he turned his attention to Dean and away from whatever he was doing.
Cas. He did it so Cas didn’t die for nothing, he knew Cas would have wanted him to continue living, to keep doing what was right and for him to be happy and alive.
“Why don’t you sit here tonight? While I sleep.” Dean said this before actually thinking it over in his head. The words seemed to surprise him a little, and they also seemed to surprise Cas.
“I see. Anything interesting?’
Dean swallows his mouthful of eggs, grabbing the ketchup bottle and sliding it over to Jack, “Come on kid, don’t listen to Sammy. He has no idea what he’s talking about.”
“Cas… what the hell is that?"
“Dean… I may be immune to feeling cold, but I know what temperatures humans begin to feel cold. The time of year, along with the now setting sun is usually something that would affect a human, especially one that is not properly dressed for it I might add.”
Dean was confused for a moment and then horror spread across his face as his eyes widened, realizing what exactly Cas had meant by that.
His last thought was that
“The movie ended a little while ago and Jack wanted to go play with his bunny before he and Sam started to make dinner. Sam went with him. They didn’t want to wake you, and neither did I. You looked very peaceful.”
"I'm fine, Dean," was all he said before his gaze shifted to the window on their right. Dean thought he was done before the smile turned into a small smirk. “And besides, technically I wasn’t in your ass, just touching it.”
A chuckle escaped both Mary and Bobby at that comment before Cas continued.
He asked as he handed it to Dean to squirt some on his fingers. Dean did this without thinking. He didn’t have a chance to think about what Cas was going to do next, because as soon as he was done, Cas leaned down, and put his mouth right next to Dean’s ear.
The last parts of the song played and then Dean got up abruptly, walking quickly over to the cassette player and hitting the stop button.
Ha well, who would've thought Dean could actually use his words, I certainly did not, but here we go.
Cas had been so preoccupied with his thoughts that he hadn’t even realized that the car had stopped moving. It took a few minutes of Dean just staring at him, and then when he still hadn’t snapped out of it, Dean tried to say his name to get his attention. When even that didn’t work, Dean had to actually grab onto his arm and shake it to finally snap Cas out of his thoughts.
The last few days had been a whirlwind of emotions. It still didn’t seem fully real to Dean, at some points he was sure he’d wake up and realize this was all a dream. He knew it probably wasn’t good to be thinking like that but he couldn’t help it. Good things never lasted, there always seemed to be a catch. Some fucked up condition to his happiness. That’s how it had always been.
“Hey, Claire,” Dean breathed out, his voice a little shaky. Cas stood up then, moving closer to Dean to try and better hear their conversation.
“Nah, she’s been doing some research for a friend of hers. I was gonna go help her out so I’ll just take this to the library to eat. You two have fun though,” Sam winked, before grabbing two plates and heading into the hallway.
“Thanks for staying.”
It was a picture that he hadn’t seen before, at least not one that Dean had shown him, but he remembered the time it happened, it would’ve been hard to forget it if he was being honest.
All he could think about was the angel, about how close he stood next to Dean, how he could feel his breath on the back of his neck, the way their arms brushed against one another while walking or even just the intense way that he’d watch Dean. Sometimes he’d look away quickly, but other times he wouldn’t even blink, he’d just hold Dean’s gaze until Dean’s thoughts took over and he had to look away, it almost felt as if Cas was daring him to look away, to break the eye contact.
There it was again. It was Dean, his Dean. Why was he hearing Dean? What was going on? Why did he sound so broken?
“I guess in retrospect it wasn’t really.”
“Well, that and she seemed pretty adamant on engaging in intercourse with me. I think that’s when I really started to figure things out.”
“Okay, cool.”
“You woke him up, Sam.” Cas deadpanned as if that explained everything, but when it came to Dean, it really did.
“I have no idea,” Cas replied, sounding just as confused.
Cas had been walking down the hallway of the bunker one night, it was late and everyone else had gone to bed already, so he was trying to find something to do.
Cas went to turn away back to his brothers and sisters when Jack spoke up once more.
This love that made him reckless at times, made him close up and push away the people that he cared about, that he loved. Dean was a proud man and a man who would rather push people away when things got tough than deal with it, than share his most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, than admit his wrongdoings. He would rather ignore the pain or any possibility of not being loved in return.
“Dean, calm down, please. I swear it’s really me. Ask- ask me anything, please. Let me prove it to you.”
“Yes, don’t worry, I will. I expect that you’ll do the same.”
“Merry Christmas, Dean,” said Cas, with his lips still pressed lightly against Dean’s.
“He’s not-”
Mary followed suit, choosing the sofa adjacent to Bobby and Cas sitting down on the other end of the sofa, turning so he could face both of them.
“It went well,” Cas replied simply, sitting down on the opposite side of the table of Dean and placing his phone in front of him.
Nobody else could know this loss he felt because Cas wasn’t even his to lose. Not truly his. Dean didn’t know Cas could even feel love, like the kind of love where you fall so deeply and so hard that there’s nothing else. There’s only that person, that person who you would do anything for. You’d die for them, kill for them, risk everything in the world just for them.
“Cas, I don’t need you to protect me.”
, wanted to see Dean like that again, in a position that left next to nothing to the imagination.
“Not to be rude, but I think it might be best if we discuss this alone.”
Thanks for reading!!
“It’s just after 8:00, you were asleep for over an hour.”
“I didn’t actually decide this on my own.”
Dean slaps a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Come on, Cas. You know I could never replace you…” Dean’s smile was easy and light. Cas would’ve almost believed him to be joking if it weren’t for the hollow look in his eyes as he spoke and the way his hand lingered for just a few moments too long.
Sam sat there in the silence of the night for a few more minutes, he didn’t want to go back inside yet. Then he heard a rustle coming from one of the bushes. Instantly he was on high alert, it could be just a deer, but then again, how often was it ‘just a deer’. He rose to his feet, trying to be as silent as he could, squinting his eyes to see if he could catch a glimpse of whatever it was in the moonlight.
“Yeah, but you don’t know-”
Cas gave him a wary look, his eyes narrowing at the hunter a little, before dropping it.
He didn’t have a plan, all he knew was that there was no way he was getting out alone this time, he didn’t think it was enough for him to just annoy a cosmic being until it let him go like last time. He would need something bigger than just him. Cas knew he needed help so he did the only thing he could think of, something he had done once before when he was here, he called out. He would call out to the other residents of the empty, call out to his brothers and sisters, he would call out to any being there that could hear him or until he made himself heard.
He was able to dismiss these thoughts though when he tried to give it back to him, and Dean told him it was meant for him to keep. It was a gift. It was only meant for him.
Cas walked over to the desk, turning on the lamp and then opening the top drawer. Inside he kept one of his favourite things. It was the mixtape that Dean had made him a few years ago. Next to it laid an old walkman he used to listen to the tape sometimes.
Dean looked back at Cas’ face and cut him off, grabbing at his tie and pulling him forward. He wasn’t going to do that awkward dance around it this time, might as well get it over with as quickly as he could.
“I think we can both see that I very clearly am,” Cas stated. “What do you want, Dean?” he asked, his voice softening just a little.
Walking towards his room, he didn’t hear any noise; no voices, no footsteps, so shuffling around. Nothing. It was completely silent apart from the odd creak from the old bunker.
did Cas even manage to wake up in the Empty this time? He hadn’t thought to ask before, but now that he was thinking it over, he remembered that when angels or demons died, they went into an eternal sleep, one that he has heard is very unpleasant.
“Jack.”
“I would if you both would just be quiet,” Dean argued, deciding it was worth it to sacrifice one of his pillows by throwing it in Cas’ direction. Even half-asleep, his aim was pretty damn near perfect, and, if Cas wasn’t a fucking angel with perfect reflexes, it would’ve hit him square in the face, but instead, Cas just caught it like the perfect son of a bitch he is. Dean just sighed, giving up and rolling back over.
When Cas finds him, Dean is in the middle of eating a sandwich at the kitchen table.
“So, how have you been?” She cut in before he could get in another word.
to spend eternity with him? That you would’ve been happy or in peace?”
Dean just nodded, the ability to form words no longer something he was capable of.
Also the prompt for this fic, well let's just say it had to do with the map table and Sam seeing something he never should see. Oops.
He was covered in sweat, his pants...oh fuck… they were all sticky and warm on the inside. It all came flooding back.
useless.
“Yes, a pillow,” Cas sighed. “And I’m blaming you since you’re the one who woke him.”
Dean almost choked on air, not expecting that from Cas at all, but still not complaining.
After breakfast, they decided it would be a good time to exchange gifts. They went to the library, which had been completely transformed into what Dean had described as “looking like a Christmas parade threw up in there” and he wasn’t wrong, as Sam had even agreed with him.
The memory that sticks with him the most though, well that was the last memory he had of Cas. Right before Cas had been taken from him, taken forever. Cas was taken because he sacrificed himself to save Dean. Dean. The righteous man. The man he loved.
The two of them stayed in relative silence for the majority of the time. It wasn’t awkward though, it was pleasant, calming even. Both of them just enjoying having the other nearby. Cas stood near Dean for most of the time, just watching as he cooked. Occasionally, Dean would ask Cas to grab him something or to pass him something that was on the other side of him.
His breath caught in his throat, forgetting how to breathe and then, he sat up, sliding to the edge of the table once more, bringing his body into contact with Castiel’s.
. So much so, that he even had a few dreams about it, ones that ended in him actually storming into Cas’ room and having his way with him.
Sam was the one who made the rest of the calls. Although there weren’t many to make, Dean was still grateful for it. Dean was never able to say to himself that Cas was dead, much less to another person, not then. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t.
He stayed there for a moment, his back turned to the angel. Cas saw Dean’s shoulders shake. Cas wasn’t sure if he should speak up or if he should just leave.
Voices, that's what he heard. All around him, muffled, not allowing him to hear what they were really saying, but they seemed important, familiar even. He wanted so desperately to know what they were saying. Louder and louder they grew until his hands were covering his ears in pain. Then, suddenly, it all stopped. Everything was quiet, almost eerily so, not a sound to be heard.
Once it was all mixed together, Dean grabbed the bowl and poured the egg mixture into the large pan on the stove. He and Cas checked the bacon once again, and he told Cas to flip it once more, saying it should be done in just a few more minutes.
“Okay, okay…” Dean rolled his eyes.
Cas had decided he had enough of this. He removed his mouth from Dean and smirked a little when Dean made a noise of disapproval. Dean would not be disappointed for long though as Castiel had plans for him.
“Okay, well I gotta go now. Talk to you later.”
Cas did his best to explain everything to Balthazar, starting with the deal he made to save Jack. He was hoping that he might understand and that he would help.
“I got you something, it’s nothing much, but you could open it now if you like.”
“Wait, what?”
These little pieces that Cas had left behind weren’t enough. Maybe all together it seemed like something, but it wasn’t much at all, not for Dean. The only thing that would be enough for Dean was having Cas there and getting to hold him in his arms.
“Fine. But I want a better life than this, a place to live, proper food, maybe some money too.”
Before Dean could even register what Cas had said, Cas had turned around and went to go help Jack and Sam with the tree and the rest of the decorations.
Sam tried to play it off. He kind of did promise her that he’d stop worrying so much, it really wasn’t good for him, but he just needed to hear it from Dean this time, just once and then he could take a breath.
Dean was laying in bed, getting a little worried. The sound of Sam’s soft snores provided him with some background noise as he tried to fall asleep, but he couldn’t. His brain wouldn’t stop thinking and overthinking everything. The dreams, the feeling of Cas standing only inches behind him, his breath ghosting on his neck, how close his face had been to his earlier that day when he crashed into him. They were so close. Their bodies were pressed against one another, similar to how it had been in his dreams. He could still remember the heat radiating off the angel’s body, the way his cheeks had gotten a slight pink tinge to them before he had flown away. Just as he was thinking about that, he heard a noise. A whoosh and he felt a sudden change in the air. His breath caught in his throat. He knew exactly what that meant. Cas was back.
“It’s nothing, Cas. Don’t worry about it.”
Anyway, I'll see you all in two weeks with another update which I'm terrified for because of an idea I'm being forced to include but it's fine... maybe...
They decided to take advantage of this, of their missed opportunities, and make sure that Jack didn’t miss out on the things that they did. Jack was especially excited about the idea of a real Christmas, with a tree and all, seeing as this was going to be his first real Christmas. They wanted him to remember it, they wanted him to feel loved and part of the family, because, after all, he was.
Then, peeling off the grimy clothes, he turned on the water, feeling the coolness of it warm as he reached out a hand and let it flow through his fingers. Once it had warmed enough, Dean stepped inside to wash away the day.
“Yeah okay, I get it, but Meg was human once… and she was a woman…”
Once the girl let go of Cas, she turned back to her parents, excitedly showing them what he had given her. They smiled at him, mouthing a silent thank you before walking to where everyone else was now gathered so they could begin to head out.
Dean killed another bug that had been trying to suck his blood.
“Yes. I thought I raised you better than this… but I guess I was wrong.” John looked away from Dean, almost as if he was physically unable to keep his eyes on his son.
“I can
“What do you want from me, Dean?”
It felt like it took them days to gather a large enough group of angels, but time seemed to pass differently here and it was hard to keep track so he couldn’t be certain of how long it really took. Each angel they chose, they had to think about and consider carefully. They needed to be smart about this if it was going to work, and if it did work and they made it back to Earth, then they couldn’t have just any angel running around. Cas knows he was playing God here yet again, but after all the damage he has caused to heaven and Earth already, he had no other choice. He needed to be careful and if this was the only way to find his way back to Dean, he had to do it while trying to play it as safe as possible.
Cas sighed and leaned forward, his elbows resting on either side of his own plate and his hands folded under his chin.
Cas released his tight hold on him then, stepping back, but leaving one hand on his shoulder as he gazed at his son for possibly the last time.
Cas only nodded, his mouth hanging ajar.
“Ahh,” Dean interrupted from near the stove. “So, that’s why you were both up later than normal then… Makes sense now.”
“Well that’s certainly one hell of a plan now isn’t it. Sounds almost a little too simple.”
They both let out a simultaneous groan, both finally getting what they had been craving from the other.
Cas walked towards him, moving into the small room, not really sure about what Dean was talking about but then when he saw it, his eyes went wide. He really wasn’t sure exactly how- okay, no, that’s not true. He was fairly certain he knew how it happened, he was just a little foggy on
“You shut your face,” Dean said instantly, pointing one finger at Sam.
Cas was the one who shifted uncomfortably now. If it hadn’t actually been Dean and he mentioned the sketchbooks then Dean would certainly like to know more about them and Cas was still quite shy about the drawings, more specifically some of the subjects in the drawings.
“Just, come here.”
“Nah, I’m fine,” Dean said, shoving his hands into his pockets, which didn’t help his case.
Dean wrapped his hand around the hand that Cas held the whisk in, and instructed Cas to hold the bowl with his other hand.
The line was silent for a few moments before Claire answered. She was probably trying to process it all.
, and no that means that it was not any ordinary underwear, he was wearing-
“FBI. Stop what you’re doing, step away from the body.”
“I was at home, reading. I was reading your dad’s journal, so I can help on hunts. I saw a picture of a house here. He writes how it burned down and he wanted to kill whatever that set the fire. I just wanted to see your childhood home. We don’t have a normal family, but maybe I can try to be whatever was left there. Before I knew it, I teleported here.”
“Dean Winchester? This is Emily Prentiss from the Lawrence Kansas police department. I have Jack here, he’s been arrested. We need you to come down as soon as possible.”
“They who?”
“Dean I told you. You don’t just run in guns blazing all the time. We almost cost that girl her life.”
“Why don’t we all calm down and we can explain what happened.” Rossi tried.
“Hey Jack, we’re on the way home now. Anything that can wait till then?”
Outside the interrogation room, Dean started shouting at the agents, “I told you not to stress him out. Do you know how dangerous he could be?”
“Yes. They are my parents and they just want the best for me.”
Dean looked outside the station, seeing a few police cars parked parallel to the station, cops pointing their guns at them. The shoot out was going to happen, even if they wanted it or not.
“Got it.” The phone goes off and Derek had to stop himself from slamming it down on the table.
“Jack! No one is here now. We’re safe here.”
“I don’t know. But it burned when he put it in. It got burned out fast though, I woke up and he was hitting me. You told me never to hurt humans and I didn’t. He didn’t feel supernatural. He’s a normal human so I didn’t fight back. It was an accident. He did it to so many other people, I just wanted him to stop.” Jack’s hands started shaking, he rubbed his hands together.
Each of the photos was professionally taken, like the IDs Sam and Dean has in the car. They were all people in their early 20s, men and women with brown hair and blue eyes.
The FBI agent came closer and holstered his weapon to cuff him. Bringing Jack out of the building and into a police car.
“I’ll get Garcia to run a full background check on this guy.” Derek said as he took out his phone, it rang once before it got picked up, “Hey baby girl.”
Jack shouted “No we’re not! They’re here! They don’t want to die. They can’t move on.”
Back at the precinct, Jack sat in the practically empty room, handcuffed to the table.
They needed a breakthrough. They knew the first names of his caretakers now but they needed more.
“I know they want the best for you, but experiencing things is what helps kids learn. What else did they say you can’t do?”
“Can you tell me which contact is your dad?”
The adrenaline leaving their bodies shaking, putting their guns away, everyone got back to work, cleaning up the mess from the shoot out.
“This is the all-knowing, almighty Garcia, How can I help you?”
“Dean, you can’t work like that.”
Everyone nodded as Emily went to the interview room with a small cup of coffee. Spencer and Derek went to observe the interaction.
“I know you won’t let that happen. We can continue training. You just need time to get the hang of it. I believe you can do it, Jack. We’ll go back home and we can continue.”
Jack visibly perked up, “You’d let me have coffee? My dad always said coffee was bad for me.”
“Do you know your last name?”
“Jack, I agree, we don’t have a normal family. We’re so far from normal, but a family nonetheless.”
“The bad man.”
“I work how I want to work. How I work, save people.”
Emily tried to get Jack to calm down but no matter what she said, he couldn’t calm down. His trembling got worse and it felt like the whole room was shaking with him. A loud ringing started echoing through the room. The hanging lights started swinging, the table started shaking. Emily lost her balance, holding onto the wall for support.
Sam nodded as he signed for the agents to leave the room with him.
No one could explain what had happened but everyone had ideas in their minds. Maybe the supernatural was real after all.
Dean’s eyebrows raised, “What’s he in for?”
Emily left and went back into the observation room. They got some information, but they needed a little more to prove anything. Emily called Garcia and told her to search for a Kelly Kline who died during childbirth.
“No. I don’t need to eat. Thank you.”
“Morgan, Emily and I will head to the precinct and start the interrogation, Reid and Rossi stick here and take a look around. Find out who our vic is.”
After their little talk, the rest of the drive went by a lot better than the beginning. The awkward tension was gone at least and was replaced by something else instead. A warm feeling. They didn’t talk much for the rest of the drive, but it was fine. It was a content silence and they talked when they wanted to, keeping the conversion light after that. Dean explained to Cas a bit more about the case and they decided that they’d get a quick lay of the land when they got there and get Dean something to eat while they did a bit more research. They’d go check out the newest crime scene in the morning.
It had been difficult enough to control himself when Dean was right in front of him, nearly impossible if he was being honest, but somehow he managed, that was until now. Now he was completely exhausted with keeping himself in check and he just needed to fucking let go and do whatever his, well… not his brain, wanted to do.
“You gonna mess up my panties, Cas?” Dean asked, his voice absolutely wrecked. “Just imagine how fucking good they’re gonna look with your come leaking onto them.”
“But were they really mistakes, Cas? I mean sure, things got bad, really bad sometimes because of our decisions, but in the end, we figured it out. We always figured it out, we found a way. I know it was never perfect, but sometimes… it just seemed to work out. Some of the things that happened, the experiences we had, the people we met or saved because of it, I think could have made it worth it.”
Unsure of what to do, Castiel just stood beside him for a few moments, knowing that he didn’t like seeing Dean in pain, but also knowing that waking Dean wasn’t usually a good idea.
“Alright,” Cas murmured, giving the guinea pig one last soft glance before looking back at Dean. “Guess we should get going then. Did you find everything?’
“Who the fuck would have my phone, I
Cas hadn’t noticed the call log immediately. It took him about two days to really pay attention to it and when he did, when he finally noticed he had a voicemail on his phone, he got nervous. He didn’t know for certain who left him a voicemail, but he also saw that no one had been calling him beside Dean so really the only logical answer was that it was from Dean. He had no idea what it said or how long it was. It really could’ve just been accidental and been only silence. He really had no idea, yet when he first noticed it, he was stuck staring at the phone for what felt like hours, just thinking. Maybe he shouldn’t listen to it, but then again, maybe he should. What if it was important?
There was a softness to Cas’ voice that wasn’t normally there, but every so often he found himself speaking in that way, often when it happened, it was with Dean.
“Is everything okay?” Claire asked.
“What time is it even? How long was I out?”
Cas didn’t want to go back yet, he knew that. Cas had wanted to wait until the situation in heaven was figured out. He didn’t want to have to see the Winchester’s, only to leave so soon afterwards, to be gone in heaven for days, maybe even weeks. Jack could also sense that Cas was nervous about something, he couldn’t quite figure it out before, but now he knew why. It was about how he left Dean, about what he had said to Dean before the Empty took him away. He must’ve been nervous about seeing him after that, probably thinking he would never see him again after that kind of confession. He probably thought that Dean didn’t reciprocate, didn’t love him in the same way, but oh was he so very wrong.
“I’ll see you when you get back.” She spoke, her voice going soft, and off she and Bobby both went, walking away, leaving Castiel alone with John.
“Dean…” Cas spoke quietly.
Dean looked a little guilty from the question, but didn’t admit to anything, not yet, he wanted to be sure what Cas was talking about.
Dean stumbled over his words, his voice sounding absolutely wrecked, but Cas seemed satisfied with his response, if the smirk on his face was anything to go by.
Clearing his throat, Dean tries to shake off this nervous feeling that had consumed him.
The air was thick, no one dared to speak. Through the pauses in David’s speech, the only sound that was heard was the shaky breaths escaping past his lips.
Cas furrowed his brows. It wasn’t like Claire to be this vocal about her concerns for someone, especially Dean. Sure, she cared about the people in her life, she cared quite a lot, she just didn’t always show it or make it so blatant.
For the rest of the case, that dream was all he could think about. It was all Cas, everything he thought about somehow related to Cas and worked its way back to that dream. He couldn’t get the angel out of his head. It’s all he could think about.
“But do you?” Sam shot out, maybe a bit too harshly. “I mean we’ve both seen him grieving but this… this was a whole other thing.”
“Now, don’t tell me that you two didn’t work things out. I will come back to Earth just knock you both on your arses if I have to.”
Dean knows he should talk to someone about what happened. Anyone. He knows Sam would listen, that he probably wouldn’t be surprised by how they both felt. Sam knew him better than anyone, they had grown up together, knew things about each other that they’d probably rather not ever know.
Dean took Cas’ silence as a go ahead, so he leaned back into Cas, lips meeting his halfway. Cas took a few steps forward, causing Dean to have to take a few steps back, until his back hit the door. Dean was trapped, pressed up between his door and Cas’ body.
“I mean, you’re right. I did omit the reason why I woke up on purpose.”
Cas looked at him suspiciously, not seeming convinced, “This isn’t because of earlier is it, because we kissed?”
Sam set down the stack of homemade Rice Krispie treats next to the pie on the table. He clapped his left hand on Dean’s shoulder, looking at his brother. “Okay, Dean, make a wish.”
“Here, just take what you need and leave the rest on the bed. I’ll be in there,” Dean spoke, pointing towards the small bathroom and grabbing his bag of toiletries as he did so.
talk properly, even if Dean felt like it since there was so much distance between them at the moment, but either way, the silence had begun to get more than a little unnerving.
Dean’s thumb pressed down on his phone and it started to ring.
“God I’m glad you guys finally figured your mutual pining shit out, but really? You couldn’t have, oh I don’t know, gone into your room, Dean?”
“Why don’t you grab a bowl and some milk, okay? I’ll find a spatula, a whisk, and another pan.”
“You alright there?” he asked quietly.
Dean and Jack went to the library to wait as Sam and Cas were in the kitchen grabbing whatever they had made for Dean.
“I’m sorry, Castiel, but you boys can be so stubborn sometimes! Even when I was alive, I could see something was there, the way you counted down to the single second how long Dean was gone when he and Sam were taken by the government, the way you two looked at each other when we first met, when you thought he was dead. There were moments where it was so clear, the connection you two have, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”
No. He needed to stop that train of thought. That really wouldn’t do him any good. He needs to stop and clear his head and apparently sitting here with his own thoughts was not going to do much so, not feeling like sitting around the bunker any longer, Dean got up, heading towards the stairs to the bunker door. It was quite abrupt, causing him to startle Cas out of his book, who was sitting in one of the more comfy chairs a ways away from Dean.
A flash of red caught Cas’s attention as he continued to walk closer to them both. Refocusing his gaze back to Dean, his waist specifically, he quickly noticed that the red
Jack smiled warmly at the angel.
That seemed to have caught Cas off guard, because he leaned forward once more with a deep sigh, his chin resting on the palm of his hand.
“Alright.” He heard Cas reply, just as he was slipping into the bathroom.
John looked repulsed by this.
Dean tries to not shut himself off from Sam and Eileen completely, he knows that they’re worried and he knows that Sam was grieving too. Sam lost Cas and Jack too. He tried to be there, just be present, just so Sam still knows he has Dean, that he didn’t lose his whole family. But this is still hard for Dean and sometimes it’s too much for him to be around them when they’re together.
“It’s okay Dean. It’s going to be okay. Just open the door.”
. Dean’s underwear was
“Dean, I uh, I just-”
Dean couldn’t speak, maybe it was because of Rusty and the blood loss or maybe it was from the shock of seeing the angel. Rusty couldn’t be completely sure, but he decided that it might be a bit of both.
Cas starts to say something, but it gets all fuzzy and blurry and-
Dean was holding his breath, he mind was moving a mile a minute, trying to come up with any explanation.
“Please what? What do you want Dean?”
Cas decided Dean had had enough then, and grabbed hold of the waistband and removed both his sweatpants and underwear in one fluid motion, socks coming off with them. He flung it all to the ground, not caring where it landed.
“Of course I did. How could I not?” Cas’s voice was quiet, sad even. He had noticed it all his first morning back, he’d probably been too distracted and too happy to be back at first to notice it all.
“I-I’m sorry about what happened, if there were any way for me to change what I did-”
“Yes,” Cas replies.
He shakes his head. “No. No, it was a good dream. It was a dream about…flying.” Slowly, the understanding dawns on me, and I pull him closer. “It’s not that I don’t love being here with you,” he says quickly.
A brief, amused smile flashes across his face, though I don’t know what’s funny. “Yeah,” he says, “But I have this problem where I never do what I should. Besides, you haven’t screwed up my life half as much as Dean has.” Dean makes a small sound of protest as I stare at Sam, bewildered. He sighs. “Look Cas, I don’t hate you. I’ve never hated you. You’ve made some mistakes, but we all have. You’re family.”
Sam laughs. “Go have fun. We’ll see you when you get back.”
I frown, looking up at him. “Resentful of me? Why? I’ve never even heard of him before.”
I snort, imagining the absolute shitstorm Sam is going to pull when all of the ads he sees are for butt plugs and cock rings. “Baby, we’ve gotta get you your own computer before Sam kills me.” I hug him closer, kissing his temple softly. “Back to research, I guess.”
Dean laughs. “Nothing. You were just staring at me. What’s up?”
“N-Nothing Castiel!” Dean answers quickly.
He shakes his head. “No, it’s…I’m glad you’re here. Just...wasn’t expecting to see you, that’s all.”
Cas grins. “I think it was just sinful enough. And I’m not sorry at all.”
He realizes Dean’s intentions just a moment too late to stop the small gasp that escapes him when the mostly-forgotten plug buzzes to life. It may not be large, but it sits perfectly, and Cas flushes as he squirms slightly. “You are trying to kill him,” Benny chuckles.
Dean smiles. “Good. And yeah, just for a minute at the end. You’ll be a little sore later, once it wears off a little. But you did so good. Honestly, I was worried I’d freak you out.”
“Bye, Cas.”
Cas still looks a bit nervous so Dean leans forward once again, placing his hand on the other man’s cheek and leaning in to kiss him again. This seemed to loosen him up a little.
“Hi, Cas,” she spoke. “Sorry, I missed you last night. I was out on a hunt and only got back early this morning.”
Cas looked so defeated and from something so small as cooking breakfast.
“I mean, like how have neither of us known this about each other? You’re my best friend and I just- I never ever thought-” Dean cut himself off, another question coming to mind. “Wait… so what about Meg then?”
Then, “I love you too, Dean. I always have.”
Dean pushed back the covers from his body, shivering as the cold air hit his exposed skin. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, standing up, and walking towards his dresser to take out a shirt, pulling it over his head. Then, he grabbed his robe and put it on, content with the barrier it provided from the cold air around him.
“But-but why did you have to investigate? It’s not your responsibility.”
“Just let me know if you can’t find it and I can get it for you.”
“C-Cas… fuck, I-“
Rusty was brought back to reality once he heard another noise. It was the clowns. They were back. The clowns did not look happy, not one bit. Rusty started to worry.
“Dean…” Cas’ voice was low and deep. “I know you well enough by now to know when something’s wrong.”
Cas smirked, loving the way Dean was crumbling beneath his touch. “Since you asked so nicely…”
Dean sighed, walking over to the big tub of dog food they had, taking the scoop and filling it up before walking over to the food dish and pouring it in. Miracle happily began chowing down the moment Dean had stood up fully again and walked back to the tub of food to put away the scoop.
“Yes, you will, Dean. You need to start eating better. We’re concerned.”
“Dean. Look at me.” He spoke, firmly, yet comfortingly. “It’s not real. None of this is real. You need to wake up.”
“Dean,” Cas spoke softly as he leaned closer to the man. He had been watching that whole little exchange unfold and didn’t understand a word of it, only that Dean clearly didn’t want to talk about something that Sam clearly did.
Jack nodded his head.
“Shut up Sam,” Dean said as he got up to go find some honey for Jack, eyeing Cas as he went.
I frown. “Those are words that never start anything good. What’s wrong?”
I smile, pulling him into my lap. “You know I don’t mind, Dean. It’s natural, especially with a newly-formed bond. I want to have you close too. It translates this way because my Grace is…dominant, in a way. Your soul wants to be under my protection.”
“A few,” I admit. “I think it might be related to the mating process.”
He laughs loudly, his fingers running lightly through my hair. “I think that’s a little bit different, but you certainly look like you’ve been well and truly fucked.”
I make a face at him while I find my underwear. “Wouldn’t you like to know.” He laughs, following me into the kitchen and motioning to the covered tray on the table. I lift the cover, momentarily shocked. “Pie?” I ask. He nods. “Cas, you made me pie?”
Cas smiles, pulling back the covers and tucking them around Dean’s shoulders. “A couple of hours. You should try to rest. It’s probably best if you’re not already drunk when we get down there. You’ll want the privilege of getting properly sloshed after you meet them.”
Dean grins back. “Alright then. Let’s go see if we can find them.” He tugs at the leash again, pulling him down the walkway to the end, where a large white door sits beside long panels of mirrors. When he opens it, Cas is surprised at how much brighter it is than downstairs, and from this side the mirrors are windows that show the scene below. Four couples are seated around a low table, and they smile when Dean walks in. As soon as the door shuts the noise from downstairs fades almost completely, and Cas relaxes slightly in the quiet, recognizing Benny as he stands up to greet them.
Dean snorts. “I can honestly say you’re the first one I’ve ever tried with.” He smirks. “Why, did it work?”
That was the wrong thing to say. I watch the anger rise up in Dean. “You were concerned?” he growls. “Concerned? Really? Were you not concerned when the apocalypse was going on? How about when Lucifer was walking around? Where were you then? People were looking for guidance, for help, and you were just letting the world burn because it didn’t concern you? What about when Cas was being tortured? You didn’t seem concerned then!”
Her eyebrows shot up at the question. “What do you mean?”
He frowns, raising an eyebrow at me. “Of course he does, Cas,” he says softly. “We both care about you, human or not. And you know we’ve all made just as many mistakes as you. He would never stop loving you because of something like that.”
He shakes his head hard. “No, I’m fine. Better than fine. God, I love you.” He closes his eyes again, his arms wrapped tight around me as he takes a breath. “So we’re mated now?” he asks finally.
I feel his grin in the light kiss he presses against my neck. “As you wish.”
“Uptight?” Dean suggests. “Stuffy? No fun?”
He chuckles, pressing hot, open-mouthed kisses over my skin. “Yes, Dean?”
“Well…maybe I could help,” the human suggests. “I mean, if you want.”
“I can do that,” I agree. “And the last one?”
When he managed to drag his eyes up from the comforter, the surprise on the angel’s face was starting to melt into a grin. “I’m honored that you felt you could tell me that,” he murmured, taking Dean’s hand gently. “You know, just because that’s the category you feel you fall into, it doesn’t mean you have to identify yourself that way to other people, if you’re not comfortable.”
“What happened to Castiel, master of patience?” he grins, sighing as I kiss behind his ear.
The moment my hand touches skin a strange warmth starts to travel up my arm, and Cas gasps softly, looking up at me. "I love you," he murmurs. I try to respond, and I think I just manage it before the lightning hits. It's like flames licking through my veins, and everything besides the contact point dissolves. I don't think I could move my hand from his chest if I wanted to, and at the moment it's the only solid thing, so I wouldn't even think about letting go. I feel strangely out of breath as I hold tightly to him, unable to hear anything beyond the blood rushing in my ears. It's both terrifying and incredible, and then it's quiet.
“Benny, I don’t want you putting yourself in danger because of me,” Cas says. “You said he was involved in some dark stuff. Besides, if we tried to put him in jail, they’d think Dean did this to me. I can’t risk that.”
“Goddammit Cas, if you don’t tell us what the hell is going on right now…” Dean starts angrily. I cut him off before he can scare the poor guy away.
“Cas was telling me about your big rescue...thanks for bringing him back. I missed the little weirdo.”
Dean shrugged, kissing him softly. “I love you,” he murmured. He took a deep, steadying breath, then shifted to tug at his own belt. Cas’ eyes widened slightly as he watched Dean shove his own clothes off before meeting his gaze, an edge of nerves in their dark green pools. “I want you to do something for me.”
“Then I will be with you in heaven.”
“I know we discussed it, and that you said it’s something you’d try, but I also know it makes you nervous. So it’s up to you this time.”
The corners of Cas’ mouth twitched up slightly, and he considered the swirling grace for a moment. “No,” he murmured under his breath.
Cas looks to Dean, who frowns. “What are you going to do, hire a hitman to kill him?”
He grins. “I suspect you’ll become better acquainted with them soon. And I do know how to drive, Dean.”
“But you love me.”
He looks up at me again. “They remember you.”
Eventually they both drifted off, and when Dean woke up his bed was empty. For a moment he panicked, but then he spotted the note on his nightstand:
“Yes. Winchester, in case you were wondering. Gabriel is friends with my brother, Sam. He said you had a problem that he thought I could help you with. I guess he was right. He let me in, by the way. I didn’t break into your apartment.”
By the time they made it upstairs, they were both giggling like children, tripping over each other’s feet and pushing the bedroom door closed behind them. Dean grinned, his fingers slipping beneath the fabric of Cas’ shirt as he tugged him into a kiss. Cas hummed happily as Dean stroked his hip, pressing closer. Though Dean was still working through his issues, he’d grown much more comfortable touching and being touched, and the two of them were no strangers to making out like teenagers. Cas never minded indulging him, always let Dean lead, and never pushed beyond whatever lines Dean drew, no matter how many times he changed them. The knowledge that he was in control did wonders for Dean’s confidence, and he found it far easier to try things now that he was sure nothing would happen than he wasn’t okay with. There was really only one remaining line they hadn’t yet crossed, and Dean had been too worried that he might panic and ruin things to try. Now though, with his family safe and happy under one roof again, and the ring on his left hand, a reminder that Cas, who’d seen his absolute worst, still felt he was worthy of love, there was something brave and giddy bubbling in Dean’s chest, and he didn’t want to let it go. He squeezed Cas’ hip gently, then decided his future husband had far too many clothes on, tugging the shirt over Cas’ head and grinning as the fabric broke their kiss for a moment. Cas chuckled, following Dean’s prodding until the backs of his knees hit the bed, then sat down, scooting himself back to make room. Dean hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath, pulling his own shirt off and throwing a leg over Cas’, effectively straddling his lap. Cas raised an eyebrow, letting his hands settle lightly at Dean’s hips. “What’s gotten into you?”
“A little,” I shrug. “It wasn’t so bad. Why? Are you really thinking about getting one?” He doesn’t answer, but his eyes travel to my shoulder, tracing his handprint lightly. “Now that one hurt like a bitch,” I tease.
Hello all! I'm back with a new chapter. I'll be done with finals after this week, and I'm working on finishing up some old stories, so hopefully I'll have more time to devote to this one and a few others. Enjoy!
“Well, is there anything you definitely don’t want?”
“Probably waiting to make a grand entrance,” he snorts. He nods to another man. “Michael is doing his absolute best to ignore us.”
I swallow, nodding. “Okay.” He reaches out, stroking me slowly before wrapping his lips around the head. I groan, gasping as he moans around me. “Cas…baby…”
The former angel’s face fell as the realization dawned on him, and he flushed red, staring down at the blankets. “I apologize, Dean,” he said quickly. “I just thought...since I’d never see you again, I could finally tell you, and not worry about...how much it would hurt to know you didn’t feel the same way...I never expected you to try to save me. I suppose that...makes things awkward now...”
“I’m not cleaning that up. Just FYI,” Dean cuts in.
Cas looked around at their small group, surprise taking over his expression for a moment. “So you...you didn’t need my help defeating Chuck...but you still came to get me?” he asked softly.
"Alright then. It's fine. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. Besides, I wanted to show you what you mean to me. What better way then giving you what you need?"
“You do that a lot, don’t you?” he says, as if the thought never occurred to him. “I’m okay. Thank you for asking.”
I take a deep breath, feeling that strange, warm sensation spread through me at the feeling of the harness around my chest. “I think that’s good...not too tight.”
Hesitantly, he nods, his eyes slipping closed as I motion Sam farther away. “What’s wrong with him?” I murmur. “I’ve never seen him do this before.”
“Of course it’s supposed to happen,” Dean insists. “Why would it happen if it wasn’t supposed to?”
I'm really pleased with this one! I love all of your comments so much, so if you enjoyed it too let me know!
“I don’t know,” the angel says. “But it’s…different.”
“Oh, Sam and Gabriel popped in. They’re going somewhere for the weekend, so it’s just us. Sam wanted to make sure you were alright before they left.”
Cas smiled, kissing him softly. “I have something for you.” He reached back into the drawer, pulling out another flag, this one with pink, purple and blue stripes. “It’s yours,” Cas explained. “I thought you might want one someday, and they were having a two-for-one sale...”
With that he gathers his things and shows himself out, leaving Cas to watch Dean’s slow breaths. It’s a couple of hours before he stirs, groaning softly. “Dean?” Cas murmurs, smoothing his hair back. The response is muffled into the pillow as Dean buries himself further, and Cas chuckles. “Come on, you have to eat something. If you don’t cooperate I’ll make Benny come back and drag you out of here.”
I pause for a moment, watching him. “We?” I repeat. “Are you trying to tell me that you…”
“He reminds me of Sammy,” I admit, starting on bacon and eggs. “And he looked so lost. There’s not really anything as vulnerable as a powerless angel having a panic attack.” I hesitate. “He…is a kid, right? Or the angel equivalent?”
I shake my head. “I thought I was still hearing you.” I hesitate. “So? Are you going to…?”
“Most of it,” Dean answered absently, flipping another worn, time-yellowed page, his eyes darting quickly along the lines.
It’s been almost a week since we completed the mating process, and they still haven’t gone away, but I can’t say I’m really disappointed about that. They’re really not so bad now that I can control them, and there’s something deeply intimate about how they interact with Cas’ that I can't resist, even if I won’t admit to enjoying it.
The angel shakes his head, pressing two fingers to Sam’s forehead for a moment. “I have no idea,” he answers. “But I don’t see anything suspicious. Whoever did it put you back together correctly.”
Sam laughed, though it came out slightly hysterical. “Literally anywhere that doesn’t involve you, the angel, and the biggest box of lube I’ve ever seen. My name’s not on that box, this one’s on you.” He dashed out the door, leaving Dean glaring after him.
Cas smiles, and Dean runs a hand through his hair softly as he points around the table. “This is Meg and her partner Ruby,” he says, gesturing towards a dark-haired woman and a blonde girl who also kneels, wearing an outfit that, as far as Cas can tell, consists primarily of thin gold chains that link her wrists, ankles, and the clamps attached to her nipples.
He considers it for a moment. “Mm…four days,” he answers finally. “And you promised you wouldn’t freak out. Dean, it’s okay. We took good care of you.”
Dean grins at him. “Met God, became a Guardian, and got a promotion, all before breakfast. I’d say this is going to be a good day.”
Dean snorted, handing a plate to Ben before taking his own slice, settling on the couch with them. “Well, I’ll be here from now on, so he won’t have to worry about her attitude again.”
Castiel looks down, suddenly interested in the carpet. “I only came to answer your call,” he murmurs softly. “If you are no longer in need of me, I will go.”
“You know,” he says softly, “I believe he really did love you.” I give him a doubtful look, and he shrugs. “Look at how you deal with emotional distress, Dean. You lash out. You push people away. You’ve always been uncomfortable talking about your feelings with other people. That doesn’t mean you don’t care about them. And where did you learn to do that?”
Now this is a game I can play. “I want your cock, Sir,” I manage almost evenly, whining and squirming as he continues his task. “I want to feel it inside me, filling me up. Want you to take me, fuck me hard like the good little slut I am.” A choked sound escapes him, the tips of his ears going pink as he starts rapidly losing the battle for control. It’s turning me on at least as much as it’s turning him on, and I start talking faster. “Please Sir, take me…claim me…need your cock…Please…” The last half comes out as more of a whimper, but it works, and Cas grabs for the bottle of lube again as the last bead pops free. He prepares himself quickly, and I gasp as two of his fingers enter me roughly, spreading apart for a moment before they withdraw. “
Cas stares at me for a while before the understand dawns on him. “This is about you,” he says softly. “You still don’t believe I could be happy with you.” I don’t answer, looking away from him. He stays quiet for a little while before standing up. I flinch, sure he’s angry until a gentle hand settles on my shoulder. “Go take a shower, Dean.”
“Hey Cas. How are you feeling?”
“Well, he said he was attacked by demons, but that his wounds were made with an Angel Blade.”
I shrug. “I’m going in either way.” He nods, dropping back to cover me as I cautiously step inside. The building is eerily empty, so much so that the dust on the floor looks like it hasn’t been disturbed in decades. We scope out the entire place without any sign of Cas, or anyone else for that matter. I curse under my breath, but Sam nudges my shoulder, nodding towards a spot on the floor. Kneeling down to inspect it, I find a small seam in between the floor tiles. Feeling around a little more I find a latch that opens a hidden door onto a staircase. “Now that’s more like it,” I mutter, picking up the flashlight and carefully heading down. It’s much darker here, the space filled with what looks like oversized cages, all of which seem empty. “What the hell, Sammy?” He just shrugs. We both jump, whirling around at the light jingling of chains from behind us.
Sam sighs. “Dean…look, I know you’re upset. He’s my friend too, but until he comes back down I’m not seeing a lot of options for us.”
Cas shakes his head. “I won’t be back together until I know Karael is gone. I have to, Dean.”
“I’m not a hundred percent yet,” he admitted. “But I’m getting there. Better than I’ve felt in years.”
He hesitates, watching Cas for a moment, and the angel raises an eyebrow. “What?”
I nod, standing up and walking behind him, trailing my fingers over his skin as I go. He shivers, but stays in place. “Alright. Rule one: If you don’t like something, you tell me immediately. That’s an order. Understood?”
He nods, sighing softly. “Hey Benny? What was that word he used before?”
He makes a frustrated, disgusted sound. “Dude, gross. No. I’m saying…our whole childhood we were denied affection. I mean, dad barely ever touched us. He certainly never hugged us. I didn’t have it so bad, because I had you. But you didn’t. When you’re starved for human contact like that, you take it however you can get it. I think you chased girls because they made you feel important. But you have Cas now, and he…he makes you feel loved.”
He nods. “Or sensations, maybe. It will take some practice on both our parts. I apologize for not realizing you’d be so alarmed. I suppose I’m a bit more used to the extra senses than you’d be.”
Slowly, Gabriel grins. "Well, the bond is still solidifying, but...I think it means it went better than we expected."
And now, almost a year after Dean’s lowest low, they sit on a blanket on a deserted beach in the mediterranian, watching the sunset. It’s cheesy, and stupid, and part of Dean feels like he’s in some bad teen romance movie, but it’s also nice, and he leans back into Cas’ chest a little more, smiling as the angel’s arms tighten around him. It’s quiet, and while the old him would have hated the silence, would have tried to fill it with anything he could think of, Dean has made peace with quiet, with the thoughts in his head that can’t suck him under anymore. Cas had taught him that.
Dean smiles, kissing his cheek softly. “I’m glad. He’s not going to come after you later for this, right?”
“I can’t,” he mumbles. “I have to move. God, I can’t…what if something happens to him?”

He stacks the dishes on the counter beside me, smiling and kissing my head lightly before turning back. John clears his throat, looking somewhat flustered. “I... I’m a little worn out. I think I’m going to turn in early. Excuse me.”
I hesitate, feeling the same way I felt when I was twelve, and dad caught me playing with his gun; the feeling that I’ve done something wrong without knowing what. “Well I…I was just…wondering…I mean, it’s not like I get to see them often…I was curious…and you didn’t seem to mind…”
going to ask him to marry you. Sam can be just as stubborn as Dean, and I know he’d never give you up without a fight. You make him happy too. And you need to hold onto that, okay? I believe in him.”
“I was thinking we could spend some time on the beach,” I answer, squeezing his hand lightly. “It looks beautiful out. But also, I was thinking...maybe it’s time to head back. I mean, this is all awesome, but...I’m kinda missing home.”
“Now Dean, you know how I feel about blasphemy in the bedroom,” I chuckle.
He obeys, though he glances back at me nervously. “Dean? What are you doing?”
Gabriel hums happily. “Yum! Can you make some with chocolate chips for me Dean-o? Pretty please?”
“Exhausted,” he answers after a pause. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so tired in my life. But also really good and kind of tingly. Did I really black out?”
Dean chuckles, stroking his cheek lightly. “You’re so beautiful baby. It always feels like that at first. Take some deep breaths and try to relax.” He reaches down, wrapping his hand around Cas’ shaft and stroking slowly, grinning at the low moan that escapes him as the tension in his muscles starts to ease. “There you go. Better?”
“Yes…please,” Cas murmurs.
“I think you broke me,” I repeat, a little clearer.
Dean breathes a sigh of relief, and Cas laughs. “I’m glad we could put your mind at ease. Hey Benny? I wanted to ask you about something.” Benny nods, looking up as Cas turns around. “I was talking to Dean earlier, and…I really want to get back into the playroom with him. But he said you have to clear me before we can do that. So what do you think?”
Dean chuckled, kissing him softly. “Yeah, I had that panic while you were asleep. I always kinda thought that finally picking a label would feel...like a death sentence. Like it would change everything about who I was. But actually, it’s...sorta nice, to know there’s so many other people out there who feel the way I feel. I mean, I don’t think I’m ready to, like, shout it from the rooftops or anything, but...I’m bisexual. And that’s not a bad thing. I’m still me.”
Dean bit his lip, debating with himself briefly.
Another, softer sob escaped the hunter, and he closed his eyes. “I never believed that before you...but after everything you said, I...I think you might be the only person who’s ever really
He shushes me softly. “Cas, I’m not mad. I knew what you were doing. I never knew you noticed that. It…wasn’t easy, but I realized that…my soul already trusted you completely. Enough to…submit to you, or whatever. So it was about time I got my brain on track.”
I nod, sitting down at the table while he slides them onto two plates. I reach out for his hand, stroking the back of it lightly with my thumb while we eat, but he still seems upset when we’re finished. An idea occurs to me, and I smile, pulling him up from the table. “Come with me.”
I nod again, taking a seat. “I think your theory is right. I know who’s behind it now. It’s Karael.”
He nods thoughtfully. “Yeah, I know what you mean. So, this place is totally deserted, right?”
Cas smiles. “You’re the best. I love you.” Cas changes into sweatpants and the sweatshirt that smells like Dean before cuddling up on the couch again. Dean’s hand slips under his jaw, pulling it up to kiss him softly. They break apart only when the doorbell rings. Dean gets up to answer it, expecting pizza, but instead it opens to show a distraught-looking Gabriel, who frowns in confusion. Cas looks up, puzzled. “Gabriel? What are you doing here?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He frowns. “I don’t need a shower Dean.”
Charlie snorted. “Trust me Cas, you do not want to know. But just think about it...if we are right about this...wherever Dean came from...this could be something way bigger than we thought.”
“It’s like a kind of safeword,” Dean explains. “Painplay can be intense, and I figured we’d both feel better if you knew you could get my attention even if you couldn’t say your word.”
“To the letter, Dean-o,” Gabriel grins. “You look like you have an idea.”
“We’ll have you back by dinner time, I promise,” Jody assured him. “Claire and Kaia should be here by then too. I’m sure everyone can hold down the fort for a little while.”
Dean snorts, pulling him into a soft kiss before getting into the car. "Yeah, I suppose they do make a good pair...Even though Sammy is like twice Gabe's size."
“Well, yes…angels don’t participate in that sort of behavior the way humans do. And most of the time it is exactly what I described to you. But they do have a mating ritual that, I believe, incorporates wings.”
He nods, tamping down the nerves in his stomach for a moment before he brings his arm back. He nearly recoils at the groan that escapes Dean, but Benny is grinning at him. “Was that…good?”
He laughs, putting the ring on. “I love it, Cas.” I grin, leaning in to kiss him softly, ignoring the cheers from the small audience.
A slow smile lit up the former angel’s face. “That does seem to be my usual pattern, doesn’t it?”
Dean swallows, shaking his head. “I think I’d remember someone like you,” he manages, his eyes narrowed.
, he reminded himself. He wasn’t sure why this stranger made him feel so flustered, but he knew he couldn’t be letting his guard down like this.
Dean glances over at me, smiling. “It was the least I could do, after all the times you’ve saved me. I mean, you did literally pull me out of hell. Besides, I think it worked out pretty well for us.”
"Sam?" Cas asks.
“Well, I guess there’s a couple of reasons. Firstly, I thought it would be a little overwhelming for you, and I didn’t want to do that. And secondly, I figured it would be much easier for you to relax if we started things on your home turf instead of mine, especially since you were nervous to begin with. One step at a time. So do you like it?”
“Feel a little better?” Cas asks softly.
Dean hesitates, glancing between the two of them. “Are you…sure you’re not mad?” he asks finally.
“Apparently,” I shrug. “You told me our story? Why?”
He shakes his head, stroking my cheek softly. “Nothing. I just…How are you doing?”
Love,
It takes Sam a confused moment to realize what he’s talking about, and he shifts in front of Gabriel just before John lunges towards him. Dean grabs my arm, yanking me behind him as he steps closer to them. “Dad, stop!” Sam yells, grabbing him by the shoulders.
Cas gasped, gently tugging him up until Dean’s face came into view, red and tear-streaked. “You...you’re serious?”
“Good boy,” Cas chuckles.
He cracks a small smile. “I think it’s settled now.” I nod, gently pulling him up, my wings uncurling from around him to allow him to move. Still, his closest wing reaches out towards mine, and I feel him relax when it slots perfectly underneath. He flushes red. “Sorry,” he mutters.
“How?” Cas asks curiously.
“Fine,” he answers quietly, grabbing his jacket. “I need some air.”
The former angel shook his head, carefully taking Dean’s injured hand, fingers skimming gently over the bandage wrapped around it. “Stay?” he asked, almost shy.
Dean laughs, kissing him lightly. “You always do catch on fast. Much better, as a matter of fact. And since I’m a little late in delivering my promise, I thought we should probably get started right away. You did ask for a long, thorough session, didn’t you?”
Dean chuckles. “As a matter of fact, it does. And since you were so good for the not fun part, it’s going to be extra fun.” His hand wraps around Cas’ erection, the thumb rubbing lightly just under the head while he gasps. “I could watch you like this forever,” he murmurs. “But we have quite enough work ahead of us.” Cas lets out a soft hum of approval, letting his head drop to Dean’s shoulder, his eyes fluttering closed as Dean’s fingers run feather-light over his skin. “I missed this,” he murmurs, pressing soft kisses along Cas’ neck and shoulder. “Missed getting to touch you like this…”
He smiles. “Of course I do. It meant a lot to me.”
Dean laughed, biting his lip. “Well, after we got him back, he...he started apologizing. He didn’t think I felt that way too. And he was saying that...we could just ignore it and go back to being friends...and then he said he could leave if I was uncomfortable. And I just...I panicked. I knew I couldn’t go back to that. I couldn’t lose him again. It just came out. I was kind of a mess, but...I told him.”
“So good,” he pants, moaning loudly when I wrap my lips around him again, moving in rhythm with my fingers. “Fuck, Cas…” He gasps sharply when I thread my free hand into his feathers, his back arching up off the bed. “CAS!”
Woo! Cuddles are the best. As I mentioned before I have suddenly had an influx of ideas about this one, so stay tuned and remember to review!
Cas gasps, sucking a bruise at Dean’s throat. “Yes,” he growls.
“Well,” Anna interrupts, “This just got awkward. I’m going to go find our table and let you four hash this out. Good luck.”
His hand clamps down suddenly this time, in the middle of Dean’s exhale, and the human’s body jerks, the pleasure and desperation rising in him quickly while Cas murmurs soft praises against his temple. His head starts spinning, and heat rushes through him when the pressure eases, his body humming with it. “F-Fuck...hnng...please,” he chokes out, shaking hard as the vibrator continues to buzz.
“Does...that mean you’re planning to stay?” Sam asks cautiously.
I snort. “You want me to be a girl and talk about feelings?”
“Just for being you. I sort of like you a little.”
“I guess I just…I still don’t get it. You have all the options in the world. You could have… literally anyone, any kind of life you want. I don’t get why you’d choose me and all my messed up crap.”
He smiles. “You’re a good friend, Dean.”
, right there…warm…tingly…”
“That’s alright, I get it,” Gabe smiles, wrapping an arm around him. “Come on, let’s go relax for a bit. I’ll teach you everything you need to know.”
Dean smiled, stroking his hair lightly. “That was real, we’re going to adopt you. Why do you ask?”
He shrugs. “Sam told me that you tend to have nightmares when you take that medicine. I figured it would happen sooner or later. And I thought this would be a good way to fix it. Is it working?”
Dean glances over his shoulder at him before turning back to the stove. “Yeah, figured we should eat before it gets late. Hope burgers are okay.” I can’t help but smile at the confidence in his tone, though I know he doesn’t feel quite as sure as he sounds.
Dean smirks. “Only if you want me too. But we don’t have to go if you’re too tired.”
Cas stirs slightly, and Dean smiles, humming softly until he settles. There’s a soft shuffling as Mary comes through, smiling when she sees him. “Hey mom,” he says quickly. “How’s the room decorating?”
“For what?” I ask, getting up to wash my plate.
I nod, kissing him lightly. “We will. Now, since you’re too wound up to sleep, lets relax for a while. What can I do for you?”
Dean laughs, looking suspiciously between the two of them for a moment. “Yeah, you’re a real natural, Benny. I miss anything interesting?”
allow this to happen, do you understand me?”
I chuckle. “Of course we can, Dean. Did you think I created this place just for a few hours?”
“But you love me,” Dean points out. “And believe me, I intend to. It’s just a precaution. Alright. What about kissing?”
“With flying colors,” Dean chuckles. “Everything looks perfect aside from a little swelling, which is normal.” His voice drops a little. “But you look so gorgeous when you’re spread out for me like this.” Cas shudders, whining softly. “Of course, I can stop if you want.”
I consider it for a moment, nodding. "Kinda worn out, and my arm kinda hurts, but...I'm okay. Actually it's kind of good. Better, now that I know you're not in danger."
“I…Yeah,” he says finally. “Just…a lot of information. You’re sure you’re okay?”
My heart leaps into my throat at the words, but I manage a nod, drying off my hands. “Sure. Come on, we can talk in the library.”
“Love you too,” he murmurs.
fuck…what the hell is that?”
He shrugs a little. “I suppose so. I just…I wasn’t sure how you felt at the time. I wanted you to like me. But once I was no longer useful to you, I didn’t know if you’d still want me around.”
“I suppose that depends on your point of view,” he answers carefully. “To me, it’s definitely a good feeling.” He pauses, then nods to himself. “Definitely good.”
“Because I think we should go to dinner together.”
“Bitch,” Dean mutters, but he’s smiling as he pulls back. “God, it’s good to have you back.”
“Are they…doing anything?” I ask. “Attacking people?”
He nods, sighing. “Look, Dad tried, I guess, but he had a lot to deal with. He wasn’t the best parent, and Dean tried to shield me from a lot of things, which meant that he got a lot more dumped on him than any child could handle, and he never figured out how to let it go. Dad put too much on him. He basically just made Dean raise me. And he wasn’t exactly a grateful person, or the kind of dad that told you you did a good job or you mattered or whatever. Dean always wanted his approval. And when he didn’t get it, he just worked harder and harder at trying to be who dad wanted. He tried so hard to make Dad proud. We had some good times too, but…what he did…Honestly, I think it really hurt Dean. He never talks about it, but I think there’s still a lot of pain there that he’s remembering today, and you know how he deals with pain.”
“That my little brother is having kinkier sex than I am,” he answers smirking.
I smile, relaxing into his side again. “I’m glad too.” I think for a moment, wondering if our bond changed anything in him the way it did in me. I reach up, lightly pressing my fingers to the approximate spot of the handprint on his arm. Dean yelps, jerking away, and I hear his heartbeat speed up.
“So you’re not freaked out?”
“You cook?” Cas asks curiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And when do you use it, pet?”
“Thank you, Hadriel,” I say, sitting down beside him. “You may go.” He nods, glancing worriedly back at Dean again before disappearing. I gently tug him closer, wrapping my wings around him. “I’m so sorry, Dean. I thought he would be smarter than thinking he could usurp me.”
Cas huffed, rolling his eyes. “Do you really think I’ll be any better at navigating this than you?”
Cas’ eyes were closed, tear tracks still shining on his face, and Dean hesitated only a moment before reaching out, cupping the angel’s cheek as he shook him lightly. “Cas? Come on, man, you gotta wake up...I need you...please...Cas!”
“Good. I thought so. So, if it made you feel good, and I enjoy caring for you, why shouldn’t we continue?”
“Don’t you dare. Come on, let’s go.”
“Everything,” I answer, hugging him tighter. “I don’t deserve you.”
“What are we doing now?” I ask curiously.
“Anytime,” I chuckle. “Want to come out to the kitchen with me?” He nods, so I carefully pull him up, leading him down the hall. He sticks close, dropping into a chair and making a small, grateful sound when I set a cup of coffee in front of him. “Was it the usual dream?”
“Yes Cas, as a matter of fact there is. The problem is that our pillows are not at all aerodynamically sound enough for me.”
“Wait,” Cas says again. “How did you find out they were there? They were supposed to be discreet.”
I consider it for a minute, then nod, moving into his lap, too shaky and desperate for comfort to care about how it looks. His arms tighten around me, and I feel

Gabriel nods before Sam pulls him down the hall. I glance towards the basement stairs, and Cas frowns. “No.”
Sam nods. “Well I can understand why it would freak you out if you’re not used to it. You know I wouldn’t hurt you, right?”
Cas laugh softly, planting light kisses over his chest. “Well, I can say that’s definitely the best way I’ve ever been woken up. I’m going to have to sleep like that more often.”
Dean chuckles, nodding and kissing him softly. “I have a few ideas.”
I try to laugh, but it comes out slightly hysterical. “I can see that.”
I nearly smile, leaning in to kiss him softly. “I love you, Dean. Relax. This doesn’t change anything. Though I have to say, some things make a lot more sense now. Considering this, and what happened in hell, it’s not hard to understand why you were so hesitant when we started this.”
He nods. “You’re probably right. But I’d still like to find out. It’s just odd.”
Cas grins. “I’ll do my best.”
I chuckle, relaxing and kissing him back. “If you say so. So how’d you break the spell?”
Dean shook his head, chuckling and eating happily. “Nothing. Just wondering if I should tell you you have whipped cream on your nose.”
“I’d like to hear more about you and Benny. I know you told me about the first time, but it’s interesting.”
“Not that I’m complaining,” Dean manages, “But you really should be taking it easy….and you don’t owe me anything. It was my pleasure.”
Another hour into the drive, Cas starts to stir, whimpering softly as he blinks groggily. “Cas?” I murmur. All of a sudden he jumps back from me, pressing as far back against the door as he can. I shift back, holding my hands up. “Woah, hey, it’s okay. Just me and Sammy. You’re safe now.” He hunkers down in the blanket, watching me cautiously. “Look, I’m really sorry about the shot. I know it wasn’t right, but we had to get you out of there before those people came back to hurt you. No more tricks, I promise. We’re here to help, alright?” His posture softens a little, but he stays silent with his back pressed against the door. “Okay, let’s talk,” I try. “We’re going to take you home where they can’t get you, and we’ll get you cleaned up and fed and warm. I’m going to stay right here on my side of the car, and I won’t touch you unless you say it’s okay. Sound like a plan?” Cas considers it for a minute before nodding, relaxing slightly. When I turn away he shifts to glance out the window, watching the snow on the ground blur by. Though still on guard, his exhaustion and the gentle motions of the car get the better of him, and soon he nods off, still huddled in his blanket. I watch him quietly for a minute, frowning at how small he looks. He reminds me of the little glass angel we put on the top of the makeshift Christmas tree I made for Sammy as a kid. He’d immediately bumped into it and sent the angel tumbling, shattering on the floor beyond the help of any glue. “He won’t even speak to me, Sammy,” I sigh. “I have no idea what to do here.”
I nod reluctantly, holding onto his hand as we go downstairs. Gabriel enters first, then motions for us to follow. The former angel in the chair grins when he sees us. "And here I thought you'd forgotten about me."
“That’s right, my good boy,” Dean chuckles. “And don’t you forget it.” His fingers find their way into Cas’ hair, tugging hard until his head tips back. He lets out a low moan as Dean begins to bite and lick his way up the pale column of his throat. After a moment Dean pulls back, taking a deep breath. “Now, we have a full schedule, so I think it’s time we get started, don’t you?”
“Help…would be appreciated,” I admit. “Just…slowly. Please.”
“It wasn’t pleasant,” I tell him.
Reluctantly, I blink up at him. “Surprise?” I murmur sleepily.
“Want what?” Dean asked quietly, and Cas felt it surge up again.
“When did you learn all that medical technique?” he asks curiously.
Cas shrugs a little, looking around again. “We still haven’t used this room,” he murmurs.
He looks over finally, smiling. “Well you and Dean both look out for me. It seems only fair that I do the same. It’s just…all those years of trouble; of a world without God…do you really think it’ll be fixed?”
I shrug. “It’s possible, though I don’t know how he’d manage to hide for so long. But…he did say something…It’s a little fuzzy.”
Cas considers his reflection, tracing his fingers over the raised letters again. “It’s perfect,” he murmurs.
“Well, yeah,” Dean shrugs. “He used to tape our sessions sometimes so he could show me different things, since I wouldn’t notice them much in the moment. After I’d calmed down a little, I asked him if I could see it. And I realized that he wasn’t going to turn on me.” He chuckles. “I turned around and hugged him, and he was in shock. He got me to talk about it a little bit, and I told him that I was afraid he’d disappear. He gave me his collar that day. He said he’d wanted to make it a special moment, but if I was that afraid then I needed something to remember the commitment he made to me.” He pauses for a moment, smiling at the memory. “He’s always been good like that. Benny just…always knew how to talk to me in a way I’d listen to.”
I moan my approval, and the muscles in his thighs twitch lightly, his hips starting a slow rhythm. It’s all I can do to keep my throat open and my breaths even, and Cas’ head tips back, letting out a low moan. “So good for me, Dean,” he murmurs. “I could fuck that pretty mouth all day long, and you’d let me so easily. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?” I nod, and he thrusts a little harder. “I know, baby. And maybe I will soon. But that’s not the only part of you I want to use today.” He pulls my head back until his cock pops free, and I look up to find him watching me fondly. I groan loudly as one of his fingers slips smoothly into my body, and he growls softly in answer. “Oh pet, you’re such a slut for my cock, aren’t you? Look how easy that pretty pink hole opens up for me…”
“Yeah, well I’m pretty lucky too. Now, you should get some rest and let the medicine work. Hopefully when you wake up you’ll feel a little better. I’ll even make you some lunch. Sound good?”
Smiling shyly, Cas opened the top of the box. Inside sat a black ring with a bright blue stripe, an unmistakable glow surrounding the band. “It took me so long to realize what had changed,” Cas continued. “I knew you were the righteous man, but...you were so much more than that. Once I’d saved you, gotten to know you...I didn’t feel broken anymore. My entire existence, I’d felt like...a puzzle piece that didn’t fit, no matter how you turned it. It wasn’t until I met you that I figured out I was just...trying to fit into the wrong puzzle. But with you, and Sam, down here...I found the place I fit. It was...shocking, and terrifying at first, but...I felt more at home with you in a run-down motel than I ever did in heaven. It turns out I was never broken. I just hadn’t found my missing piece yet. And I hope that I can give you...even half the comfort you’ve given me.”
“A little bit. Are you sleepy?”
Karael stares at him for a moment. “And if I don’t?” he asks.
“Enjoying the view,” Cas answers cheekily, taking in the fitted jeans and dark leather jacket he wears. “You’re rather attractive.”
“Yeah...not...back to the way things were, exactly, I really like how things have been lately, but...what happened...it’s like a ghost, just following me around. I think I need to finally face it. I think I need to go back to the bunker.”
Cas glances down to where they’re still connected. “Oh. Sorry.”
I can’t say I’ve ever had much of a daddy kink before, but I seem to be developing one quickly, and fuck if hearing him say that isn’t the best goddamn thing I’ve ever heard. “Yes…need you so bad…”
I sigh softly as his fingers travel to the back of my head. “And what happens if you use your safeword?” he asks softly.
I nod, setting Dean down on the couch while I grab the child-friendly cup. When I return, he’s poking his head curiously into some of the remaining bags Sam brought. Grinning, he pulls out of one a fuzzy stuffed animal. “Cas! Elphant!”
He nods. “Good. Alright, try to relax as much as you can, and breathe. I’m going to be gentle, but some of your knots are in knots, so they might be a little uncomfortable at first. But I promise you it won’t hurt, okay?”
“What?” Gabriel says innocently. “I was just a little excited!”
Dean answered, though he knew it was too risky. He’d already said too much, and the more Cas figured about him, the less he’d want him here.
Cas smiles, kissing me softly. "I'm glad. I promise you, I'm not going anywhere. You have nothing to be afraid of."
“Believe me, pet, I intend to do that for a long time. You may come whenever you’re ready. I’m so proud of you.”
“Very good boy,” Cas is murmuring now, eyes proud and fond as the hand in his hair returns, slowly guiding him further into Cas’ lap. Dean knows better than to take what he wants when he hasn’t been given permission, but the warmth and the scent of his angel are soothing anyway. “I know that’s hard for you, you did very well. You may.”
I nod, kissing his head. “I’m here for support, whenever you need. And I’m sure that Sam and Gabriel will be as well.”
“Great,” Sam answers, closing his laptop. “I already talked to Gabriel, so we should be good to leave tonight if you’re up for it.”
“We probably don’t have a lot of time before they move again. How fast can you pack your bags?”
“Yes you do. No matter. We all have creations that…get away from us sometimes.”
We don’t go far beyond light kisses and soft caresses, but it’s probably the most peaceful I’ve felt in a long time. When the water starts to cool off we get out, drying off and throwing boxers on before collapsing into bed. “Are you staying the night?” I ask.
“It’s not your fault, baby,” Dean assures him. “It happens. Talking about it and feeling it are two different things. I need you to look at me for a moment, because what I’m about to say is very important, alright?” Cas looks up, wide-eyed. “I am never, under any circumstances, going to abandon you,” Dean murmurs. “It’s very important that you understand that. Do you understand?” Slowly, Cas’ shoulders drop, and he nods. “Good. Let’s get you up. We’ll clean you up and talk about this a little, okay?”
He shrugs. “I was bored. I don’t know if it tastes any good.”
Dean nods thoughtfully. “Why didn’t you wake me up like I told you to?”
He grins. “Mhm. But if you don’t wake up you can’t have it.”
The hunter shook his head. “Nah, he’s not dead. Jack was able to absorb all his power, so now Chuck’s out there somewhere, living out a sad, pitiful little life all on his own. He’ll never be able to mess with us again.”
He smiles, stroking through my hair softly. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Benny snorts, getting up from the table to start digging through the fridge. “Well that’s certainly a good sign.”
“Pretty much,” he answers tiredly, taking a sip from the cup. “But it stuck around for a minute after I woke up, and I guess I kind of panicked.”
“Green,” I breathe. “Definitely green. Fuck…”
Cas chuckled, kissing his forehead softly. “Well, we don’t have to get up just yet...Did you sleep alright?”
“I do know what it’s like,” the angel agrees. “And I know that what we did last night helped. It’s not nearly as dark anymore. I’m not naïve enough to believe that it’s fixed now. You’re still very much grieving, and you should be allowed time to process everything. I’m just asking that you trust me, and allow me to help you through this.”
The other angel grins. “Ah, Castiel. It’s not my fault for doing what you’re too frightened to do. You continue to deny yourself the full bond with this human. Can you blame me, or anyone else, for doing what you will not?”
Dean grinned, nodding. “She’s great with him...and he loves the both of you. Honestly, I’m not sure he’d be doing as well as he is without you two.”
He makes a thoughtful sound, one of his hands shifting to pet along the back of my thigh. “Alright. Then talk to me. What’s bothering you?”
Dean flushed, biting his lip. “Yeah...yeah, you’re right, it’s just...it’s weird, I guess. My whole life, my only job was to look out for him. It’s what I always did. It kinda feels like...like I’m being selfish, now. Like I shouldn’t be thinking about what I want.”

“No, I know,” he interrupts, flushing again. “After the psychic thing I’ve been…researching. I know it’s just an instinctual thing. I just…didn’t know it would be so obvious so soon. I guess I didn’t count on growing wings that broadcast my deepest secrets.”
“That’s perfect,” I murmur, starting to plant soft kisses along his spine.
“Love you too.”

I sigh. “Well don’t worry. When we find that bastard we’ll crack him instead.” A hint of a smile flickers across his face, and I wrap an arm around his shoulders. “Are you gonna be okay?”
“That I do,” he sighs. “Come on, let’s get cleaned up. And you’d better behave yourself.”
“Well, after being pent up for so long, I think you need a good, thorough release,” Dean smirks. “Don’t you worry. We’re gonna empty you out real well.” A broken cry escapes Cas at that, and Dean releases his cock, pulling his chin up and kissing him softly. “Gonna take good care of you,” Dean murmurs.
Bobby glanced away, but not before Dean noticed his eyes start to well up. “Grandpa, huh? Kind of has a nice ring to it,” he said finally, smiling. “That kid o’ yours is somethin’ else.”
He’s panting faster now, and I can feel his stomach start to clench as he gets closer. “Dean!” he cries, his voice absolutely wrecked as he jolts against my hold.
“Dean… your face is rosy, you’ve been shivering already, and now you’re trying to keep your hands warm by putting them in your pockets,” Cas stated, completely misunderstanding half of those things. Dean just let him believe though, it was better than the real reason his face was red and why he shivered when Cas was so close. Maybe he was starting to get a little cold, but that hadn’t been the reason, not by a longshot
“How do you mean?” Cas asked, squinting his eyes at Sam.
He walked over to his bag, finding semi-clean clothes to wear. Pulling some boxer on underneath his towel first, before throwing it onto the bed. When he did, he noticed Cas’ eyes were still on him, but not on his face. They were trailing along his body, not looking away.
A few days later, Cas was about to check something on his phone when he realized that it was almost dead, huh, how did he not notice earlier. He was certain the last time he used his phone charger was in the library, so off to the library, he went in search of it. Once he got there, he noticed that it wasn’t where he’d last left it. Feeling as if maybe he had been thinking of the wrong spot, he looked around the library for a few more minutes but came up empty. The charger was nowhere to be found.
This seemed to make Cas feel slightly better, the corners of his mouth curving up slightly.
“Well, you might be, but normally, humans enjoy having a proper place to sleep that isn’t five feet away from a puddle of pee and a dumpster full of rotting garbage.”
Honestly, Cas was going to be the death of him one day.
The sound of someone clearing their throat broke them from their daze. It was Sam, who chuckled once they both looked up at him.
With a second glance, he looked down at the home screen of the phone, looking at the image that had caught his eye. There, on the home screen of Dean’s phone was a picture of Cas which was certainly not what he had expected to see there. He assumed it would’ve been a picture of the Impala but no, apparently he was wrong about that.
Cas wasn’t sure what to say to Dean right now. Anything he thought of just didn’t feel right, so he decided not to speak. Instead, he reached out a hand, placing it on Dean’s right knee which was still partially bent. He stroked it gently with his thumb, trying to provide him with a sense of comfort as he did so. He kept his gaze locked on Dean as he did this, offering him a small smile. Dean’s hand started to slide up towards his knee then, towards Cas’ hand, but then he stopped, dropping it back down a little so his hand rested on his thigh. They stayed like that for a moment, both of them frozen until Dean decided to continue.
“Dean, I- I didn’t mean for you to… I’m sorry.”
Dean knew there was one more thing though, one thing that he tried not to think about because it would only hurt him more afterwards. He didn’t know why it took him so long to think of it, but he knew it probably wasn’t a good idea. It wouldn’t make him miss Cas any less, but he didn’t care, he needed to hear his angel's voice.
"No, not really. I just- I don't want you to get hurt."
“I- Could you…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope you know that you will always be welcome, that we will always be your family, even if you aren’t physically here.”
Now he didn’t just need to wash his body, but he needed to wash out his eyes and his brain, as well.
Cas if he was feeling ready to go on a hunt with him just yet, but he also knew that in these past few days since he’d been back that he’d only very rarely left Dean’s side, and that was really only when Dean showered or went to the bathroom, the former of which Cas had almost gone with him once before he so kindly reminded Cas that he needed some privacy or whatever.
“But it’s his father and Mary would-”
Dean was speechless, he didn’t think Sam knew
“You didn’t- you mean you
“Ahh is your boyfriend in some sort of trouble?’
Dean looked Cas in the eyes then, two pairs of glassy orbs meeting, he felt frozen. He had never thought about it too much when he was rebuilding Dean’s body and soul. He never imagined the impact that this would have had on the hunter, it never crossed his mind. Even now, he hadn’t considered it, but he could hear it in Dean’s voice how much he appreciated that one thing, it was written all over his face as well.
Cas was staring at Dean intently, he didn’t want to miss a single word or expression from the other man. He watched Dean nod his head, just once, a small slow nod. He might have missed it if he hadn’t been watching.
“Sounds a little complicated Cas…” Dean sighed, closing his laptop and rubbing his face.
“You know what? I could yell at you till I’m blue in the face but none of that would matter if you had no intentions of fixing things. So… do you intend to make it up to him?”
Not long after he’d neatly hung his clothes over the back of a chair, Dean had emerged from the bathroom. Castiel looked up from his phone, he’d just sent Sam a quick text that they had arrived at a motel for the night.
The way Dean loved so strongly and deeply, the way he actually cared about the people around him and fought for those people, fought for the whole world, in fact, because of how strongly he believed it to be right. Even when all seemed impossible, Dean kept fighting. He didn’t give up, he wouldn’t sacrifice the whole world for his own happiness or personal gain, quite the opposite actually. Dean would give everything he had for the sake of other people, people he didn’t even know. He would sacrifice his own happiness or even his life.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. “I- yeah,” was all that he managed to get out, wondering if Cas was really going to do what he thought-
He turned around, sighing tiredly, “I’ll be there in a minute, Balthazar, okay?”
Cas looked at Sam for a moment. “You didn’t know…?” He asked slowly, now feeling unsure about the information.
“Yes, if you don’t mind,” Cas replied.
He could tell that Cas’ eyes were still definitely
“Dean fucking Winchester. If you don’t stop shoving those damn panties in my face...” Cas started before Dean decided to get cocky.
Dean was hardly even able to finish before Cas had hit his limit, come spurting between both their stomachs and all over Dean’s panties.
Thankfully, the afternoon came where they had finally finished everything up. The three of them didn’t have much trouble once they had actually found the wolves. It turned out to be a pack of four. They put up a decent fight, two of them going for Cas once they noticed how strong he seemed to be and one managed to make a sizable rip in Cas’ shirt. Another almost knocked Dean out when he got distracted from that, but Sam had already managed to take down one of them and took this opportunity to rush over to Dean before any real damage was done.
“Good, I’ll go make some popcorn.”
Castiel was happy to see some of his brothers and sisters, some that he had not seen in a very long time, and others he had only parted ways with more recently.
“That should’ve never been put on you, Dean. You didn’t deserve to grow up like that.”
This love that he felt, it snuck up on him until one day, it consumed him completely. He doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to say when exactly he fell in love, or pinpoint a certain moment because he fell in love with this hunter more and more each day. Even now, being stuck in the Empty, he found himself falling even more.
love with Dean.
He kept walking, every sense on high alert, ready to catch any sign from Dean, no matter how small. Cas followed the symbols Dean had been drawing, making it to the fourth one, but then he noticed they just stopped. He should’ve had two more to go, but there were no more in sight. That’s when the panic begun to set in, attempting to take over as his eyes frantically searched through the thick trees.
“If it’s bothering you, we can just forget about it. It’s alright, I don’t wish to make you uncomfortable.”
“Well then, I guess we would have no reason to talk about you.”
“It startled me so badly, I almost fell out of my chair. It wasn’t until I saw the look of fear that had washed over my father’s face that I really began to get nervous, god I’ve never forgotten that look. He tried to hide it from my sister and I, tried to smile and say everything was going to be alright, that he was going to go check on our mom and to stay by the fire where he could find us.”
Well... SURPRISE.
Jack was dreading the moment where he would finally have to tell Cas about the deal he made. He knew he wouldn’t be happy about it, simply because it was with Chuck, and anything to do with Chuck seemed to be a bad idea. Cas hadn’t exactly asked him how he had done it at first, too in awe by it all. He wanted to get to know as many angels as he could, to get to know his son's creations. He also wanted to try and help any of the angels he had brought back with him to make this adjustment as smooth as possible.
“Really, why do you say that…?”
Rising slowly from his spot on the bed, Castiel shuffled over to where Dean was standing, hovering behind the taller man.
“Cas, could you do one last thing for me?”
“Wait,” Sam interrupted, raising his hands in the air to stop Cas. “He’s been what?”
He slammed the door shut even faster than he had opened it. When he turned around he noticed Sam staring at him in confusion, and then there he was. Lucifer was there, he was in the bunker. What the hell had Dean just done. How were they doing to get out of this? He had no weapons on him and neither did Sam, they were completely unprepared.
(See the end of the chapter for
They arrived in one of the dark, stony halls of hell. The dim light created shadows that danced around them and if trying to pull them into the darkness, to hold them there forever. They could hear the screams of the souls there. John must’ve recognized the sounds of it from last time he was here.
Cas knew Dean wasn’t perfect though, but that’s also why he loved him, he loved how human he was with all of his flaws. With the way he was too afraid to admit he was wrong, when he was too scared to be hurt or to open up to those he loved. Even when he pushed Cas away and put up all his walls, Cas still loved him. He couldn’t help but love him, even if it hurt.
When he opened it, Sam wasn’t there. He let out a sigh of relief, but then a little whimper caught his attention. He looked down at the ground and his breath caught in his throat. He couldn’t believe his eyes. Was that? It couldn’t be, could it?
Cas realized then, what was wrong. He began to walk towards the bed now, kneeling on the floor when he reached it.
“Yeah… who you are. Broken, that’s who you are.”
He watched Cas take a deep breath, but then a small smile appeared on the other man's lips.
“Okay Dean, I trust you,” Cas says sincerely, catching Dean’s gaze.
Daytimes weren't much different if he was being honest. Sure, all four of them would hang out, and each would find some times for themselves to do whatever it is they wanted to do, but Dean still found himself searching for Cas more often than not if he didn’t know where the angel was. Maybe it was a little clingy, but he couldn’t care less.
Cas knew what was coming next, but it didn’t make it any easier. He had cherished these past few days with Jack. He would hold onto them for the rest of his life. Stepping closer to Jack and wrapping him in a tight embrace, he tried to come to terms with it all, he tried to let go.
“You’re human now, Chuck, something you’ve never had to consider before, and it’s hard, being human. There are so many things that they need to survive, to live. I could assist you if you help me. Make this new human life a bit easier for you. I could find you a home, maybe something for you to do or a way to earn money. Judging by your life now, you clearly could use all the help you could get.”
His lips made their way to Dean’s neck, kissing and nipping their way along it as his hands slid down Dean’s body, all the way to his jeans. His fingers fumbled clumsily for a moment to get the button undone before undoing the zipper as well and shoving his pants down his legs. Dean tried to step out of them but before he could, Cas was grabbing the back of his thighs and was lifting him up onto the table.
On Cas’ first case back from the Empty, when Dean made him wear that absurd hat. Cas had felt so ridiculous and embarrassed at first, but then when he looked at Dean when he saw that look on his face, he couldn’t help but smile. He couldn’t refuse Dean, so he cracked a joke about it, hoping to get some kind of reaction.
“Well, I’m aware that after your mother died, you and Sam spent your childhood jumping from town to town as your father searched for Azazel and that you took on a father-figure role to Sam. Then eventually you both started to hunt as well.”
“Cas...please” he let out a broken plea.
“Just take it slow then, you just got back, there’s no need to dive back into it all, right?”
Bobby interjected here. “She’s not the weak one John and neither is Dean. That boy is so much more than you ever were.”
“Yes, it took a bit of digging since they didn’t mention his name in the article, but they did mention the name of both his parents and his aunt that took him in who lived in a nearby town. We could try to find her which may lead us to him. It could be worth the trip.”
