Sherlock snorts, then lapses back into drying the pan in silence. After a moment, he says, "I didn't know Tariq was gay."
. The last purchase of the day is still wrapped in tissue paper resting in the bag standing up at the edge of the sink: he could take it out, he thinks; could unwrap it; could wind it fast around himself—he wraps his hands around himself—and draw it tight—he draws them tight: try to fasten the hooks up one by one by one not breathing on a body just-enough bigger than Sherlock's soft tender white frame—; but he doesn't. Instead in stockings and suspenders he squeezes his hands 'round his sides and his belly hard and then hard and then harder until he gasps, realizes he's gasping: his wet-tipped red cock nudging hard out of his ill-fitting knickers and his improperly placed nipples jutting hard against the scraping-stretched lace of his bra.
John taps his chopsticks against the edge of his bowl. "Mycroft ought to be pleased."
John nods. Chews. Swallows. "Sleep wouldn't do us a world of harm, either."
"Yeah, the first one he'd bought barely came down past his arse by the end of the year," John explains. "Sleeves up at his elbows and all."
George is watching him.
"Can I kiss you?" John asks, rough.
John nods. Helps Sherlock straighten up, a bit, and Sherlock's hand falls, brushes soft over his hair. "It's. Good." Sherlock's voice is wavering. "A bit—too good, perhaps, I—"
"Why, is it glass?" John says, eyes wide; and Sherlock rolls over to flick the buckle end of the cock ring against his thigh. Not hard, but it still stings: John snaps the other wet flannel down into his chest.
, and twenty-seven minutes later he'd been clean-toothed in bed still wide-eyed, all the lights out, heart heavy, everything washed out in the basin and hanging to dry, before
, now. Sherlock allowing John this little soap-bubble fantasy; half-believing it, even, even though John can't: this lovely lustrous idea that John had known, somewhere deep down inside him. That this has always, at the core of him, been what he's been.
"Why not?" Sherlock whispers. "You said you like it."
"I just wish you'd said something," she says, and John swallows. Straightens.
"I'm not," John says, very quietly. "Sherlock."
"I think you know why," Sherlock says. Mr. Holmes.
, in an office where none of the windows open more than a crack with Natalie already clicking up to his door and calling, "Let me just check!" while John shoves himself back into his pants and yanks his zip up and drops the wadded-up ball of kitchen roll in the bin.
"Stand up, please," Holmes says, a moment later. Wrong. John shifts his weight back. Stands up. Lets his dressing gown fall. When he turns Sherlock is looking at him, wide-eyed, with his arms wrapped over his ribs and his mouth twisted down; and John says, "Am I dismissed," and it doesn't come close to hitting the right tone but Sherlock just scrubs at his hair and nods, Holmes long gone.
He settles down on the left side of his stomach, blinking at the wall and the shadows and the box standing open beside the laptop atop Sherlock's chest of drawers: John's shoulders are prickling before Sherlock even really touches him, a kiss high up on his spine with his palm resting low on John's back. Sherlock's mirror is somewhere behind or to the left of them, watching. Sherlock is petting over his buttocks, gentle—slow—
John chews. Swallows. Nods.
He shifts. He has, as always, the feeling that she's laughing at him, a bit. "Jet-lagged?" he asks. It's not unfamiliar. After all, she's a teacher. He'd had that same feeling all through school, too.
John swallows. "Are you finished, then," he asks, "for the evening?"
Sherlock lifts his chin. "After you ate all my duck à l'orange?"
"Like your job," George says, and bursting John pushes up to his feet, and goes over to the window. Knees knocking into the sleeping radiator, he presses his hot palm to the glass.
; but it comes easily. Right away.
His pulse, against his temple: a throb. A throb.

"You mean," John says. Swallowing. "What will I do if you infuriate me?"
, we have to—I don't want it to be over, and I don't want it to be like this, and I don't want to force you, it'll—
"You were an absolute hazard during school games, I'd reckon, weren't you." John forces himself up to his feet. "Football dives and all." He turns back. "Did you cry?"
Sherlock takes a deep, slow breath. "John."
John nods. "You shave with the grain, don't you." He brushes rubs his thumb through the foam along Sherlock's right cheek, down to his jaw; and then presses his fingertip under Sherlock's chin again. Tilting it, very slightly, to the side.
"Yeah." John's heart thuds in his ears. He swallows. "Can you," he says, "touch me," quiet, and Sherlock kisses the crest of his shoulder, then twists away: he'd left the toys on the nighttable, John knows, but Sherlock is just shifting for a better angle, pulling John's arse apart.
Without answering, Sherlock peels off the other stocking. Clumsily John scoots across the duvet towards him, until he can drop his legs over the edge of the bed: Christ, he wants to stand up and—and
"But—," John says, after a moment; and then, "—er."
": and Sherlock gives a little hot gasp but lets go of him, pulling away splotching up all over, rolling onto his back so John can pet at his tight nipples, kiss his long throat; kneel up above his panting-flushing body and look down at him: his creamy throat, lovely shoulders, his dark eyes and his mouth and his bellows-working ribs and the cup of his belly and the tip of his prick, wet-red and shiny, nudged well out of his knickers full up to bursting with his bollocks, all the softest savoriest parts of him; the bands of the stockings slipping slightly down his long trembling white thighs.
"Yaargh," John manages; Sherlock huffs. He wraps his arm around-underneath John's liquid-dripping body, then rolls up just enough to tuck John—saturated, limp-noodled—sticking-tight back to his chest. Sherlock tucks his face down against him, mouth warm on his skin. John just lets him; doesn't want not to, anyway.
"Yeah." John swallows. "
"You're about her size," Sherlock says.
Sherlock's face. A long complicated series of—shifts, and then—then a half-new confusion of an expression, something not entirely unlike—yearning, or—gratitude, mixed up with the slackness of sleep: unreadable, almost, but not quite. Then Sherlock presses his forehead to John's hot forehead; and eases his fingers out, slow and careful; and then slides both his arms beneath John's torso, drawing him in tight and close.
After a moment, John reaches down for his sandwich. Pulls it out of the box to pick at it, a bit. It's gone soggy in the middle, and dry about the edges. He doesn't know why he bothers.
"No accountant?" Sherlock asks Rhoda; and she laughs.
John sighs. It's not a productive line of thought. If it had been real—but it wasn't. He catches himself trying, over and over, with every ounce of strength in his body to go back: but there is no
"All right?" Sherlock asks, quiet: and aching and hollow and
"I was going to ask if you wanted Thai," Sherlock says, helping John to tug his arms free, then twisting to drop the shirt on the floor. John pulls him back in by the warm wings of his back ribs and gives him a kiss, quick, before Sherlock pulls back just far enough to add, "I had to go down and do all sorts of very tedious follow-up with Lestrade," as John gets his trouser button open and sticks his hands into his pants, "so Ifeltthatweoughtto oh-h-h

"What?" Greg laughs, short. "There was another threat, you know, at—"

An invitation, nearly, that look. "We could always do something else," John suggests, petting down. "For a while."
John nods, and then rocks up onto the balls of his feet.
for him already; had been lightheaded, nearly, with Sherlock's cheek resting high up on his thigh. John swallows and undoes the button, too. Blood pounding in the palms of his hands. He shoves everything down to the tops of his thighs, reaches for the lube. He wonders if Sherlock does it with lube: real lube, the good stuff, the sort you don't know much about when you're—what, he must've been seventeen? eighteen? Christ. Twenty

a doctor, after all, sort of. So Sherlock trembles in his lap trying to push him harder and faster while, aching all over inside for him, John pets at his hip, slow, at his back, slow, at his ribs, kissing him slow and sweet and soft, and whispers: “Please.” Wanting—wanting to give Sherlock every sort of tender thing, nothing Sherlock would ask for or will let him say; until at last shuddering Sherlock presses his forehead down to John's forehead, and slow, like bellows relaxing, he breathes.

"Oh." John swallows; "Right, yeah, I'll just": as he waves a hand at the landing, even though Sherlock isn't looking at him. John darts past his back and out, taking the stairs two at a time.
"Isn't it—obvious," he says, and then, raw and aching, he laughs.
"Just call," Rhoda says quietly, and Natalie nods, pulling her hair back behind her shoulders, flashing her big white steady smile.
John says, "You don't have to make anything up to me."
"Yes, at all," Sherlock repeats, "
John can't picture it, but he wants to. Wants to see Sherlock, shirt open, kneeling up and shivering, petting at those pink lovely splotches on his throat and his ribs; wants to lick at his rosy nipples while Sherlock gasps and whines with his trousers barely open fucking a half-dry fist because no one's ever showed him how good it can be when you do it
"I don't think Mycroft'd get involved for a half-dozen duffle bags with handguns stuffed in amongst their dirty washing, no," Sherlock says, under his breath, as John stabs up another tangled knot of ramen.
"Rhoda's got three kids," John says, after a minute. "You—you do know that, right? She has to take time off when they're ill or in the play or—and I've said, I
"Yeah." John nods. He wishes he could—he could take a sip of water, perhaps: his plate empty, Sherlock's hand in his hand. He doesn't do it, though. Instead he keeps as still just there as he can and says, "So you took on that role," casually, lightly, "in the past."
), and nods. John watches his neck as he turns towards the kitchen; then tucks the eyeliner into his pocket, and doesn't say a thing.
"Eva," Sherlock replies.
, you're a disgrace to the NHS."
His breath all dragged down into Sherlock and moaning. John. Pulled up tight rolled into a pebble of himself inside Sherlock's wet, soft mouth. John swallows, legs falling—
They're still downstairs polishing off their green curry and pad thai when Greg bounds up with a particularly grisly bit of work for the two of them, and John only has a half a moment to consider that it's rather lucky they'd got all the way dressed before ordering, since Greg never knocks. They don't get in again until nearly seven Wednesday morning, and John ends up dragging himself through the rest of his shifts for the week solely by virtue of Sherlock periodically texting him queries about the precise mechanics of exsanguination under a variety of environmental conditions, which come at intervals frequent enough to keep John more or less upright; and the extremely strong and miserably bitter coffee at the café where Natalie likes the girl who does the takeaway. The murderer turns up at the docks on Friday, and by the time John's got Sherlock out of the shipping crate and the paramedics have given him oxygen and checked him over and Lestrade's bawled him out to a more or less sufficient extent, John's far past even objecting to paying for their cab. Straight in the door to 221B: Sherlock to his shower, and John upstairs to sleep for fourteen hours.
John swallows.

"For me to fuck you across the table," Sherlock says.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I was." Sherlock's voice is thick. He isn't looking at him. He is looking at the floor. "On Thursday."
"I've sent the photo to Lestrade, too," Sherlock is saying, "but he won't be able to find him on his own, not quickly, at least. And if he's going to be bombing—the British Museum, and St. Paul's and Madame Tussauds and the sodding London Eye—"
"Maybe you should show me how to put on your cock ring," John says, "and

; "If I didn't want to be safe I would've given my notice as soon as you came back," says John, in a fast-sharp too-honest rush: helpless stroking Sherlock's dark curls back as Sherlock takes a deep startled breath looking up:
"If you get it, I'll wait," Sherlock says, very quietly. "I'm not in a hurry."
John nods. "Yeah," he says. It comes out lopsided, ill-formed: he clears his throat, and his helpless right palm rubs down the warmliving velvet of Sherlock's bared chest.
Sherlock shakes his head.
"But it's always about what I want," John blurts out. "I can't—he doesn't tell me, he
John inhales. The table. Their soaked and crumpled serviettes still in the center; John's cup (half-full) and Sherlock's (already nearly empty); John's three-quarters of a piece of French toast and Sherlock's bare plate and Sherlock's open mouth on him through his boxers: damp.
"I can't believe you haven't caught him already," John says, trying not to laugh. Sherlock looks personally offended. "He doesn't sound quite like the criminal underworld's great thinker."
"Not a trade," John says. Too fast. Foolish. He rubs at the swell of Sherlock's bare shoulder over and over with his throat feeling too full until he can say, "I want," careful and steady, "to see how you do it," with Sherlock pulled back bare inches, disheveled and lovely, with his pajama bottoms riding low on his pink-splotching hips.
," which is patently false, so John pulls at the front of Sherlock's shirt.
"Quarter past," Sherlock says, and John nods. Checks his mobile, then tucks it back into his pocket. The ferry doesn't come, because it's not due yet, and after a minute John says, "Who does that, honestly?"
"Sherlock," John whispers, shaken, awed; and hot all over pressed tight against him still hard Sherlock makes a little incoherent noise and squeezes him tighter. Tight.
"Yeah, I—" John swallows, laughs. "Having to get off in my desk chair before I was fit to see patients, I'd think that qualifies as 'liking it', y—" and Sherlock interrupts him, slick-tongued and thick.
Not looking John in the eye.

John nods slowly. "Easier," he echoes; and Sherlock rubs at his own face.
think about Sherlock; but he hadn't thought about Sherlock then. John'd still found it easy to want Sherlock, down on his knees on the carpet of a Sunday while it rained. He finds it easy to want Sherlock now. 350 kilometers away John wants Sherlock. If Sherlock were here, John would find it easy to want him here, too. John wants to roll around with him and rub up against him and sink down around him thighs shaking, wants to watch his lovely fair face flush up a hot hectic pink, wants to kiss his throat and stroke his hair and go down on him for hours, until his jaw aches, until his throat's raw, until kissing him after Sherlock makes those little hot-purry sounds that Sherlock makes when John's turned him on, licking his come from John's mouth. All of that is easy for John: easy enough to get him half-hard in his pajama bottoms just thinking about it, Sherlock over him with John's knees up, pressing into him toys-tongue-hand-cock, saturating John's body with his body. Unraveling, to weave himself in.
John closes the fridge.

into the shade"; which makes Sherlock laugh, just as John'd wanted: loud and young and warm underneath him; wrapping long sweat-sticky arms around him, tugging John down against him, as John slides his arm under Sherlock's head, and pulls himself in.

He sounds so peevish about it John feels guilty for being relieved: Chloe, whatever her faults, is at least, in John's experience, admirably well-armed.
The taps. The thunk of the kettle on the counter. John is peculiarly aware of the press of his elbows on his knees: the weight of his own body, the scratchy press of his clothes. The kettle is only just really getting started, the low, tidal rush of the water not-quite-boiling. Unready. John can hear his own breathing over it, and—and that—that
"I perhaps ought to mention that it won't—won't stop you, really," Sherlock says, under his breath, with his hands sliding up John's sides; and John says, "I'll take anything I can get"; and Sherlock's face cracks open: a broad, soft-eyed, too-frank smile. John bends down to kiss him. Sherlock nuzzles his face. His hands warm and slow, sliding the wrong way up the prickling skin of John's back. "So," John asks, half into Sherlock's mouth, "are you actually planning to fuck me, or—or just draw up the plans for the endeavor," and Sherlock starts giggling. "I mean," John adds, while Sherlock is kissing all along the underside of his jaw, still laughing, "not that I

to enjoy it," Sherlock says, very low. He turns his face. Meeting. Forehead to forehead. His voice is unsteady, clogged. "Is that enough?"
"I want to be all right for you," John says; and Sherlock swallows noisily. Nods. "I just want," John explains, "to—to not be another thing," swooping, turning down, "that makes you. Hurt."
"You're not going to—tease me, about this, are you," Sherlock says quietly; and John closes his eyes.
Sherlock reaches up, puts the saucepan away. Picks up the stock pot, rubs it dry, tucks it away. Shuts the cupboard again with a dull, final-sounding clunk.
—and slow Sherlock unfolds: shifting awkwardly in his bra and half-off knickers and stockings (checked necktie twisting), then sliding himself down next to John's badly-strung body, and then shoving his face down hot to John's throat.

"I wanted," John gasps, "to, to
," John corrects, and twists, trying to reach. Sherlock yanks his hand back up to John's hip, leaving slippery fingerprints. "No, not—I meant the bottle." John gets his fingers around it and wraps both his arms around Sherlock's head, bottle tucked tight against his palm. Mouth, to mouth, to mouth, with his leg stretched just to the edge of aching.
"Yes," he says, finally, feeling—
out allatonce and pressing his three long fingers in in
"I thought I'd bias the results." Rubbed rough near quiet:
Sherlock drops his bag on the floor. "Are you still reading that?"
Sherlock, knife and fork poised, glances over at him with an unreadable expression; so John locks his mobile, turns it screen-down, and asks, "All right?"
John tucks his chin to his chest, watching. He still feels half-asleep, made up of ghost imprints of Sherlock's warm skin on his skin, all the way down to the long rangy furnace of Sherlock's body pressed against the insides of John's legs as he pulls John's cock back into his wet mouth. John runs his fingers over Sherlock's scalp over and over and over, while Sherlock's mouth pulls at the insides of him, spine and fingertips, his broad—wet tongue, and John breathes. Breathes. Cool air in his open mouth and Sherlock's springy-satiny hair on his hand and Sherlock's mouth on him around him and Sherlock's thumb petting circles into the top of his thigh. Hypnotic, everything. So sweet.
"I meant," Sherlock says.
John swallows. "Do you mean that it wasn't bad because—because it wasn't bad, or because it could've been a lot worse?"
Outside the window, the rain keeps prattling on. John scrubs his hands through his hair, looks up.
. "I'm not in a hurry,"  John murmurs, as Sherlock brushes his mouth against John's mouth.
"You could get away with all sorts of things, if I were tied up," John says. "Surely you must have some deep dark secret desires, somewhere under there—
," and Sherlock slaps him, hard. John's face falls forward, Sherlock's arm, electric green sparks. Sherlock grabs him by his hair and yanks him back up. John whines. "You remember what to say when you don't?" Sherlock asks, and John swallows—Sherlock's arm loosens— "Yes," John gasps, "yes—my face, please—" and Sherlock presses his arm up again, tight. Thigh tight to John's prick, leaking all over his trousers, his breath coming in hot wet bursts on John's burning face.
"You—you could." Focus: John, blinking, breathes. His hot lesbian girlfriend: they'd— "Kiss," John says, and then takes a breath. Lets it out, kisses Sherlock's mouth, kisses his cheek. Sherlock's arms wound around him, tethering, while they kiss in the wreck of John's bed.
It comes out muffled, a bit, by Sherlock's hair; but Sherlock doesn't seem interested in pretending to misunderstand. He hums, then goes quiet again; sinking an impossible bit further, stuck together, petting his long fingers against John's fingers on his sternum: his heart warm, his skin thin. All his weight against John in the bath. Sherlock swallows: up-down—up—down—; and then says, "Me neither."
Sherlock is silent for a long, electric moment. Never wavering from John's face.
John's throat tightens, an instant. "All right": echoing; he bends to kiss the side of Sherlock's folded-up knee. Then he clambers up to his knees and heads for the wardrobe, thinking—thinking that when he'd thought about it this is not what he'd thought about, but he hadn't thought about it, exactly. Thinking—
"This Jacob fellow," John says, very quietly.
Sherlock doesn't answer.
"I don't think you want a fuck against the fridge," John, quiet, corrects; and Sherlock flushes all-at-once red.
," John blurts—helpless— as Sherlock pants, "Sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't—" and John manages, "no you can I—
"Oh, I think so," John says. "Best to be flexible with these things."
His breath falls soft into the space between them. Their faces their bodies: a cup.
"Is that." John swallows. "Good, or."
"Yeah," Sherlock says, quiet.
"Oh, because I'm a bastard, probably." He sighs again. Staring out across the street: watching a girl in huge sunglasses dropping something in the postbox at the corner, the bare wedge of skin framed by the neck of her sundress and her collarbones half-covered by a photorealistic greyscale tattoo of a horse.
Sherlock groans. Back bowing up like a bridge because he wants—he
A half-beat later, Sherlock nods. John kisses him, soft, barely brushing; and Sherlock sighs, nuzzling against him.
Slow. Slowly, he scrapes the sweet potato off the sheet pan, into the bowl. Stirs, slowly. After a moment, John hooks his fingers in the handles of their teacups, and carries them over to the table.
Sherlock's hands have slid up to John's shoulders. Clasped close 'round the back of his neck, clinging. John wants—he wants to be
John swallows. "Brave fellow," he says, trying for light and missing by a mile; "I trust you," Sherlock says, quiet, and presses his arse back into John's hands.
John nods. Nuzzles his hair. "Takeaway?"
Sherlock doesn't move at all. It's amusing, really, because Sherlock knows how to fake his attention in one place when it's really entirely in another, but resting his palms on the edge of John's keyboard with his long fingers still and his eyes cast down demurely is very far from doing the trick, and when John rubs at his flies behind his bent-up knees, Sherlock's fingers twitch visibly.
"Are you worried that he's going to leave you?" George asks, "or are you worried about what you did when he left last time?"; and "Christ," John mutters, and then presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
"Look." He tries to explain. "I had this mum in today. Couldn't've been much more than twenty." Still makes his chest feel tight: Daisy Bowcott's liquid brown eyes and young, round face, framed by muddy-blonde hair pulled back in a frizzy ponytail; her fair English-rose skin turned a painful-looking red all over her cheeks and chest and shoulders, welled up in big splotchy patches of inflamed, itching bumps. "Three kids," John explains. "Had to bring them with her. Barely getting by, no support, sick half just from stress and worry, and I—"
"I can't—I can't love you, and lie down with you, and f-fuck you, and not kiss you," John manages, and then takes a breath. "I can't—it can't feel this unequal, it can't feel this
"It was a choice," he says. He is looking John right in the eye. "It was—it was a choice that I made, that I
"How do you," John asks, quiet, and then stops. Kisses Sherlock's cheek, his mouth, the tensing edges of his throat: "or," John says. "Or."
When John inhales his ribs press up into Sherlock's ribs.
A breath. John's heels sink down to the floor. He steps back. Sherlock is still holding the kettle, listing full and heavy in his right hand.
: John gasps—grabs—hair in handfuls starving kissing him
John—John rubs at his forehead, moving—he moves. Turns—towards the fridge and then around towards the sink and—steps, because.
John finds, somehow, that he can't quite all the way close his eyes. This near, Sherlock's eyes are a smudge of green, glittering and verdant: fuzzed and blurred by the screen of his eyelashes, emerald-bright; and John wants—their mouths slipping together. Slipping apart. Nuzzling up against Sherlock's warm cheek he wants—everything, he wants—his glowing welling-up overflowing insides—: and overwhelmed John whispers, "I like you like this"; and, warm against him, Sherlock breathes.
. A slow hot blush creeping up his fair throat. John's arms prickle; his back.
John slides down a bit, rests his head on the back of the sofa. He honestly wouldn't've stopped if the racket of Sherlock flinging himself into the flat hadn't been so startling: he finds he's rather keen to find out what Sherlock would do about finding him having a leisurely bit of a wank on the sofa. He reckons it's likely to be fun.
"I can't, can I?" He presses an trembling hand to his mouth. "He keeps. Running away."
Sherlock ducks his head. Tilts one shoulder up, then the other. "Wouldn't really know," he says; and after a moment John sets his chopsticks down on the table.
John settles back down on his heels, and Sherlock's eyes flick back up to meet his.
Sherlock shakes his head. His
Shaking, he's—
His body is hard, taut: held tensed like a bow before firing beneath him as John—light—licks.
"I mean—I want it," John says, even though it makes his face hot. "I—Paul was hardly an athlete, you know, and Cal's about my size, and then—then it's been mostly women, and they mostly haven't—so I don't know if—but I like it, I—I like that you can push me around and it feels like you mean it," John admits, a little embarrassed. "So—um. I just, I know how much I like that." He swallows. Sherlock is so close. They're lying side by side on Sherlock's bed at midday on a Saturday and the air around them is warm; quiet; still. John's hand on the side of Sherlock's white throat, all of Sherlock's buttons undone: a cocoon. "You being rough with me makes me feel like I'm losing my mind," John confesses, quiet.
Opening up.
"Better, uh." John swallows. "Take it easy, yeah? Or you're going to..." Sherlock's lashes flick, looking up, and John brushes a thumb across them, soft and clean.
Sherlock's mouth quirks. John kisses him, quick, then forces his head down onto Sherlock's shoulder, as Sherlock's arm settles loose 'round his back. He's very warm, even through all his clothes. John's skin is prickling, his cheeks hot. Doesn't fucking care, though, does he?
me," and John gasping helpless cringing shakes his head, and then pulls up stumbling half to his feet.
"And you like that," Sherlock murmurs, so close and so quiet that—that—
"Then it'd just be a mistake Sherlock made in secondary school, and well, we've all done that, haven't we?"
"Yeah," gasping. Eyes prickling up. "Yeah."
Sherlock laughs aloud. "Ohhh": a long rueful noise, between their mouths. John licks— "Mm." Sherlock sighs, rubbing his palm over John's arse, under his thigh, petting back up against him; John's throat cracks, an inadvertent sound, and Sherlock rubs their faces together. "Your hand," Sherlock says, quiet, and John touches his arm, his wrist. Twitching his knee up, petting his hand back over Sherlock's hand: their fingers slide together against his hole.
Sherlock, from people like—but instead he just—decided, that what he wanted mattered more than—than this person he was supposed to care about, and so he thought, oh, just a
John doesn't blush like Sherlock does. He knows that. His chest feels hot, though. His face. He forces his foot still, flat on the floor beneath the table, then slides it until it it stops. Across from him, Sherlock straightens. Flexes the side of his shoe against John's.
"No, and everyone's been running late, today." She smiles, blindingly bright; and John forces down the urge to take a half-step back. "Why, bored already? Don't let Rhoda know, you'll never get another hour break."
!—" as Sherlock curls his fingers deep into him licking—little kittenish—tongue and then
"Only all right?" John asks, and Sherlock laughs. Giggles, really: John rubs at his shoulderblades, delirious, too small for—for the heart of him. Over, he is thinking: over and over. Overflowing. Overwhelmed. Overjoyed.
He pulls back, considering. Sherlock scowls at him: it's not as believable as it otherwise might be, especially since he's also still massaging John's arse. Sherlock's eyes dart to the eyeliner in John's hand; to John's face; to the eyeliner; to John's face; and John pushes back against Sherlock's groping fingers: feeling impish, heart fluttering.
"Yeah." John tucks his hands just beneath the back hem of Sherlock's untucked shirt. Safekeeping.
"Of chasing after a man who obviously takes so little interest in..." Brian pauses, then says, "Let's term it...
"What." He swallows. Cap open. "Do you want me to." Squeezes it into his palm.
, Sherlock'd said; so John touches his stomach: two brushstroke fingertips on his hollowing belly, skimming down the crisp-dusky line of hair trailing from his navel to his button, and below. Sherlock'd asked John to touch his stomach so John touches his stomach: what can it matter, if Sherlock'd changed course halfway through? Palm flat, just for an instant,
John inhales. "Will you be back?" He pulls back, just enough. Looking down: Sherlock's warm soft eyes, Christ. "On Friday, I mean, not yesterday," John clarifies, "before you ask," and Sherlock starts giggling again. "Really," John says. Soft. Touching his cheek. "Friday night. Will you be back?"
Sherlock sighs, shoulders slumping. It makes a knot inside John that John hadn't before noticed start to come undone, slither free, as Sherlock is wriggling his body all over to touch him. Plastered close: thank fuck. John wants to be tied up with him all over, as Sherlock's knees slot between John's knees, and John's shoulder tucks under his cheek. Sherlock makes a little soft noise: spine slumps. He presses his warm mouth soft to John's throat.
"Just the bill." John musters up a smile, and off she goes, probably to return again at the most inconvenient moment imaginable.
John lifts his chin. "So, what all is...
" Sherlock is repeating as John is reaching for him, leaning back, rubbing his fingers into stringy still-wet hair to pull him into an awkward offside kiss. "Mm." Sherlock licks the corner of John's mouth. Sweat springing up everywhere they're touching: their skin slips, sticks. "Hello there," says Sherlock, petting down John's ribs. He sounds happy. A little sex-stupid, already: John's heart beats loud in his chest.
"I'm just sodding delightful," John says, and Sherlock jerks his head to one side, imperfectly hiding a grin in his tea. John resettles his knife at the edge of his plate, more carefully this time. "Enjoying yourself?" he asks.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says, thick. He presses his mouth to John's skin: Christ John feels like his ribs are imploding. "I'm so sorry, John," Sherlock is saying; saying, "I want—I didn't want—I just want to be able to—to
. "I," John gasps. Swallows. "
"We had a bit of a, um." He waves a hand. "Same old, same old. Him running off into—he is trying, you know."
John nods, and grabs the bowl, too.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock tells him, quiet. John nods; but Sherlock shakes his head. "It was awful," he says, "it was awful for you"; and Jesus arsehole motherfucking Christ, John. Can't.
. Christ. By now John's had long enough, he thinks, to translate Sherlock's speaking silences; he isn't idiot enough to think any of that was so much as half about him. Sherlock hadn't ever said,
, and then he sets it aside, and pushes up to his feet, and gathers up the crisp-air-dried bundle of his sheets.
Holding John's hands to the bed. In him Sherlock twists his fingers, kisses John's throat: John whines.
Yeah. "Made myself look like an absolute tit, mostly," John answers. Voice low. "Or an alcoholic panda," he adds, pulled back just enough to watch as watching him, Sherlock's mouth quirks, eyes steady.
. He rubs at his face, bends down; his mouth at the edge of calf and thigh: "Six," Sherlock whispers, as John kisses up, "six—six—
, he had wanted to get away enough to make John angry but he had been been disconcerted enough to leave his hard drive plugged into John's laptop, mounted and open, with a file in use on John's screen. No Sherlocks do that, John would like to assert, but can't, obviously: is that a problem? John doesn't—he doesn't know. He should be angry. Sherlock and his two and a half years of data'd sent 1819 people to prison across the UK, more abroad, but it's still just—just
"Told you I did, didn't I?" John replies. Feeling breathless, a bit.
"I can't say I'm
"No, Gabe's looking after the kids for a night," she says, and then raises her glass. "Better than jewelry, that one."
, "and you were all—warm and relaxed and—and you seemed so happy," and he swallows, unsteady. "And that was lovely, and then—"
; and Sherlock replies,
"It's by the lamp," Sherlock says, too fast. Half into his mouth.
John's heart, a thump. Sherlock's fingers, white and long. He peels the stocking back down to John's heel, careful and slow, then tugs it off and shakes it out, black and airy, wrinkled a bit from where John'd crushed it in his clumsy mauling grabbing hands. Gathering it up again into his fingers, a little gossamer nest, Sherlock explains, "You twisted it when you were pulling it on," low and quiet, and then bends to ease the bundle up over the top of John's foot. To draw it gently up around his ankle, and his calf, and his falling-open bare knee.
He swallows. Kisses him. Sherlock's big hand splaying over John's belly, mouth on his mouth: John says, "Let's fuck."
"You should be clearer," he says. "You'll be clearer, yeah?"
"Yeah," John says. "I mean, I've not seen her since Christmas, so."
He laughs. "Oh, he's fine. Um—traveling. He's in Amsterdam."
John didn't miss that particular self-correction, but he lets it slide. "Yeah," he agrees. "But I thought, maybe." Rubbing: stocking to fair wiry hair to soft, soft, hot velvety skin. "I could improvise."
sexual humiliation checklist; and they'd both known it. But the really horrible part had been that Sherlock'd been
"I don't want to," John says. Unsteady. "I don't—I don't want to, I don't want to come."
"I know you'll have stop," John says, rough. "Still want you to." His hollow mouth moving. "I want—as much—as much as you can, I want you to—"
"The—of June?" John watches Sherlock nod. "2013," he says, confirming; and Sherlock nods again. A blush, creeping across his shoulders, seeping up through his throat. "Christ." John laughs, rubbing the back of his hand across his suddenly-aching forehead.
with Sherlock's big hand a sharp-hot sting in John's scalp as he arching—broken—
At last.
"And that's Ben, Priyanka's partner," Rhoda explains; Ben gives him a beardy nod, as Sherlock folds his coat around himself, even though the restaurant is sticky with the summer and approximately four hundred degrees. "And—do you know Denise?"
, John had said,
John scrubs at the back of his neck, pushes up to his feet. "Come on," he says. Zips up his jacket, hands in his pockets. "It must be past closing, surely, this is a bit—" and then Sherlock stands and picks up his coat, so John is quiet.
Harry'd think it was some sort of a metaphor, probably—always been a bit of a closeted Freudian—but if there were anything they have in abundance—well. It's quarter to five, just, on a Saturday in July. Somewhere outside the clouds, the sun still high. John tears parsley into the colander in sullen damp blobs. The heat from the oven is clogging the kitchen: furious, unnecessary. John thinks about opening a window, despite the rain.
Sherlock isn't looking at him, but he nods. "Actually," he says, "quarter to four."
Sherlock's hand loosens. He slides his arms around him. Pets up his back. "Better?" Sherlock asks, low; even though—but John—but John—
"I do apologize," he drawls, "for thinking that international arms deals were
John touches Sherlock's pale throat, his lovely rough cheek, the soft-bruised shadow under his right eye and the pulled-down corner of his soft pink mouth, and asks, "Want to come upstairs and put them on me?"
"Yes," Mycroft says, "he did,
a bit late."
His voice has that low, thickened quality that John associates with weeping, or sleep. John is thinking about Sherlock lying underneath him, saying,
By the time John's had his breakfast and showered and hoovered and washed his own sheets and put them out in front of all their open windows and cleaned the kitchen and his bathroom and done five dozen sit-ups and pushups and lunges and squats because he couldn't get his head calmed down and then showered again because he'd sweated right through his shirt, it's been four hours, and Sherlock must've got back while the shower was running, because John didn't hear him come in, but now Sherlock is back down in the living room, sitting in his chair just this side of John's drying washing with his ankle crossed over his knee past the empty ottoman, idly testing the flex of a long, thin, rattan cane.
"So m'not going to get you in those little shorts, then," Sherlock murmurs. Squeezing him around the waist.
Knuckles soft on his burning face. Sherlock slides his leg in between John's knees.
Sherlock says, "I think about," and then stops. Inhales. "I like hearing." His skin is tightening up. "What you'll—what you'd do," Sherlock says, tensing under John's hands, clumsy as he says, "if I were to—if I. Just."
It eases.
, a full citation, and a nonzero amount of the surrounding original French text--it was a lot harder than that sounds. Anyway, we finally did
"Thanks," John says, quiet. "For." He sighs, rubs at his forehead, then. Then he tucks his arm around Sherlock's middle and loosens his body into Sherlock's body and presses his face into Sherlock's throat. "For the tea."
it, you feel—I love it, on my—skin—" as John shivers and shudders, helpless, gasping against the edge of Sherlock's mouth as he comes.
"I show you how it's done," Sherlock says, finally.
"John," Sherlock says, very thick; "Fuck," John gasps, still—blinking—and "Yes," Sherlock whispers, "kiss me everywhere, kiss—" gasping— "my—my tits," and
"I couldn't tell," John explains, "until—." He touches Sherlock's right nipple; then his belly in apology, when Sherlock panting arches, his eyes rolling back in his head. A jolt. His—spine. Connected to him deep inside John's body John breathes.
you, when I—"
Sherlock shifts. Turning, so slightly: the press of their faces together. His breath on John's mouth: John's chest tightens. A blood-hot, animal pang.
"What were you playing?" John asks, and Sherlock shrugs.
Sherlock is probably clean enough. Probably something near a half-hour of soap rinsed down all over his feet and he still has to shave—still. Still. "Can you turn towards me?" John asks, quiet; and Sherlock turns. "Do you want me to do your feet?" John asks, and then waits, watching Sherlock's face, for Sherlock to flush across his jaw and his cheekbones a hot and mottled red, before nodding at last, twice, quick; and so John eases himself back down, bracing his hand on the wall.
. At which point Sherlock had narrowed his eyes, drawn himself up, and promptly launched into a detailed and possibly defamatory description of the antecedents, proceedings, and consequences of Brian's divorce; so, now, John can reply,
"It's all right," John says. "You don't have to, if." The table is steady, just under the flat of his hand.
"I." John swallows, heart pounding so hard it vibrates his hands, curled up under him—pulses in his shoulders and cheeks— "I don't, I—"
"I like it, John." Sherlock's voice, pitched low. Just for him. "I thought—I didn't know, that you..."
"Yes," John concedes, "
Sherlock pushes open the door at the landing. He's carrying a bag of groceries, one-handed, coat off and over his arm. He has tired, wide-open all-color eyes.
"And next week?" Underneath him, nearly.
John gives him a kiss. Another. "Sitting in your lap," he explains; and Sherlock pulls back, eyes widening, but John shakes his head. Kisses Sherlock's mouth, his cheek, his temple: all over his lovely flushed face. Sherlock is looking up at him through his lashes, pink-cheeked, dark-eyed: "I like it," John explains, "with you."
Pets. John swallows. Presses his face down to Sherlock's knee and then up again so he can lick. Lick and lick. With Sherlock's slow moving heavy hand on his hair.
John stops. Hand stilled: Christ. Sherlock is breathing hard, almost too tight 'round his fingers. Still coiled into him. Curled up.
Sherlock looks back down at his empty plate, but. "Yeah," he says. Nods.
John inhales, slowly, and then lets it out. "For me," he says.
"It just feels so impersonal, now," John says, finally. "Like—he wants every part of what we've had for the past five weeks, except—except the intimacy."
John asks, "Are you all right?"
John says, "Nat's going to be out starting Wednesday," reluctant. "I can't leave Rhoda to contend with Marcus on her own."
John thinks, for a bit. "I don't know," he says, finally. "Not—I'm not used to them."
Sherlock sighs again. Rubs at his face. "It's just, everything in my bag is dirty or pajamas, I don't—"
John swallows. Rubbing at him inside him while Sherlock gasps and shudders, John tilts his chin: the wetwarm cave of Sherlock's panting open mouth. Sherlock grabs at John's wrist between them, feeling John's tendons working his fingers fitted inside him, wet: when Sherlock arches with him his velvethard cock brushes a brand onto John's skin. "I want to put my hands all over you," John says, helpless, and his heart turns over: "get your fingers wet, Sherlock"; and panting Sherlock reaches up flailing for the lube. To the heavyfast tempo of his heart Sherlock's heart John fucks into him—
Into the silence, Sherlock says, "I know," voice soft.
"Just after Cambridge," Sherlock says. "For about three and a half weeks." He turns back to John, and then gives him a rueful, lopsided half-smile. "I got arrested for breaking into the labs at Imperial College—again—and she sacked me."
John says, "You shock me," gently. Tenderly.
"Oh, well, in that case," John says, and Sherlock's mouth does that lovely almost-S not-smiling thing it does when John's amused him properly: John's throat swelling hot into the heart of his chest. He could get down on the floor, he thinks. He could kiss his thighs through his trousers. Rest his cheek, he thinks, on his knee. Instead he reaches out: right hand over left on the table. Sherlock's mouth softening, pink.
," and then snorts at Sherlock's instant screwing-up horrified face.
The room's cool. Not bright: early, then. Too early, most like. John rubs at his face. He goes to the toilet and splashes water on his face and uses some mouthwash and then fumbles with the glass Sherlock keeps his toothbrush in: fills it three times, drains it twice, then brings the third back into the bedroom for Sherlock, who sits up when John prods him through the duvet and then blinks at the glass like he's not sure what it's for before finally scrambling up to sitting and gulping the lot down in three greedy swallows, his hair sticking up all over, face creased from the pillow and eyes round with sleep, while John lumbers over him and back under the covers.
Sherlock's quiet for a moment, and John turns to look towards him, pillowed hand under his cheek. Still half-floating. Sherlock's rumpled and half-undressed legs folded up under to the side, hands on John's back. Can't read his face.
"Christ," Sherlock gasps, and then digs his hand in between them, claws at the button at the base of John's breastbone, then just gives up and reaches down to grab hold of the hem of John's vest instead, yanking it up and the shirt with it while John struggles to get his cuffs unbuttoned and the collar undone enough so that Sherlock can drag his lot up over his head. John squirms back down against him, Sherlock licking at his jaw while John paws helplessly at his chest, gets his shirtfront open enough to press them together skin to skin, blood-hot and smooth and God, John wants him, every inch. He kneels up, puts his hands on Sherlock's flies: Sherlock whines, arching his hips up, lets John pull his trousers down his long wiry legs. John touches the softest bit of his belly, just above the waistband of his trunks, watching Sherlock's flushed face, and Sherlock nods. Helpless. Hot all over. John bends down, presses his face to Sherlock's abdomen, and then dips his fingers in, and eases Sherlock's pants down while Sherlock does the opposite of helping, trying to kick them off across his black socks, his long ungainly feet.
Unsteadily John pushes himself back up: Sherlock's hands on his elbows, squeezing tight. "Not good?"
When John's finally finished his charting and gets back to his mobile, he has seven unread texts, six of them from Sherlock. Sherlock has met Brian, once: having turned up, late in the day, outside the surgery back when Rhoda was watching her eldest get a maths prize, to collect John for the purposes of disrupting a post-mortem in Basildon. Brian had been talking at John, relentless, as Natalie locked up for the evening, but he had still taken time out of being pompous to mark Sherlock; to say,
—and Greg has rung John twice, which can't mean anything good at all. Instead, in fact, it means that they're after Imogen Wain,
The warm water is still pouring over John's side. Arm and shoulder. Kneeling thigh. He takes a long deep breath, and after a moment he can push himself up, foot flat on the floor and Sherlock's hands sliding onto his ribs, catching under his elbow. Standing again, John lifts his chin; and Sherlock gives him a scratchy, off-side kiss. John inhales, and twists to turn off the water.
John nods. All right. "Like how?" he asks; and Sherlock flushes.
John swallows. "No," he says: enough.
"Not really," he admits.
John's chest feels heavy, and somehow hollow at the same time. Battered, from the inside. Quietly, he says, "I'm glad for that"; and Sherlock looks up at him: his worn-soft, wide eyes.
Sherlock's eyes flick back up to his. "A bit," he says—and then, "rather," quiet.
"That what you do?" John asks. "Tug on that, instead of—instead of letting yourself," and then stops, and Sherlock laughs a little, sounding scraped up.
"I talked to the walls," says Sherlock. Later. "Threw things."
"Sorry," Sherlock mumbles, "sorry—
Greg snorts. "Do you mean Sherlock's broken the habit of a lifetime and deigned to admit that he can tell when someone's trying to get into his cast-iron knickers?" and John can feel himself flushing, hot and painful, all the way up from the knot in his chest, even as Greg is saying, "Shock me."
, with Sherlock's— "
Sherlock is quiet for a long moment before he comes over. Touches John's back. "Out of fighting with you at half eight in the morning?" he says, very quietly. "John."
about? What music would either of them have listened to, as boys, in 1993? What would Sherlock've even looked like, out of uniform, during the summer hols, at seventeen? John doesn't know. He's never seen so much as a childhood snapshot. And John wasn't seventeen, in 1993: but Sherlock
When he looks up from carefully refilling it, down near the bottom of the bottle, Marianne is smiling at him: a half-closed half-open expression; mysterious, queer. "What?" John asks.
"What've you been out doing, anyway?" John can still feel his icicle fingers, pressed against his throat. "Molesting the undead?"
"How thoughtful of him," says Mycroft, with a genuinely painful degree of sarcasm.
"Sherlock," John says, unsteady.
He trails after to the kitchen when John goes to do the washing up, too, and John realizes—ought to've sooner, probably—that Sherlock isn't doing anything but shadowing John about their flat, in that awkward, slightly uncertain way that Sherlock learned (John doesn't want to know how) while he was away. Sherlock stands too close to John by the sink and does the drying up without prompting, so it's probably more traumatizing than usual; John just scrubs at the pan from the stir-fry and doesn't say anything about it. Either Sherlock will come around to mentioning whatever's boiling up inside his massive labyrinthine brain or he won't, and there's not much John can do about it in either case. John scrubs out the sink and dries his hands, then turns—
"Christ." He sighs. "Fuck, I don't know what I'm saying. I don't even know why I brought it up," and silence fills up the car behind the last of the light.
"Well, we still owed her a favor," Sherlock says. Wriggling closer. He's practically sitting on top of John, but John doesn't really mind.
"He doesn't want you to kiss him," George finishes, voice quiet. Not a question, not really, but John nods. Swallowing uselessly, again.
"So," John says. Clears his throat. As Sherlock goes over to his chest of drawers, opens the top. "This thing you're going to show me."
my best friend," Sherlock says; and John can feel his mouth quirk, half against his will.
, shoving them into him in what'd seem a truly slapdash fashion if John weren't already so eager his toes are cramping up against his feet. "Could just," Sherlock gasps, "pull you in and—"
"You're so lovely," Sherlock murmurs, hand tight on his wrist hand opening on his throat, and John gasps, squeezes his eyes shut tight—and Sherlock kisses his jaw, lips parted, sighing, and then brushes a thumb over John's slick mouth. John wants—he wants— "And you just want to be good to me, don't you," Sherlock whispers, tightening—pinning—and John stills, swallowing. Sherlock noses at the side of his nose, rubbing at his lip, and John nods. Nods and nods. Sherlock says, "Open up for me," soft.
"Feeling." John exhales, laughs a little. Rubs at his belly through his wet shirt. "Turned on. Getting hot."
, voice round with a parody of actual, real, emotive sadness, but then immediately added,
"Roll up, then," he says, finally. "On. On your side."
"Jesus." John laughs, stretched tight. "I—fuck." He shifts his weight, kneeling up, thighs aching. His nipples hurt. His stomach is clenched so tight that when Sherlock's left hand strokes over him arse to hip and just brushes the edge of his belly John jerks, fucking helplessly back onto his fingers, a groan ripped out of his throat. "I." John swallows. "If you put your tongue up me m'going to come," he says, unsteady.
Again.
, he'd sent; and then made a promise out of an earlier lie and hit the back button, hit "Edit", hit "Delete".
. Thinking:
Sherlock touches the pavement, then lifts his hand to his face, then holds his fingers out to John. "What do you smell?" he asks, voice low, and so John sniffs cautiously, frowning.
him? He has the sick, sinking suspicion that he
"Fuck, I don't—" John swallows. "I don't know, it feels—" Sherlock palms over the head of him and John flinches, jerking hard. "Shit—sorry," John gasps, while Sherlock is still inhaling; Sherlock saying, "No, no, it's—fine, I won't—" and then pulling his hand up to John's abdomen, touching him soft, in circles, soft.
"You can," he says. It comes out thick. "You can touch me however you like": and Sherlock makes another low agonized animal noise and then slowly, shakingly, starts unbuttoning John's flies.
; he hadn't said,
Apropos of nothing, "You'll have to hold this up out of my way," Sherlock says; and the hard end of the cane scrapes the hem of John's dressing gown up the back of his thigh: "
Upstairs again after tea and Sherlock is quiet. Stays quiet, really; John'd think he was working on the case if he didn't follow John into the kitchen at seven looking lost, out of place. It's strange, John is realizing, to see his dangling empty hands. John's got an onion out of the fridge, but he stops there and asks, "Do you want do it?" and Sherlock inhales. Scrubs his hands through his hair.
"But you're my best friend," John says, unsteady; and Sherlock looks up. Tongue thick John explains, "You're
"You're shaking," Sherlock says, gently.
John slides down onto the carpet, shoves the coffee table well out to the side for the room. "As much as I can."
"Yeah." John squeezes his thigh. "Yeah, it's fine, just—"
"I'll do it," Sherlock tells him; John groans, and Sherlock pets as his belly. "I'll do it if you want me to."
: that at seventeen he'd've been smooth-cheeked, still,
Then Greg says, "Right, well, I'll let you get to it," not quite light and brisk, but very nearly; and John feels a hot, harsh rush of gratitude and affection, driving everything else.
Down at the foot of the bed, John can hear Sherlock breathing, not answering. John rolls up a bit, looking down at him: still propped up awkwardly with his laptop and his elbows and the lump of his duvet, hair sticking up all over and splotches of beard burn all over his thighs. His face is still, carefully blank; but his throat bobs, twice; and John realizes, embarrassed, that he can tell what Sherlock is thinking. It feels invasive. Obscurely unfair.
"Honestly," John says, breathing deep. "As many times as you can manage before the lube runs out, but—but I need a glass of water, first, if you plan on getting a more accurate count."
of sex, over the past five weeks, and he didn't—for most of that, he didn't want to come, he wasn't going to come, and I—I was—yes, I wanted him to, but I knew he wouldn't, and I wasn't going to push it, and it—that was all right, it was—I could—wait, if, or—or if he didn't, ever, that could be—I could live with that, because he—because there were bits of it that I could tell that he—that he wanted, really

." They are talking about Rhoda, Chloe on the line. His palms feel damp. He rubs them against the silk hanging over his thighs. The front has already come mostly open. No wonder Sherlock always just leaves the tie undone.
: he must have, mustn't he, when Sherlock came to Rouen; he left Alex Adams in Amsterdam in favor of a country he's always loathed and a job making food he has hardly ever been inclined to eat and some space of trying, without success, to get his body to the body of a man who was all the while finding new and inappropriate ways to grieve for him, for another version of him, just apart from him, set away from him: John's body, which had been drowning without his body, just across an achingly small strip of sea; and
John is outside—outside? why did he—to NSY perhaps, or—his feet stop, and shuffling to the side in case of—traffic, or—he tucks his mobile under his ear and digs out his notebook. Old case notes—shopping lists—an almost-empty ABC chart—
Sherlock breathes. Kisses his cheek.
me," and Sherlock's teeth clack into his, blood-sharp and burning while John thrashes, helpless. "I want." John swallows. "Can you, can you lie down with me," with his voice squirming in his throat but Sherlock is already easing himself down behind him, his body warm enough to feel through bare air even before he presses a kiss down to John's shoulder, touching the base of John's fingers at the base of John's spine—
"Christ," John is saying: heartfelt, overwhelmed; beneath him Sherlock makes a little hot sound, and John bends to kiss his sternum, and Sherlock arches to meet his mouth. John tongues light at a nipple, rubs his cheek against his collarbones, nuzzles back up to kiss him, open, open-mouthed, open wide all over: in—come into—and when Sherlock hooks his leg around John's suspender belt John's vision blurs, seeing—seeing the two of them, kindling-caught—
John can't do anything but watch. Helpless. Enough, he is thinking, it's enough; it should be—
In other news, I couldn't find any decent practice recordings of the violin part of the Bruch, and no one would ever professionally record it without the orchestra, so you all will just have to settle for Itzhak Perlman and imagine away all that pesky extra instrumentation, I guess. I'm sure it'll be a hardship.
"At least," Sherlock whispers back, "stay—stay, like that," and John nods, blinking.
It is, he knows, as good as any long-winded confession: of all the
John nods, digging around in the mess of the side table for a pen. "Not London."
"And." John swallows: sandpaper throat. "And so."
, twisting and licking and lighting him up until he can barely breathe and then Sherlock
, Sherlock hissing-wincing half in sympathy half laughing at him while his left hand comes up to cradle the back of John's skull. John presses his mouth to Sherlock's mouth hard, hard, hard heart beating hard, hard, hard as though so hammered they would be—melded, fused together, lip to lip and tongue to tongue.
"It had the great advantage of keeping me out of sight." Sherlock's voice is casual, too. "And it left me tired." A pause. Then, not wholly necessary: "It helped me sleep, sometimes."
"Whatever we like." John brushes their lips together, apart, together-apart, hot and prickling: "Whatever you like." Kissed half raw. "I—" John can't get it out of him. "Anything," he says, inadequate, at last.
John laughs, working his elbow underneath himself, leaning up. "What's the rush?" he asks. His voice sounds strange. He laughs.
It's still too sweet. John drinks it anyway.
me a drink"; and just like that clouds breaking John's chest lightens, and he laughs, rueful, looking into her empty basket bumping his empty basket and then looking up: "Nothing perishable?" he asks; and she laughs.
. Adding:
Sherlock is looking at him offside, glancing down under his long pale eyelashes while he burnishes the bottom of the saucepan to a high shine. Mouth twisted, a little: a small, locked-and-hidden sort of an expression.
Sherlock doesn't answer. Just pulls back enough to draw John flush against him, resting his face on John's head. With his face tucked into the collar of Sherlock's coat John can smell all the familiar post-case stale-sweat unwashed smell of him: John wraps his arms tight around his crumpled black shirt and narrow ribs, and squeezes.
Sherlock uncrosses his arms, reaches into his pocket. Pulls out his mobile and thumbs at the screen, then turns it to face John, still sitting crosslegged on the floor.
John leans back against the edge of the work surface. "So you're... not breaking up with me." His chest, achy: he wants to fold his arms over it. Press it. in.
Sherlock is silent. After a moment, he nods.
"Well, she certainly didn't disabuse me of the notion," Marianne says; pink-cheeked and smiling; as from John's end of the table, Tariq is leaning in to assure Tom, "Not too respectable." He exchanges a glance with John, to which John only just raises an eyebrow, smiling.
"I should let you up," Sherlock says.
"It will be if—if you tell me it is," John says, clumsily, "But I have to—to be really clear about this, all right?"; and Sherlock makes a short, pained sound. "I'm not going to leave, all right?" John says, thick and unhappy. "Even if you—if you decide—"
"Come on, then," John says. "Close the door."
Sherlock. And Sherlock won't give a bad idea up once he's got it, is the problem.
It takes him a bit to look back up, but when he does, Sherlock is regarding him: birdlike, unreadable. Sherlock looks back down, snapping the violin case shut before pushing up to his feet and taking it over to tuck it underneath his chair.
strange, as though after all these years of finding themselves in more or less exactly the same position, the warm fragrant weight of Sherlock leaning against him, a little bit turned on and not doing anything about it, could possibly be strange just because John'd finally got on his knees and rubbed his face all over Sherlock's cloth-covered erection. He's done stranger things with Sherlock, after all.
The room settles. A muffled, fabricky sort of semi-silence: next door, Cleo's client laughs: a young, bright, bubbling thing; and John closes his eyes.
Sherlock grabs him by the hair. "Ought to do it," he is saying, pulling John's head up. "Ought to give you just what you ask for," and then he hits him, open-palmed, twice: John moans, squirming on his thigh. "Or maybe I ought to just pull you off, hm?" Sherlock is breathing marathon-hard, hips shoved tight to him. "Ought to just hold you here and tug on your cock 'til you make a mess of the floor and then what, hm?" John whines, wriggling: Sherlock hard through his trousers against his hip. Sherlock bites his cheek and asks, "Make you get down and lick it up?"
"You can," swallowing: "you can do anything you want to me," John tells him; and Sherlock groans against John's jaw, pulling him—back, pulling him—
on him: sliding down John's heating-up stubbled face and damp throat and Sherlock takes a half-step towards John's absurd squared chest in slices bare and covered, again, toward Sherlock's tie at John's waist sliding loose, might as well've not even bothered to—and John wants it,

Normalcy.
"; so John puts his fingers in his mouth and rubs at him wet and trembling pushing slow-steady in—in—
In bed with the lights out he feels—not strange, precisely. The pillow still smells like Sherlock's hair. John doesn't even particularly like sharing a bed with another person, but it'd been nice, hadn't it, to have Sherlock there, just for sleeping. It'd been...
—odd, really. The things that you remember. Such as: Sherlock bent over John's laptop, where he'd probably been—
John who is scraping-crouching-cluttered above him bending down to trade the taste of him onto his tongue with his hand splayed flat across Sherlock's fair flushed chest and his roaring, hammering heart. John. —'s whole body, opening—open, barely opening—"
John lifts his head. "About," he echoes.
"Jacobs got her second black belt," Sherlock says. "Judo, this time."
how you taste Sherlock
"I ought to've brought the duvet," he realizes.
. None of it, of course, had been anything John could counter or remark: not without opening himself up to recitations of a history he hadn't wanted anything to do with, back in October of last year; not without shocking Cal and his Eton vowels and his loftily inflexible trust-funded socialist ideals; not while Cal and Michael and Brian were all so obviously delighted by one another, with the candyfloss-uncritical pleasure taken in learning that a friend enjoys the company of other people exactly like you. By the time Brian and Michael'd finally paid precisely half the bill and left to go relieve their latest unreliable babysitter of her charges, John'd felt hot all over, overworked, strung up somewhere between violence and humiliation and rage; so he'd shoved Cal straight from their goodbyes at the door of Brian and Michael's minicab, and across to the other side of the street.
He drops his mobile, shoves open his jeans. Gets his hand down them, fast, gets himself out and thumbs out,
"Yes," says Sherlock. Long pale lashes: he looks up from John's mouth to meet his eyes.
, John thinks; and says, "I want to kiss you all over"; and Sherlock moans.
. In November when Sherlock had come back different, he'd stayed, at first, very briefly with Mycroft; then on a lilo in 221C; then—elsewhere, for a bit; and then he had asked, very quietly,
"You keep." Sherlock swallows. "Touching your—your abdomen, when—"
, sounding—
John scrapes teeth against him. "What?"
out of it," closer as John snarls, "me on my knees and—"
Sherlock nods, hard. Repeats, "Seven," rough. John rubs thoughtful fingertips around the rim of his navel: Sherlock doesn't shiver, doesn't gasp, and John strokes down toward his button: the point, he thinks, of a question mark, written onto Sherlock's skin. If their positions were reversed—
He's expecting—an answer, possibly direct. Innocence, he will suppose, in retrospect; but of course Sherlock knows more about sex than on the surface he shows: John might've doubted that Sherlock would take it for the standard it is, but John's mobile buzzes, indecently quick, for Sherlock to tell him,
"I have no idea," John says. Leaning forward. "Because I—there's what
." He rubs his face. Shaking his head, half laughing at himself. "All right. I—may have deserved that."
"Hm." Sherlock is tucking his knee between John's thighs and pressing
"No, it's fine," John says. "I was fine."
," thick; and Sherlock says, "Hm," and then digs his fingers in: five perfect bruising points of contact, dragging tight at the skin of John's scalp. John gasps—gasps— "Can you breathe?" Sherlock asks; "Yes," John gasps; and "I don't believe you," Sherlock says, "You'll just have to count them off"; and then shoves his cock into him, hard.
John shrugs, but he puts on the gloves. "Clara always said that was one of the best things about cooking."
John squeezes his eyes shut tight. Breathes deep.
for Sherlock to see—
This is, John reflects, probably, in retrospect, predictable.
His mobile buzzes against his cheek, and into his ear Bianca confirms that Mr. Holmes is indeed sending a car; and John thanks her, rings off. Checks his texts.
(See the end of the chapter for
On the sofa at home John sits in an empty flat near bursting his skin. His mobile quiet in his pocket:
Sherlock says, "While you get ready for bed."
Sherlock kneels up, breathing hard. Hollow. Somehow John gets his eyes open, a bit. Sherlock touches his cheek.
"You want me to keep you stuffed like that all night?" Sherlock asks, in that same soft voice.
"I am summoned to the presence," Sherlock grumbles. Hands. His leg is slipping back between John's legs arms tucked around-wedged under John's torso, long warm feet stashed comfortably up against-underneath John's calves; and then, at last, Sherlock settles. Nose wedged against John's jawline; swallowing billows of breath.
"Come on, Sherlock," John says, finally. Sherlock's not been this quiet about anything since just after he came back: it aches. "You were—this morning, you—"
Sherlock's mouth pulls down, but he nods.
"—might as well get into practice—oh come
He's looking. John inhales through his nose, gets his fist around himself under his bottoms and pulls. Breathing in hard slow deep, lets it out, fucking into his loose hand under cotton while Sherlock watches, his long white hand just resting against the back of John's chair. John is suddenly split, pinned between awareness of Sherlock's bare feet and the still-damp ends of his hair and the warm-plush-yielding memory of his body wrapped tight around John's bursting body and the weight of Sherlock's dark creamy voice—bricks and stones—when he'd said,
John touches his cheek. "Because it turns me on," he says, "
John bends to kiss Sherlock's shoulder: salty. soft. "And what about—pretending," he asks, quiet; and Sherlock—
, how can John spend this much energy on—on just—wanting—just his stupid fucking mouth, it's just a
"Later?" —Sherlock's voice wobbles, rights itself— "I, oh."
As narrow as he is, Sherlock's shoulders are firm with dense muscles, all over. Before. Before—before Rouen. Before he'd left, Sherlock'd inclined toward too thin, still; even with two years of John following him about and barking at him to eat; a slimness that edged toward the perilous when he'd skipped too many meals too many days in a row; but when he'd come back his body had been different. More muscled. More solid: a body that did more things, more different things; that still ran through alleys and scaled fire escapes; but also punched, almost competently, a Chelsea bar owner-cum-serial rapist in the face, while John was still stumbling up shouting after them, fumbling vision sparking with his gun. A body that three years earlier had hints of softness here and there that'd felt almost childish, to John, back then; but had since been stripped away. When Sherlock'd come back he had looked—
"I haven't the first bit of experience that would permit me answer that question," says Sherlock, crisp.
"I have to shower," Sherlock says.
"But—just now," John says, "you—it felt like you were. Away." Useless. The inadequacies of language; but beside him Sherlock is taking a long, slow breath. "Because—you
and take him upstairs and coax him into the bath knees legs draped over dark-eyed as John knelt on the tiles with a razor against Sherlock's ankle and then dragged it up—up—up; or, thunderous John thinks, he could ask,
, he commands: he breathes. Except for that one time John doesn't make promises he can't keep. They didn't fuck, last night. Sherlock spent two nights in Amsterdam and had already known and then fell asleep in John's bed kissing John with the lights on, snuggled up with him as soon as he woke up: breathe.
, with—on Sherlock's— "Can I," he says, thick, "cold, that must be freezing, can I," and then closes his eyes breathing hard-hard-hard as Sherlock fits it carefully into his mouth. Bowing down. His forehead pressed to Sherlock's jaw as he sucks, teeth loose, knelt up with his fingers tucked into Sherlock's blood-hot body as Sherlock curls his wet fingers on the nape of John's neck, his left hand vanished under that long bent-up right thigh.
"Why not?" Sherlock asks, from above the stopwatch screen. "You said it yourself, we've nothing better to do."
." Sounding—not frustrated. Halfway to despair. Hands hidden in front of himself: why, John can guess.
Pulling back away from him Sherlock says, "Come here," with his hands all over him hips and belly and thighs easing John's unsteady knees back on the mattress while his hands slip, tractionless, on the headboard. "I need," John says unsteadily; "Yeah," Sherlock says, "come here, lie down," and eases John down onto his back onto the towels with his thighs bending up still wet and cool and Sherlock red-faced sitting himself up cross-legged between them, pulling John's hips only-just up onto his folded feet. Sherlock opens the lube. Pets at the rim of John's arse: John sucks in a long, slow breath, which does less than nothing to actually calm him down.
"I'd like it if you could tell me," Sherlock murmurs. Bends down. Kisses his spine—John gasps, burning face, shoving

"I like it when you're with me," John says, very quietly.
," gasping as Sherlock flips him over onto his back.
"I told you," he says, "part of the floor comes up."
He strides over to his music stand. Rifles through the sheet music he'd complained about when Mycroft'd given it to him at his birthday with his back to John and his shoulders taut, the violin still in its case on the floor. Shoulders up. Back hunched.
you were—and I wish—I wish—I've wished for ages I hadn't done that to you, that you didn't have to—to go through that, but you did and I did it to you and I can't—"
"I want you to kiss me while you do it," Sherlock says, too loudly, and then lets out a short, hard-edged breath.
Sherlock doesn't answer. John finishes the bowl, hands it over.
"What's Sherlock afraid of?" George asks.
"I note," John says, with precision, "that you didn't say that you don't masturbate
Inhaling. Again Sherlock nods. He drops his hand from his face: his dark wide soft-edged shining-blinking eyes, Christ.
"Lube's downstairs," John reminds him, but he pushes his thumb against him. Sherlock opens for it, easy: and fuck,
Gasps.
John bends. Rests his mouth against Sherlock's warm cheek. "I'm sorry," he repeats.
John puts his arms around him. He presses their bodies together as he pulses and throbs. He is still sounding high and clear, the pure contact-caught tone of a tuning fork or a bell: the shell of his body still chiming around his bones and his breath set ringing by and covered in Sherlock entirely. The tap of that gong-strike touch, still echoing; tucked away where no one can mar the fingerprints, safe inside.
"Demonstrably false," John counters, and Sherlock sighs. Lifts his head.
John licks his lips. He says, "All right," and Sherlock grabs his wrist instead, and tows him through the kitchen.
He isn't—after he says it he thinks, almost, that he'd meant it as a joke; but he didn't, and it wasn't, and it doesn't sound like one: not with Sherlock setting the ties on John's duvet and then looking up at him, not confused. John touches the smear of his eyeliner anyway. Sherlock pushes himself up onto an elbow and kisses him, quiet. Soft. John's whole body feels tidal: surging, between breaths.
He touches Sherlock's neck. His pale finely-muscled shoulder, warm in John's hand.
"Shh." John bumps their knees together. "She can wait, can't she?" He is rubbing the lotion warm between his hands.

"A month ago," Sherlock says, low and honest, "I would've said it felt safe."
he catches himself thinking; and then realizes that his face bent forward is red and prickling and hot; all the while tugging this way and that on his stockings, trying to figure out how on earth anyone's expected to get their seams in anything approaching a straight line.
John can see his own mouth tug up in the mirror before he even feels it. "You'd prefer a tattoo, I reckon," he says, and hot on his neck Sherlock exhales. John adds, "'Property of'," gently stroking his thumb along the jutting bone of Sherlock's lovely, angular wrist.
—and, startled, John starts to laugh. Bubbling up from inside him: Christ, how he adores him. Legs tangling together rolling around belly to belly while they kiss.
It's really too warm to be pressed together on the sofa like this, but. Sherlock's long fingers tuck into his arch. "Done?" Sherlock asks, in the idle way of someone not feeling idle about it at all.
Looking at him. His red face, ducked down, his hunched shoulders and his—his greasy hair. The stubble coming in patchily all over his jaw.
"I do want you to put the stockings on me," says Sherlock, very quietly, then adds, "I mean—," flushing, as John pets his hair back from his face. He looks—embarrassed. Simple; easier, that. Not afraid, John doesn't think, as Sherlock whispers, "Now, I mean," so red he nearly glows with it; and John breathes, nodding, rocking over onto his hip, and then twisting himself around he reaches down to the floor for the bag.
"You didn't owe me anything," he says, low and hot and fierce, "you didn't—"
"I," Sherlock says. "I—what does
"Well, how was I to know?" Helplessly smiling; exasperated. "They don't come with a manual, either."
"Can't do that on my own, though, can I."
"I'm sorry," John says, fast, because he knows "I didn't mean to run"; but Sherlock shakes his head.
"Yeah." John is curling his fingers against Sherlock's shoulder. Open and closed. Open and closed.
Slice all around a ripe peach and it comes free from the stone with a twist: Sherlock's hands on him crack him open, and John's elbows buckle. Inhaling. Inhaling, with Sherlock's long hands on his hips, nudging up behind him, pressed only just against him until John presses back and it presses
Sherlock's eyes are closed and his face is red and John can feel the red-rubbed mark of Sherlock's mouth all over his own face and his chin and "Better, now?" John asks, as lightly as he can, as he trails his knuckles, bump-bump-bump, down the long line of Sherlock's shoulder and chest and abdomen, scraping his thumbnail along Sherlock's sparse fairish hair.
"Six for skipping history," John says, "two for being out of uniform," and then stops.
John swallows. Reaches back, pets at Sherlock's hair. Twisting: his cheek, his chin. He is, he is finding, almost entirely unsurprised. After a moment, very gently, he says, "Rain check?"

Tuesday is not tremendously different.
John does know how it is, actually, but that was a long time ago. "How many prostitutes, precisely?" he asks, and Sherlock hums.
Disclaimer: not a mental health professional; I write therapy from the perspective of a person who has had a lot of therapy, that's all. Huge thanks to both
"Well," Sherlock says, "I do... I mean—that is."
"Eight," Sherlock breathes, in reply.

"But," John, painful, says: "I can't."

"But it's just not—fair, is it?" John asks. "For me to always—always get just what I want, just because it's easier for me, because I'm not—I don't know, quite so—so invested, in sex, as he is, when he—because I can spend months getting screwed six times in a week by five different strangers and he's knotted up over asking me to—or," he says, shifting forward, "or, because he can read me like the sodding
John is still holding Sherlock's idiotically overpriced lube. The third strap of the harness is still slack, sliding down Sherlock's hips, and Sherlock's back ribs are lifting with deep, almost-silent breaths and John is kneeling on his bed. If he were alone he'd lie on his back but he isn't, so he doesn't, just flicks open the lube and gets his hand wet. Braces his weight on his right arm and reaches back: it's harder like this. His mouth suddenly sour beneath his tongue. Saliva leaking up. He gets himself wet—wet enough, he—he's open enough, he doesn't need—Sherlock turns back towards him, black silicone jutting out, face turned down, looking down as he tugs at the end of the waist strap. John sits back on his heels and curls his sticky hands on his thighs.
"Stop, please," John gasps, desperate; and heavy and sticky and hot all over, Sherlock goes still. John twists his face against him. Blood in torrents with gratitude he kisses Sherlock's shoulder once. Twice.
Swallow. John swallows. Is staring. Staring at the wall. Their wall. Sherlock warm underneath him. Arms warm around him, face warm in his throat: John wants—to take care of him: absurd. He wipes one shaking hand across his own wet face. Down to Sherlock's silent shoulder. Hanging on.
"I promised you wouldn't rush me," Sherlock says, very quietly; and John huffs, a half of a laugh puffing against Sherlock's mouth.
"John," Sherlock whispers; and John shakes his head. Takes a breath. He says, "I'd like to think I—that I, that I chose, that I, I didn't
—I've talked about this on

; and then,
John kisses him. Sherlock's mouth is rough at the edges. He smells a bit like spearmint and cigarettes, doesn't taste like anything but his slick familiar tongue. The position's awkward, kneeling up on the wobbling-squashing unstable sofa cushions with Sherlock twisted towards him, face angled up; and his hand falls suddenly on John's back and it would be so easy to—John could—if sliding over to sit across his thighs—
John groans. He can't—
"The salad," he says, instead. Clears his throat. "What can I..."
In silence, phosphorescing. They are touching they are touching they are touching: that tremulous impermanent sensation, burning into him. Everywhere between them: their welling-up light.
Sherlock is resting his cheek against John's shoulder. Face tucked into his throat. Always does, John thinks, aching; always is, whenever they're. Arranged. Like that. How hard it must be to be him, John is thinking, petting the backs of Sherlock's shoulders, his neck, his hair; and to be also so tall.
"If you like." John swallows. "I'd do whatever you want," he says, hushed.
"Are you eating your breakfast?" Sherlock asks, curious. A little muffled.
Sherlock is watching him. Breathing slowly, behind his faded flush. "Custom," he says, finally; and John snarls, "Did I ask?" and mouth pressed tight together Sherlock straightens, shoulders squared, so John kneels back and puts his hands flat on the duvet, like Sherlock'd said. Between his braced hands is a broad dark wet mark, the slick smear of the spilt lube.
—he doesn't know.
"Not me, Mikey," Tariq says; as John says, "Oh, ta," half-laughing; and Natalie glares at him.
He stops. His throat feels full. His chest.
Sherlock is quiet for a long moment. Marshmallowy. "I prefer men," he says, finally. "But sometimes it's easier, having sex with women."
"And when you came back," she says, "you thought—what, I'll just... go into general practice, or—"; and John says, "When I came back I spent two years working with Sherlock, full time"; and "Ahh," she says, her shoulders rolling back, settling.
, and then, hesitating, at last said,
Still.
Sherlock presses his forehead to John's collarbone, silent.
"Comfy?" Sherlock asks, a quirk in his voice; but Christ, his hands. John's arse is still sticking up in the air, come all over his shirttails and the carpet at his knees: fuck, what an idiot he must look—thighs tight—but Sherlock squeezes down hard on the nape of John's neck, holds him still.

"Yeah," John says.

Inhales.
The waitress still isn't paying them any mind. Most likely for the best. Their chopsticks cross, and Sherlock murmurs, "I had a dreadful crush on the senior coach."
"That won't stop him," Sherlock says bitterly, hunching further. Even his hair looks depressed.
as John—panting—blinks. Blinking—sweat all over, "I can't, I can't, I can't—
"Well, now that you're laughing at me," Sherlock says, but it's utterly without rancor: he's blushing, but grinning; sheepish and charming when John twists around to kiss his rough-edged mouth, his flushed cheeks.
Careful, and the floor on the landing stays silent. Bathroom, shadowed. He could just piss and get back into bed, but he can smell his own body: the stale-sharp smell of a day at the surgery and a crowded restaurant with tight-closed windows and a night half-glued to another person in London's brief effort at sticky summer heat: he wants a shower. He fishes the carrier bag out of the cupboard, just to get the lingerie off the rod: the bag is still full of tissue paper from the shop, one parcel at the bottom still tidily wrapped. He heaps everything up on top. Then he runs the water almost full cold with the door to the landing open, the switch off. He wants the faint trickle of cooler air from his open bedroom window, with no fear of the light trickling back. The spray batters down on his shoulders. It feels good. He wipes cool water off his still-hot face, breathing deep. Past anything he can see, Mrs. Hudson's filmy white curtains must flutter, still, just above Sherlock. Lying shadowed, fast asleep. John rinses soap off his armpits. Turns the water off.
"Well," he says, "I think you'd better fetch a chair, then, Watson," so John turns to fetch a chair. Not his chair, clearly. One of the chairs from the table. Sturdy. Better than the ottoman, probably; with the ottoman he'd probably just constantly slide off. He's half-hard from their kissing. His dressing gown is hanging open: he wonders if Sherlock will want him to take it off, or just pull it up. He ought to've got dressed. That'd've been better: having to open his belt, unfasten his flies; push his trousers down before he bent over. Having to hold up the tails of his shirt. He sets the chair down, and then refastens the tie of his dressing gown, tight.
Enveloped: John breathes. In Afghanistan the sky had been a kind of huge he'd never understood before: the blanket of space above them; the stars so bright they threw shadows, on new-moon nights. It'd been—terrifying, almost: to see it for the first time, all that—
"Mikey and Natalie shared a house with a bunch of the other kids on their course, until Natalie got her own flat in May," he explains. "It's how we wound up with Natalie in the first place."
Sherlock's eyelids lower. Regarding him. "As long as you stop when I say—

"So you could beat me," Sherlock says.

"Yes," John whispers, and then—whines—
He watches Sherlock's face shift around.

"Seven?" John asks, feeling him warm all over: stuck together, front to back. Fingers caught.
interferes. I might best like neither but if faced with the choice I much prefer the fussing, thank you."
Sherlock glances over, back down. Murmurs, "Who said anything about getting rid of you?"
"Morning, DCS Donnell," he says, as she shakes it, murmuring, "Mr. Watson"; and Sherlock glares at her, then at John, and then turns away with a sniff.
"Yeah," she says. "I know."
"Yeah," John agrees. Round-full his throat, Sherlock's warm sweet face, his mouth. "That's definitely," John murmurs, kissing, "what I want from you."
"Well," Sherlock says.
"Pillock," John says, laughing: bending, licked kiss and feeling every—fucking—micrometer as Sherlock groans and presses up into him hands on him splaying wide: squeezing, pulling him apart. John swallows. Holding tight held up breathing out his mouth on Sherlock's mouth as Sherlock underneath him fucks up. "Like that," John asks. Gasps. Red-hot face against his face Sherlock nods and nods. Panting dragging John—justbarely down and pushing—up and John shudders, throat tight. Hot-scraped thick hard inside him held—still, and—his shaking arms.
Breathes.
Sherlock swallows. Swallows. "Yes," he says, quiet, and John pulls his thumb out. Brushes, gentle, down across the bone of Sherlock's lovely stubble-rough jaw.
Focus. This is: Sherlock, better than naked, in his bed. This is: Sherlock's leg, long and silky in a stocking; prickled all over with the ends of his leg hair: denser than John's, but fair. John tugs the stocking up taut and Sherlock sighs, wriggling closer. His lovely long legs draped over John's lap. John wraps the tie around him, draws it tight.
Sherlock balls up the dishtowel on the work surface.

"I think," he says, a little uncertainly, "that—we oughtn't to talk about that"; and then watches her tilt her fair oval face: regard him, unflinchingly, bright behind her glasses her sharp bird eyes.

The air feels shockingly cold. John's got precome smeared all over his grimly determined half-hard cock and his belly and his balls; Sherlock rock-hard and dripping between them, touching nothing, while Sherlock gulps for air, shivering, eyes closed.
And it's good air, today, isn't it, just past ten in the morning of a Sunday. Fresher. Cooler and clean. Through the window it rustles Mrs. Hudson's curtains, slipping in, smooth-blue and fresh, across John's dried-crunchy flat-smoothed clean sheets: with Sherlock out John hasn't much to do so he ought to—he ought to dust, or hoover, or—or do his washing, or—or go—
"Come back," Sherlock says, quiet; and John turns his face against Sherlock's throat, back up to his mouth, and Sherlock gives him miles-deep kiss after miles-deep kiss fucking him with two fingers until John's elbows are trembling and his breath is coming in rabbit-fast pants and then Sherlock whispers, "I want you to sit on my face."
John rubs both hands over his face. "Fuck," he says aloud, pointlessly; then sits up, fast. Stands. Unbuttons his trousers; his shirt, halfway, then yanks it and his vest together up over his head, static crackling in his hair. He shoves down his trousers and his pants, sits to pull off his socks, and then lies back down flat on his back and glares at his erection. It appears to be unfazed by his irritation. John sighs, and rolls over to open the drawer in his bedside table. The cap on his lube sticks a bit, but he gets it open. Gets his hand wet and grits his teeth and gets to it, since that's apparently what he's going to do. He's perfectly capable of getting himself off—and why not, really, not as though he's not got plenty of material, between Sherlock's long pale hands and his long pale legs and his skin, flushing up, as, as he touches himself through his sheets—
: what does he know, really? That a series of bomb threats have been issued, against Kew Gardens—Big Ben—Westminster Abbey—at least one other location he's forgotten but, most recently, the London Eye, and the British Museum. He knows that Sherlock, near ten, left Baker Street alone, ostensibly to obtain information from a colleague of Mycroft's called Lucy Matley. He also now knows that Lucy Matley would not in fact be willing to speak to Sherlock Holmes; if Sherlock'd truly meant to get information from her office, then either he'd've had to have deployed John to get it for him, or he'd really meant to go to Ramya Gupta, instead of directly to Lucy Matley. But he had said, quite specifically, that he was going to track down an alias, when he'd emailed the photo containing their best lead to Greg and cc'ed John from John's own email account: evidence. A reasonable informational chain. He had also, at the time, been behaving somewhat atypically: has, John knows, since yesterday. Ever since. That is, John thinks, perhaps unrelated: but still a relevant piece of evidence. Data, of a kind. Since leaving this morning, Sherlock has failed to reply to John's texts (somewhat unusual, but not unheard of) or pick up the phone (less surprising); but he'd also left his drive mounted on John's laptop and flushed pink and lovely before he'd told John to go upstairs for his gun. Distracted. Out of sorts. Sherlock doesn't really want to hurt John: John knows this; and Sherlock knows
"Just because I was Long Ben Avery on that stakeout in Chelsea," Sherlock argues hotly. "That was months ago."
John nods, dragging Sherlock's thigh up. "I like it too," he says. "But I could stop for a while, if you want": his hand skating over Sherlock's bony bent knee.
"Let me up," Sherlock says, very quietly; and so John rolls onto his side.
: heart-tumult up and over and under and through while he forces his eyes open, looks up: Sherlock's face.
Sherlock licks his lips. "I could—"
"I." Sherlock swallows. "I think—it would be, except that before you'd—four. Four."
"Just curious. That's excellent," George says. "What about the last thing you asked him for that he didn't give you?" and John.
"—and provides a safe forum in which to—the little pictures really make me take them terribly seriously, I must say," Sherlock says, and turns his laptop around so that John, squinting, gets a glimpse of, inexplicably, a skull with vampire fangs, and then Sherlock pushes his laptop away across the mattress and turns up onto his hip, rubbing at the back of John's calf. "Are you asleep?"
"Egotist." John strokes back up over the edge of his chest. "This?"
: Sherlock inhales a long slow-steady breath, when John turns his hand. Knuckles rubbing up-over, up-over, like Sherlock'd rubbed him with his knuckles, hard through the thin lining of the pocket of John's jeans.
, John thinks. God. Christ. "And?" John asks, quiet. Eleven: mouth under Sherlock's hesitating half-open mouth he shivers. Fourteen.
After a moment, Sherlock says, "I didn't learn it."
"Oh, one or two things," John murmurs; but Sherlock is already saying, "When I was in Korea at Christmas—"; so John just says, "Mm-hm," which is, really, significantly more encouragement than Sherlock needs to launch into full-on discursive pedant: something, John thinks, to go up on The Science of Deduction later, probably. Watching Sherlock a half-meter away scrub himself off while lecturing John on bathing customs from around the world makes him feel—amused. Half-indulgent: the case at Christmas aside, John can't imagine the etiquette of public baths in southeast Asia has come up all that often in the course of Sherlock's various and sundry mostly-European criminal investigations, but he can't, of course, be entirely certain. He'd got Sherlock nothing for Christmas since he'd still been angry and a leash for his birthday, since it'd been a week after Sherlock'd got back from Seoul bringing John a bottle of wildly alcoholic spiritous liquor; a jar of marmalade that'd caused Sherlock to throw an absolute wobbler when John ate it on toast instead of—apparently?—making it into some sort of hot beverage; and a blue cashmere jumper that'd been destroyed by February when, in Cheltenham, Sherlock had dragged John off the back of a moving lorry. "—because of course," Sherlock is saying, "a bath
"Do you want to, really?" John, quiet, asks.
John wants—is wanting has wanted: licking along Sherlock's fair-coarse soft-dense hair and—and filling up, Sherlock's smell and his taste and his balls bumping into John's forehead while John is licking into him soft-soft-
—and then stops. His hands are sweaty, which is—silly. It's so much less hot. Sherlock lied, and he left, and he knows John, and he knows that his lying makes John angry, so he might—he might reasonably expect that John would be angry. Nothing. Nothing to it. Sherlock has just—lied a little, so that John would be angry, and then gone to visit a colleague of Mycroft's whose name is—Lucy. Lucy—Lucy Matley, and John shouldn't've, he shouldn't be so and so carefully over and over he hits delete. Delete. Delete.
John can feel his mouth tilt. "Glad I turned the light on?" he asks, and Sherlock looks up at his face.
"Very wrong of you," he says. He's still got his hands up John's dressing gown. John thinks it rather undermines their sense of realism, so he pulls back. Stands up. Sherlock's hands hover momentarily, then perch on his trouser knees, restless.
"No. Suppose not." He watches as Sherlock looks back down at his own bowl. John doesn't know why: all soup now, nearly. He's picked out the last of the beef.
John arches into him. Helpless. Can't—he touches him, wanting—wanting his hands on Sherlock's side, on his back, dipped into the tender sweaty groove where his arse meets his thighs as they kiss. They kiss slow, sweet: delicate and liquid like the skin of a bubble: Sherlock sinking down ever-closer against him, hot against him, hard against him; John could burst.

"Far be it for me to discourage a confession," Holmes says, while John is gasping—shivering—gasping—with his cock so red and heavy he could— "but I'd've thought a dozen would've been quite enough, for one day," and laughter tears its way out of John's chest, ripping him up.
"The last year and a half," Sherlock says, quietly, "mostly."
"Like that," Sherlock says, thick; John moans, twisting his spine, trying to push— "I want you like this," Sherlock whispers, into his throat, his fingers curling deep where John can't reach— "so wet," moving against his jaw, "and loose I could—could just—
"No?" Holmes asks, and then snaps the cane down across John's thighs: John jerks, head to toe. Red all over. Burning up. Wet—
Tastes. His salt and musky skin: John closes his eyes. Sherlock's cock thick and tender on John's wet tongue as he suckles, light. Squeezes at Sherlock's knees and above him, Sherlock sighs, "Wanted you to, on Tuesday." John squeezes again, drags his mouth up him, blinking, and Sherlock inhales. Cock thick between John's lips. Sherlock murmurs, "That's. Good."; and John loosens and licks out. Sherlock shivers, bending above him. Cups John's face as his hips roll. John opens, lets him slide: and Sherlock breathes, "John." His eyes slipping half shut, red round blotches on his cheeks. John's chest feels tight. He gets his hand around the root of Sherlock's cock with his pulse pounding in his palm and works him wet and loose, keeping him just in his mouth so his face can stay—stay turned up, stay—his hollow throat, as Sherlock swallows updown updown and breathes harder, harder and brushes his thumb against the tip of his cock through John's cheek and makes a little soft noise, a close-together between-them noise, with his hands on John's face and his back bent away from the cushions. John rubs at the inside of his thigh and holds him fast and sucks at the head of him and Sherlock gasps, "Wait, wait—" and John pulls off.
," Sherlock gasps, and thrashes out, hard: beneath them the bed creaks and whines. "I—I—" reminding, John stills for an instant— "I'd—you probably—" and Sherlock groans, then like water bursting-spilling he bursts out: "You lied to me with your lovely open mouth—" which John fits around him, sucking, sucking, as Sherlock says high and fast, "you told me you were failing chemistry and you needed help my help and would I and I just nodded and trailed home after you even though—even after I've spent—weeks and weeks and
John stares up at the ceiling. After a moment, he reaches over, and Sherlock interlaces their fingers.

"Come back," Sherlock says, unsteady; and like the ocean

"Do you still spar with Mantle and Chambal?" Sherlock asks.
," John gasps: his hips still jerking; Sherlock whines and pushes his finger halfway inside him and John cries out, thighs cramping, as his body spills itself out of him again into Sherlock's body as Sherlock sucks at him through his sodden boxers, shoulders hunched up under his black shirt, gasping.

When he said it it came out quiet: it isn't. It is pounding everywhere inside him, artillery-loud. Half-ashamed John lifts his mouth: they kiss.
Silent, Sherlock presses his face to John's hair.
"Much stupider people than you seem to manage it," Sherlock says. The tone is wrong, and out of the corner of his eye John watches him shift, half-straightening before gravity seems to tug him back in on himself: a weight at the top of his ribs.
"But," George prompts.
Hollow. Aching. Still hot all over clawing-hard at—walls—of blood and skin and bone but Sherlock. Arms around him, easing him down: the both of them hard-wet not touching between them as mouth to mouth nose to nose forehead to forehead, Sherlock interlocks his hands behind John's back.
After a minute, John asks, "Half nine, was it?"
"That was never part of the original experimental design," John observes, and Sherlock's eyes flick up to his face. "But you did it last time, too."
"Yes," Mycroft says smoothly, "very soon, I hope," and John pushes up to his feet.
"Come upstairs with me," John says. Hands brushing up over Sherlock's hips: "Upstairs," John says. "Please."
John nods. Rubs a hand over his face. His ribs buzz under his jacket and he reaches in: one message, Sherlock, no text, just a thumbnail of a photo, too small to make out. He swipes and it turns into a sign for the Canal Bus with the C missing: not, John knows, the sort of thing that generally strikes Sherlock as funny. It tugs at him, somewhere deep down under his ribs: he can feel the corners of his mouth, trying to smile. He tucks his phone back into his pocket.
He nods at her glass. "Another?" he asks.
"Sherlock," John warns.

." Still squeezing. Sherlock squeezes back. "Not," John says, "the demonstrably nonsensical proposition that I would ever leave you, because I." He swallows. "Won't."
"Fuck," he manages, broken.
"But it'd hurt you terribly," John says, "if I did."
John squeezes their interlaced hands.
"I like it, too." John licks: Sherlock shivers all over against him. "I like it," John whispers, "a lot."
Sherlock's mouth twists, a bit. "I'm not drunk either."

'd been what Sherlock'd thrown back. A fantasy, John might've thought; something John might've on some other day even enjoyed, perhaps: but last night John'd sent Sherlock satin ribbons and soft goldening light; and somehow Sherlock'd seen him dirty, drenched with humiliation, displayed for the delectation and dissection of half a dozen conjured monsters, wearing unknown human skins.
"I can't—explain it properly to you, to anyone, what it was like." Sherlock's voice wobbles, a bit. "To be—the way that I was, in my family, at my school, when I was sixteen." He takes a breath. "But I—if you think I'm impossible now, you should've met me then, and I—"
"I do think," Sherlock says, after a moment, "that you're a good listener by trade and a lot of people keep trying to tell you what's right when it isn't." he sighs. His voice drops, when he adds, "Not for us, at least."
"Oh, bugger—her birthday?"
"Yeah," Sherlock says unsteadily, "what I do for you"; and John doesn't hesitate. Nods.

The bra feels the silliest so he puts it on first. No point in it, is there, unless he can get somehow past—but he can't get it done up, can he, between the purplish drawing-tight ache deep in his shoulder and the twelve thousand bloody buggering hooks: easier, he thinks, infuriated, to get the fucking things
"I suppose," Sherlock murmurs, nuzzling, warm, "that I could let you mince the garlic"; and John breathes, "
Christ. "Of course," John says, quiet. Face buried beside his Sherlock nods.
He isn't—angry. Is he. He wishes he were, almost: it seems—out of character, this; that's all. That's everything. It was—careless, essentially, because Sherlock had left his hard drive attached to John's laptop, still unlocked and mounted. Usable, for—for that photo, and for—whatever else. Whatever else that there might be to see. But Sherlock—all Sherlocks—keep their hard drives rigorously encrypted, and apparently also occasionally hidden under their bedroom floor; and all Sherlocks use absurd, random passwords that are terrifyingly secure and yet nonetheless easy to read off to John—
—fuck," John says, nearly laughing, because the absurdity of impossible-to-open fucking safety seals on bottles of expensive fucking lube will never not seem like a design flaw of cosmic fucking proportions— "Aha!" with Sherlock rubbing at his twitching belly, grinning up at him. John snaps the cap open—

Sherlock's arms are heavy around him. The hitching-slow rise-and-fall of his ribs and John's ribs. "I'm sorry," Sherlock says, very quietly; and John laughs, wretched, thick.
His voice is casual. Curious. He could be offering John a mint, but he isn't. Instead John is nodding with his back all in knots and two fingers shoved up his own arse while Sherlock tucks a fluffy down pillow under his hips and then wriggles close up to his side while John's weight squashes it down—driving—wriggling into it feeling—stretched out, too thin, his half-awake body and his driving blood with Sherlock pressing little kittenish kisses to the edges of his face while his fingers next to John's fingers nudge John's arse wider open—knee
Sherlock is there, of course. Well past the cordon; blocked, John thinks, from the street cameras by a van; standing half-hidden behind a column with his collar up and his hands in his pockets while DS Wilson, Samson Hawe's sergeant, talks his ear off: DI Hawe himself, of course, is nowhere to be seen, presumably busy with counter-terrorism instead of grassing on Sherlock to Lestrade. At the Eye, the police'd had to take the CCTV capture down while they reviewed earlier footage:

"Stay," Sherlock whispers; John laughs, dizzy and lunatic. As though—

The sun is gone. All the windows open: streetlight-lit. Sherlock's curls wind 'round his fingers. His breath humid on John's throat. A long moment passes in which Sherlock doesn't pack or shower and they neither of them get up; and then Sherlock says, "Someone," very quiet, "was matchmaking."
"Even if," Sherlock echoes, curved down.
He kisses Sherlock's cheek; and Sherlock slumps further against him. All his weight: Christ, John is mad for him. He inhales, slow, sliding the backs of his knuckles down Sherlock's pink jawline; then says, "I don't feel a burning need to stick it in," very softly. "If that's what you're asking."
. "Upstairs," John repeats. Pushing, stumbles—forward, stumbling into—the slip of Sherlock's tongue and the scrape of his teeth on John's jaw and "upstairs—," John repeats, heart battering the undersides of his ribs with Sherlock's nose brushing along the shell of his ear and warm-curling inside his pocket Sherlock's hand and John's heart thuds as he thinks, two beats forward:
—fif-fifty-s-seven: coming so hard he bites his bottom lip to bleeding and then dissolves, shivering uncontrollably, into a puddle on the sheets.
Somewhere amongst two far too serious sunburns and an infected splinter, John's got his mobile out, scrolling up, reading back; and Mycroft's office minion rings: Miss Ingram and Mr. Sherlock Holmes are finished in Amsterdam and will be returning this afternoon. Would Mr. Watson like the information about their returning flight?

Inhales. Bites down and holds, straining lungs. Sherlock is breathing hard. John hadn't heard. Exploding out of him and he gulps,
John leans over and kisses the seam at his left shoulder. "You can send me some more saucy texts later," he suggests; and Sherlock laughs. Shoulders loosening. It's his proper laugh, really, not one of those awful tearing things; but it still sounds horribly tired.
"Ought to make you take care of this yourself, too," Sherlock says, very quietly, with his thumb brushing up over every hot good spot as John's lungs let out a shuddering sort of "
: a wisp of thought;
"I—I can't." John swallows. "I need to, can I—" Sucking in stinging ice air with Sherlock's arm round him, pressed hot up behind him, the wet smear of his prick cooling on John's stinging skin—
"Going to be thinking about me?" John asks.
"I—yes." He straightens, and then squints at the back of Sherlock's bowed neck. "Who's Lucy Matley?"
"Yeah?"
Sherlock lifts his head. Props himself up, looking down: his face is tender, serious; his mouth half-curving down. He says, "Why did you think I came to Rouen?"
"Well, so far I like this game," John says. "Do I have to say 'Simon says' to get you to kiss me?" he asks, and Sherlock smirks, not moving. "Then Simon says kiss me," John says, grinning up: warm just meeting Sherlock's soft, hot mouth.
." His fingers disagree. He is petting down John's back, his hips and thighs, settling him closer, bit by bit.
Sherlock doesn't reply. When John looks back at him, he nods again: pale, bruise-eyed, holding John's right hand in his left while John tugs him across the landing, already a half-step onto the second of the stairs. Below him on the landing Sherlock is clutching his bag, one-armed, against his chest.
"Maybe we ought to just stay," Sherlock says, rough. His throat's tissue-skin is coming up with his blood, flushing red. "Just—stay, and." John curls his fingers against his palms. "Make Mycroft pay for a week," Sherlock is saying, too fast, "really—really

John swallows the sourness in his mouth. "But you wouldn't endure another," he says, very quietly; and Sherlock takes a breath.
John nods. "Lots of nicks, at first, I'd reckon."
"Well," he says, "The last time I had a boyfriend I was—nineteen, so—": his voice cracks, and he clears his throat.
"I'd've lasted," gasping: he kisses John again; John rubs at his cheek, his hot throat: "about a minute and a half." Sherlock's voice is thick, unsteady; and John bites, gentle, at the edge of his jaw. "
"No, I'm not," Sherlock says, "I'm not—" and then stops.
"And pubic hair," Sherlock adds: inevitable, really.
John stops.
John hesitates in the doorway, then comes in, and shuts the door behind him.
"I like being like this," John says, "with you."
John dreamt of this, he thinks: or—something very like, the liquid-warm wrapped-up sensation of his body with Sherlock's body suffusing every cell of him in his sleep. Woke up with his center of gravity nuzzling warm-close between his thighs. Sherlock rubs low-hard against his belly and John shifts, helpless, strung tight; wanting—he wants—
"I think there's a lot more to enjoying sex than whether or not you're having an orgasm," George says, "and it sounds like Sherlock would agree with me"; and John laughs, raw and achy, and tips his chin up, his skull knocking into the window: a dull squarish sort of thud. The front of him feels—different. All his back lit up where he can't see it. George's little grey patch of pale London sky.
After a moment, he says, "You don't have to do this," quietly.
Sherlock's legs are wiry and strong: not news, really. The pale hair on their backs is really only visible where it makes the water run differently, foam from his back sliding down paths that John traces with his fingertips, rubbing the soap tucked into his palm up to the ticklish hollow behind Sherlock's right knee and then back down his firm dense right calf to the elaborate architecture of tendon and bone of his right ankle. John sinks his own weight back onto his folded-up feet, running the palm of his hand along the back of Sherlock's blunt pink heel. "Lift up?" John asks; but above him Sherlock makes a small, ragged noise, and "All right," John says, stroking back up the back of his calf, gentling. "All right."
John is quiet.
Turning. "Hullo, you." John's face feels warm, tilted up. Smiling. "I was starting to think you weren't going to make it."
All over petting.
"It's—fun," Sherlock says, harsh and unsteady. "We're having—" and then pushes his free hand to the table and twists, bending—twisting down to—kiss while he—squeezes John's hand and then—gasps, and shudders: half-melting, a different person, for an instant; all his weight sinking into the center of John's weight for—for a moment, only just. Seconds, barely; and then Sherlock is straightening-pushing up, John's hand sliding off his belly mouth hot-stung from kissing, and Sherlock scrubs both hands through his hair. Red all over, pajamas tugged out awkwardly in front of him, erection pulling the fabric to drag the elastic all the way down under his left hip. He grabs the cups and John's plate, and clatters them into the kitchen; and after a second to adjust himself, John gathers up the rest, and follows.
Sherlock's hands on his arse, his back: tugging. John settles, almost.
John pets his palm across the backs of Sherlock's shoulders, over and over, until the tension leaches out of them, his arm warm and heavy around John's middle, pressed close. It takes some time. John feels warm and tender all over. He wants—he wishes he knew how to push it out of him, down through his hands and his body into Sherlock's body wound up close with his body, until Sherlock felt as warm and tender as him: all his sharp badly-fitted parts rubbed halfway smooth, more forgiving.
