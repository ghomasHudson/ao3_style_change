“Sherlock, no one knows what the future holds. But I can tell you this. It’s always us, right? Just you and me against the world. I’m not going anywhere anytime soon. Not without you.”

John can’t help but laugh. Sherlock looks so exasperated at the thought of someone putting little red pegs in his perfect grey ships. It’s actually kind of adorable, and infuriating, trying to play games with Sherlock sometimes. The man absolutely refuses to lose. He will find any and all ways to go around, over, or bloody through the rules of any game. That’s why John decided on Twister. No chance of cheating in this one.
Presently, we are sat in the train carriage on our way back to London, and the fatigue has caught up with my dear companion. I glance across the small compartment to the unusual picture of Holmes in repose. It is not often that he lets himself relax, actually stops moving long enough for sleep to catch him and pull him under, but when it does, it's a sight that never fails to make my heart expand. His gorgeous face, which I have admired in both day, with my eyes, and night, with lips and fingers, is serene, composed into a slumbering mask of beauty. He looks so far younger than his current years, the worry and strain of our profession wiped from those features. His hands, violinist’s hands, rest peacefully in his lap. How I adore his hands. Large and soft, tender and strong, during our nights those hands have massaged and caressed my skin, pulled forth cries and incantations from my lips as they have wrung the pleasure from my body. Just thinking now of all that lay ahead once we reach our destination has me flushed and eager, thoughts of chiseled planes and smooth alabaster skin pervading my brain. We are quite alone in the private carriage car Holmes has procured for us, and it is tempting to risk fate, close the distance between us, trail my fingers and lips up those long legs and take our release right here on the plush cushions. But to do so is madness, a step too far. So I remain on my side, looking for all the world as nothing more than two men sharing a train ride, when the truth is I would share everything with this man.
John sucked in a breath and tightened his grip in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him close. He tilted his head up as Sherlock leaned down, meeting in a crushing kiss that left them both breathless. John broke away, pausing to press kisses to one cheekbone then the other, before pulling away and stripping down to his pants.
John had lost count. This was either the fourth or fifth pint he had consumed in the time they’d been here. Not to mention the couple of chasers he’d downed, the amber liquid burning down his throat and filling his veins with a fire and a courage he normally wouldn’t possess. Otherwise, how could he explain why he was currently leaning against the bar in one of Soho’s seedier gay clubs watching the lights play off Sherlock’s face and wondering what it would be like to lick the sweat off that sinfully long neck. Or to drag his friend out on the floor and find out what that body felt like pressed up against his own. What that delicious arse would feel like nestled up against his groin.
John paused beside the sofa, drinking his fill of the vision in front of him. While Sherlock was absorbed, John would frequently do this, study and admire each glorious inch, let his eyes rove over lips and cheeks, delicious collar bones, miles of leg, and long, slender shapely hands and feet. He contemplated the feast laid out, pondering just where to start. He decided to start easy. Best not to startle Sherlock and end up with a broken nose, after all.
Sherlock could only nod, assaulted as she was by the sensations coursing through her. She was shuddering, John’s hands, her mouth working to break her apart piece by piece. Sherlock was trying to hold on, trying to fight against the rising tide, but every cell in her body was begging for release.
“Oh, John, yes,” Sherlock cried out, releasing John and using his release to provide extra lubrication for his own cock. He raised his hips off the bed, fucking into his fist, John’s weight on his legs warm and wonderful. He opened his eyes to find John watching him, that softness mixed with hunger that pushed Sherlock over the edge.
to know what you liked. What you thought. Yes, what you desired. I find myself, even now, wondering what it is your heart desires.
“God - Sher -” John bites his lip to keep from moaning his name. He is pretty sure Sherlock is not in the flat, something about body parts and Barts, but John doesn’t take any chances.
John settled in and closed her eyes, and as Sherlock watched, the tension seemed to melt away, her lovely face softening. The rise and fall of her chest was deep and even, and Sherlock knew she was resting peacefully and with any luck would remain that way for the night. She attempted to remove her hand from John’s grip, but John tightened her hold, as if even in her sleep she was determined not to let Sherlock go. Sherlock felt a thrill run through her at the thought of John wanting her to stay, because honestly, there was no where else she would rather be.
Sherlock laughs, a deep sound that vibrates into John’s bones. He loves it when Sherlock laughs, actually lets himself go. It’s one area John likes to think is reserved for him. John can’t help joining in, laughing at the ridiculousness of two grown men playing a childhood party game in their sitting room.
Sherlock appears to read his mind. Without warning or discussion, he lifts the covers and crawls beneath them, stretching out on his side, facing John.
Sherlock  swallows hard as the sound of the shower starting kicks his fantasies into an even higher gear. Thoughts of John under the warm spray, sand and salt running off that tanned skin, down chiseled planes, muscular thighs. He is sure he has never been this aroused in his life. Something about the mix of sun and John is making Sherlock itch with desire, the pull getting stronger by the day. One part of his brain tells him he should cut this trip short before anything stupid happens on his part. While the other, baser, hidden part of his brain reminds him of that droplet and the trail down John’s body, and how easily Sherlock could mimic it, follow it with tongue and lips and teeth. The baser part is winning.
Sherlock stood up and moved over to stand in front of John’s chair. He wavered there, shifting slightly from foot to foot as he waited for John to look up at him. John took his time, carefully closing the paper, folding it in half and placing it on the side table next to his chair. Only after that was complete did he look up to catch Sherlock’s eyes. His pleading, beautiful, color-of the-sea, ever-changing eyes.
John inwardly groans, but accepts. He knows how these things work, and no amount of griping is going to change the system. All he can hope for now is that he heals up enough to go home, and recover the rest of the way in peace. Home. Wherever that is now.
John leans up and kisses Sherlock again, pulling him down and slanting his mouth over Sherlock’s, the chaste affair quickly turning to something hungrier.
“Mm. You, and your cheekbones, the way you move when you have the answer, you swagger. It’s sexy as all hell.”
“Fuck, Sherlock, that’s hot,” John growls, releasing his hand from Sherlock’s hair and running it down his outer thigh, soothing him through his tremors.
John threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, pulling him back down and sealing their mouths together. This kiss was softer, but no less passionate, their tongues sliding over one another’s, John’s hands moving from Sherlock’s head, to his nape, down his back and thighs. John loved the feel of Sherlock’s skin under his fingers, the softness, the sparse hair, the wiry strength held in check. Without breaking their kiss, John reached his right hand back and opened the bedside table, quickly reaching inside for the small bottle of lube. Sherlock, knowing exactly what he was after, broke the kiss, and smiled down at John, reaching over to take it out of his hand. He sat back on his heels, uncapping the bottle and preparing to spread some on his fingers.
“Good evening, brother dear,” Mycroft says, retreating back behind the tinted glass, the icy facade in place once more.
Shaking himself out of his haze, he chuckled and grabbed his bag, following behind John. He gazed at the single rose he still clasped in his right hand, and a smile blossomed on his face. Not many people surprised him, but he was glad that John was so much more than he seemed.
John smirked and bit gently, causing Sherlock to practically buck them both off the sofa. “So sensitive. God you’re gorgeous like this. I want to kiss every last inch of you.”
It was 3 am about one month and four days after John had moved back in that things came to  a head. Startled awake from where he had fallen asleep watching telly, John was surprised not to hear Amelia’s cries, but a familiar baritone softly rasping from his bedroom upstairs. Curious as to why Sherlock would be talking to his sleeping daughter at 3 am, he crept up the stairs to have a look. Standing in the doorway to his room, John knew the sight that greeted him is one he would not soon forget, nor would ever choose to.
A soft rustle of fabric and the sound of a chair dragged against a floor alert him to the fact that it's someone else. John turns his head to the side and opens his eyes a crack.
John lifted Sherlock’s feet out of his lap, got up from the couch and went to the desk, fumbling through the pile of books there, throwing a few into his backpack. “I think I’d better go get some studying done,” John said softly.
Sherlock smiled and leaned up to press his lips to John’s before pulling away with a contented sigh.
Sherlock ran his hands down John’s back, waist, and tugged hard at the towel John was still wearing. “Off,” he muttered between kisses. Between the two of them, the towel was soon discarded, landing with a soggy thud upon the floor. Sherlock’s hands instantly found John’s arse, and pulled him impossibly closer, urging John to grind down harder. John groaned at the pressure on his cock, even through a layer of clothes, Sherlock felt amazing. They thrust against one another for a few moments, trading kisses that were more tongue than lips as they moaned into each other’s mouths. John broke away long enough to remove Sherlock’s T-shirt, sucking one dusky nipple into his mouth.
“John, oh god, I can’t -” Sherlock was clenching the sheets so tightly her grip was white, every muscle in her body tensed.
John laughs, placing his hands on his hips and standing up to glare at Sherlock. “Sherlock, you’re bored. You’ve been in a strop for four days now, and I’m tired of it.”
John turned and strode to the door, before turning back around to glance at Sherlock, “I’ll see you later, yeah?”
The doctor fixes him with a look. “The bullet entered the inferior vena cava, and nicked your liver. We were able to repair the damage, yes, but it was touch and go. You underwent asystole on the table and we needed to perform emergency measures to bring you out. In other words, Doctor, you’re a very lucky man.”
Sherlock chose that moment to subtly twist his wrist and crook his fingers ever so slightly, and it took every thing John had not to come immediately as his prostate was brushed. Sherlock did it again, and John knew he couldn’t wait any longer.
He hears footsteps approaching, the tap of an umbrella handle. Mycroft. It has to be now. He has to tell him, if this is the last chance, John needs to know.
“I’m sorry?” The assistant snaps her head up, looking at Sherlock with a horrified expression. “My what?”
John startles awake. It takes him a minute to realize where he is, and when he does he lets out a deep shuddering breath. And then another. Baker Street. The moonlight is filtering in through the open window of his upstairs bedroom, casting light on its familiar contours. John is sitting upright in the middle of his bed, fists clenched in the bed sheets, breathing hard. He tries to slow the pace of his breathing, do the exercises Ella once taught him, but it’s not working. Another shaky inhale and he buries his face in his hands.
Sherlock feels the cold drizzle on his hole and shivers, which quickly turn to shudders as John circles his hole again, pushing two fingers inside, opening him up. John’s other hand is intertwined with Sherlock’s on the sofa, supporting him as Sherlock rocks his hips, chasing his pleasure at John’s touch. Two fingers soon turn to three, and when John brushes against his prostate and his vision goes blurry, he knows he needs John inside him now.
John rubbed his hand along his nape. Ah. He’s not entirely sure what he said, but there may have been a few choice words in that litany. John looked up at Sherlock ready to apologize when Sherlock cut him off.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, his eyes searching John’s face. He grabbed John’s hand where it lay between them on the mattress, threading their fingers together. John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s skin and waited. After a couple minutes, Sherlock seemed to find what he needed. He smiled, bringing their joined hands to his mouth and kissing John’s knuckles.
He knew, had known for some time if he was honest, that he was in love with John. Probably since the moment they met. He’d tried to deny it, lock it away and ignore it, but sometimes the rush of affection for this man was too great, and Sherlock was overcome. Since the whole Mary affair was over and John was back home, the moments had become more frequent, and Sherlock was terrified something would crack, he would show his hand, and John would leave, unable to take the inevitable strain on their friendship. So far, he’d kept it mostly under control. But lately he couldn’t contain the thoughts that had come unbidden to him. Thoughts of John. John kissing him while they snuggled on the sofa. John pulling him close, running his hands through his curls, the warmth of his body pressed next to him. John in his bed…
A chill travels down Sherlock’s spine at the words, Mary mimicking the strange sing-song nature of Jim Moriarty's taunt perfectly. That’s all this ever was, he knows. Mary, the wedding, John. All designed to burn the heart out of him. Sherlock has to commend him on his admirable job. Because right at this moment, he’s forced to admit he’s damn near charred.
Sherlock takes his time, using his hands to press John’s cheeks in and out, opening him up, all the time licking broad stripes across John’s perineum, up the crack, and down, teasing stripes, no where near enough.
“I’m - I’m fine.” Sherlock chokes out, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat. He grips the book tighter in his lap, trying to block his sudden erection from view.
Sherlock watches as the car pulls away, then turns and walks on shaky legs into Royal Hospital, ready to accept the fate of his best friend.
And its fine. It’s all fine. Because they don’t understand. All those people don’t see what he does, what he has always seen. Everyone has always refused to look beyond the carefully crafted facade that Sherlock presents to the world. The untouchable sociopath, the annoying arsehole. And it’s true. Sherlock is a dick. Unabashedly and unashamedly. But only to those who truly deserve it. Idiots, bastards, and meddling prats. Outside of 221B, the Work is what captivates Sherlock, and all else need not apply. That is the side most of the world sees. All business Sherlock.
At the first press of John’s lips, Sherlock sighed, melting into the kiss and rolled her body closer. John swiped her tongue along the seam of Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock opened her mouth, allowing John to lick her way inside. As John’s tongue slid across her own,  Sherlock moaned inside their kiss, and a shiver of arousal rippled through Sherlock’s body, the feeling so unexpected she broke away, her body shaking in John’s arms.
Sherlock nodded, and they moved off the dance floor, John allowing his hands to wander down Sherlock’s back to his arse as they walked. Sherlock threw on his Belstaff quickly, throwing his suit jacket over his arm and turned around to fist a hand in John’s shirt and slam their mouths back together. John groaned and pressed back, giving as good as he was getting. He broke away, panting, “Baker Street? Now.” Sherlock nodded, grabbing his hand and moving towards the door.
“To the very best of times, John.” I’d uttered those words to you on the tarmac, holding your hand in mine one last time. But did you hear?
“Sometimes I want to lick you open, nice and slow, take my time and worship you. Eat you out until you scream.”
So when he walked back into that empty flat, after watching John dance away with Mary, his eyes alighted on that chair. He knew, in that moment, that John’s essence was gone. His space in 221b was no longer needed because he was with her. Sherlock curled himself into John’s chair, inhaling the last remnants of John that he could and let the icy wave of sadness wash over him. And as the tears fell over the lapels of his morning jacket, he vowed to not let John’s memory become ordinary. Not let other people take it away. No one would use or take what was rightfully John’s.
“Look to the building on your left, Mr. Watson,” a man’s voice said. John looked before he was even aware he was doing it.
“Look, I can’t let you stay the night here, I’ll get fired,” he said. Sherlock said nothing, not meeting his eyes. “But you can come and stay the night with me. You can kip on the coach, I’ve got a roommate, but he’s harmless, I promise.”
“I know it’s fine. And no, no boyfriend.” John nodded, relieved. He would have pressed further, but at that moment a customer walked in.
“Hi, Mike,” John said, fighting to ignore the fierce blush climbing up his cheeks. He cleared his throat. “You remember Sherlock?”
“You’re training to be a doctor, there’s no way you would miss the signs of drug use and your caretaking nature make it impossible for you not to be worried.” John shook his head, amazed.
John’s immediate reaction was to think he was high. But that couldn’t be right. There was no way Sherlock Holmes would get high. Granted, John knew very little about him, but what he did know made him sure that he must be mistaken.
Yet Sherlock suspected it was more than simply the fact that it was sentiment that prevented him from deleting all the memories—he didn’t particularly want to. The thought of going back to the time before John was a dreadful, dreary one. Yes, being in love with John Watson was painful, but it was far preferable to the horrendous boredom that was his life before John had entered it.
HI MY LOVELIES!! I'm so so so sorry to vanish on you guys like that, I promise I really am, life has just been quite busy what with graduating (yayyy!!!!!), a family friend's wedding (yayyy!! I'm also super inspired to write a wedding fic now....), and a trip to Europe to visit family (yayyy!!!!). I'm actually still in Ukraine currently and uploading from my phone, so if there are any formatting issues please let me know and I'll fix them as soon as I get to a computer.
"Sherlock? I'm home," John called, going to the kitchen to make himself some tea. Tea would help him forget about all the infuriating people he had to deal with during the day. Somebody had made an entire appointment, pretending to be sick only to badger him with questions about Sherlock and how he came back, and their relationship. Really! That was valuable time that could be spent saving somebody else's life! John felt the anger rise in him again as his hands began to shake.
The love they made was soft and warm and bathed in early morning sunlight, causing their skin to glow and their hair to shine. They both thrust into the circle of John’s fist around them (Sherlock’s arse being a bit too sore to take any more at that moment), their breaths puffing from their mouths together, mingling and fusing. Sherlock couldn’t help but imagine the cells of John’s body leaving and entering his own, mixing with the cells already there, their bodies combining and merging as one, they were almost close enough, almost. He was close enough to see the individual hairs of John’s impossibly long lashes, close enough count the number of different shades of blue in his eyes, close enough that he could no longer tell where he started and where John began. With every thrust he felt them get closer and closer together, and he never wanted to stop.
“I like the sound of that,” he said, his voice so low it was almost a growl. Sherlock shivered. John pulled away from him reluctantly and did the worst closing job he had probably ever done, but he couldn’t focus when he could feel Sherlock’s intense gaze on him the whole time (particularly when he bent over). When he finally finished with cleaning everything and getting everything ready for whoever would be working the next morning, he walked over to Sherlock and stood on his tiptoes, kissing him again, thinking that he would never get used to the feeling of his lips against his own.
“Are you finally done?” Sherlock asked, winding his long arms around John’s waist in a way that said that he wasn’t letting him go even if he wasn’t.
“Hurry up, John,” Sherlock breathed down his neck, pressing himself against John’s back. John’s knees went weak when he felt the erection brushing on his lower back. Sherlock’s large hands ran down John’s sides.
“You absolute arsehole,” he chuckled, deciding on a compromise. “I mean you really are a wanker. You do realize Mike’s going to make me pay for a new one?” Sherlock shrugged again.
John blinked himself awake, registering the warm body cuddled up close to his own. For a moment he lay awake, trying to figure out what he was looking at. With another blink, the fog cleared from his mind as his eyes focused in on the curl of dark hair, sticking up in an odd angle from the rest. He smiled as the events of the night before came rushing back. His nose was buried in the thick nest of dark curls of Sherlock’s hair.
“Thanks,” he replied, wishing he could remember her name. She seemed like a nice girl. “Would it be too much to ask for you to not tell Bill about this?” She smiled slyly at him, tucking a piece of dark brown hair behind her ear.
“That’s Sherlock Holmes. He comes in here a lot, but he always just kind of sits there, not really doing anything. He’s only in his sixth form, but he’s wicked smart,” she said. John gaped at her.
“Oi mate!” John heard. He rolled over, grumbling, trying to get back to sleep. “John, I’m serious, wake the fuck up, there’s a nutter in our kitchen!”
“He mighta,” she replied with a shrug. Sherlock sighed and dropped a few more bills into her cup. She smiled at him with a mouth full of broken teeth. “Y’know, now that you mention it, I did see him here earlier today. He walked right into the house like he owned the damn place, made a couple of loud sounds and left in quite a hurry.” Sherlock gave a real smile for the first time since he ended things with John.
He could tell that Sherlock expected him to stop when he made it to his cock, but he kept going, lifting Sherlock’s legs, so his feet were planted and his legs were bent, giving John full access. Sherlock shivered, when he realized where John was going, right before John gave a long lick to his perineum. Sherlock whimpered, which turned into a moan when John continued licking back towards his entrance. He swirled his tongue around it a few times, feeling it relax under his ministrations. Sherlock was emitting a steady stream of whimpers and moans, interspersed with the occasional curse word.
John,” Sherlock said, as though he couldn’t believe he had to explain himself. John chuckled, running a hand down Sherlock’s side soothingly.
He licked a long, experimental stripe from the root to the tip, swirling his tongue around the head. Sherlock groaned, arching off the bed. John smirked, loving how responsive Sherlock was. After a moment of simply holding the head of Sherlock's cock in his mouth, he slowly began sucking lightly on it, bobbing his head.
“Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson said suddenly, her voice urgent in a way that Sherlock hadn’t heard before. He turned to her and saw that she was staring down at her ringing phone with a look of great displeasure mixed with something like fear.
The plane ride was dull, as was expected, but Sherlock brought a book about honey bees that had some fascinating up close photographs of the bees and their hives. Mrs. Hudson took one of her “herbal soothers” and fell asleep immediately. She rested her head on Sherlock’s shoulder, which meant that he couldn’t move his arm very comfortably, but he didn’t mind. There was one interesting moment when a couple, unbeknownst to all the other passengers, had sex in the bathroom of the plane.
It was ridiculous. He had always known this day would come. The day when he finally came down from the cloud where any form of relationship with him was possible. He had diagnosed himself as an asexual high-functioning sociopath years ago to explain why he was so different from all the other children, and up until the moment when he saw John for the first time, he had believed it. There had been a few moments over the years that had made him question his sexuality, and as soon as he had laid eyes on the surprising beauty that was John Watson in his coffee-stained apron, he had immediately revised his hypothesis.
Keeping his steps light, John quickly walked over to Sherlock (stepping over Sherlock’s trousers as he did so, another sight he loved), and dropped a small, chaste kiss on his forehead. He stood and left quickly, knowing if he stayed a moment longer he wouldn’t be able to tear himself away.
“Right, I should probably get back to work. Sarah’s probably wondering where I am,” he said, not meeting Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock nodded.
He could see himself dating Sarah, falling in love with her. He could see it like a picture—ten years from now, both of them doctors, with a couple of kids in a house in the country, Sherlock and the dingy coffee shop they used to work at, both distant memories they like to laugh about every now and then.
“Hey,” he said, dropping down into his customary armchair across from Sherlock’s dark grey leather one. Sherlock looked up from his phone.
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t believe that either, Mr. Watson. You’ve met Sherlock, how many friends do you imagine he has?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about I wasn’t doing anything last night,” he stuttered. Sherlock smirked again.
He thought about what John would say if he saw him roll his eyes, and then did it anyway, just to spite the imagined John in his mind. He wasn’t with Sherlock and that was good. If only his heart would listen to what his brain told it, however.
"Please, John. I want you inside of me. Lube is in the bedside table." Sherlock was squirming with want, twisting his hands in the sheets to keep from touching himself. John reached to the bedside table to get the lube. He applied it to his fingers and ran a finger around the tight ring of muscle. Sherlock gasped, thrusting into the air. John finally pushed a finger in. Both men gasped. Sherlock, at the sudden intrusion, and John at the tight, wet heat that engulfed his finger. Smirking, John crooked his fingers, glad that his medical knowledge allowed him to find the other man's prostate with ease. He finished stretching him quickly, excited as he was to be inside of Sherlock. He rubbed lube onto his cock and eagerly placed the head at Sherlock's entrance. With a moan, he thrust into the detective's wet heat. Sherlock arched up, scrabbling his hands on the sheets.
“Hey, John I’m home and I brought a friend!” Mike called as he stepped through the door…and directly into the kitchen. John jumped a foot in the air, but Sherlock calmly kept his hold around John’s waist as John was the only thing keeping his naked front hidden from view (he was not altogether confident in his ability to wrap the sheet around himself fast enough that Mike and his friend wouldn’t get a good look).
He kept thrusting, gradually getting faster and more forceful. Sherlock was loving every second. John was gripping his hair tight enough to force tears down his cheeks, and he kept choking on John’s thick cock, but he had never been happier.
“I’m clean, Mycroft. Tonight was a relapse. It won’t happen again. But I’m still not coming with you.”
John pulled away slightly, searching Sherlock’s eyes to see if had done the right thing. Sherlock’s eyes were huge, the pupils blown wide.
Sherlock keened, thrusting his hips toward John, his cock red and leaking profusely. John licked his lips again. He popped the cap of the lube open and poured some of the cool liquid over his fingers, warming it up. He trailed a finger lightly down the underside of Sherlock’s cock, earning himself and breathy moan and another impatient “John.” With another smirk, John fingered at the tight ring on muscle, not quite slipping his finger in yet.
No, it was much better to continue hiding behind his books and pretending to get some work done until they left.
“You said friends don’t do this sort of thing. Why not?” he asked again, in that short, clipped way he had, and John stared for a few seconds, suddenly remembering how young and inexperienced Sherlock was.
“Hey mate, you okay? Want a refill?” John approached somewhat hesitantly, holding out the pot of coffee like a peace offering. Sherlock turned and glared at John under thick dark lashes.
“My brother,” Sherlock muttered darkly. John looked at his watch and sighed when he saw it was almost time to close up.
Yet John knew the reason, even if he didn’t want to admit it, even to himself. Sherlock Holmes had somehow weaseled his way into his mind and now he wasn’t coming out. He had only had one conversation with him, yet John couldn’t get him out of his mind. He was still in high school, for Christ’s sake. Just thinking about it made John feel uncomfortable.
He sighed bitterly. He was supposed to be over this by now. He was tired of thinking about John, he was tired of thinking about how he was tired of thinking about John. He had hoped that perhaps the further away from him that he got, the easier it would be, yet here he was, on an airplane to America and still thinking about him. He buried himself angrily in his book and tried to get reabsorbed in the up-close pictures and the complexities of the lives of bees, but it wasn’t the same.
When John woke up it was raining. Which wasn’t terribly noteworthy on its own (they did live in London, after all), but the rain made his shoulder ache and the loud drumming on the roof of the flat, usually a calming sound, was making his head hurt.
“Oh yes, I once brought pocket knife on board a plane with me, but when we landed, they had seized my things because of a vibrator had gone off in my luggage! Imagine that! A sex toy begin more dangerous than a knife.” She shook her head and chuckled, and Sherlock looked at her with a newfound respect, more for bringing knife onto a plane than for owning a vibrator (he had already deduced about the vibrator).
“No, Sherlock don’t just brush this off, I’m serious. I have lived with my sister for long enough to know that the cycle of an addict is nothing I want to be a part of.”
“Anytime,” Sherlock replied thoughtfully. He hadn’t been planning on mentioning the girl, but the words had jumped from his mouth before he could stop them—as happened very frequently with his deductions. Yet what startled him most was that John didn’t mention Sarah. He hadn’t looked particularly interested, but not because he was already going out with someone, but just because he wasn’t interested.
“Well, I am disappointed of course, but I’ll be fine,” he replied. Mike looked at him for another few seconds then nodded. He picked up his pencil and leaned over his notebook once more.
As the soulful strains of Ella Fitzgerald coast over the room, Sherlock looks over at John. His John now. His husband. He can hardly believe that after all this time, they are actually here. To say John looked good at his last wedding is an understatement, but tonight, he is positively resplendent, his silver-blond hair glowing in the dim candlelight, his blue eyes sparkling. Those blue eyes catch Sherlock’s now, one eyebrow lifting.
Sherlock hurried to comply, settling himself on his front, legs bent underneath him, arms stretched over his head,  which put his arse on beautiful display. John settled behind him. He ran his hands soothingly up the back of creamy thighs, over that lush backside, squeezing. “Have you ever…” he asked.
Sherlock gave a shy smile, and shifted on the bed, crawling half back over John to reach in the bedside table for the lube. John took the opportunity to taste the proffered skin in front of him, grasping Sherlock by the hips to hold him place while he licked around his nipple. Sherlock hissed, pressing further into the contact. John smiled against his skin, reaching his hands further back to grasp Sherlock’s arse and pull him closer. Sherlock groaned and pushed back, leaning down to recapture John’s mouth in a searing kiss and shifting back down to align their erections. They kissed for several minutes, rutting against one another and swallowing each other’s moans, but John wanted more. John wrapped both legs around Sherlock’s waist causing Sherlock’s cock to slip and rub between his arse cheeks, and John gasped.
“John,” Sherlock moans, hooking his ankle over John’s and rolling his hips. The hand on John’s cock speeds up, pulling back the foreskin on the downward stroke and adding a flick of the wrist at the tip, the way John likes.
“I didn’t tell him,” Sherlock moaned, dropping his hands and looking up at her. “I said I was busy that night.”
John sat across from him and dug into his own dinner, and the two shared an easy silence, broken here and there with talk of the day, upcoming rugby meets, exams, but for the most part they just existed, calm in a relaxed ease that felt warm and comforting.
John kissed down, tongue leaving hot trails on Sherlock’s neck, sucking hard on his collar bone. Sherlock moaned, his hands threading into John’s hair and holding tight.
Sherlock is stalling for time. It is imperative Mary believes she has gotten away with everything, the only surefire way to ensure John’s safety. It’s a dangerous game, for Mary is an excellent shot, evidenced by the small scar he already bears, proof of her willingness to do whatever it takes to protect her lies. One of those lies was the root of this meeting, the contract she thinks she’s come to collect on; his death. Still Moriarty’s second after all this time. Sherlock knows he’s playing with a snake but he’s willing to do it, for one reason. For John.
Sitting up, he noticed his clothing was now folded neatly on Sherlock’s dresser, but his jacket was lying in a heap on the floor as if it had fallen from the shelf. He got out of bed and hung it back up and moved into the hall just as Sherlock was emerging, wrapped in a towel. His hair was wet, falling in tight ringlets and when his eyes fell on John, a tight smile graced his lips.
“Sherlock!” John raised his voice; his eye contact was steadfast against where Sherlock was peering out. “I just want to talk!
John wasn’t prepared for this. He wouldn’t even know what to tell Mary or how to even begin to tell her.
John sighed, looking up at his wife with a frown of disbelief which prompted Mary to burst into a fit of giggles. The thought of John taking dancing lessons seemed to be too much for Mary to imagine.
The wind was bitter and cold, a sign that autumn was nearly in full force, and Sherlock’s nose was shaded with a rosy pink. John had a sudden urge to kiss it, but knew he wouldn’t dare for fear of someone he knew spotting him do it in such an open space that wasn’t very far from his home.
“You think so?” Sherlock asked, almost shy as he grabbed a few sheets of paper and came over to John, gracefully sitting down in front of him, cross legged.
As a cab that Sherlock had hailed halted in front of the pair, John ducked his head to step inside. He felt Sherlock’s warm hand on the small of his back as he guided him into the car. And as guilty as he was feeling about the situation, John wanted him to keep his firm touch on his bones. With a start he realised he wanted more.
Sherlock broke away, panting, sitting up suddenly. John was about to protest, about to physically grab him and pull him back down, when he realized Sherlock was removing his clothing in quick efficient movements. John watched him disrobe, mouth going dry as each bit of pale skin was exposed.
Sherlock pushed down John’s jeans and pants until John’s cock was free, and both men moaned as their naked lengths rubbed together, rutting against one another. Sherlock was frantic for more, he reached between them and took them both in hand, rolling his hips harder against John’s.
It’s all John can get out before Sherlock grabs him and pulls him down, fitting their mouths together, and wasting no time in pressing his tongue to the seam of John’s lips. John gives back just as good, his initial ‘oomph’ of surprise fading into a drawn out moan as he slides his tongue against Sherlock’s. The kiss is hot and desperate, years of pent-up desire let loose in one instant. Between the two of them, John’s towel is shed, and four hands pull off Sherlock’s swim trunks, tossing them somewhere towards the balcony. Sherlock presses a hard kiss to John’s mouth, and then flips them on the sofa, draping his body over John’s.
Sherlock pulled off, but kept his hand wrapped around the base of John’s cock, jerking slowly in a rhythm that was driving John mad. “John, please, I want -”
Just those sounds were enough to make Sherlock’s breath come quicker and his cock start to thicken in his trousers. John pleasuring himself has come to inspire a matching need in Sherlock, one he has had to indulge more often as of late. Laying on his own bed, listening to the bedsprings from the floor above as he strokes himself firm and hard, imagining John above him. Or listening to the wet sounds of John in the shower, skin against skin, driving him on as he plunges slick fingers in his arse, rutting against the sheets, visions of John’s impressive cock driving into him, claiming him. Sherlock has to bite down on his pillow to keep from screaming John’s name as he comes, John’s answering groans echoing from one room away. John is always loud, louder than he realizes, but what Sherlock heard today had shaken him to the core.
Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut at the pain he can hear behind John’s words. He knows without a doubt, that this whole mess is all his fault. And not just this, here today, but the past three years. All him. If only he could have found another way to beat Moriarty. If he hadn’t left in the first place, jumped off that roof, would any of this had happened? It’s a question he asks himself almost every day, and has yet to come up with an answer. All he knows is he’d do whatever it takes to keep John safe. And right now, that involves somehow getting Mary’s attention back on him.
I close my eyes, remembering the next part. How I have longed to say those words to you. Every cell, every pore, has been screaming for me to tell you what you mean to me. I’ve been afraid. I’m still afraid, John. But maybe, maybe you sensed it? Did you? My conductor of light? You, who still knows me better than anyone, did you hear it?
There were times he thought he glimpsed some emotion, some desire on John’s part as well. Lingering looks, tender smiles reserved only for him. Brushes of fingers passing tea cups, casual touches throughout the day. But Sherlock tried to clamp down on his hopes that John felt anything for him. To be wrong would be devastating. And really, who would want Sherlock that way?
John sighs and closes his eyes, and for the first time that night, the offending images are completely silent. He holds onto his lifeline, and finally he sleeps.
Sherlock crawled back up John’s body, slotting their mouths together, before moving downwards. He trailed his lips over John’s neck, his shoulders, down his chest. Sherlock’s tongue darted out to swirl around the hard nub of John’s nipple, before closing his lips around it and sucking, gently.
John pulls back with a chuckle, flashing a cheeky grin at Greg. The whisperers are blissfully silent for once. Yes, he supposes, he could tell them all the wonderful things about his partner, his lover, his husband, but really, there are some things he’d rather keep for himself.
Sherlock met John’s eyes, and she forgot to breathe, the force of that gaze taking all the air right from her lungs. She could see John meant more than just the fact that she stayed, much more. There would be time later to say all the things running through her brain, but right now “You’re welcome.” would suffice. “Come here.”
Sherlock wasn’t even sure how they had become so close to be honest. Sherlock had taken one look at John and knew he was in trouble. Blond hair, blue eyes, strong compact built body, and a flirtatious smile that make Sherlock’s knees shake. He had vowed then and there to keep his distance, to be as cantankerous as possible, because this situation had “bad news” written all over it. His resolve held out for an impressive 72 hours before crumbling to dust, powerless to resist John’s many charms. Now, almost two years later, the two were frequently in the other’s company, studying, watching movies, eating takeaway together, almost everything, really. Except for this one thing.
Mycroft sighs, “He wanted out of his marriage. He wanted revenge, Sherlock. He was angry at her for having shot you. And quite unhappy over the other...assignments, on her record.”
“John, there’s something ... I should say; I-I’ve meant to say always and then never have. Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now...Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
Hearing her disparage John makes anger flare white hot in his gut. This person, this psychopath, has no right to say anything about John Watson. John, brave, honest John, with his horrible taste in jumpers and his quick temper, his loyalty and laughter. So many complexities that Sherlock admires and on which he relies. This person who is supposed to be his wife can never understand him. Sherlock tempers his rage and remembers that it is John for whom he is doing this. After this, he will finally be safe. The last piece of Moriarty's network will be gone and finally they can relax.
“John,” Sherlock moans, rocking his hips back. John presses in further, swirling his tongue around Sherlock’s hole, slow movements that have Sherlock babbling and begging, cries of his name, and “please” falling from his lips. John takes his time, laving and sucking and piercing the trembling muscle, and Sherlock is crying out for more. He moves one hand off the sofa, reaching down his body to stroke himself, only for his hand to be gripped by John and placed back on the leather.
“Brilliant,” John says, walking up to where Sherlock is standing with Lestrade with the victim. “Are we done here?”
“John, for god’s sake, what are you doing here?” Sherlock is hoping his voice sounds annoyed, because in truth he’s terrified. He needs John to leave this instant. He’s trying to think of the fastest way to get him to leave when he catches Mary watching him out of the corner of her eye. He schools his expression, attempting to calm his racing heartbeat, and turns away from her, focusing on John.
But then all breath left his lungs as he watched Sherlock, his best friend, reach the dance floor and begin to move. And dear god, could he move. John trailed his eyes over slim hips in motion, those bespoke trousers pulled taut over that luscious arse, back up to the thin fabric of that already too tight shirt pulled even tighter across Sherlock’s chest as he rolled and flexed in time with the beat. John’s mouth went dry, and every drop of blood in his body rushed straight to his cock at the sight. Sherlock was breathtaking. And god, John wanted. But he was still unsure of Sherlock’s feelings on the matter. He seemed to be enjoying blondie’s attention, the two were moving closer to one another with each beat of the music, the other bloke’s hands grasping onto sharp hipbones as he pressed in from behind. John never even realized Sherlock did this sort of thing, but here was the proof right in front of his eyes.
Normally John wouldn’t be concerned, but they had just wrapped up a particularly harrowing case, and Sherlock had stretched himself to the limit, both physically and mentally. In the end, the child had been saved, the kidnapper captured, but in the course of the apprehension, John had been injured. It was just a minor wound, a slash to the upper thigh, but to look at Sherlock one would have thought John was dying. He’d never seen that look on the detective’s face before, a mix of fury and pain that struck John breathless.
John throws his head back and laughs. The sound of it breaks something wide open inside of Sherlock. It echoes off the walls and settles into his bones, the sound of pure anguish. He hates that it is coming out of John’s mouth.
John opens his eyes fully and takes stock of the room. There is a chair pulled up next to his bed, and several paper cups discarded on the table. It looks as if someone has been here recently, although he appears to be alone at the moment. He can’t help the overwhelming feeling of disappointment that floods him at that fact. So it was just a dream then. Because if Sherlock really had said what he thought he’d heard, he’d be here, wouldn’t he?
John released his grip, his fingers lingering slightly longer before pulling completely away. “Oh, that’s- well. That’s fine.” He smiled up at Sherlock, but it held a sadness in it that hadn’t been present before.
glares left and right, but that didn’t stop the looks, the downright lusty leers thrown in Sherlock’s direction all night. The man was too bloody attractive for his own good. And John needed to get him out of here before either one of the men, or John himself, broke.
“Okay fine, I have an IQ of 176, but that’s still a genius level IQ. I have more than a few brain cells to spare, thank you very much.” He crossed his arms and all but stomped his foot at John. John fought valiantly to keep in a laugh, but in the end was overcome with a fit of giggles so hard, it took him four tries to get his ID out to show the cashier.
When he arrived at the coffee shop, he clambered out gratefully, throwing some bills at the cabbie, hoping it would be enough. It appeared to be, because he sped off without a word.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” he replied, trying to understand why Sarah’s smile didn’t send flocks of butterflies erupting through his stomach and a gentle tingling in his hands—that was, after all, his body’s response to a smile from Sherlock. And John knew he was fooling himself—he didn’t want to go on another date with Sarah. She was nice, and friendly and simple and uncomplicated, but utterly and completely
He ran a finger from the sensitive place just behind Sherlock's cock and circled it over his entrance, not yet slipping it in, just teasing. After a few moments of this, Sherlock whined and pressed back against the finger. John allowed his finger to slip in and Sherlock gasped under him at the sudden intrusion.
“Brat,” John chuckled affectionately and dipped the tip of one finger into the jelly and brought it up to Sherlock’s lips. He wrapped his lips around John’s finger and sucked lightly, flicking his tongue against the tip, causing John to take a sharp breath.
“Oh, not so bad, am I? Do you think you can make do with not-so-bad me?” he asked. Sherlock let out a sound that was an awful lot like a giggle, but if asked, he would completely deny having ever done anything that would resemble giggling. He pushed himself up and rolled them over gently so John’s softening cock slipped from him, but they remained as close together as they could as they lay on their sides.
“My brother’s coming home from uni for the weekend and it annoys him. Normally, I know ahead of time so I can…make arrangements, but I only just found out and my normal…sources don’t work well with a timetable.”
“I’m leaving, I’ll see you tomorrow,” she called. John glanced at the clock, shocked to see that it was already eleven. He had been thinking about Sherlock so much he hadn’t even noticed the time go by.
You may have noticed that I now have a (rough) estimate as too how long this will continue. That is because, friends, I have finally bullied myself into making a (rough) outline, and (sort of) know what I'm doing and what will be happening with our favorite boys.
"You arrogant arse," John said, grinning. He pulled Sherlock back to him, pressing himself against the taller man. Sherlock smirked and lowered his lips back to John's. Despite the nickname given to him by Irene Adler, when Sherlock ran his tongue across John's lower lip and nipped at it lightly with his teeth, John felt breathless and could tell that this was not the first time Sherlock was doing this. John took Sherlock's lower lip and sucked on it, earning himself a delicious, breathy moan. John felt heat pooling in the pit of his stomach just as he felt Sherlock's erection pressing into his stomach. He reached and palmed Sherlock. Sherlock moaned again, rutting against John's skilled hand.
“Yeah sure, of course it’ll be that simple,” he muttered. Then he checked his watch. Ten minutes until he got off. Fuck it, he thought. He over-analyzed everything way too much; he was just going to go for it. Leaning forward, he took Sherlock face in his hands and kissed him, gently at first, but quickly growing more intense.
“Alright, so you know my story, let’s hear yours,” he said sitting down in the armchair across from Sherlock’s.
Yet John was ridiculously loyal to a fault. He would never have even looked at another girl without thinking about his girlfriend.
“John, do you really think I need a key?” Sherlock asked, smirking as he produced a lock-pick set from the depths of his coat.
The man looked at John suspiciously, who was able to keep a straight face long enough to pay for the food before dissolving into giggles again. Every time he thought he was done, he just looked at the look on Sherlock’s face and was gone again. He looked like a cat that’s had its tail stepped on.
“No way, don’t you dare, you’re coming with my cock inside you, Sherlock Holmes,” John growled back, reaching down and swiftly unbuttoning his trousers. Sherlock lifted his hips from the bed to allow John to slide the trousers off, but John instead dug his fingers into Sherlock’s thin sides. The younger boy gasped and let out a high-pitched giggle more out of surprise than anything.
“Really? Is that so?” he asked, pressing himself closer to Sherlock, looping an arm around the thin boy to give his arse a squeeze.
Sherlock tried desperately not to think about what that would entail, because if he did, certain parts of his anatomy would make the exchange unbearably awkward. It was absolutely ridiculous. Half an hour after getting beaten to pulp, and Sherlock was a hairsbreadth away from an erection.
Sherlock, who had climbed on top of him and was straddling him in his chair, and was slowly grinding down onto him. Holy fuck, Sherlock was much better at all of this than he had any right to be. John let out a breathy moan into Sherlock’s mouth and reached down to Sherlock’s arse, squeezing lightly.
Finally, John was done. When he took his hands away, Sherlock was simultaneously relieved and crushingly disappointed.
“You don’t give the orders here, Soldier. Respect me, or I’ll make sure you won’t gain any pleasure at all from this,” said John firmly.
“Thanks,” he said. His eyes flickered briefly over the few customers who were in the shop before he said: “That girl over there has been eyeing you all night and is planning on giving you her number.” John looked over at the girl in question and shrugged.
Finally, both boys collapsed on the bed next to each other, breathing hard and still giggling softly. John reached down and laced their fingers lightly together, unable to keep himself from touching Sherlock even for a few seconds.
When their lips finally met, it was like worlds colliding, huge and explosive, but then they shifted and the sigh that John felt across his lips was a warm breeze through a sun-filled clearing, soft and so, so, sweet. He swiped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and felt sparks dance between their mouths, and swore that it was the best thing he had ever felt. It was as though it was they had never touched before—their first time was hot and wonderful, but it was rushed and hard, where this was soft and warm and perfect.
“And finally, look to the building on your right.” For the third time, John looked up to see a security camera pointed at him, only to swivel away, obviously on the command of the man on the phone.
If John wasn’t home soon he would have to just wank and accept the consequences. He pulled his trousers down and away from his heated, oversensitive skin, enjoying the brief calm as the cool air of their sitting room hit his cock.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock I’m at work, I can’t do this right now,” he said. Sherlock’s only reply was to continue kissing his way down John’s jaw stubbornly. “Sherlock I’m serious.”
“But why would you get milk when you could get chocolate milk? Chocolate milk, John. It’s genius. It’s revolutionary. It’s novel,” Sherlock said, looking at the chocolate milk with a kind of starry-eyed longing.
So, it really was all Bill’s fault that John was now in a random girl’s apartment and she was kissing down his neck and getting closer and closer to his chest and he knew that nothing would be able to happen. Perhaps Bill found it easy to get with “a cute piece of ass for the night,” and perhaps had things just ended with anyone besides Sherlock, John would be able to do it too. But it was
He sent, unsure of what else to do. He had very minimal experience with apologies, and therefore wasn’t quite sure what they entailed.
On top of that—as if there even needed to be more—there was the matter of his voice. Having only heard him quietly mutter a few words, John had never really heard his voice before, but now that he had, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to go even a day without hearing it again. There was really no reason a high schooler’s voice should be that deep.
The two of them snogged against the door until Sherlock’s knees began giving way under John’s attack. He pulled back a little bit, to allow the taller boy to breathe, before pulling him roughly into his room and pinning him to the bed.
“What are you doing with that?” Sherlock asked, disgusted. John gave the gallon of milk he was holding a bewildered look. It didn’t have a better idea of what Sherlock was talking about than John did.
“Yes, yes of course you were right…you were—that was bloody brilliant,” he sputtered. Sherlock looked at him, eyes slightly wide.
“Sherlock, wait please,” he cried, all too soon. “You have to stop, I swear your mouth is a fucking weapon.” Sherlock pulled off with an obscene pop, smirking.
"Go and get your riding crop." John said. Sherlock gasped, and sprang up almost running to the couch where he had left it after some experiment. While he was waiting, palmed himself through the fabric of his jeans, trying to calm himself. He didn't want to come too early. "Strip, then stand against the wall." John ordered. Sherlock did so with no hesitation, his cock hanging thick and fully erected between his legs. John picked up the dropped riding crop and strode over to Sherlock, who was shaking slightly with arousal. He used the crop to stroke Sherlock's muscular back and round, plump arse. God, John loved that arse.
“Sherlock, I don’t want your money. Jesus, how much is in here? Take this back, I don’t want it,” John said. He was quite positive he had seen at least two fifty pound notes. Sherlokc waved a hand dismissively scanning the alcohol aisle.
“Boyfriend then? Which is fine, by the way,” John pressed, heart almost in his throat. Sherlock looked sharply at him.
“Time away from you is, for me, not something I’d like to do again. So whatever you would like, I would have to insist that remain, acquaintances, at the least.”
“Of course. And I know that seeing me with drugs only a week or so ago must have been difficult, but please, you have to understand that I had no intention of using again. I was just…bored, and I know that that’s no excuse, but I couldn’t stop thinking about you and I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t stop thinking about you, and then I couldn’t go and see you because I had said it was over…it won’t be happening again, I was just acting on habit.” Sherlock stopped himself when he could feel himself babbling, an awful habit he had never seemed to have an issue with until he met John. But he had to make him understand that there was no cycle for Sherlock—the cycle was over and there was no way that Sherlock would be going back to it, especially when he had John.
Some trigger warnings: a mildly graphic description of a fight. And when I say mild, I mean really, super mild. Also, like a one-line reference to child abuse.
“You stopped a man from being executed?” John asked, incredulous. Sherlock looked at him, his face mischievous in the dim light of the streetlamps.
“Yeah, actually just started as a Constable a week ago, sorry how did he…?” he trailed off, looking at Sherlock.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock corrected with a smirk, “close, though.” John giggled, rolling over to look at Sherlock. Without any hesitation the taller man squirmed his way into John’s arms and tangled their legs together, hold John close. John ran a hand lightly through Sherlock’s hair, wondering why was wasn’t surprised that Sherlock was cuddler.
reasons,” he said. Sebastian got even paler before turning a bright red, as his friends shuffled awkwardly, not knowing whether to laugh or be disgusted or some combination thereof.
“I’m not hungry, but it’s okay because you eat enough for two anyway,” Sherlock replied, his voice muffled by the pillow.
John sighed. He had hoped that Sherlock would elaborate, but it seemed like that wouldn’t be happening. He tried to pry it out of him anyway.
Then, Sherlock was joined by a girl, and John really wanted to be anywhere else but there. God what if this was a date? he thought. And here he was, staring at them like a creepy old man.
Just as he had been about to ask her, he came in again, and John was reminded-somewhat forcefully—why he had been so fascinated by the boy. After he had muttered his order and took his place in the corner—his corner, as John would come to call it—John turned to Sarah.
John added a third finger and fucked Sherlock with them until he felt that he was loose enough for him. He slipped his fingers out of Sherlock and was reaching for the condoms when he was stopped by Sherlock's hand.
John lay awake in his bed that night, thinking about the strange boy sleeping just down the hall and wondering what would happen in the morning.
“Yeah, you’re right, let’s go,” he said quickly, taking Sherlock’s hand and leading them out of the shop, locking the door behind him. When Sherlock stuck his arm out to hail a cab, John was suddenly struck by similar it all was to the other time they had done this. He reached out and pulled Sherlock’s hand down before he even fully thought it through. Sherlock looked at him curiously. “It’s nice out, can we walk? It’s not far.”
“Go do your job,” Sherlock said. John was tempted to stay just where he was just to show Sherlock that he didn’t have to do what he said, but decided that his job was worth more than a childish show of stubbornness.
Despite that, John cock was resting so temptingly against John’s toned stomach that Sherlock couldn’t help planting a few light kisses against the base of his cock, slowly adding tongue the further up he got, listening to the increased rate of John’s breathing.
The day after, however, John had a date with Sarah Sawyer, the pretty girl who worked with him at the coffee shop, and the mysterious boy was pushed from his mind.
He sincerely hoped that nobody would walk in during the last five minutes of his shift, because Sherlock was a far better kisser than he had any right to be.
“Who is this?” he asked, his eyes on the security camera trained on him. He was sure that was what the man was referring to.
“Sherlock, talk to me,” he said, wondering what it was that Sherlock had never done. He knew that he had sex before, obviously, so he didn’t know what was bothering the boy. Sherlock avoided John’s gaze, his cheeks and chest pink with embarrassment.
"One," he said somewhat shakily. Again, John snapped his wrist, a little harder this time. He could already see the welts forming on the detective's fair skin. His own cock ached in response.
Yes, I am aware that it is Saturday and not Sunday, but tomorrow is my mom's birthday, so just in case I don't have a chance to put this up tomorrow, I decided I'd put it up today.
“God, you are so gorgeous,” John murmured into Sherlock’s skin, unable to stop the words from spilling out as he watched Sherlock ride out his orgasm. Watching Sherlock come was definitely among the most beautiful things John had ever seen. Sherlock smiled shyly, a blush crawling up his chest that had nothing to d with his recent orgasm.
As always, I love love love hearing from you guys either on here, or you can stop by and chat with me on tumblr at astronautsxandxaliens.tumblr.com
Which turned out not to be particularly difficult—Sherlock was not only ridiculously sensitive, he was also quite loud. John should have expected that, he supposed, given how loud Sherlock was in general. John continued licking his way slowly down Sherlock’s pale chest until he reached the top of the thin boy’s trousers. He glanced up at Sherlock for permission before slowly undoing the top button of his jeans. Sherlock met his gaze and nodded briefly but impatiently.
How John had survived that hour and half torture was a mystery to him. He couldn’t simply get up and walk away because what if Sherlock did recognize him and said something to him? He was unprepared and off-balance and not in any way in the right frame of mind to control himself enough to have a normal conversation.
“Second year in uni, training to be a doctor, working here to pay for it now that the rugby scholarship has fallen through due to a shoulder injury. Your doctor thinks you might be able to play again, don’t listen to her, she’s an idiot, any stress on that rotator cuff would cause irreparable damage. Raised by a military man, would have followed in his footsteps had it not been for the injury,” he said in rapid-fire speech, spitting each word out like it was burning his tongue. “Shame, really, you would have done well in the army, you love adrenaline and react well under pressure,” he added almost as an afterthought. John gaped.
. Go, you’ll be late to your…whatever it is you’re going to,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. He still hadn’t opened his eyes. He cursed himself for not listening to John when he talked. Maybe then he would have had some kind of forewarning.
“I’d like to meet Mrs. Hudson, she sounds like quite a woman,” John said, laughing, thinking that any woman who would trust a teenager enough to take him to Florida so that he could get her husband executed, was probably a person that John wanted to meet. Especially, if that teenager was Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t have very many friends in his life, and the fact that this woman would choose to be one after knowing him for such a short time said a lot about her ability to judge character, in John’s mind.
“Sherlock, are you sure? Let me take your temperature,” John said, coming close to Sherlock. He could smell him—cheap aftershave and the generic brand of deodorant, and underneath it, the smell of tea and John. Sherlock held his breath wanting to leave, but knowing if he got up, his arousal would be blatantly apparent.
"Come for me, Sherlock," he said, reaching around with the hand not in Sherlock's hair and giving his cock three short pulls before Sherlock was coming in thick ropes all over the bed. His eyes were still closed and he seemed unable to stop shouting John's name - or at least unaware he was doing it. He clenched tight around John's cock as he came, and John followed soon after with a final thrust. He buried himself deep into the younger boy, feeling his come coat Sherlock's walls.
He slipped his phone back into his pocket and walked back into the kitchen to eat dinner with his family, feeling better about the situation, and hoping it was enough.
“You’ll forgive me for not believing you,” Mycroft said. “Particularly after last night. In fact, that’s twice now that Sherlock has spent the night at with you. Shall we expect a happy announcement soon?”
do it in the most dramatic way possible. Mycroft gave a small, dry chuckle, even though he clearly wasn’t amused.
Yet he couldn’t stop himself from looking over to the corner periodically. If Sherlock wasn’t hitting on him then why was he acting so strange?
hahaha hello my good friends!! If you have commented asking me about updates - here it is and I'm sorry I haven't answered, I'm working on it. If you haven't commented asking me about updates - here it is, anyway!
“Oh, look who finally decided to join us again.” Sherlock looked up into the cold eyes of his professor.
TW: as stated above, this chapter is basically just smut. Sherlock is 3 years younger than John, so if any of that squicks you out, you can probably just skip this chapter, there really isn't any plot.
“John, you there?” Sarah asked with a small smile. John jerked himself back into the present and smiled back.
“You,” Sherlock breathed out, finally meeting John’s eyes. He said it so quietly that John almost thought he imagined it, but then John leaned forward towards him, and Sherlock didn’t move away—only kept his eyes locked on John’s.
“Okay,” he replied, his voice hoarse and breathy. John gently pushed him to his feet, and he stood on shaky legs. John tried not to smirk again, but knew he failed.
“Sherlock? Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to you?” John exclaimed when Sherlock entered the shop.
"Count for me. We will do seven." John said, and with no more warning, snapped his wrist, hearing the smack of the crop on the skin just below Sherlock's arse. The taller man moaned, rutting against the air in a futile attempt to find friction for his leaking, throbbing cock.
“Sherlock,” John said in a strangled voice. The younger boy paid no mind to him and continued his journey down John’s neck.
Finally, finally, the head of his cock was up against Sherlock's opening. He pushed forward slowly until the tip was inside of Sherlock, and then he stopped as both of them caught their breath.
With (slightly) trembling fingers, Sherlock presented his ticket and passport to the bored looking security guard. Sherlock didn’t blame her for being bored, as he looked around the room there was absolutely nobody of any interest at all. For the amount of security that went into flying, he was standing in a room with a very limited amount of people who were even remotely capable of blowing up a plane, and Sherlock was one of them. Most of the others were security guards.
“Don’t you have class or something?” Sherlock said peevishly. John looked down at his watch and cursed.
He entered the coffee shop, breathing in the smell of coffee and pastries. John smiled largely when he saw Sherlock, giving an enthusiastic wave.
“Hello, John,” he said when he reached the counter, lowering his lashes in a way he knew John loved. He saw John’s breath quicken almost imperceptibly—he only saw it because he was looking for it.
When they had made it out of the (ridiculous and unnecessary) security, Mrs. Hudson handed him both of their boarding passes and left him in charge of finding the right gate. Sherlock did so with no problem, of course, airports were designed with even the most imbecilic of people in mind. Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes at them all, shuffling along with no more activity in their brains than ants. He thought about what John would say if he saw him roll his eyes, and then did it anyway, just to spite the imagined John in his mind. He wasn’t with Sherlock and that was
“Oh no, you’ll have to wait until I get back to take care of that,” he said grinning evilly. Sherlock felt his grin drop like stone from the sky.
Hello my lovelies!! Long time, no update and as always I am full to bursting with excuses none of which matter because I am here now!! As an extra reward for being extra super duper patient this chapter is like double the size of all the other ones so there please don't hate me :)
“Don’t worry about it, John, I have it on very good authority that your age doesn’t bother him in the least, and it shouldn’t bother you either, he’s perfectly capable of making his own decisions, so you needn’t feel like you’re taking advantage of him,” Sherlock said, resting a hand on John’s knee. John twitched under his palm, but didn’t move away.
“Well, I always have been,” John rubbed the back of his neck, moving over to where Sherlock was by the piano. “I’ve never been able to do …
“I love you too,” Sherlock said and John’s felt as though his heart were filling with the weight of those words.
Eventually, John turned a corner and saw the entrance to the large auditorium. A banner with lights hanging over the top of the open door read:
“Oh, get over it. You look gorgeous either way, you big softy.” John quipped, grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him into him. He kissed him with vigour and Sherlock smiled into his mouth, his hands in John’s hair. When they pulled apart, Sherlock was grinning freely, a giggle escaping his chest.
Sherlock could feel John’s erection through his pants and he was unable to stop himself from reaching out to feel how hard he truly was. John groaned at the small amount of friction and had to move away from his touch, else he would come undone then and there.
“Uh – sorry,” he took a deep breath, trying to quell his wild thoughts so he could coherently form sentences together and pay the driver.
John couldn’t help but smile at Sherlock’s date being dismally rejected and he watched as the pair walked further away, their voices fading as they moved out onto the main road. Lucas pulled a pair of keys from his pocket and unlocked a small silver hatchback, opening the passenger door to beckon Sherlock inside, who flashed him a warm smile of thanks as he entered the vehicle. Lucas moved around to the driver’s side and jumped inside, starting the car.
Mary’s grip was resolute and she pulled him into her arms, humming a tune as she began to sway with him, her arms around his neck. John put his hands on her waist, succumbing to her attempts. He followed her movements as she turned her head and laid it on his chest, her humming low and tuneless. He lowered his head, placing his nose in her hair – it smelled of coconut shampoo and perfume. The scent reminded him of the first night he had spent with Mary all those years ago – they were both drunk at the time and John wasn’t able to last due to the whiskey in his system, however Mary had stayed, saying she was enjoying herself regardless of whether he was able to perform or not. They had ended up in bed: legs tangled together, his arms around her, nose in her hair. He was happy. In those first moments, he wouldn’t have dreamed he would be in the situation he had put himself in now.
As the music began to taper off, taking John’s breath with it, Sherlock’s movements began to slow, his limbs becoming softer as he twisted to a stop in the middle of the floor. There was nothing loud about this end: it was quiet and final in its movement, yet the action resonated through John’s chest as if Sherlock were screaming at him.
“Yes, that’s right,” John answered, “would you like a seat, Mrs. Hudson?” He made to move so the woman could sit, ignoring the audible sigh from Sherlock, but Mrs. Hudson shook her head.
“The invitation you left behind … I thought I might just …” Sherlock’s voice was low and hoarse, reflective of how he was feeling inside. “I don’t actually know why I’m here, to be honest.”
“What? Tell me!” John was quite worried now, watching Sherlock become more frazzled as the seconds wore on.
Mary happily, her light eyes twinkling. “I know,” she answered, excited. “It’s you and me forever after this. Mr and Mrs Watson.”
to do or something instead of prying into my private life?” John was truly reaching the end of his tether with her and he stood, reaching over to the door to start shutting it.
Sherlock pulled John against him tighter, smiling sleepily against his skin. He yawned, his fingers sleepily tracing down John’s back to settle on his bum.
It had been a couple of weeks since he had seen or spoken to Sherlock, yet he still felt that deep sadness in his chest when he thought about him and sometimes, at night, he would call Sherlock’s phone, just to listen to it ring for what felt like years and end in Sherlock’s voicemail, his honeyed tones settling in John’s mind and infiltrating his dreams. He would always hang up before the beep, not really having anything to say anymore; all he needed was to hear Sherlock’s voice. He was confused because he knew he needed to move on from him and with his marriage approaching fast, he realised that he needed to figure out how to do it soon.
“Uh … hi.” John said awkwardly, suddenly aware of how creepy it was that he had followed Sherlock to his home.
After his lesson with Sherlock and now this, he was feeling pent up and frustrated. Mary was bloody gorgeous and he loved her, what on earth was going on in his brain that he couldn’t get it up for her?
Marlene took the form and raised her hands in surrender, scoffing under her breath. “Alright! No need to get grumpy at me as well,” she said.
John moved his mouth away from Sherlock and pulled the covers back so he could look up at him. He was dazed and half asleep, his hair askew, a languid smile crossing his face.
“N-nice to meet you,” John stammered, wondering at who this woman could be. Sherlock had never mentioned her before and she certainly wasn’t his mother. Either way, her kindly and relaxed nature made John immediately take a likening to her.
After cleaning up the rest of the kitchen and finishing the emails on his computer, John finally got around to setting up the couch to sleep, shattered. He settled himself down into the blanket and closed his eyes, only to be woken up by his phone vibrating.
As he moved into the living room, the flat was deathly silent, all but for John’s quiet breathing and the faint sound of rain on the rooftop. The dim light straining through the windows made the room dusky and morose, which ironically fitted in with exactly how John was feeling. He spotted Sherlock’s ruined sheets sitting in a heap on the floor where he had left them last night and on the countertop in the kitchen lay their mess of empty food containers. The flat contained snippets of their love, the echo ricocheting onto any tangible surface and John allowed the memories to slip into his mind, storing them in a reservoir labelled ‘Sherlock Holmes’.
John mumbled something about a shower and he carefully pulled out of Sherlock, taking his hand. Leading him out of the bedroom and to the bathroom, they hopped inside the shower together, letting the hot water wash over them, cascading over their heads. John looked at Sherlock who was standing under the stream of water and he couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of him, hair completely sopping wet and now very straight under the stream of water, swathing his face in wet, tangled tendrils. He had never pictured Sherlock with straight hair, but now that he had seen it, he realised how comical he looked.
Harriet remained silent, smoothing out the back of his hair with light, stroking fingertips. He heard her sigh.
"Look lively," she quipped, patting his foot which was concealed underneath the blanket. "Today's the day!"
Sherlock was sitting down at the kitchen table working on his chemistry experiment when John bustled in, holding up two bags.
“John, listen to me,” Sherlock starts, eyeing Mary warily where she stands five feet to his right, “now is not the time, we can discuss things later. But you need to leave. Now.”
. The thought of you brings a peal of joy into my heart. Are you still on the tarmac? Did you hear the news? Do you know I am coming back, coming home?
One minute. We are landing. In just a few moments we will see where I belong in your life. Is there room for me still? I dare to hope. Do you want me, John? Somehow? Some way? Whatever role it is I’ll take it. Please say there is a space for me, however small. A chance to at least be your friend. I’ll always be there, John. I promised. Will you make room? The door is opening, and I am home.
“Yes, thanks to you, idiot.” Sherlock forces a small smile. John, ever the soldier, ever the doctor, worrying about him first. “What about you, are you hurt?”
Sherlock could only nod, as he didn’t trust his voice to speak. He watched as John turned back around, slamming the door behind him.
And then, the miraculous news that no, the plane is coming back. Finding out that Sherlock almost OD’d. The realisation that it was a suicide mission on which Mycroft had sent his brother. John was barely hanging onto his sanity, trying to hold it all together. And just when John thought it couldn’t get any worse, Sherlock disappeared.  For two months. Two bloody months. Not a single text, email, call, nothing. John wasn’t sure if he was hiding out, drugged out of his mind, or just ignoring him. The only thing that kept him sane was his communication with Mycroft. Mycroft provided just enough info to reassure him that Sherlock was safe. Their codeword: No List.
After three full minutes, “John, I did solve the case,” Sherlock ventured, looking up at John from beneath soggy curls.
Sherlock smirked, shifting his hips again, his large hands sliding between John and the mattress to grab at his arse again. He leaned down and sucked at a spot behind John’s ear, before lightly nipping the abused skin. There would be a mark tomorrow, but John didn’t care. It would be more evidence that Sherlock is here. Was real. Was his.
But what those people don’t see is the other side. The soft smile that greets John each morning. The way his eyes crinkle around the corners, the pale irises sparkling with delight when he sees John has awoken in their shared bed. They don’t feel the soft brushes of his hands over John’s face, or the velvet slide of his fingertips over his skin. They don’t feel the tender kisses and the murmured “good mornings” that fall out of that exquisite mouth. They don’t know the feeling of that body, writhing in pleasure underneath him, flushed and beautiful, lost in the throes of ecstasy.
John did just that, sealing his lips over Sherlock’s, and wasting no time running his tongue along the seam. Sherlock moaned, and John licked inside, tasting the sound and chasing more. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders and held on as John ravished his mouth again and again. With one final bite to that lower lip, John pulled back, observing his handiwork. Sherlock looked wrecked. And beautiful. Lips swollen, hair mused.
Sherlock stalks down the hall towards operating theatre 8, hoping to find out what has happened to John. He approaches the room with a sense of dread, assaulted with a strange mixture of emotions. He is terrified to know what is happening. Terrified to hear the words that John has been taken from him for good. But at the same time, he needs to know how he is. Is he alive? Is he going to recover?
“The East Wind takes us all in the end...it seeks out the unworthy and plucks them the Earth,” I’d said. You’d smiled at me then, but did you hear it?
John reaches over to the bedside table and grabs the lube then slides his pants off, kicking them out from under the covers. He slicks up both hands, then resumes his ministrations, firmer strokes, base to tip, adding a twist at the end just the way he likes. He spreads his legs wider, and with his other hand, he reaches below to caress his balls, rolling them and tugging gently as he works his cock. In his mind it is Sherlock’s larger hands on him, caressing, stroking, moving further back as  his mouth bobs and sucks on his length.
He’ll what, Sherlock wondered. And why did he sound so sad? Why was he so upset over a silly tradition? Like Greg had said, it didn’t mean anything. Did it? Only Sherlock wanted it to mean something. He wanted John to kiss him for real. Not for some stupid party trick because some plant was hanging over an arbitrary spot. He should be grateful he got the chance he did. He should be thanking whoever hung that in the flat for the chance to feel John’s lips against his, if only the once. But he didn’t have any room in his heart right now to be grateful. How would he continue on now, keep his feelings under control, now that he knew that yes, John’s lips were as soft as they looked. And now that he’s had a taste, how would he keep himself from craving more? More John? It’s impossible, and all he’d worked to preserve, lost, due to a stupid trick.
“It’ll be like our first Christmas,” he had said, wistful look in his deep blue eyes, and Sherlock couldn’t say no. Not when John looked like that. Anything to make him happy.
Sherlock’s eyes drift away from the page that he has been attempting to read for the last hour, and towards the shoreline where John is currently emerging from the water, the sun glistening off his shoulders as he makes his way up the beach. Sherlock tries to look back down at the paragraph he was reading, but the water droplets still clinging to John’s skin are glittering and drawing his focus. He watches John move closer, the muscles in his thighs rippling as he makes his way through the thick sand, and Sherlock’s mouth goes dry. Days of swimming and sun have given John the appearance of a golden god, and even though Sherlock knows he is being ridiculous, all control has flown out the window. The only room left in his head is currently occupied by increasingly erotic fantasies. Fantasies of John fisting his hands in Sherlock's curls and fitting his mouth to his, rubbing his wet body against his own as he sucks marks into his neck. Sherlock sliding his hands under the waistband of those trunks to grab John’s arse and pull him close. Sherlock shakes his head firmly and lowers his book so it is covering his lap and takes a deep, shuddering breath to steady himself as John steps close to his chair to grab his towel.
“Well. No one anticipated Jim sending his second to play housewife. How was it? You must have been dreadfully bored, playing the doctor’s wife. Tell me, did you ever love John?”
me. Times when your gaze lingered on my form and seared into my veins like fire. Times when I was so tempted to reach out and see if the promise held in that gaze was real. Stag night was a close thing, John. I can still see it. Still feel it, your hand on my leg, your fingers pressing into my thigh. You wanted me then. I could sense it in your movement, in your eyes. How much further would you have gone? I wanted to find out. Lean forward and capture your wrist, move your hand higher until you could see how much I desired you. Instead I stayed still, let you retreat. But, oh John, how I wanted to take what was on offer. Did you know? Or did you think me indifferent? But I let you go. Back to her, back to the life you created in my absence. Back to where you belong. Back to your life without me.
“A brother whom I don’t see. My parents are retired in Dorset – I try to avoid seeing most of them at all times, however sometimes when the occasion calls for it, it can’t be helped.” Sherlock spoke, cold. “What about yourself? Any family here?”
“Do you want to find somewhere to sit?” John suddenly asked. He knew Mary was going to be late and he wanted time to talk to Sherlock; to just spend time with him was everything he could have dreamed of.
“You don’t have a partner then?” Sherlock suddenly wasn’t looking at John; he seemed to be focusing intensely on his drink, watching the bubbles rise slowly to the top.
“Perfect,” Sherlock stated simply, moving over to the piano and switching off the music player which was on the floor next to it, plugged into the wall. “You were perfect, John. I don’t know what you were talking about when you said you were shit.”
He fell forward onto Sherlock and pushed himself in deeper, both the men crying out. John buried his face into Sherlock’s chest both of them lying still for a moment, breath raggedly escaping them. Enveloped in each other’s wet heat, John felt Sherlock placing kisses along his shoulder, his legs wrapping completely around him so they were flush with each other.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, John. It’s okay. I just had a nightmare, is all.” Sherlock moved over to John with his water and pulled him into his chest with one arm, placing a soft kiss on his head. “You go back to bed – I’ll be there in a moment.”
Turning, he spied Sherlock still standing on the steps of his house, phone to his ear as he looked down the road towards John. He couldn’t stop the smile from spreading across his face at the sight of Sherlock standing there. It was a glimmer of hope.
. Grow up a bit, John.” Her voice was hard. She was repeating her usual trope of ‘drawing a line’. “Enough is enough. You got yourself into this, so you’ve got to get yourself out. There’s no point in you moping around like a bloody sissy.”
“No, no, of course not,” John turned to face Sherlock, placing his hand on his cheek; his lips were still wet and John had to stop himself from leaning in again to taste them once more. “You’re perfect … it’s just …”
done. John felt incredibly stupid, standing in the middle of the room with Sherlock scrutinising him with his penetrating gaze. How was he supposed to ignore everything in the room with that man basically
Attempting to shake off the feeling, John stripped out of his underwear and stepped into the hot shower, allowing it to run over his face and down his body. But instead of sobering him up, the feeling of the heat on his body and the water running over his shaft made him more aroused.
“So that’s it then? You’re going to be one of those husbands who lie to their wife for their entire marriage? That’s not how these things work, John.” Harriet was unfazed by his outburst of aggression; instead, she continued goading him. “You’re a selfish bloody prick.”
“John, please,” Sherlock finally whined, sliding a hand up John’s shirt to feel the muscle of his stomach. John shivered, and began kissing down Sherlock’s neck, but kept his actions slow, straddling Sherlock’s slim hips. He had pulled himself away from Sherlock’s gorgeous neck the first time they had sex in favor of doing it fast and hard, but he didn’t want to have to do that this time. Instead, he took his time tracing his veins and nipping lightly and birthmarks and tasting different parts of his neck simply because he could. When he finally worked his way down to Sherlock’s collarbone, he was trembling and whimpering. Every time a sound passed through Sherlock’s lips, John could feel seconds before in his throat, and it was something he was not quite ready to give up.
“Look, Mike’s told me about your bloke, okay, and I’m sorry, mate, but you can’t just keep locking yourself away in your apartment and hoping the next Bond film will hold all the answers to your problems.” The words came rushing through the speaker of John’s phone as though the words were burning Bill’s mouth and he wanted them out as soon as possible. John sighed, looking guiltily at the stack of Bond films sitting next to him.
“Take yours off too,” Sherlock said, ignoring the blush, as well, as John’s smirk. John lifted his arms and allowed Sherlock to take his shirt off for him, wishing he had thought to go to the gym recently, and had cut back a bit on the takeaway.
“Sherlock…” John said, in what was clearly supposed to be a firm tone of voice, but it was breathy and sounded a bit too much like a moan to be believable. John took a breath like he was about to say something else, but before he could, Sherlock covered his mouth with his own. Sherlock reached up and cupped John’s face with his large hands running his tongue lightly over his John’s bottom lip.
Soon—much, much too soon, in Sherlock’s opinion—John was turning off the lights and locking up the door.
. And she fit perfectly into John’s life, not because they fit perfectly together, but because John’s life was just as boring.
His phone buzzed when he was leaving and he looked down to see, with some surprise that John had texted him.
ahh I know, the angst! Please don't hate me, and please don't worry, I promise, this story will have a happy ending!
John pushed them onto the bed, but kept the kiss slow and soft, despite Sherlock’s best efforts to make it more intense.
"What is it, Sherlock?" he asked, smirking. Sherlock groaned at the loss of John's mouth and pushed at his head slightly, urging him back toward his cock. With a soft chuckle, John returned his mouth to its earlier position on Sherlock's cock.
“Thank you for your input, we will test both the gun and the wounds accordingly,” said the man, clearly forcing the courteous words through gritted teeth. Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“So, you’re joining the police?” John asked, smothering a piece of toast in raspberry jelly. Lestrade cleared his throat and nodded.
“The case, John! I read about it in the paper yesterday a woman found killed in her house after having received a strange letter in the mail the day before. The letter and the kitchen table were found burned. They’ve just arrested the neighbor, stupid move, he wasn’t even at the scene of crime long enough to do any damage.”
“You aren’t very frightening,” John answered, his fists clenching themselves at his sides. Mycroft gave that dry, unamused chuckle once more.
So he decided he would ask him about it. Maybe Sherlock needed help or something. Of course, it was all for the boy’s well-being, not at all an excuse for John to get to talk to his crush.
“Do you want to go sit down? Some coffee?” John asked. Sherlock nodded and turned away. Unsure what it was that he was nodding too, John simply followed, figuring that Sherlock wanted coffee he would tell him. They settled into their seats, and John’s heart ached from how familiar it all was.
He took a deep, shuddering breath when he thought about it again. He had to stop thinking about it. He gripped the cushions of the coach where he was sprawled out so his hands wouldn’t involuntarily touch his erection.
“Oh my god, I thought the other lads were taking a piss,” he said, looking at Sherlock as though he wasn’t quite sure he was real.
So he knew what he had to do. For the both them. Just one night to get it out of their systems. Then they would both be able to move on with their lives. Quit cold-turkey. Though he hated to end his time with John, he knew it had to happen soon before he lost control.
“Now if you had some hard evidence that would support that, I would be happy to listen to you Mr. Holmes. Until then, I would ask that you keep your speculations to yourself.”
not understanding. So after observing many couples interact with one another through “flirting,” he decided to try it out himself.
“Not helping, Sherlock,” John said, leaning back when he felt Sherlock’s hands travel up to his chest. Sherlock pulled away, smirking, leaving John feeling cold, even though the night was warm. He finally managed to lock the door and he turned away with relief, only to meet Sherlock’s eyes, dark with arousal. The breath left him in a gasp and took one step and pressed himself against the taller boy.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed, the word stretched over a moan. “Please, harder, Captain.” John smiled and gave in, setting a bruising pace. Sherlock gave a yell and arched up off the bed, precome pooling on his stomach where his cock lay.
“I think you just have,” he replied. John giggled and bit down on the skin in retaliation, pulling a choked gasp from Sherlock. He sat up to pull off Sherlock’s shirt and ran his hands across Sherlock’s pale chest, wondering how his imagination could have failed him so spectacularly. None of his wet dreams could possibly compare to the beauty of Sherlock there, in the flesh.
The third encounter didn’t happen in the coffee shop, oddly enough, but in the uni library. John had decided to get some studying done on his day off and had looked up from his organic chemistry to see a very familiar curly dark head bent over a thick textbook, scribbling notes without even lifting his eyes from the page. John had reacted in a very mature, adult manner—by lifting up his book so it stood vertically on the table and hiding behind it, peeking around it occasionally.
“Oh, John, didn’t you know? I actually came here to have sex with him, not you, goodnight,” Sherlock said, turning away as though to leave, and John caught his sleeve and pulled him back with a laugh.
“Yes, Sherlock, we’re friends. In case it has escaped your notice, friends don’t really do this sort of thing,” he said gesturing in between them. John wasn’t quite sure why he was protesting so much. He knew that he had been attracted to the tall boy for ages, and he was finally getting the chance to act on it, and here he was—resisting.
The drive was surprisingly short, though John couldn’t figure out where they had stopped. It seemed to be in front of some sort of warehouse. He got out, and walked toward a tall figure leaning on an umbrella.
Finally, finally, the cab slowed to a stop outside of John’s flat and the two stumbled out, the cabbie seeming just as happy to see them go as they were to leave. Once again, Sherlock pressed himself as close as he could to John as the shorter man struggled to find the right key for the lock. When he finally managed it—a difficult task with Sherlock slowly licking and nibbling at his earlobe—he stumbled into the flat, and had Sherlock shoved up against the door before either of them could even take a breath. He attacked Sherlock’s mouth with his own, plundering it roughly. Sherlock could only lean heavily against the door for support and give breathy moans, digging his fingers into John’s arse.
“Everything okay?” Sarah asked, smiling. He smiled back at her, though it was more than a little forced.
“You’re not serious, are you?” John asked. Sherlock merely nodded to the door, where a couple had just walked in, looking grateful to get out of the rain.
But he supposed that Lestrade was not the worst company they could have been in. And it would be helpful to have a friend on the force for when they would inevitably arrest the wrong person again.
“I told you to do whatever you needed to,” John said, with a shrug. Sherlock looked away, unable to meet John’s gaze again. Instead, he laid a hand on John’s tanned chest and admired the contrast between John’s tan skin and his own, milky complexion. He opened his mouth as though he was going to say something, then looked up at John and found that he didn’t need to say it because John already knew and understood.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes and I’m a forensic scientist with Scotland Yard, and I’m telling you, there is no way that is a murder suicide,” he spat out, unbelieving that somehow, the American police were even more idiotic than the Scotland Yard. The man he was talking to (John probably would have remembered his name, but to Sherlock he was only an inconvenience) visibly struggled not to roll his eyes.
“John, you haven’t left this shop before two in the morning in weeks. It’s fine, I’ll do it,” she said, giving his arm a small squeeze. John abruptly remembered that he had been planning on asking her out again, but everything with Sherlock had pushed it from his mind.
“No, they’re from earlier,” said Sherlock in a slightly choked voice. John’s fingers were warm and calloused and it took everything in him not to simply melt into the touch. John looked sharply at him.
"Stop," he gasped, "please John, I'll come if you don't stop." John smirked again as he pulled away from Sherlock, adjusting his own cock from within the confines of his trousers.
"Bloody hell, Sherlock! How many times do I have to tell you, no experiments in the kitchen! This is why! First those absolutely absurd people at the surgery, and I just want to go home and relax, and instead I have to take care of you! Is it really that difficult to keep your experiments-"
You should have just stayed away, everybody likes it better that way,” Sebastian spat into his face. Sherlock flinched away, trying to block out the words. He retaliated in the only way he knew how.
"Tall, black, two sugars," he said with practiced ease. After a few moments, he stated, "you're new here."
He got dressed quickly, running late to class (again), because of Sherlock (again). Sorting through his things, he quickly found a pen and paper and scribbled a note telling Sherlock he had class. He knew Sherlock would probably roll his eyes and mutter “obviously” under his breath, but he didn’t want him to think and John had left because he wanted to.
despite having taken advanced chemistry last year, I'm really pretty clueless so if there's a mistake just roll with it, please.
He really needed to get up soon and go to class. He gave himself another six minutes to lay awake and savour the fact that he was currently cuddling (
The fourth encounter happened in the coffee shop once again. Sherlock came in just as he had done before, but there was something different about him this time. When he walked up to the counter John noticed his pupils were dilated—not that John was looking at his eyes, because he wasn’t, really—and his hands were shaking.
“Take yours off too,” he murmured into John’s hot mouth, pushing the coffee-stained shirt up John’s chest. They broke away from each other for a moment to allow it to slip off, before coming back together, Sherlock’s large hands exploring the previously unavailable skin. John gasped into Sherlock’s mouth before sliding down his body to return to his earlier position between his legs. He pulled Sherlock’s pants off hastily and found himself face to face with Sherlock’s cock. He could honestly say he didn’t want to be anywhere else. It was shaped like the rest of him—long and somewhat thin—and John was practically salivating for it.
Sherlock sat up, bringing their mouths back together and pushed his hands under John’s shirt. He felt the definition of John’s muscles from rugby, and got impossibly harder.
“No thanks, I don’t think I will.” He started walking once more, when the payphone near him began ringing. He glanced at it briefly before disregarding it. The car with the strange woman pulled up next to him again. He refused to look at her, but she cleared her throat pointedly.
“Alrigh,’” she said, her eyes not leaving his hand as he reached down to drop the bills in her cup. He pulled his phone out and pulled up the picture that Mrs. Hudson had sent him of her husband. He showed the homeless woman his screen.
“Get on with it,” John growled above him, once again fisting his hand in Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock licked it once from root to tip, before taking the smooth head into his mouth and lightly swirling his tongue around the slit. John moaned, throwing his head back, and Sherlock shivered, pressing his palm against his own erection to give himself some relief.
John lay awake in bed that night, his mind spinning over his impending marriage with Mary. He was wondering whether Sherlock would realise the date was merely days away and whether he knew that John was going through with it. He wondered whether Sherlock was moving on just as John was trying to.
John allowed his eyes to close, enveloping himself in the feeling of Sherlock’s things, allowing the whispers of Sherlock’s essence to become entrenched in his mind. He wasn’t sure when he would ever be able to smell or feel him again and he wanted to hold onto this forever.
John slipped his hand in between Sherlock’s cheeks and began stroking at his perineum and soon Sherlock was jerking unintentionally from the sensation.
Sherlock’s fingers hovered over John’s lips, which were slightly pouted. He had wondered so many nights about how John’s lips would feel against his, how John would taste inside his mouth. And so gently, gently Sherlock traced one soft finger over the cupids bow on John’s lips. Sherlock sighed as he felt the soft plushness of John and he couldn’t help but run his finger along his lips and down to his jawline. He traced oh, so soft fingertips along John’s jaw, which was slightly shaded with his afternoon stubble.
“No,” John answered immediately. “I haven’t seen her in a long while. It’s well and truly over between us.”
Moving into the room, Sherlock met him halfway, his eyes regarding him calmly. There was a brief moment of silence before Sherlock let out a small
John hesitated, before clicking reply and contemplating what he was supposed to tell her: “it’s going well, I’m extremely attracted and intrigued by him, and he’s taking me out to dinner”?
A sigh from Mary. “I know it’s been a long day, but the least you could have done is acted like you actually
?!” Mary’s face was a mix of shock and amusement, and her incredulous tone did nothing to quell the ever growing shade of crimson that was now covering his cheeks and neck.
