Instead of replying, JARVIS brought up a video; the camera had to be a hand held one with the wonky angle, but it looked like it was filming a lab; in the centre of the lab was a huge chunk of ice. JARVIS fast-forwarded the video, which remained focussed on the ice, if you ignored the person stepping over to switch the camera off and on occasionally.
“Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.” Fury challenged, and as Tony’s eyes slid over to Steve’s for a moment before he looked away, the young sentinel felt anger bubbling inside him.
“Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects.” She said, picking up a chair from the floor, setting it up right and sitting down.
Steve felt warmed to the core with the look in Dr Erskine’s eyes. “Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh?”
(no one called it a wireless anymore) as it didn’t have any of the programmes he’d wanted to listen to, then sat with a novel in his hand on the couch and stared at the wall for a long time, listening to every sound he could hear in the apartment block without enhancing his senses too much.
“I-I’ll get Howard on the line. He’ll know what to do.” She sounded scared, and the thought of his guide turned Steve’s stomach; Howard had no super serum to protect him from Steve’s death. They were good friends and this was going to tear his guide in two… Steve just had to hope he’d survive.
“They can probably hold him better than we could, if they can use magic too.” Steve figured as he sat down. “When do we need to be there?”
“So, he is a person who exists only on your… computer? System?” He barely knew what he was talking about, never mind the right terminology, but there was a fond smile tugging at Stark’s lips that Steve rather liked.
Bucky’s eyes lifted and he stared almost desperately at Steve. In his whole eight years and two months of life, Steve had dealt with agonising pain more than a handful of times and so he knew his friend needed a distraction. Unfortunately, Bucky had always been the best one to distract him from his own problems; well, unless you counted Steve’s Ma – her hugs were the best, with her strong arms over his back and her general smell and just the fact that she was there. But Steve wasn’t hugging Bucky when he had head lice, he could keep the little bugs to himself.
Who just travelled through Italy? But maybe the man had some other mission he was on at the same time. “If we haven’t moved on by then.” Steve frowned as he watched Philips arguing with someone else now. “I don’t think Cooper has cheered up the troops like he was hoping to.”
“Wait. You know what you’re doing?” One of the soldiers asked, and Steve was surprised to feel a note of concern directed at him.
“You okay?” Tony asked, resting a hand on his shoulder as they both ignored Loki’s mocking of Steve.
“Not alone now.” Steve pointed out, and a grin began to spread over Howard’s face as a camera clicked loudly. “Jim!” he laughed.
“Yes!” He replied eagerly, but then gestured to his wrists and ankles, which were tightly bound with rope.
“My suit just needs a jumpstart.” Tony said, his head hanging down as he clearly fought a yawn. “How delicate can you be with that thing?” He added to Thor, looking curiously at the lightning hammer.
In silence, they made their way through the cars, their bond thrumming comfortably between them which was always a comfort when they were working. The Hydra weapons always had an odd smell to them, and as soon as he noticed it, Steve turned to look at Bucky.
“Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine, but he gave you everything.” He looked Steve up and down, as though genuinely confused by him. “So, what made you so special?”
They moved over to the next empty strip of land, as Stark landed and Steve found himself pulling the other man into a tight hug before he had chance to think better.
“I’m trying not to taste it.” Bucky muttered quietly to him, smiling slightly despite the fact that he still had more than half a bowl left.
“Bucky, you can’t. You’re a sentinel with a guide, how did you get them to take you?” He asked in bitter confusion; sentinels were accepted if their guides joined with them and they would receive the same orders so they weren’t split up.
“Wait. Wait, hold on. How is this now about me?” The man glowered at Steve, clearly unhappy that the attention he was receiving wasn’t positive.
The Tesseract was information Tony already knew having taken the time to read all the files Coulson had left him with, as well as following up with checking out his father’s files on the thing. However, he focussed on the picture in front of him. “Natasha’s sentinel?”
“Aw, hell.” He muttered, using his enhanced strength to bend the metal railings back. He had to try something if Bucky was just going to stay there.
“Would if I could, JARVIS, but that’s not an option.” He headed out through the walk ways to a section of the ship which had a hole torn in the side, near to engine three. “Loki is using the cube to bring an alien army through to New York.”
He passed several SHIELD workers with oxygen masks on as he approached the engine, and helped push the door open to let some of them out, a wounded man between them.
“Steven? Can you hear me?” Steve stared blankly at the metal in front of him, unable to lift his gaze to the little window above him, but Erskine’s voice was still a comfort. As the words sunk in, Steve noticed the hesitance in his tone, likely because he was a good man… Just like Steve wanted to be. A good man, able to help save the people from the Axis Powers. To help people like Bucky and the soldiers, Peggy and the Allies in Europe, Erskine and the good people who were unable to escape Hitler… He wanted life to go on…
“Gabe, Jacques and Jim? You guys go left here. We’ll keep going.” He waited for them all to nod. “I hear voices, so be careful.”
” Natasha said as Tony used the forward momentum of one Chitauri flying craft to swing it around and crash it into another.
“In case you needed to kill me. But you can’t! I know. I tried.” There was a flash of pain, and Steve saw Tony and Natasha flinch as well as they felt it. “I got low. I didn’t see an end so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.” Steve had a brief flash to Dum Dum, staring at his gun when he’d accidently killed a civilian that had been in one of Schmidt’s bases; the older guy had asked in a blank voice if the war was ever gonna end, and they’d all refused to leave him alone until he’d been able to smile again. The thought that Bruce had been so alone… “So I moved on. I focussed on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk.” He reached behind himself to grab to sceptre, shifting it slowly off the table with his left hand.
The air rushing passed his face was far more terrifying than when he fell already inside the armour, and he didn’t relax until the bracelets beeped and the armour wrapped around him, safer than a mother’s embrace.
Steve led them through the corridors, carefully listening for anything that sounded out of place, but there were very few people around.
But later on, Steve was more interested in looking at the uniform his friend was decked out, Bucky’s finest outfit and therefore what he’d chosen to wear for their double date. It was hard to hide the bitter envy that bubbled up inside him from their bond, but he wanted to be supportive of the other man before he headed out into danger without a guide.
“I don’t care how we get it.” Cooper stated, breathing easily enough that Steve knew he’d dialled back his ability to smell too. “As long as no one tells Stanley that this is how we got in.”
“There’s a base about thirty miles over enemy lines. They have prisoners, including my best friend.” He explained, using their bond to get across how serious he was about this. “I just need dropping off close enough to get there.”
“Autopilot on, then. I’m gonna try rest before we get there.” Which was change he’d made from earlier suits, long distance travel got uncomfortable so he had padded the armour out in places where he pressed the most against it. It was still a suit of armour, so it wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he could at least get some sleep in it for now.
He looked up into the perplexed face of Howard Stark. “What?” He croaked, but coughed before he could get any other words out.
“That’s vile!” Steve gasped as he fought to keep it down. Years of forcing down disgusting food meant he was successful, but he had to dial his sense of taste right back.
Steve ran his fingers lightly down the suit’s arm, wondering how strong the metal was. “What do you mean?”
“But if you are happy to stay in Tony’s penthouse, you’ll have easy access to his workshop.” Happy called back, and Steve felt Tony’s amusement over their bond as they both looked over to him. “That way you can make him eat and sleep when he’s been working for seventy two hours straight.”
“I should be able to get most the stuff underwater without needing to be there personally. I can send Jay up with a suit of his own to bulk of it, but I’ll need to do the delicate stuff.”
“I just need one name: Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.” He stood his ground, needing this information.
in between times if I need to.” The whole computer thing had brought about a subsection of the English language that Steve wasn’t familiar with, it was a little daunting, but he was going to try and get on top of it.
Tony hadn’t had a chance to reply when something thumped onto the roof of their jet. As Steve moved to grab his shield, the engineer grabbed his helmet and slid it into place.
“Doesn’t it run off electricity?” The soldier asked as he ran a finger along the seams between the shoulder and the arm.
“And yet you aren’t denying his point.” Steve teased, starting to feel more comfortable as Happy grinned at him through the rear view mirror.
“Sometimes, there isn’t a way out, Tony.” Steve stepped over to him, his blue eyes wide on his sympathetic face.
“Yeah. Not sure where Thor’s putting Loki but…” Tony trailed off without finishing his thought, but Steve didn’t mind.
“That’s pretty young to be a captain.” Rhodey noted, but blatantly didn’t ask how he’d achieved the rank. “You like it?”
Howard shrugged, still smiling slightly. “That’s the rarest metal on Earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.”
“I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.” Tony stated as he wandered around the desk to join Steve.
“Whatever. Come on, buddy. I’m not really one for singing and dancing in the rain, so let’s move.”  Tony said in as calm a tone as he could manage, not wanting to leave Captain Rogers with Fury and SHIELD when he still hadn’t managed to speak a single word; didn’t really matter who this kid was, apparently he was now Tony’s bond-mate so he was going to make sure the kid was alright.
Steve understood what he meant. People normally had a test at about eleven or twelve to see if they were a guide or sentinel and it was real rare for these abilities to develop later than fourteen or fifteen; Steve had developed his guide senses at the age of eight, in response to Bucky’s sentinel abilities, but he never did get tested. He’d been too sick to go to school when they visited his class when he was eleven.
“People have been to the moon?” Steve’s jaw dropped at the idea, and he honestly wanted to hear more about that than some fancy new armour.
Tony simply handed the clothing over. “I met you today. I’m not lending you boxers. You can put your other stuff on when you get up. Should be dry by then.”
They had trekked for days through Nazi Germany, then they had taken a small outpost with vehicles. Dum Dum had taught him how to start a car without the key, and Jacques had taught him how to drive; overall, Steve had really enjoyed this particular trip. They’d driven the two vehicles they’d taken for nearly two more days before dumping them and trekking quietly the rest of the way.
The end of the session was general chit-chat, not his strongest suit but it was relaxing nonetheless.
Expanding the scan of his helmet, Tony searched for the best way to remove the wiring without having to restart from scratch. “What happened?”
“What do you mean? All this came from you,” She was the one who had pushed him to focus, refusing to let him drink and wallow in response to Steve’s silence. She had supported his move to tech development as Stark Industries began making phones and tablets instead of weapons, she argued his case to the board when their stock had taken a dive, she’d spoken to the different government agencies (including SHIELD) to get them to buy his secure communication systems instead of his bombs and she had encouraged him when he’d started thinking about clean energy.
“I can’t stay.”  Coulson was considerate enough to inform them straight away, making Tony wonder if he’d been cornered by Pepper before and found himself unable to escape.
But it was nearly an hour later, while he was talking to Officer Harrison that Tony contacted him to say they were going for shawarma. He checked that everyone knew what they were doing before heading out, leaning heavily against the side of the elevator for the short ride.
Ignoring the words that occasionally came through his earpiece, Steve kept an eye on the doorway. However, he couldn’t ignore it when he realised that he couldn’t hear one of the engines. He slammed into the side as the ship lurched, but quickly got his feet back under him as more soldiers appeared. He was going to have to take them out; it was unfortunate, but he wasn’t going to let Tony die because he’d been unwilling to fight back.
"It's not Osborn causing this," Reed says, finally lifting up from his data, holding out the evidence for Steve too see for himself, as though he'd be able to make any sense of it. "It's Tony."
Steve's decided to answer demonstratively, seeing as it worked so well the first time, and he's developed a taste for it in the short time he had it, but Tony dodges his attempted kiss, turning to the side, expression tense.
"Not the curse," Reyes says. "Don't you think it's a little odd that Osborn just vanished? Without a trace? No backup plans?"
"It's not about what I want," Tony says.  But he's weakening, it's obvious how much wants it, and Steve wonders how long it was there for the taking. If it was always this obvious.  It sounds like surrender when he asks, "What, exactly, did we do?"
"Good morning," he says, and sets the plate of warm meat and pasta on the coffee table. Panic is diverted briefly; Tony's eyes fix on the sight. His mouth works once, before Steve nods. "Go ahead."
But Sin is smart enough to stack the deck before starting any game. Not only has she taken the high ground, she's surrounded herself with suicidal lackeys, literally jumping on Steve as he climbs, forcing him to cause real damage before letting go: cracking ribs, snapping fingers, howls of pain. It's slow-going. It's, quite honestly, a pathetic display.
Steve isn't with the New Avengers, but it is nice to hear from Linda that he's apparently safe for the time being.
But the people he cared about the most were palpably distant from him. All barely holding up under the weight of their own baggage, he couldn't dump more on them.
"The point was a system Osborn isn't familiar with. It's new. It's not the best thing I've ever made, but Reed doesn't often see something new. He likes new."
Off the grid, he goes where he feels he's needed, and him taking an interest in this, in Tony, isn't exactly promising, but Steve can't help but be grateful for his presence
The last Steve had heard on that was a horrific miscarriage, some complication that meant she'd never be able to have children. He's probably a little underdressed for the coffee shop in his jogging sweats and t-shirt, but no one looks twice when he takes the seat opposite Bucky. "You know you can call me, right?"
"Why did you come here?" Blunt. But Steve is beginning to suspect his earlier assumption was wrong, and it's hard to be happy, or patient, or friendly about it.
"No, it's –" eerily similar. And as it hits him, Steve realizes they're lucky Tony hadn't actually snapped, that it's an artificially-powered break down; it's not as though they hadn't been aware of what was happening. It's a wonder, Steve realizes, he hadn't started drinking. "We'll worry about that later."
"Stark's status?" He plucks up his shield from where it's wedged in an otherwise lovely flowerbed, gripping the edge tightly. 'Alive' covers a lot of ground.
"Perhaps you should list them, and we shall soundly beat upon you for each one," Volstagg suggests merrily. "By your scheduling, you are a busy man after all."
"Come in," he says. Steve is very careful with his tone when Reyes reaches his living room, because the last time he spoke too sharply, he flinched every time Steve so much as sneezed for a week. "It's past midnight," he says, flatly.
Steve's pretty sure he's right when Tony's eyes widen, mouth actually dropping.  "Steve," he breathes, reaching out and touching the portrait tentatively.  "This is--"
"A headache, but he's fine," Sue says, then gives Tony's back a narrow sort of look. He's leaning rather heavily on the ledge of the building; it could easily be exaggerated nonchalance, or exhaustion, but she clearly isn't fooled. "He's not–"
Steve opens his mouth, but it's lost in the immediate flood of rebuttals, and he's pleased to hear more than one expressing the same sentiment as Cassie's rather eloquent, "Bite me, Iron Man's a hero."
"I woke you up," Tony says, apparently still asleep enough to state the obvious. A moment of silence, and then Tony runs a hand through his hair, rubbing the back of his neck. "I should've said this earlier. But I missed – talking to you. I didn't want to ruin that. I'm sorry you died."
It snaps something in him, pulls the whole situation out of surreal; Tony could've died. He didn't, he's standing in front of Steve now, looking more awkward in Steve's shirt than he did naked.
"Obviously. That's, what, seven residences you've lost in the past year?" Steve says. Then, the only argument he can think of that Tony won't try to shoot down; "I have a right to be in on this. You came to my door."
They exit the buffet, and Volstagg manages to squeeze through the door by the time Tony finishes negotiating the bill.
They look so collectively disheartened, and Steve probably shouldn't be surprised that it bothers them, too, but it does.  This feels like something that only he and handful of others should be upset about.  Similar to what he felt when walking down the streets of his old neighborhood, the streets and homes he remembered torn down and rebuilt, or some cases simply gone.
"It's just started," Maya finally answers, the signal weak enough that her face flickers, voice thick with static.
Maria Stark was a gorgeous woman.  Willowy, with ridiculously high cheekbones and the same piercing eyes as her son. Steve's pretty sure Tony takes more after her than his father, actually, the coloring and build are certainly similar.
This is supposed to be a group activity, the Avengers Sponsored charity event! But Iron Man has some personal business, Hank's a no show, and Jan and Tony Stark are slowly meandering through the sizeable furniture section, Steve lost them almost immediately in the rows and rows of dulled woods and metal. Most of the pieces are dusty and gaudy, and Steve can see no rhyme or reason between the ones that the people gather around, murmuring, and the ones that are sneered at.
A truly aggravating aspect of fighting Sin that they should've seen coming. Steve should've been there for the planning of this – the daughter of the Red Skull, pin-up of every white supremacist – she's got literal hordes of willing bodies to hurl at them, to be handed weaponry entirely too advanced, given no training, and tossed in front of highly skilled SHIELD agents. It works for a while, too. Throw enough spaghetti at a wall, you'll make a mess but some of it is bound to stick.
"Starving," Tony says, but is focusing on his device once again, mouth tight. Probably has more to say, but isn't going to force the issue.
"Just pubescent.  And of course not, it's technically yours," Tony says.  Then looks Steve up and down.  Then laughs again, a real laugh, ending in a real smile. Steve is immensely pleased with himself for going through with this.
"I should hope this battle of brothers you were willing to go to such depths, such depravity, to win, was worth it."
Tony's smile fades, staring intently at the piece, twisting the screwdriver. "I take it she's not on active missions?"
As they talk, Tony seems to simultaneously loosen and tighten. Forget their surroundings enough to slide back on the couch, but cross his arms in defense, then bring up his legs as added protection.
"Every day, it hurt. Even when you came back, it still . . . " his deep inhalation is wet and shaking. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Barely anyone contacts him on anything other than his SHIELD communicator, or various Avenger communicators, it takes him a second to place the sudden, tinny song – he fumbles with the cell phone in his pouch. "One second," he says, strangling on the words; Sharon's number is on the ID bar.
"Most viewers are probably well aware of the super human activities of Thursday and Friday! Citizens experienced quite a bit of frustration when a man calling himself 'The Tweaker' began intercepting cell phones and local television channels, announcing his intentions of taking control of New York, and expressing interest in the rest of the United States as well. No one has come forward to take credit for dispatching this nuisance, but we at KCTY thank you, as does the rest of the state, we're sure!"
"Lion of Asgard, to men with good sense and pedigree," huffs Volstagg, and if Steve's not mistaken, a little bruised by the teasing.
"How?" Steve asks, growing tense. Granted, luck didn't seem to be on his side today, but they just walked through the door. Not even the gossip chain from the neighborhood Steve grew up in could've spread the news that fast.
"Oh God," Tony chokes, sounding breathless, one arm reaching out, looking for something to brace against, finding nothing.  His head is tipped back, eyes glazed over.  "Oh God, Steve," and that just fuels him, he's thrusting in and
"The LDDT targets and breaks down non-organisms only. Any potted plants you had would've been fine, too. The worst that could happen was a three story drop. And . . . seeing the Punisher's genitals."
"Was this not," Thor demands, voice rumbling, echoing, bringing its rage along with it, filling the room, and Steve can't blame Tony for stiffening at his side, "discussed to your satisfaction, Hogun? Fandral? Volstagg? The penance of Tony Stark is mine to collect, alone."
"Where do you need us?" Patriot asks, the transport spell's smoke fading slowly around him and his team, they glance around the wrecked city. Steve exchanges a look with Sam; he's not going to send them to Rykers, and everywhere else . . .
"I wouldn't say so," Linda says. "Iron Man's never been stopped by this level of personal destruction before."
Steve stared into his sentinel’s eyes for a long moment, trying to find his voice again; to explain that they’d been a team since he’d first laughed at Bucky slipping in the mud near Dyker Heights Park then called a truce on their play fight in favour of getting back before dark so his Ma didn’t smack his backside for breaking the rules again. He wanted to explain that he wasn’t sure how their bond would do, that they’d never actually been so far away from each other and the very idea was making his stomach churn.
He was definitely starting to get annoyed again, for reasons he almost couldn’t explain. “Yet you’re confused about why they don’t want you around.” While Steve didn’t really mind his actions, his flippant attitude left a lot to be desired.
As Erskine prompted Peggy Carter to go somewhere else, Steve focussed on not panicking. Getting strapped down made that kind of difficult.
“Are we done here?” Steve asked, his eyes on Thor as he edged towards Tony, as though planning to protect him despite the fact that Tony was in a suit of armour while Steve wore a tight suit (not that it didn’t highlight certain features well enough, but Tony didn’t exactly consider SHIELD’s resources to be top-of-the-range, especially not when it came to protecting the people Tony wanted to keep safe).
“Yes. There are different theories about what he is upset by. Some assume the red in the background is a volcano and his fear is a very simple type. Others say that it was painted in a location near to where his sister was housed in a lunatic asylum and this is almost a self-portrait of his own struggle. Many people claim it shows the anxiety of modern man.”
“No hard feelings, Point Break. You’ve got a mean swing.” Tony assured Thor casually as he wandered passed him. “Also, it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants.” He stopped by the glass screens and looked around. “Raise the mizzenmast, jib the topsails.” Tony spoke up although Steve honestly couldn’t see this future-focussed man on a sailing boat that had been old-fashioned back in his day.
And with that thought, he moved; he didn’t like the idea that Pepper was talking to SHIELD agents without him. “His first name is ‘Agent’.”
As he fired off another volley of small rockets back at the beast, Tony grinned. Bruce must have turned up.
“JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours, I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD as ever tried to hide.” The guide slid his glass screen into his pocket and held out his bag to his sentinel. “Blueberry?”
Steve shook his head. “No. You remember what his other base was like? There were cameras and it was rigged to explode. He’s a paranoid guy who looks out for himself.”
Lifting his head as he wiped at his eyes, Steve gave the man a small smile. “Why? Need help with something?”
“So, you want to stay in the room you had last time? Or do you want somewhere else?” Tony asked as they pulled up outside the little window, joining the queue of cars to wait to talk to the young woman waiting there. “Steve?”
“A few times, when I wanted to get away from my mom and dad. Not for too long though.” Howard’s eyes were a little haunted as he lifted them to meet Steve’s gaze. “I’d rather fight with them than spend too much time on my own out here.” Loneliness flooded their bond, apparently echoing into Steve and Bucky’s bond as the two New Yorkers came up either side of him.
When he got outside, Tony and Happy were waiting for him in the car park, his guide wearing a pair of sunglasses as he leaned against the hood of his car. “All done?” The man called out as Steve approached him.
Tony stepped back, his stomach churning. “For taking on Loki alone.” He shouldn’t have had to. Tony was the so-called super hero, and he’d been unable to confront the guy. Steve had insisted that Loki had come too easily, and the guy had surrendered without a fuss; they should have realised that something was up!
“No idea.” Steve replied, not even half his attention on the conversation as he checked their route. “All five senses though.”
“I don’t remember you being this strong.” The older sentinel wondered as Steve held his arms, letting him get his feet under him.
“Yeah, but only since that experiment.” He shrugged. “Doctor Erskine said something about the serum making the perfect person, so I guess having my senses all increased is a part of it.”
‘I know. It’s been hard to manage more than a light meditation. I couldn’t get far enough in to see you.’
While Bucky had been right to say his health would improve with regular meals and exercise, he probably hadn’t anticipated the basic training camp. This particular camp had combined the Basic and Individual Training, the Small Unit Training and the Combined Arms Training into one condensed unit; four long months of very hard work and everybody was exhausted.
“Hey? Listen to me. Listen.” It was only years of practise that let Tony’s voice take on a commanding tone when he was this uncertain. “You need to count for me, okay? Look around and count three things you can see.”
“Come here often?” Why did anyone need such big doors? They had to be twelve foot high! No one was that tall.
It was just white now, the cold air rushing up to meet his face. “You know, I still don’t know how to dance.”
“Well then, understand it somewhere else.” Philips stepped past him. “If I read the posters correctly you get have to take your Captain to sing and dance somewhere else real soon.”
“Steve Rogers.” He replied, unsure if he was allowed to ask what the Strategic Scientific Reserve was, or if there was anything else he was supposed to say. “Where are you from?” He asked, wondering if the man would tell him.
Once suited up, he took off, flying through the sky as he let JARVIS navigate his way to Germany, apparently. He knew he was more than six hours late, but he wondered what he had missed and why the helicarrier had a course set for Stuttgart.
It was, Tony reflected as he was flung through the air by the hammer, probably a mistake to antagonise someone who viewed themselves as a god, but sometimes he just couldn’t help himself. Besides, when a guy called himself the god of thunder with a straight face, he felt obligated to try and take him down a few notches, even if he was capable of throwing lightning around.
In his ear piece, Agent Hill was giving updates. Apparently, the explosion had taken out one of the engines.
“Yeah, remember Debbie and Connie? Thought we could go see that show.” A wide grin spread over Bucky’s handsome face as he handed over a newspaper; ‘World Exposition of Tomorrow’ it announced in bold letters over a picture of a metal globe.  “That Stark guy is showing off his new tech again.”
“Like Christmas, but with more… me.” Was he smug? Yes he was, and rightly so. He’d trampled over the board’s objections to completely switching over their power source and it had worked. He could build an arc reactor in his sleep, knew how to handle any quirks and knew the shortcuts that could be taken in case of emergencies… but he didn’t exactly advertise to people what exactly the shining disc on his chest was, so he couldn’t explain why he knew all this without revealing an enormous vulnerability to the world.
“Nah. Said my bit for the camera and left it to the police.” Which was enough. He wasn’t sure what else Fury had wanted him to do, but he hadn’t been in contact so Steve assumed that he had done enough. The only thing the Director had wanted to say was that he had an appointment with a therapist to talk about everything that had happened; Steve wasn’t entirely sure why he needed to talk to someone, but if he had to go then he would at least turn up and say something to this person.
“Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen.” Peggy pointed out, and Steve realised that she couldn’t read anything that Steve could along their bond. She wasn’t even a guide and so couldn’t get an easy read on the atmosphere. “He’s mad enough to brave this air space. We’re lucky to have him.”
“I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious. Phil’s pretty shaken.” Tony could have questioned that because Phil seemed unbothered by anything, but he’d never been the kind of guide who was fully in tune with the emotions of others; he’d have to trust Pepper with her interpretation of his body language.
Steve nodded. “Yeah.” Hodge was the man that Agent Carter had only had to punch once to leave Steve half smitten with her.
“It is 7:36 in the evening.” There was a pause before Mr Jarvis spoke again. “Mr Stark is in his workshop but will be heading up to the kitchen momentarily. If you head out this room and then straight down the corridor, you will reach the kitchen. You may help yourself to any food and drink that you wish.”
Tony poured out a second cup of coffee and handed it over. “Here.” He nodded Steve’s thanks away as he considered the question. “I wouldn’t say it was exactly the same. Dad mainly built weapons and the other stuff were just things he found interesting. But we don’t make weapons anymore.”
“How can I help, Captain?” The man seemed to be the vigilant sort as he replied promptly, but Steve couldn’t muster a smile at the idea yet. He honestly felt bizarrely tired in a way he hadn’t since going to war.
“The only Mr Stark I knew of was your grandfather and I regret not having the chance to meet him.” Steve grumbled softly before catching sight of Tony’s said eyebrow. “I don’t like bullies; I don’t care who they are, or how old they are.”
“Then you’ve gotta let me go.” He went to climb into the vehicle, but she reached over to touch his hand.
It was only when he allowed his thoughts to drift to Peggy that he noticed the tears dripping down his cheeks. It wasn’t fair! Peggy had been so beautiful, so perfect; she’d had a wonderful sense of humour and her smile, her firm conviction, her willingness to say what needed saying. He even missed how unintimidated by him, post-serum, she had been. But no, he bet she had gone off and lived a wonderful life with some other fella!
“This isn’t payback, is it?” Bucky had never enjoyed throwing himself off heights in the same way that Steve now did. But Steve really, really did enjoy it… and sliding down a cable from the side of a mountain onto a moving train was going to be good.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Like forty years ago. Trust me, it’s old news now. My suits, however, haven’t been around for five years yet.” Tony had a hand in the air as he spoke, apparently unable to keep it in one place. Steve had a feeling that he wasn’t a stand-still-to-get-your-point-across sort of fella.
“Can you do that at college?” Steve wasn’t really sure how the college rooming system worked, but if he had to guess, he would have assumed it was like the barracks where you had to deal with where you were put.
“We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.” Stark called back, most of his attention on flying the plane.
“Jay, call Fury.” He ran a hand through his hair, tightening his fingers on the strands as Fury answered.
Peggy paused for a moment as though she wasn’t sure what to tell him, but she explained anyway. “Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him, and less than fifty returned. Captain Cooper’s audience contained what was left of the 107th, the rest were killed or captured.”
Black Widow was giving him a half smile from across the table as she stood up. “You have an idea of what we need to do then?” She asked as he got to his feet.
“An argument can be made for fifteen.” He pointed out, grinning as he took a drink of his coffee and savoured the taste.
“How about that?” He murmured, feeling smug. Was there anything more satisfying than knowing he’d beaten this potential problem before he’d even known about Thor?
Too exhausted to move against, his eyes dipped shut at the icy water began to flood in through the broken windows. Thoughts of Peggy and Howard finding someone to dance with some comfort when he knew he wasn’t going to see them again.
“You know what you should have asked?” His voice was stating to slur, and Steve knew his friend was going to be asleep on his shoulder soon.
Loki didn’t seem quite as friendly as his brother, but Tony had only read about Thor so he couldn’t say for certain. “Awesome. Patch me through to their jet then play a little AC/DC for them.”
“Yes. Captain then. Captain Rogers, you are to report here at 0900 tomorrow morning, where you will be taken to a separate facility. There you will receive testing to see the extent of your sentinel abilities.”
“Urgh, really? The D-word?” He moaned as he landed. “I don’t allow that kind of language in my tower. I demand you incinerate it.”
“I do!” Steve jumped in, happy that there was something in this conversation he fully understood. He’d seen the Wizard of Oz twice at the movie theatre, more than happy to pay his twenty five cents both times to lose himself in another world for the length of the film. For a moment, the strongest emotion in the room to Steve was Tony’s fond exasperation as the young sentinel glanced back at his guide. “I understood that reference.” It was the first time that had happened in this new world.
“That’s disappointing.” He muttered, feeling more than a little frustrated. “Guess we’re heading back to England for a while, unless we get a runner with new orders before then.”
“How’d your search and rescue going?” Tony asked as he headed over to Steve’s side. “Did you get in contact with anyone about it?”
“Mr Stark.” Peggy greeted him, but Steve still wasn’t ready to let go. It had been months since he’d last seen his guide.
“No matter what lies Erskine told you. You see, I was his greatest success!” Schmidt snarled, but then he moved his fingers to his neck and peeled off his face.
He used the increased power to give his repulsors a bit of extra juice before flying straight at the alien, gripping the edges of his armour to drag him up into the air and into the cliff face, trying to injure him against it.
“I’ll head down in a bit. JARVIS said he’s busy with something important right now.” Rhodey looked him up and down again. “I’d rather learn a bit about you.”
“Yeah. I’ve got some clothes for you too.” Tony replied as though it was no big deal, and Steve had to remind himself that that was the case. He and Bucky may have struggled to get enough money to eat three meals a day, pay rent and buy other bits and pieces, but Tony was like Howard; enough money that he didn’t need to worry and enough generosity to share with his friends.
“We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn but we are ready as we’ll ever be.” It was unnerving having a stranger look him up and down like that, especially when it wasn’t a doctor; but Stark’s eyes quickly moved onto the actual machine, as though double checking everything was where it should be.
The man didn’t even glance up as he replied. “Rogers, you are going to be here until we figure out how to make more super-soldiers. As a test subject, you were an acceptable candidate, but we need a troop of capable soldiers. That means, we need you here.”
“Steve!” Peggy followed him, but she didn’t say anything else as he threw stuff into one of the cars. He had never driven before, but Holmes had mentioned the very basics to him when Cooper and the girls had been on stage leaving Steve and the other soldiers waiting around.
“Whatever. Ms Potts? Got a second?” He tapped into one of the folder’s labelled ‘Banner’ and noticed a large collection of reports, photos, video clips and other documents. “You know, I thought we were having a moment.”
In his sleep, he would dream of the water, the ice, the wail of air raid sirens as bombs fell, the heat of explosions, the bodies of fallen men, the blood caught in cobblestones his skin peeling off to reveal a red skull of his own … then he hit a stage where he was unable to sleep when he lay down; the warm, dark room that should have been cosy left him twitching as his senses overcompensated and he found himself noticing the hum of Tony’s building wide computers, the chatter of people outside Tony’s living floors, the smell of the washing detergent as he buried his face in the bedding, the tiny motes of dust that were barely visible in the day that floated through the air, the encompassing darkness through which he could almost hear gunfire…
“Yeah. It’s seen a bit of mileage and you’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?” He headed down to the bar as casually as he could. Thank fuck Steve had left so soon; if he hadn’t fallen into his work like he had, then it was possible these wouldn’t be finished yet… not that they really were, as JARVIS had reminded him; this suit was incomplete and still had issues with communications.
Steve looked down at the uniform SHIELD must have provided. It was closer to royal blue of Captain America than the darker shades of his old uniform, and from the wince, Tony wasn’t entirely sure he liked it. “Yeah. They said they made it for me.” But he tightened his grip on his shield, which was still his vibranium circle with muted colours, and held it in front of his torso.
“Why shouldn’t the guy let off a little steam?” Tony’s anger was cooling too, but Steve’s was still amplified by everyone else’s.
Still, humanity did have one trump card. “The Avengers.” Loki turned around to give him a puzzled look. Maybe Barton hadn’t gotten round to explaining this bit to him, that they had a team name and everything. “It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing.”
He forced himself to breathe as he realised that he’d finally done it. He’d joined the army. He’d be able to do something useful.
He accepted it with a small smile. “Captain, huh? Army?” Steve nodded. “I’m Colonel James Rhodes, but just call me Rhodey.”
“My people wanted nothing but peace with your planet.” Thor stated, his arms falling to his side as he began to shift in tiny movements that Steve could only detect so easily with his sentinel senses, no doubt preparing in case he needed to move, to fight…
“It’s been shut up since the whole war thing, but my family has property out here in Italy. I figured if you are out here anyway, once you’re off the train then it’s not far to go.”
He whimpered, unable to focus on anything as his suit powered down, finally failing out in the middle of nowhere, while he was helpless; in too much pain to think.
“Sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.” Tony murmured, and Steve grinned briefly as the man showed he was thinking about their problem. He certainly felt like he had a plan of some kind. “The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density. Something to kick-start the cube.”
The pain that had been bubbling just below the surface, contained by the strength of his surprising new bond and strange detachment that he couldn’t seem to shake. “Oh.” He croaked out, recalling something about Howard dying. “He… He died, yes?” But Steve knew without hearing the answer; the pain weighing him down wasn’t something the serum could heal because it came from a broken bond.
“Is everything a joke to you?” He asked in frustration, as he began to realise that his guide treated an awful lot of stuff in a less than serious manner.
“What? Did you stop for drive-through?” He asked, but the spare chunk of his attention had gone to the flood of Steve’s feelings he could feel along their bond now that the super soldier was in close enough range for their young bon to share. “Swing up Park. I’m gonna lay ‘em out for you.”
“Doctor Erskine said that the serum wouldn’t just affect my muscles, it would affect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means I can’t get drunk.” He told her, before she could even say anything; it seemed important to explain the main problem first. “Did you know that?”
“Hello.” He said gently, lowering his gun as he went to crouch before the boy. “I’m Steve.” He pointed to himself, and tried to put a smile on his face.
Steve smelt his guide before he heard him, but the man answered Bruce as he entered the room. “It’s a stabilising agent.” Tony finished his conversation with Coulson as they both approached the table. “It means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD.”
That had better not be Butterfingers out of his charging station; last time he’d gone exploring without Tony around, he’d crashed into his desk and actually managed to put his claw through one of the screens. Tony had chosen to reduce the amount of hardware by getting rid of several monitors and adding in his hologrammatic screens after scolding the bot; it was usually his brother, Dum-E, that caused the problems, but the other two were in Malibu. Butterfingers was here for some repair work, and then had stayed as Tony was currently spending more time over here.
The pilot on the outside didn’t last long, and without someone to fight, Steve managed to open up the cockpit and eject the other pilot without trouble. Jumping into the cockpit himself, Steve wasn’t any kind of a good pilot and he didn’t exactly land in the hanger bay with elegance, but nothing exploded so he simply got out, retrieved his shield and hurried on.
“Right now, I’m the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer, a lot of people are going to die.” It was terrifying, but there really was no other option. “Peggy, this is my choice.” He’d die before he willingly killed someone innocent, and he couldn't let go; Schmidt had done something and the Valkyrie leveled out every time he let go of the yoke. He needed to keep it pushed forwards to keep the nose down.
Steve watched as the gaudy suit of armour flew to the smoking metal. He could feel his guide’s mind working, but he had no idea what exactly the man was looking at, never mind what he was thinking about.
The older boy prodded him in the forehead with a long finger. “That’s because you never get caught.”
Seven, Eight, Nine… The nurse was moving bits on the machine to come rest on his chest… Eleven, Twelve…
He backed up, staring through the rising smoke and fire at his friend… Could he jump that distance? He still wasn’t all that heavy; surely with how strong he was, he could get across. Sending up a quick, heartfelt prayer, he ran and then he jumped, his eyes locked onto his friend and he flew through the air and slammed into the wall on the other side.
Refusing to give up, Steve pushed him hard, stumbling backwards to the floor as Schmidt landed on the controls in front of the pilot’s chair. As the ship began to plummet, Steve tried to get the better of Schmidt, punching whenever he tumbled close enough, but maybe it was good Schmidt got to the controls because he managed to level the plane out.
Stark must have felt him shrink down because he nudged him with his shoulder. “Give it time. They’d be mad to leave a super soldier in a lab.”
“No. You spent more than half a century napping in the ice!” Stark was leaning over him, but Steve stood his ground.
Tony chuckled as they entered the elevator and the door slid shut. “That’s actually pretty close. You can’t shift gears, or easily reach the handbrake, but you can tug the car to one side or the other. I am working on it though, so that if I need extra backup in a fight, I can call on him to control my spare suits. It’s a pretty complex programme to try writing though.”
“He was doing his job.” Huh, that was weird; Tony could feel Steve trying to send comfort along their bond, but it just frustrated him more.
Tony nodded. “It runs off my arc reactor.” He tapped the disc on his chest. “And yeah, but you can’t just shoot electricity at something and expect it to absorb it.”
“Budge up. Let me watch.” Howard dropped down next to Bucky, but he managed to keep his face blank too as he looked at his friend’s hand.
“They’re basically full body suits of armour. I don’t mean like knights in old stories, but like deep sea divers who go into the water, or the astronauts who went to the moon. It covers everything and can be made airtight.”
"You don't suspect the estate that bought it?" Steve asks. "Your father had that world war three relic buried down there for who knows how long, we had no idea, they could know something we don't."
"I kept you away because I murdered Happy, and something used my head to kill Jarvis, and I'm not making the same mistake a third time."
Tony braces for impact, and Steve can make out his eyes closing tight from his position on the sidelines. He should've gotten him a mouth guard.
He does have that training and experience, though, and it's telling him that they hit something beneath them, scraped against a building, but the projected skyline in the dashboard confirms he's well clear of the city below.
Iron Man's arm around his waist, they lift off the front lawn of the mansion.  It's unfinished and rough around the edges, but the foundation is there, the frame is solid, it's only a matter of time. For the first time in months, Steve finds himself looking forward to tomorrow.
"No, no," he says, immediately, straightening, as if proper posture will be enough to trick Steve into believing he's fine. "It'll wear off. Did you save the Sodomizer?"
Of course there's nothing to be worried about.  Tony doesn't laugh, doesn't so much as smile.  He seems almost touched, standing slightly straighter. "Your mother was a wise woman," he says.
Just a few hours ago, Steve probably would've taken that. Instead, he settles against the wall. "I've got nowhere else to be. What does this do, exactly? You've been a little– " not vague. Vague, Steve could've followed. "Too specific."
"Asgard!" Volstagg says emotionally, obviously bothered by the memory. "Of course your science creation is too weak to cause true damage against the home of gods, but some of our most favorite possessions became one with the air right before our eyes!"
"Destroying someone's apartment is rude," Sam says. "You realize you're sleeping on the couch and I'm getting your bed, right?"
The agent turns, blasts a round into a flying car barreling in their direction; it drifts to the side, skidding into a building, into the street, ripping to pieces and starting several fires.
And a few minutes later, that's exactly what he's doing. Breathing hard and heavy, passed out on the floor.
"It really needs a new name," Steve says, handing the device over, and Tony grabs it with both hands in obvious relief.
Tony doesn't resist but is unhelpfully limp, stumbling along at his side, and they're entirely too close for Steve's liking when the building explodes, hot and jagged against his back.
"Mister Fantastic just updated the Helicarrier's systems," Steve says. Not that it's impossible to render one of Reed's inventions obsolete, but it usually takes longer than a week. And stowaways from an attempted hostile takeover wouldn't really have the tech required. He says as much to Reyes, who wilts in a way that could be comical, if it weren't for the hour.
And yes, Steve can easily see Tony sacrificing his relationship with Pepper if he's somehow convinced himself it's his only option.
Whatever hit Steve's home obviously destroyed fabrics and concrete indiscriminately. Tony's composed as you would expect, sitting discreetly as possible, and Steve approaches; gaze steady on Tony's face.
It's a very easy thing to get overwhelmed in a situation like this; every direction Steve looks reveals a new emergency to be taken care of. There are streets of people that still need that final push to start evacuating, potential injuries, he knows looting has already started, and there are prisons getting swallowed whole by convicts who have realized the power's out.
"Fourteen by my count. And not quite. Apparently, magic of that degree leaves traces. Strange was investigating it, and could tell it had – he called it Life and Death magic?" Steve slams a Hill into the wall with his shield, and it sizzles, falling, effectively decapitated. "Given the time frame, Strange assumed my life was the one traded. He contacted Bucky, who was able to track down Mephisto and break the contract he made with Peter. But when I didn't come back – Mephisto offered him another deal," Steve disarms a Hill with a kick, than grabs it by the arm, whirling it into a second wave of Hills. "In exchange for everything that the Cosmic Cube gave him and those he knows. His sanity. Sam's . . . sanity. Sharon's . . . I'm not even sure, she won't tell me. And I woke up in the middle of the Arctic."
"It's really awesome armor," Tony assures them. "Which is out of commission at the moment, so if you're looking for a fight, it's going to be short."
"Don't worry about it," Tony says, settling against Steve's chest completely.  "They're used to it."
"What were you supposed to do?" Steve asks. "I'll debate you on your insanity during the fight, on hunting me down to begin with," and would, but just now feels like a rather inappropriate time. "But I'm not going to forgive you for something you could've had no way of knowing–"
Their first kiss was better.  Tony parted under him like he was receiving a gift, lingering, this time it's tense and aggressive, like he's proving a point.  It's over quickly and Steve feels like he was just sampled; like Tony had taken a quick bite for taste.
Tony doesn't respond. Instead, to his horror, Tony lets out a moan, deep and satisfied and shuddering, and suddenly Steve is miles away, somewhere warm and private, drawing more of those noises out of Tony's throat.
Steve clamps down hard on any warm feeling that resuscitates. He thinks of it in distant, clinical terms; yes, Tony is a teammate, he would always be welcome at Steve's home. And fair's fair, really, Tony opened his home without question more than once for Steve.
He'd obviously been willing, but Tony has a new attachment to go along with each escapade. But – Steve wouldn't just be one of the many. He said as much. Steve relaxes slightly when he recalls that, replays it in his mind, clings to it.
"Is there anything I should be keeping an eye out for?" Steve asks, after a moment of watching Tony's fingers work at rapid pace.
"Perhaps," says one, suddenly perking, "he's a human that has the strength of a god by birth, or takes flight, or changes shape!"
Steve takes turns staring uselessly at the handheld's screen, and Tony's still open, glazed eyes, and it does about as much good as you'd expect.
Thor nods. "Where shall I dispose of it? I believe it contains lethal parts that make it unsuitable for pedestrian removal."
Nothing, actually, is what remains of Steve's home, Punisher didn't exaggerate. It was hit. Where it should be – where it had every right to be, and had shown no displeasure of being previously – is now a wide, open space. Indented where the foundation used to sit, one of his emergency exits now a tunnel that vanishes under the street.
"Were you able to fix that device? Did you get anything off it?" Steve asks. "I'd really appreciate that location." He'd really like to know which direction to punch.
"Guess who finally decided to show up? After you went all the way to Brooklyn to give him a wake up call and everything." It takes Steve a moment to realize she's speaking into an ear piece – something that comes through the other end makes her smile even wider.
"And then you found me," Steve says. Maybe it wouldn't be rubbing him wrong if it wasn't supposed to be a replacement for Sharon's efficiency. Maybe it'd actually be amusing. "Why didn't you just call?"
"He didn't lie. He said it was out of commission, and it was," Steve says. "It's reactivated, and malfunctioned. It's using Tony. It's been steadily increasing the attacks on him, and–"
Tony's eyes widen; Steve's not usually that easy, but he's being given a ridiculous amount of motivation.  Still, he swallows it all, breathing rapidly through his nose.
"You realize Extremis was originally a military funded operation?" Maya says somewhat hotly, hands on her hips, tipping her head up to continue their conversation.
It's ridiculous, how hard Tony gets him, and how fast. Leaning over the man, resting his weight in a fist beside his head, Steve stretches him.  Watches his expressions, from tense with discomfort, to pleasure, to desperation.
"Getting slowly tortured by the computer in your brain might have had something to do with it," Steve points out, unable to stop moving down the hall, touching a door, opening another. The library, the study. Unfurnished, and there's still the smell of freshly cut wood. The walls are unpainted, and there are still foot prints of construction workers scattered across the floor. But . . . it's home.
That's really not fair of him at all, and Tony has yet to say anything when Steve's damn communicator buzzes, effectively reminding the both of them that there's a reality beyond the three feet of the space they currently occupy.
He could shake him off easily, just by standing. Tony wouldn't be able to hang on. They really should be moving. The Hulk could decide he wants them now that the flying car is gone. Tony could be wrong about the block he put out, they could get evaporated by a blast they'd never see coming. And Tony's not in his right mind, either, he probably wouldn't appreciate Steve taking advantage like this, listening to - to whatever this breakdown is.
It's the Avengers Mansion, down to the last shiny, copper knob.  "Anyway, I was thinking," he says. "Now that Tony's brain went insane and blew your houses up, maybe you guys would want it."
Steve walks past it twice in his half hearted attempt to find his two teammates, he's not sure what made him actually stop, take it in, but he does; freezes to a dead stop.
Steve's not entirely sure what that entails, just that it's something he apparently has to do on his own, and – selfishly – is taking much longer than Steve would prefer.
As much as he trusts Reed's intelligence, Steve doesn't believe it for a second. "If it's not Osborn, it's someone else using him. Tony wouldn't–"
"Why the formality?" Steve asks Thor, as they watch along the sidelines, and knows it sounds bitter. "Why not just let Hogun bend Tony over his knee?"
"I've got a lot of satellites, Steve," Tony says. "He was using the LDDT to smoke me out. If he knew my exact location, I doubt he'd mess around as much. This is going to give him my exact location. He's probably not going to use something non-lethal."
"I think there are a few other Hulks left, but," Cassie shrugs, hoisting a fallen billboard off the street, onto a roof. "You had to wake up early for the exciting parts."
"Why are they still attacking?" he asks, currently using evasive maneuvers on a trio of pursuing Iron Man armor, then a steep, sudden dive to dodge a jet's stream of energy blasts.
"Good lord, Cap," Tony pants after a moment, sounding dazed.  Steve agrees.  He's finding it hard to stay upright; that second orgasm was a punch to the gut, but there's nowhere to collapse without squishing important Tony parts.
"Are you glad that you have it, that someone else didn't get it?" Tony asks, more firmly, and Steve looks at the worn engraving.
Agents will have their superstitions. Frustrating  that this particular one only happened because of his absence, though.
"I . . . suppose if I had to override it, I could probably come up with something," he says. "But this goes beyond just one satellite."
"– what do you mean, worse than Cap?" Sin's demanding as Steve makes it onto the roof, shooting behind her, presumably at Steve, but not bothering to aim. Testing a theory, Steve hurls the body of the nearest goon in Sin's direction. The groaning man bounces off the force field with another ripple of blue; she barely glances up.
"I'm sorry," his voice is tangled in emotion, painfully human. "Steve. You–not even my parents. But I didn't kill my parents, so maybe that helped."
"Now," Rhodes straightens, the armor whirring to life again. "What's 'out of commission' entail, exactly?"
"It's Reyes," he says, voice wound tight.  "We need you on the Helicarrier.  It's Sin and Crossbones–"
He blinks twice, like it hurts, settling on a squint as he peers blurrily around at his surroundings in obvious confusion. Steve knows the exact moment he wakes up, eyes widening in near-comical panic. Yeah, given the state Tony had been in, he's not surprised he can't remember those last few steps to Steve's doorstep.
"Ah!" Reed says happily, and his right arm winds up, over the computer he's manning and out of sight. "Tony explained that he didn't intend for it to be a long term system, and there were some minor and not so minor issues with the information relaying processes, but I think if we put some real effort into it we could be looking at–"
Jogging out his door, exiting the hologram masking the entrance hall as brick – and enhanced reflexes are the only thing that stops him from plowing Tony Stark over.
"No," Tony says, and is quite carefully not looking in Steve's direction. "I used Thor's hair to generate an accurate genetic map; without it there would've been months of guesswork, we didn't have months. We created its mind, its heart, everything–"
It's the defensive body language from Tony that gets him to stand, move closer. Tony hadn't seen much use in asking Thor for help, but Steve had said it couldn't hurt – he should've suspected a lecture.
"Extremis fundamentally changed your brain – it reprogrammed you. Do you even know how much it did, how much it could still do–" He shakes his head, forces the tirade to a stop. The only way this could get less productive is if he brought up SHRA. "What are your leads now?"
"There's supposed to be a safety . . . after shooting, it deactivates for a ninety hours. It's in the design, even I couldn't override it," he says. "I wasn't so out of it that I would've showed up at your door if I'd known it was possible. I apologize, as much good as that does now."
"Where did Reed go?" he grumbles, directly into Steve's back, the rest of him utterly limp over Steve's shoulder.
"What were you saying, though," Tony asks in a grunt, blocking his Hill's hits, stabbing somewhat wildly at its neck with the knife he grabbed. "How you came back."
"An experiment of Reed's went bad, exposed a lot of people. They're experiencing side effects of gamma radiation."
Ignoring the fact that Steve doubts anyone could've made it less public; "Am I hearing," he says, "that the reason you ignored me for eight months is because you decided you're to blame for not seeing the future? Calling yourself a futurist doesn't actually make you clairvoyant."
Steve leans as though reaching for some sweet and sour sauce, close enough for his lips to brush against Tony's ear. "Hearing someone isn't dangerous in comparison to Thor isn't that comforting."
"Stark said he lost Extremis during that invasion, and then went on the run. There's never been a third party examination to prove Extremis is gone," Bucky says. "Ever been to Stark's place in Malibu?"
"You told me everything, Tony," Steve says, walking back to stand in front of him. And then again, "Tony."
Tony looks Steve up and down, seems put off by the stiff posture, answering woodenly, at first. "Maya told me I lost some time. Hours. The last thing I remember," he huffs a little, eyes darting to the side. "The tower had exploded. My armor was ruined. I was practically delirious, looking for somewhere to collapse, a place I'd be safe."
"That was an analogy," Tony says, blandly. "And psychics have always been able to 'hack' into minds. The brain isn't all that different from a processor to begin with, they handle information and commands in remarkably similar ways."
"I was supposed to meet Rick for dinner today," Steve says idly, using some abandoned office supplies to doodle, first a picture of Frankenstein's monster-esque bars stuck on Tony's neck, sending out signals with little beep beep beeps. Then his hand. A half closed fist, then fingers spread. Twirling a pen between them, then clasped together. He's currently eyeing the pair now, doodling their loosely curled position.
"As was said, we traveled many roads, to no avail," says the fat one. "We returned to our home to convalesce, and our comrade, who can pierce through the shrouds of nine worlds, provided us this location."
Steve surges to Reyes, who yelps in surprise as Steve nabs his earpiece. "This is Rogers, backup assault team, redirect. I repeat, assault team redirect to hot spot on 84th Brooklyn!"
Maybe he should wake Tony when he gets back, and as soon as he thinks it, it becomes cemented in his mind. There's too much left unsaid.
"Minutes?" Tony had told Steve in detail about the bleeding out, the disgusting scab cocoon, the bizarre dreams. "It took hours before."
"I don't think he'll mind. He acted like we were the ones doing him the favor," Steve says, maneuvering around the pile of LMDs to get to the bedroom, to his Captain America uniform. Reed had been thrilled when Steve suggested he work on it by himself, which had surprised Steve, somewhat. "Didn't you say you could've made that in high school?"
.  There's a few stabs of nostalgia. A Midnight Racer doll, a Green Hornet lunchbox, but other than that, the figures, the utensils, the signs, the plates, the mirrors, the cabinets. They're no more familiar to him than anyone else.
"Yeah, none of those agents knew anything either–hey, Cap," Amadeus Cho says, jogging around the corner. "It sounds like a hack job on steroids to me."
"Oh, of course. Steve, this is Ollie. Unwitting volunteer for Reed's gamma experiment number six," Sue says in a lightly reproachful tone, and with a glance at her husband, but he's too engaged in his conversation with Tony to notice. "A few people were exposed, none of the others have actually Hulked out. He managed to take Ben by surprise and escape."
"Sue," Reed calls. "I believe I'm going to be working in the lab tonight. Tony and I are going to repair his device, it's-" He stops to watch Tony grip the ledge of the building and vomit, deeply, over the side. "–well, perhaps not."
Steve grits his teeth under the heat of it, forcing himself forward; a mix of disgust and relief when he sees one of the buildings destroyed was a daycare center that would've been filled a half hour later. He doubts there will be many other lucky strokes because of the hour; early mornings are when the city starts coming to life, and the citizens have become so inured to these kinds of attacks, he wouldn't be surprised if he'll have to bodily fight some of them on this evacuation.
"We're not going to Sam's place," Tony says. "If this works, wherever we're at is probably going to end up a scorch mark."
"It has been a good day," Volstagg declares. "New companions, a glorious reckoning and a full stomach. We should make a habit of such adventuring."
Eating, being a great deal more peaceful than a godly reckoning, is quickly arranged. The three of them aren't just unimpressed with Sam's lack of selection, but genuinely depressed. Thankfully, the Lunch Box Buffet is just around the corner.
He shakes his head. "Not– obviously, but not right now. But I'm – I really shouldn't have come here, I'm sorry."
"Cloning?" Tony guesses, then processes that. "Oh. Cloning. You don't know what you're reckoning, do you?"
"The order came from Stark himself," Bucky continues. "And when she asked, he didn't give any reason for it. Didn't bother with an excuse."
Steve watches carefully, wants to refuse to get his hopes up again. His voice is unnecessarily gruff. "Straight answers, Stark."
"The whole embarrassing scenario?" Tony asks, still smiling.  "Well, most of the time I just thought about certain . . . parts of you," he says, running a hand down Steve's chest, abs, pausing suspiciously early in its decent. "And other times it wasn't about sex at all, it was just me helping you save the day.  Very King Arthur. You would thank me with a kis-- oh knock it off, I was twelve."
"So am I. It's more my fault than yours," he says. Default line. Steve's heard the same speech from about everyone involved with the attack – from the judge who was supposed to hear the case, to a card from Hill – except the people who actually did it; Red Skull and company.
The doors to the Fantasti-lab slide open smoothly, noiselessly, and Mr. Fantastic stands before a group of – unnaturally large, muscular people, seated on plastic folding chairs, presumably unwitting volunteers of Reed's gamma experiments one through ten.
Now that Tony's not armored in a slick suit, not on, now that Steve's looking at him for longer than a minute – he doesn't remember Tony ever looking quite this bad. He looks old. His face is pale and gaunt, dark moustache and goatee stick out almost garishly. His eyes are bloodshot, face seemingly fixed in a permanent look of pained concentration.
A Hulk, having stumbled over a piece of debris, falls to the ground. Getting to its feet, it releases an unholy roar, shattering the few panes of glass still intact, grabbing the chunk of metal and hurling it as hard as it can in their direction. The three of them diving frantically out of the way, it explodes through a badly battered car, into an abandoned grocery store, then out again, showing no signs of slowing down.
"Ever use one of these before?" Steve asks, when Tony slips into the driver's seat while his back was turned.
It takes less than a minute to arrive. The Hulks, wonderfully simple beings that they are, attack the first things that hit them – "Donna CRUSH plane!" roars one, slamming a massive, meaty fist against the weakening energy shield, over and over, eventually dropping from the sky as the engine is ripped free, thrown across the street. Two more Hulks are plucking Iron Man suits from the sky, pulling the armors apart arm by leg, then crushing the helmets.
“It’s not quite like that. If it was going to be his body, I’d need to fully move him over. This is more giving him access to a body. There are routines in place in my Iron Man suit so he can control where I’m flying, for if I fall asleep in it, but they aren’t specific enough for him to do any kind of fighting or dodging in between things, on the spur kind of stuff.”
“It’s impressive how bad this is.” Steve said as Jacques got up to go retch into a bush. “Did you use the last of our rations on it?”
A moment later, a blue beam shot from the roof of his tower into the sky, and just as the tractor beam so many alien abduction movies sucked people towards the source, this split the sky and the waiting alien army were pulled into the Earth’s atmosphere.
As he fell and his eyes started to adjust as he tumbled away from the explosion, he noticed the vastness of space; a phrase he’d heard before but never truly appreciated. He’d blown up the only solid thing out here; there was nothing else. There were stars and nebulas, an array of colours off to one side and stars that didn’t twinkle because there was no atmosphere and far less distance…
“Right.” No time for romance, no matter what he had read in his stories. Grabbing his shield, he ran into the hanger bay, where the Valkyrie was moving and soldiers were fighting.
“No. I got a curious call off Pepper saying you’d cancelled a meeting because you’d found a sentinel to bond with.” Rhodey stated, but Steve could feel the happiness rolling off the colonel in waves; he blatantly approved of Tony’s actions and the notion that Tony might have someone new to care about.
Bruce took his glasses off with a sigh. “‘A warm light for all mankind’. Loki’s jab at Fury about the cube.”
“Sleeping already?” Erskine’s warm voice jolted Steve’s eyes open and he looked around, surprised to find the room empty.
“Only because they don’t know what they’re looking for.” Cooper retorted, but his eyes were gentle. “You volunteered for a dangerous experiment with the hopes that you could help win the war. Doesn’t matter what you look like, those’re the actions of a hero, if you ask me.”
“Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect.” Tony pointed out, as though this should have been obvious.
“Where’re the others?” Tony asked as the Hulk began to climb the outside of the building and Thor swung his hammer and flew up.
But Steve quickly realised he should have disarmed his foe, or actually killed him when the man made an appearance again, shooting his weapon as Steve shoved Bucky out the way. Having had no chance to brace himself, Steve dropped his shield and hit the wall as the deflected blast tore a hole in the side of the train.
Flying alongside the living leviathan, he began looking for any advantage he could find. “JARVIS, find me a soft spot.”
“Come on.” Their bond was filled with the pain that Bucky was in but Steve gritted his teeth. They didn’t have time to waste, but he stopped for a moment to look into his sentinel’s eyes. “I thought you were… You’re not dead.” He’d known Bucky wasn’t dead in theory, their bond confirmed that, but it was something else to have the other man standing before him.
He considered it for a moment. “No. Call Steve privately.” The call connected, the box lighting up to the side of his screen. “Steve…”
“It’s 2012. April 19th, if you want to know.” The kid’s face was going grey as he stared in horror up at Tony. “It’s a Thursday.” He added, unsure of what exactly the problem was and how to fix it.
“Come on, let’s move.” He said, trying to make his voice warm and encouraging while his eyes still prickled from the strong smell around them.
“H-Howard? What happened?” Rogers was starting to shiver, his arms wrapped around himself as he finally lifted his gaze to fix Tony with an imploring look.
“What do you want me to do? Collect scrap metal in my little red wagon?” He questioned, annoyed that Bucky thought he’d be okay to stay here when his best friend was going off without him. If their roles were reversed, there was no way Bucky wouldn’t fight tooth and nail to be at his side.
.” And she actually had a really good point there. When the original Jarvis had died, Stane had suggested just getting a new butler to keep things in order, but Tony had been unable to even consider it… In fact, the next butler he’d had was JARVIS, his bodiless AI with the same accent but increasingly more sass. As he flew towards the tower, he tried to remember Jarvis’ smile, the subtle humour he’s displayed that the AI inherited in spades… If Stane had insisted to him getting a new butler before he was ready, he would have either got rid of the new guy or moved to another property too.
And Tony was genuinely impressed when the Hulk smashed a fist into the leviathan’s face and stopped its forward motion. The whole thing flipped over itself, ass over teakettle, and he took the chance to fire at the weaker spots in its shell. The resulting explosion nearly knocked him out the air, but he caught himself as the beast went down, coming to land beside Steve and the Hulk.
There was no time. Clenching his fists, he began to run, knocking Hydra soldiers out the way when they came for him, but he soon cleared most of the fighting to find he was too slow to catch up.
While he didn’t feel his sentinel die, he honestly wasn’t sure if the serum would let him feel that particular trauma… still, it took Steve a long time to shuffle back inside the train and sit on the floor.
Bucky interrupted again. “Well, why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs you could do.”
He grabbed hold of it, resting it on his back and began to gently angle it upwards, aiming for the portal.
“It’s been tested more than you, pal.” Stark retorted, but there was a bright spark of amusement along their bond.
It was a claim Steve had heard before, that he was the real Captain America and Cooper was just there to look nice, even Cooper himself had said it! But there was something uncomfortably knowledgeable about the way this man spoke.
“Outside.” The man looked fairly happy as he settled down on Baker’s bed, his knees nearly touching Steve’s. “There is a cool breeze and cards so…” He shrugged.
“If that’s what it takes.” Steve replied honestly. He’d do whatever he needed to do to get Bucky back.
“Come on.” Tony murmured to him, sometime later, wrapping an arm around his waist and half carrying him back to the car.
Cooper nodded as he relaxed. “Yeah. There’s only been one so far, about Captain America getting super powers from a machine powered by a jewel that came to Earth when a small comet crashed in the jungle.”
“This isn’t a consultation.” The agent said, not looking nearly as awkward as he should have while holding someone else’s champagne flute.
“And the shield?” Asked another prisoner, his British accent making Steve realise there were more men here than the captured 107th.
It was a shame he hadn’t yet had time to finish the Mark VII, which had a fault with the communications that he hadn’t been able to fix yet. But he would rather risk a problem with his suit not sealing up perfectly, which was the main problem originating from the snapped wire than being unable to contact anyone. He just had to avoid being underwater for too long.
“I can’t believe we’re coming in through the sewers.” Gabe grumbled softly as they shuffled through the tunnels.
“Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play?” Steve looked up at the other alien, hoping he would have some insight. He’d been told they were siblings, so hopefully he’d be able to provide some clue as to what exactly Loki was doing.
“It flies, I have repulsors which use particle beam technology. But basically, they burn things.” Tony grabbed his wrist and pulled him along for a closer look. “With flying, I had issues with the atmosphere.”
He forced himself to move, breaking Bucky free of the straps before sliding a hand under his shoulder.
“But you’re okay now.” Steve checked, uncomfortable with the idea that Tony might have died before they had ever met.
“Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me.” Tony sounded amused by him as he looked Steve up and down again. The hint of lust Steve felt along their bond combined with his embarrassment at the overly bright uniform had Steve turning on him.
"Yeah, you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you.” Bracelets secure and ready to call the Mark VII, Tony headed into the main area. “Cos if we can’t protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it.” They may well lose to the army, but one way or the other, Loki was going down.
Steve smirked as he tried to recall. “Showing off to those dames at the front, I think. I remember a lot of winking cos I thought he had something in his eye.”
” Zola commanded over the speaker, but Steve heard Bucky grab the shield and shoot at the man instead.
“Okay, well that’s me. My company.” He pointed to his chest when Rogers gave him a puzzled look. “I’m Tony Stark.” Rogers didn’t gain the look of understanding that Tony had expected. “Iron Man?”
A moment later, and Tony took out the gunmen, apparently having no dilemmas over what to do with them.
He scoffed as he began to head along the walk way. “He was outta his league. He should have waited. He should have…” He huffed, uncertain. Surely though, they could have done something differently.
“Oh.” Steve murmured, leaning heavily on the doorframe as he realised Mr Jarvis must have been talking to Mr Stark when he had gone quiet. “So you know about…” He trailed off, unable to think of a good way to phrase it.
“Make your move, Reindeer Games.” He dared, just wanting an excuse to have another go. The man’s armour dissolved and he held up his hands in surrender. “Good move.” But couldn’t completely ignore the tug of disappointment at the easy win.
“He really grows on you, doesn’t he?” Bruce commented in a light tone, but Steve could feel the other sentinel’s mounting anxiety at the threat presented, as well as the undercurrent of anger that flared slightly whenever their captive spoke.
The grin twitching at the corners of Stark’s lips made him realise his new guide was trying to be friendly. “Well, you were sat on a stool earlier on. Didn’t realise you were so short.”
Once he felt the truck park, he knocked out the soldier who tried to look inside, then jumped out and ran for cover. He ducked behind the armoured vehicles with the Hydra logo on then: a skull with six tentacles curling out below. He took a deep breath and looked out; he’d read about Hydra in the files he’d been able to access, but he’d had no idea their branch of the Nazi army was so large. He quickly spotted a way in, and gave himself no time to think it through; he ran over to the tank jumped up onto it and onto the roof of the building beside it.
“Is it weird? Having me pretend to be you?” Cooper asked, casting a handsome smile up at one of the girls when she came over to give him a hot drink. “Thanks, Betty.”
“I told you when I started basic training, I’ll be fine.” Bucky assured him, stepping close enough to nudge Steve with his shoulder.
“Fast food? The food is pretty standard so they have loads made up already. Means you don’t have to wait half an hour for it to get cooked.” The older man shifted, his brown eyes warm as he watched Steve fight to get his expression under control. “You still haven’t answered my question. Where in the tower do you want to stay? Assuming we go back there while it gets repaired.”
Steve nodded. “Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.” Tony began to move, knowing they needed to get a move on.
“Did Coulson say when and where I’m meeting them?” He couldn’t remember if the SHIELD agent had mentioned that or not.
He kind of wanted to go tell Bucky, but the low thrum of arousal he could feel along their bond let him know that his friend wouldn’t really care at this moment in time. He wasn’t exactly sure what the Strategic Scientific Reserve was, or if they would ever see the front lines, which didn’t seem implied in the name, but maybe they’d come across the 107th at some point.
“We are aware that you are a soldier who crash landed in early April 1945. There, you were frozen by the ice for sixty seven years. You were part of the inspiration for the Captain America comics but very few people will recognise you as such because there were only a handful of photos released identifying you as Captain Rogers after Peter Cooper’s death in 2007. There have been other photos of you with the Howling Commandos group, however you were never named in them. It is now April 19th in 2012.”
“Hop in then.” Stark turned around and headed back into his plane, Steve and Peggy following. “Where are we going?”
“Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third the weight.” Steve slid his hand and arm into the straps. “It’s completely vibration absorbent.”
“These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. I guess he never did get you to sign them.” Fury threw down some cards… Captain America cards… He wasn’t Captain America, but he was starting to wonder if someone needed to be. After all, it was Coulson who had said something about people needing a little ‘old-fashioned’ right now.
Steve raced through the rain to stand before Colonel Philips, forcing himself to stand as tall as he could at 5’4’’. “Colonel Philips.”
“This is….” He pressed his fingertips to the screen and flung it out, his own system fully compatible with SHIELD’s tech as his own holographic displays took over. “…this.”
“And then shawarma after?” Tony asked as Steve helped push him into a sitting position as the armour seemed to be too heavy for Tony to move on his own.
Because as harsh as it sounded, Tony didn’t want to fight alongside Steve just yet; not until he absolutely had to. He tended to get protective over his friends (Rhodey had taken him to one side a long time ago to tell him where he could and could not interfere) so he wasn’t sure how he would react to his bondmate being in danger so close by.
“It’s why he wanted Steve.” Bucky pointed out, before Steve could underwhelm them with his own opinion of himself. “He wanted a good man, because that would be amplified rather than anything less savoury. Steve’s a kind and compassionate – ow!” he yelped as Steve hit him, laughing.
“It seems the shell covers most of its body, sir.” JARVIS replied as over the comms, Steve could be heard giving orders confidently.
“I’m not afraid to hit an old man.” Tony mocked warningly, lifting his chin as he scowled down at Steve.
“That looks like a proper road.” Steve observed, his mind apparently clearing now there was a gap between himself and the dead bodies. “A trade route?”
He sighed. “I will be. Kind of hard to believe I’m allowed to put my own team together and go do something useful.”
Steve looked to where she pointed in the sky and spotted the little plane. He focussed carefully, and grinned as he spotted the Stark Industries paint on the side. “Stark!” He wanted to see if he could spot his guide through the window, but decided it was better to wait. He didn’t want to make himself sick before he even left for Bucky.
“I would start with that stick of his.” Steve said, keen to get a move on with breaking Loki’s plan. “It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.”
He grinned again as he realised Camp Lehigh was in New Jersey, already able to imagine Bucky’s complaints at that. He was one step closer to helping in the war.
“S-S-See?” The authority in his voice apparently helped as Rogers lifted his head enough to look at him; his eyes were still glassy, his breathing too quick, but it was a start.
“That makes sense, I suppose.” He admitted. Howard had been happy to have all the Commandos in his home in Italy and the small house he owned in France, but Steve alone had been allowed into his proper home, the one in Malibu with a gorgeous view of the Santa Monica Bay. It hadn’t been in a great state when Steve had been there, but he kinda hoped Howard had improved things there for when he lived there with his wife and… son? Grandson? Had this Mr Stark ever been there? How was he related to Howard? He could vaguely remember talking about his old friend the before sleeping… “Mr Jarvis? I don’t remember much from … this morning? Last night?”
His eyes were starting to dart around, his head moving slightly too. Hopefully, that was a good thing. What had JARVIS said? Breathing and counting stuff. Focussing on his senses, which was likely a good idea as the kid was a sentinel.
“You aren’t really.” Steve shrugged as he tugged his bowl closer in case someone tried to tidy it away before he’d finished eating. “You’re more Captain America than I am.”
“God bless.” Steve murmured back as he relaxed, trusting his team while he slept. It had been months since they’d come across the base of the other Schmidt, and since then they’d only encountered small out posts. They were taking Hydra down, one bit at a time, but their insistence that one head was replaced by two? Well, Steve really wanted to find the source of it all, Johann Schmidt, as take him down.
Then the bench he was lying on lifted up and the chamber closed around him. He let out a shaky breath as he waited for the next bit to start, but jumped as someone tapped on the metal and his ability to feel everything suddenly came rushing back.
“When you have as much money as Howard Stark? He may not have been the most… hands-on dad, but if he could solve a problem by throwing money at it, then he did.” A wry smile quirked the colonel’s lips as he shot Steve an amused glance. “Tony often tries to do the same unless someone points out a better way to fix things.”
“Is it bad if I say I’m glad you left Cooper behind?” Howard asked as he set off down the road, the other guys chattering loudly in the open back.
Thankfully, the guy head-butted him before he broke the gloves and Tony was hurled backwards. With a groan, Tony blasted towards him and threw the thunder guy into a tree, but Thor recovered quickly and easily flipped Tony in his heavy over his shoulder and to the ground. However, before he could land a hammer blow to Tony’ chest, the engineer gave his boots a blast and shot out from underneath him.
"I made one once," Tony says. "But that was a while ago." Not too long, apparently; after a minute of fiddling, the engine turns over, and he's got them in the air.
"It's entirely possible," Tony says, then squints in the dying light. He grabs the desk lamp, tosses it to Steve, who catches it easily. "Could you?"
Tony looks like he's going to be sick a third time when Steve sets him down, as gently as he can. He wobbles on his feet, then collapses against the bed, but only because it's directly behind him. "This is Sam's place," he says.
Steve tries hard not to think about the clever young man that had been his partner, wiser than he had any right to be, his wicked sense of humor, the easy conversations they had. Because it shows on his face when he does, it makes things worse. He tries, and fails, to not think of the sacrifice that Bucky made, that left him this shell. The people who made him like this to begin with. Robbed him of a life.
"Like a noise. A beeping noise?" Tony says, eyebrows arched in amusement and mouth curled in a small smile, chin in his palm, elbows on knees. "Would I be saying it in monotone, or would a piece of metal protrude from my ear and start sending out signals?"
Even with the belt, the jeans slip down far enough that Tony ends up rolling up the cuffs, which he's now fingering the frayed edges of almost idly.
"Last time we met, he told he'd forgotten the time we spent as a team because it shamed him," Tony says. "I'll give it time. I can give it time."
"What the hell," a familiar voice, and a familiar grip on his wrist hoists Steve up, "did you do to my apartment?"
Sometimes it's hard to keep in mind that he died at all; he was alive before, and is alive now, the death between is a vague, cold memory that might as well have been a bad dream.
"He's going to work on your - on the Sodomizer. You're going to sleep this off. And if you don't sleep it off, we're calling Maya Hensen."
The trio stares in at the pair, one tall enough that he has to bend to do so properly, and the shortest – relative term, he's easily 6'5 – raps lightly on the glass before poking his head in.
Considering how many times a day Steve's life is precariously close to ending, his knees feel surprisingly weak as he climbs to his feet, the students scurrying to safety.
"Which brings us to today! A brand new week of Super Human activities, one that got an early wake up call in the business district! At three am this morning, the top five stories of Stark Tower exploded."
There's another pause, the New and Mighty Avengers look to their respective team leaders, and finally Clint coughs.
"We got rid of the bad apples," says Moonstone, who Steve places now that she's finally worked up the decency to shed the Ms Marvel suit, back to her slick white one. "Unless you're going to say it's impossible for a former criminal to reform, Ronin."
Within minutes, Steve is watching Fandral, who's apparently warmed to Tony, giving combat advice with wide, exaggerated demonstrations of different sword maneuvers, which Tony watches closely.
"Cap," he says, suddenly very serious. "I've been working on something since coming back, and I'd like you to be the first to see it. It's a sort of thank you, for all you guys, the Avengers, did for me. It's not finished – what?"
"You weren't just out of it, Tony, you didn't happen to collapse at my front door, I know you better than that," Steve says. "You're after something –" that sounded bad, he didn't mean that. "You need something."
A series of primal, guttural roars bring their attention up. It's blocks away, but Steve can still recognize which floor of Baxter Building that is, and the green figure that's busted through the supposedly unbreakable glass that's now standing there. It jumps down the forty something flights. Six, seven, eight similar figures follow, and Steve sighs, already bounding onto the next roof.
"I'm not trying to pressure her," Steve says, passing a bundle of wires. "Just let her know I'm there."
"It's okay," he forces out. He's sure it is, too, just . . . Tony drunk and Tony unable to control himself, it's something he'd rather deal with clinically, from a distance. Not press up against, get any level of . . . pleasure out of.
Reyes voice continues, Steve only listens with half an ear, watching Tony in what has to be a disturbingly intense stare. "Thank you, Reyes," he says, and closes his comm.
"It's just that when all my fantasies come true in one effortless swoop, I'm usually trapped in virtual reality by a psychopath or experiencing a lucid hallucination," Tony says, lightly.
Steve stretches as he stands, until his back gives a satisfying pop. The sun's just beginning to rise, and there are two sites Sin's likely to show up at in the next few hours, already getting swarmed and prepped by teams. Steve's waiting for a call from Reyes. Considering SHIELD's luck as of late, if Steve were to pick one in advance, she'd be at the other. Or at some third, utterly unrelated city, just for the fun of it.
"It's been blocked off, there's all this construction going on," Wiccan says. "I used to go there to hang out."
But then, Tony probably wouldn't be seriously interested in someone like that, and it surprises him how disheartening the thought is.
The oddest bit, though, is the Sentry Watchtower. Whatever holds it there obviously has nothing to do with the building it once clung to, as it still floats in the exact same spot, visibly unaffected.
He doesn't stop steering, he doesn't stop moving, he's still aware and functional, but numbness hits him. "What?"
He dithers, then. Once beyond the standard  greeting, he finds himself on the edge of a minefield. He's crossed it every night for a month now, and it hasn't gotten any easier. Thirty calls, thirty non-answers, thirty messages.
"Not Extremis, not - it's complicated," Tony says. "I had precautions built into that model; it took weeks, and ludicrously expensive materials. I don't have the time or resources to rebuild it now."
It makes sense to assume Punisher has some sort of bloodlust, but Steve knows the man better. Castle doesn't get a thrill out of killing, out of a challenge or hunt – at least, not for scum like Crossbones. He doubts Castle's excited by the prospect that Crossbones will put up a better fight than Sin, or a bloated councilmember. A kill is a kill, scum is scum to Castle; Steve's sure he's too numb, too deadened, to derive any particular pleasure from one over the other.
Wordlessly, he swallows, and sighs, and steps back, cocking his head. This is too long a story to be told standing in a dark hallway.
A soft chime at the door as it opens. The three gods stare, eyes comically wide; hands caught in a cookie jar.
As awful as it sounds, given his utter uselessness back in Reed's lab, there is something satisfying in moving as fast as possible, saving lives, hollering at the top of his lungs, sending his shield flying with enough force to rip cleanly through metal.
"Hopefully not," Reed says, brows drawn down in thought. "The complete scan should give us some idea. Although that Extremis woman would be an immense help in speeding the process along, this is all rather new to me." He sounds sufficiently entertained.
It cuts to a jerky, live helicopter view of the tower. Localized is right. The top five floors have vanished completely, cleanly cut from the rest of the building; Steve's only seen this sort of destruction with concentrated beams of energy. It looks as though a giant had simply taken a knife to the top few floors. Desks on the floor below, with stacks of reports still stubbornly held to them by paperweights, are plainly visible.
Tony's other hand comes up, resting on Steve's chest, above his heart. Steve's not sure what he gets out of this, but a second later he's sniffling, releasing Steve's neck, wiping at his face and nose when Steve finally climbs off.
Steve can't stretch out on his couch. It's huge, granted, but Steve is huger, and his neck cricks, or, more often, his feet end up propped on the armrest. Tony is a perfect fit. He's out entirely, limp and unmoving where Steve set him, in a sleep that's tiring to even look at.
Steve takes another determined step forward, a familiar sort of excitement building in his chest; the sort that comes when he's about to freefall off a great height.
Steve listens with half an ear, most of his attention on reading the Health and Science section of the Yangtse Evening Post. What he already knows, he heard from more reliable sources than Lois and Linda in the morning, and what he doesn't, he'll still hear about from more reliable sources. Still, it can be helpful to know where general public opinion sits.
It's always odd, listening to War Machine and Iron Man speak to each other; the voice distortion is basically the same, but the tempos and body language are so wildly different, it's like listening to someone with multiple personality disorder carry on a conversation with himself.
Seemingly just noticing that he was in the room, the trio fix their gaze on him, jaunty expressions melting to disappointment. They obviously don't think much of the oversized sweater and bare feet. Steve winces; Tony has looked better.
"What–" Tony asks, unbuckling his seatbelt to get a decent look behind them. There's a sickening crunch, and the car shudders, losing altitude in violent, angry jerks, and Tony flies up in his seat. The sudden motions finally get to him. He's always been a sick drunk, and Steve grabs the back of his shirt on reflex, keeping him from falling out as he vomits over the edge of the car.
Steve shakes his head. "It didn't feel right. Hank is doing fine on his own, and I would've just ended up bumping heads with Clint."
Maybe it's just the fact that three massive, hairy men have appeared on Sam's third-story balcony, more than that they're wearing near-blinding colors. Maybe it's a mix of the two. They're wearing the sort of over-the-top design you'd find at a Renaissance Fair: bright colors, puffed shoulders, tights and a golden crown with long, flowing strings. They're well made, though; maybe something you'd find on a movie set, then.
"There's the Cap I know. Let me guess, you're calling every other day?" He smiles at Steve's expression, then winks almost flirtatiously, so he can't be too annoyed. "Hand me those?"
"I've got a few things to do today. You can sleep on the bed," he says. He'd slept two hours at best, not nearly enough to make up for days. "We'll talk when you wake up."
Bucky hadn't said anything. Taking the few belongings he cared about, he left the apartment the day Steve moved back in, and Steve knows the best thing, only thing, he can do is respect the distance Bucky felt the need to create, but it's painful to watch, and frustrating. The New Avengers, which Steve would've been more than willing to give his home as a headquarters to, followed Bucky's lead and found somewhere else to set up.
He couldn’t help the slight snort. “Nothing. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.” Just shy of twenty three and he got to stare down a true monster; that had to be more bad luck than anything special.
He dodged passed Peggy Carter, ignoring her shout as his bare feet slapped against the pavement. His anger gave him a single minded focus to chase the murderer down, so much so that Steve didn’t even consider his ability to catch up with the car to be odd, or how his lungs continued without strain. He climbed over moving vehicles in movements he would have never even considered before, and didn’t try to think about now. The soldier didn’t even pause until the man had grabbed a boy as his hostage and Steve’s own mind returned to him enough that his tactics changed.
Bucky shook his head, his hands twisting in the uniform he was already wearing. “I’ve got my orders, Steve. I’m shipping out tomorrow with the 107th. And I got us dates for tonight.”
“They can study my blood without me being there.” He objected, already hating where this was going. He was awful at sitting still and doing nothing.
He headed into the workshop, running his spare hand over Dum-E’s arm in greeting. “They told me where their helicarrier is?” That was surprising. Fury was normally very secretive about stuff like that.
He flew passed Barton’s building, watching in his monitor as Barton took down several of the Chitauri’s flying crafts. He used his knowledge of the area and JARVIS’s quick hints to fly through alleys and tunnels, forcing the enemy to either keep up, stop or crash. Most of them followed until they took themselves down and Barton got the rest.
“Yes, and I’m not leaving cos suddenly you get a little twitchy.” Bruce grasped one of the screens, and turned to address Fury. “I’d like to know why SHIELD is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.”
“Shall we play, doctor?” Tony turned to Bruce, and Steve tried not to feel disappointed at that. He’d been the one pointing out how important it was to get to work on this, so it was good that they were going to do just that.
“Wait!” Peggy shouted, before pulling him down into a kiss; a simply press of lips that burned through his veins in a way nothing else ever had. “Go get ’em.”
“Queens.” Erskine replied, and despite is serious face, Steve could see the amusement dancing in his eyes. “73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany… This troubles you?”
Fury turned his attention back to the alien. “Excuse me? Did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?”
“Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you.” Because there was not a chance any of them would let Loki get away with his plan. He wasn’t sure exactly how this was going to go down, but he was confident that the chips would fall in their favour.

“Yeah. Takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here: Your brother, the demi-god…” At the mention of Thor, Loki turned away, his lip curling. Tony used the distraction to slide his bracelets on. “…A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them.” His sipped his drink, barely letting the alcohol touch his tongue.
Steve resisted the urge to scratch his head; he had definitely lost track of this conversation. “Is that what just happened?” He looked over at Agent Hill then Agent Coulson to see if they knew what was going on.
“Boss?” Happy twisted around to give Tony a perplexed look as the older man leaned over to buckle the kid in. “We dropping him off somewhere?”
“You aren’t too far off. I made him and so a lotta people don’t count him as a person, but he is. He has learning systems and he’s changed a lot since I first made him.” Stark’s arms crossed over his chest as he glowered defensively.
