A little too fast, "I want it—so badly I can't—" tripping he stumbles: "but I don't," over his clumsy tongue; "but half the time I don't know how to—I don't know what to do even while I'm—thinking a thousand things an instant and—and panicking, nearly, while you—" and helpless John is pulling him tighter tighter tighter while faster and faster he is saying "—you pet me like—and you kiss me," Sherlock is gasping, "and you let me,

They get on with the sort of conversation of omission that always makes John feel like he's in a play: half of it spoken in silence eye to eye, the other performed—carefully, decorously—for all the heterosexuals present: encircling, a sea. Pointless, probably: they probably aren't paying attention. It never seems to matter, though, does it. The shopgirl's name turns out to be Yvonne.

"I could live without kissing you," John says, as steadily as he can. He could do. "I don't want to," he says, "but I could." But he would. "But I can't—I can't live with wondering how I'm hurting you because you won't tell me, Sherlock. I
Again the black empty road shining. John realized with a start that in his waking life, weeks — but how many weeks? — had passed since he last saw the moon. Full, new, crescent: he had no idea. He watched, shifting from foot to foot; for the first time, he felt the cold, as if the year were declining even in this place where the moon didn’t change. He shivered; his teeth chattered, and the chattering became the distant sound of hooves, till once more the Wild Hunt drove toward him. The hounds bayed, their red eyes intent on the ground ahead; the flame-eyed horses shook the untouched earth, and the hooded riders turned —
— “Fuck
Silence.
he reminded himself.
I was correct. The word was “whip.”
Sherlock became aware that the doctor was holding his elbow and that he was leaning into the offered support. “No,” he said.
“Oh, but that’s just the word: invested. Right now” — Jim came closer — “right now, you’re teetering on the edge of something great.” He was a few inches shorter than Sherlock; it was like having a shiny fast animal looking at his throat, to have Jim so near. “I think you’re going to like it. You’re clever. Cleverer than most people. Cleverer than almost everybody. Don’t you agree?”
What was this, why were his palms wet. He had got used to Jim — all right, not used to Jim, exactly, but used to this life, used to its shape, its limits, its conveniences and the small liberties he had been permitted since the blackout. It was hard to remember, now that several weeks had passed, what the point of attempting to quit heroin had been. A delusional exercise.
On the way, he thought over his options. It was a short walk, but that was all right, as there weren’t many options to think over. Jim, or his flash-suited muscle, had broken Wiggins’s fingers, but Niall hadn’t been given even that much warning; Jim had escalated fast. Unexpectedly fast. Quite likely, Sherlock could find someone else to supply him without very much trouble — could find someone, and then another someone, and then, perhaps, a third someone, before word got out to every last dealer in London that selling to Shezza would get you killed. Soon enough, the police would be looking for a serial killer, and Jim would have laid a trail of breadcrumbs, of blood and hair and shoeprints, to one Will Holmes.
“Bless you both,” she said, “you don’t believe there’s only one man in the world like Baron Adelbert Gruner, do you? Most of us, I daresay, have had a friend hard done by that way. Maybe Kitty was right to throw that vitriol, and maybe she wasn’t, but I went to see her in prison all the same, and when she came to me after, to tell me what she hoped for from you, don’t you think I found it in my heart to lend her the money for those clothes?”
This time, it became apparent that the two men whose presence he had imagined were, in fact, present, flanking the door like telamones. Suits and ties; earpieces; hands at sides.
, fellatio, and sodomy. Commonplace! and, to most of my fellow Englishmen, beyond the pale. As for my own inclinations . . .
and what if Jim had decided to bring the Divorce forward,
Sherlock took his hand. “Not quite.”
The meeting had not devolved into a shouting match, or at least not yet; there was that much to be said, although the Assistant Undersecretary for Operational Effectiveness had, over the past half hour, acquired quite a remarkable stabbing pain in his temples.
the headline the next day reads “WAS SHE REALLY ALIVE —
Sherlock waits.
“Ssh,” Sherlock says. He even puts a finger to John’s lips. The door at the far end of the aviary room is opening to reveal the director of Greater London Lovebird Rescue, the tired mother, and the five children, whose sad faces brighten when they see the airy room and the joyful birds cheeping and twittering throughout. The mother is carrying Beakley in his too-small cage. Even from this distance John can see him raise his head at the sound of the other birds, and begin to look about him.
“Does it?” replied the Foreign Secretary, and got up at last. Zardari, Skeffings, and de la Pole followed him out. De la Pole, the last in the train, gave Mycroft an anxious glance as he went: so, doubtful again, and after all that work.

Jim had had a stylist cut Sherlock’s hair and slick it back; at the time, Sherlock thought the result might scream “operator” a little

“Where did that family live?” he asks, casually, over breakfast.

“It wasn’t public revulsion to their servitude at all, was it?” John says.
John said.
It was.
Surely, I thought, he would never understand how I could love him and yet wish to inflict such perversions upon him. He would recoil from me — from the thought that he had risked the sanction of society and the law for me; had slept beside me; had spoken words of love to me. Bad enough to be a sodomite or a flagellant, but to be both!
Sherlock was dying to fix. “I’m going to be away for a while. A few weeks, I can’t be sure,” he said.
“If. If you ever want any part of me up your bum ever again: Shut. Up.”
“It’s quite sad that you assume I have an ulterior motive.”
of that Sherlock was certain, something in someone’s hearing, maybe something to someone directly, and anyway there followed white blank day after white blank day after white blank day, and no one came to visit him, which would, even to the meanest mind, have been a
blah blah, and if it was a parent but suddenly and untimely and so on, or a spouse, then “So young!” would suit as well as anything, but Sherlock had it right, because Oliphant said, “Six.
“All right, my dear,” he replied, growing serious again. “There’s something here you’re worried about — of course I see that. No more teasing, then,” and he commenced to read.
” Still on the tightrope. Feisty Vassals were loyal to their feudal lords, were they not? Their very feistiness demonstrated their allegiance; their affection, even.
John waits, saying nothing.
He was required to eat two meals a day. He could heat one of the prepared meals supplied to him, or order takeaway from his choice of five restaurants where Jim’s organization had accounts. They were good restaurants and delivery was always swift.
And this was why Holmes’s innocent question put me in some difficulty. For to answer it would be to divulge my connection with the booksellers of Holywell Street, and that line of conversation led, in turn, directly to the matter of my sexual tastes. Therefore, “It’s nothing, Holmes,” I said.
“You were testing a hypothesis.”
always happier when at his work — so we bade the lady enter and be seated.
“Culverton Smith was present,” Sherlock says, clearly in the belief that his train of thought will be apparent to John.
“I suppose it’s ‘running,’ today?” I asked.
Hearing himself, John flinches.
“Good,” she replied; “but look here, do you mind if, first, I take out the pages he made about myself?”
no matter how often they claimed to be
He went straight to Wiggins’s place, because Wiggins never went out and Sherlock needed to fix without wasting any time tracking down a source who might inconveniently have decided to take in an art film or go to Casablanca for the waters. Wiggins had taken a degree in neurology before he realized how much easier it would be to get hold of drugs if he dealt them himself, and he liked to pretend to keep up with scientific pursuits, so he had a decent chem lab set up in his kitchen. He was developing designer drugs, he said, not that Sherlock had ever seen any sign of it, but he let Sherlock conduct experiments sometimes, when Sherlock didn’t owe him any money.
he thought. This made no difference.
Sherlock read the lines aloud; the soldier looked down. “This passage means a great deal to you?” Of course the soldier had already told him so. Sherlock placed the index and middle finger of his left hand on the translation, and with his right hand covered his eyes. Between his fingers he watched the soldier watching him.
“Although some of the food is passable, I suppose.”
“Well,
he had begun, and in response Sherlock began blathering in comedic-lofty vein about the utility of milk-spoilage chronologies in estimating how long a flat had been empty, supposing the tenant had embezzled vast sums from the charitable organization that employed her and then fled the UK . . . Sherlock kept up this stream of preposterousness for so long that John started to laugh, and put up his hands to signify
“No,” Sherlock agreed, “it’s not, but why don’t you look into her finances? Check my work that far and you might develop some confidence in the rest.”
“Oh, no!” Jim put his hands up to his face, making a stretched-out, wide-eyed expression. Then he took his hands down again and smiled. “You had to give them a name,” he pointed out, pleasantly.
On the Thursday of Sherlock's third week in Montague Street the weather warmed suddenly and the sun grew bright; early that afternoon, the front-door chime sounded, and behind it came the tumult of motors, voices, feet, and then fresh soft air touched with petrol and, barely, with the green of Russell Square. Sherlock said hello to the middle-aged man who had entered, he shook the man's hand, and he thought of how after Sherlock was done with him the man would take hold of the handle of the waiting room door and open it and step out onto the pavement and drop into the stream of people again, and then would walk toward whatever destination he desired, having relieved Sherlock's boredom for twenty minutes or an hour, and Sherlock hated him.
Sherlock’s heart stutters.
The JIO chair looked even more irritated. “You know the answer to that question as well as you knew the answer to the one previous: they are faring no better.”
“Good God.” Sherlock has drawn himself up and back, wide-eyed, and plainly feeling the lack of (a) a dressing gown (b) a couch upon which to fling himself while wearing said dressing gown. “These were meant to be luxury accommodations. Obviously the manager has been embezzling even more than Tyndale was aware.”
“You do know it’s just another kind of camp, don’t you? All that poker-stiff politeness?”
All at once, I did. For our respectable-seeming visitor was none other than Kitty Winter, whose help had been invaluable in bringing to an end the depredations of the vile Baron Adelbert Gruner, and who had seized her moment to destroy not only his career but his handsome face. Even now, as I write these words, I shudder to remember how he shrieked as the vitriol ate away his flesh.
“I note with interest,” Sherlock said, having recovered himself somewhat, “your use of the past tense.”
But what he believes now is that Sherlock arranges to be caught watching him. Or that the puzzlement is real but is only what anyone with a mildly interesting pet might feel, seeing the pet, for cryptic reasons, grow less amenable.
“Oh, come on, Will, you can figure that out All. By. Yourself.” This with jazz hands.
Slowly, slowly, he unfolded that hand. He kissed my palm.
Sherlock could hear them say. Shuddering elaborately. Well, they weren’t wrong.
It had been a shock to discover, when Jim left him back at the shop after that casual friendly mentoring-rich stroll, that he was tired out. Partly that was because Jim’s company, Jim’s attention, was — well, it was best faced with every sense attuned to all signals that might come one’s way; perhaps that was how one might most clearly put the case — anyway, fifteen minutes of Jim in certain moods was enough to leave one sweating and trembling. He was spending more time with Sherlock now, what with the shopping for Will Holmes’s suits, shirts, shoes, what with the need to decide how Will might present himself the better to become indispensable to Andy Rockham. It was bad. It was . . . very bad, Sherlock admitted to himself. And Jim hadn’t even been in one of

“I can read and write and do my sums, but who’ll hire me to teach? I can sew, but my mother went blind sewing. I can whore” — I was irrationally shocked to hear the word spoken in our sitting-room — “but . . . I couldn’t make it pay enough, anyhow.” I thought, with a pang of conscience, that neither I nor Holmes had considered how Miss Winter must have earned her bread after Gruner abandoned her. It is one thing to be a Liane de Pougy, however notorious, another to ply the streets of the West End.
Still worse, he seemed to feel it incumbent upon him to find means of harassing me during the week he passed in the familial embrace. I now recite the roster of his offenses, which he committed partly by proxy (
“Pick a person in this room,” Sherlock replied, “and give me five minutes. Then see if that situation changes.”
The dead animate’s face had been contorted in terror and pain, but Sherlock had called her “it.” Of all those present at that scene, it was Sherlock, dropping his history lesson and his bored deductions, Sherlock empty of pity, who seemed least human.
I returned. To which the reply came within the hour:
And a pause. “Yeah” — cautiously.
“I then commenced to bring him to the very verge of ecstasy — thrice! — while he pleaded and shook. He clutched at the sheets, at his own hair, at every thing within reach, and each time I sensed his crisis approach, I drew away, and set my thumb and forefinger at the base of his stand to prevent the emission. How beautiful his helpless, yet willing surrender was to me! I resolved to torment him only twice more, before allowing him to reach the apex of his pleasure. . . .”]
“And you knew I’d left it behind, but you decided not to mention the fact. Why?”
From Montague Street, clients — marks — would enter a waiting room with four upholstered chairs in green-and-gray hound’s-tooth. The front window, discreetly curtained, announced “W. S. S. Holmes, Practical and Spiritual Counseling,” in crisp black Garamond. On the walls, framed quotations, or, properly speaking, pseudo-quotations, to wit:
He felt strong enough to venture outside the tent. There was a bench under a tree that overlooked the road by which the wounded came. He hadn’t been aware of it when he himself was brought, of course, but he thought somehow he might recognize it — that it might be the road from his fever dream.
, is any different from what
In the weeks after the discovery of the dead animate, John concludes that there’s no longer even any ambiguity. Sherlock’s bright smiles are gimcrack with the gloss peeling off; John can’t understand how even the dimmest client is fooled, and as for himself — how on earth had he fallen for such counterfeit? How had he set nothing of himself aside, why had he so recklessly given everything over, how had he not perceived the swindle?

Holmes opened the volume and at once was convulsed with laughter. “ ‘By Dr. G.M.A. Huche, of
83: “Days had passed since I last allowed Basingstoke any release. He trembled as I drew his fattened cock between my lips, and a short cry escaped him. I withdrew, wiping my mouth, and reminded him sternly that if he should spend, I would first deliver such a birching as would prevent his sitting for a week, and furthermore during that same space he would be forbidden to so much as hold his own prick to make water, but would be required to seek my permission and my aid.
“One more thing, Mr. Holmes,” said the Foreign Secretary, breaking into the rustles and creaks as the others began to reassemble themselves. Saundra Zardari’s phone quietly sang its Android-booting-up song. At Hareton’s words, they all paused. The phone finished its song.
— a belt, with a scabbard, and in the scabbard a black slender knife.
said the voice in his head which had been using that word for some time now, though Sherlock preferred to ignore it — wouldn’t rate two officers in civilian dress, this was a private location for holding prisoners, and the men at the door were guards.
“Poor boy,” Holmes remarked to me when we had said good night to “Roger” (for so he, excruciatingly, called himself), “he must be very new to the life of the streets if he doesn’t even know to look for custom in Piccadilly.”
“She makes the best of a bad situation, she means.”
Sherlock smiled. “She saves most of the money you give her for clothes — she’s worked out that though your own tailoring is bespoke, you haven’t a clue about women’s attire, she knows her position with you is a temporary one, and she’s thinking ahead, building up a nest egg for the weary days of middle age.”
Perhaps Molly will be able to work out an approximate date of death (death?) from whatever insect life has established itself in the dried blood. And no doubt Sherlock has conducted experiments concerning the deterioration of all manner of fabric under all manner of weather. But the — body — of course has not decomposed at all, or not to any extent measurable on a human scale. It will crumble eventually: in geologic time.
I interrupted his fumbling about at the valve. “Never mind that, Wiggins. There’s a slip of paper inside bearing the words ‘my third,’ is there not?”

Certainly she should feel free to refer friends to the practice; he would do what he could for them.
“The CPS are trying to work that out. For my money — ” The DI shrugs. “Looks like she suffered enough, didn’t she? For it to count for something.”
Sherlock let go the lanyard. “Yes, Dr. Watson, we have. Approximately two and a half minutes ago, by my reckoning.”
Someone was kicking Sherlock’s leg: Sherlock could feel it, even though his leg was far away. “I’m
John thought — ears pinned, plunging forward, then staggering, already torn, bloodgleam spatters soaking into the earth, and the hounds close on him; and John, not understanding his own impulse (
Past featureless towers and Superdrug and Hotel Chocolat, past mobile phone shops and mattress specialists and Itsu Japanese takeaway, past all the things that were no different from any other things —

“Tully.”
It was impossible to know what satisfaction Sherlock might gain from feigning to love John — who, after all, knew himself to be an ordinary physician, of modest magic, with a body rather scarred and plain, intelligent enough as long as no comparisons were made with that restless and beautiful genius. But what John couldn’t know he could guess; he could guess that, if the Sherlock who smiled and kissed him was as false as all the others, then perhaps it simply amused him to have a living toy.
As the moon outside his window shrank toward darkness, John thought of the road he had visited in his own fever dreams.
he tries to remind himself. He doesn’t care, even if it makes him an awful person, he doesn’t care: he’s not them, he’s
Sherlock watched, remotely, the top of John Watson’s head, the meticulous movements of his damaged and his undamaged hand. Regular heroin use, besides making pain relief more difficult, often wreaks havoc on sexual function in men. Or, to put it less tastefully, Sherlock did not get hard. He didn’t get hard-ish. He never woke up hard, he didn’t get hard when he took himself in hand, not that he had tried that in ages, and as he watched John Watson at work on his trouser leg, nothing stirred. But John Watson was flushing. Sherlock thought he could remember what that felt like: just a little arousal, a pleasant focused warmth, a sensation as of skin tightening, not enough to get in a person’s way, but enough to make him want to do something mildly reckless. (Crazy-reckless might follow.)
He forgot all about the first client the moment she was out the door. The second client was a soldier.
John puts his hands flat on the table and levers himself up. “Okay,” he says, aloud. He gets himself to the cabinet where he keeps his coffee mug and a couple of glasses, at which point he realizes that he hasn’t got a measuring cup and, if he knows Sherlock, that 250ml is important.
When he failed to respond, however —
“What do you think,” Jim said: “trad, or nouvelle?”
“Get it replaced now,” Sherlock says; “save us time in the morning,” and he’s gone.
Fourteen boulders. Rough oblongs and rough near-oblongs. The stone black against blue-green water streaked with egg-blue, below bird-blue sky. Land dropped away behind. The stones stood in equipoise, like dancers
He fastened his gaze on the station entrance and stepped off the curb.
There was a species of nonsense for every kind of pain, and all Sherlock need do was choose the right nonsense and apply it.
He rejected the idea of asking Jim for sound samples. He was ignorant of how criminal organizations might dispose of bodies, assuming they didn’t want the bodies found, although even without direct empirical knowledge he could form hypotheses.
Wiggins suffered through interminable sermons. Apparently biscuits also manifested themselves along with the young lady; these twin enticements he all too predictably found irresistible.
“Is it murder, legally?” John asks Lestrade, who puts his hands up for “Who knows?”
“Hey,” said the baritone, “can you believe this, Jim? He’s still got a vein.”
John understood.
“Well. I won’t pretend I’m not disappointed, but so it goes. Here’s a little something for your time.”

John is pulling his T-shirt over his head and shucking his trousers and pants before Sherlock has finished the sentence; he falls to his knees between Sherlock’s legs and slaps his hands away, reaches up with one hand to push him down. “Get — get these —” so Sherlock arches up his hips, Christ yes, pants off
Anyway, he shouldn’t be embarrassed about this . . .
Just before nine in the morning, a messenger appeared bearing the day’s ration of heroin, and Sherlock fixed.
* * *
When had he fallen in love with Sherlock? John couldn't say, really. Somewhere between morning tea and late night takeaway. Somewhere between chasing criminals down dark alleys together and those impressive, ridiculous deductions. Somewhere between dark hair and long limbs and unearthly blue eyes.
The funeral was a brief affair. Attended by a handful of estranged family and friends. John felt surprisingly numb as they lowered his mother's casket into the fresh-turned earth. He waited and waited, but to his surprise, the tears never came. He flew back to Afghanistan the next day, stoic and hardened.
And for a time, they'd been happy. They dated for two, going on three years. Shared a flat. John had grown comfortable and complacent in their relationship. Had taken it for granted that he would marry Olivia. He picked out a ring and everything, with grand plans to propose after graduation.
Mary. Oh, Mary. Quite contrary, just like the rhyme said.
Sherlock pulled him more firmly against his chest. John could hear his heart racing through the thin fabric of his shirt. "You see, but you do not observe, John."
It happened over tea.
Sherlock, astute as ever, sensed John's rising panic. Making his way round the table, he fluidly plucked John's mug from his trembling hands.
But it was just an idea. Something to placate John's hurt and heartbreak. He had really thought he'd loved her- that she was
He tried to postpone his deployment. His mother had protested and insisted that he go regardless. They rowed about it terribly, but his mother had been unrelenting. Heaven be it on her if she was a burden to
"You're an idiot, John Watson," Sherlock breathed. And before he could protest, Sherlock flung his arms around John and pulled him into a tight, frantic embrace.
Living with the man was a dizzying experience. One minute, he was a whirlwind of frenzied activity. The next, he would lay listless on the couch for days on end. It was the highest of highs and lowest of lows with Sherlock. He was a walking contradiction. Both brilliant and completely clueless. Careless yet meticulous. Endearing and hopelessly infuriating. A lovely disaster.
can't-"
"John!"
John shrunk back in his chair. Sherlock looked absolutely ragged. Desperate in a way John had never seen him before. "A long time," he admitted finally. "Since before- before Mary. And before the jump, probably. But that was when I first realised it."
John gripped his pajama bottoms tightly, heart sinking. "Sorry. I'm sorry, Sherlock. It doesn't matter. I didn't mean for you to find out. It doesn't matter-"
John held her as she died, all clammy and shaking and slick with blood. He watched as the life left her eyes, as her limbs went limp and her body grew cold.
"John..."
"Stop
Pancreatic cancer. Three to six months.
John tensed upon hearing his name spoken like that. Oh, shite. Oh, god no. He never meant for Sherlock to find out, never meant to feel this way
But when he thought about it, he couldn't even say when their love had begun to die.
John flinched at the question and kept his eyes tightly closed.
They whispered secrets to each other from across their bedroom at night. John had been the first one Harry told when she realised she liked girls. He was eight, and Harry nearly eleven, when she'd whispered this secret to John under the safety of darkness. Told him all about her crush on the pretty red-head neighbor girl.
Dangerously bored.
Nearly four months had passed since Mary's death. John had moved back to Baker Street two months prior, if only to escape that empty house and the memories that still lingered there.
Not after Mary- not Sherlock, oh god-
John nods. "Yesterday," he explains.
"No," Sherlock whispers; and John blink-blink-blink nodding nods and touches—cheek, and—chin, and says, "Is it—unfair of me," as his voice swoops and dives, "that I've only just started giving that much of any weight?" and loud and manic Sherlock laughs, saying, "Unfair hasn't stopped me any time in the past five years"; and wrench-ribs clenching John shakes his head shakes his head pressing face to face squeezing all of him against him and saying, "Don't," heavy-fierce, "
and Sherlock just goes, breathing with it, his trapped left hand pulling his knee nearly to his nose, the bendy bastard, while John heart pounding rubs two slick fingers against him, or—or three, and Sherlock just sighs and wraps his right arm back around him, tight across John's shoulders, while John pants into his mouth with three fingers petting shallowly into him, John's skin scraping oversensitive against the underside of his clothes.
They kiss for a long time. The sun red and gold through the windows, purpling like a bruise. Dreamy, John thinks, warm and airless in his little second-storey room. Close.
to John, what Sherlock does and does not say; it matters to him that Sherlock is fierce and eager and hungry with him on the sofa, in the kitchen, entwining on his vast white-sheeted island of a bed; that Sherlock with him is like opening, over and over, a clasped hand, to show what lies cradled inside. That John had said to him in their living room,
Around the hard, aching lump in his throat, John swallows.
"Come now, he'd never stoop to doing it himself." John tugs Sherlock's hand up, kisses—kisses his knuckles, nuzzling, mouth feeling—wet, and—
"You," Sherlock gasps, "absolute

"My hols or their hols?" Marianne asks. Laughs, a little. Shrugs. "Five weeks, almost. Long enough to give my flat a good clean and and catch up on my reading, anyway."
"Your mobile, I meant," John explains. "Does she do that a lot?"
"It's all right," John says, very gently: Sherlock huffs a sharp breath. "
John grins. "Well, to be fair, half of us had to ask you how to find the building."
Watching him. So close, still Sherlock is looking half to the side. His eyelids tremble: helpless John touches his throat.
"Yeah," John says, "I mean—that's sorted, so—well done"; and Sherlock's eyes open, startled.
"This sort of razor," John asks. "Or do they just... issue them at all the nation's leading public schools, upon the day one turns fourteen."
Sherlock is standing at the hob, frowning at the pan at the front and poking it with his favorite wooden spoon. Everything smells, profoundly, of the brown-sharp-sweet smells of him cooking; he's taken his shoes off, but not his socks. It makes John's throat clench. His own bare toes curl bare on the lino. Outside the rain batters dully at the windows. John watches Sherlock prod at the onions. He doesn't look up until John clears his throat.
: I'm not from the UK, and I'm also not what we call here in the US at least a "mandated reporter" (someone in a profession, like medicine or teaching, who is required by law to make a report to the police if they suspect that a child under their professional care is being abused or neglected). I have, however, done a lot of work with young people, including—more often than I'd like—young people in unstable or dangerous situations; and I did some research on how those issues play out specifically for GPs and teachers in the UK. I specifically wanted to know what John's options would be, for helping Ms. Bowcott and her kids. What I read suggested that given that particular consultation, he would have the option to refer them to social services, but would not be required to do so; and that he might have good reason to not
"Tell me," Sherlock murmurs. "Please." Looking up.
John drops the chart on his desk. Danish wrapped up in a serviette and tucked into the top drawer, mobile just alongside and silenced.
Then slowly, Sherlock says, "All right"; and stomach loosening, John nods.
"More?" Sherlock murmurs, mouth pressed against him; and John knots up his hand in the front of his own too-short hair.
"I've thought of switching to Tesco's," he says. "Just for variety."

"I like to look at you," John says, quiet, "I always—"; and then swallows. "I keep—I kept thinking, back. Before. You—your mirror."
"If you don't want," Sherlock begins, but John squares his shoulders. Straightens up. Pries his own throat open: "Put those on," John says, low, flicks his gaze down at Sherlock's pocket; and when Sherlock pulls them out and slides them onto the bridge of his nose, resting a hair too low with his eyes scalpel-edged above them, cheeks pink, John comes the rest of the way into the living room, and then shuts and locks the door.

"I want to try something," Sherlock says, very quietly.

George nods, then says, "You know I can't give you a proper consult. And I wouldn't be comfortable taking Sherlock on as a client, either—I've worked with you for too long."
." He takes a breath. Another. "I didn't think about it like that," he says, unsteady. "I don't think I really quite thought about it at all."
"You like it," Sherlock says. "It gets you hot."
"I want," he gasps, and then folds his bent arm across his face.
"I didn't mean it like that," John explains. Correcting. "You don't have to if—I just meant—I know what you mean"; and Sherlock twists back towards him. Bumping his face to John's face.
, "You're so—close, I—" and laughs, face smashed into the pillow blinking back bright lights while Sherlock pets at the hot-aching edges of his insides and John drives both elbows into the mattress, pushing back—all his skin pulled up to peaks and heart pounding John scrapes—his hand slid down and—and the side of his thumb under himself over his own nipple purple-hot and throbbing as he groans, "
If. If. Sherlock hasn't made a sound.
"How about," John says, "I get a flannel and then come back, because—well, frankly, if we wait another five minutes I'm going to pass out and end up glued to you, and." He laughs, feeling awkward, heart beating hard and his blood tide-unsteady. He says, "Symbolic appeal of that aside."

—", as Sherlock is popping John's egg into his mouth.
Sherlock's spent five days casually invading John's space to read his text messages and steal his laptop, but hasn't done a scrap more than breathe against the edges of John's face, his voice a low panther growl so close and hot that every single part of John's body that can become erect does, instantly; and John didn't—he wasn't—he hadn't been
John shivers. "Keep talking," he says, "I like to know how I'm doing"; and pulls Sherlock's cock into his mouth.
"Yeah?" John asks, crackling, throat tight; and Sherlock nods.
John's thumb. Sherlock's nipple. Predictable: Sherlock inhales, slow; so John does it again. Wondering: were they not in the bath, would he feel Sherlock's skin prickle? The breath in his breath at the edges of Sherlock's soft mouth feels warmer. Quicker. John rolls Sherlock's crinkling-hot skin between him forefinger and thumb. Plucks at him, quick; and Sherlock's breath puffs into his mouth.
"Hm."
"Yeah, or." John squirms. Breathes deep. Squeezes:
Sherlock plays for a long time. John turns the lamp on at the end of the sofa, beside his stone-cold tea, and tries to read.
"Wanting your cock down my throat," Sherlock says, sounding irritated; so John swallows and says, "Fair enough."
It's—bizarre, John finds. Over and over and over again. To want—to want so badly to be able to to
"I thought it might be hard," John says, and Sherlock pulls back enough to look at him. John explains, "To ask, I mean."
Presses his mouth to his mouth. A sweet, soft shimmering bubble of a kiss.
"I think that's yours," John says.
"I wanted to have you in the cab on the way over," Sherlock says, "I would've—there was a flat, it was empty, the window latch was—trivial, I would've—put my tongue up you on the floor in the kitchen, screwed you against the wall of the shower"; and John sighs, and closes his eyes.
John asks, "For worrying me? or—," but Sherlock just gets redder. John sighs. "Don't be, please." As gently as he can. "You know I'd do a lot more than delete a string of saucy texts to get rid of one that made you uncomfortable, yeah?"
Sherlock is quiet for a long, long time. Finally he asks, "Is this part of your typical gentle doctorly speech about erectile dysfunction," his voice thick; and John presses all over against him. Heat is radiating off Sherlock's sweaty face: John cups his red cheek in his palm.
"I don't know," he says, after a moment, and then, "I—"
"Well, only one cure for that," she says, standing up; and he nods, pushing to his feet and tucking his hands in his pockets, and waits for her to shoulder her handbag so they can walk back to Tesco's, side by side.
for information, and I think that if that doesn't remind you of anything—"
"Your cock," John whispers, and shoves the meat of his palm under his mouth.
with Sherlock's body pressed close and then closer, closer,
They kiss. And kiss. This strange body-warm space, skinless, mouth to mouth: John feels scraped all over with sandpaper. It's—
: coffee table, shin; and that'll leave one hell of a bruise for the morning but Sherlock's eyes are darkening, lips parting, and John doesn't care.
Sherlock is bent over the sink, head bowed, hands braced.

disappointing," Sherlock says, schooling his face into something like solemnity, even while his mouth is still curling up at the corner: delighted, helplessly. "Does that mean you can't ride my prick in the bath?"
"John." Breathless, half laughing: his big hand sliding down to squeeze soft at the nape of John's neck: "You
"I don't know, do I?" John shakes his head. "I just feel like—like there's this wall, between him and me, or—or one-way glass, where he can see me, and I can't see him. And so he—he knows everything about me, and I—I can't even—": swallowing. Swallowing. "Keep," he says, "him safe."
John folds his hand over Sherlock's hand. Breathes. Sherlock breathes against his jaw, and John breathes.

had been shocking. It hadn't, at any point, really seemed particularly shocking that Sherlock had come back. It had been such a relief. John had—he remembers—he can remember, so clearly, sitting on the low, dangerously soft sofa in George's closet of an office (a long-running though perhaps not actually particularly funny joke) and saying,
"To not be allowed to what, John?" George asks.
"Christ," John gasps, blinking; and Sherlock makes a taut-quavering sound shivering in-under John's skin and then pulls him, wobbling, down. Stunned John presses his face to his throat.
use a hair dryer and three different kinds of product, the sort of of teacher who—who watched the boys on the rugby squad, then, just enough for everyone to wonder if he wasn't watching a bit too closely. Nothing that would ever merit being proved. The sort of teacher who never did anything out of line that anyone truly knew of but still couldn't sidestep the rumors, the sort who was closer in age to his pupils than the rest of the teachers, the sort who— "Did you watch me," John asks, heart pounding: a little too loud; "did you watch me through your window, at practice?" and his blood surges up into his cheeks, scalding, searing; not fifteen but
Sherlock is badly flushed, tomato red. Beautiful.
Soft: a barbed and bladed ache. Gentle his mouth on his mouth in late summer's-day silence:
"Fucking machine," Sherlock says, after a moment.
Sherlock's mouth widens, eyes slipping shut; and so John shifts up close against him to ask, "...Did you bring any back?"; and Sherlock laughs.
Sherlock scrubs at his own hair with a fist, saying, "Don't, please, I'm already dreadful at managing myself in public," in a queer breathless hollowed-out voice: and John's ribs tighten. Throb. He—could, he could do it; has done. He'd just turned up in 2010 for a flatshare and Sherlock—Sherlock didn't even care just did—gone on doing his ordinary everyday Sherlocky things while John'd done while John'd made for himself while John'd just—
Hips tight against him. Into his mouth pressing— "Yeah," John gasps, helpless; "yeah, I—of course": nodding over and over as Sherlock breathes into him, "You'll stay here with me," low and jaguar-dangerous, hot on John's lips—cheek—jaw— "you'll let me get you off."
The air is very cold. He feels hot. Sherlock is probably—taking critical experimental notes, or whatever, but John is mostly aware of his  own toes, curling into the sheets. His heavy breath. Sherlock touches him, then, thumb petting a soft arced stripe over his hottest swollen skin and John is gasping. Pushing back. Helpless.

with a picture of the lettuce scattered all over his desk, the two paracetamol on the paper from his sandwich, just before he washes them down with the last of his tea, then tidies away the rest of the mess and rings for his next patient, goes to pull open his door. His mobile buzzes on the desk:
"Murder someone," John suggests.
"Sherlock," John sighs, with a terrible premonition about where this all is heading.
John watches him. The taut, angled carat of his mouth.
Sherlock's eyelids slip lower, lower. "It seems a bit unfair," he says. Solicitous:
"Some punter's been leaving notes for the young men in the chorus," Sherlock explains. "Nasty, some of them. And—generally no turrets for
"Which?" Sherlock gasps, arching against his hands; "This," John murmurs, rubbing his belly; "Six," Sherlock says, thick, and then, "I—I have things, I—"
itself, that John hardly ever even notices, until it starts. To slip away.
John shuts his laptop. "Hey," he says, sliding his laptop onto the coffee table. "You're not. Worked up, are you?"
"Too long is too much?" John suggests. "It gets. Intense."
"I had a panic attack, you can call it what it was, Sherlock, but that's—that's not about you, not really." John takes a breath, scooting forward, knees bracketing Sherlock's ribcage. "Look," John says, very steadily. "I've got—things. About me, that are particularly difficult, for me." He takes another breath. "And yes, some of them also in some ways have to do with you, you are—uniquely well positioned, in a lot of ways, to push my buttons. Which you know." Sherlock's face is crumpled, aching: John breathes. "But I also—it's not like it happens in a vacuum," John says, "I do have choices, I could've—" He stops. Shakes his head. "And that's not the point," he says. "Not really." Focus,
"You can wash the both of us again when we're finished," John says, ignoring his own already-pruney fingers and the taut-dry prickle of the skin on his back. He thinks they'll never be done. Sherlock makes a disgruntled noise, then grabs John's arse, undermining his own argument. Grinning John darts in for another kiss. Sherlock just opens for him, tongue thick-slippery and hungry as his hands slide down across John's arse—over the backs of his thighs—to his arse again,
John shifts, surprised. Shouldn't be. Should've seen it coming. Last night after John'd finally got him on the phone, after a series of false starts and half admissions and apologies where no one said they were sorry, they had been silent. In the silence John had been wanting him close, wanting to gather him up and wrap his arms around him and kiss his hot red face because it seems sometimes like the only way he can speak and Sherlock can hear; and then Sherlock had asked, very hesitant, anxious and embarrassed:
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock dear,” said Mrs Hudson, wringing her hands.  “I should have been paying better attention to the staff leaving the kitchens.”
“Now wait a minute,” said Lestrade.  “We can’t just go around arresting everyone who has a pink suitcase.  We need more than that to go on.  And how do you even know she had a pink suitcase?”
John meandered through the crowd, looking at the artwork and making his way towards a buffet table on the opposite side of the room.  When he reached it, he realized why Sherlock had suggested he eat before the party.  The only hors d’oeurves on the table were small cubes of what appeared to be jellied meat on round crackers.  John wrinkled his nose and continued around the room.  He paused for a moment near the drinks table when the sound of Sherlock’s name caught his ear.
“Thank you,” said Sherlock.
John stood there for a moment longer, his arms crossed, blocking he doorway.  And then he started laughing.  Sherlock’s face started turning red and John took a deep breath to compose himself.  “Sherlock, I just called you a ridiculous pain in the ass.  Do you really think I’d lie to you and pay you a compliment that I didn’t mean?”
Sherlock gave him a long, searching look before leaning down to press a chaste kiss to his cheek.
“You seem far too excited about this,” said John.
“Sherlock,” said John but Sherlock was straightening the stationery supplies on the desk.  “Sherlock,” said John a little louder.  “I’m sure I’ll be fine.”
“You could come with me,” said Sherlock, looking down into John’s eyes.  The Christmas lights from the castle reflected in Sherlock's eyes, adding tiny golden sparks to the blue.
Sherlock stepped through another web of police tape and into the room.
John went into his room and saw a beautiful suit laid out on his bed.  The jacket and trousers were cut perfectly for him and there were even cuff links with his initials on them, laid out in a little box next to the jacket.  Again, John wondered how Sherlock could have gotten a suit with his exact measurements made in such little time.
“You should use it,” said Violet, taking the mug and filling it with coffee before handing it back to Mycroft.
“Yes, yes,” said Sherlock, waving a hand over his shoulder.
“Go on and take this cab then,” said John. “And I suppose I’ll call for another one.”
When Sherlock seemed to have calmed down a bit, John finally allowed himself to ask the question that was on the tip of his tongue.  “Why, if you don’t trust any of them, have you decided to trust me?”
Mycroft quickly pointed to someone in the second row.
The cab slowed and stopped in front of a building at the edge of the village.  It was an old house, that seemed to be abandoned.  Or it may just have been that it was a bit more shabby than the other houses in the neighborhood and not completely covered in Christmas lights and decorations.
“I’ll walk with you,” said Sherlock.
The prince handed John his phone.  “You’re alone in a foreign country and the family is hosting an informal gathering tonight.  They are dreadfully dull, but I imagine better than the hotel room service you plan to order tonight.”  He was moving around the large kitchen now, pulling on a long, black coat and wrapping a blue scarf, that seemed to have been handpicked to bring out his eyes, around his neck.
“Good.  That’s good.”
“My aunt was fine,” said John, after the scrutiny because too much.  “She’s still around, back home in England.”
“Evening,” he said, his voice as hard as iron, face like a stone.
“Go down to the sitting room as soon as you’re ready,” Sherlock was saying as he looked around the room for his left shoe.  “Don’t wait for me.  Mycroft is already suspicious enough of us as it is.  We don’t need to do any thing else to draw his attention.”
“Oh, God yes,” said John. “I mean, sorry.  I mean, yes.  That was fantastic.”
“Do give her my apologies, Angelo,” said Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
It seemed he had been standing near his brother, but he was already making his way across the room and through the dancers to John.
A gasp erupted from the crowd and then there was absolute silence.  No one moved.  John didn’t think anyone even breathed.  He certainly didn’t.  His heart started pounding as though he’d run up five flights of stairs and he suddenly felt sick to his stomach.
“Sorry?” asked John again, realizing that was the third time he’d said that in the last thirty seconds.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure,” said John, handing over the phone without really thinking about it.
“Sorry to bother you,” said John.  “I’ll just go.”
“I hope that wasn’t any one important.”
“But you were right.”
Here is something fun for Christmas Day!
John looked around the room and then followed Sherlock.  They wound through the back passages and stairways of the palace until they emerged in the families private quarters.  Sherlock continued tearing through corridors with John on his heels until he arrived a large oak door.  He quickly unlocked it and threw it open.
“A specific family that happens to rule the country.”
A few minutes later, Sherlock returned.  “Come on,” he said. He retrieved his glass and put a hand on John’s elbow.  He led him through the room towards the dancing.  They passed Lestrade in the crowd and Sherlock slowed down.
“Surely an army man can tough it out for one night in the palace,” said Sherlock, raising an eyebrow.
“You don’t seem very happy about it,” John replied.  Sherlock seemed to be ignoring Mycroft and John was all too happy to play along.
“You could have thought of something else,” said John.  “Anything else.”
“No,” said Sherlock.  “Sometimes a bit of research is just as good as a deduction.  Did I get anything wrong earlier by the way?”
“No, really,” said John.  There was something off about Sherlock’s demeanour and combined with the sadness of the song he’d just been playing, John suddenly was desperate to make Sherlock know that John was giving him a serious compliment and not just being flippant.  “That was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I’ve ever heard.”
He slid on to the back of the snowmobile.  Sherlock reached a hand around to grab John’s wrist and pull his arm around Sherlock’s chest.  “Hold on,” he called over the sound of the engine and that was all the warning John got before they were off, tearing through the snow.
He gave Violet and Matilda their gifts first.  He’d found stall selling hand knitted mittens with incredibly intricate designs of snowflakes, mountains, reindeer and trees.  He gave a red and white pair to Violet and a green and white pair to Matilda.
Sherlock blinked at him confused.  “Why would I do that?”
John opened and closed his mouth a few times. “Well done you for reading my mind,” he finally said.  Sherlock began to frown.  “That would be lovely,” said John, hoping to wipe the forlorn expression off his face. “But I really should go get a few things from the hotel.”
John dress quickly and made his way to the sitting room.  Violet, Mycroft, and his wife were already seated around a low table covered in Christmas presents.  Coffee and tea and an already picked over tray of cinnamon rolls were on a table.
“The one you wore the other day didn’t really seem warm enough for trapsing around the snow,” said John.
Sherlock seethed silently for a few moments.
“Thanks,” said John.  “It’s all down to you though.  This suit is absolutely perfect.  I should pay you back.”
Welcome to the last chapter.  I hope you like it!
John actually felt his knees go a little watery.  “You do too,” he said.
“Your defense of Sherlock in this manner shows that you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about either,” said Simon through an icy grin.  “You should take a bit of your own advice.”
Happy New Years everyone but to John and Sherlock most of all!
John pulled off his clothes and crawled under the covers.  The last thing he saw before he closed his eyes was a poster of the period table of elements hanging on the wall.
“Yes, I know,” said Sherlock harshly.  “It’s just that the constant fawning is so tedious.”
Mycroft glanced up from his phone at Sherlock’s entrance and raised an eyebrow at him meaningfully.
“Yet since you met him, you have been in his company almost constantly and you’ve already found your way into the palace.”
“I’m sorry, John,” said Sherlock.  “The crown calls.”
He arrived back at the palace in the late afternoon, just behind a posh red sports cart.  The driver of the car had a strong resemblance to Sherlock, both with the dark hair and the lanky stature though John thought Sherlock was probably just a bit taller.  The man got out of the car and flipped the keys to one of the footmen by the door.  John watched as one of the footmen went to the boot to take out a suitcase and garment bag and the other went to the driver’s side to drive the car away.
“Come in,” said Sherlock, stepping around John and unlocking the door.
“She sounds like a spirited lady.”
John followed behind Sherlock as he ran through the back streets of the village.  They crashed through gardens and over walls.  They climbed up a snowbank and on to the roofs, running along the high street, the Christmas lights flashing as they ran past.  They ducked through a trap door and in to a theatre where there was a production of the Nutcracker in progress.  They ran through the back stage and out a side door.  Across the street and through a Christmas market and John nearly ran in to Sherlock as he careened in to the front of the cab.
“Wife,” said Sherlock.
John shook his head.  “Madman,” he said under his breath.  But he was grinning.
Despite the terse, business like language of the note, John found himself running his thumb over Sherlock’s signature.  He tucked the card in to a pocket of his suitcase before pulling out a navy jumper. It was just from some high street shop, a gift from Harry years ago, but he’d barely worn it so there were no pills or holes.  It would certainly look terribly gauche next to the rest of the party goers but John hoped at least that he wouldn’t be actively laughed out of the room.
Sherlock gave him a small smile.  “Good.”
John nodded and he could feel his throat muscles working as he swallowed down the knot in his throat.
“I can’t imagine what that would have been like.”
John looked at Sherlock and the thunder cloud brewing in his eyes.  “It’s perfect,” he said quickly.  “Thank you.”
“Obviously,” said Sherlock.
When he heard footsteps coming down the hall, it must have been hours later because the sky outside the windows was dark.  John leapt to his feet, swaying slightly on his stiff legs.  Sherlock came sweeping around the corner and then stopped dead when he saw John.
“Yes,” said Sherlock, cutting her off.  “A table for two.  That one is fine.”  He stalked off across the pub to an empty table by the front window with John and the flustered waitress trailing behind.  Sherlock took his seat and John sat as well.
“Yes,” said John.  Sherlock leapt up from his kneeling position and he wrapped his arms around John.  The crowd around the erupted in to cheers.  “I needed a distraction,” whispered Sherlock in John’s ear.  “You played a long brilliantly.  Just keep it up.”  Then he leaned back, wrapped his long-fingered hands around the back of John’s head and kissed him.
John followed behind Sherlock for another ten minutes.  They crested the top of a hill and, at the base of the hill on the other side, was a cabin.  Well, it was built like a cabin but in reality, could have house four medium sized families comfortably.
The next time John woke, sun was pouring through the windows, nearly blinded him.  The snowstorm of the previous few days left everything covered in sparkling white which seemed to be magnifying the light coming in through the window.
“Sorry?”
Those words knocked John off the cloud he’d been floating on since last night and he came crashing back down to earth.  Of course, it was a one time thing.  Of course, Sherlock wasn’t looking for anything more than a casual fling with John. And even if he were, of course, the Prince of Aldovia couldn’t go getting involved with just anyone.
Sherlock was smiling again, and the expression filled John’s chest with warm like he’d taken a sip of good whiskey. “Good, good.  I’ll make sure to let Mrs Hudson and mummy know you’ll be staying.
“We could take a horse drawn sleigh, but the snowmobile is much quicker.”
John ducked through the tape and was momentarily frozen when he saw the dead body laying on the floor.  Yes, it was true that he’d seen his fair share of dead bodies but they always came as a shock, especially, when he wasn’t particularly expecting it.  He’d never been to a crime scene before, unless you counted the scenes of the atrocities of war that he’d helped clean up after.  He’d thought they took the body away before inspecting the room for clues, leaving behind only a neat chalk outline.
“That was because of the snow.  You don’t think I made it snow to- What? Take advantage of Sherlock?  Steal from the palace?”  John found himself getting really, truly angry.
“You don’t think he’ll come, do you?”
“So, you see, Prime Minster Lecoq, the country needs to invest in infrastructure and public programs.  It will provide us with more jobs which will in turn, allow for more workers to frequent stores and restaurants which will in turn yield more jobs."
Back in his room, he flipped on the tele and waited until he heard the Aldovian National Anthem play, announcing the start of the address.
“Yes, we knew that already,” said Sherlock.
When they arrived, the gathering was in full swing and seemed to have been going for a while.  There were at least thirty people gathered in the large room.  As soon as they entered the room, Sherlock snagged two glasses of champagne and made his way to a far corner, glaring at people as he went.  To those who went so far as to actually greet him, he bit out a snarled “Hello,” before brushing past him.
Then he leaned in to press a slow kiss to John’s lips before pulling him to the bed.
John felt a current of anger passing between the brothers that he didn’t really understand.  He resisted the urge to duck in case they started hurling actual lightning bolts at each other.
He scanned the crowd and saw Matilda talking animatedly to Violet.  Mycroft was in a prominent position on the other side of the room, saying hello to an endless stream of guests.  Then he saw Sherlock.
“Oh, I don’t want to impose,” said John.
“Go back to sleep, John” said Sherlock after a few minutes.  His voice was a velvety whisper than wrapped around John more thoroughly than the silence had.  “It’s still dark.  You can relax.”  Sherlock slid his hand up to John’s back, rubbing up and down his spine before pulling him in tight so their bodies were nearly flushed together.  Then he let go and curled in as tightly as he could to John.
“Because of you, the police knew to take that call seriously and investigate.  Because of you, a serial killer is in custody.  You’ve saved at least one person’s life.  Probably more.  Think about it.  That is one family that will be celebrating Christmas together instead of mourning a lost life and that’s down to you.”  John realized he was rubbing his thumb along the side of Sherlock’s kneecap and up to where bone met taught muscle. He pulled his hand back.
“Yes,” said Sherlock. “Now, if you’ll excuse us-“
“Pardon?” asked John, mystified again.
“This,” John pointed between the two of them, waving a finger in the negative space.  “This doesn’t have to end.  You are the one ending it.”
“It was nothing,” said Sherlock.
“It’s my father’s hunting lodge,” said Sherlock.  “Nobody really comes out here anymore though.
“Of course not,” said Mycroft who was standing in the doorway, having just entered the room.  He closed the door softly behind him.  “This man is Martin Tregennis.  Sherlock assisted in the arrest of his brother, Mortimer, several years ago.  Mortimer was accused of killing his fiancé if I remember correctly.”
Matilda seemed about to speak but Mycroft cut her off.  “So lovely to see you again, John.  Sherlock’s been showing you the grounds, then?  And the hunting lodge.  So good of you to go out there and check on it periodically.”
Mrs. Hudson leaned in a bit a lowered her voice.  “Between you a me,” she said. “I’m so glad to see Sherlock with someone.  He really is such a sweet boy, but he has this terrible habit of pushing people away.  We were beginning to despair of him.”
John felt an odd feeling of displacement as he saw the building that he was currently sitting in, and the people he’d exchanged Christmas presents with, live on television.  Mycroft was at the front of the group behind a podium, bearing the Aldovian seal.  Sherlock, Violet and Matilda stood behind him.
“Such an odd one,” John heard a woman in a slinky red dress saying.  “Especially when we were younger.  He was always so quiet but then he’d come out with the most preposterous things all of a sudden.  Accusing people of stealing or having affairs or cheating on tests.”
The Prince took a step closer to John, holding out his phone to him but not yet giving it back.  “Come to dinner with me,” he said, his deep voice resonating in John’s chest.
“Merry Christmas,” said Sherlock.  “You look nice.”  He took John’s hand, twisting it slightly to look at the cuff links.  Then he gave it a slight squeeze before letting it go.
PS I would have had this up last night but apparently Ao3 broke last night so I couldn't post it.  So, chapter in the morning and chapter in the evening so I can finish this fic by the end of the 12 Days of Christmas like I said!
John waited for a long moment, his hands-on Sherlock’s shoulders, firm but steady and waiting.  Eventually, Sherlock looked down at him.  “Alright?” asked John.
Light glowed from the upstairs window and standing just in front of the window was the figures of Sherlock and himself, standing close together as though they were talkin.
The onslaught was immediate.  People rushed forward with shining, happy faces wanting to shake his and Sherlock’s hands.  Sherlock had a wide smile plastered on his face.  He wrapped an arm around John’s shoulders and pulled him tight to his side.  Sherlock seemed to be the one stable point in the mass of humanity around them, so John leaned in to his side, grateful for the support though he was more than a little angry and confused by the whole situation.
“You’ve a psychosomatic limp.  Of course, you’ve got a therapist.  Then there’s your brother.  Your phone is expensive, a new model.  Scratches.  Not one, but many over time.  It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins, but you keep it in your back pocket where there’s nothing to cause these scratches.  A gift then.  The next bits easy, you know it already.”
“For what?” asked John and he was suddenly extremely aware of the very small amount of space between them.  His brain started, unhelpfully, calculating how far he would have to move and the angle he would have to tilt to press his lips to Sherlocks.
They both stopped talking again.  John hadn’t known what he’d been about to say except he couldn’t stop hearing Mycroft say Sherlock didn’t want to pursue any kind of relationship with him.  “Go ahead,” he said.
“Yeah, alright,” said Lestrade as he disappeared back out into the hall.
“As I said, Mrs. Hudson can’t be stopped when she sets her mind to something,” said Sherlock.  “Take a seat and warm up by the fire.” He pointed to the chair to the left of the fire.  It was a low squashy, red chair with a tartan blanket thrown across the back.  John settled into it and was struck by how comfortable it was.
“Sherlock,” said John.  “It’s 9:15.”
“It’s ok,” said Sherlock, more softly.  “Give him the champagne.”  John handed over his champagne flute and then, suddenly Sherlock grabbed hold of him and whisked him out on to the dance floor.  Sherlock quickly arranged John’s hand on his shoulder when he grappled for placement, and then put his hand on John’s waist.  And then they were spinning around the dance floor in a perfect waltz.  John was too stunned to know what to do but Sherlock was leading him expertly through the steps, his hands firmly guiding him in the right direction.
“It does though,” said Sherlock.  His voice was quiet when John’s was loud and the difference was infuriating John further.
“Of course it was.  It was extraordinary.  It was quite extraordinary.”
“Sure,” said John.  “Dinner.”
John almost looked over his shoulder, wondering who Sherlock could be talking to.  He caught himself just in time to keep from looking like a complete idiot.  He approached the woman on the other side, kneeling down next to her.  He had to push his stiff leg into a bent position to get close enough to see anything useful.  He hoped Sherlock hadn’t noticed but Sherlock seemed intent on investigating the woman's pockets so probably had missed it.
“Is this our man, Lestrade?” asked Sherlock.
“Afghanistan, actually.  Sorry,” John cringed.  “How did you know that?”
“Sherlock,” said John again, insistently. “That’s all you and I love you.” The words were out before John realized they were coming but he found he didn’t want to take them back. Sherlock went completely still again, looking over John’s head with the same odd, wide eyed expression.  He slowly released John’s hand and wound his hand around John’s back to clutch at his shirt, holding him still.
“Monitor skips, back alleys, anywhere someone could dispose of a bright pink suitcase.  As soon as the murder realizes he has the case, he’ll be looking to get rid of it.  It would be consipicous for a man to be pulling a suitcase like that about.”
“This one seemed like one of the interesting ones, but he confessed as soon as they caught him,” said Sherlock.
John woke feeling well rested.  He’d actually had pleasant dreams, which was a rare enough occurrence, that he spent a few minutes laying in the warm bed, trying to remember what they were.  The only thing he could grasp was following Sherlock as they ran down a tunnel of Christmas lights.  John thought they might have been chasing Santa but he wasn’t sure if it was so they could get presents or if it was because Santa had stolen the presents.
“I can’t say the issue has come up before,” replied the king.
“Royal Highness,” said Sherlock.  “But after the first address, no honorific is needed.”
John took a deep breath.  Just a body.  Nothing he hadn’t dealt with before.  Sherlock was already kneeling on the floor next to the dead woman and John took a step closer.  He watched Sherlock for several silent minutes as he inspected the woman, even going so far as to pull out a tiny magnifying glass out and inspect her jewelry with it.
“He just got a text from someone who could only be the woman he just killed.  It might just be intriguing enough to draw him out.”
“How can you possibly know how big her non-existent suitcase is?”
He took a detour in to the village on the way back to the palace to pick up a few Christmas presents.  He had no idea what to get the kings and queens and princes for Christmas, but he felt like he should have something.
