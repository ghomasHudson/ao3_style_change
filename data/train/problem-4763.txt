“MJ?” He was happy that it was a familiar face, but he also had no idea what she was doing here. Or how she knew where he lived.
Just like Mr. Stark was always determined to keep him safe back home, Sam and Bucky were trying to protect him here, too.
“It depends on when you show up,” Tony said in response to his earlier question. “As often as possible, if it were up to me. We need to know that your powers aren’t changing or doing anything weird to your body.”
As Nebula told her sordid tale, Tony started shifting uncomfortably beside Steve. At first, Steve chalked it up to lingering trauma, but he glanced over to find an all-too-familiar expression on Tony’s face: He had clearly stopped listening to the story a while ago, his gaze distant. Steve could practically hear gears whirring in his head. It warmed his heart a bit to see Tony back to his normal self, even just for a moment.
“Thank me later. We need to get out of here.” MJ grabbed his arm and insistently tugged him toward the stairs. They were almost to the door when they heard someone cry out, “Hey, wait! Help!” They both turned to see Flash on the far side of the room, cowering behind a chair that was doing very little to protect him from an oncoming spider.
“Tony doesn’t trust anybody,” MJ pointed out, “except Pepper. And his friend Rhodey that he talks about sometimes.”
“They won’t find us,” said Osborn confidently, in a way that sent chills down Peter’s spine. “It’s too risky to move him, anyway. They’re more likely to see you if you move him. Just stay put and do as I say. I’ll be back in an hour.” With that, the door slammed shut, leaving Peter alone with his two bodyguards.
His hands were shaking. Breathe in, breathe out. The ashes kept slipping away into the air, further and further out of reach.
“Peter was with him,” said Bruce. An ominous silence followed this statement. They had no way to contact either of them. They were only two team members, but they desperately needed them.
His fingers drummed on the steering wheel as his anxiety about Steve started to return. What if Steve was just going to publish the story when his editor promised him a raise; what if Tony’s threats meant nothing to him? What if Tony had just pissed him off and now Steve was going to publish the story on Peter as revenge?
Tony expected her to be angry. He was not expecting to find Peter’s aunt standing in the lobby pacing back and forth, or for her to look so relieved when she saw him.
He found himself face-to-face with Tony, holding Steve’s forgotten jacket. His expression was blank, unreadable, dangerous. He hung up on Coulson without listening to his reply, and ignored his phone when it started buzzing again. He didn’t dare let his gaze waver from Tony’s in that moment. It was clear that he had heard everything. And it sounded bad.
okay?” Peter’s tone was impatient enough that Tony could already see this conversation was going downhill fast. “I knew what the consequences could be when I decided to do this. No one else is going to find out. Steve wouldn’t -”
Peter hugged May first, and she held him so tight it looked like it hurt. There were more than a few tears as May half-heartedly scolded him for not telling her, and then pulled him in for another hug.
He leaned further over the balcony railing. Below, the intern girl was now at the front desk, looking much more calm and collected than when she first arrived. The person she was talking to appeared to be a businessman and even from seven floors up, Tony could tell the guy was an asshole. However, the intern - Kelly? Katie? Something like that - kept a pleasant expression while she explained something to him. Tony was still watching the exchange when a ding behind him signaled that someone had arrived on this floor.
All of them gathered together again to hear Loki’s idea. Strange, T’Challa, and the Guardians once again drifted back toward them, still looking ethereal in the endless mist.
“It appears that the snowstorm interfered with the signal, sir. Playback starting now.” The low voice started talking again.
But Tony was insistent, as Steve had suspected he would be. “Come on. I know your resume. Tell me more.” He nudged Steve with his shoulder, leaning back against the bar now, looking out at the crowd. “I’m curious.” He took a sip of his drink. He was well on his way to drunk, but Steve didn’t doubt his ability to recount every detail of this conversation if he accidentally let something slip.
Well, Steve amended in his head, he was a little like Howard. For one thing, Tony looked like Howard’s son. Steve had already known that from his file, but seeing him in person gave him a strange sort of deja vu, especially because they found him in a lab. It was a lab unlike any Steve had seen before, but he wasn’t exactly a scientist, so he couldn’t say for sure if Stark Industries had top-of-the-line equipment or if it was just what modern science looked like. The stubbornness, too, reminded him of Howard.
, but also holding a notebook and a camera and looking distinctly like a reporter. Exactly the kind of person who needed to stay as far away from Peter as physically possible.
Tony opened his eyes to find her looking back at him helplessly, tears in her eyes. She crossed her arms over her chest and said, “I told myself he would be home by morning and he wasn’t. Now I get a call from the school telling me he’s not there.” She sniffed loudly, looking away. “I don’t know. Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe he’s with Ned. I should give Ned’s mom a call -”
Steve had been oddly quiet since Peter walked in; there was no exclamation of surprise or demand for answers. It was too late to make excuses and there was nothing Tony could say to convince Steve that Peter wasn’t Spider-Man. So. There was nothing he could do to stop this evening from being a complete and utter disaster. Earlier, Tony had just wanted to close the distance between them; now, the space felt cold and endless.
Eventually, they worked out a sort-of schedule: Peter spent the morning helping Bruce in his lab, doing boring intern things like cleaning lab equipment and recording data in Excel. In the afternoon, he joined Tony in his workshop to observe whatever project Tony happened to be working on. It gave him a glimpse into Tony Stark's brain, which meant the afternoons were chaotic and sometimes involved explosions. On any given day, Tony could be working on anything from the Iron Man suit to the computer code that created JARVIS. It wasn't exactly a comprehensive education since most of the calculations happened in Tony's head, but Peter always seemed fascinated anyway.
Tony was covered in dirt, dust, and ash, the same way everyone here had looked just after the battle. He had a cut on his forehead that looked bad, crusted over with blood; he had scrapes and bruises all over. And Nebula hadn’t been kidding: there was a horrible blood stain on Tony’s right side, enough red to make Steve’s stomach lurch, to make him think they were too late, but somehow it had stopped bleeding. The wound was fixed, but Tony wasn’t - he’d lost blood, he was probably fatigued and dehydrated from battle like everybody else, and his minor injuries were adding up.
Peter had been about to try moving, but instead he froze. The sound of muffled shouting reached his ears. It seemed to be coming from below him. He put his head to the ground and tried to focus, using his powers to concentrate on their individual voices.
Peter was still in his Spider-Man suit, but the sleeve had been partly burned off. Due to Tony’s recent upgrades, it had dissolved instead of melting into Peter’s skin. He was lucky it hadn’t been worse.
Finally, slowly, after a long beat of silence, Peter tugged the black ski mask off. Even though Tony knew it was him all along, it still came as a shock to see him standing there, looking so young and vulnerable in this dark alleyway in the middle of the night.
“Bucky,” said the man. That made more sense. Peter saw a glint of silver and noticed his metal arm. Definitely not Jesus. The real arm was the one that reached out to help Peter stand up.
Steve shook his head, trying to stick as close to the truth as possible. “We… left each other on good terms. After the Army, things changed.” Technically, that was very true.
Steve looked properly chastised, but he kept Tony’s gaze determinedly. “I understand,” he said sincerely, and when Tony didn’t look convinced, he added, “Tony. I would
“It’s just me,” he said automatically, before realizing that maybe it wasn’t comforting for Tony to wake up to him anymore. He felt his face flush. What if Tony just wanted him to leave? “You were shouting,” he added softly. “I’m sorry to wake you, but it seemed like you were having a nightmare.”
A small smile appeared on Natasha’s lips. “It’s Stark, isn’t it?” She shook her head. “What did he do this time?”
Tony was equally baffled. “Uh, no. I have a billion dollars and an entire workshop of my own. I don’t need to borrow your stuff.”
The lights above him were soft, and for a few seconds he was tempted to drift off again, to enjoy sleeping in. Except he wasn’t in his bed. The thought ignited a spark in Peter’s brain and his eyes flew open, heart racing, only to find himself face-to-face with a long-haired, handsome man.
Somehow, Tony wasn’t willing to believe that Peter would do that to them without a good reason. Maybe it was wishful thinking given the evidence, but, “I told you, I think something’s going on with him,” he said to Bruce. “Let me talk to him.”
At floor twelve, he heard the distinctive sound of repulsors. The relief he felt was overwhelming. Iron Man. Tony. He would help them. The sound of repulsor blasts - picking off the spiders one by one, Peter guessed - followed him up the stairs until he finally, finally reached floor fourteen. The relief faded when he saw that the door was halfway off its hinges.
“I - okay.” Steve’s baby blue-eyed gaze was clearer than it had been before, and Tony could practically see his mind racing with this new information. He got the sense that Steve wanted to say something else, but was holding back.
They drifted off into groups, and again, Peter felt like some of them faded away more than others. It was as if they were present, yet unreachable. He found himself talking to Bucky, Sam, and Wanda. He had a million questions, and they gave few answers.
Before, at first, Steve often succumbed to Tony’s incessant taunting and snapped back, the two of them bickering like an old married couple. And that initial spark turned into an uncontrollable fire, because even though Tony Stark infuriated him to no end when they were together, Steve suddenly found himself missing his voice when they were apart. They started spending more time together. They discovered that they were more alike than they thought initially: both stubborn, both proud, both lost and struggling without saying it to anyone.
“Everything’s fine,” Peter had mumbled into her shoulder. “Just a long day.” He did sound tired, but she wasn’t convinced. He pulled back to pick up his bag and head for his room. “I’ve got a lot of homework so I’d better get started.”
sure he won’t mind seeing you in a suit.” And with that, Pepper left Steve blushing in the lobby of Stark Industries, invitation in hand.
As Sam and Bucky faded into the foggy, featureless distance, Peter did as he was told, even though he knew Bucky was just trying to distract him. It was incredibly frustrating that even here, in existential limbo, the adults didn’t want his help.
“Really, because that’s what it fucking sounded like, Steve. It sounded like you were about to sell Peter out thirty seconds after finding out his secret.”
Looking back, that was around the time Tony should have started to get suspicious. Peter had just dsicovered his newfound powers, and it was easiest to handle them in high-adrenaline situations. The combination of those two facts couldn’t possibly end well. But Tony was too wrapped up in his own thoughts to notice when things started to change. He was busy trying to sue Oscorp for setting radioactive spiders on his kids (“they’re not your actual children,” Pepper reminded him), making plans for underground transportation to show up Oscorp’s stupid flying car, and monitoring Peter’s health. He was so caught up that he completely missed the obvious signs that Peter had taken things into his own hands.
“I'll take that as a yes." He rolled his eyes. “Alright, we’re bringing the suits," Tony decided. "I have to have cooler tech than him. I mean, it won't be difficult since he’ll probably just try to convince everyone that he invented the wheel, but -”
Tony honestly didn’t know. It did seem out of character for Peter to sneak around and steal their lab equipment, but he
sent his thoughts racing. He knew that Howard hadn’t exactly been a great parent, and that he and his wife had died young. He hadn’t thought about how it affected Tony’s life. And it sounded like this former CEO took a toll on Tony as well. Steve was actually desperately curious to know more.
It was Captain America’s uniform, but as the hero helped Peter to his feet, he noticed that he looked awfully familiar.
It struck Steve how their situations were equal and opposite: One family gone, one still mostly intact; four living, four dead. Thanos’ idea of mercy. It was so horribly cruel, so unspeakably unfair that Steve once again found himself on autopilot.
It sounded like an impossible problem, but wasn’t that why the Avengers existed? It was quickly agreed upon that Shuri, Banner, and Tony - their top minds - would work on finding a way to discover the Soul World while Thor, Rocket, and Valkyrie searched the skies for Thanos. Steve was left in a sort of awkward supervisory role, continuing to communicate with Clint and Natasha in New York while keeping an eye on everyone in Wakanda.
Tony was already leaning on the table for support, the hand clutching his phone shaking slightly as he dropped it to the table with a loud clatter. His horrified expression was mirrored by both Pepper and May. And on top of that, he was just as confused as he had been before the call.
Tony dealt with their new reality like he dealt with a lot of things: by completely ignoring it until he couldn’t anymore. He kept his head down, avoided Steve for the next few days, and did his best to help everybody else: He helped Shuri invent entirely new weapons, untested, anything they could use on Thanos; he helped Okoye organize the remainder of the troops; he helped Nebula fix an injury in her wiring.
MJ was looking at him suspiciously, like she wasn’t sure whether or not she was in the right place, when she sighed, the action shifting her curly hair out of her face. “Peter’s missing,” she said abruptly, “and so is Spider-Man.”
“I saw that Anthony would be instrumental in returning the universe to its previous state,” said Strange, which didn’t actually answer Peter’s question. “He and Steven Rogers are imperative to this outcome.”
Thor called her Valkyrie. She was a soldier of sorts, apparently. She ran into Thor’s arms as soon as she saw him, as relieved as he was to see a familiar face amid the destruction. She brought news from outside the galaxy. “It’s the same, everywhere,” she told them in hushed tones. “I left the Asgardians to help on Namir. We got word that Earth was impacted, and last I heard, that was where you were headed,” she nodded to Thor. “So I came here to see for myself whether you were alive.”
“I couldn’t die because of the experiments they did on me. I’ve been unconscious a lot. Sometimes I would black out and then wake up as the Winter Soldier, or as myself.” He frowned. “Death was not an option for a long time. And I don’t think this is it, either.”
Maybe if he was younger, Tony would have been more excited about it. After all, he had once been notorious for drinking and flirting shamelessly throughout the night, ignoring the cameras and boasting the next morning that the trashy pictures of him only proved that he’d had the most fun. People had laughed. Looking back, though, it just seemed kind of sad. Tony’s partying habits had been fueled partly by arrogance, mostly by low self-esteem and a lingering need to prove himself, to show off, that had never quite faded from his childhood.
Natasha was nodding. She thought like Steve. The world made slightly more sense when there was a plan, a purpose, a mission to be accomplished. “And you? Will you stay here?”
Steve breathed a sigh of relief as soon as he and Tony went their separate ways. Aside from the surprise paparazzi – which, he realized now, would mean that Fury would find out about this -  their afternoon together had been nice.
“Are you suspicious of everyone?” Steve started to ask, and then his gaze followed Tony’s to a man with sunglasses on and a large camera aimed at them. He was actually trying to hide behind a shrub and failing completely. “We should go,” he said, turning toward Tony so that his body would at least partly obscure the man’s line of sight.
“Yeah, Pepper’s great. But Tony isn’t so bad, either,” Nat said. “Give it time. He gets lost in his own head sometimes. That’s what fuels the paranoia. Let Pepper and Bruce and Rhodey convince him that you’re not dangerous.”
He heard one of the thugs say, “What the -” followed by a loud metallic clang echoing around the room. Peter opened his eyes to see a man in red, white, and blue standing over him, the two bad guys knocked out on the ground.
He answered honestly, “I have no idea.” There wasn’t time to figure it out just now, either. He stepped away from her. “JARVIS, I want to know every place Norman Osborne has been in the last year, every building and every warehouse he’s used, every place he has set foot in, even for a minute. Sort in order of distance from Peter’s apartment and we’ll go from there.”
“Hey! I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” the teenager said before the doors had even closed behind him. “What are you doing on this floor? There’s nothing cool on this floor. Honestly, I’m surprised you’re even awake. Everyone I talked to said you would be asleep or working but when I checked your workshop you weren’t there, so I asked JARVIS and he told me you were here. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about my new suit,” said Peter finally, excitement bright in his gaze. It was a wonder that he wasn’t out of breath from saying so many words so quickly, Tony thought.
It was strange to shift his focus back to the present, suddenly. Sometimes Steve had moments like that: He would get lost in thought about the past, thinking of Peggy or Bucky and what they would say if they were here. He had to forcibly snap himself out of it. It happened a lot while he was sketching. If he let himself think about it too much, then he would look up from his notebook to be genuinely surprised that there wasn’t currently a war going on.
“I will not be paying the ransom,” said Tony, loud and clear. “I will not be threatened by people who would do something as low as kidnapping a child. You heard me: A child. Spider-Man is sixteen years old. He gained his powers after an accident involving radioactive spiders at MIT earlier this year. The accident could have killed him, but it gave him powers instead. This kidnapping and the ransom demand are an attempt to cover up that story. Oscorp created Spider-Man that day. And Oscorp has him now. They’re trying to use this as an opportunity to pin the blame on me.”
The only one who seemed entirely on board with the plan was Rocket, who immediately volunteered to be Thor’s tour guide in space again since he had so many connections. Valkyrie had little to say to any of them, but they assumed she was going along with Thor’s plan because she seemed to be busy packing her spaceship. (Tony did catch her one night in the kitchen drinking straight out of a bottle of vodka, though, so he knew they weren’t the only ones with doubts about the plan.)
“I get it, Tony,” said Steve, his voice earnest as he reached for his jacket. “I get it. I’m not going to tell anyone. You have my word on that.” He looked like he wanted to say something else, but he just shook his head. “Good night, Tony.”
“It was a long time ago,” Steve said honestly, “and it’s not something I usually bring up the first time I meet someone.”
“Really?” Tony asked, pulling one of said test tubes from his pocket. It was full of some blue-ish liquid. “Because I found this in your room.”
Peter could hear MJ yelling at someone, but he couldn't quite make out the words. They kept fading in and out like he was underwater and when he blinked, everything went fuzzy, red and yellow and the weird green color of spider goo.
It was there, in the elevator, it occurred to Tony that he didn’t want this to be a one-night stand. Tonight was different. It felt different. He wasn’t going to forget Steve’s name in the morning, because Steve had already stuck around much longer than originally expected. No, he was going to remember his name, and the hands gripping his waist, and the lips on his neck. And the way they both laughed breathlessly when the elevator doors opened on Tony’s floor, realizing that they looked ridiculously disheveled.
She tried to convince herself that Peter wasn’t in danger. He was probably with his friends. Or something. She couldn’t even think of a reason for him to have snuck out on his own, in the dark, in New York City, at nearly midnight.
May continued, “I knocked a few times and then I opened his door. He was just gone. The window was open.” Tony closed his eyes. He wanted to comfort her, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Not when he was about to make everything ten times worse by telling the truth. Her emotion was starting to leak into her voice. “He’s only snuck out once before that I know of, he - he told me he was at Ned’s, but now I just don’t know what to think -”
because they couldn’t get ahold of Tony’s actual designs for any of it. Steve felt strangely proud of Tony for successfully keeping secrets from SHIELD. Most people assumed that Captain America would be a rule follower, but he knew better than most that it was sometimes better to keep certain information out of powerful hands.
Peter swallowed that statement with a certain amount of discomfort. He realized that Loki was probably right.
Now, he realized he’d made a mistake in skipping the rest. He found himself glued to the description of Tony’s early life:
Tony refused to accept that he was being set up by a teenager right now. “And that’s why no one asked you,” he told Peter.
" . . . Gawrych?" Steve says, and it all snaps into place, with painful obviousness. "Gawrych hired Sin."
"Oh good, this will be much faster with you here," greets Reed. "Tell me, do you think your program failed accidentally, or was that intentional?"
There's whole acres of wide, empty farmland near Albany, land that would take an hour get to, were they not in the presence of Norse Gods
"Come on, Hank, I'm sure Cap had that," Cassie Lang, thirty feet tall and leaning over another building, says with a smile. "You were just about to dazzle us, right?"
"I, ah. I told you yesterday about Sin - we found her, and Crossbones." The easy part, obviously. Where Sin goes, a grossly high mortality rate is sure to follow, which isn't exactly inconspicuous. Catching and restraining her, however, can be tricky.
If he were to redo the paintings today, they would've all been in separate action poses, ones that fit their powers and styles, fluid and moving rather than awkwardly gang- pressed into the same fists-on-hips, Bold Hero position. Miss America would've been in the air, and the emphasis would've been on those eyes. Smiling wide and proud.
Steve curses silently, reaching after him as much as he can while keeping one hand on the wheel. Tony's managed to grab onto the now-open car door, and dangles about three hundred feet above the city.
"I read as much in the Bugle," Tony says. "You're not about to tell me I don't have more clearance than J. Jonah Jameson."
Rhodes nods. "Hold on." Planting his feet, he grows eerily, perfectly still, the gold glow of War Machine's eye slots dimming. Now that he knows, Steve can hear the difference. War Machine's armor is similar, but it's a bit louder, an actual whir, which quiets as well.
Tony smirks at him from over the bundles of wires, cannibalized alarm clock and GPS system. Steve's reminded of fourth grade science, Miss Kane turning off the lights, closing the windows and using nothing but a wire and a lemon to light up her desk. It had seemed like magic. He'd had such a crush on her.
"Gawrych is still in there," says West. "Five of our men are with him, they secured the basement. A few injuries but nothing serious on our side. A few fatalities on their side – hard to keep track. They swarmed, Cap, too fast to pull Gawrych out."
Tony spreads his legs the moment he's set down, and Steve wasn't the only one who'd enjoyed the earlier performance. He pulls Steve between his thighs, and half smiles, fingering the mask.  "It's so different."
He goes to the window, not sure what to expect; a slow moving car with ridiculously loud bass? He reaches the slightly vibrating glass panes just in time to see Bill Foster.
Tony's eyes are round, and his hands grip Steve's arms like he's trying to brace himself, despite laying flat on the gravelly roof of the Hilton – obviously still reeling. "Did you grab the Sodomizer?"
Tony nods. There's a long silence, save the clinks and shifts from Tony and his project, eventually broken by his communicator's buzz.
"How does a computer program take control of a person? Extremis never did that before," U.S. Agent asks skeptically, uniform already ripped at the shoulder, skin underneath the bright red of an energy burn, and Hank bends low to explain it to him.
Steve almost wants to land and poke around. He can't stop looking down at the building – it's practically complete, it looks like all that's left are details, a paintjob, the glass for the windows, railings and doors.
He sounds so utterly sure that Steve finds himself hoping that Reyes might've actually solved the mystery.
There's a sharp buzz, and it actually takes him a moment to place it, frowning in surprise, opening his comm.
"He did," Bucky says. "This isn't a grudge. Working with him . . ." He stops, frowning. Still keeping his gaze calm and steady on Steve, though, and it reminds him of a processing computer. "If SHIELD is on his radar for some reason, do you really doubt he'd exercise any restraint bringing it down?"
"The rest of us will focus on evacuating, and the jets." Everything else SHIELD is throwing at them only has one go; once a car is smashed, it's smashed. Jets have multiple rounds of ammunition, they need to get them on the ground.
Steve clears his throat. Uppercut, jab, shield to the face, and a Hill is sizzling on the floor. "Break up Peter and MJ's marriage."
"What? No, I –" just realized that's a joke. Tony's weak smile widens at Steve's sheepish expression. "You haven't been playing, either."
"Twenty!" The auctioneer calls, sounding slightly giddy.  "Going once, twice! Sold! Twenty-thousand dollars! Greensboro Orphanage certainly thanks you."
One he's distracted from, as Tony starts breathing just a little deeper at the sight of Steve's cock, as he usually does.  Pulls it free like it's a prize, like it's something to be cherished, careful and deliberate touches.  It gets Steve at least half hard every time. "And you'd say something about how good I am at this," he says, then mouths the head.  Steve hisses tightly, fingers flexing in his hair.
"What sort of trap? A virus?" Steve demands. What is it doing? Slowly eating at Tony's brain? "Could they be tracking us now?"
Is he? If it comes down to that, yes; Tony wouldn't survive a minute. Better Steve, who could last ten. "I won't be much more of a challenge, but yes."
They stare, they hesitate, and SHIELD's jets operate pretty much silently when compared to other types of aircraft, but they're jets, and the sound is deafening when one soars overhead, entirely too low, riddling the office buildings on either side with holes.
"Cloning duplicates a living being. It's like making an artificial twin," Tony says. "It's . . . well, morally questionable."
To be fair, Steve tells him about both Elisa Waters from down the street and James Ashley, who worked at the local grocery, but nothing's going to top Tony's admission. Not even the valentines he anonymously sent James, and then was too embarrassed to own up to, even when caught more or less red handed. Steve teases him lightly, and then the subject drops.
Speculating on specifics is pointless, though. Linda and Lois probably know more about Tony's life than he does. The last thing Steve heard, Tony was holing up in his tower, rebuilding the Stark empire that Osborn so effectively toppled, paying little attention to anything else.
Steve stares; not so much that Tony's saying it, or that there's some truth to his words, but that he obviously believes it's just that simple.
"We had something, the start of something," Steve says. "It was real. And we could have it again. I want to have it again."
Eventually, he manages to pull Tony to the side, unable to wait any longer. Impatient to hear how much time Tony lost.
"Shit," Tony says. Closes his eyes, then looks over Steve's shoulder at the massive hole in the billboard, the scattered pieces of burning car. "Shit," he says again. He seems to become aware of the way he's holding onto Steve, then. His grip relaxes, and his hands rest flat and warm against Steve's upper arms, then slowly slide off, a sort of lingering caress.
"You were one of those kids who just went home if the other boys wouldn't play by your rules, weren't you?"
"So, Osborn found a way around that satellite lock," Tony says conversationally, backing into Sam's kitchen.
"No. There are three teams on the way there, but we've got no way of contacting – excuse me, sir," she says, hoists a rocket launcher onto her shoulder.
Steve actually feels pretty calm about the entire thing – relatively speaking, on the scale of one to ten on losing everything you own, he's probably registering on a pretty solid four – until he hears Tony's voice.
He leans in, forearm against the wall, above both their heads. Showing all his cards. It was just one look – he could be wrong, but he's lost, and lost, and lost, he'll bet it all if it means gaining this.
"He's shredding a paper trail," Bucky says, shaking his head. "Hiding something. It was a Stark satellite that fired on Stark tech, on Stark property. There's no investigation, because he hasn't reported any of it. There's been no retaliation for the attacks. And somehow, they all happen when there will be absolutely no casualties."
"Our heritage bid us forward, and morality acted as our compass," Fandral declares, stepping forward, almost chest to chest with Steve, and tall enough that it does nothing to block his view of Tony, behind them both. "Your atrocities are an offense to all Asgardians, and every mortal, dead or quick, who stands beside us!"
The already tense conversation falls into an awkward pause, and everyone reflects on how Hank is chairman of his team of Avengers, and Steve is very much not; then Hank nods, once.
It reminds Steve of a drumbeat, and whatever it is – it's on the move, getting closer; soon loud enough to rattle the glasses in Sam's cupboard.
"Try false imprisonment. Their files are wiped," Gawrych laughs. "You've got nothing on me, I'm a free man, so you'd best remove–" And then he drops, utterly limp in Steve's grip, and it takes him a moment to process the bullet hole in the back of the man's head, because a shot fired from De Lisle is quite literally silent; cocking it back makes more noise.
Tont only picks at his fries, and gives a very weak defense when Steve starts stealing them, finally surrendering them by curling in his leg, giving Steve unblocked access.
"I was over the Atlantic when my armor locked up. It started going through the activation routine – running through basic motor functions," bending the arm joints, knees, testing the shoulder's range of motion; Tony's body, trapped inside, manipulated along with the armor. "Making sure the systems function. It's only supposed to happen when the armor gets another –" he stops. "Whoever it was, they found a way to hack into the armor, give it another command center. I just sat there and watched," he says, and clenches his jaw.
The two new Hills are cornering Tony, and three more Hills come in at once, blocking Steve from giving any assistance, but he's holding his own well. If only LMDs actually felt his strikes - as it is, the best Tony can really do is duck and dodge and block.
One stab. Tony's a sloppy fighter. He over-commits to his strikes, hesitates on his dodges. He waffles. He's too used to his armor.
He lands, one hand on the back of Tony's head, the other around his waist, pulling him close enough to roll to a stop as one on the hotel roof. The flying car, holding the still roaring Hulk in the backseat, plows into the side of three foot thick billboard, immediately crunching into useless piles of metal, flinging the Hulk through the sign.
Tony looks sick, obviously losing his focus with the Hill he has left. "It must've killed him to turn that down."
A second explosion, louder this time, and Steve backs out of the lab. "I have to go. Keep me updated."
"How do you make amends for that?" Tony asks. "I knew what I was doing was unforgivable, I knew it as I did it. I thought it was worth it."
"Spider-woman, Wonder Man and –" Steve stops when he gets to Hank; that's not the Wasp costume he's been donning recently. It's not Yellowjacket's or Goliath's or Ant Man's, either. "Hank. You three get up on the Helicarrier and stop these things from coming down, assist the agents up there.
Steve steps closer to look at the cut, notes that it's not deep, and then becomes distracted by the high cheeks, the expression, the lips and lashes and caught breath. His hand lingers on Tony's face.
"I can't imagine." If he had been the one to forget, and Tony was the one trying to bring it together? Or would he just let it go? Resigned, he realizes, yes, Tony would. He'd probably see it as doing Steve a favor. And maybe Steve wouldn't be as receptive to hearing it, without experiencing yesterday firsthand. But he pushes those thoughts aside, because that's, thankfully, not what happened. "You said you want me," he repeats.  "And I think you still do."
"Then just say, 'Thank you, Tony,'" Tony says, smiling like it's nothing. And maybe he's actually rich enough that it is, but still.
The first thud is quiet enough that Steve assumes Tony's woken and stumbled into something. But it repeats, thud. Thud, again and again, slow and steadily increasing in volume. He places it as coming from outside, maybe a block or two away.
"If you're about to tell me it's a bad idea to have ammunition floating above innocent people, and how easily it can go wrong, trust me. I've kind of got that," Tony says. "I should've started pulling some of these down when Ultron hijacked the weather manipulator." Yeah, Steve heard about that whole adventure from Hank.
Castle's gone, although Steve hadn't expected him to stick around. The longer he waits, the harder time he'll have getting Gawrych dead and buried. And other self-imposed obligations to maim and murder, Steve's sure.
"You're looking," a lot happier than Steve had ever seen the man, positively giddy in comparison. "Better."
Tony's mouth works silently as if possessed, too fast to be full words, ignoring Steve completely. His expression is smooth and empty, and he offers no resistance to Steve's hands on his shoulders, jerking him slightly, swaying with the movement.
"We're . . ." Steve pauses, watching a Hulk scream with rage, kicking at a suit of Iron Man armor that refuses to respond. "Getting it under control. I don't suppose you can do anything about these jets."
A slight huff of disappointment, Steve doesn't pursue but staying close.  He's suddenly very aware of the armor encasing Tony's flesh, head to toe, cool and solid and unyielding between them, and how, any second, Tony could decide to close the one window of vulnerability over his face, take off into the air and Steve would be stuck, frustratingly earthbound, just watching him drift away and out of sight.
Then again, it was just a few hours. Possible to recreate, now that Steve knows that it's there to be found –he tells himself, there was nothing particularly exceptional about that nightmare Tony had had, the dark hallway, that apology. But of course, as he thinks it, he can't help but analyze each step, each word. What had been the tipping point? Or was it another time entirely, in the abandoned offices? Something that had been slowly growing in Tony's head, starting months ago? Years?
She's fast, bounding down onto the detached garage with surprising agility. His shield arches beautifully, knocking Sin's legs out from under her with a satisfying clunk, and she falls between the two buildings with an even more satisfying yelp, arms flailing.
But whenever Tony started trying to follow the trail, he'd get blatant, hard hits. SE's processors suddenly swarmed with viruses, power cut. "Opening my door to look was just letting them in." Beefing  up his anti-virus protection would work – for a week, two at best, then they'd find a way around it. Tony went on a more physical offense.
"Fuck–" Tony's shaking his leg; a Hill, barely functioning and missing one eye, dragged itself across the floor and grabbed his ankle.
"Thanks." He takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry I didn't think of a way to bring you back." It has the air of a long, closely-held confession, coming out in a sort of rush. "James shouldn't have had to give that up. He didn't do anything wrong. I'm – I gave up. On you. I'm sorry."
"None," the eye on the street confirms. "But this is not an unexpected move on Stark's part; he's become notorious for going underground in the face of this kind of upheaval. Of course, we hope he's safe from further attacks, wherever he is."
"Cap," Tony says, lifting the faceplate. Steve's actually startled; he'd gotten so used to the haggard, worn man. A bright-eyed, well-rested and apparently remade Tony is disarmingly gorgeous.
"In the past day you've made me happier than I've been for months. Don't make me give that up, not because it could go wrong," he says.  "Please, Tony."
Steve's filled more than half of the scrap paper with doodles, and wishes for one of his sketch books–which he remembers, with a grimace, are all gone.
Steve switches it off, finishes tying his right shoe and hopes Tony knows what the hell he's gotten himself into.
Tony's jaw flexes, obviously unsure how to classify Steve's gaze, or maybe just not wanting to word it himself, take the responsibility for releasing it into the air.
Steve's grip on his shield tightens as he approaches – Castle refused to strike him before, but Steve hadn't been standing between him and murdering someone then.
He doesn't ask how Castle knows Sin would turn on her employer. She's borderline psychotic and, quite frankly, a brat. It's the obvious conclusion.
"You used the Son of Odin's face – his self – as a mask of intimidation against his own comrades," Hogun says. "Our lord used to speak highly of Iron Man's nobility. That is a scheme worthy of our wretched brethren Loki."
"Most of the time," Tony says, and the blush from earlier is returning.  "I would imagine sucking your cock."
SHIELD is still Fury-less, and now Sharon-less, the missions are essentially exercises in failure, and even the new agents have started commenting on Steve's rough treatment of the terrorists they do manage to snag.
Steve watches the body drag itself down the street. He's reaching for his shield when a small figure darts into view. Spider-man is bounding back and forth from Sam's building to the one across it, forming a web in the body's path.
Steve tips back on his chair, and can make out two figures in the hallway: Tony, arms wrapped around his middle, and Don Blake, leaning against the wall.
His most successful relationships have always been with women who fought beside him as Captain America.
A long, shaky exhale, and Tony does face him, although his eyes still flit across Steve's face, stubbornly refusing to lock. Even this bad, worn down and tired, eyes still red rimmed – Tony's gorgeous. This close, it's hard to ignore how he parts his lips, then bites down on the bottom, slightly plusher of the pair.
good at this, and half the fun is watching his expression; practically euphoric as he takes it in deeper, running his tongue along the bottom, against a vein. Tony pulls back, and Steve has to clamp down on the urge to thrust his hips forward.
In embarrassingly teenage fashion, the Miss America portrait ended up displaying this . . . admiration, in a blatant emphasis of her curves. Not so much as to call it obscene, but it was definitely the most popular portrait. He'd thankfully matured a bit by the time he got the chance to work side-by-side with Madeline.
"I hope you guys aren't planning to replace it with something else," Wiccan adds, trained eye on Hulkling's skirmish, but he's obviously bothered by the idea.
The lights in the lab flicker, and then go out. Steve watches as the rest of the city darkens all at once, as though some gigantic plug powering the entire city was pulled. There's a soft click, and the communicator in his hands dies.
"I don't, really, I just assume there'd be some outside sign that something is happening in your head."
"Gawrych," Steve says, steadying the councilmember before he falls on his ass; from the look of surprise on his face, he'd somehow missed Steve standing there. Choking the grip of a pistol he clearly has no clue how to handle, rumpled and sweating, a general mess, and it doesn't take long to figure out exactly what happened. He tightens his grip on the back of the man's shirt. "It's going to be hard to give 'on the run from SHIELD custody' a positive spin."
It's a slight, growing heat that prompts Steve to turn around, just in time to see the bright red pulse of energy rip through the sky, pummeling into Sam's apartment. It explodes, blackened and burning wooden debris raining down on the two of them.
"What?" Steve asks; the body in his arms feels warm, feels soft, but he knows how life-like they're made now. "How do you know?"
The goatee scratches more than Steve thought it would, and he likes it more than he would've thought, the constant reminder of who this is. Tony breathes, hot and dry against Steve's still closed lips. And this time it's Tony bringing their lips together, a desperate, broken moan, eyes closed tight.
"No," Steve says, firm, and is frustrated when Tony doesn't look entirely convinced. "I know you're not a monster, Tony," he says. "Bucky was open to the idea that you were doing it – all of it."
Hogun nods. "When you become a monster, even against a great evil, you cannot win. You become the next evil for the next man to knock down."
He's tired of getting pushed to a comfortable distance, knowing his presence causes pain to people he cares about, and the best he can do is watch from a distance. Sitting on his hands as they struggle, and hurt, because he died to begin with.
"SHIELD, not her agents," Steve says. "Tony can tell the difference between the two. And he wouldn't do that to Pepper."
– never comes because a teenager just appeared out of nowhere and gave him an enchanted force field. The Hulk slams into it with enough speed that he bounces backward, stumbling to the ground, obviously dazed.
"I surrendered! I knew, and I know, what I'm getting into," Steve says, standing, striding over to Tony, who's retreated from the doorway to the opposite wall. "I'm beginning to think that you're still trying to cope with my death, while everyone else has figured out that I came back eight months ago."
If they had captured Norman Osborn, there probably wouldn't be this lingering fear of him, of the influence he had. But he's dropped off the map completely, and his name haunts the agents, an excuse for the constant, inexplicable failures, and they’ve latched onto it tightly.
"That's right," Lois picks up again. "And of course, Steve Rogers has no comment, continuing his media silence since his return in early November of last year." And of course, they use this opportunity to put up that photo from the first few hours of his official enlistment in the Army back in the 40s, no doubt dug up by some demented intern. Fresh from the serum, Steve looks all of 15 in it, dazed and half- smiling in what he's been told is an endearing way. They hadn't even tried calling him, as far as Steve knows. But they're right; Steve wouldn't have anything enlightening to share about this.
"Oh, Cap doesn't like that. He must have some really good toys hidden in there, Brock." She smiles. "He says he won't leave a stone unturned!"
Steve runs a hand across the top of the worn, time softened wood.  He nods once.  She had been.  He takes another look at the reserve price, and it seems slightly less daunting. Which is a good thing, he's no more leaving this behind than his shield.
"Rykers is a mess," Bucky continues. "They need backup. I'm going to see what I can do about the power out."
Steve wished Tony cared more, though, that he used better judgment when getting serious with someone. That he could at least tell a borderline psychopath from someone who would treat him properly, wouldn't depend on mind games.
Smashing the Hill that just won't stay down gives him a pretty good excuse to not turn, not see the expression on Tony's face. There's no way Tony feels as bad about it as Peter does, but he wouldn't be surprised if it's close.
Steve watches a teenager with a bald, glistening head and an anarchy symbol tattooed onto his shoulder fumble with a bazooka that's more likely to hurt himself than any of the well-equipped agents, then winces at a not entirely unexpected explosion.
"Those old propaganda posters," Tony explains, and it's such a rarity to see the man embarrassed -- the tips of his ears are actually going pink. "My history professor had the first editions hanging on his wall.  One year they were right by my desk."
"Hercules," Steve says. "Agent, She-Hulk, Wolverine. You're going to Rykers, assist with the escaped prisoners, at least until the power gets back on.
Tony shrugs it on, standing, batting at some dirt that clings to his legs. It barely reaches mid-thigh, but it works.
"It's Wanda all over again," Simon says, sounding surprisingly numb, tipping his head up as a jet blasts overhead.
But Don's voice is calm and non-accusing. "– forgave Mister Fantastic. He's having a harder time with you cause – well, Thor's proud. He hates being proven wrong."
He decided to 'retire' from the whole mess of it once handing the shield back to Steve. A decision that made a lot more sense once Steve realized Bucky didn't know what retiring actually meant. He is independent, both from SHIELD and any specific government, but he's shown virtually no interest in starting a normal life.
"My lord," Fandral says, easily, but has the decency to bring his feet down from the table. "We grow bored without sport. It was in jest, we would not enter real battle with any mortal as weak –"
There's no one on the other end, so it's silent when he stops speaking, and there's no one else in his home, so the silence stretches there, too. He feels suffocated by it for a moment. He holds the phone to his ear a beat longer before hanging up, without saying goodbye.
"You all right?" Steve asks, the clears his throat, voice surprisingly gruff, even to his own ears.  He wants to see Tony's face, see him speaking, alive, get the image of him lying limp and comatose out of his head, but now is nowhere near the time.  "Did – did they fix you?"
"If you honestly don't want this," he says, quietly, "say so and I won't bring it up again. But if you're doing this because of some martyr complex or you think I'm confused . . ."
And he's seen it before – this particular body, Tony's bare torso and legs – but there's no way to look at Tony's body without acknowledging that it's attractive. And acknowledging that, just now, when he feels like this, feels wrong. Feels almost invasive. So, he doesn't look.
Picturing it, idly, surprisingly doesn't feel all that different from time spent with Tony before, just an added layer of exhilaration, something that makes him grip the pen tighter, smile a bit as he continues his drawing, outlining an eyebrow, a sultry gaze.
It makes a part of Steve ache that Tony feels the need to say it. "I know you're not. I don't think you were even tempted," he says. "But Tony, that kind of power, in the hands of one man, even if he doesn't want it, accountable to no one and the only man to shoulder it if it goes wrong," Steve says. "It shouldn't be on your shoulders, just because you have the right intentions. It's – that kind of responsibility is like fire, Tony. If you handle it too much, you end up scarred and . . . numb."
Steve stiffens, ready to stand.  "We haven't been that long, you could probably catch a few of them."
Maria Hill is standing in the doorway, in a slick black jumpsuit, staring expectantly, and ludicrously, all Steve can think to ask is, "You signed back up with SHIELD?"
"Bad news," he winces.  "Twelve year old Tony didn't enjoy the thought of anal.  Blow jobs were usually as far as it got."
"Why didn't you say something?" Steve asks, tugs him down to his step, chest to chest, feeling each inhale, exhale, the shift of his body weight when Tony leans forward, into him.
Tony's almost swaying on his feet, but he manages a run of technological babble that impresses Reed well enough, and the two are immediately off in a conversation that Steve can't even begin to follow.
"Funny thing? I'm not," Rhodes says, and it's hard to tell for sure with the armor, but he actually sounds sincere. "I've hung around you long enough that at this point, getting totally ignored is like getting a Christmas card. Just another way of showing you care."
He makes it to the hot spot in less than ten minutes. The suburban neighborhood has already devolved into a war zone, and Steve doesn't throw that term around lightly. The hastily abandoned street is covered with SHIELD agents in full riot gear, an obscene number of Sin's lackeys, bullet holes and a few fires.
She purses her lips. "I said a few days as a precaution," she says. "It's impossible to pinpoint what he'll forget and remember, what will be distorted. Extremis cycles through memories a few times before it becomes fixed, like a conventional brain does. Anything that's still cycling isn't going to be permanent, and isn't going to be able to be transferred. I can't do any more than that."
He's wearing a Buffalo Bills shirt that's too small, sweatpants that are too big and bright white, brand new sneakers; pretty obviously not his first choice. Steve imagines he was ejected from his armor by force, somewhere near a gift shop. He couldn't very well go home to change.
"I see," Reed says, and Steve's sure he's actually listening, it's just that he sounds utterly detached, is monitoring five screens and is typing on two different keyboards simultaneously. "I've activated every signal disruptor available here, Tony should be waking in a moment."
"You are . . . shorter than we were led to believe," Hogun notes, cocking his head to the side. "Truly, do you possess no other skills than donning enhanced metals? And you kept pace with Thor, and the man who can grow boundless heights, and the lady who can produce the like of lightning out of her own hands, and the most accomplished soldier of your people? You are the man of iron and wit?"
"Tony's not in any of these, right?" Rhodes asks by way of greeting, landing heavily in front of Steve. He winds back his fist, and these Hulks aren't made of quite the same stuff as the original; when Rhodes smashes its face, it stumbles back, dazed, and drops.
He can't say he's surprised to see a large amount of pedestrians just a street over, continuing their morning routine despite the jagged shadows cast by the spastic light of a fire plainly visible.
Across the street, leaning against a black, well-used mustang, stone-faced and armed, is the Punisher.
"You have no idea," Tony says, and he's on the step above Steve, a good head taller, and he cranes his neck up for the kiss, pulling Tony down into it.
In a fair, one on one fight, Steve could take Synthia easily. She's undisciplined, her effectiveness is product only of her enthusiasm in killing – even Juggernaut shows some restraint when barreling down a crowded street of innocents. Sin sees each loss of life as a bonus.
"I accessed . . ." He clears his throat. "For a second, while it was in my head, I accessed Extremis. I think they left it open for me, I fell for some trap - I'm . . . uh," he huffs. "I don't really feel . . . " he groans, head dropping forward listlessly. "But I managed an emergency lockdown. We should be safe for the next five hours."
"Your hands would be in my hair," Tony says, pulling old leather through the loops, tugging it free of the metal.  Steve's hands are immediately resting lightly on Tony's head.  The gloves are a brighter red that contrasts brilliantly with Tony's dark hair, and a thicker fabric.  He can't quite press his fingers together; that had always bothered him, and the fact that he can barely feel the heat of the other man, let alone the strands of his hair, is a slight annoyance.
SHIELD doesn't share its intelligence with the media, but they've started putting the pieces together on their own by now, and in one shortsighted, arguably pure evil move, Dodd managed to commit career suicide, and fund the murders of children too young to read. Steve tries not to think about which would bother the man more.
Peter finishes webbing an Iron Man suit to a lamppost, then flings by, nabbing Bobbi around the waist and slinging up and out of sight without a word.
"The son of Odin's final word was to stay in Asgard," Thor says. "I would say that rectifies it. Do you say otherwise?"
Tony's face is unreadable. Not blank, but tense, eyes dark with an emotion Steve can't name. He's pressing himself hard against the wall as if trapped, which doesn't make sense at all, and Steve only cottons on when his eyes flicker down to Steve's bare chest, briefly. It's a look of intent. Brief and pained.
The destruction of his vacation home in Malibu reeked of Zeke Stane. But the attacks kept coming, in pricks, really, subtle and restrained – Stark Subsidiaries having their licenses revoked, impossibly delayed funding, both coming and going, red tape slowly winding around Stark Enterprise's ankles, personal information leaked, money leaks, constant money leaks, nickels and dimes, adding up –
Tony starts stirring – low, short groans and shoulders shifting – just as Steve crosses the space between kitchen and living area, and has just enough time to change the still muted channel from yet another replay of Tony's Human Torch impression – a few people had caught it on their camera phones – to cartoons before the man sits up, hair an utter mess, eyes still closed.
He'd kissed Sharon even when it seemed like she could barely stomach the sight of him. But maybe he has more to lose with Tony.
Steve unlocks the door with a high kick, and they maneuver past an obvious receptionist area to where emptied cubicle walls still sit. The open, bare windows let the dark oranges of the setting sun lend the whole thing an almost surreal feel. "This was a cult?"
"I did."  Iron Man lands on a nearby roof, his voice broadcast loud enough for them to pick up, continuing to blast upward. "A privately owned landmark. Unfortunately, I lost the rights on it."
Compared to Tony's past relationships, Steve's have been downright boring; generally beginning with an upfront, realized attraction, brought on by a string of pleasant dates, combat that had driven them close. A smile from across the room. Ending with about as much fanfare. He still considers most women he had a relationship with friends; he's had to burn very few bridges.
Tony's about to lie. There's no real tell, a person would've had to know Tony – well, years, to interpret that shift of weight correctly. It's the same stance he takes when bracing himself for a blow on the battlefield.
"Two hours? Maybe three," Tony says. "You can go, if you want. This part is probably going to be pretty boring." But he's got a sort of gleam in his eye as he looks over the spread components. Eager to take on the challenge.
, not quite violent, but with as much strength as he feels safe using.  Tony's going to be bruised, Tony's going to be sore, Tony's going to remember this, feel it.
"You were dead–" Tony persists. Steve nips at his lip in light admonishment for continuing such a topic, after finding this, and gets a moan in response. "Steve," he says again, voice low with emotion.
"Tony wasn't controlling each move, he sent out one order, it would take a second order to stop them, which Tony is incapable of now that–"
"It's up to you, Frank." Punisher's face stays blank. Maybe Steve's wrong, maybe killing has become more important to him than protecting.
"Cap?" West is staring at Steve, hand on Gawrych's shoulder. "Do you need a backup team to that second site?"
"Right now, I'm more concerned with being her friend," Steve says. "I don't think that'll change anytime soon."
Swearing tightly, Steve dodges an incoming car, and, taking a wild stab, hurls himself inside as it skids by. Fumbling a minute, he gets his hands on the wheel and – it responds. Steve pulls it up, taking it higher.
Steve hears the soft whump, and it's invisible, but he feels the slight shift of . . . something that War Machine releases, radiating outward. The hordes of Iron Man armor, one by one, lock up tight, arms snapping to sides, legs snapping together, dropping out of the sky.
He's right. Sure, Sin and Crossbones had obviously been expecting them, known exactly where they were coming in, how many agents they had, what artillery they were carrying. But the team had been assembled spur of the moment, a group of SHIELD agents with decades of field experience. Loyal, good men and women. And even if he did suspect one of them, Steve had been with them from briefing to debriefing. There just hadn't been time.
Tony rubs at his forehead. "It's hard to say. No one's really gaining anything from this. Whoever it is, they aren't after Stark Enterprises, they had plenty of chances to make a grab for that. Or after my tech, they could've taken that. They . . . they have a chance at millions of dollars, and they go after an old man in a hospital. Whoever it is, they really hate me. Unselfishly. Making me miserable is worth more to them than personal gain. Ty Stone is dead. Best guess is Osborn. He's got enough money that he wouldn't be interested in more, and he's got the resources. But this is a lot of restraint, even for him."
"It's still reading," Reed says, both his hands continuing their frantic movements. "The location it recorded will appear on that Fantasti-held once it finishes."
"Experts on-site predicting little to no injuries, thanks to the early hour. Stark himself was in the building at the time of the explosion, but was seen in the Iron Man armor, and is assumed to be alive and unhurt. Let's go to Jim on the street. Jim?"
The pair of them have been heading east, steadily, and it's a pretty sure bet they're going to show up at Councilmember Gawrych's estate. SHIELD had them evacuated, but Gawrych had insisted on staying behind as proper bait – Sin wouldn't waste much time around an empty house, and she probably wouldn't stop until she got to him. Not necessary, but it is useful. And, coincidentally, a brilliant publicity stunt. If Gawrych survives. If SHIELD does their job. If there isn't a leak.
Steve shrugs, and whacks the last of the standing Hills with an almost lazy wave of his arm. "Mephisto's never really aimed for the stars."
The sun's just started to rise, the air's pleasantly cool, and two Maria Hills lie sizzling in the street. Steve hadn't gotten much sleep, and they're being hunted by a revenge obsessed maniac, but Tony walks two steps ahead of him before turning to smile at Steve, and he's pretty sure there's nothing this day could bring that he can't handle.
"Sue, how are you?" Tony says, and it's only a little slurred. Neither of them seem to notice, greeting them pleasantly.
"After these jokers get back to Asgard," Don says, jerking a thumb at the three warriors. Volstagg stands, and Steve winces at the rather large, worryingly deep imprint of his backside in the chair. Maybe he'll be funding a few new pieces of furniture as well as the wardrobe.
"I'm not as well off as I once was, but I can still cover this without it making a dent, don't worry."
Too wound up, too caught up in trying to look anywhere but at the man in front of him, Tony misses the widening of Steve's eyes as he processes that.
He's useful down here. In battle, a man doesn't think about a friend's dead weight in his arms, or the evil computer program devouring his brain. He just moves.
On the second story landing, Steve does his best to assure Tony that it is happening, here and now, and it takes them much longer than it ever took Sam and Steve to reach the bottom of the stairwell.
Steve forces himself to walk out of the room, and back to the signs and traffic and waving, because it would be very bad form for him to punch innocent bystanders at a charity auction.
"I suggest we step away from it," Tony says, softly.  Steve's about to ask why, when he notices a good portion of the milling crowd now giving sidelong glances to the antique Captain America had been fawning over.
"Yeah, I came back. Same week as you, but," Jack shrugs. "Jack of Hearts doesn't make front page when he's competing with Captain America."
Thor's hammer smashes into the ground, a massive crack that turns to a roar of thunder, echoing in the valley, and the ground beneath his hammer surrenders, denting deeply and splintering out wildly in all directions.
"It's a nice change of pace," Steve admits. Now free to use deadly force, he slams Hill's head into his knee, dropping onto her – its back, and it cracks under his weight.
Why did he leave him alone? He knew Tony didn't have his armor. He knew people were after him. He should've asked Bucky to keep watch.
Steve says nothing, fiddling deliberately with his chopsticks and watching Tony's expression. He's read up on this incident since coming back, all public record now. Curious to see what Tony will say.
"Indeed there is, Linda. The citizens of New York were spared harm by the apparent viciousness of the hit, literally turning everything, from the walls, to Stark's personal belongings, to dust."
"Right," Tony says. "One of the additions I made to the armor he ruined was a tracker. All I've really got left is a physical assault; my hands are tied here, technologically speaking."
But Steve is facing east on 87th street, so he'll keep facing east on 87th, moving forward until backup arrives.
He slams a Hill headlong into Sam's television, and they both sizzle and fry, and Sam should be pleased. He was wanting a flat screen, anyway.
"Of course," Lois agrees, shuffles a set of paper, and turns to address a screen to the right. "For those of you keeping track at home, investigators have just confirmed there are no reported causalities or injuries. Stark Tower, while once the headquarters for the super powered team Avengers, the top three floors have been at the personal use of Stark himself for the past year, after the recent Skrull invasion and Osborn disaster disbanded the official, longstanding team."
"The standby backups take a moment to warm up, Johnny," Reed says. "The scope of the destruction is what makes me question your conclusion, Maya."
The first commission Steve filled – paid for and everything – was just out of high school. A series of patriotic heroes, the ones inspired by red, white and blue, on their way to fight in Germany in droves. He was given canvasses as tall as himself, as much paint as he asked for, and was unbearably eager. The end results were amateurish to say the least, but at the time Steve, and the group commissioning them, had been pleased.
"I'll be right there," Steve says, and Tony's armored hand presses against his shoulder before he can pull away.
The gravel digs into his elbows and palms, and if he just relaxed against Tony, it'd stop, but he can't bring himself to. This isn't happening, Tony didn't want it to happen, he didn't want to get drunk, he wouldn't want Steve to remember this.
"They fought magnificently," Fandral assures him once they make it back to the city, he and Volstagg taking turns detailing certain hits that were beyond Steve's mortal capacity to make out. Hogun, who had to know he had no chance, lingered toward the back, glowering, and is now standing in the corner of Sam's home, glowering.
Problem is, that's exactly the man Steve remembers. As much as he harps on Steve about his unattainable idealism, it's Tony who refuses to compromise on matters like this, once he's convinced he knows best. He can be just as hardheaded, just as blind to a need to bend as Steve, if not more. Tony often tries to bring down entire mountains with nothing more than his stare; the amazing thing being that most of the time, it works.
Hogun and Fandral bid farewell from the balcony, and the door closes, leaving behind n a surprisingly quiet apartment.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, plays in his head, that strangled voice, and Steve shoves it away. It didn't happen.
"Does it have to do with how everything with a computer is suddenly going evil and attacking people? Cause I'm pretty interested in that story."
Tony has a gorgeous body. It's something any artist can appreciate:  long, slender limbs, wide shoulders, tapering hips. An ideal form, the kind literally propped up on a pedestal for worship, carved into stone for posterity.
The conversation they had feels more and more distant with each second, the possibility of Tony forgetting what he'd said, what he'd felt, and an absurd fear of someone, stumbling on it first, seem uncomfortably possible.
Old friends had gotten back to rebuilding their lives. Thor was– and is – still needed to build his new Asgard. The hopelessly splintered sects of Avengers – Steve couldn’t, and can't, align himself with one or the other, which had hurt and alienated Hank and Clint.
Keenly aware that if it's possible for Asgardians to find them, other, less jovial and pleasant company could do the same, Steve grabs his shield before opening the door.
Steve winces; he'd practically said his address over that compromised connection. "I thought your satellite didn't harm living things."
"It really is the most remarkable project I've seen in months, Captain," says Reed's head, floating by behind her.
Arms laden with electronics, Tony backs into Radio Shack's door, holding it for Steve, weighed down with just as many boxes and bags. It's not heavy, but it's awkward, a bunch of tiny, entirely too expensive devices, and they barely make it to the car without dropping anything.
Tony's legs slide off the couch, one at a time, forcing himself upright. He mutters a groggy thanks, and attacks the food with his customary desperation. Steve politely turns his attention to a cartoon that seems to have no discernible plot beyond a whale and little blond boy existing in an ill-defined oceanfront area.
If Steve had any doubt about their heritage, watching them eat seven consecutive helpings would've put it to rest. Their appetite is frankly astounding, and sloppy, and takes three tables to contain. Steve would laugh, if he could forget the blades. They look like a pack of wolves, digging into a recent kill.
So Steve's been told, and he supposes he's not one to argue, but from what he can tell, Reed is more interested in the theoretical – which isn't to say he doesn't apply it, but if you want to talk about how far an explosion will extend, how to contain it, how to make it – you go to Reed. Tony Stark's the one that actually blows things up. It's practical application, says Tony. It's the difference between endless lists of equations and fevered hand gestures that narrate expulsion and weight displacement, and an actual ship rocketing off into the air.
She gets up without a word, and when she surges forward to attack again, Steve grabs both of her fists in his, pulling her close, an effective pin against his chest. "What's gotten into you?" Steve asks incredulously as she jerks in his grip, kicking wildly.
"There were three more robberies of local credit unions on Saturday, committed by – or, more accurately, through – re-animated corpses of recently departed citizens. Chief of Police, Jake Berenson, asked us to repeat, there will be no arrests or prosecutions of the undead, and he would like to apologize to the families of the departed for any damage done to the bodies caught in the line of action."
"We don't have to tell him," Steve decides, going in for a second kiss, lifting Tony clear off the ground and the three steps to the desk.
"No," Tony says, sounding numb. "That's the mansion. They're rebuilding it. Some obsessed fanatic probably bought it up, is rebuilding it so they can get off on wearing other old shit of ours they bought and pretending to be a superhero."
"Reed's got help, they're working on it in the Baxter Building," Steve says. And as much as he would love to throw every bright mind at the problem, "but we need heavy hitters down here, Hank."
"No," Steve says, turning his back on Castle, who leans against his car, watching. Waiting. "Stay on target. I'll be the only one engaging him."
"What– " but then Tony's eyes roll back into his head, and he drops forward, so Steve stops, catches the dead weight with a grunt.
There's that hum. Tony lands lightly, in a version of the suit Steve's never seen before. There are numbers scribbled onto various seams of metal, equations, obviously a prototype.
"Bruce?" Tony asks, and the expected, heavily browed face appears, but there's something slightly off, and Steve finally places it: his hair is shaggier than Bruce's is, as Hulk, and paler brown than his usual black.
"After you, boss," Rhodes says, and Iron Man launches up and away in an arc, War Machine close behind. Steve watches the pair of them burn through the air, Iron Man passing a jet, visibly disabling its shield and War Machine mows it down without so much as pausing. 'Stragglers' is putting it lightly, they're tearing through millions of dollars worth of SHIELD property.
Thankfully, the alter ego was subdued, and afterward, Sam decided to settle the issue, once and for all.
"You can leave if –" Steve stops to watch Bucky stand and walk out of the shop. "I guess we'll talk later."
"It can't go back into space like that, just dump it on Stark property, they'll recycle –" With a grunt, Thor's off. "–it."
She gives him another look, but Ollie stomps and she frowns, distracted, the force field visibly brightening. "Well, it's good to see the two of you talking. I've missed the Avengers."
She says nothing, expression fixed in a mild scowl as she continues to struggle, trying her best to tip Steve back, but he's planted his feet.
"Not quite," Tony says, but it's close enough to quiet him, and Steve doesn't regret a word he said, but he does wish it hadn't made him tense at Steve's side.
The armor flies closer to his left, and Steve barely has time to chose between a large fist to his stomach or a repuslor burning through his stomach. He blocks the repulsor blast, and the Hulk knocks him off the ground, across the street, into a wall, with dizzying force. Steve drops, gasping for air, head spinning, and dust and bits of broken concrete on the street around him jumping with each step as the Hulk charges.
Allowing them in his home, Steve has no doubt. Tolerating commentary on his clothes, possibly. But there's no way he wouldn't be cross with Steve sharing the fact that what messed with Bucky's head also played havoc with Sam's, reverting him back to Snap in a big, ugly way. Made him a whole other person: angry, ruthless. Diving into local gang politics with a bloody, aimless splash.
"How about Iron Man fans, would you say? Do you think this will significantly impact Stark's role in the suit?"
It feels odd to be wearing it again, but judging from Tony's slack jawed expression when he opened the door to his office to find Steve leaning on the desk, not nearly as jarring to see it again.
Clenching down hard on his cock, he milks a second orgasm out of Steve, and it's Tony that makes a soft, high noise as he's filled with Steve's come.
Numb as he moves toward it to double check, confirm, but he knows, knew the second he actually processed it, he has no doubt that the easel is -- was -- his. Still, he checks the backing board as soon as he reaches it.
"I have enemies now. I had the same enemies before that day, I'll have them as long as I carry that shield – I accepted that, I carry it anyway," Steve says. "Tony. It's more my fault than yours."
"Hey Brock!" she's yelling, in a tone that has to be purposefully obnoxious. A wave of SHIELD bullets make it about a foot away from her body, then disappear in a ripple of blue energy. Repulsor tech. She's going to have be taken down hand to hand, then.
The room is so full of eerily silent Maria Hills at this point, Steve can barely make out the top of Tony's head bobbing as he moves.
"Last year," Steve says, ramming one from behind, which goes tumbling forward into a second, and they both slam into the wall, cracking plaster. "As you remember it, Peter's aunt died."
"Need an assist?" Hank Pym's voice, magnified as it always is at this size, booms over the sound of metal crunching, screeching, bending as he crumples the car in his hands like so much paper.
Steve watches the bidding war with the distinct impression of sinking, deeper and deeper into high waters.  He stopped raising a good thousand dollars ago, and it's still going strong.
Tony hmms, wiping both hands on his jeans then diving back in. "You two got really close," Tony says. "Closer than –" He stops abruptly, focusing hard on the device in front of him, as if losing his train of thought in some wire, some chip, but his gaze is still, and Steve knows he just thought better of where that was going. Yes, they had gotten closer than they ever had before. Sharon gave a lot up for Steve. And yes, being reminded of it just now is painful. "Is it still there?"
"This isn't small. I can't do this if it's small," Tony persists, so Steve maneuvers him against the wall, and kisses him again. It seems to settle all of Tony's complaints, he falls into it with enthusiasm, but still, it should be said. He wants to say it, wants Tony to hear it.
"Punish– The Punisher?" Gawrych sputters, looking pale, and Steve goes to see what remains of his home at the sound of Reyes attempting to calm him.
He helps Tony to his feet, then against the door, kissing as deep as he can manage, hand gripping the back of his head tightly. "Impressive," Steve says when they finally come up for air, and Tony looks ridiculously pleased with himself. "Please tell me this ends with me fucking you."  Even with super stamina, it'll take a few minutes to recover fully, but lord, he's practically aching with the need to fuck the man in front of him silly.
The Helicarrier is hovering over New York City, bay doors open wide and generally looking as though it were giving birth to countless litters of black, SHIELD issued jets and cars.
But Tony hadn't come to him for help. He came for a reprieve, and wouldn't have done that if he'd been thinking straight. Steve wants to demand the ravioli back.
"That we can detect. It hit me today - what did Osborn work with, that our scanners were unable to find?" Reyes can't wait longer than a moment to answer himself, "Skrulls."
Steve's mind usually works in idle circles during jogs, like chewing gum. Working through various problems, stories he's read. Walking through each step of a previous battle, privately cheering for especially clever moves and twists. Regretting the ones not quite fast enough, comparing the two, coming up with improvements.
Despite Tony's reassurance, his condition only gets worse as they fly. His fingers are clumsy as he fiddles with the device, and what's probably worse than the actual chemical imbalance is Tony's reaction to it; he's clearly close to losing it, breathing hard and shifting restlessly.
Tony's settled on his haunches, head tipped back, pupils blown and eyes half lidded. He's clearly not awake, still loose and relaxed, and for a moment, looks like the Tony Steve remembers – fresh faced and - really, with his hair so disheveled, cheeks so defined - beautiful. But the immediate, constant worry, of course, taints it.
"You use science to make metals fight for you," Hogun adds, which isn't particularly relevant, but apparently bothers him, and they are airing their grievances.
"Helped in war efforts. This isn't war. And Extremis is gone, even Tony isn't capable of getting in and out of SHIELD data feeds without leaving fingerprints anymore," Steve says.
"You should've looked me up," Steve says, trying to convince his body that it's time for pleasantries, not smashing – well, something. Anything. Not being able to get how quickly the smile on Tony's face had melted to that blank, hollow stare out of his head probably isn't helping. "What are you doing here?"
Steve tries not to think too deeply about it as he surges forward, jumping onto the monster's back and yanking it out with a wet shunk. He rolls off, not fast enough for the Hulk to have missed him, to not get blamed in its primitive mind for causing it that pain. It locks on his figure with heaving, snorting rage.
His voice lowers to a rumble by the end, and the slightly ridiculous, comical mood evaporates instantly. Steve had catalogued their weapons the moment they entered, but now can't take his gaze away from each hard, well-worn blade on their hips. And strapped to their backs, and thighs, and ankles.
"Situation on the Helicarrier is unknown. And we need people on evac," she continues. "Every time we get a bystander out of the way, another one just pops up to take its place."
"I don't doubt it," Steve says. "You're the smartest man I know." It just hits him sometimes, how incredible everything Tony makes actually is. It's easy to take for granted, after a decade or so.
Specks, dotting the horizon, smaller than the rogue SHIELD jets and cars, every make and model of Iron Man Tony's ever put together approaches rapidly. There's quite possibly hundreds, blasting down almost idly at the streets below, handfuls every now and then breaking off, out of sight, targeting something in apparent need of destruction.
"We art the former Dark Young Avengers," says Enchantress, who's apparently taken to speaking in an obviously fake Asgardian accent. "We have yet to conjure a new appellation."
"It's - no, they can't, I had blocks set up, Osborn couldn't introduce any . . ." he brings both hands to his face, rubbing at his eyes. "Oh." He's frozen, hands pulled down enough for Steve to make out his eyes, which are wide. "I'm drunk."
Tony keeps staring out the balcony door, nodding. "You know, I was surprised when you didn't join any of the Avenger groups."
"Thanks, Lois," the grizzled, bushy eyebrowed reporter says. "It's actually the first time the downtown skyscraper has been attacked, and what an effective attack it was. As you can see by the footage, it was a very localized blow."
The Mighty Avengers collectively turn to look at him, but before it can be asked, and Steve is thankful for every delay, because he's really not sure how to word this, another team quite literally flings into view.
Steve knows Brock Rumlow. He won't drag it out with someone like Tony. He'll use the dagger. Fast, painless. He pull it out as he approaches Tony on the bed. Cover his mouth, and blue eyes will barely have a chance to open in surprise before thin, sharpened metal presses against his neck. And slices.
"It's a missed call," Tony supplies, almost offhand, just as Steve pulled the phone away, to see if she'd hung up. "That ringtone. It means you got the call earlier and you missed it. Call her back, we'll talk later."
"Does this mean Stark lied about something?" The level of venom in Peter's voice is disconcerting. "I can't believe it."
Steve braces himself as he opens the door, pulling his shield out, although they're probably not lucky enough that the Hulk decided to just hang around until they decided to join him.
There's no rush of realization, it was with a clear head that Steve bent, and pressed their lips together, but there is a steadily building feeling of euphoria; his chest filling with it, excitement, and he funnels it into yet another kiss, another series of scratches against his jaw and upper lip, nails against his shoulders. This is real, this is still happening, Tony wants it; maybe they'll never have to stop.
Despite what their friends seem to believe, Steve hasn't been angry at Tony since coming back. It's impossible to look at the man and not see past, stupid mistakes, regrets, but enough time has passed. Mostly, he's bothered by the last time they'd met, the way Tony's eyes had shifted, unable to rest on Steve's form for longer than a second when they last met.
"Sir? Excuse me, Mister Rogers?" Steve looks up; Agent Reyes shifts awkwardly under his gaze. "I checked your home, and you weren't there, then I checked your usual jogging path, but you weren't there either–"
He sits up, effectively sobered. Most of the people he's been around have gotten accustomed to the fact that he's alive again; he'd forgotten he ought to tiptoe around the subject.
Steve knows how much he tries to avoid using the term when describing something to Steve -- not that it's annoying, but it literally tells him nothing, when you're referring from something of his time. He waves it off.  "So, what about anal sex turned you off? Just . . . the obvious?"
Steve supposes Greensboro Auction's antique section should be surreal.  Most of the knick knacks there -- worn and chipping at the edges, delicate with age-- are technically younger than him.  There's even a few dated the decade he was born, day to day supplies, now kept behind glass and marked at ridiculous reserve prices.
"And if I may add, for a little guy I've got at home," Linda says, winking at the camera. "The New Avengers had no ties with Stark, so Captain America fans can sleep easy."
"I thought Extremis was gone," Steve says. It had been the first news he heard about Tony that had made him smile, after coming back.
"I can't believe you're picking on a man from 1940 about technology. That's not very sportsmanlike."
One would think, in this line of work, Steve would get used to ridiculous costumes, but he still gapes at the sight.
It started raining about midway through the battle, each strike of Thor's hammer echoing loudly, darker and darker clouds gathering above them, and by the time they finished, it was pouring.
The pavement of downtown New York City is still new from the last time something overpowered and angry slammed its fist into the ground, the sidewalks and streets pristine and smooth like an overnight snowfall no one's trudged through yet. From behind his shield, Steve watches a series of cracks web the pavement under the force of a flying car diving full speed into the center of the street, exploding in a fiery ball, glass exploding out from the buildings on either side.
"I'm being upfront," Tony says. "If I thought I'd done the right thing, I wouldn't be here, willingly signed up for a sound beating from the three of you."
"No SHIELD casualties!" Reyes smiles, approaching, giving a double thumbs up. "The bad guys are down, the good guys won!"
"So you cross lines with Pepper, alienate Rhodes, push me away, and everyone wins?" Steve asks, and Tony stiffens. Steve probably isn't supposed to know about that.
And Steve does.  Tony's legs over his shoulders, inch by inch, wrapping one hand around Tony's previously ignored cock, he slowly forces his way into the man, into his heat, into clenching warmth. Blindingly good.  "Perfect, Tony," he grits out.  God, and it is.
It takes Steve less than a minute to change, and another full one to make it around the sizzling arms, legs, heads and torsos, out into the hall of the apartment complex. Tony's solved his own shirtless conundrum with one of Sam's track jackets, zipped to just below his neck.
Bill hits it and pauses, before jerking free and continuing. Spider-woman soars into view, hoisting Luke Cage, who winds back, and then bounces off the corpse harmlessly, back into Jessica, and they fall to the street, rolling.
The false brick in the alley on forty-ninth street has been rotated - it's not quite Christmas morning anticipation, but it's up there, a very welcome distraction – and sure enough, a note is waiting for him.
"Damn it," Steve says, glancing up, and – yeah, the Punisher's dropping down the fire escape of the building across the street.
"Uh, Reed, don't you have like, twelve blob monsters in cages in here? That could be escaping right now?" Johnny says.
At three stories, Steve's eye level with Bill's shoulder, and he sees in particularly gruesome detail what decomposition does to a fifty foot corpse; the gaping wound in his chest has widened and weakened, dark, wet chunks falling with each step. A piece of cheek swings, loose and held on by threads, before breaking free and falling with a soft slap on the street below.
"Yes," Steve says. "But we're relocating the Helicarrier constantly, we've searched it, we've practically rebuilt it. He didn't leave anything behind." Frustrating and hard to believe, but it is what it is.
In one more thrust, he's in the rest of the way. Not too early, but he's normally more careful, slower, and Tony's breath hitches in surprise as he's folded in half.  Thrusting in brutal time with his strokes, both firm, both relentless, he fucks Tony.
"I asked Potts about it," he says. "Her exact words were, 'I wasn't going to put them at the risk of being important to Tony Stark.'"
Steve has to agree. The whole thing is a little odd, but. . . "It makes more sense than them having an interest in the New Jersey Mayoral election. And Mayor Dodd is benefiting from their targets . . ." he shrugs. They'd searched for other links, any possible ties to Red Skull, supernatural involvement. Nothing. It really appears to be nothing more than an especially dirty and bloody thug for hire job. More of the same for Crossbones, but Sin tends to need a bit more to hold her attention.
"Yeah, but what about them?" Steve laughs, he can still remember posing for most of those, feeling surreal on the other side of the easel, still new to the suit, and it had hung like a costume.  The first posters, of course, later they just had artists working from memory, exaggerating.  But the original ones where Steve had been told to put his hands on his hips, stare off into the distance.  Try his best to look
It's his easel.  It's the easel he woke up and found sitting in his bedroom on his tenth fourth of July.
"I'm sure Thor will have something to say about that," Don says, leading the Asgardian out of the apartment with light pats on the back.
"I know you, Tony. You tried to make me think I didn't, but I do. You came to my door because you knew I could help you," Steve says. And he did, and he's practically giddy with the realization that everything he's been lacking is coming back to him, piece by piece. "You told me that you wanted me."
Despite everything, Steve can't help the stab of pride. Gathering solid intelligence on Tony Stark is notoriously tricky; what Bucky's done required quite a bit of skill and even more patience. He's adapted to this time and place faster and better than Steve had, even today. "How long have you been watching him?"
He'll be embarrassed later, refusing to be distracted now, advancing slightly, and this time Tony doesn't fall back.   "Why should I stop? I do trust you."
"Simply put, it appears the one it's operating on now is some kind of panic button. A self-destruct," Reed says. "I would assume this is a failsafe, if the subject was to, well, lose it on the group that developed this. The subject would interpret 'self-destruct' as jumping off a bridge, or stepping in front of a train. Tony's . . . mind could be interpreting the command as this. But it's hard to give a definitive word, Extremis was in testing stages when Tony injected himself. This could be a malfunction. Maybe the prolonged use simply taxed the program? It could be a manifestation of self-destructive tendencies; the program could've started being unable to differentiate between subconscious Id urges, meant to be ignored, conscious thoughts, commands.
"No," Bucky says. "Ten months ago a Stark car came to their school and picked them up. Dropped them off in front of Stark Tower and had them wait in the lobby. Potts hasn't spoken to Stark since. She had been explicit that he have nothing to do with them."
Ripping open the pack of AAAs, he could. He switches on the light, maneuvers behind Tony, seeing for the first time the complexity of the device he's been making, aiming the beam it at Tony's nimble, quickly working fingers.
"I was – really out of it," Tony says again, apologetically. "I hadn't slept in days, I'd just gotten knocked around pretty hard. I barely laid down when– barely–" he sighs shakily. "I was just – I was confused. My armor– the armor is totaled. I wanted . . . I thought you'd know what to do."
"Mister Fantastic and Pym figured out a way to stabilize me," Jack says, a half smile. "No more fourteen hour days in a concrete cell, just," he points to a metal band on his wrist. A small display shows bright red, digital numbers counting down from forty-five minutes. "Wait for this to charge and I can use my powers, and not self-destruct. As soon as this finishes, I can help the rest of these guys."
"I'm assuming the location was discussed over SHIELD communications, which Osborn is apparently monitoring," Tony says. "And Osborn had that decommissioned and destroyed when he took over the world. I'm also assuming he didn't replicate it, as we're both still alive, and not two scorch marks."
Steve stares, then nods. "These kids are untrained. We want to try to disarm them before they kill themselves and anyone close enough to get caught in it. I'm going in. When it thins out, call down for the backup assault team, try to avoid casualties–"
"How have you been?" Jack of Hearts asks, taking his hand. The purplish-black sheen that once covered half of him has spread; his entire body is now that same inky, polished color. It gives him a strangely exotic look, although the solid white of both eyes is slightly unnerving. He must've been truly out of it to not have noticed the man as soon as he entered the lab; he's not exactly inconspicuous, and an Avenger, and had died. Twice.
The room is surprisingly quiet, before Hogun coughs, "With respect to your wishes, what would the Son of Odin say if I would like to fight Stark?"
Steve's stomach twists, and he surges forward, grabbing the commlink. "Rogers. Yes, she's taken care of. Status?"
Mainly practical ones, only noticeable to the person actually wearing it. Lighter armor, tighter pants. There are more pockets in the updated one, and it's thicker, a lot more durable.  The face mask is noticeably different, though; rather than wrapping around his chin, it goes straight back, like a swimmer's cap, bits of hair on the back of his neck showing through, as his neck itself is fully bare. The chain mail cuts higher across his chest, the wings are a lot more prominent.  He figures the easiest difference to spot will be the shield, though.
Steve's only gone a moment; there's a chain of fast food restaurants within walking distance. Tony's resting against the wall, device finished - actually polished, there's a real gleam despite its otherwise makeshift appearance – in front of him by the time he gets back, though. His head is tipped back, eyes closed, and one opens when Steve enters. He smiles, grabbing his bag of obscenely greasy fast food. "Thanks."
As soon as Steve launched into his apology, Tony’s fear melted away. This was the same Steve. His Steve. This version was even
“My brother will go after Thanos himself,” Loki was saying. “From what I hear, he will be frustrated that he didn’t kill him the first time. Which means he’ll try to draw him back to Midgard.”
As soon as he was physically able, Tony demanded that Steve bring him to Wakanda so that he could see the makeshift headquarters they had set up there. Steve knew that Tony just needed something to work on, something to
“Created the first skyscraper in New York that runs completely on renewable energy,” Peter pointed out.
The new plan was mostly the same plan, except that in addition to Thor’s army, Clint and Natasha’s backup, and the remaining soldiers’ best efforts, they would also be depending on Steve and Tony to sacrifice someone to get back the Soul Stone.
“We’ll get them back, right?” Bruce voiced Steve’s only thought for the last hour. “I mean - I know this looks bad, but this isn’t - it might not be permanent. We can still try to steal the Time stone back. Right?”
Steve inhaled. Exhaled. Something clicked in his brain, some deep-seated training from his Army days.
Peter groaned, and Ned said in a theatrical whisper, “Maybe he’s trying to get you to join the Fantastic Four!”
Life was another thing. You couldn’t place a value on a life. There was no way to make sense of any of it, really - time, life, love, loss. It just happened, and whoever was left had to deal with it.
It was an understatement: Tony was still shaking and sweating, sitting up now but looking the worse for wear. He had dark circles under his eyes; clearly he hadn’t gotten any sleep since being on that planet. He didn’t seem to realize it, but he was clutching Steve’s hand like a lifeline.
danced through his head as he stared at the drawing of a man and woman, both in old-fashioned uniforms, both stunning. He felt Steve shift beside him, probably not sure how to respond. “Are these – people you know?” They looked vaguely familiar to Tony – maybe Steve had drawn them from photos in a book or a museum.
May started to recount the timeline of events to Pepper, who wrote it down so they could share their notes with the police when they called.
Steve knew what she was saying. He had his reservations about reading Tony’s file, though. He managed to keep his curiosity at bay for about three days, and then he had lunch with Tony in the park, and – he had to know. He had to know if that version of Tony was the real one, or if that had all just been an elaborate con to make Steve think that – what? They could be friends? With the way that neither of them quite trusted each other and the fact that he was pretty sure Tony followed him to Central Park, it seemed unlikely. But Steve found that he wanted to get to know Tony Stark. There were more conventional ways he could do it, but he had a whole file of information at his fingertips.
The call quality sucked because of the snow, so Steve’s voice was clouded by static as he said, “Tony, I just saw on the news -”
“Hello? Hello? Tony, it’s Bruce, where are you?” A beat of frustrating silence passed, then another.
JARVIS muted the TV as the news anchor started asking for anyone who had information about the identity of Spider-Man to come forward to the police.
Steve still didn’t quite understand how the arc reactor worked or how he had invented it, and it was clear that SHIELD was a little fuzzy on the details as well. Clearly, Tony had worked hard to prevent the full story from becoming public. At least now Steve knew that he had been right not to ask about the arc reactor - he doubted Tony would enjoy discussing the time he spent kidnapped in Afghanistan.
“Only the handsome ones,” said Tony as he casually sat down next to Steve like hanging out in Central Park was something they did every day. “Whatcha got there?” He asked, glancing over to Steve’s sketchbook.
“No,” Tony cut him off, standing to face him. “I didn’t tell her anything. I wouldn’t do that. Because you’re a good kid and I trust you. Or at least, I thought I could trust you.”
The thing was, this had happened before. About a month ago, she had woken up at one in the morning and gone to use the bathroom. On her way back to bed, she noticed that Peter’s light was still on. Seriously, how much homework could one kid have? When she knocked, though, there was no answer. Assuming he’d fallen asleep, May opened the door intending to turn out the light. She found an empty room with an open window. That time, she had definitely panicked. She called Peter six times until he finally answered, sounding flustered at being caught out, and admitted he had snuck over to Ned’s house. When she asked why he didn’t just tell her where he was going (and leave out the front door like a normal person), Peter claimed he’d been trying not to wake her up. At the time, May had been so tired and relieved that she just accepted his explanation. She made him promise never to do it again, and reminded him that even if it was the middle of the night, he could always wake her up to tell her where he was going and she wouldn’t mind. Well, she would only mind a little. The whole situation was strange because Peter had never been one to sneak out, and it had bothered her for a while.
“No! No,” said Steve hurriedly. He was still partly convinced that she could read minds. Nat took a sip of wine to hide her smirk, and he rushed to say, “That’s not why I’m asking. I was just wondering if it was me.”
“You said to come home,” Peter mumbled. He was already starting to heal, Tony noticed. Underneath the layer of dirt and soot he had accumulated in the fall, the cuts and bruises were quickly fading away. While Tony was grateful for Peter’s spidey healing powers, he also worried that they meant the kid would never learn to avoid moments like this, because there weren’t really any consequences. It wasn’t that Tony wanted the kid to suffer, just - he needed to learn when to stay away from danger.
Tony shifted slightly in front of Peter as if that would hide him from sight. Unhelpfully, Peter just peeked around his shoulder.
Later that same day, when the interview was over, Peter came bounding into the lab like an excited puppy.
“How are we going to get Peter back without telling the world who he is?” Bruce asked, voicing everyone else’s thoughts.
“Man, what the hell is he doing here?” Sam asked, uncrossing his arms and moving to stand in front of Peter. Almost instinctively, Bucky mimicked his protective stance. Peter had to stand on his tiptoes to see between their shoulders now that they had created a barrier between him and their new guest.
The doors opened to reveal a group of anxiety-ridden teenagers waiting for their internship tour and interview. This time, though, Pepper didn’t mind so much.
Peter looked down at his shoes, avoiding Loki’s gaze and focusing instead on shimmery, mysterious ground beneath his feet.
Valkyrie took a drink from the flask that always seemed to be in her hand, then wiped her mouth. “It will take a miracle to defeat Thanos,” she said. She didn’t seem sad, exactly, just defeated - but, Steve supposed, Asgard had been dealing with loss for months now. “I’d like to believe it can be done, but unless this Stark is some sort of genius -”
the search for Spider-Man. He’s had people on the case for months trying to figure it out. I was going to tell him that someone tipped me off, and it’s all just a big prank, some kids who are spreading rumors. I feel just as strongly about protecting Peter as you do. He shouldn’t have journalists chasing him around or have to worry about being caught all the time.” Tony was skeptical, but even he had to admit Steve sounded genuine. “Tony, you don’t have to trust me. But you should know that I would never do that to Peter. It’s my job to report on the internship, okay? Nothing else. I wouldn’t do anything to put Peter in danger. I realize it sounded bad, but I was trying to keep him safe.”
“You know what the best part about this is?” MJ said conversationally as she, Pepper, May, and Tony watched it all. “Stupid Flash just lost his job.”
After a long moment when Steve just listened to Tony steady his breathing, Tony finally said, “I didn’t think we were speaking.” There was a moment of breathless silence as Steve slowly let go of his hand, and then Tony huffed a humorless laugh.
“The Soul Stone,” said Peter, realizing it. “Nebula said that her sister -” He glanced at Quill, then continued, “died, when Thanos went to get it.
Pepper’s smile was a little more genuine as she said, “This is Steve Carter. He’s a reporter with the
“- because he’s a journalist, but he has proven time and time again that he is not going to turn on us, okay?” Peter finally stopped pointing his finger and just looked a little lost, like he too had realized that he was starting to act like Tony. He took on a gentler tone. “I just think you’re being too cautious about this, Mr. Stark. I understand why you’re worried, but Steve is not a bad guy, I can just tell -”
Tony hadn’t been to Central Park in ages – mostly because he would be recognized – but he had flown over it a number of times, and it was always a sight to behold. Today, it was overflowing with family picnics and Frisbee players. It was sort of peaceful to walk through.
Tony actually gasped when Steve said it, a sharp little inhale that wouldn’t go unnoticed by the others.
“I do not believe we are dead,” T’Challa added. “I have seen the other side of life, and it does not look like this.”
"That it's to fulfill my boyfriend's prepubescent fantasy? No," he says.  "But they didn't ask too many questions, oddly."
"And there's still no word from Stark himself?" A picture of Tony, parallel with one of Iron Man, slides up. Stanch supporter of recently abolished SHRA is written across the bottom, for no apparent reason whatsoever.
"Congratulations," Steve says, and genuinely means it. Tony had devoted a lot of his resources toward trying to help Jack when they were on a team; Steve can't wait to tell him.
"Around the eyes," he nods, shimming his pants down.  "It's a different cut. More . . . old fashioned."
"But first!" Volstagg announces, putting a hand on both Steve and Tony's back companionably. "All civilized men call truce long enough for a feast before battle!"
He bolts after, dropping down, and is actually surprised to find her limp and unconscious on the ground – it didn't seem like it would be that easy.
"I lost the mansion," Tony says, unable to meet Steve's gaze. "Some private estate bought the property out from under me, I haven't been able to follow the plans for it. There's nothing of value to anyone else there. Hopefully they're just going to bulldoze it. Make a parking garage."
"Steve, you wouldn't be looking at me like -" he gestures, practically accusatory, at Steve's face. "Obviously I - I was compromised enough yesterday," he says this with clear, sheer disgust at his imagined, weak self. "To lie to you, tell you whatever you wanted to hear. I'm going to apologize now, and you're going to forget it happened, and - Steve, seriously, stop looking at me like that."
The Punisher's eyebrows actually fly up in surprise before settling back to the default. "I don't take orders from you."
Steve honestly wouldn't last much longer than Tony against three well-armed Asgardians with a grudge, but he doesn't think about it when Volstagg reaches down, gripping the hilt of his axe. He steps forward on instinct. Tony hadn't even processed the Asgardian's movement, starting at Steve's sudden shift, directly in front of him.
The rain's let up from the earlier battle, the sky's a gorgeous, clear sunset, and the lightning crack, as much as he expected it, is a little startling.
"Wait," Steve says. If it was an emergency, she wouldn't have used his phone. But she had, probably because he'd been too caught up to call her hours before, and he feels a faint stab of guilt, hoping she hadn't thought he'd given up on her.
Miss America had been one of his subjects. She was young and pretty, and didn't wear a mask; a lucky thing because her eyes were particularly captivating. She was one of the first caped heroes to head over to Germany, and needless to say, Steve was infatuated. She, like Steve, had spent her life weak and asthmatic and, unlike Steve at the time, a freak accident granted her super strength and the ability to fly. And, like Steve would, she used those abilities to help the troops. He absorbed any information he could get on her, newsreels and interviews printed in housekeeping magazines, a mix of desperate admiration and physical attraction.
"The smartest man I can have a prolonged conversation with," Steve amends. His communicator buzzes, and how he feels about this must be on his face, because Tony snorts out loud.
"I mean that. I mean this, I meant it, and I'll mean it again if you want me." A horrible thought strikes him, how had he not thought to ask? "You're not . . . seeing anyone currently, right?"
Tony pointedly avoids their gaze, stealing a quick, almost guilty glance at Steve before focusing on his chopsticks. He was willing to become that monster, Steve realizes. He'd been well aware of the slippery slope he was heading down, as long as he was the only one would fell. He's hit with a familiar mix of frustration and affection.
Steve's staring avidly at the device Reed handed him, which has switched from Processing . . . to Standby. The location spills across the display a second later, and Steve mouth works once in confusion.
But honestly, he's just bored.  None of the styles seem familiar, he feels no sense of connection with the endless piles of --
"Thanks," Steve says, forcing himself up. Pain doesn't distract, doesn't have the cutting edge it used to, but it can still slow him down. This time when he chucks his shield at the armor, it sinks in, and the armor shakes, sizzles, and falls from the sky. "No, he's out of commission. They're empty suits."
"Fifteen minutes ago, sir," he says, sliding in the passenger's side. Fifteen minutes. This can't be happening.
"A very well organized one," Tony says, dropping down cross-legged, opening boxes, ripping open plastic wraps with his teeth. "Their secret lair was lined with filing cabinets."
"Am I correct in guessing that you're unable to control your creation?" Hogun asks, gaze darting between the two of them. "Someone else is wielding it?"
Steve tracks down the highest ranking agent there – a level five – Agent West, who's handling the situation remarkably well.
"Monday! A glowing, possibly radioactive 'goop' began leaking out of the top floors of the Baxter Building, dripping onto pedestrians below. No side-effects reported as of yet, but the Fantastic Four's representatives urge those exposed to report to a local E.R., for further safety instruction. No word on whether the substance was gamma or not.
"Prince," Agent Prince, a tallish woman with long dark hair and height says, taking Steve's hand. "SHIELD's mapped some vulnerable locations in case of emergency evacs; schools, hospitals, shelters –"
"I assumed I was his only target," Tony says, pretty obviously thinking the same thing as Steve; where else has Osborn been shooting that thing?
He knows how to capture a person properly now, how to find those features that make someone unique and bring them out on paper, make it obvious to those who might miss them at first glance. Which might be why he can't seem to stop sketching Tony's hands.
"Originally, I was going to give it to the Young Avengers. I figured you've all got your own places now, they'd be better than this, you know, more advanced. Cause I went off the old floor plans, I didn't have them update anything," Jack is saying, arms out as he leads them down the familiar halls. He's right, it's eerily, perfectly similar. The same mahogany woods, the same tall doorways, the same layout.
The LMDs make a satisfying crunch when they go down, crackling and popping, and the sound follows him across the living room.
Very aware this isn't a secure line, he chooses his next words carefully. "It went badly. We almost lost people."
"You sound unrepentant," Fandral says. "You speak of how this process is monstrous, yet of its uses in the same breath."
"Almost two hours." He closes his eyes when he takes a bite, moans, and it makes Steve hungry again just watching. Tony licks each finger before using a napkin when he finishes, and the sight is so comfortable and companionable it distracts him enough that he actually needs a minute to figure out what Tony's referring to when he suddenly starts speaking again, tone just mildly defensive.
Steve wants to tell him to stay behind, try and sober up; he's of no use like this. But honestly, he's not willing to let him out of his sight. They make their way to the neighboring roof, Tony actually slumping against him in the elevator down, and he needs a healthy amount of encouragement to make it into the next hotel, up that elevator, and Steve more or less manhandles him up the service ladder to the roof.
"I was really out of it," Tony says. His hands are clasped tightly in front of him, as if this were an interrogation.
"Tony?" Steve asks, when the man has a hard time pulling himself upright, staying slumped against the wall. By the time Steve gets there, puts a hand on his back, Tony's passed out.
There's a team of SHIELD agents in full riot gear setting up a makeshift base on the corner that visibly cheer at Steve's approach.
was . . . safe to think about. He was so far from my reality -- almost a fantasy.  I didn't want to think about a
Before Steve can answer, You weren't that bad, really, Tony's fingers drop, going slack, and he falls, limply, to his knees.
"Shit–" Tony says suddenly, flinging himself back, slamming into Steve's side, scrambling to regain his drunken balance. Steve immediately sees why; a large, green hand is coming up from over the side, the metal of the door bending and cracking under its grip, finally popping open under its weight. Steve struggles to keep the car upright as Hulk clings to it in midair.
"It was working from scratch then," Maya says. "I gave it a blue print it can just revert to. A last save point."
Hogun and Fandral both have to duck to make it through the door. Volstagg, larger than life, has to bend, squish and eventually force his way through, sideways. The customers, well acquainted to the havoc that tends to accompany gigantic people dressed in bright colors, thin out as the Asgardians take their seats, murmuring to each other in vague approval at the plastic plants and bland wallpaper.
"It's . . . changed," he repeats, sounding distracted. "A deviant, latent code. It's giving a series of commands, and is using Tony's mind to execute them."
It's not as bad as that, really. There are good points, but it's hard to think of them in a silent, empty home, after a one-sided conversation with an answering machine. It's a different world, with different messes, and the people – person that should be helping him catch up is probably deleting his messages without listening to them.
He's on-call until then, ready to meet Sin at her next appearance within minutes, which equals living beside his communicator. He rinses out his mug, looks out at the dark purple sky and considers the advantages of taking the north side on his morning jog; it's longer, but then he'll get to circle the park.
"If he thought that he knew better, he would," Bucky says. "Stark was pushed to a lot of limits while you were gone. He might not be the Iron Man you remember."
Tony processes that with a blank expression, stepping backward as a Hill lunges, then holding it still for Steve to smash to the floor. " . . . Why?"
He looks miles more out of place than the three warriors. He has a level of nobility they lack, and it makes him standing in the middle of a Chinese buffet, hands in fists at his side, head nearly scraping the ceiling, more ludicrous.
They wait for a moment in expectant silence, but the doorway and balcony stay empty. They both take in the wreckage of Sam's once- cozy apartment. The endless pile of crackling, busted- up bodies cover some of the damage, but not enough to hide the busted furniture, punctured walls, smashed windows and balcony door.
"The obvious," Tony says, laying back, lifting his hips for Steve's slick fingers.  "Plus, it just seemed painful.  I was almost fifteen before figur--aahh," Tony's eyes shut, thrusting back on Steve's hand, hips moving in uncontrolled jerks. "Yes, before figuring that out."
Steve sits across from him, grabbing the packages wrapped in the thicker, impossible to open plastic and ripping. "How long do you think this will take?"
"I believe you," and he'd logically decided as much, but only realizes how much he really means it once it's out of his mouth. "I'm just trying to figure out what we're up against."
"And you may have my shield, little man of iron," Volstagg says, dropping two tons of metal at Tony's feet. "It's not your preferred metal, but it will stand to task."
"And you made a twin of a god?" Volstagg says, deep, rumbling voice sounding surprisingly childlike in a sort of wonder.
There are a few differences between his current Captain America suit and the original one, the one he posed in.
"Is there any way to tell if there will be further attacks, if we should be advising our viewers to stay home today?"
"I mean, we're fine. Power's back," and as he says it, the streets around them come to life with a sudden burst of noise, dozens of small chirps and buzzes and hums, deafening, but only for a moment, then it settles back into the regular background noise of the city, a spirit that the previous silence lacked. The dull plastic of a Coca Cola advertisement turns bright, neon red, stoplights and signs, alarms from the various buildings that have been utterly demolished sluggishly howling. "What's the status down there?"
"He wants her to make this attack look good. And he's going to get exactly what he paid for. I'm here in case you stop her from putting a bullet between his eyes," he lifts the polished black metal, barrel to the sky; it's gorgeous in the light "I'll finish the job she started."
"Reed? You there?" Steve says. "It'd be really nice if you could start that purging thing you were talking about!"
"It's –" odd, working with SHIELD, but without Sharon. In a bad way, a wrong way; the liaison that replaced her, Agent Reyes, is a nice enough kid, but not quite the capable, intelligent agent he'd grown used to having his back . . . and this is going down all sorts of gloomy, possibly guilt-tripping paths, so he just sighs.
"Tomorrow," Steve prompts, escorting him to the door. There'll be another disaster they'll be trying to explain tomorrow.
"Steve!" Jack. Jack dives down next to them, practically buzzing, Steve drops his hand, which he only just realizes was still on Tony's wrist. "And Tony, both of you, perfect. I just finished helping the Fantastic Four, so I can show both of you at the same time."
Reyes eyes go round, either realizing his mistake or just his usual reaction to Steve's frustration, following after him. "Well – we weren't supposed to contact you, over the radio, before a mission – the – the problem, they didn't want it leaking to Sin that you're coming–"
Volstagg pauses at that, eyes crinkling in laughter. "Warrior's tic and nothing more, good man. We are sporting enough to give forewarning before our reckoning. I take it you are willing to battle on behalf of your . . . ill-prepared comrade?"
Steve stares, and a Hill lands its fist in his gut because of it. He grunts, grabs it by the arm and flings it out the already busted glass doors, down three stories. "That doesn't count as giving up; I really was dead."
Crossbones snickers at their feet, a hairy, nude reminder that this really isn't the place, and Steve very carefully does not look down.
"You were in there, Tony." He'll mourn his possessions eventually, on a case by case basis. When he begins looking for a dog-eared book, only to remember it's gone. Paintings. Journals. Letters. But now, all he can think about is how Tony nearly got himself killed again, and how Steve nearly had a hand in it. How he knew it was a risk, and he lied about it. Steve could've – probably done nothing about it, but he could've known. "I sent men here. The Maria Stark Foundation couldn't reimburse me for that."
"We found her, Reed!" Johnny Storm, rushing into the room. Behind him is a blonde – behind him is Maya Hansen with dyed hair. Her scar is gone. Johnny's always been obvious when he's interested, and Steve momentarily amuses himself imagining Maya's face when Johnny inevitably hits on her. "Maya Hansen, Mister Fantastic."
Tony can eat like a refined man, with small, polite bites of delicate cuisine; Steve's seen him do it at countless official functions. But alone like this, he makes a monster of his cheeseburger, taking it apart, squeezing each packet Steve brought of ketchup, mustard and relish onto the bun, and Steve hands over his onions without being asked. Tony would add more, if it were at all possible, but the condiments table had been thin.
"Reyes," Steve says. "Breathe. You have them outnumbered, I've seen you at hand to hand combat, you can hold your own. I'm going to get up there as soon as I can but –"
“I guess none of that matters now, does it?” He lifted his gaze, and the pain was visible in the way his eyes danced back and forth across Steve’s face. “God, it seems so petty now. And to think I was out there feeling guilty about getting the kid involved and Rhodey and then - I mean, the kid’s just gone. Just like that.” He snapped his fingers. “None of it mattered.”
“Peter’s being weird,” Tony mentioned to Bruce in the lab late one evening when they had both had too much coffee to sleep. “He left like five minutes after he got here today.”
As she approached the border, no one seemed to know what to do, until Thor suddenly shouted out and ran toward her. Apparently realizing that she couldn’t see him, he gestured to Okoye to lift the barrier. “She’s a friend!” It was the first time anyone had seen Thor smile since he arrived in Wakanda. It was the first time Steve could remember anyone smiling at all in three long days.
“What’s wrong, sweetheart?” She had asked, pulling him into a hug. Even if it was nothing more than a tough day at school, she wanted him to know that she was always there for him, no matter what. She wished he would open up to her more but she also knew she couldn’t force it.
She raised an eyebrow. “Well, then, I hope you find him.” She took another drink. “And I hope he knows what he’s doing.”
Slowly, Tony sat down as the wave of anxiety passed, landing on the couch. Steve knelt in front of him, never looking away or taking his hand off of his shoulder, a solid point of contact. Tony belatedly realized that Steve was also holding his wrist, checking to see if his pulse was back to normal. “Listen, Tony,” said Steve carefully once Tony seemed to have recovered. His gaze dropped to the arc reactor, then flickered back up. “I know you’ve been through a lot lately.”
Steve wasn’t naïve enough to think that Tony wasn’t fishing for information with that one. He was equal unsubtle in changing the subject. He nodded toward a young woman with blue hair. “She wants to be an artist, but her parents want her to go to law school.”
While they couldn’t speak for every galaxy in the universe, the galaxies they had visited were devastated by Thanos. The planets they saw were the same as Earth: Eerily quiet and desolate, or worse. As a result, they were unable to garner much support. The likelihood of reaching Thanos by word of mouth was slim. Unfortunately, it seemed that Thor’s optimistic plan to rally the universe around a common cause was unlikely to succeed. They would either need to keep searching the galaxies for him ad infinitum, or come up with a new plan.
