Sherlock hesitated. If he said no, John might stop. If he said no, John might keep fucking him, anyway. Sherlock didn’t want to find out. “Yes, John,” he breathed.
Don’t you understand why I had to do it? Why I had to lie to you and leave you? Please understand. I had no choice. I should probably tell you that I’m not dead, not really.
Why are you a slave, Sherlock? Why have you been treated like this? Why won’t you trust me? “Why?” John asked. “Why shouldn't I be kind to you, that is." His mouth pressed into a firm line.
Sherlock's eyes widened for a split second before he followed his instruction. John had never considered himself a masochist, never even thought about it before, but God did that flash of sudden terror in Sherlock's eyes do things to him, even if it lasted only a second.
Footsteps thud thud thud up the stairs past the door of our flat. I know in the slightest fraction of a second that they are yours. I would recognize your steps anywhere.
“Right,” Sherlock said, and turned to grab something from the counter behind him. He swung back around with an empty beer bottle in his hand. “And this,” he began, “this was our suspect’s. I was able to find trace materials on it that have remnants of both the poison and the drug.”
The two laid in John’s bed after it was done, both pretending to sleep and knowing the other was still awake. John hated this game.
Tangled opposites and tangled ivy. I want to tangle our bodies. I want to be wrapped in you. You, everywhere. I could wear your skin like a coat; I think I would like that. I would ask you, but you’d say no, and I’d kill you if I skinned you.
(You attempt to stitch yourself into my life, but can’t you understand that all you’re doing is fraying ripped seams? The rain chills its way through me, would be freezing my heart had that vital part of my anatomy not already been destroyed.)
But I don’t say anything at all. Which leads you to roll your eyes and sigh loudly, exasperatedly. You stood up at some point, and are now wondering towards the desk, fingers flittering through stacks of papers, eyes skimming closed cases. Cases I had no choice but to do alone.
"You've got it the wrong way around, Dr. Watson, Sir. I am the slave. I take care of you, do whatever pleases you, and whatever you bid me to do. I know you were drawn to me immediately upon seeing me, but the question is why? The rest of them, they made you uneasy. Too used perhaps—too broken? But I, I was still my own person. What I've already endured couldn't break me down, and maybe you won't be able to either. You saw that, chose me, and here we are. I want to know if I am your challenge. I don’t know what your strategy is, but I am not one easily broken. You've been kind to me, regarding the moment when we first arrived. You shouldn't be.”
This didn’t mean anything, sleeping together—not sleeping together, just… sleeping in the same bed. This didn't declare that John had feelings for his gorgeous flatmate. No, of course not. Maybe.
He trails his fingertips along the wallpaper. As he leans onto the final stair, the wood beneath him creaks, and the violin halts on a ringing note.
I hope you like John's letter! Also, thank you so much for reading my fanfic. It would make my day if you spent a second or two leaving feedback (:
"You understand that this, John Watson, is an honour? This is a reward for your service to our country."
John stood from his laptop when a knock resounded from the door of the flat. A sandy-haired woman appeared in the doorway. She was short, with blue eyes identical to John’s. Sherlock’s eyes flickered towards her, then back towards his book.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and fell back against the chair he sat in, exasperated. “Of course you wouldn’t. Righteous John Watson,” he mocked. “No matter what’s going through you’re head right now, I can tell you that it’ll happen eventually. I’d bet anything on it. You’re all the same.”
“It’s been alright,” She said. Her eyes flickered around the flat, taking everything in. Then they widened. “You’ve got a slave, John?”
But that makes you the opposite of me. And the opposite of ordinary. And the opposite of bad, while bad is the opposite of good. Which is anything but me and everything but ordinary. Let’s be a mangled web of ivy climbing and clinging to the solidity of our flat. Confusing and twisting and tangling and pointless and oddly wonderful. Metaphors are tedious. I bore myself.
John stopped. “There you go. Finished. I’ll just need to redress your back for the next week or so.”
The man released his grip on Sherlock, breaking the kiss with a sloppy smack. Sherlock shot fervent glances towards John, silently willing him to put an end to this. John seemed checked out. Not paying too close of attention, not participating, but still the reason any of this was happening. The slave could see not only wolf man’s pants beginning to tent, but the other two men’s as well.
Mary is dependable, sweet, charming, domestic, and normal. Everything I never could be. Mary is adventurous, dangerous, thrilling, and intelligent. Everything I know you can’t live without. Mary is not life-threatening, a sociopath, obsessive, rude, obnoxious, a freak, incapable, or inexperienced. I am. It’s simple. I should’ve known all along that it never would have been me.
Sherlock's words were rigid. "So you've changed your mind then." His fingers began jerking once more at the buttons of his grey shirt.
Sherlock maintained his now-neutral demeanor, looked at John, said, “Yes, I guess you could call it that.”
At first, all it was was a chaste brush of lips. Sweet, safe. Then you looked at me with the incorruptible emotions of your eyes. They were blue like they are when you wake up in the middle of the night: dark, dark blue. (Was I your nightmare? Finally?)
John opens the final barrier separating him from the man he knows will be standing on the other side of the door. And he is.
He shouldn’t read the letters, he knows that much. But John Watson is only human, and he is undeniably curious.
John just needed sleep. That was it. So, with stiff movements and a generous amount of throat-clearing, John slide into bed next to Sherlock.
John would be fucking him, and Sherlock would want, simultaneously, to tell him to stop, to push him away, and to pull him closer and tell him he never wanted it to end. Emotions, Sherlock decided, were not his area.
Sherlock closed his eyes and let out a short, breathy laugh. "You'd be surprised how this can change people, Sir, slavery.”
“I thought you might like wearing it… you know…” John cut in, eyes glancing towards Sherlock’s neck. “And the colour—“ John paused. “Suits you.” He rubbed the back of his neck.
Your lips tighten in annoyance. Please forgive me if I don’t talk much at times, John. It’s loud enough in my head.
John Watson was uncomfortable. Probably more so than he had ever been in his lifetime. He stood in the middle of a plain room, much resembling a doctor’s office, with only one instruction.
"Just... nothing." John shrugged it off and sighed. "No big deal. I'm gonna wash up, then. Don't go running off."
“Yeah, she is,” John responded, just as Sherlock said “Aha!” and lifted his phone from under a small pile of scribbled-on papers.
So John, unable to refuse or argue any more, turned towards the options presented to him. He leaned on his cane and observed. There were some women: his age, perhaps a few years younger, and definitely pretty. Their heads hung, gazes trained on the ground. Maybe... John thought, but he was quick to correct himself.
Christ, Sherlock, can’t it all be pretend? Please. For me, just come back once more. You’ve eluded death twice before, and I know they say third time’s the charm, and I know that this time you are definitely not coming back to me. Sherlock. I need you. You said you were my chaos, and that I can’t live without you. Well you were right, you always are.
Sherlock stood up, stepping over towards Harry and John. “You’re John’s older sister, Harriet Watson, obviously. Just out of rehab for being an alcoholic, the initial decision for going there begin almost entirely made by John and your boyfriend. You were not very happy about it, at all. The two of you haven’t seen each other for at least a year and a half, after you went to rehab. Your boyfriend just recently broke up with you, too. My condolences,” Sherlock listed, snarling.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I was saying, we only need to get her purse and we can tell if the drug was ever in her possession before she was killed.”
John's eyes flickered towards Sherlock, quickly looking back down at the book he held in quivering hands. John’s eyes were red-rimmed, but Sherlock refused to deduce what on earth it meant.
Sherlock didn’t know what to make of it. He felt some part disappointment, some part confusion. Mostly relief, he realized. Boundaries had been reestablished; a dysfunctional sort of routine could resume.
John scoffed. “I thought you’d been bloody shot, Sherlock, you idiot.” And his voice was the temperature of morning tea.
He raised the calloused fingertips of his right hand, pressed a thumb gently to Sherlock’s back, and began to trace his scars. Sherlock flinched, but, after a second, leaned slowly and cat-like into John’s touch. He pressed his palms onto the back of the chair that sat before him.
“…Are these letters?” You ask, holding three envelopes of varying wear addressed with an unmistakable ‘John Watson.’
John stood from his seat in the kitchen, causing his chair to screech across the floor. "I don't know why I bloody put up with you," he growled. “I never bloody wanted you in the first place!” He walked towards Sherlock, whose eyes were drawn suddenly to John's cane left resting against the table. Definitely psychosomatic, then. "You think you can just keep acting like this? I'll do nothing about it, yeah?” His voice was so low it was nearly a whisper.
The next morning Sherlock woke up in John’s bed, one of the man’s arms resting on his chest. Bruises along his hips were blue-green with the memory of John’s fingertips. The melody Sherlock composed on his violin later that day was blue-green, as well, and John hummed along, and that tugged a small smile out of Sherlock’s lips.
I can’t take your narrowed, calculating glare, so I stand up and move to the window, choosing rather to gaze at the narrow street instead of your winsome face. This way, it might hurt less, your visit.
You see, Sherlock, if I just followed you out into the rain… if I stayed along your side like I always should have… if I just kept you from chasing the bastard down and convinced you to stay with me, you’d be sitting across from me on your chair. You might be playing me your violin and I would be grinning like an idiot because I love you.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Of course not. They’ve forced me to have sex with them." The slave’s answer was as straightforward as he had presented himself the entire day, but John noticed his shoulders tighten and jaw muscles tense. His eyes looked, just for a fleeting second, so vulnerable. The moment passed. “Beaten me, maybe, too. When they felt like it. That was always such an enamoring pastime. ”
Romanticized and nauseatingly poetic, you are a lighthouse. If you failed to stay near me, John, I would crash and sink and burn and die. In every way I could. On purpose? Probably.
Sherlock’s lips became a humourless smile, and his voice was soft but detached. “It’s not your fault, John.”
I don’t know how I am going to write a letter to you, now. But you wrote me letters, and this is all I can do in return for everything you did for me. I miss you so incredibly much. This is a letter of everything I wish I had told you. Everything I wish you had said.
The deep rumble of a voice filled the space between them. “I don’t mind.” A soft, deep, rumbling whisper of a voice. Like distant thunder. Oh, Sherlock.
John got up, uncomfortable with the path his mind was taking. He walked into the sitting room feeling anxious. Would everything be different between them now, after the intimacy of last night?
You should hate me, because really, it wasn’t him that shattered and ravaged our life. No, it was me. I’m a prolonged explosion, deconstructing and devastating everything I encounter with precise slowness. Even you. The thought makes me hate myself. Like you must hate me now.
That t-shirt looked soft, so very soft. John wanted to run his fingers along it. Because it looked soft, definitely not because a still, sleeping, beautiful Sherlock was wearing it. Beautiful? He meant… platonically handsome.
“I thought—I had this image of you running around Europe, around the whole damned world; you with your, your bloody coat, taking down terrorists with your cleverness, alright? I had no idea…” John’s voice dimmed.
I was breathing deeply. You were quiet. Until you spoke. “Forget that, Sherlock. Delete it, do whatever you… do. I’ve got to get back home. Night.” Your voice was stern. The home you were talking about was not 221B Baker Street.
I hum in response. Why are you here, John? Shouldn’t you be with Mary? Your expecting wife? This is odd. We haven’t seen each other in weeks now. I wonder what you’ve been doing—if you’ve been getting into enough trouble.
The hotel room had only one bed. It struck John as they stood in the doorway. Yeah, the pub owners said it was all that was left. John said fine. Now he realized what exactly one bed meant...
Tendrils of sleep dragged the whirring gears of John’s mind to a stop as he drifted into subconsciousness with a final image repeating repeating repeating: Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock didn't acknowledge the order, but began anyway. The music started softly, harmonizing with the pattering of raindrops. It was a sad song, no doubt. Something John had never heard before. Had Sherlock created it himself? Just now? He watched Sherlock close his eyes as he played.
But, John. It’s only fair to inform you of another desire. If you had to die, we all do in the end, I want to be the one killing you. I want you to know your life is in my hands and still trust me and I want to be the last thing you see with your beautiful eyes. I want you to love me enough to let me do that, but only if you had to die.
Sherlock winced, and without a logical thought in his mind, he slid into the bed next to John. His willpower crumbled with every fraction of movement. The retired soldier’s eyes flashed open. A light sleeper. Sherlock tucked the information away into his mind, the spot reserved for Dr. John Watson.
The man’s rich voice struck John speechless. He coughed uneasily. “I was—no, I… you were different. Real. You were… alive?”
I miss your eyes. When I was with Mary, you were always closing them, as if it hurt to look at things. I should have noticed then, but I was so blatantly oblivious. Nowadays, every detail of you clouds my brain cells. That face you made when you heard of an interesting case or the one you’d make when I was so frustratingly ordinary or when nobody understood the intelligent jumble spilling from your lips.
“Don’t call me that,” John muttered. He wouldn’t let himself become that sort of monster. The voice in the back of his head made another unwanted appearance. What's stopping you from taking him, right here, right now? It's legal. You don’t need to care about him.
"Does it matter?" Sherlock snarled, squeezing his eyes shut. "There's nothing I can do. I'm not even my own person any more. I couldn't matter."
“This concerns me in what way?” Sherlock snapped, looking up from the medical textbook he held open in his lap.
"Surely you can't be that bothered by such sleeping conditions for a single night. You were an army soldier, John."
Sherlock only half-turned, reaching his arm out behind him while staying focused on the paper before him. “Could you text Scotland Yard for me?” he asked. “Tell them we need the victim’s purse. It’s small, and I doubt it has a shoulder strap. They’ll have it.”
Can we grow ivy, John? Stupid question. Ivy is senseless and pointless and oddly wonderful. No, I am not a sentimental man, and I will not ask for verdure because it triggers thoughts of you. Us. Our tangled opposites.
(I know I don’t have enough time left to call you. Will you miss me? I can barely muster the strength to press a few feeble buttons on my phone to dial the police. An ambulance will come too late to save me, but soon enough to try. Pain shoots through my body, my transport, pumping in sync with my pulse. I can’t keep my eyes open. I can’t keep my mind rational. Fantasies and realities collide. I am everywhere with you, before I realize that I am nowhere but here. Alone.)
John hesitated just long enough for Sherlock to turn his head and look at him, look down at his outstretched hand, and press his lips into a firm line.
(An email the killer’s brother’s electrician forgot to delete solidified that the killer would be right here, right now. So where is he? A gunshot echoes, and my question is answered.)
John was glad Sherlock was focused on rummaging through the contents of his small case instead of noticing the faint flush that rose to John's cheeks. "No, I didn't mean it like that, it's just—“
“Sherlock,” John groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Just show me your fucking back, alright?”
I don’t understand it, and it’s driving me mad. Sod it, I’m already fucking crazy. You know that, and you are sleeping in the same flat as me. You trust me. Why? You shouldn’t trust me, I’m a sociopath.
John reached for the phone, and his eyes caught on a raised, rough band of pink skin that stuck out against the detective’s pale wrist. He noticed a trail of harsh, round marks that made their way up the soft skin of his arm.
(You aren’t here alongside me in the London streets, you wouldn’t come with me, you didn’t choose me. I should obstruct you from invading my mind. I am on a case. I am on a case.)
“He was furious; I was furious and young and stupid. I got it figured out for myself for a while, until I didn’t. He knew when I became indentured. He knew when I was given these tattoos, when I got my first master,” Sherlock spat the last word. “He could’ve fixed it, and he didn’t do a thing.”
John pressed his lips together, cleared his throat once more for good measure, and continued, looking up to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “I brought you this.”
And John, oh how I feel. I feel hatred, and loathing—for myself, who can never be normal for you—and anger, and jealousy, and betrayal—why do you love her?—and love, and such longing and yearning for something that never could have been. Why couldn’t it have been?
When John wandered into the living room the next morning, he saw Sherlock lying on the couch, fingers steepled against his lips as if he were whispering prayers to a higher being, but Sherlock was the type of man who believed only in himself.
John gripped the base of the riding crop, brining it down onto Sherlock's back with a deafening snap. He shouldn't enjoy doing this. Thwack. This was so wrong. Thwack. Thwack. Jesus Christ, what was he turning into? Crack. A monster. Sherlock leaned forward onto the heels of his hands from the force of the whip. His back dripped thin streams of blood onto the flat’s tattered rug, and his eyes stung. It took every ounce of self-control to keep from shouting, from screaming, from turning on John Watson and slamming him into the wall.
Sherlock’s new scarf twisted around his neck, successfully hiding the only thing distinguishing himself from the free public. 03172. The taller man’s new coat fit neatly, and John couldn’t help but feel like something—albeit small—something was finally going right as they strode down the sidewalk. Sherlock strode actually. John… trotted alongside.
John catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror over the mantel, and he isn’t old and wrinkled and grey. No, John Watson can barely be forty. He’s the same age he was during the years he spent with Sherlock, wearing his favourite sandstone-coloured jumper he had lost years ago.
Sherlock stopped playing abruptly when John entered the room, swiveling to face him and flinching in pain. John noticed immediately that Sherlock wasn’t wearing the blue bathrobe or the normal clothes that John bought him after the first few days. He was wearing that damned slaves’ uniform.
Sherlock was in no position to say no, and he wasn’t sure he’d want to even if he could. “John,” he murmured into the man’s mouth, grateful it was that name he was breathing among others he’d whispered in the past. Stubble grazed raw lips and pale cheeks.
Sherlock lifted his hands from John’s and began unbuttoning his white shirt. John watched, not knowing what he was feeling. Shame, maybe. Guilt or sorrow.
He walked past John, straight to the window, where he pulled back the sheer curtain and looked out over the street.
The letters come with an epiphany of sorts, clear as day. John Watson knows now that he loves Sherlock Holmes. He always has.
John stared at Sherlock, shirtless, kneeling in front of him. He couldn't deny that Sherlock, well fed and healthier-looking, was bloody attractive. His eyes traced the scars of welts and words covering the white expanse of leanly muscled back. Never would he have thought that he'd be adding to the collection, but now it seemed like the only logical thing to do. The only desirable thing to do. A sick realization clouded his mind as the voice in his head screamed that this was what John wanted all along.
John hung up his coat, walked over to his laptop, and sat down into his chair. He began typing responses to some emails, and asked across the room, “Do you believe in God, Sherlock?”
What are you without me? Because I think I am your chaos. The thing about chaos, John, is that while it disturbs us, it too, forces our hearts to roar in a way we secretly find magnificent.
Still, Sherlock’s low groans quickened to short gasps of sticky air. John came on him, cursing, and a few pumps later Sherlock was quick to follow. They caught their breaths in the dim London flat.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Good morning, Sir,” he said in deceiving calmness. John could nearly taste the hidden bitterness behind his slave’s words. So nothing had changed, had it? What did he even expect to be so different? The tenderness of last night was a slip in the charades, nothing more.
It took only a second after quick greetings for the the four of John’s old friends to raise their eyebrows at Sherlock, to immediately notice the tattooed number on his neck, of course.
Thunder caused our flat to convulse. Our lips met with corresponding intensity. So soon it was your calloused fingers in my hair and your sturdy hand on my waist. I gripped your shoulders and your arms like I was afraid of falling. You can’t blame me. Your tongue was in my mouth and my tongue was in your mouth and no matter how clearly I remember it, it’s still just a blur.
Sherlock didn't respond, just leaned down and opened the case the second John's grip loosened. He lifted the instrument carefully, as if he were touching a lover. A creep of sudden jealousy tugged at John’s mind before he shook it unceremoniously away. For Christ’s sake, jealous of a violin?
“Just be nice,” Sherlock sneered. “I was right, wasn’t I? It was a threat.” He turned towards the kitchen, no intention of making tea. “Did I get anything wrong?” He asked casually over his shoulder.
Then something caught his attention. John wasn't just whimpering, or screaming, even, like he sometimes did. John was talking. Sherlock couldn't hear the exact words through the door, so he got up, treading softly to the bedroom, trying not to groan aloud with every step. His back was worse than he had thought.
“Let me know if you ever need anything!” the restaurant owner finished, with a final, hearty pat on Sherlock’s back.
John lifted his hand, which held a bag. Sherlock stepped forward, and his footfalls seemed intrusively loud in their silence.
John pulled back his hand and allowed himself to readjust a bit. He curled over onto his side: uncomfortable. Tried the other: bothered his shoulder. He stretched out a bit: no, too risky he’d touch Sherlock in his sleep. Curled to one side again—
His breathing picked up when he heard the first of three zippers open. Flashes of memories ricocheted through his mind. Nightmares. Too soon, the fingers were tangled at the back of his head once more.
Also--because of this chapter and the chapters I'm planning to have follow, I've raised this fic from Teen and Up to Mature audiences. Have fun ;)
She smirked, turning to Sherlock, who lounged on the couch. “Get me some tea—us some tea.” Her voice held that hollow command, the sort that showed she wasn’t in the position or had the permission to boss around slaves often.
"Tell me why you did it," Sherlock said, his deep voice strong and unwavering despite how helpless he was.
Let me give you a piece of advice, if you ever have need of it. I doubt you will; you’re good with a gun.
Nobody would meet his eyes; everything about this seemed wrong. He was unnerved by the blank, emotionless submission of them all. All, that was, except for one.
"No," John said slowly, drawing out the vowel. "I won't. I can't treat someone like this." He wiped the dried blood off of the slave's back, proceeding to clean the wounds. The infected cuts made his stomach churn.
He looked at John Watson, his hooded eyelids and reddened, greedy lips, and John Watson’s face screamed “Lust.”
“And who is this with you?” The restaurant owner asked with his lips quirked to a corner. He gestured to the window table.
Ps. I was listening to Take Me To Church by Hozier while writing. If you like alternative music, I'd definitely give it a go (:
Sherlock's gaze was challenging, and John couldn't take it anymore. He hurried to the hallway cupboard, grabbing the duffel he'd thrown in their first night back. He hadn't wanted to look inside at the time, and so it remained unmoved. Now things were different. He shuffled through the contents, teeth gritted. Handcuffs, a second gray uniform, dear lord was that a collar? There, the riding crop.
The rest of the day passed by in uneventful slowness. John made tea. Sherlock sat on the couch. Snide remarks were exchanged. The two watched crap telly for a bit, John constantly shifting in his chair and shooting sidelong glances at the statue of a man sitting on the couch behind him. After a period of time, Sherlock spoke. "What?" he snapped.
Calloused hands moved smoothly over Sherlock's thighs and hips and stomach and brushed over his nipples. Flashes of memories swamped Sherlock’s mind. His breathing picked up with the panic that crowded his senses. Control yourself, Sherlock told himself. You're stronger than this. You've dealt with worse... But this was John doing this to him, and somehow that made it so much worse.
Sherlock figured that was the end of it, the first and last time. Sherlock figured it was some mistake John made—deprived of sex one day too long, having had one glass of wine too many. Sherlock’s theory was validated when, the next morning over tea, John told him, “That won’t happen again.” And he apologized, and he gave Sherlock a quiet, trying smile.
The two kept walking, breath fogging in the chill of the evening.  Light spilled from the sidewalk window of the restaurant, and John lifted his hand from his coat pocket to hold the door open for Sherlock.
It would only be a matter of time before John's personality began to shift, Sherlock knew. Owning another human? It does awful things to a person. Power and control do terrible things. No, Sherlock wouldn't let himself grow to care for John Watson. Soon enough, John's mind would snap into place and Sherlock would be nothing to him. A piece of furniture. A source of meaningless pleasure. Soon enough, John would treat him like the slave that he was. That was a fact. He wouldn't let himself get attached.
“John, go check on Sherlock. Make sure he didn’t blow himself up or something,” I mock. “Go make sure he isn’t high again, yeah? Because he’s so fucked up without you.”
John reached out with shaky hands, and he placed them on Sherlock's hips. He could feel Sherlock’s body heat through the thin, silky fabric. This isn't wrong. This isn't wrong. The mantra in his mind rang clearly. He's your property. He doesn't matter. He's your property. His purpose is your pleasure.
I am such a selfish man. You should hate me. I’m acutely astounded you don’t, always have been. That’s what differs you from the despicable ordinary, John. You’re such the opposite. When you look at me, your eyes lack hatred and disgust and revulsion. No, you’re kind.
John walked over to the detective, who didn’t react to John’s footfalls. The martyr who stood, turned away, as still as a statue.
"Alright, Sherlock... Don't you have a last name then?” No response. God, he felt daft. Slaves hadn't last names.
“You were not ‘bestowed upon me’,” John said. “You were dumped on me. I didn’t have much of a choice, either, alright?”
Choose from the ten or so men and women standing in a line facing him? John couldn't make himself do it. He'd never been okay with slavery, as socially accepted as it was. He wasn’t some crazy abolitionist, but his family never owned slaves growing up. He could never own another person. The mere thought brought bile rising up his throat.
After a great amount of alcohol consumption and telly-watching and obnoxious cheering, eyes began shifting towards Sherlock more frequently. Sherlock tried his hardest to blend into the walls, but he could only do so much.
“221B Baker Street, I suppose,” Sherlock says. Then he breaks into one of those rare, genuine smiles, and John grins back.
John's eyes flitted across the expanse of exposed white chest. The little voice in the back of his head rang through his thoughts. Why not now? What's stopping you now? It's not that wrong, really. He is your property. It's not like this hasn't happened to him before. He's completely used to it.
Sherlock’s emotions, that John wondered if he’d even possessed at times, are spilt onto the pages in front of John’s eyes. And they are beautiful.
John raised an amused eyebrow, noticing how Sherlock quite resembled a puppy at the moment. “So there were drugs involved?”
John snapped out of his thoughts when his eyes caught the deep purple of a bruise edging out from under the open collar of Sherlock's shirt. "Actually," John said slowly, sitting down next to the tightlipped man. "Take off your shirt."
There they were, then, standing among the dusty furniture of the old flat—John with his meager single suitcase of belongings and the new duffel given to him at the institution, the slave with only the gray shirt and trousers on his back.
John’s mouth opens, inside 221B, and he breathes a single word as if he were dying and it alone could save his life. “Sherlock.”
But Mary doesn’t matter, in this second. Not after revelation. Because Sherlock… oh, Sherlock. Sherlock means everything to John Watson.
“I’m what? Why?” Sherlock jerked upright. “You can’t be serious. I’m not going to watch soccer with your drunk friends from University days. You can’t make me.” There was a sliver of wild in his eyes, a sliver of panic.
An overpowering urge to dominate—to control—the man in front of him flooded over John Watson. Christ, this was embarrassing. Sherlock was his property, goddammit. Why couldn't he just follow the blasted rules? Two could play this game. Without even realizing his actions, John's fist flew up to connect with the slave's jaw. The second it happened, John’s eyes widened. “I’m sorry, I-I didn’t…” he trailed off.
Sherlock strolled into the room. "Small," he said, spinning around to fully assess their space. His coat twirled.
“I mean,” Sherlock said, a level, uncaring quality to his voice, “What is all of this? It’s not love, so what is it? Because I’m here?” Sherlock couldn’t read the dark gray of John Watson’s eyes.
The woman flew through her debriefing as if she'd done it a million times. She probably had. Then, unexpectedly, she hesitated. "I will caution you, though. The majority of slaves we offer have been broken in. The slave you have chosen, 03172, has had a... shall we say unfortunate history with some of his previous owners."
The evening was going as Sherlock had wanted it to. He was an arrogant arse, and John finally cracked. So far, the two had only eaten take-out, John insisting he was a rubbish cook and too embarrassed to ask Sherlock to cook for him. But that night, he did. For John Watson, the whole sodding day had gone terribly. The surgery that morning was awful, he'd been pick-pocketed on his way back to the flat, and now Sherlock wouldn't let up.
“We were working on the front gate… I kept dropping the pieces and losing them; they were slipping through my fingers. So, he got fed up and grabbed my arm. Wasn’t the first time he’d shook me up a bit. Just this time I got a little more bloody shaken.
(My fingers, I can barely get them to work. I want to call you. I want to tell you with my own voice that I think I love you—that I know I love you. That you are the one who’s brought me to life. I want to tell you that I’m dying and I wish you were the one killing me instead of a fucking bullet. This is no way to go, when I cannot look into you eyes and I do not want to die. John, I want to live. Even if you love Mary, I want to see you and be there for you and love you. Even if it will only always be one-sided.)
They sat in another tension-filled silence, broken only by Sherlock's muted hisses and muffled grunts as John wrapped dressing around Sherlock's torso. His fingers brushed bare skin, and he felt more alive than he had since returning to London after the war.
It's been a long while, so I reposted what was previously the really short first third chapter at the end of the second. This is new, and hot, and full of complications and desire. I hope you enjoy.
John, with Sherlock’s wrists in his grip and their mouths locked together, pulled his slave to the sofa and pushed him down into the cushions, none too gently, and straddled his lean frame.
Looking back at the moment, I should have observed. You tell me I see but do not observe and now I understand. Police sirens rang and their lights flashed, but I didn’t even care. I should have, because they were yours. I should have been with you.
“I thought…” John paused, looking down and back up again. “I don’t know what I bloody thought, Sherlock. That maybe someone had broken in?”
Sherlock stumbled a few steps backward, overwhelmed by the sheer force of John's impact. Relief and disgust swarmed through John's mind with two simple thoughts. The first: maybe he did have it in him to own a slave and teach him his place. The second: he would never allow himself to become that sort of man. “I am so sorry,” he choked out.
Sherlock had endured so much worse, but his injuries were still substantial. Superficial, nonetheless, he reminded himself. He would survive. The best part was that now he had reason to utterly despise John Watson. He wouldn’t feel guilty disobeying and mocking the man. He wouldn’t feel bad for doing all he could to fight his status. John had insulted him and beaten him, reduced him to nothing at all. Yet for some unknowable reason, all Sherlock could remember was the damaged look on John's face after Sherlock had returned from his shower.
He was kinder than those that came before him, and that counted for something. He had kind eyes. Well, sometimes. But John wasn’t doing anything wrong, Sherlock knew. Sherlock wanted this, even.
John was startled by the deep, ringing baritone of the man's voice. God, it was nearly sinful just hearing it. He cleared his throat before trying again. “A real name."
Sherlock was naked and hot and in John’s bed, and John was on top of him. “Say yes, Sherlock. Say it.” John’s fingers dug into the slave’s boney hips.
The decision to go was last minute, but John figured he might as well spend a night with some old friends, his plans to catch up with Harry being so suddenly cancelled.
There. Just as he had predicted. The comment was coming sooner or later. It always did. This time, though, it hurt. Why did it hurt? Surely, he wasn’t already trusting John Watson? No, he wasn’t like that. He didn’t care about people.
Sherlock, too, had had time to think. And he did. He didn’t know what had come over him, going to John. It was against everything he had planned. John’s question had made him uneasy, too. Why did Sherlock trust him? He shouldn’t. Sherlock needed to do anything but trust John, the willing slaveowner. He would not trust John Watson. He would not care for John Watson. He would never love John Watson.
I know I am selfish, but I think you would have been good for me, too. You already were. Now that you’re gone again, do you suppose I’ll get worse?
Molly once told me I looked sad when I thought no one was watching. I guess my body betrays my mind in its ceaseless battle for control over my emotions. It’s true: I am sad. I am lonely. I am defective, and of course you would never want me and why the fucking hell had I ever convinced myself otherwise?!
Nothing dramatic, just a goodbye. A letter. A regret. An adieu to the era of Sherlock and John. Closure? But I am not a sentimental man—
John heard a sharp intake of breath, but Sherlock relaxed to his touch. "Were you born free, Sherlock?"
And somehow, Sherlock’s head rested against John’s neck, and John’s arm rested around Sherlock’s shoulder, and their feet and calves found themselves woven together.
"Don't," John managed, but he still felt strange directing orders at the man in front of him. Of course he had commanded soldiers, led them into the war, even, but it simply didn't feel right ordering a powerless man. John was unsettled, shifting on his feet.
I made you tea. Then the tea got cold. So I made you another cup, and it too got cold. Three cups later, and I had no choice but to call Lestrade. He didn’t know where you were. I was worried.
When Sherlock and John arrived in one of John’s friend’s flat, a man by the name of Jerry, they were met with a chorus of ‘Johnny boy!’ and ‘Ay, John! How was the army?’
I love you rested on John’s lips, but he didn’t dare say it. But it was true. But he couldn’t. But he had to. But he couldn’t.
Sherlock realized, glaringly, that John Watson was not a kind man, nor was he a monster. John Watson didn’t fit into categories.
John walked over to him, posture solid and a bit intimidating. Sherlock kept stubborn eyes on his paper, so John reached down and turned Sherlock’s chin toward him. He leaned down and kissed Sherlock, long and slow. “Get the milk, please.” He phrased it like a question and said it like a command.
“Sherlock,” you say sternly. I’ve no choice but to look at you. The fading light shines through the window and onto you. Where else? I swear, John, you carry the sun in the brilliant blue of your eyes. Usually it’s all dark. Not to everyone, no, but to me, the world’s always dark.
“Fuck,” John spat. He attacked Sherlock’s mouth with his own, nipping at plush lips and delving into the corner’s of the man’s mouth with his tongue.
It was all clear to you then, that I had heard. Naturally. Your observation skills are much more developed than I give you credit for; you are always surprising me.
Would it make sense to you, John, if I told you that my new reality feels like I am playing a game I have no chance of winning? It doesn’t make much sense to me either. But everything makes sense to me.
Sherlock’s laugh was a harsh, humorless thing. “Trust me, he’s got enough power to do whatever he wants. Mycroft has more power than the queen and the Parliament together. No, John, he’s still lording over me with his pitying eyes and lust for my punishment. To him, I had this coming. Maybe I did. Haven’t seen him in four years.”
John stepped up to Sherlock, leaning his forehead against the slave's back. He slid his hands from Sherlock’s waist to his hips. This isn't wrong. John tried to convince himself, but the awful nagging sensation in the back of his skull persisted.
John nodded, turning towards the woman standing next to him. "Alright, then." He cleared his throat awkwardly. "That one." He gestured towards the man that had so curiously caught his attention. He sniffed. ”Do I get any instruction? An explanation? Or is this…? I just… take him home.”
The day dragged on and on and on. Sherlock couldn’t decide if he was anxiously awaiting John, dreading John, excited for John to get home or something else entirely. His head hurt. Damned emotions.
The silence is so full and pure that John can hear the slight intake of breath from inside the room.
The man was tall and undeniably thin, clad in the simple gray trousers and shirt that all slaves wore. His pale limbs would have been gangly and awkward, if he were not to hold himself with such elegance. His head was up, chin tilted and eyes calculating. God, he had wonderful eyes. He couldn't have been a slave for long, John thought. Standing like that? No, he wouldn’t have lasted. John wouldn't have even been able to tell if the man was a slave if it weren't for the numbers tattooed along the his neck, forming a sequence of five from his ear to his shoulder—the numbers and, well, the fact that John was in a position to own him.
Is it strange, that sometimes I look at it and tears spill from my eyes? I convince myself I am strong, but Sherlock, I feel like I’m broken. Why did you leave? You know what? Fuck sentiment, too.
So John Watson, who was definitely straight, reached out his left hand and set it over Sherlock Holme’s heart.
Because this is how it went, to me at least. What stood out in your mind is a mystery, seeing that our intellect is so polar.
And I felt something. Everything. You are everything. You let me feel. I don’t know how; I shouldn’t be capable of feeling.
Sherlock froze. Something hot and burning and prickling unfurled in his chest, and he couldn’t determine if it was desire or sex or disgust but it was quiet possibly shame. His mind fogged with heat and he didn’t like the confusion of it, the uncertainty and wrongness.
I’ve so many questions for you. I’ve so many unanswered thoughts swarming and ricocheting through my broken mind. (Do you think of me? Do you whimper my name in your sleep now? Have I become your Afghanistan, John? Your war? I have dreamt of you so often that sometimes I question your realness.) I want to write them down and send this letter to you, but I can’t. If I were to fold this sheet of paper that has been bloodied with ink and slip it into an envelope and address it to you and send it in the post, you wouldn’t be safe. Then what would be the point of saving you in the first place?
A rush of unwelcome, but involuntary pleasure rolled over John. This man sitting across from him, with his marble skin and the strangest but most endearing face, his brilliant eyes, was completely John’s. Everything about him was John's.
(I am on a case. Why doesn’t that matter like it used to? What am I thinking— of course the work matters. The work is everything. I am married to my work. It’s all I have. And right now, I am not wasting my time being emotional over you, even though I know I will never stop loving you. I am busy. I am catching a serial killer. Get out of my head, John.)
Because I don’t want to hurt you. Only if you asked, and maybe not even then, because I am a selfish man and I don’t want to see your worn face twisted in pain. I don’t want to feel any more agony. I’ve recently learnt that sometimes feeling can become too much. Too intense. Too colourful.
John jumped in his chair and looked up from the book he was reading to see Sherlock standing next to him. It would take him a while to get used to having another person around. “I… I guess I haven't thought about it."
Comments and feedback are appreciated! Thank you for reading :) I'll post another chapter as soon as I can.
“My girlfriend,” Harry hissed. “I’m gonna go, John,” She remarked quickly, turning towards the doorway. “Nice seeing you.”
Sherlock was sleeping now, John was sure of it. Deep breaths, still eyelids, lack of any movement besides the rise and fall of his chest under a soft, worn grey t-shirt.
They stood for a second, staring at one another. Wasn't this forbidden ground, for a slave? Staring a master in the eyes? Sherlock's eyes narrowed, and a smirk played on his lips, as if he knew exactly what John was thinking. Sherlock wouldn't break his glare; he was toying with John's naivety, no doubt.
John would find himself with his hands down Sherlock’s trousers, with his cock in Sherlock’s pretty little mouth, with Sherlock naked, bent over the kitchen table. Each time, half-mad with lust: “Say it. Fucking say yes.” And Sherlock, vulnerable, breathing hard: “God, yes, John.”
I know it wasn’t your choice. I know I shouldn’t have left you for Mary. I know I made you suffer, and I am more sorry for that than for anything I have done in my life, and I have killed men, I’ll let you know.
And when the flat door finally opened later that afternoon, John found Sherlock pacing back and forth in the living room, navy robe fluttering behind him. John shut the door with an audible click, and Sherlock stopped his pacing and stared at John like a deer in the headlights.
The silver, muted light from the window poured over Sherlock, John’s Sherlock. The raindrops streaming along the glass panes cast subtle shadows along the slave's skin. Kissed the permanent ink along the flesh of his neck. And God, Sherlock’s liquid eyes were glowing. Dangerous.
Hi! I hope everyone's summer is going well. Please comment, review, or critique if you have the time.
“Moriarty’s men. I’d found myself in compromising positions over the past few years while dismantling his network.”
And then Sherlock had come into his room, his bed, and comforted him after all that happened. Would this change anything? Everything? John didn’t know. And if Sherlock acted so forgiving after something so painful, after being bloody whipped, would he act the same way if John were to try something… different? Would he still act so forgiving? John couldn't help but wonder.
Sherlock did as told. John couldn't hold in the sudden gasp that escaped from his lips. His stomach clenched. The slave's back was a canvas for bruises and wounds. The whiteness of his skin was nonexistent, being layered instead with the blacks, blues, greens, and yellows of bruises. Nasty, red welts and scars spread across his back. Nothing other than whips could've made those marks. Worse than even that were the cuts. Knives too, not just whips then. There were crude, jagged lines, but the carved words made John quiver in anger. Freak. Mine. Sexy. Nothing. Who the hell thought they could do this to another living person? John traced a light finger down Sherlock's side, and the man flinched, hissing painfully through gritted teeth.
Harry’s eyes widened, and she shot John a concerned, bewildered glace. “Yes,” She insisted, turning back to the strange slave who sat like he was a God. “Tea.”
He could spend hours, maybe days, wandering its corridors and basements—but not weeks. He couldn’t spend this new lifetime cooped up with his thoughts. Sherlock needed to breath. He didn’t know what he needed. It was illogical.
For your simple, mundane, beautiful mind I will elaborate. But only for you. I want to be everything in your head. All the time. I cannot deny my unfeigned jealousy for the deserts and gunshots of Afghanistan. They plague your dreams at night, but I should be the one consuming your consciousness. Only me. I can be your bullets and guns and bloodshed and blazing sun, John. Please, let me be your sun. Then you can wake up screaming and crying and sobbing because of me and finally you will let me hold you in my arms and assure you that I am here, and I am your everything. And you are mine.
You are asleep, lying on your back. Are you dead? I wonder. That is how still you are. I have to focus on the sound of your shallow breathing to remind myself of your aliveness. I reach out my hand. It is an involuntary movement of muscles and tendons, much like the beating of a heart and the pumping of blood. I rest a finger on your cheek and trace my name. Then I trace your name. Then I trace shapes and images from past cases and your favorite type of tea and all the things you have ever said to me. I trace my fingers in patterns along your skin and if ever there was a moment to be able to freeze time, this would be it, this would be it.
Everything was wrong and nothing was right. I didn’t see you again for 30 days.You were avoiding me, it was obvious enough. Even now, on the rare occasions we encounter one another (which are decreasing in frequency at an alarming rate) you never talk about that night.
I think, if you came back to me that night, I would have kissed you like I did once so long ago. I would have told Mary that I love you and Mary would have understood.
(I stumble, falling against the stone wall of the alleyway. I look down at my open coat. The rain-soaked white shirt beneath it is stained crimson, now. I can’t breath. I can’t breath. Where are you? You should be here; You always are here. You could save me. I trusted you to save me, you’ve done it before. I slide down the wall, slumping into the gutter.)
“I thought about you when you were gone,” John murmured. He lifted his left hand and set it, warm, against the bare skin of Sherlock’s side. He could feel the man’s ribs under his palm.
John stepped over to the man at the window. If Sherlock had noticed by now, he'd decided to ignore the approach, keeping his back turned towards John and his eyes fixed out at the rain. Sherlock's Adam's apple bobbed. Of course he knew John was behind him. John was once in the army, but that didn't mean he'd ever been stealthy.
And John said again, pained, “I had no idea.” His eyes met Sherlock’s from where he was standing across the kitchen.
My eyes ask if you’re coming. Your eyes tell me you’re staying. Naturally you’d stay. As only is to be expected. We don’t do this anymore, you and I. So I turn out the door, alone, and hurt. “Goodbye, John,” I mutter over my shoulder. I hate feelings. The world is void of light once more.
And later that night, when some of John’s rugby buddies also seemed to think Sherlock was ‘quite the looker’ at a soccer watching, beer drinking men’s night, John didn’t feel a shred of guilt when he let them ‘mess around a bit.’
Don’t worry, I am not planning a grand suicide. Or even a simple suicide. It is not that sort of goodbye. I’m going to live on. I think, though, living without you will be a death in itself. Perhaps it will be more painful, but isn’t that what I deserve?
The steps he takes are not an old man’s wobbly and weak gait. They’re strong again, like they were when he was younger. Each stair brings him closer to the dusty light glimmering through the door to their flat, cracked open just so.
“The interesting thing,” Sherlock continued, sifting through a stack of petri dishes and scribbled data. “The interesting thing is that this is the same drug we found on the bouncer, and now if I can just get the victim’s purse from Goffried—“
Sherlock had been told plenty of times that his stubborn refusal to accept his status didn't do anything but cause more trouble for himself. He couldn't deny the truth, but that didn't mean he'd accept it. Now things were going to be different. John Watson wasn't a despicable man. He didn't treat Sherlock awfully, like the others had. So what could Sherlock do? Give in? Let John own him? Never.
John coughed, pulled his lips together, shifted on his feet. “Scars, then… and how’d you get them?” John asked, voice tight. He bit the inside of his cheek. “I mean, they’re relatively new, obviously.”
John rubbed his eyes, sitting up and wincing as he remembered what had happened the night before, as he remembered the adrenaline that seared through his veins along with that shocking feeling of control, as he remembered Sherlock kneeling on the floor, bloodied and beaten and still anything but broken. After it was over, John felt like the broken one, but the bewitching feeling of power he felt in that moment wouldn’t be driven from his mind.
John could feel Sherlock’s lungs expand with each slow breath. He imagined he could feel the blood running beneath his skin. “I still do,” John breathed. “Think of you.”
Sherlock exhaled through his nose, slowly. “God is a construct created by desperate sinners, so no.” His eyes opened, languid. “Do you, John Watson?”
You need me, too. You’re fascinated by me. I took away your limp and you’ve been intrigued ever since. I’m afraid I’ll scare you away.
“What?” You snap. Annoyed again. Am I really that trying? Does it bother you that I’m not taking your counterfeit emotions seriously?
There it was again, the kindness. It could end now or later, and later would ultimately turn out to be more painful. "Why should I think for one second that you'd give me anything I need?" His words were calm and biting. "You think you're so good, treating me like the human I would have been, had my life gone differently. You think I appreciate it. I would fucking appreciate being free, but you can't give me that, can you? You can get rid of me, sure, but it's not your place to set me free." Sherlock tilted his head just slightly, knowing the numbers tattooed on his neck would catch the dim hallway light. "No, I need nothing you could possibly give me. Self-satisfied, insufferable, bastard.”
John awoke hours later to harsh sunlight and a pounding headache. Grunting, he sat up far too quickly, then rubbed his temples to try to ease the throbbing there. When his eyes fell on the table in front of him, he noticed a glass of water and paracetamol next to his phone, which had miraculously been plugged in to charge. A blanket he didn’t remember grabbing last night was pooled around his waist. Realising that Sherlock must have, for lack of a better term, tucked him in last night, John shrugged and said, to no one in particular, “huh.”
Sherlock locked eyes with John, his expression a mix between murderous and ravenous. John couldn’t help but chuckle, then went back to working Sherlock open. Before long, Sherlock was writhing and panting, his cock leaking all over his stomach. John finally couldn’t wait any longer and lined himself up, taking a steadying breath. It wouldn’t do for him to go off like a sodding teenager as soon as he got inside. He pressed the head of his cock to Sherlock’s hole, waiting for the consulting detective to relax and allow the intrusion. Caressing Sherlock’s hips, he rocked slightly, encouraging Sherlock to take him. After a moment, Sherlock canted his hips and John slid a few inches inside with a distinct pop that made both men groan. John held himself steady to allow Sherlock to get used to the feeling. After a few ragged breaths, Sherlock began quietly whimpering, then pleading.
It took only a few minutes before Sherlock began to shake. He knew with the strain and stress already applied to his body, his legs would eventually give out and he would have to allow his shoulders to take his weight. It would be incredibly painful and he might dislocate one or both of his joints. He tried to re-enter his mind palace but he couldn’t produce the focus required. Instead, he imagined John was there with him. If John were there, he could help. He would make Sherlock’s mind work again. He would fix everything.
When John’s tongue joined the fray, Sherlock swayed on his feet for a moment, and John automatically reached out to steady the detective. Once his hands made contact with Sherlock’s arms, once he was
John awoke with a start an indeterminate amount of time later. It was dark. Sherlock was no longer alone. His mobile beeped, a low battery warning. John scrambled to find his charging cable and plugged his phone in, then opened his laptop to watch the video on a larger screen. As if it would make a difference. As if seeing things unfold more clearly would help.
“I’m afraid mine is rather…underwhelming,” Sherlock admitted. He seemed hesitant to hand it to the doctor.
Sherlock was barely conscious when Moriarty and Ex-Military returned. Once again bringing in a chair and using it as a step stool, Ex-Military released Sherlock from the ceiling and his wrist bindings, and allowed his body to collapse unceremoniously onto the hard floor. Sherlock was too exhausted to groan. His left shoulder felt…wrong. Probably dislocated. He felt the mercy of unconsciousness begin to pull at him again, but Moriarty walked over to Sherlock and slapped him several times rapidly on the cheek.
Sherlock was glad for the respite from John’s gaze, as even someone of average intelligence would have noticed the wounded expression that flickered across Sherlock’s features. He wasn’t sure what hurt worse – John saying that their life together wasn’t enough for him, or John believing Sherlock to be “unattached and emotionless.” It was silly, he knew, to take offense to that assessment given that he had worked hard to cultivate that persona his entire life. Nevertheless, he had hoped that John would understand, intrinsically, that Sherlock was very much attached and emotional. While he would normally be proud that his affect had fooled someone so completely, instead he found himself disappointed that John hadn’t seen through him. How could John not know? How could he not know how Sherlock truly felt?
Mere moments later (far too little time, as far as John was concerned), John felt the telltale sensation of an impending orgasm. Part of him was desperate to prolong the experience, but a much larger part of him felt desperate to come. He tugged at Sherlock’s hair, trying to warn him, but Sherlock simply groaned in response, redoubling his efforts on John’s length. Realising that Sherlock had no intention of pulling off, John felt his last bits of control give way. He managed to choke out “oh, God” before he felt himself coming down Sherlock’s throat. The detective gagged for a moment, then let out a muffled whimper that turned into a moan as he reached his own peak.
John nodded, though he realised that Mycroft couldn’t see him. (Granted, he probably actually could.) Mycroft ended the call and John turned back to watch the video feed of Sherlock, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. He would endure for Sherlock. He would keep watch.
John sat beside him watching Sherlock’s chest rise and fall with his deep, even breathing. Whenever he closed his eyes, John saw images of Sherlock’s face contorted in pain, his arms wrenched over his head, his back flayed open. John tried to scrub the images from his mind, focus on the relief of Sherlock being alive and at least mostly okay. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes and he finally let go. Holding Sherlock’s uninjured hand in both of his, John pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s knuckles, sobbing quietly into the bed linens. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed like that, but eventually his breathing began to slow and his tears ebbed away. He held steadfastly to Sherlock’s hand, and could’ve sworn he felt it give a gentle squeeze before John finally fell into a fitful kip.
Sherlock defaulted to his earlier movement and nodded his head once. Using his free hand, John guided Sherlock’s mouth down to his. Relief and joy and excitement and calm washed over John as he felt Sherlock gasp, then deepen the kiss. John’s fingers slid up into Sherlock’s hair, gently gripping. The detective let out a shuddering breath and resumed kissing John, their tongues asking and answering the questions they couldn’t put words to.
[I can’t risk yours or Sherlock’s safety out of some sense of propriety. You’ll have to bear it at least until Moriarty is taken care of. –MH]
John continued to stare at the screen, eventually allowing his mind to begin to process things. Sherlock was being tortured. Right now. He was somewhere, probably not very far from where John was, and he was in total agony. He couldn’t move, he was soaked in his own piss, bleeding through open wounds on his back, and left alone. John’s heart hurt so much for Sherlock that it was a real, physical sensation. He was somewhat relieved to realise that Moriarty wasn’t just going to kill Sherlock as he apparently did with the doppelgangers in the church and the brothel. That relief, however, led immediately to dread – Moriarty clearly had plans for Sherlock, and they would be far from pleasant.
Moriarty shrugged and left the room. Ex-Military removed Sherlock from the table with brutal efficiency. He dragged Sherlock back to the center of the room, where he bound his wrists together behind his back once more. Using the chair as a step stool, Ex-Military then yanked Sherlock’s hands up forcing Sherlock to bend at the waist, affixing the bindings to an anchor in the ceiling. He made sure that the length was just enough so that Sherlock needed to rise up on the balls of his feet in order to relieve the pressure on his shoulders. Ex-Military then removed the chair, the table, and every single item from the room, leaving Sherlock suspended from the ceiling and alone.
“Awake already?” John asked, worry creasing his brow. He put his predictable spy novel down on the side table next to his armchair.
“The killer wants me in these places, he wants me out of my comfort zone,” Sherlock concluded, more to himself than to John and Lestrade.
John felt a thrill skitter up his spine, goose pimples breaking out all over his flesh. “Have you got—“
“She clearly wasn’t good enough for you, John. I know you find value dating these idiotic women for whatever reason, but it’s unbelievably depressing watching you toiling away in mediocrity in your dating life.”
Tears, unbidden and most unwelcome, sprung to John’s eyes. He turned on his heel and picked up his coat. He cleared his throat but the words came out rough anyway. “Well you needn’t worry about that anymore. I’ll let you get on with your pristine, emotionless existence.”
John’s resolve, while strong, was not absolute. He slowly pushed in the rest of the way, finally seating himself fully inside Sherlock. When their bodies were flush, Sherlock sighed as if he’d had an itch for ages that had finally been scratched. John stayed still for a long moment, for both his and Sherlock’s sakes, allowing himself to take in the scene before him. Sherlock’s flushed skin was now coated in a sheen of sweat. His right hand held a fistful of the duvet so tightly that his knuckles were white. His spine was arched just slightly, his head thrown back, his neck exposed and looking utterly biteable. His hair was even wilder than before, some of it now matted to his forehead. His ragged breathing was punctuated by little whines and whimpers. John felt a stab of pride at how absolutely wrecked Sherlock was already.
Without a moment’s pause, Ex-Military (Sebastian, apparently) grabbed Sherlock’s left arm and pulled, an audible pop echoing in the room. Sherlock’s vision whited out at the pain, but it quickly faded to a dull ache. His entire body was still in agony, but that small bit of relief was intoxicating. The effect was short-lived, as Moriarty clapped his hands together once and grinned. “Wonderful! Now we can get back to it.”
“Sherlock,” John began, his voice soft and low, “if you want me to move out, leave you alone, never speak to you again, then you can tell me that and I’ll go.” Sherlock twisted slightly in confusion and alarm, wincing with the effort but meeting John’s eyes nonetheless. The doctor was quick to continue. “But outside of that, nothing you can say is going to ruin our friendship.” Though Sherlock tried his best to hide it, John could see the way Sherlock flinched at the word “friendship”. John allowed his fingers, still massaging conditioner into Sherlock’s hair, to stray slightly. He traced the shell of Sherlock’s ear, making the detective shut his eyes instinctively. His voice barely above a whisper, John amended his previous statement. “Our relationship.”
After wrapping up at the church, Sherlock and John followed the body to the morgue in the hopes that a full post-mortem exam would shed some light on an otherwise very thin case. Molly was able to rule out a number of causes of death, but a full toxicology report and other tests would take some time to run. The body was otherwise clean of all trace evidence. No stray hairs, fibers, fingerprints, fluids, or evidence of trauma. It was as if the man had simply stopped being alive.
A line of concern marred Sherlock’s perfect brow. “If you’d rather not, John, I’d completely understand—“
Moriarty strode into the room with the unhurried air of someone who had absolutely nowhere else to be. “Hi, darling!” he announced, chipper as ever. “I must apologise for the lacklustre accommodations. I know your posh self is used to much better lodgings, but I had some particular specifications I had to meet for us. And, you know, needs must and all that.”
His dulled mind and the constant thrum of anguish throughout his body allowed him only the simplest of reveries before he either began to fade from consciousness or was seized by shooting pain, effectively curbing his thoughts over and over again. After an indeterminate amount of time, Moriarty and Ex-Military were back. Sherlock did his best to steel himself, although he feared that he had neither the fortitude nor mental capacity to do a good job of it.
John found the consulting detective sitting on the ground just outside the main building. He was covered in a blanket, berating the EMTs. John’s face broke into a grin as he couldn’t stop himself from running over to Sherlock. When Sherlock caught sight of his friend, Sherlock’s eyes shone like stars. He didn’t smile, exactly, but his body sagged with apparent relief.
“My people found the link on your blog just now. We’re trying to trace the source of the video as well as the IP address and location of the person who posted the comment.”
John looked over at Sherlock, but Sherlock’s eyes were closed and an arm was delicately draped across his face. John closed his eyes for a moment and took a steadying breath. “Sherlock,” he began, “I am both infuriated at your characterisation of the women I’ve dated and…flattered? I think? That you think anyone isn’t good enough for me. We’ll call it a draw. I’m too tired to have a row with you, and this sofa is comfortable.”
Trying to play it cool, John asked, “Is this sort of thing going to happen every time we have a row?”
As John tried to emerge from the shock and the haze of his own thoughts, Sherlock reluctantly disengaged from John and pulled back just far enough to look into John’s eyes. John had no idea what he looked like in that moment, but he knew that Sherlock was reading him like a book. When it seemed as though perhaps Sherlock wasn’t going to continue the kiss, a tiny, involuntary whine escaped from John’s throat. At that sound, John saw Sherlock’s pupils dilate instantly, his irises practically gone. A new level of intensity brought Sherlock’s lips back to John’s, this kiss as much a gnashing of teeth as anything.
John finally allowed himself to close his eyes for a moment, though Sherlock’s contorted and abused body was still there behind his eyelids regardless. Picking up his mobile and dialing Mycroft, John cleared his throat and began to rattle off everything he could think of. “Well, they’re not planning to kill him right away, if ever. They’re giving him water and they clearly intend to feed him later. And this setup with the camera, far too elaborate for just a snuff film. He wants to drag this out. He wants us to see and see and see.”
Sherlock stepped closer to Moriarty, and the madman raised his gun slowly, aiming it at Sherlock, who lowered his hand to hold the gun against his own forehead.
John shook his head and looked at Mary. "I'm sorry, my love. That violin playing just reminded me of my departed friend."
"I see. Well, my brother, surprisingly, scares easily. If you don't want to alarm him, I'd be discreet."
"Wait, wait, you're telling me that this Magnussen guy would have sexually assaulted me?" Sherlock asked, not getting just how far said sexual assault went.
"I knew the victim as well, better than you did. I think I feel something because of their death, but I don't know what it is. But I can't just leave the crime scene like you can if I start thinking too sentimentally."
But was he, really? Given that Sherlock was now unstable, and had warned him that he himself was dangerous... not to mention, he had got an ambulance to arrive as quickly as he could.
It was a delusional thought, but Sherlock had to be alive. He worked on logic despite his heart; he wouldn't kill himself so easily. He just had to find a way to get the truth out of Moriarty.
"Oh, nothing, other than the fact that I'm not going to be returning to Baker Street for a while. You know, with me about to be the main suspect in a murder case and all."
Sherlock nodded, again disappearing into the interrogation room. There had to be something that they were missing.
He was only able to catch a glimpse of his face before the car's door slammed shut, but he could've sworn that it was Sherlock.
Startled by John's yell, the nurse ran off to do as she was told. Magnussen calmly walked past John toward Sherlock.
Not hearing anything in response, Sherlock poked his head into her flat, 221A. Shortly after, however, he pulled his head out, and ran up the stairs for 221B.
Magnussen shook his head. "I will not deny the abuse, but it was not rape. Mr. Holmes was in perfectly sound mind and did not resist me."
Sherlock thought for a moment. "A lot has happened recently. I want to say I'm recovering, but I don't think that's entirely true..."
"No, I'm not alone. Yes, John knows I'm asking you for help." After a moment, he turned to John and said, "He says he's impressed with you," before returning to the call.
The Consulting Detective's eyes started to close. It didn't look like his body could take much more of this.
He bit his pale lips as he struggled to resist to urge to slice her neck open with the knife he held in his trembling hand.
When the owner finished talking to the customer, he rushed over to them. "Sherlock! Good to see you!"
"J-John, I... I'm..." Sherlock knelt down next to him and pulled his phone out of his own pocket. He frantically sent a text before bringing his attention back to John. "There should be an ambulance here in approximately three minutes and forty seven seconds..." It seemed as though Sherlock still remembered that old deduction. "John, I'm so sorry...! I didn't mean to... I didn't know I was even doing that...!"
"Look, it probably would've happened anyway. It's probably better this way, or else it might've been you I targeted..."
There was no response. It was safe to assume that something was happening that was preventing either of them from replying.
Sherlock found himself alone suddenly, standing where the other him had been, holding the gun. Slowly, he looked down at John, the hand with the gun trembling.
"See? I knew it was true~!" The madman said as he turned around, aimed his gun at Sherlock, and pulled the trigger, to which the gun clicked.
"Magnussen preys on people's weaknesses, or as he calls them, their Pressure Points. Sherlock has plenty... in fact, he has far too many. However, he will prey first on the two most prominent. ... When we get him back, don't be surprised if Sherlock doesn't want to be around you for a while. I'm almost completely certain his attachment to you is his biggest weakness."
He slowly shook his head. "N-nothing, I..." After a brief silent pause, he suddenly pulled John close and held him tightly.
clever. John's an idiot. Who can you trust more with your fate; someone just like you, who can appreciate you, or an idiot who just thinks you're a
Mycroft paused, and when he resumed speaking, he tried to avoid the question. "I'm going to question him a bit, see what he was told." Again, another pause. "... Would you like to speak to him first? Just for proof that I'm not lying, you know."
associate yourself with Charles Augustus Magnussen or Sherlock Holmes until I give the word that it's safe. I will have my men deal with this matter personally."
Moriarty emerged from around the corner. "Aah, good old Dr. Watson. Or should I just call you John? You don't really have any special type of rank..."
He immediately moved his hands away from his ears. "No reason." He said quickly, increasingly aware that if he kept on showing signs of instability, John may resume insisting he get help.
The next text was a picture of Sherlock, half naked and freshly beaten, struggling to obscure his face from the camera.
This command made the two men throw Sherlock to the floor. Moriarty straddled the detective, grabbing his messy dark curls, and started beating the back of his head against the floor as hard as he could.
Sherlock appeared startled, rightfully so, as the guard collapsed to the ground. A few people glanced over at them.
"It's a waste of time." At this point, Sherlock realized his headache was only getting worse, and he still was hearing Moriarty mumbling in his head. It was hard to focus on what John was really saying.
"I mean, you wouldn't be all that affected, would you? I mean, you've been to war. You've seen worse."
"Nowhere, Sherlock." Moriarty said, staring at John with a dark smirk on his face. "You haven't heard it before, I don't think."
"I will be." Sherlock left the room. He could shortly after be seen entering the interrogation room.
"Yes, I'm fine." Sherlock responded as he took a sip of his rather-overflowing glass. "Just letting emotions get the best of me. Ignore me."
"Maybe another time. Wrong day to die, Sherlock." Moriarty pivoted around and looked at them over his shoulder. "Please do watch out for the sands of time, Sherlock...
The Consulting Detective almost seemed moved. "John... You know something that I don't know for once, don't you?"
"I saved him from a murder charge by proving that he was in an entirely different part of London robbing a store."
"It's the only way. If I convince him that I'm on his side, that I'm his and his alone without anymore struggling, it's likely he'll reveal his weakness to me."
"Well, I was going to take Sherlock out anyway, but I decided the best way to end his life would be with a... bang. Get it?" Moriarty snarked.
Sherlock saw, and before he knew what he was doing, he threw himself toward her and grabbed her by the hair. "Press that button and your blood coats the walls, pig." He snarled. When he realized what he was saying, however, he shut his mouth; he wasn't sure where that had come from.
"John?" Sherlock mumbles, staring out the window at the ground below. "John, how well do you think you can treat a few broken ribs, a broken limb or two, a concussion, and a suspected punctured lung?"
"Are you sure the man with him won't come back?" She seemed strangely preoccupied with avoiding Magnussen.
"You... You say that we're nothing but friends and colleagues... But, uh... Hypothetically speaking, what if I were... to have a crush on you? I mean, what if I could and did? I... Just, never mind. I don't know what I'm saying. Must be the head injury talking."
Into the room waltzed Mycroft, who looked a little bit battered, followed by Lestrade, but Sherlock paid no mind.
Trying to hide his relief and other emotions, Sherlock hid his face snuggled against the crook of John's neck.
A broken smile slowly but surely crept its way onto Sherlock's face as his aim remained firm. Looking into his eyes, it was hard to recognize him.
As they made it to the main road and Sherlock hailed a taxi, he said, "You do have a small choice to make, though, John: are you going to return to Baker Street, or are you going to follow me? I would highly recommend the former, seeing as the latter could be
"N-no, I'm fine..." He pulled his hand away quickly. "This blood isn't mine..." He attempted to half-heartedly convince himself of this.
He narrowed his eyes at John, but more in a surprised way than as if he were offended, like he was taken aback by the accusation.
Sherlock shrugged. "All the better for him. Isn't it easier to get someone once they basically have to restart? Though, given, he probably anticipated that I would forget you... Then again, if he really is clever, he would know that's impossible."
Sherlock reached to grab him, but instead found himself alone in the room with his hand against the floor. "A hallucination with intent to cause harm should never comment on its own nature." That said, he glanced back at John. He had been slightly rattled, nevertheless, by the realization that he had to be careful around John, lest the ex-army doctor deem him crazy.
"But why fake your death and make me think you were dead? We were a team, Sherlock. And you didn't even try to let me know you were still alive. You know what? I am over you, Sherlock. And to think I even missed your blasted antics and violin playing all this time!" John huffed as he started to walk away and back to his new wife.
"Do not concern yourself with his affairs, John." Mycroft said. "It is solely the business of the British Embassy."
"I'll be seeing you, doctor. If you'll excuse me, though, I need to follow my own doctor." With this, Sherlock jumped up started heading for the exit. He stopped short, however, when he saw Moriarty in the doorway, blocking his path.
Sherlock's eyes widened and his body tensed from the abruptness of the kiss. It only took him a few seconds, however, to seem to relax again, and he closed his eyes, awkwardly trying to return the kiss.
"Now wouldn't that be interesting." Sherlock replied with a small smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. "John, hand me my phone."
Moriarty extended his hand, reaching out toward Sherlock. He held a gun, but he wasn't aiming it as much as he was offering it. "Come on, Sherlock."
"John..." The older Holmes brother almost sounded... deeply concerned. "There's... He's not here. There's nobody here."
"I don't get it. I know she doesn't like Sherlock, but why would she intentionally try to kill him?"
"An antique? I suppose I can see the sense in Mycroft being interested in antiques. However, I'm not sure he'll take it in exchange for help."
"You'll have to hail a taxi... or whatever... Not sure what a cabbie would think of... a guy with bloody hands flagging him down..."
"I don't know." Though typically something Sherlock would rarely say, these three words tumbled out of Sherlock's mouth at that moment.
"True. I could just let Lestrade take him in and let that be the end of it. But where's the fun in that?"
Despite the death of the Sherlock in his dream, thankfully the real Sherlock was alive and well... physically, at least.
"I'm going to have my men question him, and once we've evaluated that, we'll bring him back to you. You are okay with that, aren't you, John?"
"Well, if you change your mind, let me know." The owner turned to leave, but then turned back, "I'll get a candle for atmosphere." With that, he wandered away again; he seemed convinced that John and Sherlock were romantically involved.
Moriarty appeared almost amused by the threat, but he shrugged anyway. "Well, I'll check in later. Toodles." Then, he clambered down the rest of the stairs, disappearing around a corner as he approached the exit.
It didn't take long for him to realize that the victim was none other than Molly Hooper, the shy young woman that worked in the morgue at the Scotland Yard and had a blatantly obvious (to everyone but Sherlock) crush on Sherlock.
Sherlock sat back. He actually seemed rattled. "Jesus," He murmured before taking another sip of champagne.
"They're doing the best they can for him, but he's really messed himself up. Do you have any idea why he did this to himself?"
Magnussen might use their leaving Sherlock's side to his advantage and return to the unconscious Consulting Detective.
Lestrade entered again, only to return with Sherlock's scarf in his shaky hands. There was some blood on it.
Noticing an advantage, and completely dismissing the idea that it could be a trap under certain circumstances, Sherlock stepped quickly toward the man.
"I must be." He limped over to John. "Are you ready to go?" But then he thought for a moment. "... Actually, never mind. It's smarter if I go alone."
He would need a new approach, it seemed; Moriarty was too delusional and argumentative to sit back and take that kind of verbal abuse.
His head down, Sherlock stepped forward and clutched the edges of the sink. He felt laughter beginning to bubble up inside him, and soon found himself laughing hysterically, his knuckles white from gripping the sink so hard while his body quivered.
Soon Sherlock joined him. "My heart's pounding, but it's not an enjoyable excitement I'm feeling right now." He said. "Let's leave. No, first let's tell Lestrade something, then let's leave."
"I'm simply trying to voice concern. I believe I've heard you say the victim's name once or twice, and from the way you spoke of the victim, I believe you may feel sentiment for them in some way." Firstly, Sherlock was showing vague emotion. Secondly, he was suggesting that despite seeming to ignore everything John ever said, that he did in fact listen. It really was turning out to be a strange day.
At first it seemed like a whole trio of security guards was going to do something about Sherlock, but then one of them said a few words to the others and they left, leaving only one guy to approach Sherlock.
It was possible that her obvious feelings of disdain and contempt toward Sherlock were bringing her to lie, but before she could say anything more, Lestrade arrived at the scene.
There was another brief shuffle, and then he was talking to Mycroft again. "I think he's done talking for a few minutes. He gave the phone back to me and went back to looking horrified."
If Sherlock ended up hating him after this because of whatever Magnussen were to say to him, he felt as if that would be one of the worst feelings in the world.
"Heh, what's... What's the worst that could happen if I let them keep trying...? Maybe it'll work..."
Lestrade brought him to the body, opening the black body bag. Inside was one of Moriarty's henchmen that he had encountered earlier.
"No, I... I mean, you've..." Sherlock cleared his throat. "You've already answered the question before."
"Don't worry, I'll talk the actual number out of him. It'll just take a minute." He resumed texting his brother.
"I see. You still like your pets more than people." Moriarty groaned. "I wonder how hard you would fall if I put him down..."
Sherlock paced back and forth until, when he turned, he suddenly saw Magnussen standing in front of him and gasped.
Moriarty only laughed. "I'm looking forward to seeing whatever pitiful attempt you'll give. Don't keep me waiting too long."
Of course Moriarty loves taking credit for his schemes and devices. Maybe he could use that against him as well.
Sherlock didn't look at him, and resumed mumbling. From closer, he could hear what Sherlock was mumbling, but it didn't seem to make much sense...
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at the psychologist, worried he may have hurt her whilst throwing her away.
"They'll just give me morphine, which is almost as bad as giving me cocaine," Sweating somewhat, in the midst of one of his rare cocaine-withdrawal fits, Sherlock added, "Which, have I mentioned, I could really go for right now?"
"I don't know. It happened pretty quickly. One second, this poor thug had the freak in a headlock, next thing I knew, the man was dead as the freak's feet."
Exasperated, Mrs. Hudson turned to leave, shouting at him, "This is coming out of your rent, Sherlock!"
There had been cases in the past that Moriarty seemed to orchestrate that Sherlock had bested. But perhaps they were made to be solved. Sherlock had almost beaten Moriarty a few times during this case, but was there anything concrete to use against him? Moriarty could just argue that every near-catch was intentional.
"I'm here." She said rather calmly. "Turns out I didn't need any backup, but an ambulance might be nice."
John couldn't believe it. Sherlock was really dead and left him alone in the world. He felt like his world was ending.
"She keeps me here because she wants my company when she needs it." For a moment, Sherlock thought about that deduction. "... What a poor choice of acquaintance she has. Oh, and John, we're out of milk."
Sherlock's head still hurt and he could still hear Moriarty mocking him, but this only made him hold John tighter.
"I..." Sherlock gave it a moment's thought, studying every crease and wrinkle of John's hand with his fingers. "... I accept... Help me keep him safe..."
"This isn't about solving a case anymore! This is about justice. About making sure we're safe, you and I. Besides, coming this far... You've proved quite useful. I hate to say it, but I'm depending on you, John. You may not be able to save my life again, seeing as my pitiful body probably can't take much more of this, but if I go into this alone, I'll surely fail, and more innocent people will be hurt."
"Come on, then! Don't give me hollow threats, John. Give me the gun, or shoot me. Those are your options."
"He's got someone with him now." There was a pause, and Donovan suddenly began sounding somewhat frantic. "Oh, Christ. I need backup NOW!"
"... Who's there?" Sherlock asked quietly. He got no answer, but when he was about to shrug it off, he heard it once more, making him stand up.
Sherlock's eye twitched from the confusion of being unable to distinguish whether he was talking to the real Moriarty or not.
Sherlock adjusted his scarf gently. He had said on the phone that Magnussen had left a mark on his neck...
"Oh, don't try so hard to avoid the question, John. Your body language already answered it for me." Sherlock said matter-of-factly as he followed. "Dinner?" He then added, asking if John was hungry.
than I expected. I'm sending men to fetch Sherlock immediately before Magnussen has a chance to corrupt him." His choice of words was somewhat alarming. He hadn't chosen to say something gentler, but had instead decided to suggest that if left to his own devices, Magnussen may very well leave Sherlock broken and on the wrong side of the conflict.
Still, his heart rate slowly but steadily increased, and the stammering and trembling became more noticeable.
"Nonononono." Sherlock grabbed the door of the interrogation room and closed it, standing in front of it to prevent John from opening it. "John, don't."
Sherlock reached out and touched John's cheek, much like the Sherlock of his dream. "John, don't worry about me. I don't intend to leave you permanently."
Sherlock was holding his throat and choking. Judging from the blood pouring out around his fingers, it was safe to say that this throat had been slit.
He found that they were standing in front of the subway station where Sherlock had made a scene after they first took the case. "My idea couldn't have been that bad." Sherlock said. The Consulting Detective himself looked unharmed, as if John had gone into the past, before all of the horrible things that had happened to them transpired.
"I see," Sherlock began. It became apparent that even though he wasn't real, he was still keen, when he said, "This isn't real, is it? I'm a figment of your imagination; a dream... and I'm willing to bet that what you told me is reality." There was an un-Sherlock-like level of emotion in his voice as he said those words, possibly another sign of the dream falling apart. Sherlock looked at his hand; like the restaurant, it was rapidly fading.
“Is there something wrong?” John asked. Sherlock stared. “I’m sorry,” John continued, mumbling. “Everything’s wrong, isn’t it? I meant, is there something wrong with Angelo’s?”
“Fine.” I tilt my head to look at you. I need to figure out why you’re so suddenly here, out of the blue. I need to deduce it… but nothing on your face or your clothes or your posture gives me any sort of indication.
Sherlock’s arms were wrapped around John’s, gripping his shoulder blades. He felt a trace of something, a scar? He couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter. One of John’s hands worked between Sherlock’s legs and the other moved to hold Sherlock’s chin, to tilt his head up against the wall and expose his neck.
Fuck him. The voice was violating John's mind once more, but he couldn't help the heat rising to his cheeks and down to... other places. He stood up. Sherlock didn't seem to notice.
There are two cups of tea on the table. There’s a skull on the mantel. There are bullet holes and spray paint faces on the wall, and there is some sort of an experiment in the kitchen.
No. I am lying to myself. I am lying to you. My body is constructed wholly of painful sentiment and worthless genius. You have flipped my life upside down. Turned my being inside out and twisted me in whatever way you could. But it isn’t your fault. It’s mine.
Okay, he breathed a little, but barely. He was strangely, incredibly nervous. Nervous anticipation? Of what? No. No, he was not anticipating anything while sharing a bed with Sherlock.
The words say everything. John begins the first letter warily, but soon his eyes fly across the paper. The ink tells him everything he’s never known. The smudges answer the questions that have burned and smoldered in his mind since the very beginning, since ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’
He hung his head, deep in thought, hands gripping the sink basin to hold himself up. "Sherlock?" John called from the hallway, jolting him out of his thoughts.
Sherlock woke from a restless sleep in the middle of the night. His bruised back throbbed against the couch, but that wasn't what had woken him...
Panting, they pulled down trousers and pants. John hissed through clenched teeth when their cocks rubbed against one another, throbbing and hot. He gripped them with one hand, pinned Sherlock’s wrists with the other, and jerked his hips in heady thrusts.
"Well, yeah a bit. You shouldn't be talking to me like that." He rummaged through his dresser, having unpacked earlier.
Was this really who he was becoming? A heartless ex-soldier who agreed to the sexual assault of a helpless man? Christ. He was becoming despicable and well aware of it. Sherlocks words floated through his consciousness, “It does things to a person, slavery.”
Sherlock and John would have to share a bed. Sleep... in the same bed as one another. John didn't know how to feel about that. No, scratch that. He knew exactly how he felt about that.
John stepped closer, leaned in, and kissed Sherlock. It was chaste, a tender press of lips, until John felt Sherlock’s hand wrap around the back of his neck and felt the man’s mouth part beneath his own.
John let the comment slide. "I've gotten only one bedroom for the flat," he said carefully, nodding towards the room. "I wasn't expecting... you."
Finally, John can see Sherlock, really see him. The man who he’d spent years of his life with, mourned over, has been exposed in the most human way in these three simple letters.
John laughed, harsh and disbelieving. “I guess you could call it that,” he muttered under his breath. “Is that all?”
Sherlock rolled his shoulders, and John could see that he was sore, having been completely still and arching his back at such an awkward angle, for what, ten or fifteen minutes, now?
Neither spoke. Drum, drum, drum. Drum, drum, drum. Sherlock could hear the beating of his heart and the pulsing of his blood in the rhythm of John’s fingers.
Sherlock stood, illuminated in the window's light, trembling ever so slightly. But he was stronger than this, wasn’t he?
John lay still under his bedsheets. He tried to sleep, but sleep deceived him. Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock’s pleading eyes. John’s body racked with silent sobs. His life was becoming a horrific cycle: fall into a rhythmic normal with Sherlock, become high on the power of control, do something devastating to the man whose trust he was gaining, and shatter everything, beg for forgiveness, possibly and fragilely fall into a new rhythmic normal with Sherlock. Rinse. Repeat.
Sherlock slept in John’s room most nights now, all nights now. He woke up in John’s bed in the mornings. John had offered to clean out the room of junk and storage upstairs, but Sherlock had said, “There’s not much of a point, is there?” John figured he was right.
Sherlock took a deep breath, wincing at the strain it put on his wounded back, and slid into the pajamas. He stepped out into the hallway. John nodded at him. "Alright then. I'm heading to bed. Need anything?"
We used to chase criminals and masterminds through deadly currents hidden beneath the peaceful calm of London, you and I. Thieves and killers, rapists and liars. You see, there are those who deserve to die, and there are those who want to.
“You really don’t know anything.” Sherlock’s voice was strained, yet he acted casual about the whole ordeal, shrugging it off. "I assure you, I'm not. To many I’m aesthetically pleasing, fucking curse it is. You own me. You can do whatever you want with me." His silver-blue eyes closed, and his mouth sneered. "I'm your property."
Sherlock breathed, and it came out a moan. John moved his body flush against Sherlock’s, pressing a thigh between the man’s legs. The calloused, rough hands of a soldier and a doctor moved across the plain of Sherlock’s stomach and chest, under his shirt. Fingertips skimmed nipples. Sherlock gasped, and John reveled in the opportunity to kiss deeper into his mouth.
He could hear John's labored breathing from the end of the hallway. Having a nightmare, then, Sherlock discerned. The both of them often had nightmares—John’s about the war and Sherlock's about the horrors he'd endured over the past years.
By the end of the second letter, John’s blue eyes are dark and wet and glistening with unshed tears.
“I never did believe in any sort of afterlife…” Sherlock continues. “I guess you could say ‘I told you so’ right about now, couldn’t you?” A soft, embarrassed laugh escapes his lips.
A couple hours later, and Sherlock was still on the couch reading, a new textbook opened in his lap.
"Three years ago, I was so stupid. It was, I—There were drugs, and—” Regret rang through Sherlock's words. His deep voice rumbled.
There was something in the ex-soldier’s voice that put Sherlock on edge. He wanted to test out the word—in a different context, but still—and feel it in his mouth, against the back of his teeth. “No.”
Sherlock Holmes is standing, violin in hand, silhouetted by the window’s soft light. He looks just as he did on the night he withdrew from John’s life that final time. His pale eyes are piercing, his skin alabaster and free from the wrinkles of age, his dark hair still tangled in its lopsided curls.
For a heart-racing second, Sherlock’s utter stillness mocked death, and John Watson’s pulse exploded. Not dead, he thought frantically. He can’t be dead. With the slightest rise of the slave’s chest, John was reassured Sherlock lived.
There, just before him, is the door to 221B. He hasn’t been here in decades, and it’s exactly as he has remembered it. If only—if only Sherlock was still here with him. Sherlock Holmes who’s been dead for years. Sherlock Holmes who John has missed his entire life.
John bit his cheek. "So that leaves you the couch, or," he hesitated. "I don't want your back getting worse. You could take my bed—“
“It’s gotten so much more interesting than just a murder, John.” The detective turned back to the counter, still digging through the stacks of paper—John didn’t know what for.
And when Sherlock remembered that promise to himself, months ago when he was new and infuriating and John was new and intriguing. He remembered promising to himself he’d do whatever he could to stay out of John’s bed for as long as possible.
I can’t come to see Mary and you, John. I’m leaving you—giving you up—to your life of normalcy. I refuse to intrude and destroy this time. It isn’t your fault, either, John. It’s mine. Always mine. If you were your story, sometimes I might be the villain…
If you and I were both there I would prove to you I’m not dead. I would shove you—shove us—against the wall and dig my fingers into your shoulders, and kiss you like I’ve always thought I should. I would whisper against your lips that I’m not dead and that I won’t leave again and that I’m sorry and that I know I am a sociopath but still my mind is clouded with emotions for you and only ever you.
Sherlock’s eyes darkened; his voice remained steady. “If you’ve got to know, John, it’s to remind me of what I am. A slave. Your property, because of my mistakes. I act like this, make you act like this, to keep myself from pretending that we could be friends, because we can’t be. I’m not some masochist who enjoys slavery. I act like this, because I don’t want to submit,” he hissed. “I won’t let myself comply with this. Maybe irritating you is the only sort of rebellion I can manage right now.”
"What happened?" John's eyelids fluttered shut, but he was still attentively listening. Sherlock's voice was a lullaby.
"Why?" sherlock demanded when John returned. "Why are you doing this? Any of this?” His tone was openly accusing. “You’re not supposed to be helping me. Come on and just get it over with. Beat me or rape me or—” Sherlock’s strong voice faltered, minutely. “It’s boring, the way you all prolong the inevitable. The way you all pretend we might be friends at first. You’re an ex-military doctor, I know that by now. You’re clearly uncomfortable with slavery, but that won’t matter. It’s laughable the way you’re acting towards me, hoping the burden that will unavoidably weigh on your conscious will be lessened—tedious things, consciouses, I could imagine.”
Finally, the wolfish one—what was his name, Chris?—turned to John. “Don’t suppose we could mess around with your slave a bit, Johnny?”
Minutes later, John heard the bathroom door click shut. He swiveled. He hadn’t even heard Sherlock walk away.
Sherlock had to arrange the words he wanted to say before he spoke them out loud. “My brother knew I was an addict. He was a few years older, annoyed at my ‘childish’ behavior. He helped me get better at first, promised he’d fix it, I was only… fifteen or so when I started. I got clean, got to uni, and got caught up in the same deals again.”
Then you stop. And your fingers freeze. Your voice is calmer again, but still tense. I don’t blame you.
The flat was warm when they got back; lights accidentally left on welcomed them home. John watched Sherlock slide his scarf off his neck, and his coat off his shoulders. John watched him hang them up and watched him pause.
“Alright,” you nod, egging on the conversation. You can’t deny the cumbersome tension that pulses and circulates through the flat around us. “So how’re you? How’ve you been?”
She smiled pleasantly and formally and handed him a small duffel. Glancing inside, John noticed a whip, an extra grey uniform, other tools, they had called them. He thought he might be sick. "You've just returned from service in the army, Dr. John Watson, shot and with possible post traumatic stress disorder. In thanks and gratitude for how you have served our country, it is only appropriate that we provide you with service for your own personal needs. With this explanation, we, as those who embody the United Kingdom Office of Slave-Related Matters, give you the choice of a slave for ownership."
“Sherlock, really, honestly, are you alright?” Concern has edged its way into your expressive voice. God, you’d be a good actor, because I know that it’s fake. Of course the concern is fake, because you don’t care about me, not really.
It was obvious, really. The question and affirmation allowed John Watson some sliver of moral righting, some semblance of normality. Every time, Sherlock wondered what John would do if he said no instead of yes. Not that he would, of course.
Hours later, I stood up. “How long?” I asked. “A couple hours,” you replied casually, like nothing had happened. You didn’t think I heard. But then you turned around and saw me and I saw you.
A lot of people went to your funeral; I don’t know if you care. I don’t think you do. But I want you to know that you have made an impact on so many lives, Sherlock.
Without further thought, he tears open the most rumpled envelope of the three with a slip of his thumb.
Nothing was right but Sherlock guessed it was righter before John became fascinated with the fucking tattoo on Sherlock’s neck. He didn’t want to think of what it meant. He didn’t want to remember, but memories posses a subconscious and unrelenting control of their own.
Because when you’re finished, you’ll be appalled and annoyed and disgusted and maybe even horrified of me. You’ll know that I am a sociopath and that I am not. You’ll know how I think. You’ll know that I love you, and that is the most frightening factor of it all. Please don’t read them. You won’t look at me the same again.
John waited only a heartbeat before nodding. “Fair enough.” This isn’t so strange, he assured himself. Just two blokes having to share the same bed, because they’re on a last minute work-related trip and could only get one bloody room.
Empathy swallowed John whole. Where was that empathy yesterday? John’s subconscious barked at itself.
I harvest hope that you never loved me as I have always loved you, that our fortuitous touches meant nothing, that the something in our glances was only one-sided. Maybe, just maybe, our strange relationship—if I can call it that—meant nothing to you but kindness and pity towards an anomalous flatmate. Perhaps, if you never loved me as I have always loved you, you aren’t hurting.
John moved a hand against Sherlock’s waist, and the slave stepped back, pressed against the wall. His lips moved against John’s lips, hungry, eager. His tongue felt John’s and a heavy breath escaped his lungs. So John, kissing Sherlock, tugged the slave’s shirt from his trousers and slid his hand against the warm skin of his back and his ribs.
On this afternoon, Sherlock was animated and giddy, shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows. John couldn’t recall the last time he had seen Sherlock so excited.
If only he could give Sherlock his freedom, but it was illegal and punishable. There were reasons slaves were slaves, and so slaves remained slaves. He could return Sherlock, 03172, if he so desired, but who knows where the man would end up.
Too late now. You hesitated. “Yes…” I whisper, eyes widening. “Yes, she did! I knew it.” My voice raises, and I can’t help but throw my hands up for emphasis.
When they got back into the flat, Sherlock was being crushed with the need of an answer. “Why?” his voice cracked, but only oh so slightly.
“Something of the sort.” Sherlock slid his hands into his coat pockets, contemplating. “A consulting detective, actually. The world’s only.”
It’s raining outside and it reminds me of that day. The one you asked me to delete. Begged me to just delete from my head. You should understand by now why I can’t. Why I don’t want to. Why I would never.
John tried again, taking a step forward, rocking onto his back foot, then front again. "I said, don't."
Sherlock continued staring into John's eyes; he considered it a sort of experiment. How far could he push this new master of his? He might as well test it out the water. His new owner had obviously never owned a slave prior to Sherlock, himself. This would be effortless.
He rolled his sleeves back down his forearms as subtly as possible, but John noticed, and he watched Sherlock fidget his white shirt back into place around his wrists. The detective rambled on.
Listening to Sherlock's controlled breathing, watching Sherlock's fingers twitch, it occurred to John that relax may have been taken as an order. A command from a master to his slave. It wasn't what John wanted, but really, did it matter? No, whispered his unwelcome subconscious.
"Really? I wasn't aware of my lack of possessions. Thank you for reminding me. I apologize for the inconvenience." Sarcasm rang through his words.
This time it was a flash of fear that rested on Sherlock's facial features. Fear and shame and vulnerability. They were there, no matter how hard the slave tried to cover them up with false arrogance, and John hated the way the emotions rested on the angular face. The shirt slid off, and Sherlock's eyes stared at the wall past John's head in quiet defiance.
John had signed the papers, collected his “property”, and the two were now standing in John’s new flat, 221B Baker Street. The cab ride had been tense with silence. The slave hadn't spoken a word, but John hadn't prompted him to. Isn't this how things were supposed to go? The whole: don't speak unless spoken to? Whatever the matter, it left John acutely embarrassed and aware of his lack of slave-related knowledge… etiquette? It had never been relevant.
"Of course," she continued. "I am sure, with the proper training, he could become most pleasurable and obedient…”
He let his eyes travel over Sherlock’s sleeping form, and even in sleep he looked guarded. A man of solid marble. An untouchable figure, a god, submerged in his own mind.
"You've got a violin," Sherlock uttered suddenly, disgusted with how weak his voice sounded. He just needed to say something—anything—to get John to do something other than what he was doing now.
John was silent. He was feeling something, but he couldn’t decide what. Empathy, anger, frustration, admiration. “Let me see your back.”
He imagined Sherlock roughed up and on his knees, arms spread wide, chained in each direction. He imagined blood trailing from Sherlock’s wrists down his arms, down his body. He imagined Sherlock’s captors: brutish, burly men with sinister faces, faces that laughed as they pressed their burning cigarettes to Sherlock’s skin and laughed as Sherlock tried not to hiss through gritted teeth.
Soft cries caress your trembling lips, and the nightmares implode your sleeping brain. Couldn’t they be about me, John, just this once? My desire: dream about me. Another: to run a finger across your parted lips. Kiss them, maybe. Definitely. I would bite at them and taste your blood. Bliss. Don’t be afraid of me.
John knew the request was coming sooner or later, and laughed lightly. “Oh why not, just don’t be too hard on the bastard.”
The single surviving presence in the consciousness of Doctor John Watson holds the title of Consulting Detective, and there’s only one in the world.
Rain hit the taxi roof as John cabbed home from the hospital; he got out of the car and heard gunshots. Sherlock.
‘Sincerely, Your Sociopath.’ Concludes the contents of the first envelope. There are still two more. John Watson stands stock still. The flat itself, the shuffling of Mrs. Hudson downstairs, Mary at home, none of it means anything in his mind.
Sherlock straightened, looking up at John, missing the something he had been filled with moments ago. Missing the fervor he’d been alight with. “You’re talking about my wrists.”
That’s what most days were like: waiting and reading and trying not to remember things he wanted to forget, but it was hard because Sherlock’s mind was a palace.
John sat in his arm chair with the morning newspaper. He lifted his eyes as Sherlock entered the room in an old dressing gown of John's. His gaze followed the man. John'd always thought—known—he was straight, but he couldn't deny the subtle hints of attraction for the slave in front of him. The royal blue robe had always been too long on John, but it was a gift from Harriet, and an uncharacteristically expensive one at that. On Sherlock, it looked... Wow, it looked magnificent. It hung over his broad shoulders and fit his torso nicely, draping and flattering his narrow hips. The deep blue complimented his nearly translucent skin and dark curls.
“Sherlock,” he boomed, “and John, I hope the both of you enjoyed your night. You know,” he continued, facing John, “this man got me out of a sentence of servitude, he did! I would’ve been a slave without him! Proved me innocent of murder—he’s a good man, this Sherlock.”
I read once, I don’t know when—sometime in my childhood, “First we feel. Then we fall.” James Joyce, I think. I found it tucked away in the dusty corners of my mind. Astonishingly suiting to our situation. My side of it anyway, because I never felt anything at all my whole life. Nothing but the meaningless high of narcotics or the lonely superiority that comes as a package deal with a mind such as mine. Then I met you, you met me, and I could finally see in colour.
When the two were finished and satisfied with their plates of pasta, ready to leave, Angelo came over and slung a merry hand down on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Now, half of him felt guilty and heavy with a strange foreign shame, and the other half told that half to shut up and get over it. This is how things are now, it said.
That night I read the letters, I knew I loved you. I waited and waited and waited for you to come back, to burst through the door, curls dripping with raindrops. Your face would be lit up with one of those rare, genuine smiles because you caught the killer and you proved your genius.
This time he went too far, John knew that for sure. Would there be an adapted normal waiting tomorrow? Probably not, because John Watson went too fucking far and he knew it.
Let me tell you, John Watson. Now, death sounds like a melody to me. A lilting melody tugged gently from the minor of my violin. I want to hear more.
Sherlock rose, suppressing the urge to make any sort of noise as a deep, throbbing raked down his back. He met John's eyes defiantly. They used to be oddly warm, and now they were dark with something that arose goosebumps along Sherlock’s exposed flesh. The flip had finally switched. John Watson, caring army doctor, was gone. John Watson, slave owner, had made his inevitable entrance, his grand opening. Sherlock knew it would happen; he was still surprised.
When John awoke, Sherlock wasn’t lying next to him in bed. Drifting from the sitting room was a soft melody, lilting from the strings of that old violin.
Did you know, John? That when I was just a little boy, the doctors called me a sociopath? Diagnosed me with a label to last my life. I hated it, until I had no choice but to use it as my shield. Sherlock is a freak. Not a freak, a sociopath. Does he even have feelings? Of course not, I am a sociopath. Sherlock, you machine. Yes, it is only expected. I am a sociopath.
I thought I might’ve loved you, at times. Really, I did. I guess you knew that, since you knew everything, but I refused to admit that I was wrong to marry Mary. No matter how many times I have denied it, no matter how many times I have told myself that no, I do not have feelings for my flatmate, I still do.
Let him—make him—play the bloody slave, John thought bitterly. He’d gotten enough chances with John’s empathy. For once, there was no ‘rebelling’ that could be done.
One morning John went to make tea,  and Sherlock was sitting at the table, reading the newspaper, deducing the criminals and the fraud from the headlines, and rolling his eyes at the stupidity of Scotland Yard. John made his tea and stepped to the fridge from milk. A huff of breath puffed from parts lips.
John, again, was thrown for a loop. He didn’t remember telling Sherlock about the lunch, or maybe he just hadn’t expected Sherlock to retain any of their mundane conversation.
It made Sherlock wonder if John kissed him because he wanted to or kissed him because he could. Sherlock walked to the corner shop and bought the milk.
One last thing before I begin: I am a sociopath. I love you. I am a walking contradiction, and I perplex even myself.
“It was because of Harry, wasn’t it? Because of the way I’ve been acting towards you? Tell me,” he demanded, quiet and desperate and raw with startling emotion that was always so hidden.
Sherlock registered John's contradicting facial expressions. “Sorry?” he scoffed. “That was a perfectly expected response to my attempted influence over your mindset and command. You’re just like all the rest of them,” Sherlock began, rubbing his fingers over an already swelling jaw. “Your violence just then, was necessary, some might say, to teach me a lesson. Many have tried, I'll let you know. Doesn't seem to work on me. Right now, I was merely testing you, seeing how far I'd have to go to get retaliation—an experiment. Thank you for the input you've so considerately given me." He couldn't help the amount of sarcasm that dripped from his words.
The sound of their breathing—heavy and hot and wanting—seemed to echo in the stillness of the flat. John ground his lips along Sherlock’s jaw. His fingers slid down the slave’s torso and over the front of his trousers. Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath was followed by a harsh groan as John grabbed his length through the fabric, kneading the growing bulge.
If Doctor John Watson knew anything at all, if he knew just one simple fact, it was that he had to set this right.
He could feel the heat from Sherlock’s body seeping into his fingertips. Please don’t wake up. He could feel the murmuring heartbeat that proved Sherlock was alive. Living. Human. Capable of love? Please don’t wake up. John inhaled and exhaled in sync with Sherlock’s sleeping form.
An expression somewhere between annoyed and pitying crossed the slave’s face. “You are completely out of your depth, aren’t you?”
I’m sitting in a cheap motel room in eastern Europe. I wish it was our flat. Are you still there, John? In our flat?
Sherlock laid himself down upon the couch, ignoring his back's discomfort. As long as he could help it, he would not get in John Watson’s bed. He closed his eyes, but sleep never came.
You said, “Sherlock, I don’t know what to do.” I was silent, of course. You treated me like I was unconscious. “I love Mary,” you continued. I tried my hardest not to grimace. You would have realized that my mind was in fact not in the clouds, but next to you. “But I think.” You cleared your throat. “I might.” I knew you licked your lips even with my eyes closed. It’s a habit of yours, and I have catalogued your habits. “I might love you, too… sometimes.” You sat and watched me; I could feel your blue eyes boring into my skin. Finally you got up with a sigh. I began to drown in thought. Thoughts regarding you and only you.
John looked down and cleared his throat. Sherlock was trying guilt out for a go, reminding John of what he’d done, reminding John of Sherlock’s status and the wrongness of slavery. “Would you show me your back, Sherlock?” he asked, looking up.
Angelo’s thick arms wrapped around Sherlock’s lanky frame in a quick embrace. “I haven’t seen you in a few years! Where you been?”
I’m sorry. I miss you. I hope you understand. You always understand. You’re the only one who has ever understood. Still I think my heart has scars you never could understand. But that isn’t your fault, it’s mine. All of it is my fault. That isn’t a surprise to either of us, but I am admitting it, and surely that in itself was unforeseen.
“So this is why you’re so excited all of a sudden,” John said, corner of his mouth tilting upward. “It isn’t decent.”
“Got yourself a slave, eh?” One of them asked, something more than curiosity flickering through wolfish eyes. John explained the army deal.
I don’t know why I love you and that is the most incomprehensible and infuriating obstacle I have ever encountered.
Sherlock’s eyelids opened to the glowing light of late morning drifting through the flat window, and when it caught his half-lidded eyes, he imagined he was in his four-poster childhood bed. Reality struck with a defining blow.
"You can stop. Nothing can help me, let alone a disabled army doctor with a psychosomatic limp, disturbed mental state, lack of leadership skills he was so sure he possessed, with nobody to call a friend or close family, currently unemployed and constantly worrying about his financial state.”
Dr. Watson cleaned and dressed wounds on Sherlock’s back for the second time, but this time it was different. This time he was their artist. The guilt was overwhelming.
“Unless you hadn’t been,” he said, voice lowered. And John wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s neck and kissed him hard, with what Sherlock felt wasn’t quite desire, which was more like rage, or perhaps a combination of the two that was uniquely John Watson.
Sherlock raised an annoyed eyebrow, so John sighed and continued. He had never felt the need to know much of anything about slavery before this. See no evil, hear no evil, the whole deal. "What do I do with you? ...I mean, what have your owners-“ The world was still bulky as it rolled off of his tongue. “-had you do in the past?"
When he spoke, Sherlock’s voice was a breath, but it seemed to echo through the room’s silence. “I thought about you.”
"Yeah, I got that, Sherlock. Thanks.” John rubbed the back of his neck. "They said it was the only one available."
The doctor grabbed an old t-shirt and sweats, holding them out for Sherlock. "Should be big enough," he said, like nothing had changed, but everything had.
When the door shut behind her, John sighed, running his hands through his short hair. “Thanks, Sherlock,” he breathed, furious with cold, empty rage. Maybe “be nice” was, in fact, a threat.
Her mouth widened a little. “Quite the looker, isn’t he,” she said, laughing a little. “Lucky you, John.”
So John steps up to the door and wraps his fingers around the knocker. That’s when he notices that his hand is not mapped and layered with crevices of wrinkles and frail, papery skin. No, it’s calloused and tough and his fingers are those of a doctor’s. John bites his cheek, tilts his head, and furrows his eyebrows. This is… odd.
John got a job at the surgery; Sherlock lounged around at the flat, and on rare occasions he followed John shopping or to work or other mundane, tedious chores of the sort. He hated people—people staring at the numbers on his neck with such disgust one might think they were contagious. John pretended not to notice. Sherlock continuously baited John, waiting for the switch to flip in his mind. It would happen, he reminded himself whenever John shot him a smile, whenever Sherlock became too comfortable. It would happen, and Sherlock would mean nothing whatsoever to John Watson. Sooner was better than later. Don't get attached. You will mean nothing to John, and John will mean everything to you. Caring is not an advantage.
Sherlock took a long moment to gaze at John before he lowered his head again. "That was really dangerous and stupid of you. But... thank you, John."
"We're trying to find the firepower to deal with these snipers!" Lestrade shouted at him as he holstered a gun to his chest. "They're goddamn everywhere!"
"Hold onto that pocket-watch. Keep it safe." Sherlock said as they walked out of the building. "He'll want it for payment later."
He heard Sherlock gasp across the room. "John!" The Consulting Detective rushed to John's side. He was covered in blood, and he ran his iron-smelling blood-covered hand across John's cheek. "John... Oh, you're awake... I brought us home...!" He sounded both desperate and crazed as he said this.
"I'm not like you... I... wasn't the one who pulled the trigger. I couldn't have been. It wasn't me!
Sherlock didn't seem to remember anything, but he did mumble, "That does sound interesting... A killer is trying to frame me? Very clever on their part."
He wanted to convince himself that the phone had been broken, but the odds of that were slim since Sherlock's phone was quite durable.
He found Magnussen sitting on a white couch, his arm wrapped around Sherlock, who was leaning against his chest and was still beaten but now fully dressed. Sherlock looked traumatized, and did not respond to John's entry.
"Our killer is likely faking being a rookie to get my attention. It's working. Now, if they are not a rookie, they likely have accomplices to keep an eye on targets, and whether or not they are leaving. I would be their current target, it would seem. If I were to attempt to leave London by subway, they would know.
"No, no! You tell me what's rational, Mycroft! A man I SHOT IN THE HEAD is ALIVE! Is that rational?!"
"Worst of all, perhaps, is I think this may make his first time. This is going to leave some emotional scarring, most likely... My brother has a hard time letting go of things like this, which is understandable."
Silently, Sherlock showed John his phone. The text said, "Baker Street, now. Took your landlady out for a night on the town. Nice flat you and John have here. Damn shame."
Though he seemed to be trying to hide it, he did appear a bit annoyed. "It's not like Sherlock was working alone, either. It was only fair that I have a 'partner in crime' for a small amount of time."
Sherlock tried to appear unhurt as he got into the limo, but forgot that he still had blood on his face... not that the driver cared.
"John..." Sherlock said quietly, "How is it, I wonder, that you can be kind to me...? I mean, everyone else hates me... Why on earth don't you...?"
"I won't send anyone after him. All I want is you, Sherlock. If you come with me, he'll be safe from both you and I."
, Sherlock?" Moriarty asked quizzically. "Don't shoot your beloved doctor? Because you know that's what I intend to do in the long run anyway."
Sherlock's eyes widened at that name, and his jaw fell a bit slack. The name appeared to mean a lot to him for some reason, so much so that he was now petrified.
"In the middle of a-" He cringed in pain for a moment, but managed to get a handle on it this time. "- subway station full of people? We've made too much of a scene as it is. We have to
After a couple of minutes, he got half of a text that appeared to have been written by Sherlock. But only half, as though he'd pressed send too soon. It was possible he had done it intentionally because whatever was going on hadn't quite concluded yet.
The room was pitch-black but for a chair across the room illuminated by a lamp. Tied to this chair, with his head down, was Sherlock, however when he heard the door squeak open, he raised his head, revealing the gag around his mouth. Seeing John, a look of horror slowly emerged in his pale blue eyes.
Maybe if he kept bragging about Sherlock, Moriarty would be frustrated at the prospect of being unable to change his mind.
Sherlock turned to Lestrade. "We'll be following shortly in a taxi. I just need to have a few quick words with John first."
"My family's estate is not too far from here, so I go home sometimes to see Redbeard." John shifted. Estate. Sherlock didn't mean a housing estate either.
"Yes, I'm fine. I was just zoning out." Sherlock nodded unconvinced and looked back to the window. After a moment, John opened his mouth to speak.
He leant back in his chair, his eyes scanning the back of Sherlock's head. He was bent, the lumps of his spine showing through his shirt, writing quickly. The visibility of his spine made John feel uneasy but he shook his head. Sherlock was not of his concern.John glanced across the rest of the classroom, all his peers bent too in concentration. There was sunshine coming in from the window to Sherlock's left, illuminating Sherlock's left side. His skin looked almost translucent and, if he were to squint, John was sure he would see the blood pulsing through Sherlock's veins.
"Yes- but they'll charge you £5 for it." John didn't have £5. Sherlock knew that. Sherlock was being nice.
Once, in the middle of a maths exam, there was a knock on the door and, when the student was beckoned in, John saw it was Harry. She was in Sixth Form and thus did not have to wear uniform and looked serious and business like in her black dress. Her face was straight set, and she spoke to John’s teacher in a low tone. He could tell from the look on her face something was wrong – she had barely looked him in the eye when a lump formed hard and pressing in his throat. There was an underlying murmur from the class as John was excused from the lesson, shouldering his satchel bag as quickly as he could.
“Yes…well, thanks.” John mumbled, watching Anderson as he glanced to their table occasionally. “But we’re not going out. I’m not into…men. I’m just trying to make friends with him.” Greg nodded.
"Fucking hell." John sat bolt upright gripping the covers of his duvet, the welcome pack sliding off his lap and onto the floor. The room was darker than when he had lay down, the sun less intense in the sky, washing the room in a peachy orange glow. There was a figure in the doorway. John bent down to pick up the pack off the floor.
“It’s quite grey.” John nodded. They turned a corner, walking passed a structure on a green that looked like the kremlin and towards the sea front.
“Do you exist solely antagonise me, or do you have other purposes?” Anderson said nothing. He turned around to meet Anderson’s eyes. “I didn’t think so. Let me be. I am none of your concern.” Phillip dropped his gaze and Sherlock turned quickly to go upstairs.
“Yeah, Sherlock I’m fine. God, we’re so stupid.” John chuckled, standing from his seat and walking directly into Sherlock’s body, causing him to fall back. “Oh shit, Sherlock. Sorry, are you alright?” Sherlock nodded, chuckling again.
"It's fine. He's a bit of a bitch sometimes." This made John laugh and Sherlock looked back at him with a grin.
"Are - are you my roommate?" John enquired. He partly wanted Mike to say no, simply because he couldn't remember anything about the boy and he would have to fill in parts of information when he could. He hadn’t seen him since primary school, so he wasn’t sure how Mike remembered him.
“What do you mean.” He replied, his brow furrowing. John was not sober enough to have this conversation.
Ive planned the entire fic and you guys better be strapped in for a rollercoaster. I think there's gonna be about 20 more chapters.
“Good play, John!” Mike called next to him. The whistle had been blown for half time and John was walking from his corner, passed them and towards the hut. The boy had stuck his hand up to wave in response, a sheepish grin on his face. Sherlock noticed how John’s gaze seemed to be meeting his.
“I don’t really understand what is going on, I won’t lie to you.” He heard Greg laugh. “But as long as John’s team wins.”
“It’s no problem, John.” Sherlock replied, walking towards his desk to finish John’s paper. John turned off his lamp, leaving Sherlock’s brain rattling nosily in the dark.
“Sorry.” John replied, a little guilty. Sherlock was trying to open up to him and he had immediately shunned him for it.
"Here's something." Sherlock called to John, who was unconsciously staring out to sea, perhaps wanting to drown himself in it. "John!" He turned around and walked over to Sherlock, who was standing by a lump of aged grey stone. They were on some grassy knoll overlooking the impressively blue sea. Their teacher had told them to be at the hostel by 9 pm so until then they had free reign to do as they please. They needed to collect data and were told they could ‘look around the shopping outlet’ as long as they could carry things they bought themselves.
He filled the kettle at the tap and put it onto boil, the machine making a satisfying click when the button was pushed. Behind him, people were talking. There were around 18 people in his dorm, which was only lower six, as well as teacher. John still hadn't seen the dorm tutor and wondered if they really existed at all or if it was a scare tactic. Either way, it seemed to work. The behaviour was exemplar.
The next morning, Sherlock was no where to be seen. Perhaps he had already woken up? John doubted it, and tried to suppress the bubble of anxiety in his stomach with a cup of strong tea. He wasn’t sure why he cared about Sherlock, but he did, and his roommates abrupt comings and goings put him on edge. The least he could do is let him know what he was doing. He guessed Sherlock didn’t owe him that, they weren’t friends after all.
John decided to go to the try outs the next morning. It was a warm morning, the ground arguably too hard to play rugby on, but they wanted a team by rugby season. Then they could win the cup. Greg was there too, looking slightly better than the morning before but still a little grey, but other than him John was unfamiliar with the rest of people trying out.
“We went back to the hostel too.” Sherlock seemed to be more sober than John, but he could see the flamboyant hand gestures already coming out of him, the alcohol quickly catching up to him. The boy had waved his hand around like an accessory when speaking and this made John chortle. “What are you laughing at, Watson?” Sherlock demanded from across the circle. John swallowed. The sudden attention change had caught him off guard and, even though the Watson had been said in a joking manner, John’s stomach still flipped.
"Bollocks to what's safe John! What's the point in always being safe? You don't get to live!" He stood up suddenly and gestured widely, stumbling slightly at the power of his own arms. John grabbed him by his arm and sat him down. "This is living John! Drinking and sunsets and being with people you love." Sherlock paused and took a swig of the echo falls. He then rolled the bottle behind them. It made a clattering sound as it found its home next to one of the barriers. "And the sea. I love the sea. I love the way it smells and the colours. They look like your eyes." Sherlock looked to John, who blushed slightly. "I like your eyes. I like the way they reflect light. Like the sea." Sherlock took the bottle of prosecco, shook it vigorously and popped its cork. Prosecco rained on their laps and the fork flew into the waves. John watched as it floated away.
“He’s strange. Sherlock Holmes. Self destructive in more ways than one.” John swallowed, the words hanging in the air.
As the car rolled ahead, John folded his hands in his lap. He felt anxious. New people. New, rich people with more money John could ever dream of owning. How could he be friends with people he couldn’t relate to? Perhaps he could pretend to be some prince from somewhere in Eastern Europe. As he deliberated this, the car began moving up hill, the stones crunchy under the wheels. Somewhere behind him, John heard the gates slam and he suddenly realised that this was all very real. Perhaps they would like him for who he was. Perhaps people would like his awkward laugh and love for knitted wear. Perhaps they would be able to ignore that he didn’t belong there, at least not financially, and he could make friends. And, as John began to wish, the car turned up the drive and towards the school.
"Oh, hello Sherlock." Philip replied bitterly. He turned his head towards John. "Would you like to come to breakfast with me, John." John almost spat out his drink and watched Sherlock stifle a laugh out of the corner of his eye.
One of Sherlock's shelves had collapsed and was hanging off the wall. It was only one side, so all the objects had slid off the shelf and onto the floor. Sherlock was on his hands and knees picking the objects up and putting them on his double bed.
"Yes Sir, sorry sir." John got up from his seat and walked over to the front desk, where there was a stack of papers.
“I’ll get that then.” Sherlock said to John. Mike offered to go and order and, when the others offered to pay, Mike refused. This made John shift uncomfortably in his chair, he didn’t like relying on others. Sherlock looked across to him and half smiled. John stopped moving.
That evening, Sherlock and John sat at their respective desks, bent over the text books they had gotten from class. John had not pressed further about Sherlock’s conversation with Mr McGowan. If he wanted to talk to him about it, Sherlock would have done so. Instead they formed friendly conversation about the previous exam (which Sherlock jokingly said was rigged in John’s favour) as well as John’s match the following week. Sherlock seemed to want to watch again which excited John. He didn’t take Sherlock as much as a sports man, in fact John was sure he didn’t even know how the game was played, so he hoped Sherlock wanted to come simply to support him.
With the blow of a whistle, the game begun, and Sherlock found himself drifting his gaze to John, who was currently standing still, rather than on the ball. It frustrated him, being unable to unlock John. It was easy to do with others – they opened up so simply. Take Mike, for example, his family had a large amount of money, his grandmother acting as the head of family with all the wealth. He flaunted it, not purposefully, but obviously enough. He always wore a heavy strapped Rolex on his wrist, his glasses from some brand like Gucci or Prada. His shoes always perfectly souled, the leather well kept. They were small things, but they made Mike appear more like a person, he was sure he could ask Mike what car he drove, what clothes brand he wore and Mike would tell him. John, however, falsely opened up. He said enough that made him appear approachable and interesting (which he was) but it was a façade. He had a sister, some form of parental figure, but after that it was lost. It was purposeful, all of it, from the jumpers he wore to the work he did. It all acted as a wall against the outside world. Sherlock scuffed his foot against the soft ground in frustration. He wished John would trust him more outwardly, but somehow knew that would never happen. He was a puzzle, not one that necessarily needed to be solved, but one that he wanted to see the picture of. One that he wanted to understand yet Sherlock knew John would never allow that. At least not for a while.
“And which team is that?” He cleared his throat again, the man cocking his eyebrow in response, standing from his chair.
“I see. Well, Sherlock Holmes is a most peculiar boy. You must have seen yourself. I’m surprised that you’re friends with him at all.” John felt his back bristle, suddenly wanting to argue against what this man was saying about his friend.
“Shut up Mike, you’re no saint. There’s nothing wrong with it John, you can tell us.” It was tempting to tell them, but John backtracked.
“What’s happening with you and Sherlock then, John?” Greg asked suddenly as they were approaching the brow of the hill.
“They are.” John wasn’t sure where this conversation was going, but decided to engage anyway. Late Stage Drunk Sherlock was his favourite.
When he returned to the dorm, Sherlock was gone. John didn’t know where and he didn’t particularly care. He knew he acted irrationally and he should apologise, but right now John couldn’t even bare to think of looking at Sherlock, let alone speaking to him.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” But the boy seemed to only be able to nod in reply before he moved towards John, Sherlock’s lips pressing hard against his own. John moved onto his knees so Sherlock did not have to bend down so much. Sherlock seemed to agree with this position very much, his hands gently pulling at the hairs of John’s head as he kissed him with his tongue. The room was completely silent filled only by the sound of the occasional rustle of the bed sheets against Sherlock’s back as the leant down slowly, allowing John to sit himself on his stomach, John’s lips moving in synch with Sherlock’s. His counterpart had moved his hands to John’s waist, gently moving his fingers across his hips and along the button of his trousers.
The night before, John had packed a small bag, containing books and a notepad for his coursework. He also packed a jumper, just in case. Although they were staying overnight, John didn’t feel the need to pack pyjamas, he would sleep in his day clothes. When they awoke the Wednesday morning, John donned a white and mustard striped top and a pair of washed out blue jeans. Sherlock, on the other hand, work attire that still seemed formal. A white button shirt, which had been undone by a few button, and a pair of grey trousers
He turned over to see if Sherlock was in bed. When he had fallen asleep, Sherlock had not returned and John didn't hear him come in. Yet Sherlock was there, asleep in his bed, his curls were splayed across the pillow and he seemed too at rest to wake. John didn't know if he ought to wake the sleeping boy, but the second bell did not stir Sherlock.
This time, John walked with Sherlock and Greg and Mike walked together. They were behind him and Greg seemed to be having a hard time getting Mike to talk sense. Although it was unlikely, there was a chance that a teacher would ask where they had been and Mike seemed to be the one most likely to expose them for their drunken escapades. It seemed as though the school’s rampant alcohol problem was to be kept on grounds and nowhere else. Occasionally, John would hear Greg interject ‘you can’t say that Mike, they’ll know.’ in a tired voice. Although John knew he ought to be helping, Greg’s concerned seemed pointless, there was no way of hiding Mike’s drunkenness.
Sherlock didn't argue further. Instead he looked one last time at John before reaching again for the limo's door to close it.
"Well, I've technically already hurt him... Damned guy's leaking blood all over my damned trunk. A bit late for that plea, doctor!"
"Would you like your cellphone back?" Magnussen asked. When he got no response, he slowly walked over to Moriarty and dug out Sherlock's cell. He tossed it at the Consulting Detective, who caught it without bothering to look.
"Oh, I... I'm sorry, I didn't realize how close the bed was..." Sherlock chuckled nervously as he tried to get back up.
"I don't need any of those idiots that think I'm a 'freak'. Just don't ever try to hurt me, and my opinion on the rashness of human error, that being attachment, will go un-conflicted." If things weren't already strange, Sherlock Holmes was now somewhat-indirectly complimenting John Watson, and saying the doctor was the only human he had any sort of attachment to. It was both somewhat sweet and insanely revealing as to how shaken Sherlock was to know who the victim of their latest case was.
Sherlock gazed down at the floor, appearing to be waiting helplessly for John, or rather the person he was imagining him to be, to go further.
Moriarty stepped out as he got close. "Ah, Doctor Watson! Glad you could join us. Come in, come in."
But was losing Sherlock really worth it? Without Sherlock, Moriarty would have no competition. He would win.
He quivered, almost able to feel the sensation of the man's hands running themselves down his sides.
That reply actually seemed to make him think, and in response to that he for some reason looked John over with his pale blue eyes.
Sherlock grabbed John's arm to hold him back. Moriarty took a clumsy step back and sniggered before spitting out a glob of blood.
Sherlock smirked a bit. "I worry this may not be even in your power, though, Magnussen. How can I trust you'll get the job done?"
"Ha ha, you really fell for it? It is only a signature, Dr. Watson. SH" Mockingly, the texter put Sherlock's signature. It dawned on him... It was impossible, but there was no other explanation... JM had to be Jim Moriarty's initials.
As usual, Sherlock didn't seem to care. He tried to keep shooting the wall, only for the gun to click. "Out of ammo."
"Sherlock, you've been through physical and mental trauma. I really think you should get checked out."
" were practically dug into the wall opposite of the bedroom door, with a smiley face drawn into the "
Sherlock looked over at Moriarty, but didn't seem very phased to see his arch-nemesis standing in the doorway. "Oh." He casually, flatly, spoke. "It's you."
"He's weaker now. He suffered a severe beating to his head and was forced to 'delete' many things from his memory."
After being helped back to his room, he was only alone in peace for a couple of minutes before he heard what sounded like a small commotion.
Sherlock placed one of his hands on the back of John's neck as he continued to accept and return the kiss. He was a surprising good kisser, considering he wasn't one to engage in anything like this very often.
Suddenly, Sherlock sat up, seeming to have reached some sort of epiphany. "That... That bullet was fake. The one in the chamber was real, but the second was fake...!"
"I'm not going to help you, Sherlock. I can't do something like that; I'd get into a great deal of trouble."
The presence of another armed man behind him prevented him from going very far. The culprit stepped closer, the barrel of his gun now inches from John's forehead.
"Tsk, tsk, tsk. I have no intention of getting arrested, I just want the heat on me. I want to fool them into thinking it's me so that the real killer will show himself to me. That shouldn't be
"Well, if it comes down to that, you'll have won fair and square. But I don't intend to let it go down like that."
Sherlock stared at John with a strange face. "What on Earth do we have to offer someone like Mycroft? Our dying loyalty? He's already got most of the British government under his fingertips."
"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that, Dr. Watson... But I suppose in your defense, he does do a pretty damn good job of hiding his feelings on just about anything, doesn't he? Well, I mean, not now, at least. Look at him, he looks absolutely terrified! It's hilarious what a little bit of blackmail can do!"
"Why? Because I have aspirations that aren't fueled by a desire to work on the side of the angels?" The criminal sung.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks. "Oh, what if it's under her nails, too? Dammit! I should've cleaned her nails while we were in there. How clumsy of me to forget about her nails!" It almost sounded like he didn't want the killer to get caught... or worse and more unbelievable yet, like maybe he was the killer.
"Because if he was, he wouldn't have been able to push the detonator, because it's right here beside me. Aren't I a kidder? Ha ha!! - JMx"
The criminal hung up and walked over to them. "How cute. I almost feel bad for this." He said sarcastically as he aimed his gun at Sherlock's head.
The way he had said that was strange, though. What good would it do Sherlock now? Unless he had faked his death, he wouldn't know whether John lived or died.
"We're not sure. But we determined that the rest of his wounds were probably also self-inflicted... All of the blood on him and the knife was his own..."
An hour and a half passed, though it felt more like an eternity, before John's phone started to ring.
"Sherlock was a goody-two-shoed little idiot. Face it, you just can't handle the fact that I so easily destroyed him."
"It was an exchange! Not my fault Moriarty's snipers suck at hitting a moving target." Sherlock turned to the door, but Lestrade blocked his path. "Let me out, Gary."
However, when Mary caught sight of him a little later in the day, she seemed concerned by him, as if she knew him. Without a word, the man then left and approached his limousine outside.
"What hurts more, Dr. Watson? Losing Sherlock to me, or losing Sherlock to me and then having me send him back to C.A.M.?" was what it said.
Sherlock fell silent for a moment. "... Uh, sorry, did... Did you assume I was asking what you thought of me as a romantic interest? Because that's... well, that's... not what I meant, John."
"E-eh... Y-you... I..." He seemed to be thinking of some clever rebuttal, but wasn't able to come up with anything on the spot.
They quickly ran into the issue that there was only one bed, since Lestrade had not thought Sherlock would accompany John.
On the EKG, Sherlock's heart rate began to increase as he continued "deducing". He was beginning to quiver and stammer slightly.
He couldn't help but think about the theory that Sherlock had brought up in his dream. Was it at all possible that Sherlock had merely faked his own death?
"Doctor Watson!" He heard a nurse outside of his room shout, likely the one that had walked past a few minute ago, along with some high-heeled footsteps approaching his room.
"Taking exciting cases is what we do together, right? If we skipped out on a case, we'd skip out on another, and then we'd never do anything fun together."
"John... I... Sh-she was... She was going to press the button..." He murmured, trying to explain himself.
John didn't say anything to counter; he knew he lost as he hung his head at the thought of losing the greatest friend he'd ever had.
He couldn't do so; the thought of Sherlock getting shot was haunting him even though he knew it was only a dream.
. Anyway, I think I've had enough fun for one day. I'll leave you two to whatever the heck it is you two do for a while, but try not to miss me too much, 'cause I will be back." The culprit walked past John, and with his men leading him down the hall, he turned back before the stairs. "Oh, and by the way, Dr. Watson... The name's James Moriarty, but you can call me Jim. Smell you later~!" Just like that, Moriarty left.
"You're no fun." Another text from Moriarty read. "I was going to 'blow them away'. Ha ha ha! I suppose they still won't mind a pyrotechnics show... - JMx"
"It doesn't matter right now. I don't have time to bother with medical treatment either way. Let's-" His left leg gave out, and he nearly slipped.
Moriarty used his head to gesture at his two remaining men, and they approached Sherlock, grabbing his arms roughly and restraining him.
"I can change that." Sherlock reached for the knife, but then froze for a moment and shook his head. He cleared his throat before picking up the knife and putting it into his pocket. "Let's get out of here, then. Before I do something stupid."
"John, you can't give up now. We can't rest yet; he's still coming after us! That's why we need to go!" However, the Consulting Detective left their pursuer unnamed.
"I..." Sherlock tried to think why he thought that, but seemed to have immense difficulty and only caused himself to gain an even worse headache. "I don't know..."
The restaurant was simplistic but almost romantic in nature. Sherlock took a seat at a table by a window and took off his scarf and coat. Upon seeing the famous man, the owner of the modest little restaurant seemed eager to rush up and greet him, but was preoccupied with another customer for the moment.
"Well, hey, I'm sure my partner can pleasure him better than you can, even if there's fighting and blackmail involved. Have you two even done it yet? Or are you two not a thing now?"
Their reception was wonderful. Lestrade was there, and so was Mrs. Hudson, who had long since recovered herself. However, the one person he didn't expect to see, but did out of the corner of his eye, hovering near the exit, was Magnussen.
"... It was a personal conversation. I had a moment of weakness and I needed to talk to someone, and for some ungodly reason, I chose him."
"If you say so. I just hope he'll be okay. So far, running off on his own hasn't proved very much good."
The man quickly stepped into the limousine himself, closing the door behind him as the vehicle started to move.
Sherlock looked down at him. He was going in for another kiss when suddenly one of the two cellphones in John's pocket started to ring.
"You'd be surprised how easily he changes his mind when he's alone." Sherlock replied with a small smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.
The wound didn't look fatal on its own, but combined with the blood that still gushed from it, it looked really bad. There was no exit wound, implying that the bullet was still inside Sherlock's body. That would hurt, but nonetheless prevent extreme blood loss.
You’re waking up screaming. I become the shadows. I’ve always been the shadows. You don’t see me, and I can’t help but wonder if you ever see me. You’re beautiful when you cry. Why are you beautiful? Of course you’re beautiful; You’re everything.
So then I fell. First I felt, then I fell. Poetry. It wasn’t just the plummet of my body towards the pavement. It was the metaphoric destruction of my pulsing heart. It was the unimaginably rapid decent of my being. From a life with you to a life without.
If you flipped through a dictionary, Sherlock thought, and looked up the entry for kind, you'd see an image of John Watson. Well, maybe.
“Good, just fine.” He couldn’t keep the smile from his face. “I haven’t seen you in forever! How’s—” John took a deep breath. “How’s rehab been?”
"And so you think this is okay?" John asked in disbelief, propping himself on an elbow and looking over at Sherlock.
He went to bed with him anyway. This time it didn’t feel like desire or rage, but something entirely different. John Watson was a complicated creature.
And finally a reminder: I’d never kill you, John. Not on purpose. Not unless you asked. But maybe not even then, because I am so indisputably selfish.
You see, this is what confuses me. I hate people. I trust nobody. I am a sociopath incapable of feeling. I am a machine.
I’ll let you in on a secret, because no matter what choices you make, I think I will always love you. There. That’s proof. You will never love me, and still I love you. The secret is this: I’m not a sociopath, because I am exploding with feelings. Feelings a sociopath would never feel. You turned my life upside-down. Everything that was right is wrong. I am not a sociopath.
Because you are my everything. I’m nothing but a dark mass of broken and deformed consciousness. I am not my body, I am not the bloody english language, I am not my actions. I am thought and genius suspended in nothing. I am nothing, you are everything. I need you. Don’t you understand?
Our flat is dark, and you are sleeping. You tend to do that, but sleeping is boring. I can tell by your eyelids and your breathing and the haunted whispers and whimpers that caress your chapped lips when you dream about the War that you are in the REM stage of sleeping, paradoxical sleep. I watch you nearly every night: an experiment. You don’t notice. I must blend into the shadows when you awaken screaming or crying or sobbing. I want you to know that my greatest desire is to wrap you tight in my arms or kiss your face, but I stay still and I watch because I know how you treasure your twisted normality and I am far from normal.
John ate breakfast, then Sherlock ate breakfast. John showered, then Sherlock showered. They were developing a routine. Maybe John could get used to it. Sherlock couldn't.
“Yes.” John's fingers were gentle, caring, barely brushing his skin, sending shudders down his spine.
Sherlock attempted to pry himself away, but John's grip on his hips tightened. "There's a violin case against the wall," he managed.
John's mouth was set in a hard line. His deep blue eyes narrowed. His chin jutted as he assed the situation. For a moment, Sherlock was taken aback by the sheer amount of emotion John’s eyes could hold. “I’m helping you," John said, voice low.
“Your friendship means a lot to me too, Sherlock. And I’ll try to remember, just…please be careful.” He paused. “And I’d prefer if you got some form of support.” They held each others gaze.
“I could do it if you would like me to.” Sherlock replied. John looked up at him, his eyes slightly red with blurry tears.
After another round, Greg proposed they buy something to eat and Mike agreed, as did John after a moments hesitation. Greg didn’t wait for Sherlock’s reply to grab menus. The food seemed to be the standard pub food. John decided on toad in the hole, Mike on scampi and chips, Greg settled on bangers and mash.
But he hadn’t. John debated it with himself and, no matter which way he looked at it, Sherlock was in the wrong. Sherlock knee John was worried about him, and it seemed as though the boy wanted to see how far he could bend John before he broke. He was behaving differently, somehow, and the cold and flippant exterior of Sherlock’s behaviour put John on edge. For the remaining time together, they said nothing, Sherlock was writing feverishly almost as if his hand was itching for some kind of activity. John, on the other hand, could not concentrate, his brain swollen with aggravation.
"I haven't seen him since this afternoon." John added. He was almost shouting, there were so many loud voices.
"Sherlock Holmes." He replied, shaking out his curls and shifting his white shirt. "I'm going out for a smoke." Sherlock said nothing more, stood up and walked off. John was left a little startled, the guide still in his hands.
It was on the Thursday, the night before match day, where John felt the worst. His body hurt to move and his brain was cloudy from a lack a sleep. He could barely form coherent sentences and answered most questions with a low huff, his body not yet used to excess movement. That evening, Sherlock decided to intervene.
The next few days were silent. John found he couldn't even look at Sherlock without a twist forming in his stomach. It was anxiety of waiting to apologise, but there was never a right moment. Sherlock would not speak to John in their shared lessons, and in the evenings Sherlock would not return to the dorm. He assumed he was staying at home and walking to school. Then again, there were days when he didn't see Sherlock at all. There was something else to the knot too. When John looked at Sherlock, he felt physically sick with words he wish he could say. But even John was not sure what they were.
Sherlock must have come in at an early hour, because when John awoke Sherlock was in his bed. Instead of waking him like normal, however, John dressed quickly and left, hardly able to stand being near him out of fear of crying for no particular reason. As if Sherlock’s very existence made him feel knotted.
The school seemed larger upfront, the curved glass roof reflecting the sunlight. He was surrounded by fields, the lawn immaculately trimmed and, in the distance, he could see a river. As he climbed the stairs, John wondered if the other buildings were part of the school.
Sherlock himself lay on his back in bed, facing the ceiling. To his right lay his sleeping dorm mate, who sighed gently as he slept. How long had he been staring for? 3 hours? Sherlock resisted rolling over to look at John in the dark. He knew there was no chance he was awake, yet there was a niggling of fear that John would see him. How would he explain that?
"So what brings you here?" He asked, wandering across the room and sitting on the opposite bed. It creaked below his weight.
“What if Huchoo realises it isn’t my work?” John asked with a heavy sigh. Sherlock produced the booklet from John’s desk, flipping through the pages.
“What are you doing down here?” Anderson asked, walking further into the room. He wore his dressing gown too, the belt trailing on the wooden floor.
“I don’t owe you any form of explanation, Phillip.” Sherlock spat pouring milk into the mug. Anderson laughed emptily, shaking his head at Sherlock. “Leave me alone, Anderson.” Suddenly, Anderson got up and stood in front of the doorway. Sherlock had already began walking towards the doorway and had to stop quickly, the tea sloshing over the cup edge and burning his right arm. Both he and Anderson glancing down.
The science rooms were on the left hand side of the building, on the second floor. There were 3 of them, and John's room was in the middle of the 3. The walls were white covered with posters of the periodic table and ionic bonds, with a fume cabinet in the right hand corner and desks in rows of 3. John sat in the middle row, in the right corner, next to the window. He liked being able to look out at the grounds. On this side of the building, he could see the horses.
Sherlock did not necessary struggle with human emotions, but he simply found them frustrating. They took too much time to deal with – Sherlock could be doing so much more if his own emotions or others did not exist. Sherlock had mastered the art of blurring his own emotions, allowing the few that they were to settle somewhere in his stomach. This allowed the daytime to be almost emotionless, or at least more controlled. This, of course, meant at night that the daytime emotions suddenly surfaced. The supressed feelings rearing their head amplified.
John wondered what made Sherlock reassess his mind palace so heavily. Had John truly said anything revolutionary? He didn’t understand Sherlock’s sudden, stark reaction to the news he was not a homophobe. Moreover, he didn’t think Harry being a lesbian was such big news, but then again John had grown up with her lesbianism. Perhaps the idea of being a lesbian really was so foreign and unusual? At John’s old school, there had been plenty of open lesbians, although John was sure the only reason they had been accepted because teenage boys have a strange fixation with the thought of their female classmates fucking each other. At an all-boys school, there were no lesbians (obviously, John) and no open gay couples, although that could have been due to school policy. Had Sherlock never experienced real life gay couples? The thought amused John as he lay down to go to sleep. The fact they had kissed less than 5 hours before and now Sherlock was acting as if homosexuality was a complete alien thing. Somehow, this wasn’t a gay thing. John wouldn’t be able to explain why, but he and Sherlock kissing wasn’t gay.
"He does that a lot. He just goes off without saying anything. Last time the police got involved. The school thought he was missing when really he was in the woods thinking." Mike mocked, putting the 'thinking' in air quotes.
“I don’t think you do. This is Sherlock Holmes, John, you need to be careful.” Again, John laughed, unlocking the door to the dorm as he did.
The entrance opened immediately into the kitchen and living room. It was open plan, it seemed, with large windows either side that let in the summers light. On his left John could see a few sofas, along with armchairs next to a fireplace. The were made of old leather and draped with a mismatch of blankets that added to the homely feel.  John could see himself reflected in the mirror above the fireplace and, upon seeing his reflection, brushed his hair out of his face in an effort to look for refined. It didn’t work and instead he was left with a Tin-Tin like quiff. On the shelves on the furthest wall of the living room were thick textbooks, as well as a radio. To his right was the kitchen, which had a silver double doored fridge, an aga and a sink, as well as cupboards lining the walls. There were random knick knacks, like a metal statue, stood on the centre of the kitchen table and a vase of flowers on the windowsill. Everything was oddly mismatched but in a way that was charming.
Mike and Greg didn’t ask many questions. They let John say as much as he felt comfortable repeating. They could connect the dots if they truly wished, but Mike wasn’t the most type and Greg was mature enough to know when to push it. Now, was not the time. John just told them that Sherlock just got up and left in the middle of the night after they had an argument about him leaving randomly (not strictly untrue, John told himself.) They didn’t ask why John was awake all night or why he needed to be in their room, Mike knew John would tell them with time. He noted when John said ‘Sherlock’s doing just what you said he’d do.’ in a tight and tired voice. Although it was very little, Mike could guess what John was implying. He shook his head at this, and told John that Sherlock had his moments, which made the boy sigh in return.
Upstairs, Sherlock Holmes was lying flat on his back, staring at the ceiling with his fingers steepled under his chin. John didn't know whether to say anything, so closed the door gently and padded cautiously across the room to read up on his chemistry book. The exam had reminded him of how little he remembered. Perhaps the others in his class had tutoring over the summer and were already ahead of him? This was a sobering thought. As he sat down, the bed groaned, which made Sherlock's eyes flick to John. Again, Sherlock said nothing, and John watched him sit up over his book.
"Goodbye Anderson." Sherlock said, signalling with his hand to close the door. Anderson nodded, sighing. As he stepped away Sherlock called him back. "Anderson. You might want to tie your robe tighter. Just a suggestion" Anderson followed Sherlock's eye train to his hips and the gap in the robe before wrapping it round himself tighter and slamming the door.
Sherlock was fairly certain he had been in the room for many hours, although a lack of data was hampering that deduction. The position in which he was chained was initially only uncomfortable but was now causing his shoulders and knees to throb and his muscles to seize, with any movement sending shooting pain through his limbs. He had spent most of his time in captivity in his mind palace, but the pain was starting to make it challenging for him to retreat there fully. Without the stimulation of new information or the meditative focus of his mind palace, Sherlock began to wish for something more chemical to help him quiet the flutterings of panic that were seeping into his mind.
“I’m going to, Sherlock. We have to. We have to talk about this.” John could already tell this conversation was not going to end with more snogging.
Sherlock lowered his voice in both volume and register. “Not half so ridiculous as someone whose emotions actually managed to give him a limp arguing that I should open myself up to those emotions.”
John threw his hands in the air in exasperation. “So I’m either an idiot or an arsehole for not wanting to see you killed? Those are the two options?”
It was obvious that displaying the tools of his torture was part of the process itself, and Sherlock watched as Ex-Military pulled item after item out of the bag. Most of their uses were self-explanatory, although a few curious pieces were not immediately apparent in their application. He desperately tried to analyse his situation for any deductions that could allow him to escape, any information that could be of use, but there was nothing. Even if Sherlock managed to break free of his bindings, or if he was released as part of Ex-Military’s torture plan, he would still be in a locked room with one exit and two extremely dangerous individuals. There may be others under Moriarty’s control who awaited Sherlock outside the door in case of an escape attempt. There are so many unknowns and he had virtually nothing at his disposal.
