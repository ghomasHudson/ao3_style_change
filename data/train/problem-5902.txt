Tony wakes up to the strange feeling of sleeping without any covers. He’s also very warm, and there’s a very comfortable pillow right next to him. He opens his eyes and realizes he’s being aggressively cuddled by Steve, with their legs tangled together, Steve’s arms pulling him close to his body, and Tony’s arms hugging Steve’s back. Worse: he’s aggressively cuddling Steve and wishes he doesn’t have to move and get out of bed at all. There’s a strange feeling flooding Tony right now, and he can’t think about anything but this feeling of
“Really?” she asks, feigning surprise even though she’s one of the first camped out at the beginning to catch actors. “Surely pictures couldn’t have kept you that long.”
Spiderson: I have my reasons. Mainly I haven’t had a homemade meal in years. I need a dad who knows how to cook, preferable without almost burning the house down.
“Thanks, Dad.” his voice cracked, throwing his arms over Tony. Tony fell back, his foot caught the end of his back and they fell over in a tearful, laughing heap of loose limbs.
He was more than fine. He was great or he would have been if Peter had texted him. It was two in the morning and he had not received any text, not so much as a drunken phone call to tell him he would be home late or that he was staying over at Ned's. Nothing. Not a word. He had sent him a text message hours ago, telling him there was leftover Chinese in the fridge. Then an hour later he asked if his phone had died, then another saying that if it had he would not even be reading this, he doesn't even know why he asked that.
Rolling over onto his stomach, Peter looked at the physics book in front of him. The words had started to blur together into one, inconceivable formula. His stomach rolled, and the formula took a new shape, this time in the shape of a steak. Peter felt his mouth water. He looked down at the time. It was 7:30 pm. He had not eaten all day. No matter how many reminders he had on his phone, or made Friday tell him to take a break he still missed a meal.
, his phone in the other. The camera flashed and Peter brought the phone closer to his face and started searching for photos. He clicked on the photo album named: Irondad and Spiderson. It was dedicated to photos of Peter and Tony, from the moment he knew how to hold a phone and take photos, Peter had started documenting his life in photos, videos and audio clips. There was a photo of Tony and him at a beach, the setting sun framing their sun-kissed skin in a radiant glow. Their arms were around the other's shoulder, the faces creased with uncontained laughter and wide smiles, their hair wet with saltwater and sweat, sticking to their foreheads. Next to it, there was one of Peter holding a water balloon above an unsuspecting Tony, fast asleep in a lounge chair decked out next to a pool. The photos that followed was a slow-motion play of the balloon bursting open over him, and Tony chasing him, losing a flip-flop in the process. The last photo was of Tony throwing Peter in the pool. Then another of Tony in the kitchen wearing oven mitts that were caught on fire, after his first (and final) attempt at making a family meal. Peter thumbed to his favourite. Aged ten, stary-eyed and missing a tooth, blowing out a candle on a blue frosted cake, with white, cursive writing on top that read: It's a boy! next to a signed adoption certificate.
It was a nice routine, filled with the occasional hard case that would take days; giving their little part-timer Peter errands that were more around “spy and photograph some shit out of these people”; with Dum-E, U, and Butterfingers making disasters at the workshop; him not any time closer to finishing the algorithm for his ultimate AI; and all in all trying to remember how to maintain a normal eating and sleeping schedule.
Tuesday morning came with trying to understand the gibberish that studying computer science comes with. Steve give up after the hour. He is stubborn, but can recognize when something is light years above what he can do.
“This is the first time I encounter something like this, but I have been studying the probability of opening gaps throughout multiple universes and also the implications of this allowing us to travel through time itself so…” his voice got increasingly quick and excited with every word until Reed collected himself and continued in a slightly more contained way, “it will be an honor to study and resolve your problem. In the meantime let’s not reveal too much about the future, there are many variables at play and the least we want is to accidentally erase ourselves from existence”
“I didn’t have… sex, that night.” The guy is a saint, and Rhodey really felt pity for him, being in Toni’s body couldn’t be easy. Hell, James winced at that admission, already knowing what surprise Steve waked up to, “And unless her partner punched her in the face I don’t think a fight is the answer.”
Classes came and went. The man turned woman still feeling uncomfortable with the female underwear and the looks he was getting from almost everyone. Normally Steve wasn’t too self-conscious, you get used to it when you have been as skinny and short like him for most of your life, but the glances people here give Toni were something else. It was like dreading the moment someone would stop him to try and bully him, only for that person to keep quiet and ignore him. Nobody —other than James— addressed her, and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little bit lonely.
The redhead closed the glass door softly with a click, choosing to stay standstill. She is the very image of authority with crossed arms, dark blue pencil dress, and killer high heels. Maybe once he entertained the idea of mating with her, but their short relationship showed them that they were better off as friends.
The last name is familiar, but he doesn’t recall any company by that name. She is an heiress and a genius, which again stretched out the need of this particular conversation.
James described Reed Richards as Toni’s lab partner —not by choice—, which Toni hated pretty much on the principle that she could do all the work on her own. Steve understood now that basically students are divided into a group of five and given a certain amount of money for the development of their projects. The fact that Toni got to be on a two-man team was a concealed act of favoritism, and he wasn’t sure if it make him angry or disappointed.
Eventually, Rhodey left for the Air Force, Stark Industries changed its name to Stane Industries, Pepper graduated business school, and Tony tried and failed to get a job at any law firm—something about his reputation mixed with him being an omega, good old discrimination.
“Well? How did it go?” James asked as quietly and private as possible when the class ended and Steve walked out of the classroom on automatic mode.
Srry for the really late update. This last months haven't been easy, because of covid, college, and other stuff. But I really wanted to bring back this story, so here is my little something for those Stony fans that have been feeling down and have come to search for some OTP drama.
“Tony, you’re not listening. There are lawyers, as in plural, suing him will only give me more problems than what is worth it, everybody knows it. Also, there is no way people are going to believe that an alpha is being sexually harassed by a beta, society is that short-minded.”
It didn’t come up in court—which they won, not surprisingly—, but he made sure to leave a path of crumbs. Something too obvious to be left alone. Or so he thought until A.I.M. got on its feet again and arrested them for manipulation and robbery of some company’s blueprints (“Come on! Why would we want to rob tech a decade behind Hammer's?!”). And sure, he did hack into their systems and manipulate some of the information (“It was too easy and I was bored Pep!”) while also getting access to their security cameras for getting the evidence they needed. However, Pepper wasn’t involved in her lawyer’s less than righteous ways, so she was released without any repercussions.
The media always exaggerated his playboy persona, but he still enjoys a good party and gets laid from time to time. And if working in Potts Co. taught him something, it was that he wasn’t made to be a CEO from the start. Too much responsibility. He barely gets out of bed in time as it is, and tends to forget that there is a certain number of pro bono cases that he needs to fill up every three months. He doesn’t like them, they are just a publicity stunt.
"Don't mention it, kid, and here, before you turn blue." Peter had not realised he had been shaking. Bucky shrugged off his leather jacket, resting it over his shoulders. It smelled of smoke and sandalwood and something sweet, like sugared pastry. "Your dad will kill me if I return you to him looking like a smurf."
"I called you multiple times. I called MJ and Gwen and their phones were off. I did not know where you were, who you were with or what you were doing."
Spiderson: But seriously I think he’d love to have someone else to talk to about ~ science stuff ~ with.
After hearing about the death of his parents, his Uncle Ben and Auntie May's declining health, Tony fostered Peter. It had been a temporary fix.  A pit-stop, before he became another face, another statistic in the foster system. Tony had surprised him, had surprised them both when one the day the social worker was to take Peter away, Tony had asked if he could stay.
"One rule. We have one rule when you go out and that is to text me to tell me when you're going to be back. That's it."
Peter carefully lifted the lid off of the box, fabric spilled out from its side with flecks of emerald, shimmering in and out of view, like loose leaves caught in the low, shallow wave of a sunset stained river. An enveloped, shut with a emerald wax seal with a reared serpent's head look back at him. Peter slid his nail underneath the wax, breaking it free and unfolded the letter inside. it smelled of musty, like secret and infrequently used corridors and a jasmine, cornered in shade. It read:
Steve is the only one that doesn’t live at the Tower, to Tony’s chagrin. Even Natasha was finally persuaded, more by Clint than anything, but she did still say yes. He visits frequently, sometimes for Avengers business, sometimes for training, sometimes for the gym, sometimes for fun, sometimes for teal meals and bonding, and sometimes for movie night, but he never stays. Tony doesn’t know what to think of that. He tries persistently, to get Steve to move in with the rest of them, but Steve digs in his heels and constantly refuses in his polite, aw shucks manner that somehow completely softens the blow. Tony doesn’t know how Steve does it. He’s also managed to completely win over Pepper, and Tony’s fairly sure the two of them meet occasionally to talk about whatever they talk about. Tony still has not completely ruled out that they’re not meeting to either a) rule the world b) conspire against Tony into getting him
So when the question comes now, in form of an audience member with a gleam in her eyes, Steve doesn’t blush. Or give away anything. Steve has had an answer prepared for a long time, and he isn’t about to ruin it by stammering.
“Lost, Rogers? You’re wandering like a confused puppy,” Tony greets him with an exaggerated wink that everyone around them eats up with clamors of questions and declarations of love. The camera flashes increase even more in number, Steve vaguely realizes as he finds himself blinking a little too often at the light.
"Well, the only two people left I can't really see are you and me, and it can't be you, and it can't be—”
”I’m serious. What is your dark side, Cap?” Tony asks, because he’s a bastard who can’t let go and because Steve can’t hate him any further than this. Also, since when he known to let things go?
, Peter repeated back to himself, feeling his chest swell around the word, encapsulating it. "It's a good thing you take after your old man when it comes to fashion," Tony quipped, "speaking of, I have something for you," Tony revealed a small, velvet black box from behind his back
TheBeast: So this is not an app for other scientists, or like-minded, academically-claimed individuals.
Something was off. He knew that look in Tony's eye, it was the same look he had when he first started school, a look that was chasing after a future that was too far beyond both of their hands to control. The truth hitched in the back of his throat, he wanted to tell him everything but he remained silent, telling himself he had to meet the men in the photos first before he introduced them to Tony.
It had been a week since Peter had made a Grindr account for his dad. Steve stayed in touch with him throughout, sending him photos of what he had made, along with the recipe for Peter to try, including the recipe for homemade lasagne (the way his mum had taught him). So had Stephen. A doctor or not, Peter was not about to lose an invite to Disneyland. He always wanted to go to Treasure Island and Stephen was his one-way ticket to make that fantasy into a reality. Tony had taken Peter to Disneyland when he was younger and had promised him they'd go back when he was older. This was his - and Tony's - chance!
Later that night, Peter sat next to Tony on his bed. The projector displayed the starting credits of Star Wars onto the wall opposite. Every Friday they had a movie night. Tony would clear his schedule, cancel all of his meetings and interviews and leave his phone on silent. It had started on Peter's first stay at the tower. He had been restless, not wanting to sleep in fear of what the night would bring. He walked the walls, in a strange limbo between awake and asleep and had leaned against a door, trying to recall where he had come from when the door opened behind him. Tony stood over him and without another word, he moved to one side to let Peter in. Tony had stood there awkwardly, unsure of what to do next when Peter heard the soundtrack to Indiana Jones. After that, Tony's room became an extension of his own. He had an open-door policy, no matter what time of night, Peter was allowed inside. After finding Peter asleep at his door, his hand clenched in a fist with a blanket wrapped around him, Tony added: you don't have to knock to the invitation.
Peter turned to the other voice behind him. A man stood, towering over him, the dreary lampshade crowning an unmistakable halo over the stranger's head.
Loki Laufeyson, Age Irrelevant - what now? How was it “irrelevant.” Peter looked at his profile picture. Oh, that's how. Loki looked timeless; a walking work of art that had fallen - no, not fallen, gracefully leaned out of - a painting. Without thinking Peter swiped right.
Lowkeyabitch: You’re asking me how I knew how you, son of Tony Stark, lived in a tower that has STARK on the top of it?
"Yeah, he's hard to shake off, and I'm even harder to get rid of so," he leaned backwards, bracing his hands against the wooden slate for a table, bringing a cigarette to the corner of his mouth where it laid, with his other hand he held a lighter to the end and lit it, a wisp of smoke tracing the air and disappearing beneath the low hanging canopy of fairy lights across the small, outdoor section. "God, if you're as much of a fighter as he was - still is - then best of luck to the man that breaks your father's heart."
Tony stepped inside, his hands behind his back and shut the door behind him with his back. "Woah, is this what was in the box?"
Once, after Peter mentioned he had written a paper about the X-gene (the mutant gene), Bruce had asked if he could read it.
“Lasagne is a lot harder than it looks. There are so many layers!" Peter cried, setting the fire extinguisher down.
When Peter had asked him why he had rules that were different to his other foster home, why he could walk in without knocking, Tony had said, "there is a difference between hurt and trauma. Hurt does not stay. With trauma, you're left with the pain, you're left with the hurt to cope with alone. That's why you don't have to knock because I don't want you to hesitate at my door. I don't want you to be alone in your hurt."
"Don't worry," he slurred, and immediately Peter began to worry. "I'll introduce myself first, that way when you go tell all of your friends which bed you'll be in tonight they won't warn you about going home with strangers." he winked - or tried to, and ended up with blinking both eyes slowly - "my name is-"
When Peter's face returned back to normal, he added that he had been accepted into several schools across the state because of this paper.
Now, that promise was about to be broken; forever was coming to a close, with Peter's final exams around the corner and university around the next, Peter had to find someone for Tony. The thought of him alone in the tower made Peter wake in a cold sweat. The part of him that still believe in forever, in wishes and blue frosted cakes could not leave without knowing Tony had someone who'd promise him forever and mean it.
“Pens down," the examinator announced. They had a stern face, with a thin, wrinkled neck tucked inside of a buttoned-up polo shirt that reminded Peter of a turkey's.
“Kid," he breathed, his usual, grim thin line where his mouth would be broke into a slanted smile, "you remind me of a friend of mine, always thinking with his heart, not with his head that one. He used to get himself into all kinds of trouble, still does. When we were younger I always used to find him in some back alleyway somewhere, squaring up to someone twice the size of him because he said an offensive slur in front of him or something along those lines."
“You look like someone kicked a patriotic puppy,” Tony says, internally wincing at what he just said.
“Tony,” Steve says as soon as he steps foot into the kitchen. His voice is lighter than Tony has ever heard it. “There’s coffee running.”
“Should I feel honoured?” he asks, putting two and two together. He slides the drink over expertly, deft hands having put it together seconds before.
Everheart nods, as if everyone before him had said the same thing. Also fair, considering Jen played into her character frighteningly well. But Everheart’s eyes turn shrewd, and she asks, “And what about your final castmate?”
Steve sighs. He knows the look that the person is talking about. He takes the tweet from Tony’s hands and the tweet on the table, crumples them, and throws them back in the bucket. “No,” he says after. “Do you remember when I was on the Nomad movie, there was the beginning when I hadn’t gone full brown yet? It was like, my normal blond on the top floofy bit, like the bangs, and then the roots looked brown in the light? And then the beard was brown and everyone questioned if I wasn’t a natural blond or something?”
Steve has been dreading this question since the day he read the script. And since the day that Tony joined Centre of the World, he has been dreading the question even more, because they’re no easy way to play any of it off or answer in a way that won’t have people put their tin hats up. Which means that he has spent nearly a year coming up with the perfect response, trying to get ahead of the shock factor that someone is undoubtedly looking for.
“Ovviamente,” Tony says with a wink. “You think the name Antonio came from Russia? Even if it is Anthony, it’s still Italian.”
Tony walks away before Natasha says anything, because he sees one of Pepper's 'must schmooze' guests and they're free for the first time of all of tonight. He's been threatened to go through the list of 'must schmooze' guests on pain of 24 hour days and her alerting both Bruce and Steve. And considering that he doesn't want 24 days or that he doesn't want to see Steve often, he's going to go through it.
Tony is starting to think that this is maybe why Steve accepted so quickly, had it not been for his eye catching someone coming up the stairs. There he goes.
"I'm going to go find his shield," Tony mumbles, needing an excuse to get out of there. He just couldn’t see Steve right now, couldn’t think about Steve right now, couldn’t do anything but shut out everything he had learned in the past eight hours. Denial, right?
perfectly was a nightmare in itself because both Peggy and I are perfectionists. To shoot it four, five different times would have been living hell, but that’s kind of what I was talking about. It does feel like they’re all five different takes, and honestly, when I watched part of the movie before the premiere, I thought that maybe they used a different take that maybe I had forgotten about because of how tired I was. But it really was just one, and as people see more of the story, suddenly the speech makes more sense, I think. And then you learn more and you realize that you’re wrong and—it was just incredible shooting it.” He can feel himself smiling like an idiot near the end, but his smile refuses to cooperate with him and control itself.
Tony laughs. “I hope you’re proud of us, Mrs. Rogers, your boy just bagged an Oscar Best Leading Actor Nomination and I a Best Supporting Actor.”
“At the most recent base, I found a few reports about the Winter Soldier’s missions from 1990-1995 and,
"Ooh. Now we're talking, Rogers. Okay, hmm, do you know if this guy has any kind of an interest in you?"
“Depends,” Tony responds, downing a third in one shot. “I was looking for a friend, but maybe trouble’s what I want.”
The interviewer pretends to fawn over that. “Aww,” she cooes, “That’s too cute. It’s easy to forget you play a murderer in the move, Steve, especially since the role is like none other in your filmography.”
A tinkling laugh sounded off to Peter's right, followed by a grunt, and a few other, less distinct noises, and his name. Peter turned to see his friends, arms linked, walking in a line towards him, "Peter! We thought we lost you!" they broke apart, coming over to stand around him.
"Hey, kid," Bucky's hand was hovering over Peter's chest, "you forgot to breathe," he said, pressing his hand up and down, Peter followed the movement with his breath.
Peter wanted to find someone who'd do the same for Tony, someone who had an open-door policy, someone who he did not have to knock for, someone ho he didn't hesitate to ask for help from. Someone who'd leave the movie running in the background, in the hope that I'd be too loud to hear over his nightmares.
The morning’s events played heavily on repeat in his mind, now with a backing track of Bill Nye the science guy theme song. He tried to shake the thoughts loose and focus on the physics exam in front of him. His hand ached. Numbers and letters had no meaning. He had forgotten what the sun felt like. What colour was the sky again?
Tony let out a short, breathless laugh, "that won't happen," he said. "Go on then, don't let me make you late. I'll leave some money on the side for you, it's for emergencies only."
"This doesn't look like another lego set, but I could be wrong," Tony held it close to his ear and shaked it. He murmured, "no, defiantly not," drawing his lower lip down in thought.
yes, you read that right, outfits, Tony was one to do a dramatic wardrobe change in the middle of his events, or at the slightest inconvenience - and donate the money to a charity chosen for that month, or, if he had a long line of workwear, he'd donate them to the local homeless shelter for them to use for job interviews. Peter closed the wardrobe doors. If he looked at it for another second the room would start to feel smaller, the walls closing in and it'd become a choice of not which clothes to wear, but which Peter he wanted to be.
Peter's chest fell, fast and hollow. Resting a hand over his chest, he tried to steady his breathing and was reminded of the videos Bruce had sent him of breathing exercises he could do for "exam stress."
It had been two and a half hours, 30 minutes and 29 seconds since Loki had last sent his text. Not that Peter was counting or anything. He was about to admit defeat and raid Tony's wardrobe, when a notification flashed on his phone's screen. It was from Loki. Peter bit down on the inside of his cheek, uncertainty rising in his chest. He did not know Loki. He had to remind himself this about allof the men he was talking to several times, at several different points during the day. He should be telling him about Tony, not treating him as his personal stylist. Then again... Tony did not save half of his wardrobe. After an event he would auction the outfits he wore for the evening -
Half-way into the night, Peter went outside into the smoking area and sat on one of the wooden slates for tables in the middle of the street, sectioned off by rope.
"Are you still friends with him now?" thinking about his own friends, how they've always stood by his side and would defend him against the whole school, and had done, during his transition. Friends like that were hard to come by.
Later that night Tony knocks on Peter’s door. Tony faintly hears Peter curse, the sound of something falling and the shuffling of feet, drawing nearer. Peter opens the door. He looks nervous. Guilty.
His phone screen flashed on, alerting him to a text. "Finally," he murmured, looking down at his phone. It was not the usual photo of them stood together, arms around each other, clumsily straining to do the rabbit ears behind the other without either noticing. It was a photo of Rhodey and him when they were younger. They leaned against each other, stood at a bar with bottles of empty beer lined behind them.
James Rhodes, 37, an officer for the United States Air Force stood leaning against the side of a fighter plane, fully geared, with his helmet propped against the side of his hip.  He had a kind face. The kind of face you could trust. Tony needed someone like that.
Peter receives a mysterious package, a handsome stranger saves the day and Tony reconnects with an old friend.
He had created an account for Tony, but the more he talked to them, the less he wanted to share them. Talking to Steve reminded him of his Aunt May and how she'd always cook homemade meals for him after school, talking to Stephen made him realise how little of the world he had seen, it inspired him to look at Universities abroad. Loki was teaching him how to be unapologetic, to take up space and be loud, a side to him he had not realised he had, it had flattened down to a doormat for people to dirty their shoes on and walk over. He found comfort in talking to Bruce, he did not have to be worried about talking too much, Bruce always wanted to hear what he had to say and he cared for him, sending him herbal tea recipes for his anxiety and stress, meditation and yoga poses to release tension, built into his neck, shoulders and jaw he did not release he had been holding.
Spiderson: That there would be other offers, but they won't always be good friends like the ones I have.
"Oh, didn't I say? I've decided to work for Osborn, that's my new uniform. I start Monday," Tony's arm fell slack and Peter a web flew out of Peter's wrist, with a flick Peter caught it, dancing away from arms-reach.
Before Peter could ridicule him for his use of emoji, another notification came through. This time it was from Stephen.
Tony rubbed his hands over his face. His red, blood-shot staring through the gaps between his fingers. Guilt turned in Peter's stomach and he opened his mouth, closing it again when he ran his hands down, over the veil, bulging in his forehead and his hair. "Right. Then you're grounded."
“Differential Equations I, it is just math. Not even that complicated, I passed this class and probably Toni thinks this is a joke and doesn’t shows up to it at all. Just try to get decent grades, bad ones will make people outright suspicious.”
Instantly Steve flushed a bright red, he tried to cross his arms only to be reminded of Toni’s boobs and finally abort the movement in favor of positioning his hands on her hips.
At least now he doesn’t have to solve any case that comes their way. They had gotten big enough that now they have both regular clients and a decent number of lawyers in the firm capable of working alongside them.
“I… It was like listening to another language and not knowing what is going on.” And that is frustrating, his mind is one of the only things he can rely on when his body couldn’t keep up with difficult situations, not having even that makes him feel powerless… more than usual. Steve hates that feeling.
Actually, he wasn’t guilty of anything, but after trying so many times to get an alpha heir, the omega they got instead stung on Howard’s pride.
Tony had to serve a week of prison for hacking and breaching their “privacy”, until the next court, where he went all out presenting the whole creepy facts. Then the feds took it up from there and he and Pepper got out of the whole problem.
And that was another thing, Howard wasn’t entirely faithful to his wife. But being ever the charmer, it somehow morphed from Howard to Maria being the cheater, and so giving her husband reasons for searching a warm body at night. The older Stark didn’t say anything, but many theorized it was because Maria cheated with the family butler, and just didn’t want to dig into that shame.
“What is this class about?” he asked while following Toni’s friend through the hallways, feeling uncomfortable and self-conscious of the panties that he was wearing and the very female parts on his chest moving and rubbing at each step against the cloth. There were some people walking around on their own worlds while wearing some variation of the same style in clothing, but the fact that these pants were just too tight didn’t help him at all. Sarah raised him to be a gentleman, and even if he has a valid reason for wearing them it doesn’t make him less than a pervert.
He strayed for a bit on his way back to the apartment, having to make it alone after James said he will catch up with the person who —hopefully— will tutor Steve.
Steve didn’t pay too much attention to it when he first got here, but it is a city in its own right. James gave him a short tour through campus on their way to the dorm complex, explaining that he studied here on an scholarship and had to join the airforce after graduating —he didn’t go to much into detail and Steve respected that. Still, even if now he can somehow orientate himself, Steve would not be surprised if he ended up getting lost anyway.
“1939” Steve said. They didn’t talk about it, and saying it out loud made him feel nervous and a little panicky of knowing exactly how much time has passed.
Finally, Tony is famous where it matters. He is no longer portrayed in gossip magazines and can mostly choose what cases he wants to take on or not.
Steve is no more than a stranger on this place, on her space, and by now he probably has already obliterated her privacy.
Parker called in a favor for a friend. Apparently Lizy’s boyfriend robbed a local store—or those were the charges—, but Peter was sure the guy was just an idiot, the kind that would panic and run when confronted with a policeman. No wonder he was arrested, running only made him seem all the more suspicious.
He smiled, an idea taking shape before his eyes, “But we could use the money and the attention of the media to put up a law firm, with us as CEO, and offer some of your coworkers jobs. Hell, we could help them get compensation too if they want it!”
It just occurred to her in the sixth day, while waking up to a very normal and not at all missed pain at her navel, that maybe being a man had its advantages. She didn’t miss having her period at all...
She slowly approached the desk, lifting up a folder and skimming through the pages, “And you are still going there to defend people of thief, teenage drug dealing, and for dressing up as superheroes while robbing crime scenes?”, her eyebrows reached her hairline.
Said Stark looked momentarily perplexed—not expecting to be interrogated in the middle of the hallway, if not at all—, but then he just smiled as always while saying, “You sent me there, as our social responsibility to the community and yada yada, blueberry?”
“Dude, it is differential equations one, one” he stressed out the last word, and Steve could just assume that was because there are more levels to it, “What did you used to do before this?”
Sorry for the waiting, it had taken me some time to decide when to swap them. I mean, I could have gone on abour telling their gender issues during that week but It was already time for the plot to move on. Please comment and leave some kudos! :)
James let out a sigh, closing his eyes for a second so he could rub at his temples. He looked stressed out and Steve feel bad for it, even if at the end James is doing all of this for Toni’s wellbeing and not for Steve’s, “We have no idea of how this happened, as for the year…”
Of course it was. Wasn't it? He wanted Tony to be happy. His heart ached at the thought of Tony, isolating himself in his lab with no one but Friday to talk to. He had heard stories of what he was like before, Pepper had told him how having him in Tony's life made such a difference, how him being there made the tower feel like a home, instead of a museum of Tony's lost childhood. What if, by trying to shrink Peter's own guilt for leaving, he only made it worse? What if Bucky was right, and they only broke his heart? What if he only made it worse?
"That does not include ordering a dozen churros at midnight because, and I quote, "MJ tripled dog dared you to eat them all at once."
Spiderson: No. It's about my dad. His life is a rollercoaster with more downs than ups sometimes and I need to know if you can handle it.
Bucky Barnes, 41 -  wait a minute. Peter took a closer look at his profile picture. Wasn’t this the same man in Steve’s?
Stephen Strange, 36, a martial arts teacher who stood with his back to the camera. A silk red gown was draped across his elbow. The head of a red-scaled dragon, with thin wisps of smoke protruding from its mouth, slithered across his beck and came to rest the crook of his neck.
“In that case then tell dad I’m making him dinner…” he said, scrolling back through Steve's messages, an idea slowly taking shape, “I’m thinking lasagne.”
A teadrop landed on the letter, smearing the ink. Peter released a strained, startled sob that broke out into a string of nervous laughter, crossed with relief that he was not alone in his thoughts, someone understood, not only that, someone had wrote it down, there in black and white for him to re-read over and over again and had lived through it. The paratizie had theorised of his transition, when photos resurfaced of Tony holding the hands of a ten year old girl and years later announced he had an adopted son, but nothing was for certain. Tony never made a statement to confirm or deny it the rumour and when, at the start he was questioned about the "little girl" he had fostered, Tony would correct them, and keep correcting them, through gritted teeth.
“So, let me get this straight," Bucky started, "you made a Grindr account for your dad because you’re going to university, and don’t want him to be alone?”
“Peter, there’s a package for you at the desk,” Friday announced. Before Peter could wonder what it could be, a Grindr notification on his phone flashed on his screen.
"Clear your schedules, he, she and theys, this calls for a celebration!" MJ cheered, waving their linked arms in the air.
Peter re-read the message. A date. He had a date - well, technically Tony had a date, but they were a package deal. They had a date! Lowering the fire extinguisher down, Peter was about to type back when he caught the foot of a shadow sliding into the room.
Peter fell into line with MJ, Gwen and Ned into an old, abaddoned warehouse sandwiched in between blocks of slanted, concrete buildings, interrupted by the odd, narrow alleyway. They headed towards the bar, with MJ in the lead, making a serious of faces at the bartender craned his neck to watch her, then nodded and lined four shot glasses on the counter, filling each one with an inky black liquor that smelt of burnt sugar. They clinked their glasses together, raising them in the air MJ screamed "to our future!" and all four of took a drink, leaving a sticky, sweet aftertatse in the back of their throats. Slamming her empty shot glass down, she demanded "another!" before leading the party onto the next round and onto the dance floor where Gwen talked to DJ into playing MJ and her's playlist, that consisted mainly of Girl in Red and King Princess.

When a snake outgrows their skin, they shred it to make room for a new one. No one questions it. It is natural. Sometimes, when a person outgrows their skin, they go through a similiar change. Sometimes that change can come in the form of a new wardrobe, or dying their hair, or having their body inked or pierced, or becoming leaner, thinner, chunkier, more muscular. Sometimes that means they have to undergo surgery. Sometimes it has nothing to do with how they look, but how they define "home" and "family," and sometimes that means leaving everything they knew behind, and that can be the hardest change of all... until you've done it.
"I have Friday scan everything; every letter, every gift card, parcel, box," Tony sighed, and propped his elbows up on the armchair, resting his head in his hands. "Who are they?"
“No, you - here, just take it.” Tony said, throwing it at him. Peter caught it, fiddling with the golden latch at the front and popped it open. Inside was a silver Rolex.
. He built his home. He built his family and Peter wanted to build a life for him after he left for university, one that would room both him and someone else, someone special.
Peter rolled over to Tony's side, finding it empty. The alarm clock on the bedside table opposite had been taken out of the wall socket and thrown across the room. Stifling a laugh, caught between a yawn Peter rolled back over onto his back and absently scrolled through Grindr, their faces blurring together to form a fleshy blob when a familiar face caught his attention. Sitting up, Peter stared back at the face that he saw every day, hung up in their shared lab next to their coffee machine andcups, stacked on top of each other, each with its own scientific pun written on the side.
“Friday? Should I even bother asking if dad has eaten yet?” he knew if he hadn't eaten yet, he wouldn't eat at all. Like father like son.
Peter nodded his head frantically, "Yeah! My friend helped me pick it out, what do you think?" he asked, turning on the spot.
"I..." he paused, resting his elbows on the wooden slate and stared down at his feet. "I don't know what I thought," he admitted, "that maybe someone would see him the way I see him," his breath hitched, swallowing the forming lump in his throat, "he deserves to be happy,"
He smiled. Something about it, the way it strained, made Peter think that he did not smile often. "Not quite," he said, brushing a strand of hair from his face, bringing it behind his ear. His hair was half-up in a messy bun, framing his sharp, stubbled jawline.
Tony stands above the stone fire pit centred in the middle of the balcony. Usually, it’s sealed shut, beneath a black slate of marble that’s used as an island. Rising from the floor the fire pit is restored back to life with a flick of a match. Tony holds a box on his side, he turns a letter in his hand. There is no name. Only an address. He burns the corner of the letter, watches as the flames swallow it whole, and just like that: his secret is kept. The rest of the letters follow. He walks away, leaving the box to burn. He doesn’t notice the shadow watching him from the balcony window.
He looked down at the desk in front of him. Half of life gone, just like that, spent sat at the same desk, on the same chair, staring at the same chalkboard, the same broken clock. He stood, the back of his chair scraping across the floor and walked out of the classroom, out of the hallway, out of the building and into the waiting arms of his friends, he linked his elbows with them and followed them out of the school gate, not once did either of them look back.
Running a hand through his hair, Tony smoothed out the few strands of frazzled grey, "another time then?"
Dr Bruce Banner, 49, “a beast in the sheets a scientist in the sheets.” His profile picture was of him holding a PhD in physics, then another in radiophysics, biochemistry, nuclear physics and a medical degree. Peter's mind thought back to his physicals textbooks. His text was this Monday. If anyone could help him revise for him it was him.
Hello! I am looking for a partner for my middle-aged dad, so when I leave for university he doesn't 1) start a cult, 2) start a robot apocalypse or 3) something in between starting a cult and a robotic apocalypse.
The man rubbed his hands over his jeans nervously, "ah, my Ma would roll in her grave if she heard."
"Hey, are you free tonight?" Tony asked, waving invisible strands of web off of him, "I was thinking we should go out and celebrate that your finals are over."
“You don’t have to say anything,” he said, fastening the Rolex over his wrist, "though try not to lose it," he winked.
“My father gave it to me. His father gave it to him and so on," he said, turning the Rolex over on its face. On the back listed the male members of the family. Peter Benjamin P. Stark joined the list at the bottom, with space below for his future child to be. The P stood for Parker. Peter had asked Tony if he could keep it, as a tribute to his parents.
Tony needed a distraction from his racing thoughts, that all went back to Peter. He touched the screen, viewing the message.
Bucky turned to Peter, "not to sound pessimistic, kid but what are the chances of him finding his one true love straight away?"
There was Steve Rogers, 40, an ex-military soldier who lived in Brooklyn, NYC to become an artist. In his bio, there was a photo of him in a running group. One arm was around a man, his brown, messy hair tied into a bun. He was missing an arm. A brown labrador stood at his feet with a harness vest around him. Next to him, a young black man stood, biting down a laugh, as the two men were attempting to push the other out of the frame. Steve stood in between the two, his laughter lines softening in the sun, watching the two with a slow warmth, like an old friend, perhaps.
“That is true,” Tony simply says, keeping quiet for once. A moment of awkward silence passes, and Steve starts to snicker.
Tony takes off his cuff and holds up the line of zeroes to Steve. Steve’s eyes widen, and his breath catches as his face softens towards Tony. “Stuttgart Hall.”
"Fella done you wrong?" Natasha teases huskily as she slides over his drink. She glances over to Steve, who's chatting with Thor about something involving the little cube in his hand. Thor's, not Steve's.
He smiles, just to try and force his voice from straying into bitterness or a sardonic tone. He takes a moment to think about what he’ll say next. “Yeah, no. I’m a naturally crowd-anxious person, even though I’ve gotten better at that, and the day of the Oscars was just... I think the final straw was not being able to see her like I always thought I would. Okay, now I’m going to get weepy, next question, let’s do this.”
“Well,” Steve says, looking down at the ground. “She’s not wrong.” He suddenly remembers making a bet with his ma about him crying if he ever won an Oscar. His ma had bet yes, and he had bet no, thinking he’d never win one to prove her theory. Steve suddenly finds himself crying. “Goddamnit.”
Tony calls Pepper, knowing that the footage of his conversation would be deleted in the very future.
“You okay?” Tony asks, concern tinging his voice. Steve removes his hands from his face and opens his eyes, turning to look at Tony. “I know that you didn’t want to—”
Tony starts to ask him what made him stop, because all that he can see in that direction is a clock and this isn't Cinderella, but Steve beats him to the point once again.
“Is Tony Stark bisexual?” Steve asks, pulling off the next sticker before Tony has a crisis at this press junket. “Wait, no, he is pansexual because he likes atttactive people all the same and is completely non-discriminatory. Also because he has more options to sleep around and charm.” He winks at Tony after he says that.
"Yes," Steve says unashamedly. "And don't you dare even ask, because I'm not doing it." Damn, and just when Steve had been entertaining him and his stupid question this night. Tony wanted to press his luck elsewhere.
“You have to stop me if I’m wrong,” Steve whispers quietly, looking at Tony as cautiously as he can.
Steve doesn’t take it. Instead, he just looks sad as he looks away. “I woke up from the ice with this.”
Though, with the way that Steve is looking like he stepped out of a photoshoot perfectly attractive right now, in that indigo two-piece suit, it isn't hard to see why people flock to him. Seriously, Tony needs to find out whoever does Steve's wardrobe, or even whoever helped him with that suit. It's a necessary task now. Very necessary.
Steve stops short, trying to stop himself from crying a new round of tears. He looks up and swallows hard, counting to five before he deems himself fit to speak again without tearing up. Voice wavering and all, he opens his mouth to speak and prays that somewhere, he has the strength to finish talking.
Here’s the thing: the Oscar nominations come out the very same day that marks the four-year anniversary of his mother’s death. The exact minute that they actually come out, he’s in front of his mother’s grave, crying at her headstone and resolutely ignoring all the paparazzi that are trying to discretely snap photos of him. There have to be more of them usual this year, because of the Oscar nominations happening today. The paparazzi go wild for anyone who even starred in a recent movie during nomination day. Usually, there’s always handful or so who take pictures of him at the graveyard every year because they’ve realized that today is his mother’s death day. Steve can’t do anything about it that wouldn’t bring attention to himself, so he has taken to ignoring them. It’s easy, he finds, because it’s hard to see anything though his own tears.
"Ooh. Now we're talking, Rogers. Okay, hmm, do you know if this guy has any kind of an interest in you?"
He smiles, but his eye catches on a comment asking him why. Steve has to think of ASPCA commercials to stop himself from outright laughing at either their attempt to make him feel better, or their genuine bafflement.
each other. It's a proven fact. Rogers is friendly to everyone but Tony, and Tony pretty much gets along and likes everyone but Rogers. Everyone knows this. Everyone also is waiting for them to get over it and make nice.
"Who do you take me for?" Tony asks, offended at the insinuation. "A, no matter how much I don't like him that's a dick move, especially considering how I found out. B, I'm not about to ruin the dreams of millions of women around the world."
“Oh!” Tony says, “And the only reason people stopped talking about it was because Natasha posted that picture of you in that speedo. I think the only reason I remember that is because people started to ask why your chest had no hair whatsoever.”
"No, he stands out plenty," Steve grins. "I don't think a lot of people have been able to take their eyes off of him."
"I didn't think you were the type to play chicken, Rogers. If I win, I feel like you should go find this guy.”
Rating: Most of it is T for language, but please avoid the thirst tweets interview if you’re uncomfortable with sexual overtures and suggestion. And the actual movie scene itself.
"The particular shade of his clothes is a little off from anyone else, but many would say it's a fairly common color," Steve says with a complete straight-face, and then Tony remembers two things. A, Steve has really good serum-enhanced eyes, and B, Steve is also an artist, so he knows what to do with all that sensory information.
Tony boos at Steve when the doors open and Steve unceremoniously brings Tony to his bedroom and dumps him there. Not literally, but close enough.
The next morning, Pepper hugs him for a solid few minutes after he tells JARVIS to call off the search. They get drunk again, equally smashed and crying. That is how Rhodey finds them a little while later when he drops in for a surprise visit. The day ends with the three of them drunker than they really should be, teetering the line of alcohol poisoning, and no one blames them, really.
“And to the one person who’s asked me why my agent hates me, thank you so much for trying. Appreciate it, but it’s a little too late for that,” Steve says, and a flurry of laughing emojis and surprised words flood the comments. Yeah, Steve knows that people had wanted him to talk about it, but were positive that he wouldn’t, since it was three months after the fact.
for once in your life?” Expressive brown eyes locked in on his, boring a hole right though Steve with how fierce they were. Fierce and angry, two qualities that never failed to make Tony about a hundred times hotter than he already was in Steve’s mind. Steve was going to melt into the floor, acting and scene be damned.
"Maria," Natasha responds without missing a beat. When Tony doesn't say anything in frozen shock, she says, "
In fact, with the way Steve looks incredibly confident in that stupid suit, he knows he's probably in the large majority that wants to fuck Steve. The fucker doesn't even have qualms about dancing anymore, even though he did before. As he dances, everyone can't help but notice how his moves are incredibly fluid and precise, just like how he fights. And no, Tony isn't projecting for once; if he looks around, all eyes are quite literally on Steve. Every single time Steve's talks to someone, there's almost always a new check donated. It's incredible, really.
“We finished that movie together,” Steve says weakly, opening his eyes to see Tony. He does look like he’s cried a little bit. “I want you to be here, just to be proud.”
“Very nice,” Peggy tells him as he sits back down. The Howlies nod their support, and all in all, the miss the next performance on stage because of their whispering to Tony. No one, thankfully, picks up on it, enraptured by whatever performance it is that is on stage right now.
Tony shrugs. There are worse press incidents and issues than the conservatives coming after Rogers. "Why not? And back then, anyway, you had Carter, right? So you're what, bisexual? Pansexual? Polysexual? Preferring not to put labels? You like women, so I mean, you'll only get yelled at half the—”
Kat looks like Christmas came early for her too, even more so than last time he was in her show and he had called her by her nickname for the first time. “Really?” she asks, quickly schooling her fave into one of true professionalism. “I’m flattered. But don’t think I’m going easy on you tonight, because this is the first time you guys have showed your faces since the premiere and everyone has questions.”
“Thought that the universe was trying to make up for everything I lost by giving me this. And then I lost my soulmate, and thought that maybe not.”
Tony merely smirks, so Steve smiles and then straightens himself back out, sitting properly on the couch. “Sorry, guys, I thought I was going to be the only one here right now. Apparently not. Which brings me to the next question, by toonieandsteeb, which I probably didn’t say right. Wait a second. That’s... that’s just me and Tony. Steeb. God. Steeb.”
“Raise your hand if you would let sexy lumberjack Steve Rogers raw you at any point of the day,” Tony reads, and then he flips the tweet over to show the second half of the tweet, a picture that has a room full of people with their hands raised. “Wait, is that the time when you decided to let your beard grow out? Or was it the time that you dyed everything brown, beard and hair?”
"Tony, someone blew you up. It's a very valid question," Steve petulantly said. Tony laughed again, not as broken and hollow as before.
“No, but, trying to kiss your best friend like you want to crawl into his pants while there are twenty people watching is unsettling. Especially when you’re being judged on if the scene is okay. Spoiler alert, if the scene needs to be better, we were told what to do better,” Steve says, wincing. He’s never forgetting someone yelling at him to all but dry-hump Tony. It may have only happened once, and the context may have been that they told him to dry-hump Tony like all the other scenes, but still. Awful.
“If the next one doesn’t ask how old Steve is, I’ll be thoroughly disappointed,” Tony says, crossing his fingers as he pulls off the sticker with his other hand. “Is Steve Rogers... Mr. Rogers?” He turns to Steve, raising his eyebrows in question.
“Congratulations,” Tony simply says, “To whoever it was and whenever it happened.” He doesn’t say anything else and doesn’t himself feel anything.
Something flickers in Tony’s eyes: guilt, concern, worry, panic, apology, regret. But he picks up the program pretty well and smirks at the camera. “Oops,” Tony says shrugging. “Hi. But I better not see any gifs of me fixing my hair online. That’s sacred space right there.”
Steve reaches over and pulls the last sticker himself. Tony squawks in protest. “Is Steve Rogers a Christian?” He tries hard not to laugh, but fails. The way it’s phrased makes him unable to control his laughter.
So he pulls up the camera placed in the kitchen to see if anyone’s there, and groans when he sees Steve. Tony really cannot go up against Steve right now, especially when he’s caffeine deprived. He never even has a chance against one of Steve’s smiles, or Steve’s ‘I’m concerned for your health and you should be too’ face, or Steve’s “Please?’ face or even those eyebrows of disappointment. He would at least like to put up some kind of a resistance.
But thanks to Steve, his work wife Pepper, his science husband Bruce,  his best friend Rhodey, and even Happy (because Steve pulled out all the stops, even after Tony tweaked JARVIS to stop Steve just for tonight) Tony was forced to go to sleep last night. And worst of all, tonight, Tony's kind of thankful he did. Even if Tony spent the first half an hour lying in bed wondering what kind of a relationship name Happy should have. Security bro? Hmm, he is going to have to ask Happy about that.
”I didn’t care about it, I didn’t care,” he says, slurring everywhere. Pepper’s running a hand through his hair. “Why does it hurt so much? I don’t care, and the stupid timer had to say zero and it hurts and I don’t want it to hurt. Why can’t it go back?”
Tony gapes, because he hadn't known that. At all. Huh, that explained why none of them had seen Rogers in over a week. “He d—”
But Tony isn’t listening to Steve anymore; he’s staring at Steve’s uncuffed wrist with a growing sense of horror and shock. 00-000-00-00-00. Steve’s found his soulmate. Steve has a soulmate, and now is not the time to think about how it isn’t him or anything.
OKAY SO MAYBE THIS IS ME SHAMELESSLY WRITING STEVE AND TONY AS THEIR REAL-LIFE ACTORS BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT I SHIP STONY NOT RDJ AND CHRIS. :)
Tony gasps dramatically. "Has Steve been holding out on science days with Bruce and I? And just because Bruce is my science boyfriend doesn't mean we're fucking. At least I think we aren't. I would know, right? Yeah, I would."
“Peggy made us walk in blind,” Steve says, and he notices how the audience has gone suspiciously quiet, “I mean, we knew our lines and the gist of what was happening, but it was all kind of spontaneous. That scene, especially. We genuinely had to give the performances of our lives and behave as if everything was real, especially with the all-capturing camera angles, because we couldn’t hide and Peggy didn’t want to offer us the lifeline of a second take.”
“It’s a livestream,” Steve repeats much more slowly, enunciating each and every word because he’s a bastard. But he nods almost imperceptibly to Tony, so that his boyfriend doesn’t start worrying that Steve’s upset that he’s been technically outed to everyone. “So say hi. They’ve all watched you fix your hair; there’s no hiding now.”
“Tell me,” Steve said, wrapping his arms around Tony’s back from habit (but again, not with Tony). “I want—”
“Steve,” the bartender yells over, which means Tony has to stop staring like a lunatic, “You have a friend looking for you!”
"Stark, I swear, if you do some dumbass thing like this again and give Steve a panic-induced ulcer or a heart attack again, I will kill you. You didn't land on this team just to be killed by a terrorist," Natasha's sharp voice scolded, but he could hear everything she wasn't saying and the relief in her voice. "
"Seems like you're real broken up over him," Natasha says, glancing over at Steve again. Damn, she's not going to let this one go until he leaves, and maybe not even then. When she looks at Tony, it's to say
Which is why less than a minute later, both of them end up storming down the bar stairs that clearly are marked for employees only, with Rogers fuming and Tony curious. This place is surprisingly clean, albeit a little dark.
"Please," Tony scoffs, because Natasha's eyeing him carefully and in a way that makes him a little nervous.
"You're already tired, and JARVIS won't let you out of your suite or in the reach if anything vaguely interesting until you go to bed."
“Blanket around the world so that the fight can end, we can go home, and none of us do end up dying on that final mission.
So he actually opens up a mindless bubble game on his phone and waits for Fury to be done yelling. He bolts out of there, which isn't exactly uncommon behavior, and then heads into his car. This, he has to check for himself, because it's surreal enough he can't fully grasp it.
“S’not my fault,” Steve mutters, and it is Tony who laughs this time. God, he’s in love with a self-sacrificing, reckless, stubborn idiot and that combination makes for some interesting,
“It will be okay,” she murmurs softly. “Your mother would be proud of you. I met her a few times and something tells me that she would be calling you a fool for shedding tears on her behalf. Chin up. It will be okay.”
"Just that," Pepper says. "Do I want to hear whatever preceded the... Steve Rogers phenomenon? What is it, by the way?"
"Chicken butt," Steve shamelessly quips, before walking in and then unapologetically picking Tony up. All of Tony's attempts to break away go ignored and unsuccessful. Steve doesn't even wince.
“Hey Steve,” Tony replies, swallowing back any memories about what Steve looked like last time. “Please don't ever do something like this ever again with calling for help.”
“Blue cranes,” Tony responds, though several dozen commenters are faster than Tony. “But I don’t think anyone wants to hear about the blue cranes anymore.”
“She—she told me I’d make it up here and cry,” Steve whispers, “Guess she was r-right.” Tony doesn’t say anything in response to that, but Steve thinks he isn’t imagining the tighter hold Tony now has on him.
“Apparently you voluntarily dropped your shield,” Tony points out. “Like it’s not your primary offensive weapon and a one-of-a-kind, valuable and finely crafted shield. Made of the rarest metal on earth.”
“Is that what you’re calling it?” Steve asks dryly, finding the perfect opening to confirm their relationship. “Wow, you think a guy likes you but suddenly you’re only roommates. Though you know what they say about roommates...” Steve winks suggestively at the camera, knowing the comments are about to blow up.
"That's not an answer," Tony points out stubbornly, following Steve's lead on the waltz (waltz?) as the song style changes.
Steve just gives him a sad look, before saying, “I could never hate you.” Before Tony can say anything, Steve walks dangerously close to Tony, brushes a hand out, looks at Tony meaningfully, and then turns off the light. So maybe Tony was projecting (and maybe he was down for some hate-sex). Steve climbs into bed, somehow taking up just a little less than half of the bed even given his considerable stature. It’s clear that Steve has already thought about the bed/floor argument, and came up with a better solution. Only not for Tony, because a night with Steve in the same bed sounds like torture since they aren’t sleeping together.
he had lost it. Fury was basically not at all amused, but then Tony had made a remark about the last time
“Tonight?” Tony asks with a grin, “Well, tonight’s looking great so far. Even if it’s been half an hour and you’re our first interview.”
or c) become the world’s best power couple (semantics if they aren’t actually a couple). But as it stands, Steve’s even turned down Pepper’s offer to stay.
. Natasha's there, the new guy's there, and both of them look at Tony with equal expressions of worry on their faces. God, he doesn’t even know what’s worse: the heavy feeling in his chest at watching Steve fall off the helicarrier, or the blatantly unmasked expression of pain and sadness on Natasha’s face. He doesn't know what to make of it. So he leans against the door and listens to the story pour out of the two, and even they only know pieces of what happened. What truly happened on the Insight helicarrier is locked in Steve's brain. And Steve is unconscious with injuries that would have killed a normal person twice or thrice over. Tony can’t look at him without wanting to beat the shit out of HYDRA
"You know, I like manhandling as much as the next kinky person, but if it happens, I really want some sex to go with it," Tony says.
“The—she showed me something that I wasn’t prepared to see,” Tony reveals reluctantly. “The end of the path that I set us on.” Those words to Fury were fitting, in what he had said.
At least, this is what Tony tells himself when he's sitting in a mission briefing room with everyone else while Fury is yelling at the man about where Rogers is. Apparently he's not responding to his phone, and someone (Tony) has removed all of SHEILD's trackers so they can't even place him. For the first time, Rogers isn't here with a call to fight. Tony would be smirking and cracking jokes if it weren't for the fact that Fury had just ordered them to go find Rogers and bring him here to HQ. Though, picturing the dressing down Rogers was going to get after it was worth the yelling.
Tony quits the video and just decides to go to sleep. He does not shed any tears, thank you very much.
Tony boos at Steve when the doors open and Steve unceremoniously brings Tony to his bedroom and dumps him there. Not literally, but close enough.
When Steve hears his name announced, he thinks he’s dreaming. In fact, even when his body responds and he walks up with a smile he knows will leave wrinkles in his face when he’s seventy, he’s numb to the core. He’s really not in the moment; Steve is lost to the confines of his mind, screaming. He smiles and nods as the presenters give him a little hug and an encouraging nod. Steve feels himself putting down the Oscar to hold the microphone without feeling like he was playing a juggling act.
The blond's expression is icy cold as he snaps, “Don't tell me Fury called me in; he gave me a mandatory two week vacation that's to be obeyed unless aliens attack. Sky's still intact and all, so that isn't it.”
“You’re back early,” Steve says, knowing that everyone can hear him, but they can’t see his face. So he mouths a shhh, without actually pushing the air through. It’s tricky, especially when he can’t put a finger against his lips to actually solidify the gesture but Tony’ll know what he means. That they have an audience. “What’s up?”
“It was my dream,” he whispers into her hair as her grips on him tightens. Is he shaking? Maybe. “And—”
Steve shoots him a questioning look. “Are you sure? Science is never not important, according to this really great guy I know.”
in Tony’s direction, as if he should know better. “Not at all is a longer answer than no. Or like, hell no, not since year X that I am not specifying.” He clears his throat and smiles innocently.
Really, the man is an insufferable, nonagenarian, self-sanctimonious dickhead who has a stick shoved so far up his ass that x-rays probably think he has two spines. Steven Grant Rogers? He's more like Steve 'Goddamnit' Rogers. Fucking jerk. Can't take a single joke, can't accept any kind of an invitation to live at the Tower, can't do anything but yell at Tony; that's who Rogers is. Of course, he's got America and the entire fucking world wrapped around his pinky finger and has them all believing that he's some bastion of apple pie, kindness, and cat-saving goodness. Rogers is a rude, old-fashioned prick, and Tony knows that no one is going to believe him.
But at the end of the gala, when all has been said and done, Steve leaves alone, and Tony hasn't really seen him in the company of an unattached man for too long.
Steve stares straight into the camera with an unamused expression, before looking back to Tony, who’s now leaning over the sofa so that he can also be captured on camera. Tony’s using the screen to fix his hair, actually.
Tony blinks. He hadn’t expected Steve to ever tell him about HYDRA killing his parents, let alone say it was the Winter Soldier’s doing. He hadn’t expected Steve to sound so apologetic, like it was him who did it. He hadn’t expected to Steve to include Jarvis in there either.
“From an idealistic artist in the summer of Spain in 1989 to an irredeemable murderer with a perchance for order, here are the nominees for the best leading male actor in a dramatic motion picture role,” they read, and the screen behind starts to play the clips of the other nominees and their roles.
"Not half-bad, huh?" Steve counters with a smirk that says he doesn't believe Tony. Leaning in a little closer, he whispers, "You're going to have to try a lot harder if you want answers with compliments like that."
For the most part, both Tony and Rogers—he's actually Steve now, since Pepper and Natasha basically forced them to work out a few differences—act like that day never happened. In fact, Tony's has all but physically erased that memory from his mind, had it not been for the fact that he didn't want to forget how Steve took his temper out on Fury. It turned out that Steve had been right about having vacation, and that SHIELD just wanted to make sure he didn't disappear. Basically, it was Fury trying to remind them who's fife they all marched to, except Steve had gone and put a dent in that.
"Yes," Steve says unashamedly. "And don't you dare even ask, because I'm not doing it." Damn, and just when Steve had been entertaining him and his stupid question this night. Tony wanted to press his luck elsewhere.
"Tony," Steve greets with a smile, and Tony blinks. He had been staring at the stairs for too long, zoning out for a second. "Sorry I'm late."
"Bucky loved dancing. Bucky loved taking me on double dates that involved dancing. I loved dancing. And I also loved going to clubs all around Brooklyn and finding people to dance with," Steve's face lit up a little at the mention of it, like a man who wished he could go back, and like a man who seemed to be reminiscing past naïveté.

Because tonight, Tony's at a charity gala that the Maria Stark Foundation is hosting—not to be mistaken for the annual MSFG or any of Tony's parties. Of course, all of the Avengers are now on the roster, as has been the normal for the past few months, but Tony no longer has a need to worry. Thor is off-planet and he's the only one prone to damage things nowadays. Natasha and Clint have made it a competition to charm as many people as possible (which is only good for him) and though it stemmed out of an argument on who has better social skills, Tony isn't going to get in the way of that. Bruce, whenever he comes, always manages to find a fellow scientist or science enthusiast and then spends the entire night talking science. He isn't here tonight though, bowing out thanks to a science conference. Steve, Tony has only worried about once and that was at the initial Avenger's post-Loki press conference because he didn't want to have to be stuck on cleanup PR duty. But after the first one, he had discovered Steve has incredible schmoozing skills, probably gained from being Captain America and being a showgirl. Steve is in no way shy when it comes to people, unlike what his reputation says.
showed up here randomly, asking specifically for me.” The way he says friend, almost like a double entendre, coupled with his previous words of charging money for people finding him, has Tony's mind spinning with possibilities that are all very, very unlikely. And yet, he can't help but think that Rogers's very presence here is unlikely, why not what else he's thinking?
